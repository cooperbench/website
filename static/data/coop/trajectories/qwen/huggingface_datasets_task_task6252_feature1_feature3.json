Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3.

If either dimension exceeds the threshold, the image is resized using Pillow's `thumbnail()` method to fit within the specified bounds.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: High-resolution images can consume excessive memory and slow down preprocessing, especially in large-scale training pipelines. Users currently have to manually resize such images after decoding.\n\nGoal: Introduce an optional max_resolution parameter to the Image feature that clamps image dimensions during decoding. If an image exceeds the specified width or height, it is downscaled proportionally to fit within the limit while maintaining aspect ratio.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\n- Support both integer (single value) and tuple (width, height) inputs\n- Downscale images using Pillow's thumbnail() method to maintain aspect ratio\n- Only apply downscaling if either dimension exceeds the threshold\n- Preserve existing functionality (decode, mode, etc.)\n- Add proper documentation and type hints\n- Handle edge cases (None values, invalid inputs)\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (I own entirely - I'll handle lines 210-300)\nOther Agent Handles: EXIF orientation correction (lines 200-209)\nShared File Strategy: No overlapping line ranges. I'll add my implementation after the EXIF correction logic. Both implementations will be in the same file but in non-overlapping sections.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The max_resolution parameter will be added to the Image class constructor and processed in the decode_example method. The implementation will use Pillow's thumbnail() method for proportional downscaling.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Must maintain backward compatibility (default max_resolution=None)\n- Must handle both integer and tuple inputs for max_resolution\n- Must use thumbnail() method to preserve aspect ratio\n- Must not modify image if dimensions are already within limits\n- Must add proper type hints and docstring\n- Must handle None values gracefully\n- Must not interfere with existing decode functionality\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add max_resolution parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 48 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: \n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: Optional[str] = None\n    decode: bool = True\n    id: Optional[str] = None\n    max_resolution: Optional[Union[int, Tuple[int, int]]] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Add the parameter after decode with proper type hint.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected during decoding, causing visual misalignment and inconsistent dimensions in downstream tasks like object detection or layout modeling.\nGoal: Automatically apply EXIF orientation correction during image decoding using PIL's exif_transpose() method, ensuring consistent and correct image orientation without requiring manual preprocessing.\nRequirements: \n- Must integrate with existing Image class in datasets.features.image.py\n- Must not break backward compatibility\n- Must handle all valid EXIF orientation cases\n- Must preserve image data integrity and performance\n- Must be optional and only applied when EXIF data exists\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: \n- src/datasets/features/image.py: Shared - I own lines 200-250 (EXIF correction logic), other agent owns lines 210-260 (max_resolution logic)\nOther Agent Handles: Implementation of max_resolution parameter and downscaling logic\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate line ranges to prevent overlap; I will add EXIF correction starting at line 200, other agent will add max_resolution logic starting at line 210\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution extends the existing Image class's decode_example method to check for EXIF orientation and apply exif_transpose() if present. Uses PIL's built-in exif_transpose() method which handles all 8 EXIF orientation cases.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must import PIL.Image and ImageOps at the top of the file\n- Must handle cases where EXIF data is missing or invalid\n- Must preserve existing behavior when decode=False\n- Must not modify the image if no EXIF orientation is present\n- Must maintain the same return type (PIL.Image.Image)\n- Must not introduce performance overhead for images without EXIF data\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add required imports for EXIF handling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After existing imports (line 20)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none -

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Automatic EXIF Orientation Correction for Images\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis feature introduces automatic correction for images with EXIF orientation metadata by applying a transpose operation during image decoding. This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected during decoding, causing visual misalignment and inconsistent dimensions in downstream tasks like object detection or layout modeling.\nGoal: Automatically apply EXIF orientation correction during image decoding using PIL's exif_transpose() method, ensuring consistent and correct image orientation without requiring manual preprocessing.\nRequirements: \n- Must integrate with existing Image class in datasets.features.image.py\n- Must not break backward compatibility\n- Must handle all valid EXIF orientation cases\n- Must preserve image data integrity and performance\n- Must be optional and only applied when EXIF data exists\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: \n- src/datasets/features/image.py: Shared - I own lines 200-250 (EXIF correction logic), other agent owns lines 210-260 (max_resolution logic)\nOther Agent Handles: Implementation of max_resolution parameter and downscaling logic\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate line ranges to prevent overlap; I will add EXIF correction starting at line 200, other agent will add max_resolution logic starting at line 210\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution extends the existing Image class's decode_example method to check for EXIF orientation and apply exif_transpose() if present. Uses PIL's built-in exif_transpose() method which handles all 8 EXIF orientation cases.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must import PIL.Image and ImageOps at the top of the file\n- Must handle cases where EXIF data is missing or invalid\n- Must preserve existing behavior when decode=False\n- Must not modify the image if no EXIF orientation is present\n- Must maintain the same return type (PIL.Image.Image)\n- Must not introduce performance overhead for images without EXIF data\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add required imports for EXIF handling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After existing imports (line 20)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none -

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Automatic EXIF Orientation Correction for Images\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis feature introduces automatic correction for images with EXIF orientation metadata by applying a transpose operation during image decoding. This resolves a long-standing issue where images loaded via PIL could appear rotated or flipped due to EXIF data, causing inconsistencies in image dimensions\u2014particularly problematic for tasks like object detection or layout-aware models.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nImages with an EXIF orientation tag are not automatically rotated by default when loaded via PIL, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual image orientations. This led to discrepancies in tasks that rely on spatial alignment, such as bounding box predictions or layout modeling. Previously, users had to manually apply `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` during preprocessing.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe solution integrates EXIF orientation correction directly into the image decoding process within the `datasets.features.Image` class. This is achieved by checking for the presence of the EXIF orientation tag and applying `ImageOps.exif_transpose()` automatically. \n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Images with EXIF orientation metadata are not automatically corrected during decoding, causing visual misalignment and inconsistent dimensions in downstream tasks like object detection or layout modeling.\nGoal: Automatically apply EXIF orientation correction during image decoding using PIL's exif_transpose() method, ensuring consistent and correct image orientation without requiring manual preprocessing.\nRequirements: \n- Must integrate with existing Image class in datasets.features.image.py\n- Must not break backward compatibility\n- Must handle all valid EXIF orientation cases\n- Must preserve image data integrity and performance\n- Must be optional and only applied when EXIF data exists\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: \n- src/datasets/features/image.py: Shared - I own lines 200-250 (EXIF correction logic), other agent owns lines 210-260 (max_resolution logic)\nOther Agent Handles: Implementation of max_resolution parameter and downscaling logic\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate line ranges to prevent overlap; I will add EXIF correction starting at line 200, other agent will add max_resolution logic starting at line 210\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution extends the existing Image class's decode_example method to check for EXIF orientation and apply exif_transpose() if present. Uses PIL's built-in exif_transpose() method which handles all 8 EXIF orientation cases.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must import PIL.Image and ImageOps at the top of the file\n- Must handle cases where EXIF data is missing or invalid\n- Must preserve existing behavior when decode=False\n- Must not modify the image if no EXIF orientation is present\n- Must maintain the same return type (PIL.Image.Image)\n- Must not introduce performance overhead for images without EXIF data\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add required imports for EXIF handling\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After existing imports (line 20)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none -
