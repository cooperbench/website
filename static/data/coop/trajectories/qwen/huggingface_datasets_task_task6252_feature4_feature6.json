Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\nGoal: Add an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature that allows users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding, automatically removing unwanted border artifacts.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` class (default: 0, type: int, optional)\n- Apply cropping using Pillow's `crop()` method after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Maintain backward compatibility (default behavior unchanged when `crop_margin=0`)\n- Support both file paths and bytes input\n- Document the new parameter in the class docstring\n- Update type hints and type checks\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: `src/datasets/features/image.py` - I own the entire file for this implementation\nOther Agent Handles: CMYK-to-RGB conversion in the same file (after my changes)\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate on line positioning. I will add `crop_margin` parameter and cropping logic before the `image.load()` call. The other agent will add CMYK conversion after `image.load()` but before `self.mode` conversion.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Image` feature is a dataclass that handles image decoding. The `decode_example` method is responsible for loading and processing images. The `crop_margin` parameter will be added to the `Image` class and processed in `decode_example`.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Must maintain backward compatibility (crop_margin=0 should produce identical output to original behavior)\n- Must use Pillow's `crop()` method with proper coordinates (left, top, right, bottom)\n- Must handle both file path and bytes input cases\n- Must preserve the original image center when cropping\n- Must update type hints and docstring\n- Must not interfere with the other agent's CMYK conversion logic\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 86 (after `decode` parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `decode: bool = True`\nAfter Code: `decode: bool = True\n    crop_margin: int = 0`\nCritical Details: Add as a new parameter after `decode`, with default value 0. Use the same indentation as other parameters.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 87 (after the existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    id: Optional[str] = None`\nAfter Code: `    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: int = 0  # Number of pixels to crop from each edge of the image during decoding (default: 0)`\nCritical Details: Add as a new line after `id` parameter. Use the same indentation. Include parameter description in the docstring.\n\n### Step 3: Update Image class type hints to include crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 88 (after `dtype` definition)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"`\nAfter Code: `    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    crop_margin: int = 0`\nCritical Details: Add as a new line after `dtype` definition. Use the same indentation. Include the parameter in the type hints.\n\n### Step 4: Add crop_margin validation in decode_example method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 153 (after `if not self.decode:`)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `        if not self.decode:\n            raise RuntimeError(\"Decoding is disabled for this feature.

Please use Image(decode=True) instead.\")\n        if self.crop_margin < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"crop_margin must be non-negative\")`\nCritical Details: Add the validation after the existing `if not self.decode` check. Use the same indentation level. Raise ValueError for negative values.\n\n### Step 5: Add cropping logic after image loading but before mode conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 188 (after `image.load()`)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `        image.load()`\nAfter Code: `        image.load()\n        if self.crop_margin > 0:\n            width, height = image.size\n            left = self.crop_margin\n            top = self.crop_margin\n            right = width - self.crop_margin\n            bottom = height - self.crop_margin\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))`\nCritical Details: Add the cropping logic after `image.load()` but before `if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:`. Use the same indentation level. Calculate coordinates based on image size and crop_margin. Use Pillow's `crop()` method with (left, top, right, bottom) tuple.\n\n### Step 6: Update Image class to include crop_margin in __repr__\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 90 (after `id` parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)`\nAfter Code: `    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Image(decode={self.decode}, crop_margin={self.crop_margin}, id={self.id})\"`\nCritical Details: Add the `__repr__` method after the `_type` field. Include all parameters in the representation. Use the same indentation level.\n\n### Step 7: Update Image class to include crop_margin in __eq__\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 91 (after `__call__` method)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type`\nAfter Code: `    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return (isinstance(other, Image) and\n                self.decode == other.decode and\n                self.crop_margin == other.crop_margin and\n                self.mode == other.mode and\n                self.id == other.id)`\nCritical Details: Add the `__eq__` method after `__call__`. Include `crop_margin` in the equality comparison. Use the same indentation level.\n\n### Step 8: Update Image class to include crop_margin in encode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 95 (after `def encode_example` signature)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    def encode_example(self, value: Union[str, bytes, dict, np.ndarray, \"PIL.Image.Image\"]) -> dict:`\nAfter Code: `    def encode_example(self, value: Union[str, bytes, dict, np.ndarray, \"PIL.Image.Image\"]) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Encode example into a format for Arrow.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`str`, `np.ndarray`, `PIL.Image.Image` or `dict`):\n                Data passed as input to Image feature.\n\n        Returns:\n            `dict`: Dictionary with 'path' and 'bytes' keys.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.decode:\n            return value\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            return value\n        if isinstance(value, str):\n            return {\"path\": value, \"bytes\": None}\n        if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):\n            return {\"path\": None, \"bytes\": value.tobytes()}\n        if isinstance(value, PIL.Image.Image):\n            return {\"path\": None, \"bytes\": value.tobytes()}\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported type: {type(value)}\")`\nCritical Details: Add the `encode_example` method after `__eq__`. Include the docstring and all parameter checks. The method should return the original value if decode=False, and properly encode the input to a dictionary with 'path' and 'bytes' keys.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_4 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Optional Image Border Cropping Support\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nIntroduces an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature, allowing users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding. This is particularly helpful for removing watermarks or unwanted framing artifacts present at the borders.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nSome datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe new `crop_margin parameter` allows for automatic cropping of a uniform margin (specified in pixels) from all four sides of the image during decoding. This is implemented using Pillow's `crop()` method, preserving the original image center and reducing preprocessing complexity.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Some datasets include images with consistent edge artifacts such as watermarks or borders that need to be removed prior to model training. Currently, users must manually crop images post-decoding, which adds unnecessary processing overhead.\n\nGoal: Add an optional `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` feature that allows users to crop a fixed number of pixels from each edge of an image during decoding, automatically removing unwanted border artifacts.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add `crop_margin` parameter to the `Image` class (default: 0, type: int, optional)\n- Apply cropping using Pillow's `crop()` method after image loading but before mode conversion\n- Maintain backward compatibility (default behavior unchanged when `crop_margin=0`)\n- Support both file paths and bytes input\n- Document the new parameter in the class docstring\n- Update type hints and type checks\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: `src/datasets/features/image.py` - I own the entire file for this implementation\nOther Agent Handles: CMYK-to-RGB conversion in the same file (after my changes)\nShared File Strategy: Coordinate on line positioning. I will add `crop_margin` parameter and cropping logic before the `image.load()` call. The other agent will add CMYK conversion after `image.load()` but before `self.mode` conversion.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The `Image` feature is a dataclass that handles image decoding. The `decode_example` method is responsible for loading and processing images. The `crop_margin` parameter will be added to the `Image` class and processed in `decode_example`.\n\nCritical Notes:\n- Must maintain backward compatibility (crop_margin=0 should produce identical output to original behavior)\n- Must use Pillow's `crop()` method with proper coordinates (left, top, right, bottom)\n- Must handle both file path and bytes input cases\n- Must preserve the original image center when cropping\n- Must update type hints and docstring\n- Must not interfere with the other agent's CMYK conversion logic\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add crop_margin parameter to Image class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 86 (after `decode` parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `decode: bool = True`\nAfter Code: `decode: bool = True\n    crop_margin: int = 0`\nCritical Details: Add as a new parameter after `decode`, with default value 0. Use the same indentation as other parameters.\n\n### Step 2: Update Image class docstring to document crop_margin parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 87 (after the existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    id: Optional[str] = None`\nAfter Code: `    id: Optional[str] = None\n    crop_margin: int = 0  # Number of pixels to crop from each edge of the image during decoding (default: 0)`\nCritical Details: Add as a new line after `id` parameter. Use the same indentation. Include parameter description in the docstring.\n\n### Step 3: Update Image class type hints to include crop_margin\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 88 (after `dtype` definition)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"`\nAfter Code: `    dtype: ClassVar[str] = \"PIL.Image.Image\"\n    crop_margin: int = 0`\nCritical Details: Add as a new line after `dtype` definition. Use the same indentation. Include the parameter in the type hints.\n\n### Step 4: Add crop_margin validation in decode_example method\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 153 (after `if not self.decode:`)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `        if not self.decode:\n            raise RuntimeError(\"Decoding is disabled for this feature. Please use Image(decode=True) instead.\")`\nAfter Code: `        if not self.decode:\n            raise RuntimeError(\"Decoding is disabled for this feature. Please use Image(decode=True) instead.\")\n        if self.crop_margin < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"crop_margin must be non-negative\")`\nCritical Details: Add the validation after the existing `if not self.decode` check. Use the same indentation level. Raise ValueError for negative values.\n\n### Step 5: Add cropping logic after image loading but before mode conversion\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 188 (after `image.load()`)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `        image.load()`\nAfter Code: `        image.load()\n        if self.crop_margin > 0:\n            width, height = image.size\n            left = self.crop_margin\n            top = self.crop_margin\n            right = width - self.crop_margin\n            bottom = height - self.crop_margin\n            image = image.crop((left, top, right, bottom))`\nCritical Details: Add the cropping logic after `image.load()` but before `if self.mode and self.mode != image.mode:`. Use the same indentation level. Calculate coordinates based on image size and crop_margin. Use Pillow's `crop()` method with (left, top, right, bottom) tuple.\n\n### Step 6: Update Image class to include crop_margin in __repr__\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 90 (after `id` parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)`\nAfter Code: `    _type: str = field(default=\"Image\", init=False, repr=False)\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Image(decode={self.decode}, crop_margin={self.crop_margin}, id={self.id})\"`\nCritical Details: Add the `__repr__` method after the `_type` field. Include all parameters in the representation. Use the same indentation level.\n\n### Step 7: Update Image class to include crop_margin in __eq__\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 91 (after `__call__` method)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type`\nAfter Code: `    def __call__(self):\n        return self.pa_type\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return (isinstance(other, Image) and\n                self.decode == other.decode and\n                self.crop_margin == other.crop_margin and\n                self.mode == other.mode and\n                self.id == other.id)`\nCritical Details: Add the `__eq__` method after `__call__`. Include `crop_margin` in the equality comparison. Use the same indentation level.\n\n### Step 8: Update Image class to include crop_margin in encode_example\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 95 (after `def encode_example` signature)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    def encode_example(self, value: Union[str, bytes, dict, np.ndarray, \"PIL.Image.Image\"]) -> dict:`\nAfter Code: `    def encode_example(self, value: Union[str, bytes, dict, np.ndarray, \"PIL.Image.Image\"]) -> dict:\n        \"\"\"Encode example into a format for Arrow.\n\n        Args:\n            value (`str`, `np.ndarray`, `PIL.Image.Image` or `dict`):\n                Data passed as input to Image feature.\n\n        Returns:\n            `dict`: Dictionary with 'path' and 'bytes' keys.\n        \"\"\"\n        if not self.decode:\n            return value\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            return value\n        if isinstance(value, str):\n            return {\"path\": value, \"bytes\": None}\n        if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):\n            return {\"path\": None, \"bytes\": value.tobytes()}\n        if isinstance(value, PIL.Image.Image):\n            return {\"path\": None, \"bytes\": value.tobytes()}\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported type: {type(value)}\")`\nCritical Details: Add the `encode_example` method after `__eq__`. Include the docstring and all parameter checks. The method should return the original value if decode=False, and properly encode the input to a dictionary with 'path' and 'bytes' keys.\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5.

If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "thought": ""}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 3, "timestamp": "2025-12-13T05:44:53.630183", "source": "environment", "message": "Added workspace context", "cause": 2, "observation": "recall", "content": "Added workspace context", "extras": {"recall_type": "workspace_context", "repo_name": "", "repo_directory": "", "repo_branch": "", "repo_instructions": "", "runtime_hosts": {"http://localhost:51756": 51756, "http://localhost:57900": 57900}, "additional_agent_instructions": "", "date": "2025-12-13", "custom_secrets_descriptions": {}, "conversation_instructions": "", "working_dir": "/workspace", "microagent_knowledge": []}, "agentId": "agent_2"}, {"id": 5, "timestamp": "2025-12-13T05:45:01.030696", "source": "agent", "message": "Running command: \nls -la src/datasets/features/\n", "action": "run", "tool_call_metadata": {"function_name": "execute_bash", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01", "model_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-e41054b4a1964c58be45bdca017925a1", "created": 1765604697, "model": "qwen3", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "I'll implement the optional image border cropping support feature according to the plan.
