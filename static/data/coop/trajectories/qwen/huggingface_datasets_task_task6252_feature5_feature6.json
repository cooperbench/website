Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* NEVER create multiple versions of the same file with different suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py). Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\nGoal: Enable users to directly work with normalized float32 NumPy arrays by adding an 'as_array' flag to the Image feature that automatically converts decoded images to float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1].\n\nRequirements: \n1. Add 'as_array' parameter to Image class constructor with default value False\n2. When as_array=True, decode_example should return a float32 NumPy array scaled to [0, 1]\n3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing behavior when as_array=False\n4. Ensure proper handling of all image modes and data types\n5. Preserve existing functionality for mode conversion and decoding\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (Shared - we have agreed on specific sections)\nOther Agent Handles: CMYK to RGB conversion in decode_example method (after mode conversion)\nShared File Strategy: I will modify the Image class constructor and as_array logic. You will handle CMYK to RGB conversion in decode_example method after the mode conversion. We will coordinate on line positioning to avoid conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature uses a dataclass with a decode_example method that handles various input types. The new as_array functionality will be integrated into this existing pattern.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must maintain backward compatibility\n- Float32 conversion must be explicit\n- Scaling to [0, 1] must be done correctly (divide by 255.0 for uint8)\n- Must handle all image modes (RGB, RGBA, L, etc.)\n- Must preserve existing mode conversion functionality\n- Must not interfere with the CMYK to RGB conversion you're implementing\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 85 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `decode: bool = True`\nAfter Code: `decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False`\nCritical Details: Add new parameter after decode with default value False. Maintain proper indentation and spacing.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to document as_array parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 86 (after decode parameter description)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    decode (`bool`, defaults to `True`):\n            Whether to decode the image data.

If `False`,`\n    as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n        Whether to return the image as a float32 NumPy array scaled to [0, 1]. If `False`, returns a PIL Image.`\nCritical Details: Add exactly as shown with proper indentation and formatting.

Maintain proper indentation and spacing.\n\n### Step 4: Modify decode_example to handle as_array option\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 190-200\nLocation: Line 190 (after image.convert(self.mode) line)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `            image = image.convert(self.mode)`\nAfter Code: `            image = image.convert(self.mode)\n            # Convert to NumPy array if as_array is True\n            if self.as_array:\n                # Convert PIL Image to NumPy array\n                array = np.array(image)\n                # Scale to [0, 1] and convert to float32\n                if array.dtype == np.uint8:\n                    array = array.astype(np.float32) / 255.0\n                else:\n                    array = array.astype(np.float32)\n                image = array`\nCritical Details: Add exactly as shown with proper indentation. The code must be added after the mode conversion line. Use the exact variable names and formatting. The scaling logic must divide by 255.0 for uint8 images.\n\n### Step 5: Update Image class docstring with examples\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 82 (after existing examples)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=False))\n    {'bytes': None,\n     'path': '/root/.cache/huggingface/datasets/downloads/extracted/b0a21163f78769a2cf11f58dfc767fb458fc7cea5c05dccc0144a2c0f0bc1292/train/healthy/healthy_train.85.jpg'}\n    ````\nAfter Code: `    ```py\n    >>> from datasets import load_dataset, Image\n    >>> ds = load_dataset(\"beans\", split=\"train\")\n    >>> ds.features[\"image\"]\n    Image(decode=True, id=None)\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=500x500 at 0x15E52E7F0>\n    >>> ds = ds.cast_column('image', Image(decode=True, as_array=True))\n    >>> ds[0][\"image\"]\n    array([[[0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            ...\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647]],\n\n           [[0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            ...\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647]],\n\n           [[0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            ...\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647],\n            [0.12156863, 0.13333334, 0.14117647]]], dtype=float32)\n    ```\nCritical Details: Add the example exactly as shown with proper indentation. The example must demonstrate both the default behavior and the as_array=True behavior. The array output must show the float32 dtype and values scaled to [0, 1].\n\n### Step 6: Add type hints for as_array parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 47 (after class definition)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `@dataclass`\nAfter Code: `@dataclass\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any, ClassVar, Dict, List, Optional, Union\n\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\n    import PIL.Image\n\n    from .features import FeatureType`\nCritical Details: Add the import statements exactly as shown with proper indentation.

Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_5 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

This enables users to directly work with NumPy arrays in downstream pipelines without relying on PIL post-processing.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nMany machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\n**Solution**:\nWhen `Image(as_array=True)` is used, decoded images are automatically converted to NumPy arrays of `dtype=float32` and scaled to [0, 1]. This simplifies integration with NumPy-based pipelines and enables consistent preprocessing across datasets.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/image.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Many machine learning workflows operate directly on NumPy arrays with normalized pixel values. Currently, images are returned as PIL Images, requiring extra conversion steps that may introduce performance overhead or inconsistency in preprocessing pipelines.\n\nGoal: Enable users to directly work with normalized float32 NumPy arrays by adding an 'as_array' flag to the Image feature that automatically converts decoded images to float32 NumPy arrays scaled to [0, 1].\n\nRequirements: \n1. Add 'as_array' parameter to Image class constructor with default value False\n2. When as_array=True, decode_example should return a float32 NumPy array scaled to [0, 1]\n3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing behavior when as_array=False\n4. Ensure proper handling of all image modes and data types\n5. Preserve existing functionality for mode conversion and decoding\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/image.py (Shared - we have agreed on specific sections)\nOther Agent Handles: CMYK to RGB conversion in decode_example method (after mode conversion)\nShared File Strategy: I will modify the Image class constructor and as_array logic. You will handle CMYK to RGB conversion in decode_example method after the mode conversion. We will coordinate on line positioning to avoid conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The Image feature uses a dataclass with a decode_example method that handles various input types. The new as_array functionality will be integrated into this existing pattern.\nCritical Notes: \n- Must maintain backward compatibility\n- Float32 conversion must be explicit\n- Scaling to [0, 1] must be done correctly (divide by 255.0 for uint8)\n- Must handle all image modes (RGB, RGBA, L, etc.)\n- Must preserve existing mode conversion functionality\n- Must not interfere with the CMYK to RGB conversion you're implementing\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add as_array parameter to Image class constructor\nFile: `src/datasets/features/image.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 85 (after decode parameter)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: `decode: bool = True`\nAfter Code: `decode: bool = True\n    as_array: bool = False`\nCritical Details: Add new parameter after decode with default value False.

If `False`,`\n    as_array (`bool`, defaults to `False`):\n        Whether to return the image as a float32 NumPy array scaled to [0, 1].
