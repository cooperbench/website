Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`.

Return both the buffer and size as a tuple\n- The implementation follows the same pattern as existing methods\nCritical Notes: \n- Must use `getbuffer().nbytes` for size calculation (more reliable than `len(buffer.getvalue())`)\n- Must maintain consistent docstring format with existing methods\n- Must preserve existing method signatures and behavior\n- Must add new methods at the end of the file after existing methods\n- Must use the same import statements and formatting\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add resolve_image_with_size() method\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the resolve_document() method (around line 225)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```\ndef resolve_image_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolve an image such that PIL can read it, and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n    Args:\n        as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved image should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[BytesIO, int]: The resolved image buffer and its byte size\n    \"\"\"\n    buffer = self.resolve_image(as_base64=as_base64)\n    buffer.seek(0)\n    return buffer, buffer.getbuffer().nbytes\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Use `tuple[BytesIO, int]` type annotation\n- Maintain consistent docstring format with existing methods\n- Use `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` for size calculation\n- Keep same indentation and spacing as surrounding code\n\n### Step 2: Add resolve_audio_with_size() method\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the resolve_image_with_size() method (around line 240)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```\ndef resolve_audio_with_size(self, as_base64: bool = False) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolve an audio such that PIL can read it, and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n    Args:\n        as_base64 (bool): whether the resolved audio should be returned as base64-encoded bytes\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[BytesIO, int]: The resolved audio buffer and its byte size\n    \"\"\"\n    buffer = self.resolve_audio(as_base64=as_base64)\n    buffer.seek(0)\n    return buffer, buffer.getbuffer().nbytes\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Use `tuple[BytesIO, int]` type annotation\n- Maintain consistent docstring format with existing methods\n- Use `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` for size calculation\n- Keep same indentation and spacing as surrounding code\n\n### Step 3: Add resolve_document_with_size() method\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the resolve_audio_with_size() method (around line 255)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```\ndef resolve_document_with_size(self) -> tuple[BytesIO, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Resolve a document such that it is represented by a BufferIO object, and return both the buffer and its byte size.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple[BytesIO, int]: The resolved document buffer and its byte size\n    \"\"\"\n    buffer = self.resolve_document()\n    buffer.seek(0)\n    return buffer, buffer.getbuffer().nbytes\n```\nCritical Details: \n- Use `tuple[BytesIO, int]` type annotation\n- Maintain consistent docstring format with existing methods\n- Use `buffer.getbuffer().nbytes` for size calculation\n- Keep same indentation and spacing as surrounding code\n\n### Step 4: Verify file structure and formatting\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code: [existing code]\nAfter Code: [existing code]\nCritical Details: \n- Ensure all three new methods are added in the correct order\n- Verify consistent spacing and indentation\n- Confirm no syntax errors\n- Ensure all imports are properly formatted\n- Confirm docstrings match existing style\n- Confirm type annotations are correct\n\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.\n\n**Description**\nThis feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`. The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Consumers of audio blocks need visibility into the final byte size of resolved audio buffers for UI progress indicators, logging, and telemetry.

This enhancement supports UI progress indicators, logging, and custom metric collection.\n\n**Description**\nThis feature allows developers to pass a progress hook via the `on_resolve` parameter when calling `AudioBlock.resolve_audio()`. The callback receives the byte count of the resolved audio buffer, providing visibility into data size at runtime. This is especially beneficial in UI contexts (e.g., displaying load progress) or for backend monitoring and analytics systems that depend on precise resource usage metrics.\n\n**Technical Background**\n\n**Problem**\nConsumers of audio blocks may need insight into how much data is processed during resolution, especially when displaying user-facing progress updates or gathering telemetry. Previously, there was no way to extract this size information without duplicating resolution logic or manually inspecting buffers.\n\n**Solution**\nAn optional `on_resolve: Callable[[int], None]` argument is added to the `resolve_audio()` method. After resolving and trimming the audio buffer, the callback is invoked with the final byte length of the buffer. This change is fully backward compatible and only activates if the hook is explicitly provided.\n\n**Files Modified**\n\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/base/llms/types.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: Consumers of audio blocks need visibility into the final byte size of resolved audio buffers for UI progress indicators, logging, and telemetry.
