Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

This led to inaccurate normalization and scoring behavior, particularly in cases where the number of relevant documents differed from the number of retrieved documents. A previous fix attempt did not address this underlying issue.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe fix redefines the IDCG calculation to iterate over the number of expected relevant documents, aligning with standard definitions of NDCG. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The NDCG metric incorrectly computes the ideal DCG (IDCG) by using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids)) instead of the total number of expected relevant documents. This leads to inaccurate normalization, especially when the number of retrieved documents differs from the number of expected relevant documents. The fix must align with standard NDCG definitions.\n\nGoal: Correct the IDCG calculation to use the number of expected relevant documents (len(expected_ids)) rather than the minimum of retrieved and expected documents, ensuring accurate normalization and scoring.\n\nRequirements:\n- The IDCG must be computed based on the number of expected relevant documents\n- The change must preserve existing behavior for edge cases (e.g., no relevant documents)\n- The fix must maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n- The implementation must be consistent with standard NDCG mathematical definition\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared - I own the IDCG calculation logic, you own the graded relevance enhancement\nOther Agent Handles: Adding support for graded relevance scores and custom relevance scoring\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on the NDCG class in metrics.py. I will modify the IDCG calculation, and you will implement the graded relevance feature. We will ensure our changes don't interfere by using different sections of the code.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The NDCG metric is a subclass of BaseRetrievalMetric in the retrieval evaluation module. The fix involves modifying the compute method to correctly calculate IDCG.\nCritical Notes: Must preserve the existing edge case handling for idcg == 0. Must maintain the same function signature and return type. Must not modify the dcg calculation logic. Must use the same discounted_gain helper function.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify IDCG calculation to use expected relevant document count\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 380-386\nLocation: Line 380 (after the dcg calculation)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n        # Calculate IDCG using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        # Since we can't achieve better than perfect ranking of all relevant docs\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\nAfter Code:\n        # Calculate IDCG using the number of expected relevant documents\n        # This represents the perfect ranking of all relevant documents\n        ideal_length = len(expected_ids)\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\nCritical Details: Keep the same indentation and formatting. Maintain the same variable names. Do not modify any other lines in this section. Preserve the existing edge case handling at line 389.\n\n### Step 2: Update docstring to reflect corrected IDCG calculation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 320-328\nLocation: Line 320 (after the class docstring)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n    \"\"\"NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metric.\n\n    The position `p` is taken as the size of the query results (which is usually\n    `top_k` of the retriever).\n\n    Currently only supports binary relevance\n    (``rel=1`` if document is in ``expected_ids``, otherwise ``rel=0``)\n    since we assume that ``expected_ids`` is unordered.\n\n    Attributes:\n        metric_name (str): The name of the metric.\n        mode (DiscountedGainMode): Determines the formula for each item in the summation.\n    \"\"\"\nAfter Code:\n    \"\"\"NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metric.\n\n    The position `p` is taken as the size of the query results (which is usually\n    `top_k` of the retriever).\n\n    The ideal DCG (IDCG) is computed based on the number of expected relevant documents\n    rather than the minimum of retrieved and expected documents, aligning with standard\n    NDCG definition.\n\n    Currently only supports binary relevance\n    (``rel=1`` if document is in ``expected_ids``, otherwise ``rel=0``)\n    since we assume that ``expected_ids`` is unordered.\n\n    Attributes:\n        metric_name (str): The name of the metric.\n        mode (DiscountedGainMode): Determines the formula for each item in the summation.\n    \"\"\"\nCritical Details: Keep the same indentation and formatting. Add the new sentence about IDCG calculation. Do not modify any other parts of the docstring.\n\n### Step 3: Add comment explaining the corrected IDCG calculation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 380-386\nLocation: Line 380 (after the dcg calculation)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - insert after dcg calculation]\nAfter Code:\n        # Calculate IDCG using the number of expected relevant documents\n        # This represents the perfect ranking of all relevant documents\n        # The standard NDCG definition uses the total number of relevant documents\n        # rather than the minimum of retrieved and expected documents\n        ideal_length = len(expected_ids)\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\nCritical Details: Add the three-line comment block before the ideal_length assignment. Use the exact same formatting as the existing code. Keep the same indentation level.\n\n### Step 4: Verify edge case handling remains unchanged\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 389-393\nLocation: Line 389 (after idcg calculation)\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code:\n        if idcg == 0:\n            return RetrievalMetricResult(score=0.0)\n        ndcg_score = dcg / idcg\n        return RetrievalMetricResult(score=ndcg_score)\nAfter Code: [same as before - no change needed]\nCritical Details: No code changes required. This edge case handling is already correct and must be preserved.\n\n### Step 5: Confirm no changes to dcg calculation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 375-378\nLocation: Line 375 (after dcg calculation)\nAction: Verify\nBefore Code:\n        dcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=docid in expected_set, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, docid in enumerate(retrieved_ids, start=1)\n        )\nAfter Code: [same as before - no change needed]\nCritical Details: The dcg calculation must remain unchanged as it correctly computes the actual DCG based on retrieved documents.\n\n### Step 6: Ensure no conflicts with graded relevance feature\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle the IDCG calculation, you handle graded relevance\nLocation: Lines 380-386 (IDCG calculation section)\nAction: Coordinate\nBefore Code: [existing code]\nAfter Code: [your implementation]\nCritical Details: Our changes are in different sections of the code. My changes affect IDCG calculation using expected_ids length, while your changes will likely affect the relevance scoring mechanism. No conflicts expected as long as we don't modify the same variables or logic.\n\n### Step 7: Add test case for the corrected IDCG calculation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/test_metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle test cases\nLocation: End of file\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n    def test_ndcg_correct_idcg_calculation(self):\n        \"\"\"Test that IDCG is calculated using expected relevant document count.\"\"\n        metric = NDCG()\n        \n        # Test case: more retrieved documents than expected\n        retrieved_ids = [\"doc1\", \"doc2\", \"doc3\", \"doc4\"]\n        expected_ids = [\"doc1\", \"doc2\"]\n        \n        result = metric.compute(\n            retrieved_ids=retrieved_ids,\n            expected_ids=expected_ids\n        )\n        \n        # IDCG should be based on len(expected_ids) = 2, not min(4,2) = 2 in this case\n        # But the calculation is now correct for all cases\n        assert result.score >= 0.0\n        assert result.score <= 1.0\n        \n        # Test case: fewer retrieved documents than expected\n        retrieved_ids = [\"doc1\"]\n        expected_ids = [\"doc1\", \"doc2\", \"doc3\"]\n        \n        result = metric.compute(\n            retrieved_ids=retrieved_ids,\n            expected_ids=expected_ids\n        )\n        \n        # IDCG should be based on len(expected_ids) = 3, not min(1,3) = 1\n        # The calculation is now correct\n        assert result.score >= 0.0\n        assert result.score <= 1.0\n        \n        # Test case: no relevant documents\n        retrieved_ids = [\"doc1\", \"doc2\"]\n        expected_ids = []\n        \n        result = metric.compute(\n            retrieved_ids=retrieved_ids,\n            expected_ids=expected_ids\n        )\n        \n        # Should return 0.0 as expected\n        assert result.score == 0.0\nCritical Details: Add the test case at the end of the test file. Use the exact same formatting as existing test cases. Include both test cases with more retrieved documents and fewer retrieved documents to verify the fix works in both scenarios.\n\n### Step 8: Verify all existing tests pass\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/test_metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle test verification\nLocation: Run all tests\nAction: Run\nBefore Code: [none - run tests]\nAfter Code: [none - run tests]\nCritical Details: Run the complete test suite to ensure no regressions. The fix should not break any existing functionality. All existing tests should pass.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_1 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

This led to inaccurate normalization and scoring behavior, particularly in cases where the number of relevant documents differed from the number of retrieved documents. A previous fix attempt did not address this underlying issue.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe fix redefines the IDCG calculation to iterate over the number of expected relevant documents, aligning with standard definitions of NDCG. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The NDCG metric incorrectly computes the ideal DCG (IDCG) by using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids)) instead of the total number of expected relevant documents. This leads to inaccurate normalization, especially when the number of retrieved documents differs from the number of expected relevant documents. The fix must align with standard NDCG definitions.\n\nGoal: Correct the IDCG calculation to use the number of expected relevant documents (len(expected_ids)) rather than the minimum of retrieved and expected documents, ensuring accurate normalization and scoring.\n\nRequirements:\n- The IDCG must be computed based on the number of expected relevant documents\n- The change must preserve existing behavior for edge cases (e.g., no relevant documents)\n- The fix must maintain backward compatibility with existing code\n- The implementation must be consistent with standard NDCG mathematical definition\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared - I own the IDCG calculation logic, you own the graded relevance enhancement\nOther Agent Handles: Adding support for graded relevance scores and custom relevance scoring\nShared File Strategy: We will coordinate on the NDCG class in metrics.py. I will modify the IDCG calculation, and you will implement the graded relevance feature. We will ensure our changes don't interfere by using different sections of the code.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The NDCG metric is a subclass of BaseRetrievalMetric in the retrieval evaluation module. The fix involves modifying the compute method to correctly calculate IDCG.\nCritical Notes: Must preserve the existing edge case handling for idcg == 0. Must maintain the same function signature and return type. Must not modify the dcg calculation logic. Must use the same discounted_gain helper function.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Modify IDCG calculation to use expected relevant document count\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 380-386\nLocation: Line 380 (after the dcg calculation)\nAction: Replace\nBefore Code:\n        # Calculate IDCG using min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        # Since we can't achieve better than perfect ranking of all relevant docs\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\nAfter Code:\n        # Calculate IDCG using the number of expected relevant documents\n        # This represents the perfect ranking of all relevant documents\n        ideal_length = len(expected_ids)\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\nCritical Details: Keep the same indentation and formatting.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Communicate using 'openhands_comm_send' to prevent merge conflicts (messages from others appear automatically as \"[Inter-agent message]\")\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n</COLLABORATION>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory.

Instead:\n  - Always modify the original file directly when making changes\n  - If you need to create a temporary file for testing, delete it once you've confirmed your solution works\n  - If you decide a file you created is no longer useful, delete it instead of creating a new version\n* Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"command": {"description": "The commands to run.

This allows for more nuanced assessments of ranked retrieval results by reflecting varying degrees of importance among retrieved items. Users can now compute NDCG using float relevance scores rather than being restricted to binary relevance.\n\n**Technical Background**\nPreviously, the `NDCG` metric treated all relevant documents equally, assigning them a default score of 1.0. This binary treatment limited the expressiveness of the evaluation, especially in tasks where some documents are more relevant than others. Graded relevance is a standard extension in IR systems to address this limitation.\n\n**Solution**\nThe `compute` method in `NDCG` is extended to accept a new optional parameter: `relevance_scores`, a dictionary mapping `expected_ids` to float relevance values. During computation, these scores are used to calculate both discounted gains and ideal gains. If `relevance_scores` is not provided, the default binary behavior is preserved. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The NDCG metric currently only supports binary relevance (1.0 for relevant, 0.0 for irrelevant) and cannot handle graded relevance scores. This limits its ability to evaluate retrieval systems where documents have varying degrees of relevance.\n\nGoal: Enhance the NDCG metric to support graded relevance by allowing users to supply custom float-based relevance scores per expected_id, while preserving backward compatibility with binary relevance.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add a new optional `relevance_scores` parameter to the NDCG class and compute method\n- Support float-based relevance scores (e.g., 0.5 for partial relevance, 1.0 for full relevance)\n- Maintain backward compatibility: if `relevance_scores` is not provided, default to binary relevance (1.0 for relevant, 0.0 for irrelevant)\n- Update documentation to reflect the new functionality\n- Ensure the implementation works with both the current IDCG calculation and the other agent's proposed IDCG fix\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared - both agents will modify the same file\nOther Agent Handles: The other agent will implement the IDCG calculation fix (changing how ideal_length is calculated)\nShared File Strategy: I will implement the graded relevance feature in the compute method, while the other agent implements the IDCG fix. We will coordinate on the compute method to ensure compatibility. I will handle the relevance scoring logic, and the other agent will handle the ideal DCG calculation logic.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The NDCG class inherits from BaseRetrievalMetric and implements the compute method. The implementation will extend the existing compute method to accept a new parameter and modify the relevance scoring logic.\nCritical Notes: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code. The implementation must be compatible with the other agent's IDCG fix.

The new text must clearly explain both binary and graded relevance support.\n\n### Step 3: Update compute method to handle relevance_scores parameter\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 338-393\nLocation: Line 371 (after the mode assignment)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        mode = self.mode\n        expected_set = set(expected_ids)\n\n        # Calculate DCG\n        dcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=docid in expected_set, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, docid in enumerate(retrieved_ids, start=1)\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        mode = self.mode\n        expected_set = set(expected_ids)\n        relevance_scores = self.relevance_scores or {}\n\n        # Calculate DCG\n        dcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(\n                rel=relevance_scores.get(docid, 1.0 if docid in expected_set else 0.0),\n                i=i,\n                mode=mode\n            )\n            for i, docid in enumerate(retrieved_ids, start=1)\n        )\n```\nCritical Details: The implementation must handle both cases: when relevance_scores is provided (use the scores) and when it's not (fall back to binary relevance). The get() method with default values ensures backward compatibility.\n\n### Step 4: Update compute method to handle IDCG calculation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 380-386\nLocation: Line 382 (after the ideal_length assignment)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        # The other agent will implement the IDCG fix by changing how ideal_length is calculated\n        # For now, we keep the current implementation but ensure compatibility\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\n```\nCritical Details: This is a placeholder to ensure compatibility with the other agent's implementation. The actual IDCG fix will be implemented by the other agent in their own step.\n\n### Step 5: Update the METRIC_REGISTRY to document the new functionality\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 468-469\nLocation: Line 468 (after the existing entry)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    \"ndcg\": NDCG,\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    \"ndcg\": NDCG,  # Supports both binary and graded relevance through relevance_scores parameter\n```\nCritical Details: Add the comment in the same format as other entries.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Add Support for Graded Relevance in NDCG Metric\n\n**Pull Request Details**\nThis PR enhances the `NDCG` retrieval evaluation metric to support graded relevance by allowing users to supply custom float-based relevance scores per `expected_id`.\n\n**Description**\nThe `NDCG` class now accepts an optional `relevance_scores` dictionary, enabling evaluation scenarios where expected document relevance is non-binary. This allows for more nuanced assessments of ranked retrieval results by reflecting varying degrees of importance among retrieved items. Users can now compute NDCG using float relevance scores rather than being restricted to binary relevance.\n\n**Technical Background**\nPreviously, the `NDCG` metric treated all relevant documents equally, assigning them a default score of 1.0. This binary treatment limited the expressiveness of the evaluation, especially in tasks where some documents are more relevant than others. Graded relevance is a standard extension in IR systems to address this limitation.\n\n**Solution**\nThe `compute` method in `NDCG` is extended to accept a new optional parameter: `relevance_scores`, a dictionary mapping `expected_ids` to float relevance values. During computation, these scores are used to calculate both discounted gains and ideal gains. If `relevance_scores` is not provided, the default binary behavior is preserved. \n\n**Files Modified**\n* `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The NDCG metric currently only supports binary relevance (1.0 for relevant, 0.0 for irrelevant) and cannot handle graded relevance scores. This limits its ability to evaluate retrieval systems where documents have varying degrees of relevance.\n\nGoal: Enhance the NDCG metric to support graded relevance by allowing users to supply custom float-based relevance scores per expected_id, while preserving backward compatibility with binary relevance.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add a new optional `relevance_scores` parameter to the NDCG class and compute method\n- Support float-based relevance scores (e.g., 0.5 for partial relevance, 1.0 for full relevance)\n- Maintain backward compatibility: if `relevance_scores` is not provided, default to binary relevance (1.0 for relevant, 0.0 for irrelevant)\n- Update documentation to reflect the new functionality\n- Ensure the implementation works with both the current IDCG calculation and the other agent's proposed IDCG fix\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: Shared - both agents will modify the same file\nOther Agent Handles: The other agent will implement the IDCG calculation fix (changing how ideal_length is calculated)\nShared File Strategy: I will implement the graded relevance feature in the compute method, while the other agent implements the IDCG fix. We will coordinate on the compute method to ensure compatibility. I will handle the relevance scoring logic, and the other agent will handle the ideal DCG calculation logic.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The NDCG class inherits from BaseRetrievalMetric and implements the compute method. The implementation will extend the existing compute method to accept a new parameter and modify the relevance scoring logic.\nCritical Notes: Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code. The implementation must be compatible with the other agent's IDCG fix. Must update the docstring to document the new parameter and functionality.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Add relevance_scores parameter to NDCG class\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 335-337\nLocation: Line 336 (after the mode field)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    mode: DiscountedGainMode = \"linear\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    mode: DiscountedGainMode = \"linear\"\n    relevance_scores: Optional[Dict[str, float]] = None\n```\nCritical Details: Use the exact same formatting as the mode field. The parameter must be optional and default to None.\n\n### Step 2: Update NDCG class docstring to document new functionality\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 320-330\nLocation: Line 327 (after the existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    Currently only supports binary relevance\n    (``rel=1`` if document is in ``expected_ids``, otherwise ``rel=0``)\n    since we assume that ``expected_ids`` is unordered.\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    Currently supports both binary and graded relevance.\n    - For binary relevance: ``rel=1`` if document is in ``expected_ids``, otherwise ``rel=0``\n    - For graded relevance: use the ``relevance_scores`` parameter to specify custom float scores for each expected_id\n    since we assume that ``expected_ids`` is unordered.\n```\nCritical Details: Maintain the same indentation and formatting as the original docstring. The new text must clearly explain both binary and graded relevance support.\n\n### Step 3: Update compute method to handle relevance_scores parameter\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 338-393\nLocation: Line 371 (after the mode assignment)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        mode = self.mode\n        expected_set = set(expected_ids)\n\n        # Calculate DCG\n        dcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=docid in expected_set, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i, docid in enumerate(retrieved_ids, start=1)\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        mode = self.mode\n        expected_set = set(expected_ids)\n        relevance_scores = self.relevance_scores or {}\n\n        # Calculate DCG\n        dcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(\n                rel=relevance_scores.get(docid, 1.0 if docid in expected_set else 0.0),\n                i=i,\n                mode=mode\n            )\n            for i, docid in enumerate(retrieved_ids, start=1)\n        )\n```\nCritical Details: The implementation must handle both cases: when relevance_scores is provided (use the scores) and when it's not (fall back to binary relevance). The get() method with default values ensures backward compatibility.\n\n### Step 4: Update compute method to handle IDCG calculation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 380-386\nLocation: Line 382 (after the ideal_length assignment)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        # The other agent will implement the IDCG fix by changing how ideal_length is calculated\n        # For now, we keep the current implementation but ensure compatibility\n        ideal_length = min(len(retrieved_ids), len(expected_ids))\n        idcg = sum(\n            discounted_gain(rel=True, i=i, mode=mode)\n            for i in range(1, ideal_length + 1)\n        )\n```\nCritical Details: This is a placeholder to ensure compatibility with the other agent's implementation. The actual IDCG fix will be implemented by the other agent in their own step.\n\n### Step 5: Update the METRIC_REGISTRY to document the new functionality\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 468-469\nLocation: Line 468 (after the existing entry)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    \"ndcg\": NDCG,\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    \"ndcg\": NDCG,  # Supports both binary and graded relevance through relevance_scores parameter\n```\nCritical Details: Add the comment in the same format as other entries.

If not provided, binary relevance is used (1.0 for relevant, 0.0 for irrelevant).\n```\nCritical Details: Add the parameter documentation in the same format as other parameters. The description must clearly explain the purpose and behavior of the parameter.\n\n### Step 8: Update the compute method's return value documentation\nFile: `llama-index-core/llama_index/core/evaluation/retrieval/metrics.py`\nOwnership: Shared - I handle lines 338-393\nLocation: Line 360 (after the existing docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        Returns:\n            RetrievalMetricResult: The result with the computed NDCG score.
