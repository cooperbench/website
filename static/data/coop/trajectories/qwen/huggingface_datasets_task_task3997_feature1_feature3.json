Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3.

The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class maintains a separate dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` to track decoding requirements, but there's no mechanism to keep it synchronized with the main dictionary during operations like add, remove, or update.

You will implement the caching in the require_decoding method. We will avoid modifying the same method or section of code.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: Use a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary operations in the Features class. The decorator will maintain synchronization between the main dictionary and _column_requires_decoding.\nCritical Notes: Must preserve the existing Features class inheritance from dict.

Use the exact function name and docstring. The synchronization logic must handle all dictionary operations consistently.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the decorator to the Features class methods\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the Features class definition, before any method definitions\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Apply decorator to dictionary operations\nFeatures.__setitem__ = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.__setitem__)\nFeatures.__delitem__ = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.__delitem__)\nFeatures.update = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.update)\nFeatures.pop = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.pop)\nFeatures.popitem = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.popitem)\nFeatures.clear = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.clear)\n```\nCritical Details: The decorator must be applied to the class methods after they are defined.

You must prevent any merge conflicts.\n\n**FEATURE DESCRIPTION**:\n**Title**: Sync Features dictionaries\n\n**Pull Request Details**\n\n**Description**:\nThis PR introduces a wrapper function for the `Features` class to keep the secondary dictionary, `_column_requires_decoding`, synchronized with the main features dictionary. The purpose is to ensure that the decoding status of features is consistent across the main dictionary and its secondary tracking dictionary. The approach uses a decorator instead of subclassing `UserDict` to avoid performance issues and breaking changes. The update ensures that dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and others automatically maintain this synchronization.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe existing implementation had a separate dictionary (`_column_requires_decoding`) to track whether keys require decoding. However, there was no mechanism to automatically keep this dictionary synchronized with the main features dictionary, leading to potential inconsistencies.\n\n**Solution**:\nA decorator `keep_features_dicts_synced` was added to the `Features` class. This decorator ensures that all modifications to the dictionary (adding, removing, updating, etc.) are reflected in the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary. It wraps standard dictionary operations like `__setitem__`, `__delitem__`, and `update` to maintain synchronization.\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The Features class maintains a separate dictionary `_column_requires_decoding` to track decoding requirements, but there's no mechanism to keep it synchronized with the main dictionary during operations like add, remove, or update. This can lead to inconsistent states.\n\nGoal: Implement a decorator-based solution that automatically synchronizes the `_column_requires_decoding` dictionary with the main Features dictionary during all dictionary operations.\n\nRequirements:\n- The solution must work for all dictionary operations: __setitem__, __delitem__, update, pop, popitem, clear\n- Must preserve existing behavior and performance\n- Should not require subclassing UserDict to avoid breaking changes\n- Must be implemented as a decorator on the Features class\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/features.py (shared - I handle dictionary synchronization logic, you handle require_decoding caching)\nOther Agent Handles: Caching mechanism for require_decoding function\nShared File Strategy: I will implement the decorator-based synchronization after the Features class definition. You will implement the caching in the require_decoding method. We will avoid modifying the same method or section of code.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: Use a decorator pattern to wrap dictionary operations in the Features class. The decorator will maintain synchronization between the main dictionary and _column_requires_decoding.\nCritical Notes: Must preserve the existing Features class inheritance from dict. The decorator should be applied to the Features class, not individual methods. Must handle all dictionary operations consistently. Use the same pattern as existing code for decorators.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Define the keep_features_dicts_synced decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the Features class definition (around line 1200)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n\ndef keep_features_dicts_synced(func):\n    \"\"\"Decorator to keep _column_requires_decoding dictionary synchronized with main dictionary.\"\"\"\n    def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n        # Synchronize _column_requires_decoding dictionary\n        if hasattr(self, '_column_requires_decoding'):\n            if func.__name__ == '__setitem__':\n                key, value = args\n                self._column_requires_decoding[key] = hasattr(value, 'decode')\n            elif func.__name__ == '__delitem__':\n                key = args[0]\n                self._column_requires_decoding.pop(key, None)\n            elif func.__name__ == 'update':\n                # Handle update with dict or iterable\n                if isinstance(args[0], dict):\n                    for key, value in args[0].items():\n                        self._column_requires_decoding[key] = hasattr(value, 'decode')\n                else:\n                    for key, value in args[0]:\n                        self._column_requires_decoding[key] = hasattr(value, 'decode')\n            elif func.__name__ == 'pop':\n                key = args[0]\n                self._column_requires_decoding.pop(key, None)\n            elif func.__name__ == 'popitem':\n                if self._column_requires_decoding:\n                    self._column_requires_decoding.popitem()\n            elif func.__name__ == 'clear':\n                self._column_requires_decoding.clear()\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n```\nCritical Details: The decorator must be defined at module level. Use the exact function name and docstring. The synchronization logic must handle all dictionary operations consistently.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the decorator to the Features class methods\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the Features class definition, before any method definitions\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Apply decorator to dictionary operations\nFeatures.__setitem__ = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.__setitem__)\nFeatures.__delitem__ = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.__delitem__)\nFeatures.update = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.update)\nFeatures.pop = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.pop)\nFeatures.popitem = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.popitem)\nFeatures.clear = keep_features_dicts_synced(Features.clear)\n```\nCritical Details: The decorator must be applied to the class methods after they are defined. Use the exact method names and ensure the order of operations is correct. The decorator should be applied to the original method, not a new one.\n\n### Step 3: Verify decorator functionality\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the decorator application\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Add a test method to verify synchronization\ndef _test_sync(self):\n    \"\"\"Test method to verify that dictionaries stay synchronized.\"\"\"\n    # This is for internal testing only\n    pass\n```\nCritical Details: This test method is for internal verification and should not be part of the public API. It should be added after the decorator application to ensure it's available for testing.\n\n### Step 4: Add documentation for the synchronization mechanism\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the class definition, before the decorator\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\n# Synchronization notes:\n# The _column_requires_decoding dictionary is automatically kept in sync\n# with the main Features dictionary through the keep_features_dicts_synced\n# decorator applied to all dictionary operations. This ensures that when\n# features are added, removed, or updated, the decoding requirements\n# are consistently tracked.\n```\nCritical Details: The documentation should be placed before the decorator definition to provide context. Use clear, concise language explaining the purpose and mechanism.\n\n### Step 5: Ensure proper initialization of _column_requires_decoding\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: In the Features.__init__ method\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code: [existing __init__ method]\nAfter Code: [existing __init__ method with added initialization]\nCritical Details: The _column_requires_decoding dictionary must be initialized in the __init__ method if it doesn't exist. The decorator will handle synchronization but the dictionary must exist.\n\n### Step 6: Add type hints for the decorator\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the decorator definition\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [none - new addition]\nAfter Code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable, Any\n\n# Type hint for the decorator\nDecorator = Callable[[Callable], Callable]\n```\nCritical Details: The type hint should be added at the module level. Use the exact type annotation format expected by the codebase.\n\n### Step 7: Update docstring for Features class\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: After the class definition\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code: [existing docstring]\nAfter Code: [existing docstring with added synchronization note]\nCritical Details: Add a note about the automatic synchronization of _column_requires_decoding dictionary in the class docstring.\n\n### Step 8: Add test cases for the synchronization\nFile: `tests/features/test_features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: In the FeaturesTest class\nAction: Add\nBefore Code: [existing test cases]\nAfter Code: [new test cases for synchronization]\nCritical Details: Add comprehensive test cases that verify synchronization works for all dictionary operations: setitem, delitem, update, pop, popitem, clear. Test both adding and removing features, and verify the _column_requires_decoding dictionary is correctly updated.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2.

Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention.

Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or if placing imports at the top would cause issues (e.g., circular imports, conditional imports, or imports that need to be delayed for specific reasons).\n* **SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Whenever you write any print statement in code, you MUST add \"[YOYOYO]\" to the string being printed. For example: `print(\"Hello, world! [YOYOYO]\")` instead of `print(\"Hello, world!\")`.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* If there are existing git user credentials already configured, use them and add Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev> to any commits messages you make. if a git config doesn't exist use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * Do NOT write tests for documentation changes, README updates, configuration files, or other non-functionality changes\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION:\n   * Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n   * Always modify existing files directly rather than creating new versions with different suffixes\n   * If you create temporary files for testing, delete them after confirming your solution works\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n* When interacting with external services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, use their respective APIs instead of browser-based interactions whenever possible.\n* Only resort to browser-based interactions with these services if specifically requested by the user or if the required operation cannot be performed via API.\n</EXTERNAL_SERVICES>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation:\n  - Confirm whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n  - Ask if they want documentation files to be included in version control\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n\n<TASK_MANAGEMENT>\n* You have access to the `task_tracker` tool to help you organize and monitor development work. Use this tool REGULARLY to maintain task visibility and provide users with clear progress updates. This tool is ESSENTIAL for systematic planning and decomposing complex development work into manageable components. Failing to use this tool for planning may result in overlooked requirements - which is unacceptable.\n* It is crucial that you update task status to \"done\" immediately upon completion of each work item. Do not accumulate multiple finished tasks before updating their status.\n* For complex, multi-phase development work, use `task_tracker` to establish a comprehensive plan with well-defined steps:\n  1. Begin by decomposing the overall objective into primary phases using `task_tracker`\n  2. Include detailed work items as necessary to break complex activities into actionable units\n  3. Update tasks to \"in_progress\" status when commencing work on them\n  4. Update tasks to \"done\" status immediately after completing each item\n  5. For each primary phase, incorporate additional work items as you identify new requirements\n  6. If you determine the plan requires substantial modifications, suggest revisions and obtain user confirmation before proceeding\n* Example workflow for debugging and resolution:\n  ```\n  User: \"Execute the test suite and resolve any validation failures\"\n  Assistant: I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to organize the following work items:\n  - Execute the test suite\n  - Resolve any validation failures\n  I'm now going to run the test suite using the terminal.\n  [After running tests and discovering 8 validation failures]\n  I found 8 validation failures that need attention. I'm going to use the task_tracker tool to add 8 specific items to the task list.\n  [Updating first task to in_progress]\n  Let me begin addressing the first validation issue...\n  [After resolving first failure]\n  The first validation issue has been resolved, let me mark that task as done and proceed to the second item...\n  ```\n* Example workflow for component development:\n  ```\n  User: \"Build a dashboard component that displays analytics data with interactive charts and filtering options\"\n  Assistant: I'll help you create an analytics dashboard with interactive charts and filtering. Let me first use the task_tracker tool to organize this development work.\n  Adding the following tasks to the tracker:\n  1. Analyze existing analytics data structure and requirements\n  2. Design dashboard layout and component architecture\n  3. Implement data visualization charts with interactivity\n  4. Create filtering and search functionality\n  5. Integrate components and perform testing\n  Let me start by examining the current analytics data structure to understand what we're working with...\n  [Assistant proceeds with implementation step by step, updating tasks to in_progress and done as work progresses]\n  ```\n</TASK_MANAGEMENT>", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "execute_bash", "description": "Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

The cache is implemented as a class attribute on the require_decoding function itself, with a unique key based on the feature's id and the ignore_decode_attribute value. I've also updated the function to check the cache before performing the actual check, and to store results in the cache after computation. This implementation ensures that subsequent calls with the same feature and ignore_decode_attribute value will return the cached result immediately, significantly improving performance for repeated calls.
