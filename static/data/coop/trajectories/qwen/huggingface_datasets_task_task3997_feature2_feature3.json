Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform.

Multi-phase development work - When projects involve multiple sequential or\n   parallel activities\n2. Complex implementation tasks - Work requiring systematic planning and\n   coordination across multiple components\n3. Explicit user request for task organization - When users specifically ask\n   for structured task management\n4. Multiple concurrent requirements - When users present several work items\n   that need coordination\n5. Project initiation - Capture and organize user requirements at project start\n6. Work commencement - Update task status to in_progress before beginning\n   implementation. Maintain focus by limiting active work to one task\n7. Task completion - Update status to done and identify any additional work\n   that emerged during implementation\n\n## Situations Where Tool Usage Is Unnecessary\n\nAvoid using this tool when:\n\n1. Single atomic tasks that require no decomposition\n2. Trivial operations where tracking adds no organizational value\n3. Simple activities completable in minimal steps\n4. Pure information exchange or discussion\n\nNote: For single straightforward tasks, proceed with direct implementation\nrather than creating tracking overhead.\n\n## Usage Scenarios\n\n**Scenario A: Feature Development with Validation**\nUser request: \"Build a user authentication system with login/logout functionality.\nDon't forget to include input validation and error handling!\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll implement a user authentication system with comprehensive\nvalidation. Let me organize this work systematically.\n\n*Task breakdown includes:*\n1. Design authentication API endpoints and data models\n2. Implement user login/logout controllers with session management\n3. Add client-side form validation and error display\n4. Create backend input sanitization and security checks\n5. Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases\n6. Perform integration testing and fix any issues\n\n**Scenario B: Codebase Refactoring**\nUser request: \"I need to update all instances of the method 'fetchData' to\n'retrieveInformation' throughout the entire project\"\n\nResponse approach: Let me first analyze your codebase to identify all locations\nwhere 'fetchData' appears.\n\n*After code analysis*\n\nI've located 12 occurrences of 'fetchData' across 6 files in your project.\nI'll create a systematic plan to update these references.\n\n*Organized task list includes specific file-by-file updates*\n\n**Scenario C: Multi-feature Development**\nUser request: \"Set up a blog platform with these components: admin dashboard,\narticle management, comment system, and user profiles.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll help build your blog platform. Let me break down these\ncomponents into manageable implementation phases.\n\n*Creates structured plan with each feature decomposed into specific development tasks*\n\n## Counter-examples - Direct Implementation Preferred\n\n**Counter-example A: Simple inquiry**\nUser request: \"What's the syntax for a for loop in JavaScript?\"\n\nResponse approach: Here's how to write a for loop in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n```\n\n*No task tracking needed - single informational response*\n\n**Counter-example B: Minor modification**\nUser request: \"Please add a docstring to the processPayment function explaining\nits parameters.\"\n\nResponse approach: I'll add a docstring to explain the processPayment function.\n\n*Direct edit without task tracking for simple modification*\n\n## Status Management and Workflow\n\n1. **Status Values**: Track work using these states:\n   - todo: Not yet initiated\n   - in_progress: Currently active (maintain single focus)\n   - done: Successfully completed\n\n2. **Workflow Practices**:\n   - Update status dynamically as work progresses\n   - Mark completion immediately upon task finish\n   - Limit active work to ONE task at any given time\n   - Complete current activities before initiating new ones\n   - Remove obsolete tasks from tracking entirely\n\n3. **Completion Criteria**:\n   - Mark tasks as done only when fully achieved\n   - Keep status as in_progress if errors, blocks, or partial completion exist\n   - Create new tasks for discovered issues or dependencies\n   - Never mark done when:\n       - Test suites are failing\n       - Implementation remains incomplete\n       - Unresolved errors persist\n       - Required resources are unavailable\n\n4. **Task Organization**:\n   - Write precise, actionable descriptions\n   - Decompose complex work into manageable units\n   - Use descriptive, clear naming conventions\n\nWhen uncertain, favor using this tool.

The change is backward compatible.\nCritical Notes: Must maintain existing type hints and docstring format. The custom_criteria parameter should be optional and have a default value of None. The function must handle nested features correctly. The implementation should not introduce performance regressions.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Extend require_decoding function with custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1181 (after function definition)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature: The feature to check.\n        ignore_decode_attribute: Whether to ignore the decode attribute of the feature.\n\n    Returns:\n        Whether the feature requires decoding.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False, custom_criteria: Optional[Callable[[FeatureType, Dict[str, Any]], bool]] = None) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature: The feature to check.\n        ignore_decode_attribute: Whether to ignore the decode attribute of the feature.\n        custom_criteria: Optional callable that takes a feature and metadata dictionary and returns True if the feature requires decoding.\n            This allows for custom decoding logic based on metadata or feature-specific properties.\n\n    Returns:\n        Whether the feature requires decoding.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter with proper type hint and docstring. Keep existing parameters in the same order. Use Optional[Callable] type hint for custom_criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Add custom criteria check in require_decoding function\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1187 (after the docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    if custom_criteria is not None:\n        # Check custom criteria first\n        if custom_criteria(feature, getattr(feature, \"_metadata\", {})):\n            return True\n\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f, ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria) for f in feature.values())\n```\nCritical Details: The custom_criteria check must be performed before the existing logic. Use getattr to safely access _metadata attribute. Pass the custom_criteria parameter recursively to nested calls.\n\n### Step 3: Update nested feature handling to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1192 (in dict handling)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f, ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria) for f in feature.values())\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to recursive calls. Maintain the same indentation and formatting as the original code.\n\n### Step 4: Update list/tuple handling to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1194 (in list/tuple handling)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0], ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria)\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to the recursive call. Maintain the same formatting and indentation.\n\n### Step 5: Update Sequence handling to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1196 (in Sequence handling)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature, ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria)\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to the recursive call. Maintain the same formatting and indentation.\n\n### Step 6: Update else clause to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1198 (in else clause)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True) or (custom_criteria is not None and custom_criteria(feature, getattr(feature, \"_metadata\", {})))\n```\nCritical Details: The custom_criteria check must be performed in the else clause as well. Use logical OR to combine the existing condition with the custom criteria check. Use getattr to safely access _metadata attribute.\n\n### Step 7: Update Features class initialization to pass custom_criteria\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1237 (in _column_requires_decoding initialization)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature, custom_criteria=feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None)) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nCritical Details: Use feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None) to retrieve custom criteria from feature metadata. This allows features to define their own custom decoding logic in their metadata.\n\n### Step 8: Update Features class __setitem__ method to pass custom_criteria\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1242 (in __setitem__ method)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature, custom_criteria=feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None))\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to require_decoding. Use feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None) to retrieve custom criteria from feature metadata. Maintain the same indentation and formatting.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1. Implement the feature according to the plan\n2. You can communicate with the other agent using MCP tools:\n   - openhands_comm_send: Send messages to the other agent\n   - Messages from the other agent will appear automatically as '[Inter-agent message]'\n3. Coordinate to avoid conflicts by specifying exact file paths and line numbers\n4. Complete the implementation\n\n**COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:\n* Before modifying any file, inform the other agent of the EXACT file path and line numbers you're changing (e.g., \"I'm modifying src/logic/createFormControl.ts lines 1100-1140\")\n* Share your implementation approach early with specific line ranges so both agents can coordinate\n* If the other agent reports working on the same file, discuss who modifies which specific line ranges to avoid conflicts\n* NEVER use insertion markers or comments like \"// [handleSubmit:onFinally] other agent inserts\" - these cause merge conflicts\n* Instead, coordinate by dividing the file into non-overlapping sections with specific line ranges\n* Before you stop or complete your work, you MUST send a final status update message to the other agent summarizing what you've implemented\n\n**MERGE CONFLICT PREVENTION**:\n* Think of this as two developers working on separate branches that will be merged together\n* Any overlapping changes to the same lines will cause merge conflicts\n* Coordinate line-by-line to ensure no overlap in your modifications\n\nWork directory: /workspace", "action": "message", "args": {"content": "You are agent_2 working on the following feature in parallel with another agent.\n\n**SCENARIO**: You are working on separate branches implementing different features, but your implementations will be tested by 2-way merging both branches to main.

The implementation should not introduce performance regressions.\n\n## STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION\n\n### Step 1: Extend require_decoding function with custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1181 (after function definition)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature: The feature to check.\n        ignore_decode_attribute: Whether to ignore the decode attribute of the feature.\n\n    Returns:\n        Whether the feature requires decoding.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\ndef require_decoding(feature: FeatureType, ignore_decode_attribute: bool = False, custom_criteria: Optional[Callable[[FeatureType, Dict[str, Any]], bool]] = None) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a (possibly nested) feature requires decoding.\n\n    Args:\n        feature: The feature to check.\n        ignore_decode_attribute: Whether to ignore the decode attribute of the feature.\n        custom_criteria: Optional callable that takes a feature and metadata dictionary and returns True if the feature requires decoding.\n            This allows for custom decoding logic based on metadata or feature-specific properties.\n\n    Returns:\n        Whether the feature requires decoding.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nCritical Details: Add the new parameter with proper type hint and docstring. Keep existing parameters in the same order. Use Optional[Callable] type hint for custom_criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Add custom criteria check in require_decoding function\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1187 (after the docstring)\nAction: Add\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    if custom_criteria is not None:\n        # Check custom criteria first\n        if custom_criteria(feature, getattr(feature, \"_metadata\", {})):\n            return True\n\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f, ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria) for f in feature.values())\n```\nCritical Details: The custom_criteria check must be performed before the existing logic. Use getattr to safely access _metadata attribute. Pass the custom_criteria parameter recursively to nested calls.\n\n### Step 3: Update nested feature handling to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1192 (in dict handling)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f) for f in feature.values())\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    if isinstance(feature, dict):\n        return any(require_decoding(f, ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria) for f in feature.values())\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to recursive calls. Maintain the same indentation and formatting as the original code.\n\n### Step 4: Update list/tuple handling to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1194 (in list/tuple handling)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0])\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, (list, tuple)):\n        return require_decoding(feature[0], ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria)\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to the recursive call. Maintain the same formatting and indentation.\n\n### Step 5: Update Sequence handling to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1196 (in Sequence handling)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    elif isinstance(feature, Sequence):\n        return require_decoding(feature.feature, ignore_decode_attribute, custom_criteria)\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to the recursive call. Maintain the same formatting and indentation.\n\n### Step 6: Update else clause to pass custom_criteria parameter\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1198 (in else clause)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n    else:\n        return hasattr(feature, \"decode_example\") and (feature.decode if not ignore_decode_attribute else True) or (custom_criteria is not None and custom_criteria(feature, getattr(feature, \"_metadata\", {})))\n```\nCritical Details: The custom_criteria check must be performed in the else clause as well. Use logical OR to combine the existing condition with the custom criteria check. Use getattr to safely access _metadata attribute.\n\n### Step 7: Update Features class initialization to pass custom_criteria\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1237 (in _column_requires_decoding initialization)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding: Dict[str, bool] = {\n            col: require_decoding(feature, custom_criteria=feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None)) for col, feature in self.items()\n        }\n```\nCritical Details: Use feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None) to retrieve custom criteria from feature metadata. This allows features to define their own custom decoding logic in their metadata.\n\n### Step 8: Update Features class __setitem__ method to pass custom_criteria\nFile: `src/datasets/features/features.py`\nOwnership: I own entirely\nLocation: Line 1242 (in __setitem__ method)\nAction: Modify\nBefore Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature)\n```\nAfter Code:\n```python\n        self._column_requires_decoding[column_name] = require_decoding(feature, custom_criteria=feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None))\n```\nCritical Details: Pass the custom_criteria parameter to require_decoding. Use feature.get(\"_custom_decoding_criteria\", None) to retrieve custom criteria from feature metadata. Maintain the same indentation and formatting.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\n1.

The enhancement allows for more flexible control over the decoding process, enabling users to define their own conditions for whether a feature requires decoding.\n\n**Technical Background**:\n**Problem**:\nThe current `require_decoding` function only uses predefined rules to determine whether a feature requires decoding, limiting customization for complex datasets.\n\n**Solution**:\nA new extension to `require_decoding` allows users to define custom decoding conditions, using metadata or specific feature properties. This is implemented without disrupting the existing functionality of the `Features` class.\n\n**Files Modified**\n- `src/datasets/features/features.py`\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**:\n## Plan\n\n# FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n## CONTEXT\nProblem: The current `require_decoding` function only uses predefined rules to determine whether a feature requires decoding, limiting customization for complex datasets. This prevents users from defining their own conditions based on metadata or feature-specific logic.\n\nGoal: Extend the `require_decoding` function to support custom decoding criteria while maintaining backward compatibility and alignment with the `Features` class.\n\nRequirements:\n- Add a new `custom_criteria` parameter to `require_decoding` that accepts a callable function\n- The custom criteria function should receive the feature and metadata as arguments\n- Maintain existing behavior when no custom criteria is provided\n- Ensure the function works with nested features (dict, list, Sequence)\n- Document the new parameter in docstring\n- Preserve performance by not adding unnecessary overhead\n\n## COORDINATION NOTES\nFile Ownership: src/datasets/features/features.py (shared - I handle lines 1181-1245, you handle cache implementation in Features class)\nOther Agent Handles: Caching mechanism for require_decoding function\nShared File Strategy: I will modify the require_decoding function and related code. You will implement caching in the Features class. We will coordinate on line positioning to avoid conflicts.\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\nArchitecture: The solution extends the existing `require_decoding` function by adding a new parameter that allows custom logic while preserving the original behavior. The change is backward compatible.\nCritical Notes: Must maintain existing type hints and docstring format. The custom_criteria parameter should be optional and have a default value of None. The function must handle nested features correctly.
