        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn t1 = 0.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. And (6,4) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: only one segment at (3,3). That means the snake is just the head, no body yet. So length is 1.\n\nSnake head direction is L, which is left. So currently facing left.\n\nFood positions with life span and value:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 10, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food has value +1, so no negative food mentioned. Life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, there's no body to collide with except itself, but with length 1, moving anywhere except into a wall should be fine, as long as I don't hit the wall.\n\nThe head direction is L, so I just moved left to (3,3)? Positions are given as [(3,3)], so it's at (3,3) facing left. Since it's the only segment, moving in any direction except right (which would be opposite, but since no body, it might be allowed? Let's check the rules.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L (left), so I cannot move right on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n\nBut since there's only head, moving right would be into the cell where the tail was, but there is no tail; it's just one cell. The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But here, no tail, so moving opposite might be possible? I need to clarify.\n\nThe no instant reverse rule applies regardless of snake length. It says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So since current direction is L, I cannot move R on turn t1.\n\nSimilarly, for future turns.\n\nNow, my goal is to maximize score by eating food, but prioritize long-term survival. Think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince snake length is 1, eating positive food will increase length to 2. Then I have to be careful not to collide with myself.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under snake body, but here, snake is at (3,3), and food are at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6), none of which are under the snake, so no issue.\n\nTail reward danger: only when head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food. But here, no tail, so not applicable.\n\nNow, available moves from (3,3): U, D, L, R, but cannot move R because current direction is L, and R is opposite.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so cannot move right.\n\nAlso, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So from (3,3):\n\n- Up: (3,4) – y=4, which is not 0 or 7, x=3 not 0 or 7, and no internal wall there. Internal obstacle is (6,4), not (3,4). So (3,4) is free.\n\n- Down: (3,2) – similarly, free.\n\n- Left: (2,3) – x=2, not border, y=3, not border, free.\n\n- Right: (4,3) – but cannot move right because opposite direction.\n\nAlso, (4,3) is within bounds, but cannot due to direction.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6).\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5\n\n(2,2) at x=2,y=2\n\n(6,6) at x=6,y=6\n\nSnake at (3,3).\n\nTo reach (2,5): from (3,3), need to go left to (2,3), then up to (2,4), then to (2,5). Or up to (3,4), then left to (2,4), then up to (2,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,2): left to (2,3), then down to (2,2). Or down to (3,2), then left to (2,2).\n\nTo (6,6): that's far, need to go right and up, but cannot go right immediately.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (6,4), which is on the way to (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid for reference.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacle at (6,4), which is within x=1-6, y=1-6, so (6,4) is blocked.\n\nSo free cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (6,4) is wall.\n\nNow snake at (3,3).\n\nFood at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6).\n\nAll food has life span 10, so they will disappear after turn 10, but since current turn is 0, they last until after turn 10? Life span decreases each turn, including current.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present on turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, turn 0, life span 10, so present on turns 0,1,2,...,9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since all have life span 10, and turn 0, I have 10 turns to eat them, but I might eat sooner.\n\nNow, I need to eat to grow, but carefully.\n\nSince snake is small, I can go for nearest food.\n\nLet's find distances.\n\nTo (2,5): Manhattan distance |3-2| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (2,2): |3-2| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nTo (6,6): |3-6| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo (2,2) is closest, distance 2.\n\n(2,5) is 3, (6,6) is 6.\n\nAlso, (2,2) can be reached in 2 moves: for example, left to (2,3), then down to (2,2). Or down to (3,2), then left to (2,2).\n\nBut current position (3,3), head direction left.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3)\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I am at (2,3), and head direction now left? I moved left, so direction becomes L.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,2) down, or (2,4) up, or (1,3) left, or (3,3) right, but (3,3) is where I was, but since snake was only head, after moving, the tail moves, but no tail, so (3,3) is empty now.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), snake position is [(2,3)], length 1, no body.\n\nThen I can move down to (2,2) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I first move down to (3,2), then left to (2,2).\n\nBut with direction constraint.\n\nCurrent turn t=0, direction L.\n\nMove options: U, D, L (not R).\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then at t=1, position (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move D to (2,2) to eat the food at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has food, so moving to (2,2) would eat it.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D first to (3,2), then at (3,2), direction down, then move L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nBut (2,2) is food, so in both cases, I can reach it in 2 moves.\n\nBut let's see which one is better.\n\nFirst, need to consider the direction after eating.\n\nAlso, after eating, I have a body, so need to avoid colliding.\n\nMoreover, other food to consider.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, let's simulate.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nThen turn 0: action L, to (2,3)\n\nSnake now at [(2,3)], direction L.\n\nFood still at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6), life spans decrease to 9? Turn is now 1? Let's keep track of turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=0.\n\nAfter action, for the next state.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=0, so I need to output for turn 0, turn 1, turn 2, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably plan for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the output should show actions for several turns.\n\nI think I should plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps start with moving towards (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is close, but after eating, I have a body at (2,3) or wherever.\n\nLet's detail.\n\nIf at turn 0, I move L to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 1: I can move to (2,2) to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), snake grows to length 2: positions [(2,2), (2,3)]? When I move to (2,2), head is at (2,2), and the previous position was (2,3), but since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes [(2,2), (2,3)] with head at (2,2), tail at (2,3).\n\nDirection: I moved down to (2,2), so direction is D.\n\nNow, at turn 1, after action, snake at [(2,2), (2,3)], head direction D.\n\nNow, from here, I need to move. Possible moves: from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), but (2,3) is my body, so if I go up, head to (2,3), which has body, so collision, die.\n\nCannot go U.\n\nD to (2,1): but y=1, is it wall? Border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall, should be free.\n\nx=2, y=1: x=2 between 1-6, y=1, which is not 0 or 7, so free. No internal wall, so (2,1) is free.\n\nL to (1,2): x=1, y=2, should be free.\n\nR to (3,2): x=3, y=2, free.\n\nBut current direction is D (down), so I cannot move U, because U is opposite to D.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so cannot move U.\n\nBut moving U would be to (2,3), which is body, so anyway die, but even if not, cannot due to direction.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\nNow, at (2,2), there was food, but I ate it, so no food there anymore.\n\nOther food: (2,5) and (6,6).\n\n(2,5) is at same x, y=5.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go up, but I cannot because of body or direction.\n\ny=5 is up, but I have body at (2,3), so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, go left to (1,2), then up, etc.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), I am at (2,2) with body at (2,3), so the cell (2,3) is body, so I cannot go back up immediately.\n\nI must move away.\n\nSimilarly, if I had taken the other path.\n\nAlternative: at turn 0, instead of moving L, I move D to (3,2).\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen snake at [(3,2)], direction D.\n\nThen turn 1: move L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)], head at (2,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, body at (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so cannot.\n\nAlso, current direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,3) is free? Currently, no body or wall, should be free.\n\nD to (2,1) free, L to (1,2) free.\n\nNow, food at (2,5), which is up from here.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), then to (2,4), then to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut when I go to (2,3), is there body? After eating at (2,2), positions are [(2,2), (3,2)], so (2,3) is empty.\n\nThen moving to (2,3) is fine.\n\nThen from there to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut let's compare the two scenarios.\n\nFirst scenario: after moving L then D, I have snake vertical at (2,2) and (2,3), head down at (2,2), so I can only move L, R, or D, not U.\n\nSecond scenario: after moving D then L, I have snake at (2,2) and (3,2), head left at (2,2), so I can move U, D, L.\n\nIn second case, I have more options; I can go up towards (2,5).\n\nWhereas in first case, I cannot go up directly; I have to go down or left/right first.\n\nSo second approach seems better for future movement.\n\nMoreover, (2,5) is food, so I can head there.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is another food, but farther.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince t1=0, I should start from turn 0.\n\nPlan to eat (2,2) first, then (2,5), then maybe (6,6) if possible.\n\nBut (6,6) has obstacle at (6,4), so need to go around.\n\nFirst, let's go with the second option for turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 1: move L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 1, after action, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)], head direction L.\n\nNow turn 2: I want to go towards (2,5). So from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3).\n\nThen snake moves: head to (2,3), tail moves from (3,2) to? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, but since I didn't eat, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 2, before action, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)], head (2,2).\n\nI move U to (2,3).\n\nNow, (2,3) was empty, so no eat, so snake: head to (2,3), and the body segment (2,2) becomes new body, and tail (3,2) is removed? Positions: after move, head at (2,3), and the previous head (2,2) is now body, so snake becomes [(2,3), (2,2)].\n\nThe segments: original positions: index 0: head (2,2), index 1: body (3,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), the new head is (2,3), and the body is the previous head (2,2), and the tail (3,2) is gone, since no growth.\n\nSo snake positions: [(2,3), (2,2)]\n\nHead direction: I moved up, so direction U.\n\nNow, from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), to get closer to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is food.\n\nMove U to (2,4).\n\nThen snake: head to (2,4), body at (2,3), positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\n(2,5) has food, so when I move to (2,5), I eat it, so snake grows: head at (2,5), and tail stays, so positions: head (2,5), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, and (2,3) is still body, so [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, I ate two food, score +2.\n\nNow, next food at (6,6).\n\nBut I am at (2,5), need to go to (6,6).\n\nThere is an obstacle at (6,4).\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nNow, from (2,5), I need to go right and down or something.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), which is near the obstacle.\n\nx=6,y=6, but (6,4) is wall, so I can go to (6,5) or (6,6) if accessible.\n\ny=6 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's playable.\n\nSimilarly x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall.\n\nSo (6,6) is free, except if there is food, which there is.\n\nBut to reach (6,6) from (2,5), I need a path.\n\nFor example, go right to (3,5), (4,5), etc., but need to avoid (6,4).\n\nSince (6,4) is wall, I cannot go there, so to reach (6,6), I can go to (5,6) or (6,5) first.\n\n(6,5) is above (6,4), which is wall, so (6,5) should be free, then to (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) to (6,6).\n\nNow, from (2,5), I can go R to (3,5), then to (4,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I have a body at (2,4) and (2,3), so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,6) has life span, but since I started turn 0, after eating two food, it might be turn 3 or so.\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2)  // from (3,3) to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) eat food, now at [(2,2),(3,2)] dir L\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3)  // to (2,3), positions [(2,3),(2,2)] dir U\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,4)  // to (2,4), positions [(2,4),(2,3)] dir U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5) eat food, now at [(2,5),(2,4),(2,3)] dir U\n\nNow at turn 4, snake at (2,5), with body at (2,4) and (2,3), so vertical.\n\nFrom here, to go to (6,6), I need to move right.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, cannot, L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nD is down, opposite to U, so cannot move D anyway.\n\nPossible: U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,6): y=6, which is not wall, free.\n\nL to (1,5): x=1, free.\n\nR to (3,5): free.\n\nNow, (2,6) is up, but (6,6) is to the right, so probably go right.\n\nBut if I go U to (2,6), then I am at top, might be cornered.\n\nSimilarly, L to (1,5) left.\n\nR to (3,5) right.\n\nThen I can continue right.\n\nBut I need to reach (6,6).\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (6,4), so from the right, I need to go to (6,6) from above or below, but below is (6,4) wall, so must from left or above.\n\n(6,5) is available, then to (6,6).\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5.\n\nFrom my position, I can go to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,6).\n\n(6,5) is not wall, only (6,4) is wall.\n\nSo path: from (2,5) to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n(6,5) to (6,6) is up.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 4, I am at (2,5), dir U.\n\nI move R to (3,5).\n\nThen positions: head to (3,5), body: previous head (2,5) becomes body, and (2,4) becomes next, (2,3) tail. So [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]? Positions: after move, head at (3,5), then the segments: previous head (2,5) is now body, and before that was (2,4) and (2,3). When head moves, the tail moves forward only if no growth, so tail (2,3) is removed, and new body is (2,5), with head (3,5), and body (2,4)? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions: index 0: (2,5) head, index 1: (2,4), index 2: (2,3) tail.\n\nMove head to (3,5). Since no eat, tail moves: so new head at (3,5), new body segments: the previous head becomes body, so (2,5) is now body, and (2,4) is still body, and (2,3) is removed. So positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nHead direction R (right).\n\nNow, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (6,6), which is not directly on the way.\n\n(6,6) is at y=6, I am at y=5.\n\nSo I need to go up at some point.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) or (5,5), I can go up to (4,6) or (5,6), then right to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) from (5,6) or (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at y=5, same row.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\nFood at (6,6) has life span 10, from turn 0, so present until turn 9.\n\nCurrent turn after eating second food: at turn 4 I ate, so now turn 5? Let's list actions.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2)  // at (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) eat, now at [(2,2),(3,2)] dir L\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3)  // at (2,3), positions [(2,3),(2,2)] dir U\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,4)  // at (2,4), positions [(2,4),(2,3)] dir U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5) eat, now at [(2,5),(2,4),(2,3)] dir U\n\nNow turn 5: from (2,5), move R to (3,5)  // no eat, positions [(3,5),(2,5),(2,4)] dir R\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)  // positions [(4,5),(3,5),(2,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)  // positions [(5,5),(4,5),(3,5)] dir R\n\nNow at (5,5), I need to go to (6,6). I can move U to (5,6), or R to (6,5), or D to (5,4), etc.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), then R to (6,6).\n\nOr R to (6,5), then U to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,5) is available.\n\nAlso, direction: current dir R.\n\nSo from (5,5), move U to (5,6): not opposite, U is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nOr move R to (6,5), also ok.\n\nNow, to reach (6,6), moving U to (5,6) then R to (6,6) might be better.\n\nTurn 7: at (5,5), move U to (5,6)\n\nThen positions: head to (5,6), body: (5,5) and (4,5), tail (3,5)? Before move: positions [(5,5),(4,5),(3,5)]\n\nMove head to (5,6), no eat, so new head (5,6), body (5,5), and (4,5), tail (3,5) removed? Segments: after move, head at (5,6), previous head (5,5) becomes body, and (4,5) is still body, (3,5) removed. So [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDir U.\n\nThen turn 8: move R to (6,6) to eat.\n\n(6,6) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nPositions: head at (6,6), and since eat, tail doesn't move, so body: (5,6) and (5,5) and (4,5), so [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDir R.\n\nNow I ate all three food, score +3.\n\nBut is this safe? At (6,6), and there is wall at (6,4), but I am at (6,6).\n\nNow, after that, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can just move around.\n\nBut the life span of food was 10, and I ate at turn 8, which is before turn 10, so ok.\n\nBut in this path, I used 8 turns to eat all food.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn 0, I moved D to (3,2).\n\nBut current head direction is L, and I moved D, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 1, moved L to (2,2), eat.\n\nThen turn 2, moved U to (2,3), no issue.\n\nTurn 3, U to (2,4), ok.\n\nTurn 4, U to (2,5), eat.\n\nTurn 5, R to (3,5), ok.\n\nTurn 6, R to (4,5), ok.\n\nTurn 7, at (5,5), I moved U to (5,6), but is (5,6) free? Yes.\n\nThen turn 8, move R to (6,6), eat.\n\nNow, from (5,6) to (6,6) is right, and dir was U, but moving R is perpendicular, not opposite, so ok.\n\nNow, after that, snake has length 4, at [(6,6),(5,6),(5,5),(4,5)]\n\nHead at (6,6), dir R.\n\nNow, I can move, but no food, so I need to avoid walls and body.\n\nFor example, possible moves: from (6,6), U to (6,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,5): free.\n\nL to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, cannot.\n\nR to (7,6) but x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nCurrent dir R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nSo only possible move D to (6,5).\n\nMove to (6,5), no food, so snake moves: head to (6,5), body: (6,6) becomes body, (5,6) body, (5,5) tail? Positions: before move, [(6,6),(5,6),(5,5),(4,5)]\n\nAfter move head to (6,5), no eat, so new head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), and tail (5,5)? Segments: new head (6,5), previous head (6,6) now body, (5,6) body, and (5,5) body, but since no growth, the last segment is removed? Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: new head at (6,5), then the segment that was head becomes the first body, so (6,6) is now first body, then (5,6) was body, still there, (5,5) was next, and (4,5) was tail, removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nLength 3, since tail removed? No: after moving without eating, snake length remains same, but tail moves.\n\nIn this case, from length 4, after move no eat, positions: head new position, then the first body is previous head, second body is previous first body, and the tail segment is removed, so length decreases? No.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake occupies one less cell temporarily? No.\n\nPositions: let's say at time t, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to new head position H', the new positions are [H', H, B1, B2, ...] and the last position, which was T, is removed, so the snake has the same length, but shifted.\n\nIn terms of cells: the head moves to H', each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is left.\n\nBut the number of segments remains the same; it's just that the tail moves to what was the second last.\n\nFor example: positions [A, B, C, D] with A head, D tail.\n\nMove head to E.\n\nThen new positions: head E, then A becomes body, B becomes next body, C becomes tail. D is removed.\n\nSo [E, A, B, C] if length 4.\n\nSimilarly, in my case: before move at (6,6): positions [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] so H=(6,6), B1=(5,6), B2=(5,5), T=(4,5)\n\nMove to (6,5), new head H'=(6,5)\n\nThen new positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] and (4,5) removed.\n\nB2 was (5,5), which becomes tail, and T (4,5) gone.\n\nSo now [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? New head (6,5), then previous head (6,6) is now body, then B1 (5,6) is next body, B2 (5,5) is now tail.\n\nSo positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)] but (5,5) is tail.\n\nNow, body at (6,6), (5,6), (5,5).\n\nThen I can move, but no food.\n\nBut back to the point.\n\nIn my plan, I ate all food by turn 8.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nPerhaps I could go for (6,6) earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, instead of going down, go left or up.\n\nBut (2,2) is closer.\n\nSuppose at turn 0, I move L to (2,3).\n\nThen at (2,3), dir L.\n\nThen turn 1, I can move D to (2,2) to eat, same as before.\n\nOr move U to (2,4) towards (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is farther, and (2,2) is close, so better to eat (2,2) first.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) first.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)  // from (3,3) to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (2,4)  // to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat, now at [(2,5),(2,4)]? After eat: head at (2,5), body at (2,4), since previous head (2,4) becomes body, and tail was? After move to (2,5), from previous [(2,4),(2,3)]? Turn 0: after move to (2,3), positions [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4), no eat, positions [(2,4),(2,3)]  // head (2,4), body (2,3)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat, so head to (2,5), and since eat, tail stays, so positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), and (2,3) still, so [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nDir U.\n\nThen from here, (2,2) is below, but I have body at (2,3) and (2,4), so to reach (2,2), I need to go down, but (2,3) is body, so cannot go directly down from (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move L or R or U.\n\nIf move D, but direction U, cannot move D opposite.\n\nAnd (2,4) is below, body, cannot.\n\nSo must move L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n\nThen I can go down to (1,4) or something, but to reach (2,2), it's messy.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,5), then D to (3,4), etc., but (2,2) is at (2,2), which might be hard to reach with body blocking.\n\nWhereas in my first plan, I ate (2,2) first when snake small, then went up.\n\nSo better to eat (2,2) first.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle: at (6,4), which I avoided by going to (6,5) and (6,6) from above.\n\nIn my plan, I went to (5,5), then (5,6), then (6,6).\n\n(5,6) is at y=6, which is not wall.\n\nBut y=6 is playable, since walls are y=0 and y=7.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is fine.\n\nNow, life span: food at (6,6) eaten at turn 8, life span 10, so present until turn 9, so turn 8 is fine.\n\nSimilarly others eaten earlier.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=0.\n\nIn my plan, I have actions up to turn 8.\n\nBut I don't need to output all, perhaps until I eat or something.\n\nBut it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so output for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output the sequence.\n\nBut in the state, there is also food at (2,5) and (2,2), both positive.\n\nIn my plan, I ate all.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with fewer moves or safer.\n\nAnother option: at turn 0, I could go towards (6,6), but it's far, and I might not reach in time or miss closer food.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I cannot go right immediately, so must go left, up, or down.\n\nIf go up to (3,4), then to (3,5), etc., but (2,2) is close and might disappear if not eaten, but life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut eating early allows me to grow, which might help with survival, but in this case, since grid is small, growing might increase risk.\n\nBut I need to eat to score.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nNow, in my sequence, at turn 0, move D.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction: current head direction L, I move D, which is down, not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 1, move L to (2,2) eat.\n\nBut after moving to (3,2) at turn 0, direction is D.\n\nThen move L to (2,2), which is left, not opposite to D, so ok.\n\nThen turn 2, move U to (2,3), from (2,2) with direction L, moving U is perpendicular, ok.\n\nSimilarly all moves seem fine.\n\nNow for the answer, I think I should output the actions.\n\nBut the format is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 0: action\n\nTurn 1: action\n\n...\n\n}\n\nAnd actions in {U, D, L, R}\n\nIn my case:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nBut turn 7 is at (5,5) move U to (5,6), turn 8 move R to (6,6).\n\nBut after that, I don't need to output, but since the snake might continue, but for the purpose, I can stop after eating all food or after 5 turns.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nIn 5 turns: from turn 0 to turn 4.\n\nIn my plan, by turn 4, I have eaten (2,5), at position (2,5) with body.\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: L (eat (2,2))\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U (eat (2,5))\n\nSo by turn 4, I ate two food.\n\nThen for turn 5: R to (3,5)\n\nBut if I output only up to turn 4, that might be ok.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating the third food is good.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output the sequence I have.\n\nPerhaps I should include until I eat all or something.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, when I move to (3,2) at turn 0, is there food? No, food at (2,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) has no food.\n\nThen turn 1 to (2,2) eat.\n\nNow, in the state, food at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6), all positive.\n\nIs there negative food? Not mentioned, so all positive.\n\nNow, I think my plan is fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (6,6) earlier or differently.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I go up or something.\n\nBut (6,6) is far, and I have to go around the obstacle.\n\nSuppose at turn 0, move U to (3,4)\n\nThen at (3,4), dir U.\n\nThen turn 1, move U to (3,5) or L to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is closer south, so not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, going left to (2,3), then down to (2,2) is better.\n\nSo I think my initial plan is good.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U  // now at (2,5) with body\n\nThen to continue to (6,6), but for output, I can do 5 turns or more.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but for output, it might be up to me.\n\nSince it says \"maximize score\", and I have a plan to eat all, I should output the sequence to eat all.\n\nPerhaps output until turn 8.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nIt says \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"each action\"\n\nI think I can output from turn 0 to say turn 5 or so.\n\nTo be safe, let's output 5 actions: turns 0 to 4.\n\nThen I ate two food.\n\nBut I can eat the third.\n\nSince the snake can survive after, but for now.\n\nAnother point: in the movement, when I go to eat (6,6), at (5,6), I moved to (6,6), which is fine.\n\nBut at (6,6), after eating, I have to move down to (6,5), as I said.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is a risk with the obstacle.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,5) before, but in my plan, I went directly.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output the actions as per my plan for multiple turns.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that ensures the snake eats all available positive food (at (2,2), (2,5), and (6,6)) within their life spans (10 turns each, starting from turn 0). The strategy involves:\n- First eating the closest food at (2,2) to grow the snake early, which allows more flexibility for future moves.\n- Then moving to eat (2,5), leveraging the snake's position.\n- Finally navigating to (6,6) while avoiding the internal obstacle at (6,4) and walls.\n\nKey considerations:\n- **Current snake state**: Head at (3,3), direction left (L), length 1. No immediate collision risks.\n- **Movement constraints**: Cannot reverse direction instantly (e.g., from L, cannot move R next).\n- **Food life spans**: All food disappears after turn 9 (present turns 0-9). The plan eats all by turn 8.\n- **Path safety**: Avoids dead ends, body collisions, and walls. After eating, the snake grows, so moves are planned to keep the body manageable.\n- **5+ turn lookahead**: The sequence is planned for 9 turns (turns 0-8) to eat all food and position for survival. Beyond turn 8, the snake can move safely in open areas.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 0-8)\n- **Turn 0**: Move D (down) to (3,2). Reason: Avoids moving opposite (R is illegal), positions to eat (2,2) next. (2,2) is the closest food (distance 2).\n- **Turn 1**: Move L (left) to (2,2). Eat positive food: snake grows to length 2, positions [(2,2), (3,2)], direction L.\n- **Turn 2**: Move U (up) to (2,3). Reason: Head to (2,3), no food, so tail moves. Positions [(2,3), (2,2)], direction U. Prepares to reach (2,5).\n- **Turn 3**: Move U (up) to (2,4). Reason: Head to (2,4), no food. Positions [(2,4), (2,3)], direction U. Moves toward (2,5).\n- **Turn 4**: Move U (up) to (2,5). Eat positive food: snake grows to length 3, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], direction U.\n- **Turn 5**: Move R (right) to (3,5). Reason: Head to (3,5), no food. Positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)], direction R. Avoids body and starts path to (6,6).\n- **Turn 6**: Move R (right) to (4,5). Reason: Head to (4,5), no food. Positions [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)], direction R. Continues right toward (6,6).\n- **Turn 7**: Move U (up) to (5,6). Reason: From (5,5) (reached via R on turn 6? Correction: After turn 6 at (4,5), move R to (5,5) is turn 7? Sequence error. **Revised for clarity**: \n  - Turn 6: Move R to (4,5) → positions [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)].\n  - Turn 7: Move R to (5,5) → positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], direction R. Then, to reach y=6 for (6,6), move U to (5,6) on turn 8? **Correction**: Path to (6,6) requires adjustment to avoid moving into body or walls. From (5,5), move U to (5,6) (safe, no body), then R to (6,6). So:\n  - Turn 7: Move R to (5,5). Positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], direction R.\n- **Turn 8**: Move U (up) to (5,6). Reason: Head to (5,6), no food. Positions [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)], direction U. Now adjacent to (6,6).\n- **Turn 9**: Move R (right) to (6,6). Eat positive food: snake grows to length 4, positions [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)], direction R.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Efficiency**: Eats (2,2) by turn 1, (2,5) by turn 4, and (6,6) by turn 8—all within life spans (≤ turn 8 < 10).\n- **Safety**: \n  - No body collisions: Moves avoid existing body segments (e.g., on turn 2, moving U from (2,2) to (2,3) is safe as (2,3) is empty).\n  - Wall/obstacle avoidance: Path steers clear of (6,4) and borders (e.g., to (6,6) via (5,6), not directly through obstacle).\n  - Direction constraints respected (e.g., no instant reverse; from L on turn 0, move D not R).\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 8, snake can move D to (6,5) to avoid walls and open space. Score maximized (+3) with minimal risk.\n\n**Output for turns 0-8 (9 actions):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: D\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: R\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\n**Note**: The sequence includes an extra move (turn 8: U to (5,6)) to reach (6,6) safely. For turn 9 (not output here), move R to (6,6) to eat the final food. This plan thinks 9 turns ahead, ensuring all food is eaten while prioritizing survival.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 1, and the snake is on the grid. The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\nSnake positions: only one position, (3,2). That means the snake is just the head right now, since it's only one segment. The head direction is down (D), so it's moving downwards.\n\nFood positions are given with coordinates, life span, and value. Let me list them:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 9, value 1\n\n- (2,2) with life span 9, value 1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 9, value 1\n\n- (2,1) with life span 10, value 1\n\nAll food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, eating food will increase its length to two. Also, with only one segment, there's no body to collide with except itself, but since it's just the head, moving onto its own position isn't possible because it would have to be there, but it's moving away.\n\nThe snake starts at (3,2) with direction D. So from (3,2), moving down would go to (3,1) since y decreases when moving down? Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement definitions: U (up) is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I assume. U (x,y+1) means moving up increases y, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I think. Let me see:\n\nU: (x,y+1) — up, y increases\n\nD: (x,y-1) — down, y decreases\n\nL: (x-1,y) — left, x decreases\n\nR: (x+1,y) — right, x increases\n\nSo, for example, from (3,2), moving down (D) would go to (3,1), since y decreases.\n\nNow, walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\nSnake at (3,2), direction D, so it's facing down.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is D, I cannot move directly opposite, which would be U, up. So I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right). But not U.\n\nNow, the food:\n\n- (2,5): value 1, life 9\n\n- (2,2): value 1, life 9\n\n- (6,6): value 1, life 9\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life 10\n\n(2,2) is at the same y as the snake but different x. Snake is at (3,2), so (2,2) is left of it.\n\n(2,1) is down and left, but since y decreases down, (2,1) is below (2,2).\n\n(2,5) is up and left.\n\n(6,6) is right and up.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,2) and moving down, if it continues down, it goes to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is not a food position, but (2,1) is food at (2,1), which is adjacent left-down.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But (0,y) and (7,y) for y=0 to 7, and (x,0) and (x,7) for x=0 to 7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\nSo cells: (6,4) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake at (3,2), direction D.\n\nPossible actions this turn (turn 1):\n\n- Continue down (D) to (3,1)\n\n- Turn left (L) to (2,2)\n\n- Turn right (R) to (4,2)\n\nCannot go up (U) because opposite direction.\n\nNow, (2,2) has food! Value 1, life span 9.\n\nIf I move left to (2,2), I eat the food there. Since the snake is only one segment, eating food will make it grow to two segments. After eating, the head moves to (2,2), and since it was one segment, the tail was at (3,2), but now after eating, the snake becomes two segments: head at (2,2), and tail at (3,2)? No.\n\nWhen the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and since it eats, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. But in this case, since it was only one segment, before moving, snake is at (3,2). After moving to (2,2) and eating, the snake becomes: head at (2,2), and the previous position becomes the tail, so snake positions: [(2,2), (3,2)].\n\nThen, on the next turn, when I move, the tail will move only if no food is eaten, but since I ate food, the tail stays, so the snake grows.\n\nGeneral rule: when you eat food, head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nHere, starting with one segment: at (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (2,2) and eat food, new head at (2,2), and since I ate, a new segment is added, so snake becomes two segments: head at (2,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), no food there, so head moves to (3,1), tail... but since only one segment, after moving to (3,1), snake is at (3,1), and the previous (3,2) is empty now. No tail to move since it was alone.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2).\n\nNow, back to turn 1 actions.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (3,1)\n\n- Position: (3,1), no food, so snake remains one segment at (3,1). Direction now D, since I moved down.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (2,2)\n\n- Position: (2,2), eat food! Value +1, snake grows to two segments: head at (2,2), tail at (3,2). Direction now L (since I moved left).\n\nOption 3: Move right to (4,2)\n\n- Position: (4,2), no food there, so snake at (4,2), one segment. Direction R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food life span: each turn, life span decreases by one, including current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor food at (2,2), life span 9, on turn 1, when I consider moving, if I move to it on turn 1, I eat it, so it disappears. If not, its life span decreases to 8 after turn 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for (2,2), if I don't eat it on turn 1, it might be eaten later or disappear.\n\nNow, since I need to maximize score, eating food is good, but I have to avoid risks.\n\nCurrently, with one segment, no body, so no collision risk except walls or obstacles.\n\nBut after growing, I have to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no food under snake yet.\n\nNow, let's plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, immediate: moving to (2,2) gives +1 score now.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (2,5) - up left\n\n- (2,2) - left, adjacent\n\n- (6,6) - far right up\n\n- (2,1) - down left\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is below (2,2).\n\nIf I move left to (2,2), I eat that food, and I'm at (2,2) with direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves: since direction now L, I cannot move R (right). Can move U (up to (2,3)), D (down to (2,1)), or L (left to (1,2)).\n\n(2,1) has food! So I could move down to (2,1) and eat that food immediately on turn 2.\n\n(2,1) food has value 1, life span 10.\n\nIf I do that, on turn 1: move L to (2,2), eat food, score +1, snake now [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2), direction L, I can move D to (2,1). (2,1) has food, so eat it, head to (2,1), new segment added, snake: head (2,1), then (2,2), then (3,2)? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 1: snake segments: head (2,2), tail (3,2)\n\nOn turn 2, move to (2,1): since (2,1) has food, head moves to (2,1), and since ate, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays, so segments: new head (2,1), then previous head (2,2), then tail (3,2). So positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nScore +1 again, total +2.\n\nThen direction now D.\n\nBut now, the snake has length 3, and body to avoid.\n\nAlso, (3,2) is the tail, and it will move when I don't eat food.\n\nNow, from (2,1), direction D, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut walls: y=0 is wall, (2,1) is y=1, so moving down to (2,0) is wall, cannot.\n\nx=0 is wall, left to (1,1) or (0,1) but (0,1) wall, (1,1) might be free.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells. Also (6,4) obstacle.\n\nSo (1,1) is free, since not border and not (6,4).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is left, but direction is D, so moving left is L, which is not opposite to D? Opposite to D is U, so I can move L, D, R, but D to (2,0) is wall, so not possible.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1) with direction D:\n\n- U (up): to (2,2), but (2,2) is part of body now! Since body segments are at (2,2) and (3,2), so moving to (2,2) would collide with body.\n\n- D (down): to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n\n- L (left): to (1,1), free? (1,1) not wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake is at (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), so (1,1) free.\n\n- R (right): to (3,1), free? (3,1) not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,1) was where I could have gone earlier.\n\nSo from (2,1), direction D, I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nCannot move U or D.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), no food there, so head moves to (1,1), tail moves to (2,2)? When no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent snake: positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), no food, so head moves to (1,1), tail moves to the next segment, which is (2,2), so new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), then (2,2)? Let's see the movement.\n\nThe body segments follow: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), snake: segment 0: (2,1) head, segment 1: (2,2), segment 2: (3,2) tail.\n\nIf I move to (1,1), no food, so head moves to (1,1), segment 1 moves to where head was, (2,1), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (2,2). So new positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2).\n\nSegments: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nDirection now L, since I moved left.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved R to (3,1), head to (3,1), body to (2,1), tail to (2,2), positions [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nBut back to the immediate choice.\n\nIf on turn 1 I move L to (2,2), eat food, then on turn 2 I can move D to (2,1), eat another food, so in two turns, I get two foods, score 2.\n\nBut then I'm at (2,1) with a snake of length 3, and I can only move left or right, since up is body and down is wall.\n\nNow, from (2,1), moving left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) has no food, (3,1) no food.\n\nThen, say I move to (1,1), then snake is [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nFrom (1,1), direction L, I can move U to (1,2), D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, so only possible U to (1,2) if free.\n\n(1,2) is free? Snake positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2). (1,2) not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo move U to (1,2), no food, so head to (1,2), body to (1,1), tail to (2,1)? Segments: after move, head (1,2), then previous head (1,1), then previous body (2,1), tail (2,1) but (2,2) was tail, when tail moves, it moves to where segment 1 was.\n\nCurrent before move: segments: 0: (1,1) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (2,2) tail.\n\nMove head to (1,2), no food, so new head: (1,2), segment 1 moves to (1,1), segment 2 moves to (2,1). So positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\nTail at (2,1).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), or L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2) but (2,2) is not body now? Current body: (1,1) and (2,1), (2,2) is free now.\n\n(2,2) was tail, but after moving, it's empty.\n\nSo from (1,2), move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2), or D to (1,1) body, cannot, or L wall.\n\nSo possible U or R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I have other food to consider, like (2,5) and (6,6).\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, which is up, x=2.\n\nCurrently, if I go to (2,2) and (2,1), I'm stuck near the bottom, and (2,5) is up, so I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is far.\n\nLife spans: all food has life span around 9 or 10, so they will disappear after 9 or 10 turns, but since we start turn 1, they decrease each turn.\n\nTurn 1: food life spans: (2,5):9, (2,2):9, (6,6):9, (2,1):10\n\nAfter turn 1, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n\nBut if eaten, gone.\n\nNow, back to turn 1 choice.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1) instead.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1), no food, snake at (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,1), direction D, possible moves: U opposite, cannot. D to (3,0) wall, cannot. L to (2,1), R to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) has food, (4,1) no food.\n\nSo I can move L to (2,1) and eat food, or R to (4,1).\n\nIf move L to (2,1), eat food, snake grows: head to (2,1), new segment, so snake: head (2,1), tail (3,1) since previously one segment.\n\nScore +1.\n\nThen direction L.\n\nFrom (2,1), as before, can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), but (3,1) is tail? Current snake: head (2,1), tail (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,1) would be moving to tail position. Is that allowed?\n\nThe rules: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nSo, moving to tail is safe, as long as after move, the head is not on the body except the tail which moves.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to tail cell, and tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (2,1) head, tail at (3,1), if I move R to (3,1), which is tail, and if I don't eat food there, head moves to (3,1), but (3,1) was tail, so when head moves to (3,1), tail moves to where? But (3,1) was occupied by tail, and head moves to it, but since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nBefore move: head at (2,1), tail at (3,1).\n\nI move head to (3,1). Since (3,1) has no food (assuming), head moves to (3,1), and tail moves to the next position, but there is no next, since only two segments? Snake positions: segment 0: head (2,1), segment 1: tail (3,1).\n\nWhen head moves to new position, say (3,1), which is the current tail position.\n\nSince no food eaten, the tail moves away: the tail segment is removed from (3,1), and head is placed at (3,1), so effectively, the snake moves, and since only two segments, after head moves to (3,1), the tail is gone? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no growth, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nWith two segments: positions: A (head), B (tail).\n\nMove head to new cell C.\n\nIf C is not food, then new head at C, new tail at A, so positions (C, A), and B is vacated.\n\nIn this case: head at (2,1), tail at (3,1).\n\nMove head to (3,1), which is current tail position.\n\nSince (3,1) has no food, head moves to (3,1), and the tail moves to where the head was, (2,1).\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,1), tail at (2,1).\n\nSo snake is now at (3,1) and (2,1), but since head moved to (3,1), which was tail, and tail moved to (2,1), so positions [(3,1), (2,1)].\n\nThen direction R, since I moved right.\n\nBut (2,1) is now tail, and (3,1) head.\n\nFrom there, I can move, etc.\n\nBut in this case, when I moved to (3,1) from (2,1), I didn't eat food, so no growth.\n\nBack to turn 1.\n\nAnother option: move right to (4,2) on turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2), no food, snake at (4,2), direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2), direction R, can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2), not L (opposite).\n\n(4,3) no food, (4,1) no food, (5,2) no food.\n\nSo no immediate food, but I can go towards (6,6) or (2,5).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is up-right.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut there's food at (2,5) and (2,2), (2,1) nearby.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is left and up from (3,2), but if I moved right, I'm at (4,2), so (2,2) is two left.\n\nLife span of (2,2) is 9, so it disappears after 9 turns, but on turn 1, if I don't eat, life becomes 8, then 7, etc.\n\nSince we start turn 1, and food appears at turn 1, I think, but not specified when it spawns, but it's given at turn 1, so it's present.\n\nTo maximize score, eating multiple food is good.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival and path.\n\nAlso, the grid is small, 8x8, with walls and obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), which might block the way to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), obstacle at (6,4), so I can go to (6,6) from (6,5) or (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's list all free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the distances.\n\nFrom current position (3,2):\n\n- To (2,2): distance 1, left\n\n- To (2,1): distance 2, down-left\n\n- To (2,5): distance 3 in y, |dy| =3, dx=1, so Manhattan dist 4\n\n- To (6,6): dx=3, dy=4, dist 7\n\nAlso, (2,1) has higher life span 10, others 9.\n\nBut all same value.\n\nNow, if I move to (2,2) on turn 1, I get +1 immediately, and then I can move to (2,1) on turn 2 for another +1, so in two turns, score 2.\n\nThen I'm at (2,1) with length 3.\n\nFrom there, I need to go up to get to (2,5), for example.\n\nFrom (2,1), after eating (2,1), I'm at (2,1) with body, as before.\n\nThen I can move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc.\n\nOr from (2,1), I could have moved right to (3,1), but no food.\n\nThen to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), so from (2,1) to (2,5), I need to go up along x=2, but at (2,2) is body if I ate the food there.\n\nIn the scenario where I ate (2,2) and (2,1), on turn 2 after eating both, snake is at [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nFrom (2,1), I can only move left or right, as up is body and down wall.\n\nSay move left to (1,1), no food, snake moves to [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (1,1), move up to (1,2), no food, to [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\nThen from (1,2), move up to (1,3), no food, to [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nThen to (1,4), etc, up to (1,5), then I can go to (2,5) from (1,5) or (2,4), but (2,5) is food.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which might be reachable.\n\nBut the snake body is along the left, so from (1,3), I can move right to (2,3) if free.\n\n(2,3) is free initially.\n\nFrom (1,2) in the sequence, after moving to (1,2), positions [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\nThen move to (1,3): head to (1,3), body to (1,2), tail to (1,1), positions [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nThen from (1,3), move to (1,4), to [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nThen to (1,5), to [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nNow at (1,5), direction U.\n\nCan move U to (1,6), D to (1,4) body, L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food! So move R to (2,5), eat food, head to (2,5), new segment, so positions: head (2,5), then previous head (1,5), then (1,4), then (1,3)? Segments: before move, snake [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nMove head to (2,5), eat food, so head to (2,5), and new segment added, so positions: new head (2,5), then (1,5), then (1,4), then (1,3) tail.\n\nLength 4.\n\nScore +1, total 3.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut this took several turns: turn 1: to (2,2), eat; turn 2: to (2,1), eat; turn 3: to (1,1); turn 4: to (1,2); turn 5: to (1,3); turn 6: to (1,4); turn 7: to (1,5); turn 8: to (2,5), eat. So on turn 8, I eat (2,5), but what is the life span of (2,5)? Initial life 9, decreases each turn.\n\nTurn 1: not eaten, life 8\n\nTurn 2: not eaten, life 7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8, if not eaten, life would be 9 - 7 = 2? Let's see:\n\nAt turn 1, food present, life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span L.\n\nAfter turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1.\n\nIf L-1 >0, it remains, else disappears.\n\nSimilarly, after each turn.\n\nFor (2,5) at turn 1, life span 9.\n\nAfter turn 1, if not eaten, life 8.\n\nAfter turn 2, life 7, and so on.\n\nIt disappears when life span reaches 0 after a turn.\n\nSo if life span S at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t to t+S-1, and disappears at turn t+S.\n\nHere, all food at turn 1 with life 9, so can be eaten on turns 1 to 9, disappears on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life 10, can be eaten turns 1 to 10, disappears turn 11.\n\nIn the above sequence, (2,5) is eaten on turn 8, which is within 1 to 9, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is far.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can head towards (6,6).\n\nBut there's obstacle at (6,4), so I need to go around.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother option on turn 1: move down to (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 2, move left to (2,1), eat food there.\n\nThen snake at [(2,1), (3,1)] or something.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1), no eat, snake at (3,1), dir D.\n\nTurn 2: move L to (2,1), eat food, snake grows: head to (2,1), new segment at previous position, so snake: head (2,1), tail (3,1), dir L.\n\nThen same as before, at (2,1) with body to (3,1), can move L to (1,1) or U to (2,2) or R to (3,1) tail.\n\n(2,2) has food, but is it safe to move to (2,2)?\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (3,1).\n\nMove U to (2,2): (2,2) has food, so I would eat it.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (3,1), not at (2,2), so no issue.\n\nMove to (2,2), eat food, head to (2,2), new segment, so positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), then (3,1) tail.\n\nScore +1 again.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move, etc.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (2,1) on turn 2, and (2,2) on turn 3, for example.\n\nBut (2,2) was eaten later, but it's the same food.\n\nIf I move directly to (2,2) on turn 1, I eat it earlier.\n\nThe score is the same, but the position might be different.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating on turn 1 vs turn 2 doesn't matter for score, as long as eaten.\n\nBut for survival, it might affect the path.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,6)? If I go to the left first, I might not reach (6,6) in time, since life span 9, disappears turn 10.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I go directly towards (6,6).\n\nFor example, turn 1: move R to (4,2), no eat.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,2), no eat (assuming no food).\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,3), etc, but to reach (6,6), I need to go up and right.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (6,6): dx=1, dy=4, dist 5, so at least 5 moves.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\n(6,4) is blocked, so I can't go directly to (6,5) or (6,3).\n\nTo go to (6,6), I can go to (5,6) or (6,5) or (7,6) but x=7 wall, so from (5,6) or (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is adjacent to (6,6), but (6,4) blocked, so (6,5) might be accessible from (5,5) or (6,6) from (5,6).\n\n(5,6) to (6,6) is possible.\n\nNow, from current (3,2) to (6,6), shortest path Manhattan dist |3-6| + |2-6| = 3+4=7, but with obstacle, might be longer.\n\nFor example: (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6), that's 6 moves, or (5,5) to (6,5) but (6,5) to (6,6) only if (6,5) accessible, but (6,4) blocked, so (6,5) can be reached from (5,5) or (6,6) from (5,6).\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) is possible, since (6,5) not blocked except if wall, but walls only border and (6,4), so (6,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) free.\n\nSo from (5,5) to (6,5), then (6,5) to (6,6).\n\nOr from (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6).\n\nEither way.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (6,6): one path: (3,2)->(4,2)->(5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(5,5)->(5,6)->(6,6) 7 moves.\n\nOr (4,2)->(4,3)->(4,4)->(4,5)->(5,5)->(5,6)->(6,6) also 7 moves.\n\nBut turn 1: from (3,2) to (4,2), turn 2 to (5,2), turn 3 to (5,3), turn 4 to (5,4), turn 5 to (5,5), turn 6 to (5,6), turn 7 to (6,6), eat on turn 7.\n\nLife span of (6,6) is 9, so on turn 7, it can be eaten, since disappears turn 10.\n\nTurn 1 to turn 7 is within 9 turns? At turn 1, life 9, after turn 1, life 8, ..., after turn 6, life 9-6=3, so on turn 7, before move, life span 3, I can eat it, then after turn 7, life decreases to 2, but I ate it, so gone.\n\nSo possible to eat (6,6) on turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to left first, I might not have time for (6,6).\n\nIn the left path, I ate (2,2) on turn 1, (2,1) on turn 2, then moved to (1,1) on turn 3, (1,2) turn 4, (1,3) turn 5, (1,4) turn 6, (1,5) turn 7, then (2,5) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (2,5), to go to (6,6), it's far, |2-6| + |5-6| =4+1=5 dist, but with body, it might take more turns, and (6,6) disappears on turn 10, so on turn 8, I can start moving, but turn 8 at (2,5), to (6,6), minimum 5 moves, so turn 9 to (3,5) or something, turn 10 to (4,5), etc, not reaching (6,6) by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, (6,6) life span: initial 9, after turn 1:8, turn2:7, ..., after turn 7:2, so on turn 8, life span 2, I can eat on turn 8 or 9.\n\nIf on turn 8 I'm at (2,5), I can move right to (3,5), then turn 9 to (4,5), not close to (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (2,5): (2,5)->(3,5)->(4,5)->(5,5)->(5,6)->(6,6) or (4,5)->(4,6)->(5,6)->(6,6), but (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6), etc, 5 moves.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,5) move to (3,5), turn 9 to (4,5), turn 10 to (5,5), turn 11 to (6,5) or (5,6), but (6,6) disappears on turn 10, meaning after turn 10 it is gone, so on turn 10, if I move to it, I can eat, but on turn 10 I'm at (5,5), not at (6,6).\n\nTurn 10: if I move to (6,6), but from (5,5) on turn 10, I can move to (5,6) or (6,5), not directly to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) to (6,6) is not adjacent, diagonal, not allowed, only horizontal or vertical.\n\nSo from (5,5) on turn 10, I can move to (6,5) or (5,6), then on turn 11 to (6,6), but on turn 11, (6,6) is gone, since disappeared after turn 10.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,6) if I go left first.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,2) and (2,1) first, I miss (6,6).\n\nBut I can choose not to go to (2,1) immediately.\n\nFor example, on turn 1, move to (2,2), eat, then from (2,2), instead of going down to (2,1), I can go up to (2,3) or left to (1,2), to head towards (2,5) or (6,6).\n\n(2,5) is closer.\n\nFrom (2,2), after eating, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)], direction L.\n\nThen I can move U to (2,3), for example.\n\n(2,3) no food, so head to (2,3), tail to (2,2)? Move: head to (2,3), no eat, so tail moves to where head was, (2,2), so positions [(2,3), (2,2)], tail at (2,2).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (2,3), move U to (2,4), no food, to [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nThen to (2,5), eat food, on turn 4, for example.\n\nTurn 1: to (2,2) eat\n\nTurn 2: to (2,3)\n\nTurn 3: to (2,4)\n\nTurn 4: to (2,5) eat\n\nScore 2.\n\nThen at (2,5) with length 3 or 4? After turn 4, snake: after eating (2,5), head at (2,5), body: before move, on turn 3, snake at [(2,4), (2,3)]? Let's track.\n\nTurn 1 start: snake at (3,2), move L to (2,2) eat, snake now [(2,2), (3,2)] with (2,2) head, (3,2) tail.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3), no food, head to (2,3), tail to (2,2), so positions [(2,3), (2,2)], tail at (2,2).\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,4), no food, head to (2,4), tail to (2,3), positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5), eat food, head to (2,5), new segment, so positions: head (2,5), then previous head (2,4), then (2,3) tail. Since ate, tail doesn't move, new segment at previous tail position? No.\n\nWhen eat food, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n\nBefore move, positions [(2,4), (2,3)] with head (2,4), tail (2,3).\n\nMove to (2,5), eat, so head moves to (2,5), new segment added at tail position (2,3), so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), then (2,3) new tail.\n\nSegments: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n\nLength 3.\n\nScore 2 so far.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go towards (6,6).\n\n(6,6) can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 4, to (6,6), dist |2-6| + |5-6| =4+1=5, so minimum 5 turns.\n\nTurn 5: to (3,5), turn 6: to (4,5), turn 7: to (5,5), turn 8: to (5,6), turn 9: to (6,6), eat on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, (6,6) life span: initial 9, after turn 1:8, turn2:7, turn3:6, turn4:5, turn5:4, turn6:3, turn7:2, so on turn 8, life 2, turn 9 life 1, I can eat on turn 9, before it disappears after turn 9? Disappears after turn 9, meaning after turn 9 it is gone, so on turn 9 I can still eat it if I move there.\n\nAfter turn 9, life decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo on turn 9, before move, life span 1, I move to it and eat, ok.\n\nSimilarly, here on turn 9 I eat (6,6), score +1, total 3.\n\nThen I have (2,1) with life 10, but (2,1) is far down, and I'm at (6,6), so not practical, and it might not be worth it.\n\nBut I can eat it if I go back, but time-consuming.\n\n(2,1) life 10, disappears turn 11.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (2,1), dist |6-2| + |6-1| =4+5=9, at least 9 turns, by turn 9+9=18, but turn 11 disappearance, too late.\n\nSo I can only eat up to 3 foods: (2,2), (2,5), (6,6) in this path.\n\n(2,1) is not reachable in time.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) first, but (2,5) might be missed.\n\nIn the first path where I ate both (2,2) and (2,1) early, I only got two foods, missed (6,6) and (2,5) if not eaten.\n\n(2,5) I could eat later, but in that path I ate it on turn 8, but missed (6,6).\n\nSo better to eat (2,2) and then go up to (2,5), then to (6,6).\n\nWhat about moving down to (3,1) first?\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1), no eat, snake at (3,1), dir D.\n\nThen turn 2: move L to (2,1), eat, snake at [(2,1), (3,1)], dir L.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), but (2,2) has food, so move to (2,2) eat, on turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,2) eat, snake: before move, head (2,1), tail (3,1).\n\nMove to (2,2) eat, head to (2,2), new segment at tail, so positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), then (3,1) tail.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr from (2,1), move left to (1,1), then up, but (2,2) food might be eaten later, but life span 9, so by turn 9.\n\nBut if I don't eat (2,2) on turn 3, it might be available later.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (2,1) on turn 2, (2,2) on turn 3, then I can go up to (2,5) as before, but from (2,2) on turn 3, to (2,5) on turn 6 or so, then to (6,6) on turn 10 or 11, but (6,6) disappears turn 10, so on turn 10 I can eat if I reach, but from (2,5) on turn 6, to (6,6) in 4 turns? Minimum 5, turn 7 to (3,5), turn 8 to (4,5), turn 9 to (5,5), turn 10 to (5,6) or (6,5), not (6,6), so cannot eat on turn 10, missed.\n\nSo only two foods.\n\nWhereas if I go directly to (2,2) then up to (2,5) without eating (2,1), I can eat three foods.\n\nBut (2,1) is not eaten, so I miss that point.\n\nBut (2,1) has value 1, same as others.\n\nTo maximize, eating three is better than two, so I should prioritize (2,2), (2,5), (6,6).\n\n(2,1) can be skipped if not convenient.\n\nIn the path to (6,6), I might have risks.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,6), I need to survive, but the game continues, I assume, but since no more food specified, or new food might spawn, but the problem doesn't say new food spawns, only the given food.\n\nThe state has these foods, and no mention of new food, so I think only these four foods.\n\nAfter they disappear, no food, so I need to eat as many as possible before they disappear.\n\nSo best to eat three: (2,2), (2,5), (6,6).\n\n(2,1) is isolated and might not be worth the detour.\n\nNow, back to turn 1.\n\nIf I move left to (2,2) on turn 1, eat, score +1.\n\nThen on turn 2, I should not go down to (2,1), but go up to (2,3) to head to (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1), if I went down, I can still go to (2,1) or not, but better not to.\n\nMove right to (4,2) on turn 1 is worse, because (2,2) might be missed or eaten later, but life span ok, but it delays.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move R to (4,2), then I need to go back to (2,2), which takes turns.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (2,2) is left 2 steps, but with direction, it might take more.\n\nTurn 1: to (4,2), dir R.\n\nTurn 2: can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2), not L.\n\nNone has food, say move U to (4,3), then turn 3 to (4,4), etc, but to go to (2,2), I need to go left, which might not be direct.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), but (2,2) is not close.\n\nIt would take more turns to reach (2,2), and it might disappear.\n\nFor instance, to go from (4,3) to (2,2): (4,3)->(3,3)->(3,2)->(2,2), but (3,2) might be occupied or not, but in this case, on turn 3, if I go to (3,3), turn 4 to (3,2), turn 5 to (2,2), eat on turn 5.\n\n(2,2) life span: at turn 5, life 9-4=5? After turn 1:8, turn2:7, turn3:6, turn4:5, so on turn 5, life 5, can eat.\n\nBut then I eat (2,2) on turn 5, later than turn 1, and I might miss other foods or have less time for (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) and (6,6) might be tight.\n\nSo better to eat (2,2) early on turn 1.\n\nTherefore, on turn 1, move left to (2,2) to eat the food.\n\nThen on turn 2, move up to (2,3) to head towards (2,5).\n\nNow, I need to specify actions for 5+ turns, but the answer format is to list actions for the next few turns, starting from turn 1.\n\nThe output should be:\n\nTurn 1: action\n\nTurn 2: action\n\n...\n\nFor at least the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut since I need to think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nAlso, for survival, after eating, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, with the snake growing, I have to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nIn this grid, with walls, and obstacle, I need a path.\n\nAfter eating (2,5) and (6,6), I can roam freely.\n\nBut let's outline the plan.\n\nTurn 1: Move L to (2,2)  // eat food\n\nNow snake at [(2,2), (3,2)] dir L\n\nTurn 2: Move U to (2,3)  // no food, head to (2,3), tail to (2,2), positions [(2,3), (2,2)] dir U\n\nTurn 3: Move U to (2,4)  // no food, head to (2,4), tail to (2,3), positions [(2,4), (2,3)] dir U\n\nTurn 4: Move U to (2,5)  // eat food, head to (2,5), new segment at (2,3), positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), then (2,3) tail. Dir U\n\nScore 2\n\nNow at (2,5), length 3.\n\nNow to go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move right towards (6,6).\n\nPossible moves: direction U, can move U to (2,6), but y=6, not wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, so (2,6) is free.\n\nD to (2,4) body, cannot.\n\nL to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nSo can move U, L, or R.\n\n(2,6) is up, (1,5) left, (3,5) right.\n\nTo go to (6,6), moving right is better.\n\nSo move R to (3,5).\n\nTurn 5: Move R to (3,5)  // no food, head to (3,5), body: before move, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nMove head to (3,5), no eat, so head to (3,5), segment 1 moves to (2,5), segment 2 moves to (2,4), tail at (2,4)? Positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), then (2,4) tail. Dir R\n\nNow at (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, cannot, R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) is body, so cannot move left.\n\nMove U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is closer to (6,6) in y, but x same.\n\n(6,6) is at x=6,y=6, so need to increase x.\n\nSo move R to (4,5).\n\nTurn 6: Move R to (4,5)  // no food, head to (4,5), body to (3,5), tail to (2,5)? Before move: positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nMove head to (4,5), no eat, so new positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5) tail. Dir R\n\nNow at (4,5), can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) body, cannot, R to (5,5).\n\nSo move R to (5,5).\n\nTurn 7: Move R to (5,5)  // no food, head to (5,5), body to (4,5), tail to (3,5). Positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] dir R\n\nNow at (5,5), can move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5) body, cannot, R to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is free, not wall.\n\nObstacle at (6,4), but (6,5) ok.\n\nMove to (6,5) or to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is also good, since (6,6) adjacent to both.\n\n(5,5) to (5,6) or to (6,5).\n\nThen to (6,6).\n\nSay move to (5,6) first.\n\nTurn 7: at (5,5), move U to (5,6)  // no food, head to (5,6), body to (5,5), tail to (4,5). Positions [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] dir U\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,6), can move U to (5,7), but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (5,5) body; L to (4,6); R to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) has food! So move R to (6,6) eat.\n\nTurn 8: Move R to (6,6) eat, head to (6,6), new segment, positions: before move, head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nMove to (6,6) eat, so head to (6,6), new segment added at tail position (4,5), so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), then (5,5), then (4,5) tail. Length 4.\n\nScore 3.\n\nNow, (2,1) is still there, but life 10, disappears turn 11.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (2,1) is far, |6-2| + |6-1| =4+5=9, and I have body, so at least 9 turns, by turn 8+9=17, but turn 11 disappearance, so on turn 11, I need to be at (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut from (6,6) on turn 8, to (2,1) in 3 turns? Impossible, minimum 9 moves, so cannot reach in time. Thus, (2,1) will not be eaten.\n\nBut that's fine, since we have three foods.\n\nNow, after turn 8, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can just move around without dying.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), I can move to safe cells.\n\nBut since the output is for actions, I need to specify only for a few turns, but the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" and output the actions starting from turn 1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nHere t1=1, so I should list actions for turn 1,2,3,... for several turns.\n\nBut how many? At least 5, I think.\n\nIn this plan, I have up to turn 8.\n\nBut for the output, I can list the first few actions, as long as I think ahead.\n\nSince the snake will move, I need to specify the sequence.\n\nBut for turn 1, I must choose action.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent.\n\nIn the above, I have a plan.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle: at (6,4), which I avoided since I went to (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6), not passing (6,4).\n\nIn the move to (6,5), but I went to (5,6) first.\n\nBut in turn 7, at (5,5), I could move to (6,5) instead.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,5) move R to (6,5) // no food, head to (6,5), body to (5,5), tail to (4,5). Positions [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] dir R\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,5), can move U to (6,6) eat, or D to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, cannot; L to (5,5) body; R to (7,5) wall.\n\nSo only move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to output for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 2, I moved to (2,3), but is there any risk?\n\nAlso, initially, direction: after turn 1 move L, direction is L.\n\nTurn 2 move U, which is not opposite, ok.\n\nThen to (2,3), no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nNow, what about the food at (2,1)? I didn't eat it, but it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body: but in this case, no food under snake initially.\n\nSo the plan is good.\n\nNow for the output, I need to list actions starting from turn 1.\n\nSince I need to specify multiple turns, but the game continues, I can list for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the format, it should be for the turns as needed.\n\nPerhaps I can list the actions for the first 5 turns based on the plan.\n\nTurn 1: Move L to (2,2) eat\n\nTurn 2: Move U to (2,3) no eat\n\nTurn 3: Move U to (2,4) no eat\n\nTurn 4: Move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 5: Move R to (3,5) no eat\n\nEtc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 5 or 6.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should have actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn is 1, so up to turn 6 or so.\n\nIn the plan, turn 1 to 5: L, U, U, U, R\n\nBut on turn 4, move to (2,5), which is correct.\n\nNow, to confirm the direction constraints.\n\nStart: head at (3,2), dir D.\n\nTurn 1: move L, which is allowed, not opposite (opposite is U).\n\nAfter move, head at (2,2), dir L.\n\nTurn 2: move U, not opposite to L (opposite is R), so ok.\n\nAfter move to (2,3), dir U.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,4), same dir, ok.\n\nAfter, dir U.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5), ok.\n\nAfter, dir U.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), dir U, move R to (3,5). Moving right, not opposite to U (opposite is D), so allowed.\n\nAfter, dir R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think this is solid.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nBut I can add more if needed, but for the box, it should be fine.\n\nThe format says to list the actions for the turns.\n\nAlso, for turn 1, it must be one of U/D/L/R.\n\nIn this case, L.\n\nNow, to be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (2,2) on turn 1, as it is adjacent and provides an immediate score increase. From there, the plan is to navigate towards (2,5) to eat another food, and then proceed to (6,6) for the third food, avoiding the internal obstacle at (6,4) and walls. The food at (2,1) is not prioritized due to its location and the risk of missing (6,6) within its life span. The sequence below is derived from thinking 5+ turns ahead, ensuring no collisions and efficient pathing.\n\n- **Turn 1**: Move left (L) to (2,2) to eat the food there. This increases the score by 1 and grows the snake to length 2. Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to (2,3). No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (2,3), tail at (2,2). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to (2,4). No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (2,4), tail at (2,3). Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to (2,5) to eat the food there. Score increases to 2. Snake grows to length 3: head at (2,5), body at (2,4), tail at (2,3). Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 5**: Move right (R) to (3,5). No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (3,5), body at (2,5), tail at (2,4). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 6**: Move right (R) to (4,5). No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (4,5), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5). Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (5,5). No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5). Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to (5,6). No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (5,6), body at (5,5), tail at (4,5). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 9**: Move right (R) to (6,6) to eat the food there. Score increases to 3. Snake grows to length 4: head at (6,6), body at (5,6), (5,5), tail at (4,5). Direction becomes R.\n\nThis plan eats three food items (at (2,2), (2,5), and (6,6)) by turn 9, maximizing score while avoiding all risks. The food at (2,1) is not eaten due to distance and life span constraints, but this is optimal. After turn 9, the snake can move freely to survive, as no more food is present.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: R} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4). The snake positions are head at (2,2) and body at (3,2), so it's a snake of length 2. The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,2) from (3,2).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (2,1) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nSince it's turn 2, and life spans are given, I need to keep track of how many turns each food has left. Life span is the number of turns it will exist, including the current turn. So for (2,5), life span 8 at turn 2 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns. But it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if at turn t, life span is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), so for (2,5,8,1) at turn 2, that means at the beginning of turn 2, it has 8 turns left, including turn 2. So after turn 2, it will have 7 left, and it will disappear after turn 9? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life span given. \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of turn t or beginning of next turn? The countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn.\n\nI think it's better to think that at the start of each turn, the life span decreases by 1. So for food present at turn t with life span L, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, life span 8: it will be available on turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and disappear at turn 10? Turns: from t=2 to t=2+L-1 = 2+8-1=9, so it exists until the end of turn 9, I suppose.\n\nThe problem says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now it will be gone. But with countdown including current, it might be ambiguous.\n\nLet me read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think the standard way is: if at turn t, life span is L, then after L turns, it will disappear. Since countdown decreases including current, on turn t, it decreases to L-1 after the turn or something. To avoid confusion, I'll assume that at the beginning of turn t, the life span value is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn. So after the turn is processed, it decreases by 1.\n\nFor decision making, when the snake moves on turn t, the food is present if life span > 0 at the start of the turn. After the move, life span decreases.\n\nBut in this case, for turn t=2, life span 8 for (2,5), so it has 8 turns left including turn 2. After turn 2, it will have 7 left for turn 3, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,2), direction left, so last move was to the left, from (3,2) to (2,2). So possible moves: since direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R, because R would be opposite to L, and no instant reverse is allowed. The rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions from (2,2): U, D, L.\n\n- U: up to (2,3)\n\n- D: down to (2,1)\n\n- L: left to (1,2)\n\nBut walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see.\n\n\"Cells occupied by walls: Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\nSo the grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so snake can only be on (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nSnake positions: (2,2) and (3,2), both within 1 to 6, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2):\n\n- U: to (2,3) - is this valid? y=3, which is not border, and not obstacle? (2,3) is not listed as obstacle, only (6,4) is internal obstacle, so (2,3) should be free, but need to check if occupied by snake body. Snake body is at (3,2), so (2,3) is empty. So U to (2,3) is possible.\n\n- D: to (2,1) - y=1, which is not border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall. (2,1) is within 1-6, and no obstacle mentioned, except there is food at (2,1), but food doesn't block movement, only when eaten. So moving to (2,1) is possible, and if head moves there, it might eat the food.\n\n- L: to (1,2) - x=1, not border, should be free. (1,2) not occupied, so possible.\n\n- R: to (3,2) but (3,2) is the current body position. But since the tail will move, it might be possible to move there only if the tail moves away.\n\nThe rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,2) is possible because after the move, the tail will move, so the head can be at (3,2) without collision, as long as it's only the tail.\n\nHere, snake is [(2,2), (3,2)], head at (2,2), tail at (3,2). If I move R to (3,2), the head moves to (3,2), which is current tail position. After move, the snake body updates: new head at (3,2), and the tail was at (3,2), but since head moved to tail, and we eat food or not? No food at (3,2), I think. Food is at (2,5), (6,6), (2,1), not at (3,2).\n\nIf no food eaten, the tail moves away, so the cell (3,2) is vacated, and head is at (3,2), but since tail was there, it's ok because tail moves, so no collision. The new positions: if head moves to (3,2), and no food eaten, then the new snake is [(3,2), (2,2)]? Let's see how snake moves.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, and if no food eaten, tail is removed. So from [(2,2), (3,2)], if head moves to (3,2), which is current tail, then new head is (3,2), and since we moved to tail position, but no food, the tail should be removed, so the new body is only [(3,2)]? That would mean snake length decreases? But normally, if you move to a cell with no food, length stays same, tail moves.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is cut off, so snake length same. If food, tail not cut, length increases.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,2): the cell (3,2) has the tail, but it's not food, so when head moves there, since no food, the tail is removed, and new position should be just the head at (3,2), with no body? That would make snake length 1, but it was 2, so it shrinks? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding.\n\nThe snake positions are list of segments, head first. When moving, new head position based on direction, then if new position has food, add new head, keep tail, length +1. If no food, add new head, remove tail, length same.\n\nBut if new head position is the current tail position, it might be a special case.\n\nIn this scenario, from state [(2,2) head, (3,2) tail], if head moves right to (3,2), new head is (3,2). Now, (3,2) is the current tail position. Since we moved there and no food, we should remove the tail, so the new snake is only [ (3,2) ], meaning the snake now has only one segment at (3,2). But that means the snake shortened from 2 to 1, which is not typical, but logically, since tail was removed, and head is now at the former tail position.\n\nBut in terms of collision, since the tail is removed, there is no body at (3,2) anymore, so no collision.\n\nThen for the next move, the head is at (3,2), and no body, so it can move freely.\n\nBut in this case, the snake length decreased, which is unusual, but possible if it moves back on itself without eating.\n\nBut the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" Which implies that it's allowed, and the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn the movement, when head moves to tail position, and no food, the tail is removed, so effectively, the cell is free after move.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food at tail, it might be different, but here no food.\n\nIn this specific case, for turn 2, moving R to (3,2) is possible, and it would result in snake at [(3,2)] with length 1.\n\nBut let's confirm with the positions.\n\nInitial: positions [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nAfter move R: head to (3,2), which is occupied by tail. Since no food, tail is removed. New positions: [(3,2)]\n\nLength is now 1.\n\nIf there was food at (3,2), it would be eaten, and tail not removed, so new positions [(3,2), (2,2)] or something, but head at (3,2), body at (2,2), length 2, but since food eaten, it should grow, so new positions [(3,2), (3,2)? No.\n\nStandard: if eat food, head moves to new cell, and tail stays, so segment added.\n\nFor example, from [(2,2), (3,2)], move to cell with food, say (2,1), then new head at (2,1), and body at (2,2), and tail at (3,2) is still there? No: the body segments shift.\n\nWhen head moves to new position, if food eaten, the new head is added, and tail remains, so snake becomes [new head, previous head, previous body...]\n\nSo from [(2,2), (3,2)], move to (2,1) with food: new positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]? No: the segments: new head at (2,1), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, and previous tail (3,2) is still tail, so positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], length 3.\n\nIf no food, move to (2,1) no food: new head at (2,1), previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (3,2) is removed, so new positions [(2,1), (2,2)], length 2.\n\nBack to moving to tail: if head moves to current tail position, like (3,2), and no food there, then new head at (3,2), and since no food, tail is removed. But the current tail is at (3,2), which is the new head position, so when we remove tail, we are removing the cell that new head is moving to, but it's the same cell, so after move, the snake is at [(3,2)] only, since tail is removed and no other body.\n\nYes, that makes sense for length 2 snake.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food at (3,2), then moving there, eat food, so tail not removed, new head at (3,2), and body includes previous head (2,2), so new positions [(3,2), (2,2)], length 2, but since food eaten, it should grow to 3, but the cell (3,2) has food, so when head moves there, it eats, so we add a new segment, so new positions should be [(3,2), (2,2), and since tail was at (3,2), but now head is there, it's messy.\n\nI think it's better not to have food under the snake, but the rule says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nIn this case, for turn 2, no food at (3,2), so moving R to (3,2) is possible, and it results in snake at [(3,2)] with length 1.\n\nBut for now, I should avoid that because it reduces length, and we want to maximize score by eating food to grow.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (2,1), which is down from current position.\n\nAlso, the head direction is L, so I cannot move R this turn because it's opposite to current direction? Current direction is L, and R is right, which is opposite, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on this turn.\n\nSo for turn 2, possible moves are U, D, L, not R.\n\nR is invalid because of no reverse.\n\nSo only U, D, L possible.\n\nNow, from (2,2):\n\n- U to (2,3)\n\n- D to (2,1)\n\n- L to (1,2)\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (2,5): at (2,5), which is 3 units up from (2,2), since (2,2) to (2,5) is Δy=3.\n\n- (6,6): at (6,6), which is far, Δx=4, Δy=4.\n\n- (2,1): at (2,1), which is down, Δy=-1, so adjacent down.\n\nAlso, life spans: all have life span 8 at turn 2, so (2,5) disappears after turn 9, similarly (6,6) after turn 9, (2,1) life span 9, so disappears after turn 10? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 2, life span given:\n\n(2,5): 8, so it will be available for turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (8 turns, from t=2 to t=9 inclusive? Turn t=2: available, after turn 2, life span decreases to 7, available at t=3 with 7, and so on, until at t=9, life span 1, available, after t=9, life span 0, disappears at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6): life span 8 at t=2, available until t=9.\n\n(2,1): life span 9 at t=2, available until t=10.\n\nSince all have value +1, and we want to eat them to grow.\n\nBut we need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, snake is short, length 2, tail at (3,2), head at (2,2), so tail is adjacent to head (left of head).\n\nBut the tail cell (3,2) has no food, so no danger.\n\nNow, possible actions for turn 2:\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,1). (2,1) has food with value +1, life span 9. So if I move down to (2,1), I eat the food, so snake grows: new positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]? Head to (2,1), eat food, so new head at (2,1), previous head (2,2) becomes body, tail (3,2) remains, but since food eaten, we add a segment, so positions: new head (2,1), then body (2,2), then tail (3,2), so [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], length 3.\n\nThen head direction would be D, since moved down.\n\nLife span of (2,1) decreases after eaten? No, the food is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nLife span is for the food existing, not after eaten.\n\nAfter eating, food is gone.\n\nNow, after eating, snake is longer.\n\nBut (2,1) is at the bottom, y=1, which is not wall, but close to border.\n\ny=0 is wall, so y=1 is ok.\n\nBut moving down might be risky if we are near border.\n\nCurrently, from (2,2) to (2,1), it's safe.\n\nThen for next turns, we can move to other food.\n\nBut let's think alternatives.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (2,3). No food there, so no eat, snake moves: new head at (2,3), previous head (2,2) becomes body, tail (3,2) removed, so new positions [(2,3), (2,2)], length 2. Head direction U.\n\nThen from there, we can go towards (2,5) which is up.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), from (2,3) it's up to (2,4) then (2,5).\n\nOption 3: Move L to (1,2). No food at (1,2), so move to (1,2), new head (1,2), body (2,2), tail removed, positions [(1,2), (2,2)], length 2. Head direction L.\n\nThen from (1,2), we can go up or down, but (1,2) is near left border.\n\nx=1, y=2.\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,6), which is far, and internal obstacle at (6,4), which might block access.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nTo reach (6,6), from (2,2), it's a long way.\n\nBut life span 8, so we have time.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate choices.\n\nIf I move down to (2,1) and eat food, I get +1 score, snake length 3.\n\nThen positions: head at (2,1), body at (2,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1): U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse, so since direction is D, cannot move U (up), opposite.\n\nSo can move D, L, R.\n\n- D: to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- L: to (1,1)\n\n- R: to (3,1)\n\nAlso, U is invalid because reverse.\n\nSo from (2,1), can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nNow, if I don't eat at (2,1), I can move U or L.\n\nBut (2,1) food has life span 9, so it will be there for several turns, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is up, life span 8.\n\n(6,6) is far.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, walls at borders.\n\nInternal wall at (6,4), so (6,4) blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: except walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat all three foods if possible, but I need a path.\n\nAlso, with snake growing, it might be harder to maneuver.\n\nBut currently length 2, small.\n\nNow, for turn 2, if I move D to (2,1), I eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nThen from there, I need to go somewhere.\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), no eat, length 2, then I can go to (2,4) then (2,5) to eat that food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (1,2), no eat, then I can go up to (1,3), etc., but (1,2) is corner, might be risky.\n\nLet's consider the food at (2,1). If I don't eat it now, it will be there until turn 10, so I have time.\n\nBut if I eat it now, I grow, which might be good for survival or bad if I get stuck.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating early might be better to grow and have more space? But with longer snake, harder to turn.\n\nBut grid is small, 6x6 playable area, with obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6 except (6,4) is wall, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells? 6x6=36, minus (6,4), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 2, so 33 free cells.\n\nAfter eating one food, length 3, etc.\n\nNow, the food at (2,5) is at y=5, which is near top, y=6 is border, so y=5 is ok.\n\n(6,6) is at corner, x=6,y=6, and internal wall at (6,4), so to reach (6,6), from left, I need to go to (5,6) or (6,5), but (6,5) might be accessible.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is not wall, but x=6,y=6, since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,6) is playable, but adjacent to walls.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is at bottom.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but currently no issue.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to give actions for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nBut I need to think ahead but only output for a few turns? The format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence of at least 5 moves.\n\nBut for output, I need to provide the actions for the upcoming turns, probably until a decision point or something.\n\nBut in the boxed answer, I need to list the actions for turn 2,3,4,etc.\n\nBut I don't know how many to list; perhaps for a few turns to show the plan.\n\nSince it's a game, I might need to simulate multiple steps.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path to eat the foods.\n\nFirst, let's list the coordinates:\n\nHead at (2,2)\n\nFoods: F1 at (2,5), F2 at (6,6), F3 at (2,1)\n\nF3 at (2,1) is very close, down.\n\nIf I eat F3 now, I grow to length 3, then I can go up towards F1.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), tail (3,2)\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), since U is invalid (reverse from down).\n\nSay I move R to (3,1).\n\nThen new head at (3,1), no food there, so new positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2)? When no eat, tail removed.\n\nFrom [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], move to (3,1): head to (3,1), not food, so new head (3,1), previous head (2,1) becomes body, tail (3,2) removed, so new positions [(3,1), (2,1)], and body (2,2) is gone? Positions: after move, new head (3,1), then the body segments: previous head (2,1) is now the first body segment, and the previous tail (3,2) is removed, so the second body segment was (2,2), but it is removed because tail is cut.\n\nSnake segments: before move: index 0: head (2,1), 1: body (2,2), 2: tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move to (3,1) no food: new head at (3,1), then the previous head (2,1) becomes body segment, and the tail (3,2) is removed, so the new body has only one segment: (2,1), so positions [(3,1), (2,1)], length 2.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go to (3,2) or (4,1) or (3,0) invalid, or (2,1) but (2,1) is body, so collision if move there.\n\n(2,1) is now body, so cannot move there.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,2), D invalid (y=0 wall), L to (2,1) but occupied by body, collision, R to (4,1).\n\nSo only U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\n(3,2) is free? Currently no snake or food, so yes.\n\nIf U to (3,2), new head (3,2), no food, so new positions [(3,2), (3,1)], etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat the close food to grow.\n\nBut let's consider not eating now and going for (2,5).\n\nFor turn 2, move U to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 2: U to (2,3)\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), tail removed, so [(2,3), (2,2)], length 2. Head direction U.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no reverse, direction U, so cannot move D. Can move U, L, R.\n\n- U to (2,4): no food, so move to (2,4), new head (2,4), body (2,3), positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\n- Then turn 4: U to (2,5): food at (2,5), so eat, new head (2,5), body (2,4), and since eat, tail not removed, so new positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]? Before move, positions [(2,4), (2,3)], head (2,4).\n\nMove U to (2,5), eat food, so new head (2,5), previous head (2,4) becomes body, and the tail (2,3) remains, but since eat, we add a segment, so positions: new head (2,5), then body (2,4), then body (2,3), so [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], length 3.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (2,5), we can move to other places.\n\n(2,5) is at top, y=5, near border y=6 wall.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), but y=6 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since y=7 is wall.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nSo (2,6) is playable.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nD to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, so collision if move down.\n\nL to (1,5)\n\nR to (3,5)\n\nAnd since direction U, cannot move D (reverse).\n\nSo from (2,5), can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,6): no food, then positions etc.\n\nBut we have food at (6,6) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is still available.\n\nLife span: at turn 4, when we eat (2,5), it was available from turn 2 to 9, so at turn 4, it has life span 8-2=6 left? At turn 2, life span 8, after turn 2, 7, after turn 3, 6, at turn 4 start, life span 6, so still available.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 9 at t=2, at t=4, 7 left.\n\n(6,6) same as (2,5).\n\nNow from (2,5), after eating, we need to go down or left/right to reach other food.\n\nBut snake is vertical at (2,3),(2,4),(2,5), so if we move L or R, say to (1,5) or (3,5), then we can go down.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), which is below, but we have body at (2,3) and (2,4), so we can't go directly down.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), move L to (1,5).\n\nThen new positions: head to (1,5), no food there, so new head (1,5), body (2,5), and tail (2,4) removed? Positions before move: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nMove to (1,5) no food: new head (1,5), previous head (2,5) becomes body, tail (2,3) removed, so new positions [(1,5), (2,5)], length 2? No: when no eat, tail is removed, so segments: new head (1,5), body (2,5), and (2,4) and (2,3) are removed? The tail is removed, so only two segments: new head and previous head.\n\nPositions: after move, new head at (1,5), the previous head (2,5) is now the body, and the previous body segments are shifted, but since no eat, the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo from [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], move to (1,5) no food: new head (1,5), then the first body is previous head (2,5), and the tail (2,3) is removed, so the segment (2,4) is also removed because it's not part of the snake anymore. The snake now has head at (1,5), body at (2,5), so positions [(1,5), (2,5)], length 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we had moved R to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (2,5)].\n\nSo the snake shortens if no food eaten.\n\nTo maintain length, we need to eat food regularly.\n\nBut there are only three foods, so maximum length 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nInitial length 2, three foods, each +1, so max length 5.\n\nThen we can survive by not hitting walls or itself.\n\nBut with length 5 in 6x6 grid minus one obstacle, 35 cells, so possible.\n\nBack to turn 2 decision.\n\nIf I move D to (2,1) and eat, I grow to 3 immediately.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, so I need to go left or right first.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,1), can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) (since U invalid, D invalid wall).\n\nSay move R to (3,1).\n\nNo food at (3,1), so new positions: head to (3,1), no eat, so new head (3,1), body (2,1), tail (3,2) removed, so positions [(3,1), (2,1)], length 2.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), can move U to (3,2), or R to (4,1), or D invalid.\n\nIf U to (3,2), no food, positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), or L to (2,2), or R to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut we have food at (2,5) and (6,6).\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, move L to (1,1) instead.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut both ways, I lost the growth because I moved to no food cell.\n\nTo keep the length, I need to eat another food soon.\n\nBut the closest is (2,5) up.\n\nFrom (2,1) with length 3, if I could go directly up, but (2,2) is body, so I can't move up to (2,2), collision.\n\nSo I must move left or right to clear the way.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move L to (1,1).\n\nNo food, so positions: new head (1,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2) removed? Before move: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nMove to (1,1) no food: new head (1,1), previous head (2,1) becomes body, tail (3,2) removed, so positions [(1,1), (2,1)], length 2.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (1,1), can move U to (1,2), or L to (0,1) invalid wall, or D to (1,0) invalid, or R to (2,1) but occupied.\n\nSo only U to (1,2).\n\nMove U to (1,2), no food, positions [(1,2), (1,1)]\n\nThen from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2), etc.\n\nStill length 2.\n\nSo to eat (2,5), I need to go to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut (2,2) was body but removed.\n\nSo it's better not to eat the food at (2,1) now, and go for (2,5) first.\n\nFor turn 2, move U to (2,3).\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nThen turn 2: U to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (2,2)], length 2, direction U.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3), move U to (2,4), no food, positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5), eat food, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], length 3, direction U.\n\nNow at turn 4, head at (2,5), body at (2,4), (2,3).\n\nFood F3 at (2,1) still available, life span 9 at t=2, so at t=4, life span 7 left.\n\nF2 at (6,6) available.\n\nFrom (2,5), can move L to (1,5), R to (3,5), or U to (2,6).\n\nIf move U to (2,6), no food, then positions: new head (2,6), no eat, so new positions [(2,6), (2,5)], body (2,4) removed, length 2. Shortened.\n\nNot good.\n\nMove L to (1,5), no food, positions [(1,5), (2,5)], length 2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nOr move R to (3,5), same.\n\nTo avoid shortening, I need to eat food soon.\n\nBut the only other food is (2,1) below or (6,6) far.\n\n(2,1) is below, but I have body at (2,3) and (2,4), so I can't go directly down from (2,5).\n\nSo I must move left or right to turn.\n\nSay move R to (3,5).\n\nTurn 4: from (2,5), move R to (3,5), no food, so new head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4) removed, positions [(3,5), (2,5)], length 2. Direction R.\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) occupied, R to (4,5).\n\nSay move D to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut we lost the food at (2,5) growth.\n\nTo reach (2,1), from here, I need to go down.\n\nBut (2,3) and (2,4) are not body anymore, so I can go to (2,4) etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,4), then (3,3), etc., down to (3,1) or to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), so I can go left from (3,1) to (2,1), for example.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\nBut life span: (2,1) has life span 9, so until turn 10, (6,6) life span 8, until turn 9.\n\nAt turn 4, we have 5 turns to eat (6,6) and 6 turns for (2,1).\n\nBut snake is short.\n\nPerhaps for turn 2, move L to (1,2) instead.\n\nTurn 2: L to (1,2), no food, positions [(1,2), (2,2)], length 2, direction L.\n\nThen from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L invalid wall, R to (2,2) occupied.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nSay U to (1,3), no food, positions [(1,3), (1,2)]\n\nThen to (1,4), (1,5), etc. to reach (2,5) is not direct.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5, so from (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), then U to (2,4), (2,5).\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nBut let's consider eating (2,1) first and then going up.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1), eat food, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], length 3, direction D.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,1), can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) (U invalid, D invalid wall).\n\nSay move R to (3,1), no food, so new positions: head to (3,1), no eat, new head (3,1), body (2,1), tail (3,2) removed, positions [(3,1), (2,1)], length 2. Direction R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1), can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nMove U to (3,2), no food, positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), D to (3,1) occupied.\n\nMove U to (3,3), no food, positions [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need to go to (2,3) or something.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move L to (2,3), then U to (2,4), (2,5).\n\nBut at (2,3), if I go there, it might be free.\n\nBut no food at (2,3), so I eat only when at (2,5).\n\nBut the point is, by eating the food at (2,1) early, I grew to 3 but then shortened because I moved to empty cells.\n\nTo maintain length, I need to eat food frequently, but there are only three, so I will shorten if I don't eat.\n\nBut with three foods, max length 5, so I can stay at length 5 after eating all.\n\nBut I need to eat them in sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the far food later.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,1) can be eaten later, since it has longer life span.\n\nLife span 9 vs 8 for others.\n\nSo I can go for (2,5) first, then to (6,6), then to (2,1).\n\nBut (6,6) is far.\n\nLet's find a path.\n\nFrom head (2,2), move U to (2,3) on turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (2,2)], dir U.\n\nTurn 3: U to (2,4), positions [(2,4), (2,3)], dir U.\n\nTurn 4: U to (2,5), eat, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], length 3, dir U.\n\nNow at (2,5), to go to (6,6), I need to move right and up.\n\nBut I can't move down because body at (2,4).\n\nSo move R to (3,5).\n\nBut no food, so positions: head to (3,5), no eat, new head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4) removed, positions [(3,5), (2,5)], length 2.  dir R.\n\nThen from (3,5), move U to (3,6), no food, positions [(3,6), (3,5)], dir U.\n\nThen from (3,6), can move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), D to (3,5) occupied.\n\nSay move R to (4,6), no food, positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nThen to (5,6), then (6,6).\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), move R to (4,6), positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6), positions [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6), eat food, positions [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)], length 3, dir R.\n\nThen from (6,6), can move D to (6,5), L to (5,6), U invalid (y=7 wall? y=6 is playable, y=7 wall, so U to (6,7) invalid), R invalid (x=7 wall), so can move D to (6,5) or L to (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is body, so only D to (6,5).\n\nMove D to (6,5), no food, so new head (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6) removed, positions [(6,5), (6,6)], length 2.  dir D.\n\nThen from (6,5), can move D to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,5), U to (6,6) occupied, R invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,5).\n\nMove to (5,5), no food, positions [(5,5), (6,5)]\n\nThen to (5,4), etc. to go to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) has life span until turn 10, at turn 7, we have time.\n\nFrom (5,5), move D to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 8: to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut it's possible to reach (2,1) by turn 10 or so.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) to (2,1), delta x=3 left, delta y=3 down, so at least 6 moves, but with turns, possible.\n\nBut snake is short, so no problem.\n\nNow, back to turn 2, I have the option to move L to (1,2) or D to (2,1).\n\nBut D to (2,1) eats immediately.\n\nIn the sequence above, by going up first, I ate (2,5) at turn 4 and (6,6) at turn 7, then can eat (2,1) later.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) first, I might eat it at turn 2, then go to (2,5) but with difficulty.\n\nBut in terms of score, both ways I eat all three, so same score.\n\nBut survival: with longer snake, more risk of collision, but in this grid, it might be ok.\n\nBut for turn 2, if I move D to (2,1), I get the food now, but then I have to move away.\n\nBut let's consider the tail reward danger for the future.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,5) at (2,5), if the tail is at (2,3) and there is food on tail, but here no food on tail.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (6,4) blocks access to (6,5) and (6,6) from below, so I need to approach from left or above.\n\nIn my sequence, I came from left to (5,6) then to (6,6).\n\nFrom above, but (6,6) is corner.\n\nNow for the current turn, I think moving U to (2,3) is better to go for (2,5) first.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turn 2 and beyond.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 2.\n\nSince the state might change after each move, I need to provide the actions based on the initial state, but the food life span decreases, so I need to simulate.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path.\n\nLet's define the actions for the next few turns.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3) to start going towards (2,5)\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 4: from (2,4), move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen from there, move R to (3,5) on turn 5? But at turn 4 after eating, head at (2,5), dir U.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5) no eat, positions [(3,5), (2,5)] length 2\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (3,6) no eat, positions [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,6) no eat, positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,6) no eat, positions [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,6) eat, positions [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] length 3\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,6), move D to (6,5) no eat, positions [(6,5), (6,6)] length 2\n\nThen turn 11: move L to (5,5) no eat, positions [(5,5), (6,5)]\n\nAnd so on to go to (2,1)\n\nBut (2,1) has life span until turn 10, so at turn 10, it disappears? At turn 2, life span 9, so available until turn 10? Let's calculate life span.\n\nAt turn 2, (2,1) life span 9, so it will be available on turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, and disappear at turn 11? Earlier I thought: at turn t, life span L, available for L turns including t, so from t to t+L-1.\n\nAt turn 2, L=9, available on turns 2 to 10 inclusive? Turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 9 turns, yes, turn 10 is the last turn it exists, at turn 11 it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) L=8 at t=2, available turns 2 to 9.\n\n(6,6) same, turns 2 to 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I ate (2,5) at turn 4, which is within 2-9.\n\n(6,6) at turn 9, which is within 2-9.\n\n(2,1) at turn 2, L=9, available until turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, I didn't eat (2,1) yet, and at turn 10, it is still available, so I can eat it on turn 10 or before.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 10, I am at (6,5) or something, far from (2,1).\n\nFrom turn 10 head at (6,5), to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) at turn 10, move L to (5,5), turn 11 to (4,5), etc., but (2,1) disappears at turn 11? At turn 10, it is available, so on turn 10, if I am at (2,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut at turn 10, I am not at (2,1).\n\nFrom the sequence, at turn 9, I am at (6,6) eating, so turn 10 at (6,5), not at (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is available on turn 10, but I am not there, so I miss it.\n\nTo eat (2,1), I need to be there by turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, I can adjust to go to (2,1) after eating (2,5).\n\nFor example, after eating (2,5) at turn 4, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nInstead of moving right, move down, but I can't because body below.\n\nMove left to (1,5), but no food, positions shorten.\n\nTo reach (2,1) with the snake, I need to clear the column.\n\nFrom (2,5), move L to (1,5) on turn 5, positions [(1,5), (2,5)] length 2\n\nTurn 6: move D to (1,4) positions [(1,4), (1,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move D to (1,3) positions [(1,3), (1,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,2) positions [(1,2), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (1,1) positions [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (2,1) eat food, positions [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2)] or something.\n\nMove to (2,1), which has food, so eat, new head (2,1), body (1,1), and since eat, tail not removed, so positions [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]? Before move, positions [(1,1), (1,2)], head (1,1), move to (2,1) eat, new head (2,1), previous head (1,1) becomes body, tail (1,2) remains, so positions [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2)], length 3.\n\nAnd (2,1) eaten on turn 10.\n\nBut I missed (6,6), which disappeared at turn 10? (6,6) available until turn 9, I didn't eat it.\n\nAt turn 9, I was at (1,2), not at (6,6).\n\nSo I ate only two foods.\n\nTo eat all three, I need to include (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is far from (2,5), and with limited time.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 2, if I go directly to (6,6), it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 2: move R to (3,2) but I cannot, because no reverse, direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nCurrent direction L, so only U,D,L possible.\n\nL to (1,2) or U to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n\nSay turn 2: move R not possible, so not.\n\nMove U to (2,3), then as before.\n\nOr move D to (2,1) and eat, then from there go right and up.\n\nBut earlier it shortened.\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,1) eat, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] length 3, dir D.\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (3,1) no eat, positions [(3,1), (2,1)] length 2, dir R.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2) no eat, positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3) positions [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,4) positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5) positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,6) positions [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (4,6) positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (5,6) positions [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), available until turn 9, so at turn 9, I am at (4,6), not at (6,6), so I miss it.\n\nTo reach (6,6) by turn 9, from (3,6) at turn 8, I can move R to (4,6) on turn 8, then turn 9 move R to (5,6), but (6,6) is not reached.\n\nFrom (3,6) turn 8, move R to (4,6), turn 9 move R to (5,6), then turn 10 move R to (6,6), but (6,6) disappeared at turn 10? Available until turn 9, so on turn 9, it is there, but I am at (5,6), not at (6,6).\n\nAt turn 9, I need to be at (6,6) to eat.\n\nFrom (3,6) at turn 8, I can move directly to (4,6) or to (6,6) is not adjacent.\n\nDistance from (2,2) to (6,6) is |dx|=4, |dy=4|, so min 8 moves.\n\nAt turn 2, I can start moving towards it.\n\nBut with direction constraint.\n\nFor example, turn 2: move U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (3,4)  (from (2,4), dir U, can move R)\n\nPositions: from (2,4), move R to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (2,4)] length 2.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4) positions [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4) positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,5) positions [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,6) positions [(5,6), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,6) eat, positions [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? Before move, positions [(5,6), (5,5)], head (5,6), move to (6,6) eat, new head (6,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5) remains, so positions [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)], length 3.\n\nAte at turn 9.\n\nThen (2,5) I missed, because I didn't go there.\n\n(2,5) available until turn 9, but I was not there.\n\nAt turn 9 I ate (6,6), so (2,5) is gone.\n\n(2,1) still available until turn 10.\n\nFrom (6,6), move D to (6,5) on turn 10, no eat, positions [(6,5), (6,6)] length 2.\n\nThen go to (2,1) but far, and (2,1) at (2,1), on turn 10 I can eat it if I am there, but I am at (6,5), so not.\n\nSo I ate only (6,6).\n\nNot good.\n\nTo eat both (2,5) and (6,6), I need to do it within the turns.\n\nFrom (2,2), go to (2,5) first, then to (6,6).\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 3: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 4: U to (2,5) eat, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] length 3, dir U.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5) no eat, positions [(3,5), (2,5)] length 2, dir R.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5) positions [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (4,6) positions [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,6) positions [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,6) eat, positions [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] length 3.\n\nAte (6,6) at turn 9.\n\nThen (2,1) available until turn 10.\n\nFrom (6,6), turn 10: move D to (6,5) no eat, positions [(6,5), (6,6)] length 2.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), too far, cannot reach in one turn, so miss (2,1).\n\nSo I can eat only two of the three foods.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) first, then go to (2,5), then to (6,6), but (6,6) might be missed.\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,1) eat, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] length 3, dir D.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1) no eat, positions [(3,1), (2,1)] length 2, dir R.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2) no eat, positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3) positions [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,4) positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5) positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,6) positions [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (4,6) positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (5,6) positions [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nBut (6,6) not reached, and (2,5) not eaten.\n\n(2,5) available until turn 9, not eaten.\n\nSo still only one food eaten.\n\nTo eat all three, I need a more efficient path.\n\nPerhaps from (2,2), move L to (1,2), then up to (1,5), then right to (2,5), but (2,5) might be eaten later.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn 2: move L to (1,2), no eat, positions [(1,2), (2,2)] length 2, dir L.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,3) positions [(1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,4) positions [(1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,5) positions [(1,5), (1,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (2,5) eat, positions [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4)] length 3, dir R.\n\nAte (2,5) at turn 6.\n\nThen from (2,5), can move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) available until turn 9, so I have turns 7,8,9 to reach it.\n\nFrom (2,5), turn 7: move R to (3,5) no eat, positions [(3,5), (2,5)] length 2.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,6) positions [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (4,6) positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nNot at (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (3,6) on turn 8, I can move R to (4,6), but not to (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 6, move directly to (3,5) on turn 7, then to (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) but at turn 7: (3,5), turn 8: (4,5), turn 9: (5,5), not (6,6).\n\nNo.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 6, move U to (2,6) on turn 7, then R to (3,6), turn 8 R to (4,6), turn 9 R to (5,6), not (6,6).\n\nStill not.\n\nThe only way to reach (6,6) by turn 9 is to start moving right earlier.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) at turn 2, move U to (2,3) or something, but I have to go up first for (2,5).\n\nPerhaps I can go to (6,6) first, but it's far.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3) as before.\n\nBut to save turns, since (2,1) has longer life, I can ignore it for now and eat (2,5) and (6,6).\n\nBut (2,1) is easy to eat later.\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate (2,5) and (6,6), missed (2,1), but (2,1) is only one point, so score 2 vs 3 if I eat all, but I can't eat all with the turns.\n\nWith the snake, I can eat (2,1) last.\n\nBut from (6,6) at turn 9, to (2,1) by turn 10 is impossible, distance |dx=4|, |dy=5|, min 9 moves, so not possible in one turn.\n\nSo I can only eat two foods.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) and (2,5), then (6,6) is far.\n\nFor example, turn 2: D to (2,1) eat, then from there go to (2,5).\n\nBut after eating at (2,1), positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], head at (2,1), dir D.\n\nThen to go up, I need to move left or right first.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1) no eat, positions [(3,1), (2,1)] length 2.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2) no eat, positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3) positions [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3) positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,4) positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5) eat, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] length 3.\n\nAte (2,5) at turn 8.\n\nThen (6,6) available until turn 9, so on turn 9, from (2,5), move R to (3,5) no eat, positions [(3,5), (2,5)] length 2, not at (6,6).\n\nMiss (6,6).\n\nSo in all cases, I can only eat two of the three foods within the life spans.\n\nTherefore, for maximum score, I should eat the two that are easier to reach.\n\n(2,1) is very close, (2,5) is also close, (6,6) is far.\n\nSo perhaps eat (2,1) and (2,5), and forget about (6,6).\n\nOr eat (2,5) and (6,6), but (6,6) is riskier with the obstacle.\n\nBut let's calculate the turns.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,1): 1 move, eat on turn 2.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,5): 3 moves, eat on turn 4 or 5.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (6,6): 8 moves, eat on turn 9 or 10 but life span 8, so only by turn 9.\n\nSo to eat both (2,1) and (2,5), I can do it by turn 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, turn 2: move D to (2,1) eat, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] length 3.\n\nThen turn 3: move L to (1,1) no eat, positions [(1,1), (2,1)] length 2.  (since U invalid, D invalid, R to (2,1) occupied, so L to (1,1))\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,2) positions [(1,2), (1,1)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3) positions [(1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (2,3) positions [(2,3), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,4) positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5) eat, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] length 3.\n\nAte at turn 8.\n\nBut (6,6) not eaten.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), from (2,1), instead of moving L, move R to (3,1), then U to (3,2), etc., but same as before.\n\nI think it's impossible to eat all three, so I should choose to eat (2,1) and (2,5).\n\nFor turn 2, move D to (2,1) to eat the close food.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output the actions.\n\nBut the AI needs to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nPerhaps for turn 2, move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 3, from (2,1), move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,6)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,6) etc., but no more food.\n\nTo go to (2,5), from (3,3) move L to (2,3) on turn 6, then U to (2,4) turn 7, U to (2,5) turn 8.\n\nBut (2,5) life span until turn 9, so ok.\n\nBut (6,6) missed.\n\nSo for now, at turn 2, move D to (2,1) to eat the food.\n\nThen the actions can be:\n\nTurn 2: D (down) to eat (2,1)\n\nThen for turn 3, from (2,1), move R to (3,1) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards (2,5) after eating.\n\nBut with the body, it's hard.\n\nI think for simplicity, since the grid is small, and to maximize score, eating (2,1) now is good.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (2,1), which is adjacent, so low risk.\n\nMoving L or U might not eat immediately.\n\nSo I think for turn 2, move D to (2,1).\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nBut the state changes, so I should provide only the action for turn 2, and for later turns based on new state.\n\nBut the instruction is to provide a sequence.\n\nLet's assume I provide a sequence starting from turn 2.\n\nPerhaps for this case, move D on turn 2.\n\nThen for turn 3, from new position, but since I don't have the state, I need to simulate.\n\nI think I'll go with moving D on turn 2.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nThen for turn 3, from (2,1), dir D, can move L or R, say move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,1), dir R, can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), say U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), say U to (3,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut to make it simple, for the answer, I can provide turn 2: D, and then for later turns, it depends.\n\nBut the format requires multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R ( to (3,1) )\n\nTurn 4: U ( to (3,2) )\n\nTurn 5: U ( to (3,3) )\n\nTurn 6: U ( to (3,4) )\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nSince I ate the food at turn 2, and there is food at (2,5), I can go towards it.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)], head (2,1), dir D.\n\nTurn 3: move L to (1,1) no eat, positions [(1,1), (2,1)] length 2, dir L.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,2) positions [(1,2), (1,1)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3) positions [(1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (2,3) positions [(2,3), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,4) positions [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5) eat, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] length 3.\n\nSo for the first few turns:\n\nTurn 2: D ( to (2,1) eat)\n\nTurn 3: L ( to (1,1) )\n\nTurn 4: U ( to (1,2) )\n\nTurn 5: U ( to (1,3) )\n\nThen turn 6: R to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 6 or so.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output for a few turns.\n\nI think for turn 2, move D to eat the food.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Current snake position and direction**: Head at (2,2) with direction left (L). Snake length is 2.\n- **Food availability**: \n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 8 (available until turn 9).\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 8 (available until turn 9).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 10).\n- **Grid constraints**: Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (6,4). Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (6,4).\n- **Priorities**: \n  - Eat (2,1) immediately on turn 2 to gain +1 score and increase length to 3, as it is adjacent and low-risk.\n  - Avoid (6,6) due to distance and limited life span; reaching it by turn 9 is unlikely without sacrificing other opportunities.\n  - Focus on eating (2,5) after (2,1) for a second +1 score, as it is reachable by turn 8.\n  - After eating both, prioritize survival by moving safely to open areas.\n\n### Simulated Plan (5+ Turns Ahead)\n1. **Turn 2**: Move down (D) to (2,1) to eat the positive food there. This gains +1, increases length to 3, and avoids immediate risk. The new head direction is D.\n2. **Turn 3**: From (2,1), move left (L) to (1,1). This avoids the wall at y=0 and positions the snake to navigate upward toward (2,5). No food eaten; length remains 3.\n3. **Turn 4**: From (1,1), move up (U) to (1,2). This continues the path upward. No food eaten; length remains 3.\n4. **Turn 5**: From (1,2), move up (U) to (1,3). This approaches the row of (2,5). No food eaten; length remains 3.\n5. **Turn 6**: From (1,3), move right (R) to (2,3). This aligns the snake to move directly upward to (2,5). No food eaten; length remains 3.\n6. **Turn 7**: From (2,3), move up (U) to (2,4). This moves closer to (2,5). No food eaten; length remains 3.\n7. **Turn 8**: From (2,4), move up (U) to (2,5) to eat the food. This gains another +1, increasing length to 4.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score maximization**: Eating (2,1) and (2,5) yields +2 score, which is achievable given their life spans. (6,6) is skipped because it requires ~7 moves from (2,2) and conflicts with eating both closer foods.\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - Moving D on turn 2 is safe: (2,1) is not under the snake, and no tail collision risk.\n  - The path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. For example, after eating (2,1), moving L and U clears space to reach (2,5) safely.\n  - No instant reverse is violated (e.g., from D direction, U is not allowed on turn 3).\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 8, the snake has length 4. It can then move to open areas (e.g., right or up) to avoid trapping itself. The grid has 35 free cells, so a length-4 snake has ample space.\n- **Life span handling**: (2,1) eaten on turn 2 (well before turn 10 expiry), and (2,5) eaten on turn 8 (before turn 9 expiry). (6,6) expires on turn 9 and is not reachable without missing other foods.\n\nThis plan prioritizes immediate gain from (2,1) and secures a second point from (2,5) while maintaining flexibility for survival beyond turn 8.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 3: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 4: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 6: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 7: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 8: U (up)\n}",
