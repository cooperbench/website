        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is at turn t1 = 0:\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are there, I can't go to those cells. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\n- Snake positions: Only one segment at (3,3), which is the head. Since it's just one segment, it's both head and tail. The head direction is left, so it's facing L (x-1 direction).\n\n- Food: Three pieces:\n  - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n  - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n  - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1. Life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown starts now.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, moving will grow it when it eats food. But for now, no food is eaten.\n\nMovement: I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). Current direction is L, so I can't instantly reverse to R on this turn. Possible moves from (3,3) are U, D, L, R, but since direction is L, I can't go R immediately? No, the \"no instant reverse\" means I can't move opposite to the current direction on the next turn, but for this turn, since it's the first move, I think I can choose any direction except possibly the reverse, but let me check.\n\nThe rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" But for the current turn, since the snake is moving now, I can choose any direction, but I have to respect that for subsequent turns, I can't reverse instantly.\n\nAt turn t1=0, head direction is L, so if I move R, that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nIt says \"on next turn\", but for the current action, I think I can choose any direction, but the constraint is for consecutive moves. Let me parse this.\n\nThe input says \"Snake Head Direction: L\" for turn t1=0, before any move. So at the start of turn 0, head is at (3,3) facing left. When I choose an action for turn 0, I move in that direction, and then the head direction changes to the new direction.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is updated to the direction I just moved.\n\nFor turn 0, since current direction is L, I cannot move R for turn 0 because that would be instant reverse? The rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", but \"next turn\" might refer to the turn after the current one. I need to clarify.\n\nLet me read the rule again: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nI think it means that for any turn, when you choose the action for that turn, you cannot choose the opposite direction to the current head direction at the start of that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t, head direction is D, then for turn t action, you cannot choose U, because that's instant reverse.\n\nSimilarly here, at turn 0, head direction is L, so I cannot choose R for turn 0 action. I can choose U, D, or L.\n\nYes, that makes sense to avoid the snake turning back on itself instantly.\n\nSo possible actions for turn 0: U (up), D (down), or L (left). R is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders and (6,4). So let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. But walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the cells are from (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? Let's see.\n\nx=0 is wall, so x=1 to x=6 are free? But x=7 is also wall, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6? But the food has (2,5), (2,2), (6,6). (6,6) - if y=7 is wall, y=6 is the last row? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free cells. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nBut (6,6) is at x=6,y=6, which should be free, but internal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is wall.\n\nAlso, snake at (3,3).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- U: (3,4) - is this valid? y=4, which is between 1 and 6, and not wall or obstacle. Walls are borders and (6,4), so (3,4) should be free.\n\n- D: (3,2) - similarly, should be free.\n\n- L: (2,3) - since x=2, y=3, free.\n\n- R: (4,3) - but R is opposite to current L, so not allowed for turn 0.\n\nSo for turn 0, I can choose U, D, or L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's list all food positions:\n\n- F1: (2,5) value 1, life 10\n\n- F2: (2,2) value 1, life 10\n\n- F3: (6,6) value 1, life 10\n\nAll life span 10, so they disappear at turn 10 if not eaten.\n\nSince life span decreases every turn including current, at turn 0, life span 10, so after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nBut at turn when it's eaten, it's consumed.\n\nSnake is single segment, so if I eat food, snake grows to length 2.\n\nNow, I need to plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns, but the answer should be actions for turns starting from t1=0.\n\nThe output should be like:\n\nTurn 0: action\n\nTurn 1: action\n\n...\n\nUp to at least 5 turns or more, but since I need to think ahead, I should plan a path.\n\nAlso, since snake is short, no body collision risk yet, but as it grows, I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid layout.\n\nSketch a 6x6 grid from (1,1) to (6,6):\n\ny=6: row 6 (top, if y increases up)\n\nAssuming y=0 is bottom, y=7 top wall? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top; I need to define.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I think. So (x,0) is bottom row, (x,7) is top wall? No.\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the playable y is from 1 to 6, with y=1 being bottom, y=6 top? Or y=1 top? Let's see.\n\nIn coordinates, (x,y), U is (x,y+1), so if y increases up, then (x,1) is bottom, (x,6) is top, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 left, x=6 right, with x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n\nNow, positions:\n\n- Snake: (3,3)\n\n- Food: (2,5), (2,2), (6,6)\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5, which is left and up from (3,3)\n\n(2,2): x=2,y=2, left and down\n\n(6,6): x=6,y=6, far right top\n\nSince head direction is L, moving left is towards (2,3) or something.\n\nPossible actions turn 0: U, D, L\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), that's empty, no food there.\n\n(2,3) has no food; food are at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6), so (2,3) is free.\n\nIf U to (3,4), free.\n\nIf D to (3,2), free.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider going towards food.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is 2 steps away: from (3,3) to (2,5) I need to go left to x=2 and up to y=5.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is left and down.\n\n(6,6) is far, right and up.\n\nSince current direction is L, moving L to (2,3) might be good to approach (2,5) or (2,2).\n\nBut let's see paths.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), which might affect paths to (6,6).\n\nNow, life span: all food has life 10, so plenty of time, 10 turns.\n\nBut I should eat soon to grow the snake and be able to eat more.\n\nSince snake is length 1, no body, so no collision risk except walls.\n\nBut after eating, it grows.\n\nLet's simulate possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nThen snake position: after move, head at (2,3), and since no food eaten, length still 1? When I move to a cell, if there is food, I eat it and grow.\n\nAt (2,3), is there food? No, food at (2,5), (2,2), (6,6), so (2,3) empty. So after moving to (2,3), snake is at [(2,3)], length 1, head direction now L (since I moved L).\n\nNow, from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (opposite) for next turn.\n\nBut for turn 1, head direction is L, so I can choose U, D, L, but not R.\n\nFood at (2,5) above, (2,2) below.\n\nIf I go U to (2,4), then to (2,5) might be possible, but (2,5) has food.\n\nFrom (2,3), U to (2,4): empty, no food. Then from (2,4), U to (2,5): eat food, since (2,5) has food.\n\nAt turn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) — eat food, snake grows to length 2. Now positions: head at (2,5), tail at (2,4)? When snake eats, it grows, so after eating at (2,5), the snake was at [(2,3)] before moving to (2,5)? Let's sequence.\n\nStart turn 0: snake at [(3,3)], move L to (2,3). Since no food, new position [(2,3)].\n\nTurn 1: snake at [(2,3)], move U to (2,4). No food there, so new position [(2,4)].\n\nTurn 2: snake at [(2,4)], move U to (2,5). Now (2,5) has food, so eat it, snake grows. New head at (2,5), and the previous position (2,4) becomes body, so snake is [(2,5), (2,4)].\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nNow, score +1, length 2.\n\nLife span of that food: it was eaten at turn 2, so fine.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead from turn 0.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nBut let's list all possible actions for turn 0 and see consequences.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, I should choose a sequence that leads to eating food safely.\n\nAnother food is (2,2), which is down from (2,3).\n\nIf at turn 0 I move L to (2,3), then turn 1 I can move D to (2,2) to eat it.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3) — no eat\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) — eat food, snake grows to [(2,2), (2,3)]? When moving to (2,2), eat, so head to (2,2), and body at (2,3), but since it was length 1, after eating, positions: head at (2,2), tail at previous position (2,3).\n\nBefore move, snake at [(2,3)], move to (2,2), which has food, so after move, head at (2,2), and since it grew, the tail is still at (2,3), so snake [(2,2), (2,3)].\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen I can go to other places.\n\n(2,5) is still there.\n\n(6,6) is far.\n\nBut with life span 10, I have time.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eat multiple food.\n\nNow, the third food at (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (3,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut current direction L, so I cannot move R on turn 0, I have to go U, D, or L first.\n\nIf I go U or D, I might go towards (2,5) or (2,2) indirectly.\n\nFor example, turn 0 move U to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (2,5) or other.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (3,4), I can go L to (2,4), then U to (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,2) on turn 0, then to (2,2) or something.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger, but for now, snake is short, no issue.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but currently no body, so no issue.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead, I should consider paths to eat food.\n\nLet me denote the grid:\n\nAssume x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nCells:\n\nRow y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) — food at (6,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5) food, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) obstacle\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) snake, (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2) food, (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nWalls at borders.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) blocked.\n\nNow, from (3,3), possible moves turn 0: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3)\n\nIf I choose L to (2,3):\n\n- Turn 0: move L to (2,3), no eat\n\nThen from (2,3), head direction L, so for turn 1, I can move U, D, L (not R)\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), no eat (unless food, but no)\n\nThen turn 2, from (2,4), move U to (2,5) eat, snake grows to length 2, positions [(2,5), (2,4)], head direction U.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, (6,6) is at (6,6), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut from (2,5), head direction U, so I can move U, D, L, R? Current direction U, so cannot move D for turn 3.\n\nMove R to (3,5)? (3,5) is free.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (4,5), etc. towards (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), and (6,4) is obstacle, so I need to go around, e.g., via (5,5) or (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is free, then to (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), after eating, at turn 2.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), no eat\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), no eat\n\nTurn 5: to (5,5), no eat\n\nTurn 6: to (6,5), no eat\n\nTurn 7: to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut life span of (6,6) is 10, so at turn 7 it might be gone? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, it becomes 9 (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, when we process, life span decreases by 1 for that turn.\n\nFor food, at the start of turn t, life span is L, during the turn, it decreases, and if eaten, it's consumed, else if L=1, after decrease it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nTypically: at the beginning of turn, food life span is checked, decreased, if 0, removed. Then snake moves, if moves to food cell, eats it.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut for eating, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it.\n\nSo, for a food with life span L at turn start:\n\n- At turn start, life span decreases to L-1.\n\n- If L-1 = 0, food disappears before move.\n\n- Else, food is present.\n\n- Then snake moves: if to a cell with food, eats it and grows.\n\nIn this case, for food at turn 0, life span 10.\n\nAt turn 0 start, life span decreases to 9 (since including current turn).\n\nThen snake moves; if moves to food, eats it.\n\nAfter turn 0, life span becomes 8 for next turn, etc.\n\nGeneral: at start of turn t, for each food, decrease life span by 1. If new life span 0, food disappears and is removed. Then snake moves to a cell; if that cell has food, eat it and grow.\n\nIn the input, at turn t1=0, food given with life span, so at turn 0 start, life span decreases.\n\nBut for the state, it's given at the beginning, before any action.\n\nSimilarly here, turn 0, food with life span 10, so at turn 0 start, life span decreases to 9? I think I need to confirm.\n\nThe rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if...\", etc.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume that at the start of the turn, before snake moves, the life span decreases, and if it becomes 0, food is removed.\n\nThen snake moves; if it moves to a cell with food, it eats it.\n\nIn this case, for turn 0:\n\n- At start, food life span decreases from 10 to 9? Or from given value?\n\nThe input says at turn t1=0, food has life span 10, so I think it's the value at that time.\n\nBut the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 0, when we begin, life span is 10, but during turn 0, it decreases, meaning after the turn, it becomes 9.\n\nBut for the move, at turn 0, when snake moves, the food is still at life span 10, I think.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look for standard interpretation.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSo for a food spawned at turn T with life span N, it exists from turn T to turn T+N-1, and disappears at turn T+N.\n\nFor example, at turn T, it is present with life span N, then after turn T, life span N-1, and so on, until life span 1 at turn T+N-1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not present at turn T+N.\n\nAt the turn when life span is 1, after decrease to 0, it disappears, so not available for that turn's move.\n\nLet's think:\n\n- Turn K: food has life span L at start of turn.\n\n- Decrease life span to L-1.\n\n- If L-1 == 0, food is removed, not present for this turn.\n\n- Else, food is present with life span L-1 for this turn.\n\n- Then snake moves: if to a cell with food, eats it.\n\nIn this case, for food at turn 0, life span 10 at start.\n\nAt turn 0 start: decrease life span to 9 (since including current turn), so now life span 9, present.\n\nSnake moves; if to food cell, eats it.\n\nThen after turn 0, for turn 1, life span 8, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if life span was 1 at turn start, decrease to 0, removed, not present for move.\n\nIn this problem, all food has life span 10 at turn 0, so at turn 0, after decrease, life span 9, present.\n\nBut the value is still +1, etc.\n\nFor eating, it's fine.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAt turn 0, from (3,3), I can move U, D, or L.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (2,2) or (2,5).\n\n(2,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance: from (3,3) to (2,2) is |3-2| + |3-2| = 2 steps if I go directly.\n\nSimilarly to (2,5): |3-2| + |3-5| =1+2=3 steps.\n\nTo (6,6): |3-6| + |3-6| =3+3=6 steps.\n\nBut with obstacles, etc.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, eating (2,2) might be quicker.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger later.\n\nFirst, option: move L to (2,3) on turn 0.\n\nThen at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) on turn 1 to eat it.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3) — no eat, snake at [(2,3)], direction L\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) — (2,2) has food, so eat, snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), so [(2,2), (2,3)], head direction D.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, to (2,5): from (2,2), head direction D, so I can move U, but U is opposite to D, so cannot move U for turn 2? Current direction D, so for turn 2 action, I cannot move U (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: L, R, D (not U).\n\nL to (1,2)? But x=1, y=2, is it valid? x=1 is not wall, since walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\n(1,2) should be free, no obstacle mentioned.\n\nR to (3,2), D to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut to go to (2,5), I need to go up, but I cannot move U immediately because of direction.\n\nSo from (2,2), if I move R to (3,2), for example.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) — no food, snake at [(3,2), (2,2)]? When moving, head moves to (3,2), tail moves from (2,3) to? When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo before move, positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,2), head to (3,2), and the tail (2,3) is removed since not grown, but since no eat, snake length same, so new positions: head (3,2), and body is the previous head position, so [(3,2), (2,2)].\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), but (3,3) was previous position, but now empty, or to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,2), move U to (3,3), no food.\n\nThen to (3,4), etc., but it might take time.\n\nSince I cannot move up directly from (2,2), I have to go around.\n\nAnother option from (2,3): instead of moving D to (2,2), I could move U to (2,4) on turn 1, then U to (2,5) on turn 2.\n\nAs I thought earlier.\n\nThen after eating (2,5) at turn 2, snake at [(2,5), (2,4)], head U.\n\nThen I can go to (2,2) or to (6,6).\n\nTo (2,2): from (2,5), head U, so I can move D, but D is opposite to U, so cannot move D for turn 3.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R (not D).\n\nMove L to (1,5), or R to (3,5), or U to (2,6) if possible.\n\ny=6 is not wall, (2,6) should be free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nTo go down to (2,2), I need to change direction.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen from (3,5), move D to (3,4) or something.\n\nBut (2,2) is at y=2, so from (2,5) to (2,2), I need to go down, but with body, I might collide if not careful, but currently body at (2,4), so if I move to (2,4), it would be body collision.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I move D to (2,4), but (2,4) is the tail, but when I move, the tail also moves, so it might be ok.\n\nTail reward danger rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, at turn 2, after eating (2,5), snake is [(2,5), (2,4)], head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nHead and tail are adjacent vertically.\n\nNow, the tail cell (2,4) does not have food; it's empty.\n\nFood is at other places.\n\nSo moving D to (2,4) would move head to (2,4), which is the current tail position.\n\nWhen head moves to the tail cell, since the tail will move away, it should be ok, no collision, because the tail moves to the next position.\n\nStandard snake rule: if head moves to the current tail cell, it is safe because the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nBut the tail reward danger is a special case when there is food on the tail cell.\n\nHere, no food on tail cell, so moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nSo from (2,5), move D to (2,4) is possible, and since no food at (2,4), no eat, so snake moves: head to (2,4), tail was at (2,4), but tail moves to where? Positions: before move, head (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nAfter move, head to (2,4), and the body segment (which is only one) moves to the previous head position (2,5), so new snake: head (2,4), body (2,5), so [(2,4), (2,5)].\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can move D to (2,3), no food, then to (2,2) to eat, and so on.\n\nBut let's focus on the first few turns.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, moving L to (2,3) is good to access both (2,2) and (2,5).\n\nBut (6,6) is also there, and it might be riskier to reach because of the obstacle.\n\nAnother option: move U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), no eat, snake at [(3,4)], direction U.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move L to (2,4) on turn 1, no eat, then U to (2,5) on turn 2 to eat.\n\nOr from (3,4) move U to (3,5), then to (2,5) or something.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (3,4), move L to (2,4), then U to (2,5).\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr move directly, but (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,4), so two steps.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,2) on turn 0, then to (2,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is close.\n\nTo maximize score, I should go for the closest food first.\n\n(2,2) is 2 steps away if I go directly: from (3,3) to (2,3) then to (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is 3 steps: e.g., to (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,5) or from (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5).\n\n(6,6) is 6 steps, but with the obstacle, I might need to go around, e.g., via (5,5) or (6,5).\n\nSince (6,4) is blocked, to reach (6,6), I can go to (5,6) then (6,6), or (6,5) then (6,6).\n\n(6,5) is free.\n\nBut from (3,3), it's far.\n\nLife span 10, so at turn 0, life span 10, after decrease at start, span 9, present.\n\nAt turn 9, it will have life span 1, then at turn 10 start, decrease to 0, removed.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is the last chance to eat.\n\nSince we have 10 turns, I have time to eat (6,6) later.\n\nBut I need to think about the sequence.\n\nFor long-term survival, I should eat food that allows me to have space to move.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (6,4), which blocks the bottom right, so the area near (6,6) might be cramped.\n\nAlso, with walls, the grid is small, 6x6 with one obstacle, so 35 cells, but snake can grow.\n\nBut for now, length 1.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (2,2) or (2,5) first to grow, then go to (6,6).\n\n(2,2) and (2,5) are both on the left side.\n\nAfter eating one, I can eat the other.\n\nBut after eating (2,2), I am at (2,2) with tail at (2,3) or something, and I need to go up to (2,5), but with direction constraint.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,5) first, I need to go down to (2,2).\n\nBut with the body, it might take time.\n\nLet's plan a sequence to eat both.\n\nStart at turn 0: move L to (2,3)  // no eat\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2)  // eat, snake grows to [(2,2), (2,3)], head D\n\nNow, to go to (2,5), I need to go up, but current direction D, so cannot move U for turn 2.\n\nI can move L or R or D.\n\nMove R to (3,2) for example.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2)  // no eat, snake at [(3,2), (2,2)] head R\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3)  // no eat, turn 3\n\nThen U to (3,4)  // no eat, turn 4\n\nThen L to (2,4)  // no eat, turn 5\n\nThen U to (2,5)  // eat at turn 6, snake grows.\n\nEaten (2,2) at turn 1, (2,5) at turn 6.\n\nThen I have (6,6) to eat.\n\nFrom (2,5), head U, move to (3,5) or something.\n\nBut (6,6) life span, at turn 6, life span was 10 at turn 0, decreased each turn.\n\nAt turn 0 start: life span decrease to 9, present\n\nTurn 1 start: decrease to 8, present\n\n...\n\nTurn k start: life span = 10 - k\n\nAt turn 6 start, life span = 10 - 6 = 4, decrease to 3, present.\n\nSo can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 6, I can go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (6,6): need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, turn 6: from (2,5) after eating (2,5), positions [(2,5), (2,4)]? When I eat at (2,5) on turn 6, snake was at [(2,4)] before move? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 5: snake at [(2,4)]? In my sequence, at turn 5: after moving to (2,4), no eat, so snake at [(2,4)]? No.\n\nLet's list positions turn by turn.\n\nTurn 0 start: snake [(3,3)], food life span 10, decrease to 9, present.\n\nTurn 0 action: move L to (2,3), no food, so new snake [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 1 start: food life span decrease to 8, present.\n\nTurn 1 action: move D to (2,2), has food, eat, grow, new snake: head (2,2), tail (2,3), so [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2 start: food life span decrease to 7 for remaining, but (2,2) eaten, so removed. (2,5) and (6,6) have life span 7 now.\n\nTurn 2 action: move R to (3,2), no food, new snake: head (3,2), body (2,2), so [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 3 start: life span decrease to 6 for (2,5) and (6,6)\n\nTurn 3 action: move U to (3,3), no food, new snake: head (3,3), body (3,2), so [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 4 start: life span 5\n\nTurn 4 action: move U to (3,4), no food, new snake: head (3,4), body (3,3), so [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5 start: life span 4\n\nTurn 5 action: move L to (2,4), no food, new snake: head (2,4), body (3,4), so [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 6 start: life span 3 for (2,5) and (6,6), decrease to 2, present.\n\nTurn 6 action: move U to (2,5), has food, eat, grow, new snake: head (2,5), body (2,4), and new segment, so [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]? When eating, the snake grows, so the body includes the previous positions.\n\nBefore move, snake at [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nMove head to (2,5), eat, so new head (2,5), and the body: the first body segment moves to previous head (2,4), and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail.\n\nBut in movement, when snake moves, the head moves forward, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if not eaten, tail moves away, but if eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo when head moves to food cell, it eats, and the snake grows, meaning the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the current tail position, but since the tail doesn't move, it stays, and the head moves to new cell with body extending.\n\nPositions: before move, snake positions S = [P0, P1, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n\nMove head to new cell Q.\n\nIf Q has food, eat: new head Q, then body [P0, P1, ..., Pk], so new positions [Q, P0, P1, ..., Pk], length k+2.\n\nIf no food, new positions [Q, P0, P1, ..., Pk-1], length k+1, tail removed.\n\nIn this case, at turn 6, before action, snake at [(2,4), (3,4)] with head (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nMove to (2,5), has food, eat, so new snake: head (2,5), then previous head (2,4), then previous tail (3,4), so [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), and I am at (2,5).\n\nI need to move right and up.\n\nHead direction U, so I can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nMove R to (3,5) on turn 7.\n\n(3,5) free, no food.\n\nNew snake: move to (3,5), no eat, so head to (3,5), body to (2,5), tail (2,4)? Positions before move: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nMove head to (3,5), no food, so new head (3,5), body: first segment to previous head (2,5), second to (2,4), tail (3,4) removed, so new positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen from (3,5), move R to (4,5), and so on to (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle, so from (6,5) to (6,6) is fine.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (3,5) no eat\n\nTurn 8: move R to (4,5) no eat\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,5) no eat\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,5) no eat\n\nTurn 11: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nBut at turn 10, what is life span of (6,6)?\n\nAt turn 0 start, life span 10, decrease to 9\n\nTurn 1: 8\n\n...\n\nTurn 9 start: life span = 10 - 9 =1, decrease to 0, so food removed, not present at turn 9.\n\nAt turn k start, life span decreases to 10 - k.\n\nAt turn 0: after decrease, 9\n\nTurn 1: 8\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: at start, decrease to 10-9=1? Let's index.\n\nAt turn 0 start: initial life span 10, decrease to 9, present for turn 0.\n\nTurn 1 start: life span 9 decrease to 8, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn m start: life span 10 - m decrease to 9 - m? Better to use the value.\n\nInitial at turn 0: life span L=10\n\nAfter decrease at turn start, L = L - 1 for that turn.\n\nAt turn 0 start: L=10, decrease to 9, present.\n\nTurn 1 start: L=9 for that food, decrease to 8, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn k start: L = 10 - k, decrease to 9 - k.\n\nFor the food to be present, after decrease, if L-1 >0, present.\n\nAt turn k start, current life span S, decrease to S-1.\n\nIf S-1 > 0, food present; if S-1 = 0, food removed.\n\nFor (6,6), at turn 0: S=10, decrease to 9>0, present.\n\nTurn 1: S=9, dec to 8>0, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 8: S=2 (since at turn 8 start, S=2, dec to 1>0, present)\n\nTurn 9: S=1, dec to 0, so food removed, not present for turn 9 move.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 8: at turn 8 start, S=2, dec to 1, present, so if move to it on turn 8, eat.\n\nTurn 9: removed.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 11, I move to (6,6), but turn 11 is too late, food gone by turn 9.\n\nTurn 8 is the last possible turn to eat (6,6).\n\nIn my earlier path, I am at (2,5) at turn 6, and (6,6) needs to be eaten by turn 8.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 6, to (6,6) is 4 steps Manhattan, but with body, I need to move efficiently.\n\nFrom (2,5) turn 6, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 6 action: move R to (3,5) no eat\n\nSnake: before move [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)], move to (3,5) no eat, new positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] head R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,5) no eat, new [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] head R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,5) no eat, new [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] head R\n\nNow, to reach (6,6), from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\n(6,6) is adjacent to (5,5)? (5,5) to (6,6) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I need to move to (6,5) or (5,6) first.\n\nSay move R to (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nBut turn 8: from (5,5), move R to (6,5), no food, new positions [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] head R\n\nThen turn 9: move U to (6,6), but at turn 9, (6,6) food is gone, as it was removed at turn 9 start.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (5,5), and (6,6) is adjacent but not directly reachable; I need to go to (6,5) or (5,6) first.\n\nAt turn 8, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), then on turn 9 to (6,6), but turn 9 food gone.\n\nOr move R to (6,5) on turn 8, then on turn 9 to (6,6) but gone.\n\nI cannot reach (6,6) by turn 8 from (5,5) because to eat at (6,6) on turn 8, I need to be adjacent and move to it on turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, if I am at (5,6) or (6,5), I can move to (6,6) on turn 8 to eat it.\n\nBut from turn 6 position (2,5), to (5,6) or (6,5) in two moves? From (2,5) to (6,5) is |2-6| + |5-5| =4 steps in x, same y, so at least 4 moves: to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n\nSimilarly to (5,6): from (2,5) to (5,6) is 3 in x, 1 in y, so 4 moves if not direct.\n\nMinimum 4 moves from (2,5) to (6,5) or (5,6).\n\nBut at turn 6, I move to (3,5), turn 7 to (4,5), turn 8 to (5,5), then at turn 8 I am at (5,5), not at (6,5) or (5,6), so I can move to (6,5) on turn 8, but (6,5) is not (6,6), so I don't eat (6,6) on turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9, food gone.\n\nSo I miss (6,6) if I eat (2,5) late.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (2,2) at turn 1 and (2,5) at turn 6, so (6,6) is not eaten.\n\nBut if I go for (6,6) first, it might be better.\n\nFor turn 0, instead of moving L, I could move U to (3,4) to go towards (6,6).\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) no eat, snake at [(3,4)] direction U\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nTo go to (6,6), I can move right and up.\n\nFor example, turn 1: move R to (4,4) no eat\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4) no eat\n\nBut (5,4) is free, then turn 3: move U to (5,5) no eat\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5) no eat\n\nTurn 5: move U to (6,6) eat at turn 5.\n\nLife span: at turn 5, for (6,6), at turn 5 start, life span = 10-5=5, dec to 4, present, so can be eaten.\n\nYes, eaten at turn 5.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2, positions: before move, snake at [(6,5)]? Let's track.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4), snake [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4), snake [(4,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4), snake [(5,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5), snake [(5,5)]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,5), snake [(6,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (6,6), eat, snake grows to [(6,6), (6,5)] head U.\n\nNow, I have eaten (6,6) at turn 5, and (2,2) and (2,5) are still there with life span.\n\nAt turn 5, for (2,2) and (2,5), life span: at turn 0 start, dec to 9, turn 1 dec to 8, ..., turn 5 start dec to 5, so life span 5, present.\n\nI can go to eat them.\n\nFrom (6,6), I can move towards left.\n\nBut (6,6) is corner, and with obstacle at (6,4), I need to go down or left.\n\nHead direction U, so can move L, R, U (not D).\n\nR to (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,6) or D but D not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (5,6) or possibly, but L is left.\n\nMove L to (5,6) on turn 6.\n\n(5,6) free, no food.\n\nSnake: before move [(6,6), (6,5)], move to (5,6) no eat, new positions [(5,6), (6,6)] head L.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6), etc.\n\nTo go to (2,2) or (2,5), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), which is closer than (2,2).\n\nFrom (5,6), move L to (4,6) turn 7, then to (3,6) turn 8, then to (2,6) turn 9, then D to (2,5) to eat at turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 10, life span of (2,5): at turn 10 start, life span = 10-10=0, dec to -1? At turn 10 start, S=0? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 0: S=10 dec to 9\n\nTurn 1: S=9 dec to 8\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: S=1 dec to 0, removed, not present turn 9.\n\nTurn 10: not present.\n\nSo last chance turn 8 for (2,5): at turn 8 start S=2 dec to 1, present.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2).\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 8, I am at (3,6) or something, not at (2,5).\n\nFrom turn 5 after eating (6,6), at (6,6), turn 6 move L to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7 move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 8 move L to (3,6)\n\nAt turn 8, I can move D to (3,5) or to (2,6) etc.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (3,6) move D to (3,5) on turn 8, no eat, then turn 9 move L to (2,5) but at turn 9, food gone.\n\nOr from (3,6) move L to (2,6) on turn 8, then turn 9 move D to (2,5) but turn 9 food gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,5) if I go for (6,6) first.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) might be easier to reach from some positions.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should eat the food on the left first, then go to (6,6) with more turns.\n\nIn the first approach, I ate (2,2) at turn 1 and (2,5) at turn 6, but missed (6,6).\n\nTo eat all three, I need a better path.\n\nPerhaps from turn 0, move towards (2,2) or (2,5) but in a way that I can head towards (6,6) after.\n\nAnother idea: move U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1 move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2 move U to (2,5) eat at turn 2.\n\nSnake: turn 0 move U to (3,4) no eat, snake [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1 move L to (2,4) no eat, snake [(2,4)]\n\nTurn 2 move U to (2,5) eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)] head U.\n\nNow at turn 2, I have eaten (2,5), and (2,2) and (6,6) are there.\n\nLife span at turn 2 start: for (2,2) and (6,6), after dec, S=8 (since turn 0 dec to9, turn1 to8, turn2 dec to7? At turn2 start, S=8 for these, dec to7.\n\nPresent.\n\nFrom (2,5), head U, I can move R to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen to (4,5) etc. towards (6,6).\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5) no eat, snake: before [(2,5), (2,4)], move to (3,5) no eat, new [(3,5), (2,5)] head R\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5) no eat, new [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5) no eat, new [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5) no eat, new [(6,5), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat at turn 7.\n\nLife span at turn 7: for (6,6), at turn7 start S=3 dec to2, present, so eaten.\n\nNow, I have eaten (2,5) and (6,6), but not (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is still there, but at turn 7, life span: at turn7 start, S=3 dec to2 for (2,2), present.\n\nFrom (6,6), after eating, snake at [(6,6), (6,5)] head U.\n\nThen I can move L to (5,6) turn 8, then down to (5,5), etc. to go to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) at (2,2), from (6,6) it's far.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (5,6) no eat, new [(5,6), (6,6)] head L\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,5) no eat, new [(5,5), (5,6)] head D\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5) no eat, new [(4,5), (5,5)] head L\n\nAnd so on, to reach (2,2) takes many turns, and life span of (2,2): at turn 10 start, S=0? Turn 0 S=10 dec to9, turn1 to8, ..., turn9 S=1 dec to0, removed turn9.\n\nSo at turn 10, not present, so I cannot eat (2,2) if I go this way.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate two food, missed one.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,2) first, I might miss (6,6).\n\nTo eat all three, I need to eat (2,2) or (2,5) quickly, then (6,6), but (6,6) must be eaten by turn 8, so I need to start towards it early.\n\nPerhaps eat (2,2) at turn 1, then directly to (6,6).\n\nFrom turn 0: move L to (2,3) no eat\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) eat, snake [(2,2), (2,3)] head D\n\nThen from (2,2), head D, can move L, R, D.\n\nMove R to (3,2) turn 2\n\nThen U to (3,3) turn 3\n\nThen R to (4,3) turn 4\n\nBut to go to (6,6), I need to go up and right.\n\nFrom (3,2), move R to (4,2) turn 2? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2) move R to (3,2) no eat, snake [(3,2), (2,2)] head R\n\nTurn 3: move U to (3,3) no eat, snake [(3,3), (3,2)] head U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4) no eat, snake [(3,4), (3,3)] head U\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4) no eat, snake [(4,4), (3,4)] head R\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4) no eat, snake [(5,4), (4,4)] head R\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,5) no eat, snake [(5,5), (5,4)] head U\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, snake [(6,5), (5,5)] head R\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) but at turn 9, food gone.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (6,5), can move U to (6,6) on turn 8 to eat.\n\nTurn 8 action: from (6,5) move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nIn turn 7, I am at (5,5), move U to (5,5)? Turn 7: from (5,4) move U to (5,5), no eat, positions [(5,5), (5,4)] head U\n\nThen turn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, positions [(6,5), (5,5)] head R\n\nThen turn 9: move U to (6,6) but turn 9 food gone.\n\nAt turn 8, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) on turn 8, then not to (6,6).\n\nTo eat (6,6) on turn 8, I need to move to it on turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 7 position (5,5), I can move R to (6,5) on turn 8, but (6,5) is not (6,6), so I don't eat.\n\nOr move U to (5,6) on turn 8, not to (6,6).\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,6) on turn 8 from earlier positions if I start from left.\n\nThe only way to eat (6,6) is to go directly towards it from the beginning.\n\nFor turn 0, move U to (3,4) or something.\n\nBut with current direction L, I can move U or D or L.\n\nMove U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n\nThen as before, I can reach (6,6) by turn 5.\n\nThen from there, I can try to eat (2,2) or (2,5).\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), from (6,6) it's far, and life span short.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,2) on the way, but (2,2) is at bottom left, (6,6) top right, not on the way.\n\nAnother idea: move D to (3,2) on turn 0 to go towards (2,2).\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2) no eat, snake [(3,2)] direction D\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,2) eat, snake [(2,2), (3,2)] head L\n\nThen from here, I can go towards (6,6) but it will take time, and I might not reach by turn 8.\n\nTurn 1: after eating (2,2) at turn 1, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)] head L\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3) no eat, snake [(2,3), (2,2)] head U\n\nTurn 3: move U to (2,4) no eat, snake [(2,4), (2,3)] head U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5) eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] head U  // eaten (2,5) at turn 4\n\nThen from (2,5), go to (6,6) but as before, not by turn 8.\n\nAt turn 4, (6,6) life span at turn4 start S=6 dec to5, so I have until turn 8 to eat.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 4, to (6,6) in 4 steps: move R to (3,5) turn 5, R to (4,5) turn 6, R to (5,5) turn 7, R to (6,5) turn 8, then U to (6,6) turn 9 too late.\n\nFrom (6,5) on turn 8, I can move U to (6,6) on turn 8 if possible, but on turn 8 I am at (6,5) only if I move directly, but from (5,5) on turn 7, move to (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5) move R to (3,5) no eat, snake: before [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], move to (3,5) no eat, new [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] head R\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5) no eat, new [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] head R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5) no eat, new [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] head R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, new [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] head R\n\nThen turn 9: move U to (6,6) but food gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,6) if I eat the left food first.\n\nTherefore, to maximize score, I should go for (6,6) first since it's farther and time-sensitive, then eat the other food if possible.\n\nBut the other food also have life span, but they are closer, so after eating (6,6), I might be able to eat one of them.\n\nFor example, from earlier, after eating (6,6) at turn 5, snake at [(6,6), (6,5)] head U\n\nThen I can go to (2,5) or (2,2).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), life span at turn 5 start S=5 dec to4, so until turn 8.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (2,5): need to go left and down.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (5,6) no eat, snake [(5,6), (6,6)] head L\n\nTurn 7: move L to (4,6) no eat, snake [(4,6), (5,6)] head L\n\nTurn 8: move L to (3,6) no eat, snake [(3,6), (4,6)] head L\n\nTurn 9: move D to (3,5) no eat, snake [(3,5), (3,6)] head D\n\nTurn 10: move L to (2,5) but at turn 10, food gone, and at turn 9, (2,5) not present.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (3,6), can move D to (3,5) on turn 8, then turn 9 move L to (2,5) but turn 9 food gone.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2).\n\nSo with this, I can only eat one or two food, not all three.\n\nBut the grid is small, and with planning, I might eat two.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can eat (2,2) or (2,5) very quickly, then go to (6,6).\n\nLet's calculate the earliest I can eat (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), move L to (2,3) turn 0, then D to (2,2) turn 1, eaten at turn 1.\n\nSimilarly, eat (2,5): from (3,3), move U to (3,4) turn 0, then L to (2,4) turn 1, then U to (2,5) turn 2, eaten turn 2.\n\nOr from (3,3) move L to (2,3) turn 0, then U to (2,4) turn 1, U to (2,5) turn 2.\n\nSo (2,2) can be eaten at turn 1, (2,5) at turn 2.\n\n(6,6) can be eaten as early as turn 5 if I go directly.\n\nBut after eating (2,2) at turn 1, I am at (2,2), then I need to go to (6,6), which takes at least 5 moves to (6,6), so turn 6 or 7.\n\nTurn 1: after eating (2,2), snake at [(2,2), (2,3)] head D or L? After moving to (2,2) from (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen from (2,2), move R to (3,2) turn 2\n\nThen U to (3,3) turn 3\n\nThen U to (3,4) turn 4\n\nThen R to (4,4) turn 5\n\nThen R to (5,4) turn 6\n\nThen U to (5,5) turn 7\n\nThen R to (6,5) turn 8\n\nThen U to (6,6) turn 9 too late.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, move R to (6,5) turn 8, then not to (6,6).\n\nTo reach (6,6) by turn 8, I need to be at a adjacent cell by turn 7.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, be at (6,5) or (5,6), then move to (6,6) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 1, to (6,5) in 6 moves: for example, move to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) turn 7, then turn 8 move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nTurn 1: at (2,2) with body (2,3)\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) no eat, snake [(3,2), (2,2)] head R\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2) no eat, snake [(4,2), (3,2)] head R\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,2) no eat, snake [(5,2), (4,2)] head R\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,3) no eat, snake [(5,3), (5,2)] head U\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,4) no eat, snake [(5,4), (5,3)] head U\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,5) no eat, snake [(5,5), (5,4)] head U\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, snake [(6,5), (5,5)] head R\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) but food gone.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (6,5), can move U to (6,6) on turn 8 if I am at (6,5) on turn 8, but to move to (6,6) on turn 8, I need to be at (6,5) or (5,6) at turn 7.\n\nIn this, at turn 7 I am at (5,5), not at (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 6, move R to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle! I forgot the obstacle at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is wall, so I cannot go to (6,4).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (6,5) or (5,5), etc.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6: from (5,3) move U to (5,4) no eat, positions [(5,4), (5,3)] head U\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (5,5) no eat, positions [(5,5), (5,4)] head U\n\nThen turn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, positions [(6,5), (5,5)] head R\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) gone.\n\nTo reach (6,5) by turn 7, from (5,2) on turn 4, move U to (5,3) turn 5, U to (5,4) turn 6, then to (6,5) from (5,4) is not adjacent; (5,4) to (6,5) is diagonal, not possible, so move to (5,5) first or (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so only to (5,5) or (6,5) from (5,4) is not direct.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move R to (6,5)? (6,5) is adjacent to (5,4)? (5,4) and (6,5) are not adjacent; adjacent cells are same x or same y.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so possible U, D, L.\n\nCannot move directly to (6,5).\n\nSo to reach (6,5), I need to go to (5,5) or (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nSo minimum from (5,4) to (6,5): to (5,5) then to (6,5), two moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) at turn 1, to (6,5) takes at least 6 moves: e.g., to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) turn 7, then turn 8 to (6,6).\n\nBut at turn 7 I am at (6,5), turn 8 move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nAt turn 8, food is present: at turn 8 start, S=2 dec to1, present, so yes, can eat at turn 8.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, S=10 dec to9\nTurn 1, S=9 dec to8\n...\nTurn 7, S=3 dec to2\nTurn 8, S=2 dec to1, present, so if move to it on turn 8, eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3) no eat\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) eat (2,2), snake [(2,2), (2,3)] head D\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) no eat, snake [(3,2), (2,2)] head R\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2) no eat, snake [(4,2), (3,2)] head R\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,2) no eat, snake [(5,2), (4,2)] head R\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,3) no eat, snake [(5,3), (5,2)] head U\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,4) no eat, snake [(5,4), (5,3)] head U\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,5) no eat, snake [(5,5), (5,4)] head U\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, snake [(6,5), (5,5)] head R\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) but turn 9 food gone, not present.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (6,5), and (6,6) is above, so on turn 8, from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nTurn 8 action: from (6,5) move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nIn the positions, at turn 7, snake at [(5,5), (5,4)] head U\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,6)? No, to go to (6,6), from (5,5), move R to (6,5) or U to (5,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,5) on turn 8, then I am at (6,5), not at (6,6).\n\nTo eat (6,6) on turn 8, I need to move to it directly on turn 8.\n\nSo at turn 7, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,6), like (5,6) or (6,5).\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 7, I am at (5,5), which is adjacent to (5,6) and (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, I can move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nThen on turn 8, from (5,6) move R to (6,6) or from (6,5) move U to (6,6).\n\nSay turn 7: move R to (6,5) no eat, positions [(6,5), (5,5)] head R\n\nThen turn 8: move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nYes, at turn 8, eat (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,6) on turn 7, then to (6,6) on turn 8.\n\nBut in this case, I can eat (2,2) at turn 1 and (6,6) at turn 8.\n\nBut I missed (2,5), which expired at turn 8 or 9.\n\nAt turn 8, (2,5) is gone, but I have eaten two food.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (2,5) first, I can eat (6,6) later.\n\nBut (2,5) can be eaten at turn 2, then to (6,6) by turn 8.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) no eat\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4) no eat\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)] head U\n\nThen from (2,5), move R to (3,5) turn 3\n\nR to (4,5) turn 4\n\nR to (5,5) turn 5\n\nR to (6,5) turn 6\n\nThen on turn 7, move U to (6,6) but at turn 7, (6,6) life span S=3 dec to2, present, so eat at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: from (6,5) move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSo eaten (2,5) at turn 2 and (6,6) at turn 7.\n\nMissed (2,2), which is still there but not eaten.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat two food.\n\nTo eat all three, it might not be possible with the time, because (2,2) and (2,5) are on opposite sides of the snake.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,3), I can eat one quickly, but the other might expire.\n\nBut life span is 10, so at turn 0, all have 10, decrease to 9, etc.\n\nIf I eat (2,2) at turn 1, then (2,5) at turn 4 or something, then (6,6) by turn 8.\n\nFrom after eating (2,2) at turn 1, snake at [(2,2), (2,3)] head D\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,3) but (2,3) is the tail, but moving to tail cell is safe if no food.\n\nMove U to (2,3), no food, so new positions: head to (2,3), body to (2,2), so [(2,3), (2,2)] head U\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (2,4) no eat, snake [(2,4), (2,3)] head U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5) eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] head U  // eaten (2,5) at turn 4\n\nThen from here, to (6,6) as before, can reach by turn 8 with careful path.\n\nTurn 4: at (2,5) with body (2,4), (2,3)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5) no eat, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] head R\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5) no eat, snake [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] head R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5) no eat, snake [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] head R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5) no eat, snake [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] head R\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6) but turn 9 food gone.\n\nAt turn 8, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nTo eat (6,6) on turn 8, from (5,5) at turn 7, move U to (5,6) on turn 8? No.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at (5,5), move R to (6,5) on turn 8, then not to (6,6).\n\nOr move U to (5,6) on turn 8, then not to (6,6).\n\nSo I cannot move to (6,6) on turn 8 from turn 7 position.\n\nThe only way is to be at (5,6) or (6,5) at turn 7, then move to (6,6) on turn 8.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 7, I am at (5,5), which is not adjacent to (6,6) for direct move.\n\nSo from (5,5), I can only move to (5,6) or (6,5) on turn 8, then to (6,6) on turn 9 too late.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to eat all three within the life span.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat two food.\n\nFor example, eat (2,2) and (6,6) or (2,5) and (6,6).\n\nSince (2,5) is at the top, and (6,6) also top, it might be better to eat (2,5) and (6,6).\n\nOr (2,2) and (6,6).\n\nBut (2,2) is bottom, (6,6) top.\n\nIn terms of score, both give +1.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating, I have more body, so need to avoid self-collision.\n\nBut for now, with length 2 or 3, it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to provide actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nSince the current turn is 0, and I need to think ahead, I should choose a sequence that gets me to eat food safely.\n\nLet's go for eating (2,5) and (6,6).\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)  // to go towards (2,5) and then right\n\nThen turn 1: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for turns starting from 0, at least 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 0 to turn 4 or more.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R (not in 5 turns, but I can provide up to turn 4 or 5.\n\nThe answer should be for multiple turns as per format.\n\nSince the snake is short, no immediate risk, so this is fine.\n\nI could go directly to (6,6) but with current direction L, I have to move U, D, or L first.\n\nMove U to (3,4) then right.\n\nOr move L to (2,3) then down to (2,2) or up.\n\nBut for (6,6), moving U first is better.\n\nSo I think move U on turn 0.\n\nThen the sequence as above.\n\nBut for the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 0, action must be U, D, or L, not R.\n\nSo let's box the answer.\n\nBut the format is to provide actions for several turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be the actions for the current and next turns.\n\nFor this state, turn 0, I move U.\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan, but the output should include them.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U (eat at (2,5))\n\nThen turn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\n Etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 2, I eat, so for turn 3, from (2,5), head U, I can move R to (3,5).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSimilarly, if I want to eat (2,2) first, turn 0 move L, turn 1 move D, etc.\n\nBut for (6,6), it might be tight.\n\nSince all food is positive, and no negative food mentioned, so no penalty.\n\nAlso, no other risks yet.\n\nSo I think moving U on turn 0 is fine.\n\nThen the actions.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: R\n}\n\nThis gets me to eat (2,5) at turn 2, then moving right towards (6,6).\n\nFor long-term, I can continue to eat (6,6) at turn 7.\n\nBut for the output, up to turn 4 is ok, or more if I want.\n\nThe format doesn't specify how many turns, but at least the current and some ahead.\n\nI think 5 turns are sufficient for now.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- The snake starts at position (3,3) with head direction left (L), so on turn 0, I cannot move right (R) due to the no-instant-reverse rule.\n- All food has a life span of 10, decreasing each turn (including turn 0), so they disappear after turn 9 if not eaten. The food positions are (2,5), (2,2), and (6,6), all with value +1.\n- The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (6,4), so movement is constrained to cells (1,1) to (6,6) except (6,4).\n- With a short snake (length 1), collision risks are minimal initially, but after eating, growth must be managed to avoid future self-collision.\n- After simulating paths, eating (2,5) and (6,6) is prioritized as they are on the upper side, allowing efficient movement. (2,2) is riskier to include due to life span constraints and path inefficiency, so it may be skipped to ensure (6,6) is eaten in time.\n\n**Planned Sequence (Turns 0-4):**\n- **Turn 0 (current turn): Move Up (U)** to (3,4). This moves towards (2,5) and avoids the reverse direction constraint (current direction L, so U is allowed). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 1: Move Left (L)** to (2,4). This positions the snake closer to (2,5). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 2: Move Up (U)** to (2,5). This eats the food at (2,5), increasing score by +1 and snake length to 2. Snake positions: head (2,5), body (2,4). Head direction is now U.\n- **Turn 3: Move Right (R)** to (3,5). This starts the path toward (6,6). Head direction U allows R (not opposite). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 4: Move Right (R)** to (4,5). This continues toward (6,6). Head direction is now R. No food eaten.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Long-term path:** After turn 4, the plan is to continue right to (5,5) on turn 5, then to (6,5) on turn 6, and finally to (6,6) on turn 7 to eat the food there. This ensures (6,6) is eaten by turn 7 (life span allows eating through turn 8, but this path is safe and efficient).\n- **Risks avoided:** \n  - The obstacle at (6,4) is bypassed by moving via (5,5) and (6,5).\n  - After growing, the snake must avoid moving into its body, but this path keeps the body trailing and minimizes tight spaces.\n  - (2,2) is not targeted as it would require a detour, risking (6,6) expiration and potential dead ends.\n- **Survival priority:** Eating (2,5) early provides growth for flexibility, and heading directly to (6,6) ensures it is eaten before expiration. The grid has open space after turn 4 for further movement without immediate collision risks.\n- **Alternative considered:** Moving toward (2,2) first (e.g., L on turn 0, D on turn 1) was rejected as it delays reaching (6,6), risking its expiration due to life span.\n\n**Output:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U  \nTurn 1: L  \nTurn 2: U  \nTurn 3: R  \nTurn 4: R  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and the grid has walls. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\nThe snake positions are given as [(1,4)], but that seems odd. It says [(1,4)], which might imply that the snake has only one segment, the head. Let me check: \"Snake Positions: [(1,4)]\" – yes, it's a list with one element, so the snake is just the head at (1,4). That means the snake has no body segments yet; it's just the head. So, when it eats food, it will grow.\n\nThe head direction is \"U\", so it's facing up.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (2,2) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (2,1) with life span 8, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, and life span 7 or 8. Since it's turn 3, the life span decreases each turn, including the current one. So for the first three foods, life span 7 at turn 3 means they will disappear after turn 9? Let me calculate the expiration turn.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn t, a food with life span L will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf a food has life span L at turn t, it means:\n\n- At turn t, life span L\n\n- Turn t+1, life span L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + L - 1, life span 1\n\n- After that, it disappears, so not present on turn t + L.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Food at (2,5): life span 7 at turn 3, so it will be present from turn 3 to turn 9 (since 3 + 7 - 1 = 9, disappears on turn 10).\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (2,2): life span 7 at turn 3, present until turn 9\n\n- (6,6): life span 7 at turn 3, present until turn 9\n\n- (2,1): life span 8 at turn 3, present until turn 10 (3 + 8 - 1 = 10)\n\nNow, the snake is at (1,4) with direction Up. Since there's no body, I don't have to worry about body collisions yet. Also, because it's only the head, when it eats food, it will grow, so after eating, the body segments will appear.\n\nThe head direction is Up, so from (1,4), moving Up would go to (1,5), Down to (1,3), Left to (0,4), Right to (2,4).\n\nBut walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving Left to (0,4) is a wall, so invalid. Similarly, moving Down to (1,3) is fine since y=3 is not border yet? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y from 1 to 6 are safe? No.\n\nGrid coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But here, movement: U is (x,y+1), so if y increases up, then (0,0) is bottom-left, and y=7 is top row.\n\nIn the state, it says \"U(x,y+1)\", so y+1 is up, meaning y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No.\n\nIt says \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell. Therefore, the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6, I think? x and y from 0 to 7, but walls at boundaries, so valid positions are (x,y) with 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6? Let's see.\n\nFor example, (1,4) is given, which is x=1, y=4. Since x=0 is wall, x=1 is not wall, similarly y=4 not wall. So the inner grid is from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are safe, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nx=0 wall, x=7 wall, so x from 1 to 6.\n\ny=0 wall, y=7 wall, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nBut in the food, (2,5) y=5, (2,2) y=2, (6,6) y=6, (2,1) y=1. y=1 is not wall? y=0 is wall, so y=1 should be playable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has y=1, which is above y=0 wall, so it should be valid.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (6,4), which is within the grid.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (6,4) which is obstacle.\n\nNow snake at (1,4), head.\n\nPossible moves from (1,4):\n\n- Up: (1,5) - y=5 <=6, and not wall, so valid.\n\n- Down: (1,3) - y=3 >=1, valid.\n\n- Left: (0,4) - x=0, which is wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: (2,4) - x=2 <=6, valid.\n\nBut head direction is U, so if I move Down, that would be opposite direction? The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is U (up). Moving opposite would be D (down). So if I move down, is that allowed? Since the snake has no body, moving down might be possible, but the rule is about not moving opposite on the next turn. Here, from current state, I can choose any direction except opposite if it were moving, but since it's the first move or something.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nBut \"next turn\" refers to the turn after the current state? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell... Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nThe current state has a direction, which is the direction the head is facing.\n\nFor turn t, based on the head direction, I cannot choose the opposite direction for the move.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R, then next turn I cannot move L, and so on.\n\nSo for turn 3, current direction U, so I cannot move D.\n\nTherefore, possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- U: to (1,5)\n\n- D: invalid, because opposite direction.\n\n- L: to (0,4) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R: to (2,4) valid.\n\nSo only possible moves are U or R.\n\nL is invalid because wall, D is invalid because opposite direction.\n\nSo I can go Up to (1,5) or Right to (2,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survive.\n\nFirst, what are the food positions:\n\n- (2,5) - value +1, life span 7 at turn 3, so until turn 9\n\n- (2,2) - +1, until turn 9\n\n- (6,6) - +1, until turn 9\n\n- (2,1) - +1, until turn 10\n\nAll are positive, no negative food here.\n\nSince the snake is short (only head), eating food will make it grow, but I need to be careful about future collisions.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But now, no tail, so not an issue.\n\nFirst, let's list possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (1,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen position: (1,5)\n\nDirection: U (since I moved up)\n\nNow, from (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,6) - y=6, which is not wall, y=7 is wall, so (1,6) is valid.\n\n- D to (1,4) - but (1,4) was previous position, but since no body, it's empty now. But moving down would be opposite to current direction U? After moving to (1,5), direction is U, so cannot move D.\n\n- L to (0,5) - x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,5) - valid, and there is food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I move to (2,5), I eat it.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, on turn 3, move to (1,5).\n\nThen on turn 4, from (1,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6), or R to (2,5) (since L and D invalid or opposite).\n\nD is opposite, invalid; L is wall.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (2,5), I eat the food. Since I eat, the snake grows, so after eating, the snake will have a body segment at the previous position, which is (1,5). So positions: head at (2,5), body at (1,5). Direction now R.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5) but (1,5) is body, so collision if I move there? Body collision.\n\nLet's see: if I move L to (1,5), it's occupied by body, so collision, death.\n\nCannot move to body segment.\n\nAlso, R to (3,5), but direction is R, so moving R is forward, L is opposite, so cannot move L anyway because opposite direction.\n\nCurrent direction R, cannot move L (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R.\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5).\n\nL to (1,5) is invalid because opposite and also body.\n\nSo from (2,5), I can go U, D, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), or D to (2,4), or R to (3,5).\n\nNow, from (1,5) on turn 4, if instead I go U to (1,6).\n\nThen position (1,6), direction U.\n\nOn turn 5, from (1,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) - opposite, invalid.\n\nL to (0,6) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6) - valid.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nThen at (2,6), no food, I think? Food at (2,5), (2,2), etc., not (2,6).\n\nSo snake head at (2,6), body at (1,6) and previous? When I moved to (1,6) on turn 4, from (1,5), so the body: on turn 3, snake at (1,4), moved to (1,5) turn 4, so body at (1,4)? Let's track positions.\n\nStart turn 3: snake at [(1,4)]\n\nMove U to (1,5) on turn 3? No, the action is for the turn.\n\nState at turn 3, I choose action for turn 3.\n\nSo on turn 3, I move to new position.\n\nBefore move, positions: [(1,4)]\n\nAfter move, if I choose U, new head at (1,5), and since no food eaten, snake still length 1 at [(1,5)].\n\nI need to simulate the growth.\n\nWhen I eat food, I grow.\n\nIn this case, on turn 3, if I move to (1,5), no food there, so snake remains at [(1,5)].\n\nThen on turn 4, from (1,5), I can move to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\nIf I move to (2,5), there is food, so I eat it, grow. So after eating, head at (2,5), and new tail segment added where? The body segments: before move, snake was at [(1,5)], so after moving to (2,5) and eating, the snake becomes [(2,5), (1,5)] so head at (2,5), body at (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 4 I move to (1,6), no food, snake at [(1,6)].\n\nBack to turn 3 choice.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving Right from (1,4) on turn 3.\n\nMove R to (2,4).\n\nPosition (2,4), and there is no food at (2,4)? Food are at (2,5), (2,2), etc., not (2,4), so no eat.\n\nSnake still at [(2,4)], direction now R (since I moved right).\n\nOn turn 4, from (2,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nL is opposite to R, so cannot move L.\n\nU, D, R possible.\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I go U, I eat it.\n\nD to (2,3), no food.\n\nR to (3,4), no food.\n\nIf I go U to (2,5), eat food, grow. Snake now head at (2,5), body at (2,4)? Before move, snake at [(2,4)], move to (2,5), eat, so positions: [(2,5), (2,4)].\n\nDirection now U.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, collision, invalid. Also D is opposite to U? Current direction U, so D is opposite, cannot move anyway.\n\nL to (1,5), no body, valid? L is left, not opposite to U, U is up, so L is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R are all possible except opposite and walls.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nCan move U (up), L (left), R (right).\n\nFrom (2,5), U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(2,4) is body, so cannot move there, and D is invalid anyway.\n\nIf I go L to (1,5), no food, snake moves, tail follows, so positions: head to (1,5), body from (2,5) to (2,4)? Let's see: before move, snake at [(2,5), (2,4)].\n\nAfter moving head to (1,5), the body segments follow: the segment at (2,5) moves to where the head was? Standard snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo head moves to new cell, then the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n\nHere, positions: index 0 head, 1 tail.\n\nAfter head moves to (1,5), the tail (which was at (2,4)) moves to the previous position of the head, which was (2,5).\n\nSo new positions: head at (1,5), tail at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is now the tail.\n\nAnd (2,4) is empty now.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (2,6), head to (2,6), tail to (2,5).\n\nOr R to (3,5), head to (3,5), tail to (2,5).\n\nNow, back to turn 3 decision.\n\nI need to think about getting food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,1) has longer life, but it's farther.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, from (1,4), if I go Up to (1,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen on turn 4, from (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go R to (2,5), I eat the food at (2,5), snake grows to two segments: head at (2,5), tail at (1,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,5), direction R, I can go U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but D invalid opposite? Direction R, so can go U, D, or R? U is up, D is down, R is right, L is left opposite, invalid.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\n(2,4) is empty now, since tail moved.\n\nIf I go D to (2,4), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,4), tail to (2,5)? Positions: before, head (2,5), tail (1,5).\n\nAfter move D to (2,4), head to (2,4), then tail moves to (2,5), so snake at [(2,4), (2,5)].\n\nDirection now D.\n\n(2,4) has no food.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut I have food at (2,2), which is below.\n\nIf on turn 5 from (2,5) I go U to (2,6), no food, head to (2,6), tail to (2,5), snake at [(2,6), (2,5)].\n\nThen from (2,6), direction U, can go U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (2,5) body, collision; L to (1,6) possible; R to (3,6) possible.\n\nOnly L or R.\n\nSay go L to (1,6), then to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,2).\n\nIf from (1,5) on turn 4, I go U to (1,6) instead of R to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 4, move U to (1,6), no food, snake at [(1,6)].\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 5, from (1,6), only possible move R to (2,6), as before.\n\nThen at (2,6), no food, snake at [(2,6)] if still length 1, or if I ate earlier.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat yet, so on turn 5, snake at (2,6), direction from moving right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go U to (2,7) invalid, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6).\n\nD to (2,5) is possible, and there is food at (2,5).\n\nSo if I go D to (2,5), I eat the food, grow. Snake was length 1 at [(2,6)], move to (2,5), eat, so now head at (2,5), tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut the food at (2,5) is still there, life until turn 9, so I can eat it later.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option on turn 3: move Right to (2,4).\n\nOn turn 3, move R to (2,4), no food, snake at [(2,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 4, from (2,4), direction R, can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), R to (3,4).\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I go U, I eat it, grow to head (2,5), tail (2,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,5), direction U, can go U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nD invalid.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), no food, head to (2,6), tail to (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,6), as before, can go L or R or D but D to (2,5) body, invalid.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go L to (1,5), no food, head to (1,5), tail to (2,5).\n\nThen at (1,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut I have food at (2,2) below.\n\nAlso, food at (6,6) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at the bottom, y=1.\n\nSince the grid is small, and I need to maximize score, I should aim to eat all food if possible, but avoid risks.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (6,4), it might block paths.\n\nLet's list all food:\n\n- (2,5): near, can be eaten soon\n\n- (2,2): below, need to go down\n\n- (6,6): far, top-right\n\n- (2,1): bottom, below (2,2)\n\nAlso, the snake is at (1,4), so (2,5) is close.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) soon, I grow, then I can go down to (2,2) and (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) has longer life, until turn 10, so I can save it for later.\n\n(6,6) is at the corner, might be risky if the snake is long.\n\nBut now snake is short, so I can go there.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (6,4), so from left, I need to go around it to reach (6,6).\n\nFor example, to go to (6,6) from (1,4), I might go right and up.\n\nBut let's think about the map.\n\nGrid:\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, wall at borders.\n\nObstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) blocked.\n\nCells: for example, row y=6: (1,6) to (6,6), but (6,4) blocked, not on y=6.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nSo to reach (6,6), I can go through (5,6) or (6,5), but (6,5) is above (6,4), and (6,4) blocked, but (6,5) is ok.\n\n(6,5) is not blocked, only (6,4) is obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) etc are free.\n\nNow, back to turn 3.\n\nI need to choose between U and R for turn 3.\n\nIf I go U to (1,5), then on turn 4, I can go to (2,5) to eat, or to (1,6).\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 4, I eat, grow to length 2.\n\nThen on turn 5, I need to move from (2,5).\n\nI can go down to (2,4), or up to (2,6), or right to (3,5).\n\nIf I go down to (2,4), then I can continue down to (2,3), (2,2) to eat the food there.\n\n(2,2) has food.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) I can go to (2,1) for another food.\n\n(2,1) is at y=1, which is above wall y=0, so valid.\n\nAfter eating (2,2), I grow, then to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) has food, eat again.\n\nThen I have three foods eaten, and snake length 4 or something.\n\nThen I can go to (6,6) for the last food.\n\nBut (6,6) is at top-right, and with obstacle, it might be tight.\n\nIf on turn 3 I go R to (2,4), then on turn 4 I can go U to (2,5) to eat, or down to (2,3), or right to (3,4).\n\nIf I go U to (2,5), same as above, eat, then I'm at (2,5) with body (2,4), then I can go down to (2,3) etc.\n\nSimilar to first option.\n\nIf from (2,4) on turn 4, I go down to (2,3), no food, then to (2,2) on next turn to eat, but on turn 4 from (2,4), if I go D to (2,3), no food, snake at [(2,3)], direction D.\n\nThen turn 5, from (2,3), can go U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(2,2) has food, so go D to (2,2), eat, grow to head (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,1) to eat that food.\n\n(2,1) below.\n\nGo D to (2,1), eat, grow again.\n\nSo I can eat (2,2) and (2,1) quickly.\n\nThen I have (2,5) and (6,6) left.\n\n(2,5) is up, so I need to go up.\n\nBut after eating (2,1), I'm at (2,1), with body segments.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,1), head at (2,1), tail at (2,2), and previous body.\n\nSequence: suppose on turn 4, I went from (2,4) to (2,3) no eat, turn 5 to (2,2) eat, so snake: head (2,2), tail (2,3)? Before move to (2,2), snake at [(2,3)] length 1, move to (2,2) eat, so head (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 6, from (2,2), can go U to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, collision, or D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\nU to (2,3) is body and also opposite to current direction? Current direction D, U is opposite, so cannot move U anyway.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,1), there is food, so go D to (2,1), eat, grow. Head to (2,1), tail added, so positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), and previous tail? Before move, snake at [(2,2), (2,3)]? After eating at (2,2), snake is [(2,2), (2,3)].\n\nMove to (2,1), eat, so new head (2,1), and new tail segment added, so snake becomes [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)].\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (2,1), I need to go to other foods.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, so up.\n\nBut from (2,1), with body at (2,2) and (2,3), if I go U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, collision.\n\nCannot go U.\n\nCan go L to (1,1), or R to (3,1), or D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut (2,5) is above, and I have to avoid the body.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten (2,5) first, then gone down, I might have more space.\n\nBut in both cases, after eating the bottom foods, I might be trapped at bottom if the body is there.\n\nLet's compare the two turn 3 choices.\n\nFirst, if on turn 3 I go U to (1,5):\n\n- Turn 3: move U to (1,5), no eat, snake [(1,5)], dir U\n\n- Turn 4: move R to (2,5), eat, snake [(2,5), (1,5)], dir R\n\n- Turn 5: from (2,5), dir R, can go D to (2,4) (no food), or U to (2,6) (no food), or R to (3,5) (no food)\n\nIf go D to (2,4), snake moves: head to (2,4), tail to (2,5), so [(2,4), (2,5)], dir D\n\n- Turn 6: from (2,4), dir D, can go D to (2,3) (no food), L to (1,4), R to (3,4)\n\nGo D to (2,3), snake [(2,3), (2,4)], dir D\n\n- Turn 7: from (2,3), dir D, can go D to (2,2), there is food, so eat, grow. Head to (2,2), tail to (2,3), but after eating, new segment, so snake [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]? Before move, snake [(2,3), (2,4)], head at (2,3), move to (2,2) eat, so head (2,2), and new tail added where the tail was or at previous position? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, new segment added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nPositions: before move, segments: [head (2,3), tail (2,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2) and eating, new segment is added, so the tail stays, and new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nTypically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows by one cell.\n\nBut in this case, since there was a tail, it stays, and new segment is added behind.\n\nLet's clarify the growth mechanic.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd in movement, when not eating, head moves, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, but the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the end, effectively growing.\n\nFor example, snake positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to new cell D, no eat: new positions [D, A, B], C is removed.\n\nMove to D with eat: new positions [D, A, B, C], C is still there, new segment.\n\nIn terms of positions, the tail position is retained.\n\nIn our earlier: on turn 6, snake at [(2,3), (2,4)] with (2,3) head, (2,4) tail.\n\nMove to (2,2) with eat: new head at (2,2), new positions: head (2,2), then the previous head becomes body, so body at (2,3), and tail at (2,4) remains, but since growing, a new segment is added, so positions become [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)].\n\nYes, three segments.\n\nSimilarly, if no eat, move to (2,2) no food, then new positions [(2,2), (2,3)], and (2,4) removed.\n\nBack to turn 7: from (2,3), move to (2,2) eat, so snake [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] with head at (2,2), dir D.\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,2), can go D to (2,1), there is food, so move to (2,1) eat, grow. New head (2,1), new positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)].\n\nDir D.\n\nThen from (2,1), can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), since U to (2,2) body collision and opposite, D to (2,0) wall.\n\nSo go say R to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., to reach (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is far, and I have the body behind.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 3 I went R to (2,4):\n\n- Turn 3: move R to (2,4), no eat, snake [(2,4)], dir R\n\n- Turn 4: move D to (2,3), no eat, snake [(2,3)], dir D\n\n- Turn 5: move D to (2,2), eat, snake [(2,2), (2,3)], dir D\n\n- Turn 6: move D to (2,1), eat, snake [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)], dir D\n\n- Turn 7: from (2,1), move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1)\n\nSimilar situation.\n\nIn both cases, by turn 6 or 7, I have eaten (2,2) and (2,1), and possibly (2,5) if I ate it first.\n\nBut in the first path, I ate (2,5) on turn 4, so I have three foods eaten by turn 8, length 4.\n\nIn second path, if I didn't eat (2,5), I have two foods eaten, length 3.\n\nBut I can still eat (2,5) later.\n\nNow, the food at (2,5) is available until turn 9, so I can eat it.\n\nAlso, (6,6) until turn 9.\n\nBut with the snake longer, it might be harder to reach (6,6) without collision.\n\nFor example, if I am at (2,1) with body above, and I need to go to (6,6), I have to go right and up, but the body might block.\n\nThe grid is small, 6x6, with obstacle.\n\nLet's sketch the grid:\n\nRows y=1 to 6, bottom to top? y=1 bottom, y=6 top, since U is y+1.\n\nx=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nObstacle at (6,4).\n\nCells: (1,1) to (6,6), except (6,4) blocked.\n\nFood at: (2,5), (2,2), (6,6), (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is bottom-left area, (2,2) above it, (2,5) top, (6,6) top-right.\n\nFrom (2,1), to reach (6,6), I can go right to x=6, then up, but at y=4, (6,4) blocked, so I need to go above or below.\n\nBelow y=4, y=3 or 2, but y=1,2,3 are bottom, so I can go to (5,1) or (6,1), then up, but (6,1) is possible, then to (6,2), (6,3), then to (6,5) since (6,4) blocked, so (6,3) to (6,5) not adjacent, need to go to (5,3) or something.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go U to (6,4) but blocked, or D to (6,2), or L to (5,3), R invalid.\n\nSo to go up, I need to go left to (5,3), then to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), then to (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, from above, I can go to (5,6) then to (6,6).\n\nBut with a long snake, it might be tight.\n\nIf I eat (6,6) first, it might be easier since snake is short.\n\nBut (6,6) is far from (1,4).\n\nFrom (1,4), to (6,6), I need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, on turn 3, if I go R to (2,4), then on turn 4, instead of down, I go R to (3,4), then to (4,4), (5,4), but (5,4) is free, (6,4) obstacle, so to (5,4), then to (5,5), (5,6), then to (6,6).\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,4), no eat, snake [(2,4)], dir R\n\nTurn 4: move R to (3,4), no eat, snake [(3,4)], dir R\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,4), no eat, snake [(4,4)], dir R\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,4), no eat, snake [(5,4)], dir R\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4), can go U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo U, D, L possible.\n\nGo U to (5,5), no food, snake [(5,5)], dir U\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), dir U, can go U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,6) has no food, but (6,6) is adjacent.\n\nGo U to (5,6), no food, snake [(5,6)], dir U\n\nTurn 9: from (5,6), dir U, can go U to (5,7) invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) has food, so go R to (6,6), eat, grow. Snake head at (6,6), tail at (5,6).\n\nBut this is on turn 9, and (6,6) food disappears after turn 9? Life span 7 at turn 3, present until turn 9, so on turn 9, it is still there, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, other foods have life until turn 9 or 10.\n\n(2,1) until turn 10.\n\nIn this path, I ate only (6,6) on turn 9, and snake length 2.\n\nBut I missed (2,5), (2,2), (2,1), so low score.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the closer foods first.\n\nSince all foods are positive, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nThe foods at (2,5), (2,2), (2,1) are all on x=2, so I can eat them in a column.\n\n(2,1) at bottom, (2,2) above, (2,5) above.\n\nSo from (1,4), if I go to (2,4), then I can go down to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) or up to (2,5).\n\nBut if I go down first, I eat (2,2) and (2,1), then I need to go up for (2,5), but with body, it might be blocked.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up first to (2,5), eat, then down to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), but when I go down, after eating (2,5), I am at (2,5) with body, then to (2,4), no food, then to (2,3), no food, then to (2,2) eat, then to (2,1) eat.\n\nBut on the way down, from (2,5) to (2,4), then to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (2,1).\n\nWhen at (2,3), I move to (2,2) eat, so I grow, then from (2,2) to (2,1) eat, grow again.\n\nBut the body is behind, so when at (2,1), I have body at (2,2), (2,3), etc., so I can only move left or right, not up, because up is body.\n\nThen I need to go to (6,6) from there.\n\nBut (6,6) is far, and I have limited time.\n\nLife span of (6,6) until turn 9, so by turn 9 I need to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) until turn 9.\n\nIn the column path, if I start from top.\n\nTurn 3: from (1,4) move R to (2,4), no eat, snake [(2,4)], dir R\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5), eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)], dir U\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), dir U, can go U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\nSince I want to go down, but I cannot go D because opposite direction.\n\nSo I have to go U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), no food, snake head to (2,6), tail to (2,5), so [(2,6), (2,5)], dir U\n\nThen from (2,6), I can only move L or R, say L to (1,6), then I can go down from there, but I need to go to (2,2) etc.\n\nNot direct.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 5, I can go R to (3,5), for example.\n\nThen to (4,5), etc., but not towards (2,2).\n\nSo to go down from (2,5), I need to change direction.\n\nBut on turn 5, from (2,5), direction U, I cannot go D, so I have to move horizontally first to change direction.\n\nFor example, go R to (3,5), then from there, direction R, I can go D to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc., but that doesn't help to reach (2,2) directly.\n\n(2,2) is at x=2, so I need to go left.\n\nFrom (3,5), go L to (2,5), but (2,5) is body if I moved away, but in this case, if I go to (3,5), then (2,5) is tail or body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), snake at [(3,5), (2,5)], dir R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,5), dir R, can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nL to (2,5) is possible, and (2,5) is the tail, so moving to tail is allowed because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe, as long as it's only the tail and not other body.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is the tail, so I can move to it.\n\nBut (2,5) has no food now, since I ate it.\n\nSo move L to (2,5), no eat, snake moves: head to (2,5), tail moves to (3,5)? Positions before: head (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nMove head to (2,5), which was tail, so new head at (2,5), and the tail (2,5) was occupied, but since head moves there, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n\nNew positions: the body segment (2,5) moves to where? Standard: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo when head moves to (2,5), which was the position of the tail, but the tail was at (2,5), so after head moves to (2,5), the body segment that was at (2,5) needs to move to the previous position of the head, which was (3,5).\n\nBut the body segment is the tail at (2,5), so it moves to (3,5).\n\nSo new snake: head at (2,5), tail at (3,5).\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection now L.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go D to (2,4), since direction L, not opposite.\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body now.\n\nGo D to (2,4), no food, etc.\n\nBut this is messy, and I'm not getting to (2,2) efficiently.\n\nTo eat the column, it's better to go to the end first or start from one end.\n\nSince (2,1) has longer life, I can eat (2,5) and (2,2) first, then (2,1) later.\n\n(2,1) life until turn 10, others until turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 3, move R to (2,4) or U to (1,5).\n\nLet's decide to eat (2,5) first.\n\nSo on turn 3, move U to (1,5) or R to (2,4).\n\nIf move U to (1,5), then turn 4 move R to (2,5) eat.\n\nOr if move R to (2,4), turn 4 move U to (2,5) eat.\n\nSame result, at (2,5) with body.\n\nThen from there, I can go down.\n\nBut to go down, I need to have the direction down.\n\nSo after eating at (2,5), direction is U or R depending on how I arrived.\n\nIn both cases, on turn 5, I can go D if possible.\n\nFor example, if I arrived from left, like from (1,5) to (2,5), direction R, so I can go D to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I arrived from below, from (2,4) to (2,5), direction U, I cannot go D immediately.\n\nBut in the first case, if I moved R to (2,5) from (1,5), direction R, so I can go D.\n\nLet's assume on turn 3 I move U to (1,5), then turn 4 move R to (2,5) eat, direction R.\n\nThen turn 5, from (2,5), dir R, move D to (2,4), no food, snake head to (2,4), tail to (2,5), so [(2,4), (2,5)], dir D\n\nTurn 6, from (2,4), dir D, move D to (2,3), no food, snake [(2,3), (2,4)], dir D\n\nTurn 7, from (2,3), dir D, move D to (2,2), eat, so grow, snake [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], dir D\n\nTurn 8, from (2,2), dir D, move D to (2,1), eat, grow, snake [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], dir D\n\nThen on turn 9, from (2,1), can only move L or R, say R to (3,1), then I can go up to (3,2), etc., to reach (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), and I have to get there by turn 9 to eat it, since life until turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is the last turn for (6,6).\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (2,1), with body up to (2,4).\n\nOn turn 9, I move R to (3,1), no food, snake head to (3,1), tail to (2,1), so [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]? Positions before: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nMove head to (3,1), no eat, so new positions: head (3,1), then body: (2,1) to where head was? Body segments move to previous position.\n\nHead was at (2,1), moves to (3,1), so the first body segment at (2,2) moves to (2,1), the next at (2,3) moves to (2,2), the tail at (2,4) moves to (2,3).\n\nSo new snake: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] head at (3,1), tail at (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 10, from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid, L to (2,1) body, R to (4,1), so U or R.\n\nGo U to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is not eaten, and on turn 10 it is gone.\n\nSo I missed (6,6).\n\nIf on turn 9 I am at (2,1), and (6,6) is far, I can't reach it in one turn.\n\nDistance from (2,1) to (6,6) is at least |6-2| + |6-1| = 4+5=9 moves, but I have only 6 turns from turn 4 to turn 9? Turn 4 to turn 9 is 6 turns, but I need to be at (6,6) on turn 9 to eat.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 9, I have turns 4,5,6,7,8,9: 6 moves.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 4 to (6,6) at turn 9, but in the column path, I am going down, not towards (6,6).\n\nTo eat (6,6), I need to go there earlier.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (6,6) first while snake is short.\n\nOn turn 3, from (1,4), move R to (2,4)\n\nTurn 4, move R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5, move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6, move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7, from (5,4), move U to (5,5)  -- since R to (6,4) blocked\n\nTurn 8, from (5,5), move U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 9, from (5,6), move R to (6,6) eat.\n\nYes, on turn 9 I eat (6,6), snake grows to length 2 at [(6,6), (5,6)]\n\nThen I have (2,5), (2,2), (2,1) to eat.\n\n(2,5) and (2,2) disappear after turn 9, so on turn 10, they are gone, only (2,1) until turn 10.\n\nOn turn 10, (2,1) is still there.\n\nBut I am at (6,6), far from (2,1), and turn 10 only one move, I can't reach (2,1) from (6,6) in one turn.\n\nDistance 5+5=10, too far.\n\nSo I can only eat (6,6), miss the others.\n\nNot good.\n\nEat the close foods first, then try for (6,6).\n\nBut with the body, it might be hard.\n\nPerhaps eat (2,5) and (2,2) quickly, then go to (6,6), then to (2,1) if possible.\n\n(2,1) until turn 10.\n\nLet's say on turn 3, move to eat (2,5) by turn 4.\n\nFor example, turn 3 move U to (1,5), turn 4 move R to (2,5) eat.\n\nAt turn 4, snake at (2,5) with body (1,5), length 2.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,5), dir R, move D to (2,4), no food, snake [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 6, from (2,4), dir D, move D to (2,3), no food, snake [(2,3), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 7, from (2,3), dir D, move D to (2,2) eat, grow, snake [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 8, from (2,2), dir D, can move D to (2,1) but (2,1) has food, so move to (2,1) eat, grow, snake [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nBut on turn 8, I eat (2,1), so I have all x=2 foods.\n\nNow on turn 9, from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1), as before.\n\nBut (6,6) is still there until turn 9, but I am at (2,1), can't reach (6,6) in one turn.\n\nSo miss (6,6).\n\nIf I don't eat (2,1) yet, but on turn 8 from (2,2), I can move L or R instead of D to (2,1).\n\nFor example, on turn 8 from (2,2), move R to (3,2), then I can go towards (6,6).\n\nBut (2,1) has food, and life until turn 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nOn turn 8 from (2,2), dir D, move R to (3,2), no food, snake head to (3,2), tail to (2,2), so [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]? Before move, snake [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nMove head to (3,2), no eat, so new positions: head (3,2), body (2,2) moves to (2,2)? Body segments: the first body at (2,3) moves to (2,2), the tail at (2,4) moves to (2,3), so snake [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead at (3,2), tail at (2,3).\n\nDir from moving right, so dir R.\n\nTurn 9, from (3,2), can go U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), far, I need to move right and up.\n\nBut on turn 9, I can move R to (4,2), for example.\n\nThen on turn 10, from (4,2), I can move to (4,3), etc., but (6,6) is gone after turn 9, so I can't eat it.\n\n(2,1) is still there on turn 10, so I can eat it if I go to (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 9, I can go D to (3,1), then on turn 10 to (2,1) or (3,1) to (2,1) etc.\n\nBut (2,1) at turn 10, I can eat it.\n\nSo in this case, I eat (2,5), (2,2), and (2,1), but miss (6,6).\n\nScore 3.\n\nIf I can eat (6,6) instead of one, but (6,6) is one food, same as others.\n\nAll are +1, so 3 foods vs 4, but I can't eat all four with the time and space.\n\nPerhaps a different initial move.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 3, move U to (1,5), then on turn 4, instead of R to (2,5), go U to (1,6), then on turn 5 go R to (2,6), then from there I can go to (3,6), (4,6), etc. to (6,6).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,5), no eat, snake [(1,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,6), no eat, snake [(1,6)] dir U\n\nTurn 5: move R to (2,6), no food, snake [(2,6)] dir R\n\nTurn 6: move R to (3,6), no food, snake [(3,6)] dir R\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,6), no food, snake [(4,6)] dir R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,6), no food, snake [(5,6)] dir R\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,6) eat, snake [(6,6), (5,6)]\n\nThen I have (6,6) eaten.\n\nOn turn 10, I can go to (2,1) but too far, or eat other, but (2,5) and (2,2) are gone after turn 9, only (2,1) until turn 10.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (2,1) is far, can't reach in one turn.\n\nSo I eat only (6,6), miss the others.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the best is to eat the three foods on x=2, score 3, and miss (6,6).\n\nBut can I eat all four?\n\nSuppose I eat (2,5) first, then go directly to (6,6) without eating the bottom foods yet.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (2,5) eat, snake [(2,5), (1,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), dir R, move R to (3,5), no food, snake [(3,5), (2,5)]  (tail at (2,5)? Head to (3,5), tail to (2,5)? Positions: before [(2,5), (1,5)], move head to (3,5), no eat, so new: head (3,5), body (2,5) moves to (2,5)? The body segment at (1,5) moves to (2,5), and the tail is removed? Snake was length 2, move no eat, still length 2.\n\nPositions: before move, [head (2,5), tail (1,5)]\n\nAfter move head to (3,5), tail moves to (2,5), so new [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDir R.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5), no food, snake [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5), no food, snake [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), dir R, can go U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nGo U to (5,6), no food, snake [(5,6), (5,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 9: from (5,6), dir U, move R to (6,6) eat, snake [(6,6), (5,6)] and grow, so [(6,6), (5,6)] with new segment? Eat, so head at (6,6), new tail added at (5,6)? Positions before: [ (5,6), (5,5) ] head at (5,6), tail at (5,5)\n\nMove to (6,6) eat, so head to (6,6), new segment added, so tail remains at (5,5), and new segment at (5,6)? New positions: head (6,6), then the previous head (5,6) becomes body, and tail at (5,5) remains, but since growing, a new segment is added at the end, so positions [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nBut I have not eaten (2,2) or (2,1), and they are gone after turn 9 or 10.\n\n(2,2) gone after turn 9, (2,1) after turn 10.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (6,6), can't reach (2,2).\n\nOn turn 10, (2,1) is there, but from (6,6) to (2,1) far.\n\nSo only two foods eaten.\n\nWorse than eating the three on x=2.\n\nTherefore, the optimal is to eat the three foods on the left: (2,5), (2,2), (2,1), and forget about (6,6) for now.\n\nTo do that, I need to start by eating (2,5) early.\n\nOn turn 3, I can move U or R to reach (2,5) by turn 4.\n\nIf I move U to (1,5) on turn 3, then on turn 4 move R to (2,5) to eat.\n\nOr move R to (2,4) on turn 3, then on turn 4 move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBoth work.\n\nBut when I move from (1,4) to (1,5), direction U, or to (2,4), direction R.\n\nFor the path, it doesn't matter.\n\nLet's choose to move U on turn 3 to (1,5), then on turn 4 move R to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen continue as before to eat (2,2) and (2,1).\n\nBut in the down path, I can eat (2,2) on turn 7 and (2,1) on turn 8, as earlier.\n\nThen on turn 9 and 10, I can explore or something, but no more food, so score 3.\n\nIf I move R on turn 3 to (2,4), then on turn 4 move U to (2,5) eat, then on turn 5 I can go D to (2,4) since direction U, but I moved to (2,5) from below, so direction U, so on turn 5 I cannot go D, so I have to move horizontally first, which delays going down.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,4), no eat, snake [(2,4)] dir R\n\nTurn 4: move U to (2,5) eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4)] dir U\n\nTurn 5: from (2,5), dir U, cannot go D, so go say R to (3,5), no food, snake [(3,5), (2,5)]  (head to (3,5), tail to (2,5)? Before: [ (2,5), (2,4) ], move to (3,5), no eat, new: head (3,5), body (2,5) moves to (2,5)? Body segment (2,4) moves to (2,5), so [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDir R.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), dir R, can go L to (2,5) which is tail, so move to (2,5), no eat, snake head to (2,5), tail moves to (3,5), so [(2,5), (3,5)] dir L\n\nThen from (2,5), can go D to (2,4), etc., but it's turn 6, and I'm back at (2,5), late for going down.\n\nThen to reach (2,2) by turn 7 or 8, possible but tight.\n\nFor example, turn 7 from (2,5) move D to (2,4), turn 8 to (2,3), turn 9 to (2,2) eat, turn 10 to (2,1) eat, but on turn 9 eat (2,2), turn 10 eat (2,1), both within life, (2,2) until turn 9, (2,1) until turn 10.\n\nBut (6,6) missed.\n\nSo same score, but with more moves.\n\nTherefore, better to move U on turn 3 to (1,5), then on turn 4 move R to (2,5) eat, then directly down to eat (2,2) and (2,1).\n\nIn that case, from turn 4 at (2,5), I can go D on turn 5 only if direction allows.\n\nIn the sequence where I arrive from left, direction R, so I can go D.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: R to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 5: D to (2,4) no eat\n\nTurn 6: D to (2,3) no eat\n\nTurn 7: D to (2,2) eat\n\nTurn 8: D to (2,1) eat\n\nThen on later turns, I can move right or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state is at turn 3, and I need to output actions starting from turn 3 for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for a few turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify for a sequence.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't say, but probably for the immediate actions and a few ahead.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output for 5 or 6 turns.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 3 to turn 8, I have actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3.\n\nAction for turn 3: move U\n\nThen turn 4: move R\n\nTurn 5: move D\n\nTurn 6: move D\n\nTurn 7: move D\n\nTurn 8: move D\n\nBut on turn 7, I move to (2,2) and eat, turn 8 to (2,1) and eat.\n\nThen after that, no specific action needed.\n\nBut for the output, I can list up to turn 8 or so.\n\nPerhaps list 5 actions, from turn 3 to turn 7.\n\nBut on turn 7, I eat (2,2), and turn 8 eat (2,1), but turn 8 is t1+5.\n\nt1=3, t1+1=4, t1+2=5, t1+3=6, t1+4=7, t1+5=8.\n\nSo up to turn 8.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, output for 5 turns or more.\n\nBut in the plan, after turn 8, I don't have food, so I can stop.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk or something.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,5) is under the snake when I eat it? No, on turn 4, I move to (2,5), which has food, and snake was at (1,5), so (2,5) was empty, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nThe obstacle at (6,4) doesn't affect this path.\n\nSo this seems safe and gets three foods.\n\nIf I can get (6,6), but I think it's not feasible with the time.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nBut on turn 5, I move to (2,4), no food, then turn 6 to (2,3), no food, turn 7 to (2,2) eat, turn 8 to (2,1) eat.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 3, move U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score, the AI prioritizes eating the positive food at (2,5), (2,2), and (2,1) while avoiding the distant and risky (6,6) due to time constraints and the snake's growth. The plan focuses on moving down the x=2 column efficiently, starting by eating (2,5) on turn 4, then proceeding to (2,2) on turn 7, and (2,1) on turn 8. This sequence ensures all three foods are eaten within their life spans (all expire by turn 10) and avoids collisions or dead ends. The food at (6,6) is skipped as it cannot be reached in time after eating the column foods, and attempting it would risk missing multiple foods for only one point.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 3 (Current State)**: Snake head at (1,4) with direction U. Possible moves: U (to (1,5)) or R (to (2,4)). Moving U is chosen to set up a direct path to (2,5) without delay.\n- **Eating Sequence**: \n  - (2,5) eaten on turn 4 for +1, snake grows to length 2.\n  - (2,2) eaten on turn 7 for +1, snake grows to length 3.\n  - (2,1) eaten on turn 8 for +1, snake grows to length 4.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No body collisions: The snake remains short during the sequence, and movements avoid the body.\n  - Wall and obstacle: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle (6,4) are avoided by staying in the safe grid (x=1-6, y=1-6).\n  - Direction constraints: No instant reverse is respected (e.g., after moving U, D is not chosen).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: \n  - By turn 8, all accessible food is eaten (score +3), and the snake positions allow safe exploration afterward (e.g., moving right from (2,1)).\n  - (6,6) is ignored: It expires on turn 9 and is too far (distance 10+ cells from (2,1) on turn 8), making it unreachable.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions for turns 3 to 8 are detailed below. Moves are chosen to minimize turns to food while ensuring survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U (up)  \nTurn 4: R (right)  \nTurn 5: D (down)  \nTurn 6: D (down)  \nTurn 7: D (down)  \nTurn 8: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: Border cells mean that x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (6,4). So, I can't move into these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (2,5), and the body is at (1,5). Since it's only two segments, the tail is at (1,5). Head direction is R (right), so it's moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,2) with life_span 5, value +1 (since it says value 1, and positive food is +1)\n\n- (6,6) with life_span 5, value +1\n\n- (2,1) with life_span 6, value +1\n\n- (5,4) with life_span 9, value +1\n\nAll food seems to be positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, which means +1.\n\nLife_span: For (2,2) and (6,6), life_span is 5, which means they disappear after 5 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 5, countdown decreases to 4? Let me clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, when food is present, life_span is given, and each turn it decreases. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at turn t + L, it's gone. But countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it's L-1, down to 0 when it disappears.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the turn it's reported, the countdown decreases that turn.\n\nIn this state, turn 5, food is given with life_span, so for (2,2), life_span=5 on turn 5. That means after turn 5, life_span becomes 4, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(2,2): life_span 5, so after turn 5, it has 4 left; disappears after turn 9? Let's think.\n\nTurn 5: life_span=5, after processing turn 5, it decreases to 4.\n\nTurn 6: life_span=4, decrease to 3.\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: life_span=1, decrease to 0, disappears.\n\nSo it exists from turn 5 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 5 to turn 9: that's 5 turns, but life_span decreases each turn.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the number of turns it remains.\n\nAt turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something? I need to be careful.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and N is life_span.\n\n\"After N turns\" from when? From the current turn.\n\nSo if at turn t, life_span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears before turn t+N.\n\nFor example, N=5, turn t=5: present on turns 5,6,7,8, disappears before turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, countdown: on turn 5, life_span=5, after turn 5, it becomes 4 for turn 6, etc.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know when it disappears.\n\nFor (2,2): life_span=5 on turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 9, meaning it can be eaten on turns 5,6,7,8,9? No.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n\nSo from turn 5, after 5 turns, it disappears, so on turn 10 it is gone. But let's see the countdown.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo on turn 5, when we have the state, countdown is 5. After this turn, it decreases to 4 for the next state.\n\nIf the snake eats it on turn 5, it's consumed and removed.\n\nOtherwise, on turn 6, life_span is 4, and so on.\n\nWhen countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (2,2) on turn 5: countdown=5. After turn 5, if not eaten, countdown=4 for turn 6.\n\nAfter turn 6, countdown=3, and so on, until after turn 9, countdown=0, and it disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0, i.e., turns 5 to 9.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6): life_span=5, same as above, can be eaten turns 5 to 9.\n\n(2,1): life_span=6 on turn 5, so countdown=6, decreases each turn, can be eaten turns 5 to 10.\n\n(5,4): life_span=9, countdown=9, can be eaten turns 5 to 13.\n\nNow, snake: head at (2,5), moving right, so current direction is R. Body at (1,5), so tail is at (1,5).\n\nGrid size: 8x8, walls at borders and (6,4) internal obstacle.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nY from 0 to 7, bottom to top or top to bottom? Usually in coordinates, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (6,4).\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,2) - bottom-left area\n\n- (6,6) - top-right\n\n- (2,1) - very bottom, x=2,y=1\n\n- (5,4) - middle-right, but (5,4) is near the obstacle?\n\n(5,4) is a food position, and (6,4) is obstacle, so (5,4) is clear.\n\nSnake: head at (2,5), body at (1,5), so the snake is horizontal, head at (2,5), tail at (1,5), facing right.\n\nCurrent turn t=5.\n\nI need to choose actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, which is 5.\n\nThe boxed answer should have Turn 5: action, Turn 6: action, etc., but how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but in the output, it might be for a sequence, but the state might change after each turn, so I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nThe instruction is to output actions for the current turn and future turns, but since food might be eaten or disappear, and snake grows, it's dynamic. But for this response, I think I need to provide a sequence of actions for several turns, say 5 turns or so, based on the current state.\n\nThe answer format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide actions for a few turns, at least 5 to match the thinking ahead.\n\nBut let's see the core: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" for decision making, but output the actions.\n\nI should plan a path.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, (2,6)), D (down, (2,4)), L (left, (1,5)), R (right, (3,5)).\n\nBut no instant reverse: current direction is R, so cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite to R.\n\nSo cannot move L.\n\nAlso, moving L to (1,5) is where the body is, but since it's the tail, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n\nCollision rules: cannot move into body except the tail, because when you move, the tail also moves forward.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n\nAlso, walls: (1,5) is not a wall, it's the tail.\n\nBut moving to (1,5) is L, which is reverse, not allowed.\n\nCannot move reverse, so L is invalid.\n\nNow, moving to body: (2,5) is head, body is (1,5), so cells: (3,5) is empty? Let's see grid.\n\nAvailable cells:\n\n- U: (2,6) - is this wall? y=6, not border (y=0 or y=7), x=2 not border, and not obstacle, so ok.\n\n- D: (2,4) - similarly, y=4, not border, x=2, not obstacle.\n\n- R: (3,5) - x=3, y=5, not border, not obstacle.\n\n- L: (1,5) - but reverse, not allowed.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is the tail, but since reverse not allowed, we can't move there anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (2,2) at (2,2)\n\n- (6,6) at (6,6)\n\n- (2,1) at (2,1)\n\n- (5,4) at (5,4)\n\nSnake at (2,5), so (2,2) is down-left, (2,1) is further down, (6,6) is far, (5,4) is right and down.\n\nAlso, life_spans: (2,2) and (6,6) have short life, disappear soon, (2,1) has longer, (5,4) longest.\n\nI need to think about survival and eating food.\n\nSince snake is short, only 2 segments, eating food grows it, but also might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut we need to eat to score.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards food.\n\nClosest food: (2,2) is at (2,2), head at (2,5), so same x, y difference 3 down.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is at (2,1), even further down.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), head (2,5), so Δx=3, Δy=-1, so down-right.\n\n(6,6) is Δx=4, Δy=1, up-right.\n\nNow, moving down directly to (2,2) might be possible.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nTail at (1,5), so if I move down to (2,4), then snake positions: new head (2,4), body [ (2,5) ], so tail is (2,5) now? Let's see.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position, and tail moves forward, so if I move to (2,4), new positions: head at (2,4), the previous head (2,5) becomes body, and the previous tail (1,5) is gone? Since we didn't eat, length same.\n\nWhen no food eaten, snake moves: head to new cell, and tail removed.\n\nSo after moving to (2,4): head at (2,4), body at (2,5), tail was (1,5) removed, so positions: [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (2,6): [(2,6), (2,5)]\n\nIf move R to (3,5): [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nNow, food: (2,2) at (2,2), to eat it, I need to move down multiple times.\n\nBut (2,2) has life_span 5, so it can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,5), head at (2,5), so adjacent? They are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAdjacent means sharing an edge, so yes, (1,5) and (2,5) are adjacent.\n\nBut the tail cell (1,5) has food? Currently, is there food at (1,5)? Food positions: (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (5,4), not at (1,5), so no food there, so no danger now.\n\nBut if later, when tail has food, and head adjacent, eating that food causes death.\n\nFor now, no issue.\n\nNow, let's plan a sequence.\n\nOption 1: Move towards (2,2) or (2,1) down.\n\nBut (2,1) has longer life, (2,2) shorter.\n\n(2,2) life_span 5, turn 5, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) same.\n\n(2,1) life_span 6, turn 5, so by turn 10.\n\n(5,4) by turn 13.\n\nSince snake is at (2,5), moving to (2,2) takes 3 moves down: to (2,4), (2,3), then (2,2) on turn 7 or something.\n\nTurn 5: move to (2,4) or other.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 5: start at (2,5), move D to (2,4)? Or other.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6, etc.\n\nBut I have to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should think about which food to target first.\n\nSince (2,2) and (6,6) have short life, I might prioritize them if possible.\n\n(2,2) is closer.\n\nDistance to (2,2): Manhattan |2-2| + |5-2| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nTo (2,1): |2-2| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4.\n\nTo (5,4): |2-5| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nTo (6,6): |2-6| + |5-6| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo (2,2) is closest at distance 3.\n\n(5,4) also distance 4, but with Δy=1, so might be reachable faster depending on path.\n\nBut (2,2) is directly below.\n\nHowever, moving directly down might not be safe if the snake grows, but now it's short.\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 is wall, so moving to (2,1) is on border, but y=1 is not wall, y=0 is wall.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, but (2,1) is y=1, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) y=2, fine.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (6,4), which is not near now.\n\nAnother thing: if I go down to (2,2), I might get stuck in the corner or something.\n\nBut y=0 is wall, so at y=1 or y=2, I can still move left/right.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can go L to (1,2) or R to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,1), which is below (2,2), at (2,1).\n\n(2,1) has life_span 6, so I can eat (2,2) first, then (2,1) if I want.\n\nBut eating both might make the snake longer and harder to maneuever in that area.\n\nSince (2,2) disappears soon, I should eat it before it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is far, distance 5, with short life, might not reach in time if I go for (2,2) first.\n\nTurn to reach: to (2,2) from (2,5), moving down, it takes 3 moves: turn 5 to (2,4), turn 6 to (2,3), turn 7 to (2,2), so on turn 7 I can eat it if I go directly.\n\nLife_span: on turn 5, countdown=5, after turn 5, if not eaten, countdown=4 on turn 6, then 3 on turn 7, so on turn 7 it can be eaten, countdown=3>0.\n\nAfter turn 7, if eaten, gone; if not, countdown=2 for turn 8, etc.\n\nSo on turn 7 I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't go for it, it disappears after turn 9.\n\nNow for (6,6): to reach from (2,5), need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, move right to (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then to (6,6), but (6,5) to (6,6) is up, but (6,6) is near border, x=6,y=6.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (6,6) is ok, but moving to (7,6) is wall.\n\nTo reach (6,6) from (2,5): Δx=4, Δy=1, so at least 5 moves if I go directly, but I might not go directly.\n\nMinimum moves: 4 right and 1 up, but since I need to sequence, it could be 5 moves.\n\nTurn 5 to (3,5), turn 6 to (4,5), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (6,5), turn 9 to (6,6).\n\nOn turn 9, I reach (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) life_span: on turn 5, countdown=5, after turn 5, countdown=4, turn 6:3, turn 7:2, turn 8:1, turn 9:0? Let's see countdown.\n\nTurn 5: life_span=5, after turn 5, it decreases to 4 for turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: life_span=4, decreases to 3 for turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: 3 to 2\n\nTurn 8: 2 to 1\n\nTurn 9: 1 to 0, and disappears, so on turn 9, when I move to (6,6), if I move there, I eat it if it exists, but on turn 9, countdown=1 before action? When is food eaten?\n\nThe food is eaten when the head moves onto the cell, and at that time, if life_span >0, it is eaten.\n\nOn turn 9, before any action, for (6,6), if not eaten before, life_span would be 1 (since from turn 5, after 4 turns, life_span=1 on turn 9?).\n\nAt start of turn 5: food (6,6) has life_span=5.\n\nAfter turn 5 is processed, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 4.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 6, to 3, etc.\n\nAfter turn 8, life_span decreases to 1 for turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, when the snake moves, if it moves to (6,6), and at that time life_span >0, it eats it.\n\nAfter move, life_span decreases.\n\nBut for eating, it's during the move.\n\nSo on turn 9, life_span is 1 >0, so it can be eaten.\n\nAfter eating, it's gone, and life_span decrease doesn't matter.\n\nIf not eaten on turn 9, after turn, life_span=0, disappears.\n\nSo for (6,6), it can be eaten up to turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, I can eat it if I reach.\n\nIn my path, turn 9 to (6,6), I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2), on turn 7.\n\nBut if I go for (2,2) first, I might not reach (6,6) in time.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (6,6) is far, |dx|=4, |dy|=4, distance 8, at least 8 moves, from turn 8 onwards, but on turn 8 I am at (2,2) if I ate on turn 7, then to (6,6) takes min 8 moves, to turn 15, but (6,6) gone by turn 10, so impossible to reach after eating (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (6,6) first, I might not get (2,2).\n\n(2,2) must be eaten by turn 9, last chance turn 9.\n\nIf I go directly to (6,6), I reach on turn 9, but (2,2) is at (2,2), which I can't reach from there on same turn.\n\nSo I can only get one of the short-life foods, not both, since they are on opposite sides.\n\n(2,2) and (6,6) both need to be eaten soon, but I have to choose one to target.\n\n(2,2) is closer, 3 moves vs 5 moves for (6,6).\n\nAlso, after eating (2,2), I can go for (2,1) or (5,4).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), near (2,2), life_span 6, so by turn 10.\n\n(5,4) life_span 9, by turn 13.\n\nNow, other food: (2,1) at (2,1), which is below (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,2), I can then go down to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) at (5,4), which is near the obstacle (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so (5,4) is accessible.\n\nNow, let's consider the risk of going down.\n\nHead at (2,5), move D to (2,4).\n\nThen positions: head (2,4), body (2,5)\n\nThen from there, I can move D to (2,3), then to (2,2) on turn 7.\n\nBut on turn 7, move to (2,2), eat food, snake grows: since ate, length increases, so new head at (2,2), previous head (2,3) becomes body, and tail doesn't move, so positions: after eating, head at food cell, and body segments stay, tail doesn't advance.\n\nWhen you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one cell.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n\nFor example, from [(2,4), (2,5)] on turn 6 (after move to (2,4) on turn 5? Let's sequence turns.\n\nTurn 5 start: snake at [(2,5), (1,5)]\n\nI move, say, D to (2,4).\n\nAfter move, no food at (2,4), so snake moves: head to (2,4), tail (1,5) removed, so positions: [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nTurn 6: from [(2,4), (2,5)], head at (2,4), direction? Previous move was D, so direction D.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R except reverse, which would be U? Reverse to D is U, so cannot move U.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nFood at (2,3)? No, (2,2) is below.\n\nMove D to (2,3): now (2,3) has food? No, food at (2,2), so no, move to (2,3), no food, so snake: head to (2,3), tail (2,5) removed? Positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), so [(2,3), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,2), now (2,2) has food, life_span >0, so eat it. Snake grows: head to (2,2), and new segment added, so body becomes [ (2,3), (2,4) ], and tail extended, so positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (2,1) or other places.\n\n(2,1) has food, at (2,1), below.\n\nI can move D to (2,1) on next turn.\n\nTurn 8: from [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nMove D to (2,1): (2,1) has food, value +1, eat it. Snake grows: head to (2,1), body [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ], add new segment, so positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nNow snake is vertical at x=2, y from 1 to 4.\n\nBut y=0 is wall below, so I need to move left or right.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), since direction was D, moving L or R is not reverse.\n\nBut tail is at (2,4), which is far.\n\nBut the area might be tight.\n\n(2,1) is at y=1, one above wall y=0.\n\nIf I move, say, R to (3,1), then I can go towards (5,4) or other.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\n(5,4) at (5,4), which is available for longer.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is gone if not eaten by turn 9.\n\nIn this path, I ate (2,2) and (2,1), but missed (6,6).\n\nIf I go for (6,6) first.\n\nFrom start (2,5), move R to (3,5).\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (1,5) removed, so [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5), no food, positions: [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5), no food, positions: [(5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5), but (6,5) is not wall, but internal obstacle at (6,4), which is below, so (6,5) is ok.\n\nMove to (6,5), no food, positions: [(6,5), (5,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6), eat food at (6,6), life_span=1>0, eat, grow to [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nNow snake at top-right.\n\nThen I can go to other food, like (5,4) or (2,1), but (2,1) is far, and (5,4) is close.\n\n(5,4) at (5,4), from (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), but (6,5) is body now, after eating, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5) and (5,5).\n\nSo (6,5) is body, cannot move there.\n\nMove L to (5,6), but (5,6) is empty? Or D to (6,5) invalid.\n\nDirections from (6,6): U to (6,7), but y=7 wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (6,5), but (6,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nL to (5,6), possible.\n\nR to (7,6), but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), which is below, so I need to go down.\n\nBut from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body? Positions: after move to (5,6), head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)? After eating on turn 9, positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter turn 9 move to (5,6): from head (6,6) move L to (5,6), no food, so snake moves: head to (5,6), tail (5,5) removed? Tail is (5,5), removed, so positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) was just removed, empty now? (5,5) is not occupied, so move to (5,5) is possible.\n\nMove to (5,5), no food, positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,5)]\n\nThen to (5,4), move D to (5,4), eat if present.\n\n(5,4) has food, life_span 9, on turn 11 say, still available.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (6,6), missed (2,2) and (2,1).\n\n(2,1) might be eaten if I go back, but far.\n\nNow, comparing the two options:\n\n- Down path: eat (2,2) and (2,1), score +2, but then snake is at (2,1) with length 4, and need to go to (5,4) or other.\n\n- Right path: eat (6,6), score +1, then go to (5,4) for another +1.\n\nBut (5,4) can be eaten later.\n\nAlso, in down path, I ate two foods, in right path one so far.\n\nBut (2,1) is still available if not eaten, in right path I didn't eat it.\n\nIn right path, (2,1) might be eaten by me later or not.\n\nBut for now, with short life foods, down path gives more immediate score.\n\nBut long-term, (5,4) is available, so I can eat it from either position.\n\nBut from (2,1) to (5,4) is |dx|=3, |dy|=3, distance 6, while from (6,6) to (5,4) is closer.\n\n(6,6) to (5,4): |dx|=1, |dy|=2, distance 3.\n\n(2,1) to (5,4): |3| + |3| = 6.\n\nSo easier from top-right.\n\nBut in down path, after eating (2,1), I am at (2,1), and can move to (3,1) etc. towards (5,4).\n\nNow, another option: perhaps go for (5,4) directly, since it has long life, but (2,2) and (6,6) will disappear soon, so I should eat one of them.\n\n(5,4) can be eaten later.\n\nSo better to eat the short-life food first.\n\nNow, which one: (2,2) or (6,6)?\n\n(2,2) is closer, 3 moves, (6,6) 5 moves.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,2), I can eat (2,1) immediately, which is also close.\n\n(2,1) has life_span 6, so not urgent.\n\nBut if I eat (2,2) on turn 7, then (2,1) on turn 8, as before.\n\nThen from there, I have a snake of length 4 at (2,1).\n\nThe grid has walls, and I need to go to (5,4).\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), so (5,4) is accessible.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move right, e.g. to (3,1), (4,1), etc., then up to (4,4), (5,4).\n\nBut y=4, x=5.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is near the obstacle (6,4).\n\nAlso, when moving, I need to avoid walls and body.\n\nBut with length 4, it might be manageable.\n\nIf I go for (6,6) first, I eat only one short-life food, but then I am closer to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), (6,6) at (6,6), not very close.\n\nBut after eating (6,6), I can go to (5,4) in a few moves.\n\nAs before, from (6,6) to (5,6) to (5,5) to (5,4), for example.\n\nOn turn 10 or so.\n\nBut (5,4) available until turn 13.\n\nNow, another food: (2,1) is at (2,1), which in the down path I eat, in right path I might not, but it has life_span 6, so by turn 10, I can still eat it if I go back.\n\nBut from (6,6) to (2,1) is far, |dx|=4, |dy|=5, distance 9, takes many turns, and by turn 10 it might disappear.\n\nTurn 5 to 10: on turn 10, for (2,1), life_span start 6 on turn 5, after turn 5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, turn10:0? After turn 10, it disappears.\n\nOn turn 10, if I move to (2,1), life_span=0? At start of turn 10, life_span for (2,1): from turn 5, after 5 turns, it would be life_span=1 for turn 10? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 5: life_span=6\n\nAfter turn 5: decrease to 5\n\nTurn 6: 5 to 4\n\nTurn 7: 4 to 3\n\nTurn 8: 3 to 2\n\nTurn 9: 2 to 1\n\nTurn 10: 1 to 0, disappears after turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 10, before action, life_span=1, so if I move to (2,1) on turn 10, I can eat it.\n\nBut to reach from (6,6) on turn 9, to (2,1) on turn 10 is impossible, too far.\n\nMinimum moves 9, so no, I can't eat (2,1) if I go for (6,6) first.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is gone by turn 9.\n\nSo if I go for (6,6), I miss both (2,2) and (2,1), only eat (6,6) and then (5,4), total +2.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) and (2,1), I eat both, +2, and then can eat (5,4) later, +1, total +3.\n\nAlso, (5,4) is available, so I can get it.\n\nIn the first case, with right path, I eat (6,6) and (5,4), +2.\n\nWith down path, (2,2), (2,1), and (5,4), +3.\n\nSo better to go down.\n\nMoreover, going down is shorter for the first food.\n\nBut is there risk in going down?\n\nFor example, when I move to (2,1), y=1, close to wall y=0.\n\nThen from there, if I move down, y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nSo I must move left or right.\n\nSay, to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nThen I can navigate to (5,4).\n\nFor example, from (2,1) after eating, positions [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D.\n\nCan move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), not U or D? U is reverse to D? Current direction D, reverse is U, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (2,0) invalid, wall.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay move R to (3,1), no food, positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), tail (2,4) removed? After move, no eat, so head to (3,1), tail removed, so positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] since tail was (2,4) removed, so body is (2,1) and (2,2), but (2,1) was head, now body, (2,2) body, (2,3) and (2,4) were body, but tail removed, so segments: previous head was (2,1), moved to (3,1), so new head (3,1), body segments: the previous body from head: (2,1) becomes first body, then (2,2), then (2,3), but when tail removed, the last segment is gone.\n\nSnake positions before move: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nHead at (2,1).\n\nMove to (3,1), no food, so new head at (3,1), and the tail (2,4) is removed, so new positions: head (3,1), and body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nSo [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]? No: the body segments are the previous positions except tail removed.\n\nStandard: after move without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment, tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: before move: S0 = head (2,1), S1 = (2,2), S2 = (2,3), S3 = tail (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,1): new head at (3,1), S0 moves to (3,1)? No.\n\nThe head moves to the new cell, so new head position is (3,1).\n\nThen the body segments: S1 (which was at (2,2)) moves to the previous position of S0, which was (2,1).\n\nS2 (at (2,3)) moves to previous position of S1, (2,2).\n\nS3 (tail at (2,4)) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,1), then body at (2,1) (from S1), then body at (2,2) (from S2), and S3 gone.\n\nSo [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nLength 3, since no growth.\n\nSimilarly, if I had eaten, it would be length 4.\n\nBut here, after moving to (3,1), positions [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen I can continue to (4,1), etc., towards (5,4).\n\n(5,4) at (5,4), so from (3,1) to (5,4), |dx=2|, |dy=3|, so move right and up.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (5,4) by turn, say, 12 or so.\n\nNow, back to turn 5 decision.\n\nI think going down to get (2,2) and (2,1) is better.\n\nBut is there another option? For example, go for (5,4) directly, but (2,2) might disappear.\n\n(5,4) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut if I go for (5,4) now, from (2,5) to (5,4), |dx=3|, |dy=1|, so move right and down.\n\nFor example, turn 5: move to (3,5) or (2,4).\n\nBut (2,4) is down, (3,5) right.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), then later to (4,5), (5,5), but (5,5) to (5,4) is down, but (5,4) has food.\n\nBut to reach (5,4) quickly: from (2,5) move D to (2,4), then R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then D to (4,3)? (5,4) is at (5,4).\n\nFrom (2,4) to (5,4): best to go right to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4).\n\nOn turn 5: move D to (2,4), positions [(2,4), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4), eat, grow to [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]\n\nBut on turn 8, I eat (5,4), but (2,2) and (6,6) are gone by turn 9, but I didn't eat them, and (2,1) is still there.\n\n(2,2) last chance turn 9, but on turn 8 I am at (5,4), far from (2,2), can't reach in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) similarly far.\n\nSo I miss both short-life foods.\n\nThen I can go for (2,1), from (5,4) to (2,1) is |dx=3|, |dy=3|, distance 6, but (2,1) must be eaten by turn 10.\n\nOn turn 8, after eating (5,4), positions [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 9: move towards (2,1), e.g. L to (4,4)? Head at (5,4), move L to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, collision? Positions: head (5,4), body (4,4) and (3,4), so (4,4) is adjacent, but it's body, so moving to (4,4) causes collision.\n\nCannot move left to (4,4).\n\nMove D to (5,3), possible, or U to (5,5), or R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (6,4) invalid, x=6,y=4 obstacle.\n\nU to (5,5), possible.\n\nD to (5,3), possible.\n\nBut to go to (2,1), need to go left and down.\n\nSay move L, but cannot to (4,4), so move D to (5,3), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut it takes time, and (2,1) disappears after turn 10, so if I reach by turn 10, possible but tight.\n\nOn turn 8: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,3), say, positions: head to (5,3), tail (3,4) removed, so [(5,3), (5,4)]? Before move: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]\n\nMove to (5,3): new head (5,3), body: (4,4) moves to previous head (5,4)? S1 at (4,4) moves to S0 old (5,4), S2 at (3,4) moves to S1 old (4,4), tail removed? Positions: new head (5,3), then body at (5,4) (from S1), then body at (4,4) (from S2), and tail (3,4) removed, so [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 10: move to (4,3), for example, to go left.\n\n(4,3) not food, positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] etc.\n\nBut (2,1) at (2,1), on turn 10, I need to be there, but from (5,3) on turn 9, to (2,1) min distance 4, so turn 13, too late.\n\nTurn 9 at (5,3), to (2,1): need to go left to x=2, down to y=1.\n\nBut y=1, from y=3, down 2, left 3, min 5 moves, turn 14, while (2,1) disappears after turn 10, so no, can't eat (2,1) if I go to (5,4) first.\n\nSimilarly, only (5,4) eaten, and possibly others, but in this case, I might eat only one food if I go directly to (5,4), missing others.\n\nWhereas if I go down first, I can eat two foods and then (5,4).\n\nSo better to target (2,2) and (2,1).\n\nMoreover, (2,1) has longer life, but since I'm there, I can eat it.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: currently no issue.\n\nAlso, when moving to eat (2,2), on turn 7, head to (2,2), and at that time, tail is at (2,4) or something, not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\nNow, for the sequence of actions.\n\nStart turn 5: head at (2,5), move D to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 6: from (2,4), direction D, move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), move D to (2,2), eat, grow to length 3: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,1), eat (2,1), grow to length 4: positions [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, at (2,1), cannot move D (wall), cannot move U (reverse), so only L or R.\n\nI need to choose.\n\nSay, move R to (3,1), as before.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence starting from turn 5.\n\nI should provide, say, 5 turns or so.\n\nBut after turn 8, I need to go towards (5,4).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D (eat (2,2))\n\nTurn 8: D (eat (2,1))\n\nTurn 9: from (2,1), move R to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 10: from (3,1), can move to (4,1) or (3,2), etc., to go to (5,4).\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the output, I can do a few.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list for multiple turns.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, list 5 actions.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9.\n\nSo actions for turn 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 5: D (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 6: D (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 7: D (to (2,2), eat)\n\nTurn 8: D (to (2,1), eat)\n\nTurn 9: move from (2,1) to, say, R to (3,1)\n\nBut on turn 9, direction is D, so moving R is not reverse, ok.\n\nNow, is this safe? On turn 9, after moving to (3,1), positions: as before, [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] or something.\n\nBefore turn 9: positions [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head at (2,1)\n\nMove to (3,1), no food, so new head (3,1), tail (2,4) removed, so body: (2,1) becomes body, (2,2) body, (2,3) was body but not moved? Positions: new head (3,1), then the first body segment is at previous head position (2,1), second body at previous first body (2,2), and previous second body (2,3) is now the last, but since tail removed, the segment at (2,3) is removed? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions: S0: (2,1), S1: (2,2), S2: (2,3), S3: (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,1): new head at (3,1), so S0 moves to (3,1)\n\nThen S1 moves to S0 old: (2,1)\n\nS2 moves to S1 old: (2,2)\n\nS3 is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nYes.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for turn 9 action, I need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 9: R.\n\nBut is there a reason to go left instead? To (1,1), but (1,1) might be closer to wall, but similar.\n\nI think right is fine to go towards (5,4).\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (5,4) has long life, so no rush.\n\nAlso, on the way, I might find other food, but currently only these.\n\nIn the state, only four foods given.\n\nNow, but in the down path, when I go to (2,1), I am at y=1, which is near the bottom wall, but as long as I move away, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (2,2) but not (2,1), to avoid the corner.\n\nBut (2,1) is there, and I can eat it easily, so why not? Score +1.\n\nAnd since it has value, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I have more length, but that might be good for score, but could increase risk, but with careful play, should be fine.\n\nPerhaps consider moving right first to avoid going straight down.\n\nFor example, turn 5 move R to (3,5), then down to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut then to reach (2,2), I need to go left, which might take more time.\n\nFor instance, turn 5: move R to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,4)? But direction from (3,4), previous move D, so moving L is not reverse, ok. Move to (2,4), no food, positions [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,3), no food, positions [(2,3), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,2), eat, but on turn 9, (2,2) life_span: from turn 5, after 4 turns, on turn 9 life_span=1>0, can eat.\n\nBut I reached on turn 9, just in time, whereas in direct down, I ate on turn 7.\n\nAnd I missed (2,1) because on turn 10 I might not reach it if I go this way.\n\nAfter eating (2,2) on turn 9, at (2,2), then to (2,1) on turn 10, but (2,1) on turn 10, life_span=1>0? As before, on turn 10 can eat.\n\nBut from (2,2) to (2,1) is one move down, turn 10.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut in this path, I ate only (2,2) on turn 9, and (2,1) on turn 10, but not (6,6), which is gone.\n\nAnd I used turns 5-7 to move to (3,4) etc., which didn't eat food, whereas in direct down, I ate (2,2) on turn 7 and (2,1) on turn 8, so earlier.\n\nAnd then I can start moving to (5,4) earlier.\n\nIn direct down, on turn 8 after eating (2,1), I can start moving right.\n\nIn the indirect path, on turn 9 I eat (2,2), turn 10 eat (2,1), same as turn 8 in direct, but with extra moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo direct down is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 5, move D.\n\nThen sequence as above.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list actions.\n\nAlso, think about the internal obstacle.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, but not relevant for now.\n\nIn the sequence to (5,4), I need to avoid (6,4).\n\nBut later.\n\nNow, for the answer, I'll provide actions from turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D (to eat (2,1))\n\nOn turn 8, after turn 7, positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nMove D to (2,1), which is valid, and eat.\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,1), direction D, move R to (3,1)\n\nNow, is moving R on turn 9 the best? I could move L to (1,1), but right is towards the center and (5,4).\n\nSo R is fine.\n\nTo be specific.\n\nIn the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the boxed format.\n\nSo for turn 5 to 9.\n\nBut turn 9 action is R.\n\nNow, confirm the directions.\n\nTurn 5: start, head (2,5), move D to (2,4)\n\nAfter, direction D.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (2,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,2), eat, direction D.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,1), eat, direction D.\n\nTurn 9: head at (2,1), cannot D, cannot U (reverse), so move R to (3,1) or L to (1,1). I choose R.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: R\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7 and 8 are both D, which is fine, not reverse.\n\nAfter turn 9 move to (3,1), direction R? Previous move was D on turn 8, but on turn 9 I moved R, so new direction is R.\n\nThen I can continue to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut for the output, since I think 5 turns ahead, this should be ok.\n\nTo maximize, but I think this is good.\n\nAnother point: the food at (5,4) might be under snake or something, but not, snake is at (2,y), (5,4) free.\n\nAlso, special case: food can spawn under body, but here no food under body now.\n\nSo I think fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the strategy is to target the closest positive food with the shortest remaining life span first. The food at (2,2) has a life span of 5 (countdown starting at turn 5), meaning it must be eaten by turn 9 to avoid disappearance. It is only 3 cells away (Manhattan distance) from the snake head at (2,5), making it the most accessible high-priority target. After eating (2,2), the food at (2,1) is directly below and can be eaten immediately, as it has a longer life span (6 turns) and is safe to consume. This path yields +2 score quickly and positions the snake to later navigate toward (5,4), which has a long life span (9 turns), ensuring it can be eaten after securing the near-term rewards.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan (5+ Turns Ahead)\n- **Immediate Moves (Turns 5-8)**: Move directly down to eat (2,2) by turn 7 and (2,1) by turn 8. This is efficient and avoids the risk of missing short-life foods.\n- **Avoiding (6,6)**: (6,6) is 5 cells away and must be eaten by turn 9, but reaching it would require 5 moves (arriving on turn 9). However, prioritizing (2,2) and (2,1) instead ensures +2 score vs. +1 from (6,6), and the snake cannot reach both in time due to their positions.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (2,1), the snake is at (2,1) near the bottom wall (y=0). Moving right (e.g., to (3,1)) on turn 9 avoids the wall and starts navigation toward (5,4), which has ample time (until turn 13). This path keeps the snake away from tight spaces and the internal obstacle at (6,4).\n- **Risks Mitigated**: \n  - No tail reward danger: The tail never has food during this sequence.\n  - Collision avoidance: Moving down to (2,1) is safe as the snake is short, and moving right on turn 9 prevents entrapment near y=0.\n  - Wall and obstacle: Borders (y=0, y=7, x=0, x=7) and (6,4) are avoided by the path.\n- **Score Maximization**: Eating (2,2) and (2,1) by turn 8 gives +2, with (5,4) achievable later for +1. Missing (6,6) is acceptable as it scores less than the alternative.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 5-9)\nThe actions below are based on the current state and 5-turns-ahead planning. All moves are valid (no instant reverse, no collisions, within grid).\n\n- **Turn 5 (Current)**: Move down (D) to (2,4). (No food, snake length remains 2.)\n- **Turn 6**: Move down (D) to (2,3). (No food, snake length 2.)\n- **Turn 7**: Move down (D) to (2,2). Eat positive food (+1, snake length increases to 3).\n- **Turn 8**: Move down (D) to (2,1). Eat positive food (+1, snake length increases to 4).\n- **Turn 9**: Move right (R) to (3,1). (No food, snake length 4; starts movement toward (5,4) for future turns.)\n\nAfter turn 9, the snake can continue toward (5,4) (e.g., via (4,1), (5,1), then up to (5,4)), with (5,4) eatable by turn 12-13 safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: D \\\\\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 7, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,4), and the body is at (3,5). Since the head direction is down, that means the snake is moving downwards. The head is at (3,4) and direction is D, so moving down would decrease y, but let's confirm the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which probably means y increases as we go up, so U is up, increasing y. But let's see: U (x,y+1) – if y+1 is up, then higher y is up. D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y. L is (x-1,y), left decreases x. R is (x+1,y), right increases x.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Since y=0 and y=7, and U is y+1, probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,4), body (3,5). Head direction is D, down. So from (3,5) to (3,4)? Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So head is (3,4), then body is (3,5). But if head is moving down, from where? Direction is D, so it was moving down to reach (3,4). Let's think about the movement.\n\nAt turn 7, snake head is at (3,4), and it arrived there by moving down. Since direction is D, it must have come from above, so previous head position was (3,5), but (3,5) is now the body segment. Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5)], so head is (3,4), tail is (3,5). Since it moved down to (3,4), the previous position must have been (3,5) for the head, but now that's the body. So the snake is short, only two segments.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction down, so it can move down, left, or right, but not up because no instant reverse. Current direction D, so cannot move U (opposite) next. Allowed moves: since direction is D, it can move D, L, or R. Cannot move U.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life_span 3\n\n- (6,6) with value 1, life_span 3\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life_span 4\n\n- (5,4) with value 1, life_span 7\n\n- (4,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1, and it says \"value1\", but in the description, positive food is +1, negative is -1. Here all values are 1, so all are positive food? But let's check the food list:\n\nFood: (2,2,3,1) – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value), so (2,2) with life_span 3, value 1.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6,3,1) life_span 3, value 1\n\n(2,1,4,1) life_span 4, value 1\n\n(5,4,7,1) life_span 7, value 1\n\n(4,5,10,1) life_span 10, value 1\n\nAll have value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned. So I need to eat these to grow.\n\nLife_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. Current turn is 7, so for each food:\n\n- (2,2): life_span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns from now? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span is L, it disappears after exactly L turns, meaning it can be eaten for L more turns? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, at turn t, if food has life_span N, it means:\n\n- On turn t, countdown is N\n\n- On turn t+1, countdown is N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- On turn t + N - 1, countdown is 1\n\n- On turn t + N, it disappears, so not available to eat on turn t+N or later.\n\nIt can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n\nFor example, life_span 3 at turn 7: countdown starts at 3 on turn 7, so it can be eaten on turns 7, 8, 9. Disappears on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, life_span 4: turns 7,8,9,10, disappears turn 11.\n\nLife_span 7: turns 7 to 13, disappears turn 14.\n\nLife_span 10: turns 7 to 16, disappears turn 17.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (6,4), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake head at (3,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4):\n\n- Down (D): to (3,3) – but y=3, which is within bounds, and no wall? Walls are borders, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, but (3,3) is fine. Also, no internal obstacle mentioned except (6,4), so (3,3) should be empty.\n\n- Left (L): to (2,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,4)\n\nCannot move up (U) because opposite to current direction D.\n\nNow, check if these cells are occupied or have food.\n\nFirst, (3,3): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,4) head, (3,5) body. (3,3) is not listed, so should be free, unless there's food or something. Food is at (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (5,4), (4,5). (3,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): not in snake positions, not in food, not wall, so empty.\n\n(4,4): similarly empty.\n\nNow, food at (5,4) and (4,5) are close.\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4, which is near the head at (3,4). (4,5) is at x=4,y=5.\n\nAlso, (2,2) and (2,1) are on the left, (6,6) far.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list all food and their expiration:\n\n- (2,2): life_span 3, so available turns 7,8,9\n\n- (6,6): life_span 3, available turns 7,8,9\n\n- (2,1): life_span 4, available turns 7,8,9,10\n\n- (5,4): life_span 7, available turns 7 to 13\n\n- (4,5): life_span 10, available turns 7 to 16\n\nThe short-life food are (2,2), (6,6), (2,1) expiring soon.\n\n(2,1) has life_span 4, so available until turn 10.\n\n(5,4) and (4,5) have longer life.\n\nNow, snake is short, only two segments. Eating food increases length by one for positive food.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5). So tail is at (3,5).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Head (3,4), tail (3,5). They are adjacent vertically, since y differs by 1, x same.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so yes, (3,4) and (3,5) are adjacent.\n\nNow, is there food on the tail cell? Tail is (3,5). Food positions: (2,2), (6,6), (2,1), (5,4), (4,5). (4,5) is at (4,5), which is different from (3,5). (3,5) has no food listed. So no food on tail.\n\nTherefore, no immediate danger from that.\n\nBut if I move in a way that later the tail has food and head is adjacent, I need to be careful.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,4):\n\n- D to (3,3)\n\n- L to (2,4)\n\n- R to (4,4)\n\nI need to simulate a few turns ahead.\n\nAlso, when the snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nCurrently, snake length 2.\n\nGoal is to maximize score, so eat as much as possible without dying.\n\nBut prioritize survival.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options.\n\nFirst, move down to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: then direction would be D, so can go D, L, R. Cannot U.\n\nD to (3,2): which is towards (2,2) food, but (2,2) is at (2,2), so from (3,3) to (3,2) is down, then to (2,2) would be left or down-left, but need to move to adjacent cells.\n\n(3,2) to (2,2) is left, adjacent.\n\nBut (2,2) food is available until turn 9, so I have time.\n\nFrom (3,3), I could go left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nBut let's think about eating (5,4) or (4,5) which are closer.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), head is at (3,4), so same y, x=5 vs x=3, so two steps right.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is at (4,5), head at (3,4), so one up and one right, but I cannot move up directly because of direction.\n\nCurrent direction D, so from (3,4), if I move right to (4,4), then I can go to (5,4) from there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is above, but I need to go up later.\n\nLet's list all food distances:\n\n- (2,2): Manhattan distance |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3? Head (3,4), food (2,2): Δx=1, Δy=2, dist=3.\n\n- (6,6): |3-6| + |4-6| = 3+2=5\n\n- (2,1): |3-2| + |4-1| =1+3=4\n\n- (5,4): |3-5| + |4-4| =2+0=2\n\n- (4,5): |3-4| + |4-5| =1+1=2\n\nSo (5,4) and (4,5) are both distance 2.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), same row, so if I move right to (4,4) or directly? From (3,4) to (5,4) is two steps right, but I have to move one step at a time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is at (4,5), which is one right and one up from (3,4).\n\nBut I cannot move up now.\n\nNow, (5,4) has life_span 7, so plenty of time, but it might be good to eat soon to grow and have more flexibility.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has long life.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), which is adjacent to (5,4). (6,4) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\n(5,4) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) now, then from there I can go to (5,4) to eat it on next turn.\n\nFrom (3,4), move R to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 8, head at (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 3.\n\nTail is at (3,5), after move to (4,4), snake positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), tail (3,5)? After moving from (3,4) to (4,4), the body was (3,5), so new positions: head (4,4), and body segments: the previous head becomes body, so snake becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].\n\nThen when I move to (5,4) and eat food, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), and tail (3,5) stays, but since I ate, a new segment is added, so snake length 3: head (5,4), body (4,4), and tail (3,4)? Let's clarify snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, tail moves away, so tail cell is vacated.\n\n- If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new head position, and body segments move similarly, but tail does not move, so the tail cell remains occupied, and a new segment is added at the tail, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, if on turn 7, move to (4,4), no food there, so snake moves: head to (4,4), body (3,4) which was head, now body, and tail (3,5) moves? The body segment that was at (3,5) moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which is (3,4), but (3,4) is now occupied by the new body? Let's think.\n\nInitial positions: segment 0: head (3,4), segment 1: body (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,4): new head at (4,4), then segment 0 (old head) becomes body at (3,4), but segment 1 was at (3,5), and it should move to where segment 0 was, which is now (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied? No, when moving, the body segments move one by one.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second body segment moves to the old first body position, and so on, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo for two segments: head and one body.\n\nAfter move: head to new position, the body moves to the old head position.\n\nSo from [(3,4), (3,5)] move to, say, (4,4): new head (4,4), body moves to old head position (3,4), so new positions [(4,4), (3,4)]. The tail (3,5) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (3,3): head (3,3), body (3,4)\n\nOr move to (2,4): head (2,4), body (3,4)\n\nNow, back to eating.\n\nIf on turn 7, I move R to (4,4), no food there, so positions: head (4,4), body (3,4)\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen on turn 8, I can move R to (5,4). (5,4) has food, so I eat it. Snake grows: head moves to (5,4), body moves to (4,4), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, but where is the tail? After moving to (4,4) on turn 7, tail was at (3,4)? Positions are [(4,4), (3,4)], so tail is (3,4).\n\nWhen I eat food at (5,4), head moves to (5,4), the body segment moves to the previous head position (4,4), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (3,4) before the move? Let's clarify.\n\nBefore move on turn 8: positions [(4,4), (3,4)] head at (4,4), tail at (3,4)\n\nMove head to (5,4): since (5,4) has food, head moves to (5,4), then the body segment (at (3,4)) moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which is the head at (4,4). So body moves to (4,4). And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, which is (3,4). So new positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), body (3,4). So snake length 3.\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nNow, (5,4) is near the obstacle at (6,4), which is a wall, so from (5,4), I cannot move right to (6,4), since it's a wall. So possible moves from (5,4): direction R (since moved right), so can move U, D, L? Cannot R because wall, and cannot move opposite? Opposite to R is L, so can move L, U, D.\n\nBut L to (4,4) is the body, which would cause collision.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (4,4), body (3,4). So (4,4) is occupied by body, so I cannot move left to (4,4), that would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (5,3), or up to (5,5), if possible.\n\n(5,5) is y=5, within bounds, no wall.\n\n(5,3) similarly.\n\nBut (5,4) has walls? x=5, y=4, not border, so ok.\n\nBut from (5,4), after eating, on turn 8, positions as above.\n\nThen on turn 9, I need to move from (5,4). Possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), or L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, so collision, cannot. R to (6,4) is wall, cannot. So only U or D.\n\nSay move U to (5,5). Then positions: head (5,5), body moves to (5,4), and tail (3,4) moves to (4,4)? After move, no food, so head to (5,5), body to (5,4), and tail (3,4) moves to where? The body segment that was at (4,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's step by step.\n\nBefore move: positions [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] head (5,4), segment 1 (4,4), segment 2 (3,4)\n\nMove head to (5,5): new head (5,5), then segment 1 moves to old head position (5,4), segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,4). So new positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (5,3), head (5,3), body (5,4), body (4,4)\n\nNow, back to turn 7.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) and then to (5,4) to eat, I end up at (5,4) with limited moves, only up or down, and the body is behind.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,5), which is at (4,5), above.\n\nBut from (5,4), I can go up to (5,5), but (4,5) is left and up from there.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,5) is left.\n\nBut (4,5) has food with life_span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAnother option: from (3,4), move L to (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 7, head to (2,4), body to (3,4)\n\nNo food at (2,4), so positions [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) or (2,5) or (1,4), but (1,4) x=1, not wall, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 ok.\n\nBut (2,2) food is below at (2,2), so from (2,4) move down to (2,3), then to (2,2) to eat.\n\n(2,2) available until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) below.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother move: down to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go left to (2,3), down to (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) to eat (2,2).\n\n(2,2) dist 2 from (3,3)? From (3,4) to (3,3) is one move, then to (2,3) or (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, I have (4,5) food at (4,5), which is close.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I move right to (4,4), I can go to (4,5) by moving up, but I cannot move up directly from (3,4) because direction down, and U is opposite.\n\nFrom (3,4), move R to (4,4), then on turn 8, head at (4,4), direction R, so I can move U to (4,5), which has food, so eat (4,5) on turn 8.\n\nLet's simulate that.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,4). No food there. Positions: head (4,4), body (3,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,5). (4,5) has food, so eat it. Snake grows.\n\nBefore move: positions [(4,4), (3,4)] head (4,4), tail (3,4)\n\nMove head to (4,5): food eaten, so head to (4,5), body moves to (4,4), and new segment added at previous tail position (3,4). So new positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), body (3,4)\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection now U.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move U, D, L, R? Current direction U, so can move U, L, R. Cannot D (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\n(4,6) is y=6, not wall, y=7 wall, so ok.\n\n(3,5) was the old tail position, but now it might be free or not.\n\nAfter move to (4,5), positions: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (3,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) empty.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,4) below, but I cannot move down because direction U, and D is opposite, so cannot move D to (4,4) which is body anyway.\n\n(4,4) is body, so even if I could, collision.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can only move U, L, or R.\n\nMove U to (4,6), or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, (5,5) free.\n\n(5,4) food is below, but I cannot go down directly.\n\nI could go left or right and then down later.\n\nBut (5,4) has life_span 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nThere is also (2,2) food expiring soon.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), which is far from (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), to reach (2,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut I cannot go down directly, so I have to go left or right or up first.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5), then from there I can go down to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, so I need to be careful.\n\nAfter turn 8, positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), body (3,4)\n\nIf I move L to (3,5) on turn 9: head to (3,5), no food there, so positions: head (3,5), body moves to (4,5), and body (3,4) moves to (4,4)? Before move: segments: head (4,5), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (3,4)\n\nMove head to (3,5): new head (3,5), seg1 moves to old head (4,5), seg2 moves to old seg1 position (4,4). So positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\n(3,4) is now free.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,4) or (2,5) or (3,6), etc.\n\n(3,4) is now free, so I can move down to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (2,4) or (3,3) towards (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) available until turn 9, so on turn 9, I can be at (3,5), move to (3,4) on turn 10, but turn 10 is after turn 9, and (2,2) disappears on turn 10? Life_span 3 from turn 7: available turns 7,8,9. Disappears on turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 9, I can eat it if I reach on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 9, if I'm at (3,5), I can move to (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,6), not directly to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,2) is not adjacent; I need multiple moves.\n\nOn turn 8, I'm at (4,5), and (2,2) is at (2,2), Manhattan distance |4-2| + |5-2| = 2+3=5, so at least 5 moves away, but I have only turns 8 and 9 to eat it, since disappears on turn 10, but last chance turn 9.\n\nOn turn 8, I'm at (4,5), I need to reach (2,2) by turn 9, but from (4,5) to (2,2) is min 3 moves: e.g., (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) — that's 4 moves to (2,2), but I need to be there on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 8, I'm at (4,5), on turn 9 I can move to adjacent cell, so at best (3,5) or (4,4) or (5,5), none is (2,2). So I cannot reach (2,2) on turn 8 or 9 from (4,5). On turn 8 I'm at (4,5), turn 9 I move to say (3,5), still not (2,2). Turn 10 it disappears, so I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nIf I want to eat (2,2), I need to be closer.\n\nFor example, from turn 7, if I move down to (3,3), then on turn 8 I can move to (2,3) or (3,2), then on turn 9 to (2,2) if I go to (2,3) first.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3). Positions: head (3,3), body (3,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3), or D to (3,2), or R to (4,3)\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), no food, positions: head (2,3), body (3,3)\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3), I can move L to (1,3), D to (2,2), or U to (2,4), etc.\n\nMove D to (2,2), eat food. Yes, on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 8 I move D to (3,2) from (3,3), then turn 9 move L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nSo possible to eat (2,2) by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for other short-life food.\n\nBut (6,6) is far, Manhattan dist 5 from (3,4), and available only turns 7,8,9. On turn 7 I'm at (3,4), turn 8 I can move, but to reach (6,6) min 5 moves, so by turn 9 I can be at most at, say, after two moves from (3,4), e.g. to (4,4) then (5,4), but (5,4) is not (6,6), and on turn 9 I can move to (5,5) or (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so (5,5), still not (6,6). Turn 10 it disappears, so I cannot eat (6,6) in time. Similarly, no way to reach it by turn 9, so (6,6) is impossible to eat; it will expire.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has life_span 4, available turns 7,8,9,10. From (3,4), dist 4, so I can reach it by turn 10, e.g. via (2,2) or directly.\n\nBut (2,2) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nI also need to consider the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if I eat food and the tail is adjacent, it could be dangerous.\n\nBut currently, no food on tail.\n\nNow, let's think about (4,5) and (5,4).\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is adjacent to head (3,4)? (3,4) to (4,5) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\nSo (3,4) adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). Not to (4,5) directly.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is adjacent to (4,4) and (5,3), (5,5), etc.\n\nTo eat (4,5), from (3,4) I need to go to (4,4) then to (4,5), but to go to (4,5) I need to move up, which I can do after moving right.\n\nSimilarly for (5,4), go to (4,4) then (5,4).\n\nBut if I go to (5,4), I might get stuck.\n\nAnother option: move down to (3,3) to go for (2,2).\n\nOr move left to (2,4) to go for (2,2) or (2,1).\n\nLet's list the food I can eat soon.\n\nPossible to eat (2,2) by turn 9 if I go towards it.\n\n(2,1) by turn 10.\n\n(4,5) or (5,4) can be eaten later.\n\nBut (5,4) is near the wall, so eating it might limit movements.\n\n(4,5) is safer.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but currently short, so growing is good for survival? Not necessarily, longer snake is harder to avoid collision, but in open space, it's ok.\n\nGrid has walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), which blocks the right side.\n\nNow, to maximize long-term, I should eat the expiring food first if possible, since they will disappear.\n\n(2,2) and (6,6) expire soon, but (6,6) unreachable, so only (2,2) can be eaten.\n\n(2,1) can be eaten later.\n\n(4,5) and (5,4) have long life.\n\nSo perhaps go for (2,2) first.\n\nThen after that, go for other food.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nSuppose on turn 7, I move down to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 8, move left to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 9, move down to (2,2) and eat. Snake grows to length 3.\n\nPositions after turn 9: after eating (2,2), head at (2,2), body segments: before move, on turn 8, after move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (3,3)\n\nThen turn 9, move to (2,2), eat food. So head to (2,2), body moves to (2,3), and new segment added at previous tail position, which was (3,3). So positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), body (3,3)\n\nDirection: after moving down to (2,2), direction D.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2). Cannot U (opposite to D).\n\n(2,1) has food, so I can eat it on turn 10.\n\nMove D to (2,1), eat food. Snake grows to length 4.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] head (2,2), tail (3,3)\n\nMove to (2,1): food eaten, head to (2,1), body moves to (2,2), body (2,3) moves to (2,3)? Segments: head (2,2), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (3,3)\n\nMove head to (2,1): head (2,1), seg1 moves to old head (2,2), seg2 moves to old seg1 position (2,3). Then new segment added at old tail position (3,3). So positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), body (2,3), body (3,3)\n\nLength 4.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move D to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot. L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision, cannot. So only L or R.\n\nSay move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut now, (4,5) and (5,4) are still there, I can go towards them.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move R to (3,1), then to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut the snake is longer, might be tricky.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), on turn 10, I'm at (2,1), with body at (2,2), (2,3), (3,3).\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), body (2,2), body (2,3) — seg2 moves to (2,2), seg3 moves to (2,3), and tail (3,3) moves to? After move, no food, so head to (3,1), seg1 to (2,1), seg2 to (2,2), seg3 to (2,3), and tail position vacated, so positions [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]? Let's not list all.\n\nThe point is, I can then move up or right.\n\nBut (4,5) and (5,4) are at y=5 and y=4, so I need to go up.\n\nBut it's possible.\n\nIf on turn 7 I move directly to (4,4) or something to eat (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nFor example, turn 7 move R to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 8 move U to (4,5) eat.\n\nThen I have snake length 3 at (4,5), with body at (4,4) and (3,4).\n\nThen I can move, say, L to (3,5) on turn 9, then to (3,4) but (3,4) is body? Positions: after turn 8, head (4,5), body (4,4), body (3,4)\n\nMove L to (3,5): head (3,5), body (4,5), body (4,4) — seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (4,4)\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4), but (3,4) is now where seg2 was, but after move to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)], so (3,4) is free.\n\nMove down to (3,4), no food, positions head (3,4), body (3,5), body (4,5)\n\nThen I can go towards (2,2), but (2,2) expires turn 9, on turn 9 I'm at (3,5) or (3,4), not (2,2), so I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) I can eat later, turn 10.\n\nOn turn 9, from (3,5), I can move to (2,5) or (3,4), etc.\n\nTo eat (2,1), I need to go down.\n\nBut let's see the life_span.\n\n(2,1) available until turn 10.\n\nOn turn 8, if I'm at (4,5), to reach (2,1) by turn 10, distance |4-2| + |5-1| = 2+4=6, min 6 moves, but on turn 8 I'm at (4,5), turn 9 move to say (3,5), turn 10 move to (2,5) or (3,4), not (2,1). To reach (2,1) on turn 10, I need to be adjacent on turn 9, but on turn 9 I'm at (4,5) or after move, at best (3,5) or (4,4), neither adjacent to (2,1). |3-2| + |5-1| =1+4=5, not adjacent. So I cannot reach (2,1) by turn 10 if I go to (4,5) on turn 8.\n\nTherefore, if I want to eat (2,1), I need to be closer on turn 7.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2), I need to be moving towards it from turn 7.\n\nSo to eat both (2,2) and (2,1), I should go down and left.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (2,2) and (2,1), I have a longer snake, and I can go to the center to eat (4,5) or (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has life_span 7, available until turn 13, and (4,5) until turn 16.\n\nAlso, the grid has an obstacle at (6,4), so (5,4) is a bit risky because from there, only up or down, as we saw earlier.\n\nWhereas (4,5) is more open.\n\nMoreover, (4,5) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,5) is on the body or something? Currently, snake is at (3,4) and (3,5), (4,5) is free.\n\nBut if I move there, it might be under body later.\n\nBut I can eat it before that.\n\nNow, to avoid risks, going for the expiring food first might be better, since they are on the left side, away from the obstacle.\n\nAlso, the bottom-left is less constrained.\n\nWhereas near (5,4) and (6,4) wall, it might be tight.\n\nSo perhaps on turn 7, move down to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 8, move left to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 9, move down to (2,2) and eat.\n\nThen turn 10, move down to (2,1) and eat.\n\nThen from (2,1), I need to move, say, right to (3,1), then up to (3,2), etc., to go towards (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) can be eaten later.\n\nNow, after eating (2,1) on turn 10, I'm at (2,1) with length 4, as before.\n\nThen I can move right to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is at y=5, so I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (4,5) on turn 12 or something.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify actions for multiple turns, but the format is to output actions from turn t1 onwards for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many. Probably I need to provide a sequence for the immediate future.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to provide a sequence, but how many? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think ahead, I should provide at least 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut for now, I can start with turn 7.\n\nPerhaps I should commit to a path.\n\nAnother idea: I could eat (4,5) first since it's close, and then go for (2,2) if possible, but (2,2) expires soon.\n\nIf on turn 7 move R to (4,4), turn 8 move U to (4,5) eat, then on turn 9 I'm at (4,5), and (2,2) is far, cannot reach by turn 9, so I miss (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) I might reach by turn 10 if I go directly, but from (4,5) to (2,1) min 5 moves, on turn 8 at (4,5), turn 9 move to (3,5), turn 10 move to (2,5) or (3,4), not (2,1); to reach (2,1) on turn 10, I need to be at (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1) or (2,0) but (2,0) wall, so (2,2), (1,1), (3,1). From (4,5) on turn 8, I can be at (3,5) on turn 9, then on turn 10 move to (2,5) or (3,4), not to (2,1) directly. (2,1) is at y=1, so I need to go down, but I'm at y=5. So it would take multiple turns down, at least 4 moves to decrease y by 4, plus x, so min 4 moves to decrease y to 1, but x also, so from (4,5) to (2,1) |Δx|=2, |Δy|=4, min 6 moves. Turn 8 at (4,5), so by turn 10, after 2 moves, I can be at y=3 or 4, not 1. So impossible to reach (2,1) by turn 10.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (4,5) on turn 8, I miss both (2,2) and (2,1).\n\nWhereas if I go left-down, I can eat both.\n\nMoreover, (4,5) and (5,4) have long life, so I can eat them later.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is impossible, so no loss.\n\nSo better to go for the expiring food.\n\nThus, on turn 7, move down to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 8, move left to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 9, move down to (2,2) and eat.\n\nThen turn 10, move down to (2,1) and eat.\n\nNow, after that, I need to decide.\n\nOn turn 10, after eating (2,1), positions as before: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can only move L or R, since D to (2,0) wall, U to (2,2) body.\n\nSay move R to (3,1).\n\nThen positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) — after move, no food, so head to (3,1), body to (2,1), body to (2,2), body to (2,3), and tail (3,3) moves? Before move: segments head (2,1), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (3,3)\n\nMove head to (3,1): new head (3,1), seg1 to (2,1), seg2 to (2,2), seg3 to (2,3), and the previous tail position (3,3) vacated. So positions [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, cannot, L to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, cannot, R to (4,1). So only U or R.\n\nMove U to (3,2), no food there, then to (3,3), etc.\n\nThen I can go to (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) might be eaten later.\n\nNow for the sequence, I can provide turns 7 to 10 or 11.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but for output, I'll start with the moves to eat the food.\n\nSo for turn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 9: D (to (2,2) eat)\n\nThen turn 10: D (to (2,1) eat)\n\nNow, after that, on turn 11, I need to move from (2,1), but after turn 10, I'm at (2,1) after eating, so on turn 11, from (2,1), I have to move, say R to (3,1) as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I can include that.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and I have a plan.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (2,3) on turn 8, is there any issue? (2,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) on turn 9.\n\nAlso, life_span: (2,2) available turn 9, yes.\n\n(2,1) available turn 10, yes.\n\nNow, for turn 11, from (2,1), after moving to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide the actions for the next few turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: turns 7 to 11.\n\nSo turn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nThen turn 11: from (2,1), after eating (2,1), positions as above, I need to move, say R to (3,1)\n\nBut on turn 10, after moving to (2,1) and eating, direction D, so from (2,1), on turn 11, I can move L or R.\n\nI choose R to (3,1).\n\nThen turn 12, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut to go to (4,5), I need to move up and right.\n\nBut since (4,5) has long life, I can take time.\n\nSimilarly, I should avoid the area near (5,4) because of the wall.\n\n(5,4) is food, but I can eat it later if possible.\n\nBut with the snake longer, it might be tight.\n\nFor now, the sequence to eat the expiring food.\n\nSo I think moving down first is the best.\n\nBut on turn 7, moving down to (3,3) is one option.\n\nI could move left to (2,4) first, then down to (2,3), then to (2,2).\n\nBut similar.\n\nMove left: from (3,4) to (2,4), then turn 8 to (2,3), turn 9 to (2,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 10 to (2,1) eat.\n\nSame as before, but from (2,4) to (2,3) is down, then to (2,2) down.\n\nIf I move left to (2,4) on turn 7, direction L, then turn 8 move D to (2,3), then turn 9 move D to (2,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 10 move D to (2,1) eat.\n\nBut from (2,4), moving down to (2,3), etc.\n\nSlightly different path but same result.\n\nMoving down first might be better because from (3,3), I have more options on turn 8, like I could go to (3,2) if needed, but for (2,2), going left is fine.\n\nBut in this case, moving down or left both lead to similar.\n\nBut with moving down, I start decreasing y earlier, but not significant.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction D, if I move L or R, I change direction, but if I move D, I keep direction.\n\nBut not important.\n\nI think I'll go with moving down on turn 7.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L (to (2,3) or to (3,2)? To go to (2,2), from (3,3) moving L to (2,3) is better, then D to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) moving D to (3,2), then L to (2,2), also works.\n\nBut (2,3) to (2,2) is down, same as (3,2) to (2,2) left.\n\nBut since I need to eat (2,2) on turn 9, both work.\n\nBut from (3,3), if I go to (3,2) on turn 8, then to (2,2) on turn 9, but (2,2) is at (2,2), from (3,2) to (2,2) is left.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) to (2,2) is down.\n\nNow, after that, to eat (2,1), from (2,2) move down to (2,1).\n\nIf I am at (2,2) on turn 9, I move down to (2,1) on turn 10.\n\nIf I were at (3,2) on turn 8, I could move to (3,1) or something, but for (2,1), it's better to be at (2,2).\n\nSo going via (2,3) is fine.\n\nThus, turn 7: D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: L to (2,3)  // assuming from (3,3) move left\n\nTurn 9: D to (2,2) eat\n\nTurn 10: D to (2,1) eat\n\nThen for turn 11, from (2,1), move R to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 12, from (3,1), move U to (3,2), for example.\n\nBut I don't need to specify further, or I can for a few more turns.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead but output from current turn, I'll provide up to turn 11 or so.\n\nNow, to confirm the tail reward danger: at some point, if tail has food and head adjacent, but in this sequence, when I eat (2,2) on turn 9, tail is at (3,3), head at (2,2), not adjacent. |2-3| + |2-3| =1+1=2, not adjacent. Similarly, when eat (2,1), tail at (3,3) or where? On turn 9, after eating (2,2), positions head (2,2), body (2,3), body (3,3)\n\nTail at (3,3), head (2,2), distance sqrt(2), not adjacent horizontally or vertically, so ok.\n\nThen move to (2,1), eat, head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), tail at (3,3), head (2,1), not adjacent.\n\nThen move to (3,1), etc., no issue.\n\nAlso, walls: all moves within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), not relevant for now.\n\nSo I think this is a safe plan to get two food and grow the snake.\n\nThen I can head to (4,5) later.\n\n(5,4) might be risky, but I can decide later.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated possible moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food expiration**: (2,2) and (2,1) must be eaten soon (by turns 9 and 10, respectively) as they expire quickly, while (4,5) and (5,4) have longer lifespans and can be targeted later. (6,6) is unreachable before it expires on turn 10.\n- **Risk avoidance**: Moving towards the bottom-left area (where (2,2) and (2,1) are located) is safer, as the top-right near (5,4) and the obstacle at (6,4) could lead to traps with a longer snake. Eating (2,2) and (2,1) first grows the snake early, providing more flexibility.\n- **Immediate moves**: From the current head position (3,4) with direction down (D), possible moves are down (D), left (L), or right (R). Moving down to (3,3) on turn 7 starts the path toward (2,2) and (2,1), avoiding the riskier (5,4) area.\n\n**Planned sequence for turns 7-11**:\n- **Turn 7 (current)**: Move down (D) to (3,3). This keeps options open and progresses toward (2,2). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 8**: Move left (L) to (2,3). This positions the snake to eat (2,2) on the next turn. Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (2,2) and eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 3). (2,2) expires after this turn, so this captures it just in time. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 10**: Move down (D) to (2,1) and eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 4). (2,1) expires after this turn, capturing it safely. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 11**: Move right (R) to (3,1). This avoids the wall at (2,0) and body collision at (2,2), starting the journey toward the remaining food (e.g., (4,5) or (5,4)) with the longer snake.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ turns ahead**:\n- **Turns 7-10**: This sequence secures two food items with minimal risk. The snake grows to length 4, improving survivability. After turn 10, the snake is at (2,1) with body at (2,2), (2,3), and (3,3). No tail reward danger occurs, as the tail is never adjacent to the head during eating.\n- **Beyond turn 11**: The snake can head toward (4,5) (life-span 10, available until turn 16) or (5,4) (life-span 7, available until turn 13). Moving right and up from (3,1) (e.g., to (4,1), then (4,2), etc.) is safer than targeting (5,4) immediately, as (5,4) is near the obstacle and could limit movement. Survival is prioritized; if paths are blocked, the snake can avoid (5,4) and focus on (4,5).\n\nThis plan scores +2 in the next 4 turns with low risk, and sets up for further food collection.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 7\\text{: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9\\text{: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10\\text{: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11\\text{: R}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and one internal obstacle at (6,4). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, meaning I can't move to those cells.\n\nThe snake starts at positions [(2,3), (3,3)] with head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3). Head direction is left, so it was moving left last turn. Since it's moving left, the possible moves now are U, D, L, R, but I can't do an instant reverse. Instant reverse would be right (R) because left is current direction, so opposite is right. So I cannot move right on this turn. Allowed moves are U, D, L. L is left, which is the same direction, so that should be fine. U is up, D is down, both perpendicular, so okay. R is right, opposite, not allowed.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (2,2) value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (6,6) value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (2,1) value 1, life_span 2? Wait, let's read: \" (2, 1, 2, 1) \" – I think it's (x,y, value, life_span). In the input it says: \"(2, 2, 1, 1)\" which should be (x,y, value, life_span). Similarly, \"(6, 6, 1, 1)\" , \"(2, 1, 2, 1)\" – wait, (2,1,2,1) – is that value 2 or life_span 2? Let's see the format.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 2, 1, 1) - (6, 6, 1, 1) - (2, 1, 2, 1) - (5, 4, 5, 1) - (4, 5, 8, 1)\"\n\nI think the order is (x, y, value, life_span). So:\n\n- (2,2): value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (6,6): value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (2,1): value=2? It says (2,1,2,1), so x=2,y=1, value=2, life_span=1? But life_span=1 for all except one? Let's list:\n\n- (2,2,1,1): x=2,y=2, value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (6,6,1,1): x=6,y=6, value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (2,1,2,1): x=2,y=1, value=2, life_span=1? It says \"2,1\" for the last two, but in context, it should be value and life_span. But for (2,1,2,1), value=2, life_span=1? Then (5,4,5,1): x=5,y=4, value=5, life_span=1? Value=5? That seems high. And (4,5,8,1): x=4,y=5, value=8, life_span=1.\n\nBut life_span is given as the last number. For (2,1,2,1), it might be value=2, life_span=1, but let's confirm with the input: \" (2, 1, 2, 1) \" – and it says \"Life Span and Value\", so I think (x,y, value, life_span). Similarly, (5,4,5,1) value=5, life_span=1, and (4,5,8,1) value=8, life_span=1.\n\nBut value=8? That's unusually high; usually food is +1, but here we have values up to 8. Okay, I'll go with that.\n\nAlso, life_span: for (2,2) life_span=1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 9, if life_span=1, after turn 9 it will be gone, so it must be eaten on turn 9 to get it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life_span=1, must be eaten now or lost.\n\n(2,1) value=2, life_span=2? (2,1,2,1) – value=2, life_span=1? Life_span=1, so same as above.\n\nLet's list all food with their properties:\n\n1. Position: (2,2), value: 1, life_span: 1 → must be eaten on turn 9 or it disappears.\n\n2. Position: (6,6), value: 1, life_span: 1 → must be eaten on turn 9 or disappears.\n\n3. Position: (2,1), value: 2, life_span: 1? (2,1,2,1) – I think value=2, life_span=1, so must be eaten on turn 9 or disappears.\n\nBut it says \" (2, 1, 2, 1) \" and in the input it's written as that, but earlier it says \"Life Span and Value\", so for (2,1,2,1), it might be ambiguous. Let's read the input carefully.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n\t- (2, 2, 1, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 1, 1)\n\t- (2, 1, 2, 1)\n\t- (5, 4, 5, 1)\n\t- (4, 5, 8, 1)\"\n\nI think it's safe to assume the format is (x, y, value, life_span). So:\n\n- (2,2): value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (6,6): value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (2,1): value=2, life_span=1\n\n- (5,4): value=5, life_span=1\n\n- (4,5): value=8, life_span=1\n\nAll have life_span=1? But for (2,1) it says \"2,1\" which could be misread, but I think value=2, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4,5,1) value=5, life_span=1\n\n(4,5,8,1) value=8, life_span=1\n\nBut life_span=1 for all, meaning all food must be eaten this turn or they disappear. That seems odd, but possible.\n\nThe problem says \"Life-span disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\" So at turn 9, life_span=1, it will disappear after turn 9, so to eat it, must be on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nBut there's also the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, snake positions: head at (2,3), body at (3,3), so tail is at (3,3).\n\nFood at (2,2), (2,1), etc.\n\n(2,2) is adjacent to head? Head at (2,3), (2,2) is directly below, since y decreases down? Let's define coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 is top, y increases down, or y=0 bottom? The walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, but not specified which is top.\n\nIn the state, snake positions: [(2,3), (3,3)], and head direction left, so from (2,3) to (3,3) is from left to right? Head at (2,3), moving left, so it was at (3,3) previous turn, moved left to (2,3), so direction left means decreasing x.\n\nNow, coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So probably, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Doesn't matter, but let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up, or y increases down?\n\nIn many games, y=0 is top, y increases down. But here, since head at (2,3), and food at (2,2), which has same x, lower y, so if y=0 is top, then (2,2) is above (2,3)? Let's see.\n\nSnake head at (2,3), moving left. Possible moves:\n\n- U: up, which is (x, y-1) if y=0 top, or (x,y+1) if y=0 bottom.\n\nThe movement constraints say: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nU: (x, y+1) — so y+1 means up or down? If U is (x,y+1), that means increasing y, so if y=0 is bottom, y+1 is up, or if y=0 is top, y+1 is down.\n\nTypically in coordinates, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, so U (up) would be decreasing y, but here it says U (x,y+1), which is y increasing, so that must be down if y=0 top.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe movement: U (x,y+1) — so for a cell (x,y), U moves to (x, y+1), which increases y. If we assume (0,0) is top-left corner, then increasing y moves down, so U would be down? But it's labeled U for up. Inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" — in the text, it says U (up) is (x,y+1). But in standard Cartesian coordinates with (0,0) top-left, up would be (x,y-1), down (x,y+1).\n\nBut here, U is defined as (x,y+1), which suggests that y+1 is upward. So probably, the coordinate system has (0,0) as bottom-left, so y increases upward.\n\nThat makes sense because U (up) is (x,y+1), so y+1 is higher, up.\n\nSimilarly, D (down) is (x,y-1), y decreases.\n\nL left (x-1,y), R right (x+1,y).\n\nAnd walls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nSo head at (2,3), which is x=2, y=3.\n\nFood at (2,2): x=2, y=2, which is down from head? Head at y=3, (2,2) is y=2, so since y increases up, y=2 is below y=3? Let's think.\n\nIf y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, then y=3 is above y=2. So (2,3) to (2,2) is moving down, since y decreases.\n\nSimilarly, U to (x,y+1) is up, D to (x,y-1) is down.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,3+1) = (2,4)\n\n- D: (2,3-1) = (2,2)\n\n- L: (2-1,3) = (1,3)\n\n- R: (2+1,3) = (3,3)\n\nBut R to (3,3) is where the body is. (3,3) is the tail, but since the tail will move, it might be okay to move there, as long as after move, the tail moves away.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nSpecifically, \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail position is safe, as long as it's not a permanent block.\n\nHere, snake positions: head (2,3), body (3,3) which is tail. So only one body segment, which is the tail.\n\nSo moving to (3,3) is okay, because after moving, the tail will move from (3,3) to... depending on the move.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), new head position (3,3), and the tail was at (3,3), but since head moves there, and snake grows only if it eats food, otherwise, tail moves to the previous head position or something.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, head goes to new position, and if no food eaten, tail is removed, so the cell is freed.\n\nIf food eaten, tail not removed, snake grows.\n\nIn this case, moving to tail position: if I move R to (3,3), which is current tail, and if no food there, then after move, new head at (3,3), and tail was at (3,3), but since it moves, the tail should move to the previous position, but previous head was (2,3), so tail moves to (2,3)? Let's think carefully.\n\nSnake positions: [head, body, ..., tail]\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,3), (3,3)] so head at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nIf I move head to new position.\n\nIf new position has food, snake grows: new head at new position, tail stays, so body segments remain, length increases.\n\nIf no food, snake moves: new head at new position, tail is removed, so the last segment is gone.\n\nSpecifically, when moving without eating:\n\n- Head moves to new cell\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n\n- Tail is removed from its position.\n\nSo if I move head to a new position, the body segments follow.\n\nIn this case, if I move head to (3,3), which is current tail position.\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,3), and the body segment that was at (3,3) is now the new position, but since it was tail, and no growth, the tail should be removed? No.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\n- Before move: segment 0 (head) at (2,3), segment 1 (tail) at (3,3)\n\n- Move head to new_pos.\n\nIf new_pos has food, then after move, segments: new head at new_pos, segment 1 now at (2,3), and a new segment is added at the end, so tail at (2,3) or something.\n\nWithout growth: head moves to new_pos, segment 1 moves to where head was, so new positions: head at new_pos, body at (2,3), and tail at (3,3) is removed? No.\n\nThe positions are updated: the head moves to new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSo for two segments: head and tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new_pos:\n\n- New head position: new_pos\n\n- The body segment (which was tail) moves to the previous head position, which is (2,3)\n\nSo new positions: [new_pos, (2,3)]\n\nThe old tail position (3,3) is now empty.\n\nIf new_pos was (3,3), then new head at (3,3), and body at (2,3), so positions [(3,3), (2,3)]\n\nNo collision because the tail moved away.\n\nSimilarly, if new_pos is not food, tail is removed, so only one segment? No, with two segments, after move without growth, it should have two segments still? Let's clarify.\n\nInitial: two segments, head and tail.\n\nAfter move without eating:\n\n- Head moves to new cell\n\n- The tail segment moves to the previous head position\n\nSo the snake still has two segments, but the tail has moved to where head was.\n\nFor example, from [(2,3), (3,3)] move head to (1,3) (left).\n\nNew positions: head at (1,3), body (which was tail) moves to (2,3), so [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3), which was previous head.\n\nIf move to (3,3), which is current tail: head moves to (3,3), body (tail) moves to previous head (2,3), so new positions [(3,3), (2,3)]\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf there was food at (3,3), then after move, head at (3,3), body at (2,3), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so new tail at (3,3)? No.\n\nWhen food eaten: head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail moves, it's added before tail moves.\n\nStandard: when eating, head moves to food, the tail does not move, so snake grows by one, with new tail at previous tail position.\n\nSo positions: new head at food position, body segments remain, and tail stays, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, if food at (3,3), and I move to it, new head at (3,3), body at (2,3), and new tail added at (3,3)? But (3,3) is where head is, conflict.\n\nLet's not confuse.\n\nGenerally: after moving to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; the new position is added at the tail end.\n\nSo for two segments: [head, tail]\n\nMove to food at new_pos.\n\nNew positions: head at new_pos, tail remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so now [new_pos, previous tail position, and previous tail position is now body, new segment at tail position? Messy.\n\nBetter to think: the snake segments are a list. When moving without eating, the last element (tail) is removed, and new head added.\n\nWith eating, last element not removed, new head added, so length increases by one.\n\nIn code terms.\n\nInitial positions: list S = [ (2,3), (3,3) ]  # index 0 head, index 1 tail.\n\nMove to new_pos.\n\nIf new_pos has food:\n    New positions: [new_pos] + S  # new head, then previous head, then previous tail? No.\n\nStandard: new head at new_pos, then the previous segments remain, so new list: [new_pos] + S[:-1] if S is the list, but S[:-1] is the body without tail? Let's index.\n\nS = [P_head, P_tail] for two segments.\n\nAfter move to new_pos with food: new_head = new_pos, and the body segments are the same, but since we add a segment, the new list is [new_pos, P_head, P_tail]? No.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new_pos, and if food, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added, so positions become [new_pos, P_head, P_tail] for three segments.\n\nP_head was (2,3), P_tail (3,3), new_pos, say (1,3), then new positions [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nBut P_tail (3,3) is still there.\n\nIf new_pos is (3,3), and food at (3,3), then new positions [ (3,3), (2,3), (3,3) ] but (3,3) twice, collision.\n\nExactly the tail reward danger.\n\nIf I move to a cell that has food and it is the current tail position, then after eating, the new head is at that position, and the new tail is added at the previous tail position, which is the same cell, so it causes a collision because head and new tail are at same position.\n\nBut in the position list, it would be [new_pos, old_head, old_tail] with new_pos = old_tail, so positions have duplicate, which is invalid.\n\nSo that's why it's dangerous.\n\nIf no food, moving to tail is fine, as the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for the current state, food at (2,2), (6,6), etc., but not at (3,3), so moving to (3,3) is safe, as long as no food there.\n\nBut (3,3) has no food, so it's okay.\n\nBack to possible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U: to (2,4)  # up\n\n- D: to (2,2)  # down\n\n- L: to (1,3)  # left\n\n- R: to (3,3)  # right, but to tail, safe since no food there.\n\nAlso, R is opposite to current direction L, so I cannot move R, because instant reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent head direction is L (left), so moving right is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nL is left, same direction, U and D perpendicular.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\nAll food have life_span=1, so must be eaten this turn or disappear.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (2,2): value 1, down from head\n\n- (6,6): value 1, far away\n\n- (2,1): value 2, at (2,1), which is down from (2,2)? Head at (2,3), D to (2,2), then from there to (2,1) is another D, but not adjacent directly.\n\n- (5,4): value 5, at (5,4)\n\n- (4,5): value 8, at (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is high value, 8.\n\nBut all life_span=1, so only can be eaten this turn.\n\nNow, head at (2,3), so only food that can be reached this turn are those adjacent: (2,2) is adjacent, down.\n\n(2,1) is not adjacent, it's at (2,1), which is two steps down.\n\nSimilarly, others are far.\n\nSo only possible to eat (2,2) this turn by moving D.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (2,3); it's two cells away.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) and (4,5) are far.\n\n(6,6) far.\n\nSo only (2,2) is adjacent and can be eaten by moving D.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), I eat the food there.\n\nValue is 1, and snake grows to length 3.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, after moving D to (2,2), with food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,2), body at (2,3), and tail at (3,3)? Let's calculate.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nMove head to (2,2), which has food.\n\nSo after move: new head at (2,2), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so we add a new segment at the tail position, but the tail position is (3,3), so new positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ]  # head, body, tail.\n\nNow, head at (2,2), tail at (3,3).\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut we need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nThe food at (2,1) has value 2, life_span=1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n\nBut (2,1) is not adjacent to current head, so cannot be eaten this turn anyway.\n\nSimilarly, other food with life_span=1 will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nSince only (2,2) can be eaten this turn, the others will disappear.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is down from (2,2), but not adjacent to current head (2,3), so cannot be eaten on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4), etc., too far.\n\nSo on turn 9, only possible to eat (2,2) by moving D.\n\nIf I don't move D, I move U or L or something, then I miss (2,2), and it disappears, and I get no food this turn.\n\nBut moving D gets me +1 score and grow.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 10, head at (2,2), with direction? After moving D, new head direction is down.\n\nNow, food all disappeared except... all had life_span=1, so after turn 9, all food gone? But (2,1) had life_span=1, but not eaten, so gone. Similarly others.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) with value 8, life_span=1, but far, cannot reach this turn, so it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo after turn 9, no food left? But new food might spawn, but the problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning. In the state, only these foods are given, and after they disappear, no food? But that can't be, probably new food spawns, but the AI doesn't control that, I think we have to assume only the given food, or does food respawn?\n\nThe core rules don't mention food spawning; only the given food with life spans.\n\nIn this case, all food has life_span=1, so after turn 9, if not eaten, all gone, and no food left.\n\nBut then the game might be over or something, but snake can survive, but no food to eat, so score doesn't increase.\n\nBut we need to maximize score, so better to eat what we can.\n\nAlso, there is negative food? But in this state, all food has positive value: (2,2) value=1, (6,6) value=1, (2,1) value=2, (5,4) value=5, (4,5) value=8, all positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nSo all are positive food.\n\nBut (2,1) value=2, but cannot be eaten now.\n\nSo best to eat (2,2) now by moving D.\n\nThen on turn 10, head at (2,2), no food left, so we just move to survive.\n\nBut the grid has walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), but since no food, not relevant immediately.\n\nNow, think ahead.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nDirection: last move was D, so head direction down.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2): U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, reverse of D is U, so cannot move U.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,1), but (2,1) had food, but it disappeared after turn 9, since life_span=1, not eaten, so on turn 10, no food at (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, all cells empty except walls and obstacle.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- D: to (2,1)  # down\n\n- L: to (1,2)  # left\n\n- R: to (3,2)  # right\n\nCannot U.\n\nNow, (2,1): y=1, not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): x=1, not wall.\n\n(3,2): x=3, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), far away.\n\nSo all moves safe for now.\n\nBut no food, so just move to avoid dying.\n\nSince we need to think long-term, but no food, so survival is key, but with no food, score doesn't increase, so we can just move around safely.\n\nBut perhaps new food spawns later, but not specified, so assume only current food.\n\nIn the rules, it doesn't say new food spawns, so after these are gone, no food, so snake can move forever or until collision, but with no food, score constant.\n\nSo to maximize score, we should eat as much as possible now.\n\nBut only (2,2) can be eaten now.\n\n(2,1) could have been eaten if we were there, but we're not.\n\nPerhaps I can move to (2,1) later, but it disappears after this turn.\n\nLife_span=1 for (2,1), so after turn 9, gone.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo only choice is to eat (2,2) or not.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I miss +1, and it disappears, same as others.\n\nBut by eating, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but with length 3, still small.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,5) value 8, but I can't reach it this turn; it's at (4,5), head at (2,3), distance |4-2| + |5-3| = 2+2=4, too far for one move.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) at (5,4), |5-2| + |4-3| =3+1=4, far.\n\n(6,6) far.\n\nSo only possible food to eat is (2,2) on this turn.\n\nTherefore, I should move D to eat it.\n\nThen, on subsequent turns, since no food, I need to move safely to survive.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for multiple turns: from turn t1 to t1+ something, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns; probably for a few turns, or until it makes sense.\n\nSince no food after, I can just plan for a few moves.\n\nBut let's confirm the food life spans.\n\nAll have life_span=1 except one? No, all listed with life_span=1.\n\n(2,1,2,1) I think life_span=1.\n\nBut in the list, (4,5,8,1) life_span=1.\n\nBut there is (5,4,5,1) and (4,5,8,1), both life_span=1.\n\nBut (4,5,8,1) value 8, high.\n\nBut cannot reach.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards it, but life_span=1, so after this turn, gone.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless... is there food with longer life span?\n\n(2,1,2,1) — but life_span=1.\n\nWhat about (4,5,8,1), same.\n\nBut let's read the input: \" (2, 1, 2, 1) \" — it might be value=2, life_span=1.\n\nBut in the special cases, food can spawn under body, but here not the case.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is where I can move to.\n\nBut there is also (2,1) at (2,1), which is below (2,2), but not adjacent to current head.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), I eat that food, and on turn 10, I am at (2,2), and (2,1) is below, but it has life_span=1, so on turn 9, if not eaten, it disappears after turn 9, so on turn 10, it's gone.\n\nSo I can't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, all other food gone.\n\nSo after turn 9, no food.\n\nTherefore, the only way to score is to eat (2,2) on turn 9.\n\nIf I don't, I get zero.\n\nSo I should move D.\n\nBut let's consider not eating it to see if better, but no, since no other food, I miss the point.\n\nPerhaps I can go for other food, but impossible this turn.\n\nSo D is best.\n\nThen for future turns, I need to move safely.\n\nNow, after eating, positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nHead at (2,2), direction down (since moved D).\n\nTurn 10: from (2,2), possible moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2). Cannot U.\n\nAll are safe, no walls or body.\n\nFor example, move D to (2,1): but (2,1) was food, but gone, so no food, so snake moves without growing.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,1), body moves to (2,2), tail at (2,3)? Let's compute.\n\nBefore turn 10: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]  # head, body, tail\n\nMove head to new_pos, no food.\n\nThen new head at new_pos, body segments move to previous positions: the first body segment moves to where head was, (2,2), the tail moves to where the body was, (2,3).\n\nThe last position (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [new_pos, (2,2), (2,3)] if new_pos is (2,1), for example.\n\nThen tail at (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (1,2): new positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nOr R to (3,2): [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nAll fine.\n\nSince no food, it doesn't matter, just avoid walls and self.\n\nBut walls are only borders and (6,4), far.\n\nSo I can choose any direction.\n\nBut to think long-term, perhaps move to open area.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), moving R to (3,2) might be better to go right, towards center.\n\nBut since no food, not critical.\n\nNow, the answer should include multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nTurn 9: action\n\nTurn 10: action\n\netc.\n\nBut since no food, actions are for survival.\n\nAlso, the grid is small, 8x8, with walls.\n\ny from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\nHead at (2,2) after turn 9.\n\nTo maximize survival, move away from walls.\n\nBut with length 3, plenty of space.\n\nFor example, on turn 10, from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2), then from there, possible moves, etc.\n\nBut it's arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that food might spawn later, but not specified, so I think for the purpose, we plan with given state.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) and (4,5) have high value, but gone.\n\nBut there is a mistake: let's double-check the food life spans.\n\nInput: \" (5, 4, 5, 1) \" value 5, life_span 1\n\n\" (4, 5, 8, 1) \" value 8, life_span 1\n\nBut for (4,5,8,1), it says life_span 1, but in the list it's \" (4, 5, 8, 1) \" so yes.\n\nBut in the beginning, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but in the input it's listed as (x,y, value, life_span) I think.\n\nFor (2,1,2,1), it might be value 2, life_span 1, but let's see if there is food with longer life.\n\nNo, all life_span 1 except perhaps one.\n\n(2,1,2,1) — but it's written as (2,1,2,1), same as others.\n\nPerhaps the value is 2 and life_span 1.\n\nBut let's read the input carefully: \" - (2, 1, 2, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\" so likely value=2, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for (4,5,8,1), value=8, life_span=1.\n\nBut I can't reach it.\n\nUnless the life_span is higher for some.\n\nAnother one: \" (4, 5, 8, 1) \" last number 1, life_span.\n\nBut in the list, all end with 1, so life_span=1.\n\nSo all disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nTherefore, only (2,2) can be eaten.\n\nSo for turn 9, I must move D to eat it.\n\nThen for turn 10, I need to choose a move.\n\nLet's say from (2,2), I move R to (3,2) for example.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction right (since moved R).\n\nThen possible moves from (3,2): U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, reverse of R is L, so cannot L.\n\nAllowed U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,3), but (3,3) is where tail was, but on turn 10, after move to (3,2), positions might be different.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,2), eat food, grow to length 3: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 10: move, say R to (3,2). No food, so move without growth.\n\nNew head at (3,2), body moves: the first body segment (which was at (2,3)) moves to where head was (2,2), so to (2,2)? Positions: current positions [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,2), no food.\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nThen the body segments: the segment that was at index 1, (2,3), moves to the previous head position (2,2)\n\nThe segment that was at index 2, (3,3), moves to the previous position of index 1, which is (2,3)\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]  # head, body, tail at (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nNow head at (3,2), direction right.\n\nTurn 11: from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2). Cannot L (reverse).\n\n(3,3) is currently occupied by tail? In new positions, tail at (2,3), (3,3) is empty.\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)] so cells occupied: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nU to (3,3): safe.\n\nD to (3,1): safe, y=1>0.\n\nR to (4,2): safe.\n\nSay I move U to (3,3).\n\nNo food, so new positions: head to (3,3), body moves: segment at (2,2) moves to (3,2), segment at (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Current positions [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nMove head to (3,3).\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nThen the first body segment (at (2,2)) moves to previous head position (3,2)\n\nThe second body segment (at (2,3)) moves to previous position of the first body segment, which was (2,2)\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,3), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since no food, it's just moving around.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to go towards the area where high value food was, but it's gone, so no point.\n\nMaybe there is a mistake in the life_span.\n\nLet's read the input again: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 2, 1, 1) - (6, 6, 1, 1) - (2, 1, 2, 1) - (5, 4, 5, 1) - (4, 5, 8, 1)\"\n\nFor (2,1,2,1), it might be that value=2 and life_span=1, or value=1 and life_span=2? But it says \"Value and Life Span\" in the core rules, but in input it's \"Life Span and Value\", but the tuple order might be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)?\n\nAmbiguity.\n\nIn the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" and example \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nBut in the state input, it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" then lists (x,y, value, life_span) for the first two: (2,2,1,1) likely x=2,y=2,value=1,life=1\n\nSimilarly (6,6,1,1)\n\nThen (2,1,2,1) — if same order, x=2,y=1,value=2,life=1\n\n(5,4,5,1) x=5,y=4,value=5,life=1\n\n(4,5,8,1) x=4,y=5,value=8,life=1\n\nBut for (2,1,2,1), value=2, life=1.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or something, but I think we have to go with it.\n\nAnother possibility: in (2,1,2,1), it might be value=1, life_span=2, but the input says \"Life Span and Value\" but lists numbers, so likely the order is value then life_span or life_span then value?\n\nLet's see the first one: \" (2, 2, 1, 1) \" and it's for (2,2), so x=2,y=2, then 1,1 which should be value and life_span.\n\nSimilarly, all have two numbers after, so (x,y, num1, num2) with num1=value, num2=life_span or vice versa?\n\nBut in the core rules, it's \"Value and Life Span\", so likely value first.\n\nIn state input, it says \"Life Span and Value\", but the tuple might be consistent.\n\nFor (2,2,1,1) it's value=1, life_span=1\n\n(6,6,1,1) same\n\n(2,1,2,1) then value=2, life_span=1\n\n(5,4,5,1) value=5, life_span=1\n\n(4,5,8,1) value=8, life_span=1\n\nBut life_span=1 for all, so all disappear after turn 9 if not eaten.\n\nSo only (2,2) can be eaten.\n\nTherefore, for turn 9, move D.\n\nThen for turn 10, from (2,2), I can move, say, R to (3,2) to go right.\n\nThen turn 11, from (3,2), move U to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to provide the answer, I need to list actions for a few turns.\n\nSince the AI must think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n\nBut with no food, it's just moving.\n\nPerhaps I missed that some food has longer life.\n\nLook at (4,5,8,1) — if life_span=1, gone.\n\nBut in the list, all have ,1 at the end, so life_span=1.\n\nUnless for (2,1,2,1), the 2 is life_span.\n\nBut let's assume the order is (x,y, value, life_span) as per core rules example.\n\nSo all life_span=1.\n\nSo for turn 9, move D to eat (2,2).\n\nThen for turn 10, move R to (3,2).\n\nTurn 11, from (3,2), move U to (3,3).\n\nTurn 12, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 10: positions [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)] after moving R from (2,2) with no food.\n\nTurn 11: move U to (3,3), no food.\n\nNew positions: head to (3,3), body at (2,2) moves to (3,2), body at (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Current positions [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nMove head to (3,3).\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nThen the first body segment (at (2,2)) moves to previous head position (3,2)\n\nThe second body segment (at (2,3)) moves to previous position of first body, which was (2,2)\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,3), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nHead at (3,3), direction up (since moved U).\n\nTurn 12: from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\nCannot move down, since reverse of U is D, not allowed.\n\nAllowed: U, L, R.\n\nNow, (3,2) is occupied by body, so moving D to (3,2) would be collision, since (3,2) is body, not tail.\n\nPositions: [ (3,3), (3,2), (2,2) ], so (3,2) is body segment, not tail.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), head touches body, collision, die.\n\nSimilarly, U to (3,4): free, L to (2,3): (2,3) is free? Positions: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), so (2,3) is free.\n\nR to (4,3): free.\n\nSo allowed U, L, R.\n\nSay move R to (4,3).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide 5 turns of actions.\n\nSince turn 9 is critical, move D.\n\nThen for subsequent, it doesn't matter much.\n\nBut to be specific.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (6,4), but far.\n\nSo for turn 9: D\n\nThen turn 10: say R\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: R\n\netc.\n\nBut let's make a plan.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating the food to keep the snake small for maneuverability, but since no other food, I lose the point, so better to eat.\n\nWith length 3, still easy to move.\n\nSo I think move D on turn 9.\n\nThen for the answer format.\n\nThe AI should output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", perhaps for 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nSo turns 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nTurn 9: action\n\nTurn 10: action\n\netc.\n\nFor turn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: from (2,2), move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 11: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 12: from (3,3), move R to (4,3)  # since L to (2,3) or U to (3,4), but R to (4,3) towards center.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), possible moves depending on position.\n\nBut let's not specify too far, since no food.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in turn 12, from (3,3), after moving U to (3,3) on turn 11, positions [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen move R to (4,3), no food.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,3), body at (3,2) moves to (3,3), body at (2,2) moves to (3,2), so [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,3), direction right, so possible moves U, D, R, cannot L.\n\nU to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3), all safe if free.\n\nBut not important.\n\nSo for the answer, I can do:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: R\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: U or something.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps since the high-value food at (4,5) is gone, but I can go there, but no food.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (2,1) has value 2, but life_span=1, gone.\n\nBut what if on turn 9, I move L or U instead of D, then I miss (2,2), and all food disappears, score 0.\n\nThen on turn 10, I am at, say, if I move L to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (2,3)] since no eat, tail removed? Before move: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nMove L to (1,3), no food, so new positions: head (1,3), body moves to (2,3), so [(1,3), (2,3)], tail at (2,3).\n\nThen no food, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (2,4), same thing.\n\nSo only moving D gets me +1.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the only reasonable move for turn 9.\n\nThen for future turns, any safe move.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will prioritize eating the positive food at (2,2) on turn 9, as it is the only food that can be eaten this turn (due to its life_span of 1 and adjacency to the head). All other food has a life_span of 1 and will disappear after this turn if not eaten, but they are not reachable from the current position. After eating, the snake will grow to length 3, and with no food remaining, subsequent moves will focus on safe navigation to avoid collisions and walls.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 9 (Current Turn)**: The snake head is at (2,3) with direction left (L). Only moves U (up), D (down), and L (left) are allowed (no instant reverse to right). Moving D to (2,2) eats the food (+1 score, snake grows to length 3).\n- **Food Life-spans**: All food has life_span=1, so after turn 9, no food remains. Thus, turns 10+ focus on survival.\n- **Snake Growth and Movement**: After eating on turn 9, the snake positions become [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] with head direction down (from the D move). Subsequent moves avoid self-collision and walls.\n- **Grid Constraints**: \n  - Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (6,4).\n  - The grid is 8x8 (coordinates 0-7 for x and y), with (0,0) as bottom-left and y increasing upward (U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1)).\n- **Long-term Survival Strategy**: With no food, the snake must avoid dead ends and stay in open areas. I plan a path moving right and up toward the center (e.g., (4,4)) to maximize space and minimize risk. The snake length is only 3, so maneuvering is easy.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: Actions are planned for turns 9 to 13, ensuring no collisions or wall hits. Beyond turn 13, the snake can continue safely in open areas.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 9-13):\n- **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Move D (down) to (2,2) to eat the food (value +1). New head direction: down.\n- **Turn 10 (t=10)**: Move R (right) to (3,2). This moves away from the left wall and toward the center. No food, so snake moves without growing. New head direction: right.\n- **Turn 11 (t=11)**: Move U (up) to (3,3). Continues toward the center. New head direction: up.\n- **Turn 12 (t=12)**: Move R (right) to (4,3). Avoids the left side and heads to open area. New head direction: right.\n- **Turn 13 (t=13)**: Move U (up) to (4,4). Positions the snake near the center for maximum mobility. New head direction: up.\n\n### Path Visualization:\n- Turn 9 start: Snake at [(2,3), (3,3)]\n- Turn 9 after move: Eat (2,2) → positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n- Turn 10 after move: Move to (3,2) → positions: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)] (tail at (2,3))\n- Turn 11 after move: Move to (3,3) → positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2)] (tail at (2,2))\n- Turn 12 after move: Move to (4,3) → positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2)] (tail at (3,2))\n- Turn 13 after move: Move to (4,4) → positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3)] (tail at (3,3))\n\nThis path is safe, with all moves valid (no wall, obstacle, or self-collision). The snake ends at (4,4) with ample space to continue moving (e.g., to (4,5), (5,4), or (3,4)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 10: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 11: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 12: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 13: U (up)\n}",
