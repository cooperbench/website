        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right with a certain speed. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=0. Since t1=0, T is the number of turns after the start.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. So at turn T, you're only checking for collision on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, even if you're moving there.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=0, and for future turns, they move based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [37, 48] at t=0. And it moves right, so at turn T, span is [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T].\n\n- Freeway 2: one car, head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 6. Direction right, so at t=0, head is -48, tail is -59, so since it's moving right, the span should be [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? Head and tail: for left-moving, head is greater, for right-moving, head is less? I need to be careful with the definition.\n\nFrom the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 1: direction right, so span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48] at t=0, and since right-moving, span(T) = [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: direction right, head -48, tail -59. span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48], so span(T) = [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, I think. It says \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" for both 2 and 3? Let me check.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 6) — same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -59, right, 6) — also same.\n\nAnd freeway 5: (48, 37, right, 12), and (0, -11, right, 12) — two cars.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars: first car (48,37,right,12), second car (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAnd freeway 1 has only one car, freeways 2,3,4 each have one car same as each other.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at t=0. y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So at y=0, no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars there.\n\nThe player needs to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nAt each turn, when the player is on a freeway y (1 to 8), we need to ensure that 0 is not in the car's span for that y at that turn.\n\nSince the player moves at each turn, we need to simulate the path.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9. Since y changes by at most 1 per turn, the minimum possible H is 9, if we go up every turn: from t=0 to t=8, y from 0 to 8, then at t=9, y=9? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTo reach y=9, since we start at y=0, we need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves. But we can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 9.\n\nMinimal H should be 9 if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFirst, let's see if going straight up works.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0. No issue.\n\nAt t=0, we choose action a_0. After action, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0. At turn t=1, we are at y_1, and so on.\n\nThe turn when we are at position: at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row.\n\nWe need to reach a turn where y_T =9.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0, and we want to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe earliest possible T is 9, if we go up every turn: t=0 to t=8: after 8 up moves, at t=8, y=8? Let's index properly.\n\nAt turn t=0: position y=0\n\nChoose action a_0, then at turn t=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=H, we have y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y_0=0, after H actions, y_H = y_0 + sum of Δy from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\ny_H = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + ... + Δy_{H-1}\n\nEach Δy is -1,0, or +1.\n\ny_0=0, y_H=9, so the sum of Δy from t=0 to t=H-1 must be +9.\n\nThe number of up moves minus down moves must be 9, and stays don't change y.\n\nMinimal H is when we have no down or stay, all up, so H=9 actions: from t=0 to t=8, actions a_0 to a_8, then at t=9, y_9 = y_0 + sum_{k=0}^8 Δy_k.\n\nIf all U, Δy_k=1 for k=0 to 8, so y_9 = 0 + 9 =9.\n\nAt turn t=9, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nDuring the path, for t from 1 to 8, we are on y_t = t, since we go up each time.\n\nt from 1 to 8, y from 1 to 8.\n\nWe need no collision at those turns on those freeways.\n\nNow, check for each freeway y=1 to 8 at turn t when y_t = y.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, collision if 0 in car span on that freeway at T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: one car, span at T: [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T] since right-moving, speed 3.\n\nCollision if 0 in [37+3T, 48+3T], so 37+3T <= 0 <= 48+3T.\n\nSince T >=0, 37+3T >0 for all T, so 0 < 37+3T <= left end, so 0 is never in the interval because the interval starts at 37+3T >=37>0. So no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time. Good.\n\nFreeway 2: car span at T: [-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-59+6T, -48+6T], so -59+6T <= 0 <= -48+6T\n\nWhich means 6T <= 48 and 6T >=59? Let's solve:\n\n-59+6T <= 0 => 6T <=59\n\n0 <= -48+6T => 6T >=48\n\nSo 48 <= 6T <=59, so 8 <= T <= 9.833, so T=9 or T=10? 6T >=48, T>=8, 6T <=59, T<=59/6=9.833, so T=9 or T=10? T integer, so T=9 or T=10.\n\n6*8=48, so at T=8, -48+6*8= -48+48=0, so 0 <=0, which is included, so at T=8, 0 is in [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car: (-48,-59,right,6), so collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span at T: since right-moving, span(t1)= [τ,h] = [37,48], so [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [37+12T, 48+12T], but 37+12T >=37>0 for all T>=0, so 0 not in, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span(t1)= [τ,h] = [-11,0], so at T, [ -11 + 12T, 0 + 12T ] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-11+12T, 12T]\n\nThis is true when -11+12T <= 0 <= 12T\n\nWhich is 12T <=11? No:\n\n-11+12T <=0 => 12T <=11\n\n0 <= 12T => T>=0\n\nBut 12T <=11 implies T <= 11/12 <1, so for T=0, 12T=0, -11+0=-11, so [-11,0], 0 is included, so at T=0, collision possible if on freeway 5.\n\nBut at T=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so for T>=1, 12T >=12>0, and -11+12T >= -11+12=1>0 for T>=1, so interval [something positive, positive], 0 not in. So only at T=0, but y=0 not freeway, so no collision for freeway 5 except possibly at T=0, but not applicable.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars, so no collision for T>=1.\n\nFreeway 7: same, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span(t1)= [τ,h] = [-59,-48], so at T, [-59 +12T, -48 +12T]\n\nCollision if 0 in this, so -59+12T <=0 <= -48+12T\n\nSo 12T <=48 and 12T >=59? 0 <= -48+12T => 12T >=48, T>=4\n\n-59+12T <=0 => 12T <=59, T<=59/12≈4.916, so T=4 or T=5? T integer.\n\nT=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at T=4.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, span at T: [-11+12T, 12T]\n\nCollision at T=0 only, not applicable.\n\nSo for freeway 8, collision at T=4.\n\nNow back to straight up path.\n\nIf we go straight up, at turn t, y_t = t for t=0 to 9? At t=0, y=0; t=1, y=1; ... t=8, y=8; t=9, y=9.\n\nWe need to check collision for t=1 to 8.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, freeway 1: as above, no collision possible, good.\n\nt=2, y=2, freeway 2: collision at t=8 and 9, but t=2 not 8 or 9, so for freeway 2, only collision at T=8,9, so at T=2, no collision. Similarly, freeway 3 and 4 same, but at T=2, not 8 or 9, so no collision.\n\nt=3, y=3, freeway 3: no collision at T=3.\n\nt=4, y=4, freeway 4: but freeway 4 has collision only at T=8,9? Freeway 4 same as 2 and 3, collision at T=8,9. At T=4, not 8 or 9, so no collision.\n\nBut freeway 4 is y=4, at T=4.\n\nNow t=5, y=5, freeway 5: no collision, as above.\n\nt=6, y=6, freeway 6: no collision.\n\nt=7, y=7, freeway 7: no collision.\n\nt=8, y=8, freeway 8: collision at T=4, but T=8, not 4. Freeway 8 collision at T=4 only? Earlier: for freeway 8, first car collision at T=4, second car only T=0.\n\nAt T=8, for freeway 8, car 1: [-59+12*8, -48+12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nCar 2: [-11+12*8, 12*8] = [-11+96,96] = [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision at T=8 for freeway 8.\n\nBut for freeway 2,3,4, at T=8, there is collision.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, which is freeway 8, but freeway 8 has no collision at T=8, as above.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 are for y=2,3,4, not y=8.\n\nAt turn t=8, y_t=8, so we are on freeway 8, and we check cars on y=8, which is freeway 8, no collision at T=8.\n\nThe collision for freeway 2 is at T=8, but freeway 2 is y=2, not y=8.\n\nSo at turn t=8, when y=8, we only care about freeway 8, not about freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if we are at y=9, no freeway, goal.\n\nBut in straight up, at t=8, y=8, freeway 8, no collision.\n\nThen at t=9, y=9, goal.\n\nBut we need to check for t=1 to 8.\n\nt=1, y=1: freeway 1, no collision.\n\nt=2, y=2: freeway 2, at T=2, car span: [-59+12, -48+12]? Speed 6, T=2.\n\nFreeway 2: [-59 +6T, -48 +6T], T=2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly t=3, y=3: freeway 3, T=3: [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41, -30], no.\n\nt=4, y=4: freeway 4, T=4: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24], no.\n\nt=5, y=5: freeway 5, no collision as before.\n\nt=6, y=6: freeway 6, no.\n\nt=7, y=7: freeway 7, no.\n\nt=8, y=8: freeway 8, as above, no collision at T=8.\n\nSo straight up seems no collision? But earlier I thought freeway 2,3,4 have collision at T=8, but that is only if we are on that freeway at T=8, which we are not; we are on y=8 at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=8, if we were on y=2, we would collide, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, at T=8, we are on y=8, not on y=2.\n\nSo for straight up path: actions all U from t=0 to t=8, then at t=9, y=9.\n\nt=0 to t=8: 9 actions, H=9 turns? Turns from t=0 to t=8, that's 9 turns, but at turn t=8, we are at y=8, after action a_8=U, y_9=9 at turn t=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, here t1=0, actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, then at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, a_0 to a_8, H=9 actions, at turn t=9, y=9.\n\nAnd no collisions during t=1 to 8.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 2 at T=8: if we were on y=2 at T=8, span is [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included, collision. But we are not on y=2 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, if on y=2, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we are never on y=2 at T=8 or T=9; we are on y=2 at T=2, when no collision.\n\nSo straight up should work with H=9.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and in this case we do.\n\nBut let's see freeway 5,6,7: at T=0, there is a car at span [-11,0], but at T=0, y=0 not freeway, so ok.\n\nIs there any issue?\n\nFreeway 8 at T=4: collision, but at T=4, if we are on y=8, but in straight up, at T=4, we are on y=4, not y=8.\n\nAt T=4, we are on y=4, freeway 4, which at T=4 has span [-35,-24] for freeway 4? Freeway 4 same as 2,3.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 4: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=4, but we are not on it.\n\nSo seems no collision.\n\nBut let's list all:\n\nt (turn) | y_t | freeway | collision?\nt=0: y=0, not freeway, no collision\nt=1: y=1, freeway1: span [37+3,48+3]=[40,51], no 0\nt=2: y=2, freeway2: span [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], no 0\nt=3: y=3, freeway3: same as above, T=3: [-59+18,-48+18]=[-41,-30], no\nt=4: y=4, freeway4: T=4: [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no\nt=5: y=5, freeway5: cars: first [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] no, second [-11+60,60]=[49,60] no, T=5, 12*5=60\nt=6: y=6, freeway6: similar, no\nt=7: y=7, freeway7: no\nt=8: y=8, freeway8: cars: first [-59+96,-48+96]=[37,48] no, second [-11+96,96]=[85,96] no\nt=9: y=9, goal\n\nAll good. So minimal H=9 with all U actions.\n\nBut the car states for freeway 5,6,7 have two cars, but at T=5,6,7, the spans are far from 0.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 at T=0: second car [ -11,0], but we are not on freeway at T=0.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in freeway 5, at T=0, the car is at [ -11,0], which includes 0, but since we are at y=0, not on freeway, it's fine.\n\nIn the path, when we are on y=5 at T=5, it's fine.\n\nSo why do I think there might be a problem? The player starts at (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the straight up path, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 8, first car: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so 0 is included. If we were on y=8 at T=4, we collide, but in straight up, at T=4, we are on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nPerhaps I misread the freeway numbers.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nThe freeway is given as k, and y=k.\n\nIn the car state table, freeway k for y=k.\n\nSo for y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 8 has collision.\n\nBut we are not on it at T=4.\n\nIn the path, we are never on y=8 at T=4; we are on y=8 at T=8, which is fine.\n\nSo straight up should work.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it asks for minimal H and sequence.\n\nH=9, actions all U.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,y_{t1}) with t1=0, y=0.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=9.\n\nBut is there a reason to think it might not work? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7,8, there are cars at (0,-11,right,12), which at T=0 is at [-11,0], including 0.\n\nBut at T=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nIf we were to be on that freeway at T=0, we would collide, but we can't be since we start at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, for movement, when we move to a new y, we are not on it until next turn.\n\nSo for straight up, it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 9, and it works.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can do it faster. Since we have to increase y by 9, and each up move increases by 1, we can't do it in less than 9 actions; we must have at least 9 up moves, and no down moves, so H at least 9, and we achieved 9, so minimal.\n\nWith down or stay, H would be larger, so 9 is minimal.\n\nSo sequence: from t=0 to t=8, action U.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\n...\nTurn 8: U\n\nThen at turn 9, position (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=9, actions at t=0 to t=8.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 8 at T=4.\n\nSuppose at some turn we are on y=8 at T=4, we collide, but in this path, we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 at T=8, if we are on y=2 at T=8, collide, but we are not.\n\nIn fact, for freeway 2, at T=8, it is dangerous, but we are on y=8 at T=8, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps the player can choose to go slower or faster to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nAnother thing: the goal is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 9.\n\nBut let me see the car state for freeway 5,6,7: they have a car at (0,-11,right,12), which at T=0 is at position including 0, but since we are not on freeway, ok.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, the car is moving right, starting at [37,48], moving to higher numbers, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all U is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and in this path, no collisions.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 5 at T=0: car at [ -11,0], but we are at (0,0) at t=0, but y=0 not freeway, so not considered collision.\n\nThe collision is only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nWith H=9.\n\nBut is there a car that might cause issue at some point?\n\nFreeway 8 has a car at T=4 with span including 0, but we are not there.\n\nPerhaps if we delay or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thought: at turn T, when we are on y_T, we need 0 not in span for any car on that row.\n\nIn the case of freeway 5,6,7, at T=0, if we were on it, but we are not.\n\nFor example, suppose we start and stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, moving down is worse.\n\nSo I think all U is best.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2,3,4, at T=8 and 9, if we are on y=2,3,4 at those times, we collide, but we avoid by being on higher y.\n\nBut in straight up, we are not on those at dangerous times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player can reach faster by moving up multiple, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I believe this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions consisting entirely of \"U\" (up) moves. This sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 9 without any collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At each turn \\(T\\) from 1 to 8, the player is on freeway \\(y = T\\).\n- The car spans at each turn \\(T\\) are computed based on the initial state at turn 0 and the car update rules:\n  - **Freeway 1 (y=1):** Car span at \\(T\\) is \\([37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\\). Since \\(37 + 3T \\geq 40 > 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 1\\), 0 is never in the span. No collision.\n  - **Freeway 2 (y=2):** Car span at \\(T\\) is \\([-59 + 6T, -48 + 6T]\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I'm at y=1 at turn t_1 = 1. I need to reach y=9. Each action changes y by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn, I crash. Also, when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1, and they move linearly with time. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left, for right-moving, it shifts right. All cars here are right-moving except... let me check.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (51,40, right, 3) — head 51, tail 40, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, at turn t_1, span is [τ, h] = [40,51]? The notation says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and then at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (51,40, right, 3). Since direction is right, head is larger, so τ=40, h=51, so Span(t_1) = [40,51]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-42,-53, right, 6). -42 and -53, with right direction. If right, head should be larger than tail? -42 > -53, yes, so τ=-53, h=-42, Span(t_1) = [-53,-42]? But let's see the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, with τ ≤ h.\n\nHere, for freeway 2: h=-42, τ=-53, since -42 > -53, so τ=-53, h=-42, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53,-42]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 same as 2? Freeway 3: (-42,-53, right,6) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: (60,49, right,12), and (12,1, right,12). So two cars on freeway 5.\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, right, speed 12, so Span(t_1) = [49,60]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, right, speed 12, Span(t_1) = [1,12]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47, right,12) and (12,1, right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47? Since right, τ=-47, h=-36, Span(t_1) = [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, Span(t_1) = [1,12]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on y_T, 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) depends on T.\n\nt_1 = 1, so for a future turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, as per the table.\n\nIn freeway 8, first car is left? Direction is right, so all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47, right,12), so since right, and head=-36, tail=-47, it's moving right, so positions increasing.\n\nSimilarly, all cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9, so I need to move up 8 units. But I can move down or stay, but since I start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, moving down might not help, but I have to avoid cars, so sometimes I might need to stay or move down to wait.\n\nBut since time is minimal, probably I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, so to go from 1 to 9, minimum moves would be 8 Up actions, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I take H actions to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nStart at turn t_1 =1, position y=1.\n\nAfter first action at turn 1, I move to new position at turn 2, and so on.\n\nLet’s denote the turn when I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check if for that freeway, at turn t, 0 is in any car's span on that freeway.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nIf I am not on that freeway at that turn, no collision for that freeway.\n\nNow, for freeway y_t, at turn t, I need that no car on y_t has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to compute for each freeway and each time whether 0 is covered.\n\nBut I need to do this for the times when I am on that freeway.\n\nSince I control my y position, I need to choose when to be on which row to avoid the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find all times t such that for some car on k, 0 in Span(t).\n\nt is turn number, starting from t_1=1.\n\nFor a car with given τ, h, s, right-moving, Span(t) = [τ + s(t-1), h + s(t-1)] for t ≥ 1.\n\nThen 0 in [τ + s(t-1), h + s(t-1)] if τ + s(t-1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(t-1)\n\nSince τ ≤ h, this is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s(t-1) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s(t-1)\n\nWhich is:\n\ns(t-1) ≤ -τ and s(t-1) ≥ -h\n\nFrom τ + s(t-1) ≤ 0, so s(t-1) ≤ -τ\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s(t-1), so s(t-1) ≥ -h\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for t.\n\nLet u = t-1, so u is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nt-1 is time elapsed since turn 1.\n\nSo for a car, 0 in Span(t) iff:\n\n- h - s u ≤ 0? Let's see.\n\ns u ≥ -h  (since s(t-1) ≥ -h)\n\nAnd s u ≤ -τ  (since s(t-1) ≤ -τ)\n\nu = t-1\n\nSo s u ≤ -τ and s u ≥ -h\n\nSince τ and h could be negative, let's keep it.\n\nAlso, since the span is [τ + s u, h + s u], and 0 is in it if min(τ + s u, h + s u) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s u, h + s u), but since right-moving and τ ≤ h, min is τ + s u, max is h + s u, so τ + s u ≤ 0 ≤ h + s u.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each car, the times u when it covers 0 are when:\n\nτ + s u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s u\n\nWhich is:\n\ns u ≤ -τ and s u ≥ -h\n\nSo u ≥ ceil( -h / s ) and u ≤ floor( -τ / s )? Let's see inequalities.\n\ns u ≥ -h  ⇒ u ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\ns u ≤ -τ  ⇒ u ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nSince u must be integer, t integer.\n\nu = t-1, integer.\n\nNow, for multiple cars on a freeway, 0 is covered at time t if any car covers it.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the set of u where 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: one car, τ=40, h=51, s=3, right.\n\nSo u must satisfy:\n\ns u ≥ -h = -51\n\ns u ≤ -τ = -40\n\ns=3\n\nSo 3u ≥ -51 ⇒ u ≥ ceil(-51/3) = ceil(-17) = -17? But u = t-1 ≥ 0 since t≥1, t_1=1, u≥0.\n\nt starts from 1, u from 0.\n\nSo 3u ≥ -51, since -51 negative, and u≥0, 3u≥0 > -51, so always true for u≥0.\n\nSimilarly, 3u ≤ -40? 3u ≤ -40, but u≥0, 3u≥0, -40<0, so 3u ≤ -40 is impossible.\n\nThus, for freeway 1, no u satisfies the condition, so 0 is never covered by this car for t≥1.\n\nIndeed, at u=0, span [40,51], 0 not in.\n\nAs time increases, span moves right, to higher numbers, so 0 never covered.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe? But I need to confirm.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: one car, τ=-53, h=-42, s=6, right.\n\nSpan(t) = [τ + s(u), h + s(u)] = [-53 + 6u, -42 + 6u]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6u ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6u\n\nSo -53 + 6u ≤ 0 ⇒ 6u ≤ 53 ⇒ u ≤ 53/6 = 8.833, so u ≤ floor(8.833) = 8? u ≤ floor(53/6) but 53/6=8.833, floor is 8, but inequality.\n\n-53 + 6u ≤ 0 ⇒ 6u ≤ 53 ⇒ u ≤ floor(53/6) = 8? 53/6 = 8 + 5/6, so u ≤ 8 since u integer? 6*8=48 ≤53, 6*9=54>53, so 6u ≤53 for u≤8? 6*8=48≤53, yes; u=9, 54>53, not ≤53.\n\nBut inequality is 6u ≤53, so for u≤8, 48≤53, true; u=9,54>53 false.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -42 + 6u ⇒ 42 ≤ 6u ⇒ u ≥ ceil(42/6) = ceil(7) =7\n\nSo u ≥7 and u ≤8? u≥7 and u≤8.\n\nu≥ ceil(42/6)=7, and u≤ floor(53/6)= floor(8.833)=8\n\nSo u=7 or 8\n\nNow u=t-1, so for t=8 or t=9\n\nu=7, t=8; u=8, t=9\n\nAt t=8, span: u=7, τ + s u = -53 + 6*7 = -53 +42 = -11, h + s u = -42 +42=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nAt t=9, u=8, τ + s u = -53 + 48 = -5, h + s u = -42 +48=6, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, freeway 2 has car covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car: (-42,-53,right,6), so same, covered at t=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, covered at t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=49, h=60, s=12, right.\n\nSpan(t) = [49 + 12u, 60 + 12u]\n\n0 in span? 49 +12u ≤0 ≤60+12u\n\n49+12u ≤0 ⇒ 12u ≤ -49, u≤ floor(-49/12) = floor(-4.083) = -5? But u≥0, 12u≥0, -49<0, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, 0≤60+12u always true for u≥0.\n\nSo first car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nSpan(t) = [1 + 12u, 12 + 12u]\n\n0 in span? 1+12u ≤0 ≤12+12u\n\n1+12u ≤0 ⇒ 12u ≤ -1, u≤ -1/12, impossible for u≥0.\n\n0≤12+12u always true.\n\nSo no coverage for freeway 5. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, right. Span(t) = [-47 + 12u, -36 + 12u]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12u ≤0 ≤ -36 +12u\n\nSo -47 +12u ≤0 ⇒ 12u ≤47 ⇒ u ≤ floor(47/12) = floor(3.916) =3\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -36 +12u ⇒ 36 ≤12u ⇒ u ≥ ceil(36/12)=3\n\nSo u≥3 and u≤3, so u=3.\n\nThus at u=3, t=4 (since u=t-1, t=u+1=4)\n\nAt t=4, span: -47+12*3= -47+36=-11, -36+36=0, so [ -11,0], includes 0.\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12, s=12, same as before, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 8 covered at t=4 only.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: never\n\n- Freeway 2: t=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: t=8,9\n\n- Freeway 4: t=8,9\n\n- Freeway 5: never\n\n- Freeway 6: never\n\n- Freeway 7: never\n\n- Freeway 8: t=4\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at turn t=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, and I need to be on each row at some point, but I can skip rows or stay, but since I need to go up, I will go through each row.\n\nI start at y=1, need to end at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car there.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor row y=1: dangerous at t=8,9? But row y=1 is freeway 1, which is never dangerous, so always safe.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, dangerous at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, dangerous at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, dangerous at t=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, always safe\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, always safe\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, always safe\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, dangerous at t=4\n\nI need to go from y=1 to y=9, so I need to pass through y=2 to y=8, but I can move directly or stay, but since time is minimal, I should move up as much as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a row when it is dangerous.\n\nFor example, I should not be on y=8 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=2,3,4 at t=8 or 9.\n\nNow, since I start at t=1, y=1.\n\nI can take actions to move up.\n\nLet me denote the sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I must not have collision on freeway y_t.\n\nSince y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nStart: t=1, y_1 =1\n\nI choose a_1, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nMinimal t.\n\nSince I need to increase y by 8, if no cars, I could do 8 U actions, from t=1 to t=9, with y_t = t for t=1 to 9?

Freeway 8 dangerous only at t=4, not t=8, so at t=8, should be safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 is dangerous at t=4, but at t=8, it is not dangerous, since only t=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4 dangerous at t=8,9, but at t=2,3,4, not t=8,9, so should be fine.\n\nt=9, y=9, not a freeway, no car, safe.\n\nSo in this sequence, all seems safe, and I reach at t=9.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nAt t=4, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4, dangerous at t=8,9, not t=4, so safe.\n\nAt t=8, I am on y=8, freeway 8 dangerous only at t=4, not t=8, so safe.\n\ny=2 at t=2, safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 2 dangerous at t=8,9, but at t=2, it is not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this case, with all U, I reach at t=9 without any collision.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so in this case, from t=1 to t=9, I take 8 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart turn t=1, after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn t_1 =1, I take actions at turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1, so after H actions, I have done H steps, and I am at position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1? I think I'm confusing.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen I choose action a_t.\n\nThen I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and at turn t, while I am on y_t, I check collision for freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThen at the beginning of turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nI start at turn t=1, y_1=1.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, I go to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nI reach y=9 when for some t, y_t =9.\n\nIn the sequence, if I set a_t = U for t=1 to 8, then:\n\nt=1: y1=1, action U, so y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, action U, y3=3\n\n...\n\nt=8: y8=8, action U, y9=9\n\nt=9: y9=9, and since y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nNow, during the turns:\n\nAt turn t=1: on y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nt=2: on y=2, freeway 2, at time t=2, not dangerous (dangerous at t=8,9), safe.\n\nt=3: on y=3, freeway 3, safe at t=3.\n\nt=4: on y=4, freeway 4, safe at t=4.\n\nt=5: on y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nt=6: on y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=7: on y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=8: on y=8, freeway 8, at time t=8. Freeway 8 dangerous only at t=4, not t=8, so safe.\n\nt=9: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good, and I reach at turn 9 with 8 actions? Actions from t=1 to t=8, that's 8 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions taken.\n\nIn the sequence, I take actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, and I need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn my sequence, t_1=1, I take actions at t=1 to t=8 (H=8 actions), and at turn 8, after action, I go to y9=9 at turn 9? No.\n\nAt turn t, after action, I go to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, that means y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, if I want y_T=9 for some T.\n\nWith all U from start:\n\nAt turn 1: y1=1\n\nAfter a1=U, at turn 2: y2=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a8=U, at turn 9: y9=9\n\nSo at turn 9, y9=9.\n\nThus, I reach at turn 9 with actions from t=1 to t=8.\n\nH=8 actions, reaching at turn t_1 + H -1? t_1=1, H=8, t_1 + H -1 =1+8-1=8, but at turn 8, y8=8, not 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I misindexed.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- At turn t, position is y_t.\n\n- I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n- Collision check at turn t for freeway y_t.\n\n- I start at turn t_1=1, y_1=1\n\n- I need to have y_T =9 for some T, and minimize T - t_1 +1 or something.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, I am at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThat is, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd I take actions from time t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I take actions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, I go to position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter I choose action a_{t_1 + H -1}, I go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut for the position to be (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, it means that before taking action at that turn, I am already at (0,9), and I may take an action, but since I need to reach it, probably I stop when I reach.\n\nThe sequence is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with all U, start at t=1, y1=1.\n\nAction a1 at t=1: U, go to y2=2 at t=2.\n\nAction a2 at t=2: U, go to y3=3 at t=3.\n\n...\n\nAction a8 at t=8: U, go to y9=9 at t=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, y9=9.\n\nThus, to have y_T=9 at turn T, with T=9, so t_1 + H -1 =9, t_1=1, so 1 + H -1 =9, thus H=9.\n\nActions at t=1 to t=9? But at t=9, if y9=9, I don't need to take action, but the sequence includes actions up to when I reach.\n\nIn this case, I take actions at t=1 to t=8 to go from y1=1 to y9=9 in 8 steps, but I reach at turn 9.\n\nThe turn when I am at (0,9) is turn 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, which is 8 for reaching from 1 to 9.\n\nBut according to the index, t_1 + H -1 = turn when position is (0,9).\n\nSo for T=9, 1 + H -1 =9, so H=9.\n\nAnd actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so t=1 to t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am at y9=9, I may not need to take action, but the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which for H=9, a9 at t=9.\n\nBut if I am at y9=9, and I take action, I might move, but since I need to reach, probably I can take S or something, but to minimize H, I should not take extra actions.\n\nIn the all U sequence, with 8 actions (t=1 to 8), I reach at t=9.\n\nSo to have y_T=9 at T=9, with H=9 actions? But I only need 8 actions to move from 1 to 9.\n\nThe minimal H to reach from y=1 to y=9 is at least 8, since I need 8 net up moves.\n\nIf I take S or D, it takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 8, with all U, reaching at turn 9.\n\nAnd in this case, as above, no collision, so it should be fine.\n\nBut in my earlier, at t=8, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, and it is safe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, all other times safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFreeway 2 dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on y=2, it would be dangerous, but in the sequence, at t=8, I am on y=8, not y=2.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nAt t=9, if I were on y=2, dangerous, but at t=9, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 dangerous at t=4, but at t=4, I am on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and in this case it works with H=8, actions U from t=1 to t=8.\n\nBut H=8, actions at t=1 to t=8, reaching at turn 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =1+8-1=8, but at turn 8, y8=8, not 9. Mistake.\n\nI think I have a indexing problem.\n\nLet's read the task carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times: t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nThat is, actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H should be (0,9)? No.\n\nWhen I take action at time τ, it determines the position at time τ+1.\n\nSo after taking action at time t, I am at position at time t+1.\n\nThe position at time t is determined before taking action at time t.\n\nStandard:\n\n- At time t, position y_t\n\n- Choose a_t\n\n- Move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n- Collision checked at time t for freeway y_t\n\nI start at time t_1=1, y_1=1\n\nI need to have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThen the turn when I reach is T.\n\nThe number of actions taken to reach from t_1 to T-1, since from t_1 to T-1, I take actions to go from y_{t_1} to y_T.\n\nSpecifically, from y_1 to y_T, I take actions at t=1 to t=T-1, that's T-1 actions.\n\nThen at time T, I am at y_T=9.\n\nIn terms of H, the minimal number of turns (actions) such that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThat is, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I want y_T=9 at time T, then t_1 + H -1 = T, so H = T - t_1 +1\n\nNumber of actions is H, from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1.\n\nActions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, I go to position at time (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut I need position at time t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9), so before taking action at that time, I am at (0,9).\n\nSo for time S = t_1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\nAnd I take actions from t_1 to S, which is from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, number of actions: from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, start t_1=1, y1=1.\n\nIf I want to reach at time S=9, y9=9, then H such that t_1 + H -1 =9, 1 + H -1=9, H=9.\n\nActions at t=1 to t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if y9=9, I take action a9, but it might move me away, but since I need to reach at that turn, I can take S or something.\n\nIn the all U case, to reach y9=9, I take actions at t=1 to t=8: all U, which set y2=2, y3=3, ..., y9=9.\n\nThen at t=9, y9=9, I need to include a9, which I can set to S, for example, to stay.\n\nThen H=9, actions at t=1 to t=9: a1 to a8 U, a9 S.\n\nBut at t=9, I am on y9=9, no freeway, no collision issue.\n\nSimilarly, I could reach earlier? From y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 up moves, so minimum reach at turn 9 with 8 actions, but with H=9 including the last action.\n\nSince I need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, for H=8, t_1 + H -1=1+8-1=8, so I need y8=9.\n\nBut to have y8=9 from y1=1, I need to increase by 8 in 7 steps? From turn 1 to turn 8, that's 7 actions? Let's see.\n\ny1=1 at turn 1.\n\nAfter action a1 at turn 1, y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nAt turn 2, y2.\n\nAfter a2 at turn 2, y3.\n\n...\n\nAfter a7 at turn 7, y8.\n\nTo have y8=9, with y1=1, I need to increase by 8 in 7 steps: from y2 to y8, 7 positions, but y2 to y8 is 6 steps? Positions at turn 2 to turn 8, that's 7 positions, but changes between.\n\nFrom turn 1 to turn 8, there are 7 actions (t=1 to t=7), determining y2 to y8.\n\ny1 is given, fixed.\n\nTo change from y1 to y8, I have actions at t=1 to t=7, setting y2 to y8.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so |y8 - y1| <= 7, so y8 <= 1+7=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y8=9 from y1=1 with actions up to t=7.\n\nMax y8=8 with all U.\n\nSimilarly, min y8=1 with all S or D, but y>=0.\n\nSo to reach y=9, earliest possible is turn 9, with y9=9.\n\nThus minimal T=9, with H=9 actions: actions from t=1 to t=9, with a1 to a8 U, and a9 S or U, but if a9 U, y10=10>9, not allowed, y must be in 0-9, so a9 must be S or D, but to stay at 9, a9=S.\n\nSimilarly, with all U from t=1 to t=8, y9=9, then a9=S.\n\nNow, back to the car avoidance.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nActions: a1=U, a2=U, ..., a8=U, a9=S\n\nPositions:\n\nTurn t=1: y1=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nAction a1=U, go to y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, freeway 2, at time t=2, not dangerous (dangerous at t=8,9), safe\n\nAction a2=U, go to y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3, freeway 3, safe at t=3\n\nAction a3=U, go to y4=4\n\nt=4: y4=4, freeway 4, at time t=4, not dangerous (dangerous at t=8,9), safe\n\nAction a4=U, go to y5=5\n\nt=5: y5=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nAction a5=U, go to y6=6\n\nt=6: y6=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nAction a6=U, go to y7=7\n\nt=7: y7=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nAction a7=U, go to y8=8\n\nt=8: y8=8, freeway 8, at time t=8. Freeway 8 dangerous only at t=4, not t=8, so safe.\n\nAction a8=U, go to y9=9\n\nt=9: y9=9, not freeway, safe. Action a9=S, go to y10=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn this, at no point was I on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 2 dangerous at t=8,9, but at t=8 I am on y=8, not y=2; at t=9 on y=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 dangerous at t=4, but at t=4 I am on y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster? No, because minimum 8 up moves needed, so turn 9 is earliest.\n\nPerhaps I can reach with fewer actions if I start lower, but I start at y=1, need to go to 9.\n\ny starts at 1, ends at 9, difference 8, each U increases by 1, so min 8 U actions needed, and since each action takes one turn, min H=8 actions to move, but with H actions, I reach at turn t_1 + H, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before the last action.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with H min.\n\nSince y1=1, to have y_S=9 for S= t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith S=9, H=9 as above.\n\nIf I can have y8=9, but as above, impossible because from y1=1, after 7 actions (t=1 to7), y8 <=8.\n\nSo S=9 is min.\n\nThus with H=9, it works.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 8 has a car at t=4, but I am not on it then.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used all U, but perhaps I need to avoid something, but in this case no.\n\nThe problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=8.\n\nIf H=8, then t_1 + H -1 =1+8-1=8, so need y8=9.\n\nBut y1=1, to y8=9, impossible as |Δy|<=1 per action, max increase 7 in 7 actions.\n\nSpecifically, y8 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to7} Δy_t <= 1 + 7*1 =8 <9.\n\nSo cannot reach y8=9.\n\nThus min H=9.\n\nAnd sequence as above.\n\nBut in the answer, for t_1=1.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S  (to stay at 9)\n\nBut since at turn 9, y9=9, and I need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =9, which is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=1 to t=9.\n\nBut in the collision, at turn 9, I am on y=9, no car, so action S is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can do without a9, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nNow, but in the car on freeway 5,6,7, there are cars, but they never cover 0, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 5 has two cars, but as computed, never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the initial state, freeway 5: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), both not covering 0 at any time.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=4, dangerous, but I not on it.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=4, I am on y=4, freeway 4, which is dangerous only at t=8,9, not t=4, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 4 dangerous at t=8,9, but at t=4, not.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are dangerous for y=2,3,4.\n\nBut in sequence, at t=8, I am on y=8, which is safe, and at t=9, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=4 with freeway 8? No, because I not on it.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but cannot.\n\nMaybe I can stay or move down to avoid future collision, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at t=9, freeway 2 is dangerous, but I not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times again.\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, if I were on y=2, crash, but I on y=8.\n\nAt t=9, on y=9.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at t=4 only, not at t=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at t=4, it is dangerous, but since I not on it, no problem.\n\nIn the sequence, I think it works.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nSequence: actions U from turn 1 to 8, and S at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, I can do anything, but to stay, S.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and in this, I did.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 1? Freeway 1 has a car but never covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1: (51,40,right,3), which as computed, not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at t=4.\n\nFreeway 8: first car τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nAt t=4, u=t-1=3, Span = [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nSecond car not covering.\n\nSo yes, dangerous at t=4.\n\nBut not at other times.\n\nIn sequence, I not on it at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it is correct.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1), which is on freeway 1, at turn 1.\n\nIn the sequence, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach with H=9 but different actions, but minimal H is fixed.\n\nOr maybe I can go slower to avoid something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother point: at turn 1, I am on y=1, and I take action.\n\nIn the sequence above, I move immediately.\n\nBut suppose at some point I stay, it would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut the initial position is (0, y_{t_1}) with t_1=1, y=1.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 2,3,4 all have the same car? Freeway 2: (-42,-53,right,6), similarly freeway 3 and 4 same, but different freeways, so each has its own car.\n\nBut in terms of coverage, same dangerous times.\n\nBut in the sequence, it doesn't affect.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9, with actions as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut at turn 9, I could do D, but y would decrease to 8, then I need to go up again, worse, so S is fine.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to specify action at turn 9, but since H=9, I need to include it.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nWith t_1=1, H=9, actions at t=1 to 9.\n\na9 must be such that y10 is still 9 or something, but since we reach at turn 9, it doesn't matter, but to be safe, S.\n\nIn the collision, at turn 9, I am on y=9, no collision, so action doesn't affect the position for that turn.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with H=9 but reach earlier, but cannot.\n\nAnother idea: start with S at turn 1, but then y2=1, then I need to go up, but it takes more turns to reach, worse.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be as above.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 5,6,7 have two cars each, but as per computation, no danger.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nAt any t, first car [49+12u, 60+12u], min 49>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [1+12u,12+12u], min 1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=4, first car covers 0, second not.\n\nBut not an issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions specified below.\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: The car (head=51, tail=40, direction=right, speed=3) never covers x=0 at any turn, so this row is always safe.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: The car (head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=6) covers x=0 at turns 8 and 9.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: The car (head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=6) covers x=0 at turns 8 and 9 (same as Freeway 2).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: The car (head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=6) covers x=0 at turns 8 and 9 (same as Freeway 2).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: The cars (head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=12) and (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12) never cover x=0, so this row is always safe.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: The cars (head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=12) and (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12) never cover x=0 (same as Freeway 5), so always safe.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: The cars (head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=12) and (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12) never cover x=0 (same as Freeway 5), so always safe.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: The car (head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=12) covers x=0 at turn 4. The other car (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12) never covers x=0.\n\n### Strategy\n- The player starts at (0, 1) at turn 1 and must reach (0, 9) as quickly as possible.\n- The minimum increase in y-position required is 8 (from 1 to 9), which requires at least 8 \"U\" (up) actions.\n- Due to the turn-based movement, the earliest possible turn to reach y=9 is turn 9 (since y=1 at turn 1, and each \"U\" action increases y by 1 per turn, reaching y=9 at turn 9 after 8 \"U\" actions).\n- The sequence of 8 \"U\" actions from turn 1 to turn 8, followed by an \"S\" (stay) action at turn 9 to remain at y=9, avoids all car hazards:\n  - At turn 4, the player is on y=4 (Freeway 4), which is only hazardous at turns 8 and 9, so safe at turn 4.\n  - At turn 8, the player is on y=8 (Freeway 8), which is only hazardous at turn 4, so safe at turn 8.\n  - At turns 8 and 9, Freeways 2, 3, and 4 are hazardous, but the player is on y=8 at turn 8 and y=9 (not a freeway) at turn 9, avoiding collision.\n- No delays (e.g., \"S\" or \"D\" actions) are needed, as the direct upward path is hazard-free at the relevant times.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 1 (t=1)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=2 at turn 2. Collision check at turn 1 (y=1): safe.\n- **Turn 2 (t=2)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=3 at turn 3. Collision check at turn 2 (y=2): not hazardous (hazard at t=8,9), safe.\n- **Turn 3 (t=3)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=4 at turn 4. Collision check at turn 3 (y=3): not hazardous (hazard at t=8,9), safe.\n- **Turn 4 (t=4)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=5 at turn 5. Collision check at turn 4 (y=4): not hazardous (hazard at t=8,9), safe.\n- **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=6 at turn 6. Collision check at turn 5 (y=5): safe (no hazards).\n- **Turn 6 (t=6)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=7 at turn 7. Collision check at turn 6 (y=6): safe (no hazards).\n- **Turn 7 (t=7)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=8 at turn 8. Collision check at turn 7 (y=7): safe (no hazards).\n- **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Action \"U\" – Move to y=9 at turn 9. Collision check at turn 8 (y=8): not hazardous (hazard only at t=4), safe.\n- **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Action \"S\" – Remain at y=9. Collision check at turn 9 (y=9): no freeway, safe.\n\nThis sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 9 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 1 + 9 - 1 = 9\\)) with \\(H = 9\\) turns (actions), which is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 2, and I'm given the car states at turn 2.\n\nThe player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So from y=2, I need to get to y=9, which is 7 units up, so minimum moves would be 7 if I could go straight up with no cars, but there are cars on the freeways, so I might need to wait or detour.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, when the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T. The span changes over time based on speed and direction.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. Collision is checked based on where you are at each turn.\n\nSpecifically: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at each turn, you're on a specific row, and collision depends on cars on that row at that exact turn.\n\nI need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t_1 = 2.\n\nFor each freeway k (which is y=k, I think), and for each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. From the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\nRight-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the span notation:\n\nFor left-moving: at time t, span is [h, τ], and at time T, it's [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t), τ - s (T-t)]\"\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is the head, τ is tail? But for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the left, I think.\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret the span.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t), h + s (T-t)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at time t, span is [τ, h], which might mean τ is left end, h is right end? I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify the span notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving car: at time t, span is [h, τ], and it moves left, so at time T, it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: at time t, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so at time T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it's [h, τ], which might imply h is the front, τ is back, but for left-moving, front is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right, [τ, h] might have τ as the left end, h as right end.\n\nIn collision condition, we care about whether 0 is in the span.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at (0, y), so we care about x=0.\n\nSo for a car on freeway y at time T, if 0 is between the left and right ends of the car at that time, collision.\n\nFor left-moving car, span [a,b] where a = h - sΔT, b = τ - sΔT, and since it's moving left, a > b? No.\n\nIn the initial, for left-moving, Span(t) = [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h should be greater than τ if it's decreasing.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (54,43, right, 3) but direction is right? Let's list all cars.\n\nFreeway k:\n\nk=1: one car: (54,43, right, 3)\n\nBut direction is right, so it should be right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t is [τ, h]? From the description.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor k=1: (54,43, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h]? I need to see the span definition.\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for a car, head and tail define the ends.\n\nFor direction, it tells which way it's moving.\n\nFor collision, we need the span at time T to contain 0.\n\nAlso, the span is a interval, and for it to contain 0, the min and max must include 0.\n\nLet's define the left end and right end at each time.\n\nFor a right-moving car: at time t, span [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since it's moving right, τ is left, h is right.\n\nThen at time T, left end = τ + s(T-t), right end = h + s(T-t)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: at time t, span [h, τ] with h > τ, I think, since moving left, h is right end? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and since it's moving left, the head (front) is decreasing, so h is the front, which is larger number, τ is back, smaller number.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: car (54,43, right, 3). Direction right, so right-moving.\n\nAt time t=2, span is [τ, h] = [43, 54]? But in the notation, it says (head, tail) = (54,43), but for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ is tail, which is left end, h is head, right end.\n\nSo at t=2, for this car, left end = 43, right end = 54, since moving right.\n\nThen at time T, left end = 43 + 3*(T-2), right end = 54 + 3*(T-2)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is between left end and right end inclusive.\n\nAlso, for multiple cars on same freeway, need to check all.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars at t=2.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, left=43, right=54 at t=2, speed 3.\n\nSo position at T: left = 43 + 3(T-2), right = 54 + 3(T-2)\n\nFreeway 2: car (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so at t=2, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? head= -36, tail= -47, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = -36, so left end = -47, right end = -36.\n\nMoving right, so at T: left = -47 + 6(T-2), right = -36 + 6(T-2)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-36,-47,right,6), so identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: first (-48,-59,right,12), second (24,13,right,12)\n\nFor first car: right-moving, head=-48? head and tail: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nτ = tail = -59, h = head = -48? But head should be the front.\n\nFor right-moving, front is head, which is larger number if moving right? -48 > -59, yes.\n\nAt t=2, left end = τ = -59, right end = h = -48\n\nThen at T: left = -59 + 12(T-2), right = -48 + 12(T-2)\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), so at t=2, left = τ =13, right = h=24\n\nAt T: left =13 +12(T-2), right=24+12(T-2)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12), at t=2, left= τ= -35, right= h= -24\n\nAt T: left= -35 +12(T-2), right= -24 +12(T-2)\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), same as before, left=13, right=24 at t=2, at T: 13+12(T-2), 24+12(T-2)\n\nNow, player starts at turn 2, position y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny must be integer, from 0 to 9.\n\nPlayer can move up, down, or stay.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway when 0 is occupied by a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars there, so safe, but player starts at y=2, which is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer at (0,2), so at turn 2, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nIs there a car on freeway 2 at turn 2 that has 0 in span?\n\nFreeway 2: car with left=-47, right=-36 at t=2.\n\n0 is not between -47 and -36, since -36 < 0? -36 is negative, -47 more negative, so span [-47,-36], which is all negative, 0 is not in, so safe at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but at turn 2, player is on y=2, so only check freeway 2.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I need to go up, and cars might block, I should go up as fast as possible, but I might need to wait if unsafe.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 7, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps up.\n\nBut I might need to stay or move down to avoid, but moving down might not help since I need to go up, and y=0 is safe, but going down to 0 or 1 might waste time.\n\ny=0 is safe, but I need to reach y=9, so going down is counterproductive, but I might do it to avoid a collision if stuck, but in this case, since I can stay, staying might be better than moving down.\n\nBut let's first see if I can go straight up with no waiting.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=2.\n\nAction at turn 2: if I go up, then at turn 3, y=3.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn when I am on a freeway.\n\nTurn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to set y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, collision depends on y_T and cars on that row at turn T.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, y=2, freeway 2, car span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, suppose I go up at turn 2: action U, so at turn 3, y=3.\n\nAt turn 3, on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has car, same as freeway 2: at t=2, left=-47, right=-36, speed 6, so at T=3, ΔT=1, left = -47 +6(1) = -41, right = -36 +6(1) = -30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen turn 3, action U, to y=4 at turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: same car, at T=4, ΔT=2, left = -47 +6(2) = -47+12= -35, right= -36+12= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 4, action U, to y=5 at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: at t=2, left= -59 (for the (-48,-59) car, left=τ=-59), right=h=-48\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=3, left = -59 +12*3 = -59 + 36 = -23, right = -48 + 36 = -12, span [-23,-12]\n\nSecond car: at t=2, left=13, right=24, at T=5, left=13+12*3=13+36=49, right=24+36=60, span [49,60]\n\n0 not in either span, so safe.\n\nTurn 5, action U, to y=6 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, cars: first car at T=6, ΔT=4, left= -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, right= -48+48=0\n\nright=0, so span [-11,0], which includes 0. So at turn 6, on freeway 6, car has span ending at 0, so 0 is in span, collision!\n\nOh, so if I go to y=6 at turn 6, I collide.\n\nAt turn 6, y=6, and car on freeway 6 has right end at 0, so 0 is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for first car, right end = -48 + 12*(6-2) = -48 + 12*4 = -48+48=0, and left end = -59+48= -11, so [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nSo collision at turn 6 if I am on y=6.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 5, I am on y=5, action U to go to y=6 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, I am on y=6, so collision.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to y=6 at turn 6.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down at some point to change timing.\n\nMaybe go slower or faster.\n\nSince the car moves, at different times, the position changes.\n\nLet me find when each freeway is unsafe.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, determine if it is safe or not, i.e., no car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars, if any car has 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, right-moving, at t=2, left=43, right=54, speed 3.\n\nPosition at T: left = 43 + 3(T-2), right = 54 + 3(T-2)\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, so 43 + 3(T-2) <= 0 <= 54 + 3(T-2)\n\nBut since left and right increasing, and at T=2, left=43>0, so always left >0 for T>=2, so 0 never in span for freeway 1. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car at t=2, left=-47, right=-36, speed 6.\n\nAt T, left = -47 + 6(T-2), right = -36 + 6(T-2)\n\n0 in span if -47 +6(T-2) <= 0 <= -36 +6(T-2)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +6(ΔT) <= 0 => 6(ΔT) <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so ΔT <= 7 since integer? ΔT = T-2, integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 +6(ΔT) => 6(ΔT) >= 36 => ΔT >= 6\n\nSo for ΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7, 0 in span.\n\nΔT=6: left = -47 +36 = -11, right= -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=7: left= -47+42= -5, right= -36+42=6, so [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nΔT=8: left= -47+48=1, right= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for T such that ΔT=6 or 7, i.e., T=8 or 9.\n\nT=2 + ΔT, so for T=8 and T=9, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, at t=2, left= -59, right= -48, speed 12.\n\nAt T, left = -59 +12(ΔT), right = -48 +12(ΔT)\n\n0 in span if -59 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT=4, 0 in span.\n\nΔT=4: left= -59 +48= -11, right= -48+48=0, [-11,0]\n\nΔT=3: left= -59+36= -23, right= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=5: left= -59+60=1, right= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=4, T=6.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: at t=2, left=13, right=24, speed 12.\n\nAt T, left=13+12ΔT, right=24+12ΔT, both >0 for ΔT>=0, so always positive, 0 never in span. Safe always.\n\nThus for freeway 5, unsafe only at T=6 (from first car).\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars identical, so unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, unsafe at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) at t=2, left= -35, right= -24\n\nAt T, left= -35 +12ΔT, right= -24 +12ΔT\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT=2, 0 in span.\n\nΔT=2: left= -35+24= -11, right= -24+24=0, [-11,0]\n\nΔT=1: left= -35+12= -23, right= -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=3: left= -35+36=1, right= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe only at T=4 (since ΔT=2, T=4)\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), at t=2, left=13, right=24, at T left=13+12ΔT, right=24+12ΔT, always >0, safe always.\n\nThus for freeway 8, unsafe only at T=4.\n\nNow summarize safe/unsafe for each freeway by turn T.\n\nTurn T from 2 onwards.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=8,9; safe otherwise\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, unsafe at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=6; safe otherwise\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=6; safe otherwise\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=6; safe otherwise\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=4; safe otherwise\n\nNow, player starts at turn 2, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so once I reach y=9, I'm done, and no collision there.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at turn T for some T.\n\nThe position is after actions, so at turn T, y_T is the position.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAnd for all turns from 2 to T-1, when on freeway, it must be safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always.\n\nNow, from y=2 to y=9, I need to increase y by 7.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want as few S or D as possible, but I might need to wait if unsafe.\n\nSince I need to pass through y=3 to y=8, and each has unsafe times.\n\nI need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe only at T=4\n\n- Freeway 5,6,7 unsafe at T=6\n\n- Freeway 2,3,4 unsafe at T=8,9\n\nNow, I start at T=2, y=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is safe at T=2, since unsafe only at 8,9.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=3,4,5,6,7,8, then to 9.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, which is unsafe only at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSince I start at T=2, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are when to be on which row.\n\nFor example, freeway 8 (y=8) is unsafe at T=4, so I should not be on y=8 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7 unsafe at T=6, so not on them at T=6.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 unsafe at T=8,9, so not on them at T=8 or 9.\n\nNow, since I start at y=2 at T=2, I can go up immediately.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some turn not equal to 4.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the minimal time: if I go straight up, from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves: at T=2, y=2; T=3, y=3; ... up to T=9, y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nStart: T=2, y=2\n\nAfter action at T=2: if U, then T=3, y=3\n\nIf U at T=3, T=4, y=4\n\nIf U at T=4, T=5, y=5\n\nIf U at T=5, T=6, y=6\n\nBut at T=6, y=6, which is freeway 6, unsafe at T=6, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf at some point I stay or go down to change timing.\n\nFor example, at T=5, if I don't go to y=6, but stay or go down.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe at T=6, I need to not be on y=6 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 all unsafe at T=6, since freeways 5,6,7 all unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 are y=5,6,7, all unsafe at T=6.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=5,6, or 7 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y=8 is unsafe, but y=8 is only one.\n\nNow, also at T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\nBut since I'm going up, I might not be on low rows at high turns.\n\nNow, back to min H.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 should be minimized.\n\nLet me denote the actions starting from turn t1=2.\n\nLet t be the turn, starting from t=2.\n\nI need to find actions a_t for t=2,3,... until I reach y=9.\n\ny_{t} for t>=2.\n\ny_2 = 2.\n\nEach action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H-1 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=2 to t=2+H-1, with y at turn t.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, I reach y=9 at turn t1 + H -1? t1=2, so at turn 2 + H -1 = H+1? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn t1=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 2, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nAfter first action at turn 2, I go to turn 3, y_{3} = y_{2} + Δy, etc.\n\nI reach (0,9) at some turn T, meaning y_T =9.\n\nThe number of actions is the number of moves from turn 2 to turn T-1, so H = T - 2 + 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 2, before any action, position is given.\n\nI perform action at turn 2 to go to turn 3, action at turn 3 to go to turn 4, ..., up to action at turn K to go to turn K+1 with y_{K+1}=9.\n\nThen I reach at turn K+1.\n\nThe last action is at turn K, to set y_{K+1}=9.\n\nThe number of actions is K - 2 + 1? From turn 2 to turn K, that's K-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nStart: turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at turn t+1 is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI want y_{t_final} =9 for some t_final.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t to t_final -1.\n\nThe number of actions H = t_final - t.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=2, so actions at turns: 2 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns 2,3,4,..., up to 2 + H -1.\n\nThen, after these H actions, I am at position at turn (2 + H -1) +1? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn t, I move to turn t+1.\n\nSo after actions at turns 2,3,4,...,M, I am at turn M+1.\n\nSet M = 2 + H -1? t from 0 to H-1, so turns: t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0, turn t1; t=1, turn t1+1; ... t=H-1, turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these actions, I am at turn (t1 + H -1) + 1 = t1 + H.\n\nAnd I want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=0, no actions, at turn t1, position (0,2), not 9.\n\nH=1: one action at turn t1=2, go to turn 3, y_3 could be 1,2,3.\n\nBut y=2 to y=9, min 7 up moves, so H at least 7.\n\nIf I take actions at turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 (7 actions), I go to turn 9, y_9.\n\nWith 7 U, y_9 = 2 +7 =9.\n\nBut may not be possible due to cars.\n\nIn general, with H actions, I reach turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=2, so at turn 2+H.\n\ny_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe number of net up moves must be +7, since from 2 to 9.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nLet U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S.\n\nU + D + S = H\n\ny_final = y_start + U - D = 2 + U - D =9, so U - D =7.\n\nAlso, U + D + S = H.\n\nThus H = U + D + S = (U - D) + 2D + S = 7 + 2D + S >=7.\n\nMinimal when D=0 and S=0, H=7.\n\nBut may not be possible, so I may need S or D, increasing H.\n\nNow back to the unsafe times.\n\nI need to ensure that for all turns from t=2 to t=2+H -1, when I am on a freeway (y_t between 1 and 8), it is safe at that turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t, which is set by previous action.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nFor t from 2 to (2+H)-1 = 1+H? Let's see.\n\nTurns when I am on position: from turn 2 to turn 2+H -1? At turn 2+H, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe turns when I might be on freeway are from turn 2 to turn 2+H -1.\n\nFor example, with H actions, I am at turns 2,3,4,...,2+H-1 on positions, and turn 2+H at y=9 safe.\n\nNow y_t for t=2 to 2+H-1.\n\nEach must be safe if on freeway.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9 in H turns, with U - D =7, and H = U + D + S.\n\nTo min H, min S and D.\n\nBut I need to avoid unsafe states.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\n- At T=4, y=8 unsafe\n\n- At T=6, y=5,6,7 unsafe (since freeways 5,6,7)\n\n- At T=8, y=2,3,4 unsafe\n\n- At T=9, y=2,3,4 unsafe\n\nSince I start at T=2, y=2, and go up, I will be on higher y at later turns, so probably not on low y at T=8 or 9, so maybe T=8,9 unsafe for low y is not a problem.\n\nSimilarly, T=4 and T=6 are critical.\n\nNow, let's try to go straight up if possible, but we saw at T=6, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSince I am going up, at T=6, I could be below or above.\n\nFor example, if I delay or advance.\n\nStart: T=2, y=2, safe.\n\nI can go up or stay.\n\nSuppose I go up at T=2: to y=3 at T=3.\n\nT=3, y=3, freeway 3, safe since unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nGo up to y=4 at T=4.\n\nT=4, y=4, freeway 4, safe at T=4? Freeway 4 unsafe at T=8,9, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nBut at T=4, freeway 8 is unsafe, but I am on y=4, not y=8.\n\nNow, if I go up to y=5 at T=5.\n\nT=5, y=5, freeway 5, safe since unsafe only at T=6, not T=5.\n\nNow at T=5, I need to go to y=6 at T=6, but at T=6, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=6 at T=6.\n\nOptions at T=5: I can stay, so y=5 at T=6, but y=5 at T=6 is unsafe, since freeway 5 unsafe at T=6.\n\nOr I can go down to y=4 at T=6, but y=4 at T=6: freeway 4, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 4 is unsafe only at T=8,9, not T=6, so safe.\n\nBut y=4 at T=6, then I need to go up later.\n\nOr I can go up to y=6 at T=6, but unsafe.\n\nSo only choices: stay or go down.\n\nIf stay at T=5, y=5 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf go down, to y=4 at T=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, I can go up or etc.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom above: at T=5, y=5, action: if S, then T=6 y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf D, then T=6 y=4, safe.\n\nIf U, T=6 y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo only possible to go down to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut I was at y=5, go down to y=4, which is moving down, but I need to go up, so it wastes time.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7, y=5, freeway 5, is it safe at T=7?\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=7 safe.\n\nThen go up to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at T=6, but T=8, freeway 6 safe? Freeway 6 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=8 safe.\n\nThen go up to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=6, not T=9, safe.\n\nThen go up to y=8 at T=10.\n\nT=10, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only at T=4, not T=10, safe.\n\nThen go up to y=9 at T=11.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns and positions:\n\nTurn 2: y=2, action U? I need to start from action.\n\nAt turn 2, y=2, I go up to y=3 at T=3.\n\nIn this sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nStart: turn 2, position y=2.\n\nAction at turn 2: I need to set where to go for turn 3.\n\nIn my earlier, I assumed I went up to y=3 at T=3, but let's be systematic.\n\nSet actions:\n\nAt turn 2: action U, so y_3 = 3\n\nTurn 3: action U, y_4 =4\n\nTurn 4: action U, y_5 =5\n\nNow at turn 5, y_5=5, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go U, y_6=6, unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf S, y_6=5, unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf D, y_6=4, safe.\n\nSo must go D at turn 5? But D is down, to y=4.\n\nAction D at turn 5: y_6 = y_5 -1 =5-1=4\n\nThen at turn 6, y_6=4, position.\n\nNow action at turn 6: I can go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nSo action U at turn 6: y_7 =5\n\nTurn 7, y_7=5, action U to y=6 at T=8: y_8=6\n\nTurn 8, y_8=6, action U to y=7 at T=9: y_9=7\n\nTurn 9, y_9=7, action U to y=8 at T=10: y_10=8\n\nTurn 10, y_10=8, action U to y=9 at T=11: y_11=9\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 2 to 10, that's 9 actions? Turns: actions at 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9, since t from 0 to H-1, t1=2, actions at 2 to 2+H-1, then at 2+H, y=9.\n\nHere at turn 11, y=9, so 2+H=11, H=9.\n\nBut U - D = number of net up.\n\nHere actions: U at 2,3,4, D at 5, U at 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSo U: turns 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10: 8 U\n\nD: turn 5: 1 D\n\nS: 0\n\nU - D =8-1=7, yes.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? I used one down, so H=9>7.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid going down by staying or timing differently.\n\nFor example, at some point stay to delay.\n\nStart at T=2, y=2.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay at y=2 for some turns.\n\nBut y=2 at later turns might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at T=2, if I stay: action S at turn 2, then y_3=2.\n\nT=3, y=2, freeway 2, safe? At T=3, freeway 2: earlier, unsafe at T=8,9, so T=3 safe.\n\nThen I can go up, but I need to go to higher y.\n\nBut staying at low y might make me hit the unsafe times for low y later.\n\nSince I need to be on high y, better to go up early if possible.\n\nAnother idea: at T=5, instead of going down, I could have stayed earlier to avoid being at y=5 at T=5.\n\nFor example, start at T=2, y=2.\n\nAction S: stay, so y_3=2 at T=3.\n\nThen action U at T=3: y_4=3\n\nAction U at T=4: y_5=4\n\nNow T=5, y=4.\n\nAction U at T=5: y_6=5\n\nBut at T=6, y=5, which is unsafe since freeway 5 unsafe at T=6.\n\nProblem.\n\nAction at T=5: if U, y_6=5 unsafe; if S, y_6=4; if D, y_6=3.\n\ny_6=4 or 3, both safe at T=6? y=4 at T=6: freeway 4, unsafe only at T=8,9, so safe.\n\ny=3 at T=6: similarly safe.\n\nBut if I go to y=4 or less, I need to go up later.\n\nFor example, at T=5, y=4, action S: so y_6=4\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, action U to y=5 at T=7.\n\ny_7=5\n\nThen at T=7, y=5, action U to y=6 at T=8: y_8=6\n\nT=8, y=6, action U to y=7 at T=9: y_9=7\n\nT=9, y=7, action U to y=8 at T=10: y_10=8\n\nT=10, y=8, action U to y=9 at T=11: y_11=9\n\nSame as before, H=9 actions: turns 2 to 10.\n\nActions: S at 2, U at 3,4, S at 5? At T=5, I did S, so y_6=4.\n\nActions: turn 2: S (y3=2), turn 3: U (y4=3), turn 4: U (y5=4), turn 5: S (y6=4), turn 6: U (y7=5), turn 7: U (y8=6), turn 8: U (y9=7), turn 9: U (y10=8), turn 10: U (y11=9)\n\nU - D = 6 U - 0 D =6, but started from y=2, to y=9, need +7, but here U=6, no D, so y=2+6=8 at T=11? y_11=9? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter action at turn 10, y_11=9.\n\ny_start=2, after actions, y_end=2 + (U - D)\n\nHere U: actions U at turn 3,4,6,7,8,9,10? Turn 3 U: to y4=3, turn4 U to y5=4, turn6 U to y7=5, turn7 U to y8=6, turn8 U to y9=7, turn9 U to y10=8, turn10 U to y11=9.\n\nSo U actions at turns: 3,4,6,7,8,9,10: 7 U actions.\n\nD: none\n\nS: turn2 S (to y3=2), turn5 S (to y6=4)\n\nSo S at turn2 and turn5.\n\nH= number of actions: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 9 actions, same as before.\n\ny from 2 to 9, +7, U=7, D=0, S=2, H=9.\n\nStill H=9.\n\nBut I have to be on y=8 at some point, which is unsafe at T=4, but in this sequence, I am on y=8 at T=10, which is safe.\n\nNow, can I reach faster?\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal H=7 would be actions at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach y9 at turn9.\n\nBut at T=6, I need to not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nBut with 7 actions to go from y=2 to y=9, I must be on y=6 at some turn, and if that turn is 6, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I can make y=6 at turn not 6.\n\nIn the straight path, y=6 at T=6.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so I cannot skip levels.\n\nI must pass through each y from 2 to 9 sequentially, but I can stay or move down, so I can be on same y multiple times, but for min time, I don't want to.\n\nIn terms of position, I must be on y=2, then y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in sequence if I go up, but I can stay or go down, so not necessarily consecutive.\n\nFor example, from y=2, I can go to y=3 or y=1 or stay, but y=1 is freeway, etc.\n\nBut since I need to go up, going down wastes time.\n\nTo min H, I should avoid down moves.\n\nBut in this case, I need to avoid being on critical rows at critical times.\n\nCritical times: T=4,6,8,9 but T=8,9 for low y.\n\nNow for T=6, y=5,6,7 unsafe.\n\nI need to not be on these at T=6.\n\nSince I start at T=2 y=2, at T=6 I could be below y=5 or above y=7.\n\nFor example, if I go up slowly, at T=6 I could be at y=4 or less.\n\nOr if I go up fast, but I can only be at y=6 at T=6 if straight, or earlier? From T=2 to T=6, I can increase y by at most 4 (if all U), so y<=6 at T=6.\n\nStart T=2 y=2.\n\nAfter 4 actions (turns 2,3,4,5), I can be at y_6 <= 2+4=6.\n\nSimilarly, at least y_6 >=2-4= -2, but y>=0, so y_6 between 0 and 6.\n\nAt T=6, y must not be 5,6,7, so possible y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y=8 unsafe, but at T=4, from T=2, after 2 actions, y_4 <=4, so y<=4, cannot be 8, so no problem for T=4 y=8 unsafe, since I can't be on y=8 at T=4 anyway.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y=2,3,4 unsafe, but at T=8, I might be on higher y if I go fast.\n\nBut for min H, let's try H=7.\n\nWith H=7 actions, reach at turn 2+7=9, y9=9.\n\nActions at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nPositions: y2=2\n\nAfter actions, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9=9.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9.\n\ny9=9, so U - D =7, and H=7, so U + D + S=7, U - D=7, so D=0, S=0, U=7.\n\nThus all actions U, no S or D.\n\nSo sequence: y3=3, y4=4, y5=5, y6=6, y7=7, y8=8, y9=9.\n\nNow check safety:\n\nAt T=2, y=2, safe.\n\nT=3, y=3, freeway 3, safe (unsafe at 8,9)\n\nT=4, y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=5, y=5, freeway 5, safe (unsafe only at T=6)\n\nT=6, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe! Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nThus impossible with H=7.\n\nNow H=8 actions, reach at turn 10, y10=9.\n\nActions: U + D + S =8, U - D =7.\n\nSo possible: 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U and 1 D but U - D=7, so if 8U 1D, U-D=7, so 8-1=7, yes, but H=8, U+D+S=8.\n\nCases: either 7U and 1S, or 8U and 1D? 8U and 1D, U-D=7, yes, or 7U and 1S, U-D=7, D=0.\n\nOr other, but min U.\n\nWith S or D.\n\nNow, positions: y2=2, y3, ..., y10=9.\n\nSince all U except one S or one D, the position sequence has one stay or one down.\n\nNow, I need to avoid y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y6 must not be 5,6,7.\n\nSince y from 2 to 9 with one deviation.\n\nPossible to have y6 <=4 or >=8.\n\nBut at T=6, from start, after 4 actions (turns 2,3,4,5), y6 can be at most 6, at least 0.\n\nSo y6 <=6, cannot be >=8, so only possibility y6 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, y6 must be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, with one S or one D.\n\nIf I have one S, say at some turn, then y increases slower.\n\nFor example, if S at turn k, then y_{k+1} = y_k, so the position stalls.\n\nThen at T=6, y6 might be lower.\n\nSimilarly, if D, y decreases.\n\nNow, y6 <=4.\n\nIn the sequence to y9=9, y must reach 9 by turn 10.\n\nNow, let's list y_t:\n\nt: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\ny: 2, ?, ?, ?, y6, ?, ?, ?, 9\n\nWith y6 <=4.\n\nSince y10=9, and from t=6 to t=10, 4 actions, y from y6 to 9, so increase of 9 - y6.\n\nSince each U +1, D -1, net increase must be 9 - y6.\n\nWith 4 actions, net increase = U - D for those actions.\n\nBut total from t=2 to t=10, 8 actions, net U - D =7.\n\nNow, from t=2 to t=6, positions y2 to y6.\n\nAfter actions at t=2,3,4,5, we get y6.\n\ny2=2, after 4 actions, y6 = 2 + (U_{2-5} - D_{2-5})\n\nSimilarly.\n\ny6 <=4.\n\ny6 = 2 + net up from t=2 to t=5 actions.\n\nActions at t=2,3,4,5 set y6.\n\nNumber of actions from t=2 to t=5: 4 actions (t=2,3,4,5).\n\nAfter these, y6 is set.\n\ny6 = 2 + U_{first4} - D_{first4}\n\nSimilarly, let U_first be number of U in first 4 actions, etc.\n\nU_first + D_first + S_first =4\n\ny6 = 2 + U_first - D_first\n\ny6 <=4, so 2 + U_first - D_first <=4, so U_first - D_first <=2\n\nBut U_first + D_first <=4, so U_first - D_first <=2 is easy.\n\nAlso, since y6 <=4, and y6 >=0.\n\nNow, the remaining actions t=6,7,8,9 to set y7,y8,y9,y10=9.\n\nActions at t=6,7,8,9: 4 actions.\n\ny10 = y6 + U_last - D_last\n\ny10=9, so 9 = y6 + U_last - D_last\n\nU_last + D_last + S_last =4\n\nU_last - D_last = 9 - y6\n\nSince y6 <=4, 9-y6 >=5.\n\nU_last - D_last >=5\n\nBut with 4 actions, U_last - D_last <= U_last <=4, but 4 <5, impossible!\n\nU_last - D_last <=4 since U_last <=4, D_last >=0.\n\nBut 9 - y6 >=5, since y6 <=4, so U_last - D_last >=5 >4, contradiction.\n\nThus impossible with H=8.\n\ny6 <=4, y10=9, so from y6 to y10 in 4 steps (actions t=6 to t=9, positions from y6 to y10).\n\nThe change is over 4 actions, so net change U_last - D_last must be 9 - y6.\n\nSince y6 <=4, 9-y6 >=5.\n\nBut with 4 actions, the maximum net up is 4 (all U), which is 4 <5, so cannot increase by 5 or more in 4 steps.\n\nThus impossible to have y10=9 with y6<=4.\n\nTherefore, for H=8, it is impossible to avoid the collision at T=6, because I must have y6<=4 to be safe, but then I cannot reach y=9 by turn 10 with only 4 more actions.\n\nH=8 actions: actions at turns 2 to 9 (t1 to t1+H-1=2 to 2+8-1=9)\n\nThen at turn 10, y10=9.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 10, positions y6 to y10, but y10 is after action at turn 9.\n\nThe positions: at turn t, y_t for t=6 to 10.\n\nBut y_t to y_{t+1} changes with action at t.\n\nFrom y6 to y10, that is over 4 steps: actions at t=6,7,8,9 affect y7,y8,y9,y10.\n\ny10 = y6 + (U_{6} + U_{7} + U_{8} + U_{9}) - (D_{6} + D_{7} + D_{8} + D_{9}) , since S no change.\n\nLet U_last be number of U in actions 6,7,8,9, etc.\n\ny10 = y6 + U_last - D_last\n\nU_last + D_last + S_last =4\n\ny10=9\n\nSo 9 = y6 + U_last - D_last\n\nThus U_last - D_last = 9 - y6\n\nNow, since y6 <=4, 9-y6 >=5\n\nU_last - D_last >=5\n\nBut U_last <=4, D_last >=0, so U_last - D_last <= U_last <=4 <5, so U_last - D_last <=4 <5, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible for H=8.\n\nThus minimal H must be at least 9, which we have a sequence with H=9.\n\nIn H=9, we reach at turn 11.\n\nWith H=9, actions at turns 2 to 10 (9 actions), y11=9.\n\ny6 at turn 6.\n\nIn the sequence, y6 can be 4, for example.\n\nIn the first sequence I had: with down move, y6=4.\n\nWith stay, also y6=4 possible.\n\nBut in H=9, it works.\n\nCan I have H=9 with no down move? Only stay.\n\nFor example, start at T=2, y=2.\n\nAction S: stay, so y3=2\n\nThen action U: y4=3\n\nAction U: y5=4\n\nNow at T=5, y=4\n\nIf I go U, y6=5, unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf S, y6=4\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, action U: y7=5\n\nThen U to y8=6 at T=8\n\nU to y9=7 at T=9\n\nU to y10=8 at T=10\n\nU to y11=9 at T=11\n\nActions: turn2: S (y3=2), turn3: U (y4=3), turn4: U (y5=4), turn5: S (y6=4), turn6: U (y7=5), turn7: U (y8=6), turn8: U (y9=7), turn9: U (y10=8), turn10: U (y11=9)\n\nNow, U actions: turns 3,4,6,7,8,9,10: 7 U\n\nS actions: turn2 and turn5: 2 S\n\nD: none\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nCheck safety:\n\nT=2: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nT=3: y=2, freeway 2, safe (unsafe at 8,9)\n\nT=4: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=5: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=6: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5, safe (unsafe only at T=6)\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8, safe (unsafe only at T=4)\n\nT=11: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith one down move earlier: turn2 U to y3=3, turn3 U to y4=4, turn4 U to y5=5, turn5 D to y6=4, turn6 U to y7=5, turn7 U to y8=6, turn8 U to y9=7, turn9 U to y10=8, turn10 U to y11=9.\n\nThen T=6: y=4, safe.\n\nBut in this case, at T=5, y=5, which is safe, since unsafe at T=6 not T=5.\n\nIn both cases, H=9.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=8? We saw impossible.\n\nH=7 impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence with down: actions at turn 2: U, turn3: U, turn4: U, turn5: D, turn6: U, turn7: U, turn8: U, turn9: U, turn10: U\n\nBut with H=9, actions from t=2 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence with stays: turn2: S, turn3: U, turn4: U, turn5: S, turn6: U, turn7: U, turn8: U, turn9: U, turn10: U\n\nBoth work.\n\nBut in the stay sequence, I have two S, but H same.\n\nI could have only one S or something, but with H=9, min U is 7, so must have two non-U actions, either S or D.\n\nBut D might be better or worse, but same H.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, also, I need to avoid other unsafe times, but in this case, at T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe, but in the sequence, at T=8, I am on y=6 or 7, high, not low, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=9, y=7 or higher.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, unsafe at T=4, but I am not on it at T=4.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo with H=9, it works.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for the stay one: actions S at turn2 and turn5.\n\nI could have S at different turns.\n\nBut minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nt1=2.\n\nSo for example, with the stay sequence:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut H=9, actions from turn 2 to turn 10, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, after action at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nt1 + H = 2 + 9 =11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 10, action U to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm if at turn 11, it is reached, but collision only on freeways, y=9 safe.\n\nIn the actions, for turn 10, action U, but y10=8, to y11=9.\n\nIn the sequence I have turn 10: U.\n\nIn the list, it should be up to turn 10 action.\n\nWith the down sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nSame, but with D at turn 5.\n\nIn terms of the car at T=6, in both cases I avoid being on y=5,6,7.\n\nIn the down sequence, at turn 5, I go down to y=4, which is fine.\n\nBut I think both are acceptable.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with only one extra action, but we saw H=8 impossible.\n\nAnother thought: can I be on y=8 at T=4? But y=8 at T=4, from start, after 2 actions, y<=4, impossible, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output one.\n\nI think the stay sequence is fine.\n\nTo make it with fewer non-up moves, but both have two non-up: either two S or one D and one less U, but in down sequence, U=8, D=1, net U=7, same as U=7,S=2.\n\nBut in terms of position, same.\n\nI think either is ok.\n\nBut in the stay sequence, I have S at turn 2, which is at the beginning.\n\nPerhaps I can have S later.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, in the car state, freeway 5,6,7 all have cars, but we handled.\n\nIn freeway 8, at T=4 unsafe, but not an issue.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nSo for the sequence with stays:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nWith the down move:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the down move sequence, at turn 10, action U to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut in both, same.\n\nI think I'll go with the stay sequence to avoid down move.\n\nBut down move is fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects a sequence.\n\nAnother sequence: I could go to y=1 or something, but y=1 is freeway, might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at T=2, if I go down to y=1, but y=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, as we saw.\n\nBut then I start from lower, might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, go D to y=1 at T=3.\n\nThen I need to go from y=1 to 9, which is 8 up, so more actions, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to make sure that when I am on a row, it is safe.\n\nIn the stay sequence: at T=3, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nT=4, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nT=5, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nT=6, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nT=7, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\netc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSimilarly for down sequence.\n\nI think I'll output the stay sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, after action at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nThe actions are for turns 2 to 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ ... }\n\nWith the text.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions detailed below.\n\n### Solution Reasoning\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2 and must reach \\(y = 9\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and \\(0\\) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- Analysis of car positions shows critical unsafe times:\n  - Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are unsafe at turn 6 (i.e., being on \\(y = 5, 6,\\) or \\(7\\) at turn 6 causes collision).\n  - Other unsafe times (e.g., freeway 8 at turn 4, freeways 2–4 at turns 8–9) do not affect the player due to the path taken.\n- A direct upward path in 7 turns (all \"U\" actions) results in collision at turn 6 on \\(y = 6\\).\n- Paths with \\(H = 8\\) are impossible because avoiding collision at turn 6 requires \\(y_6 \\leq 4\\), but reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 with only 4 actions from turn 6 requires a net increase of at least 5, which is impossible in 4 steps (maximum net increase is 4).\n- Thus, \\(H = 9\\) is minimal, achieved with 7 \"U\" actions and 2 \"S\" actions, resulting in \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 is only unsafe at turns 8–9).\n- The player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=2}^{10}\\) (9 actions) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11 is:\n\n```\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n```\n\n### Verification\n- **Turn 2**: Action \"S\", stay at \\(y = 2\\). Position at turn 3: \\((0, 2)\\). Freeway 2 safe at turn 3 (unsafe only at turns 8–9).\n- **Turn 3**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 3\\). Position at turn 4: \\((0, 3)\\). Freeway 3 safe at turn 4.\n- **Turn 4**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 4\\). Position at turn 5: \\((0, 4)\\). Freeway 4 safe at turn 5.\n- **Turn 5**: Action \"S\", stay at \\(y = 4\\). Position at turn 6: \\((0, 4)\\). Freeway 4 safe at turn 6.\n- **Turn 6**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 5\\). Position at turn 7: \\((0, 5)\\). Freeway 5 safe at turn 7 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 7**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 6\\). Position at turn 8: \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway 6 safe at turn 8 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 8**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 7\\). Position at turn 9: \\((0, 7)\\). Freeway 7 safe at turn 9 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- **Turn 9**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 8\\). Position at turn 10: \\((0, 8)\\). Freeway 8 safe at turn 10 (unsafe only at turn 4).\n- **Turn 10**: Action \"U\", move to \\(y = 9\\). Position at turn 11: \\((0, 9)\\), which is safe.\n\nAll positions on freeways are safe at their respective turns, and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 11 with \\(H = 9\\) actions.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U}}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 3, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, based on the directions given: all are \"right\". So for each car, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)], since it's right-moving. t_1 is the current turn, which is 3.\n\nLet me denote t = T - t_1, so t is the number of turns from now. At relative time t (from current), for a car with initial head h, tail τ, speed s, right-moving, the span is:\n\nleft end: τ + s * t\n\nright end: h + s * t\n\nSince it's moving right, the tail is the left end initially, I think. Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: head 57, tail 46, direction right. So at t_1, span is [46, 57], since head and tail, with tail being left end for right-moving? Let's see.\n\nIt says: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it was [h, τ] with h left, τ right, I think, but all are right here.\n\nSo for right-moving car:\n\nInitial left end: τ\n\nInitial right end: h\n\nAt time T, left end: τ + s*(T - t_1)\n\nRight end: h + s*(T - t_1)\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at y_T, and 0 is in the span for that freeway at time T. Meaning, at the time when the player is on that row, if there's a car covering x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new row until the next turn. So if you move at turn T to y_{T+1}, you are on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position is given for turn t_1: (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,2)\n\nThen after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9, starting from y=2.\n\ny goes from 0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars there.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, so on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nBut we start on (0,2), which is on freeway y=2, and need to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, that's 7 steps up, but we can go down or stay, but since we need to go up, probably mostly up, but we might need to wait to avoid cars.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, down decreases by 1, stay keeps same.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, so we can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we want as few actions as possible, so ideally go straight up, but we have to avoid collisions on the rows y=1 to 8 at the times we are there.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, we can delay to avoid cars.\n\nBut since we need to minimize H, the number of turns, we should avoid unnecessary delays, so only wait or move down if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 3.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, we have the initial span at t=0 (relative time).\n\nLet t be the number of turns elapsed from now, so at t=0, it's turn t_1=3.\n\nAt relative time t, which corresponds to absolute turn T = t_1 + t = 3 + t.\n\nNow for each freeway, we need to know when a car is at x=0, meaning when 0 is in the span for that car at time t.\n\nCollision if player is on that freeway at time t, and for some car on that freeway, 0 in span(t).\n\nFor a given freeway y and time t, if there is a car on y such that 0 in its span at t, then it's occupied at (0,y) at time t.\n\nPlayer at position (0, y_t) at time t, so if y_t = y and the freeway y is occupied at x=0 at time t, collision.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when they occupy x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: head 57, tail 46, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSo initial at t=0: left end τ=46, right end h=57, so span [46,57] at t=0.\n\nSince moving right, at time t: left end = 46 + 3t, right end = 57 + 3t.\n\n0 is in span if 46 + 3t <= 0 <= 57 + 3t? No.\n\nThe span is [left, right], so 0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for freeway 1: left = 46 + 3t, right = 57 + 3t\n\n0 in span if 46 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= 57 + 3t\n\nBut 46 + 3t <= 0 implies t <= -46/3 = -15.333, which is impossible since t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 57 + 3t always true for t>=0.\n\n46 + 3t <= 0? 46 + 3t is at least 46 >0, so left end is always positive, so 0 is never in [46+3t, 57+3t] for t>=0.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe; no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nHead h = -30? Tail τ = -41?\n\nSpan at t=0: [τ, h] = [-41, -30] for right-moving? Direction right.\n\nFrom problem: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nτ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so [left, right] = [τ, h]\n\nHere τ = -41, h = -30, so at t=0, span [-41, -30]\n\nMoving right, speed 6.\n\nAt time t: left end = τ + s t = -41 + 6t\n\nRight end = h + s t = -30 + 6t\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, i.e., -41 + 6t <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 6t\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 6t <= 0 => 6t <= 41 => t <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so t <= 6 since t integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -30 + 6t => 30 <= 6t => t >= 5.\n\nSo for t=5 and t=6, both true.\n\nt=5: left = -41 + 30 = -11 <=0, right = -30 + 30 =0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in [-11,0]? At t=5, left = -41 + 6*5 = -41 +30 = -11, right = -30 +30=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, t=6: left = -41 +36 = -5, right = -30 +36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=4: left = -41+24= -17 <=0, right = -30+24= -6 <0, so 0 not in [-17,-6]\n\nt=7: left = -41+42=1 >0, right= -30+42=12>0, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied at t=5 and t=6.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-30,-41,right,6) exactly same car?\n\nNo, it's listed separately, but same parameters, so probably same behavior.\n\nFreeway 3: car (-30,-41,right,6), same as freeway 2, so occupied at t=5 and t=6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, (-30,-41,right,6), occupied t=5,6.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12)\n\nHead and tail.\n\nFirst car: head h=-36? Tail τ=-47? That seems odd, but let's see.\n\nSpan at t=0: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nAt time t: left = -47 + 12t, right = -36 + 12t\n\n0 in span if -47 +12t <=0 and 0 <= -36 +12t\n\nFirst: -47+12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈3.916, t<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12t => 36 <=12t => t >=3\n\nSo t=3: left = -47+36= -11 <=0, right= -36+36=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nt=4: left = -47+48=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at t=3.\n\nNow second car on freeway 5: (36,25,right,12)\n\nHead h=36, tail τ=25? Span [τ,h] = [25,36] at t=0.\n\nMoving right, speed 12.\n\nAt t: left=25+12t, right=36+12t, both positive, so left >=25>0, so 0 not in [25+12t,36+12t] for t>=0.\n\nAlways safe.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only the first car is a threat, at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nSame as freeway 5, so occupied at t=3 by first car.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSpan at t=0: [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nAt t: left = -23 +12t, right = -12 +12t\n\n0 in span if -23+12t <=0 and 0 <= -12+12t\n\nFirst: -23+12t <=0 => 12t <=23 => t <= 23/12 ≈1.916, t<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+12t => 12 <=12t => t>=1\n\nSo t=1: left = -23+12= -11 <=0, right= -12+12=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nt=2: left= -23+24=1>0, not <=0\n\nSo occupied at t=1.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), same as before, always safe.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at t=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when it is occupied at x=0:\n\n- y=1: never occupied\n\n- y=2: occupied at t=5 and t=6? Freeway 2 is y=2, I think.\n\nFreeways are labeled k=1 to 8, I assume k=1 is y=1, etc., since freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, so k=1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo:\n\ny=1: no car at x=0 ever, as we saw.\n\ny=2: occupied at t=5 and t=6\n\ny=3: same as y=2, occupied at t=5 and t=6 (since freeway 3 has same car)\n\ny=4: same, occupied t=5,6\n\ny=5: occupied at t=3 (from first car)\n\ny=6: occupied at t=3\n\ny=7: occupied at t=3\n\ny=8: occupied at t=1\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=0 (relative time).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: we start at t=0 on y=2.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y for next turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt time t, we are at position y_t, and we take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at time t if we are on a freeway y_t between 1 and 8, and that freeway is occupied at time t.\n\nFor example, at t=0, we are at y=2. Is y=2 occupied at t=0? From above, y=2 occupied at t=5 and 6, not at t=0. t=0 is now, so for y=2, at t=0: we need to check if occupied.\n\nEarlier for y=2, we have freeway 2, which is occupied at t=5 and t=6, but at t=0: for freeway 2, car span at t=0: [-41,-30], which is from x=-41 to -30, so x=0 not included, so not occupied at t=0. Similarly for others.\n\nSo at t=0, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: we need to increase y by 7, from 2 to 9, so minimum 7 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut we can do it in 7 if no obstacles, but there are cars.\n\nNow, the dangerous times for each row:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: occupied at t=5,6 → dangerous at times 5 and 6\n\ny=3: occupied at t=5,6 → dangerous at 5,6\n\ny=4: occupied at t=5,6 → dangerous at 5,6\n\ny=5: occupied at t=3 → dangerous at t=3\n\ny=6: occupied at t=3 → dangerous at t=3\n\ny=7: occupied at t=3 → dangerous at t=3\n\ny=8: occupied at t=1 → dangerous at t=1\n\ny=1 always safe, y=9 safe.\n\nWe start at t=0 on y=2, which is safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, say at time H-1, since we start at t=0, after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nSet t as relative time from now, t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt time t (absolute turn t_1 + t), position y_t.\n\nActions: at each time t, we take action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H, and we want y_H = 9, so at time H, we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt time t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut for collision, at time t, we are at y_t, and we check if freeway y_t is occupied at time t.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0 = 2.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H =9.\n\nWe want minimal H such that we can reach y_H=9 without collision at any time t=0 to H-1? t=0 to H-1, since at time H we are at y=9, which is safe, no collision.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1-8, so at time H, if y_H=9, no collision.\n\nSo we need no collision for t=0 to H-1.\n\nNow, y_t must be between 0 and 9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- For y=5,6,7: dangerous at t=3\n\n- For y=2,3,4: dangerous at t=5 and t=6\n\n- For y=8: dangerous at t=1\n\n- y=1 always safe\n\nWe start at t=0 on y=2, safe.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nFirst, y=8 is dangerous at t=1, so we should not be on y=8 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 dangerous at t=3.\n\ny=2,3,4 dangerous at t=5,6.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, we must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThe critical points are the dangerous times.\n\nWe can be on a row only when it is not dangerous, or we can be there at safe times.\n\nFor example, for y=8, it is dangerous only at t=1, so we can be on y=8 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, let's list for each row the safe times.\n\ny=1: all t\n\ny=2: safe except t=5,6\n\ny=3: safe except t=5,6\n\ny=4: safe except t=5,6\n\ny=5: safe except t=3\n\ny=6: safe except t=3\n\ny=7: safe except t=3\n\ny=8: safe except t=1\n\nNow, we need to go from y=2 at t=0 to y=9 at some t=H.\n\nEach step, we can increase y by 0 or ±1, but since we need to go up, decreasing might not help much, except to avoid.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should avoid going down if possible.\n\nMinimal y increase: from 2 to 9, delta y=7, so minimal H=7 if we go up every step.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up directly without collision.\n\nStart: t=0, y=2, safe.\n\nt=0: take action, say U, then y1=3\n\nBut at t=1, y1=3, is it safe? y=3 dangerous at t=5,6, but t=1, not 5 or 6, so safe.\n\nt=1: take U, y2=4\n\nt=2, y2=4, safe? y=4 dangerous at t=5,6, t=2 not, safe.\n\nt=2: take U, y3=5\n\nt=3, y3=5, now y=5 dangerous at t=3! So if we are on y=5 at t=3, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo at t=3, we cannot be on y=5,6, or7.\n\nBut in this path, at t=3 we are on y=5, which is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8 at t=1.\n\nIn this direct path, at t=1, we were on y=3, which is safe at t=1, but at t=3, problem.\n\nNow, we need to adjust.\n\nOne way is to delay our movement so that we are not on the dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=3, we should not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSo possible positions at t=3: we can be on y=4, or y=8, or y=9, etc., but y=9 is goal, probably not yet.\n\nSince we start at y=2 at t=0.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at time t=3, we have y_3.\n\ny_3 depends on actions from t=0 to t=2.\n\ny_0 = 2\n\nAfter a_0, y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAfter a_1, y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nAfter a_2, y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nSo y3 = 2 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSo y3 can be from 2-3= -1, but y>=0, so min 0, up to 2+3=5.\n\nSimilarly, we need y3 not in {5,6,7} to avoid collision at t=3.\n\ny3 <=4 or y3=8 or9, but max y3=5 if all up, min=0 if all down, but we don't want down.\n\ny3 <=4 or y3=8, but y3=8 impossible since max 5.\n\ny3 = 2 + sum of three Δy, each <=1, so y3 <=5, >= -1 but bounded to 0-9.\n\nSo possible y3: 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe need y3 not in {5,6,7}, but 6 and7 impossible, so only y3 ≠5.\n\nSo at t=3, we must not be on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and7 impossible at t=3 since y<=5.\n\nSo only need to avoid y=5 at t=3.\n\ny=5 must be avoided at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, back to the direct path: if we go up at t=0,1,2, y3=5, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to have y3 <=4 or other, but y3=4 is ok, as long as not 5.\n\ny3=4 is safe at t=3.\n\nNow, also, we have to consider later times, like t=5 and6 for y=2,3,4.\n\nBut let's first handle t=3.\n\nSo to avoid y=5 at t=3, we can, for example, at some point, not go up, but stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, we could go to y=1 at some point.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nWe start t=0, y=2.\n\nIf we take S at t=0, then y1=2 (stay), then at t=1, y=2, is it safe? y=2 dangerous at t=5,6, not t=1, so safe.\n\nThen t=1: take U, y2=3\n\nt=2: take U, y3=4\n\nThen at t=3, y3=4, which is safe since y=4 dangerous only at t=5,6, not t=3.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nt=3: take U, y4=5\n\nNow at t=4, y4=5, is it safe? y=5 dangerous only at t=3, not t=4, so safe.\n\nt=4: take U, y5=6\n\nt=5, y5=6, now y=6 dangerous at t=3, but t=5>3, so at t=5, is it dangerous? y=6 dangerous only at t=3, so at t=5, it should be safe, as long as not occupied.\n\nFrom above, for y=6, occupied only at t=3, so at t=5, no car, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: take U, y6=7\n\nt=6, y6=7, y=7 dangerous only at t=3, so at t=6 safe.\n\nt=6: take U, y7=8\n\nt=7, y7=8, now y=8 dangerous at t=1, not t=7, so safe.\n\nt=7: take U, y8=9, done.\n\nH=8 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=7, 8 actions, y from 2 to 9 in 7 steps? Let's list:\n\nt (time) | y_t | action a_t | y_{t+1}\n\nt=0: y0=2, take S (stay), y1=2\n\nt=1: y1=2, take U, y2=3\n\nt=2: y2=3, take U, y3=4\n\nt=3: y3=4, take U, y4=5\n\nt=4: y4=5, take U, y5=6\n\nt=5: y5=6, take U, y6=7\n\nt=6: y6=7, take U, y7=8\n\nt=7: y7=8, take U, y8=9\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt each time t, position y_t, is freeway occupied?\n\nt=0: y=2, freeway 2, occupied only at t=5,6, not t=0, safe.\n\nt=1: y=2, same, safe.\n\nt=2: y=3, freeway 3, occupied at t=5,6, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3: y=4, freeway 4, occupied at t=5,6, not t=3, safe.\n\nt=4: y=5, freeway 5, occupied only at t=3, not t=4, safe.\n\nt=5: y=6, freeway 6, occupied only at t=3, not t=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=7, freeway 7, occupied only at t=3, not t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=8, freeway 8, occupied only at t=1, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=9, safe, but we are done at t=8, y=9.\n\nH=8 actions? But we have 8 actions, from t=0 to t=7, reaching y8=9 at time t=8.\n\nBut minimal possible is 7, but here we took an extra stay at beginning.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nIn this sequence, we used 8 turns to go from y=2 to y=9, but we could have gone directly in 7 if not for the danger.\n\nBut at t=3, we need to not be on y=5.\n\nIn the direct path, if we go up at t=0,1, we would be at y=4 at t=2, then if we stay at t=2, y3=4, then proceed.\n\nt=0: y0=2, take U, y1=3\n\nt=1: y1=3, take U, y2=4\n\nt=2: y2=4, now at t=2, take S (stay), y3=4\n\nt=3: y3=4, safe as before.\n\nThen t=3: take U, y4=5\n\nt=4: y4=5, take U, y5=6\n\nt=5: y5=6, take U, y6=7\n\nt=6: y6=7, take U, y7=8\n\nt=7: y7=8, take U, y8=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=0: y=2, safe\n\nt=1: y=3, safe\n\nt=2: y=4, safe? t=2, y=4 dangerous at t=5,6, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3: y=4, safe\n\nt=4: y=5, safe (not t=3)\n\nt=5: y=6, safe (not t=3)\n\nt=6: y=7, safe\n\nt=7: y=8, safe\n\nt=8: y=9, done.\n\nSo H=8 actions again? From t=0 to t=7, 8 actions.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=8.\n\nIn terms of number of actions: we took actions at t=0 to t=7, that's 8 actions, to go from y0=2 to y8=9.\n\nBut since we start at y0=2, and after k actions, we are at y_k.\n\nTo go from 2 to 9, delta=7, so with 7 up moves, we can be at y7=9.\n\nBut here with 7 actions: if we take 7 ups, we go from y0=2 to y7=9.\n\ny0=2, after a0=U, y1=3; after a1=U, y2=4; ... after a6=U, y7=9.\n\nTime from t=0 to t=6 we are on positions, and at t=7 we are at y=9.\n\nNow, in this case, at t=3, y3=5, which is dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nWith 7 actions, can we reach y7=9 without collision?\n\ny7=9, so we must have taken exactly 7 up moves, since any down or stay would require more actions to reach 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2 in exactly 7 actions, we must take exactly 7 up moves and no down or stay, because each down or stay reduces the net gain.\n\nEach up: +1, down: -1, stay:0.\n\nNet change must be +7, so number of up minus number of down must be 7, and number of actions H, with up + down + stay = H, and up - down =7.\n\nSo up = down +7.\n\nThen H = up + down + stay = (down +7) + down + stay = 2 down + stay +7.\n\nMinimal H when down=0, stay=0, H=7.\n\nIf down or stay, H>7.\n\nSo minimal possible H is 7, achieved only with all up moves.\n\nBut with all up moves: y_t = 2 + t for t=0 to 6, y_t = 2+t\n\nAt t=0: y=2, safe\n\nt=1: y=3, safe\n\nt=2: y=4, safe\n\nt=3: y=5, dangerous! Collision.\n\nSo impossible with H=7.\n\nThus minimal H must be at least 8.\n\nNow, with H=8, we can have, for example, one stay or one down.\n\nIn the sequences I had earlier, with one stay, we can do it.\n\nFor example, the first sequence I thought: start with stay, then all up.\n\nOr start with two ups, then stay at t=2, then all up.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y=9 at t=8 with 8 actions.\n\nBut in the second sequence: actions: t=0: U, t=1: U, t=2: S, t=3: U, t=4: U, t=5: U, t=6: U, t=7: U\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=0: y0=2\n\na0=U, y1=3\n\nt=1: y1=3, a1=U, y2=4\n\nt=2: y2=4, a2=S, y3=4\n\nt=3: y3=4, a3=U, y4=5\n\nt=4: y4=5, a4=U, y5=6\n\nt=5: y5=6, a5=U, y6=7\n\nt=6: y6=7, a6=U, y7=8\n\nt=7: y7=8, a7=U, y8=9\n\nCollision check:\n\nt=0: y=2, safe\n\nt=1: y=3, safe\n\nt=2: y=4, safe (t=2 not 5 or 6)\n\nt=3: y=4, safe\n\nt=4: y=5, safe (not t=3)\n\nt=5: y=6, now at t=5, y=6 is freeway 6, which is dangerous at t=3, but not at t=5. Is it occupied? Earlier, for y=6, car only at t=3, so at t=5, no car, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=6: y=7, freeway 7, occupied only t=3, so safe at t=6.\n\nt=7: y=8, freeway 8, occupied only t=1, so safe at t=7.\n\nt=8: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe used one stay at t=2.\n\nCould we use a down move? But that might not help and could increase H more.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=1, but y=1 is safe, but it might take extra steps.\n\nBut with one stay, H=8 is fine.\n\nNow, but we have to consider that at t=5 and t=6, y=2,3,4 are dangerous.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=5, we are on y=6, which is not 2,3,4, so safe.\n\nAt t=6, y=7, not 2,3,4, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, in the other sequence with initial stay: at t=0: S, y1=2\n\nt=1: y1=2, U, y2=3\n\nt=2: y2=3, U, y3=4\n\nt=3: y3=4, U, y4=5\n\nt=4: y4=5, U, y5=6\n\nt=5: y5=6, U, y6=7\n\nt=6: y6=7, U, y7=8\n\nt=7: y7=8, U, y8=9\n\nNow at t=5: y=6, safe\n\nt=6: y=7, safe\n\nBut at t=0 and t=1, we were on y=2, but at t=0 and t=1, y=2 is safe, since dangerous only at t=5,6.\n\nSo also fine.\n\nNow, both sequences have H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? We saw not, because all up causes collision at t=3.\n\nPerhaps by going down, but with H=7, we must have all up, no down or stay, so impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=3.\n\nt_1=3, current turn.\n\nWe need actions for turns: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, take action a_{t_1}, which affects position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nIn relative time, t=0 is turn t_1=3.\n\nSo actions at t=0 to H-1.\n\nWe need H actions to reach at time H.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at y_H =9.\n\nFor example, with H=8, actions from t=0 to t=7.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I had: with stay at t=2.\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=0 (turn 3): action U? In the sequence above: for the second sequence.\n\nLet's define the actions.\n\nSequence 1: with initial stay\n\nt=0 (turn 3): S (stay, so y remains 2 for next? At turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart: turn t_1=3, position y=2.\n\nTake a_3 (which is a_{t_1} at t=0)\n\nIn the sequence where we take S first:\n\nAt turn 3 (t=0): take S, so Δy=0, so at turn 4, y=2 +0 =2? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn 3, y_3=2\n\nTake a_3=S, so Δy_3=0, thus y_4 = y_3 + 0 = 2\n\nThen at turn 4 (t=1): y_4=2, take a_4=U, so Δy_4=+1, y_5=2+1=3\n\nTurn 5 (t=2): y_5=3, take a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nTurn 6 (t=3): y_6=4, take a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nTurn 7 (t=4): y_7=5, take a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nTurn 8 (t=5): y_8=6, take a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9 (t=6): y_9=7, take a_9=U, y_{10}=8\n\nTurn 10 (t=7): y_{10}=8, take a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn 11, with actions from turn 3 to turn 10, that's 8 actions.\n\nBut turn t_1 + H -1, let's see.\n\nStart turn: t_1=3\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, H=8, at turn 3+8=11, y=9.\n\nActions at turns: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, i.e., a_3 to a_{10} for H=8.\n\nNow, in the other sequence: with stay later.\n\nt=0 (turn 3): take U, so a_3=U, then y_4 = y_3 +1 = 2+1=3\n\nt=1 (turn 4): y_4=3, take a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nt=2 (turn 5): y_5=4, take a_5=S (stay), so y_6=4\n\nt=3 (turn 6): y_6=4, take a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=4 (turn 7): y_7=5, take a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=5 (turn 8): y_8=6, take a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=6 (turn 9): y_9=7, take a_9=U, y_{10}=8\n\nt=7 (turn 10): y_{10}=8, take a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9\n\nSame, H=8.\n\nIn terms of the actions, both are fine.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 5 (t=2), we are on y=4, and take stay.\n\nNow, but we need to check if at any time we are on a dangerous row.\n\nIn this case, at turn 5, which is absolute turn, but in relative time, t=2.\n\ny=4 at t=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, but we have to consider that at t=5 and t=6, y=2,3,4 are dangerous.\n\nIn this sequence, at relative t=5: what turn?\n\nt=0: turn 3\n\nt=1: turn 4\n\nt=2: turn 5\n\nt=3: turn 6\n\nt=4: turn 7\n\nt=5: turn 8\n\nAt t=5 (relative), absolute turn 8, position y_8=6? In the sequence:\n\nAt turn 8 (t=5), y_8=6, which is y=6, not 2,3,4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=6 (turn 9), y=7, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for y=2,3,4, dangerous at t=5 and t=6 relative.\n\nt=5 relative is absolute turn 3 +5 =8\n\nt=6 relative is turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, y=6, not on 2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly turn 9, y=7.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, we also have y=8 dangerous at t=1 relative.\n\nt=1 relative is turn 4.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 4, y=3? In the sequence: at turn 4, y_4=3, which is y=3, not 8, so not on y=8 at t=1, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, in the other sequence.\n\nSo both sequences work with H=8.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=7? We thought no, but let's confirm.\n\nWith H=7, must have all up actions.\n\nThen positions: at turn 3: y=2\n\nTurn 4: y=3\n\nTurn 5: y=4\n\nTurn 6: y=5\n\nTurn 7: y=6\n\nTurn 8: y=7\n\nTurn 9: y=8\n\nTurn 10: y=9\n\nAt turn 6 (absolute), which is relative t=3 (since t=0 at turn 3), y=5.\n\nRelative t=3, y=5, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we could be elsewhere, but with all up, we must be at y=5 at t=3 relative.\n\nThus impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, we can choose either.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions starting from turn t_1=3.\n\nLet's take the sequence with stay at t=2 relative.\n\nRelative t=0 (turn 3): U\n\nt=1 (turn 4): U\n\nt=2 (turn 5): S\n\nt=3 (turn 6): U\n\nt=4 (turn 7): U\n\nt=5 (turn 8): U\n\nt=6 (turn 9): U\n\nt=7 (turn 10): U\n\nThen y at turn 11=9.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut the player is at (0,2) at turn 3.\n\nAfter actions, reach (0,9) at turn 11.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut we need to specify the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nH=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut Turn 10 is t_1 + H -1 = 3 + 8 -1 = 10, yes.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the freeway 8 at t=1 relative.\n\nt=1 relative is turn 4.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 4, y=3, not 8, so no issue.\n\nIf we had gone to y=8 earlier, but in this path, we are at y=8 at turn 10? In the sequence above, at turn 10, we take U to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, we are at y=8, and take U.\n\nNow, at turn 10, relative t=7, y=8, which is safe since dangerous only at t=1 relative.\n\nt=1 relative is turn 4.\n\nSo fine.\n\nAnother thing: at t=5 and t=6 relative, which are turn 8 and 9, we are on y=6 and7, which are not dangerous at those times.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there any other dangers?\n\nFor example, freeway 5: occupied only at t=3 relative.\n\nt=3 relative is turn 6.\n\nIn sequence, at turn 6, y=4? In the sequence: turn 6, y_6=4 (after action? Positions:\n\nTurn 6: y_6=4? Let's list absolute turns.\n\nTurn 3: y=2, take U\n\nTurn 4: y=3 (position at turn 4), take U\n\nTurn 5: y=4, take S → y_6=4\n\nTurn 6: y=4, take U → y_7=5\n\nTurn 7: y=5, take U → y_8=6\n\nTurn 8: y=6, take U → y_9=7\n\nTurn 9: y=7, take U → y_{10}=8\n\nTurn 10: y=8, take U → y_{11}=9\n\nAt turn 6: y=4, which is freeway 4, occupied at t=5,6 relative? t relative at turn 6: since turn 6 is t=3 (because turn 3 is t=0, turn 4 t=1, turn 5 t=2, turn 6 t=3).\n\nRelative t=3.\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at t=5 and t=6 relative, not t=3, so safe.\n\nAt turn 6, y=4, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nTo have a sequence without stay, but we need H=8, so we have to have one non-up action.\n\nWe could have a down action, but it might not save time and could be worse.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=1 at some point, but then we need an extra up, so H might be larger.\n\nBut with H=8, one stay is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut Turn 10 is the last action, to go to y=9.\n\nSince we need to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 11 after action at turn 10.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can start with down, but not necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: go to y=1 at some point.\n\nFor example, at turn 3: D, then y=1 at turn 4, but y=1 safe, then go up, but it might take more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the above is fine.\n\nIn the initial state, freeway 5 has a car at t=3, but we avoided it.\n\nI think that's all.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 8, with the sequence of actions avoiding all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Freeway Occupancy at Critical Times**:\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) are occupied only at relative time \\(t = 3\\) (absolute turn 6), so the player must not be on these rows at turn 6.\n  - \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are occupied at relative times \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 6\\) (absolute turns 8 and 9), so the player must avoid these rows at turns 8 and 9.\n  - \\(y = 8\\) is occupied at relative time \\(t = 1\\) (absolute turn 4), so the player must avoid this row at turn 4.\n  - \\(y = 1\\) is always safe, and \\(y = 9\\) is safe (no freeway).\n\n- **Sequence Path**:\n  - At turn 3 (relative \\(t = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 0\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 3 moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4.\n  - At turn 4 (relative \\(t = 1\\)), \\(y = 3\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 1\\)), and \\(y = 8\\) is occupied but the player is not on it.\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 4 moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5.\n  - At turn 5 (relative \\(t = 2\\)), \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 2\\)).\n  - Action \\(S\\) (stay) at turn 5 keeps \\(y = 4\\) for turn 6.\n  - At turn 6 (relative \\(t = 3\\)), \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 3\\)), avoiding \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) which are occupied.\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 6 moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n  - At turn 7 (relative \\(t = 4\\)), \\(y = 5\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 4\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 7 moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n  - At turn 8 (relative \\(t = 5\\)), \\(y = 6\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 5\\)), and \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are occupied but the player is not on them.\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 8 moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n  - At turn 9 (relative \\(t = 6\\)), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 6\\)), and \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are occupied but the player is not on them.\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 9 moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n  - At turn 10 (relative \\(t = 7\\)), \\(y = 8\\) is safe (not occupied at \\(t = 7\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\) at turn 10 moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, reaching the goal safely.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) (turns 3 to 10) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 4.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving, but in the update, left-moving cars have decreasing positions, and right-moving have increasing positions.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the segment covered by the car.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move to y_{T+1}, they are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and only on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway, so once we're there, no collisions to worry about.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t1=4.\n\nFor each freeway k, the cars are given:\n\n- k=1: one car: head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=3. Since direction is right, it's moving right, so span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: at turn t1, span is [tau, head], I think? In the table, for k=1: (60,49,right,3). But head and tail: which is which?\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor k=1: (60,49,right,3). Since direction is right, and for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h], so here tau=49, h=60? But it says head and tail, so head might be the front.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [tau, h] and then moves to [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, tau] to [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT].\n\nIn the notation, for k=1, (head=60, tail=49, right, speed=3). Since right-moving, and span(t1) = [tau, h] = [49,60]? But tail is usually the back, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so [tail, head] should be increasing.\n\nIn the update, it says for right: [tau, h] to [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT], so tau is the left end at t1, h is the right end at t1.\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, tau] with h left, tau right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT], so if it's moving left, h should be the head, which is the front when moving left, so h is the left end at t1, I think? This is confusing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think in terms of position.\n\nAt turn t1, for a car, we have head and tail positions. The direction tells us which way it's moving.\n\nFor collision, we care about the span at time T, and whether 0 is in that span for the freeway we're on.\n\nAlso, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and for that y, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars and their spans at time T.\n\nFirst, define ΔT = T - t1 = T - 4.\n\nFor freeway k=1:\n\nCar: (head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=3)\n\nSince direction right, span at t1: [tail, head] = [49,60]? In the update, for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h], and tau is tail, h is head? In the notation, it's (head, tail), so head=60, tail=49, so for right, span(t1) = [tail, head] = [49,60]\n\nThen at time T, span = [49 + 3*(T-4), 60 + 3*(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35? tail=-35, head=-24, direction right, so span(t1) = [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 6*(T-4), -24 + 6*(T-4)]\n\nk=3: same as k=2, (-24,-35,right,6), so same span.\n\nk=4: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nk=5: two cars: first (-24,-35,right,12), second (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor first car: head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=12, span(t1) = [-35,-24] at T: [-35 +12*(T-4), -24 +12*(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12, span(t1) = [37,48] at T: [37 +12*(T-4), 48 +12*(T-4)]\n\nBut tail=37, head=48, so [37,48]\n\nk=6: same as k=5? k=6: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12), same as k=5.\n\nk=7: same, (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nk=8: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12, so span(t1) = [tail, head] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11 +12*(T-4), 0 +12*(T-4)] = [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT] where ΔT=T-4\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12, span(t1)=[37,48], at T: [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn 4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe player can move U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, but y between 0 and 9.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers position 0 at that turn.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and need to reach y=9, the minimum number of moves is 6 up moves, if we can go directly up without stopping or down.\n\nBut we might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when position 0 is covered by a car.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that k, 0 is in the span of some car at turn T.\n\nFor each k, find the times T when 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nStart with k=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span at T: [49 + 3(ΔT), 60 + 3(ΔT)] where ΔT = T-4\n\n0 is in this span if 49 + 3(ΔT) <= 0 <= 60 + 3(ΔT)\n\nBut 49 + 3(ΔT) <= 0? 49 is positive, and increasing, so min span left is 49 at T=4, which is >0, and as T increases, it increases, so always greater than 0, so 0 never in span for k=1. So no collision possible on k=1 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: car span at T: [-35 + 6(ΔT), -24 + 6(ΔT)]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6(ΔT) <= 0 <= -24 + 6(ΔT)\n\nSo -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so ΔT <= 5 since integer? Turns are discrete, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, integer, so ΔT integer.\n\nSo -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 5.833, so ΔT <= 5\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT => 24 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >= 4\n\nSo for ΔT from 4 to 5 inclusive.\n\nΔT >=4 and ΔT <=5.\n\nSo at T = t1 + ΔT = 4 + 4 = 8 and 4 + 5 = 9, so turns 8 and 9, 0 is in span for k=2.\n\nk=3: same as k=2, since same car, so also turns 8 and 9.\n\nk=4: same, turns 8 and 9.\n\nNow k=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [ -35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in this if -35 +12ΔT <=0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\n-35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\n0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT=2 only.\n\nAt T=4+2=6.\n\nSecond car: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 37 +12ΔT <=0? 37>0, and increasing, always >0, so 0 never <= since min is 37 at ΔT=0, so no.\n\nSo for k=5, only at T=6, 0 is covered by the first car.\n\nk=6: same as k=5, so at T=6.\n\nk=7: same, at T=6.\n\nNow k=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\nAt T, 0 is in span if -11 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nSince 12ΔT >=0 always for ΔT>=0.\n\n-11 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/12 <1, so ΔT <=0 since integer? ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=4, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? -11 <=0 <=0, yes.\n\n0 <= 12ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo at ΔT=0, T=4, 0 is in span.\n\nNow, for ΔT>0, -11+12ΔT <=0? At ΔT=1, -11+12=1>0, so not <=0, so only at ΔT=0.\n\nBut ΔT=0, T=4.\n\nSecond car: [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT], min 37>0, so never 0.\n\nSo for k=8, at T=4, 0 is covered by the first car.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the dangerous times when 0 is covered:\n\n- y=1: never\n\n- y=2: at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: at T=6\n\n- y=6: at T=6\n\n- y=7: at T=6\n\n- y=8: at T=4\n\nAt T=4, for y=8, 0 is covered, but at turn T=4, the player is at y=3, not y=8, so no collision.\n\nWe need to see when the player is on which y at each turn.\n\nPlayer position: start at turn 4, y=3.\n\nActions at each turn determine y for the next turn.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if player is on y=k, and for k, 0 is in some car span at T, collision.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=3 at t=4 to y=9 asap.\n\nMinimum H: if no cars, we can go U each turn, from y=3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 in 5 moves? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=4, y_5 = y4 + Δy, depending on a4.\n\nSimilarly, after a5, y6, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=4, so at turn (4 + H -1) = turn (3+H), y should be 9.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nStart: t=4, y=3.\n\nAfter actions: a_t for t=4,5,6,...\n\nAfter a4, y5 set; after a5, y6 set, etc.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T, and H such that T = t1 + H -1 = 4 + H -1 = 3 + H.\n\nSince we start at turn 4, after 0 actions, y4=3.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=4), y5.\n\nAfter 2 actions (t=4 and t=5), y6.\n\n...\n\nAfter K actions, y_{4+K} = position.\n\nWe want y_{4+K} =9 for some K, and min K, then H=K+1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1, so H actions, from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position is y_{4 + H}.\n\nSet turn index.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at t=4, y4=3.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9, and T as small as possible.\n\nT = 4 + M for some M, where M is number of turns after start.\n\nAfter M turns, we are at turn 4+M.\n\ny_{4+M} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=4 to t=4+M-1, so H = M actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H-1}, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + H} should be 9.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\" is written? Let's check.\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nt1=4, so y_{4 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{4+1-1}=y4=3≠9.\n\nH=2, y_{4+2-1}=y5, should be 9.\n\ny5=9.\n\nBut from y4=3 to y5=9 in one action? Not possible, since max change +1.\n\ny_t changes by at most 1 each step.\n\nSo from y4=3, to reach y=9, need at least 6 steps: to y5=4, y6=5, ..., y10=9.\n\nSo min possible H is when we go up every turn.\n\ny4=3\n\nAfter a4, y5 = y4 + Δy, if a4=U, y5=4\n\na5, if U, y6=5, and so on.\n\nSo to go from 3 to 9, need 6 increases, so min 6 actions.\n\nAfter 6 actions: a4 to a9, y10=9.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{4 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = 4 + H -1, so y_T=9.\n\nFor T=9, y9=9.\n\nWith min H, T=9 when H=6, since 4 + 6 -1=9.\n\ny_{4 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=6, y_{4+6-1}=y9=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=4 to t=4+H-1 = t=4 to 9, 6 actions.\n\nNow, we need to check if we can go directly from y=3 to 9 in 6 turns without collision.\n\nPath: start t=4, y4=3\n\nWe need to set actions such that for each turn from t=4 to t=9, when we are on y_t, it is not a collision time for that y.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t.\n\nFor t=4: y4=3, on freeway y=3.\n\nCollision on y=3 when? Earlier, for y=3, dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nBut at t=4, is it dangerous?\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=8,9, not at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, for y=3, is 0 covered? From above, y=3 has cars, dangerous at T=8,9, so at t=4, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nNow, if we go up each turn:\n\nPlan: always U, so\n\nt=4, y4=3, action a4=U, then y5=4\n\nt=5, y5=4, action a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6, y6=5, action a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7, y7=6, action a7=U, y8=7\n\nt=8, y8=7, action a8=U, y9=8\n\nt=9, y9=8, action a9=U, y10=9\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y9=9? With H=6, y_{4+6-1}=y9, but in this, at t=9, y9=8, not 9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{4 + H -1}\n\nWe want this to be 9.\n\nWith H=6, y_{4+5}? 4+H-1=4+6-1=9, so y9=9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, after a9=U, y10=9, so y9=8.\n\nTo have y9=9, we need to reach y=9 at turn 9.\n\nFrom y4=3, to y9=9, that's 5 steps up? From t=4 to t=9, the position changes from y4 to y9.\n\ny4=3, y9=9, difference 6, so 6 actions needed: from t=4 to t=9, actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9 to set y5,y6,y7,y8,y9,y10? No.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position before action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn 4, y4=3, before any action.\n\nAfter a4, y5 is set.\n\nAt turn 5, y5 is position, then after a5, y6 set, etc.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nWith y_{t1 + H -1} =9, t1=4, so y_{3+H} =9? Set S = t1 + H -1, we want y_S =9.\n\nS = 4 + H -1 = 3 + H.\n\nFor example, if H=6, S=3+6=9, y9=9.\n\nTo have y9=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 9.\n\nFrom y4=3 at turn 4, we need to increase y by 6 in 5 steps? From turn 4 to turn 9, there are 5 actions: t=4 to t=8, setting y5 to y9.\n\nActions: a4 at t=4 sets y5\n\na5 at t=5 sets y6\n\na6 at t=6 sets y7\n\na7 at t=7 sets y8\n\na8 at t=8 sets y9\n\nWe want y9=9.\n\nBut y4=3, so to go from y4=3 to y9=9, we need to increase by 6, but only 5 actions, so impossible to reach y9=9 with 5 actions; min increase per action is 0, but to increase by 6, need at least 6 up actions.\n\nWith 5 actions, max y9 = y4 +5 =3+5=8 if all U, or less.\n\ny9 = y4 + sum of Δy from t=4 to 8, 5 terms, each +1,0,-1, so max y9=3+5=8, min 3-5=-2, but y>=0.\n\nSo y9 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nTo have y9=9, we need to start earlier or later.\n\ny_S =9 for S=9.\n\ny4=3.\n\nTo reach y9=9, we need 6 increases, but from t=4 to t=9, the actions that set y5 to y9 are at t=4 to t=8, 5 actions, setting 5 positions.\n\nThe position at turn 9, y9, is set by action at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y4 is given.\n\nSo from y4 to y9, it takes 5 steps: actions at t=4,5,6,7,8 determine y5,y6,y7,y8,y9.\n\ny9 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8\n\n5 changes.\n\ny4=3, y9=9, so Δy4 + ... + Δy8 =6.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so impossible with 5 terms; 5*1=5<6, so cannot reach y9=9 from y4=3 in 5 steps; need at least 6 steps.\n\nBut with 6 changes, we can set y10=9.\n\nFor example, actions at t=4 to t=9: a4 to a9, setting y5 to y10.\n\nThen y10=9.\n\nThen S = t1 + H -1 =4 + H -1, set to 10 for y10=9.\n\n4+H-1=10, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\ny_S =9, S=4+H-1.\n\nIf S=10, 4+H-1=10, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1=4+6=10? t=4 to t=10, but H=7 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nFor t1=4, a4 to a_{4+H-1}\n\nAfter these actions, position is y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{4 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if we want y9=9, then 4 + H -1 =9, so 3+H=9, H=6.\n\nBut with H=6, actions a4 to a9 (since t=0 to 5, a4 to a9), then y10 is set by a9, but y_{t1+H-1} =y_{4+5} =y9? t1+H-1=4+6-1=9, y9.\n\nBut to have y9=9, from y4=3, with actions a4 to a8 (5 actions) setting y5 to y9, we need sum of 5 Δy =6, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is off.\n\nLet's read the task carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nWith t1=4, so y_{3+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=6, y_{3+6} =y9=9.\n\nBut y9=9 means at turn 9, we are at y=9.\n\nFrom turn 4, y4=3, to turn 9, y9=9, that's 5 turns later, but 5 actions.\n\nActions at t=4,5,6,7,8 determine y5,y6,y7,y8,y9.\n\ny9 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8\n\n5 terms of Δy.\n\ny4=3, y9=9, so sum of 5 Δy =6.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so maximum sum is 5, if all U, y9=8.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nIf we include action at t=9, but the actions are up to a_{t1+H-1}, for H=6, a4 to a9, but a9 sets y10, not y9.\n\ny9 is set by a8.\n\nThe position at turn S is y_S, which is determined by actions before S.\n\nSpecifically, y_S = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1}^{S-1} Δy_t\n\nFor S = t1 + H -1.\n\ny_S =9.\n\ny_{t1} =3.\n\nNumber of terms in sum: from t=t1 to S-1.\n\nS = t1 + H -1, so S-1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nSo sum from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -2 of Δy_t = 9 - 3 =6.\n\nNumber of terms: from t=t1 to t1+H-2 inclusive, that's (t1+H-2) - t1 +1 = H-1 terms.\n\nSo we need sum of (H-1) terms of Δy, each in {-1,0,1}, to be 6.\n\nSince each <=1, we need at least 6 terms to sum to 6, so H-1 >=6, H>=7.\n\nThen with H=7, H-1=6 terms, can all be U, sum=6.\n\nThen S = t1 + H -1 =4+7-1=10, so y10=9.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=4+H-1=4+6=10? t=0 to H-1 for the index, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H=7, t=0 to 6, a4 to a10.\n\nBut a10 sets y11, but we don't care, since we reach y10=9 at turn 10.\n\nThe actions are a4 to a10, 7 actions, but a10 is after turn 10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 10, position y10, which is set by action at t=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, position is y_{t1+H}, but we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor H=7, y_{4+7-1}=y10=9, set by action at t=9.\n\nActions: a4 to a_{4+6} = a4 to a10.\n\na4 sets y5, a5 sets y6, ..., a9 sets y10, a10 sets y11.\n\nBut a10 is included, but it sets y11, which is after we reached y10=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a10, but since we reached at turn 10, we don't need to go further, but the action a10 might be specified, but it doesn't affect reaching y10=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, we can have a10, but since we are done at turn 10, it might be redundant, but we have to specify H actions.\n\nWith min H, we can stop when we reach, but since actions are specified, we can have a10=S or something.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should have exactly the actions needed.\n\nWith H=7, we can have y10=9.\n\nIf we reach earlier, better, but from y4=3 to y=9, min 6 increases, so min 6 actions, but with 6 actions, we can reach y10=9, as in the first sequence I thought.\n\ny10=9 with actions a4 to a9, 6 actions.\n\nThen for that, S = turn when at y=9 is 10.\n\ny_S=9, S=10.\n\nS = t1 + H -1 =4 + H -1.\n\nSet 4 + H -1 =10, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen actions from t=4 to t=4+6=10, a4 to a10.\n\nBut a4 to a10 is 7 actions, but a4 to a9 is 6 actions setting y5 to y10.\n\nWith a4 to a9: 6 actions, y5 to y10.\n\ny10=9.\n\nThen for S=10, y10=9.\n\nS = t1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =10, so 4 + H -1 =10, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen the sequence must include a10, but a10 sets y11, which is not needed.\n\nPerhaps we can have H such that t1+H-1=10 with H=7.\n\nBut the actions include a10, which is extra.\n\nTo avoid that, we can reach at turn 9, but as we saw, y9 cannot be 9 from y4=3.\n\nUnless we start from lower, but we start at 3.\n\nAnother way: perhaps at some point we move down, but that would require more actions, so for min H, we should go up directly if possible.\n\nSo min H=7 to reach y10=9.\n\nWith actions a4 to a9 all U, but we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous times for each y.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nFor each freeway, times when 0 is covered:\n\ny=1: never\n\ny=2: T=8,9\n\ny=3: T=8,9\n\ny=4: T=8,9\n\ny=5: T=6\n\ny=6: T=6\n\ny=7: T=6\n\ny=8: T=4\n\nT=4 for y=8.\n\nAt turn T, if player on y=k and T is dangerous for k.\n\nPlayer path with all U:\n\nt=4, y4=3, on y=3. Dangerous for y=3 at T=8,9, not at t=4, so safe.\n\nAction a4=U, so y5=4\n\nt=5, y5=4, on y=4. Dangerous for y=4 at T=8,9, not at t=5, safe.\n\nAction a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6, y6=5, on y=5. Dangerous for y=5 at T=6. Yes, t=6, so at turn 6, on y=5, and 0 covered, collision!\n\nOh, so cannot be on y=5 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at t=6, also dangerous.\n\nt=6, y6=5, but we are on y=5 at t=6, and for y=5, T=6 is dangerous, so collision.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2,3,4 at t=8 or 9.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=6, if we are on y=5,6, or7, collision.\n\nIn all U, at t=6, y6=5, on y=5, collision.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nPossible ways: at t=6, be not on y=5,6,7.\n\nOr be on y=5,6,7 but at a different time.\n\nSince we need to go up, we might need to wait or move down to avoid being on those rows at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's list all dangerous (y,T) pairs:\n\n- (y=5, T=6)\n\n- (y=6, T=6)\n\n- (y=7, T=6)\n\n- (y=2, T=8)\n\n- (y=2, T=9)\n\n- (y=3, T=8)\n\n- (y=3, T=9)\n\n- (y=4, T=8)\n\n- (y=4, T=9)\n\ny=8 at T=4, but at T=4, we are on y=3, not y=8, so not issue.\n\nNow, we start at t=4, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nWith min actions, H=7, reaching y10=9.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=9 (6 actions) to set y5 to y10.\n\nThen S=10 for y10=9.\n\nBut H=7 includes action at t=10? Let's define H properly.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nWe need to specify actions for turns t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nFor the path, let's consider the turns from t=4 onwards.\n\nPosition at each turn.\n\nWe need y_T for T from 4 to some point.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=6 on y=5,6,7.\n\nAt t=6, we should not be on y=5,6, or7.\n\nSo possible positions at t=6: y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\nBut we start from y=3 at t=4, and want to go to y=9.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=6, two actions: a4 and a5, setting y5 and y6.\n\ny4=3\n\nAfter a4, y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nAfter a5, y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nWe need y6 not in {5,6,7}\n\nSimilarly, later we need to avoid other dangerous points.\n\nFirst, min H: to reach y10=9, we need to go from y4=3 to y10=9 in 6 steps: actions a4 to a9.\n\nEach action U or S or D.\n\nTo increase by 6, we need at least 6 U, but we have 6 actions, so must all be U, no S or D, because S or D would require more U later.\n\nWith 6 actions, to increase from 3 to 9, we need exactly 6 U and 0 S or D, so y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nBut at t=6, y6=5, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot have this path; we need to deviate.\n\nTherefore, min H=7 is not sufficient with all U; we need more turns or different actions.\n\nWith H=7, we have 7 actions: a4 to a10, but a10 sets y11, and we reach y10=9 at turn 10.\n\nWith 7 actions, we can have 6 U and one S or D, but S or D would make us not reach y10=9 with 6 U, because with 7 actions, we can have y10 = y4 + sum_{t=4 to9} Δy_t\n\n6 terms, from t=4 to9, Δy for t=4 to9, setting y5 to y10.\n\ny10 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + ... + Δy9\n\n6 terms.\n\ny4=3, y10=9, so sum of 6 Δy =6, so all must be U, no S or D.\n\nThus y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nSame as before, and at t=6, y6=5, collision.\n\nSo with H=7, we must have this path if we reach at turn 10, but it has collision.\n\nWe can reach later, but with more turns, H larger, not minimal.\n\nMinimal H to reach y_S=9 for some S.\n\nWith fewer actions, but we need at least 6 up moves.\n\nThe earliest S is 10, with y10=9, requiring 6 actions from t=4 to t=9.\n\nBut with collision at t=6.\n\nSo we need to have a different position at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=6, be not on y=5.\n\nSo we need to adjust the actions before t=6.\n\nFor instance, at t=4 or t=5, do not go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut then we may need to go up later, but with min actions, we can't.\n\nLet's list the positions.\n\nt=4, y4=3, must be safe, which it is.\n\nAction a4: if U, y5=4; if S, y5=3; if D, y5=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y5, action a5, etc.\n\nWe need at t=6, y6 not in {5,6,7}.\n\nAlso, y6 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, from y4=3, after two actions, y6.\n\nPossible y6:\n\n- If a4=U, a5=U, y6=5\n\n- a4=U, a5=S, y6=4\n\n- a4=U, a5=D, y6=3\n\n- a4=S, a5=U, y6=4\n\n- a4=S, a5=S, y6=3\n\n- a4=S, a5=D, y6=2\n\n- a4=D, a5=U, y6=2? y4=3, a4=D, y5=2, a5=U, y6=3\n\n- a4=D, a5=S, y6=2\n\n- a4=D, a5=D, y6=1\n\nSo possible y6: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nWe need y6 not 5, so y6 can be 1,2,3,4.\n\nIf y6=4, for example.\n\nThen at t=6, y6=4, on y=4.\n\nDangerous for y=4 at T=8,9, not at t=6, so safe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y6=3, safe; y6=2, safe at t=6; y6=1, safe.\n\ny6=5 not safe, but we avoid it.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=9 by some turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid other dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's aim to reach y=9 with min delay.\n\nSuppose at t=6, y6=4 (for example, by a4=U, a5=S or a4=S, a5=U, etc.)\n\nThen y6=4.\n\nNow, from t=6, y6=4, to y=9, need 5 increases, so min at turn t=11, y11=9.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=10 to set y7 to y11.\n\n5 actions, all U, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions.\n\nAt t=8, y8=6? In this path, at t=8, y8=6.\n\nBut for y=6, dangerous at T=6, but t=8>6, so not dangerous? T=6 only, so at t=8, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 dangerous only at T=6, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 dangerous only at T=6, etc.\n\nBut at t=8, we have y=2,3,4 dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=6, y6=4, safe (since not dangerous time)\n\nAction a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7, y7=5, on y=5. Dangerous at T=6, t=7>6, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8, y8=6, on y=6. Dangerous only at T=6, not t=8, safe.\n\nBut y=6 is dangerous only at T=6, so at t=8 safe.\n\nNow, for y=2,3,4 dangerous at T=8,9, but we are on y=6 at t=8, not on y=2,3,4, so no issue.\n\nAction a8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y9=7, on y=7. Dangerous only at T=6, not t=9, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10, y10=8, on y=8. Dangerous for y=8 at T=4, t=10>4, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction a10=U, y11=9, reached.\n\nBut we reached at turn 11, with y11=9.\n\nThen S=11.\n\nS = t1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =11, so 4+H-1=11, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=4+H-1=4+7=11? t=0 to H-1, a4 to a_{4+7}=a11? Let's.\n\nH=8, actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to7, so a4 to a11.\n\nBut a11 sets y12, not needed.\n\ny11=9 set by a10.\n\nBut with actions a4 to a10, 7 actions, we can have y11=9? y4=3, actions a4 to a10: 7 actions, setting y5 to y11.\n\n7 terms, to increase from 3 to 9, sum Δy=6, so we can have 6 U and one S or D.\n\nIn the above, with a4=U (y5=4), a5=S (y6=4), then a6=U (y7=5), a7=U (y8=6), a8=U (y9=7), a9=U (y10=8), a10=U (y11=9).\n\nSo actions: a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nThen y11=9.\n\nS=11, t1+H-1=4+H-1=11, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nBut we have only 7 actions here? a4 to a10 is 7 actions.\n\na4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10: 7 actions.\n\ny set: y5 to y11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nS=11.\n\n4 + H -1 =11, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen the sequence should have 8 actions, from a4 to a11.\n\nBut a11 is extra; we can set a11=S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have a11, but it doesn't affect.\n\nBut to minimize H, perhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nEarlier with all U but collision, not possible.\n\nAnother option: at t=6, be on y=3 or 2 or 1.\n\nFor example, to have y6=3.\n\nThen from y6=3 to y=9, need 6 increases, min at t=12, y12=9.\n\nLater than before.\n\nSimilarly, y6=4 to y11=9 as above.\n\ny6=4 to y11=9 in 5 steps, with 5 U.\n\nBut in the path, with a5=S, we have one S, so one extra turn.\n\nBut we can avoid the dangerous times with fewer delays.\n\nNotice that the dangerous time for y=5,6,7 is only at t=6, so if we are not on those rows at t=6, we can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4 at t=8,9.\n\nIn the direct path with all U, problem is at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, if we are not on y=5,6,7, but we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y5=4 in all U, safe.\n\nAt t=6, if we do not go to y=5, but stay or down.\n\nBut then we need to go up later.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we should go up when possible.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly to y=8 or 9 before t=8,9 to avoid the y=2,3,4 danger.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 danger at t=6 is earlier.\n\nt=6 is turn 6.\n\nWe start at t=4.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=6, only two turns.\n\nTo be at y=8 or 9 at t=6, but from y=3, min y6=5 with two U, or less with down, but 8 or 9 impossible in two steps.\n\nMax y6=5.\n\nSo at t=6, we must be at y<=5, and we need to avoid y=5,6,7, so y<=4 at t=6.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut with the S at t=5, we reach y11=9.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go down at some point to be lower at t=6, but then need more up moves.\n\nFor example, at t=4, a4=D, y5=2\n\nThen at t=5, y5=2, safe.\n\nAction a5=U, y6=3\n\nt=6, y6=3, safe.\n\nThen from here, need to go to y=9, from y6=3 to y=9, 6 up moves, min at t=12, y12=9.\n\nWorse than previous.\n\nWith a4=S, a5=S, y6=3, same.\n\nOr a4=U, a5=D, y6=3, etc.\n\nBut with y6=4, we can reach y11=9.\n\nEarlier with all U we could reach y10=9 but with collision.\n\nNow, another dangerous time is at t=8 and 9 for y=2,3,4.\n\nIn the path with y6=4, then y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nAt t=8, y8=6, not on y=2,3,4, so safe.\n\nAt t=9, y9=7, not on y=2,3,4, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut we reach at turn 11.\n\nCan we reach at turn 10?\n\ny10=9.\n\nFrom y4=3 to y10=9, need sum of 6 Δy from t=4 to9 actions, setting y5 to y10.\n\n6 terms, sum=6, so all U.\n\nThen y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nAt t=6, y6=5, collision.\n\nUnless at t=6, we are not on y=5, but with all U, we are.\n\nSo impossible to have y10=9 without being on y=5 at t=6 if we go directly.\n\nTherefore, min S=11, with y11=9.\n\nThen H=8, since S=11=4+H-1, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions: for example, a4=U (y5=4), a5=S (y6=4), then a6=U (y7=5), a7=U (y8=6), a8=U (y9=7), a9=U (y10=8), a10=U (y11=9)\n\nThen we need a11 for the sequence? S=11, y11=9.\n\nActions: a4 to a10, 7 actions, but for H=8, we need 8 actions up to a11.\n\nSo we can add a11=S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, we must specify all actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nWith y11=9 at turn 11, and actions a4 to a10 to set it, but a10 sets y11, so we need actions up to a10 for that.\n\nFor H=8, actions up to a_{4+7}=a11.\n\nBut a11 sets y12, which is after.\n\nTo minimize, we can have the last action when we reach.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 11, with action at t=10, we can have actions from t=4 to t=10, 7 actions, but H=7 would imply S=4+7-1=10, y10=9, which is not possible, as we saw.\n\nSo we need S=11, H=8.\n\nWith H=8, actions a4 to a11.\n\nIn the sequence, a4 to a10 can be as above, and a11 can be anything, say S.\n\nBut let's confirm no collision in the path.\n\nPath:\n\nt=4: y4=3, safe (not dangerous time for y=3)\n\na4=U\n\nt=5: y5=4, on y=4. Dangerous at T=8,9, not t=5, safe.\n\na5=S (stay, so Δy=0)\n\nt=6: y6=4, on y=4. Still not dangerous time, safe.\n\na6=U\n\nt=7: y7=5, on y=5. Dangerous only at T=6, t=7>6, safe.\n\na7=U\n\nt=8: y8=6, on y=6. Dangerous at T=6 only, safe.\n\nAlso, at t=8, y=2,3,4 dangerous, but we on y=6, fine.\n\na8=U\n\nt=9: y9=7, on y=7. Dangerous only at T=6, safe.\n\nAlso, y=2,3,4 dangerous at t=9, but not on them.\n\na9=U\n\nt=10: y10=8, on y=8. Dangerous at T=4 only, safe.\n\na10=U\n\nt=11: y11=9, reached, no cars at y=9.\n\nNow, for H=8, we need actions up to t=4+7=11, so a11.\n\na11 can be S, for example.\n\nBut at t=11, we are already at y=9, so a11 can be S, and y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we specify a11.\n\nBut the minimal H should be with the actions needed.\n\nSince we must include up to a_{t1+H-1}, and for S=11, t1+H-1=11, so actions to a11.\n\nBut in terms of turns, we used actions from t=4 to t=10 to reach at t=11, so a11 is extra.\n\nBut we have to.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 10 with different path.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 quickly, but y=8 has danger at t=4, but we not on it.\n\nSuppose at t=4, a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5, a5=U, y6=5 but collision, so not.\n\na4=U, a5=D, y6=3\n\nThen at t=6, y6=3, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up: a6=U, y7=4\n\nt=7, y7=4, on y=4. Dangerous at T=8,9, not t=7, safe.\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\nt=8, y8=5, on y=5. Dangerous only at T=6, not t=8, safe.\n\nBut at t=8, for y=4, it is dangerous, but we are on y=5, not y=4.\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\nt=9, y9=6, on y=6.

Dangerous at T=8,9, not t=7, safe.\n\na7=U, y8=3\n\nt=8, y8=3, on y=3. But at t=8, for y=3, it is dangerous! T=8 is dangerous for y=3.\n\nCollision!\n\nBecause at t=8, y=3 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if y8=3, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=8, if on y=3, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be higher or lower at t=8.\n\nIn our first plan, with y6=4, then y7=5, y8=6, which is safe.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=6, then y7=2, and at t=8, if y8=3 or 4, collision, but we can go faster to higher y.\n\nFor example, from t=6, y6=1, a6=U, y7=2\n\na7=U, y8=3 but at t=8, y8=3 collision.\n\na7=S, y8=2, at t=8, y8=2, dangerous for y=2 at t=8, collision.\n\na7=D, y8=1, on y=1, safe, but then not progressing.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=8, we need to be not on y=2,3,4 at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, y8 should be <=1 or >=5.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nIn the case where we are low at t=6, it might be hard to be high at t=8.\n\nFor example, from y6=1, to be at y8>=5, need at least 4 up in two steps, impossible.\n\nMax y8= y6 +2 =3 if both U.\n\ny8=3, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we stay or down, lower.\n\nSo cannot be >=5 at t=8 from low start.\n\nThus, better to be higher earlier, like in the first plan.\n\nSo back to a4=U, a5=S, y6=4, then up to y11=9.\n\nWith actions: a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, and for H=8, a11=S.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output from turn t1=4.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn 4: a4\n\nTurn 5: a5\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 4+H-1.\n\nWith H=8, up to Turn 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, a11 is not necessary, but we have to include.\n\nTo save, but min H=8.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach with H=7 by reaching at turn 10 with different.\n\nSuppose at t=6, we are on y=4, as before, but then from y6=4 to y10=9 in 4 steps, impossible, max y10=8.\n\ny10= y6 +4 =4+4=8 with all U.\n\nThen y10=8, not 9.\n\nThen need another action to y11=9.\n\nSo must be at least turn 11.\n\nThus, minimal is S=11, H=8.\n\nNow, for the cars, we have y=8 at t=4 dangerous, but not issue.\n\nIn k=8, at t=4, there is a car at [-11,0], so 0 covered.\n\nBut we not on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=8 at t=10, which is safe.\n\nNow, sequence: actions from turn 4 to turn 11.\n\nBut turn 11 is t=11.\n\nt1=4.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: U  (a4=U)\n\nTurn 5: S  (a5=S)\n\nTurn 6: U  (a6=U)\n\nTurn 7: U  (a7=U)\n\nTurn 8: U  (a8=U)\n\nTurn 9: U  (a9=U)\n\nTurn 10: U  (a10=U)\n\nTurn 11: ?  (a11, but we reached at turn 11, so a11 can be S or anything, but since we need to specify, and action, say S)\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 11, we are already at y=9, so action S is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the output, we need only until we reach, but since the sequence must have H actions, we include.\n\nNow, but in the action, at turn 10, we go to y11=9? In the path, at turn 10, y10=8, action U to y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, y11=9, we can have action S.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  (for example)\n\nBut at turn 11, after action, y12=9 if S, but we are at y11=9 before action.\n\nThe position is at the turn, before action.\n\nAt turn 11, y11=9, then we take action a11, which can be S, so y12=9.\n\nBut we reached at turn 11.\n\nIn the output, it should be fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but we must have H actions.\n\nAnother thought: can we reach at turn 9? y9=9, but impossible from y4=3.\n\nMin y9=3-5=-2 or 3+5=8, so y9=8 max, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, turn 10, y10=9 impossible as established.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one S at turn 5.\n\nWe could have other variations, but this works.\n\nFor example, instead of S at turn 5, we could have D at some point, but it might take longer, not better.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 11, action is S, but we are already at y=9.\n\nTo make it consistent, we can have the last action as U or S, but since y=9, we can stay.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to specify after reaching, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nIn the car state, for y=5,6,7, only at t=6 dangerous, and we avoided by not being on them at t=6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this path, at t=6, we are on y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nAt t=7, y=5, safe; t=8, y=6, safe; etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the dangerous times when cars cover position 0 on specific freeways.\n\n### Dangerous Times for Each Freeway\n- \\(y = 1\\): Never dangerous.\n- \\(y = 2\\): Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- \\(y = 3\\): Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- \\(y = 4\\): Dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n- \\(y = 5\\): Dangerous at turn 6.\n- \\(y = 6\\): Dangerous at turn 6.\n- \\(y = 7\\): Dangerous at turn 6.\n- \\(y = 8\\): Dangerous at turn 4 (but player is not on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 4).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4. To reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns, the player must increase \\(y\\) by 6, requiring at least 6 \"up\" (U) actions. However, a direct path with all U actions (e.g., \\(y_4 = 3\\), \\(y_5 = 4\\), \\(y_6 = 5\\), \\(y_7 = 6\\), \\(y_8 = 7\\), \\(y_9 = 8\\), \\(y_{10} = 9\\)) results in a collision at turn 6 because \\(y_6 = 5\\) is on freeway \\(y = 5\\) at the dangerous time \\(T = 6\\).\n\nTo avoid this, a slight deviation is needed. By staying (S) at turn 5, the player remains at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6, avoiding the dangerous freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at \\(T = 6\\). Then, proceeding with U actions reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. This requires \\(H = 8\\) turns (actions from turn 4 to turn 11), with \\(y_{11} = 9\\) satisfying \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{4 + 8 - 1} = y_{11} = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- **Turn 4**: U (move up to \\(y_5 = 4\\))\n- **Turn 5**: S (stay at \\(y_6 = 4\\), avoiding \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at \\(T = 6\\))\n- **Turn 6**: U (move up to \\(y_7 = 5\\))\n- **Turn 7**: U (move up to \\(y_8 = 6\\))\n- **Turn 8**: U (move up to \\(y_9 = 7\\), avoiding \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\) since not on those freeways)\n- **Turn 9**: U (move up to \\(y_{10} = 8\\))\n- **Turn 10**: U (move up to \\(y_{11} = 9\\))\n- **Turn 11**: S (stay at \\(y_{12} = 9\\), but \\(y_{11} = 9\\) is already reached; this action is included to complete the \\(H = 8\\) actions)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turn 4: \\(y_4 = 3\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 4\\))\n- Turn 5: \\(y_5 = 4\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 5\\))\n- Turn 6: \\(y_6 = 4\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\))\n- Turn 7: \\(y_7 = 5\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 7\\))\n- Turn 8: \\(y_8 = 6\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 8\\); also avoids dangerous \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\))\n- Turn 9: \\(y_9 = 7\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 9\\); avoids dangerous \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\))\n- Turn 10: \\(y_{10} = 8\\) (safe, not dangerous for \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 10\\))\n- Turn 11: \\(y_{11} = 9\\) (reached target, no cars at \\(y = 9\\))\n\n\\(H = 8\\) is minimal because reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 (with \\(H = 7\\)) is impossible without collision or exceeding the position change constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 4) at turn t_1, which is turn 5. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (y unchanged). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. Each car is defined by its head, tail, direction, and speed. The car spans move left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nCollision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are still on y_T, and only check cars on y_T for collision. When they move, during the move, they don't occupy the new row until after the action.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=5. For future turns, we need to compute the span based on the time elapsed.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t_1=5:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, head is the right end, I think? From the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] → moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] → moves right, so τ increases? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, h and τ both decrease, so the car moves left.\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this notation, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h], with τ probably the left end and h the right end, since it moves right.\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so according to the update, for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] or something? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and τ + s dt, h + s dt.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: head -48, tail -59, direction right.\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -59, which is less than head, so tail is left, head is right? -59 is more negative, so smaller number, so left if we think x-axis increasing right.\n\nAssume x=0 is the point we care about, x increases to the right.\n\nSo for a car, tail is the left end, head is the right end, I think.\n\nFor freeway 1: tail -59, head -48, direction right. Since direction right, it should move right, so both coordinates increase.\n\nAt t_1=5, position: left end (tail) -59, right end (head) -48.\n\nAfter time dt, at T, left end = -59 + 3*(T-5), right end = -48 + 3*(T-5)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the update rule, for right-moving, it says Span(T) = [τ + s dt, h + s dt], and τ and h are from [τ,h] at t_1.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1, it's given as (head, tail) = (-48, -59), but in the span notation, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], so τ should be tail, h should be head? I think it's inconsistent.\n\nLook back at the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -59, which is smaller, so τ (left end) is tail = -59, h (right end) is head = -48.\n\nSo at T, span = [ -59 + 3*(T-5), -48 + 3*(T-5) ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but there are no left-moving cars here, all are right-moving except possibly, let's see.\n\nAll directions are \"right\" in this case.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8, all cars have direction right.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nSimilarly for 6 and 7.\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFor a car, with direction right, at t_1=5:\n\n- The left end is tail, right end is head.\n\nAt time T, left end = tail + s*(T-5)\n\nRight end = head + s*(T-5)\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at T, meaning min(left end, right end) ≤ 0 ≤ max(left end, right end), but since it's an interval, for right-moving, left end ≤ right end, so if left end <= 0 <= right end.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn 5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is above freeways, so no cars there, so once we reach y=9, we are safe, and we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe sequence ends when y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, so at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nt_1=5, so at turn 5 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nNow, since we start at y=4, to reach y=9, we need to move up 5 units, so minimum moves would be 5 up actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since we need to go up, down might not help, so probably minimal H is at least 5.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait sometimes.\n\nNow, the player position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, with delta based on action.\n\nBut at turn T, when we are at position, we are on freeway y_T, and we check if 0 is in any car span on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nNow, for the cars, we need to compute for each freeway and each car, when 0 is within the car's span.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns, T=5,6,7,...\n\nAlso, for a given freeway and car, we can find when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a right-moving car with tail t, head h, speed s at t_1=5.\n\nAt time T, left end = tail + s*(T-5)\n\nRight end = head + s*(T-5)\n\n0 is covered when left end <= 0 <= right end.\n\nSince left end <= right end.\n\nSo tail + s*(T-5) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-5)\n\nSimilarly, for multiple cars on a freeway, we need to check all.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when they cover x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: tail=-59, head=-48, speed=3\n\nLeft end at T: -59 + 3*(T-5)\n\nRight end: -48 + 3*(T-5)\n\n0 covered when:\n\n-59 + 3*(T-5) <= 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-5)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3(T-5) <= 0 => 3(T-5) <= 59 => T-5 <= 59/3 = 19.666, so T <= 24.666, so up to T=24\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3(T-5) => 48 <= 3(T-5) => 16 <= T-5 => T >= 21\n\nSo for T from 21 to 24 inclusive, 0 is covered on freeway 1.\n\nT=21: left end = -59 + 3(16) = -59 + 48 = -11 <=0, right end = -48 + 48 =0, so 0<=0, covered.\n\nT=22: left = -59 + 3(17)= -59+51=-8, right=-48+51=3, 0 in between.\n\nT=23: left=-59+54=-5, right=-48+54=6, 0 in.\n\nT=24: left=-59+57=-2, right=-48+57=9, 0 in.\n\nT=25: left=-59+60=1>0, right=-48+60=12>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, T=20: left=-59+3(15)= -59+45=-14<0, right=-48+45=-3<0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at T=21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-18,-29,right,6) similarly, tail=-29, head=-18, speed=6\n\nLeft end T: -29 +6(T-5)\n\nRight end: -18 +6(T-5)\n\n0 covered when:\n\n-29 +6(T-5) <=0 <= -18 +6(T-5)\n\nFirst: -29 +6(T-5) <=0 => 6(T-5) <=29 => T-5 <= 29/6≈4.833, T<=9.833, so T<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18 +6(T-5) => 18 <=6(T-5) => 3 <= T-5 => T>=8\n\nSo T from 8 to 9 inclusive? T=8: left= -29 +6(3)= -29+18=-11<=0, right= -18+18=0, covered.\n\nT=9: left= -29+24= -5, right= -18+24=6, covered.\n\nT=10: left= -29+30=1>0, not covered.\n\nT=7: left= -29+12= -17<0, right= -18+12= -6<0, not covered.\n\nt_1=5, T=5: left= -29 +6(0)= -29, right=-18, both <0\n\nT=6: left= -29+6(1)= -23, right=-12, both <0? -12<0 yes.\n\nT=6: T-5=1, left= -29+6= -23, right= -18+6= -12, both negative, 0 not covered.\n\nT=7: T-5=2, left= -29+12= -17, right= -18+12= -6, both <0.\n\nT=8: T-5=3, left= -29+18= -11, right= -18+18=0, covered.\n\nT=9: T-5=4, left= -29+24= -5, right= -18+24=6, covered.\n\nT=10: T-5=5, left= -29+30=1, right= -18+30=12, both >0, not covered.\n\nSo freeway 2 dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut T=8 and 9 are before current turn? Current turn is t_1=5, T=8 and 9 are future turns? Turns are global, I think.\n\nt_1=5 is current turn, so we care about turns from 5 onwards.\n\nT=8 and 9 are in future, so yes.\n\nBut freeway 2 at T=8 and 9 has collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-18,-29,right,6), so same as above, dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nThe table says freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,6) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-18,-29,right,6), same.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12) tail=-23, head=-12, speed=12\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12) but (head, tail) = (60,49), tail=49, head=60? Since right-moving, tail is left, head right.\n\nBut 49 to 60, both positive.\n\nAt T, for first car: left end = -23 +12(T-5), right end = -12 +12(T-5)\n\n0 covered when -23 +12(T-5) <=0 <= -12 +12(T-5)\n\nFirst: -23 +12(T-5) <=0 => 12(T-5) <=23 => T-5 <=23/12≈1.916, T<=6.916, so T<=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +12(T-5) => 12 <=12(T-5) => 1 <= T-5 => T>=6\n\nT>=6 and T<=6, so only T=6.\n\nT=6: left= -23 +12(1)= -11 <=0, right= -12+12=0, covered.\n\nT=5: left= -23 +0= -23<0, right=-12<0, not covered.\n\nT=7: left= -23+24=1>0, not covered.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (60,49,right,12) tail=49, head=60\n\nLeft end: 49 +12(T-5)\n\nRight end: 60 +12(T-5)\n\nSince both positive and increasing, for T>=5, left end >=49>0, so 0 never covered, since min is 49 at T=5.\n\nSo only first car matters, dangerous only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, dangerous only at T=6 for the first car.\n\nFreeway 7: same, dangerous at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) so tail=1, head=12, speed=12\n\nLeft end at T: 1 +12(T-5)\n\nRight end: 12 +12(T-5)\n\n0 covered when 1 +12(T-5) <=0 <=12 +12(T-5)\n\nBut left end: at T=5, 1 +0=1>0, and increases, so always >0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, second car (60,49,right,12) left end 49>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 8 never has collision at x=0.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=21,22,23,24\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=8,9\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=6\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=6\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=6\n\n- y=8: never dangerous\n\nPlayer starts at turn 5, y=4.\n\nAt turn 5, y=4, is it dangerous? y=4 is freeway 4, dangerous at T=8,9, not at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, for y=4: freeway 4 has car with tail=-29, head=-18 at T=5, both negative, so 0 not covered. So safe at T=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, the path: from y=4 to y=9, we need to go up 5 units.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, S stays, D decreases.\n\nSince we need to go up, D might not be useful, but we might need to wait or avoid certain rows at certain times.\n\nThe dangerous times:\n\n- For rows y=5,6,7: dangerous only at T=6\n\n- For rows y=2,3,4: dangerous at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=1 dangerous at T=21-24, which is far, and we might not go there.\n\n- y=8 always safe.\n\nWe start at y=4 at T=5.\n\nWe need to be careful not to be on a dangerous row at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At T=6, y=5,6,7 are dangerous. So we should not be on y=5,6, or 7 at turn T=6.\n\n- At T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are dangerous. So not on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\ny=4 is dangerous at T=8,9, but at T=5, we are on y=4, which is safe since T=5 not dangerous for y=4.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from y=4 at T=5, to y=5 at T=6, but at T=6, y=5 is dangerous! So if we go up to y=5 at T=6, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=4 at T=6, but y=4 is safe at T=6? y=4 dangerous only at T=8,9, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, for y=4: freeway 4 has car with tail=-29, head=-18, speed=6.\n\nAt T=6, T-5=1, left end = -29 +6(1)= -23, right end= -18+6= -12, both negative, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=6: freeway 3 same, left -23, right -12, safe.\n\ny=2 same.\n\ny=1 at T=6: freeway 1, left -59+3(1)= -56, right -48+3= -45, both neg, safe.\n\ny=5 at T=6: dangerous, as we saw.\n\nSo at T=6, we should avoid y=5,6,7.\n\nWe can be on y=4,3,2,1,8,9 but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=8 is safe.\n\nNow, at turn T=5, we are at y=4.\n\nWe choose action for turn T=5, which determines y at T=6.\n\nIf we go up (U), at T=6, y=5, but dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we stay (S), at T=6, y=4, which is safe.\n\nIf we go down (D), to y=3 at T=6, also safe.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient, since we need to go up later.\n\nSo probably stay or go up, but go up causes collision, so at T=5, we should not go up; we should stay or go down.\n\nBut to minimize turns, going down might add extra moves.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nAfter T=6, the danger at T=6 is passed.\n\nThen at T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are dangerous.\n\nNow, let's plan the moves.\n\nStart: turn 5, y=4\n\nAt turn 5, we need to choose a_{t_1} = a_5.\n\nIf we choose U, y_6 = 5, but at T=6, y=5 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo cannot choose U.\n\nIf we choose S, y_6 =4, safe.\n\nIf we choose D, y_6=3, safe.\n\nBut D might not be good.\n\nSo probably choose S at T=5, so stay at y=4 for T=6.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are future turns.\n\nCurrent turn T=6, after action at T=5.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn T: we are at y_T, and we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and check collision at that turn.\n\nFor turn T=5: we are at y=4, and since safe, no collision.\n\nWe choose a_5.\n\nIf a_5 = S, then at T=6, y=4.\n\nIf a_5 = D, then at T=6, y=3.\n\nBoth safe at T=6 for those rows.\n\nBut to go up, S might be better.\n\nIf we choose a_5 = S, then at T=6, y=4.\n\nNow at T=6, we need to choose a_6.\n\nWe can go U, to y=7 at T=7? Action at T=6 determines y_{7}.\n\nIf a_6 = U, then y_7 = y_6 +1 = 5? y_6=4, U to 5.\n\nBut at T=7, we are on y=5, which is safe? y=5 dangerous only at T=6, not at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, for y=5: freeway 5, first car at T=7: left end = -23 +12(7-5) = -23 +24=1, right end= -12+24=12, both >0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 at T=7: similarly, for y=6 car at T=7: left -23+24=1>0, safe; y=7 same.\n\ny=4 at T=7: freeway 4, at T=7, T-5=2, left= -29+12= -17, right= -18+12= -6, both <0, safe.\n\nBut at T=8, y=4 dangerous.\n\nBack to T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=4 (if we stayed).\n\nWe can choose a_6.\n\nOptions: U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nD to y=3 at T=7.\n\nS to y=4 at T=7.\n\nNow, at T=7, all rows are safe except possibly, but from above, at T=7, no danger for any row, since:\n\n- y=1: T=7, left -59+3(2)= -59+6= -53<0, right -48+6= -42<0, safe\n\n- y=2,3,4: at T=7, for y=4: left -29+12= -17<0, right -18+12= -6<0, safe; similarly y=2,3.\n\n- y=5,6,7: at T=7, as above, left ends >0, safe\n\n- y=8 safe\n\nSo T=7 is safe for all rows.\n\nThen at T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 dangerous.\n\nWe need to not be on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are turns where we must avoid those rows.\n\nNow, we are at T=6, y=4.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at T=7, by choosing a_6=U.\n\nThen at T=7, y=5, safe.\n\nThen we can go up again to y=6 at T=8? But at T=8, if we are on y=6, which is safe? y=6 dangerous only at T=6, not at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6: freeway 6, first car left -23 +12(8-5)= -23+36=13>0, right -12+36=24>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 safe.\n\nBut y=4 at T=8 dangerous.\n\nBut if we are at y=5 at T=7, we can go U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nStart T=5, y=4\n\na_5: since U causes collision at T=6, we choose S (or D, but S better)\n\nAssume a_5 = S, then at T=6, y=4\n\nNow a_6: choose U, then y_7 =5\n\nAt T=7, y=5, safe\n\na_7: choose U, then y_8 =6\n\nAt T=8, y=6, safe (since y=6 not dangerous at T=8)\n\na_8: choose U, then y_9 =7\n\nAt T=9, y=7, safe? y=7 at T=9: freeway 7, first car left -23 +12(4)= -23+48=25>0, safe.\n\nThen a_9: choose U, then y_10 =8\n\nAt T=10, y=8, safe\n\nThen a_10: U to y_11=9\n\nAt T=11, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn, here at T=11, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 6 actions: from T=5 to T=10, actions at T=5,6,7,8,9,10, and at T=11 we are at y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, t_1=5, so 5 + H -1 =11, so H-1=6, H=7 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe player position: at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we move to position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nGenerally, after action at turn t, we are at turn t+1 position.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter these H actions, we have done H steps, so we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? No.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, we are at position.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, we go to turn t_1 +1 position.\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1+1}, to turn t_1+2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + k is after k actions.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9, meaning at turn t_1 + H -1, position y=9.\n\nThis is after (H-1) actions from turn t_1.\n\nBecause: start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t_1}), at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn t_1 + m.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + m, we have taken m actions.\n\nSet t_1 + m = t_1 + H -1, so m = H-1, meaning we take H-1 actions to reach turn t_1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nThen the number of actions is H-1, but H is the number of turns? The minimal number of turns H, I think H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so the turn index when we reach y=9 is t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe number of turns elapsed is (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 = H-1 turns? Confusion.\n\nPerhaps H is defined as the number of actions.\n\nFrom the answer format, it shows actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + something.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}, that's H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, we are at turn (t_1 + H) position? After a_{t_1 + H -1}, we move to turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is before the last action? Inconsistency.\n\nI think I misread.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we don't necessarily take an action at that turn if it's the end.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, but at turn t_1 + H -1, we take an action that might move us, but since we are already at y=9, the action could be S, or we reach at that turn.\n\nStandard: at turn T, we are at position, then we choose action a_T, which determines the next position at T+1.\n\nBut for the turn when we are at y=9, it could be that at some turn T, we are at y=9, and we don't need to act after that.\n\nIn this case, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -2? Let's think.\n\nSuppose we start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAt turn t_1, we choose a_{t_1}, which affects position at turn t_1+1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1+1, choose a_{t_1+1}, to position at t_1+2, and so on.\n\nIf at some turn T, we are at y=9, then we have reached.\n\nThe actions are chosen up to the turn before we reach, or including when we reach.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T, then the last action was at turn T-1 or at turn T?\n\nAt turn T, if we are at y=9, we might choose no action, but in the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...,H-1, so actions at turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking action at turn t_1 + H -1, we move to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position before taking the action at that turn? Confusion.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd the position y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H -1, since we are at y=9, the action a_{t_1 + H -1} could be S to stay, or U or D, but if we U or D, we might move away, but we want to reach and perhaps stay, but the condition is to be at (0,9) at that turn, so the action at that turn should be such that we stay or something, but after action, we move to next position.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nDenote:\n\n- At the beginning of turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\n- Then we choose action a_T.\n\n- Then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta based on a_T.\n\n- At turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check collision for cars at turn T.\n\nFor the sequence, we take actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + K for some K, such that at some turn M, y_M =9.\n\nBut the problem specifies that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, action at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking action at turn t_1 + H -1, we move to position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, so before taking the action at that turn.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen, we choose action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which may move us to y_{t_1 + H}, but since we have reached at turn t_1 + H -1, the action at that turn might be irrelevant or we can choose S to stay, but the position is already 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we include the action at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=9 at turn T, we can choose a_T = S to stay at y=9 for the next turn, but since we only care about reaching at that turn, it's fine.\n\nIn this case, for the last action, if we are at y=9, we can choose S, U, or D, but U or D would move us away, so to be safe, we should choose S, but the condition is only to reach at that turn, so even if we choose U or D, we were at y=9 at that turn, so it's ok, but for the next turn, we might not be at 9, but since we stop after reaching, it might not matter. However, in the collision check, at turn T when we are at y=9, there are no cars, so safe, and action doesn't affect collision at that turn.\n\nBut to be consistent, we can choose S at the turn we reach.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIn my earlier plan, with a_5 = S, then at T=6, y=4.\n\nThen a_6 = U, to y=5 at T=7.\n\nT=7, y=5.\n\na_7 = U, to y=6 at T=8.\n\nT=8, y=6, safe.\n\na_8 = U, to y=7 at T=9.\n\nT=9, y=7, safe.\n\na_9 = U, to y=8 at T=10.\n\nT=10, y=8.\n\na_10 = U, to y=11? y=9 at T=11.\n\ny_{11} =9.\n\nBut we are at turn T=11 with y=9.\n\nt_1=5, so t_1 + H -1 =11, so 5 + H -1 =11, thus H-1=6, H=7.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, and we have actions from t=0 to H-1, so 7 actions? H actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 is H values.\n\nIn this case, actions at turn 5 to turn 10, that's turns 5,6,7,8,9,10, 6 actions.\n\nAfter 6 actions, we are at turn 11 position.\n\ny_{11} =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 11, so 4 + H =11, H=7.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =5+7-1=11, yes.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=6, so actions at turn 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 6 actions.\n\nBut in terms of turns, from turn 5 to turn 10, we take actions, and at turn 11 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =11.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nWe start at y=4 at T=5.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 5 up moves, but we might have to wait.\n\nIn this sequence, we used 6 actions, but some are stay or down, here we have one stay at T=5, and then up all the way, so we reached in 6 actions to turn 11.\n\nBut the stay at T=5 was necessary to avoid collision at T=6.\n\nIf we go down at T=5, we might be able to go up faster? But going down seems worse.\n\nFor example, if at T=5, we choose D, then y_6=3 at T=6.\n\nT=6, y=3, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at T=6, we can go U to y=4 at T=7.\n\nThen U to y=5 at T=8, but at T=8, y=5 is safe, but y=4 is dangerous at T=8, but we are not on y=4 at T=8.\n\nAt T=7, y=4, then a_7=U to y=5 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=5, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen continue U to y=6 at T=9, y=7 at T=10, y=8 at T=11, y=9 at T=12. Later than before.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=6, we could go U to y=4 at T=7, then need to avoid T=8 on y=4.\n\nBut in the first plan, we avoided y=5 at T=6 by staying at y=4.\n\nAt T=6, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, we could go to y=8 directly or something.\n\ny=8 is always safe.\n\nBut we need to go through the rows.\n\nAnother idea: at T=5, since y=4 is safe at T=5 and T=6, but at T=6, we can go up to y=5, but y=5 is dangerous at T=6, so we cannot go to y=5 at T=6.\n\nAt T=5, if we go U, we are at y=5 at T=6, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=5 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=6 or7 at T=6.\n\nSo at T=6, we must be on y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\ny=0 or9 might be possible, but y=0 is below, we need to go up.\n\ny=4 is safe at T=6, as we are.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we need to not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nIn our sequence, at T=8, we are at y=6, not 2,3,4.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, not 2,3,4.\n\nGood.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 by T=10 or something.\n\nStart T=5, y=4.\n\nIf we could go directly, but we need 5 up moves.\n\nIf no cars, we could go U at T=5 to y=5 at T=6, but collision, so we must delay the up move.\n\nIn our sequence, we delayed the first up to T=6 action.\n\nAt T=5, we choose S, so at T=6, still y=4.\n\nThen at T=6, we choose U, so at T=7, y=5.\n\nThen U at T=7, to y=6 at T=8.\n\nU at T=8, to y=7 at T=9.\n\nU at T=9, to y=8 at T=10.\n\nU at T=10, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo y=9 at T=11.\n\nActions: T=5: S, T=6: U, T=7: U, T=8: U, T=9: U, T=10: U.\n\n6 actions, H=7 turns? t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1 =11, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps up, but we have to spend one turn waiting at start to avoid T=6.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the wait?\n\nPerhaps go to a different row.\n\nFor example, at T=5, go down to y=3? Then at T=6, y=3, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up, but y=3 at T=6, then at T=7, go to y=4, then at T=8, if on y=4, dangerous at T=8.\n\nT=8 is later.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, we can go U to y=4 at T=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=4.\n\nNow, at T=8, if we are on y=4, dangerous.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=4 at T=8.\n\nSo at T=7, we should go up to y=5 or something.\n\na_7: if U, to y=5 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=5, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at T=8, same as before but started lower.\n\nSequence: T=5: D, y=3 at T=6? At T=5, action D, so y_6 = y_5 -1 =4-1=3.\n\nAt T=6, y=3.\n\nThen a_6: U, y_7=4\n\nAt T=7, y=4.\n\na_7: U, y_8=5\n\nAt T=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_8: U, y_9=6\n\na_9: U, y10=7\n\na10: U, y11=8\n\na11: U, y12=9\n\nReached at T=12, later than T=11.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt T=7, y=4, we could go directly to higher y, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 quickly, since it's safe.\n\nBut from y=4, to y=8, need 4 up moves.\n\nBut at T=6, we cannot be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSo we need to skip those rows at T=6.\n\nFor example, at T=5, if we go to y=4 or less, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, we are at y=4 (if S), then we can go U to y=5 at T=7, as before.\n\nBut y=5 at T=7 is safe.\n\nWe cannot reach y=8 faster because of the constraint at T=6.\n\nPerhaps at T=5, go to y=3 or something, but no benefit.\n\nSo the first plan seems best: wait at y=4 for T=6 by choosing S at T=5, then go up each turn to reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from T=5 to T=10.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we need to make sure we are not on dangerous rows, which we are not.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=8, we are at y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 dangerous at T=8,9, but we are above.\n\nNow, but we have y=1 dangerous at T=21-24, but since we are going up, we won't be there, so no issue.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have one S and five U, total six actions.\n\nH=7, since t_1 + H -1=11, t_1=5, so 5+H-1=11, H=7.\n\nActions for t=0 to 6? t from 0 to H-1=6, so 7 actions? H-1=6 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, so index.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier if we go to y=9 faster, but we can't because of the T=6 blockage.\n\nAnother thought: at T=5, we go U, but to avoid collision at T=6 on y=5, we cannot.\n\nUnless we are not on y=5 at T=6, but if we go U at T=5, we must be at y=5 at T=6.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at T=6 by moving multiple, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at T=6 from y=4.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9 is from y=4, need 5 up moves, but we have to start moving after T=6 or something.\n\nIn terms of turns, the earliest we can be at y=5 is T=7, by going U at T=6 from y=4.\n\nThen y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9, y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nWe could go from y=7 to y=9 directly? No, only +1 per action.\n\nUnless we do U multiple times, but each U only +1.\n\nSo cannot skip.\n\nThus, minimal to reach y=9 from y=4 is 5 up actions, but we need to insert a wait because we cannot be on y=5,6,7 at T=6.\n\nSo we have one extra turn with S or D, but S is better.\n\nThus, 6 actions to move from y=4 to y=9 with one wait.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: T=5: S (to stay at y=4 for T=6)\n\nThen T=6: U (to y=5 at T=7)\n\nT=7: U (to y=6 at T=8)\n\nT=8: U (to y=7 at T=9)\n\nT=9: U (to y=8 at T=10)\n\nT=10: U (to y=9 at T=11)\n\nAnd at T=11, y=9.\n\nNow, for the action at T=10, we go to y=9 at T=11, but at T=10, we are at y=8, and we choose U to go to y=9.\n\nBut at T=10, position is y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=9, we go to y=8 at T=10, etc.\n\nBut we have T=8 and T=9: at T=8, we are at y=6, which is fine, and we go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, but is there a problem at T=8 or T=9?\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=9, y=7 safe.\n\nAnd we avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 8, it has cars, but we saw that freeway 8 never has collision at x=0, so safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have six actions: T=5 to T=10.\n\nH=7, actions from t=0 to H-1=6, so turns 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1+5} = U\n\nt_1=5, so:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter action at turn 10, we go to turn 11 with y=9.\n\nAnd y_{11} =9, which is t_1 + H -1 =5 +7 -1=11, yes.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nPerhaps we can reach by T=10.\n\ny=9 at T=10.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =10, so 5 + H -1=10, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 5, turns 5 to 10? t=0 to H-1=5, actions at 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter these, at turn 10 position.\n\nSet y_{10} =9.\n\nBut we start at y_5=4.\n\nTo reach y_{10}=9, we need to increase by 5 in 5 turns? From turn 5 to turn 10, there are 5 actions: at T=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nStart y_5=4, after 5 actions, y_{10} = y_5 + sum of delta from t=5 to9.\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, need sum delta = +5.\n\nSo must have 5 U and 0 S or D, so all actions U.\n\nThen y_6 = y_5 +1 =5\n\nBut at T=6, y=5, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nThus impossible to reach by T=10.\n\nSimilarly, to reach earlier not possible.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nBut H=7, y at turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions.\n\nBut in the action list, for turn 10, we have action U, which is fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, we have cars, but at the times we are on them, it should be safe.\n\nFor example, at T=7, we are on y=5, which is safe, as computed.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, but at x=0, never covered, so safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at T=9, we are at y=7, and we go U to y=8 at T=10.\n\ny=8 at T=10 is safe.\n\nBut is there any other danger?\n\nFor example, at T=9, y=7, but y=7 dangerous only at T=6, not at T=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe could consider going to y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, after T=6, we are at y=4.\n\nInstead of going to y=5, we could go directly to y=8, but cannot, only step by step.\n\nAt T=6, from y=4, we could go U to y=5 at T=7, or S, or D, but U is better.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=8, etc.\n\nIf at T=6, we go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps from y=4 at T=6, we go U to y=5 at T=7, then U to y=6 at T=8, then to y=7 at T=9, then to y=8 at T=10, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut we can from y=7 go to y=8 or something.\n\nBut still same.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is always safe, we could go to y=8 and stay, but we need to reach y=9, so no.\n\nBut in this case, we are going up.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 by T=10 if we start from different point, but no.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have a_5=S, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U.\n\nBut a_10 is for turn 10, to go to y=11? No.\n\nAction at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we choose action, which sets y_{11}.\n\nBut we want y_{10} to be 9? No, in this case, at turn 10, we are at y=8 (from previous), then we choose U to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut y_{10} is 8, not 9.\n\nWe reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions, at turn 10, y=8, we choose U, so to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut if we want to be at y=9 at turn 10, we need to arrive earlier.\n\nBut impossible, as we saw.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 10 by different path.\n\nFor example, start at T=5, y=4.\n\nIf we go U at T=5, but collision at T=6.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo S at T=5, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen at T=6, instead of U, we could go U to y=5 at T=7, same.\n\nNo other choices.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed for minimal H.\n\nBut we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the answer, for turn t_1=5, to turn t_1 + H -1 =5+7-1=11, but actions up to turn 10.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11 is the turn we reach, not an action turn necessarily.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 2? No.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H=7, t=0 to 6, actions at turn 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9.\n\nIn the actions, for turn 10, we have a_{10}=U, which moves to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, but in the list, we need to write the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, it has cars at (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12), both with positive positions, moving right, so x=0 never covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the initial car state, for freeway 8, it says (12,1,right,12), tail=1, head=12, so at T=5, span [1,12], moving right, so for T>5, span [1+12dt, 12+12dt], always min>1>0, so yes.\n\nNow, but the player is at (0,y), so x=0.\n\nNow, another thing: the collision is only if on the freeway and 0 in span.\n\nFor y=9, no freeway, so always safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we have one S and five U.\n\nBut is there a way with only five actions? But that would require reaching by T=10, impossible as above.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut t_1=5, so:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 +5} = U? t_1 +5 =10.\n\nH=7, t from 0 to 6, so t_1 + t for t=0 to 6: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSo turn t_1 + 0 to t_1 + 6? t=0: t_1 +0=5, t=1:6, ..., t=6: t_1 +6=11.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=6, so t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, actions at turn 5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut at turn 11, if we have action, but at turn 11, we are at y=9, and we might not need to act, but in the sequence, we include up to turn t_1 + H -1? Confusion.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =5+7-1=11.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=0 to 6, turns 5 to 10? t_1 + t for t=0:5, t=1:6, t=2:7, t=3:8, t=4:9, t=5:10, t=6:11? t from 0 to 6, that's 7 values, but H-1=6? H=7, H-1=6, so t from 0 to 5? Inconsistency.\n\nI think I have a problem.\n\nLet me define.\n\nSet K = H-1, the number of actions.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + K} =9? No.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, meaning the turn index difference.\n\nStart at turn t_1, end at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe number of actions is H-1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 ? Let's think.\n\nAt turn M, we take action a_M to go to position at M+1.\n\nWe want position at turn N to be y=9, where N = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns from t_1 to N-1, because at turn N-1, we take action to go to turn N.\n\nFor example, to be at turn N with y=9, we take actions at turn t_1 to N-1.\n\nThe number of actions is (N-1) - t_1 +1 = N - t_1.\n\nBut N = t_1 + H -1, so number of actions = (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 = H-1.\n\nAnd the turns for actions: from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-2}? Not matching the notation.\n\nThe problem says: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nFor example, t=0: a_{t_1}, t=1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, we move to position at (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, before taking the action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which may move us, but since we are already at y=9 at that turn, we can choose a_{t_1 + H -1} = S to stay, or whatever, but the position is achieved at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for our plan, at turn 11, we are at y=9.\n\nSo N =11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, t_1=5, so 5 + H -1=11, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to H-1=6, so t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6: actions at turn 5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut at turn 11, we are at y=9, and we need to specify a_{11}.\n\nSince we are at y=9, we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{11}=S.\n\nIn our earlier actions, we had up to a_{10}=U to go to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, we can have a_{11}=S.\n\nBut for the position, at turn 11, y=9, achieved.\n\nThen the action at turn 11 is not necessary, but we include it in the sequence up to t=6.\n\nIn the sequence with H=7, actions at turn 5 to 11.\n\nAt turn 5 to 10: as before, and at turn 11, a_{11}=S.\n\nBut at turn 11, since y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S (stay at y=4 for T=6)\n\nTurn 6: U (to y=5 at T=7)\n\nTurn 7: U (to y=6 at T=8)\n\nTurn 8: U (to y=7 at T=9)\n\nTurn 9: U (to y=8 at T=10)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=9 at T=11)\n\nThen at turn 11, we are at y=9, and we choose a_{11}=S to stay at y=9 for T=12, but since we only care up to turn 11, it's fine.\n\nIn the action list, we have seven actions, but the last one is at the turn we reach.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, we might not need the last S, but since H includes it, we have to.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but in this case, with six actions to turn 10, we go to y=9 at turn 11, and we need to include the action at turn 11.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nBut impossible, as before.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nIn the answer, for the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S  (for turn 5)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1} = U  (turn 6)\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1+2} = U  (turn 7)\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1+3} = U  (turn 8)\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{t_1+4} = U  (turn 9)\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1+5} = U  (turn 10)\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_{t_1+6} = S  (turn 11)\n\nt from 0 to 6, t_1 + t for t=0:5, t=1:6, ..., t=6:11.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd y at turn 11 is 9.\n\nNow, for the collision, at each turn, we need to ensure no collision.\n\nTurn 5: y=4, safe, as before.\n\nTurn 6: y=4, safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, for freeway 5, at T=7, left end -23 +12(2)= -23+24=1>0, not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=6, freeway 6, at T=8, T-5=3, left -23 +36=13>0, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7, T=9, T-5=4, left -23+48=25>0, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8, safe as always.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nAnd we avoided the dangerous times.\n\nSo this should be the minimal.\n\nBut in the action at turn 11, we put S, but it could be anything, but S is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: S\n\nBut t_1 + 6 =11, which is the turn we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 +6, action S.\n\nBut since we are at y=9, and we stay, fine.\n\nTo have exactly H-1 actions, but here H=7, 7 actions.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps we don't need the last action, but according to the notation, we include it.\n\nAnother way: if we can reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with the last action making us arrive, but in this case, at turn 10, we are at y=8, and action U to arrive at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, we are at y=9, and no action needed, but the sequence includes actions up to turn 10.\n\nIn the notation, for H=7, t from 0 to 6, includes turn 11 action.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nI think for the answer, we can proceed.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 8, it has two cars, but both safe.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, at turn 5, player at (0,4), no collision.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer, we write:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: S \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 2: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 3: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 4: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 5: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 6: S }\n\nBut t_1=5, but we use t_1 in the answer.\n\nIn the format, it should be with t_1.\n\nSince t_1 is given, we use it.\n\nIn the box, we write the actions with the turn labels.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player must move from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net increase of 5 units. Each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, so at least 5 \"U\" actions are needed.\n- Collisions occur if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n- Dangerous times for each freeway:\n  - \\(y = 1\\): dangerous at turns 21, 22, 23, 24 (but these are far in the future and avoidable).\n  - \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\): dangerous at turns 8 and 9.\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\): dangerous only at turn 6.\n  - \\(y = 8\\): never dangerous (cars never cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 5, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (no collision).\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) are dangerous, so the player must avoid these rows at turn 6. \\(y = 4\\) is safe at turn 6.\n- To minimize turns, the player should avoid unnecessary movements. Going down (\"D\") is inefficient since the goal is upward.\n\n### Strategy\n- **Turn 5 (\\(t_1\\))**: Choose \"S\" (stay) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 6, avoiding collision on \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at turn 6.\n- **Turn 6**: Choose \"U\" to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7. This avoids the danger at turn 6 and progresses upward.\n- **Turn 7**: Choose \"U\" to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8. All rows are safe at turn 7.\n- **Turn 8**: Choose \"U\" to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9. At turn 8, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (not dangerous).\n- **Turn 9**: Choose \"U\" to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10. At turn 9, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (not dangerous).\n- **Turn 10**: Choose \"U\" to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. At turn 10, \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n- **Turn 11**: The player is at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. Choose \"S\" to stay at \\(y = 9\\) (though any action is safe, \"S\" is optimal for stability).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 5 + 7 - 1 = 11\\), so \\(H = 7\\). The number of actions is 7, from turn 5 to turn 11.\n\n### Collision Check\n- **Turn 5 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y = 4\\) do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at turn 5).\n- **Turn 6 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y = 4\\) do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at turn 6).\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y = 5\\) do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at turn 7).\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y = 6\\) do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at turn 8).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y = 7\\) do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at turn 9).\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Safe (cars on \\(y = 8\\) never cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 11 (\\(y = 9\\))**: Safe (no freeway at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\n### Minimal Turns\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 (i.e., \\(H = 6\\)) would require 5 \"U\" actions starting from turn 5. However, moving to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6 causes a collision (since \\(y = 5\\) is dangerous at turn 6). Thus, \\(H = 6\\) is impossible, and \\(H = 7\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 6\\) (i.e., turns 5 to 11) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: \\text{ S} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t1=7 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new row, they're not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on row y, and only on row y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=7, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway at t1=7:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -42, tail -53, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe car update says for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nI think I need to interpret the head and tail properly.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and it's moving right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But τ is tail, h is head, so if it's right-moving, the tail is at the left, head at the right, so span is from τ to h, with τ < h.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: h = -42, τ = -53, so since -53 < -42, and direction right, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-53, -42].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor right-moving cars: at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince both increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, both decrease by s per turn.\n\nIn this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: right, speed 3\n\nFreeway 2: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 3: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 4: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 5: two cars, both right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 6: two cars, both right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 7: two cars, both right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 8: two cars, both right, both speed 12? (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nAll are right-moving, so I don't need to worry about left-moving for now.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at turn t1=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and it's above, I probably need to move up most of the time.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on rows 1 to 8 when I'm on that row at a turn.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe span includes the position, so if 0 is between τ and h inclusive at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when 0 is in the car's span, so that I should not be on that row at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move, their positions change over time.\n\nLet t be the number of turns after t1, so at turn t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0, it's turn t1=7.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t1 + t, y_{t1+t}\n\nI need y_{t1+H-1} = 9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, without cars, from y=5 to y=9, I need at least 4 up moves, so H >=4, but with cars, it might take more if I have to wait.\n\nBut I can also move down or stay to avoid, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, but staying could help to avoid a collision.\n\nNow, let's compute for each row, when it is occupied, meaning when 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, the span at time T = t1 + t = 7 + t.\n\nSince t1=7.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1, so at time T, Δt = t.\n\nThen for a right-moving car with initial τ, h, s, the span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nNow, collision if player is on row k at turn T, and for that k, there exists a car with 0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSince the car is on freeway k, and we care about position x=0.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find the times when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nThen, I should avoid being on that row at those times.\n\nBut since multiple cars per row, I need the union of occupied times per row.\n\nAlso, for rows with no cars, it's always safe, but here all rows 1-8 have cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ = -53, h = -42, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan at time T: [τ + s (T-7), h + s (T-7)] = [-53 + 3Δt, -42 + 3Δt] where Δt = T - 7.\n\n0 is in this span if -53 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 3Δt\n\nSolve for Δt:\n\n-53 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 53 => Δt <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so Δt <= 17 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -42 + 3Δt => 42 <= 3Δt => Δt >= 14.\n\nSo for Δt from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nAt Δt=14: -53 + 3*14 = -53 + 42 = -11, -42 + 42 = 0, so [ -11, 0], yes 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=15: -53+45= -8, -42+45=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=16: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=17: -53+51= -2, -42+51=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=18: -53+54=1, -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in since 0<1\n\nΔt=13: -53+39= -14, -42+39= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when Δt =14,15,16,17.\n\nThat is, turns T=7+14=21, 22,23,24.\n\nT=7+Δt, so at T=21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: τ=-6, h=-17? Head and tail.\n\nGiven: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nτ = -17? Tail is -17, head is -6?\n\nThe pair is (head, tail), so h = -6, τ = -17.\n\nSince direction right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nAt time T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-17 + 6 Δt, -6 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -17 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -6 + 6Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -17 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 17 => Δt <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so Δt <= 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 + 6Δt => 6 <= 6Δt => Δt >= 1\n\nSo Δt=1 or 2.\n\nAt Δt=1: -17+6= -11, -6+6=0, [ -11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔt=2: -17+12= -5, -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=0: -17+0= -17, -6+0= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔt=3: -17+18=1, -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo occupied at Δt=1,2, i.e., T=7+1=8, 7+2=9.\n\nT=8 and 9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-6, -17, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same occupied times: T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-6, -17, right, 6), same, T=8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (12, 1, right, 12) so h=12, τ=1, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12 Δt, 12 + 12 Δt] = [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 12Δt\n\nBut 1 + 12Δt <=0? Since 12Δt >=0 for Δt>=0, 1+12Δt >=1 >0, so left inequality false. 0 <= 12+12Δt always true for Δt>=0, but since min is 1>0, 0 not in [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt] for any Δt, because the span starts at at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47? (head, tail) so head is -36, tail is -47.\n\nDirection right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [-47 + 12 Δt, -36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -47 + 12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 12Δt => 36 <= 12Δt => Δt >= 3\n\nSo Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3: -47 + 36 = -11, -36 + 36 =0, [ -11, 0], 0 in\n\nΔt=2: -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nΔt=4: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 5, first car never covers 0, second car covers at Δt=3, T=7+3=10.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) same, covers at Δt=3, T=10.\n\nSo freeway 6 occupied only at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: identical, occupied at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst: (36,25,right,12) h=36, τ=25, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T: [25 + 12 Δt, 36 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span? 25 + 12Δt <=0? Impossible since min 25>0, so never.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) same as before, covers at Δt=3, T=10.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at T=10 only from second car.\n\nNow, summarize for each row the occupied times (turns T):\n\n- Row 1: occupied T=21,22,23,24\n\n- Row 2: occupied T=8,9\n\n- Row 3: occupied T=8,9\n\n- Row 4: occupied T=8,9\n\n- Row 5: occupied T=10\n\n- Row 6: occupied T=10\n\n- Row 7: occupied T=10\n\n- Row 8: occupied T=10\n\nRow 5,6,7,8 all occupied only at T=10.\n\nRow 2,3,4 occupied at T=8,9.\n\nRow 1 occupied later at T=21-24, but since we start from T=7, and we want to reach y=9 quickly, probably we don't care about later times if we can go early.\n\nPlayer starts at T=7, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is between y=5 to y=9, rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut row 5 is occupied at T=10, etc.\n\nNow, at turn T, player is at y_T, and we need to avoid being on row k at T if k is occupied at T.\n\nSince we start at T=7, y=5.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to move from y=5 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 4 turns if I go up all the time.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nFirst, list the occupied times:\n\nFor row 5: unsafe at T=10\n\nRow 6: unsafe at T=10\n\nRow 7: unsafe at T=10\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=10\n\nAll rows 5-8 are unsafe only at T=10.\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nFor rows 2,3,4, unsafe at T=8,9, but since we are starting at y=5 at T=7, and we want to go up, we might not go to rows 2,3,4, which are below, so probably we can ignore them, as we are moving up from 5 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 is unsafe later, but not relevant if we go fast.\n\nSo focus on rows 5-8.\n\nNow, at T=7, player is at y=5.\n\nT=7 is turn t1=7.\n\nNow, y=5 at T=7.\n\nRow 5 is unsafe at T=10, but at T=7 it might be safe, we need to check.\n\nFor row 5, is it occupied at T=7?\n\nFrom above, row 5 is occupied only at T=10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt T=7, for row 5, Δt=0, freeway 5: cars: first car [1,12] at T=7, 0 not in. Second car [-47,-36] at T=7, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows are safe at T=7 except possibly others, but rows 2,3,4 unsafe at T=8,9, but we are at y=5>4, so not on them.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are unsafe only at T=10, that means at T=10, if I am on any of rows 5,6,7,8, I will collide.\n\nTherefore, at turn T=10, I must not be on rows 5,6,7, or 8.\n\nWhere can I be? y=0,9, or 10? y only 0 to 9, so y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if I can be at y=9 at T=10, that might be fine, but at T=10, if I am on y=9, and row 9, but row 9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars? The vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nSo at T=10, to avoid collision, I must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince we want to reach y=9, being at y=9 at T=10 is good.\n\nBut we need to get there earlier or later, but minimal H.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe start at T=7, y=5.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe unsafe time is T=10 for rows 5-8.\n\nSo, one way is to reach y=9 before T=10, so that at T=10, we are not on rows 5-8.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at T=10, it's safe since no cars.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=9 earlier, also safe.\n\nBut we need minimal turns.\n\nFrom T=7 to T=10, there are 3 turns: T=7,8,9,10? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T=7, we are at position.\n\nThen we take action at T=7 to go to T=8 position, and so on.\n\nTurns: let t=0 be turn t1=7, so time from start.\n\nAt turn index: let τ = 0 at t1=7.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=5\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0,1,2,... we move to next position at τ+1.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nWe need y at some τ_final to be 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, we take actions, and at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at τ=0, y=5, not 9.\n\nAfter one action at τ=0, at τ=1, y changes.\n\nSet τ=0: turn t1+0=7, y=5\n\nτ=1: turn 8, y depends on action at τ=0\n\nτ=2: turn 9, y depends\n\nτ=3: turn 10, y depends\n\netc.\n\nWe need for some H, at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, at τ=3, which is T=10, we must not be on y=5,6,7,8, as established.\n\nSo at τ=3 (T=10), y must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, we need to avoid collisions on the rows we are on.\n\nBut for now, the critical point is T=10.\n\nSince we start at y=5, and need to go to y=9, with 4 steps up, but with constraint.\n\nList possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I go up every turn, from τ=0 to τ=3.\n\nAt τ=0 (T=7): y=5, take action U, go to y=6 at τ=1 (T=8)\n\nAt τ=1 (T=8): now on y=6, row 6.\n\nIs row 6 occupied at T=8?\n\nFrom above, row 6 is occupied only at T=10, not at T=8. T=8 is safe for row 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe only at T=10.\n\nAt T=8, row 6 should be safe.\n\nConfirm: freeway 6 at T=8, Δt = T-7 =1\n\nCars: first car (12,1,right,12), span at T: [1+12*1, 12+12*1] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (-36,-47,right,12), span [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1 (T=8), on y=6, take U, go to y=7 at τ=2 (T=9)\n\nAt τ=2 (T=9): on y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 at T=9: Δt=2, freeway 7 cars: first [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no; second [-47+24,-36+24]=[-23,-12], no 0. Safe.\n\nTake U, go to y=8 at τ=3 (T=10)\n\nAt τ=3 (T=10): on y=8, row 8.\n\nBut row 8 is unsafe at T=10! Because occupied.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=10, Δt=3, second car: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 in span, yes occupied.\n\nSo if I am on y=8 at T=10, collision.\n\nIn this path, at τ=3, I am on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nMoreover, I need to reach y=9, but I'm at y=8 at τ=3.\n\nIf I take U at τ=3, I go to y=9 at τ=4, which is T=11.\n\nBut at T=10, I was on y=8, collision.\n\nSo this path has collision at T=10.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could stay or move down to avoid.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSince at T=10, I must not be on rows 5-8, I should be at y=9 or y=0 before or at T=10.\n\nBut y=0 is far, so better to be at y=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=5, I need at least 4 up moves.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is at τ=4, if I go up every turn.\n\nStart τ=0, y=5\n\nAfter U at τ=0: y=6 at τ=1\n\nU at τ=1: y=7 at τ=2\n\nU at τ=2: y=8 at τ=3\n\nU at τ=3: y=9 at τ=4\n\nSo at τ=4 (T=11), y=9.\n\nNow, at τ=3 (T=10), I am at y=8, which is unsafe, as above.\n\nCollision.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=10, I need to not be on y=5,6,7,8 at that turn.\n\nSo one option is to be at y=9 at T=10 or earlier.\n\nBut at T=10, if I am at y=9, it's safe.\n\nCan I be at y=9 at T=10?\n\nT=10 is τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=9.\n\nBut from y=5 at τ=0, to y=9 at τ=3, I need to gain 4 in 3 turns, which requires moving up each time, but with y change +1 per up, so in 3 turns, I can gain at most 3, from 5 to 8, not to 9.\n\nImpossible to be at y=9 at τ=3 with only 3 actions.\n\ny at τ=3 is after 3 actions.\n\nAt τ=0: y=5\n\nAfter first action (at τ=0) to τ=1: y=5 or 6 or 4\n\nAfter second action to τ=2: y between 3 and 7\n\nAfter third action to τ=3: y between 2 and 8\n\nMaximum y at τ=3 is 8, if I go up all three times: 5->6->7->8.\n\nMinimum is 2, down all.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=9 at τ=3; earliest is τ=4 at y=9.\n\nTherefore, at T=10 (τ=3), I must be at y=8 or less, but y=8 is unsafe, and y=7,6,5 also unsafe at T=10.\n\ny=0 is safe, but far.\n\ny=9 not possible at τ=3.\n\nSo at τ=3 (T=10), I must be at y=0 to avoid collision, but that's worse.\n\nSince I cannot be at y=9 at T=10, and I must not be on rows 5-8 at T=10, the only safe row at T=10 is y=0 or y=9, but y=9 impossible, so I must be at y=0 at T=10.\n\nBut y=0 is below, and I need to go to y=9, which will take more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=10, be at y=0, then from there go up to y=9, which takes 9 more turns, total H larger.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 later without being at T=10 on bad rows.\n\nBut at T=10, if I am not on rows 5-8, I am safe, but I could be on y=9 or y=0.\n\nSince y=9 not possible at T=10, I must be on y=0 or perhaps on a row not 5-8, but only y=0 or y=9 are not freeways or safe.\n\ny=1 to 8 are freeways, but at T=10, rows 1,2,3,4 are safe? Let's check.\n\nAt T=10, which rows are occupied?\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nRow 1: occupied T=21,22,23,24, not at T=10\n\nRow 2: occupied T=8,9, not at T=10\n\nSimilarly row 3,4 same, occupied only T=8,9, not T=10\n\nRow 5,6,7,8 occupied at T=10\n\nSo at T=10, rows 1,2,3,4 are safe, as well as y=0 and y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at T=10, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4, or 9 to be safe.\n\nBut y=9 not possible at T=10, so I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=9 later.\n\nBut since I start from y=5, going down to y=4 or below at T=10 might be inefficient.\n\nBut necessary to avoid collision.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a safe row at T=10, like y=4, then go up.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nFirst, let's list all unsafe times for the rows we might be on.\n\nSince we are moving from 5 to 9, we care about rows 5,6,7,8 mainly, but we might go to other rows.\n\nBut to minimize turns, probably stay around.\n\nNow, back to the constraint: at T=10, I must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSo at τ=3 (T=10), y must be <=4 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y<=4.\n\nSince y=0,1,2,3,4 all safe at T=10.\n\nThen from there, I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the path from τ=0 to τ=3 must end at y<=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen from τ=3 onwards, go to y=9.\n\nBut at τ=3, y<=4, to y=9, need at least 5 up moves, so at least 5 more turns, total H at least 8 or something.\n\nBut let's see if I can do better.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 before T=10.\n\nBut earlier, to reach y=9 at τ=4 (T=11), but at τ=3 (T=10), if I am at y=8, which is unsafe, I have a problem.\n\nIn the direct up path, at T=10 I am at y=8, unsafe.\n\nBut if I can be at a different position at T=10.\n\nFor example, if at T=10 I am at y=4, safe, then from there I go up to y=9.\n\nBut that takes more turns.\n\nAnother idea: since the only unsafe time for rows 5-8 is T=10, I can be on those rows at other times safely.\n\nFor example, I can be on row 5 at T=7,8,9,11, etc. except T=10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I can move, but avoid being on rows 5-8 at exactly T=10.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I want to reach y=9 at τ=4 (T=11).\n\nThen I need to be at y=8 at τ=3 (T=10) to go up to y=9 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, T=10, if I am at y=8, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at τ=3, I can go to y=8 at τ=4, then y=9 at τ=5, later.\n\nBut at τ=3, if I am at y=7, and T=10, row 7 is unsafe at T=10, so collision if on y=7 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=6 or 5.\n\nOnly if I am not on 5-8 at T=10.\n\nSo for the turn T=10, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nThen at that turn, I am safe.\n\nThen from there, I can proceed to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should reach a low y as late as possible, but since I start high, going down might not help.\n\nThe best is to be at y=4 at T=10, for example, then go up.\n\nBut let's calculate the turns.\n\nStart at τ=0, T=7, y=5.\n\nI need to be at y<=4 at τ=3, T=10.\n\nThen at τ=3, y<=4.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 from there.\n\nMinimum turns from y<=4 to y=9 is 5 up moves, so at least 5 actions, so at τ=8, y=9.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, from τ=0 to τ=3, I need to go from y=5 to y<=4 in 3 turns.\n\nFor example, I can go down to y=4.\n\nBut I need to avoid other collisions.\n\nFor instance, at T=8 and T=9, rows 2,3,4 are occupied, but since I am at y=5 or above, I might not be on them.\n\ny=5 is row 5, which is safe at T=8 and T=9, since only unsafe at T=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's try a path.\n\nAt τ=0 (T=7), y=5. I can take action S or D to decrease y or stay.\n\nBut if I take D, I go to y=4 at τ=1 (T=8).\n\nAt T=8, row 4 is occupied? Row 4 is freeway 4, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8, if I am on y=4, row 4, which is occupied at T=8, so collision.\n\nOh, right! I forgot about rows 2,3,4 being occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8, rows 2,3,4 are occupied.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nSo if I am on row 2,3, or 4 at T=8 or T=9, collision.\n\nIn particular, if I go to y=4 at T=8, it is row 4, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=3 or 2 at T=8 or T=9, also collision, since rows 2,3,4 occupied.\n\nNow, rows 2,3,4 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, I must not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, I must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nAlso, at other times, the rows are safe.\n\nNow, let's list safe positions at each turn.\n\nTurn T=7: safe all y, since no row occupied except possibly, but at T=7, Δt=0, all rows safe as per earlier calculations.\n\nFor example, row 2 at T=7: freeway 2, car [-17,-6] at T=7, Δt=0, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo T=7: all y safe.\n\nT=8: rows 2,3,4 occupied, so unsafe for y=2,3,4.\n\nSafe for y=0,1,5,6,7,8,9\n\ny=1 is row 1, which is safe at T=8? Row 1 occupied only at T=21-24, so at T=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7,8 safe at T=8.\n\nT=9: similar to T=8, rows 2,3,4 occupied, so unsafe for y=2,3,4.\n\nSafe for y=0,1,5,6,7,8,9\n\nT=10: rows 5,6,7,8 occupied, so unsafe for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSafe for y=0,1,2,3,4,9\n\nT=11 and later: row 1 occupied at T=21-24, but if we reach y=9 early, we don't care.\n\nNow, player at T=7, y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nPossible actions.\n\nAt T=7, y=5, safe.\n\nI can take U, S, or D.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6 is safe, since row 6 not occupied at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, I can take action.\n\nIf I take U, go to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7 is safe, row 7 not occupied at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, if I take U, go to y=8 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, y=8 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at T=9, I take S, stay at y=7, but at T=10, y=7 is unsafe, since T=10 row 7 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I take D at T=9, go to y=6 at T=10, but y=6 unsafe at T=10.\n\nSo all lead to collision at T=10 if I reach y=7 or 8 at T=9.\n\nFrom T=8, y=6, if I take S, stay at y=6 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=6 is safe? Row 6 not occupied at T=9, only at T=10, so safe.\n\nThen at T=9, on y=6, I need to take action to avoid T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, if I am on y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to move to a safe row at T=10.\n\nOptions: from y=6 at T=9, I can take U to y=7 at T=10, but y=7 unsafe.\n\nD to y=5 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nS to y=6, unsafe.\n\nAll bad because rows 5-8 all unsafe at T=10.\n\nThe only way is to be on y<=4 or y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut from y=6 at T=9, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo if I am on y=6 at T=9, I cannot avoid collision at T=10, because I have to be on y=5,6,7 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=5 or y=7 or y=8 at T=9, same issue.\n\nAt T=9, from any y in 5-8, I can only move to adjacent y, which are 4-9, but y=9 might be possible.\n\nAt T=9, if I am on y=8, I can take U to y=9 at T=10.\n\ny=9 is safe at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=7, U to y=8 at T=10, unsafe, or to y=6, unsafe, cannot reach y=9 in one step.\n\ny=7 to y=8 or y=6.\n\nNot to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 to y=5,6,7.\n\nOnly from y=8 at T=9, I can go to y=9 at T=10.\n\nAnd y=9 is safe.\n\nSo, one way to avoid collision is to be at y=8 at T=9, then take U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=9, safe.\n\nThen I reach y=9 at τ=3, T=10.\n\nτ=3: after 3 actions, at turn T=10, y=9.\n\nIs that possible?\n\ny at τ=3 is after 3 actions from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=5.\n\nAfter 3 actions, y can be from 2 to 8, as before.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=3, I need to have moved up three times: 5->6->7->8.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=8, but T=10.\n\nBut at τ=3, it is turn T=10, position y=8.\n\nThen I take action at τ=3 to go to y=9 at τ=4.\n\nBut at the turn when I am at y=8, it is T=10, which is unsafe.\n\nIn terms of collision: at turn T=10, I am on row y=8, and since row 8 is occupied at T=10, collision occurs.\n\nEven if I take action to move away, but the collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or when I am on the row.\n\nFrom the problem: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen I am at position at turn T, that is when collision is checked.\n\nThen I take action to move to next position.\n\nSo at T=10, if y_T=8, and row 8 occupied, collision.\n\nThen I cannot take action; I die or something.\n\nSo I must not be on unsafe row at turn T.\n\nTherefore, in this case, if I am at y=8 at T=10, collision, before I can move.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at T=10, I need to be at y=9 at the start of T=10, which requires that at the previous turn, I was at y=8 or 9, and moved or stayed.\n\nBut at T=9, if I am at y=8, and take U, then at T=10 I am at y=9.\n\nBut at T=9, when I am at y=8, is it safe?\n\nT=9, row 8: is it occupied?\n\nFrom earlier, row 8 occupied only at T=10, not at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, Δt=2, freeway 8 cars: first car [25+24,36+24]= [49,60]? At T=9, Δt=T-7=2.\n\nCar 1: [25 + 12*2, 36 + 12*2] = [25+24,36+24]= [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nCar 2: [-47 + 12*2, -36 + 12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 8 safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSo, back to the plan.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=10, I need to be at y=8 at T=9, then take U at T=9 to be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, can I be at y=8 at T=9?\n\nT=9 is τ=2, since τ=0: T=7, τ=1: T=8, τ=2: T=9.\n\nAt τ=2, T=9, y=8.\n\nFrom start: at τ=0, T=7, y=5.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=2, I need to gain 3 in 2 turns? From y=5 to y=8 in two moves: possible with two up moves.\n\nAt τ=0, T=7: y=5, take U, go to y=6 at τ=1 (T=8)\n\nAt τ=1, T=8: y=6, take U, go to y=7 at τ=2 (T=9)\n\nAt τ=2, T=9: y=7, not y=8.\n\nI have y=7 at T=9, not 8.\n\nTo have y=8 at T=9, I need to be at y=8 after two actions.\n\nBut from y=5, after one action, max y=6, after two actions, max y=7, so I can only reach y=7 at τ=2 (T=9).\n\nCannot reach y=8 at T=9.\n\nThe position at τ=2 is after two actions, y=7 max.\n\nThen at T=9, I am at y=7.\n\nI can take U to go to y=8 at T=10, but at T=10 y=8 unsafe.\n\nOr take other actions.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I cannot reach y=9 before T=11 or avoid T=10 on bad rows, I must be on a safe row at T=10.\n\nSafe rows at T=10 are y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSince y=9 not possible.\n\nNow, among these, y=4 is closest to current position.\n\nSo, I should aim to be at y=4 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, τ=3, y=4.\n\nFrom y=5 at τ=0, to y=4 at τ=3, I need to decrease y by 1 in 3 turns, so I can do it with one down and two stays, or something.\n\nBut I need to avoid the unsafe times at T=8 and T=9 for rows 2,3,4.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8 and T=9, I must not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=10, I can be on y=4.\n\nNow, at τ=0, T=7, y=5.\n\nI can take action.\n\nSuppose I take S, stay at y=5 at τ=1 (T=8)\n\nAt T=8, y=5 is safe, since row 5 not occupied at T=8.\n\nThen at τ=1, T=8, y=5, I can take S again, stay at y=5 at τ=2 (T=9)\n\nAt T=9, y=5 is safe? Row 5 not occupied at T=9, only at T=10.\n\nAt T=9, Δt=2, freeway 5: car1 [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] no; car2 [-47+24,-36+24]=[-23,-12] no, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, T=9, y=5, I need to go to y=4 at τ=3 (T=10).\n\nSo take D, go to y=4 at τ=3 (T=10)\n\nAt T=10, y=4, which is safe, since row 4 not occupied at T=10, only at T=8,9.\n\nThen at τ=3, T=10, y=4, I can start moving up to y=9.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=4, I need to go to y=9, 5 steps up.\n\nSo take U five times.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, at τ=0, T=7: y=5, take S? But I need to move down eventually.\n\nIn this case, at T=10, I am at y=4.\n\nThen from there, to y=9.\n\nBut at T=10, after taking D, I am at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=3, I am at y=4, and I take action to move to next.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\nBut let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn T | action at T | position at T (after action? No.\n\nClarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, the player is at position y_T.\n\nThen, during turn T, they take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it is at the position at turn T, before action.\n\nFrom the problem: \"collision occurs at turn T only if ... for freeway y_T\" and y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nThen after that, they take action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T, position is y_T, then action a_T, then at turn T+1, position y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor turn T, collision is based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nt1=7.\n\nSo for turn t1=7, action a_{t1}, which affects position at t1+1.\n\nAt turn t1=7, position is given (0,5), so y_{t1} =5.\n\nThen after action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly for next.\n\nNow for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nI need to be at a safe position at T=10.\n\nSafe at T=10: y=0,1,2,3,4,9\n\nBut y=9 impossible, so y<=4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8 and T=9, safe if y not 2,3,4.\n\nNow, from T=7, y=5.\n\nI need to get to y<=4 by T=10, but avoiding being on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nOne way is to stay at y=5 for T=7, T=8, T=9.\n\nAt T=7: y=5, safe\n\nAt T=8: y=5, safe (since row 5 safe at T=8)\n\nAt T=9: y=5, safe\n\nThen at T=9, I take action to go to y=4 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at T=10, position y=4, I take action to move.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to increase y by 5.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so at least 5 turns after that.\n\nBut let's see the turn count.\n\nSet T=7: position y=5\n\nAction a_{7}: let's decide.\n\nIf I take S at T=7, then y_{8} = y_7 + 0 =5\n\nAt T=8: position y=5, safe. Action a_{8}: if S, then y_{9} =5\n\nAt T=9: position y=5, safe. Action a_{9}: take D, then y_{10} =5 -1 =4\n\nAt T=10: position y=4, safe. Then action a_{10}: take U, y_{11} =4+1=5\n\nThen continue U to go to y=9.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nSince I am at y=5 at T=9, I can take U to go to y=6 at T=10, but at T=10, y=6 is unsafe, not allowed.\n\nSo I have to go down to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen from y=4 at T=10, I can go up.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=14 or something.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 or 7, but at some point move down to be at safe row at T=10.\n\nFor example, at T=7, take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6, safe (row 6 safe at T=8).\n\nThen at T=8, take S, stay at y=6 for T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, safe (row 6 safe at T=9).\n\nThen at T=9, I need to go to a safe position at T=10.\n\nBut from y=6, I can take D to y=5 at T=10, but y=5 unsafe at T=10.\n\nTake U to y=7, unsafe.\n\nTake S to y=6, unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nTake D twice to go to y=4 at some point.\n\nBut at T=8, if I am at y=6, I can take D to go to y=5 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=5 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at T=9, y=5, I can take D to go to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's compare with staying at y=5.\n\nIn this case, I moved to y=6 and back, but still end at y=4 at T=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=7, take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, instead of staying, take D to y=5 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, take D to y=4 at T=10.\n\nSame thing.\n\nOr at T=9, take S to stay at y=5, but then at T=10 I have to go to y=4 or less, but if I stay at y=5 at T=9, I can take D to y=4 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10 y=5 is unsafe, so I must move away, but at T=9 position y=5, I take action to set y_{10}.\n\nBut at T=10, position is y_{10}, which must be safe.\n\nSo if I take D at T=9, y_{10}=4.\n\nIf I take S at T=9, y_{10}=5, unsafe.\n\nSo I have to take D at T=9 to go to y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo to be at y=4 at T=10, I can be at y=5 at T=9 and take D.\n\nHow to be at y=5 at T=9.\n\nI can be at y=5 from T=7 to T=9 by taking S at T=7 and T=8.\n\nAt T=7: position y=5, take S, so y_{8} =5\n\nAt T=8: position y=5, take S, so y_{9} =5\n\nAt T=9: position y=5, take D, so y_{10} =4\n\nAt T=10: position y=4, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from here.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=10, take U to y=5 at T=11\n\nAt T=11, position y=5, now row 5 at T=11: is it occupied? Row 5 occupied only at T=10, not at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, Δt=4, freeway 5: car1 [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] no; car2 [-47+48,-36+48]=[1,12] no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows safe except row 1 later.\n\nSo take U to y=6 at T=12\n\nU to y=7 at T=13\n\nU to y=8 at T=14\n\nU to y=9 at T=15\n\nAt T=15, position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t1=7 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt T=15, it is turn 15, which is t1 + 8, since t1=7, 7+8=15.\n\nτ from 0 to 8, 9 turns? Let's index.\n\nTurn t1=7: action a_7, position at T=7 is given, before action.\n\nAfter action a_7, position at T=8.\n\nAfter action a_8, position at T=9, and so on.\n\nPosition at T is set before action at T.\n\nFor the sequence: we start at turn t1=7, position (0,5).\n\nWe take action a_{t1} = a_7, which determines position at t1+1=8.\n\nThen at turn 8, take a_8, determine position at 9, etc.\n\nWe need position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nThe turn when position is (0,9), say at turn T_final.\n\nThen H is such that t1 + H -1 = T_final, so T_final = t1 + H -1 = 7 + H -1.\n\nNumber of actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, if position at T=7 is 5, not 9.\n\nAfter first action at T=7, position at T=8.\n\nIf at T=8, y=9, then we reached at T=8 with one action.\n\nBut in this case, from y=5 to y=9 in one action impossible.\n\nEarliest possible is at T=11, with 4 up moves.\n\nBut in our case, with avoidance, we have later.\n\nIn the above sequence, we reach at T=15.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=10, we can go up faster, but we need to move step by step.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe after T=10, I can go up directly from T=10 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence above, from T=10 to T=15, 5 turns to go from 4 to 9, but from 4 to 9 is 5 steps, so 5 actions: at T=10, position y=4, take U, go to y=5 at T=11; at T=11, take U, y=6 at T=12; U at T=12, y=7 at T=13; U at T=13, y=8 at T=14; U at T=14, y=9 at T=15.\n\nSo position at T=15 is y=9.\n\nT_final =15.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=7, so 7 + H -1 =15, 6 + H =15, H=9.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by being at a higher y at T=10.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=4 at T=10, but with fewer moves down.\n\nOr be at y=3 or 2, but that might be lower.\n\ny=1 or 2, but at T=8 and T=9, y=2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSo to be at y=4 at T=10, I must not be on y=4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSimilarly for other low rows.\n\nIn the path to y=4 at T=10, I need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, at T=7, y=5, I can take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, I can take D to y=5 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, take D to y=4 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from T=10, go up as before.\n\nSame as previous, reach at T=15.\n\nAt T=7, take D to y=4 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=4, row 4 occupied, collision! Not good.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nThe only safe way to be at low y at T=10 is to stay at y=5 or above until T=9, then move down to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut can I be at y=6 or 7 at T=10? No, unsafe.\n\ny=1 at T=10 is safe, but far.\n\nSo y=4 is best.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, perhaps I can start going up earlier, but avoid the T=10 on bad rows by being elsewhere.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=10, I can be on y=1, for example, but that takes more down moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 after T=10, but without being on bad rows at T=10.\n\nFor example, at T=10, be on y=4, then go up.\n\nBut that takes time.\n\nOr, at T=10, be on y=3, same thing.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11, I need to be at y=8 or 9 at T=10, and take U or S.\n\nBut at T=10, y=8 or 9, but y=8 unsafe, y=9 not possible.\n\nIf at T=10, I am at y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=10, I am at y=9, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=9 at T=11 with y=8 at T=10, because at T=10 y=8 collision.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at T=10, I can go to y=8 at T=11, then y=9 at T=12, but at T=10 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo only if I am at a safe row at T=10, then go to y=9 later.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9 is from y=4 at T=10, then at T=11 y=5, T=12 y=6, T=13 y=7, T=14 y=8, T=15 y=9.\n\n5 steps.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=10, worse.\n\nOr from y=1, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at y=5 at T=10, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thought: at T=9, I can be at y=8, then take U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=9, as before, from y=5 at T=7, I can be at y=7 at T=9, not y=8.\n\nIf I go up twice, to y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=7, I can take U to y=8 at T=10, but at T=10 y=8 unsafe.\n\nOr take other actions.\n\nBut I cannot directly go to y=9 from y=7 in one step.\n\nSo the only way to reach y=9 at T=10 is to be at y=8 at T=9 and take U.\n\nBut being at y=8 at T=9 requires being at y=7 at T=8 or something, but from start, at T=8, max y=6.\n\nT=7 y=5, take U at T=7, y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, take U, y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, take U, y=8 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nNo way to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before T=11 or at T=10.\n\nTherefore, the minimal way is to be at a safe row at T=10, like y=4, then go up to y=9 in 5 moves, reaching at T=15.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a faster way.\n\nSuppose at T=7, I take no action to move down, but stay.\n\nOr, perhaps move up to y=6 or 7, but then at T=9, I am at y=6 or 7, and I need to move to a safe row for T=10, but the only safe rows are low or 9, so I have to move down to y=4 or below.\n\nBut moving down takes turns and I have to go back up, so it might not save time.\n\nFor example, at T=7, take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, take U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, I take D to y=6 at T=10, but y=6 unsafe at T=10.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake D twice from T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, from y=7, take D to y=6 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=6 at T=10, same.\n\nTo reach y=4 at T=10 from y=7 at T=9, I need three down moves, impossible in one action.\n\nSo I can only move to adjacent.\n\nSo from y=7 at T=9, I can only go to y=6,7,8 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, if I am on y=5,6,7,8 at T=9, I cannot avoid collision at T=10 because I have to be on an unsafe row at T=10.\n\nThe only way to avoid is to be on y=9 at T=9 or on y<=4 at T=9, but at T=9, y<=4 is unsafe if y=2,3,4, and y=1 or 0 might be safe but low.\n\nAt T=9, safe rows are y=0,1,5,6,7,8,9\n\nIf I am on y=1 at T=9, I can go to y=0,1,2 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=0,1,2 are safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at T=9, from y=5, I need to move down, which takes turns and I reach later.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nFrom T=7 y=5, take D to y=4 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=4, row 4 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake D at T=7 to y=4 at T=8, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSo the only safe low rows at T=8 and T=9 are y=0,1, and y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=1 is row 1, safe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nHow to be at y=1 at T=9.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=7, I can take D to y=4, but at T=8 y=4 unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=4 at T=8, not possible without being there.\n\nAt T=7, take S to y=5 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, take D to y=4 at T=9, but at T=9, y=4, row 4 occupied at T=9, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I take multiple down, but I can't because of the unsafe rows in between.\n\nSo the only way to be at low y at T=9 is to be at y=1 or 0, but to get there from y=5, I have to pass through y=4,3,2, which are unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFor example, to go to y=1 at T=9:\n\nStart T=7 y=5.\n\nIf I take D at T=7, y=4 at T=8, but at T=8 y=4, collision.\n\nIf I take S at T=7, y=5 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, take D to y=4 at T=9, but at T=9 y=4, collision.\n\nAt T=8, take D to y=4 at T=9, collision.\n\nCannot avoid being on y=4 at T=8 or T=9 if I move down.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y<=4 at T=8 or T=9 without collision, because rows 2,3,4 are occupied at those times.\n\nThe only safe positions at T=8 and T=9 are y=0,1,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSince y=0 and 1 are low, and I am at y=5, it's better to stay at y=5 or go up to y=6,7,8.\n\nBut then at T=9, I am at y=5,6,7, or 8, and from there, I cannot directly go to a safe position at T=10 except if I am at y=8 and go to y=9, but I can't be at y=8 at T=9 from start.\n\nAt T=9, I can be at y=7 or 6 or 5.\n\nFrom y=7 at T=9, I can go to y=8 at T=10, unsafe.\n\nOr to y=6, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nUnless I go to y=9 from y=8, but I'm not at y=8.\n\nSo the only feasible way is to stay at y=5 until T=9, then go to y=4 at T=10, then go up to y=9.\n\nReaching at T=15.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at a higher safe row at T=10.\n\ny=3 or 2, but same issue, and I have to be there at T=10, but to reach y=3 at T=10, I might need to go through unsafe rows.\n\nFor example, to be at y=3 at T=10.\n\nFrom T=7 y=5, I can take actions to be at y=3 at T=10.\n\nBut at intermediate turns, I might be on unsafe rows.\n\nFor instance, at T=8, I must not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nSo if I go directly down, at T=8 I might be on y=4 or 3, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay high and then move down at T=9 to y=4, but y=4 at T=9 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=2,3,4 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach low y at T=10 is to be at y=5 at T=9 and move down to y=4 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly for other low rows, but y=4 is highest possible safe at T=10.\n\nSo I think the minimal is to reach at T=15.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=10, I can be on y=1, for example, but to be at y=1 at T=10, I need to move down from y=5, but I can't because of T=8 and T=9 unsafe rows.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at T=10.\n\nFrom T=7 y=5, take D to y=4 at T=8, collision at T=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo only possibility is to stay at y=5 for T=7,8,9, then at T=9 go to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen from T=10 to T-15 go up.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn t1=7: action a_7\n\nPosition at T=7: (0,5)\n\nAction a_7: let's say S, so position at T=8: (0,5)\n\nAction a_8: S, so position at T=9: (0,5)\n\nAction a_9: D, so position at T=10: (0,4)\n\nAction a_10: U, position at T=11: (0,5)\n\nAction a_11: U, position at T=12: (0,6)\n\nAction a_12: U, position at T=13: (0,7)\n\nAction a_13: U, position at T=14: (0,8)\n\nAction a_14: U, position at T=15: (0,9)\n\nPosition at T=15 is (0,9), so we reached at turn T=15.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=7, so 7 + H -1 =15, 6 + H =15, H=9.\n\nActions from turn 7 to turn 15, that's 9 actions: a7 to a15.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so a7 to a7+8? t1+H-1=7+9-1=15, yes.\n\nBut perhaps I can start moving up earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=7, instead of staying, take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, take S to stay at y=6 for T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, take D to y=5 at T=10, but at T=10 y=5 unsafe, not allowed.\n\nTake D to y=5, unsafe.\n\nSo I have to take D to a lower y, but I can only go to y=5,6,7.\n\nAll unsafe at T=10.\n\nSo I must take an action to go to y<=4, but from y=6, I can go to y=5 by D, but y=5 unsafe, or to y=6 or 7, unsafe.\n\nI cannot reach y=4 from y=6 in one action.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=5 at T=9 and go to y=4 at T=10.\n\nSo the sequence I have is fine.\n\nBut to make H smaller, perhaps I can reach y=9 from a different path.\n\nSuppose at T=10, I am at y=4, then I go up, but at T=11 y=5, T=12 y=6, etc.\n\nBut row 5 is safe after T=10, so no problem.\n\nBut it takes 5 turns from T=10 to T=15.\n\nSince I am at y=5 from T=7 to T=9, I wasted some turns not moving up.\n\nBut if I move up, I end up in a position where I have to move down or collide.\n\nFor example, if at T=7, I take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, I can take U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7, I have to deal with T=10.\n\nBut I can only stay or move to y=6,7,8 at T=10, all unsafe.\n\nSo I have to take an action that gets me to safe row, but I can't from there.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to do better than H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at T=11.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11, I need to be at y=8 or 9 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, y=8 unsafe, y=9 impossible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nAt T=11, position y=9, which requires that at T=10, I was at y=8 or 9, and took U or S.\n\nBut at T=10, if I was at y=8, collision before action.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, earliest possible is T=12? At T=11, y=9 requires y=8 at T=10 with U, but y=8 at T=10 collision.\n\nIf I am at y=4 at T=10, take U to y=5 at T=11, then at T=11 I can take U to y=6 at T=12, etc, to y=9 at T=15.\n\nNo earlier.\n\nAt T=10 y=4, take U at T=10 to y=5 at T=11, then at T=11 take U to y=6 at T=12, U at T=12 to y=7 at T=13, U at T=13 to y=8 at T=14, U at T=14 to y=9 at T=15.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from y=4 at T=10, I could go faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I think H=9 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on row 1, but it's later, not relevant.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nAt turn 7: action S\n\nTurn 8: action S\n\nTurn 9: action D\n\nTurn 10: action U\n\nTurn 11: action U\n\nTurn 12: action U\n\nTurn 13: action U\n\nTurn 14: action U\n\nTurn 15: but at turn 14, action U, position at T=15 is y=9, so we don't need action at T=15 if we reach at T=15.\n\nPosition at T=15 is after action at T=14.\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn 14, we take action U, and position at turn 15 is (0,9).\n\nTurn 15 is t1+H-1=15, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from turn 7 to turn 14, 8 actions? Turns: 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 8 turns.\n\nAt turn 7: action, affects position at 8\n\n...\n\nAt turn 14: action, affects position at 15.\n\nPosition at 15 is (0,9), so we take actions at turn 7 to 14, that's 8 actions, but H should be the number of turns we play actions until we reach.\n\nThe player plays H turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe need position at turn t1 + H to be (0,9)? Let's see.\n\nFrom the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn T = t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we take actions at turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, take action at t1, position at t1+1 should be 9, but from 5, not possible.\n\nIn our case, at turn 15, position is (0,9), so T_final = 15 = t1 + H -1 = 7 + H -1, so 6 + H =15, H=9.\n\nActions at turns 7 to 15? t1 + H -1 =15, so actions at turns from t1 to t1+H-1, that is turn 7 to turn 15.\n\nBut at turn 15, if position is already 9, do we need to take action? The action at turn 15 would determine position at 16, but we don't care.\n\nThe sequence is for actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1, after action or before?\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt that turn, position is 9.\n\nThen, the action at that turn is part of the sequence, but since position is already 9, action could be S or something, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn our sequence, at turn 15, position is (0,9), so we need to have action at turn 15, but it can be S, for example.\n\nIn the path above, at turn 14, we take U to go to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nThen at turn 15, position is (0,9), so we can take action S, for example, to stay, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nThe sequence includes action at turn 15.\n\nBut in the actions, for turn 15, we can put S.\n\nBut in the sequence I listed, I have actions up to turn 14, which sets position at turn 15 to 9.\n\nThen for turn 15, we need an action, but it can be arbitrary since we already reached.\n\nBut to include, we can add S at turn 15.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+H-1=15 is 9, so for the action at turn 15, it doesn't affect, but we need to specify it in the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 15, action a_{15}, but position at 15 is already 9, so action can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence I have:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 7: S  (position at 8: y=5)\n\nTurn 8: S  (position at 9: y=5)\n\nTurn 9: D  (position at 10: y=4)\n\nTurn 10: U  (position at 11: y=5)\n\nTurn 11: U  (position at 12: y=6)\n\nTurn 12: U  (position at 13: y=7)\n\nTurn 13: U  (position at 14: y=8)\n\nTurn 14: U  (position at 15: y=9)\n\nAt turn 15, position is (0,9), so we need to include action at turn 15, say S.\n\nSo Turn 15: S\n\nBut since position is already 9, and we take action, but it's fine.\n\nNow, H=9, actions from turn 7 to turn 15.\n\nt1 + H -1 =7+9-1=15, yes.\n\nTo save one turn, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can go up immediately after T=10.\n\nBut from T=10 y=4, it takes 5 steps.\n\nAnother idea: at T=9, instead of going down, but I have to.\n\nI think it's optimal.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow for the sequence, as above.\n\nBut in the action at turn 9, I take D to go to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can start up and still manage.\n\nSuppose at T=7, take U to y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, take S to y=6 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, I need to go to a safe row at T=10.\n\nBut from y=6, I can only go to y=5,6,7, all unsafe at T=10.\n\nUnless I go to y=4, but I can't from y=6 in one step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S  (but optional, but to have the position at turn 15, we need the action at turn 15 specified, but since we reached, S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 15, action can be S.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but we need H such that at turn t1+H-1=15, y=9, so action at turn 15 is included.\n\nBut in the action at turn 14, we go to y=9 at turn 15, so at turn 15, we are already at goal, so action at turn 15 doesn't matter.\n\nBut for the sequence, we list it.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\), while avoiding collisions with cars, is 9. The sequence of actions is designed to stay at \\(y=5\\) for turns 7, 8, and 9 to avoid the unsafe rows at those times, then move down to \\(y=4\\) at turn 10 to avoid the unsafe rows 5-8 at turn 10, and finally move up directly to \\(y=9\\) in the subsequent turns.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Turn 7 (current turn):** Position \\(y=5\\). Row 5 is safe at turn 7, as no car covers \\(x=0\\) (cars on row 5 cover \\(x=0\\) only at turn 10).\n- **Turn 8:** Position \\(y=5\\). Row 5 is safe at turn 8 (unsafe only at turn 10), and rows 2-4 are unsafe at turn 8, but \\(y=5\\) avoids them.\n- **Turn 9:** Position \\(y=5\\). Row 5 is safe at turn 9 (unsafe only at turn 10), and rows 2-4 are unsafe, but avoided.\n- **Turn 10:** Position \\(y=4\\). Row 4 is safe at turn 10 (unsafe only at turns 8 and 9), and rows 5-8 are unsafe, but avoided by being at \\(y=4\\).\n- **Turns 11-14:** Moving up through rows 5-8. These rows are safe after turn 10 (row 5-8 unsafe only at turn 10), so no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 15:** Position \\(y=9\\), which is not a freeway and always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 7 to turn 15 (9 actions) ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 15.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 7: \\(S\\) (stay, position at turn 8: \\(y=5\\))\n- Turn 8: \\(S\\) (stay, position at turn 9: \\(y=5\\))\n- Turn 9: \\(D\\) (move down, position at turn 10: \\(y=4\\))\n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) (move up, position at turn 11: \\(y=5\\))\n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) (move up, position at turn 12: \\(y=6\\))\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) (move up, position at turn 13: \\(y=7\\))\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) (move up, position at turn 14: \\(y=8\\))\n- Turn 14: \\(U\\) (move up, position at turn 15: \\(y=9\\))\n- Turn 15: \\(S\\) (stay, position remains \\(y=9\\); this action is included to complete the sequence as \\(y=9\\) is reached at turn 15)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=10, and they move left or right based on their direction and speed. For right-moving cars, the span increases to the right over time; for left-moving, it increases to the left.\n\nLet me list all the cars at turn t_1=10:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=3)\n\nSince direction is right, head is greater than tail, so at time t, the span is [tail + s*(t - t_1), head + s*(t - t_1)] for right-moving? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 3). So head=48, tail=37, so at t_1, span is [37, 48]? But for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] since head is larger.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1 at t_1: head=48, tail=37, so τ=37, h=48, so Span(t_1) = [37,48], and it moves right, so at time T, Span(T) = [37 + 3(T-10), 48 + 3(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). Head=-48, tail=-59? That seems odd because -48 > -59, so if direction is right, head should be larger, but -48 is larger than -59, so τ=-59, h=-48, so Span(t_1) = [-59, -48], and at T, Span(T) = [-59 + 6(T-10), -48 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same as freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12, so Span(t_1) = [37,48], Span(T) = [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12, so Span(t_1) = [-11, 0], Span(T) = [-11 + 12(T-10), 0 + 12(T-10)] = [12(T-10) -11, 12(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 and 7: same as freeway 5, two cars each: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=12, so τ=-59, h=-48, Span(t_1) = [-59,-48], Span(T) = [-59 + 12(T-10), -48 + 12(T-10)]\n\nSecond car: same as above, Span(T) = [12(T-10) -11, 12(T-10)]\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 10. y=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars. But collision only happens on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is probably safe.\n\nAt each turn, when the player is on a freeway y=1 to 8, we need to check if 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, we check for collision with cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, since the player moves step by step, and we need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny starts at 0 at turn 10.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T} is set, and if y_T in [1,8], check collision.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, player chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}, but y_{t+1} is for the next turn.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen player chooses action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at the end of turn t, or beginning of turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nBut for collision: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T, I think.\n\nThe player update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nIf y_T is between 1 and 8 inclusive, and for some car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T), then collision.\n\nSpan(T) is for turn T, as given.\n\nAlso, the note: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nIf you choose to move to a different y, that happens at the next turn.\n\nSo for collision check at turn T, only freeway y_T matters.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t_1=10, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no collision possible at turn 10, since y=0.\n\nThen, after action a_{10}, y_{11} is set, and at turn 11, position y_{11}, if between 1-8, check collision with cars on that row at turn 11.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9. When y_H =9 for some H, and since y=9 is not a freeway, no collision, so we stop when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nt is the turn number.\n\nStart: turn 10, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so number of actions is H.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position at turn t_1 + H is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=10, so we want y_{10 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we need to find minimal H and actions a_{10} to a_{10+H-1}.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, the minimal number of actions would be at least 9, if we always move up, but there might be cars blocking, so we might need to wait or move down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nBut moving down might increase H, so we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements.\n\nAll cars are moving right, since all directions are right.\n\nFor each freeway, we need to see when 0 is in the span for that freeway at a given turn.\n\nCollision if for some car on the freeway, 0 is in Span(T) at turn T.\n\nSpan(T) depends on T.\n\nLet me define the time from t_1=10.\n\nSet τ = T - 10, so τ is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nAt time T = 10 + τ, for τ >=0.\n\nThen for each car, Span at T=10+τ.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: one car, Span(T) = [37 + 3τ, 48 + 3τ] for τ = T-10\n\n0 is in this span if 37 + 3τ <= 0 <= 48 + 3τ\n\nSince 37+3τ <= 48+3τ always, but 0 >= 37+3τ and 0 <= 48+3τ.\n\n0 >= 37+3τ implies 3τ <= -37, τ <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333, since τ >=0, this is impossible. Similarly, 0 <= 48+3τ is always true for τ>=0. But 0 >= 37+3τ requires τ <= -12.333, impossible, so 0 is never in the span for freeway 1 car. Because the car is at [37,48] at τ=0, and moving right, so it's always positive and increasing, so 0 is never covered. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt τ=0, span [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAs τ increases, left end 37+3τ >=37>0, so 0 < left end, so 0 not in span. Yes, so for freeway 1, no collision possible at any time, since the car is always to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car with Span(T) = [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6τ <= 0 <= -48 + 6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 6τ <= 0 => 6τ <= 59 => τ <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 6τ => 6τ >= 48 => τ >= 8\n\nSo for τ between 8 and 9.833, approximately.\n\nSince τ integer, τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nAt τ=8: -59 + 48 = -11, -48 + 48=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=9: -59 + 54 = -5, -48 + 54=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, τ=7: -59+42=-17, -48+42=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at τ=8 and τ=9, i.e., turns T=10+8=18 and T=10+9=19.\n\nτ= T-10, so at T=18 (τ=8) and T=19 (τ=9), if player is on freeway 2, collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car, so also collision at T=18 and 19 if on y=3.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=18,19 on y=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), Span(T) = [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span? 37+12τ <=0 <=48+12τ? But 37+12τ >=37>0 for τ>=0, so 0 not in, similar to freeway 1.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), Span(T) = [-11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ] = [12τ -11, 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 12τ -11 <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nSince 0 <= 12τ always true for τ>=0.\n\n12τ -11 <= 0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so only possible for τ=0? But τ=0: span [-11,0], so 0 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is included? 12τ -11 <=0 <=12τ.\n\nAt τ=0: 12*0 -11 = -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nBut at τ=0, T=10, span is [-11,0], so x=0 is the right end.\n\nIn the span [left, right], if left <= x <= right, x in span.\n\nAt τ=0, left=-11, right=0, so for x=0, -11 <=0<=0, 0<=0 is true, so yes, 0 is in the span at τ=0.\n\nBut τ=0 is T=10.\n\nFor freeway 5, second car at T=10, span is [-11,0], so 0 is included, meaning if player is on y=5 at turn 10, collision.\n\nBut player starts at turn 10 on y=0, not on y=5, so no issue.\n\nNow, for other τ: 0 in span only if 12τ -11 <=0 and 0<=12τ.\n\n0<=12τ always for τ>=0.\n\n12τ -11 <=0 => τ <=11/12 <1, so only τ=0 possible, since τ integer, τ=0 only.\n\nAt τ=1: span [12*1 -11, 12*1] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for τ>0, left end >=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only at T=10 (τ=0), if on y=5, collision. But at T=10, player is not on y=5, so for later turns, no collision possible on freeway 5 from this car.\n\nFirst car never has 0 in span.\n\nSo freeway 5 is always safe except at T=10, but since player not there, it's safe at all times for player to be on.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car safe, second car only collision at T=10 if on y=6, but not, so freeway 6 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), so head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [-59,-48], Span(T) = [-59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12τ <=0 <= -48 +12τ\n\nFirst: -59+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <=59/12≈4.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12τ => 12τ >=48 => τ >=4\n\nSo τ=4 and τ=5? τ integer.\n\nτ=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: -59+36=-23, -48+36=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=4, T=14, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nNow second car on freeway 8: (0,-11,right,12), same as before, Span(T) = [12τ -11, 12τ]\n\n0 in span only for τ=0, as before.\n\nAt τ=0, T=10.\n\nBut for freeway 8, at T=10, if on y=8, collision from second car.\n\nBut player not there.\n\nFor first car, at T=14 (τ=4), collision if on y=8.\n\nAnd at other times, no collision.\n\nSpecifically, for second car, only τ=0, and for first car, only τ=4.\n\nSo freeway 8 has collision at T=10 and T=14 if player is on y=8.\n\nT=10 not relevant, T=14 is a concern.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe (car never covers 0)\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=18 and T=19\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, dangerous at T=18,19\n\n- y=4: same, dangerous at T=18,19\n\n- y=5: always safe (only danger at T=10, not relevant)\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=14 (τ=4)\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=14 only? From above, at T=14, τ=4, first car has span [-11,0], so yes.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 10, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny can be changed by U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, min 9 moves up, but we might need to wait or avoid.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are always safe, we can stay there as long as we want.\n\ny=1 is always safe, y=2,3,4 dangerous only at T=18,19, y=8 dangerous only at T=14.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, the critical points are to avoid being on y=8 at T=14, and avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=18 or 19.\n\nT=18 and 19 are turns from start.\n\nt_1=10, so T=18 is turn 18, which is 8 turns after t_1.\n\nSimilarly, T=14 is 4 turns after.\n\nNow, player position over time.\n\nLet t denote turn number, starting from t=10.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nt=10: y=0\n\nThen after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nWe need to reach y_t =9 for some t, minimal t.\n\nSince we can move up, down, or stay, the minimal time to reach y=9 from y=0 is 9 turns if we always move up: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, then y_{11}=1, y_{12}=2, ..., y_{19}=9.\n\nt=10: y=0\n\nAfter a_{10}, y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}\n\nIf a_{10}=U, Δy=+1, y_{11}=1\n\nThen a_{11}, if U, y_{12}=2, and so on.\n\nAfter k up moves, y_{10+k} = k\n\nTo reach y=9, need y_{10+H} =9, so if all U, H=9, y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, check if this path has collisions.\n\nPlayer on freeways when y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=11, y=1, freeway 1, which is always safe.\n\nt=12, y=2, freeway 2, at t=12, which is T=12, τ=2, for y=2, dangerous only at t=18 and 19, not 12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=13, y=3, freeway 3, safe since not t=18 or 19.\n\nt=14, y=4, freeway 4, at t=14, not 18 or 19, safe.\n\nt=15, y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nt=16, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=17, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=18, y=8, freeway 8, at t=18, which is dangerous? t=18 is T=18.\n\nFor y=8, dangerous only at T=14, not 18.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=14, not at T=18.\n\nT=18 is for y=2,3,4.\n\nAt t=18, if y=8, it should be safe, since y=8 danger only at t=14.\n\nt=14: τ=4, T=14.\n\nAt t=18, τ=8, for y=8, freeway 8 cars: first car span at τ=8: [-59 +12*8, -48 +12*8] = [-59+96, -48+96] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [12*8 -11, 12*8] = [96-11,96] = [85,96], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nThen t=19, y=9, which is not a freeway, safe, goal reached.\n\nIn this path: t=11 to t=18, y=1 to 8, all safe at those times.\n\nt=18 y=8 safe, as above.\n\nt=19 y=9, done.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nIs there a problem?\n\nAt t=18, y=8, safe, but what about y=2,3,4 at t=18?\n\nIn this path, at t=18, y=8, not on y=2,3,4, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, t=19, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo this seems fine, and H=9, with all U actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart t=10, y=0.\n\nAction a_{10}: if U, then y_{11}=1\n\na_{11}: U, y_{12}=2\n\n...\n\nup to a_{18}: U, y_{19}=9\n\nActions from t=10 to t=18, that's 9 actions: a_{10} to a_{18}, and y_{19}=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =10 + H -1, and y_{t_1 + H} = y_{10+H} =9.\n\nSo 10+H -1 =18 if H=9, so a_{10} to a_{18}, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, all actions U.\n\nBut is there any collision? From above, no.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at t=14.\n\nIn this path, at t=14, y=4 (since y_{11}=1, y_{12}=2, y_{13}=3, y_{14}=4), freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=18 and 19, not 14.\n\nAt t=14, freeway 4: for y=4, cars are similar to y=2,3.\n\nFreeway 4 has car (-48,-59,right,6), span at T: [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\nAt t=14, τ=4, span [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24], which is all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=18, τ=8, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in, dangerous if on y=4.\n\nBut in the path, at t=18, y=8, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly, t=19, y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut the player needs to go through y=8 at some point.\n\nIn this path, at t=18, y=8, which is safe since t=18 not dangerous for y=8.\n\nDanger for y=8 only at t=14.\n\nBut in this path, at t=14, y=4, not y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster? Minimal H.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, with moves of +1,0,-1, the minimal number of turns is 9, since we need to increase y by 9, and each U increases by 1, S or D don't help or decrease, so minimal actions is 9 with all U.\n\nWith D, it would take more turns.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal possible.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with no collision.\n\nBut let me check if at any point, when on a freeway, it is dangerous.\n\nt=11, y=1: freeway 1, car at [37+3τ,48+3τ], at τ=1 (t=11), [40,51], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=12, y=2: freeway 2, car span at τ=2 (t=12), [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=13, y=3: similar, τ=3, [-59+18, -48+18]=[-41,-30], safe.\n\nt=14, y=4: τ=4, [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], safe.\n\nt=15, y=5: freeway 5, always safe, e.g. at τ=5, first car [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], not 0; second car [12*5-11,60]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nt=16, y=6: similar.\n\nt=17, y=7: similar.\n\nt=18, y=8: τ=8, freeway 8, first car [-59+96, -48+96]=[37,48], not 0; second car [96-11,96]=[85,96], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=19, y=9, safe.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars, but as we saw, only the second car at τ=0 was dangerous, but not for the player path.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can reach earlier, but no, with y starting at 0, after 8 U moves, y=8 at t=18, then to y=9 at t=19.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_{18}=8, then a_{18}=U, y_{19}=9.\n\nCannot reach before t=19.\n\nt=10: y=0\n\nt=11: y=1\n\n...\n\nt=19: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps with down moves, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nSequence: all actions U from turn 10 to turn 18.\n\nBut let's write in the answer format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1+8} = U\n\nt_1=10, so turns: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18\n\nActions all U.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=9, so t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nThen at turn 19, position is (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence ends with a_{18}, and y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, but in the car for freeway 8, at t=14, it was dangerous, but in this path, we are not on y=8 at t=14, so fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if there is any constraint that forces us to wait or something, but in this case, no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or move down to avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times, but here since we are not on those y at those times, and we can go straight, it should be ok.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=18, if player were on y=2,3, or 4, collision.\n\nBut in this path, at t=18, y=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, if on y=8, collision, but we are on y=4, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to box the sequence.\n\nBut let me make sure about freeway 5,6,7.\n\nFor example, at t=15, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt τ=5 (t=15), cars: first [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], not 0.\n\nSecond [12*5 -11, 60]=[60-11,60]=[49,60], not 0. Safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11, so at τ=0, span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nBut at τ=0, t=10.\n\nFor t>10, no.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSince t_1=10.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can do with less, but no, from y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves.\n\nIf we start moving later, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can move faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Collision Times\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at turn \\(T\\), and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n- The car spans are evaluated at each turn \\(T\\) relative to \\(t_1 = 10\\), with \\(\\tau = T - 10\\).\n\n#### Freeway Safety Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Car (48, 37, right, 3).  \n  Span at \\(T\\): \\([37 + 3\\tau, 48 + 3\\tau]\\).  \n  Since \\(37 + 3\\tau > 0\\) for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\), 0 is never in the span. **Always safe.**\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Car (-48, -59, right, 6).  \n  Span at \\(T\\): \\([-59 + 6\\tau, -48 + 6\\tau]\\).  \n  0 in span when \\(-59 + 6\\tau \\leq 0 \\leq -48 + 6\\tau\\), which holds for \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\) (turns \\(T = 18\\) and \\(T = 19\\)). **Dangerous at \\(T = 18, 19\\).**\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Same as freeway 2. **Dangerous at \\(T = 18, 19\\).**\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Same as freeway 2. **Dangerous at \\(T = 18, 19\\).**\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Cars (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12).  \n  - First car: Span \\([37 + 12\\tau, 48 + 12\\tau]\\), always > 0, safe.  \n  - Second car: Span \\([12\\tau - 11, 12\\tau]\\). 0 in span only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (\\(T = 10\\)), irrelevant since player not on y=5 at \\(T=10\\). **Always safe for \\(T > 10\\).**\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Same as freeway 5. **Always safe.**\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Same as freeway 5. **Always safe.**\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Cars (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12).  \n  - First car: Span \\([-59 + 12\\tau, -48 + 12\\tau]\\). 0 in span at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (\\(T = 14\\)).  \n  - Second car: Span \\([12\\tau - 11, 12\\tau]\\). 0 in span only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (\\(T = 10\\)), irrelevant. **Dangerous at \\(T = 14\\).**\n\nSummary of dangerous times:\n- Avoid y=2, y=3, y=4 at turns 18 and 19.\n- Avoid y=8 at turn 14.\n- Freeways y=1, y=5, y=6, y=7 are always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach y=9 from y=0 is 9, as each \"up\" (U) action increases y by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve a +9 change in y.\n- A sequence of 9 U actions from turn 10 to turn 18 results in:\n  - Turn 10: y=0 → action U → y_{11} = 1\n  - Turn 11: y=1 → action U → y_{12} = 2\n  - Turn 12: y=2 → action U → y_{13} = 3\n  - Turn 13: y=3 → action U → y_{14} = 4\n  - Turn 14: y=4 → action U → y_{15} = 5\n  - Turn 15: y=5 → action U → y_{16} = 6\n  - Turn 16: y=6 → action U → y_{17} = 7\n  - Turn 17: y=7 → action U → y_{18} = 8\n  - Turn 18: y=8 → action U → y_{19} = 9 (goal reached).\n\n#### Collision Check:\n- Turn 11 (y=1): Freeway 1 safe (span [40,51] at τ=1, 0 not in).\n- Turn 12 (y=2): Freeway 2 safe (span [-47,-36] at τ=2, 0 not in; dangerous only at T=18,19).\n- Turn 13 (y=3): Freeway 3 safe (span [-41,-30] at τ=3, 0 not in).\n- Turn 14 (y=4): Freeway 4 safe (span [-35,-24] at τ=4, 0 not in; dangerous only at T=18,19).\n- Turn 15 (y=5): Freeway 5 safe (spans [97,108] and [49,60] at τ=5, 0 not in).\n- Turn 16 (y=6): Freeway 6 safe.\n- Turn 17 (y=7): Freeway 7 safe.\n- Turn 18 (y=8): Freeway 8 safe (spans [37,48] and [85,96] at τ=8, 0 not in; dangerous only at T=14).\n- Turn 19 (y=9): Not a freeway, no collision.\n\nThe path avoids all dangerous freeways at critical times and reaches (0,9) in minimal turns \\(H=9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10\\) to \\(18\\) is all U.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: \n- The player updates at the same time as the cars. \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nAlso note: \n- When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is on freeway y at turn T (and hence must avoid the car on freeway y at turn T) and then at turn T+1 the player will be on freeway y+1 (or y-1) and must avoid the car on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nGiven the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: one car (51,40,right,3) -> moving right, so at time t, the car's position is [40 + 3*(t-t1), 51 + 3*(t-t1)]? \nBut note the update rule: \n- Right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the initial state is given at t1 (which is 11). So for a right-moving car, the initial head is h and tail is tau? But the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nIn the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initial span at t1: [tau, h] -> meaning the car extends from tau to h? \n  Then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table for freeway 1: (51,40,right,3) -> so head=51, tail=40? \nThat would mean the car is from 40 to 51? But then the update rule for right-moving says the initial span is [tau, h] = [40,51]? \nBut then at time T, it becomes [40 + 3*(T-11), 51 + 3*(T-11)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is on freeway k at turn T and the car's span at T includes 0.\n\nWe are starting at (0,1) at turn 11.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But note that we are at y=1 initially, and we can only move to adjacent rows (if we move up, we go to y=2; down to y=0). And we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nLet me denote the state at time t (relative to t1=11) as (t, y) meaning at absolute turn = 11+t, the player is at (0, y).\n\nWe start at t=0 (absolute turn 11) at y=1.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for t=0 to H-1 such that at time H-1 (absolute turn 11+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a time when a car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: at the start, we are at y=1 (freeway 1) at turn 11. So we must check the car on freeway 1 at turn 11: \n  Freeway 1: car at turn 11: [40, 51] (since right-moving: [tau, h] = [40,51])? \n  But wait, the table says (head=51, tail=40, right, 3). \n\nIn the update rule for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] -> so [40,51]. \nDoes this span include 0? 40 to 51 does not include 0 -> so safe at turn 11.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \nAt turn 11, we are on freeway 1 and the car on freeway 1 at turn 11 is [40,51] -> no collision.\n\nNow, we must plan the moves.\n\nWe are at y=1 at time 0 (relative to t1=11). We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 8 moves of U (since 1+8=9). But we have obstacles (cars) on the freeways.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway at a time when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe need to simulate the car movements.\n\nLet me write the car positions at any absolute turn T (starting at T=11).\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  right-moving, initial head=51, tail=40, speed=3.\n  At turn T: the span is [40 + 3*(T-11), 51 + 3*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: \n  (-42,-53,right,6) -> note: head=-42, tail=-53? \n  For right-moving: initial span [tau, h] = [-53, -42]? \n  Then at turn T: [-53 + 6*(T-11), -42 + 6*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 5,6,7: \n  Two cars: \n    (60,49,right,12) -> [49 + 12*(T-11), 60 + 12*(T-11)]\n    (12,1,right,12) -> [1 + 12*(T-11), 12 + 12*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 8:\n  (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47 + 12*(T-11), -36 + 12*(T-11)]\n  (12,1,right,12) -> [1 + 12*(T-11), 12 + 12*(T-11)]\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at time T if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nNote: for freeways 5,6,7,8 there are two cars. So we must check both.\n\nWe need to find a path from y=1 at T=11 to y=9 at the earliest possible T.\n\nWe can use BFS in state (t, y) where t is the relative time (number of steps from t1=11) and y is the row.\n\nBut note: the absolute turn is 11+t. And we must check for each step: when we are at (t, y) (meaning at absolute turn T = 11+t, we are at row y) then we must not be colliding with the car on freeway y at time T.\n\nAlso, note: we start at t=0, y=1.\n\nWe are allowed to move up, down, or stay. But we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that at relative time H (absolute turn 11+H) we are at y=9.\n\nWe can do a BFS (or Dijkstra since all steps cost 1) in the state (t, y) with the time step t (which is the number of moves taken so far) and the position y.\n\nBut note: the state should also include the absolute time because the car positions depend on absolute time.\n\nActually, we can let the state be (abs_time, y) but abs_time = 11 + t, and t is the step count. However, the step count t is the same as the absolute time offset. So we can use relative time t (from 0) and then absolute time is 11+t.\n\nWe'll simulate from t=0 (absolute 11) to ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll check for each state (t, y) whether it is safe: if y is 0 or 9, then no car (since freeways are 1..8) -> always safe. If y is between 1 and 8, then we check the car(s) on that freeway at absolute time T=11+t.\n\nWe need to check for each car on freeway y at time T=11+t: if 0 is in the span of that car.\n\nWe must avoid states that are unsafe.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we can be at (t,9) for the first time? But note: we must be at (0,9) at the end of a sequence of actions. That is, after H actions, we are at y=9 at time H (relative) meaning absolute time 11+H.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo we start at t=0 (relative) at y=1, and we take H actions and end at relative time H at y=9.\n\nWe can do BFS by time steps.\n\nWe'll keep a queue: (time, y, path) but the path might be long? However, we are only interested in the minimal H, and then we output the actions.\n\nBut note: the minimal H might be large? However, we are moving only vertically and the grid is small (10 rows). We can use BFS with state (t, y) and we break when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the time t can go high? But the cars are moving and the pattern might repeat? However, the speeds are constant and the cars are moving infinitely. But note the problem: we are to avoid when 0 is in the span. Since the cars are moving at constant speeds, the condition for 0 being in the span is periodic? Actually, the car spans are linear in time. \n\nBut we can simulate until we find a path. Since we are going from row 1 to 9, we expect H to be at least 8. But the obstacles might force us to wait sometimes.\n\nWe can try to compute the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nBut note: the freeways are independent? So we can precompute for each freeway k and for each absolute time T (starting at T=11) whether the freeway k is safe at T (i.e., no car has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: the absolute time T can be any integer >=11.\n\nWe can compute the condition for a car:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  span = [a, b] at time T, where a = tau + s*(T-11), b = h + s*(T-11)\n  We require 0 not in [a, b] -> so either 0 < a or 0 > b.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all the cars in this problem are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car (head, tail, right, s) on a freeway, at time T:\n  a = tail + s*(T-11)\n  b = head + s*(T-11)\n\nCondition for unsafe: a <= 0 <= b.\n\nSimilarly, if there are two cars, then if either car has a <= 0 <= b, then unsafe.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each T (starting at 11) whether it is safe.\n\nBut T can be large? However, we are looking for a minimal path that goes from y=1 to y=9. The minimal steps is at least 8, but we might have to wait. How long might we have to wait? The car patterns might repeat with a period that is the least common multiple of the speeds? But the speeds are 3,6,12 -> lcm(3,6,12)=12. So the pattern repeats every 12 turns? Actually, the condition a<=0<=b is linear in T, so the unsafe times for a car form a periodic set with period = (period of the car's movement relative to 0). \n\nBut note: the car moves at speed s, so the condition for a car: \n  a(T) = tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11) = b(T)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  tail + s*(T-11) <= 0  => T <= ( - tail ) / s + 11\n  head + s*(T-11) >= 0  => T >= ( - head ) / s + 11\n\nBut note: the condition is: \n  T >= ( - head ) / s + 11   and   T <= ( - tail ) / s + 11\n\nBut also, note: for a right-moving car, we have head > tail (because the head is the front). In our data:\n\nFreeway 1: head=51, tail=40 -> head>tail -> positive length? Actually, the car extends from tail to head? So the head is greater than the tail.\n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: the car moves to the right, so the entire segment shifts to the right. \n\nSo the condition for the car to cover 0 is:\n\n  tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)\n\nSo:\n\n  T >= ceil( ( - head ) / s + 11 )   ??? Actually, we must be careful: T is integer.\n\nBut note: the car's span is continuous, and 0 is a point. So we can compute the exact T when the car covers 0.\n\nLet me define for a car (h,tail,s) (right-moving) the time interval [T_low, T_high] where:\n\n  T_low = ceil( ( - h ) / s + 11 )   ??? \n\nWait, we have:\n\n  tail + s*(T-11) <= 0  => T <= ( - tail ) / s + 11\n  h + s*(T-11) >= 0    => T >= ( - h ) / s + 11\n\nBut note: because the car moves to the right, the tail is the left end and the head is the right end. And the car covers 0 if the left end is <=0 and the right end >=0.\n\nSo the condition is:\n\n  T >= ( - h ) / s + 11   and   T <= ( - tail ) / s + 11\n\nBut note: since the car has positive length, we have h>tail, so ( - h )/s + 11 < ( - tail )/s + 11.\n\nSo the car covers 0 for T in the interval:\n\n  T_min = ceil( ( - h ) / s + 11 )   to   T_max = floor( ( - tail ) / s + 11 )\n\nBut note: T must be integer and the inequalities are inclusive.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: if ( - h )/s +11 is integer, then T_min = ( - h )/s +11 is included? Because then h + s*(T_min-11)=0.\n\nSimilarly, if ( - tail )/s +11 is integer, then T_max is included.\n\nSo the set of T (absolute) for which the car covers 0 is:\n\n  T in [ ceil( ( - h ) / s + 11 ), floor( ( - tail ) / s + 11 ) ]   ??? \n\nBut note: \n\n  We require: h + s*(T-11) >= 0  -> T-11 >= -h/s -> T >= 11 - h/s\n\n  and tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 -> T-11 <= -tail/s -> T <= 11 - tail/s.\n\nSo the interval is [ 11 - h/s, 11 - tail/s ].\n\nBut T must be integer, so the integer T in [ ceil(11 - h/s), floor(11 - tail/s) ].\n\nBut note: because h>tail, we have -h/s > -tail/s (since s>0) -> so 11 - h/s > 11 - tail/s? No, because h>tail (positive) so -h < -tail -> -h/s < -tail/s -> 11 - h/s < 11 - tail/s.\n\nSo the interval is [ 11 - h/s, 11 - tail/s ] and since 11 - h/s < 11 - tail/s, the integer T must be in:\n\n  T_min = ceil(11 - h/s) \n  T_max = floor(11 - tail/s)\n\nAnd the car is unsafe at T for T_min <= T <= T_max.\n\nBut note: if the interval is empty, then the car never covers 0.\n\nLet me test with freeway 1: h=51, tail=40, s=3.\n\n  T_min = ceil(11 - 51/3) = ceil(11 - 17) = ceil(-6) = -6\n  T_max = floor(11 - 40/3) = floor(11 - 13.333) = floor(-2.333) = -3\n\nSo the interval is [-6, -3] -> which is entirely in the past? So at T>=11, the car never covers 0? \n\nBut at T=11: \n  tail + s*(T-11) = 40 + 0 = 40\n  head + s*(T-11)=51\n  so 0 is not in [40,51] -> safe.\n\nSo yes, this car never covers 0 at T>=11.\n\nNow freeway 2,3,4: car (-42,-53,right,6) -> note: head=-42, tail=-53? \nBut wait: in the table, it's written as (-42,-53,right,6). \n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] = [-53, -42]? \nThen at time T: [-53+6*(T-11), -42+6*(T-11)]\n\nCondition for unsafe: \n  T_min = ceil(11 - (-42)/6) = ceil(11 + 42/6) = ceil(11+7)=18\n  T_max = floor(11 - (-53)/6) = floor(11 + 53/6) = floor(11+8.833)=floor(19.833)=19\n\nSo unsafe at T=18 and 19.\n\nLet me check:\n  At T=18: \n    tail + 6*(18-11) = -53 + 6*7 = -53+42 = -11\n    head + 6*(18-11) = -42 + 42 = 0 -> so 0 is included? \n    The span is [-11,0] -> includes 0? Actually, the span is from -11 to 0, so 0 is the right end -> included.\n\n  At T=19:\n    tail: -53 + 6*8 = -53+48 = -5\n    head: -42+48=6 -> span [-5,6] -> includes 0.\n\n  At T=20: \n    tail: -53+6*9 = -53+54=1\n    head: -42+54=12 -> [1,12] -> does not include 0.\n\nSo unsafe at T=18,19.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5,6,7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12)\n  T_min = ceil(11 - 60/12) = ceil(11-5)=6\n  T_max = floor(11 - 49/12) = floor(11-4.083)=floor(6.917)=6\n  So only at T=6? But T=6 is in the past? (we start at T=11) -> so no problem.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12)\n  T_min = ceil(11 - 12/12) = ceil(11-1)=10\n  T_max = floor(11 - 1/12) = floor(10.916)=10\n  So unsafe at T=10? But T=10 is also in the past? \n\nBut wait: at T=11: \n  For the second car: \n    tail: 1 + 12*(11-11)=1\n    head: 12+0=12 -> span [1,12] -> does not include 0? so safe.\n\nBut note: T_min and T_max: \n  For the second car: \n    T_min = ceil(11 - 12/12) = ceil(10) = 10\n    T_max = floor(11 - 1/12) = floor(11 - 0.083)=10\n  So only T=10 is unsafe.\n\nAt T=10: \n  tail: 1 + 12*(10-11)=1-12=-11\n  head:12-12=0 -> so the span is [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nBut T=10 is before our start (we start at T=11) so we don't care.\n\nNow freeway 8: \n  First car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n    T_min = ceil(11 - (-36)/12) = ceil(11+3)=14\n    T_max = floor(11 - (-47)/12)=floor(11+47/12)=floor(11+3.916)=14.916->14? \n    But let me compute: \n      T_min = ceil(11 - (-36)/12) = ceil(11+3)=14\n      T_max = floor(11 - (-47)/12)=floor(11 + 47/12)=floor(14.916)=14\n    So only T=14.\n\n    Check T=14: \n      tail: -47 + 12*(14-11) = -47+36=-11\n      head: -36+36=0 -> so [ -11, 0 ] -> unsafe.\n\n  Second car: (12,1,right,12) -> same as above: unsafe only at T=10 (in the past).\n\nSo freeway 8: unsafe at T=14.\n\nNow, let's summarize the unsafe times for each freeway (for T>=11):\n\nFreeway 1: never unsafe (for T>=11)\nFreeway 2,3,4: unsafe at T=18,19\nFreeway 5,6,7: safe at all T>=11 (because the unsafe times were T=6 and T=10, both <11)\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=14\n\nBut note: freeways 2,3,4 are identical? and they are unsafe at T=18,19.\n\nWe are starting at T=11, y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can simulate the moves:\n\nWe'll do a BFS:\n\nState: (t, y) where t is relative time (step count, starting at 0) and y is the row.\nAbsolute time T = 11 + t.\n\nWe start at (0,1).\n\nWe want to reach (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\nActions: U, D, S -> new y: y+1, y-1, y (if within [0,9]).\n\nWe must check that when we are at (t,y) (so absolute time T=11+t) then if y is in [1,8], we must check that the freeway y is safe at T.\n\nNote: if we move from y to y+1 at step t (relative time t), then at absolute time T=11+t we are on freeway y (so we check freeway y at T) and then at the next step we are on y+1 at time T+1.\n\nSo the state we are checking is: at relative time t, we are at y, which means at absolute time 11+t, we are at y.\n\nWe must avoid states where y in [1,8] and freeway y is unsafe at time 11+t.\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS. We mark visited states (t,y) to avoid cycles. But note: the unsafe conditions change with time, so we might have to revisit the same y at a different t. However, since time only moves forward, and we are doing BFS by time, we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait (by using S) to avoid an unsafe time.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nt=0 (absolute T=11): y=1.\n  Freeway 1: safe -> we can start.\n\nWe consider the actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we start at y=1. We can do:\n\nOption 1: U -> then at t=1, y=2, absolute T=12.\n\nOption 2: D -> then at t=1, y=0, absolute T=12.\n\nOption 3: S -> then at t=1, y=1, absolute T=12.\n\nNow, we must check the safety at the next state (t=1, y) at T=12.\n\nBut note: at the state (t=0, y=1) we are safe, but we are going to choose an action and then the next state is at t=1.\n\nWe'll build a tree.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of actions) so that at the end of H actions we are at y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS by the time step.\n\nWe'll keep an array for the relative time t from 0 to ... until we find the goal.\n\nWe also note that we cannot go above 9 or below 0.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nt (relative) | absolute T | y | from previous | safe? | action taken to get here\n\nBut we'll do:\n\nInitialize: \n  state (0,1) -> safe? yes (freeway1 at T=11: safe) -> mark visited.\n\nQueue: [ (0,1, []) ]   # (t, y, path_so_far)\n\nThen we expand:\n\nAt (0,1): \n  actions: U, D, S.\n\n  U: t=1, y=2 -> absolute T=12.\n      Check freeway 2 at T=12: unsafe? \n        Freeway2: unsafe at T=18,19 -> so at T=12: safe.\n      So state (1,2) is safe -> enqueue.\n\n  D: t=1, y=0 -> safe (no car) -> enqueue.\n\n  S: t=1, y=1 -> freeway1 at T=12: \n        car: [40+3*(12-11), 51+3*(12-11)] = [43,54] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe -> enqueue.\n\nNow, we consider states at t=1.\n\nState (1,2): \n  Actions: U -> y=3, T=13\n           D -> y=1, T=13\n           S -> y=2, T=13\n\n  We check the next state at T=13 (absolute):\n\n    For (2,3): freeway3 at T=13: unsafe? freeway3 has same cars as freeway2: unsafe at T=18,19 -> so safe at T=13 -> safe.\n    For (2,1): freeway1 at T=13: [40+3*2,51+3*2]=[46,57] -> safe.\n    For (2,2): freeway2 at T=13: safe (not 18,19) -> safe.\n\nState (1,0): \n  Actions: U -> y=1, T=13\n           D -> y=-1 -> invalid.\n           S -> y=0, T=13 -> safe.\n\n    (2,1): freeway1 at T=13: safe (as above) -> safe.\n    (2,0): safe.\n\nState (1,1): \n  Actions: U->y=2, T=13; D->y=0, T=13; S->y=1, T=13.\n\n    (2,2): freeway2 at T=13: safe -> safe.\n    (2,0): safe.\n    (2,1): freeway1 at T=13: safe.\n\nWe continue. We want to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut note: we must avoid freeway8 at T=14 (absolute time 14) because it is unsafe.\n\nAbsolute time 14: relative time t = 14 - 11 = 3.\n\nSo at t=3 (absolute T=14), we must not be on freeway8.\n\nWe'll simulate step by step until we find a path to y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we hit y=9.\n\nBut note: we can only move one step per turn. The minimal number of steps is 8 (if we go straight up). But we might have to detour or wait.\n\nHowever, let's try to go straight up:\n\nStart: t0: y=1 (T=11, safe)\n\nt1: U -> y=2 (T=12, freeway2: safe)\n\nt2: U -> y=3 (T=13, freeway3: safe)\n\nt3: U -> y=4 (T=14, freeway4: safe? freeway4 has the same cars as freeway2: unsafe at T=18,19 -> so safe at T=14. \n        But note: freeway8 is unsafe at T=14, but we are on freeway4 -> safe.\n\nt4: U -> y=5 (T=15, freeway5: safe at all T>=11 -> safe)\n\nt5: U -> y=6 (T=16, freeway6: safe)\n\nt6: U -> y=7 (T=17, freeway7: safe)\n\nt7: U -> y=8 (T=18, freeway8: unsafe? freeway8 is unsafe at T=14? and also we have freeway2,3,4 unsafe at T=18,19.\n\n        But freeway8: we computed unsafe at T=14 only? \n        And at T=18: freeway8: \n          First car: (-36,-47,right,12): at T=18: \n             tail: -47+12*(18-11)= -47+12*7 = -47+84=37\n             head: -36+84=48 -> [37,48] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe?\n          Second car: (12,1,right,12): at T=18: \n             tail: 1+12*7=1+84=85\n             head:12+84=96 -> [85,96] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\n        So freeway8 is safe at T=18.\n\n        But freeway8 was only unsafe at T=14? \n\n        However, we are at freeway8 at T=18 -> safe.\n\n        But wait: freeway2,3,4 are unsafe at T=18? and we are on freeway8 -> so we don't care.\n\n        So safe.\n\nt8: U -> y=9 (T=19, at T=19: we are at y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo we can go straight up in 8 moves? \n\nBut at T=19, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut let me check the move at t7: at T=18 we are at y=8 -> safe? yes, as above.\n\nThen at t8: we move U to y=9 at T=19 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence: 8 moves of U.\n\nBut what about the freeway2,3,4 at T=18? We are not on freeway2,3,4 at T=18, we are on freeway8 at T=18 -> safe.\n\nSo the path: \n  t0 (T=11): start at y=1 -> then U (to y=2 at T=12)\n  t1: U (to y=3 at T=13)\n  t2: U (to y=4 at T=14)\n  t3: U (to y=5 at T=15)\n  t4: U (to y=6 at T=16)\n  t5: U (to y=7 at T=17)\n  t6: U (to y=8 at T=18)\n  t7: U (to y=9 at T=19)\n\nBut note: at T=18, we are at y=8 -> we checked: freeway8 at T=18: safe.\n\nAt T=19, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: the problem says we must avoid collisions. Are we safe at every step?\n\nAt T=11: y=1 -> safe (freeway1: [40,51] -> safe)\nAt T=12: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at T=18,19? at T=12: \n  freeway2: car: [-53+6*(12-11), -42+6*1] = [-47, -36] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\nAt T=13: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2: [-53+6*2, -42+12] = [-41, -30] -> safe.\nAt T=14: y=4 -> freeway4: [-53+6*3, -42+18] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\nAt T=15: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (as per precomputation: both cars safe at T>=11)\nAt T=16: y=6 -> same as freeway5: safe.\nAt T=17: y=7 -> safe.\nAt T=18: y=8 -> freeway8: \n  first car: [-47+12*7, -36+84] = [-47+84, -36+84] = [37,48] -> safe.\n  second car: [1+84, 12+84] = [85,96] -> safe.\nAt T=19: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the current turn is t1=11, and we are starting at (0,1). We take 8 actions: from t1=11 to t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+7. Then at the end of the 8th action, we are at turn t1+8 = 19, at y=9.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So t from 0 to 7.\n\nSo the actions: \n  a_{11} = U\n  a_{12} = U\n  a_{13} = U\n  a_{14} = U\n  a_{15} = U\n  a_{16} = U\n  a_{17} = U\n  a_{18} = U\n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn t1=11, and we start by taking action a_{t1} = a_{11}. Then the next action is a_{12}, etc.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut wait: at turn 18, we are at y=8 and we take U to go to y=9 at turn 19. And the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn 19.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (so H actions) and then at the end, after the last action, we are at the state at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we are at turn 11+H = 19 -> H=8.\n\nBut let me check the moves:\n\nAt turn 11: we start at (0,1). Then we do a_{11}=U -> at turn 12, we are at (0,2).\n\nAt turn 12: a_{12}=U -> at turn 13: (0,3)\n\n...\n\nAt turn 18: a_{18}=U -> at turn 19: (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=8 is the minimal because we have to go from 1 to 9: 8 steps up.\n\nBut what about going down? that would take more steps. So 8 is minimal.\n\nBut we must ensure that we don't run into an unsafe condition at T=14 on freeway8? But we are on freeway4 at T=14 -> safe.\n\nAnd at T=14, freeway4 is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8 at T=14: we are not on it.\n\nSo the path is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 consecutive U moves.\n\nBut let me write the answer in the box.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nOutput:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the absolute turn numbers: the actions are taken at the specified turns.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nHere, t1=11, so the actions are for turns: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.\n\nYes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there is a path that avoids freeway8 at T=14? We don't need to because we are not on freeway8 at T=14.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait? But that would take more than 8 steps.\n\nSo we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 11 to turn 18, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\n### Verification of Path Safety:\n- **Turn 11 (absolute time 11)**: Player at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1).

Since I start at y=2 and need to get to y=9, that's a difference of 7, so minimum moves if I only go up would be 7 turns, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more.\n\nBut let's see the car positions and how they move.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I have cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right means increasing x, so for right-moving cars, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, and at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let me check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (54,43,right,3) — head 54, tail 43? That can't be right if it's right-moving. For right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (54,43,right,3). But if it's right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h. Here head=54, tail=43, and 43<54, so τ=43, h=54? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, head is the front, which is larger x.\n\nIn the span for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h] with τ < h, so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume, but it says [h, τ] for left, which might have h > τ or not, but typically head is front.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor direction:\n\n- If d = right, then at time t, span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I think. In the update, for right: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nNow, for freeway 1: (54,43,right,3) so h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=3. Since τ=43 < h=54, that's fine.\n\nFreeway 2: (-36,-47,right,6) h=-36, τ=-47? -36 > -47, so τ=-47, h=-36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t1=12.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same as 2.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12) two cars.\n\nSimilarly for 6 and 7.\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-35,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThat is, for a car on freeway k, if I am on y=k at turn T, and 0 is in [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] where Δt = T - t1.\n\nt1=12.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each time, whether there is a car such that 0 is in that interval.\n\nBut I need to do this for the times when I might be on that row.\n\nSince I start at y=2 at t=12, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so I need to pass through each of them or skip some, but since I can only change by 1 each turn, I have to go through each y from 2 to 9, but I start at 2, so I need to be on y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at some point. But not necessarily all, since I can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I might need to avoid certain rows at certain times.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, the times when a car occupies x=0.\n\nThat is, for a car on freeway k, at time T, if there exists a car such that 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] with Δt = T - 12.\n\nSince the span is continuous, I need min(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt), but since for right-moving, τ + s Δt ≤ h + s Δt always, so we need τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo for each car, the times when it blocks x=0 are when τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSolving for Δt:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\n0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ -h/s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nAnd since τ ≤ h, -h/s ≤ -τ/s, so the interval for Δt is from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s)? Let's think carefully.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h/s\n\nSecond, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince τ ≤ h, -h/s ≤ -τ/s, so Δt must satisfy:\n\nΔt ≥ ceil(-h/s) ? But Δt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - t1, integer.\n\nThe inequality: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSo lower bound: Δt ≥ ceil( -h/s ) ? Let's see.\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s Δt, so s Δt ≥ -h, so Δt ≥ ceil(-h/s)\n\nSimilarly, from τ + s Δt ≤ 0, s Δt ≤ -τ, so Δt ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nBecause if s Δt ≤ -τ, since Δt integer, Δt ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nSimilarly, Δt ≥ ceil(-h/s)\n\nThen, for the car to cover x=0 at time T, Δt must be integer with ceil(-h/s) ≤ Δt ≤ floor(-τ/s)\n\nBut only if ceil(-h/s) ≤ floor(-τ/s), otherwise no time.\n\nNow, let's compute for each car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, h=54, τ=43, s=3, d=right\n\nCompute -h/s = -54/3 = -18\n\n-τ/s = -43/3 ≈ -14.333\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-18) = -18\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(-14.333) = -15? floor of -14.333 is -15? No.\n\nfloor(x) is greatest integer ≤ x.\n\n-14.333, integers less than -14.333 are -15, -16, ..., but -15 = -15.0 < -14.333? -15.0 < -14.333 is true, but -15 is smaller.\n\n-14.333, floor is -15, since -15 ≤ -14.333 < -14.\n\nSimilarly, ceil is smallest integer >= x, ceil(-14.333) = -14.\n\nSimilarly, -18.0, ceil(-18) = -18, floor(-18) = -18.\n\nNow for this car:\n\n-h/s = -54/3 = -18\n\n-τ/s = -43/3 ≈ -14.3333\n\nThen Δt ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-18) = -18\n\nΔt ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor(-14.333) = -15\n\nNow, -18 ≤ Δt ≤ -15\n\nBut Δt = T - t1 = T - 12\n\nT is turn, so for T from 12 + (-18) to 12 + (-15), so T from -6 to -3? That doesn't make sense, turns can't be negative.\n\nΔt from -18 to -15, so T from 12-18= -6 to 12-15= -3, which is before current time, so at current time and future, no issue.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, T=12, τ + s*0 =43, h+s*0=54, 43 to 54, 0 not in, since 0<43.\n\nAs Δt increases, the car moves right, so span moves right, so at future times, since both ends positive and increasing, 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at no future time is x=0 covered, since min position is 43 at t1 and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: car with h=-36, τ=-47, s=6, d=right\n\n- h/s = -(-36)/6? h=-36, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-36)/6? -h/s = - ( -36 ) / 6 = 36/6 = 6\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- h/s = - ( -36 ) / 6 = 36/6 = 6\n\n- τ/s = - ( -47 ) / 6 = 47/6 ≈ 7.833\n\nThen Δt ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil(6) = 6\n\nΔt ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor(47/6) = floor(7.833) = 7\n\nSo Δt from 6 to 7 inclusive.\n\nThus at T = t1 + Δt = 12 + 6 = 18 to 12 + 7 = 19.\n\nSo on freeway 2, x=0 is occupied at turns 18 and 19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car: (-36,-47,right,6) so same, occupied at T=18,19.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, occupied at T=18,19.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48? τ=-59? Let's see.\n\nCars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59? head and tail.\n\nSince right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t1.\n\ns=12\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/12 = 48/12 = 4\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/12 = 59/12 ≈ 4.9167\n\nThen Δt ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil(4) = 4\n\nΔt ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor(59/12) = floor(4.9167) = 4\n\nSince 4.9167, floor is 4.\n\nSo Δt ≥ 4 and Δt ≤ 4, so Δt=4\n\nThus at T=12+4=16\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\n- h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\n- τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.0833\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-2) = -2\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(-13/12) = floor(-1.0833) = -2? -1.0833, floor is -2, since -2 < -1.0833 < -1, so floor is -2.\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(-2) = -2\n\nΔt ≥ ceil(-h/s) = -2\n\nΔt ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor(-13/12) = floor(-1.0833) = -2\n\nSo Δt = -2\n\nT=12 + (-2) = 10, which is past, not future.\n\nSo only the first car blocks at T=16.\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, I think? Cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12) same as freeway 5.\n\nSo occupied at T=16.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 8: cars (-24,-35,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) h=-24, τ=-35\n\n- h/s = -(-24)/12 = 24/12 = 2\n\n- τ/s = -(-35)/12 = 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nΔt ≥ ceil(2) = 2\n\nΔt ≤ floor(35/12) = floor(2.9167) = 2\n\nSo Δt=2, T=12+2=14\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) same as before, blocks at T=10, past.\n\nSo only at T=14 for freeway 8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when x=0 is occupied (collision if on that row at that time):\n\nFreeway 1: never in future\n\nFreeway 2: T=18,19\n\nFreeway 3: T=18,19\n\nFreeway 4: T=18,19\n\nFreeway 5: T=16\n\nFreeway 6: T=16\n\nFreeway 7: T=16\n\nFreeway 8: T=14\n\nI start at y=2 at t=12.\n\ny=2 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, I am on y_t.\n\nFreeways are rows y=1 to 8, where cars are.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at (0,2), so at t=12, I am on freeway 2.\n\nNow, at t=12, is freeway 2 occupied? We have for freeway 2, it is occupied at T=18,19, not at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, for freeway 2, Δt=0, τ + s*0 = -47, h + s*0 = -36, so [-47,-36], 0 not in, since -36 < 0? -36 is negative, so 0 > -36, but -36 to -47? τ=-47, h=-36, so span [-47,-36], which is from -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in, since 0 > -36? -36 is larger than -47, so -47 to -36, min -47, max -36, so x from -47 to -36, all x <= -36 < 0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, all freeways might be safe except we need to check for the times we care.\n\nBut at start, t=12, y=2, freeway 2, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical times are when certain rows are blocked at certain times.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it is blocked.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Freeway 2: blocked at t=18,19\n\n- Freeway 3: blocked at t=18,19\n\n- Freeway 4: blocked at t=18,19\n\n- Freeway 5: blocked at t=16\n\n- Freeway 6: blocked at t=16\n\n- Freeway 7: blocked at t=16\n\n- Freeway 8: blocked at t=14\n\nFreeway 1 is always safe.\n\nI start at y=2 at t=12.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2.\n\nNow, at t=12, I am on y=2, which is safe since not blocked.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path: I need to be on y=2, then to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I can stay or move down, but to minimize time, I should move up when possible.\n\nThe dangerous times are t=14 for y=8, t=16 for y=5,6,7, and t=18,19 for y=2,3,4.\n\nSince I start at t=12, I can try to go up quickly before the blocks or after.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go directly up.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn from t=12.\n\nStart: t=12, y=2\n\nAction at t=12: U, then t=13, y=3\n\nAction at t=13: U, t=14, y=4\n\nAt t=14, y=4? Let's see the sequence.\n\nt=12: y=2\n\nAfter action at t=12, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy, depending on a_{12}\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}\n\nThe position at turn t is (0, y_t)\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn terms of collision: at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check if for that freeway, x=0 is occupied.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if y_T = k, and freeway k has a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, for the plan:\n\nStart at t=12, y=2.\n\nI need to choose actions for t=12, t=13, ..., until I reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn.\n\nI reach y=9 when after some action, y_{t+H} =9, and I stop at turn t+H-1? Let's see.\n\nI start at turn t1=12, position y_{12}=2.\n\nI perform actions a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., a_{t1 + H-1} for H turns? After H actions, I have done H moves, and I am at y_{12 + H}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=12 to t=12 + H -1, so H actions, and after that, at turn t=12 + H, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nSince I start at t=12, y=2, and I want y_{12+H} =9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to end is H, meaning I perform H actions, and at turn 12+H, I am at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn 12+H, y=2, not 9.\n\nI need to increase y by 7, so minimum H=7, with all U actions.\n\nBut may not be possible due to cars.\n\nIn this case, with all U:\n\nt=12: y=2, action a_{12}, then y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy, if U, y_{13}=3\n\nSimilarly, a_{13}: U, y_{14}=4\n\na_{14}: U, y_{15}=5\n\na_{15}: U, y_{16}=6\n\na_{16}: U, y_{17}=7\n\na_{17}: U, y_{18}=8\n\na_{18}: U, y_{19}=9\n\nNow, at which turns am I on which freeway?\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nt=12: y=2, freeway 2, not blocked (as we saw)\n\nt=13: y=3, freeway 3, not blocked except at t=18,19, t=13 is early, so safe.\n\nt=14: y=4, freeway 4, not blocked except t=18,19, so safe at t=14.\n\nt=15: y=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 is blocked at t=16, but at t=15, is it blocked?\n\nFor freeway 5, we have only at t=16 blocked.\n\nAt t=15, Δt=15-12=3\n\nFor first car on y=5: τ + s Δt = -59 + 12*3 = -59 + 36 = -23\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 36 = -12\n\nSpan [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ + s Δt =13 + 12*3=13+36=49? τ=13, s=12, Δt=3, τ + s Δt =13+36=49, h + s Δt=24+36=60, span [49,60], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=15, freeway 5 safe.\n\nt=16: y=6? In the sequence above, at t=15, y=5, action a_{15}=U, so y_{16}=6.\n\nAt turn t=16, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 is blocked at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, freeway 6: cars, same as freeway 5.\n\nFirst car: τ + s Δt = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11? Δt=16-12=4\n\nτ + s Δt = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since h + s Δt =0.\n\nThus, collision if on freeway 6 at t=16.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=16, y=6, on freeway 6, and it is blocked, so collision.\n\nThus, not possible.\n\nIf I go up, at t=16 I am on y=6, which is blocked.\n\nBut y=6 is freeway 6, blocked at t=16.\n\nIn the sequence, I could be on different y.\n\nIn all U, from t=12 to t=18:\n\nt=12: y=2\n\nt=13: y=3\n\nt=14: y=4\n\nt=15: y=5\n\nt=16: y=6 → collision\n\nYes.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=6 at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=16? Freeway 5 blocked at t=16, so if on y=5 at t=16, collision.\n\ny=7 at t=16, freeway 7 blocked at t=16.\n\nSo at t=16, freeways 5,6,7 are all blocked.\n\nFreeway 8 blocked at t=14.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nI need to not be on y=5,6,7 at t=16.\n\nAlso, for y=8, blocked at t=14, so not on y=8 at t=14.\n\nAnd y=2,3,4 blocked at t=18,19.\n\nSince I start early, t=12, I might go up before t=16 or after.\n\nt=16 is only 4 turns after start.\n\nCurrent turn t=12.\n\nI can reach y=5 before t=16.\n\nFor example, if I go up faster? But I can only go up one per turn.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=12, to y=5, I need 3 up moves.\n\nt=12: start y=2\n\na_{12}=U, t=13, y=3\n\na_{13}=U, t=14, y=4\n\na_{14}=U, t=15, y=5\n\nNow at t=15, y=5, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen at t=15, I need to go to y=6, but if I go U at t=15, y_{16}=6, then at t=16, y=6, collision.\n\nIf I stay, a_{15}=S, then y_{16}=5, but at t=16, y=5, freeway 5 blocked at t=16, so collision.\n\nIf I go down, a_{15}=D, y_{16}=4.\n\nBut y=4 at t=16, freeway 4 is not blocked at t=16, only at t=18,19.\n\nAt t=16, freeway 4: Δt=4, for freeway 4, cars: same as freeway 2,3? Freeway 4 has car (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nΔt=4, τ + s Δt = -47 + 6*4 = -47 + 24 = -23\n\nh + s Δt = -36 + 24 = -12\n\nSpan [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo at t=16, if I am on y=4, it is safe.\n\nBut I want to go up, not down.\n\nFrom t=15, y=5, if I go down to y=4 at t=16, then I have to go back up, which takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could be on y=5 at t=15, and instead of moving at t=15, I could have moved earlier or later.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=4 or something and wait, but I need to avoid the block at t=16 for y=5,6,7.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 blocked at t=16, I should not be on those rows at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 blocked at t=14.\n\nt=14 is soon.\n\nAt t=14, I could be on lower rows.\n\nLet me list the safe times.\n\nFor each freeway, the times when it is unsafe (blocked):\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=18,19\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=18,19\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=18,19\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=16\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=16\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=16\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=14\n\nNow, I start at t=12, y=2.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up to y=8 or 9 before the blocks or after.\n\nFirst, can I reach y=8 before t=14?\n\nt=14 is turn 14, current t=12.\n\nFrom t=12 to t=14, I can do two moves.\n\nAt t=12, y=2\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy\n\nIf a_{12}=U, y_{13}=3\n\nThen a_{13}, if U, y_{14}=4\n\nBut I want y=8, which is far.\n\nTo reach y=8, from y=2, I need 6 up moves.\n\nMinimum 6 turns: t=12 to t=18, y=8 at t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, y=8, is it safe? Freeway 8 is only unsafe at t=14, at other times safe.\n\nAt t=18, for freeway 8: Δt=18-12=6\n\nFirst car: τ + s Δt = -35 + 12*6 = -35 + 72 = 37\n\nh + s Δt = -24 + 72 = 48? Car (-24,-35,right,12), so τ=-35, h=-24\n\nτ + s Δt = -35 + 12*6 = -35 + 72 = 37\n\nh + s Δt = -24 + 72 = 48\n\nSpan [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ=13, h=24, s=12, Δt=6, τ + s Δt=13+72=85, h + s Δt=24+72=96, [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4 unsafe at t=18,19, but y=8 is fine.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=18.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=12, to y=8 at t=18, that's 6 turns, with all U.\n\nBut at t=18, y=8, then I can go to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nt=12: y=2, action a_{12}, say U, then y_{13}=3\n\nt=13: y=3, action a_{13}, U, y_{14}=4\n\nt=14: y=4, action a_{14}, U, y_{15}=5\n\nt=15: y=5, action a_{15}, U, y_{16}=6\n\nBut at t=16, y=6, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem at t=16.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=16 I am on y=6.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=16.\n\nSo for t=16, I should be on y <=4 or y=8 or 9, but y=8 at t=16 might be possible.\n\ny=8 at t=16: is it safe? Freeway 8 unsafe only at t=14, at t=16 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=16 is safe, as we saw.\n\ny=3 at t=16: freeway 3, unsafe only at t=18,19, so at t=16 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,1,0,9 all safe.\n\nSo at t=16, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9, but not 5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, I should not be on y=8.\n\nAt t=14, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nOther rows are safe at t=14.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nI am at y=2, t=12.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince t=16 is a problem for y=5,6,7, I can either be below or above at that time.\n\nIf I can be above y=7 by t=16, that would be good.\n\nBut from t=12 to t=16, I have 4 actions (t=12,13,14,15), so I can increase y by up to 4.\n\nStart y=2, after 4 U, y_{16} = 2+4=6.\n\ny_{16} = y after actions up to t=15.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_{t-1}, but let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is position.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} set.\n\nSo from t=12 to t=16, there are 4 actions: a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} determine y_{13}, y_{14}, y_{15}, y_{16}.\n\ny_{16} = y_{12} + sum of Δy from t=12 to 15.\n\nEach Δy +1,0,-1.\n\nMax y_{16} = 2 +4 =6 if all U.\n\nMin y_{16} =2-4= -2, but y min 0, so at least 0.\n\nWith all U, y_{16}=6.\n\nBut at t=16, y=6 is unsafe.\n\nIf I do only 3 U and one S, y_{16}=5, still unsafe.\n\nOr 2U,2S, y_{16}=4, safe.\n\nOr 3U,1D, y_{16}=4, etc.\n\nBut y=4 at t=16 is safe, but I am only at y=4, while I need to go to y=9, so I have to go up later, but then I might hit the later blocks at t=18,19 for y=2,3,4.\n\nAnother option is to go up slowly or wait.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should avoid delays.\n\nI could go up to y=4 quickly and wait at y=4 until after t=16, but y=4 is unsafe at t=18,19, so I need to leave before that.\n\nt=18,19 are later.\n\nLet's think about the timing.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is t=19 with all U, but in all U, at t=16 I have collision.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=7 or 8 before t=16.\n\nBut with 4 actions from t=12 to t=15, max y_{16}=6, as above.\n\ny_{16} is after actions up to a_{15}.\n\nTo have y_{16} <=4 or >=8, but max 6, min 0, so y_{16} <=4 possible, or y_{16}=6, but 6 unsafe, or 5,7 not possible since only integer steps.\n\ny_{16} can be 2 to 6, or less.\n\nCannot be 7 or 8 at t=16 with 4 actions from y=2.\n\nSo at t=16, I must be on y<=4, since y=5,6,7 unsafe.\n\nSo y_{16} <=4.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=8 at t=14, so at t=14, y_{14} !=8.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nStart t=12, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 with min H.\n\nH is the number of actions, so that at turn 12+H, y=9.\n\nMin H=7 if possible.\n\nBut with collision at t=16 in the direct path.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=6 at t=16 or earlier.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=16 I am on y=6 because I went up all the way.\n\nI could delay going up or go down temporarily.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are unsafe at t=16, I can be on y=4 at t=16, then after t=16, go up.\n\nBut after t=16, at t=17, I can go to y=5, etc.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 are unsafe at t=18,19, so I need to be above y=4 by t=18.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nSuppose at t=16, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=16, from y=2 at t=12.\n\nI need to go from y=2 to y=4 in 4 actions? From t=12 to t=16, 4 actions determine y_{13} to y_{16}.\n\ny_{12}=2\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} = 2 + Δy12\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy13\n\nAfter a_{14}, y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy14\n\nAfter a_{15}, y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy15\n\nI want y_{16} =4, for example.\n\nAlso, during the path, I need to avoid collision at each turn.\n\nFor example, at t=12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I choose a_{12}, say U, then y_{13}=3.\n\nAt t=13, y=3, freeway 3, safe at t=13 (since unsafe only t=18,19).\n\nThen a_{13}, if U, y_{14}=4.\n\nAt t=14, y=4, freeway 4, safe at t=14.\n\nThen a_{14}, if I do S, y_{15}=4.\n\nAt t=15, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nThen a_{15}, if I do S, y_{16}=4.\n\nAt t=16, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from here, I can go up.\n\nt=16, y=4, action a_{16}, if U, y_{17}=5.\n\nAt t=17, y=5, freeway 5, is it safe? Freeway 5 unsafe only at t=16, so at t=17, Δt=17-12=5\n\nFirst car: τ + s Δt = -59 +12*5 = -59+60=1, h + s Δt = -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ + s Δt=13+60=73, h + s Δt=24+60=84, [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, t=17, y=5, action a_{17}=U, y_{18}=6.\n\nAt t=18, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 6 unsafe at t=16, but at t=18, Δt=6\n\nFirst car: τ + s Δt = -59 +12*6 = -59+72=13, h + s Δt = -48+72=24, span [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: 13+72=85, 24+72=96, [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at t=18.\n\nThen a_{18}=U, y_{19}=7.\n\nAt t=19, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nUnsafe at t=16, at t=19: Δt=7\n\nFirst car: -59 +12*7 = -59+84=25, -48+84=36, [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car:13+84=97,24+84=108, [97,108],0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8.\n\nAt t=20, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nUnsafe at t=14, at t=20: Δt=8\n\nFirst car: τ + s Δt = -35 +12*8 = -35+96=61, h + s Δt = -24+96=72, [61,72]\n\nSecond car:13+96=109,24+96=120, [109,120],0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen a_{20}=U, y_{21}=9.\n\nAt t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=12 to t=21, that's 9 turns? t=21 is turn 21, started at 12, so 9 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=20, that's 9 actions: a12 to a20, and at t=21, y=9.\n\nH=9, but min should be less.\n\nIn this sequence, I wasted time at y=4.\n\nFrom t=16 y=4, I went to y=5 at t=17, y=6 at t=18, y=7 at t=19, y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21. That's 5 turns to go from y=4 to y=9, which is inefficient.\n\nSince after t=16, no immediate blocks, I can go up faster.\n\nBut from t=16, y=4, I can do U multiple times.\n\nIn the sequence above, I did U at t=16,17,18,19,20 to go from 4 to 9 in 5 steps.\n\nBut I can do it in 5 steps, yes, since difference 5.\n\nBut earlier from t=12 to t=16, I went from y=2 to y=4 in 4 steps with only 2 ups and 2 stays? In my sequence: at t=12, a12=U, y13=3; t=13, a13=U, y14=4; t=14, a14=S, y15=4; t=15, a15=S, y16=4. So I used 2 U and 2 S to be at y=4 at t=16.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=21, so 9 actions.\n\nBut min is 7, so I can do better.\n\nI could be at a higher position earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=16, instead of y=4, I could be at y=3 or 2, but that would be worse.\n\nOr, I could go up to y=5 or 6 before t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, I cannot be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSo the latest I can be on y=5 is t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=5 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=15: freeway 6, at t=15, Δt=3, τ + s Δt = -59 +12*3 = -59+36= -23, h + s Δt = -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12],0 not in. Second car:13+36=49,24+36=60,[49,60],0 not in. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=15: freeway 7, same as above, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=15: freeway 8, at t=15, Δt=3, first car: τ + s Δt = -35 +12*3 = -35+36=1, h + s Δt = -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in? 1 to 12, 0 not included since min 1>0.\n\n0 not in [1,12].\n\nSecond car:13+36=49,24+36=60,[49,60],0 not in. Safe.\n\nBut at t=14, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo at t=15, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=8 at t=15.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=15.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=12, to y=8 at t=15.\n\nThat requires increasing y by 6 in 3 actions? From t=12 to t=15, actions a12,a13,a14 determine y13,y14,y15.\n\ny12=2\n\ny13 = 2 + Δy12\n\ny14 = y13 + Δy13\n\ny15 = y14 + Δy14\n\nI want y15=8.\n\nSo need to increase by 6 in 3 steps, but each step max +1, so max y15=2+3=5, cannot reach 8 in 3 steps.\n\nImpossible to be at y=8 before t=15.\n\nEarliest at t=18 with all U, as before.\n\nBut at t=18, if I am on y=8, it is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=18, from y=2 at t=12, need 6 U, so t=12 to t=17 actions U, y18=8.\n\nThen a18=U, y19=9.\n\nBut during the path, at t=16, I will be on y=6 if I go all U, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nFor example, at some point, I can stay or go down to not be on y=5,6,7 at t=16.\n\nLet's list the turns from t=12 to t=18.\n\nI need y_t for t=12 to 18.\n\nAt t=12, y=2.\n\nI want y_{18}=8.\n\nThen y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, for t=16, y_{16} must not be 5,6,7.\n\nAlso, at t=14, y_{14} must not be 8.\n\nOther times, all rows are safe except as above.\n\nFor example, if I go all U except at some point I adjust for t=16.\n\nSuppose I go U at t=12,13,14, then at t=15 I need to not go U if it would put me at risk, but let's see.\n\nStart:\n\nt=12: y=2, action a12=U, so y13=3\n\nt=13: y=3, action a13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14: y=4, action a14, if U, y15=5\n\nThen t=15: y=5, action a15, if U, y16=6, but at t=16 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf a15=S, y16=5, at t=16 y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf a15=D, y16=4, then at t=16 y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut y16=4, then to y8, need 4 U, so y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, then y21=9, takes longer.\n\nAfter y16=4, I can go U multiple, but still.\n\nTo reach y18=8, from y16=4, I need two U: y17=5, y18=6, only to y=6, not 8.\n\ny16=4, a16=U, y17=5; a17=U, y18=6; a18=U, y19=7; etc. Not to 8.\n\nIf I am at y16=4, to reach y=8 at some turn.\n\nBut I want to minimize H, so I should reach high y as soon as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 is always safe, I can go to y=1 and stay, but that is lower, worse.\n\nOr, I can be on y=8 at t=15, but impossible as above.\n\nt=15 y=8 impossible.\n\nAt t=16, I can be on y=4, as above.\n\nBut let's accept that and see if I can reach y=9 faster.\n\nFrom t=12 to t=16 with y16=4, as before: a12=U, y13=3; a13=U, y14=4; then to have y16=4, I can do a14=S, y15=4; a15=S, y16=4.\n\nOr a14=D, y15=3; a15=U, y16=4, etc., but similar.\n\nThen at t=16, y=4, safe.\n\nNow from here, I can go up quickly: a16=U, y17=5; t=17 y=5 safe (as earlier); a17=U, y18=6; t=18 y=6 safe; a18=U, y19=7; t=19 y=7 safe; a19=U, y20=8; t=20 y=8 safe; a20=U, y21=9.\n\nStill to t=21.\n\nBut at t=18, y=6, but I need to go to y=9, so more turns.\n\nSince after t=16, no blocks until t=18 for lower rows, but t=18,19 y=2,3,4 unsafe, but I am above.\n\nFrom t=16 y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t=17, then U to y=6 at t=18, but at t=18, y=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=19, U to y=8 at t=20, U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut I can go to y=8 directly from lower, but no.\n\nAnother point: at t=14, I can be on y=4, which is safe, and if I go U at t=14, y15=5, then at t=15 y=5 safe, but then at t=15 I have to choose action to avoid y=5,6,7 at t=16.\n\nIf I go U at t=15, y16=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I go S, y16=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, y16=4 safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo it seems I have to be at y<=4 at t=16.\n\nThen from there, it takes 5 more turns to y=9.\n\nTotal from t=12 to t=21, 9 turns.\n\nBut min H=7 might be possible if I can skip the block or something.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at t=15, then at t=15, if I go U, y16=8, then at t=16 y=8, which is safe.\n\nLet's see.\n\nCan I be at y=7 at t=15?\n\nFrom y=2 at t=12, to y=7 at t=15.\n\nIncrease by 5 in 3 steps: y15 = y12 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14\n\nMax increase 3, so y15 <= 2+3=5, cannot reach 7.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=15: y15 <=5, max 5.\n\ny=5 at t=15 possible, with 3 U: a12=U, y13=3; a13=U, y14=4; a14=U, y15=5.\n\nThen at t=15, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, action a15: if U, y16=6, unsafe at t=16.\n\nIf S, y16=5, unsafe at t=16.\n\nIf D, y16=4, safe at t=16.\n\nThen y16=4.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from y=4 at t=16, which takes 5 turns as before.\n\nIf I go D at t=15 to y16=4, then I was at y=5 at t=15, which is safe, but I moved down.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=16, same as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=5 before t=16, but t=16 is the only bad time for y=5.\n\nAt t=15, y=5 is safe, but at t=16, it is unsafe, so I have to leave y=5 before t=16.\n\nBut since I move at t=15, y16 is set based on a15.\n\nIf at t=15 I am on y=5, and I do not U or S, I must do D to go to y=4.\n\nThen I avoid the collision at t=16.\n\nBut I lost progress.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 at t=18, but avoid being on y=6 at t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=15, be on y=4 or 5, but with action that puts me safe at t=16.\n\nLet's list a sequence where I reach y=8 at t=18.\n\nFor that, I need to have y18=8.\n\nFrom y12=2, need net +6 in 6 actions: a12 to a17.\n\nActions a12 to a17 determine y13 to y18.\n\ny18 = y12 + sum_{t=12 to 17} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t in {-1,0,1}, sum at least 6, so must be all U, sum=6, y18=8.\n\nSo only way to have y18=8 is all U from a12 to a17.\n\nThen y13=3, y14=4, y15=5, y16=6, y17=7, y18=8.\n\nAt t=16, y=6, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=8 at t=18 with all U because of t=16 collision.\n\nIf I do not all U, y18<8, so I reach later.\n\nSo I have to reach y=9 after t=18.\n\nFor example, at t=19, y=9.\n\nTo have y19=9, from y12=2, need net +7 in 7 actions: a12 to a18.\n\nWith all U, y13=3, y14=4, y15=5, y16=6, y17=7, y18=8, y19=9.\n\nBut at t=16, y=6 collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo I must have a different action at some point to avoid being on y=6 at t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=15, instead of U, I do something else.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=15, if I am on y=5, and I do D, then y16=4, safe.\n\nThen y17=4 + Δy16, if U, y17=5; then y18=6 if U, etc.\n\nBut then y19=7 or less, not 9.\n\nLet's see:\n\nt=12: y=2, a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: y=3, a13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14: y=4, a14=U, y15=5\n\nt=15: y=5, a15=D, y16=4  (to avoid collision)\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, safe, a17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe (as earlier), a18=U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe, a19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, safe, a20=U, y21=9\n\nStill to t=21.\n\nFrom t=16 y=4, I can do multiple U, but each U takes one turn.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9, need 5 U actions, 5 turns.\n\nMinimum.\n\nBut in this sequence, I did a down action, which wasted a turn.\n\nInstead of going down at t=15, I could have stayed at lower y earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=14, I am at y=4, instead of going U to y=5 at t=15, I could stay at y=4.\n\nThen:\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14: y=4, a14=S, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, a15=S, y16=4  (safe at t=16)\n\nThen t=16: a16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: a17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: a18=U, y19=7\n\nt=19: a19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: a20=U, y21=9\n\nSame as before, 9 actions.\n\nTo save time, I need to be higher when I go up after t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=15, if I can be at y=5, but then at t=15 I have to go down to avoid t=16, but that loses.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 or 8 at t=15, impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 is always safe, I can go down to y=1 and stay there during the bad times, but that is lower, so it takes more turns to go up.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=8 after t=14 and before the lower blocks.\n\nBut t=18,19 have blocks for y=2,3,4, but I am above.\n\nLet's aim to be at y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut with all U, I have collision at t=16.\n\nSo I must modify the actions around t=16.\n\nSuppose at t=15, I am on y=4 (safe), then a15=U, but y16=5, which is unsafe at t=16.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I am at y=5 at t=15, a15=D, y16=4.\n\nBut y=5 at t=15 is safe, but I move down.\n\nThen at t=16, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=15, I need to have gone up earlier.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=5  (t=15 y=5 safe)\n\nt=15: a15=D, y16=4  (t=16 y=4 safe)\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: a17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: a18=U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, a19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, a20=U, y21=9\n\nStill 9 actions.\n\nFrom t=16 y=4, if I go U at t=16, y17=5; U at t=17, y18=6; but at t=18, y=6 is safe, as before.\n\nThen U at t=18, y19=7; U at t=19, y20=8; U at t=20, y21=9.\n\nSame.\n\nBut at t=18, I can go to y=7, etc.\n\nNotice that at t=18 and t=19, y=2,3,4 are unsafe, but if I am on y=6 at t=18, it is safe, as calculated.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut to save turns, I need to reach y=9 sooner.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at t=18, then y19=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=18, I need all U from a12 to a17, but then at t=16 y=6 collision.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be at y=8 is t=19 or later.\n\nFor example, with the down move, at t=17 I can be at y=5 or 6.\n\nIn the sequence with down move: at t=17, y=5 (from a16=U from y16=4)\n\nThen y18=6 if U, y19=7, not 8.\n\nSo to reach y=8 at t=19: y19=8.\n\nFrom y12=2, need net +6 in 7 actions? Actions a12 to a18 determine y13 to y19.\n\ny19 = y12 + sum_{t=12 to 18} Δy_t\n\nSum of 7 Δy, each -1,0,1, want y19=8, so sum Δy =6.\n\nSo I can have 6 U and one other action.\n\nFor example, 6 U and one S, or 6 U and one D, but if D, sum=5, y19=7, not 8.\n\nSo must be 6 U and one S, so that sum=6, y19=8.\n\nThe S can be at any point.\n\nNow, the sequence: y13=2 + Δy12, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid collision at t=16 on y=6.\n\nAlso at other points.\n\nSuppose I have all U except one S.\n\nFor example, suppose I S at t=15.\n\nThen:\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=5\n\nt=15: a15=S, y16=5  but at t=16 y=5, freeway 5 unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nS at t=16: t=15 y=5, a15=U, y16=6, at t=16 y=6 collision.\n\nS at t=14: t=14 y=4, a14=S, y15=4\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=5, at t=16 y=5 collision.\n\nS at t=13: t=13 y=3, a13=S, y14=3\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=4\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=5, collision at t=16.\n\nS at t=12: t=12 y=2, a12=S, y13=2\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=3\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=4\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=5, collision.\n\nS at t=17: but at t=17, if I am on y=6 or something.\n\nLet's list with S at t=17.\n\nt=12: a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: a13=U, y14=4\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=5\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=6  collision at t=16.\n\nBefore t=16 I have the problem.\n\nIf I S at t=16, but at t=16 I am on y, and if y=6, collision before action.\n\nThe collision is at turn T based on position, before action I think.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, then I choose action, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nSo if at t=16, y16=5,6, or7, collision.\n\nIn the all U with one S, to have y19=8, I must have y16=5 or6 or7, because from t=12 to t=16, 4 actions, y16 =2 + sum of 4 Δy, each at most 1, so y16 <=6, and since I have one S, it might be less, but in the sequence, with 3 U and one S by t=15, y16=5 or less, but if y16=5,6,7 collision.\n\nIf I have the S early, y16 might be lower.\n\nFor example, if S at t=12: a12=S, y13=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\na15=U, y16=5  collision at t=16\n\nIf S at t=13: a12=U, y13=3\n\na13=S, y14=3\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\na15=U, y16=5 collision\n\nS at t=14: a12=U, y13=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\na14=S, y15=4\n\na15=U, y16=5 collision\n\nS at t=15: a12=U, y13=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\na15=S, y16=5 collision\n\nS at t=16: a12=U, y13=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\na15=U, y16=6  at t=16 y=6 collision, before a16 action.\n\nSo no matter where I put the S, at t=16 I am on y=5 or 6, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I put S at t=17, but t=17 is after.\n\nIn the sequence for y19=8:\n\na12 to a18 actions.\n\ny16 is determined by a12 to a15.\n\ny16 = 2 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14 + Δy15\n\nWith 4 actions, to have y19=8, I need sum of 7 actions =6, so the sum of first 4 actions can be from 2 to 4, but y16 =2 + sum of 4 Δy\n\nSince each Δy <=1, y16 <=6, and for y19=8, the later actions can increase.\n\nBut at t=16, y16 must not be 5,6,7.\n\nSo y16 must be <=4 or 8, but 8 impossible, so y16 <=4.\n\nThen from y16 <=4, to y19=8, need increase by at least 4 in 3 actions, so possible only if y16=4 or 5, but y16<=4, so y16=4, then Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18 =4, so must be all U, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, but y19=7, not 8.\n\ny19 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\nIf y16=4, then to y19=8, need +4, so Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18 =4, so all U, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, so y19=7, not 8.\n\nIf y16=5, but y16<=4 to avoid collision, contradiction.\n\nIf y16=3, then to y19=8 need +5 in 3 steps, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, lower worse.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach y=9 before t=21 with the constraints.\n\nBut t=21 is late.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=20 or 19.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=1 at some point to avoid, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, since the blocks are at specific times, I can time to be on safe rows.\n\nFor example, at t=16, be on y=8.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=16, from y=2 at t=12, with 4 actions, max y16=6, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14, be on y=8, but from t=12 to t=14, 2 actions, max y14=4, impossible.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with a sequence like the one I had.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do it in 8 turns.\n\nSuppose H=8, so at turn t=12+8=20, y=9.\n\nActions a12 to a19.\n\ny20 = 2 + sum_{t=12 to 19} Δy_t =9, so sum of 8 Δy =7.\n\nSo 7 U and one S, or 6 U and 2 other, but sum=7, so 7 U and one S, or 8 U but y20=10>9 not allowed, so 7 U and one S.\n\ny20=9, from y12=2, so increase by 7, with 8 actions, so average less than 1, so possible with 7 U and one S.\n\nNow, I need to avoid collision at t=16.\n\ny16 = 2 + Δy12 + Δy13 + Δy14 + Δy15\n\nWith 4 actions, y16 <=6.\n\nAt t=16, y16 must not be 5,6,7, so y16 <=4.\n\nThen from y16 <=4, to y20=9, need increase by at least 5 in 4 actions (a16 to a19).\n\nWith 4 actions, max increase 4, so if y16=4, then need +5, impossible.\n\nIf y16=3, need +6, impossible.\n\nIf y16=4, need +5 in 4 actions, possible only if I can increase by 5, but max 4, impossible.\n\ny20 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18 + Δy19\n\nIf y16=4, then to y20=9, need +5, but only 4 actions, each max +1, so y20 <=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y16=5, but y16=5 is unsafe at t=16, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if y16=6, unsafe.\n\nSo it is impossible to have y20=9 with y16<=4.\n\nBecause if y16<=4, y20 <=4+4=8<9.\n\nIf y16=5,6,7, collision at t=16.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nSimilarly, for t=19, y19=9, need sum of 7 actions =7, all U.\n\nBut then y16=6, collision.\n\nWith one S, y19=8 or less.\n\nSo impossible before t=21.\n\nThus minimal H=9, with y21=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can use the one I had.\n\nBut in the sequence, I can choose when to stay or down.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible except when necessary to avoid.\n\nIn the first part, from t=12 to t=16, I need to be at y=4 at t=16.\n\nI can reach y=4 faster.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=12: y=2, a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: y=3, a13=U, y14=4\n\nNow at t=14, y=4, I can stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at t=14, a14=S, y15=4\n\nThen a15=S, y16=4\n\nOr, at t=14, I can go down to y=3, but that would be worse.\n\nOr, at t=15, I can go down, but if I am at y=4 at t=14, and I go U to y=5 at t=15, then I have to go down at t=15 to y=4 at t=16.\n\nBut that extra move down and up wastes turns.\n\nBetter to stay at y=4.\n\nSimilarly, after t=16, go all U to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 12: U  (y13=3)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y14=4)\n\nTurn 14: S  (y15=4)  // or I could do U, but then at t=15 I have to do D to avoid, which is worse.\n\nIf at t=14 I do U, y15=5, then at t=15 I must do D to y16=4, then I have y15=5 and y16=4, net no progress, wasted two actions for nothing.\n\nWhereas if I do S at t=14, I stay at y=4, no waste.\n\nSimilarly at t=15, S to stay.\n\nThen from t=16, U all way.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U  // to y=3 at t=13\n\nTurn 13: U  // to y=4 at t=14\n\nTurn 14: S  // stay y=4 at t=15\n\nTurn 15: S  // stay y=4 at t=16\n\nTurn 16: U  // to y=5 at t=17\n\nTurn 17: U  // to y=6 at t=18\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y=7 at t=19\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y=8 at t=20\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y=9 at t=21\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=12: y=2, freeway 2, not occupied, safe\n\nt=13: y=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe\n\nt=14: y=4, freeway 4, not occupied, safe\n\nt=15: y=4, freeway 4, same, safe\n\nt=16: y=4, freeway 4, not occupied, as computed, safe\n\nt=17: y=5, freeway 5, not occupied at t=17, safe\n\nt=18: y=6, freeway 6, not occupied at t=18, safe\n\nt=19: y=7, freeway 7, not occupied at t=19, safe\n\nt=20: y=8, freeway 8, not occupied at t=20, safe\n\nThen at t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=20, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=19, y=7, then a19=U, to y=8 at t=20.\n\nBut I can go directly to y=9 if possible, but no.\n\nIs there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, after t=16, go up faster, but I can only do one per turn.\n\nAt t=18, I am at y=6, and I go to y=7 at t=19, but if I could be higher.\n\nBut from t=16 y=4 to t=18, two actions, max y18=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions starting from t=12.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions: a12=U, a13=U, a14=S, a15=S, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U\n\nAnd y reaches 9 at t=21.\n\nBut in the action list, for turn t=12 to t=20.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut at t=19, y=7, a19=U, to y=8 at t=20.\n\nThen a20=U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 9 actions, H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can have less S.\n\nFor example, at t=14, instead of S, I could do nothing, but same.\n\nOr, I could go to y=3 or something, but not better.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose I go down to y=1 at some point, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, I have two S, but I can have only one if I time differently.\n\nFor example, to be at y=4 at t=16, I can reach y=4 at t=14, then stay twice.\n\nI could reach later, but no.\n\nSuppose at t=12, I do S, y13=2\n\nThen a13=U, y14=3\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\na15=S, y16=4\n\nThen same as before, but I started with S, so later by one turn.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the sequence with U,U at start is better.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, at t=14 blocked, but in my sequence, I am not on y=8 at t=14, I am on y=4, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd at turn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=12 to t=20.\n\nIn the sequence, H=9.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with only one S.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=3 at t=16 or something.\n\nBut y=3 at t=16 is safe, but lower.\n\nThen to go to y=9 takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=16 y=3, then to y=9, need 6 U, so up to t=22 or something, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think 9 is minimal.\n\nThus the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 12 to turn 20.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n- At turns 12 to 15, the player moves to and stays at \\(y = 4\\) to avoid the collision on freeways 5, 6, and 7 at turn 16.\n- From turn 16 onwards, the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 21, avoiding all blocked times for the relevant freeways.\n\nThe actions and resulting positions are:\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) → position at turn 13: \\((0, 3)\\)\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) → position at turn 14: \\((0, 4)\\)\n- Turn 14: \\(S\\) → position at turn 15: \\((0, 4)\\)\n- Turn 15: \\(S\\) → position at turn 16: \\((0, 4)\\)\n- Turn 16: \\(U\\) → position at turn 17: \\((0, 5)\\)\n- Turn 17: \\(U\\) → position at turn 18: \\((0, 6)\\)\n- Turn 18: \\(U\\) → position at turn 19: \\((0, 7)\\)\n- Turn 19: \\(U\\) → position at turn 20: \\((0, 8)\\)\n- Turn 20: \\(U\\) → position at turn 21: \\((0, 9)\\)\n\nCollision checks:\n- Turn 12: On freeway 2 (y=2), not blocked (safe).\n- Turn 13: On freeway 3 (y=3), not blocked except at turns 18-19 (safe).\n- Turn 14: On freeway 4 (y=4), not blocked except at turns 18-19 (safe).\n- Turn 15: On freeway 4 (y=4), same as turn 14 (safe).\n- Turn 16: On freeway 4 (y=4), not blocked (car span [-23, -12], 0 not in; safe).\n- Turn 17: On freeway 5 (y=5), not blocked except at turn 16 (car span [1, 12] at Δt=5, 0 not in; safe).\n- Turn 18: On freeway 6 (y=6), not blocked except at turn 16 (car span [13, 24] at Δt=6, 0 not in; safe).\n- Turn 19: On freeway 7 (y=7), not blocked except at turn 16 (car span [25, 36] at Δt=7, 0 not in; safe).\n- Turn 20: On freeway 8 (y=8), not blocked except at turn 14 (car span [61, 72] at Δt=8, 0 not in; safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 14, and I have the car states for each freeway.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have head (h), tail (τ), direction (d), and speed (s). Direction is \"right\" for all cars here, meaning they're moving to the right. Since it's a freeway, and collision is based on whether 0 is in the car's span at a given turn.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T they are still on y_T, and only at turn T+1 are they on y_{T+1}. So for collision check, at turn T, we care about the freeway y_T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. So when the player is at y=9, no collision can happen.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn t_1=14, position y=4, to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=4 and need to get to y=9, that's 5 units up. Each U move increases y by 1, so in theory, 5 U moves in a row would get there in 5 turns. But I have to avoid the cars on the freeways during the path.\n\nThe freeways y=1 to y=8 have cars, so when I move through these y levels, I need to make sure that at each turn when I'm on a freeway y, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, their positions change over time, so I need to compute for each freeway and each turn, whether there's a car covering x=0.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=14, and for future turns T, the span changes based on the direction and speed.\n\nAll cars are moving right, so for a car with head h, tail τ, at turn T, since moving right, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] for T > t_1.\n\nLet me denote t_1 = 14 as the starting turn.\n\nFor a car moving right: at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-14), h + s*(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision if player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in the span for some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves at each turn, I need to simulate the position and check for each turn.\n\nAlso, the player can choose to stay or move down, but since we want to minimize turns, moving down might not be efficient unless necessary to avoid collision, but going to y=9 is up, so probably moving down is counterproductive, except maybe to wait.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so S or D might be used only if needed to avoid collision.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their spans over time.\n\nFreeway k=1: car (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=3)\n\nAt turn T, span = [49 + 3*(T-14), 60 + 3*(T-14)] = [49 + 3T - 42, 60 + 3T - 42] = [3T +7, 3T +18]\n\nSince 49 - 42 =7? 3*14=42, so 49 + 3(T-14) = 49 + 3T - 42 = 3T +7\n\nSimilarly, 60 + 3T -42 = 3T +18\n\nSo span: [3T +7, 3T +18]\n\nNow, 0 is in span if 3T+7 <= 0 <= 3T+18, but since T >=14, 3T+7 >= 3*14 +7=42+7=49>0, so 0 is always greater than the lower bound, but 3T+7 >0 for T>=14, and increasing, so 0 < 3T+7 <= upper, but since lower bound >0, 0 is never in [3T+7, 3T+18] for T>=14. So on freeway 1, no collision possible at any T>=14. Good, so y=1 is safe at all times.\n\nFreeway k=2: car (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nHead and tail: it says head h=-24, tail τ=-35? But direction right, and for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail? Let's see the span update.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere h=-24, τ=-35, s=6, t_1=14\n\nSo at T, span = [-35 + 6*(T-14), -24 + 6*(T-14)] = [-35 +6T -84, -24 +6T -84] = [6T -119, 6T -108]\n\n-35 -84 = -119, -24-84=-108, yes.\n\nNow, 0 in span if 6T -119 <= 0 <= 6T -108\n\nSince 6T -108 < 6T -119? No, -108 > -119, so 6T-119 <= 6T-108, so the interval is [6T-119, 6T-108]\n\n0 in this if lower <=0<= upper, so 6T-119 <=0 and 0 <= 6T-108\n\nWhich is 6T <=119 and 6T >=108, so T <= 119/6 = 19.833, so T<=19 since integer, and T >= 108/6=18\n\nSo for T=18,19\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=3: same as k=2? (-24,-35,right,6) identical, so same, collision at T=18,19\n\nFreeway k=4: also (-24,-35,right,6), same, collision at T=18,19\n\nNow freeway k=5: two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: [ -35 +12(T-14), -24 +12(T-14) ] = [ -35 +12T -168, -24 +12T -168 ] = [12T -203, 12T -192]\n\n0 in span if 12T -203 <=0 and 0<=12T-192, so 12T <=203, T<=203/12=16.916, so T<=16\n\nAnd 12T >=192, T>=192/12=16\n\nSo T=16\n\nSimilarly, second car on k=5: (48,37,right,12)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, moving right.\n\nSpan at T: [37 +12(T-14), 48 +12(T-14)] = [37 +12T -168, 48 +12T -168] = [12T -131, 12T -120]\n\n0 in span if 12T -131 <=0 <=12T-120\n\nSo 12T <=131, T<=131/12=10.916, T<=10\n\n12T >=120, T>=10\n\nT=10\n\nBut T=10 is before t_1=14? t_1=14, T>t_1 for future, but here T=10<14, so for T>=14, let's see.\n\nFor second car, span [12T -131, 12T -120]\n\nAt T=14, lower=12*14 -131=168-131=37, upper=168-120=48, so [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSince T>=14, 12T-131 >=12*14-131=168-131=37>0, so lower bound >0, so 0 never in span for T>=14. So only first car matters for k=5.\n\nFirst car collision at T=16.\n\nSimilarly for freeway k=6: same as k=5, two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nSame as above, first car causes collision at T=16, second car not for T>=14.\n\nFreeway k=7: identical to k=5 and k=6, same cars, so collision at T=16 for each.\n\nNow freeway k=8: two cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-11 +12(T-14), 0 +12(T-14)] = [-11 +12T -168, 12T -168] = [12T -179, 12T -168]\n\n0 in span if 12T -179 <=0 <=12T-168\n\nSo 12T <=179, T<=179/12=14.916, so T<=14\n\n12T >=168, T>=14\n\nT=14\n\nBut T=14 is the current turn, t_1=14.\n\nAt turn T=14, for freeway k=8, there is a car with span [12*14 -179, 12*14 -168] = [168-179, 168-168] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included? Since it's a closed span, I assume, so 0 is in [-11,0], so at T=14, on freeway 8, 0 is covered, so if player is on y=8 at turn T=14, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=4 at turn 14, so not on y=8, so no collision at T=14 for player.\n\nNow for T>14, 12T-179 and 12T-168, at T=15, lower=12*15-179=180-179=1, upper=180-168=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFor T>15, lower bound larger, so 0 never in span for T>14.\n\nSecond car on k=8: (48,37,right,12), same as before, span [12T-131,12T-120], for T>=14, min lower=37>0, so no issue.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only at T=14 there is a car covering 0, but since player not on y=8 at T=14, it's fine for future.\n\nNow summarize the dangerous freeways and turns:\n\n- Freeway 2,3,4: collision at T=18 and 19\n\n- Freeway 5,6,7: collision at T=16\n\n- Freeway 1: safe always\n\n- Freeway 8: only dangerous at T=14, but past, so safe for future.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=14 dangerous, but we are at T=14, y=4, not on it.\n\nFor future turns, freeway 8 is safe since no car covers 0 for T>14.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t=14, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On y=5,6,7: these are freeways 5,6,7 which have collision at T=16\n\n- y=2,3,4: freeways 2,3,4 have collision at T=18,19\n\ny=4 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1: freeway 1, y=2: freeway 2, ..., y=8: freeway 8.\n\nSo:\n\n- y=1: safe always\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=18,19\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=18,19\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=18,19 (since freeway 4)\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=16 (freeway 5)\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=16 (freeway 6)\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=16 (freeway 7)\n\n- y=8: safe for T>14, since only dangerous at T=14\n\ny=8 is safe for T>=15.\n\nNow, player starts at t=14, y=4.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to increase y from 4 to 9, so net +5 in y.\n\nEach U move +1, S or D no change or -1, so to minimize turns, we should use U as much as possible, but avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous T.\n\nDangerous times:\n\nFor y=5,6,7: only dangerous at T=16\n\nFor y=2,3,4: dangerous at T=18 and 19\n\ny=1 and y=8 safe always except y=8 at T=14 which is past.\n\nNow, since we start at t=14, y=4.\n\nWe need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, if we go directly up: at t=14, y=4\n\nAction: U, then t=15, y=5\n\nBut at t=15, y=5, which is freeway 5, and T=15, is it dangerous? Freeway 5 dangerous only at T=16, not at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U again at t=15, to y=6 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=6, which is freeway 6, and T=16 is dangerous for y=6, so collision!\n\nBecause at T=16, on freeway 6, 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on y=5 at T=16, also collision.\n\nBut at T=15, y=5, T=15 not dangerous, only T=16.\n\nSo if we go:\n\nt=14: at y=4, action? If we do S or something.\n\nLet's list turns starting from t=14.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then position at t+1 is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy\n\nIn the update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action at turn t, position changes to new y at turn t+1.\n\nLet me define:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn t based on y_t and the car spans at turn t.\n\nIn the problem:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at position y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, we check if for freeway k=y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nIf so, collision.\n\nNow, at turn T, after action or before? The position y_T is at turn T, before action I think.\n\nThe sequence: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), then we choose action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}, but for collision, at turn T, it's based on y_T.\n\nIn the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", so y_t is position at turn t.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway and 0 covered.\n\nThen after that, we take action.\n\nBut for the starting point, at turn t_1=14, we are at (0,4), and we need to choose actions from t=14 onwards.\n\nAt turn t=14, position is y=4, so we check collision at t=14 for y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, and at t=14, is there a car covering 0?\n\nFor freeway 4, car (-24,-35,right,6), at T=14, span [6*14 -119, 6*14 -108] = [84-119, 84-108] = [-35, -24], which is [-35,-24], 0 not in this, since negative and 0>-24? -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not in, so safe at t=14.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, at t=14, let's verify:\n\ny=4: freeway 4, span [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, cars: first (-24,-35,right,12) at T=14: [12*14 -203, 12*14 -192] = [168-203,168-192]=[-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [12*14 -131, 12*14 -120]=[168-131,168-120]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly y=6 same.\n\ny=7 same.\n\ny=8: at T=14, car (0,-11,right,12), span [12*14 -179, 12*14 -168] = [168-179,168-168]=[-11,0], so 0 is in, so if on y=8 at t=14, collision, but player at y=4, not on it.\n\nSo at t=14, player safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=4 to y=9, need +5, so at least 5 turns if all U.\n\nBut we might need to pause or detour to avoid dangerous times.\n\nDangerous turns:\n\nFor y=5,6,7: dangerous only at T=16\n\nFor y=2,3,4: dangerous at T=18 and T=19\n\ny=1 and y=8 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's consider going up directly.\n\nOption 1: all U, 5 steps.\n\nt=14: start y=4, action U, then y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: position y=5, action U, then y=6 at t=16\n\nAt t=16: position y=6, and T=16, freeway 6, which is dangerous at T=16, collision! Not good.\n\nIf at t=15, we do S instead of U.\n\nt=14: action U, to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: at y=5, if we do S, then y=5 at t=16? No.\n\nAt turn t=15, position y=5, choose action a_15.\n\nIf a_15 = S, then y_{16} = y_15 + 0 = 5, so at t=16, position y=5.\n\nBut y=5 at t=16 is dangerous, since freeway 5 collision at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, if we do D, y=4 at t=16, but y=4 at t=16, T=16, freeway 4 not dangerous at T=16, only at 18,19.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nTo avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=16.\n\nSince only t=16 is dangerous for those.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2,3,4, dangerous at t=18,19.\n\nNow, t=16 is critical for mid-levels.\n\nWe can be on y=5,6,7 at other times, just not at t=16.\n\nSimilarly for lower levels.\n\nNow, we start at t=14, y=4.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay at y=4, but we need to go up.\n\nOption: at t=14, do S, stay at y=4 for t=15.\n\nBut y=4 at t=15: is it dangerous? Freeway 4 dangerous only at t=18,19, so at t=15, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, we can go up.\n\nBut let's think about timing.\n\nWe need to be not on y=5,6,7 at turn t=16.\n\nTurn t=16 position should not be 5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, for t=18 and 19, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nBut since we are going up, we might not be on low levels later.\n\nFirst, let's list the turns: t=14,15,16,17,18,19,...\n\nAt t=14: y=4, safe as above.\n\nWe take action a_14.\n\nIf a_14 = U, then at t=15, y=5.\n\nIf a_14 = S, then at t=15, y=4.\n\nIf a_14 = D, then at t=15, y=3, but that might not help.\n\nNow, at t=15: position y_t.\n\nIf y_15=5, then we can choose action.\n\nBut if at t=15 we are at y=5, and we do U, then at t=16, y=6, which is bad.\n\nIf at t=15 y=5, and we do S, then at t=16 y=5, bad.\n\nIf we do D, then at t=16 y=4, which is safe at t=16.\n\nBut y=4 at t=16 is safe, but we are lower.\n\nThen from there we need to go up.\n\nBut we lost progress.\n\nTo avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=16, we can be below or above at t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=16, if we are at y=4 or below, or y=8 or 9.\n\ny=8 is safe since freeway 8 only dangerous at t=14.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=16, we need to have moved up quickly.\n\nStart at t=14 y=4.\n\nIf we go up fast: t=14: U, to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: U, to y=6 at t=16 → but t=16 y=6 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=14: U to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: D? to y=4 at t=16\n\nThen at t=16 y=4, safe.\n\nBut now at y=4, same as start almost.\n\nThen we need to go up from here.\n\nBut at t=16, we are at y=4.\n\nNow t=16, position y=4, safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we have the low-level danger at t=18,19.\n\nFirst, let's get past the t=16 danger.\n\nFrom t=16 y=4, we can go up.\n\nBut y=4 at t=16 is safe, but if we stay, it might be dangerous later.\n\nWe can go up directly from here.\n\nt=16: at y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: at y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=18\n\nBut at t=18, y=6, and t=18, is y=6 dangerous? Freeway 6 dangerous only at t=16, not at t=18. For y=6, dangerous only at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 only t=16, y=7 only t=16.\n\nFor y=2,3,4 dangerous at t=18 and 19.\n\nSo at t=18, if on y=6, it's safe, since not dangerous time.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=17 safe.\n\nIn this case: from t=16 y=4\n\nt=16: U, to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: at y=5, U to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: at y=6, U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: at y=7, U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: at y=8, U to y=9 at t=21\n\nBut at t=18, y=6 is safe, t=19 y=7 is safe.\n\nBut we are on y=4 at t=16, which is freeway 4, and t=16 is not dangerous for y=4, only t=18,19.\n\nIn this path, at t=18, we are at y=6, not on y=4.\n\nSimilarly at t=19, y=7, not low.\n\nSo no problem with low levels.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nStart: t=14: we need to get to t=16 at y=4.\n\nFrom t=14 y=4.\n\nIf we do S at t=14, then at t=15 y=4 (since S, no change)\n\nThen at t=15 y=4, we can do S again or U.\n\nIf at t=15 we do U, to y=5 at t=16? No.\n\nAt t=15 position y=4, action U, then y_{16} = y_15 +1 =5, so at t=16 y=5, which is dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=15 y=4, we do S, then y=4 at t=16, safe.\n\nThen as above.\n\nBut we need to specify actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=14: action? We want to be at y=4 at t=16.\n\nAt t=14, position y=4.\n\nIf we do S at t=14, then y_{15} = y_14 + 0 =4, so at t=15, y=4.\n\nThen at t=15, position y=4, if we do S, then y_{16} =4, so at t=16, y=4.\n\nThen from there, we can go up as above.\n\nBut we used two turns to stay at y=4, which is inefficient.\n\nAt t=14, we could do D to go down, but that seems worse.\n\nTo be above at t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=16, be at y=8 or 9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=14 to y=8 at t=16: need +4 in two turns, so two U moves.\n\nt=14: U, to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: U, to y=6 at t=16 → but y=6 at t=16 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=14: U to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: U to y=6 at t=16 → collision.\n\nCannot reach y=8 in two moves from here.\n\ny=4 to y=8 is +4, min 4 moves, but from t=14 to t=16 is only two moves, so position at t=16 can be at most y=6 if all U, but y=6 at t=16 bad.\n\ny=7 at t=16 also bad.\n\ny=5 at t=16 bad.\n\ny=4 at t=16 safe, or y=3,2,1,0 or y=8,9.\n\nBut y=8 or 9 not reachable in two moves from y=4.\n\ny=4 to y=8: need 4 U, so at least 4 turns.\n\nAt t=14, if U, t=15 y=5\n\nU, t=16 y=6 bad\n\nOr with S or D.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=16, impossible since t=16 - t=14 = 2 turns, delta y max +2, to y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 not possible.\n\nSo at t=16, we can only be from y=2 to y=6, since y=1 to y=5 possible if down, but we start y=4.\n\nPossible positions at t=16: from actions.\n\nAt t=14, y=4, action a14, to y15.\n\nThen at t=15, action a15, to y16.\n\ny15: if a14=U, y15=5; a14=S, y15=4; a14=D, y15=3\n\nThen for each, a15: if y15=5, a15=U to y16=6; a15=S to y16=5; a15=D to y16=4\n\nIf y15=4, a15=U to y16=5; a15=S to y16=4; a15=D to y16=3\n\nIf y15=3, a15=U to y16=4; a15=S to y16=3; a15=D to y16=2\n\nNow, y=16 position should not be 5,6,7 to avoid collision.\n\nSo possible safe y16: 1,2,3,4,8,9 but 8 and 9 impossible, so y16=1,2,3,4\n\nNow, from above, if we go down, we can have y16=4,3,2\n\nFor example:\n\n- If we stay: a14=S, then y15=4; then a15=S, y16=4\n\n- Or a14=S, y15=4; a15=D, y16=3\n\n- a14=D, y15=3; a15=S, y16=3\n\n- a14=D, y15=3; a15=U, y16=4\n\n- a14=D, y15=3; a15=D, y16=2\n\n- Etc.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nThe simplest is to stay at y=4 for two turns.\n\nThen from t=16 at y=4, we can go up.\n\nNow, from y=4 to y=9, need 5 U moves, but we have to consider the low-level danger at t=18,19.\n\nAt t=16: y=4\n\nt=16: action U, to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: action U, to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: action U, to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: action U, to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: action U, to y=9 at t=21\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=17: y=5, freeway 5, T=17. Freeway 5 dangerous only at T=16, not 17, so safe.\n\nAt t=18: y=6, freeway 6, T=18. Dangerous only at T=16, not 18, safe.\n\nAt t=19: y=7, freeway 7, T=19. Dangerous only at T=16, not 19, safe.\n\nAt t=20: y=8, freeway 8, T=20. But freeway 8 only dangerous at T=14, so safe.\n\nt=21: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=18 and t=19, we are at y=6 and y=7, which are safe, but we also have the low levels dangerous at t=18,19, but we are not on them.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=5 at t=17, y=6 at t=18, y=7 at t=19, all safe for those times.\n\nNow, back to the beginning: to reach t=16 at y=4, we used two turns: t=14 and t=15 with S or something.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nt=14: at y=4, action S, then y=4 at t=15\n\nt=15: at y=4, action S, then y=4 at t=16\n\nThen from t=16: U to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: U to y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: U to y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: U to y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: U to y=9 at t=21\n\nAt t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nTotal turns from start: actions at t=14 to t=20, 7 actions, H=7 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=14 to t=20, that's 7 actions: t=14,15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nAfter action at t=20, y=9 at t=21.\n\nThe number of turns H: we start at turn t_1=14, and we reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe position after H actions: we start at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn T+k.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nDefine: at turn t_1, we are at position.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, we move to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1+1}, to y_{t_1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, and we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after that, position at t_1 + H is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen position after last action is at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, we want min H.\n\nIn my earlier path, with actions:\n\nAt t=14: S (action 1)\n\nThen y=4 at t=15\n\nAt t=15: S (action 2)\n\ny=4 at t=16\n\nAt t=16: U (action 3)\n\ny=5 at t=17\n\nAt t=17: U (action 4)\n\ny=6 at t=18\n\nAt t=18: U (action 5)\n\ny=7 at t=19\n\nAt t=19: U (action 6)\n\ny=8 at t=20\n\nAt t=20: U (action 7)\n\ny=9 at t=21\n\nSo after 7 actions, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nt_1=14, so t_1 + H =21, so H=7.\n\nBut we can do better? For example, avoid the two S actions.\n\nSince y=1 and y=8 are safe, we could go to y=1 or something, but that seems down.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 quickly after t=16.\n\nBut t=16 is the critical point.\n\nPerhaps at t=14, we go up, but then at t=15, instead of staying, we go down or something.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=14: U to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: D to y=4 at t=16  // instead of S, we do D, but same y=4 at t=16.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we used U and D, net zero, same as two S.\n\nBut in terms of actions, it's similar.\n\nThen from t=16 y=4, go up.\n\nBut now we have the issue of t=18,19 for low levels, but in this path we leave y=4 at t=16, so at t=18 we are at y=6, not low.\n\nBut H is still 7.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nSuppose we can be at y=8 at t=17 or something.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=14.\n\nt=14: U to y=5 at t=15\n\nNow at t=15, y=5, we need to not be on dangerous y at t=16.\n\nSo if at t=15, we do D, to y=4 at t=16, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, y=4, we can go up.\n\nBut to go up faster, at t=16, U to y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: U to y=6 at t=18\n\nBut at t=17, y=5, safe, t=18 y=6 safe.\n\nBut same as before, we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=18, U to y=7 at t=19, U to y=8 at t=20, U to y=9 at t=21, same H=7.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=16, we can go U multiple times.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 is 5 moves, from t=16 to t=21, 5 turns after t=16.\n\nt=16 to t=17 is one action, etc.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, we could go down to y=1 at some point, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, to avoid the low-level danger, but since we are going up, we might not be affected.\n\nAnother point: at t=18 and t=19, if we are on y=2,3,4, collision possible.\n\nBut in the above path, at t=18, we are at y=6, not low, so fine.\n\nBut can we get to y=9 faster than t=21?\n\nFor example, if we start going up immediately but skip t=16 on dangerous y.\n\nSuppose at t=14: U to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: since at y=5, if we do U, to y=6 at t=16 collision.\n\nIf we do S, to y=5 at t=16 collision.\n\nIf we do D, to y=4 at t=16 safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 t=16.\n\nNow, from here, instead of going step by step, we can go directly, but no, we have to move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y earlier.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that y=8 is safe and go there quickly after t=16.\n\nBut from y=4, it takes min 4 turns to y=8.\n\nt=16 y=4, t=17 y=5, t=18 y=6, t=19 y=7, t=20 y=8, then t=21 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=19, y=7, is it safe? Freeway 7 dangerous only at t=16, so yes.\n\nBut we have t=18 and t=19 dangerous for y=2,3,4, but we are not there.\n\nNow, to save one turn, we need to reach y=9 at t=20 or earlier.\n\nt=20 y=9.\n\nFrom start, t=14 y=4 to t=20 y=9, that's 6 turns: actions at t=14,15,16,17,18,19 to reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nMin moves: 5 U, but we might need to avoid.\n\nFor example, if we go all U from t=14:\n\nt=14: U to y=5 t=15\n\nt=15: U to y=6 t=16 → collision at t=16.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=14: U to y=5 t=15\n\nt=15: D to y=4 t=16  // safe at t=16\n\nThen from t=16 y=4, we need to reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nThat's 4 turns: from y=4 to y=9, need 5 steps, but only 4 actions? Actions from t=16 to t=19.\n\nt=16: action, to y at t=17\n\nt=17: action, to y t=18\n\nt=18: action, to y t=19\n\nt=19: action, to y t=20\n\nWe want y t=20 =9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=16, after 4 actions, to y at t=20.\n\nMax we can go is to y=8 if all U: t=16 U to y=5 t=17, U to y=6 t=18, U to y=7 t=19, U to y=8 t=20.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y=9 at t=21.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=20 from y=4 at t=16 in 4 actions; min 5 actions needed for +5.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, delta y=+5, each U +1, so min 5 U moves, so at least 5 turns after the start position.\n\nAt t=14, position y=4.\n\nAfter first action (t=14), to y at t=15.\n\nAfter k actions, to y at t=14 + k.\n\nWe want y at t=14 + H =9, so after H actions.\n\nFor y to increase by 5, H must be at least 5.\n\nBut with obstacles, H might be more.\n\nIn the all U case, H=5, but collision at t=16.\n\nSo H>5.\n\nIn my earlier plan, H=7.\n\nBut perhaps H=6 possible.\n\nFor example, with H=6, we reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nActions at t=14 to t=19.\n\ny at t=20=9.\n\nNow, positions: at t=14 y=4\n\nAfter a14, y15\n\na15, y16\n\na16, y17\n\na17, y18\n\na18, y19\n\na19, y20=9\n\nNow, y20=9, so the last action a19 must be U, and y19=8.\n\nSimilarly, y20=9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collision at each turn when on freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at t=16, y16 must not be 5,6,7.\n\nAt t=18, y18 must not be 2,3,4? Freeways 2,3,4 dangerous at t=18,19.\n\nBut y18 is position at turn 18, if on y=2,3,4, then collision if dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for t=19.\n\nNow, since we are going up, y will be increasing, so at t=18 and t=19, we might be at higher y.\n\nNow, to reach y19=8 and y20=9.\n\ny19=8, which is freeway 8, but safe for t>14, so at t=19, y=8 safe.\n\ny20=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to get to y19=8 from start.\n\ny at t=14 is 4.\n\nIn 5 actions (t=14 to t=18) to reach y19=8? Actions affect next position.\n\nAfter 5 actions: from t=14 to t=18 actions, position at t=19.\n\nWe want y19=8.\n\nSimilarly, after 4 actions, position at t=18.\n\nNow, from y14=4 to y19=8, delta y=+4, so possible in 4 or 5 actions with some S or D, but to minimize H, we want all U if possible.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\ny19=8, so we need net +4 from t=14 to t=19.\n\nt=14 to t=19 is 5 turns later, but positions from t=15 to t=19 affected by actions.\n\ny_t for t=15 to 19.\n\ny15 = y14 + Δy14\n\ny16 = y15 + Δy15\n\n...\n\ny19 = y18 + Δy18\n\nWe want y19=8.\n\ny14=4.\n\nSo y19 = y14 + sum_{t=14 to 18} Δy_t\n\nSince y19 = y18 + Δy18, and y18 = y17 + Δy17, ..., down to y14.\n\ny19 = y14 + Δy14 + Δy15 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nWe need y19=8, y14=4, so sum_{t=14 to 18} Δy_t = 4\n\nSince 8 - 4 =4.\n\nSimilarly, for y20=9, but we don't care directly.\n\nNow, the sum of 5 deltas must be +4, so mostly U, with one S or D, or all U except one less.\n\nBut since +4 in 5 steps, possible with four U and one S, or three U and one D and something, but net +4.\n\nEasier to think actions.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that at t=16, y16 not 5,6,7.\n\nAnd at t=18, y18 not 2,3,4? But since we are going up, y18 might be high.\n\nSimilarly t=19.\n\nNow, suppose we go up with one pause.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=14: U to y=5 at t=15\n\nt=15: D to y=4 at t=16  // to avoid t=16 on mid\n\nBut y=4 at t=16 safe.\n\nNow, from t=16 y=4, we need to reach y19=8.\n\nThat is, from t=16 to t=19, positions.\n\ny16=4\n\ny17 = y16 + Δy16\n\ny18 = y17 + Δy17\n\ny19 = y18 + Δy18\n\nWe want y19=8.\n\nSo sum Δy16 to Δy18 = +4\n\nBut only three actions: t=16,17,18.\n\nThree actions, max +3, to y=7 at t=19, but we need y19=8, impossible with three actions from y=4.\n\ny16=4, after three actions, to y at t=19.\n\ny19 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y19=4+3=7, cannot reach 8.\n\nThus, from y=4 at t=16, we can reach at most y=7 at t=19, but we need y=8 at t=19 for y20=9? No.\n\nIn the H=6 case, we reach y20=9 at t=20.\n\ny20 = y19 + Δy19\n\nWe want y20=9, so if y19=8, then Δy19=U.\n\ny19=8.\n\nNow, y19 depends on previous.\n\ny14=4\n\ny19 = y14 + Δy14 + Δy15 + Δy16 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\nSet of five Δy from t=14 to t=18.\n\nWe need y19=8, so sum of five Δy = 4.\n\nSince y19 - y14 = 4.\n\nNow, each Δy in {-1,0,1}, so to sum to 4, possibilities: four +1 and one 0, or three +1 and two +1 with one -1 but net +4, etc.\n\nMin number of +1 is four, with one 0, or five +1 with one -1 but sum=3, not 4.\n\nIf all five +1, sum=5, y19=9.\n\nBut we need y19=8, so sum=4.\n\nSo must have exactly four +1 and one 0, or three +1 and one +1 with adjustments, but only possibilities: four U and one S, or three U, one D, and two S or something, but net +4.\n\nFor example: four U and one S, or three U and one D and two U? Actions: five actions, each contributes Δy.\n\nSum Δy = number of U minus number of D, since S=0.\n\nLet U be number of U actions, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S = 5.\n\nThen net Δy = U - D.\n\nSet to 4.\n\nAlso, U - D =4, and U + D + S =5.\n\nThen from U - D =4, U + D + S=5, add: 2U + S =9, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSince S >=0, 2U + S=9, U <=5, so possible U=4, S=1, D=0 or U=5, S=0, but U=5, D=0, S=0, net Δy=5, y19=9.\n\nBut we need y19=8, so net Δy=4, so U - D =4, with U + D + S=5.\n\nIf D=0, U=4, S=1.\n\nIf D=1, U=5, but U=5, D=1, S=0? U + D + S=6>5, no.\n\nU + D + S=5.\n\nU - D =4.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =9\n\nSubtract: 2D + S =1\n\nNow, S >=0 integer.\n\n2U + S =9, U integer <=5.\n\nIf U=4, S=1, then 2D + S=1, so 2D +1=1, D=0.\n\nIf U=5, S= -1? Impossible.\n\nU=4, S=1, D=0.\n\nOr U=3, S=3, then 2*3 + S=6+S=9, S=3, then 2D + S=1, 2D+3=1, D=-1 impossible.\n\nU=4, S=1, D=0 is the only possibility.\n\nSo to have y19=8, we must have exactly four U and one S in the actions from t=14 to t=18.\n\nNow, back to collision avoidance.\n\nWe need to choose when to have the S action.\n\nAlso, avoid y=5,6,7 at t=16.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=14: y=4\n\nAfter a14, y15\n\na15, y16\n\na16, y17\n\na17, y18\n\na18, y19=8\n\nWe need y19=8.\n\nSince one S and four U, y19=4 +4 -0 +0? Net +4 from actions.\n\nNow, y16 must not be 5,6,7.\n\nAlso, at other times, but mainly t=16 critical.\n\nNow, let's see possible sequences.\n\nSuppose we do S at t=14.\n\nThen a14=S, Δy=0, y15=4\n\nThen we need four U in t=15 to t=18.\n\na15: if U, y16=5\n\nBut y16=5, which is dangerous at t=16 if it were, but t=16 position y16, if y16=5, and t=16, collision since freeway 5 dangerous at t=16.\n\ny16=5 at t=16 bad.\n\nIf a15=S, but we need to use U later.\n\na14=S, y15=4\n\na15: if U, y16=5 collision\n\nIf a15=S, y16=4, then we need four U from t=16 to t=18, but only three actions t=16,17,18, can get to y19=4+3=7 max, but we need y19=8, impossible.\n\ny16=4 after a15=S.\n\nThen actions t=16,17,18: three actions, to y19.\n\nMax y19=4 +3=7 if all U.\n\nBut we need y19=8, so cannot.\n\nThus, if we do S at t=14, we cannot reach y19=8 because we lose a move.\n\nS at other times.\n\nSuppose we do S at t=15.\n\na14: must be U or D or S, but to go up, likely U.\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\nThen a15: if S, Δy=0, y16=5\n\nBut y16=5 at t=16 collision.\n\nIf a15=U, y16=6 collision.\n\nIf a15=D, y16=4\n\nThen y16=4\n\nNow, from here, we need y19=8.\n\ny16=4, actions t=16,17,18 to y19.\n\nThree actions, max y19=7, cannot reach 8.\n\nSame issue.\n\na14=D, but that goes down, worse.\n\na14=D, y15=3\n\nThen need to go up.\n\nBut y15=3\n\nThen a15: if U, y16=4\n\nThen y16=4\n\nThen same, cannot reach y19=8 from y16=4 in three moves.\n\nIf a15=D, y16=2, even lower.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nThus, it is impossible to reach y19=8 from y14=4 with only five actions including one S, because after the S, we have fewer effective moves to go up.\n\nWith five actions, we can reach y19=9 with all U, but we need to avoid collision at t=16.\n\nWith all U:\n\nt=14: U, y15=5\n\nt=15: U, y16=6 collision at t=16.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we do D at some point, but net would be less.\n\nFor example, a14=U, y15=5\n\na15=D, y16=4\n\nThen y16=4\n\nThen a16=U, y17=5\n\na17=U, y18=6\n\na18=U, y19=7\n\nThen y19=7, not 8.\n\nThen to reach y20=9, we need a19=U, to y20=8? y20 = y19 + Δy19 =7 +1=8 if U, then y20=8, not 9.\n\ny19=7, a19=U, y20=8.\n\nThen need another action to y21=9.\n\nBut for H=6, we want to reach at t=20.\n\ny20=8, not 9.\n\nIf we go faster earlier.\n\nBut from above, it seems impossible to reach y=9 at t=20 with H=6 actions.\n\nSince min to go from y=4 to y=9 is 5 U, but with collision, we need at least one extra turn to avoid.\n\nIn the first plan, with two S at start, we have H=7.\n\nBut we can have H=6 if we reach at t=20.\n\ny20=9.\n\nThen y20 = y19 + Δy19\n\nSet y20=9, so if y19=8, then Δy19=U.\n\nOr y19=9, Δy19=S or D, but then not moving, but we want to reach, so y19=8, a19=U.\n\nNow, y19=8.\n\ny19 = y14 + sum_{t=14 to 18} Δy_t = 4 + net Δy\n\nSet to 8, so net Δy from t=14 to 18 must be +4.\n\nWith five actions, as before, only possible with four U and one S.\n\nBut as above, we cannot achieve y19=8 without being at y=5 or 6 at t=16 or cannot reach 8.\n\nSpecifically, the only way to have net +4 in five steps is four U and one S.\n\nSuppose the S is at t=18.\n\nThen a14 to a17 must be U, but a14 U to y15=5\n\na15 U to y16=6 collision.\n\nIf S at t=17.\n\na14 U to y15=5\n\na15 ? If U, y16=6 bad; if D, y16=4; if S, y16=5 bad.\n\nSo must a15=D, y16=4\n\nThen a16: U to y17=5\n\na17: S, Δy=0, y18=5\n\na18: U to y19=6? y19 = y18 + Δy18 =5 +1=6 if U, but we need y19=8, not 6.\n\ny19=6, not 8.\n\nIf a17=U, y18=6\n\na18=U, y19=7, still not 8.\n\nCannot.\n\nS at t=16.\n\na14 U to y15=5\n\na15: must not go to y16=5 or 6, so a15=D, to y16=4\n\nThen a16=S, y17=4\n\na17=U, y18=5\n\na18=U, y19=6, not 8.\n\na17=U, y18=5; a18=U, y19=6.\n\nStill low.\n\na16=U, y17=5; a17=U, y18=6; a18=U, y19=7.\n\nNot 8.\n\nAlways y19 <=7 from this point.\n\nIf we start with S at t=14, a14=S, y15=4\n\nThen a15=U, y16=5 collision if at t=16.\n\ny16=5 at t=16 bad.\n\na15=D, y16=3\n\nThen a16=U, y17=4; a17=U, y18=5; a18=U, y19=6.\n\nNot 8.\n\nOther combinations seem not to work.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=20 with H=6 actions.\n\nThus minimal H is 7, with the first plan.\n\nBut in the first plan, we have two S at beginning, but we can have one S and one D or something, but net same.\n\nBut H=7.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=1 which is always safe, but going down takes extra turns.\n\nFor example, t=14: D to y=3 at t=15\n\nBut y=3 at t=15, then we need to go up, but more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo probably H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm with the low-level danger.\n\nIn the path: t=14: S, y=4 at t=15\n\nt=15: S, y=4 at t=16\n\nt=16: U, y=5 at t=17\n\nt=17: U, y=6 at t=18\n\nt=18: U, y=7 at t=19\n\nt=19: U, y=8 at t=20\n\nt=20: U, y=9 at t=21\n\nNow, check each turn for collision:\n\nt=14: y=4, freeway 4, at t=14, span as before, not covering 0, safe.\n\nt=15: y=4, freeway 4, T=15, not dangerous time (only 18,19), safe.\n\nt=16: y=4, freeway 4, T=16, not 18 or 19, safe.\n\nt=17: y=5, freeway 5, T=17, not dangerous (only T=16), safe.\n\nt=18: y=6, freeway 6, T=18, not T=16, safe.\n\nt=19: y=7, freeway 7, T=19, not T=16, safe.\n\nt=20: y=8, freeway 8, T=20, safe as only dangerous at T=14.\n\nt=21: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd we reach at t=21.\n\nActions: at t=14: S, t=15: S, t=16: U, t=17: U, t=18: U, t=19: U, t=20: U\n\nBut at t=19: U, to y=8 at t=20, then t=20: U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions from t=14 to t=20 for H=7.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=14, H=7, so actions at t=14 to t=20.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions: t=14: S, t=15: S, t=16: U, t=17: U, t=18: U, t=19: U, t=20: U\n\nAfter t=20 action, y=9 at t=21.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it nicer, we could have the S not at beginning, but it doesn't save turns.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe, we can go directly to y=8 after the danger.\n\nBut t=16 danger, so from t=16 onwards.\n\nBut at t=16 we are at y=4, as before.\n\nPerhaps at t=15, we can be at y=4 or something.\n\nBut I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 8, at t=14, there was a car, but for future, safe.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5,6,7, only dangerous at t=16, which we avoided.\n\nSimilarly for low levels, we are not on them at t=18,19.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nSo for t=14 to t=20.\n\nBut t_1=14.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5,6,7 have two cars each, but I think I covered, only the first one is dangerous at t=16.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at turn \\(t = 16\\) (when these freeways are dangerous) and not on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turns \\(t = 18\\) and \\(t = 19\\) (when these freeways are dangerous). Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is always safe, and freeway \\(y = 8\\) is safe for \\(t > 14\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Safe at all turns, as the car span \\([3t + 7, 3t + 18]\\) does not contain 0 for \\(t \\geq 14\\).\n- **Freeways 2, 3, 4 (y=2,3,4)**: Dangerous at \\(t = 18\\) and \\(t = 19\\) due to car spans covering 0. The player avoids these freeways at these times by being at higher y-levels.\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7 (y=5,6,7)**: Dangerous at \\(t = 16\\) due to car spans covering 0. The player avoids these freeways at \\(t = 16\\) by being at \\(y = 4\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Safe for \\(t > 14\\), as the car span only covers 0 at \\(t = 14\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence starts at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) and consists of 7 actions:\n- At turn 14, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 15, avoiding any move that could lead to a dangerous position at \\(t = 16\\).\n- At turn 15, stay (S) again to remain at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 16, ensuring safety at \\(t = 16\\) (not on y=5,6,7).\n- From turn 16 to turn 20, move up (U) repeatedly to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 21, staying clear of low freeways during dangerous turns.\n\nThe actions are:\n- Turn 14: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\) for \\(t = 15\\))\n- Turn 15: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\) for \\(t = 16\\))\n- Turn 16: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) for \\(t = 17\\))\n- Turn 17: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) for \\(t = 18\\))\n- Turn 18: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) for \\(t = 19\\))\n- Turn 19: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) for \\(t = 20\\))\n- Turn 20: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) for \\(t = 21\\))\n\n### Verification of Path:\n- **Turn 14 (\\(t = 14\\), \\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4, car span \\([-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span; safe.\n- **Turn 15 (\\(t = 15\\), \\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4, car span \\([-29, -18]\\) (computed from update), 0 not in span; safe.\n- **Turn 16 (\\(t = 16\\), \\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4, car span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span; safe (not dangerous time).\n- **Turn 17 (\\(t = 17\\), \\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5, car spans \\([-11, 0]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in either; safe (not \\(t = 16\\)).\n- **Turn 18 (\\(t = 18\\), \\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6, car spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\), 0 not in span; safe (not \\(t = 16\\)).\n- **Turn 19 (\\(t = 19\\), \\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7, car spans \\([13, 24]\\) and \\([61, 72]\\), 0 not in span; safe (not \\(t = 16\\)).\n- **Turn 20 (\\(t = 20\\), \\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8, car spans \\([25, 36]\\) and \\([73, 84]\\), 0 not in span; safe.\n- **Turn 21 (\\(t = 21\\), \\(y = 9\\))**: No freeway; safe and goal reached.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 7\\)) by strategically waiting at \\(y = 4\\) during turns 14 and 15 to avoid the critical turn 16 on mid-freeways, then proceeding directly upward.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 15.\n\nThe player moves up (U), down (D), or stays (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways. Each car has a head and tail position, direction, and speed. At any turn T, for a car on freeway i, if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the car's span at that turn, there's a collision.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So, when you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are on y_T during turn T, and only check for cars on y_T at that turn. After moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars there.\n\nFrom the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", meaning at turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nSo, during turn T, position is y_T, and you check cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, the car states at turn t_1=15:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3). Since direction is right, head is at h, tail at τ. For right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nLet's clarify the car update.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h], at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be the front, so if direction right, head is larger, tail smaller? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). So h = -48, τ = -59. Since direction right, and h = -48 > τ = -59? -48 is greater than -59, yes, so head at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from -59 to -48, length 11, moving right at speed 3.\n\nAt turn T, position: [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] = [-59 + 3(T-15), -48 + 3(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-18, -29, right, 6) so [ -29 + 6(T-15), -18 + 6(T-15) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-18, -29, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12). (60,49)? h=60, τ=49, so head 60, tail 49, but 60>49, moving right, so [49 +12(T-15), 60+12(T-15)] for first car? No.\n\nFirst car: h=-12, τ=-23, so since right, head at -12, tail at -23, so span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 +12(T-15), -12 +12(T-15)]\n\nSecond car: h=60, τ=49, direction right, so head 60, tail 49, so [49 +12(T-15), 60 +12(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same as 5, two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\n(12,1,right,12): h=12, τ=1, so [1 +12(T-15), 12+12(T-15)]\n\nAnd (60,49,right,12) as above.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at turn 15.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, minimum turns to go from y=4 to y=9 is 5 turns if we go up each time.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on the freeways when we are on them.\n\nAlso, we can stay or go down, but since we need to go up, probably best to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, meaning the car covers position x=0 at that time.\n\nBecause collision if player is on that freeway and 0 in span.\n\nSo for each freeway i, and for each turn T, we need to know if there is a car on i with 0 ∈ span at T.\n\nThen, when player is at y_T at turn T, if for freeway y_T, there is such a car, collision.\n\ny_T is the row the player is on during turn T.\n\nNow, player position: at turn t, y_t.\n\nStart at t=15, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nFor turn T, we care about cars on freeway y_T.\n\nNow, since we need to minimize turns, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait or detour if there's a car blocking.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway, at which turns 0 is occupied.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 15, so for turn T, relative to start.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, right, h=-48, τ=-59, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT ]\n\n0 ∈ this interval if -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT\n\nSo -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 => 3ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so ΔT ≤ 19 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT => 48 ≤ 3ΔT => ΔT ≥ 16\n\nSo ΔT from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nΔT = T - 15, so for T=15+16=31 to T=15+19=34? ΔT min 16, max 19.\n\nT = 15 + ΔT, so T from 15+16=31 to 15+19=34.\n\nΔT=16: -59 + 3*16 = -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included since ≤ and ≥, so yes.\n\nΔT=17: -59+51= -8, -48+51=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=18: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=19: -59+57= -2, -48+57=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=20: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 ≤1 false, since 0 not >=1, so not in.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=15: -59+45= -14, -48+45= -3, [ -14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 occupied at T=31,32,33,34.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSpan: [ -29 + 6ΔT, -18 + 6ΔT ]\n\n0 ∈ this if -29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -18 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 29 => ΔT ≤ 29/6 ≈4.833, so ΔT ≤4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18 +6ΔT => 18 ≤ 6ΔT => ΔT ≥ 3\n\nSo ΔT=3,4\n\nΔT=3: -29+18= -11, -18+18=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=4: -29+24= -5, -18+24=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: -29+12= -17, -18+12= -6, [ -17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔT=5: -29+30=1, -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 2, occupied at T=15+3=18 and T=15+4=19\n\nT=18 and 19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (-18,-29,right,6), so same, occupied at T=18,19\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied at T=18,19\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), span: [ -23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 ∈ if -23 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -23+12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 ≈1.916, so ΔT≤1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 +12ΔT => 12 ≤12ΔT => ΔT ≥1\n\nSo ΔT=1\n\nThen at ΔT=1, -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12), span: [49 +12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]\n\nSince 49+12ΔT ≥49 >0 for ΔT≥0, and min at ΔT=0 is 49 to 60, all positive, so 0 never in this span. So only first car matters for freeway 5.\n\nOccupied only at T=15+1=16\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, occupied at T=16\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied at T=16\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst: (12,1,right,12), span: [1 +12ΔT, 12+12ΔT]\n\n1+12ΔT ≥1>0, so always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12), same as before, always positive, 0 not in.\n\nBut span is [49+12ΔT,60+12ΔT], yes, min 49>0, so 0 never in for either car on freeway 8.\n\nSo freeway 8 is always safe? No car covers x=0 at any time.\n\nConfirm: for (12,1,right,12): at ΔT=0, [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1, [13,24], etc., all >0.\n\nSimilarly second car [49,60] etc.\n\nSo yes, freeway 8 never has a car at x=0.\n\nNow, also, the player can be on y=0 or y=9, but y=0 and y=9 have no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nIn the collision rule, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nNow, back to the occupations:\n\nLet's list for each y (freeway) and each turn T, if occupied (car at x=0).\n\nTurns: we care about turns from 15 onwards, but occupations might be at other times, but since we start at 15, we need for T>=15.\n\nFreeway y=1: occupied at T=31,32,33,34\n\ny=2: occupied at T=18,19\n\ny=3: occupied at T=18,19\n\ny=4: occupied at T=18,19\n\ny=5: occupied at T=16\n\ny=6: occupied at T=16\n\ny=7: occupied at T=16\n\ny=8: never occupied\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 15, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, and we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince we need to go up 5 units, minimum turns is 5 if we go up each turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied.\n\nAt turn 15, y=4.\n\nNow, freeway y=4 is occupied at T=18 and 19, but at turn 15, it might not be occupied yet.\n\nFirst, at turn 15, ΔT=0.\n\nFor y=4, freeway 4: at T=15, ΔT=0, span: from earlier, for freeway 4, car (-18,-29,right,6), span at T: [ -29 +6ΔT, -18 +6ΔT]\n\nΔT=0: [ -29, -18], which is -29 to -18, 0 not in, so not occupied at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at T=15:\n\ny=1: at T=15, ΔT=0, [ -59, -48], 0 not in\n\ny=2: [ -29,-18], 0 not in\n\ny=3: same, not\n\ny=4: same, not\n\ny=5: at T=15, first car [ -23,-12], 0 not in; second car [49,60], not\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: not occupied\n\nSo at turn 15, all freeways are safe, including y=4.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at turn 15, and it's safe.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up: actions U,U,U,U,U in 5 turns.\n\nBut check if we can be on each y without collision during the turns.\n\nLet's see the path:\n\nTurn 15: at y=4, safe as above.\n\nAfter action, say a_{15}, we move to y_{16}.\n\ny_{16} depends on a_{15}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we go up each turn:\n\nTurn 15: position y=4, action U, so y_{16} = 5\n\nTurn 16: position y=5, now at turn 16, we are on freeway y=5.\n\nNow, freeway 5 is occupied at T=16? From above, y=5 occupied at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, ΔT=1, for freeway 5, first car span: [ -23 +12(1), -12 +12(1)] = [ -23+12, -12+12] = [ -11, 0], which includes 0, so yes, occupied.\n\nThus, at turn 16, if player is on y=5, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=5 at turn 16.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 16, y=5, and it is occupied, so collision.\n\nSo direct up is not possible at turn 16.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5 at turn 16.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have issues.\n\nNow, y=6 and y=7 also occupied at T=16.\n\ny=6 occupied at T=16, y=7 at T=16.\n\ny=8 never occupied, y=4 occupied later, etc.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4, turn 15.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are occupied at turn 16, we cannot be on them at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, if we are on y=5,6, or 7, collision.\n\nBut at turn 16, position y_{16} depends on action at turn 15.\n\ny_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\ny_{15} =4.\n\nIf we do U at turn 15, y_{16}=5, then at turn 16 on y=5, occupied, collision.\n\nIf we do S, y_{16}=4, then at turn 16 on y=4.\n\nNow, freeway y=4 is occupied at T=18,19, but at T=16?

Safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we do D, y_{16}=3, then on y=3 at turn 16.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at T=18,19, but T=16, ΔT=1, span: [ -29 +6(1), -18 +6(1)] = [ -23, -12], not include 0, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up, so going down might not help.\n\nWe could stay or go down to avoid, but then we have to go up later.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we should try to go up when possible.\n\nNow, at turn 16, we cannot be on y=5,6,7 because they are occupied.\n\ny=5,6,7 all occupied at T=16.\n\ny=4,3,2,1,8,0,9 are safe at T=16.\n\ny=1: at T=16, ΔT=1, span [ -59+3(1), -48+3(1)] = [ -56, -45], not 0.\n\ny=2: [ -29+6, -18+6] = [ -23,-12], not\n\ny=3: same as above\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=8: safe always\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at turn 16, safe rows: y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9\n\nBut player is coming from turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, y=4, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, to y=5 at turn 16, but y=5 occupied at turn 16, collision.\n\nIf S, to y=4 at turn 16, safe as above.\n\nIf D, to y=3 at turn 16, also safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so going down to y=3 might delay.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=4 for now.\n\nThen at turn 16, position y=4 (if we did S at 15).\n\nThen at turn 16, we can choose action for turn 16.\n\nNow turn 16: position y=4, safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nBut if we go U to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nNow, at turn 17, if we are on y=5, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway y=5 occupied at T=16, but not necessarily at other times.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=2, for y=5, first car: [ -23 +12(2), -12 +12(2)] = [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car not relevant, so y=5 not occupied at T=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=17: freeway 6, similar to 5, at ΔT=2, [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], not 0, safe.\n\ny=7 at T=17: same, safe.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\nBut we need to move step by step.\n\nFrom turn 16, y=4.\n\nIf we do U at turn 16, then y_{17} =5.\n\nAt turn 17, position y=5, which is safe as above.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut there is a problem later with y=2,3,4 occupied at T=18,19.\n\nLet's list the dangerous turns.\n\nFreeway occupations:\n\n- y=5,6,7: dangerous only at T=16\n\n- y=2,3,4: dangerous at T=18 and T=19\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=31-34, but that's far, we might reach before then.\n\nSince min turns is 5, and we start at 15, if we can reach by turn 20, it should be fine, as T=31 is later.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nPlayer at turn 15, y=4.\n\nIf we do S at turn 15, then at turn 16, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, we can do U, to y=5 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, position y=5, which is safe since T=17 not occupied for y=5.\n\nThen from turn 17, y=5, we can do U to y=6 at turn 18.\n\nBut at turn 18, if y=6, is it occupied?\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied only at T=16, not at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, ΔT=3, for y=6, car (-12,-23,right,12), span [ -23+12*3, -12+12*3] = [ -23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], not 0.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=18: [ -23+36, -12+36]? For y=5, same car, but different freeway, but the car is on freeway 5, but at T=18, span [13,24] as above, no issue.\n\nBut at turn 18, we are considering moving to y=6.\n\nAt turn 17, y=5, action U, so y_{18}=6.\n\nAt turn 18, position y=6.\n\nNow, freeway y=6 at T=18: not occupied, as above.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 18: position y=6, action U, y_{19}=7.\n\nAt turn 19, position y=7.\n\ny=7 at T=19: freeway 7, car similar, at ΔT=4, [ -23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], not 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=8: turn 19, position y=7, action U, y_{20}=8.\n\nAt turn 20, position y=8, which is always safe.\n\nThen to y=9: action U, y_{21}=9.\n\nBut at turn 21, position y=9, and we need to reach (0,9), so when y_{t} =9, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, when we first reach y=9, that should be the end.\n\nBut in this case, we reached y=9 at turn 21.\n\nStart turn 15 y=4.\n\nAfter actions: let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 15: position y=4, we did S? In this sequence I assumed we did S at 15.\n\nTurn 15: action S, so y_{16} = y_{15} + 0 =4\n\nTurn 16: position y=4, action U, y_{17} =5\n\nTurn 17: position y=5, action U, y_{18} =6\n\nTurn 18: position y=6, action U, y_{19} =7\n\nTurn 19: position y=7, action U, y_{20} =8\n\nTurn 20: position y=8, action U, y_{21} =9\n\nNow, at turn 21, position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe need to check for collisions at each turn.\n\nTurn 15: y=4, freeway 4 at T=15: not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=4, freeway 4 at T=16: ΔT=1, [ -29+6, -18+6] = [ -23,-12], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=5, freeway 5 at T=17: ΔT=2, [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 18: y=6, freeway 6 at T=18: ΔT=3, [ -23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 19: y=7, freeway 7 at T=19: ΔT=4, [ -23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 20: y=8, freeway 8, never occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 21: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo this sequence works in 6 turns: from turn 15 to turn 21, but we reach at turn 21.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=15 to t=20, actions for t=15 to t=20, 6 actions, reach at t=21.\n\nTurn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=15, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nStart turn 15, y=4.\n\nAfter first action at t=15, y_{16} = something.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions at t=15 to t=20, that's 6 actions, y_{21} =9.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nMinimal is 5, but we had to stay at turn 15 to avoid being on y=5 at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 15, instead of staying, can we go down?\n\nBut that might take longer.\n\nGo to y=8 directly? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 15, instead of S, we can go down to y=3, but y=3 might be occupied later.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster.\n\nSuppose at turn 15, we do nothing, S, as above, takes 6 turns.\n\nBut at turn 15, if we do U, we go to y=5 at turn 16, but at turn 16, y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWhat if we go to another row at turn 16.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, action D, to y=3 at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, position y=3.\n\ny=3 at T=16: freeway 3, not occupied, as span [ -23,-12], safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, we can go up to y=4 at turn 17.\n\ny_{17}=4.\n\nAt turn 17, position y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 at T=17: ΔT=2, [ -29 +12, -18 +12] = [ -17, -6], not 0, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=5 at turn 18.\n\ny_{18}=5.\n\nAt turn 18, position y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=18: not occupied, as [13,24], safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at turn 19, y_{19}=6.\n\nAt turn 19, y=6, freeway 6 at T=19: ΔT=4, [ -23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], not 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at turn 20, y_{20}=7.\n\nAt turn 20, y=7, freeway 7 at T=20: ΔT=5, [ -23+60, -12+60] = [37,48], not 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at turn 21, y_{21}=8.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 22, y_{22}=9.\n\nThis takes longer, 7 actions? From turn 15 down to 16 y=3, then up.\n\nActions: t=15: D, y16=3\n\nt=16: U, y17=4\n\nt=17: U, y18=5\n\nt=18: U, y19=6\n\nt=19: U, y20=7\n\nt=20: U, y21=8\n\nt=21: U, y22=9\n\n7 turns, worse than previous.\n\nSo not better.\n\nCan we go to y=8 directly? But we have to go through y=5,6,7.\n\ny=8 is safe, but we need to get there.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6,7 are only dangerous at T=16, we can be on them at other times.\n\nIn the first sequence, we avoided being on them at T=16 by staying at y=4 for one extra turn.\n\nBut perhaps we can be on a different row at T=16.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, instead of S, can we go to y=8? But we can only move to adjacent, so from y=4, we can go to y=3,4,5.\n\nNot directly to 8.\n\nSo at turn 15, options are y=3,4,5 for turn 16, but y=5 not possible at T=16.\n\nSo only y=3 or y=4 at turn 16.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nIn the first sequence, with one stay, we reached in 6 turns.\n\nBut can we reach in 5 turns?\n\nSuppose we want to reach by turn 20, so y_{20}=9.\n\nStart y15=4.\n\nAfter 5 actions, y20=9.\n\nSo we need to go up 5 times in 5 turns: actions U,U,U,U,U at t=15 to 19.\n\nThen y16=5, y17=6, y18=7, y19=8, y20=9.\n\nNow check each turn:\n\nTurn 15: y=4, safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=5, but at T=16, y=5 occupied, collision. Not possible.\n\nIf we do not all U, but perhaps one S or D, but then y not increase, cannot reach y=9 in 5 turns from y=4.\n\nFor example, if we do one S, then y16=4, y17=5, etc., y20=8 or something.\n\nStart y15=4.\n\nIf actions: t15: S, y16=4\n\nt16: U, y17=5\n\nt17: U, y18=6\n\nt18: U, y19=7\n\nt19: U, y20=8\n\nThen y20=8, not 9. Need one more U to y21=9.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf t15: U, but cannot because collision at t16.\n\nt15: D, y16=3, then t16: U, y17=4, t17:U,y18=5, t18:U,y19=6, t19:U,y20=7, then need two more to 9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo indeed, with 5 actions, we cannot reach y=9 because we must spend one turn not moving up to avoid collision at t16.\n\nMinimal actions is 6, reaching at turn 21.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, it works.\n\nBut we have the issue of y=2,3,4 occupied at T=18 and 19.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 18, we are on y=6, not on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, turn 19, on y=7.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way to be faster.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 or something earlier.\n\nBut since we start at y=4, and need to go to 9, must pass through 5,6,7,8.\n\ny=8 is safe, but we need to get there.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 15, we go to y=3 or something, but not helpful.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at turn 16, but cannot, since from y=4, we can only go to 3,4,5.\n\nUnless we move multiple, but no, one step per turn.\n\nSo I think 6 turns is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to output the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn 15: S (stay at y=4)\n\nThen y16=4\n\nTurn 16: U (to y=5)\n\ny17=5\n\nTurn 17: U (to y=6)\n\ny18=6\n\nTurn 18: U (to y=7)\n\ny19=7\n\nTurn 19: U (to y=8)\n\ny20=8\n\nTurn 20: U (to y=9)\n\ny21=9\n\nSo actions from t=15 to t=20.\n\nNow, at turn 20, we are on y=8, action U to y=9.\n\nBut the position at turn t=20 is y=8, and we take action to go to y=9.\n\nThen at turn t=21, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in the collision, we only care when we are on the freeway during the turn.\n\nAt turn t=20, we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nAction U doesn't cause collision during move, I think; the collision is only based on position at that turn.\n\nFrom the note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and check cars on y_T.\n\nAfter action, you move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nSo no issue during move.\n\nIn this sequence, all positions are safe as checked.\n\nBut we have y=4 occupied at T=18 and 19, but in this sequence, at T=18, we are on y=6, not y=4; at T=19, on y=7.\n\nSo fine.\n\nCan we start going up immediately after?\n\nFor example, at turn 15, we can go to y=4 at turn 16, but we are already at y=4.\n\nSuppose we do nothing at turn 15, S, then at turn 16, we are at y=4, and now we can go up since y=5 is safe at T=17.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have to wait one turn.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 directly from some point, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=8 is always safe, we could go to y=8 and stay, but we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nIn this case, from y=4 to y=8, it takes 4 steps, but we have to avoid the dangers.\n\nWith the one turn delay, it works.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in 5 turns with different path.\n\nFor example, go down to y=3 at some point, but that would take more turns.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps at turn 15, we go to y=5, but cannot because at turn 16 collision.\n\nUnless we are not on y=5 at turn 16, but we have to be if we go there.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is below.\n\nSuppose at turn 15, we go down to y=3? But then we need to come back, more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think 6 turns is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions for turns starting from t_1=15.\n\nIn the sequence: actions from t=15 to t=20.\n\nNow, for each turn, the action.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen y21=9.\n\nBut at turn 20, we do U to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions, which is 6.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut we have to make sure about other constraints.\n\nFor example, at turn 18 and 19, y=4 is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by going to y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose at turn 15, we do S to stay at y=4 for turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, we are at y=4.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, but we need to go up.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn 16, we can go to y=5 at turn 17, etc., same as before.\n\nAt turn 16, we can go to y=3, but not helpful.\n\nOr to y=5, but y=5 at turn 17 is safe.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 19, we are at y=7, going to y=8.\n\ny=7 is safe at T=19.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=8, to y=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 earlier?\n\nSuppose we reach y=8 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=8 by turn 19 or something.\n\nStart y15=4.\n\nIf we go up every turn: y16=5 (but collision), not possible.\n\ny15=4, t15: U, y16=5 collision.\n\nNot.\n\nt15: S, y16=4\n\nThen t16: U, y17=5\n\nt17: U, y18=6\n\nt18: U, y19=7\n\nt19: U, y20=8\n\nThen need t20: U to y21=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter y17=5 at turn 17, we could go directly, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe, and we can move to it.\n\nBut from y=4, it takes 4 steps to y=8.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8 is if we go up each turn from start, but y16=5 collision.\n\nIf we start by staying, then go up: y16=4, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=8, then U to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nSame.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 19: that would require from y=4 to y=8 in 4 actions: t15 to t18 actions.\n\ny15=4, after action t15, y16; t16, y17; t17, y18; t18, y19.\n\nTo have y19=8, need to increase by 4 in 4 actions, so all U except possibly, but must be all U: actions U at t15,t16,t17,t18.\n\nThen y16=5, y17=6, y18=7, y19=8.\n\nNow, check turns:\n\nTurn 15: y=4, safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=5, at T=16, occupied, collision. Not possible.\n\nIf we do one S, then y19=7 or less, not 8.\n\nSo cannot reach y=8 by turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, minimal to reach y=9 is turn 21 with 6 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\ny20=9.\n\nThen from y15=4, need to increase by 5 in 5 actions: all U at t15 to t19.\n\nBut y16=5 at turn 16 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo indeed, 6 actions are needed.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have actions.\n\nBut in my sequence, at turn 19, we are at y=7, which is fine.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nAlso, we need to output for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1 =15.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nSo actions for t=15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nAs above: S, U, U, U, U, U\n\nIn the sequence: t15: S, t16: U, t17: U, t18: U, t19: U, t20: U\n\nThen y21=9.\n\nBut at t19: action U, y20=8? Let's track:\n\nt15: action S, so y16 = y15 + 0 = 4\n\nt16: action U, y17 = y16 +1 =5\n\nt17: action U, y18 =6\n\nt18: action U, y19 =7\n\nt19: action U, y20 =8\n\nt20: action U, y21 =9\n\nYes.\n\nWe could have different actions, but this seems fine.\n\nBut at turn 19, y=7, and we do U to y=8.\n\nBut turn 19 is T=19, and y=7 is freeway 7, which at T=19, as above, not occupied.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7, at T=19, ΔT=4, [ -23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], not 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=5? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps by going to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, but going down and up takes more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=0 at some point, but that would add turns, not reduce.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure that at no point we are on a dangerous freeway at the wrong time.\n\nIn this sequence, we avoided y=5,6,7 at T=16 by not being there, and for y=2,3,4 at T=18,19, we are not on them, so fine.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at turn 15, we go down to y=3, then at turn 16, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=4 at turn 17, etc., but it takes more turns, as before.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo to y=8 directly if possible, but cannot.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to output for each turn the action.\n\nNow, for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but in the answer format, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd in answer, Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 +0} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nIn this case, t_1=15, H=6, so actions for t=15 to t=20.\n\na_{15}, a_{16}, ..., a_{20}\n\nWith a_{15}=S, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U\n\nThen after a_{20}, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 19, we are at y=7, and action U to y=8.\n\nBut y=7 at turn 19 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where we go to y=8 earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 15, we do nothing, S.\n\nThen at turn 16, we are at y=4.\n\nNow, instead of going up, we could go to y=8? But we can only move one step, so to y=5 or y=3.\n\nNot directly.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, but never at x=0, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we don't go to y=8 until turn 20, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at turn 18 or something.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at turn 18.\n\ny15=4, actions: t15: U? But to y=5 collision at t16.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt15: S, y16=4\n\nt16: U, y17=5\n\nt17: U, y18=6\n\nThen to y=8, need to go to y=7 then y=8, so at best y19=7, y20=8.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, minimal H=6.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, all actions after the first are U, but first is S.\n\nPerhaps we can do D at some point, but not necessary.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at turn 15, we do D to y=3 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=3.\n\nThen t16: U to y=4 at t17.\n\nt17: U to y=5 at t18.\n\nt18: U to y=6 at t19.\n\nt19: U to y=7 at t20.\n\nt20: U to y=8 at t21.\n\nt21: U to y=9 at t22.\n\nBut this takes 7 actions, worse.\n\nSo not.\n\nThus, the first sequence is best.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 21.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn 19, when we are at y=7, is there any issue? T=19, freeway 7.\n\nCar on freeway 7: at T=19, ΔT=4, for the car (-12,-23,right,12), but h=-12, τ=-23, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 +12*4, -12 +12*4] = [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], yes, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, the other car (60,49,right,12), [49+48,60+48]=[97,108], not.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars, the player must not be on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at turn \\(T = 16\\) because these freeways are occupied by cars at \\(x = 0\\) at that turn, which would cause a collision. Similarly, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are occupied at turns \\(T = 18\\) and \\(T = 19\\), but these can be avoided by not being on those freeways at those turns.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 6, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 15:\n\n- At turn 15, staying at \\(y = 4\\) (action S) avoids moving to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16, which would cause a collision.\n- At turn 16, moving up to \\(y = 5\\) (action U) is safe because freeway \\(y = 5\\) is not occupied at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) (action U) is safe as freeway \\(y = 6\\) is not occupied at turn 17.\n- At turn 18, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) (action U) is safe as freeway \\(y = 7\\) is not occupied at turn 18.\n- At turn 19, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) (action U) is safe as freeway \\(y = 8\\) is never occupied.\n- At turn 20, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) (action U) reaches the goal, and \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway when it is occupied at \\(x = 0\\), and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 21.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t = 15\\) to \\(t = 20\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and their positions change over time based on their speed and direction. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current row at the start of the turn.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1=16. I need to find the positions at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so for turn T, Δt is the number of turns since t_1.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\nIf direction is right: span = [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]  (since head is at h, tail at τ, and it moves right, so both increase)\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s * (T - t_1), h + s * (T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - s * (T - t_1), τ - s * (T - t_1)]\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h = -45, τ = -56, d = right, s = 3\n\nSo at turn T, span = [-56 + 3*(T-16), -45 + 3*(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: h = -12, τ = -23, d = right, s = 6\n\nSpan = [-23 + 6*(T-16), -12 + 6*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-12, -23, right, 6) — probably a typo or same for multiple?\n\nThe table says:\n\n| 3 | \\((-12, -23, right, 6)\\) | so one car on freeway 3 with those params.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same two cars? (0, -11, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (24, 13, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFor freeway 8, the first car has head 24, tail 13? That might be a mistake because for right-moving, head should be larger than tail if moving right.\n\nLet's clarify the car notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor a right-moving car, as it moves right, the head is to the right, so h should be greater than τ. For left-moving, head is left, h less than τ.\n\nBut here, for freeway 1: h=-45, τ=-56, since -45 > -56, so head is at -45, tail at -56, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: h=-12, τ=-23, -12 > -23.\n\nFreeway 5: first car h=0, τ=-11, 0 > -11, so head at 0, tail at -11.\n\nSecond car h=-48, τ=-59, -48 > -59.\n\nNow freeway 8: first car h=24, τ=13? 24 > 13, so head at 24, tail at 13.\n\nBut tail 13 and head 24, that means the car is from 13 to 24, so at x=0, it might be covered if 13 <= 0 <=24.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, if y_T = k, and min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car on row k at time T.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but we just need one to cover 0.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4, and needs to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and since cars are only on y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there. But the player is at (0,y), so at y=0 or y=9, it's safe, but we need to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nBut to move between rows, we need to go through rows 5,6,7,8 to reach 9 from 4.\n\ny from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut rows 1,2,3,4 have cars too, but since we start at 4, we might need to move up or down, but since 9 is above, probably we go up.\n\nBut we can go down to avoid cars if needed, but y=0 is safe, but going down might not help since we need to go to 9.\n\nMinimal turns should be direct, but we have to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway, at what times the car covers x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway and each car, find when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the span is linear with time, we can find the time intervals when 0 is covered.\n\nThen, for a given freeway, the row is dangerous at times when any car covers 0.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving to a row at turn T, we need that at that turn T, for row y_T, it is not dangerous, meaning no car covers 0 at T.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the dangerous times relative to t_1=16.\n\nSet τ = T - 16, so τ=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for each car, span at τ: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] for right-moving, but τ is used for tail, confusing.\n\nUse Δt for the time difference.\n\nSet t = T - t_1, so t=0 at turn 16.\n\nThen for a car with tail τ, head h, speed s, right-moving:\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\n0 is covered if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo, τ + s*t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*t\n\nSince for right-moving, τ <= h, so the inequalities are:\n\nτ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nWhich implies:\n\nτ + s*t <= 0  => t <= -τ/s\n\nAnd 0 <= h + s*t => t >= -h/s\n\nSo t must satisfy: -h/s <= t <= -τ/s\n\nSince s > 0, and τ < h, -τ/s > -h/s, so the interval is [ -h/s, -τ/s ]\n\nt >= ceil( -h/s ) and t <= floor( -τ/s )? Since t is integer, we need to find integer t where the inequalities hold.\n\nBut t is turn number, so discrete.\n\nSimilarly, for the span to contain 0, we need τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nSince t integer, we can solve for t.\n\nNow for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, τ = -56, h = -45, s=3\n\nSo t must satisfy: -h/s <= t <= -τ/s\n\n- (-45)/3 = 45/3 = 15\n\n- (-56)/3 = 56/3 ≈ 18.666\n\nSo t >= 15 and t <= 18.666, since t integer, t=15,16,17,18\n\nt=15,16,17,18\n\nBut t=0 is current time, which is turn 16, so t=0 corresponds to τ=0.\n\nt is offset from t_1=16, so t=0: turn 16\n\nt=1: turn 17, etc.\n\nFor freeway 1, dangerous at t=15,16,17,18\n\nt=15: turn 16 + (15-16)? No.\n\nt = T - t_1, so at T=16, t=0; T=17, t=1, etc.\n\nBut here t=15,16,17,18 correspond to absolute turns.\n\nt=15: T = t_1 + t = 16 + 15? No.\n\nt = T - t_1, so if t=15, T = t_1 + t = 16 + 15 = 31\n\nSimilarly, t=16, T=32; t=17, T=33; t=18, T=34\n\nBut we are at t=0, which is T=16.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t=0: τ + s*t = -56 + 3*0 = -56, h + s*t = -45 + 0 = -45\n\n-56 <= 0 <= -45? 0 <= -45 is false, so not covered. Similarly, at t=0, not dangerous.\n\nt=15: τ + s*15 = -56 + 45 = -11, h + s*15 = -45 + 45 = 0\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0, true, since 0 <= 0.\n\nSimilarly, t=16: τ + s*16 = -56 + 48 = -8, h + s*16 = -45 + 48 = 3, -8 <= 0 <= 3, true.\n\nt=17: -56+51=-5, -45+51=6, -5<=0<=6 true\n\nt=18: -56+54=-2, -45+54=9, -2<=0<=9 true\n\nt=19: -56+57=1, -45+57=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<=12 true but 1<=0 false, so not covered.\n\nSo dangerous at t=15,16,17,18, i.e., turns T=31,32,33,34.\n\nBut since we start at t=0, which is before, so for early turns, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, τ=-23, h=-12, s=6\n\nt must satisfy: -h/s <= t <= -τ/s\n\n-(-12)/6 = 12/6 = 2\n\n-(-23)/6 = 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nSo t >= 2 and t <= 3.833, so t=2,3\n\nAt t=2: τ + s t = -23 + 12 = -11, h + s t = -12 + 12 = 0, -11<=0<=0 true\n\nt=3: -23+18=-5, -12+18=6, -5<=0<=6 true\n\nt=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, 1<=0 false\n\nSo dangerous at t=2,3 i.e. T=18,19\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Car (-12,-23,right,6), so same, dangerous at t=2,3 T=18,19\n\nFreeway 4: same, dangerous at t=2,3 T=18,19\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12) so h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nt must satisfy: -h/s <= t <= -τ/s\n\n-0/12 =0, -(-11)/12=11/12≈0.916\n\nSo t >= 0 and t <= 0.916, so t=0\n\nAt t=0: τ + s t = -11 +0 = -11, h + s t = 0 +0 =0, -11<=0<=0 true\n\nt=1: τ + s t = -11+12=1, h + s t =0+12=12, 1<=0 false\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/12=48/12=4\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/12=59/12≈4.916\n\nt >=4 and t<=4.916, so t=4\n\nAt t=4: τ + s t = -59 + 48 = -11, h + s t = -48 + 48 =0, -11<=0<=0 true\n\nt=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, 1<=0 false\n\nSo for freeway 5, first car dangerous at t=0, second at t=4.\n\nThus dangerous at t=0 and t=4, i.e., T=16 and T=20.\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? (0,-11,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSo same as above: dangerous at t=0 and t=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, dangerous at t=0 and t=4.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nt must satisfy: -h/s <= t <= -τ/s\n\n-24/12 = -2\n\n-13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nSo t >= -2 and t <= -1.083\n\nSince t integer, t >= ceil(-2) = -2? t >= -2 and t <= -1.083, so t <= -2? -1.083, so t <= -2 since t integer? t <= -1.083 means t <= -2 because -2 < -1.083 < -1, so t <= -2.\n\nt >= -2 and t <= -1.083\n\nt >= -2, and t <= -1.083, since t integer, possible t: -2, but -2 <= -1.083? -2 < -1.083, yes, and -2 >= -2.\n\nt=-1: -1 >= -2 true, but -1 <= -1.083? -1 > -1.083, so false.\n\nt must satisfy both: t >= -h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\nt <= -τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nSo t >= -2 and t <= -1.083\n\nSince t integer, t <= -1.083 implies t <= -2 (because -2 < -1.083, and -1 > -1.083)\n\nFor example, t=-2: -2 <= -1.083 true? -2 < -1.083, yes.\n\nt=-1: -1 <= -1.083? -1 > -1.083, so no.\n\nSimilarly, t >= -2, so only t=-2 possible.\n\nNow at t=-2: τ + s t = 13 + 12*(-2) = 13 - 24 = -11\n\nh + s t = 24 - 24 = 0\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0 true\n\nt=-1: τ + s t =13 +12*(-1)=13-12=1, h + s t=24-12=12, 1<=0 false\n\nt=-3: τ + s t=13 +12*(-3)=13-36=-23, h + s t=24-36=-12, -23<=0<=-12? 0<=-12 false\n\nSo only dangerous at t=-2, which is T= t_1 + t =16 -2=14, which is in the past, so not relevant for future turns.\n\nSecond car on freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,12) same as before, dangerous at t=4, as for freeway 5 second car.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=12, so -h/s = -(-48)/12=4, -τ/s=59/12≈4.916, so t=4\n\nThus for freeway 8, dangerous only at t=4 from second car, since first car is only at past time.\n\nSo dangerous at t=4, T=20.\n\nNow summarize dangerous times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: dangerous at t=15,16,17,18 (T=31 to 34)\n\n- Row 2: dangerous at t=2,3 (T=18,19)\n\n- Row 3: dangerous at t=2,3 (T=18,19)\n\n- Row 4: dangerous at t=2,3 (T=18,19)\n\n- Row 5: dangerous at t=0 and t=4 (T=16 and 20)\n\n- Row 6: dangerous at t=0 and t=4 (T=16 and 20)\n\n- Row 7: dangerous at t=0 and t=4 (T=16 and 20)\n\n- Row 8: dangerous at t=4 (T=20)\n\nt=0 is current turn, which is turn 16.\n\nPlayer starts at row 4 at turn 16, t=0.\n\nAt turn 16, row 4: is it dangerous?\n\nRow 4 dangerous at t=2,3 (T=18,19), so at t=0, not dangerous. Similarly, row 5,6,7 dangerous at t=0 and t=4.\n\nAt t=0, row 5 is dangerous, row 6 dangerous, row 7 dangerous.\n\nBut player is at row 4 at t=0, which is not dangerous.\n\nNow, we need to go to row 9.\n\nSince rows 0 and 9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer can move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nStart at y=4.\n\nGoal y=9.\n\nMinimal steps without cars: from 4 to 9, need 5 up moves, but since we can stay or move down, but up is direct.\n\nWith cars, we need to avoid being on a dangerous row at the wrong time.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times again:\n\n- Row 1: dangerous t=15-18 (far future)\n\n- Row 2: dangerous t=2,3\n\n- Row 3: dangerous t=2,3\n\n- Row 4: dangerous t=2,3\n\n- Row 5: dangerous t=0,4\n\n- Row 6: dangerous t=0,4\n\n- Row 7: dangerous t=0,4\n\n- Row 8: dangerous t=4\n\nt=0 is now, turn 16.\n\nPlayer at y=4, t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up: y=4 to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut row 5 is dangerous at t=0 and t=4.\n\nAt t=0, row 5 is dangerous, so if we move to row 5 at turn 16, we would be on row 5 at turn 16, which is dangerous.\n\nHow does movement work?\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn T, we are on row y_T, and we choose a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if on row y_T and y_T is dangerous at time T.\n\nAt turn T=16, t=0, player is at y=4.\n\ny=4 is row 4, which at t=0 is safe, since dangerous only at t=2,3.\n\nNow, we choose action a_{16}, which will set y_{17}.\n\nIf we choose U, y_{17} = 5.\n\nThen at turn T=17, t=1, we are on row 5.\n\nNow, is row 5 dangerous at t=1?\n\nFrom above, row 5 dangerous only at t=0 and t=4.\n\nt=0: T=16, t=4: T=20.\n\nt=1: not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 dangerous at t=0 and t=4, so at t=1, safe.\n\nRow 7 same.\n\nRow 8 dangerous at t=4 only.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nWe want to minimize turns, so ideally go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at turn 16: y=4\n\nAfter action, at turn 17: y=?\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we move one row per up move, minimal turns from y=4 to y=9 is 5 moves: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we might need to wait or detour to avoid dangerous times.\n\nFirst, possible to go directly?\n\nSuppose we go up each turn.\n\nTurn 16: at y=4, choose a_{16} = U, then y_{17} = 5\n\nAt turn 17, t=1, y=5, row 5 at t=1 is safe (not dangerous).\n\nThen turn 17: choose U, y_{18} = 6\n\nAt turn 18, t=2, y=6, row 6 at t=2.\n\nRow 6 dangerous at t=0 and t=4, t=2 is not dangerous, so safe.\n\nThen turn 18: choose U, y_{19} = 7\n\nAt turn 19, t=3, y=7, row 7 at t=3.\n\nRow 7 dangerous at t=0 and t=4, t=3 not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen turn 19: choose U, y_{20} = 8\n\nAt turn 20, t=4, y=8, row 8 at t=4.\n\nRow 8 dangerous at t=4, yes! From above, dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 20, on row 8, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter y_{19}=7 at turn 19, if we choose S instead of U, y_{20}=7, but at turn 20, t=4, row 7 is dangerous at t=4, so also collision.\n\nIf we choose D, y_{20}=6, but row 6 dangerous at t=4, collision.\n\nSo from turn 19 at y=7, all actions lead to dangerous rows at turn 20.\n\nBut we need to go to y=8 or something.\n\nProblem is that at t=4, multiple rows are dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, rows 5,6,7,8 are dangerous at t=4 except row 8 only at t=4, rows 5,6,7 at t=4.\n\nRow 5 dangerous t=0 and t=4\n\nRow 6 t=0 and t=4\n\nRow 7 t=0 and t=4\n\nRow 8 t=4\n\nSo at t=4, all rows 5-8 are dangerous except possibly, but row 4 is dangerous at t=2,3, not t=4.\n\nRow 4 dangerous t=2,3.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 5,6,7,8 at turn when t=4.\n\nt=4 is turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, rows 5,6,7 are dangerous, but we are not on them at t=0.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 20, we end up on row 8, which is dangerous.\n\nWe need to delay or advance the movement so that we are not on rows 5-8 at t=4.\n\nSince we start at t=0, we can go up slowly or down to kill time.\n\nMinimal H, so we don't want to take extra turns if possible.\n\nAnother idea: go up to row 9 before t=4 or after.\n\nt=4 is turn 20, we are at turn 16 now.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, min 5 moves, so we can reach at turn 21 if we start moving at turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: y=4\n\nAfter 0 moves: still y=4 at turn 16\n\nAfter 1 move: turn 17, y=5\n\nAfter 2 moves: turn 18, y=6\n\nAfter 3 moves: turn 19, y=7\n\nAfter 4 moves: turn 20, y=8\n\nAfter 5 moves: turn 21, y=9\n\nAt turn 20, y=8, t=4, dangerous.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at turn 20, we are on y=8, which is dangerous, so collision at turn 20.\n\nWe need to be safe at every turn until we reach y=9.\n\nAt turn when we reach y=9, it is safe.\n\nBut during the path, all positions must be safe.\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, if we are on y=8, it is dangerous.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=8 at turn 20, or not on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, avoid being on rows 5,6,7,8 at t=4.\n\nAlso, rows 2,3,4 at t=2,3, but we might not be there.\n\nSince we are going up, rows 2,3,4 are below, we might not need to go back.\n\nBut we can go down to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach y=9 before t=4.\n\nt=4 is turn 20.\n\nCurrent turn 16, t=0.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=4, need to increase y by 5.\n\nEach up move takes one turn.\n\nIf we start moving up at turn 16: to y=5 at turn 17\n\ny=6 at turn 18\n\ny=7 at turn 19\n\ny=8 at turn 20\n\ny=9 at turn 21\n\nAt turn 20, we are at y=8, t=4, dangerous.\n\nIf we could be faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so impossible to reach before turn 21.\n\nTurn 16: at y=4, after action, turn 17: y=5 or other.\n\nEarliest to be at y=5 is turn 17.\n\nThen y=6 at 18, y=7 at 19, y=8 at 20, y=9 at 21.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at some turn, and if that turn is 20, it is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or move down, we arrive later.\n\nBut at turn 20, y=8 is bad.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nBut row 8 is only dangerous at t=4, so at other times, it is safe.\n\nFor example, at t=1,2,3,5,etc.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nIn the path above, we are at y=8 at turn 20, t=4.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 at turn 19 or turn 21, etc.\n\nBut from the sequence, if we go directly, we are at y=8 at turn 20.\n\nTo be at y=8 earlier, we need to reach y=8 faster, but from y=4, min to y=8 is 4 up moves: to y=5,6,7,8 in 4 turns, from turn 17 to 20, but turn 17:y=5, 18:y=6, 19:y=7, 20:y=8, same as before.\n\nIf we start later, but then we might be later at y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 via a different path or with waiting.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, instead of moving up, we stay or move down.\n\nBut moving down might not help.\n\nLet's list safe times for each row.\n\nSince rows 1-4 have dangerous times at t=2,3 or later, but we start from row 4.\n\nRow 4: dangerous at t=2,3 (T=18,19)\n\nSo at t=0,1,4,5,... safe except t=2,3.\n\nt=0: safe, t=1: safe, t=2: dangerous, t=3: dangerous, t=4: safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly, row 5: dangerous at t=0,4; so safe at t=1,2,3,5,6,...\n\nt=0 dangerous, t=4 dangerous, so safe at t=1,2,3,5,6,...\n\nSimilarly row 6: safe at t=1,2,3,5,6,...\n\nRow 7: safe at t=1,2,3,5,6,...\n\nRow 8: dangerous only at t=4, so safe at t=0,1,2,3,5,6,... except t=4.\n\nt=0: for row 8 at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, row 8: from above, dangerous only at t=4, so at t=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 at t=0 to y=9.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nThe critical point is to avoid t=4 for rows 5-8.\n\nt=4 is turn 20.\n\nWe can be on row 4 or below at t=4, or on row 9, or on safe rows.\n\nBut row 4 at t=4 is safe, since dangerous only t=2,3.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 at t=4: row 3 dangerous at t=2,3, so at t=4 safe.\n\netc.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSince we must pass through rows 5 to 8 to reach 9, and each takes a turn, we need to be on those rows at times when they are safe.\n\nFor row 5: must be at time when t ≠0 and t≠4, so t=1,2,3,5,...\n\nSimilarly row 6: same, t=1,2,3,5,...\n\nRow 7: t=1,2,3,5,...\n\nRow 8: must be at time t≠4, so t=0,1,2,3,5,...\n\nIn the minimal path, we are on each row for one turn, at consecutive turns.\n\nSuppose we are on row 5 at time t_a, row 6 at t_b, row 7 at t_c, row 8 at t_d, then to row 9 at t_e.\n\nWith t_b = t_a +1 or more if we stay, but to minimize, we move each turn.\n\nAssume we move up each turn when possible.\n\nThen t_b = t_a +1, t_c = t_a +2, t_d = t_a +3, t_e = t_a +4.\n\nWe start from row 4 at t=0.\n\nAfter first action, to row 5 at turn 17, t=1.\n\nThen to row 6 at turn 18, t=2\n\nThen to row 7 at turn 19, t=3\n\nThen to row 8 at turn 20, t=4\n\nThen to row 9 at turn 21, t=5\n\nNow, row 5 at t=1: safe, since row 5 safe at t=1\n\nRow 6 at t=2: row 6 safe at t=2? Row 6 dangerous only t=0,4, so t=2 safe, yes.\n\nRow 7 at t=3: dangerous only t=0,4, so t=3 safe.\n\nRow 8 at t=4: dangerous, problem.\n\nSo at row 8, t=4, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be on row 8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 8 at t=3 or t=5.\n\nBut in the sequence, if we are on row 7 at t=3, then to row 8 at t=4.\n\nIf we stay on row 7 longer, but at turn 20, t=4, row 7 is dangerous, so we cannot stay on row 7 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to row 8 earlier.\n\nBut to be on row 8 earlier, we need to reach it faster.\n\nFrom start, at t=0, y=4.\n\nIf we move up immediately to y=5 at t=1 (turn 17)\n\nBut we can stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nAt y=4, safe except t=2,3.\n\nt=0: safe, t=1: safe, t=2: dangerous, t=3: dangerous, t=4: safe, etc.\n\nSo at turn 16, t=0, y=4 safe.\n\nTurn 17, if we stay, y=4, t=1, safe.\n\nTurn 18, if we stay, y=4, t=2, dangerous! Because row 4 dangerous at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we move down, y=3 at turn 18, t=2, row 3 dangerous at t=2, also dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 18, if we are on row 4 or 3 or 2, it is dangerous.\n\nRow 2,3,4 dangerous at t=2,3.\n\nSo we must not be on rows 2,3,4 at t=2 or t=3.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-8 at t=4.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to be on row 5 at a safe time, i.e., t=1,2,3,5,...\n\nBut t=2 and t=3, rows 2,3,4 are dangerous, but row 5 is safe at t=2,3.\n\nRow 5 at t=2: safe, since dangerous only t=0,4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut if we are on row 5 at t=2, that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at t=2 safe, etc.\n\nIn the direct path, we were on row 5 at t=1, row 6 at t=2, row 7 at t=3, all safe, but row 8 at t=4 dangerous.\n\nSo to avoid row 8 at t=4, we can either:\n\n- Be on row 8 before t=4 or after t=4.\n\nBut before t=4: t=0,1,2,3\n\nt=0 is turn 16, we are at y=4, not y=8.\n\nTo reach y=8 by t=3, for example.\n\nt=3 is turn 19.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=0 to y=8 at t=3.\n\nMinimal moves: 4 up moves, but in 3 turns? From turn 16 to turn 19 is 3 actions.\n\nTurn 16 action to y17, turn 17 to y18, turn 18 to y19.\n\nAfter three actions, at turn 19, y=?\n\nIf all up: start y4, after first action (turn16) to y5 at turn17\n\nAfter second action (turn17) to y6 at turn18\n\nAfter third action (turn18) to y7 at turn19\n\nAt turn19, y=7.\n\nTo be at y8 at turn19, we need to be at y7 at turn18 or earlier.\n\nAt turn18, y=6 if we go directly.\n\nTo reach y8 at turn19, we need to have moved up faster, but impossible since only one move per turn.\n\nEarliest to be at y5 is turn17, y6 turn18, y7 turn19, y8 turn20.\n\nSo we cannot be at y8 before turn20.\n\nAfter t=4, we can be at y8 at t=5 or later.\n\nFor example, at turn21, y=8, t=5, which is safe for row8.\n\nThen to y9 at turn22.\n\nBut that takes more turns.\n\nWe can stay on some row to delay.\n\nFor example, stay on row4 until it is safe, but row4 dangerous at t=2,3, so at t=0 and t=1 safe, but t=2 and t=3 dangerous.\n\nSo we can be on row4 at t=0 and t=1.\n\nTurn16: y4, t=0 safe\n\nTurn17: if stay, y4, t=1 safe\n\nTurn18: if stay, y4, t=2 dangerous, not possible.\n\nSo we must leave row4 by turn17 or earlier, but at turn17, if we move, we go to y5 or y3.\n\nIf to y5 at turn17, t=1.\n\nThen at turn17, y5, t=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we can go to y6 at turn18, t=2.\n\nRow6 at t=2 safe.\n\nThen to y7 at turn19, t=3.\n\nRow7 at t=3 safe.\n\nThen to y8 at turn20, t=4, dangerous.\n\nSame problem.\n\nFrom y5 at turn17, t=1, we can stay on y5.\n\nBut row5 safe at t=1,2,3.\n\nAt turn18, if stay on y5, t=2, safe.\n\nThen turn19, if stay, y5, t=3, safe.\n\nThen turn20, if stay, y5, t=4, dangerous! Row5 dangerous at t=4.\n\nSo cannot stay at turn20.\n\nAt turn19, we can move up to y6.\n\nBut at turn20, if on y6, t=4, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if move to y7 or y8, all dangerous at t=4.\n\nSo we need to be on a safe row at t=4.\n\nSafe rows at t=4: row4, row3, etc., or row9.\n\nBut row4 at t=4: row4 dangerous only t=2,3, so at t=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly row3 at t=4 safe.\n\nRow2 at t=4: row2 dangerous at t=2,3, so at t=4 safe.\n\nRow1 at t=4 safe, since dangerous later.\n\nRow9 always safe.\n\nSo at t=4, safe rows are y=0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 dangerous.\n\nWe need to be on one of safe rows at turn20, t=4.\n\nThen after that, go to y9.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn19 in some paths.\n\nLet's plan from the beginning with waiting.\n\nStart turn16, t=0, y=4 safe.\n\nAction a16: we can choose S, U, or D.\n\nIf we choose S, then turn17, y=4, t=1 safe.\n\nNow at turn17, y=4, t=1.\n\nWe must leave because at turn18, if on y=4, t=2 dangerous.\n\nSo at turn17, we need to move to y3 or y5.\n\nIf to y3, row3 at turn18, t=2, which is dangerous, since row3 dangerous at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, to y5 at turn18, t=2, row5 at t=2 safe.\n\nSo better to go to y5.\n\nSo at turn17, choose U, then turn18 y=5, t=2.\n\nAt turn18, y=5, t=2 safe.\n\nNow, we can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf we go to y6 at turn19, y=6, t=3.\n\nRow6 at t=3 safe (dangerous only t=0,4).\n\nThen at turn19, y=6, t=3.\n\nNow, if we go to y7 at turn20, y=7, t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf stay, y=6, t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf go down, y=5, t=4 dangerous.\n\nAll bad.\n\nAt turn18, y=5, t=2, we can choose to stay: then turn19 y=5, t=3 safe.\n\nThen at turn19, y=5, t=3.\n\nNow, at turn20, we need to be on a safe row for t=4.\n\nIf we go up to y6, y=6 at turn20, t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf stay, y=5, t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf go down to y4, y=4 at turn20, t=4, row4 safe at t=4.\n\nThen at turn20, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y9.\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, we could go down to y3 at some point.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nSequence so far:\n\nTurn16: y=4, safe. Action S, so stay.\n\nTurn17: y=4, t=1 safe. Action U, to y5.\n\nTurn18: y=5, t=2 safe. Action S, stay.\n\nTurn19: y=5, t=3 safe. Action D? To y4.\n\nTurn20: y=4, t=4 safe. (since row4 safe at t=4)\n\nNow at turn20, y=4.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn20, go to y5 at turn21, t=5.\n\nRow5 at t=5: dangerous only t=0,4, so t=5 safe.\n\nThen to y6 at turn22, t=6 safe.\n\nTo y7 at turn23, t=7 safe.\n\nTo y8 at turn24, t=8 safe (row8 dangerous only t=4)\n\nTo y9 at turn25, t=9.\n\nBut this takes many turns: from turn16 to turn25, 9 turns to reach y9 at turn25.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nMinimal is 5 moves, but with delay.\n\nWe were at y=4 at turn20, which is safe.\n\nBut we wasted turns staying and going down.\n\nFrom turn19 y=5, instead of going down to y4, we could go up but avoid t=4.\n\nAt turn19 y=5, t=3, if we go to y6, then at turn20 y=6 t=4 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps go directly to a row that is safe at t=4.\n\nAnother idea: go up to row 8 before t=4, but impossible as we saw.\n\nOr after.\n\nBut we can be on row 8 at t=3 or t=5.\n\nt=3 is turn19.\n\nTo be at y8 at turn19.\n\nFrom start, at turn19, after 3 actions.\n\nTurn16: action to y17\n\nTurn17: action to y18\n\nTurn18: action to y19\n\nIf all up: y5 at17, y6 at18, y7 at19.\n\nTo be at y8 at19, need to be at y7 at18 or earlier.\n\nAt turn18, if y7, but from above, at turn18 we are at y6 if going directly.\n\nHow to be at y7 at turn18?\n\nThat means at turn18, after action, y=7.\n\nSo at turn17, we were at y=6 or y=7 or y=8.\n\nBut at turn17, we start from y=4 at turn16.\n\nIf at turn16 action U, to y5 at17.\n\nThen at turn17 action U, to y6 at18.\n\nThen at turn18 action U, to y7 at19.\n\nSo at turn18, we are at y6, not y7.\n\nTo be at y7 at turn18, we need at turn17 to be at y7, so from turn16, if we move up twice? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nImpossible to be at y7 before turn18.\n\nTurn16: after action, turn17 position.\n\nEarliest y5 at17.\n\nThen y6 at18.\n\ny7 at19.\n\ny8 at20.\n\nCannot be at y8 before20.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y8 at19.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y8 after t=4, e.g., at turn21, y8, t=5 safe.\n\nThen to y9 at22.\n\nBut to reach y8 at21, we need to be at y7 at20 or earlier.\n\nBut at turn20, if on y7, t=4 dangerous.\n\nSo we need to be on a safe row at turn20.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nFor example, at turn19, we need to be on a row that can move to a position where at turn20 we are safe.\n\nLet's list the state at each turn.\n\nDenote the turn and y position.\n\nTurn 16 (t=0): y=4, safe.\n\nNow, choose action for turn16.\n\nIf a16 = U, then turn17 y=5, t=1, row5 safe at t=1.\n\nIf a16 = S, turn17 y=4, t=1, safe.\n\nIf a16 = D, turn17 y=3, t=1, row3 at t=1: row3 dangerous at t=2,3, so t=1 safe.\n\nBut if we go to y3, we have to come back, might take more turns.\n\nProbably not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, stay or up.\n\nNow, from turn17.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately: a16=U, turn17 y=5 t=1 safe.\n\nThen at turn17, we choose action.\n\nIf a17=U, then turn18 y=6 t=2, row6 safe at t=2.\n\nThen a18=U, turn19 y=7 t=3, row7 safe at t=3.\n\nThen at turn19, y=7 t=3.\n\nNow, for turn20, if we choose U, turn20 y=8 t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf S, turn20 y=7 t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf D, turn20 y=6 t=4 dangerous.\n\nAll dangerous.\n\nSo we need at turn19 to choose an action such that at turn20 we are on a safe row.\n\nBut from y=7, we can go to y=6,7, or 8, all dangerous at t=4.\n\nOr to y=7, same.\n\nNo, y=7 is row7, dangerous at t=4.\n\ny=6 dangerous, y=8 dangerous.\n\nThe only safe rows at t=4 are y=0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\nFrom y=7, we can go down to y=6, but dangerous, or to y=8 dangerous, or stay y=7 dangerous.\n\nWe cannot reach y=4 or below in one move from y=7.\n\nFrom y=7, action D goes to y=6, which is dangerous at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, action S to y=7 dangerous.\n\nAction U to y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo from y=7 at turn19, there is no action that puts us on a safe row at turn20 for t=4.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=7 at turn19.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=6 at turn19, same problem, because from y=6, to y=5,6,7 all dangerous at t=4.\n\ny=5 dangerous, y=6 dangerous, y=7 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 at turn19: to y=4,5,6; y=4 safe, but y=5 and y=6 dangerous.\n\nFrom y=5, action D to y=4, which is safe at t=4.\n\nAction S to y=5 dangerous, action U to y=6 dangerous.\n\nSo we can go down to y=4.\n\nSimilarly, from y=4 at turn19, we can go to y=3,4,5; y=3 safe at t=4, y=4 safe, y=5 dangerous.\n\nSo possible to be safe.\n\nBut we need to be at turn19 on a row from which we can move to a safe row at turn20.\n\nSpecifically, at turn19, we need to be on y=4 or y=5, so that we can go down to y=4 or stay at y=4, or from y=5 go down to y=4.\n\nFrom y=4, we can also go to y=3 or stay.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn the earlier path, we were at y=5 at turn18 or turn19.\n\nLet's start from turn16.\n\nAt turn16, y=4 t=0 safe.\n\nWe can choose to stay: a16=S, then turn17 y=4 t=1 safe.\n\nNow at turn17, y=4 t=1, we must move because if stay, turn18 y=4 t=2 dangerous.\n\nSo a17 must be U or D.\n\nIf a17=U, turn18 y=5 t=2 safe.\n\nThen at turn18, y=5 t=2 safe.\n\nNow, we need to be at a position at turn19 such that we can be safe at turn20.\n\nAt turn18, y=5, we can choose:\n\n- a18=S: then turn19 y=5 t=3 safe (row5 safe at t=3)\n\n- a18=U: turn19 y=6 t=3 safe\n\n- a18=D: turn19 y=4 t=3, but row4 dangerous at t=3, so collision at turn19.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo a18 cannot be D, because y=4 at t=3 dangerous.\n\nSo only S or U.\n\nIf a18=S, turn19 y=5 t=3 safe.\n\nThen at turn19, y=5 t=3, we can choose a19.\n\nFor turn20, we need y safe at t=4.\n\nIf a19=S, turn20 y=5 t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf a19=U, turn20 y=6 t=4 dangerous.\n\nIf a19=D, turn20 y=4 t=4 safe.\n\nSo we can choose a19=D, then turn20 y=4 t=4 safe.\n\nThen from turn20, y=4, we can go up.\n\nIf at turn18 we chose a18=U, then turn19 y=6 t=3 safe.\n\nThen at turn19, y=6 t=3, for turn20, if a19=D, turn20 y=5 t=4 dangerous.\n\na19=S, y=6 t=4 dangerous.\n\na19=U, y=7 t=4 dangerous.\n\nAll dangerous, so no safe action from y=6 at turn19 for turn20.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option is to be at y=5 at turn19, then go down to y=4 at turn20.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn16: y=4, safe. Action: S (stay) to remain at y=4 for turn17.\n\nTurn17: y=4, t=1 safe. Action: U to go to y=5 for turn18.\n\nTurn18: y=5, t=2 safe. Action: S (stay) to remain at y=5 for turn19.\n\nTurn19: y=5, t=3 safe. Action: D (down) to go to y=4 for turn20.\n\nTurn20: y=4, t=4 safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn20, y=4, safe.\n\nWe can go up directly.\n\nAction a20: U, then turn21 y=5, t=5.\n\nRow5 at t=5: dangerous only t=0,4, so t=5 safe.\n\nThen a21: U, turn22 y=6, t=6 safe.\n\na22: U, turn23 y=7, t=7 safe.\n\na23: U, turn24 y=8, t=8 safe (row8 dangerous only t=4)\n\na24: U, turn25 y=9, t=9 safe.\n\nReached y=9 at turn25.\n\nBut this is turn 25, with H=10 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn16 to turn24 to reach at turn25.\n\nThe player position at turn T after actions.\n\nStart at turn16: position set.\n\nAfter each action, position at next turn.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, after H actions.\n\nIn this case, from turn16 to turn25, that's 9 turns later, so 9 actions to reach at turn25.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nNotice that after turn20, we are at y=4, and t=4 is past, so rows 5-8 are safe except for other times, but t=4 is the only dangerous time for them in near future.\n\nFrom turn20 y=4, we can go up faster.\n\nBut we need to avoid any other dangers.\n\nFor example, row4 is dangerous at t=2,3, but t=4 is later, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2,3 dangerous at t=2,3, past.\n\nNow, from turn20 y=4, t=4.\n\nAction a20: U, turn21 y=5, t=5 safe.\n\na21: U, turn22 y=6, t=6 safe.\n\na22: U, turn23 y=7, t=7 safe.\n\na23: U, turn24 y=8, t=8 safe.\n\na24: U, turn25 y=9, t=9 safe.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at turn16, we go up immediately.\n\na16: U, turn17 y=5, t=1 safe.\n\nThen at turn17, instead of going up, we stay.\n\na17: S, turn18 y=5, t=2 safe.\n\nThen a18: S, turn19 y=5, t=3 safe.\n\nThen a19: D, turn20 y=4, t=4 safe. (same as before)\n\nThen same as above.\n\nFrom turn19 y=5, we go down to y=4 at turn20.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at turn19, which is row5, safe at t=3.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, after turn20 y=4, we go up, but we need 5 moves to y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can be at a higher row at turn20.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=3 or something, but y=4 is fine.\n\nAnother idea: go to row 8 after t=4.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn21.\n\nThen y=9 at turn22.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn21, we need to be at y=7 at turn20.\n\nBut at turn20, y=7 is dangerous if t=4.\n\nSo we need to be at y=7 after t=4, e.g., turn21 y=7.\n\nBut turn21 y=7 means at turn20 we were at y=6 or y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf at turn20 y=6, t=4 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nSo the earliest to be at y=8 is turn21, but to be at y=8 at turn21, we need at turn20 to be at y=7,8,9.\n\nBut at turn20, if y=7, dangerous; y=8 dangerous; y=9 safe, but we are not at y=9 yet.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before turn21.\n\nAt turn21, y=8 is possible if at turn20 we were at y=7,8, or from y=9 down, but not.\n\nFrom turn20, if we are at y=7, we can go to y=8 at turn21.\n\nBut at turn20 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at turn20, dangerous.\n\nSo only way is to be at y=7 after turn20, but at turn20 we must be on a safe row.\n\nFor example, at turn20 we are at y=4, safe, then we go to y=5 at turn21, etc., as before.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in fewer total turns by going down first or something, but unlikely.\n\nFor example, at turn16, go down to y=3.\n\na16: D, turn17 y=3, t=1 safe (row3 safe at t=1)\n\nThen at turn17, y=3, t=1.\n\nRow3 dangerous at t=2,3, so at turn18, if on y=3, t=2 dangerous, so we must move.\n\na17: U to y=4 or D to y=2 or S.\n\nIf a17=U, turn18 y=4, t=2 dangerous.\n\nIf a17=D, turn18 y=2, t=2, row2 dangerous at t=2.\n\nIf a17=S, turn18 y=3, t=2 dangerous.\n\nAll dangerous at turn18.\n\nSo from y=3 at turn17, no safe action for turn18, because all options lead to dangerous rows at t=2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go to row3 at turn17, because it forces us to be on row2,3, or4 at turn18 t=2, all dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to row2 or1, same issue with t=2,3.\n\nSo better to stay above.\n\nThus, the only viable is the first sequence with delay.\n\nBut in that sequence, we reach at turn25, with 9 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can save some turns after turn20.\n\nAfter turn20, y=4, t=4.\n\nWe go up each turn.\n\nBut at some points, we might move faster, but no, one step per turn.\n\nNotice that rows 5,6,7 are only dangerous at t=0 and t=4, which are past, so for t>4, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly row8 safe except t=4.\n\nSo from turn21 onwards, all rows safe for up movement.\n\nSo the path from y=4 to y=9 takes 5 moves: to y5 at21, y6 at22, y7 at23, y8 at24, y9 at25.\n\nBut we can start from a higher position.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn19, we are at y=5.\n\nInstead of going down to y=4 at turn20, can we go to a different row?\n\nBut no, only y=4 or y=5 or y=6, but y=5 and y=6 dangerous at t=4.\n\nSo must go down to y=4.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut at turn19 y=5, if we could go to y=9 directly, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=8 at turn19, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that at t=1,2,3, row5 is safe, so we can stay on row5 from turn17 to turn19.\n\nThen at turn19, go down to row4 at turn20.\n\nThen from turn20, go up.\n\nBut to go from y=4 to y=9, min 5 turns, so from turn20 to turn25.\n\nTotal from turn16 to turn25.\n\nBut let's count the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn16 y=4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn16+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn16: S (action, to stay for next turn)\n\nAfter action a16, position at turn17.\n\na16=S, turn17 y=4\n\na17=U, turn18 y=5\n\na18=S, turn19 y=5\n\na19=D, turn20 y=4\n\nNow at turn20 y=4\n\na20=U, turn21 y=5\n\na21=U, turn22 y=6\n\na22=U, turn23 y=7\n\na23=U, turn24 y=8\n\na24=U, turn25 y=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn25, after 9 actions (from a16 to a24).\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, but the position is after H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn16 to turn24, 9 actions, to reach at turn25.\n\nBut minimal without cars is 5 actions: a16=U to y5 at17, a17=U to y6 at18, a18=U to y7 at19, a19=U to y8 at20, a20=U to y9 at21. But at turn20 y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo we added 4 extra actions: one stay at16, one stay at18, one down at19, and then the up from20 to24 are necessary but delayed.\n\nIn the direct path, we would have a20=U to y9 at21, but we couldn't because of collision at20.\n\nIn our safe path, we have a down move and extra stays.\n\nBut we might reduce.\n\nNotice that after turn20, we are at y=4, but we could have been at a higher row if we didn't go down.\n\nFor example, at turn19, instead of being at y=5, be at y=6 or something.\n\nBut at turn19, if we are at y=6, we cannot escape the danger at turn20.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at turn20, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps at turn16, we go up to y=5 at turn17.\n\nThen stay at y=5 for turn18 and turn19.\n\nThen at turn19, go down to y=4 at turn20.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at turn18, we go to y=6, then at turn19 y=6, then we have to go down to y=5 or something, but at turn20 y=5 dangerous.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think the sequence above is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go to row 8 at turn21.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn21, need at turn20 to be at y=7,8,9.\n\nAt turn20, y=9 safe, but not there; y=7 dangerous; y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo only possible if at turn20 we are at y=7 or 8, but both dangerous, so impossible to be at y=8 at turn21 without being on dangerous row at turn20.\n\nSimilarly, at turn22, y=8 possible if at turn21 y=7,8,9.\n\nAt turn21, y=7: t=5 safe, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at turn22, we need to be at y=7 at turn21 or earlier.\n\nAt turn21 y=7, from turn20 y=6 or7.\n\nAt turn20, if y=6, dangerous.\n\nIf y=7, dangerous.\n\nSo still, we need to be on a safe row at turn20, then from there go to y=7 at turn21 or later.\n\nFor example, at turn20 y=4, then turn21 y=5, turn22 y=6, turn23 y=7, turn24 y=8, turn25 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt turn20 y=4, go up to y=5 at21, etc.\n\nNo faster way.\n\nPerhaps start by going down to y=3 at some point, but it might not help and could take more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn16, go down to y=3 at turn17.\n\nThen at turn17, we must move to avoid turn18 danger.\n\nBut to where? If to y=4, at turn18 t=2 dangerous.\n\nIf to y=2, dangerous.\n\nSo no, better not to go down.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 9 actions to reach at turn25.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nThen at turn 25, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 25.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn24, to reach at turn25.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions from turn t_1=16 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=16, actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=9, actions at turns 16 to 24.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose at turn16, we go up immediately: a16=U, turn17 y=5\n\nThen a17=S, turn18 y=5\n\na18=S, turn19 y=5\n\na19=D, turn20 y=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\na16=U, turn17 y=5\n\na17=S, turn18 y=5\n\nThen at turn18, instead of staying, go up: a18=U, turn19 y=6\n\nBut then at turn19 y=6, for turn20, no safe action, as before.\n\nSo we must be at y=5 at turn19 to go down.\n\nThus, minimal actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at turn24 or earlier, but from above, seems not.\n\nAnother thought: at turn20, we are at y=4, but if we could be at y=5 earlier, but with the down move, we lose progress.\n\nFor example, if at turn19 we are at y=5, and we go down to y=4 at turn20, then we are back to y=4, so we wasted the up moves.\n\nBut we have to avoid the danger.\n\nPerhaps stay on row 7 or 8 before, but we can't because of the timing.\n\nI think it's necessary.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 16: S  (action at turn16, stay)\n\nTurn 17: U  (up)\n\nTurn 18: S  (stay)\n\nTurn 19: D  (down)\n\nTurn 20: U  (up)\n\nTurn 21: U  (up)\n\nTurn 22: U  (up)\n\nTurn 23: U  (up)\n\nTurn 24: U  (up)\n\nThen at turn 25, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, it's from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 16 to 24.\n\nNow, write in the boxed format.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt turn 16: y=4, t=0, safe.\n\nAfter S, turn 17: y=4, t=1, row 4 safe (dangerous only t=2,3)\n\nThen U, turn 18: y=5, t=2, row 5 safe (dangerous only t=0,4)\n\nThen S, turn 19: y=5, t=3, row 5 safe.\n\nThen D, turn 20: y=4, t=4, row 4 safe (dangerous t=2,3, not 4)\n\nThen U, turn 21: y=5, t=5, row 5 safe (t=5 not 0 or 4)\n\nU, turn 22: y=6, t=6 safe\n\nU, turn 23: y=7, t=7 safe\n\nU, turn 24: y=8, t=8 safe (row 8 dangerous only t=4)\n\nU, turn 25: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nAnd we reached in 9 turns from start, but at turn 16 we are at start, after 0 actions? The position is given at turn 16 before action, I think.\n\nThe initial position is at turn 16, and we choose actions starting from turn 16.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn 16 + H.\n\nHere H=9, reach at turn 25.\n\nMinimal possible is 5, but not achievable due to cars.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce H by not staying at some points.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, instead of staying, go up immediately.\n\na16=U, turn17 y=5 t=1 safe.\n\nThen a17=S, turn18 y=5 t=2 safe.\n\na18=S, turn19 y=5 t=3 safe.\n\na19=D, turn20 y=4 t=4 safe.\n\nSame as before, but we saved one action? In this case, we didn't stay at turn16.\n\nSequence: a16=U, turn17 y=5\n\na17=S, turn18 y=5\n\na18=S, turn19 y=5\n\na19=D, turn20 y=4\n\nThen a20=U, turn21 y=5\n\na21=U, turn22 y=6\n\na22=U, turn23 y=7\n\na23=U, turn24 y=8\n\na24=U, turn25 y=9\n\nSame number of actions, 9, reach at turn25.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had a16=S, which is extra.\n\nWith a16=U, we start moving up earlier but stay twice at y=5.\n\nStill 9 actions.\n\nBut in this sequence, from turn17 to turn19, we are at y=5 for three turns, but we need to go down at turn19 to avoid danger.\n\nThen up.\n\nSame H.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=6 earlier.\n\nBut at turn19, if at y=6, we have to go down or something, but then we might be lower.\n\nFor example, a16=U, turn17 y=5\n\na17=U, turn18 y=6\n\nThen at turn18 y=6 t=2 safe.\n\nNow, we can stay: a18=S, turn19 y=6 t=3 safe.\n\nBut then at turn19, for turn20, no safe action.\n\nIf a18=D, turn19 y=5 t=3 safe.\n\nThen same as before, at turn19 y=5, then a19=D to y=4 at turn20.\n\nThen same path.\n\nSo no saving.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions.\n\nWith a16=U:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nThen at turn 25, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: S \\\\ Turn 18: S \\\\ Turn 19: D \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U \\\\ Turn 22: U \\\\ Turn 23: U \\\\ Turn 24: U }\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe player reaches at turn 16 + H = 16 + 9 = 25? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"? Let's see.\n\nTypically, at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1 +1, new position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, i.e., turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, action a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and position at t_1 + H is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, actions at turns 16 to 24 (9 actions), position at turn 25 is (0,9).\n\nt_1 + H = 16 + 9 = 25.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, with U at 16, S at 17, S at 18, D at 19, U at 20, U at 21, U at 22, U at 23, U at 24.\n\nIn the car states, for row 8, there is a car dangerous at t=4, but in our path, we are on row 8 at t=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\), while avoiding collisions with cars, is 9. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid dangerous rows at critical times, specifically around \\(t = 4\\) (turn 20) when rows 5, 6, 7, and 8 are dangerous.\n\n- At turn 16, moving up to row 5 is dangerous because row 5 is dangerous at \\(t = 0\\) (turn 16). Therefore, the player stays at row 4, which is safe at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\).\n- At turn 17, moving up to row 5 is safe because row 5 is safe at \\(t = 1\\) (turn 17).\n- At turns 18 and 19, staying at row 5 is safe because row 5 is safe at \\(t = 2\\) and \\(t = 3\\) (turns 18 and 19).\n- At turn 19, moving down to row 4 is necessary to avoid being on rows 5, 6, or 7 at \\(t = 4\\) (turn 20), as those rows are dangerous. Row 4 is safe at \\(t = 4\\).\n- From turn 20 onwards, all rows are safe for upward movement since the critical time \\(t = 4\\) has passed. The player moves up consecutively to reach row 9 by turn 25.\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turn 16: At row 4, safe at \\(t = 0\\).\n- Turn 17: At row 4, safe at \\(t = 1\\).\n- Turn 18: At row 5, safe at \\(t = 2\\).\n- Turn 19: At row 5, safe at \\(t = 3\\).\n- Turn 20: At row 4, safe at \\(t = 4\\).\n- Turn 21: At row 5, safe at \\(t = 5\\).\n- Turn 22: At row 6, safe at \\(t = 6\\).\n- Turn 23: At row 7, safe at \\(t = 7\\).\n- Turn 24: At row 8, safe at \\(t = 8\\).\n- Turn 25: At row 9, safe.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,5) at turn t1 = 18. I need to get to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, and y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones, but the problem says to avoid collisions on freeways y=1 to 8, so probably y=0 and y=9 are where there are no cars, or at least, collisions only matter on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8, y=9 should be safe. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=5.\n\nNow, the player moves each turn with actions U (up, +1 in y), D (down, -1 in y), or S (stay, 0 change). y must stay within [0,9], so we can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn t1=18. The car positions are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, head is the front, and for right-moving, head is also the front? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Since it's moving left, decreasing x, so head decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? It says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nThe notation is a bit messy. Let me interpret.\n\nFor a car, at time t, it occupies a range of x-coordinates. The \"head\" is the leading part, and \"tail\" is the trailing part, depending on direction.\n\n- For left-moving (d=left), head is at the left end? No.\n\nTypically, head is the front of the car. So if moving left, front is smaller x, so head has smaller x, tail has larger x.\n\nIn the description:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but which is larger? It says [h, τ] for left-moving, and then it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so since it's moving left, the whole span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nNow, in this notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] might imply h ≤ τ or something? But in the example, for freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nIt says (head, tail, direction, speed). For this, head=-39, tail=-50, direction=right.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span should be [tail, head] with tail < head since moving right.\n\nHere head=-39, tail=-50, so tail=-50 < head=-39, so if direction right, span should be [tail, head] = [-50, -39] I think.\n\nLet's see the car update.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at t1 is given as (head, tail, d, s), but in the update, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, and τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for direction, it says \"left-moving\" or \"right-moving\".\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so it should be right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 should be [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-50, -39]? But tail=-50, head=-39, so τ=-50, h=-39, so [τ, h] = [-50, -39].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-50 + 3(T-18), -39 + 3(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nImportant: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that freeway until the next turn? Let's read.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThe collision check is at the time of the turn.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T). They choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the collision is checked based on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe key point: at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. If for that freeway, at time T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway, then collision.\n\nIf you move to a different y at turn T, meaning that at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} after the action.\n\nSo, during turn T, you are at y_T, and you might be collided if 0 is in a car span on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAfter action, you go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the new freeway, collision is checked at turn T+1, etc.\n\nAlso, note that y=0 and y=9 might not have cars, so probably safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nWe need min H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to after a_{t1+H-1}, we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAnd at each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, when we are at y_T, we must not collide, meaning for freeway y_T, at time T, 0 not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nAt turn t1+H, when we reach y=9, since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), no collision check, or it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, at start, y=5, we are on freeway 5 at time t1=18, so we need to check if at time 18, on freeway 5, is 0 in any car span.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars at t1=18 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (head, tail, d, s) = (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nSince direction right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-50, -39]\n\nAt time T, span: [ -50 + 3(T-18), -39 + 3(T-18) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so -50 + 3(ΔT) ≤ 0 ≤ -39 + 3(ΔT) for ΔT = T-18\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nSpan at t1: [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\n[τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 6(ΔT), 0 + 6(ΔT) ] = [ -11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ [ -11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\nSince the car is at position involving 0 at t1, let's see.\n\nAt t1, ΔT=0, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? 0 is the upper end.\n\n[ -11, 0 ] includes 0, since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nThe span is [a,b], and 0 in [a,b] if a≤0≤b.\n\nAt t1, for freeway 2, span [-11,0], so 0 ≤ 0 is true, so 0 is in the span, so at time t1=18, on freeway 2, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (0, -11, right, 6), so at t1, span [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (0, -11, right, 6), span [-11,0] at t1.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (24,13, right,12) and (-24,-35, right,12)\n\nFirst car: (head=24, tail=13, d=right, s=12)\n\nSince right, span [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12(ΔT), 24 + 12(ΔT)]\n\nSecond car: (head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, s=12)\n\nSpan [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in first span or second span on freeway 5.\n\nAt t1, first span [13,24], 0 not in, min x=13>0.\n\nSecond span [-35,-24], max x=-24<0, so 0 not in either, so at t1, freeway 5 is safe at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, two cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), so same as above, at t1, 0 not covered.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), safe at t1.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst: head=48, tail=37, d=right, s=12, span [37,48] at t1, at T: [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT]\n\nSecond: head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, s=12, span [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT]\n\nAt t1, both spans away from 0, so safe.\n\nNow, player starts at (0,5) at turn t1=18.\n\nFreeway 5: at time 18, we just saw 0 not in any car span, so no collision at start.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is 4 steps up from y=5, but we might need to avoid cars on intermediate freeways.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so once we reach, no issue.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 or something and move up.\n\nThe actions change y, so to go from 5 to 9, min actions would be 4 Ups, but we might collide on some freeways.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, but going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut we might need to wait if a freeway is occupied.\n\nNow, the critical part is that freeways 2,3,4 have cars covering x=0 at t1=18.\n\nFor freeway 2: at t1=18, span [-11,0], so 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly for 3 and 4.\n\nNow, these cars are moving right with speed 6.\n\nSo for freeway 2, car span at time T: [ -11 + 6(ΔT), 6(ΔT) ] where ΔT = T - 18\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ [ -11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\nWhich means -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so ΔT ≤ 1 since ΔT integer? T is turn, so discrete.\n\nΔT = T - 18, integer.\n\n-11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/6 = 1.833, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ 1\n\n0 ≤ 6ΔT always true for ΔT ≥ 0, since ΔT=0,1,2,...\n\nAt ΔT=0, 0 ≤ 0 true.\n\nSo 0 ∈ [ -11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT ] when -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0, which is ΔT ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ 6ΔT always for ΔT≥0.\n\nFor ΔT=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, and 0≤0, yes.\n\nΔT=1: -11+6= -5 ≤0, 0≤6, yes.\n\nΔT=2: -11+12=1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false, and 0 ≤12 true, but 1 ≤0 false, so -11+12=1, which is >0, so 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, for larger ΔT, min x increases.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision at x=0 when ΔT ≤1, i.e., T=18 or 19.\n\nAt T=18, ΔT=0, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=19, ΔT=1, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nT=20, ΔT=2, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], min x=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3: same car, same thing, collision at T=18,19.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=18,19.\n\nNow for other freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: car (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nSpan at T: [ -50 + 3ΔT, -39 + 3ΔT ]\n\n0 in this if -50 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -39 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst, -50 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 3ΔT ≤ 50 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 50/3 ≈16.666, so ΔT ≤16\n\n0 ≤ -39 + 3ΔT ⇒ 39 ≤ 3ΔT ⇒ ΔT ≥ 13\n\nSo for ΔT from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nΔT=13: -50+39= -11 ≤0, 0 ≤ -39+39=0, yes 0∈[-11,0]\n\nΔT=14: -50+42= -8 ≤0, 0 ≤ -39+42=3, yes\n\nΔT=15: -50+45= -5 ≤0, 0 ≤ -39+45=6, yes\n\nΔT=16: -50+48= -2 ≤0, 0 ≤ -39+48=9, yes\n\nΔT=17: -50+51=1 ≤0? false, and 0 ≤ -39+51=12, but 1>0, not include 0.\n\nSo freeway 1 has collision at x=0 when T=18+13=31 to 18+16=34.\n\nBut we start from T=18, and we want to go up quickly, so probably not relevant if we can go fast.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car span: [13 +12ΔT, 24+12ΔT], min x=13+12ΔT >0 for ΔT≥0, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -35+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24+12ΔT\n\n-35+12ΔT ≤0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤35 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 35/12≈2.916, so ΔT≤2\n\n0 ≤ -24+12ΔT ⇒ 24 ≤12ΔT ⇒ ΔT ≥ 2\n\nSo only when ΔT=2: -35+24= -11 ≤0, 0 ≤ -24+24=0, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=20, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nΔT=1: -35+12= -23 ≤0, but 0 ≤ -24+12= -12? 0 ≤ -12 false, so no.\n\nΔT=3: -35+36=1 ≤0 false, etc.\n\nSo freeway 5 has collision only at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars, so same as freeway 5, collision only at T=20.\n\nFreeway 7: same, collision only at T=20.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT], min 37+12ΔT >0, never cover 0.\n\nSecond car: same as before, [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT], collision only at T=20, as above.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at T=18.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible paths: we can go directly up: U,U,U,U to go to y=6,7,8,9 in 4 turns.\n\nBut we need to check for each position if there is collision.\n\nAt each turn, when we are at a certain y, we check if at that time, on that freeway, x=0 is covered.\n\nStart T=18, y=5: freeway 5, at T=18, as above, no collision, since not covered.\n\nNow, we choose action a_{18}.\n\nSuppose we go U: then at T=19, we are at y=6.\n\nAt T=19, on freeway 6: we need to check if collision at T=19.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars, and collision only at T=20, as above.\n\nAt T=19, ΔT=1, for freeway 6 second car: span [-35+12(1), -24+12(1)] = [-23, -12], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nFirst car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36]>0, not.\n\nSo at T=19, freeway 6 safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nNow, we can go U again to y=7 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, on freeway 7? y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=20, freeway 7: collision at T=20, as we saw earlier for freeway 5,6,7 at T=20.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 5 and 6, collision at T=20.\n\nSpecifically, for freeway 7, at T=20, the second car span is [-35+12(2), -24+12(2)] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so includes 0, so collision if on freeway 7 at T=20.\n\nBut at T=20, if we are moving to y=7, we are at y=7 at turn T=20, so we are on freeway 7 at time 20, and collision occurs.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go U from y=6 to y=7 at turn 19 (action at T=19), then at T=20 we arrive at y=7, and collision.\n\nWe could stay or go down, but that might not help.\n\nAnother action at T=19.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSince freeway 7 is dangerous at T=20, we should not be on freeway 7 at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at T=20: at T=20, freeway 6, second car span [-11,0], so also collision.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=20: same, collision.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=20: freeway 4 has the car (0,-11,right,6), at T=20, ΔT=2, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], min x=1>0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 at T=20: same as 4, [1,12], safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=20: [1,12], safe.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=20: ΔT=2, span [-50+6, -39+6]= [-44,-33], not include 0.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=20: second car span [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11,0]? For freeway 8, it has the same second car (-24,-35,right,12), so at T=20, span [-11,0], includes 0, so if on freeway 8 at T=20, collision.\n\nBut freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\nT=18: y=5, safe (freeway 5, T=18 safe)\n\nAction U: to y=6 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=6, freeway 6, T=19: as above, safe, since at T=19, span [-23,-12] for second car, not cover 0.\n\nAction U: to y=7 at T=20\n\nBut at T=20, y=7, freeway 7, which has collision at T=20.\n\nSo we collide.\n\nIf at T=19, instead of U, we do something else.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nWe could stay at y=5 or go down to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince freeways 2,3,4 are safe after T=19, and freeway 1 always safe except later, but we can go through lower freeways.\n\ny=5 is safe at T=18, but at T=19, if we stay, y=5 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, freeway 5: ΔT=1, second car span [-35+12, -24+12]= [-23,-12], not cover 0. First car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not. So safe.\n\nAt T=20, freeway 5 has collision, as we saw.\n\nSo if we stay at y=5 at T=19, then at T=20 we are still at y=5, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo down to y=4 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=19: car (0,-11,right,6), ΔT=1, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], which includes 0, so collision at T=19 on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=4 at T=19, we arrive at y=4 at turn T=19, so on freeway 4 at time 19, and span [-5,6] includes 0, collision.\n\nGo to y=3 or lower, but freeway 2 and 3 also have collision at T=19.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=19: span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nFreeway 3 same.\n\nSo at T=19, freeways 2,3,4 all have collision at x=0.\n\nOnly freeways 1,5,6,7,8 might be safe, but:\n\nFreeway 1 at T=19: ΔT=1, span [-50+3, -39+3]= [-47,-36], not 0.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=19: as above, safe.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=19: safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=19: similar to 5,6, at T=19, ΔT=1, second car [-35+12, -24+12]= [-23,-12], not cover 0, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=19: second car [-35+12, -24+12]= [-23,-12], not cover 0; first car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], not, so safe.\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4 are dangerous at T=19.\n\nNow at T=20, freeways 2,3,4 are safe, as [1,12] etc.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 have collision at T=20 except possibly some.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=20 collision, etc.\n\nTo avoid collision, we need to be on a freeway that is safe at that time.\n\nPlayer at T=18, y=5, safe.\n\nWe need to choose actions.\n\nOne way: at T=18, instead of going up, we go down to a lower freeway that is safe at T=19.\n\nBut at T=19, freeways 2,3,4 are all unsafe, as they cover x=0.\n\nFreeways 1,5,6,7,8 are safe at T=19.\n\nBut y=5 is one of them.\n\nIf we go down to y=4, it is unsafe at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,2 unsafe.\n\ny=1 might be safe at T=19.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=19: safe, as above.\n\nBut to go to y=1 from y=5, we need to go down multiple steps, which might take time and we need to avoid collision during.\n\nSince we start at y=5, to go to y=1, we need to go down 4 times, but at each step, we might have issues.\n\nAt T=18, y=5, safe.\n\nIf we go D: to y=4 at T=19.\n\nBut at T=19, on freeway 4, which has span [-5,6] includes 0, collision.\n\nIf we go S: stay at y=5 at T=19, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at T=19, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we need to choose action for T=20.\n\nAt T=20, if we are at y=5, collision, as freeway 5 unsafe at T=20.\n\nSo we must move away from y=5 at T=19 action.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=19, we can go U to y=6 or D to y=4 or S.\n\nIf go U to y=6 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, on freeway 6, which has collision (span [-11,0]).\n\nSimilarly, if go to y=4 at T=20.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=20: car span [ -11 +12, 12] = [1,12] for freeway 4, which is safe, since min x=1>0.\n\nFreeway 4 car: at T=20, ΔT=2, span [ -11 + 6*2, 0 + 12? Wait no.\n\nFreeway 4 car: (0,-11,right,6), so span at T: [ -11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT ]\n\nAt T=20, ΔT=2, [ -11 + 12, 12 ] = [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 2 at T=20 are safe.\n\nBut freeway 5,6,7,8 at T=20 have collision except freeway 8? Freeway 8 has two cars, but the second car causes collision at T=20.\n\nFreeway 8 second car span at T=20: [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSo y=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=20.\n\ny=4,3,2,1 safe at T=20.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nAt T=18, we can stay at y=5: action S.\n\nThen at T=19, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we need to move to avoid T=20 on y=5.\n\nWe can go down to y=4 at T=20.\n\nAction D at T=19.\n\nThen at T=20, we are at y=4, freeway 4, which at T=20 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=5, but y=5 at T=21? Let's see times.\n\nT=20, y=4, safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=5 at T=21.\n\nAt T=21, freeway 5: need to check.\n\nΔT = T-18 = 21-18=3\n\nFreeway 5 second car: span [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], min x=1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nFirst car [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], not.\n\nSo at T=21, freeway 5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=20, we can go directly up.\n\ny=4 to y=9, need 5 Ups.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nFirst, min H to reach y=9 from y=5 is 4, but with obstacles, it might take more.\n\nSince we have to avoid T=20 for y=5-8.\n\nAnother idea: at T=18, go up to y=6.\n\nAt T=18, action U, to y=6 at T=19.\n\nT=19, y=6, freeway 6, safe as earlier.\n\nThen at T=19, instead of going to y=7 at T=20, we can stay or go down.\n\nIf stay at y=6, at T=20, freeway 6 has collision, so bad.\n\nGo down to y=5 at T=20, but y=5 at T=20 collision.\n\nGo down to y=4 at T=20? From y=6 at T=19, action D, to y=5? No, action at T=19 determines y_{20}.\n\nFrom y=6, action D: y_{20} = y_{19} -1 = 5? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn T, action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} set.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, and check for that freeway at time T.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt T=18, y=5, safe.\n\nAction U: a_{18} = U, so y_{19} = 6\n\nAt T=19, we are at y=6, freeway 6, at time 19, safe.\n\nNow at T=19, we choose a_{19}.\n\nIf we choose U: y_{20} = 7, then at T=20, we are on y=7, which has collision, bad.\n\nIf we choose S: y_{20} = 6, then at T=20, on y=6, collision, bad.\n\nIf we choose D: y_{20} = 5, then at T=20, on y=5, collision, also bad.\n\nSo all actions at T=19 lead to collision at T=20 if we are on y=6 at T=19.\n\nBecause y=5,6,7 all unsafe at T=20.\n\ny=4 is safe at T=20, but from y=6, we can go directly to y=4? No, we can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nActions U,D,S change y by +1,-1,0, so from y=6, we can only go to y=5,6,7.\n\nAll of which are unsafe at T=20.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=6 at T=19, we are forced to be on one of y=5,6,7 at T=20, all of which have collision.\n\nThus, we must not be at y=6 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, if we start by going up to y=6 at T=19, we get stuck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down at start.\n\nAt T=18, if we go D to y=4 at T=19.\n\nBut at T=19, on y=4, freeway 4, which at T=19 has span [-5,6] includes 0, collision.\n\nSo we collide at T=19.\n\nIf we go to y=3 or lower, same issue, freeways 2,3,4 all unsafe at T=19.\n\nOnly going to y=1 or staying at y=5 or going to y=6,7,8.\n\ny=7 or 8 at T=19.\n\nFor example, at T=18, go U to y=6? But we saw that leads to problem.\n\nAt T=18, go U to y=6 at T=19: then as above, stuck at T=20.\n\nAt T=18, go U twice? But we can only do one action per turn.\n\nAt T=18, action U, to y=6 at T=19.\n\nThen at T=19, we have to choose, but all choices bad.\n\nPerhaps at T=18, we stay: action S, so y_{19} =5.\n\nAt T=19, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we need to go to a safe y for T=20.\n\ny=4 is safe at T=20, as freeway 4 at T=20 safe.\n\nSo at T=19, from y=5, action D, to y=4 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20, on y=4, freeway 4, at time 20, span [1,12], safe.\n\nNow, from there, we can go up.\n\nAt T=20, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, 5 steps up.\n\nBut we need to check the freeways on the way.\n\nFirst, freeways 5,6,7,8 have issues at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=20, y=4 is safe.\n\nNow, go U to y=5 at T=21.\n\nAt T=21, freeway 5: as earlier, ΔT=3, second car span [1,12], min x=1>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=6 at T=22.\n\nAt T=22, freeway 6: ΔT=4, second car span [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], min x=13>0, safe. First car [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at T=22: same, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=22: second car [13,24]? Freeway 8 second car same, at ΔT=4, [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], safe. First car [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], safe.\n\nAlso, freeways 1-4 are all safe for later times, since cars moving away.\n\nFreeway 1 has collision only at T=31-34, which is later, we can be past by then.\n\nNow, from y=4 at T=20, we can go up directly: U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 in 5 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nStart: T=18, y=5\n\nAction: S (stay), so y_{19} =5? Action at T=18: S, then y_{19} = y_{18} + 0 =5\n\nAt T=19, position y=5\n\nThen action at T=19: D, so y_{20} =5 + (-1) =4\n\nAt T=20, position y=4\n\nThen action at T=20: U, y_{21} =4 +1 =5\n\nAt T=21, position y=5\n\nAction at T=21: U, y_{22} =6\n\nAt T=22, y=6\n\nAction at T=22: U, y_{23} =7\n\nAt T=23, y=7\n\nAction at T=23: U, y_{24} =8\n\nAt T=24, y=8\n\nAction at T=24: U, y_{25} =9\n\nAt T=25, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn from T=18 to T=24, when we are at y_T, no collision.\n\nT=18: y=5, freeway 5, T=18, safe as before.\n\nT=19: y=5, freeway 5, T=19: ΔT=1, span second car [-23,-12], not 0, safe.\n\nT=20: y=4, freeway 4, T=20: ΔT=2, span [1,12], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=21: y=5, freeway 5, T=21: ΔT=3, span second car [1,12], not include 0 (since min=1>0), safe.\n\nT=22: y=6, freeway 6, T=22: ΔT=4, second car [13,24], not 0, safe.\n\nT=23: y=7, freeway 7, T=23: ΔT=5, second car [-35+60, -24+60]= [25,36], not 0, safe.\n\nT=24: y=8, freeway 8, T=24: ΔT=6, second car [-35+72, -24+72]= [37,48], not 0; first car for freeway 8 is (48,37,right,12), span at T: [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT], at ΔT=6, [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], not, so safe.\n\nThen at T=25, y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere, from T=18 to T=25, we have positions at T=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nActions at T=18,19,20,21,22,23,24: 7 actions.\n\nSequence: action at T=18: S, to y=5 at T=19? Let's list actions and resulting positions.\n\nTurn | Action | Position after action (at next turn)\n\nBetter to list the turn when position is set.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe start at T=18, y=18=5.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=18.\n\nAfter 0 actions: at T=18, y=5\n\nAfter 1 action: at T=19, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions: at T=18+H, y=9.\n\nWe need min H such that we reach y=9 at T=18+H.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=25, y=9, so T=18 + H =25, so H=7.\n\nActions from T=18 to T=24, 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nFor example, can we reach faster?\n\nSuppose at T=18, we go down immediately to a lower y that is safe at T=19, but all lower y=1,2,3,4 are unsafe at T=19 except y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=19: safe, as span [-47,-36], not 0.\n\nBut to go to y=1 from y=5, we need to go down 4 times.\n\nAt T=18, y=5, safe.\n\nIf we go D: to y=4 at T=19, but on y=4 at T=19, collision.\n\nIf we go to y=3, same.\n\nBut to reach y=1, we need multiple downs.\n\nFor example, at T=18, action D, to y=4 at T=19: but at T=19, on y=4, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=18, stay or up, but we saw up to y=6 causes issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 or something.\n\nAt T=18, action U, to y=6 at T=19: safe.\n\nBut then at T=19, we need to handle T=20.\n\nSince y=8 at T=20 might be unsafe, but if we can be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nAnother idea: at T=18, go U to y=6 at T=19.\n\nThen at T=19, instead of moving vertically, we can stay or move, but we have to.\n\nBut as before, all moves lead to y=5,6,7 at T=20, all unsafe.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no.\n\nPerhaps go to y=7 at T=19.\n\nAt T=18, action U, to y=6? Only one step.\n\nTo reach y=7 from y=5, need two ups.\n\nAt T=18, action U, to y=6 at T=19.\n\nThen at T=19, action U, to y=7 at T=20.\n\nBut at T=20, on y=7, collision.\n\nIf at T=19, we do something else, but we end up at y=5,6,7 at T=20.\n\nNo way to avoid.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be on a safe freeway at T=20, which are y=1,2,3,4.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at T=20, for example.\n\nFrom start, at T=18, y=5.\n\nIf we go down to y=4 at T=19, but at T=19, on y=4, collision.\n\nCannot reach y=4 at T=19 without being on y=4 at T=19.\n\nUnless we are already at y=4 at T=18, but we start at y=5.\n\nPerhaps at T=18, we stay, then at T=19, we are at y=5, then go down to y=4 at T=20.\n\nAs in the first sequence.\n\nThat seems necessary.\n\nThen from y=4 at T=20, we go up.\n\nBut we can go up faster, but the freeways above are safe after T=20.\n\nFor example, at T=21, y=5 is safe, etc.\n\nBut to minimize H, we need to go up as fast as possible.\n\nIn the sequence, from y=4 at T=20, we did U to y=5 at T=21, U to y=6 at T=22, etc., up to y=9 at T=25.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, min 5 ups, so at least 5 actions after T=20, so position at T=25.\n\nSince we have to reach y=4 at T=20 with some actions.\n\nIn this case, from start to T=20, we used two actions: S at T=18 and D at T=19, to be at y=4 at T=20.\n\nThen from there, 5 ups to y=9 at T=25.\n\nTotal actions: 7, H=7.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on a higher y at T=20.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=20.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, but to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 and go up.\n\nBut at T=20, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at T=19, if we are at y=8.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=18, to y=8 at T=19, need +3, but we can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible in one step.\n\nIn two steps: at T=18, action U to y=6 at T=19.\n\nThen at T=19, action U to y=7 at T=20, but at T=20 collision on y=7.\n\nAction at T=19 to y=8: from y=6, U to y=7, but not directly to y=8.\n\ny_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, Δy_T = +1 for U, so from y=6, U to y=7.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nSo to reach y=8, min from y=5 is three steps: e.g., U,U,U at T=18,19,20 to y=6,7,8 at T=19,20,21.\n\nBut at T=20, if on y=7 or y=8, collision if at that time.\n\nSpecifically, if we do:\n\nT=18: U, to y=6 at T=19 (safe)\n\nT=19: U, to y=7 at T=20 (but on y=7 at T=20, collision)\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=19, we don't go up, but go down or stay, but then we are not progressing.\n\nSo seems we cannot reach y=8 or higher before T=21 without hitting T=20.\n\nAt T=21, we can be on y=5, for example, safe.\n\nThen go up from there.\n\nBut y=5 to y=9, 4 ups, to T=25 same as before.\n\nLet's see if we can start going up later but faster.\n\nFor example, at T=18, stay: y=5 at T=19\n\nT=19, down: y=4 at T=20\n\nThen from T=20, y=4, we can go up multiple steps, but each up takes one turn.\n\nFastest is to go U each turn.\n\nAt T=20, y=4, action U: y=5 at T=21\n\nT=21, y=5, action U: y=6 at T=22\n\nT=22, y=6, action U: y=7 at T=23\n\nT=23, y=7, action U: y=8 at T=24\n\nT=24, y=8, action U: y=9 at T=25\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=20, y=4, if we could go up faster, no.\n\nAnother point: since freeways 2,3,4 are safe after T=19, and we are on y=4 at T=20, which is safe.\n\nBut we could go through y=3 or 2, but that might not be faster.\n\nFor example, at T=20, y=4, instead of going up, but we need to go up.\n\ny=4 to y=9 must go through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in fewer steps by being on a different path.\n\nBut all paths require at least 4 net up moves, but with detour, we have extra moves.\n\nIn this case, we have two extra moves: S at T=18 and D at T=19, which are not progress, but necessary to avoid.\n\nIs there a way with only one extra move?\n\nFor example, suppose at T=18, we go up to y=6 at T=19, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we need to be not on y=5,6,7 at T=20.\n\nBut we have to be on one of them.\n\nUnless we can be on y=8 at T=20, but from y=6 at T=19, we can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=20.\n\ny=8 not reachable.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 not reachable from y=6 in one step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must be on a safe y at T=20, which are y=1,2,3,4, and since we are coming from y=5, y=4 is the easiest.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at T=20, we need to be at y=4 or y=5 or y=3 at T=19, but:\n\n- If at y=4 at T=19, collision\n\n- If at y=5 at T=19, we can go down to y=4 at T=20\n\n- If at y=3 at T=19, collision on freeway 3\n\nSo only possible is to be at y=5 at T=19, then go down to y=4 at T=20.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=19, from start, at T=18, we can stay (S) or go up or down, but:\n\n- If go U to y=6 at T=19, then not y=5\n\n- If go D to y=4 at T=19, collision\n\n- If go S, y=5 at T=19, perfect.\n\nSo only by staying at T=18, we are at y=5 at T=19, safe, then go down to y=4 at T=20, safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nThus, the sequence is necessary.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t1=18: action S (stay)\n\nThen position at t1+1=19: y=5\n\nAt turn 19: action D (down)\n\nPosition at 20: y=4\n\nAt turn 20: action U (up)\n\nPosition at 21: y=5\n\nAt turn 21: action U\n\nPosition at 22: y=6\n\nAt turn 22: action U\n\nPosition at 23: y=7\n\nAt turn 23: action U\n\nPosition at 24: y=8\n\nAt turn 24: action U\n\nPosition at 25: y=9\n\nReached at turn 25.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=7, so actions at t=18 to 24.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at T=18,19,20,21,22,23,24.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut in the collision, we assumed the spans, but let's double-check freeway 5 at T=21.\n\nT=21, ΔT=3, freeway 5 second car: [-35 + 12*3, -24 + 12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 1 to 12, x=0 not included since 1>0, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=24: ΔT=6, second car [-35+72, -24+72]= [37,48], not 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Suppose we go to y=9 directly but avoiding the bad times.\n\nFor example, at T=20, if we could be on y=9, but from y=5, min 4 ups, to T=22 at earliest.\n\nBut at T=20, we are at y=4 or something.\n\nAt T=20, y=4.\n\nTo reach y=9 by T=22, need to go up 5 steps in 2 turns? Impossible, max +1 per turn.\n\nFrom T=20 y=4, to y=9 at T=25, as before.\n\nIf we go to a higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=19, if we are at y=7.\n\nBut from y=5 at T=18, to y=7 at T=19: impossible, need two actions, but at T=18 action U to y=6 at T=19, then at T=19 we can go to y=7 at T=20, but T=20 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTherefore, min H is 7.\n\nBut let's see if we can save a turn by going through a different freeway.\n\nFor example, after T=20, go directly to y=9, but still 5 ups.\n\nPerhaps at some point go up faster, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=9 is safe, and we can be on y=8 at T=24, then U to y=9 at T=25.\n\nBut if we could be on y=8 earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=21, we are at y=5, as before.\n\nInstead of going step by step, but we have to.\n\nPerhaps from y=4 at T=20, we go up to y=5 at T=21, then to y=6 at T=22, etc.\n\nBut we can go to y=6 from y=5 at T=21 with U, but at T=22 y=6.\n\nNo faster.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some levels, but no, must change by 1.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the actions: we need to list them.\n\nAlso, in the car states, freeway 5 has two cars, but we considered both.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, output format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: S\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}\n\nIn the sequence, after action at T=24 U, position at T=25 y=9.\n\nH=7, from t=0 to H-1=6, but t starts from 0.\n\nIn the action sequence: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=18, t from 0 to 6, so a_{18} to a_{24}.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the turns clearly.\n\nIn the format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 25, position (0,9).\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the position at each turn to verify collisions.\n\nTurn T | y_T | Freeway | Time T | Collision?\n\nT=18: y=5, freeway 5, T=18\n\nCar spans: first [13,24], second [-35,-24], both not contain 0, safe.\n\nT=19: y=5, freeway 5, T=19, ΔT=1\n\nFirst car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not 0\n\nSecond car [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], not 0, safe.\n\nT=20: y=4, freeway 4, T=20, ΔT=2\n\nCar: (0,-11,right,6), span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], not contain 0, safe.\n\nT=21: y=5, freeway 5, T=21, ΔT=3\n\nSecond car [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], not 0 (1>0), safe.\n\nFirst car [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], not.\n\nT=22: y=6, freeway 6, T=22, ΔT=4\n\nCars: similar to freeway 5, second car [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nFirst car [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], not.

Positions: T=20,21,22,23,24.\n\nAfter action at T=20, position at T=21, etc.\n\nAt T=20, we are at y=4.\n\nAction at T=20: U, to y=5 at T=21\n\nT=21: y=5, action U to y=6 at T=22\n\nT=22: y=6, action U to y=7 at T=23\n\nT=23: y=7, action U to y=8 at T=24\n\nBut we need y=9 at T=24, but here at T=24 y=8, not 9.\n\nThen action at T=24 U to y=9 at T=25.\n\nBut we want at T=24 y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=24, we need to be at y=8 at T=23 and action U at T=23.\n\nIn the above, at T=23 we are at y=7, so to y=8 at T=24.\n\nNot y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=20, to y=9 at T=24, we need to increase y by 5 in 4 steps: from T=20 to T=24, 4 actions, but 4 actions can increase by at most 4 (if all U), to y=8 at T=24.\n\nThen at T=24, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=24, we need to be at y=8 at T=23 and U at T=23.\n\nBut with 4 actions from T=20 to T=23, we can go to y=4 +4 =8 at T=24? Let's see:\n\nStart at T=20: y=4\n\nAfter action a_{20}: y_{21} = y_{20} + Δy\n\nAfter a_{20}: at T=21, y\n\nAfter a_{21}: at T=22, y\n\nAfter a_{22}: at T=23, y\n\nAfter a_{23}: at T=24, y\n\nTo have y at T=24 be 9, we need after 4 actions from T=20, but actions at T=20,21,22,23 determine y_{21}, y_{22}, y_{23}, y_{24}.\n\ny_{24} = y_{20} + sum of Δy from t=20 to 23.\n\ny_{20} =4, so y_{24} = 4 + (Δy_{20} + Δy_{21} + Δy_{22} + Δy_{23})\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so max y_{24} = 4 + 4*1 =8, min =0.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at T=24 from y=4 at T=20 with 4 actions; max y=8.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach before T=25.\n\nThus, minimal H is 7.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by avoiding dangerous freeways at critical times, specifically the collision at \\(x = 0\\) on freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 at turn 20 (\\(T = 20\\)).\n\n- At turn 18, staying at \\(y = 5\\) is safe because freeway 5 at \\(T = 18\\) has no car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 19, moving down to \\(y = 4\\) is safe because the player is still on freeway 5 at \\(T = 19\\), which is safe, and avoids being on freeways 5, 6, 7, or 8 at \\(T = 20\\).\n- At turn 20, moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe because freeway 4 at \\(T = 20\\) has no car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- From turns 21 to 24, moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 25, with all intermediate freeways safe at the respective times.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 18: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 5\\), avoiding immediate movement to a dangerous freeway.\n- Turn 19: Down (D) to move to \\(y = 4\\), positioning to avoid the collision at \\(T = 20\\) on higher freeways.\n- Turn 20: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 5\\), as freeway 4 is safe at \\(T = 20\\) and freeway 5 is now safe at \\(T = 21\\).\n- Turn 21: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 6\\), with freeway 5 safe at \\(T = 21\\).\n- Turn 22: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 7\\), with freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 22\\).\n- Turn 23: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 8\\), with freeway 7 safe at \\(T = 23\\).\n- Turn 24: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 9\\), with freeway 8 safe at \\(T = 24\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 25 (\\(t_1 + H = 18 + 7\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: S \\\\\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 19, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player moves in the y-direction only (x=0 always). The actions are U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y unchanged).\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nImportant note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T at turn T and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T and only moves to y_{T+1} at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=19. For future turns T (>=19), we can compute the car's span at turn T using:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (19) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n\nIf left-moving (d = left): \n   Span at T = [h - s*(T-19), tau - s*(T-19)]\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nThe direction is given as \"right\" for all cars. So:\n\nFor right-moving (d = right): \n   Span at T = [tau + s*(T-19), h + s*(T-19)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail) and then direction. However, in the update rule for right-moving, the span at T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But wait, the initial representation for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail) and then the update rule uses [tau, h] as the initial span? Actually, the table says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front (so at the right) and the tail is at the left? Then the initial span is [tail, head]? Actually, the update rule says:\n\nFor right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] (so tau is the leftmost and h the rightmost). Then at time T, the car moves right, so the new span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, tau] and then [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut all cars in the problem are right-moving. So we only use the right-moving update.\n\nNow, collision condition at turn T: if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at turn T, and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T. But note: each freeway may have multiple cars. So we must check all cars on the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nThe goal: we start at y=5 at turn 19. We need to get to y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So the minimal number of turns in the absence of cars would be 4 (from 5 to 9: U, U, U, U). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 19 to turn 19+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 19+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's moves and check for collisions on the freeways at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars on each freeway at turn 19:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-36, -47, right, 3) -> so tau = -47, h = -36, s=3, right-moving.\n   Span at T: [ -47 + 3*(T-19), -36 + 3*(T-19) ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (6, -5, right, 6) -> tau=-5, h=6, s=6\n   Span at T: [ -5 + 6*(T-19), 6 + 6*(T-19) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (6, -5, right, 6) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2: (6, -5, right, 6) -> same.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: \n   car1: (36,25,right,12) -> wait, head=36, tail=25? But for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? Actually, 36>25, so tail=25, head=36? But the update rule uses [tau, h] and then moves right. So the initial span is [25,36] at t1=19? Then at T: [25+12*(T-19), 36+12*(T-19)]\n   car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> tail=-23, head=-12 -> span at T: [-23+12*(T-19), -12+12*(T-19)]\n\nFreeway 6: same two cars as freeway5? \n   (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12) -> same as freeway5.\n\nFreeway 7: same two cars as freeway5.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \n   car1: (60,49,right,12) -> tail=49, head=60 -> span at T: [49+12*(T-19), 60+12*(T-19)]\n   car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> same as above: [-23+12*(T-19), -12+12*(T-19)]\n\nNow, note that the player is only on a freeway when y is between 1 and 8. When at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars to collide with.\n\nWe start at turn 19 at y=5. We must avoid being at a freeway when a car's span covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as quickly as possible (with U actions) and see if we can do it in 4 turns. But we must check for collisions at each turn.\n\nPlan: \n  Turn 19: at y=5 (freeway5) -> check if at turn19, on freeway5, is there a car that covers 0?\n  Then we choose an action for turn19: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up if safe.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for turns: \n   t=19: a_19 -> leads to y20 = y19 + Delta (from a_19)\n   then at turn20, we are at y20, and then we choose a_20, etc.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting at T=19) the position y_T and whether we are on a freeway (i.e., y_T in {1,2,...,8}) and then check if any car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nLet me check freeway5 at turn19:\n\nFreeway5 has two cars:\n   car1: [25+12*(0), 36+12*(0)] = [25,36] -> does not include 0.\n   car2: [-23+12*0, -12+12*0] = [-23,-12] -> does not include 0.\n\nSo at turn19, at y=5, safe.\n\nNow, if we choose U at turn19, then at turn20 we will be at y=6.\n\nBut note: at turn19, we are at y=5, and we are safe. Then we move to y=6 at the beginning of turn20? Actually, the update is: at the end of the turn, the player moves? The rule says: at turn T, we choose an action, and then the next state is for turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn19, we are at (0,5). We choose an action a_19. Then the next position is for turn20: y20 = y19 + Delta(a_19).\n\nTherefore, at turn19, we are at y=5 and we are safe (as we just checked). Then we choose an action for turn19.\n\nNow, if we choose U at turn19, then at turn20 we will be at y=6.\n\nWe then need to check at turn20: we are at y=6 (freeway6). We then check freeway6 at turn20.\n\nFreeway6 at turn20 (which is T=20, so T-19=1):\n   car1: [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48] -> does not include 0.\n   car2: [-23+12*1, -12+12*1] = [-11,0] -> note: -11 to 0. Does 0 lie in [-11,0]? Yes, because the span is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". The span is an interval, and we assume inclusive. So 0 is in [-11,0]? Actually, the car2 at freeway6 at turn20: [-11,0] includes 0? Yes, because 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=6 at turn20, we collide with car2 on freeway6.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn19? Because then at turn20 we are at y=6 and we collide.\n\nAlternative: at turn19, we do S (stay at 5) or D (down to 4). But we want to go up, so maybe we wait one turn.\n\nBut note: we are trying to minimize the number of turns. So we must check if we can avoid collision by waiting.\n\nWhat if at turn19 we do S? Then at turn20 we are still at y=5 (freeway5). Then we check freeway5 at turn20:\n\n   car1: [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48] -> safe.\n   car2: [-23+12*1, -12+12*1] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes, 0 is in the interval? But wait, freeway5 at turn20: we are at y=5, so we check freeway5. The car2 on freeway5 at turn20: [-11,0] -> does this include 0? Yes. So if we stay at y=5 at turn20, we collide? \n\nWait, at turn19 we did S, so at turn20 we are still at y=5? But the collision condition is at turn20: we are at y=5 and freeway5 has a car that covers 0? So we would collide.\n\nTherefore, staying at turn19 (S) leads to collision at turn20? Then we cannot do S either.\n\nWhat about D? If we go down to y=4 at turn20? Then at turn20 we are at y=4 (freeway4). Check freeway4 at turn20:\n\nFreeway4 has one car: (6, -5, right, 6) -> at T=20: [ -5 + 6*(1) , 6 + 6*(1) ] = [1,12] -> includes 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe? Actually, 1 to 12 does not include 0. So safe.\n\nBut we are going down, which is away from the goal.\n\nSo we have two options at turn19: \n   U -> leads to collision at turn20 (if we then go to y=6)\n   S -> leads to collision at turn20 (at y=5)\n   D -> leads to y=4 at turn20, which is safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we might have to go down temporarily to avoid the car.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the car at freeway5 and freeway6 at turn20? Actually, at turn19 we are safe at y=5, but at turn20 if we are at y=5 we collide? So we must leave freeway5 by turn20? How? We can only move to y=4,5,6 at turn19.\n\nSo if we do D at turn19, we go to y=4 at turn20 and avoid collision.\n\nThen at turn20 we are at y=4. Now we need to plan from there.\n\nBut what about the car at freeway4 at turn20? We just checked: [1,12] at turn20 -> safe.\n\nNow, at turn20, we are at y=4. We want to go to 9. So we need to go up. But we have to check the cars at turn20 and beyond.\n\nWe are at turn20 (T=20) at y=4. We choose an action for turn20.\n\nIf we choose U at turn20, then at turn21 we go to y=5. Then we must check freeway5 at turn21.\n\nFreeway5 at turn21 (T=21, T-19=2):\n   car1: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60] -> safe (0 not in [49,60])\n   car2: [-23+12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo if we go from y=4 to y=5 at turn20 (by choosing U at turn20), then at turn21 we are at y=5 and it is safe.\n\nThen at turn21 we can choose U again to go to y=6 at turn22.\n\nNow, check freeway6 at turn22 (T=22, T-19=3):\n   car1: [25+12*3, 36+12*3] = [25+36, 36+36] = [61,72] -> safe.\n   car2: [-23+12*3, -12+12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn22, y=6 is safe.\n\nThen we go to y=7 at turn23: so we choose U at turn21 and then U at turn22? Let me write the sequence:\n\nTurn19: D -> to y=4 at turn20.\nTurn20: U -> to y=5 at turn21.\nTurn21: U -> to y=6 at turn22.\nTurn22: U -> to y=7 at turn23.\n\nNow, at turn23 we are at y=7. Then we need to go to y=8 and then y=9. But we must check freeway7 and freeway8.\n\nFirst, at turn23 (T=23, T-19=4), we are at y=7. Check freeway7 at turn23:\n\nFreeway7: two cars (same as freeway5? but at T=4):\n   car1: [25+12*4, 36+12*4] = [25+48, 36+48] = [73,84] -> safe.\n   car2: [-23+12*4, -12+12*4] = [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=8 at turn24: choose U at turn23.\n\nAt turn24: we are at y=8 (freeway8). Check freeway8 at turn24 (T=24, T-19=5):\n\nFreeway8: \n   car1: (60,49,right,12) -> at T=5: [49+12*5, 60+12*5] = [49+60,60+60] = [109,120] -> safe.\n   car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> at T=5: [-23+12*5, -12+12*5] = [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo safe. Then we choose U at turn24 to go to y=9 at turn25.\n\nAt turn25, we are at y=9, which is the goal. There are no cars at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn19: D\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\n\nThat's 6 actions (from turn19 to turn24) and at turn24 we have moved to y=9? Actually, the actions are taken at turns 19,20,21,22,23,24 and then at turn25 we are at y=9? \n\nWait, let's clarify the timeline:\n\n- At turn19: we start at y=5. We choose a_19 = D -> then at the end of turn19, we move to y=4? But the update rule says: at turn t, we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo:\n  Turn19: position (0,5) -> choose a_19=D -> then at turn20, we are at (0,4).\n  Turn20: at (0,4) -> choose a_20=U -> then at turn21, we are at (0,5).\n  Turn21: at (0,5) -> choose a_21=U -> then at turn22, we are at (0,6).\n  Turn22: at (0,6) -> choose a_22=U -> then at turn23, we are at (0,7).\n  Turn23: at (0,7) -> choose a_23=U -> then at turn24, we are at (0,8).\n  Turn24: at (0,8) -> choose a_24=U -> then at turn25, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn25. Therefore, we have taken 6 actions (from turn19 to turn24) and H=6? But note that the last action is at turn24 and then at turn25 we are at the goal. The problem says: we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWe are at turn19: so we do actions at t=19,20,...,19+H-1. Then the position at turn19+H is the result of the last action? But the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nNote: the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position at the end of the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut in our sequence:\n\nWe take actions at turns: 19,20,21,22,23,24 (so H=6 actions) and then at turn24 (which is t1+5? because t1=19, so 19+5=24) we are at y_{24}? \n\nWait, the position after the action at turn24 is y_{25}. But we want y_{t} at turn t to be 9? Actually, the state is given at the beginning of the turn. So:\n\nAt the beginning of turn19: y19=5.\nAfter action at turn19: y20 = y19 + Delta(a19) -> so y20 is the state at the beginning of turn20.\n\nWe want at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1) to be 9? Or after the action? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the next state (which is the beginning of turn t1+H) we would be at y_{t1+H}. However, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThe action a_{t1} is taken at turn t1, and then the next state is y_{t1+1}. So after taking action at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1}. Then after taking action at turn t1+1, we get y_{t1+2}, ... until after taking action at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nSo to have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, we need T = t1+H-1? \n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,5). Then we take actions for H turns? The problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions? Then the state after the last action would be at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nThis implies that we do not take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H-1 actions? But the indexing is from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nLet me check the notation: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> so t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ... t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}. So we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H}. But we want y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThis seems inconsistent. Unless the state we are considering is the state at the same turn we take the action? But the update rule says the action at turn t updates the state to turn t+1.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis suggests that after taking the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2, we would be at y_{t1+H-1}=9? But the problem says the sequence goes to t=H-1, meaning the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H}? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the entire process takes H turns (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) and we are at 9 at the beginning of the last turn? But that doesn't make sense because we take an action at the last turn.\n\nLooking at the answer format: it lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action. And then we are at the goal after that last action? \n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? Then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nI think the problem means that we take actions for H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at 9? But then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9, not y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the player is at the position at the end of the turn? But the update rule defines y_{t+1} as the next state.\n\nI see the confusion. The problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nNote: the player starts at turn t1. Then we take H actions: at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}. But we want that state to be 9? \n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nPerhaps the indexing is such that at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=5. Then we take an action at turn t1, which moves us to y_{t1+1} at the start of turn t1+1. Then we take an action at turn t1+1, and so on until we take an action at turn t1+H-1, which moves us to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H? Then we would write y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nAlternatively, if we take H actions, then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is not the result of that action? \n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me look again at the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is taken from t=0 to t=H-1, meaning the actions are at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" H includes the starting turn? But that would be odd.\n\nI see the example in the car update: \"at turn T > t1\", so we are starting at t1 and then we consider T>=t1.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we do not need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H-1 actions? But the indexing is from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nLet me assume that the problem means that we take H actions and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9. But then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nAnother possibility: the state y_t is defined at the end of turn t? But the update rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, which suggests y_t is the state at the beginning.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we take actions for H turns (meaning H actions) and then we are at the goal at the next state. But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nTo resolve, let's look at the minimal H. In our planned sequence, we start at turn19 (y=5) and then after 6 actions we are at turn25 (y=9). So we have taken actions at turns19,20,21,22,23,24 (6 actions) and then at the beginning of turn25 we are at y=9. \n\nSo we want y_{25}=9. Now, what is the turn index for the goal? It is turn25 = t1+6. So H should be 6? And then we want y_{t1+H}=9? But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIf H=6, then t1+H-1 = 19+6-1=24. So we want y_{24}=9. But in our sequence, at the beginning of turn24, we are at y=8 (because we took an action at turn23 that moved us to y=8 at turn24). Then at turn24 we take an action U and then at turn25 we are at y=9. So y_{24} is 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust: we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn24? How can we do that? \n\nWe must get to y=9 by the beginning of turn24. That means we need to have taken an action at turn23 that gets us to y=9 at turn24.\n\nBut we start at y=5 at turn19. The minimal steps to go from 5 to 9 is 4. So we need 4 actions. But then we would be at turn19+4 = turn23 at y=9? \n\nLet me see:\n\nAt turn19: we start at y=5.\nAction at turn19: U -> then at turn20: y=6.\nAction at turn20: U -> then at turn21: y=7.\nAction at turn21: U -> then at turn22: y=8.\nAction at turn22: U -> then at turn23: y=9.\n\nSo then at the beginning of turn23, we are at y=9. And we have taken 4 actions: at turns19,20,21,22. Then H=4? And then we want y_{t1+H-1}=y_{19+4-1}=y_{22}? But at the beginning of turn22, we are at y=8? \n\nAfter the action at turn22, we are at turn23: y=9. So at the beginning of turn23, we are at y=9. Therefore, we want y_{23}=9. Now, t1+H-1 = 19+4-1 = 22? But 22 is not 23.\n\nIf we take 4 actions, then the last action is at turn22 (t1+3) and then we are at y_{23}. So we want y_{23}=9. Therefore, we need t1+H-1 to be 23? So 19+H-1=23 -> H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\nBut then the sequence has 5 actions? But we only took 4 actions.\n\nAlternatively, if we take 5 actions, then the last action is at turn23 (t1+4) and then we are at y_{24}. But we want y_{23}=9, so we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn23 without taking an action at turn23? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nI think the problem means that we take H actions and then we are at the goal at the state immediately after the last action, which is at turn t1+H. And then they want to call that turn t1+H-1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" in H counts the number of turns from the start, including the starting turn? But the player is already at the start at turn19, and we are to move. And the actions are taken in turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nAnother possibility: the minimal number of turns H means the number of turns that pass, not the number of actions. For example, from turn19 to turn23 is 4 turns of time passing? But then we have taken actions at turns19,20,21,22 (4 actions) and then at turn23 we are at y=9. And the number of turns that have passed is 4 (from turn19 to turn23 is 4 steps? 19->20,20->21,21->22,22->23: 4 steps). \n\nBut the problem says \"the minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So if H=4, then actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3 (which is turns19,20,21,22) and then at the next turn (turn23) we are at the goal. And then the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would be y_{19+4-1}=y_{22}=9? But we are at y=9 at turn23, not turn22.\n\nUnless the problem means that after the last action (at turn22) we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn23, but that is not y_{22} but y_{23}. \n\nI think there might be a standard interpretation in such problems: the state after the action at turn t is for turn t+1. And the goal is to be at the goal state at the beginning of a turn. The problem then should say we want y_{t1+H}=9, and then the number of actions is H, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nGiven the confusion, let me try to look for clarification in the problem. It says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our initial safe sequence, we are at y=9 at turn25. So we want turn25 = t1+H-1 = 19+H-1. So 19+H-1=25 -> H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nThen the sequence would have H=7 actions? But we only took 6 actions. Or if we took 6 actions, then H should be 6, but then 19+6-1=24, not 25.\n\nIn our safe sequence, we are at y=9 at turn25. So to have that be turn t1+H-1, we need 19+H-1=25 -> H=7.\n\nBut then we would need to take 7 actions? But we only took 6.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might count the turns differently.\n\nPerhaps we do not need to take an action after reaching the goal? But the problem requires a sequence of actions until we reach.\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", and in our safe sequence we are at 9 at turn25, then we set H such that t1+H-1=25 -> 19+H-1=25 -> H=7.\n\nBut then the sequence has 7 actions? But we only took 6 actions. So we would need to pad with an action at turn24 that doesn't move us? But we are at y=8 at turn24, and then we take U to go to 9 at turn25. So that is one action. Then the last action is at turn24, and we are at 9 at turn25. So the action at turn24 is included, and then we are at 9 at turn25. Therefore, the state at the beginning of turn24 is y=8, and then we take U and become y=9 at the beginning of turn25. So we want to be at 9 at turn25 = t1+H-1. So 19+H-1=25 -> H=7.\n\nThen the sequence has actions from turn19 to turn25-1? wait, from t1 to t1+H-1 = 19 to 19+7-1=25? turn25 is not included because the actions are at turns 19,20,21,22,23,24,25? but then that is 7 actions.\n\nBut in our safe sequence, we have actions at 19,20,21,22,23,24 -> 6 actions. And then at turn25 we are at 9. So to have 7 actions, we would need to do one extra action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that at turn25 we are at 9 and we don't need to take an action, then the last action is at turn24. Then the number of actions is 6. Then we want turn25 = t1+H-1 -> 19+H-1=25 -> H=7. But then the sequence should have actions from turn19 to turn19+6=25? which is 7 actions, but we only have 6.\n\n I think the only logical conclusion is that the problem meant to say that after taking the actions, we are at the goal at turn t1+H. Then we would set H=6, and then the sequence has 6 actions.\n\n But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nGiven the provided car state and the collision constraints, let's try to achieve y=9 at an earlier turn if possible.\n\nCan we reach y=9 by turn24? That would require 5 actions: from 5 to 9 in 4 steps, but we might have to wait.\n\nBut earlier, if we try to go up immediately, we collide at turn20 if we go to y=6.\n\nWe tried going down at turn19 to avoid, and then we got to y=9 at turn25.\n\nCan we do it in 5 actions, reaching at turn24?\n\nWe start at turn19: y=5.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn24? or at the beginning of turn24 after actions? We want y_{24}=9.\n\nTo have y_{24}=9, we must have taken an action at turn23 that moved us to 9, so we must have been at 8 at turn23.\n\nSo we need to be at 8 at turn23 (beginning of turn23).\n\nThe minimal path: 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9, but that takes 4 actions: turn19:U, turn20:U, turn21:U, turn22:U, then at turn23 we are at 9? No: \n action at turn19: U -> turn20:6\n action at turn20: U -> turn21:7\n action at turn21: U -> turn22:8\n action at turn22: U -> turn23:9\n\n So at the beginning of turn23, we are at 8, and then after action at turn22 we are at 9 at turn23? No, action at turn22 moves us from 8 to 9 at turn23.\n\n So at the beginning of turn23, we are at 8, and then at the beginning of turn24, we are at 9.\n\n Therefore, to have y_{24}=9, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn24, which requires actions at turns19,20,21,22,23 (5 actions) and then at turn24 we are at 9.\n\n But the problem wants y_{t1+H-1}=9, which for turn24 would be if H= then 19+H-1=24 -> H=6.\n\n and then the actions are for 6 turns: turns19 to 24, but then we would take an action at turn24? and then at turn25 we would be at 10 or something, which is not desired.\n\n Given the confusion, and since the problem might have a typo, and because in many such problems the goal is to be at the state after the last action, I will assume that we want y_{t1+H} = 9, and then the number of actions is H, and the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n In our safe sequence, we have H=6 actions and y_{25}=9.\n\n Then for the answer, we output the 6 actions.\n\n But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", so if we output H=6, then they will check if at turn19+6-1=24 we are at 9, but we are at 8.\n\n Alternatively, if we output the sequence for 5 actions (H=5) and claim we are at 9 at turn23 ( which is 19+5-1=23), then in our safe sequence we are at 9 at turn25, not turn23.\n\n So we need a faster sequence.\n\n Is it possible to reach by turn23 (i.e., in 4 actions: turn19 to turn22, and then at turn23 we are at 9)? But we start at 5, so we need to go up 4 times.\n\n But earlier, if we try to go up at turn19, we have a collision at turn20 (when we go to y=6).\n\n How about we go up at turn19? Let me check freeway5 at turn19: safe, as we saw.\n Then at turn20, if we go to y=6, we collide because freeway6 at turn20 has a car at [-11,0] (car2) which includes 0.\n\n So we cannot be at y=6 at turn20.\n\n What if we go up at turn19 to y=6 at turn20, but then we are safe at freeway6? no, because the car is there.\n\n unless the car does not cover 0 at turn20? but we calculated: car2 on freeway6 at turn20: [-23+12*(20-19), -12+12*1] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\n How about if we wait at turn19 by doing S? then at turn20 we are at y=5, but freeway5 at turn20: car2 has [-11,0] -> includes 0, so collide.\n\n or if we go down at turn19 to y=4 at turn20: safe, as we saw for freeway4.\n\n then at turn20, we are at y=4. Can we then go up twice quickly? \n\n turn20: U -> to y=5 at turn21.\n turn21: U -> to y=6 at turn22.\n turn22: U -> to y=7 at turn23.\n turn23: U -> to y=8 at turn24.\n turn24: U -> to y=9 at turn25.\n\n This is 6 actions.\n\n Is there a way to do 5 actions and be at 9 at turn24? \n\n We need to be at 9 at turn24, which means at turn23 we must be at 8 or 9? \n\n If we are at 9 at turn23, then we could have done nothing at turn23, but we must take an action.\n\n to be at 9 at turn24, we must be at 8 or 9 at turn23 and then choose U or S.\n\n But if we are at 9 at turn23, we can choose S and stay at 9 at turn24.\n\n So one possibility: \n   turn19: \n   turn20: \n   turn21: \n   turn22: \n   turn23: \n\n and then at turn24 we are at 9.\n\n We need to get from 5 to 9 in 4 steps, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\n Alternatively, get to 9 earlier and then stay.\n\n Let's try to go up as much as possible without collision.\n\n turn19: U -> to 6 at turn20: collides at freeway6 (turn20) -> not safe.\n\n turn19: D -> to 4 at turn20: safe.\n turn20: U -> to 5 at turn21: freeway5 at turn21: car1 [49,60] and car2 [1,12] -> safe (0 not in either).\n turn21: U -> to 6 at turn22: freeway6 at turn22: car1 [61,72], car2 [13,24] -> safe.\n turn22: U -> to 7 at turn23: freeway7 at turn23: car1 [73,84], car2 [25,36] -> safe.\n turn23: U -> to 8 at turn24: freeway8 at turn24: car1 [109,120], car2 [37,48] -> safe.\n\n turn24: we are at 8. We can then choose U to go to 9 at turn25.\n\n But we want to be at 9 at turn24? How? \n\n At turn23 we are at 7. If we could go up twice in one turn? No, only one step per turn.\n\n So the above is the safe sequence we have.\n\n But then at turn24 we are at 8. To be at 9 at turn24, we would have to have been at 8 or 9 at turn23 and then done U or S. \n\n At turn23 we are at 7 (from turn22:U from 6 to 7 at turn23). \n\n Unless we can do two U's in a row earlier.\n\n is there a way to be at 8 by turn23? \n\n from turn19: D to 4 at turn20.\n turn20: U to 5 at turn21.\n turn21: U to 6 at turn22.\n turn22: U to 7 at turn23.\n so at turn23 we are at 7.\n\n to be at 8 at turn23, we would need to have done an extra U somewhere, but we only have from 5 to 8 in 3 steps, and we have only 3 actions: turn20,21,22.\n\n turn20: from 4 to 5.\n turn21: from 5 to 6.\n turn22: from 6 to 7.\n then at turn23 we are at 7.\n\n not 8.\n\n if we do U at turn19: but that is not safe.\n\n or if we do U at turn19 and then something else.\n\n turn19: U -> to 6 at turn20: collide at freeway6.\n\n turn19: S -> to 5 at turn20: collide at freeway5.\n\n turn19: D -> to 4 at turn20: safe.\n\n then turn20: can we do U twice? no, only one action.\n\n or turn20: U to 5 at turn21: safe.\n turn21: we can try to do U to 6 at turn22: safe.\n turn22: U to 7 at turn23: safe.\n\n then at turn23: we are at 7. We can then do U at turn23 to go to 8 at turn24.\n\n still not 9.\n\n to get to 9 by turn24, we would need to be at 6 at turn23? then U to 7 at turn24? not 9.\n\n or to be at 8 at turn23 and then U to 9 at turn24.\n\n to be at 8 at turn23, we need to have moved from 5 to 8 in 4 steps? but we have 4 actions: turn19,20,21,22.\n\n turn19: from 5 to x ( if U: to 6, collide; if D: to 4, safe; if S: to 5, collide)\n then from 4 at turn20: turn20: U to 5 at turn21.\n turn21: U to 6 at turn22.\n turn22: U to 7 at turn23.\n not 8.\n\n if after turn19: D to 4 at turn20.\n turn20: we do U twice? no.\n or turn20: U to 5 at turn21.\n turn21: U to 6 at turn22.\n turn22: U to 7 at turn23.\n then turn23: U to 8 at turn24.\n\n still at 8 at turn24.\n\n So it seems impossible to reach 9 by turn24. The earliest is turn25.\n\n Therefore, we must have a sequence of 6 actions, and we are at 9 at turn25.\n\n then for the problem, if we set H=6, then they want y_{19+6-1}=y_{24}=9? but we are at 8 at turn24 and 9 at turn25.\n\n So to satisfy the problem's condition, we must be at 9 at turn24.\n\n how to achieve that? \n\n We would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn24.\n\n We start at 5 at turn19.\n in 5 steps: \n   turn19: action -> state at turn20\n   turn20: action -> state at turn21\n   turn21: action -> state at turn22\n   turn22: action -> state at turn23\n   turn23: action -> state at turn24\n\n to be at 9 at turn24, we need the action at turn23 to move us to 9, so we must be at 8 or 9 at turn23.\n\n to be at 8 at turn23, we need to have moved from 5 to 8 in 4 actions.\n\n as above, we can try:\n\n turn19: D to 4 at turn20 (safe)\n turn20: U to 5 at turn21 (safe)\n turn21: U to 6 at turn22 (safe)\n turn22: U to 7 at turn23 (safe)\n turn23: U to 8 at turn24. -> then we are at 8 at turn24, not 9.\n\n to be at 9 at turn24, we would need to have been at 9 at turn23 and then choose S, or at 8 and choose U.\n\n so at turn23, we must be at 8 or 9.\n\n to be at 8 at turn23, we need to have moved from 5 to 8 in 4 actions: turns19,20,21,22.\n\n but we can't because of the car at freeway6 at turn20.\n\n unless we take a different path.\n\n What if we go down to 3 or something? but that would take even longer.\n\n or if we go up on a different schedule.\n\n for example, at turn19: S is not safe, U is not safe, D is safe to 4.\n\n then at turn20: we are at 4. Can we go to 5 and then to 6 and to 7 and to 8 by turn23? we have turn20,21,22 to do that.\n\n turn20: from 4 to 5 (U) -> turn21:5\n turn21: from 5 to 6 (U) -> turn22:6\n turn22: from 6 to 7 (U) -> turn23:7\n not 8.\n\n turn20: from 4 to 5 (U)\n turn21: from 5 to 6 (U) -> at turn22:6\n turn22: from 6 to 7 (U) -> turn23:7\n\n then at turn23: from 7 to 8 (U) -> turn24:8\n\n still not 9.\n\n to get to 8 at turn23, we would need to do an extra U somewhere.\n\n at turn20: from 4, can we go to 6? no, only +1 per turn.\n\n so it seems impossible to be at 9 at turn24.\n\n Therefore, the minimal is to arrive at turn25.\n\n then for the problem, since it asks for y_{t1+H-1}=9, and we are at 9 at turn25, we set 19+H-1=25 -> H=7.\n\n then the sequence must have 7 actions: for turns 19 to 25 ( but 25-19=6 actions, so 7 actions would be to turn25 action?).\n\n with H=7, actions at turns: 19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\n but then at turn25 we are at the goal, and we take an action at turn25? which would move us to turn26, which is not desired.\n\n or at turn25 we are at 9, and we can choose S to stay.\n\n so the sequence would be the 6 actions we have plus one S at the end.\n\n turn19: D\n turn20: U\n turn21: U\n turn22: U\n turn23: U\n turn24: U  -> at turn25 we are at 9.\n turn25: S  -> but then at turn26 we are still at 9.\n\n but the problem only requires to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,9) at turn25 and turn26. \n\n then the condition y_{t1+H-1}=9 would be for H=7: turn19+7-1= turn25, and at turn25 we are at 9.\n\n so we need to include an action at turn25.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n turn19: D\n turn20: U\n turn21: U\n turn22: U\n turn23: U\n turn24: U\n turn25: S   ( to stay at 9)\n\n then at the beginning of turn25, we are at 9, and then we do S, and then at turn26 we are still at 9, but the condition is for turn25.\n\n but the problem wants the state at turn25 to be 9, and it is.\n\n However, the action at turn25 is taken, but it doesn't change the state from 9.\n\n and we have taken 7 actions.\n\n But is there a sequence with 7 actions that arrives earlier? no, because we cannot arrive before turn25.\n\n and we are safe throughout? \n\n Let's verify the entire sequence:\n\n turn19: at y=5. choose D -> to y=4 at turn20.\n   Check turn19: at y=5 (freeway5): already safe.\n\n turn20: at y=4. choose U -> to y=5 at turn21.\n   Check turn20: at y=4 (freeway4): car: [ -5+6*(20-19), 6+6*1 ] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n turn21: at y=5. choose U -> to y=6 at turn22.\n   Check turn21: at y=5 (freeway5): car1 [25+12*(21-19)=25+24=49, 36+24=60] -> safe.\n               car2 [-23+12*2=-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> safe.\n\n turn22: at y=6. choose U -> to y=7 at turn23.\n   Check turn22: at y=6 (freeway6): car1 [25+12*3=25+36=61, 36+36=72] -> safe.\n               car2 [-23+12*3=13, -12+36=24] -> safe.\n\n turn23: at y=7. choose U -> to y=8 at turn24.\n   Check turn23: at y=7 (freeway7): car1 [25+12*4=25+48=73, 36+48=84] -> safe.\n               car2 [-23+12*4=25, -12+48=36] -> safe.\n\n turn24: at y=8. choose U -> to y=9 at turn25.\n   Check turn24: at y=8 (freeway8): car1 [49+12*5=49+60=109, 60+60=120] -> safe.\n               car2 [-23+12*5=37, -12+60=48] -> safe.\n\n turn25: at y=9. choose S -> to y=9 at turn26.\n   Check turn25: at y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\n and at the beginning of turn25, we are at 9, so the condition for H=7 is met: y_{19+7-1}=y_{25}=9.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence is:\n\nTurn 19: D\n 20: U\n 21: U\n 22: U\n 23: U\n 24: U\n 25: S\n\n But is there a sequence with H=6? then we would need to be at 9 at turn19+6-1=24.\n\n to be at 9 at turn24, we would have to have been at 8 or 9 at turn23 and then done U or S.\n\n as before, we can be at 8 at turn24 by the sequence without the last U and S? but then we are at 8, not 9.\n\n or if we manage to be at 9 at turn24.\n\n the only way to be at 9 at turn24 is to have done 4 ups in 4 actions, but we can't because of the car at turn20.\n\n or if we do a different sequence that gets to 9 sooner, but the only ways to avoid the car are to go down at turn19.\n\n then we can't make up the lost step.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\n so the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: S\n}\n\n But wait, the problem might allow us to not take an action after reaching, but the problem requires a sequence of actions until the last turn where we are at the goal. \n\n and at turn25, we are at the goal, and we choose to stay to ensure we are safe, but even if we do nothing, the problem might accept any action once at the goal.\n\n But the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and at turn25 we are at y=9, so we are safe.\n\n could we omit the last action? then the sequence would be only 6 actions: up to turn24, and then at turn25 we are at 9, but we haven't taken an action at turn24. wait, we have to take actions from turn19 to turn24 (6 actions) to get to turn25 at 9.\n\n then for the condition: with H=6, we want y_{19+6-1}=y_{24}=9. but at turn24 we are at 8, not 9.\n\n so we must have the action at turn24 (U) to move to 9 at turn25.\n\n then to have y_{24}=9, we would need to be at 9 at turn24, which we are not.\n\n Therefore, we must include the action at turn25 to have the state at turn25 be 9, and then the condition for H=7 is met.\n\n so the answer is as above.\n\n But let me double-check if there is a sequence that achieves y_{24}=9.\n\n to have y_{24}=9, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn24.\n\n to achieve that, we must have been at 8 or 9 at turn23 and then chosen U or S.\n\n to be at 8 at turn23, we need to have moved from 5 to 8 in 4 actions ( turns19,20,21,22 ).\n\n the only ways are to go up 3 times, but we start at 5 and need to go to 8, so three ups: 5->6->7->8.\n\n actions at turn19,20,21: three actions.\n\n then at turn22 we are at 8. then at turn22 we choose S to stay at 8 at turn23? or U to 9 at turn23? \n\n but we want to be at 8 or 9 at turn23, and then at turn23 we choose an action to be at 9 at turn24.\n\n so if at turn22 we are at 8, then at turn23 we choose U to go to 9 at turn24.\n\n so the sequence would be: turn19:U, turn20:U, turn21:U, turn22:S or something, then turn23:U.\n\n but turn19:U: from 5 to 6 at turn20 -> collides at freeway6 at turn20.\n\n turn19:D to 4 at turn20.\n turn20:U to 5 at turn21.\n turn21:U to 6 at turn22.\n turn22:U to 7 at turn23.\n then at turn23 we are at 7, not 8.\n\n turn19:D to 4.\n turn20:U to 5.\n turn21:U to 6.\n turn22:U to 7.\n turn23:U to 8 at turn24. -> then at turn24 we are at 8, not 9.\n\n to get to 8 at turn23, we would need turn19: from 5 to 4.\n turn20: from 4 to 5.\n turn21: from 5 to 6.\n turn22: from 6 to 7.\n and then at turn23 we are at 7.\n\n not 8.\n\n turn19: from 5 to 6 (not safe).\n\n or turn19: S -> collide at turn20.\n\n or turn19: U to 6 ( collide at turn20).\n\n so it is impossible.\n\n Therefore, the only way is the 7-action sequence.\n\n So the answer is the one above.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 19 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7. The sequence of actions ensures the player reaches y=9 at the beginning of turn 25 (i.e., \\(y_{25} = 9\\)), satisfying the condition \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{19 + 7 - 1} = y_{25} = 9\\).\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initial State (Turn 19)**: Player is at y=5.\n- **Action at Turn 19 (D)**: Move down to y=4. This avoids collision at turn 20 on freeway 5 (cars at freeway 5 cover 0 at turn 20, so moving down to freeway 4 is safe).\n- **Action at Turn 20 (U)**: Move up to y=5. Freeway 4 at turn 20 is safe (car span [1, 12] does not include 0).\n- **Action at Turn 21 (U)**: Move up to y=6. Freeway 5 at turn 21 is safe (car spans [49, 60] and [1, 12] do not include 0).\n- **Action at Turn 22 (U)**: Move up to y=7. Freeway 6 at turn 22 is safe (car spans [61, 72] and [13, 24] do not include 0).\n- **Action at Turn 23 (U)**: Move up to y=8. Freeway 7 at turn 23 is safe (car spans [73, 84] and [25, 36] do not include 0).\n- **Action at Turn 24 (U)**: Move up to y=9. Freeway 8 at turn 24 is safe (car spans [109, 120] and [37, 48] do not include 0).\n- **Action at Turn 25 (S)**: Stay at y=9. The goal is reached at the beginning of turn 25, and staying ensures no collision (y=9 has no cars).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 19 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 cars: [25, 36] and [-23, -12] → 0 not in spans → safe.\n- **Turn 20 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 car: [-5 + 6(1), 6 + 6(1)] = [1, 12] → 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 21 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 cars: [25 + 12(2), 36 + 12(2)] = [49, 60] and [-23 + 12(2), -12 + 12(2)] = [1, 12] → 0 not in spans → safe.\n- **Turn 22 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 cars: [25 + 12(3), 36 + 12(3)] = [61, 72] and [-23 + 12(3), -12 + 12(3)] = [13, 24] → 0 not in spans → safe.\n- **Turn 23 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 cars: [25 + 12(4), 36 + 12(4)] = [73, 84] and [-23 + 12(4), -12 + 12(4)] = [25, 36] → 0 not in spans → safe.\n- **Turn 24 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 cars: [49 + 12(5), 60 + 12(5)] = [109, 120] and [-23 + 12(5), -12 + 12(5)] = [37, 48] → 0 not in spans → safe.\n- **Turn 25 (y=9)**: No freeway → safe.\n\n### Answer:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 19 to 25 (7 turns) is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: \\text{S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,4) at turn t1=20 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), or S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t1=20, with head and tail, direction, and speed. The span is the segment it occupies. Cars move left or right at constant speed.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Since the player is at x=0, we care if x=0 is covered by a car on the row y where the player is at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you are on y_T, and you decide to move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T for collision purposes, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so we can be there safely.\n\nStart at (0,4) at t1=20.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 5 units up. But since I can move only one unit per turn, minimum H would be 5 if I go straight up with U actions. But I have to avoid collisions, so I might need to detour or wait.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=20 to t=20+H-1, so in H turns, I can change y by at most H, but since I start at 4 and need to reach 9, delta y=5, so H >=5.\n\nIf I can go straight up without collision, H=5.\n\nBut let's check the cars on the freeways I might cross.\n\nI start at y=4. At turn 20, I'm on y=4, but I need to see if at turn 20, on y=4, there is a car at x=0.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway k, which I think corresponds to y=k.\n\nFreeway k is row y=k.\n\nSo for y=4, at turn 20, what cars are there?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-33,-44, right, 3) — this is y=1\n\nFreeway 2: (12,1, right, 6) — y=2\n\nFreeway 3: (12,1, right, 6) — y=3\n\nFreeway 4: (12,1, right, 6) — y=4\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37, right, 12), (0,-11, right, 12) — two cars on y=5\n\nFreeway 6: (48,37, right, 12), (0,-11, right, 12) — y=6\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37, right, 12), (0,-11, right, 12) — y=7\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59, right, 12), (0,-11, right, 12) — y=8\n\nFor y=4 at turn 20, there is a car: (12,1, right, 6)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's recall the update.\n\nFor right-moving car: at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the rule: right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1, span is [τ, h], so for example, on y=2, at t1=20, car is (12,1, right, 6), so head h=12, tail τ=1? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be the front, so if head is larger, it's moving right? Let's see.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor y=2: (12,1, right, 6), so head=12, tail=1, direction=right.\n\nSince direction=right, and head=12 > tail=1, so at t1, span is [tail, head] = [1,12], I think.\n\nThen at time T, span is [1 + 6*(T-20), 12 + 6*(T-20)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care if 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway y_T.\n\nNow at turn 20, I am at y=4.\n\nOn y=4, car is (12,1, right, 6), so span at T=20: [1 + 6*(0), 12 + 6*(0)] = [1,12], since T-t1=0.\n\nx=0 is not in [1,12], so no collision at t=20 on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nI need to move to y=5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find times when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., no car has x=0 in its span.\n\nSince I move one y per turn if I move vertically, but I can stay or move down, but since I want to go up, moving down might not help, but I might need to wait on a row if it's safe.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are always safe, I can be there.\n\nBut I start at y=4, need to go to y=9.\n\nLet me first find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is not covered by any car on that row.\n\nStart with y=4.\n\nOn y=4, one car: (12,1, right, 6)\n\nSpan at time T: [1 + 6*(T-20), 12 + 6*(T-20)]\n\nx=0 in span if 1 + 6*(T-20) <= 0 <= 12 + 6*(T-20)\n\nSo lower bound L = 1 + 6*(T-20)\n\nUpper bound U = 12 + 6*(T-20)\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <= 0 and 0 <= U\n\nL <= 0: 1 + 6*(T-20) <= 0 => 6*(T-20) <= -1 => T-20 <= -1/6, since T integer, T-20 <= -1, so T <= 19\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= U: 0 <= 12 + 6*(T-20) => 6*(T-20) >= -12 => T-20 >= -2, so T >= 18\n\nNow, L <= 0 and 0 <= U:\n\nFrom L <=0: T <= 19\n\nFrom 0 <= U: T >= 18\n\nSo for T=18,19, x=0 is in span? Let's compute:\n\nT=18: L = 1 + 6*(18-20) = 1 + 6*(-2) = 1 -12 = -11\n\nU = 12 + 6*(-2) = 12 -12 = 0\n\nSo span = [-11, 0], so x=0 is included? U=0, and since it's a closed interval I assume, so 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly, T=19: L=1 +6*(-1)=1-6=-5, U=12-6=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=20: L=1+0=1, U=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=21: L=1+6=7, U=12+6=18, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nT=17: L=1+6*(-3)=1-18=-17, U=12-18=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in since -6<0.\n\nT=22: L=13, U=24, not.\n\nSo for y=4, x=0 is covered only at T=18 and T=19, not at T=20 or later.\n\nSince we are at t=20, for future turns, T>=20, on y=4, it is safe at T=20,21,... because car has moved right.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\ny=5: two cars: (48,37, right, 12) and (0,-11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12\n\nAt t1=20, span: [τ, h] = [37,48] since right-moving? Head=48, tail=37, so if head is front, tail is back, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [37,48]\n\nThen at T, span: [37 + 12*(T-20), 48 + 12*(T-20)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0,-11, right, 12), head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12*(T-20), 0 + 12*(T-20)]\n\nNow, x=0 in span for y=5 if it is in either car's span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [37 +12*(T-20), 48 +12*(T-20)]?\n\nLower bound L1 = 37 +12*(T-20)\n\nUpper bound U1 = 48 +12*(T-20)\n\n0 in [L1,U1] if L1 <=0 and 0<=U1\n\nL1 <=0: 37 +12*(T-20) <=0 => 12*(T-20) <= -37 => T-20 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so T <= 16 since T integer\n\nSimilarly, 0<=U1: 0 <=48 +12*(T-20) => 12*(T-20) >= -48 => T-20 >= -4, T>=16\n\nBut L1 <=0 requires T<=16 and T>=16? T-20 <= floor(-37/12)= floor(-3.083)= -4? Let's calculate properly.\n\nL1 <=0: 37 +12*(T-20) <=0\n\n12*(T-20) <= -37\n\nT-20 <= -37/12 = -3.083, so since integer, T-20 <= -4? No:\n\nInequality: T-20 <= floor(-37/12) but better to solve:\n\n12*(T-20) <= -37\n\nSince 12*3=36<37, 12*4=48>37, so 12*(T-20) <= -37 implies T-20 <= -4 because -36 >= -37? No.\n\n12k <= -37 for k= T-20\n\nk <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so k <= -4 since k integer? k=-3: 12*(-3)= -36 >= -37? -36 > -37, so -36 <= -37? No, -36 > -37, so -36 is greater than -37.\n\n12k <= -37\n\nFor k=-3: 12*(-3)= -36, -36 <= -37? -36 is larger than -37, so -36 > -37, so -36 <= -37 is false.\n\n-36 is not less than or equal to -37; it's greater.\n\nSo 12k <= -37: k must be less than or equal to ceil(-37/12) or floor?\n\n-37/12 = -3 -1/12, so since k integer, 12k <= -37 when k <= -4, because k=-4: 12*(-4)= -48 <= -37 true, k=-3: -36 <= -37 false.\n\nSimilarly, 0<=U1: 0 <= 48 +12k => 12k >= -48 => k >= -4\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span only if L1 <=0 and 0<=U1, so k <= -4 and k >= -4, so only k= -4, T=20 + (-4) =16\n\nAt T=16, L1=37+12*(-4)=37-48=-11, U1=48-48=0, so span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nSimilarly, second car: span at T: [-11 +12*(T-20), 0 +12*(T-20)] = [ -11 +12k, 12k ] where k=T-20\n\n0 in [ -11+12k, 12k ] if -11+12k <=0 and 0<=12k\n\n-11+12k <=0 => 12k <=11 => k <= 11/12 <1, so k<=0\n\n0<=12k always true for k>=0, but k integer.\n\n-11+12k <=0 => 12k <=11 => k <= floor(11/12)=0 since 12*0=0<=11, 12*1=12>11.\n\nk <= 0\n\nAnd 0<=12k: since 12k, for k>=0, 0<=12k true, for k<0, 12k<0, so 0<=12k false if k<0.\n\nSo 0<=12k only if k>=0.\n\nBut from above, -11+12k <=0 only if k<=0.\n\nSo both: k<=0 and k>=0, so k=0.\n\nThus for second car, 0 in span only at k=0, T=20.\n\nAt T=20, span: [-11+0, 0] = [-11,0], so 0 in it.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nSo for y=5, at T=20, second car has span [-11,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst car covers only at T=16, not at T=20.\n\nSo at T=20, on y=5, there is a car with x=0 in span, so if I am on y=5 at T=20, I collide.\n\nBut I am at y=4 at T=20, not on y=5.\n\nNow for future turns, T>20.\n\nOn y=5, cars: first car, 0 in span only at T=16, not later.\n\nSecond car, 0 in span only at T=20, not later.\n\nFor T>20, k>0, second car span: [-11+12k, 12k], for k=1, T=21: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nk=2: [13,24], etc.\n\nSimilarly first car for k>0, L1=37+12k>37>0, U1>48>0, so 0 not in.\n\nThus for y=5, x=0 is covered only at T=16 and T=20? T=16 for first car, T=20 for second car.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nSpecifically, for T>20, always safe, since both cars moved right.\n\nT=20 is unsafe, T=21 and later safe.\n\nNow y=6: similar to y=5, cars: (48,37, right, 12), (0,-11, right, 12)\n\nSame as y=5, so at T=20, second car covers x=0.\n\nFor T>20, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7: same cars, same thing, unsafe at T=20, safe for T>20.\n\nNow y=8: cars: (-48,-59, right, 12), and (0,-11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59, right, 12), head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right.\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Head and tail.\n\nIf head is the front, for right-moving, head should be larger, but here head=-48, tail=-59, since -48 > -59, so yes, moving right, span [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 12*(T-20), -48 + 12*(T-20)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11, right, 12), same as before, span at T: [-11 +12k, 12k] with k=T-20\n\nNow, x=0 in span for y=8.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [-59+12k, -48+12k]?\n\nL = -59+12k, U= -48+12k\n\n0 in [L,U] if L<=0 and 0<=U\n\nL<=0: -59+12k <=0 => 12k <=59 => k <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so k<=4\n\n0<=U: 0<= -48+12k => 12k >=48 => k>=4\n\nSo both: k>=4 and k<=4, so k=4, T=20+4=24\n\nAt T=24, L= -59+12*4= -59+48= -11, U= -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSecond car: same as before, 0 in span only at k=0, T=20.\n\nAt T=20, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor other times, not.\n\nSo on y=8, unsafe at T=20 (from second car) and at T=24 (from first car).\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nNow y=1: car (-33,-44, right, 3)\n\nHead=-33, tail=-44, right, so span at t1: [-44,-33]?

Action: U to go to y=5 at t=21.\n\nAt t=21: on y=5. Now y=5 at t=21: k=1, as above, cars at [49,60] and [1,12], 0 not covered, safe. Then action U to go to y=6 at t=22.\n\nAt t=22: on y=6. Similarly, y=6 cars same, at k=2, [37+24,48+24]=[61,72]? k=T-20=2, T=22.\n\nFirst car: [37+12*2, 48+12*2]=[37+24,48+24]=[61,72]\n\nSecond car: [-11+24, 24]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe. Action U to y=7 at t=23.\n\nt=23: on y=7. k=3, first car [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], second car [-11+36,36]=[25,36], safe. Action U to y=8 at t=24.\n\nt=24: on y=8. Now y=8 at t=24.\n\nEarlier we saw y=8 unsafe at t=24.\n\nAt t=24, k=4.\n\nFirst car: [-59 +12*4, -48+12*4]= [-59+48, -48+48]= [-11, 0], so [ -11, 0], x=0 is included.\n\nSecond car: at t=24, k=4, span [-11+48, 48]= [37,48]? Second car span: [-11 +12k, 12k], k=4, [-11+48, 48]= [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut first car has [ -11,0], so x=0 covered, collision if on y=8 at t=24.\n\nSo at t=24, if I am on y=8, I collide.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=24 I arrive at y=8 by moving U at t=23.\n\nAt t=23 I was on y=7, move U, so at t=24 I am on y=8 and collide.\n\nSo not safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=8 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 is also unsafe at t=20, but t=20 is past.\n\nNow, other unsafe times for y=8: only t=20 and t=24, as we found.\n\nt=20 and t=24 unsafe.\n\nSafe at t=21,22,23,25,etc.\n\nt=21: k=1, first car: [-59+12, -48+12]= [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=22: k=2, first car: [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], second car [-11+24,24]=[13,24], safe.\n\nt=23: k=3, first car: [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12], second car [-11+36,36]=[25,36], safe.\n\nt=24: unsafe as above.\n\nt=25: k=5, first car: [-59+60,-48+60]=[1,12], second car [-11+60,60]=[49,60], both not cover 0, safe.\n\nSo y=8 safe except t=20 and t=24.\n\nIn my path, I arrive at y=8 at t=24, which is bad.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, I could go slower or faster to avoid t=24.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are safe after t=20, I can stay on lower rows for a turn.\n\nI start at t=20, y=4.\n\nI can stay on y=4 for one turn, then go up.\n\nAction S at t=20: stay on y=4.\n\nAt t=21, still on y=4, which is safe, since y=4 safe for t>=20.\n\nThen at t=21, action U to y=5 at t=22.\n\nt=22: on y=5, safe as before.\n\nAction U to y=6 at t=23.\n\nt=23: on y=6, safe.\n\nAction U to y=7 at t=24.\n\nt=24: on y=7. Now y=7 at t=24.\n\ny=7 cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt t=24, k=4, first car [37+48,48+48]=[85,96]? [37+12*4,48+12*4]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96]\n\nSecond car [-11+48,48]=[37,48], both not cover 0, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=8 at t=25.\n\nt=25: on y=8. t=25, k=5, as above, first car [1,12], second car [49,60], both not cover 0, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at t=26.\n\nt=26: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this case, I reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nH = number of turns from t=20 to t=26, but t=26 is the turn when I arrive at y=9.\n\nThe sequence: from t=20 to t=25, actions for t=20 to t=25, 6 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nGiven: at turn t_1=20, position is (0,y_t1) = (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0, y_{t1+1})\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t1 to t= t1 + H - 1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the condition is to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nIn the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1 + 0, t1 + 1, ..., t1 + (H-1)\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H, but we want y at turn t1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe position after the actions.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action at turn τ, we have y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo at start, turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nWe apply action a_{t1}, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{a_{t1}}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, apply a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter applying actions up to a_{t1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + (H-1) + 1}, but we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, we need to arrive at y=9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t from t1 to t1 + H - 1, we have actions, and at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the first approach, if I go straight up:\n\nt=20: at y=4, apply U, then y_{21} = 5\n\nt=21: at y=5, apply U, y_{22}=6\n\nt=22: at y=6, apply U, y_{23}=7\n\nt=23: at y=7, apply U, y_{24}=8\n\nBut at t=24, y=8, which is unsafe, and we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so if I reach y=9 at turn, say, T.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and apply U.\n\nSo if at turn T-1, I am at y=8, apply U, then at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nSo for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t=t1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nSo I need to arrive at y=9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, if I start at t=20, y=4.\n\nAfter 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U at t=20,21,22,23,24, then at t=25, y=9? Let's see:\n\nt=20: apply U, y_{21} =5\n\nt=21: apply U, y_{22}=6\n\nt=22: apply U, y_{23}=7\n\nt=23: apply U, y_{24}=8\n\nt=24: apply U, y_{25}=9\n\nSo at turn t=25, y=9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with t1=20, so y_{20 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 20 + H -1 =25, then 19 + H =25, H=6.\n\nH=6, t1 + H -1 =20+6-1=25, yes.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=24, I was at y=8, which is unsafe at t=24.\n\nCollision at t=24.\n\nIn the second approach I thought: stay at t=20: S, then y_{21}=4 (stay)\n\nt=20 apply S: Δy=0, y_{21}=y_{20}=4\n\nThen t=21 apply U: y_{22}=5\n\nt=22 apply U: y_{23}=6\n\nt=23 apply U: y_{24}=7\n\nt=24 apply U: y_{25}=8\n\nt=25 apply U: y_{26}=9\n\nThen at turn t=26, y=9.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{20 + H -1} =9, so 20 + H -1 =26, 19+H=26, H=7.\n\nBut with H=6, in the direct way, I have collision.\n\nCan I do with H=5? Minimum.\n\nStart y=4, need to reach y=9, delta=5, so at least 5 actions, all U, to go from 4 to 9 in 5 steps: y_{t+1} = y_t +1 for each step.\n\nAfter first U: y=5, after second: y=6, ..., after fifth U: y=9.\n\nSo actions at t=20,21,22,23,24: all U.\n\nThen y_{21}=5, y_{22}=6, y_{23}=7, y_{24}=8, y_{25}=9.\n\nSo at turn t=25, y=9, which is y_{20 + H -1} with H=5? t1 + H -1 =20 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 25: 20 + H -1 =25, H=6.\n\nWith H actions from t=20 to t=20+H-1.\n\nFor H=5, actions at t=20,21,22,23,24.\n\nThen positions: after a_t at t, y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter a_{20}, y_{21}; after a_{21}, y_{22}; ... after a_{24}, y_{25}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{20 + 5 -1} = y_{24} =9.\n\nBut in the sequence, y_{24} is after action at t=23? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position y_t.\n\nApply action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, apply a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} is the position at the start of turn t+1.\n\nFor example, at turn t=20, position y_{20}=4.\n\nApply a_{20}, then y_{21} = y_{20} + Δy_{a20}\n\nThen at turn t=21, position y_{21}, apply a_{21}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at some turn, say T, y_T =9.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = T.\n\nIn the sequence with all U from t=20 to t=24 (5 actions):\n\nApply a_{20}=U: y_{21} = 4+1=5\n\na_{21}=U: y_{22}=6\n\na_{22}=U: y_{23}=7\n\na_{23}=U: y_{24}=8\n\na_{24}=U: y_{25}=9\n\nNow, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=20, so y_{20 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, y_{25}=9, so 20 + H -1 =25, H=6.\n\nBut y_{24}=8, which is not 9.\n\nWith H=5 actions, we have y_{20+5-1}=y_{24}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{24}=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 24.\n\nThat means we must have applied U at turn 23 when at y=8, so that y_{24}=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 23, etc.\n\nWith min H=5, we need to reach y=9 at turn 24? y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{20 + H -1}\n\nSet to 9.\n\nFor H=5, y_{20+5-1}=y_{24}=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn 24.\n\nThat means at turn 23, we must be at y=8 and apply U.\n\nAt turn 22, at y=7 and apply U to y=8 at t=23, and so on.\n\nSo actions: at t=20, from y=4 apply U to y=5 at t=21? Position at turn t.\n\nAt turn 20: y=4, apply U, so y_{21}=5\n\nTurn 21: y=5, apply U, y_{22}=6\n\nTurn 22: y=6, apply U, y_{23}=7\n\nTurn 23: y=7, apply U, y_{24}=8? But we need y_{24}=9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTo have y_{24}=9, at turn 23, y_{23} must be 8, and apply U.\n\nThen at turn 23, y=8, apply U, y_{24}=9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 22, y=7, apply U, y_{23}=8.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo for y_{24}=9:\n\nAt turn 23: y=8, apply U\n\nAt turn 22: y=7, apply U to y=8 at t=23\n\nAt turn 21: y=6, apply U to y=7 at t=22\n\nAt turn 20: y=4, apply U to y=5 at t=21? But at turn 21, y should be 6, but from above y_{21}=5 if start from y=4 at t=20 with U.\n\nStart: turn 20: y=4, apply U, y_{21}=5\n\nThen turn 21: y=5, apply U, y_{22}=6\n\nTurn 22: y=6, apply U, y_{23}=7\n\nTurn 23: y=7, apply U, y_{24}=8\n\ny_{24}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{24}=9, we need y_{23}=8 and apply U at t=23.\n\nBut to have y_{23}=8, we need to be at y=7 at turn 22 and apply U, etc.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=20 to y=8 at t=23 in 3 steps?

But y between 0 and 9.\n\ny_{21} = y_{20} + Δa20, so 3,4,5.\n\nThen y_{22} = y_{21} + Δa21, and so on.\n\nTo have y_{23}=8.\n\ny_{23} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22? Not exactly.\n\ny_{21} = y_{20} + Δa20\n\ny_{22} = y_{21} + Δa21 = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21\n\ny_{23} = y_{22} + Δa22 = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22\n\nSimilarly, y_{24} = y_{23} + Δa23\n\nFor y_{23} = y_{20} + sum_{i=0}^{2} Δa_{20+i}  since from t=20 to t=22 actions affect y_{21} to y_{23}.\n\ny_{23} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22\n\nEach Δa is -1,0,1.\n\ny_{20}=4, so y_{23} = 4 + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22\n\nTo have y_{23}=8, need Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22 =4.\n\nEach <=1, so must all be +1, so Δa20=1, Δa21=1, Δa22=1, so y_{21}=5, y_{22}=6, y_{23}=7? y_{23} =4 +1+1+1=7.\n\ny_{23}=7, not 8.\n\nMaximum y_{23} can be is 7, if all U from t=20 to t=22.\n\ny_{23} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22\n\nWith three Δa, each at most +1, so y_{23} <= 4 + 3*1 =7.\n\nSimilarly, y_{23} >= 4 -3 =1.\n\nSo y_{23} cannot be 8; it can be at most 7.\n\nTherefore, for y_{24} = y_{23} + Δa23 <= 7+1=8.\n\nSo y_{24} <=8 if starting from y=4.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 5 actions: for example, to have y_{25}=9.\n\ny_{25} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22 + Δa23 + Δa24\n\nSet to 9, so sum of five Δa =5, so all must be +1.\n\nThus with H=5 actions at t=20 to 24, all U, y_{25}=9, and y_{24}=8.\n\nBut in this case, at t=24, y=8, which is unsafe at t=24.\n\nWith H=6 actions, we can have y_{25}=9 as above.\n\nBut in the delayed path, with H=7, y_{26}=9.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at t=25, for example.\n\nIn the direct path with H=6, we have collision at t=24.\n\nBut with H=5, we cannot reach y=9 at t=24, only at t=25 or later.\n\nMinimal H to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 must be reached, and from y=4, min 5 steps up, so min H=5 to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=5, t1 + H -1 =20 +5-1=24, so y_{24}=9.\n\nBut as above, y_{24} cannot be 9 from y_{20}=4 in 4 actions? y_{24} = y_{20} + sum_{i=0}^{3} Δa_{20+i} for i=0 to 3? Actions at t=20,21,22,23 affect y_{21} to y_{24}.\n\ny_{21} = y_{20} + Δa20\n\ny_{22} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21\n\ny_{23} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22\n\ny_{24} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22 + Δa23\n\nSet y_{24}=9, y_{20}=4, so Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22 + Δa23 =5.\n\nBut each Δa <=1, so sum <=4, contradiction.\n\nImpossible to have y_{24}=9 with y_{20}=4.\n\ny_{24} <= 4 + 4*1 =8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{25} <=4+5=9, achievable with all U.\n\nSo minimal to have y_{25}=9 with H=5 actions? With H actions, y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δa, but we care about y at turn.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = T, y_T=9.\n\nFrom y_{20}=4, to y_T=9.\n\nThe number of turns from 20 to T is T-20.\n\nAt each turn from 20 to T-1, we apply an action to change y.\n\nThe change in y from start to end is 5, so we need at least 5 up moves, and the number of actions is equal to the number of turns from start to end minus one? Let's think.\n\nAt turn 20, y=4.\n\nAfter K actions (from t=20 to t=20+K-1), we have y_{20+K}.\n\nThen y_{20+K} = y_{20} + sum_{i=0}^{K-1} Δa_{20+i}\n\nWe want y_{20 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet S = 20 + H -1, so y_S =9.\n\nS = 20 + H -1.\n\ny_S = y_{20} + sum_{i=0}^{S-21} Δa_{20+i} ? Better to index.\n\nThe actions applied from turn 20 to turn S-1.\n\nBecause at turn S-1, we apply a_{S-1}, which sets y_S.\n\ny_S depends on actions from t=20 to t=S-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=20 to t=S-1, that's (S-1) - 20 +1 = S - 20 actions.\n\ny_S = y_{20} + sum_{t=20}^{S-1} Δa_t\n\nSet y_S=9, y_20=4, so sum_{t=20}^{S-1} Δa_t =5\n\nEach |Δa_t| <=1, so to have sum=5, we need at least 5 actions, so S-20 >=5, so S >=25.\n\nThus y_S=9 with S>=25.\n\nThen y_{20 + H -1} =9, so 20 + H -1 = S >=25, so H-1 >=5, H>=6.\n\nAnd S = 20 + H -1.\n\nFor example, S=25, H=6; S=26, H=7, etc.\n\nMinimal H=6.\n\nWith H=6, S=20+6-1=25, y_{25}=9.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to be at y=8 at turn 24 and apply U at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=8 at turn 24 safely.\n\nNow, back to the car issue.\n\nIn the path to y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 at certain turns without collision.\n\nSpecifically, for y=8, we need to be on it at a safe time, not t=24.\n\nIn the sequence with all U, we are on y=8 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nWe need to be on y=8 at another time, like t=25 or earlier.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=25, we need to be on y=8 at t=24.\n\nt=24 is fixed for being on y=8 if we go directly.\n\nBut we can delay or advance the path.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are safe after t=20, we can stay on one of them for a turn to avoid t=24 on y=8.\n\nFor example, stay on y=4 or y=5 for an extra turn.\n\nIn the sequence I thought earlier: at t=20, apply S (stay), then y_{21}=4\n\nt=21, apply U, y_{22}=5\n\nt=22, apply U, y_{23}=6\n\nt=23, apply U, y_{24}=7\n\nt=24, apply U, y_{25}=8\n\nThen at t=25, on y=8, which is safe (t=25, k=5, cars at [1,12] and [49,60], 0 not in)\n\nThen apply U at t=25, y_{26}=9\n\nBut then y_{26}=9, so for y_S=9, S=26, then H from y_{20 + H -1}=26, so 20+H-1=26, H=7.\n\nBut with H=6, we need S=25.\n\nCan we reach y=9 at t=25 with H=6, but avoid being on y=8 at t=24.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=25, we must be on y=8 at t=24 and apply U.\n\nSo we must be on y=8 at t=24.\n\nBut t=24 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=8 at t=24 without collision.\n\nThus, for any path that reaches y=9 at t=25, it must pass through y=8 at t=24, which is collided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 at t=25 safely.\n\nThe earliest safe time is later.\n\nFor example, at t=25, be on y=8, safe, then go to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut y=9 at t=26.\n\nThen S=26, H=7.\n\nBut we might be able to reach earlier by going faster, but we cannot go faster than one per step.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=3 or something to wait, but that might take more time.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at t=21,22,23,25, etc.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=23, for example.\n\nThen at t=23, on y=8, apply U, then y_{24}=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=8 at t=23.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=20.\n\ny_{23} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22\n\nMax y_{23} = 4 +1+1+1=7, as before, cannot be 8.\n\nSo cannot be on y=8 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly, at t=22, y_{22} <=4+2=6, etc.\n\nSo the only time we can be on y=8 for reaching y=9 at t=25 is at t=24.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 at t=25 safely.\n\nNext possibility: reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nThen S=26, y_{26}=9.\n\nThen H=7, since 20 + H -1=26, H=7.\n\nTo have y_{26}=9, we need to be on y=8 at t=25 and apply U at t=25.\n\ny_{25} must be 8.\n\nNow, to be on y=8 at t=25.\n\nt=25 is safe for y=8.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=20 to y=8 at t=25.\n\ny_{25} = y_{20} + sum_{t=20}^{24} Δa_t\n\nSet to 8, so sum_{t=20}^{24} Δa_t =4.\n\nSince from 4 to 8, increase of 4.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=20 to t=24, 5 actions.\n\nsum of 5 Δa_t =4.\n\nSince each Δa <=1, it is possible, for example, four U and one S, or other combinations.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be on intermediate rows at safe times.\n\nNow, the safe times for each row:\n\ny=4: safe for all t>=20, as car moved away.\n\ny=5: unsafe only at t=20, safe for t>20.\n\ny=6: same, unsafe at t=20, safe t>20.\n\ny=7: same.\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=20 and t=24, safe at t=21,22,23,25,etc.\n\ny=3: but I don't need to go there, but if I stay, it might be safe or not.\n\ny=3 car: (12,1,right,6), unsafe at t=18,19, safe else, including t=20 and later.\n\nSimilarly y=2, y=1.\n\nBut since I go up, probably not necessary to go down.\n\nNow, to reach y=8 at t=25.\n\ny_{25}=8.\n\nWe can have different paths.\n\nFor example, one way: go up to y=5 quickly, then stay or something.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are safe after t=20, I can be on them.\n\nBut I need to be at y=8 at t=25.\n\nAlso, to minimize H, but H=7 for S=26.\n\nIs there a way with H=6? But we saw impossible because S=25 requires being on y=8 at t=24 unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=8 at t=24 but avoid collision, but no, because the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nPerhaps by moving to another x, but no, player is fixed at x=0, only y changes.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nNow with H=7, S=26, y_{26}=9.\n\nWe need to reach y=8 at t=25.\n\ny_{25}=8.\n\nFrom y_{20}=4, need to increase by 4 in 5 actions (t=20 to t=24).\n\nActions at t=20,21,22,23,24 to set y_{25} = y_{20} + Δa20 + Δa21 + Δa22 + Δa23 + Δa24 =8\n\nSo sum Δa =4.\n\nThus, four +1 and one 0, or other combinations with net +4.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that at each turn, when we are on a row, it is safe.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T from 20 to 25, we are at y_T, and it must be safe at that T.\n\ny_T is the row at turn T.\n\nThen we apply a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow for T from 20 to 25, y_T must be safe at T.\n\ny_{26} we don't care for collision, since we are at y=9.\n\nBut y_{26} is after.\n\nNow, let's define the position at each turn.\n\nTurn 20: y=4, which is safe.\n\nWe apply an action.\n\nThen turn 21: y_{21}, must be safe at t=21.\n\nSimilarly up to turn 25: y_{25}, must be safe at t=25.\n\nThen apply a_{25} to go to y_{26}=9.\n\nNow, y_{25} must be 8 to go to 9.\n\nNow, y_{25}=8.\n\nAt t=25, y=8 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_{25}=8 from y_{20}=4.\n\nWith actions from t=20 to t=24.\n\ny_{21} = y_{20} + Δa20\n\ny_{22} = y_{21} + Δa21\n\n...\n\ny_{25} = y_{24} + Δa24\n\nBut y_{25} = y_{20} + Δa20 + ... + Δa24\n\nSet y_{25}=8, y_{20}=4, so Δa20 + ... + Δa24 =4\n\nNow, the values y_T for T=20 to 25 must be safe at time T.\n\ny_20=4, safe.\n\nNow, let's list possible sequences.\n\nOne simple way: since we need to be at y=8 at t=25, and y=5,6,7 safe after t=20, we can go up directly but with one stay to delay.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=20: apply S, so Δa=0, y_{21}=4\n\nThen t=21: apply U, y_{22}=5\n\nt=22: apply U, y_{23}=6\n\nt=23: apply U, y_{24}=7\n\nt=24: apply U, y_{25}=8\n\nThen at t=25, y=8, safe (t=25), then apply U, y_{26}=9\n\nNow check safety:\n\nt=20: y=4, safe\n\nt=21: y=4 (since stayed), now y=4 at t=21, which is safe, as before.\n\nt=22: y=5, at t=22, k=2 for y=5, but y=5 cars: at t=22, k=T-20=2, span first car [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], second car [-11+24,24]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=23: y=6, similarly at t=23, k=3, [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], [-11+36,36]=[25,36], safe.\n\nt=24: y=7, at t=24, k=4, [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], [-11+48,48]=[37,48], safe.\n\nt=25: y=8, at t=25, k=5, first car [-59+60,-48+60]=[1,12], second car [-11+60,60]=[49,60], safe.\n\nThen apply U at t=25, to y_{26}=9.\n\nH=7 actions? Actions at t=20 to t=25.\n\nt=20: S\n\nt=21: U\n\nt=22: U\n\nt=23: U\n\nt=24: U\n\nt=25: U\n\nThat's 6 actions? t=20,21,22,23,24,25: six actions.\n\nH= number of actions from t=20 to t=20+H-1.\n\nHere actions at t=20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nSo t from 20 to 25 inclusive, that's 6 actions.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{20 + 6 -1} = y_{25} =8? But we need y_{25}=9?

Let's think.\n\nAt turn τ, we apply a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nFor turn τ = t1 + H -1, we are at y_τ, and we may apply an action, but the position at τ is y_τ.\n\nTo have y_τ =9 at τ = t1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions applied before τ determine y_τ.\n\nSpecifically, actions from t1 to τ-1 determine y_τ.\n\nSince y_τ = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1}^{τ-1} Δa_t\n\nτ = t1 + H -1\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1}^{ (t1 + H -1) -1 } Δa_t = y_{t1} + sum_{t=t1}^{t1 + H -2} Δa_t\n\nNumber of actions: from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -2, that's (H-1) actions.\n\nBut the sequence is given as {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1 + H-1.\n\nThat's H actions.\n\nThen after applying these H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThere is a mismatch.\n\nFor example, with H actions at t=20 to 20+H-1, after all, we are at turn 20+H.\n\nBut we want at turn 20+H-1 to be at y=9.\n\nAt turn 20+H-1, before applying a_{20+H-1}, we are at y_{20+H-1}.\n\nThen we apply a_{20+H-1}, which sets y_{20+H}.\n\nBut for the position at turn 20+H-1 to be 9, it is set by previous actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_{20+H-1} is determined by actions up to t=20+H-2.\n\nThe actions from t=20 to t=20+H-2 determine y_{20+H-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=20 to 20+H-2, that's (H-1) actions.\n\nBut the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t1+t}, so for H actions, it includes up to a_{t1+H-1}, which affects y_{t1+H}, not relevant for y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} =9, we need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, which is set by actions from t1 to (t1+H-1)-1 = t1+H-2.\n\nSo the action at t1+H-1 is not used for setting y_{t1+H-1}, but it is applied at that turn, but it affects the next position.\n\nFor the position at turn t1+H-1, it is fixed before applying a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to specify a_{t1+H-1}, but it doesn't affect y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nFor reaching y=9 at turn t1+H-1, we can have any action at that turn, but since we are at y=9, applying U,D,S might not matter, but we need to specify an action.\n\nIn this case, for the turn when we are at y=9, we can choose any action, but since we have to reach it, the action at that turn doesn't change the position at that turn.\n\nTo minimize H, we need the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWith t1=20, y20=4.\n\ny_S =9 for S=20+H-1.\n\nS >=25 as before.\n\nS=25: y25=9, requires being on y=8 at t=24 unsafe.\n\nS=26: y26=9, possible with being on y=8 at t=25 safe.\n\nThen S=26, so 20+H-1=26, H=7.\n\nActions from t=20 to t=20+7-1=26? t from 0 to H-1=6, so t=20 to 26.\n\nBut at t=26, we apply a26, which sets y27, but we don't care.\n\nFor the position at t=26, y26, it is set by actions up to t=25.\n\nWith actions at t=20 to t=25, we can set y26=9.\n\nThen at turn t=26, we are at y=9, and we apply a26, but it doesn't affect the position at t=26.\n\nSince we need to specify the action, we can choose S or something.\n\nBut to have y_{t1+H-1}=y26=9 with H=7.\n\nt1+H-1=20+7-1=26, yes.\n\nSequence: actions at t=20 to t=26.\n\nBut to have y26=9, we need actions from t=20 to t=25 to set it.\n\nFor example:\n\na20: action at t=20, affects y21\n\n...\n\na25: action at t=25, affects y26\n\nSo with a25=U, and y25=8, then y26=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at t=25.\n\nActions:\n\na20: let's say S, so y21=4\n\na21: U, y22=5\n\na22: U, y23=6\n\na23: U, y24=7\n\na24: U, y25=8\n\na25: U, y26=9\n\nThen at turn t=25, we are at y=8, apply a25=U, go to y26=9.\n\nAt turn t=26, we are at y=9, and we apply a26, but since the sequence requires actions up to a_{t1+H-1}=a_{26}, we need to specify a26.\n\nAt that point, we are at y=9, so we can apply S, for example.\n\nBut the collision is not an issue since we are at y=9, no cars.\n\nNow, for the turns, safety:\n\nTurn t=20: y=4, safe\n\nt=21: y=4 (after a20=S), safe\n\nt=22: y=5, safe at t=22\n\nt=23: y=6, safe\n\nt=24: y=7, safe\n\nt=25: y=8, safe at t=25\n\nt=26: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nWith H=7.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=6 would require S=20+6-1=25, y25=9, which requires y24=8 and a24=U, but y24=8 at t=24 unsafe, so no.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have 7 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn t1: a_{20} = S\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a_{22} = U\n\nTurn t1+3: a_{23} = U\n\nTurn t1+4: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn t1+5: a_{25} = U\n\nTurn t1+6: a_{26} = ? \n\nAt t=26, we are at y=9, so we can apply S, for example.\n\nSince we reached the goal, but we have to specify the action.\n\nWe could have different actions, but this works.\n\nIn this, we have an extra action at t=26, but it doesn't hurt.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but H is fixed.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier with a different path, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe at t=23, but we cannot be there at t=23 from start.\n\nOr, we could go down to y=3 at some point to kill time, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=20, go D to y=3, then up, but y=3 at t=20 is safe, but going down and up takes more steps.\n\nFor instance, to reach y=8 at t=25, with net +4, if I go down, I need to compensate, so more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the sequence with one stay at beginning is fine.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: S (or whatever)\n\nIn the action at t=26, since we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states briefly.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt t=20: y=4, car on y=4: (12,1,right,6), at t=20, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=21: y=4, same, safe.\n\nt=22: y=5, cars: at t=22, k=2, first car [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], second car [-11+24,24]=[13,24], 0 not in.\n\nt=23: y=6, similar, k=3, [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], [-11+36,36]=[25,36], safe.\n\nt=24: y=7, k=4, [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], [-11+48,48]=[37,48], safe.\n\nt=25: y=8, k=5, first car [-59+60,-48+60]=[1,12], second car [-11+60,60]=[49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=26: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nWith H=7.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut in the sequence, action at t=26 is applied, but y26=9 already, so S is fine.\n\nWe could have done the stay later, but this is minimal H.\n\nPerhaps we can have the stay on another row.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=4, stay at y=5.\n\nBut similar.\n\nOr to avoid the last action, but H=7 is fixed.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nAnswer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) is 7, as it is impossible to reach \\(y=9\\) safely in fewer turns due to collision constraints on freeway \\(y=8\\) at turn 24.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid collisions:\n- At turn 20, staying at \\(y=4\\) is safe, as the car on freeway \\(y=4\\) (span \\([1, 12]\\) at turn 20) does not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- Moving up to \\(y=5\\) at turn 22 is safe, as both cars on \\(y=5\\) (spans \\([61, 72]\\) and \\([13, 24]\\) at turn 22) do not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- Moving up to \\(y=6\\) at turn 23 is safe, as both cars on \\(y=6\\) (spans \\([73, 84]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\) at turn 23) do not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- Moving up to \\(y=7\\) at turn 24 is safe, as both cars on \\(y=7\\) (spans \\([85, 96]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\) at turn 24) do not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- Moving up to \\(y=8\\) at turn 25 is safe, as both cars on \\(y=8\\) (spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\) at turn 25) do not cover \\(x=0\\).\n- Moving up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 26 is safe, as \\(y=9\\) has no cars.\n- The action at turn 26 (stay) is applied after reaching \\(y=9\\) and does not affect the position.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=20}^{26}\\) is:\n\n```\nTurn 20: S\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\n```\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ S} }",

Left-moving would decrease, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving based on the data.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the player's x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe note says that when you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and after action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So collision is checked based on your current y at each turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=22. For any future turn T, I need to compute the car's span based on the initial span at t1 and the speed.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = t1 = 22.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, so to reach y=9, I need to move up from y=6 to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on y=1 to 8, but since I'm starting at y=6, and moving up, I might not need to go below y=6, but let's see.\n\nThe actions change y, so I could potentially move down, but that might not be efficient since I need to go up to 9. Moving down could help avoid cars, but it might increase H, and we want minimal H, so probably I should move up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to find out for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, collision happens if for the freeway y at turn T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe car spans move with speed s. Since all cars are right-moving (direction right), their positions increase over time.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time t1, span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume, since head and tail.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, with τ ≤ h, I think.\n\nIn the description:\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be decreasing, but here all are right, so position increases.\n\nAlso, for collision, it's when 0 is in Span(T) for the freeway at y_T.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I have a list of cars.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway at t=22.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-27, τ=-38, d=right, s=3\n\nSince direction right, and span [τ, h] = [-38, -27]? But τ and h, which is head and tail?\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], but τ is tail, h is head? I think I need to clarify.\n\nLook: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nFor right-moving car, if it's moving right, head is the front, so if direction right, head should be on the right, tail on left.\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, position: tail at τ, head at h, with τ < h, and as time increases, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nSo for freeway 1: one car, tail τ=-38, head h=-27, s=3, right.\n\nSo at t=22, span is [-38, -27].\n\nSince moving right, at time T, span is [-38 + 3(T-22), -27 + 3(T-22)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this interval at some T when player is on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t=22: [13, 24]? τ=13, h=24, so [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 6(T-22), 24 + 6(T-22)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \" (24,13,right,6) \" so identical to freeway 2.\n\nh=24, τ=13, s=6, right.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (24,13,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: first (-48,-59,right,12), second (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail τ=-59, head h=-48? But it says (-48,-59,right,12), so h=-48, τ=-59, but if moving right, head should be larger, but -48 > -59, yes, so τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59,-48] at t=22.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), so τ=13, h=24, span [13,24] at t=22.\n\nBoth speed 12.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \" (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12) \" yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-35,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35? (-24,-35,right,12), so τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35,-24] at t=22.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), span [13,24] at t=22.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time T, is there a car such that 0 is in [τ + s(T-22), h + s(T-22)] for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check all on that freeway.\n\nBut for collision, if for the player's y at T, and y=k, and if 0 is covered by any car on k at T, collision.\n\nNow, player starts at y=6 at t=22.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=6 to y=9, if no cars, I could just go U,U,U in three turns, so H=3, ending at y=9 at turn t=24? Let's see.\n\nTurn t=22: position y=6\n\nAfter action at t=22, y changes for t=23.\n\nSequence: at turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=22, we take action a_{22}, which sets y_{23} = y_{22} + Δy_{22}\n\nSimilarly, at t=23, a_{23} sets y_{24}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t=22 with y_{22} =6.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=22 + H -1, we have y_{22 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, at turn t=22, we need y_{22}=9, but it's 6, so not possible.\n\nH=1: after 0 actions, at turn t=22, position is (0,6), not (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nt1=22, actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{22}, a_{23}, ..., a_{22+H-1}\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t=22 + H, the position is y_{22+H} = y_{22} + sum of Δy from t=22 to 22+H-1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t=22: position (0,y_{22}) = (0,6)\n\nWe take action a_{22}, which determines y_{23} = y_{22} + Δy_{22}\n\nThen at turn t=23: position (0,y_{23})\n\nTake action a_{23}, set y_{24}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have taken actions from a_{22} to a_{22+H-1}, and at turn t=22 + H, position y_{22+H}.\n\nWe want y_{22+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if we take U at each step, at t=23, y=7; t=24, y=8; t=25, y=9. So after 3 actions, at turn t=25, y=9. So H=3.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at each turn when we are on a freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn t, when we are at position (0,y_t), if y_t is between 1 and 8, we need to not collide with cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nIf y_t=0 or y_t=9, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, in this case, we start at y=6, which is freeway 6, so we need to check collision at t=22 on y=6.\n\nThen depending on actions, we move to other y.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each time, when x=0 is covered.\n\nSince time is discrete, and turns are integers, T is integer.\n\nAlso, the car spans: since positions are real? But in the description, head and tail are given as integers, and speed integers, so positions are integers, I think. h and τ are integers, s integer, so span positions are integers.\n\nIn the car state, h and τ are integers, like -27, -38, etc., and s integer, so at time T, positions are integers.\n\nx=0 is integer, so we can find for each k and T, if 0 is in some car's span on k at T.\n\nNow, for freeway k=1:\n\nCar: τ=-38, h=-27, s=3, right.\n\nSpan at T: [ -38 + 3(T-22) , -27 + 3(T-22) ]\n\n0 in span if -38 + 3(T-22) ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3(T-22)\n\nLet u = T-22, time offset.\n\nSo -38 + 3u ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3u\n\nFirst inequality: -38 + 3u ≤ 0 => 3u ≤ 38 => u ≤ 38/3 ≈ 12.666, so u <= 12 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= -27 + 3u => 3u >= 27 => u >= 9\n\nSo for u from 9 to 12 inclusive.\n\nu=9: -38 + 27 = -11, -27+27=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nu=10: -38+30= -8, -27+30=3, span [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nu=11: -38+33= -5, -27+33=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nu=12: -38+36= -2, -27+36=9, span [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nu=13: -38+39=1, -27+39=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision when T-22 from 9 to 12, i.e., T=31 to 34.\n\nT=22+9=31 to 22+12=34.\n\nNow, freeway 2: car τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 6u, 24 + 6u] where u=T-22\n\n0 in span: 13+6u <= 0 <= 24+6u\n\nBut 13+6u <=0 implies 6u <= -13, u <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, since u>=0, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 24+6u always true for u>=0, but left inequality never true, so 0 never in span for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same car, so never collision on y=2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have the same car as 2, so no issue.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 12u, -48 + 12u]\n\n0 in: -59+12u <=0 <= -48+12u\n\nFirst: -59+12u <=0 => 12u <=59 => u <= 59/12 ≈4.916, u<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12u => 12u >=48 => u>=4\n\nSo u=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nu=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at u=4, T=22+4=26.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: τ=13, h=24, s=12\n\nSpan [13+12u, 24+12u]\n\n0 in: 13+12u <=0 <=24+12u\n\n13+12u <=0 => 12u <=-13, u<= -1.083, impossible.\n\nSo only first car causes collision at T=26.\n\nBut only if player on y=5 at T=26.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nτ=-59, h=-48 for first, s=12\n\nIdentical to freeway 5, so collision at T=26 when on y=6.\n\nFirst car: at u=4, T=26, span [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nSecond car no.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 5 and 6, collision at T=26 on y=7.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-24,-35,right,12) so τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [-35 +12u, -24 +12u]\n\n0 in: -35+12u <=0 <= -24+12u\n\nFirst: -35+12u <=0 => 12u <=35 => u <= 35/12 ≈2.916, u<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12u => 12u >=24 => u>=2\n\nSo u=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nu=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at u=2, T=24.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), τ=13,h=24,s=12\n\nSpan [13+12u,24+12u]\n\n0 in: 13+12u <=0 <=24+12u\n\n13+12u <=0 => 12u <= -13, impossible, so never.\n\nSo on freeway 8, collision at T=24 when on y=8.\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=31,32,33,34\n\n- y=2: no collision\n\n- y=3: no collision\n\n- y=4: no collision\n\n- y=5: collision at T=26\n\n- y=6: collision at T=26\n\n- y=7: collision at T=26\n\n- y=8: collision at T=24\n\nAlso, for y=5,6,7, collision only at T=26, not other times, since the cars only cover 0 at that specific u.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=24.\n\ny=1 at T=31-34.\n\nPlayer starts at t=22, y=6.\n\nAt turn t=22, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nOn freeway 6, is there collision at t=22? u=T-22=0.\n\nAt u=0, for freeway 6: cars at [-59,-48] and [13,24], neither contains 0, so no collision at t=22 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal H: to reach y=9, need at least 3 up actions, but with possible stays or downs, but downs would increase H, so probably not minimal.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on certain y at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, on y=6 at t=26, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,7 at t=26, y=8 at t=24.\n\nBut we start at t=22.\n\nLet me list the player's path.\n\nAt t=22: y=6, safe as above.\n\nWe take action a_{22}, which sets y_{23}.\n\nThen at t=23, position y_{23}, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach y_{22+H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y=6, to reach y=9, we need net +3 in y, so minimal actions: three U actions, and possibly S or D, but D would require more U, so for minimal H, we should avoid D and minimize S.\n\nH is the number of actions, and we reach after H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H steps, from t=22 to t=22+H-1 actions, position at t=22+H.\n\ny_{22+H} =6 + sum_{t=22 to 22+H-1} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nWe need sum Δy =3, so minimal H when all Δy=1, so H=3, y at t=25=9.\n\nWith actions: at t=22, a=U, y23=7; t=23, a=U, y24=8; t=24, a=U, y25=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=22: y=6, freeway 6. At t=22, u=0, cars on y=6: [-59,-48] and [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=23: y=7, freeway 7. At t=23, u=1, T=23.\n\nFor y=7: cars (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nAt u=1, T=23: first car span: -59+12= -47, -48+12= -36? u=1, T-22=1\n\nSpan: [-59 +12*1, -48 +12*1] = [-47, -36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAt t=24: y=8, freeway 8. At t=24, u=2, T=24.\n\nFor y=8: cars (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: at u=2, [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], which includes 0. Collision!\n\nAnd we have collision at t=24 on y=8, as per earlier.\n\nSo in this path, at t=24, y=8, collision.\n\nThus, we cannot go directly up at t=24 to y=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=8 at t=24.\n\nAlso, at t=26, y=5,6,7 have collision, but t=26 might be later.\n\nIn the minimal path, t=24 is when we might be on y=8.\n\nIn the direct up path, we are on y=8 at t=24, which has collision.\n\nSo we need to modify the actions.\n\nPossible ways: delay going to y=8, or go down temporarily, but that might increase H.\n\nSince y=2,3,4 have no cars, always safe, we could go down to those and wait, but that might take more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so perhaps we can stay or move to avoid the collision time.\n\nAt t=24, we need not be on y=8.\n\nIn the sequence, if we are at y=7 at t=23, we can choose not to go up to y=8 at t=24, but stay or go down.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nLet's list the times and dangerous positions.\n\nCritical times:\n\n- On y=8 at t=24: collision\n\n- On y=5,6,7 at t=26: collision\n\n- On y=1 at t=31-34: but that might be later, and we might not be there if we go up fast.\n\nSince we start at t=22, and t=24 is soon, t=26 is a bit later.\n\nWe start at y=6 at t=22, safe.\n\nAfter a_{22}, we set y_{23}.\n\ny_{23} can be 5,6,7.\n\nIf we go down to y=5, then at t=23, y=5, which is freeway 5.\n\nAt t=23, u=1, T=23.\n\nFor y=5: cars at u=1: first car [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], no 0; second [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no 0. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, if stay at y=6, at t=23, as before, safe.\n\nIf go up to y=7, safe as before.\n\nNow, at t=23, we take a_{23}, set y_{24}.\n\ny_{24} can be from 5 to 8, depending on y_{23}.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=8 at t=24.\n\nAlso, at t=24, if we are on other y, need to check.\n\nFor example, if at t=23, y=7, we can go to y=6,7, or 8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=24 collision, so we cannot go to y=8. So from y=7, at t=23, we must choose S or D, to y=7 or y=6 for t=24.\n\nIf we go to y=6 or y=7 at t=24.\n\nNow, at t=24, for y=6: u=2, T=24.\n\nFreeway 6: cars [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24]? u=2, -59+24= -35? -59 + 12*2 = -59+24= -35, -48+24= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], no 0. So safe on y=6 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=24: u=2, freeway 7: first car [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no 0; second [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], no 0. Safe.\n\ny=5 at t=24: u=2, freeway 5: first car [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], no 0; second [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], no 0. Safe.\n\nBut y=8 at t=24 unsafe.\n\nNow, we also need to avoid t=26 on y=5,6,7.\n\nt=26 is u=4, T=26.\n\nAt that time, on y=5,6,7, collision.\n\nBut t=26 is after t=24.\n\nIn terms of actions, we have to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we cannot be on y=8 at t=24, in the direct path, we have to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=23, if we are at y=7, instead of going up, we stay or go down.\n\nBut if we stay at y=7 at t=24, safe as above.\n\nThen at t=24, we can go to y=8 or other.\n\nBut y=8 at t=24 is unsafe, but at other times it might be safe.\n\nFor y=8, when is it safe?\n\nEarlier, collision only at t=24, u=2.\n\nAt other times, for example u=0, t=22: span first car [-35,-24], no 0; second [13,24], no 0. Safe.\n\nu=1, t=23: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], no 0; [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no 0. Safe.\n\nu=2, t=24: [-11,0], collision.\n\nu=3, t=25: [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], no 0; [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], no 0. Safe.\n\nu=4, t=26: [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], no 0; second car [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], no 0. But on y=8 at t=26, no collision, but we care about y=8 only if player is there.\n\nAt t=26, on y=8, no collision, since no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7: collision only at t=26.\n\nFor example, y=6 at t=26: u=4, first car span [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0], 0 included, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 and y=7.\n\nBut at other times, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe start at t=22, y=6, safe.\n\nWe need to set y_{23}.\n\nOptions: go down to y=5, stay y=6, or up to y=7.\n\nAll should be safe at t=23, as before.\n\nThen at t=23, set y_{24}.\n\nNow, we cannot be on y=8 at t=24.\n\nSo if we are at y=7 at t=23, we cannot go to y=8, so must go to y=6 or y=7 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=6, can go to y=5,6,7; if at y=5, to y=4,5,6.\n\nNow, y=4 is safe always, no cars? Freeway 4 has cars, but earlier we saw no collision ever, since the car is at [13+6u,24+6u] which for u>=0, min 13, so never <=0, so always safe on y=4.\n\nSimilarly y=3 and y=2 always safe.\n\ny=1 has collision only at T=31-34, which is late, probably not relevant if we go up fast.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we should not go down too much.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=26.\n\nt=26 is turn 26.\n\nCurrent t=22, so t=26 is 4 turns later.\n\nNow, the position at t=26 depends on actions.\n\nFirst, let's handle the immediate issue at t=24.\n\nSuppose at t=23, we are at y=7 (by going up at t=22).\n\nThen at t=23, if we go to y=8, but at t=24 y=8 collision, so we cannot.\n\nSo we must choose S or D to stay at y=7 or go to y=6.\n\nSay we stay at y=7 at t=24.\n\nThen at t=24, y=7, safe as before.\n\nNow, at t=24, we take action to set y_{25}.\n\nWe can go to y=6,7,8.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=25, then at turn t=25, position y=8.\n\nNow, t=25, u=3, for y=8: as above, span [1,12] and [49,60], no 0, safe.\n\nThen at t=25, we can go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSequence so far:\n\nt=22: start y=6, take U, so y23=7\n\nt=23: position y=7, take S (stay), so y24=7\n\nt=24: position y=7, take U, so y25=8\n\nt=25: position y=8, take U, so y26=9\n\nNow, at t=26, position y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached y=9.\n\nBut we need to check all turns for collision.\n\nAt t=22: y=6, safe\n\nt=23: y=7, safe\n\nt=24: y=7, safe\n\nt=25: y=8, safe as above (u=3)\n\nt=26: y=9, safe\n\nAnd y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut we have H actions, from t=22 to t=22+H-1.\n\nAfter actions, position at t=22+H.\n\nHere, actions: at t=22: U, t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U\n\nSo actions at t=22,23,24,25, so H=4 actions.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at t=26, y=9.\n\nMinimal possible was 3, but we used 4 because we stayed one turn.\n\nIs there a way with H=3?\n\nWith H=3, we need to reach y=9 at t=25.\n\ny_{25} =9.\n\ny_{22}=6, so need net +3 in three actions, so must all be U: y23=7, y24=8, y25=9.\n\nBut at t=24, y=8, which has collision at t=24, as span includes 0.\n\nSo impossible with all U in three turns.\n\nCould we have a different sequence with H=3?\n\nFor example, at t=22, take S, so y23=6\n\nThen t=23, take U, y24=7\n\nt=24, take U, y25=8? But we need y25=9, not 8.\n\ny_{25} = y_{22} + Δy22 + Δy23 + Δy24\n\nSet to 9, y22=6, so Δy22 + Δy23 + Δy24 =3.\n\nEach +1 or 0 or -1.\n\nTo sum to 3 in three steps, must all be +1, no other way. Because if one 0, sum <=2, if one -1, sum <=1, etc.\n\nSo only possibility is U,U,U with y23=7, y24=8, y25=9.\n\nBut at t=24, y=8, collision.\n\nThus, impossible with H=3.\n\nTherefore minimal H is 4.\n\nNow, in the sequence I have: with H=4, actions U, S, U, U\n\nBut at t=25, y=8, and we go to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut we need to avoid t=26 on y=5,6,7.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=26, y=9, not on freeway, so fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if we are on dangerous positions.\n\nt=22: y=6, safe\n\nt=23: y=7, safe\n\nt=24: y=7, safe (since we stayed)\n\nt=25: y=8, safe\n\nt=26: y=9, safe\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut is there a sequence without staying?\n\nFor example, go down first.\n\nAt t=22, take D, so y23=5\n\nt=23: y=5, take U, y24=6\n\nt=24: y=6, take U, y25=7\n\nBut y25=7, not 9. To reach y=9, we need more actions.\n\nWith H=4, we can do, but it might be slower or same.\n\nIn this case, at t=25, y=7, then we need to go to y=8 and then to 9, so at least two more actions, so H=5 or more.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=22, take U to y=7\n\nt=23, take D to y=6? Then t=24, y=6, take U to y=7, t=25 take U to y=8, but y25=8, not 9, need another action to y=9, so H=5 actions to reach y=9 at t=27.\n\nWorse than H=4.\n\nSo the sequence with stay at t=23 is better.\n\nBut we can go to y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=23, instead of staying, go down to y=6.\n\nt=22: take U, y23=7\n\nt=23: position y=7, take D, so y24=6\n\nt=24: position y=6, take U, y25=7\n\nt=25: position y=7, take U, y26=8\n\nThen need another U to y=9 at t=27, so H=5, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter staying, at t=24, we go to y=8, but at t=24 we are at y=7, we can go to y=8 at t=25.\n\nIn the sequence: t=24: y=7, take U, to y=8 at t=25.\n\nThen t=25: y=8, take U to y=9 at t=26.\n\nAs before.\n\nCan we reach earlier? With H=4, at t=26, y=9.\n\nIs it possible to reach at t=25? No, because with three actions max y=9 at t=25, but impossible due to collision.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used one S, which is fine.\n\nNow, but we have to consider t=26 collision on y=5,6,7.\n\nIn this sequence, we are not on y=5,6,7 at t=26, we are on y=9.\n\nBut suppose we are slower.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=7 at t=23 and stay until after t=26, but that would delay reaching y=9.\n\nIn our case, we are fine.\n\nAnother sequence: start by staying at t=22.\n\nt=22: take S, y23=6\n\nThen t=23: take U, y24=7\n\nt=24: take U, y25=8? But at t=24, y=7, take U to y=8 at t=25? Let's see positions.\n\nAt t=23: position y=6? After action at t=22 S, y23=6\n\nt=23: position y=6, take U, so y24=7\n\nt=24: position y=7, take U, so y25=8\n\nBut y25=8, not 9. To reach y=9, need another action, so t=25 take U, y26=9, so actions: t=22 S, t=23 U, t=24 U, t=25 U, H=4, same as before, but now at t=24 we are at y=7, which is safe, and t=25 at y=8, safe, t=26 at y=9.\n\nBut compared to previous sequence, we have an extra S at the beginning instead of later.\n\nBut H same.\n\nIn the first sequence, we go up immediately but stay later.\n\nBut both H=4.\n\nNow, in the first sequence, we avoided y=8 at t=24 by staying at y=7.\n\nNow, about t=26: in both sequences, we are not on y=5,6,7 at t=26.\n\nIn the sequence: if we are at y=8 at t=25, and go to y=9 at t=26, fine.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at t=24, go to y=8 at t=25, etc.\n\nBut we need to make sure that at no point we are on a freeway with collision.\n\nAnother point: we start at y=6, which is freeway 6, and at t=26, if we were there, collision, but we are not.\n\nIn our sequences, we move away.\n\nBut suppose we stay longer on y=6 or something, but we don't.\n\nFor example, if at t=22, we stay, y23=6\n\nt=23, stay, y24=6\n\nt=24, stay, y25=6, but then we need to go up, but at t=26, if on y=6, collision.\n\nBut in our case, we don't stay that long.\n\nIn minimal H, we go up as fast as possible with the constraint.\n\nSo back to the sequence.\n\nWe also have y=1 collision at T=31-34, but that is turn 31 to 34, which is later than t=26, and since we reach y=9 by t=26, we are above, so no issue.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions starting from turn t1=22.\n\nSo for H=4, actions: a_{22}, a_{23}, a_{24}, a_{25}\n\nIn the sequence: for example, a_{22} = U, a_{23} = S, a_{24} = U, a_{25} = U\n\nThen position: after a_{22} U, y23=7\n\nAfter a_{23} S, y24=7\n\nAfter a_{24} U, y25=8\n\nAfter a_{25} U, y26=9\n\nAt t=26, y=9.\n\nCheck collision:\n\nt=22: y=6, freeway 6, u=0, cars [-59,-48] and [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=23: y=7, freeway 7, u=1, cars [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36] no, [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] no, safe.\n\nt=24: y=7, freeway 7, u=2, cars [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24] no, [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] no, safe.\n\nt=25: y=8, freeway 8, u=3, cars first [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12] no 0, second [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] no, safe.\n\nt=26: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nWe could have a different sequence, like:\n\na_{22} = S, a_{23} = U, a_{24} = U, a_{25} = U\n\nThen: t=22: y=6, safe\n\na_{22} S: y23=6\n\nt=23: position y=6, take U, so y24=7\n\nt=24: position y=7, take U, so y25=8\n\nt=25: position y=8, take U, so y26=9\n\nNow, at t=23: y=6, freeway 6, u=1, T=23\n\nCars: first [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36] no, second [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] no, safe.\n\nt=24: y=7, as before, safe.\n\nt=25: y=8, u=3, safe as above.\n\nSame H=4.\n\nBut in this case, we stayed at the beginning, but still reached at same time.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nBut perhaps the first one is more direct, going up first.\n\nBut since H same, we can choose.\n\nNow, but in the first sequence, we avoided the critical point directly.\n\nBut both work.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be in the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t1 +1}\n\n...\n\nFor H=4, t from 0 to 3.\n\nt1=22.\n\nSo actions for turn 22, 23, 24, 25.\n\nIn the sequence: let's use the first one: a_{22} = U, a_{23} = S, a_{24} = U, a_{25} = U\n\nTo write:\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = S\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 26, y=9.\n\nBut turn 25 is the last action, position at turn 26.\n\nIn the action sequence, it's up to turn 25.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4 but reaching earlier? No, since turn 26 is the earliest possible.\n\nAnother thing: could we go to y=8 at t=25 directly without being at y=8 earlier in a dangerous way.\n\nIn this sequence, we are at y=8 at t=25, which is safe.\n\nWe could go to y=8 at t=23 or something, but let's see.\n\nFor example, at t=22, take U to y=7\n\nt=23, take U to y=8? But at t=24, position y=8, which is at t=24, collision.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=23? At turn t=23, position y=8.\n\nThen we need to check.\n\nAt t=23, y=8.\n\nu=1, T=23.\n\nFor y=8: cars first [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12] no 0, second [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] no, so safe at t=23 on y=8.\n\nThen at t=23, we can take action to go to y=9 or stay or down.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nIf at t=23, we go to y=9, then y24=9.\n\nBut at turn t=24, position y=9, reached.\n\nBut how?\n\nActions: t=22: take U, so y23=7\n\nt=23: position y=7, take U, so y24=8? No.\n\nAfter action at t=23, y_{24} is set.\n\nTo have y24=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=23 and take U.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt t=22: start y=6, take U, so y23=7\n\nt=23: position y=7, take U, so y24=8\n\nBut at t=24, position y=8, which has collision at t=24.\n\nIf we could be at y=8 earlier.\n\nAt t=22, if we take U to y=7, but not to 8 directly.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=23, we need to have y23=8.\n\nBut y22=6, so to have y23=8, we need Δy= +2, impossible, since actions change by at most 1.\n\nSo cannot jump; y23 can be 5,6,7 only.\n\nThus, cannot be on y=8 before t=24 in a minimal path.\n\nEarliest to be on y=8 is t=24 with U,U from start, but collision.\n\nSo we must delay being on y=8 until t=25 or later.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=8 at t=25.\n\nt=25 is fine.\n\nThus, the sequence is good.\n\nNow, about the t=26 collision on y=5,6,7.\n\nIn our case, we are not there at t=26.\n\nBut suppose we take a longer path, we might hit it.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=5 and stay, then at t=26 on y=5, collision.\n\nBut we don't.\n\nSo in minimal H, it's fine.\n\nTherefore, with H=4, actions: U, S, U, U for turns 22 to 25.\n\nWe can write the answer.\n\nBut in the action, S is stay.\n\nNow, the output format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, there are two cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: at t=26, collision on y=6, but we are not there.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=25, we are at y=8, then go to y=9.\n\nBut t=25 is turn 25, u=3, safe.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nSequence: a_{22} = U, a_{23} = S, a_{24} = U, a_{25} = U\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nt1=22.\n\nH=4, so up to turn 25.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) is 4, with the sequence of actions \\(U, S, U, U\\) for turns 22 to 25.\n\n- **Turn 22**: Action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y_{23} = 7\\).\n- **Turn 23**: Action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y_{24} = 7\\).\n- **Turn 24**: Action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y_{25} = 8\\).\n- **Turn 25**: Action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y_{26} = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- At turn 22 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 cars at spans \\([-59, -48]\\) and \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 23 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 cars at spans \\([-47, -36]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 24 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 cars at spans \\([-35, -24]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 25 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 cars at spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n- At turn 26 (\\(y = 9\\)): No freeway, safe.\n\nNo sequence with \\(H = 3\\) is possible because it requires three consecutive \\(U\\) actions, but this would place the player on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 24, where a collision occurs (freeway 8 car span \\([-11, 0]\\) covers 0).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it only matters if the player is on a freeway at turn T and at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span. Also, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collision at that turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 23, player at y=7.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFirst, since we're at y=7, and we need to get to y=9, which is only two steps up, but we might need to wait or avoid cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but there might be cars on y=8 or y=7 that we need to avoid when moving.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars. Only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once we're at y=9, we're done, and no collision check needed for y=9 since it's not a freeway.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t1=23.\n\nFor each freeway, we have cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so for right-moving, span increases, for left-moving, span decreases, but in the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: positions increase.\n\nBut in the input, it's listed as (head, tail, direction), but I need to know which is head and tail.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says [h, τ] and then both decrease, so h and τ are positions at time t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, and both decrease, so if it's left-moving, head is on the left? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving, span moves left, so if head is at h, and tail at τ, and both decrease, so h decreases, meaning head is at a higher position decreasing? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of the span at time t.\n\nFor a car, at time t, it occupies a set of x-positions from min to max.\n\nThe \"head\" might be the front depending on direction.\n\nBut for collision, we care about whether x=0 is in the span at time t when the player is on that freeway.\n\nSo for each freeway, at time T, if the player is on freeway k, then we need that for all cars on k, 0 is not in their span at time T.\n\nNow, for a given car, at time t1, we have head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at time T, the position changes.\n\nFor left-moving car (d=left), position decreases, so the span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]? But from the rule:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAssuming that at t1, h and τ are positions, and h > τ or something? In the span [h, τ], if it's left-moving, h might be the left end or right end.\n\nThe notation says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\", and for left-moving, it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so the span shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and it becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so span shifts right.\n\nIn right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h, and it becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end at t1, h is the right end at t1, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFor right-moving car:\n\nAt t1, span is [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, with τ < h, I assume, since it's a span.\n\nThen at T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so both increase, moving right.\n\nFor left-moving car:\n\nAt t1, span is [h, τ], and it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nNow, for [h, τ], if it's left-moving, and span is decreasing, likely h is the right end and τ is the left end, so at t1, position from τ to h with τ < h, and after moving left, min decreases, max decreases.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it's written as [h, τ] but h and τ might not be in order; the span is from min to max.\n\nI think it's better to interpret the span as [min, max] at each time.\n\nFor a right-moving car at t1: span [τ, h] with τ <= h, so min=τ, max=h.\n\nAt T, min = τ + s(T-t1), max = h + s(T-t1)\n\nFor left-moving at t1: span [h, τ], but in the text it's [h, τ], which might imply h and τ with h <= τ or not? The notation is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the input.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ is given as -35, h as -24, so min=τ=-35, max=h=-24.\n\nThen for right-moving, min increases, max increases.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (30,19,right,6) — τ=19, h=30? But 19 to 30, min=19, max=30.\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head is at higher x, so in (h,τ), h is head, τ is tail, so for right-moving, h > τ, span [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if direction left, head would be at lower x.\n\nBut in the input, for all cars here, direction is right, I think.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) — so head h=-24, tail τ=-35, since right-moving, head at higher x, so span from τ=-35 to h=-24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (30,19,right,6) — head=30, tail=19, span [19,30]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (30,19,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same (30,19,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12) — two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, span [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, span [25,36]\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nIn the list, for freeway 5,6,7,8, there are two cars each.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car, 2,3,4 have one each.\n\nFreeway 1: one car\n\n2: one\n\n3: one\n\n4: one\n\n5: two cars\n\n6: two\n\n7: two\n\n8: two\n\nAnd all are right-moving.\n\nNow, player at y=7 at t=23.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up to y=8), D (down to y=6), S (stay at y=7).\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so eventually up.\n\nBut we might need to wait if there are cars at x=0.\n\nSince we start at y=7, and freeway y=7 has cars? Freeway k is y=k, I think.\n\nThe freeway is given as k, and y=k.\n\nSo at y=7, freeway 7, there are cars.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt time t=23.\n\nFirst, for a given freeway and time, we need to see when x=0 is covered by a car span.\n\nFor collision at turn T on freeway k, we need that for some car on k, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nFor each car, span at time T.\n\nSet t1=23.\n\nΔT = T - 23\n\nFor a car with min_t1, max_t1, speed s, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, min_T = min_t1 + s * ΔT\n\nmax_T = max_t1 + s * ΔT\n\nThen 0 is in span if min_T <= 0 <= max_T\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow for freeway 7 at time T.\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: min_t1 = -47, max_t1 = -36, s=12\n\nCar B: min_t1 = 25, max_t1 = 36, s=12\n\nAt time T, min_A = -47 + 12*(T-23)\n\nmax_A = -36 + 12*(T-23)\n\nSimilarly min_B = 25 + 12*(T-23)\n\nmax_B = 36 + 12*(T-23)\n\n0 in span for car A if min_A <= 0 <= max_A\n\nSimilarly for car B.\n\nBut since min_A and max_A are negative for small T, and increasing.\n\nFind when car A covers 0.\n\nmin_A <= 0 <= max_A\n\n-47 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <= 3 since integer? ΔT = T-23, integer.\n\nT-23, so ΔT integer.\n\n-47 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 = 3.916, so ΔT <= 3\n\n0 <= -36 + 12ΔT => 12ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo for car A, 0 in span when ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so only at ΔT=3.\n\nΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so ΔT=3.\n\nSimilarly, for car B: min_B <=0<= max_B\n\nmin_B =25 +12ΔT <=0? 25 +12ΔT <=0 is impossible since min_B >=25 >0, so min_B >0 for all ΔT, so 0 <= min_B is false, so 0 never in span for car B, since min_B=25>0 and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, min_A <0 and max_A <0 for small ΔT, but at ΔT=3, min_A = -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11\n\nmax_A = -36 + 36 =0\n\nSo at ΔT=3, min_A=-11, max_A=0, so 0 is included, since max_A=0.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=4, min_A=-47+48=1, max_A=-36+48=12, both >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nAt ΔT=2, min_A=-47+24=-23, max_A=-36+24=-12, both <0.\n\nSo only at T=23+3=26, car A on y=7 covers x=0.\n\nCar B never covers x=0.\n\nSo on freeway 7, collision only at T=26.\n\nNow, player is at y=7 at time t=23.\n\nIf player stays on y=7 at time T, collision only if T=26.\n\nAt time T, when player is on a freeway, collision if at that time, 0 covered.\n\nSo at t=23, player is on y=7, so we need to check if collision at t=23.\n\nAt t=23, for y=7, car A: min=-47, max=-36, both <0, not cover 0.\n\nCar B: min=25, max=36>0, min>0, not cover 0.\n\nSo no collision at t=23 on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if player stays on y=7 at t=24, ΔT=1, min_A=-47+12=-35, max_A=-36+12=-24<0, min_B=25+12=37, max_B=36+12=48>0, min>0, no cover.\n\nt=25: ΔT=2, min_A=-47+24=-23, max_A=-24? max_t1=-36, +24= -12, min_A=-23, both <0.\n\nmin_B=25+24=49, etc. no.\n\nt=26: as above, car A covers 0.\n\nt=27: min_A=1, max_A=12>0, not 0.\n\nSo on y=7, collision only at t=26 if player is there.\n\nNow, player starts at t=23 on y=7, no collision.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, so we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we must pass through y=8 or go directly.\n\ny from 7 to 8 or 6, etc.\n\nSince we need to go up, probably U actions.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on freeway when car covers x=0.\n\nNow, freeway y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, so min_t1=-23, max_t1=-12, s=12\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, min=25, max=36, s=12\n\nAt time T, min1 = -23 + 12ΔT\n\nmax1 = -12 + 12ΔT\n\nmin2 = 25 + 12ΔT\n\nmax2 = 36 + 12ΔT\n\n0 in span for car1 if min1 <=0<= max1\n\n-23 +12ΔT <=0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -23+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so ΔT <=1\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for car1, 0 in span when ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=1, min1=-23+12=-11, max1=-12+12=0, so 0 covered.\n\nAt ΔT=0, min1=-23<0, max1=-12<0, no.\n\nΔT=2, min1=-23+24=1, max1=12>0, min>0, no 0.\n\nFor car2, min2=25>0 always, so never covers 0.\n\nSo on y=8, collision only at T=23+1=24, if player is on y=8 at that time.\n\nNow, freeway y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars, same as 5 and 7? Freeway 6: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12) — same as 5 and 7.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 all have same cars? No.\n\nFreeway 5: (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-36,-47,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: different, (-12,-23,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nAnd freeway 1 to 4 are different.\n\nBut for y=6, same as y=7, cars: car A min=-47, max=-36, s=12; car B min=25, max=36, s=12.\n\nSo at time T, min_A = -47 +12ΔT, max_A = -36 +12ΔT\n\n0 covered when min_A <=0<= max_A\n\n-47+12ΔT <=0 <= -36+12ΔT\n\nΔT <= 47/12≈3.916, ΔT<=3\n\n0 <= -36+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo only at ΔT=3, T=26.\n\nSimilarly, car B never.\n\nSo on y=6, collision only at T=26.\n\nSimilarly for y=5, same cars, so collision only at T=26.\n\nNow freeway y=4: freeway 4 has one car: (30,19,right,6)\n\nSo min_t1=19, max_t1=30, s=6\n\nAt T, min = 19 + 6ΔT\n\nmax = 30 + 6ΔT\n\n0 in span? min=19>0, always min>0, so never covers 0, since min increases from 19.\n\nSimilarly for y=3: same car, (30,19,right,6), min=19>0, never 0.\n\ny=2: same.\n\ny=1: car (-24,-35,right,3)\n\nmin_t1=-35, max_t1=-24, s=3\n\nAt T, min = -35 + 3ΔT\n\nmax = -24 + 3ΔT\n\n0 covered if min <=0<= max\n\n-35 +3ΔT <=0 <= -24 +3ΔT\n\nLeft: -35+3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/3 ≈11.666, ΔT <=11\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +3ΔT => 3ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 11 inclusive.\n\nT = 23 + ΔT, so T=31 to 34.\n\nBut we may not care about that if we don't go to y=1.\n\nNow back to player.\n\nStart at t=23, y=7.\n\nNo collision at t=23 on y=7.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, so we can go up to y=8 or stay or down, but down might not help.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, and we saw that on y=8, collision at t=24 only.\n\nAt t=24, if player on y=8, collision.\n\nBut when does player move to y=8?\n\nAt turn t, player chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAnd at turn t, player is on y_t.\n\nThen after action, at turn t+1, player is on y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at each turn based on current y.\n\nSo at turn T, player on y_T, then check if on freeway (y=1-8), and if so, check cars on that y at time T.\n\nIf y_T not in 1-8, no collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but y=0 might be bottom, but we start from y=7, go to y=9, so probably not go below.\n\ny=0 is allowed, but not necessary.\n\nNow, from y=7 at t=23.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions at t=23: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, then y_{24} = 8\n\nIf D, y_{24}=6\n\nIf S, y_{24}=7\n\nThen at t=24, depending on position.\n\nIf we go up to y=8 at t=24, but at t=24, on y=8, there is collision because on y=8, at t=24, ΔT=1, car covers x=0 as we saw.\n\nt=24 is T=24, t1=23, ΔT=1.\n\nOn y=8 at T=24, collision.\n\nSo if player is on y=8 at turn 24, collision occurs.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=8 at turn 24.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=7 at t=24, no collision, as we saw earlier.\n\nIf we go down to y=6, at t=24 on y=6, is there collision?\n\ny=6 at t=24: ΔT=1, min_A=-47+12= -35, max_A=-36+12=-24<0, min_B=25+12=37>0, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=24: same, safe.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 can be reached from y=8.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at some turn when it's safe, then go up to y=9.\n\nOn y=8, it is only unsafe at t=24, as we saw collision only at t=24.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nFor example, at t=23, on y=8? But player not there yet.\n\nAt t=23, if someone on y=8, but at t=23, ΔT=0, min1=-23, max1=-12<0, min2=25>0, no cover, so safe at t=23.\n\nBut player starts at y=7, so not on y=8 at t=23.\n\nAt t=24, unsafe.\n\nAt t=25, on y=8: ΔT=2, min1=-23+24=1, max1=-12+24=12>0, min>0, so 0 not covered. min2=25+24=49>0, no issue. So safe at t=25.\n\nSimilarly, any other time except t=24.\n\nNow, for y=7, unsafe only at t=26.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=26.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nAt t=23, player at y=7.\n\nOption 1: U to y=8 at t=24.\n\nBut at t=24, if on y=8, collision. So not possible.\n\nIf we do U at t=23, y_{24}=8, and at turn t=24, we are on y=8, which has collision, so we die. Invalid.\n\nOption 2: S at t=23, stay at y=7 at t=24.\n\nAt t=24, on y=7, no collision, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=24, we can choose action.\n\nNow y=7 at t=24, safe.\n\nThen actions: U to y=8 at t=25, or D to y=6, or S.\n\nIf U to y=8 at t=25, then at t=25, on y=8.\n\nAt t=25, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=25, we can go to y=9.\n\nIf at t=25 we are on y=8, and we do U, then y_{26} =9.\n\nAt turn t=25, we are on y=8, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen at t=26, we are on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check, and we have reached y=9.\n\nt=26 is the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=23: at y=7, action S? Or we could do other.\n\nAt t=23: action S, so y_{24} =7\n\nAt t=24: at y=7, action U, so y_{25} =8\n\nAt t=25: at y=8, action U, so y_{26} =9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=23: on y=7, no collision.\n\nAt t=24: on y=7, no collision (as earlier, t=24 ΔT=1, min_A=-35, max_A=-24<0, etc.)\n\nAt t=25: on y=8, which is safe, min1=1, max1=12, min>0, no 0.\n\nThen at t=26: on y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nTotal turns: from t=23 to t=26, we reach at t=26, so H=4? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nt1=23.\n\nAt turn t=23, action a_{23}\n\nThen after H turns, at time t1 + H -1, position is after H actions?

No.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time t, we are at y_t, perform a_t, then at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at position (0,9) at some time T, it means at time T, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, if we have actions from t1 to t1+H-1, that means:\n\nAt time t1, we start, position y_{t1} given.\n\nPerform a_{t1}, then at time t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nPerform a_{t1 + k}, then at time t1 + k +1, position y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nAfter performing H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, the last position is at time t1 + H, y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nBut from above, after actions up to a_{t1 + H -1}, the position at time t1 + H is y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nt is the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, and we perform action a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter performing these actions, the position at time t1+H is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the task says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\", which would be the position before the last action or something.\n\nI think there is confusion.\n\nLook at the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nBut after H actions, we have moved to y_{t1+H}.\n\nFor example, H=1: one action at t1, then after that, at time t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} at H=1 would be y_{t1}, which is not changed.\n\nSo to reach y=9, y_{t1} is 7, not 9.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} =9 means that at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9.\n\nBut with actions from t1 to t1+H-1, at turn t1 + H -1, we perform action a_{t1+H-1}, which affects y_{t1+H}, but y_{t1+H-1} is before that action.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, then we perform a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t, before action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, position becomes y_{t+1} at next turn.\n\nSo for the position to be 9 at turn T, it means at that turn, before any action, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, if we have actions from t1 to t1+H-1, that means we perform actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1, we start at y_{t1}, perform a_{t1}, then go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nAt turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, perform a_{t1+1}, and so on, up to at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}, perform a_{t1+H-1}, then go to y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nIf we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t1+H-1, before performing the action, we are at 9.\n\nBut we may not need to perform an action if we are already at 9.\n\nThe sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1, but if at some point we reach 9, we can stop earlier.\n\nThe minimal H such that after some actions, at some turn, we are at 9.\n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIf we reach at turn t1+K, then y_{t1+K} =9, and we have performed K actions from t1 to t1+K-1.\n\nThen H = K, and sequence t=0 to H-1, i.e. actions at t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9? No.\n\nSet K such that at turn t1+K, y_{t1+K} =9.\n\nTo reach there, we have performed K actions: at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+K-1.\n\nThen at turn t1+K, we are at 9 without performing action yet at that turn.\n\nThen the number of turns H in the sequence is K, actions from t1 to t1+K-1.\n\nAnd at turn t1+K, position is 9.\n\nBut the turn when we are at 9 is t1+K = t1+H.\n\nIn the box, it lists actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nBut the task says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\", which is confusing.\n\nLet's read the task precisely.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nWith the sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, that is actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t1+H is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} is the position at turn t1+H-1, before action a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIf y_{t1+H-1} =9, that means at turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9, and then we perform a_{t1+H-1}, which might move us away, but we need to be at 9 at some point.\n\nThe condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, so we don't care about after.\n\nBut in the sequence, we perform an action at that turn, which could change the position.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" refer to the actions taken, and H is the number of actions.\n\nThen after H actions, the position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThen the sequence is actions for t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, leading to y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAnd the turn when we are at 9 is t1+H.\n\nBut the task says \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\", which is different.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the task description.\n\nLet me see the vertical axis: y=0,1,2,...,9, so 10 rows.\n\nPlayer at (0,7) at turn t1=23.\n\n\"reach (0,9)\"\n\nIn the dynamics, \"at turn T, the position is (0, y_T)\"\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence, with H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, we reach position at turn t1+H.\n\nSo y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nBut the task explicitly says \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, or I misread.\n\nLet me quote:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions... such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIt says y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nBut in that case, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we perform an action a_{t1+H-1} which may move us to y=8 or 10, but y=10 not allowed, so if we are at 9, we can choose S to stay, or U to go to 10, but y=10 not exist, so y_{t+1} must be in 0-9, so from y=9, U is invalid? The move must keep y within bounds.\n\n\"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so from y=9, U is not possible, similarly D from 0 not possible.\n\nFrom y=9, possible actions: D to y=8, or S to y=9.\n\nBut if we are at y=9, and we want to stay, we do S.\n\nBut in the task, if y_{t1+H-1} =9, then we are at 9 at that turn, so we have reached, and we can choose a_{t1+H-1} = S to stay at 9 for the next turn, but the position at that turn is already 9.\n\nThe condition is to be at (0,9) at some turn, so if at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, we have reached.\n\nThen the action at that turn can be S to stay, or D to go down, but if we go down, we leave, but the reach is at that turn.\n\nSince we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we have reached, so the action at that turn can be anything, but to be safe, we might choose S, but it's not necessary for the reach.\n\nBut in the collision avoidance, we need to avoid collision only during the path, but at y=9, no collision.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to specify the actions up to that point.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nIn this case, since we start at y=7, we can reach y=9 in two steps: U at t1, then U at t1+1, to be at y=9 at t1+2.\n\nBut with the cars, it may not be possible due to collision.\n\nIn this scenario, with y_{t1+H-1} =9, for H=2, we need y_{t1+1} =9.\n\ny_{t1+1} =9 means at turn t1+1, we are at 9.\n\nFrom y_{t1} =7, to be at y_{t1+1} =9, we need to go from 7 to 9 in one action, but actions are only +1, -1, 0, so impossible to jump from 7 to 9 in one step.\n\nMinimum two steps: from 7 to 8, then to 9.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at 9 is at t1+2, with two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\nThen for H=2, we need y_{t1+2-1} = y_{t1+1} =9? H=2, t1+H-1 = t1+1, y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nBut from y_{t1} =7, to have y_{t1+1} =9, it requires a_{t1} to increase y by 2, which is not possible. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the interpretation must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of actions, and we need y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThen for H=2, y_{t1+2} =9, which is possible with actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nThen sequence a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}, and at turn t1+2, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in general, with H actions, we reach at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd the task should say y_{t1+H} =9, but it says y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nGiven the contradiction, I think it's a typo, and it should be y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn many such problems, H is the number of moves to reach the state.\n\nI will assume that we need to reach at turn t1+H, with H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn this case, from y=7 to y=9, minimum H=2.\n\nBut with cars, it may take longer.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nAt t=23, y=7.\n\nIf we do U at t=23, then y_{24} =8.\n\nBut at turn t=24, we are on y=8, which has collision at t=24, as we saw. So we collide, invalid.\n\nIf we do S at t=23, y_{24} =7.\n\nAt t=24, on y=7, no collision.\n\nThen at t=24, we can do U, so y_{25} =8.\n\nAt t=25, on y=8, no collision (since only unsafe at t=24).\n\nThen at t=25, we do U, y_{26} =9.\n\nAt t=26, on y=9, done.\n\nSo actions: t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U, reach at t=26.\n\nH=3 actions, reach at t=26.\n\nCan we do it faster?\n\nWith H=2, actions at t=23 and t=24, reach y_{25} =9.\n\nTo have y_{25} =9, from y_{23} =7.\n\nSo we need to increase by 2 in two steps.\n\nPossible sequences: U at t=23 to y=8 at t=24, then U at t=24 to y=9 at t=25.\n\nBut at t=24, when we are on y=8, it must be safe.\n\nBut at t=24, on y=8, collision occurs, as we saw.\n\nIf we do U at t=23 to y=8 at t=24, but at t=24 on y=8, collision, so we cannot be there.\n\nIf we do something else, but we need to go up.\n\nAt t=23, do D to y=6 at t=24, then at t=24 on y=6, safe, but then we are at y=6, need to go to y=9, which takes more steps.\n\nNot faster.\n\nS at t=23 to y=7 at t=24, then U at t=24 to y=8 at t=25, but then at t=25, y=8, and we can go to y=9 at t=26, but we are not at 9 yet.\n\nFor H=2, we need to be at 9 at t=25.\n\nBut from above, the only way is to be at y=8 at t=24, then U to y=9 at t=25.\n\nBut at t=24, we must be on y=8, but it is unsafe at t=24.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach at t=25.\n\nThus minimal H=3, reach at t=26.\n\nNow, in the sequence I have: t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U\n\nBut at t=25: U to y=9, so at t=26 y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=23,24,25.\n\nH=3.\n\nWe could do other sequences, but this works.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=3 but reaching earlier? No, t=26 is earliest possible since t=25 impossible.\n\nt=25 is impossible as above.\n\nNow, but in this sequence, at t=25, we are on y=8 and do U.\n\nBut at t=25, on y=8, is it safe? Yes, as we saw.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? But we only care when we are on them.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 at t=23 and t=24, y=8 at t=25.\n\nAt t=23: y=7, safe.\n\nt=24: y=7, safe? At t=24 on y=7.\n\ny=7 at t=24: ΔT=1, min_A=-47+12= -35, max_A=-24, both negative, min_B=37>0, no 0 covered, safe.\n\nt=25: on y=8, ΔT=2, min1=-23+24=1, max1=12, min>0, no 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nCould we go down? But not necessary.\n\nAnother option: at t=23, do D to y=6 at t=24.\n\nAt t=24, on y=6, safe, since y=6 unsafe only at t=26.\n\nThen at t=24, do U to y=7 at t=25.\n\nThen at t=25, on y=7, now t=25, ΔT=2, min_A=-47+24= -23, max_A=-36+24= -12<0, min_B=25+24=49>0, no cover, safe.\n\nThen at t=25, do U to y=8 at t=26.\n\nBut at t=26, on y=8: ΔT=3, min1=-23+36=13, max1=24>0, min>0, safe.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y=9, so at t=26 do U, to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut this takes longer, H=4 to reach at t=27.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down further, even longer.\n\nSo the first sequence is better.\n\nBut in the first sequence, with H=3, we reach at t=26.\n\nNow, but we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=23, we did S.\n\nBut we could do U if possible, but not.\n\nAnother idea: at t=23, do U to go to y=8 at t=24, but unsafe, so cannot.\n\nPerhaps wait or move to avoid, but no need.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at t=25, we can go directly later.\n\nBut with S at t=23, we are at y=7 at t=24, then U to y=8 at t=25, then U to y=9.\n\nWe could at t=23 do nothing, S, or perhaps D, but D would delay.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions: t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U.\n\nBut at t=25: U to y=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output for each turn.\n\nAlso, for the car on other freeways, but since we don't visit them, no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, for example, if we go to y=6, but we don't.\n\nAnother thing: at t=26, when we reach y=9, but in this sequence we don't care.\n\nBut on the way, we are only on y=7 and y=8 at the times mentioned.\n\ny=7 at t=23 and t=24, both safe.\n\nt=23: on y=7, safe.\n\nt=24: on y=7, safe.\n\nt=25: on y=8, safe.\n\nThen move to y=9.\n\nNow, but the player position is at (0,y), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nCollision only if at that time, on freeway y, and x=0 covered.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have three actions.\n\nBut H=3, number of turns, meaning actions.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 26.\n\nBut the turn in the output is the action turn.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t1=23.\n\nNow, but we have H=3, actions at t=23,24,25.\n\nBut at t=25, action U, to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut according to the task, with H=3, we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{23+3-1} = y_{25} =9?\n\ny_{25} should be 9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 25, before action, y_{25} =8, then we do U, so y_{26}=9.\n\nBut y_{25} =8, not 9.\n\nContradiction with the task requirement.\n\nAh, the problem.\n\nThe task says \"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFor H=3, t1=23, t1+H-1=25, we need y_{25} =9.\n\nBut in reality, from start, we cannot have y_{25} =9 with H=3 actions.\n\ny_{23} =7\n\nAfter a_{23}, y_{24}\n\nAfter a_{24}, y_{25}\n\nAfter a_{25}, y_{26}\n\nTo have y_{25} =9, we need to reach at turn 25.\n\nWith actions at t=23 and t=24 only? H=2 actions for t=23 and t=24, then y_{25} after two actions.\n\nWith H=2, sequence a_{23} and a_{24}, then y_{25} = y_{23} + Δy_{23} + Δy_{24}\n\nTo have y_{25} =9, from y_{23}=7, so Δy_{23} + Δy_{24} =2, so both U, so y_{24} =8, y_{25}=9.\n\nBut y_{24} =8, and at turn 24, we are on y=8, which has collision at t=24.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nIf we do something else, but cannot reach y=9 at t=25.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_{25}=9.\n\nThe earliest possible is y_{26}=9.\n\nFor that, we need y_{t1 + H} =9 with H=3.\n\nBut the task requires y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince y_{25}=9 is impossible, we must have a larger H.\n\nFor example, H=4, then t1+H-1=23+4-1=26, y_{26}=9.\n\nWhich is possible.\n\nThen with H=4, we can have sequence such that y_{26}=9.\n\nFor example, actions: t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U, then at t=26, y=9, but at turn t=26, we are at y=9, so for H=4, we need actions at t=23,24,25,26? t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=4, actions at t=23,24,25,26? t1+H-1=26.\n\nActions at t=23,24,25,26.\n\nBut at t=26, we are already at y=9 if we reached earlier, but in this case, with actions at t=23,24,25, we reach y=9 at t=26.\n\nSo at t=26, we are at y=9, and we can do S to stay.\n\nSo for H=4, we need four actions.\n\nSequence: for example:\n\nt=23: S, so y_{24}=7\n\nt=24: U, so y_{25}=8\n\nt=25: U, so y_{26}=9\n\nAt t=26, we are at y=9, and we need to perform action a_{26}, which can be S, so y_{27}=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1} = y_{23+4-1} = y_{26} =9, which is satisfied.\n\nThen the last action is at t=26, a_{26}=S.\n\nSimilarly, we could have other sequences.\n\nBut minimal H.\n\nWith H=3, we cannot satisfy y_{25}=9.\n\nWith H=4, we can have y_{26}=9.\n\nBut with H=3 actions, we reach at t=26, but for H=3, t1+H-1=25, y_{25} should be 9, but it is 8, not 9.\n\nSo we must use H=4 to have y_{26}=9 with the index.\n\nSince y_{25}=9 is impossible, the minimal H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9 is possible.\n\nFor H=4, y_{26}=9.\n\nFor H=3, y_{25}=9 impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nThen sequence with four actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=23: S, so at t=24 y=7\n\nAt t=24: U, so at t=25 y=8\n\nAt t=25: U, so at t=26 y=9\n\nAt t=26: S, so at t=27 y=9\n\nBut y_{26}=9, which is what we need for t1+H-1=26.\n\nActions: t=23:S, t=24:U, t=25:U, t=26:S\n\nBut at t=26, we are already at y=9, and we do S to stay.\n\nWe could do other actions, but S is fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but we have to since H=4.\n\nAnother sequence: we could go down and up, but longer.\n\nFor example, at t=23: D, to y=6 at t=24\n\nThen t=24: U, to y=7 at t=25\n\nt=25: U, to y=8 at t=26\n\nt=26: U, to y=9 at t=27\n\nBut then y_{26}=8, not 9, and we reach at t=27, so for y_{26}=9 not satisfied, and with H=4, y_{26} should be 9.\n\nIn this case, at t=26 y=8, not 9.\n\nSo only the first sequence with waiting works.\n\nWe can reach at t=26 with actions from t=23 to t=25, but for the sequence, with H=4, we include an extra action at t=26.\n\nBut it's minimal H in terms of the number to satisfy the index.\n\nSince we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9, and we can achieve it at t=26 with H=4.\n\nThe number of actions is 4, but we reached at t=26 with 3 actions, but we add an extra S at t=26 to satisfy the sequence length.\n\nIn terms of turns, it's the same.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns H\" refers to the number of moves, and we need to include until we are at 9.\n\nI think for this problem, since the requirement is explicit, we should follow y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo minimal H such that we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFrom start, at turn 23, y=7.\n\nTurn 24: y=7 or 6 or 8, not 9.\n\nTurn 25: y=6,7,8, or 9 only if from 8 with U at t=24, but cannot be on y=8 at t=24.\n\nSo y=9 impossible at t=25.\n\nTurn 26: possible, for example, from y=8 at t=25 with U at t=25.\n\ny=8 at t=25 is possible, as above.\n\nThen at turn 26, y=9.\n\nSo at turn 26, y=9.\n\nThen t1+H-1 =26, t1=23, so 23 + H -1 =26, thus H-1=3, H=4.\n\n23 + H -1 =26, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nYes.\n\nWith H=4, we can have y_{26}=9.\n\nSequence of actions: for t=23 to t=23+4-1=26, actions a_{23} to a_{26}.\n\nTo have y_{26}=9, we need to arrive at y=9 at turn 26.\n\nThat means, before action at t=26, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we can do a_{26}=S or D, but S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{23}, a_{24}, a_{25} determine y_{26}.\n\ny_{26} depends on a_{25} and y_{25}.\n\nTo have y_{26}=9, we need y_{25}=8 and a_{25}=U, or y_{25}=9 and a_{25}=S, but if y_{25}=9, we are already at 9, but at turn 25 y=9 is impossible, so must have y_{25}=8 and a_{25}=U.\n\nSimilarly, y_{25}=8 must be from previous.\n\nNow, y_{25}=8 at turn 25.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at turn 25.\n\nAt turn 25, position y_{25}=8.\n\nThat means, from t=23, after two actions, at t=25 y=8.\n\nActions at t=23 and t=24.\n\ny_{25} = y_{23} + Δy_{23} + Δy_{24}\n\ny_{23}=7, so to have y_{25}=8, we need Δy_{23} + Δy_{24} =1.\n\nFor example, S then U: y_{24}=7, then U to y_{25}=8\n\nOr U then S: y_{24}=8, then S to y_{25}=8\n\nOr D then U: y_{24}=6, then U to y_{25}=7, not 8.\n\nSo possibilities: (S,U) or (U,S) for (a23,a24)\n\nBut with (U,S): a23=U, so y_{24}=8\n\nBut at turn 24, on y=8, collision, invalid.\n\nTherefore, only (S,U): a23=S, y_{24}=7; a24=U, y_{25}=8\n\nThen at turn 25, y_{25}=8, safe as before.\n\nThen a25=U, so y_{26}=9\n\nThen for the sequence, we have a23=S, a24=U, a25=U\n\nBut H=4, we need four actions, so we need a26.\n\nAt t=26, we are at y=9, so a26 can be S.\n\nThus sequence: t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U, t=26: S\n\nWith this, y_{26}=9.\n\nIf we do a26=D, y27=8, but y26=9 is already satisfied, and we don't care after, but for the action, we need to specify, but to stay safe, S is fine.\n\nNow, in terms of minimal H, H=4 is the minimal possible since H=3 would require y_{25}=9 impossible.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nNow, for the actions, we have the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=25: U, to go to y=9 at t=26.\n\nAnd at t=26: S, to stay.\n\nNow, collision: at t=23: on y=7, safe.\n\nt=24: on y=7, safe.\n\nt=25: on y=8, safe.\n\nt=26: on y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe could have a different sequence, but this is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nCurrent turn t1=23.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states briefly.\n\nAt t=23: y=7, cars on y=7: min A=-47, max A=-36, min B=25, max B=36, x=0 not covered.\n\nt=24: y=7, ΔT=1, min A=-35, max A=-24, min B=37, max B=48, no 0.\n\nt=25: y=8, cars on y=8: min1=-23+12*2= -23+24=1, max1=-12+24=12, min2=25+24=49, max2=36+24=60, so min1=1>0, no 0 covered.\n\nSafe.\n\nt=26: y=9, no issue.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 23\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 4. This is because it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 25 (i.e., \\(y_{25} = 9\\)) due to the collision risk on freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turn 24. The earliest safe arrival at \\(y = 9\\) is at turn 26, which requires \\(H = 4\\) actions to satisfy \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{26} = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 23: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 7\\), which is safe as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) on freeway 7 at turn 23.\n- At turn 24: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 25. Staying at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 24 is safe, and moving to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 25 avoids the collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 24.\n- At turn 25: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 26. Being on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 25 is safe as no car covers \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 26: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the position is already reached and no action is needed, but an action must be specified for the sequence. Staying is safe since \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway.\n\nCollision checks:\n- Turn 23 (\\(y = 7\\)): Cars on freeway 7 have spans \\([-47, -36]\\) and \\([25, 36]\\), neither covers \\(x = 0\\). Safe.\n- Turn 24 (\\(y = 7\\)): After \\(\\Delta T = 1\\), spans are \\([-35, -24]\\) and \\([37, 48]\\), neither covers \\(x = 0\\). Safe.\n- Turn 25 (\\(y = 8\\)): After \\(\\Delta T = 2\\), cars on freeway 8 have spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\), neither covers \\(x = 0\\). Safe.\n- Turn 26 (\\(y = 9\\)): No freeway, no collision possible.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ S} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 24, and the player is at (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways y=1 to y=8 (each row is a freeway). The player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y unchanged). The player can only be at y in [0,9]. The starting y is 7, and we need to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway k (meaning y_T = k, and k between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on freeway k.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on freeway y_T. Only at the next turn (T+1) does the player appear on y_{T+1}. So, if we move from k to k+1 at turn T, then at turn T we are on k and at turn T+1 we are on k+1.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (24). We need to compute the positions of the cars at future turns T (>=24) for each freeway.\n\nCar update:\n- For a car at freeway i, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1.\n- Left-moving: direction left? Actually, the problem says:\n   - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n   - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the given data, the direction is given as \"right\" for all cars. So we assume all cars are right-moving? Actually, the direction is specified: all are \"right\". So we use the right-moving formula.\n\nAlso note: for right-moving, the head is the front (so at t1, the car spans from τ to h, with h>τ). Then at time T, it moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe start at turn 24 at y=7. We can take actions for t = 24, 25, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) to get to y=9. So we want to go from 7 to 9: we need to go up twice? But we must avoid the freeways 7 and 8 at the times we are on them.\n\nBut note: we are currently at freeway 7 at turn 24. So we must check if at turn 24, on freeway 7, is there a car that has 0 in its span?\n\nWe are at (0,7) at turn 24. We must check freeway 7 at turn 24.\n\nFreeway 7: cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nWait, the representation: for a right-moving car, the initial span is [τ, h]. So for the first car: τ=-35, h=-24? Then the car at turn 24 is from -35 to -24? But that does not include 0. Similarly, the second car: τ=37, h=48? Then the car is from 37 to 48? Also not including 0. So at turn 24, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nBut we are at turn 24 at freeway 7: we are safe.\n\nNow, we can plan the next moves.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn 24. We can choose to go U (to 8), D (to 6), or S (stay at 7). We want to get to 9 as fast as possible, so we prefer U.\n\nBut we must check the next freeways at the times we are there.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions for future turns.\n\nLet T = t - t1 = t - 24. So at turn 24, T=0; at turn 25, T=1, etc.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each relative time T (>=0) the set of T when a car on k has 0 in its span.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving, so we need to compute for each freeway the intervals of T (if any) when 0 is covered.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway the time intervals when it is unsafe.\n\nBut note: multiple cars on the same freeway? Yes, for freeways 5,6,7,8 we have two cars.\n\nWe must avoid 0 being in any car's span at the time we are on that freeway.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway the set of T (relative to t1) when 0 is in the span of at least one car.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-21, -32, right, 3) -> but wait, the representation: for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h] = [-32, -21]? Because the problem says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h]. The given is (head, tail, direction) = (-21, -32, right). But note: in the right-moving formula, the head is the front? So if the car is moving right, then the front is at -21 and the tail at -32? Then the span is from -32 (tail) to -21 (head). So at T=0: [-32, -21]. Then at time T (relative), the car moves to [τ + s*T, h + s*T] = [-32 + 3*T, -21 + 3*T].\n\nWe need to know when 0 is in [-32+3T, -21+3T]. So solve:\n  -32 + 3T <= 0 <= -21 + 3T\n=> 3T >= 32 and 3T <= 21? -> wait, 32<=3T<=21? That is impossible. Actually, we have:\n  Lower bound: -32+3T <= 0  => 3T <= 32 => T <= 32/3 ≈ 10.666\n  Upper bound: 0 <= -21+3T => 3T>=21 => T>=7.\n\nSo T in [7, 10.666] -> T integer: T=7,8,9,10.\n\nBut note: the car is on freeway 1. So at relative times T=7,8,9,10 (i.e., turns 24+7=31, 32,33,34) the freeway 1 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (36, 25, right, 6) -> initial span: [25,36]? Because tail=25, head=36? Then at T: [25+6T, 36+6T]. When is 0 in [25+6T, 36+6T]?\n  25+6T <= 0 <= 36+6T -> but 25+6T is positive for T>=0, so never. So freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? The data says: (36,25,right,6) -> same as above. So always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same as above -> safe.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  First car: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> initial span: [-35, -24] -> at T: [-35+12T, -24+12T]\n      Check 0 in [-35+12T, -24+12T]:\n        -35+12T <=0 and 0<=-24+12T\n        => 12T<=35 -> T<=35/12≈2.916\n          12T>=24 -> T>=2\n        So T=2: T=2: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> yes, 0 is the upper bound? The problem says the span is inclusive? We assume inclusive. So at T=2: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes. Also at T=3: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> 1 to 12, 0 not included. So T=2 is unsafe? But wait: T=2: the car is from -11 to 0? Then 0 is included. So T=2 is unsafe.\n\n        Actually: \n          T=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes. \n          T=1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not included.\n          T=3: [1,12] -> not.\n\n        So only T=2.\n\n  Second car: (48,37,right,12) -> initial span: [37,48] -> at T: [37+12T,48+12T]. This is always positive and increasing, so 0 never in it.\n\n  So freeway 5 is unsafe at T=2 (turn 24+2=26).\n\nFreeway 6: same two cars as freeway 5? The data: same as freeway 5: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12). So same: unsafe only at T=2 (turn 26).\n\nFreeway 7: same two cars: unsafe at T=2? \n  First car: [-35+12T, -24+12T] -> T=2: [-11,0] -> 0 included -> unsafe at T=2 (turn 26).\n  Second car: safe.\n\n  So freeway 7 is unsafe at T=2.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway 7 at T=0 (turn24). And at T=0: \n  First car: [-35, -24] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n  Second car: [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo at T=0, safe. But at T=2, unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\n  First car: (head=0, tail=-11, right,12) -> initial span: [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> at T: [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n      Check 0 in this interval? \n        -11+12T <= 0 <= 12T\n        => 12T>=0 -> always true for T>=0? \n        and 0>=-11+12T -> 12T<=11 -> T<=11/12≈0.916 -> so only T=0? \n        At T=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at T=0.\n\n        But note: we are at turn 24 (T=0) and we are at freeway 7, not 8. So we don't care about freeway8 at T=0 for now.\n\n        For T>=1: \n          T=1: [-11+12=1, 12] -> 1 to 12 -> 0 not included.\n          T>=1: safe.\n\n  Second car: same as before, always safe.\n\nSo freeway 8 is unsafe only at T=0? But T=0 is turn24. And we are not on freeway8 at turn24. So for future, freeway8 is safe for T>=1.\n\nBut wait: if we are at freeway8 at turn24 (T=0), that would be unsafe. But we start at freeway7 at turn24.\n\nSo freeway8: unsafe only at T=0? Then for any turn T>=1 (relative T>=1) it is safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times (relative T) for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: T in {7,8,9,10}\nFreeway2: safe always\nFreeway3: safe always\nFreeway4: safe always\nFreeway5: T=2\nFreeway6: T=2\nFreeway7: T=2\nFreeway8: T=0 (but we are not on it at T=0, so for future we care about T>=1: safe)\n\nWe are at y=7 at T=0 (safe). We want to get to y=9.\n\nPossible moves: \n  We can go up to 8, then to 9. That would take 2 moves: at T=0 (turn24): U -> to y8 at turn25? But wait:\n\nTurn24: start at y7. We take an action at turn24. After the action, at the end of turn24, we update:\n  y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy.\n\nSo if we do U at turn24, then at turn25 we are at y8.\n\nBut note: at turn24 we are on freeway7, and we have to check freeway7 at turn24: we did, it's safe.\n\nThen at turn25, we are on freeway8. We must check freeway8 at turn25: relative T=1 (since turn25 = 24+1). And we said freeway8 at T>=1 is safe. So if we do U at turn24, then at turn25 we are at y8 and safe.\n\nThen at turn25, we can do U again to go to y9. At turn26 we are at y9. And y9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so we don't check for cars. So we are safe.\n\nSo sequence: \n  Turn24: U -> to y8 at turn25\n  Turn25: U -> to y9 at turn26\n\nBut we must check the intermediate positions:\n\nAt turn24: we are at y7 -> safe (as we saw).\nAt turn25: we are at y8 -> T=1 -> safe (freeway8 at T=1: safe).\nAt turn26: we are at y9 -> no car check.\n\nSo that's 2 moves? Then H=2? But wait, we are at turn24 at y7. After two actions (turn24 and turn25) we are at turn26 at y9. So the last action is at turn25? Then the sequence is for t=24 and t=25? And H=2.\n\nBut is there a problem? What about freeway7 at turn25? We are not on freeway7 at turn25. And freeway8 at turn25 is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about the move at turn24? When we move from y7 to y8 at turn24, at that turn we are only on y7 (and we checked it's safe at T=0). Then at the next turn (turn25) we are on y8.\n\nSo this seems safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 at T=0: safe. \nFreeway8 at T=1: \n  For freeway8, at T=1: \n    First car: [-11+12*1, 0+12*1] = [1,12] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n    Second car: [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut what about freeway5,6,7 at T=2? At T=2 (turn26) we are at y9, so we don't care.\n\nSo minimal H is 2? \n\nBut wait: the problem says to avoid collisions. And we are safe in this plan.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that we missed.\n\nWe are moving from y7 at turn24 to y8 at turn25. Then from y8 at turn25 to y9 at turn26.\n\nIs there any possibility that we are on a freeway at a time when it is unsafe? Only:\n\n- At turn24 (T=0): we are on y7 -> safe (as computed).\n- At turn25 (T=1): we are on y8 -> safe (as computed).\n\nAnd then at turn26 (T=2): we are on y9 -> no car.\n\nSo H=2, and the actions are:\n  Turn24: U\n  Turn25: U\n\nBut the answer format is for turns starting at t1=24. So:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=2, so t=0 and t=1? That is, actions at turn24 and turn25.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times for freeway7: we have T=2 unsafe. But we are not on freeway7 at T=2? We left at T=0 (turn24) to go to y8 at T=1. So we are never on freeway7 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at T=0 is unsafe, but we are not on freeway8 at T=0.\n\nBut what if we try to go up at turn24? Then at turn25 we are on freeway8. And freeway8 at T=1 is safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem states that we start at (0,7) at turn24. Then we take action at turn24. After the action, we update to the next turn.\n\nSo the plan seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the freeway8 car again: the first car at freeway8 is given as (0, -11, right, 12). So at turn24 (T=0): the car is at [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> unsafe at T=0. But we are not on freeway8 at T=0. Then at T=1: the car moves to [ -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are avoiding by not being on a freeway when a car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut what if we try to go up only once and then stay? That would take more moves. So 2 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: is it possible that we get stuck? Or is there a reason we cannot go up twice?\n\nAnother thing: the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y must be in [0,9]. So going from 7 to 8 is valid, then 8 to 9 is valid.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway8 at turn24? We are not on freeway8 at turn24, so we are safe.\n\nSo I think H=2 is achievable.\n\nBut let me check the state at turn26: we are at y9, which is the goal.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t1=24, so:\n\nt=0: turn24: U\nt=1: turn25: U\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible? We start at y7. To get to y9 in one move? We can only move by +1 per move. So we cannot jump from 7 to 9 in one move. So minimal H is 2.\n\nBut what if we do nothing? We have to move up twice.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\". And we are moving vertically only.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut let me check if at turn24 we do U: then at turn25 we are at y8, which is safe. Then at turn25 we do U: then at turn26 we are at y9.\n\nBut what if we do U at turn24 and then at turn25 we are at y8, but then if we do D? That would be bad. But we are doing U again.\n\nSo the sequence is clear.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions\". We have checked.\n\nBut let me recheck freeway7 at T=0: \n  Cars: (-24,-35,right,12) -> at T=0: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in there? Correct.\n  And (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\nFreeway8 at T=1: \n  (0,-11,right,12) -> at T=1: [-11+12,0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n  (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut why is freeway8 unsafe at T=0? Because the car is exactly at [ -11, 0] at turn24. So if we were on freeway8 at turn24, we would collide. But we are not.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1 + 1: ...\", so:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n\nBut wait, the relative time: at turn24 we do U, then at turn25 we do U, and then at turn26 we are at 9. So we have taken two actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in one turn? Impossible because from 7 to 9 requires two steps.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn26. But the last action is at turn25, which leads to turn26.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns 24 and 25.\n\nBut what if we do a double move? But no, each action is one move.\n\nSo I think that's minimal.\n\nBut let me consider if we have to avoid freeway7 at T=2? But we are leaving freeway7 at T=0, so we are not there at T=2.\n\nBut what if we stay? Then we would be at freeway7 at T=1 and T=2? \n\nAt T=1 for freeway7: \n  First car: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12] -> safe.\n  Second car: [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 at T=1 is safe? Then if we do S at turn24, we stay at y7 at turn25 (T=1). Then at turn25 we can go U to y8 at turn26. Then at turn26 we are at y8? Then we need another U to get to y9 at turn27.\n\nBut that would be H=3: \n  Turn24: S -> at turn25: y7 (safe, T=1: safe)\n  Turn25: U -> at turn26: y8 (T=2: freeway8 at T=2? T=2: freeway8: first car: [-11+24, 0+24]=[13,24] -> safe. \n  Turn26: U -> at turn27: y9.\n\nBut that's 3 moves, which is longer than 2.\n\nAlternatively, if we go up at turn24 to y8 at turn25 (safe), then if we stay at turn25: at turn26 we are still at y8 (T=2: safe as above). Then we go up at turn26 to y9 at turn27: that would be 3 moves.\n\nSo 2 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we go down? That would be even longer.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up at turn24 to y8 at turn25 (safe), and then we go up again at turn25 to y9 at turn26. That's 2 moves.\n\nSo I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 at T=0: safe. \nFreeway8 at T=1: safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut wait: the freeway8 car at T=0 is at [-11,0] -> unsafe. But we are not there at T=0. And at T=1, it moves to [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=2, so t from 0 to 1: \n  t=0: a_{24} = U\n  t=1: a_{25} = U\n\nSo the boxed answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n}\n\nBut the initial turn is 24, and we are to write from turn24 to turn24+H-1. Since H=2, the last action is at turn25 (which is 24+1).\n\nSo that's the minimal.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 24. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Unsafe Times\n- **Freeway 1**: Car at (-21, -32, right, 3).  \n  Span at relative time \\(T\\) (from turn 24): \\([-32 + 3T, -21 + 3T]\\).  \n  Collision at \\(x=0\\) when \\(7 \\leq T \\leq 10\\) (i.e., turns 31 to 34).\n- **Freeway 2**: Car at (36, 25, right, 6).  \n  Span: \\([25 + 6T, 36 + 6T]\\).  \n  No collision possible (all values positive).\n- **Freeway 3**: Car at (36, 25, right, 6).  \n  Identical to Freeway 2; no collision.\n- **Freeway 4**: Car at (36, 25, right, 6).  \n  Identical to Freeway 2; no collision.\n- **Freeway 5**: Cars at (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12).  \n  - First car span: \\([-35 + 12T, -24 + 12T]\\). Collision at \\(T = 2\\) (turn 26).  \n  - Second car span: \\([37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\\).

Collision at \\(T = 0\\) (turn 24).  \n  - Second car span: \\([37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\\). No collision.  \n  Unsafe at \\(T = 0\\), safe for \\(T \\geq 1\\).\n\n### Path to Goal\nThe player is at y = 7 at turn 24 (relative \\(T = 0\\)). The goal is to reach y = 9.  \n- From y = 7, moving up (U) increases y by 1 per turn.  \n- The minimal path requires two upward moves: from 7 → 8 → 9.  \n\n**Safety Check**:  \n- **Turn 24 (\\(T = 0\\))**:\n  - Start at y = 7. Freeway 7 at \\(T = 0\\):  \n    - Car 1: span \\([-35, -24]\\) (0 not included).  \n    - Car 2: span \\([37, 48]\\) (0 not included).  \n    Safe to be on y = 7.\n  - Action: U → player moves to y = 8 at turn 25.\n- **Turn 25 (\\(T = 1\\))**:\n  - Now at y = 8. Freeway 8 at \\(T = 1\\):  \n    - Car 1: span \\([-11 + 12 \\times 1, 0 + 12 \\times 1] = [1, 12]\\) (0 not included).  \n    - Car 2: span \\([37 + 12, 48 + 12] = [49, 60]\\) (0 not included).  \n    Safe to be on y = 8.\n  - Action: U → player moves to y = 9 at turn 26.\n- **Turn 26 (\\(T = 2\\))**:\n  - At y = 9, which is not a freeway (no cars). Goal reached.\n\nThis path takes 2 turns (actions at turns 24 and 25). No shorter path is possible, as moving from y = 7 to y = 9 requires at least two upward moves. Alternative paths (e.g., staying or moving down) would require more turns.\n\n### Minimal Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence of actions for turns 24 and 25 is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) on turn t1 = 25. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes 0 at that turn. The key point is that when you move to a new y-position, you're only considered on that freeway at the next turn. So, if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you are on y+1 at turn T+1, not at turn T.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at turn T.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move, you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position is given as (x, y), but x is always 0, I think, since it's a vertical axis, and cars are on horizontal freeways. The grid has vertical axis y, but the cars are moving horizontally on freeways at fixed y levels. The player is at x=0, and moves vertically between y-levels.\n\nThe collision is when the player is at (0, y) for some y between 1 and 8, and at that turn, for the freeway y, there is a car whose span includes x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving left or right, and their spans are given in terms of head and tail positions.\n\nFor each car, at turn t1, we have head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T, the span changes based on direction.\n\nLeft-moving: span moves left, so head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nRight-moving: span moves right, so head increases, tail increases.\n\nThe span is a continuous interval, I assume, and we need to see if 0 is in that interval at turn T.\n\nAlso, for multiple cars on a freeway, if any car has 0 in its span at turn T, and player is on that y, collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=8 on turn t1=25.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are no cars on y=9, since freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so once at y=9, no cars, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe or not, but we're going to y=9, so down might not be useful, but could be to avoid cars.\n\nSince we start at y=8, and need to go to y=9, which is only one step up, but we have to consider the cars on the way.\n\nBut when we move from y=8 to y=9, at the turn we move, say turn T, we are at y=8 during turn T, and if we move U, at turn T+1 we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn T, when we are on y=8, we need to not collide with cars on y=8 at that turn.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo potentially, we could go up immediately if it's safe at turn t1 on y=8.\n\nBut let's check the car state for y=8.\n\nFirst, list the car state for each freeway at turn t1=25.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor k=1: car: (-18, -29, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so right-moving.\n\nSince right-moving, head should be greater than tail? In the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nLet me see the update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut in the description, for left-moving, it's (h, τ) with h and τ, and span [h, τ], so probably head and tail are such that for left-moving, h is the front, which is left, so h < τ? I need to clarify.\n\nLook at the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so both decrease.\n\nBut if it's moving left, and span is [h, τ], with h and τ, if moving left, h should be the left end, so h < τ, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, I think? The notation says for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ and h, with τ < h, since it's [τ, h].\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail), so I need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nIn the car state:\n\nFor k=1: (-18, -29, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, the span should be [tail, head] or something.\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head? But in the input, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so (h, τ, d, s)\n\nFor k=1: h = -18, τ = -29, d=right, s=3\n\nSince d=right, and right-moving span is [τ, h] with τ < h? Here τ = -29, h = -18, so τ = -29 < h = -18, so span is [τ, h] = [-29, -18], which is from left to right, but since it's moving right, the head is at the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h left, τ right, h < τ.\n\nBut here all directions are right, I think, except let's see.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nk=1: (-18, -29, right, 3) so h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=3. Since d=right, span is [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nAt turn t1=25.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: (42, 31, right, 6) h=42, τ=31, d=right, s=6. τ=31, h=42, τ < h, so span [31,42]\n\nk=3: same as k=2? (42,31,right,6) same as k=2.\n\nk=4: (42,31,right,6) same.\n\nk=5: (-12,-23,right,12), and (60,49,right,12) two cars.\n\nSimilarly k=6: same as k=5.\n\nk=7: same as k=5.\n\nk=8: (12,1,right,12), and (60,49,right,12)\n\nNow for each, since all right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] for each car.\n\nNow we need to find for each freeway, at which turns a car has 0 in its span.\n\nBecause collision occurs if at turn T, player is on y=k, and for freeway k, 0 is in some car's span at T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=8 on turn t1=25.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H could be 1, if we can move up immediately at turn t1.\n\nBut we need to check if at turn t1=25, on y=8, is it safe?\n\nFreeway y=8 has cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=12) so span at t1: [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nSecond car: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12), span [49,60]\n\nNow at turn T, for a car, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving.\n\nt1=25.\n\nFor first car on y=8: τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nAt turn T, position: tail_T = 1 + 12*(T-25)\n\nHead_T = 12 + 12*(T-25)\n\nSimilarly for second car: tail_T = 49 + 12*(T-25), head_T = 60 + 12*(T-25)\n\n0 is in span if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T for some car.\n\nFor first car: 0 in [1 + 12(T-25), 12 + 12(T-25)]\n\nSet low = 1 + 12(T-25), high = 12 + 12(T-25)\n\n0 >= low and 0 <= high\n\nSimilarly for second car.\n\nBut let's find when 0 is in the interval.\n\nFor first car: low <= 0 <= high\n\n1 + 12(T-25) <= 0 <= 12 + 12(T-25)\n\nFirst inequality: 1 + 12(T-25) <= 0 => 12(T-25) <= -1 => T-25 <= -1/12, since T integer, T-25 <= -1? -1/12 ≈ -0.083, so T-25 <= -1 because T integer, T-25 <= -1 => T <= 24\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 12 + 12(T-25) => 0 <= 12(1 + (T-25)) always true for T>=0, but let's see.\n\n0 <= 12 + 12(T-25) => -12 <= 12(T-25) => -1 <= T-25 => T >= 24\n\nNow, low <= 0: 1 + 12(T-25) <= 0\n\n12(T-25) <= -1\n\nT-25 <= -1/12\n\nSince T integer, T-25 <= -1? -1/12 ≈ -0.083, so T-25 <= -1 because if T-25 = 0, 1+0=1>0, not <=0; T-25=-1, 1 +12*(-1)=1-12=-11<=0; T-25=-2, 1-24=-23<=0, etc.\n\nT-25 <= -1 implies T <= 24\n\nAnd 0 <= high: 0 <= 12 + 12(T-25) => 12(T-25) >= -12 => T-25 >= -1 => T >= 24\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span when T <= 24 and T >= 24, so only at T=24.\n\nT=24: low = 1 +12(24-25)=1 +12*(-1)=1-12=-11 <=0\n\nHigh =12 +12*(-1)=12-12=0, so 0 <=0, which is included, so yes, 0 in [-11,0] at T=24.\n\nAt T=25, low =1 +12(0)=1, high=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for second car: τ=49, h=60, s=12\n\ntail_T =49 +12(T-25)\n\nhead_T=60 +12(T-25)\n\n0 in span if 49 +12(T-25) <=0 <=60 +12(T-25)\n\n49 +12(T-25) <=0 => 12(T-25) <= -49 => T-25 <= -49/12 ≈ -4.083, so T-25 <= -5? -49/12 = -4.083, so T-25 <= -5 since integer? T-25 <= -4.083, so T <= 25 - 4.083 = 20.917, so T <= 20\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=60 +12(T-25) always for T large, but 0 <=60 +12(T-25) => 12(T-25) >= -60 => T-25 >= -5 => T >=20\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span when T <=20 and T>=20, so T=20.\n\nAt T=20, tail=49+12(20-25)=49+12(-5)=49-60=-11, head=60-60=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo for freeway y=8, at turn T=24, first car has 0 in span; at T=20, second car has 0 in span.\n\nBut at T=25, no car has 0 in span, since first car [1,12], second [49,60], both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn t1=25, on y=8, it is safe, no collision.\n\nTherefore, player can move up immediately: action U at turn t1=25.\n\nThen at turn t1+1=26, player is at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nH=1 turn? Sequence: at t= t1, action U.\n\nThen position: at turn t1, after action, y becomes y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which sets Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check the cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=25, player is at y=8.\n\nWe check if on freeway 8, at T=25, is there a car with 0 in span? As above, no.\n\nThen we can choose action a_{t1} = U.\n\nThen y_{26} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt turn 26, player is at y=9, which is not a freeway, no cars, so no collision, and we have reached (0,9).\n\nSo H=1, action sequence: only one action at turn t1=25: U.\n\nBut is that correct? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but here t starts from t1.\n\nThe action sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=1, t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{25}\n\nThen after that, at turn t1 + H = 26, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the player position, after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: I think H is the number of actions taken.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the dynamics: after action at turn t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to reach y=9, we need y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1} =8.\n\nAfter action at t1, y_{t1+1} set.\n\nIf we do nothing, H=0, but y_{t1} =8 ≠9, so we need at least one action to move to y=9.\n\nWith H=1, we can go to y=9 at turn t1+1=26.\n\nAnd at turn t1=25, on y=8, it is safe as we saw.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions at T=25 for y=8.\n\nCars: first [1,12], 0 not in; second [49,60], 0 not in. Yes.\n\nMoreover, for other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at turn 25, and moving directly to y=9, we don't care about other freeways.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if we were to stay or move down, but we don't need to.\n\nThe problem is to minimize H, so H=1 should be possible.\n\nBut let me check if y=9 is reachable directly.\n\ny=9 is the target, and no cars there, so yes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 25, moving up is safe, which it is.\n\nBut the car state has multiple cars, but for y=8, at T=25, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the freeway.\n\nk=8 is y=8, yes.\n\nIn the input, for k=8, cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt T=25, span [1+0,12+0] = [1,12] and [49,60], both away from 0.\n\nOnly at T=24 and T=20 they cover 0, but not at 25.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, with action U at turn 25.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if there is any trick.\n\nThe player starts at (0,8), and we need to reach (0,9), which is directly above.\n\nAnd since no car at y=8 at turn 25, we can go up.\n\nBut what about the action? When we move up, at turn 25, we perform U, so Δy = +1, so y_{26} =8+1=9.\n\nAt turn 25, during the turn, we are on y=8, and since we move, we leave y=8 and go to y=9 at turn 26.\n\nNo collision at turn 25.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving to y=9 could have issue, but y=9 has no freeway, so safe.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, just in case.\n\nFor example, suppose we couldn't go directly, but here we can.\n\nPerhaps for k=8, the cars are moving, but at T=25, fine.\n\nMaybe I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in this case H=1.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car update.\n\nt1=25.\n\nFor car on y=8, first car: at T=25, position: since s=12, right-moving, span [1 +12*(25-25), 12 +12*0] = [1,12]\n\nSimilarly second [49,60]\n\n0 not in [1,12] or [49,60], so no collision if on y=8 at T=25.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, action at turn 25: U.\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=0 to H-1, so only one action.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} so Turn 25: U\n\nThen done.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut let me see if H could be 0, but no, we are at y=8, not y=9.\n\nSo minimal H is 1.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), need to reach (0,9), so must move up at some point.\n\nAnd since we can do it now, why not.\n\nPerhaps there is a car coming, but not at this turn.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, we are only on one y per turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 or others, but we don't go there.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nBut let me check the initial position: player at (0,8), turn t1=25.\n\nGoal (0,9).\n\nCar on y=8 at T=25: no car at x=0.\n\nSo we can move up immediately.\n\nThus, the sequence is just one action: at turn 25, U.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} }\n\nIn this case, Turn 25: U\n\nBut since t1 is given, we write Turn 25: U\n\nIn the sequence, it might be multiple, but here only one.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify H, but the box should contain the actions.\n\nThe answer format is: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nFor H=1, only Turn t_1: U\n\nThen after that, at turn t1+1, position is (0,9).\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the car state for other freeways, in case we need to pass through, but we don't.\n\nSuppose we couldn't go directly, what would we do.\n\nFor example, if at turn 25, y=8 was not safe, we might need to wait or move down.\n\nBut here it is safe.\n\nPerhaps for k=8, the car (12,1,right,12), at T=25, [1,12], so x=0 not covered, but x=1 to 12 covered, but 0 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother point: the note says that if you move to a different y, you are not on that y until next turn.\n\nBut here, we are moving to y=9, which has no cars, so even if we were on it at turn 25, but we are not, since we move at turn 25, we arrive at turn 26.\n\nAt turn 26, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFor k=5,6,7, there are cars, but we are not on those y-levels.\n\nk=5 has cars at y=5, but we start at y=8, go to y=9, not passing through others.\n\nUnless we move down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo no need.\n\nPerhaps I misread the freeway indices.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8, y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer at y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 1, with action U at turn 25.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Turn } 25: U}\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so we write the turn number.\n\nSince t1=25, we write Turn 25: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if we can reach faster or something, but H=1 is the minimum possible.\n\nIf we do nothing, we stay at y=8, not y=9.\n\nSo must take at least one action.\n\nTherefore.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) on turn 25. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8.\n\nAt turn 25, the player is on freeway y = 8. The car state for freeway 8 is:\n- Car 1: head = 12, tail = 1, direction = right, speed = 12\n- Car 2: head = 60, tail = 49, direction = right, speed = 12\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at turn T is given by:\n- Span(T) = [tail + s(T - t1), head + s(T - t1)]\n\nAt turn 25 (T = 25, t1 = 25):\n- For car 1: span = [1 + 12(25 - 25), 12 + 12(25 - 25)] = [1, 12]\n- For car 2: span = [49 + 12(25 - 25), 60 + 12(25 - 25)] = [49, 60]\n\nThe value 0 is not in [1, 12] or [49, 60], so no collision occurs on freeway 8 at turn 25. Therefore, the player can safely move up to y = 9.\n\nAction at turn 25: U (move up). After this action:\n- At turn 26, y = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nPosition (0, 9) is reached at turn 26, and since y = 9 has no freeway (cars only on y = 1 to 8), it is safe. The minimal number of turns H is 1, as only one action is needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 25: U\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Turn } 25: U}",
