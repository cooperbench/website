        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,0) and need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns. The player moves vertically (y-axis from 0 to 9) and we must avoid collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which are at y=1 to y=8). \n\nImportant: \n- The player updates position at each turn by choosing an action: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay: y unchanged). The y coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which corresponds to y=k) at turn T and the car on that freeway at turn T has its span covering the x-coordinate 0 (since the player is at (0, y)).\n\nNote: The player is on a freeway at turn T if their y-coordinate at the end of turn T (i.e., at time T) is that freeway. Importantly, if the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T they are still on y_T and only at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So when moving, we only check the current freeway (at the start of the turn) for collision during that turn.\n\nCar movement:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t1) at time T (from initial time t1).\n- Right-moving: the car moves right, so the entire span shifts right by s*(T-t1).\n\nIn the given state, note that all cars are moving right. The car state is given for freeways 1 to 8 at the initial turn t1 (which is 0). We need to compute the car's position at any future turn T (relative to t1=0, so T is the number of turns after the initial).\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions from turn 0 (t1=0) to turn H-1 such that at the end of turn H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nApproach:\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path. The state in BFS will be (turn, y) but note that the turn number matters because the car positions change with time. However, we must avoid states that lead to collisions.\n\nBut note: the problem is defined for a fixed initial state of the cars and then they move deterministically. So at any turn T (starting from T=0), we can compute the car positions for freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 0: (0,0). Our goal is to have y=9 at some turn.\n\nConstraints:\n- y must be in [0,9]. If we are at y=0 and try to go down, we stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9 and going up, we stay at 9.\n\nCollision check:\nAt turn T, the player is at y-coordinate = y_T. If y_T is 0 or 9, there are no cars (cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). So we only check for collisions if 1<= y_T <=8.\n\nFor a freeway k (which the player is on at turn T), we look at the car on that freeway (there is one car per freeway). The car's position at turn T (from initial state at turn 0) is computed as:\n\nSince the car is moving right (all are right-moving in this problem), the car's span at turn T is:\n  initial_head + s * T, initial_tail + s * T\n\nBut note: the initial state for each car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, the initial span is from tail to head? Actually, the problem says:\n  Right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12). So head=48, tail=37? Then the initial span is [37,48] (since tail is 37 and head is 48). Then at turn T, the span becomes [37+12*T, 48+12*T].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> initial span [-59,-48] and then at turn T: [-59+6*T, -48+6*T].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if 0 is in the span of the car on the freeway k (which is the player's y_T) at that turn.\n\nSo at turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is k, a freeway between 1 and 8), then we check if 0 is in [tail + s*T, head + s*T] for the car on freeway k.\n\nWe note that the car on freeway k is the one listed in the table for that k.\n\nPlan:\nWe will simulate from turn 0 onwards. We start at (0,0) at turn 0. We are not on a freeway (since y=0) so no collision.\n\nWe consider the next actions: U, D, S. But note: at turn 0, we are at y=0. We can:\n- U: then at turn 1, we go to y=1 -> then we must check at turn 0: we are at y=0 (so no collision at turn0) and then at turn1 we are at y=1 -> so we check freeway1 at turn1: [37+12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n- D: stay at y=0 -> then at turn1 we are still at y=0 -> safe.\n- S: same as D? Actually, at y=0, D would try to go to y=-1 but then we clamp to 0. So same as S.\n\nBut note: we must reach y=9. So we need to go up.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collisions at every turn. We can try to move up as fast as possible, but we have to check each freeway at the turn we are on it.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nState: (time, y) where time = turn number (starting from 0) and y is the vertical position.\n\nWe start at (0,0). Goal: any state (T,9) for some T.\n\nAt each state (t,y), we consider next actions: U, D, S -> leading to next y' and time t+1.\n\nBut note: when we are at (t,y) and take an action, we move to (t+1, y') and then we check for collision at time t+1? Actually, no:\n\nThe collision check is for the turn we are in. Specifically, at turn t, we are at y (which was set at the end of the previous turn, or initially at turn0). Then we choose an action. Then during the turn, we are on freeway y at turn t? Actually, the problem says:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-coordinate at turn T. How is y_T defined? From the update: at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then at the same turn T, the car positions are computed for that turn. Then we check if the player is on a freeway (1<=y_T<=8) and if the car on freeway y_T has a span that includes 0.\n\nSo when we are at state (t, y), that means at turn t, the player is at y. Then we must check: if y is between 1 and 8, then we look at the car on freeway y at turn t. If 0 is in the car's span at turn t, then we have a collision and this state is invalid.\n\nBut note: we are starting at (0,0): 0 is not between 1 and 8 -> safe.\n\nThen we choose an action for turn t. This action will update the player's position to y_{t+1} = y + delta, and then at turn t+1, we will be at (t+1, y_{t+1}) and then we check collision at turn t+1.\n\nSo the collision check is done at the state we are in at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem states: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T) and then we check for collision on freeway y_T at that turn T. So when we are in state (t,y), we must check for collision at that turn t. Only if it is safe, we can then take an action to go to the next state.\n\nTherefore, in our BFS:\n\n- When we first reach a state (t,y), we check:\n   if 1<= y <=8: then compute the car on freeway y at turn t and check if 0 is in the car's span at turn t. If yes, then this state is invalid and we skip.\n   if y=0 or y=9: safe.\n\nThen, from a valid state (t,y), we generate the next states (t+1, y') for y' in {y-1, y, y+1} (clamped to [0,9]). But note: the action we take at turn t will lead to y_{t+1} = y + delta, and then at turn t+1 we will be at (t+1, y_{t+1}) and then we must check collision at turn t+1 (which we do when we visit that state).\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nLet Q be a queue. We start with (0,0) and mark visited[time][y] to avoid revisiting the same state at the same time? But note: it is possible to be at the same y at a later time? Actually, we are minimizing time, so we don't want to revisit a state with a higher or equal time? But since we are doing BFS by time (each step increases time by 1), we can break when we find the goal.\n\nHowever, we might have cycles? But we are looking for the minimal H. Since we are doing BFS by time, we can set a visited array for (t,y) to avoid processing the same state twice? But note: we might come to the same y at a later time and that might be necessary? Actually, no: because if we are at y at time t and we have a path that gets to y at time t' > t, then that path is not shorter. So we can mark visited[y] at a given time? But we are increasing time. Alternatively, we can do:\n\nWe do BFS level by level (by time). We start at time0: (0,0). Then time1: from (0,0) we can go to (1,0) [by D or S] or (1,1) [by U]. Then at time1, we check the states: (1,0) -> safe (y=0) and (1,1) -> check freeway1 at time1: [37+12*1, 48+12*1] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen we continue.\n\nBut note: we must avoid states that we have already visited at an earlier time? Actually, we are doing BFS by time, so we consider each time step in order. Since we are looking for minimal time, we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nBut we might have multiple ways to reach the same (t,y). We can use a visited set: if we have visited (y) at time t, then we skip. But since we are doing BFS in increasing t, we can store for each y the minimal time we have reached it? Actually, we don't care about non-minimal time. So we can mark visited[y] at time t? However, we might come to the same y at a later time and that might be necessary if the earlier path leads to a dead end? But in this problem, we can always wait (by using S) so we can avoid dead ends by waiting? Therefore, we might need to consider states at different times.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with time. So a state (y,t) is unique. We cannot skip a state (y,t) just because we have visited (y) at a different time. So we must store state as (t,y). However, the state space is: t in [0, ...] and y in [0,9]. We can set a 2D visited array: visited[t][y] for t up to a limit. But what limit? We don't know H. But we can set a large enough T_max? Since the cars move, we might need to wait until a car passes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Dijkstra (with time as cost) but all steps cost 1, so BFS by time is fine.\n\nWe'll simulate until we reach y=9. Since we are going from 0 to 9 and we can only move one step per turn (or stay), the minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we might have to wait sometimes? So we might have more than 9 turns.\n\nWe'll set a maximum time to avoid infinite loops. Since the cars move and eventually the cars on the freeways might move away, we can set a large T_max, say 100.\n\nSteps:\n\nInitialize:\n   queue: [(0,0, [])]   # (time, y, path) where path is the list of actions taken so far (for turns 0 to time-1)\n   visited = set()       # we will store (time, y)\n\nWhile queue not empty:\n   pop the state (t, y, path)\n   if y == 9: then we have found a path of length t (because we started at turn0 and after t turns we are at turn t, but note: we have taken t actions? Actually, at turn0 we are at (0,0) and we haven't taken any action. Then at turn0 we take an action that will update to turn1? \n\nWait, the problem says: we are to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... up to H-1? And we start at turn t1=0. Then we need H turns? Actually, the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1 such that after H turns we are at (0,9). So at turn0 we take the first action, then at turn1 we take the second, ... and after H actions, we are at turn H and y_H=9.\n\nIn our BFS, at time t (which is the current turn, we have taken t actions). We start at t=0, y0=0. Then we are about to take the first action (for turn0). Then after taking the action, we move to time t+1 and the next state.\n\nBut in the state (t,y): we are at turn t, and we have to take an action for turn t. Then we go to turn t+1 with y_{t+1} = y + delta.\n\nSo when we are at (t,y), we are at the beginning of turn t? Actually, the problem says: at turn t1 (which is 0) we start at (0,0). Then we take an action a_{t1} (a0) to get to y1 at turn1? But the problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where the action a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t and then we get y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nBut the collision check is at turn t: we check the car on freeway y_t at turn t. So when we are at state (t, y_t), we must check collision at turn t for freeway y_t? But note: at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take an action and then we are at y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nSo the collision check at turn t is done at the state (t, y_t). Therefore, we must check state (t, y_t) for collision. If it is safe, then we can choose an action.\n\nTherefore, in BFS:\n\n   We start at (0,0) -> check collision at turn0: y0=0 -> safe. Then we can take actions for turn0.\n\n   Then we generate next states: (1, y1) where y1 can be 0 (if D or S) or 1 (if U).\n\n   Then at state (1, y1): we check collision at turn1: if y1 is between 1 and 8, then check the car on freeway y1 at turn1.\n\nBut note: the car positions at turn t are computed from the initial state at turn0: for a car on freeway k, the span at turn t is [initial_tail + s*t, initial_head + s*t] (for right-moving).\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k and at each time t (if needed) the car's span.\n\nWe'll simulate until we get to y=9.\n\nLet's code the car spans for each freeway at time t:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> at time t: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\nFreeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at time t: [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? (-48,-59,right,6) -> same: [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\nFreeway 4: same\nFreeway 5: same\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36) -> [-83+36*t, -48+36*t]\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48) -> [-95+48*t, -48+48*t]\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7: [-95+48*t, -48+48*t]\n\nNow, we want to avoid being at freeway k at time t when 0 is in the interval [L, R] for that car.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nLet's set up a queue. We start at (t=0, y=0) with no actions taken. Then we will generate next states for t=1.\n\nBut note: at turn0, we are at (0,0) -> safe. Then we choose an action for turn0: \n   a0 = U -> then y1 = 0+1 = 1 -> state (1,1)\n   a0 = D -> then y1 = max(0,0-1)=0 -> state (1,0)\n   a0 = S -> then y1 = 0 -> state (1,0)\n\nSo we have two states: (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nCheck (1,0): y=0 -> safe.\nCheck (1,1): freeway1 at time1: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen from (1,0): \n   a1 = U -> y2=1 -> state (2,1)\n   a1 = D -> y2=0 -> state (2,0)\n   a1 = S -> y2=0 -> state (2,0)\n\nFrom (1,1):\n   a1 = U -> y2=2 -> state (2,2)\n   a1 = D -> y2=0 -> state (2,0)\n   a1 = S -> y2=1 -> state (2,1)\n\nThen we check state (2,0): safe (y=0)\nstate (2,1): freeway1 at time2: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\nstate (2,2): freeway2 at time2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nWe continue until we get to y=9.\n\nBut we must avoid repeated states with the same (t,y) so we mark visited: (t,y).\n\nWe are looking for minimal H. The state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t? Actually, we are storing the state after the action of the previous turn? \n\nClarification: \n   At turn0: we start at (0,0) -> then we take an action a0 -> then we are at state (1,y1) meaning at the beginning of turn1 we are at y1.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn H? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and we are to output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action and then we are at (0,9) at the next turn? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\" such that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). So at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at (0,9). But the problem does not require that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of the turn? It says \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nActually, the player update: after taking action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1}. So to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn H, we must have taken H actions: from turn0 to turn H-1. Then at turn H, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and a sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1. Then H is the total number of turns we take actions? Then the time at the end is H? \n\nIn our BFS, we are storing the time as the current turn index (the next action we take will be for that turn). But we started at turn0. So when we are at state (t,y), we have taken t actions? Then we are at the beginning of turn t? Actually, we are at the state at the beginning of turn t? \n\nBut the initial state is given at turn0: (0,0). Then we take action at turn0 -> then we are at turn1. So the state (t,y) means: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. And we have taken t actions? Actually, we have taken t actions: the first action at turn0, the second at turn1, ... the t-th action at turn t-1. Then at turn t (the beginning) we are at y. Then we are about to take the next action? \n\nBut the problem says: we start at turn0. Then we take an action at turn0 to get to y1 at turn1. So at turn0 we are at y0=0. Then we take a0 -> then at turn1 we are at y1. \n\nTherefore, the state at the beginning of turn0 is (0,0). Then we take an action. Then the state at the beginning of turn1 is (1, y1). \n\nSo in BFS, we are storing the state at the beginning of a turn. We start at (0,0). Then we consider the actions we take at that turn (which will lead to the state at the next turn).\n\nSo the goal is to be at state (H,9) for some H. Then we have taken H actions (at turn0 to turn H-1). \n\nTherefore, we want to find the minimal H such that we have a state (H,9) that we can reach.\n\nIn the BFS, we stop when we find a state (t,9) for any t. Then H = t? Then the sequence of actions is the path from (0,0) to (t,9) which has t actions (one per turn from turn0 to turn t-1). But note: the state (t,9) is at the beginning of turn t. We don't need to take an action at turn t? \n\nBut the problem says: we need to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. And we are starting at t1=0. So we output actions for turns 0 to H-1. Then the state at turn H is (0,9). \n\nTherefore, in our BFS, when we generate a state (t,y), we are at the beginning of turn t. We are going to take an action at turn t? Actually, no: we have just arrived at the beginning of turn t. Then we take an action at turn t to move to turn t+1.\n\nBut in our BFS, we are storing the state at the beginning of the turn. Then we generate the next state at the beginning of the next turn by applying an action.\n\nSo the goal state is (t,9) for any t. Then we have taken t actions? Actually, we have taken t actions: \n   action0 at turn0 -> state (1,y1)\n   action1 at turn1 -> state (2,y2)\n   ...\n   action_{t-1} at turn t-1 -> state (t,9)\n\nSo the number of actions is t, and H = t. \n\nTherefore, we want the minimal t such that we can reach (t,9).\n\nSo we do BFS until we hit (t,9) for the first time (minimal t).\n\nNow, let's run the BFS. We'll use a queue that stores (t, y) and the path (list of actions taken so far, which is of length t). We also mark visited states (t,y) to avoid duplicates.\n\nWe'll set a maximum t, say 100, to avoid infinite loops.\n\nBut note: we can get stuck? Actually, we can always stay at y=0 by doing S or D. But we want to go to y=9. So we must go up.\n\nWe'll simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll create a visited set: we mark (t,y) as visited to avoid processing the same state again.\n\nBut note: the same y at a later time t might be necessary? For example, if at time t1 we are at y and then we wait and at time t2 we are at y again, but the car positions have changed. So we must consider the time. So we store (t,y).\n\nGiven that t will be at least 9 and we set a max_t=100, we can do:\n\nInitialize:\n   queue = deque([(0,0,[])])   # (current_turn, current_y, actions_so_far)\n   visited = set()              # store (t,y)\n\n   while queue:\n        pop state (t, y, path)\n        if y==9: then we output the path (which has t actions) and H = t (the number of actions) -> then we break.\n\n        Otherwise, we mark (t,y) as visited.\n\n        Then for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n            compute next_y = y + delta\n                if U: next_y = y+1 (if y<9, else 9? Actually, the update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and then clamped to [0,9]. So if y=9 and U, then next_y=9. Similarly, if y=0 and D, then next_y=0.\n\n            Then next_t = t+1\n\n            Then we have state (next_t, next_y)\n\n            Now, we must check if (next_t, next_y) has been visited? If not, then we check collision at turn next_t? Actually, no: the collision check is for the state (next_t, next_y). But note: we are going to be at (next_t, next_y) at the beginning of turn next_t. So we check:\n\n               if next_y is between 1 and 8: then we check the car on freeway next_y at time next_t (which is the turn index).\n               else: safe.\n\n            If the state (next_t, next_y) is safe, then we push it to the queue: (next_t, next_y, path + [action])\n\n        We do this for all three actions.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t, we are at (t,y). Then we take an action to go to (t+1, next_y). Then the collision check at turn t+1 is for the state (t+1, next_y). So we don't check the current state (t,y) again? Actually, we did check it when we first arrived at (t,y) at the beginning of turn t? But we didn't check it at that time? \n\nWait: when we arrive at state (t,y) at the beginning of turn t, we must check for collision at turn t? But we haven't done that in our BFS. We only check the next state? \n\nWe must check the current state (t,y) when we pop it? Because we are at the beginning of turn t and we are about to take an action. But the collision at turn t is already determined by being at (t,y). So we must check the state (t,y) for collision at turn t. If it is not safe, then we cannot take any action from this state? \n\nBut in our BFS, we are generating the state (t,y) from the previous action. Then when we pop (t,y), we must check: if (t,y) is a collision state, then we skip this state.\n\nSo we should add:\n\n   When we pop (t,y,path):\n        if y is between 1 and 8: \n            compute the car on freeway y at turn t: \n                if 0 in [L, R] (the car's span at time t) then this state is invalid -> skip.\n        if y==0 or y==9: safe -> then we proceed.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (t,9) and we check at the beginning of turn t. Then we don't take any action at turn t? Actually, we have already taken the actions to get to (t,9). So we are done.\n\nTherefore, when we pop (t,9) we can output.\n\nBut we must check (t,9): it is safe because y=9 -> no freeway.\n\nSo we do:\n\n   if y==9: then we output and break.\n\n   else:\n        if 1<=y<=8: \n            car_span = ... \n            if 0 in car_span: then skip this state (because we are collided at this turn) -> so we cannot take any action from here.\n        else: safe -> then we generate next states.\n\nBut note: the initial state (0,0): we check: y=0 -> safe -> then we generate next states.\n\nSo let's run:\n\nt=0, y=0: safe -> then generate next states: \n   U: (1,1)\n   D: (1,0)\n   S: (1,0)\n\nThen we push (1,1) with path ['U'] and (1,0) with paths ['D'] and ['S'].\n\nThen we process (1,0): \n   y=0 -> safe -> then generate next states: \n        U: (2,1)\n        D: (2,0)\n        S: (2,0)\n\nThen we process (1,1): \n   y=1: freeway1 at time1: [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        then generate: \n            U: (2,2)\n            D: (2,0)\n            S: (2,1)\n\nThen we process (2,0): safe -> generate (3,0) and (3,1)\n(2,1): freeway1 at time2: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe -> generate (3,2), (3,0), (3,1)\n(2,2): freeway2 at time2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe -> generate (3,3), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nBut note: the freeway cars: the cars on freeways 2,3,4,5 are identical? Actually, no: they are the same car? But they are on different freeways. So we have to check each freeway independently.\n\nBut we are only checking the freeway that corresponds to the current y.\n\nNow, let's check freeway 6: at time t, [-83+36*t, -48+36*t]. When does 0 fall in this interval?\n   -83+36*t <= 0 <= -48+36*t\n   => 36*t >= 48   -> t>= 48/36 = 1.33 -> so t>=2\n        and 36*t <= 83 -> t <= 83/36 ~ 2.3 -> so t=2? \n   at t=2: [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24] -> 0 in [-11,24]? yes.\n\nSo at freeway6, at time2, the car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: at time t, [-95+48*t, -48+48*t]\n   0 in the interval when:\n        -95+48*t <=0 and 0<= -48+48*t\n        => 48*t >=48 -> t>=1\n            and 48*t<=95 -> t<=95/48 ~ 1.97 -> so t=1 and t=2? \n        t=1: [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> 0 is included? \n            the interval is [L,R] inclusive? The problem says \"span\", so inclusive.\n            So at t=1: [-47,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\n        t=2: [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway7 and 8: \n   at t=1: collision at freeway7 and 8? but we are only on one freeway at a time.\n\nTherefore, if we are at freeway7 at time1, then collision. Similarly, freeway8 at time1: collision.\n\nBut freeway6: collision at time2.\n\nSo we must avoid being at:\n   freeway7 at time1: collision\n   freeway8 at time1: collision\n   freeway6 at time2: collision\n\nNow, we are going to simulate and avoid these.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. The minimal H is 9 (if we go straight up: 9 U's).\n\nCan we go straight up?\n\nWe start at (0,0) -> safe.\n\nThen at turn0: we take U -> at turn1: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (as computed: [49,60] at t=1 -> safe).\n\nThen at turn1: we take U -> at turn2: y=2 -> freeway2: at t=2: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn2: we take U -> at turn3: y=3 -> freeway3: at t=3: [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn3: we take U -> at turn4: y=4 -> freeway4: at t=4: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn4: we take U -> at turn5: y=5 -> freeway5: at t=5: [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn5: we take U -> at turn6: y=6 -> freeway6: at t=6: [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at time2 freeway6 was unsafe? but we are at freeway6 at time6 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we take U -> at turn7: y=7 -> freeway7: at t=7: [-95+48*7, -48+48*7] = [-95+336, -48+336] = [241,288] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn7: we take U -> at turn8: y=8 -> freeway8: at t=8: same as freeway7? [ -95+48*8, -48+48*8] = [-95+384, -48+384] = [289,336] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn8: we take U -> at turn9: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we can do 9 U's. Then H=9, and the sequence is: \n   turn0: U\n   turn1: U\n   turn2: U\n   turn3: U\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n\nBut is this safe? We must check the intermediate freeways:\n\n   turn0: at the beginning of turn0: y0=0 -> safe. Then we take U -> then at turn1: y1=1.\n\n   turn1: at the beginning of turn1: y1=1 -> freeway1: at t=1: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe. Then we take U -> turn2: y2=2.\n\n   turn2: freeway2: at t=2: [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36] -> safe. Then U -> turn3: y3=3.\n\n   turn3: freeway3: t=3: [-59+18, -48+18]=[-41,-30] -> safe. Then U -> turn4: y4=4.\n\n   turn4: freeway4: t=4: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe. Then U -> turn5: y5=5.\n\n   turn5: freeway5: t=5: [-59+30, -48+30]=[-29,-18] -> safe. Then U -> turn6: y6=6.\n\n   turn6: freeway6: t=6: [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe. Then U -> turn7: y7=7.\n\n   turn7: freeway7: t=7: [-95+48*7, -48+48*7] = [241,288] -> safe. Then U -> turn8: y8=8.\n\n   turn8: freeway8: t=8: [-95+48*8, -48+48*8] = [289,336] -> safe. Then U -> turn9: y9=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn1, we were on freeway1, but what about freeway7 and 8 at turn1? We were not on freeway7 or 8 at turn1, so we don't care. Only the freeway we are standing on matters.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, and the sequence is 9 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\". So for H=9, we have 9 actions: turn0 to turn8.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut let me double-check the car at freeway6 at time6: \n   initial: (-48,-83,right,36) -> so head=-48, tail=-83? Then the initial span is [-83,-48]? Then at time6: \n        new_tail = -83 + 36*6 = -83+216 = 133\n        new_head = -48+216 = 168\n        so [133,168] -> 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7: at time7: \n        initial: (-48,-95,right,48) -> span: [-95,-48] -> at time7: \n        tail = -95 + 48*7 = -95+336 = 241\n        head = -48+336=288\n        [241,288] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway6 at time2: [ -83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24] -> 0 in there. But we are not on freeway6 at time2. We are on freeway2 at time2. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at time1: freeway7: [ -95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0] -> collision if we were on freeway7 at time1. But we are on freeway1 at time1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of 9 U's is safe and minimal.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? 9 is the minimal because we need to move 9 steps up. So no.\n\nHowever, what if we move faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So no.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving upward ('U') at each turn from turn 0 to turn 8. This path avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified by checking the car spans at each turn when the player is on the corresponding freeway.\n\n- At turn 0: Start at \\((0, 0)\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- Action: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1.\n- At turn 1: Position \\((0, 1)\\).

Freeway 4 car span: \\([-59 + 6 \\times 4, -48 + 6 \\times 4] = [-35, -24]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- Action: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5: Position \\((0, 5)\\). Freeway 5 car span: \\([-59 + 6 \\times 5, -48 + 6 \\times 5] = [-29, -18]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- Action: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6: Position \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway 6 car span: \\([-83 + 36 \\times 6, -48 + 36 \\times 6] = [133, 168]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- Action: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7: Position \\((0, 7)\\). Freeway 7 car span: \\([-95 + 48 \\times 7, -48 + 48 \\times 7] = [241, 288]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- Action: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8: Position \\((0, 8)\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 2.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have the head and tail positions at turn t_1=2, direction, and speed. The car's span moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new row, they are not considered on that new row until the next turn. So, if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nCurrent player position: (0,2) at turn 2.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up from y=2, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically and cars move horizontally, the collision depends on whether a car covers x=0 at the turn when the player is on that row.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): car with head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 12. Since direction is right, the car is moving to the right, so at time t, the span is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nThe update is given as:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut at t_1, head is h, tail is τ, and for right-moving, head is to the right, so span is from left to right: [tail, head] or [head, tail]? The notation is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] for left-moving? No.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" but then it says → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, h is the head, which is leftmost or rightmost?\n\nI think I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nTypically, head might be the front, but in terms of position, for left-moving, the head is on the left, so smaller x, and tail on right, larger x? But in the update, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h is head and left, decreasing, so h - sΔT is more negative, so moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so [τ, h] with τ < h, and moving right.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right.\n\nBut if direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -59, since -48 > -59, so head is to the right of tail? That makes sense: tail at -59, head at -48, so the car spans from x=-59 to x=-48, and moving right, so at t_1, span is [-59, -48].\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + sΔT, -48 + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSo h = -48, τ = -59, d = right, s = 12.\n\nSince d=right, and τ = -59 < h = -48, so tail at left, head at right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt_1 = 2, so let Δt = T - 2, so for any turn T, relative to turn 2.\n\nI'll use t for the turn number, but since we start at t=2, let τ = t - 2, so at τ=0, turn 2.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0 (turn 2).\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny increases by 1 for U, decreases for D, stays for S.\n\nEach action is taken at the beginning of the turn, I assume, and position updates at the end or something? The dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position y_t, and action a_t changes it for the next turn.\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on y_T, and for the car on that row, 0 in span at T.\n\nSince player is on y_T at turn T, and we check if 0 is in the car's span at turn T for that freeway.\n\nNow, the cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8, so when player is on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. y=9 is the goal, and y=0 is the bottom.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, which is freeway, but let's see the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the car span as a function of time.\n\nt_1 = 2, so let Δt = t - 2.\n\nFor freeway k, the span at time t (turn t) is:\n\nFor direction right: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nFor direction left: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn the car state, head and tail are given, and direction.\n\nLet me make a table for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at t: [ -59 + 12(t-2) , -48 + 12(t-2) ]\n\nSimplify: let u = t - 2, so at relative time u.\n\nSpan: [ -59 + 12u , -48 + 12u ]\n\nCollision on y=1 at turn t if y_t = 1 and 0 in [ -59 + 12u , -48 + 12u ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t: [ -47 + 6(u) , -36 + 6(u) ] since u=t-2\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2? h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6, so same as y=2.\n\nIn table: freeway 2,3,4,5 all have (-36,-47,right,6)? Let me check.\n\nTable says:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 2: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6)  same\n\nFreeway 4: (-36,-47,right,6) same\n\nFreeway 5: (-36,-47,right,6) same\n\nAll y=2,3,4,5 have identical cars? But different freeways, so different rows.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all have cars with same parameters? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nThen freeway 6 (y=6): (24, -11, right, 36)? Head h=24, tail τ=-11, d=right, s=36\n\nSpan for right: [τ + s u, h + s u] = [ -11 + 36u , 24 + 36u ]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (48, 1, right, 48) h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48\n\nSpan: [1 + 48u, 48 + 48u]\n\nτ=1, h=48, so [1 + 48u, 48 + 48u]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, (48,1,right,48) so [1 + 48u, 48 + 48u]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span, meaning when the car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn t, player is on that y, and 0 is in the span for that car.\n\nSince only one car per freeway, I think.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and each possible t, whether 0 is in the span, i.e., if the car is at x=0.\n\nSince the span is a interval, 0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nLet me compute for each y, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nStart with y=1: span [ -59 + 12u , -48 + 12u ]\n\n0 in this if -59 + 12u <= 0 <= -48 + 12u\n\nSo -59 + 12u <= 0 => 12u <= 59 => u <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 12u => 12u >= 48 => u >= 4\n\nSo for u >=4 and u <=4.916, but u integer since turns are discrete.\n\nu = t-2, integer.\n\nu >=4 and u <=4, since 4.916, so u=4 only? u <=4.916 so u<=4? 12u <=59, u<=59/12=4.916, so u<=4 since u integer? u=4: 12*4=48, -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so at u=4, span: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 in [-11,0], yes, 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nu=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nu=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at u=4, t=2+4=6, on y=1, 0 is covered.\n\nAt turn t=6, if player on y=1, collision.\n\nNow y=2: freeway 2, span [ -47 + 6u , -36 + 6u ]\n\n0 in this if -47 + 6u <= 0 <= -36 + 6u\n\nLeft: -47 + 6u <=0 => 6u <=47 => u <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 + 6u => 6u >=36 => u >=6\n\nSo u >=6 and u <=7.833, so u=6,7\n\nu=6: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nu=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nu=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at u=6 and u=7, t=8 and t=9, on y=2, collision if present.\n\nt=2+6=8, t=2+7=9.\n\nu=6: t=8, u=7: t=9.\n\nNow y=3: same as y=2, since car identical, freeway 3: same parameters, so same times, at t=8 and t=9, collision on y=3.\n\nSimilarly y=4: same, t=8 and t=9.\n\ny=5: same, t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow y=6: freeway 6, h=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36\n\nSpan: [ -11 + 36u , 24 + 36u ]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 36u <= 0 <= 24 + 36u\n\nLeft: -11 + 36u <=0 => 36u <=11 => u <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so u <=0 since u integer >=0\n\nu=0: -11 +0 = -11, 24+0=24, span [-11,24], 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nu=1: -11+36=25, 24+36=60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nu negative not considered, since t>=2.\n\nAt u=0, t=2, span includes 0.\n\nSo on y=6 at t=2, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=2, not y=6, but if player goes to y=6 at some turn.\n\nAt turn t, if player on y=6, and 0 in span.\n\nAt u=0, t=2, span is [-11,24], 0 in, so if at turn 2, player on y=6, collision, but player is on y=2 at t=2.\n\nNow for t>2, u>=1, span [25,60] etc, 0 not in, so only at t=2, but since player not on y=6 at t=2, no issue for other times? u=0 only, so for t>2, no collision on y=6, because car has moved right.\n\nu=0: t=2, span includes 0.\n\nu=1: t=3, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly later, all positive, so only possible collision at t=2 on y=6, but since player not there, y=6 is safe for t>2.\n\nNow y=7: freeway 7, h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48\n\nSpan: [1 + 48u, 48 + 48u]\n\n0 in this? 1 + 48u <= 0 <= 48 + 48u\n\nLeft: 1+48u <=0, but u>=0, 1+48u >=1 >0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for any u, because low end is at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, high end larger, so 0 never in [1+48u, 48+48u] for u>=0.\n\nSo on y=7, no collision possible at any time.\n\nSimilarly y=8: freeway 8, same as y=7, (48,1,right,48), so span [1+48u,48+48u], same, 0 never in, so always safe.\n\nNow y=1: only unsafe at t=6\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=6: unsafe only at t=2, but since t=2 player at y=2, not issue, so safe for all t except possibly t=2, but not occupied, so effectively safe.\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: always safe\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=2 to y=9, need to increase by 7, so at least 7 moves up, but we can stay or move down, but that would take more turns, so probably we want to go up as fast as possible, avoiding unsafe times.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nFor y=1: unsafe only at t=6\n\nFor y=2: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=6: safe for all t (since only unsafe at t=2, not relevant)\n\ny=7: safe\n\ny=8: safe\n\nWe need to get from t=2, y=2 to some turn where y=9.\n\nSince we can move up, down, or stay, but to minimize turns, we should move up when possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=1 at t=6, and avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are critical for rows 2-5.\n\nNow, let me denote the turn number t.\n\nStart: t=2, y=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2 is safe? At t=2, for y=2, is it unsafe?\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=8 and t=9, not at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, u=0, for y=2, span [ -47 +0, -36+0] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows except y=6 were unsafe only at specific times, but at t=2, y=6 unsafe, but player not there.\n\nSo at t=2, y=2 is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but we have to pass through rows 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut rows 3,4,5 are unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAlso, y=1 unsafe at t=6, but since we start at y=2 and go up, we may not need to go to y=1.\n\ny=1 is below, we are going up to y=9, so we can ignore y=1, unless we go down, but that would be inefficient, so probably we stay above y=2 or go directly up.\n\nStart at y=2, target y=9.\n\nWe need to be on each row at some turn, but we can stay or move fast.\n\nSince rows 2-5 are dangerous at t=8 and t=9, we should avoid being on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at t=6.\n\nBut y=1 not relevant if we don't go down.\n\nNow, t=8 and t=9 are turns 8 and 9.\n\nCurrent turn t=2.\n\nSo from t=2 to t=8 is 6 turns later, etc.\n\nWe need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, and y=6 is safe, we can go to y=6,7,8 quickly and then to 9.\n\nBut we start at y=2.\n\nLet me list the position over time.\n\nLet t be the turn, y_t the position at turn t.\n\nAction at t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t, with a_t: U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nWe need y_T = 9 for some T, min H = T - t_1 + 1 or something.\n\nt_1=2, we start at turn 2.\n\nAfter H turns, we reach turn t_1 + H, position at turn t_1 + H should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H-1, so actions at t= t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of actions.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince y_{t_1} = 2, so net +7, so at least 7 U actions, and H >=7.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t= t_1 to t_1+H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + H is 9.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, we are at y=2.\n\nAfter action at t_1, at turn t_1+1, we are at y_{t_1+1}, and so on, until at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid collision at each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, I think? Collision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if we are on y_T between 1 and 8, and if for that freeway, 0 in span at T, collision.\n\nAt the turn when we reach y=9, since y=9 has no cars, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=0, no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns from t_1 to the turn before reaching 9, we need to be safe.\n\nBut when we reach turn with y=9, it's safe.\n\nNow back to the problem.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn T, and for all turns from 2 to T-1, the position must be safe.\n\nTo minimize T - 2, I think, since H is the number of actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=2, so min H such that after H actions, position at turn 2+H is 9.\n\nH min is 7, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we may not be able to due to collisions.\n\nSo let's see if we can go up in 7 turns.\n\nStart t=2, y=2\n\nAction U at t=2: y3 = 3\n\nt=3, y=3\n\nAction U at t=3: y4=4\n\nt=4, y=4\n\nAction U at t=4: y5=5\n\nt=5, y=5\n\nAction U at t=5: y6=6\n\nt=6, y=6\n\nNow at t=6, y=6, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nAction U at t=6: y7=7\n\nt=7, y=7, safe\n\nAction U at t=7: y8=8\n\nt=8, y=8, safe\n\nAction U at t=8: y9=9\n\nt=9, y=9, reached.\n\nBut at t=8, we are on y=8, which is safe, and we go to y=9 at t=9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt t=2: y=2, safe? t=2, y=2, not unsafe time, safe.\n\nt=3: y=3, unsafe at t=8,9, but t=3 is early, safe.\n\nt=4: y=4, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, safe\n\nt=7: y=7, safe\n\nt=8: y=8, safe\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point we are on unsafe row at unsafe time.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=2: y=2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, safe (unsafe only at t=8,9)\n\nt=4: y=4, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, safe\n\nt=7: y=7, safe\n\nt=8: y=8, safe\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nNo problem, and we reached in 7 actions: from t=2 to t=8, actions U each, 7 actions, at t=9, y=9.\n\nH=7, actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nt_1=2, actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so for H=7, actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8, position at t=9 is 9.\n\nAnd all positions safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=2,3,4,5 unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but in this sequence, at t=8, we are on y=8, not on 2-5, and at t=9, we are on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, t=6 is y=6, safe.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=1 at t=6? But we never on y=1.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions:\n\nAt turn t=2: action U, go to y=3 at t=3\n\nt=3: action U, go to y=4 at t=4\n\nt=4: action U, go to y=5 at t=5\n\nt=5: action U, go to y=6 at t=6\n\nt=6: action U, go to y=7 at t=7\n\nt=7: action U, go to y=8 at t=8\n\nt=8: action U, go to y=9 at t=9\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=7, which is the minimum possible since we need +7 in y.\n\nWe could go faster? No, because each U increases y by 1, so min 7 actions.\n\nBut we could have S or D, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at t=9.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision points.\n\nFor example, at t=6, we are on y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=6: u=t-2=4, span for y=6: [ -11 + 36u, 24 + 36u ] = [ -11 + 36*4, 24 + 36*4 ] = [ -11 + 144, 24 + 144] = [133, 168], 0 not in, safe, yes.\n\nt=6 is u=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, u=6, y=8: freeway 8, span [1+48u, 48+48u] = [1+48*6, 48+48*6] = [1+288, 48+288] = [289,336], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, what about the unsafe times: y=1 unsafe only at t=6, but we not there.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=8: at t=8, u=6, y=2 span [ -47 +6*6, -36+6*6] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in, so if at t=8 on y=2, collision.\n\nBut in our sequence, at t=8 we on y=8, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly t=9: u=7, y=2 span [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in, unsafe, but we not there.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But from y=2 to y=9, min 7 steps, so at turn 9, which is t=9.\n\nt=2 to t=9 is 7 turns later, position at t=9.\n\nSince we start at t=2, after 0 actions, at t=2, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=3, y=3, etc.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at t=9, y=9.\n\nSo min H=7.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, all U.\n\nBut is there any constraint that forces us to not go straight? Seems not.\n\nBut let me check y=3,4,5 at earlier times.\n\nFor example, at t=3, y=3: u=1, for y=3, span [ -47 +6*1, -36+6*1] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=4, y=4: u=2, [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nt=5, y=5: u=3, [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo direct up is fine.\n\nBut the car on y=6 at t=2 was unsafe, but we are there at t=6, not t=2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nSo minimal H=7, actions all U.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from t=2 to t=8.\n\nt_1=2, so actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1} = a_2 to a_{8}\n\nH=7, actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach U.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 6: a_{t_1 + 6} = U\n\nSince H-1=6, t from t_1 to t_1 + 6.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 2 + 7 -1 = 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nAnd at turn 9, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 6 has a car that at t=2 covers x=0, but we are not on y=6 at t=2, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut is there any problem with the movement?\n\nAnother thing: when we move from one row to another, we are not on the new row until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, no issue, since we move at each turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t, we are on y_t, we take action, at t+1 we are on y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision only if on the row at that turn.\n\nIn this sequence, we are on each row only for one turn, except possibly if we stay, but we don't.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by going to safe rows earlier, but since min is 7, and we achieve in 7, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if y=9 is reached.\n\nStart t=2, y=2\n\nAfter U at t=2, t=3 y=3\n\nU at t=3, t=4 y=4\n\nU at t=4, t=5 y=5\n\nU at t=5, t=6 y=6\n\nU at t=6, t=7 y=7\n\nU at t=7, t=8 y=8\n\nU at t=8, t=9 y=9\n\nYes.\n\nAll positions: t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5, t=6 y=6, t=7 y=7, t=8 y=8, all safe as per above.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, as said, span [133,168] not including 0.\n\nBut freeway 6 at t=6: u=4, [ -11 + 36*4, 24 + 36*4] = [-11+144,24+144]=[133,168], yes.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I thought y=2-5 unsafe at t=8,9, but we avoid by being on higher rows.\n\nBut is there a way to reach before t=9?\n\nFor example, can we reach at t=8?\n\nAt t=8, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=8, we need to start from y=2 at t=2, and in 6 actions, net +7? Impossible, because each action change y by at most 1, so from t=2 to t=8, 6 actions, position at t=8 is y2 plus sum of 6 actions, each between -1 and 1, so y8 between y2 -6 and y2 +6, so between -4 and 8, and 9 is outside, so impossible to reach y=9 before t=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, max y=8 if all U from t=2 to t=7.\n\nActions at t=2 to t=7 determine y at t=8.\n\nAfter 6 actions, position at t=8.\n\ny8 = y2 + sum_{t=2 to7} Δy_t\n\ny2=2, so y8 <= 2 + 6 =8, or min 2-6=-4.\n\nSo y8 <=8 <9, so cannot be 9 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y9 <=2+7=9, so possible only if all U.\n\nThus, earliest at t=9, with all U actions.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 6: U\n\nSince t_1=2.\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=7, so actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +6.\n\nYes.\n\nSince all same, but I think we need to list.\n\nPerhaps write the sequence.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t_1} = U\n\nt=1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nt=6: a_{t_1 +6} = U\n\nWith H=7.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\netc.\n\nBut since t_1=2, but we use t_1 in the label.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nOne thing: freeway 1 at t=6 is unsafe, but we are on y=6, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y=2 is unsafe, but we on y=8.\n\nBut what about the car on y=6 at t=2? But we not there at t=2.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 6, the car at t=2 has tail τ=-11, head h=24, direction right, so at t=2, span [-11,24], includes 0, so if player on y=6 at t=2, collision, but player at y=2, so ok.\n\nAnd later, it moves away.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, cars are at high x, never cover 0.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has (24, -11, right, 36), and I used that.\n\nBut in the table, it says for freeway 6: (24, -11, right, 36), but head and tail, with tail -11, head 24, so tail left, head right.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the direction.\n\nIn freeway 7: (48,1,right,48), tail τ=1, head h=48, so [1,48] at t_1, moving right.\n\nSpan [1+48u,48+48u], min x=1+48u >=1>0, so never 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7, all actions U.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nIn terms of t_1:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: & U \\end{array} }\n\nSince it's multiple lines.\n\nPerhaps without array, but I think it's fine.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of moves to increase the \\(y\\)-coordinate from 2 to 9 is 7, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1. A sequence of 7 consecutive \"U\" actions achieves this in \\(H = 7\\) turns, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H = 2 + 7 = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence must avoid collisions at each turn from \\(t = 2\\) to \\(t = 8\\) (the turns before reaching \\(y = 9\\)). Analysis of the car positions and movements shows that:\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turn \\(t = 6\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe at turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at turn \\(t = 2\\), but since the player is not on \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 2\\), it is safe for all other turns.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are always safe, as the car spans never include \\(x = 0\\).\n- \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is safe.\n\nThe sequence of all \"U\" actions results in the following positions:\n- Turn 2: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, not unsafe at \\(t = 2\\))\n- Turn 3: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\))\n- Turn 4: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\))\n- Turn 5: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\))\n- Turn 6: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, car span at \\(t = 6\\) is \\([133, 168]\\), excluding 0)\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, always)\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, always)\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 9\\) (reached, no cars)\n\nNo collisions occur, and \\(H = 7\\) is minimal.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe car update rules: \n  - Right-moving: at time T, the car's span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  - We note that collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on row y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to row y_{T+1}. Therefore, we only check the freeway we are on at the beginning of the turn (i.e., at the time of the turn) for collision.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H (turns), avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can only move one step up, down, or stay at each turn. We start at y0 = 0 (at turn t1=6) and we want to reach y=9.\n\nWe note that the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and the freeways (with cars) are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=6 for each freeway (1 to 8):\n\nFreeway 1: (h=48, tau=37, d='right', s=12) -> right-moving: so at time T, the car is [37 + 12*(T-6), 48 + 12*(T-6)]\nFreeway 2: (h=-48, tau=-59, d='right', s=6) -> [ -59 + 6*(T-6), -48 + 6*(T-6) ]\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 2\nFreeway 6: (h=-48, tau=-83, d='right', s=36) -> [ -83 + 36*(T-6), -48 + 36*(T-6) ]\nFreeway 7: (h=-48, tau=-95, d='right', s=48) -> [ -95 + 48*(T-6), -48 + 48*(T-6) ]\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7\n\nWe note that the cars are moving right, so their positions are increasing.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0, then collision occurs.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when the car on that freeway covers 0 at T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1 that gets the player to (0,9) at turn 6+H-1.\n\nNote: The player moves at each turn. So at turn 6 (the current turn) we start at y=0. We can choose an action for turn 6, then turn 7, etc.\n\nWe need to reach y=9. The minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 9 moves up (H=9). But we have obstacles on the freeways.\n\nWe must simulate the movement and check for collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe note that we start at y=0 (which is not a freeway) and we want to end at y=9 (also not a freeway). The freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nWe can use BFS or Dijkstra (since each step cost is 1) to find the minimal path. The state is (turn, y). But note that the turn number matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nWe are starting at turn 6, position y=0. We want to reach y=9 at any turn with minimal turns (so minimal number of steps).\n\nWe can consider the state as (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=6) and y is the current row.\n\nActions: U, D, S -> y_next = y + {+1, -1, 0} (clamped to [0,9])\n\nWe must avoid being in a freeway row (1<=y<=8) at a turn t if the car on that row at turn t has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe note that the car positions are linear functions of (t-6). So for a given freeway k, we can compute the car's span at any turn t.\n\nLet me precompute for each freeway k and for a range of turns (starting from t=6 to a sufficiently large t) the condition for collision: whether 0 is in the car's span at turn t.\n\nBut note: we don't need to precompute for all turns arbitrarily far because the cars are moving and the pattern might be periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed and the road is infinite? But the collision only matters when the car's span covers 0. Since the cars are moving, they will eventually pass 0 and then move away. However, because the speeds are positive (right-moving), they will pass 0 only once? Actually, they might pass 0 multiple times if the span is long? But note: the span is a contiguous interval that moves to the right. Since the speed is constant and the span length is fixed, they will cover 0 only for a contiguous set of turns? Actually, the entire span moves without changing length.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k the time interval during which the car covers 0.\n\nFor a right-moving car on freeway k at turn t (with data (h, tau, d, s)):\n   The car's span at turn t: [tau + s*(t-6), h + s*(t-6)]\n\nWe want to know for which t the interval [A(t), B(t)] contains 0, where A(t) = tau + s*(t-6), B(t) = h + s*(t-6).\n\nCondition: A(t) <= 0 <= B(t)\n\nSo:\n   tau + s*(t-6) <= 0   and   h + s*(t-6) >= 0\n\nSolve for t:\n\nFrom the first inequality: t-6 <= -tau / s   => t <= 6 - tau/s\nFrom the second: t-6 >= -h/s   => t >= 6 - h/s\n\nBut note: for the right-moving car, we have h>tau? Actually, the head is at the right, so h>tau. But in the data, for freeway1: h=48, tau=37 -> h>tau. For freeway2: h=-48, tau=-59 -> h>tau because -48 > -59.\n\nSo the condition becomes:\n   6 - h/s <= t <= 6 - tau/s\n\nBut note: because h>tau, then -h/s > -tau/s? Actually, because s>0, then -h/s > -tau/s only if h<tau? But h>tau, so -h/s < -tau/s. Therefore, the interval is [6 - h/s, 6 - tau/s]. However, we must check the inequalities:\n\nActually, the condition is:\n   t >= 6 - h/s   and   t <= 6 - tau/s\n\nSince h>tau, we have -h/s < -tau/s (because h and tau are negative? or positive?).\n\nWe must compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n   h=48, tau=37, s=12\n   t >= 6 - 48/12 = 6 - 4 = 2\n   t <= 6 - 37/12 = 6 - 3.083... = 2.916... \n   So t must be integer? Then t=2 or 3? But wait, our turn starts at 6. So for t>=6, we have no solution? Because 2.916... is less than 6. So for t>=6, the car on freeway1 never covers 0? \n\nLet me verify at t=6:\n   A(6) = 37 + 12*0 = 37\n   B(6) = 48 + 12*0 = 48 -> 0 is not in [37,48]. And as t increases, the car moves right, so the entire interval moves right and 0 is never covered for t>=6.\n\nFreeway 2: h=-48, tau=-59, s=6\n   t >= 6 - (-48)/6 = 6 + 48/6 = 6+8 = 14\n   t <= 6 - (-59)/6 = 6 + 59/6 = 6 + 9.833... = 15.833...\n\nSo for integer t: t=14,15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: same as freeway2 -> collision at t=14,15.\n\nFreeway 6: h=-48, tau=-83, s=36\n   t >= 6 - (-48)/36 = 6 + 48/36 = 6 + 4/3 ≈ 6+1.333 = 7.333 -> so t>=8 (since integer, we take ceiling? Actually, t must be at least the lower bound, so the smallest integer t is 8? But note: the inequality is t>=7.333, so the smallest integer is 8.\n   t <= 6 - (-83)/36 = 6 + 83/36 ≈ 6 + 2.3055 = 8.3055 -> so t<=8.\n\nTherefore, only t=8.\n\nBut wait: at t=8, the car on freeway6 will cover 0? Let me check:\n   At t=8: A(8)= -83 + 36*(8-6) = -83 + 36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n           B(8)= -48 + 72 = 24\n   So 0 is in [-11,24] -> yes.\n\nFreeway7: h=-48, tau=-95, s=48\n   t >= 6 - (-48)/48 = 6 + 48/48 = 6+1 = 7\n   t <= 6 - (-95)/48 = 6 + 95/48 ≈ 6 + 1.979 = 7.979 -> so t=7,8? \n\nBut let's check the inequalities: t>=7 and t<=7.979 -> so integer t: 7 and 8.\n\nAt t=7: \n   A(7)= -95 + 48*(1) = -95+48 = -47\n   B(7)= -48+48=0 -> so the interval is [-47,0]. 0 is included? Yes, because the condition is A(t)<=0<=B(t). So at t=7, 0 is included? But note: the head is at 0? and the tail is at -47. So the car covers 0 at t=7.\n\nAt t=8:\n   A(8)= -95 + 48*2 = -95+96=1\n   B(8)= -48+96=48 -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> so only t=7? \n\nWait: the condition is A(t)<=0<=B(t). At t=7: A(7)=-47<=0 and B(7)=0>=0 -> so 0 is included. At t=8: A(8)=1>0 -> 0 is not in the interval.\n\nSo freeway7: only t=7.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"head at h, tail at tau\". For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? The problem states for right-moving: the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and since tau < h, the interval is [left, right] = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nAt t=7, the car on freeway7: [ -95+48, -48+48 ] = [-47, 0]. So 0 is the head? and the tail is -47. So the car covers from -47 to 0. Therefore, 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same as freeway7 -> collision at t=7.\n\nSummary of dangerous (turn, freeway) pairs:\n\nFreeway 1: no collision for t>=6.\nFreeway 2: collision at t=14,15\nFreeway 3: same -> collision at t=14,15\nFreeway 4: same\nFreeway 5: same\nFreeway 6: collision at t=8\nFreeway 7: collision at t=7\nFreeway 8: collision at t=7\n\nSo the dangerous situations:\n\n- On freeway 6 at turn 8: collision.\n- On freeway 7 at turn 7: collision.\n- On freeway 8 at turn 7: collision.\n- On freeway 2,3,4,5 at turn 14,15: collision.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 6. We are going to move from y=0 to y=9. The minimal steps are 9 moves (if we go up continuously). Then we would be at turn 6+9-1 = 14? Actually, we start at turn 6 and we take H turns: so we are at turn 6 + H - 1 at the end.\n\nIf we take 9 steps (H=9), then we end at turn 14. But during the journey, we pass through freeways at turns 6,7,...,14? \n\nWait: \n  Turn 6: start at y=0 (safe) -> then we choose an action for turn6 that will update to y1 at turn7.\n  Turn7: at y1 (which is either 0,1) -> then update to y2 at turn8, etc.\n\nSo the freeway we are on at turn t (for t>=6) is the y at the beginning of turn t.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At turn 7: being on freeway 7 or 8 (because they have collision at turn7).\n- At turn 8: being on freeway 6 (collision).\n- At turn 14: being on freeway2,3,4,5 (collision at turn14 and 15).\n\nWe are starting at turn6 at y=0. We are going to move.\n\nMinimal H: we must go from 0 to 9. The minimal number of moves is 9 (if we go up every time). Then we would be:\n\n  Turn6: at y0=0 -> action U -> then at turn7: y1=1\n  Turn7: at y1=1 -> action U -> turn8: y2=2\n  Turn8: at y2=2 -> action U -> turn9: y3=3\n  Turn9: at y3=3 -> action U -> turn10: y4=4\n  Turn10: at y4=4 -> action U -> turn11: y5=5\n  Turn11: at y5=5 -> action U -> turn12: y6=6\n  Turn12: at y6=6 -> action U -> turn13: y7=7\n  Turn13: at y7=7 -> action U -> turn14: y8=8\n  Turn14: at y8=8 -> action U -> turn15: y9=9\n\nBut we end at turn15? Actually, we started at turn6 and we did 9 moves (H=9) and the last action is at turn6+8? Let me index:\n\n  t=6: we are at y=0, then we choose a6 -> then at t=7: y= y0 + a6 (if a6=U then 1)\n  ...\n  t=6+H-1: we are at y=9.\n\nSo we do H actions: at turns 6, 6+1, ..., 6+H-1. And at the end of the last action (at turn 6+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above sequence:\n\n  Actions: at turn6: U -> turn7: y=1\n           turn7: U -> turn8: y=2\n           turn8: U -> turn9: y=3\n           turn9: U -> turn10: y=4\n           turn10: U -> turn11: y=5\n           turn11: U -> turn12: y=6\n           turn12: U -> turn13: y=7\n           turn13: U -> turn14: y=8\n           turn14: U -> turn15: y=9\n\nSo we have H=9 actions, and we end at turn15.\n\nNow, during the journey:\n\n  At turn7: we are at y=1 -> safe (freeway1 has no collision at turn7? we saw freeway1 is safe at all t>=6, and freeway7 collision at turn7 but we are at freeway1, not 7 or 8).\n  At turn8: we are at y=2 -> freeway2? but freeway2 collision only at t=14,15 -> safe at t=8.\n  At turn9: y=3 -> safe\n  At turn10: y=4 -> safe\n  At turn11: y=5 -> safe\n  At turn12: y=6 -> freeway6: collision at turn8? but we are at turn12 -> safe? because the collision for freeway6 is only at t=8. So safe.\n  At turn13: y=7 -> freeway7: collision at turn7? but we are at turn13 -> safe? because collision only at t=7.\n  At turn14: y=8 -> freeway8: collision at turn7? but we are at turn14 -> safe? \n  At turn15: we end at y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn14 we are at freeway8? and freeway8 has collision at turn14? Let me check: we computed freeway2,3,4,5 have collision at turn14? But freeway8 only has collision at turn7. So at turn14, freeway8 is safe.\n\nHowever, note that freeway2,3,4,5 have collision at turn14. But we are at freeway8 at turn14, which is not one of those. So safe.\n\nBut then the entire sequence is safe? \n\nBut wait: we have freeway2,3,4,5: they are freeways 2,3,4,5. We are at freeway8 at turn14. So no problem.\n\nSo the minimal sequence of 9 moves (all U) would work? Then why do we have a problem?\n\nBut wait: at turn7 we are at freeway1? and we are safe. At turn8 we are at freeway2? and freeway2 has collision at t=14 and 15, but we are at turn8 -> safe.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway6: we are at freeway6 at turn12. The car on freeway6: \n   At turn12: A(12)= -83 + 36*(12-6) = -83 + 36*6 = -83+216 = 133\n             B(12)= -48+216=168 -> 0 not in [133,168] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn13: \n   A(13)= -95+48*(13-6)= -95+48*7 = -95+336=241\n   B(13)= -48+336=288 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence of 9 Ups is safe? Then the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem is: we start at turn6, and we are going to do 9 actions: from turn6 to turn14? and at turn14 we do the last U to get to y=9 at turn15? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo for H=9, the actions are for turns 6 to 14.\n\nAnd we end at turn14? Actually, after the last action (at turn14) we update the position: so at the end of turn14, we are at y=9. And then we are done.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: we are at a freeway at the beginning of the turn. At the beginning of turn14, we are at y=8 (freeway8) and then we move to y=9. So at the beginning of turn14, we are at freeway8 and we check the car on freeway8 at turn14: \n   Freeway8: same as freeway7? \n   At turn14: A(14)= -95+48*(14-6)= -95+48*8 = -95+384=289\n             B(14)= -48+384=336 -> 0 not in [289,336] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nBut why then is the problem given? Maybe I made a mistake in the collision for freeway2 at turn14? \n\nAt turn14, for freeway2: \n   A(14)= -59 + 6*(14-6)= -59+6*8 = -59+48 = -11\n   B(14)= -48+48=0 -> so the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? \n\nYes! So at turn14, if we are on freeway2,3,4,5, we collide. But in our sequence, at turn14 we are at freeway8? \n\nWait: how did we get to freeway8 at turn14?\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n  turn6: y0=0 -> U -> at turn7: y=1\n  turn7: y=1 -> U -> turn8: y=2\n  turn8: y=2 -> U -> turn9: y=3\n  turn9: y=3 -> U -> turn10: y=4\n  turn10: y=4 -> U -> turn11: y=5\n  turn11: y=5 -> U -> turn12: y=6\n  turn12: y=6 -> U -> turn13: y=7\n  turn13: y=7 -> U -> turn14: y=8\n\nSo at the beginning of turn14, we are at y=8 (freeway8). Then we do U and go to y=9 at the end of turn14.\n\nBut at turn14, we are at freeway8 at the beginning, and freeway8 is safe? and freeway2 is dangerous at turn14? but we are not on freeway2.\n\nSo the sequence of 9 Ups is safe and we reach y=9 at turn14? \n\nWait: the last action is at turn14, and after that we are at y=9. So we are at y=9 at the end of turn14? Then we are done. We don't need to be at y=9 at the beginning of a turn? The goal is to be at (0,9) at the turn when we finish the last action? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence? \n\nThe player update: at turn t, we do action a_t and then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta. So at the end of turn t, we are at y_{t+1}. \n\nBut the collision condition: at turn t, we are at y_t (the state at the beginning of the turn) and we check the car on the freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSo the goal: we want at the last action (at turn t1+H-1) that after the update we are at y=9. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y=9 at the end of that turn.\n\nWe do not require to be at y=9 at the beginning of a turn? \n\nIn the sequence above, at turn14 (which is the last action) we are at y=8 at the beginning, then we do U and become y=9 at the end. So we are done.\n\nBut note: we never are at y=9 at the beginning of a turn? because we end at the end of turn14. That is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of 9 Ups is safe and minimal.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We are only on freeways during the journey? and we checked that at the turns we were on freeways, the car didn't cover 0? \n\nSpecifically:\n\n  Turn6: at y=0 -> not a freeway, no check.\n  Turn7: at y=1 -> freeway1: safe (car doesn't cover 0 at t=7)\n  Turn8: at y=2 -> freeway2: at t=8, the car on freeway2: \n        A(8)= -59 + 6*(8-6) = -59+12 = -47\n        B(8)= -48+12 = -36 -> 0 not in [-47,-36]? (since -36 is negative) -> safe.\n  Turn9: at y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? \n        At t=9: A(9)= -59+6*(3) = -59+18=-41, B(9)=-48+18=-30 -> safe.\n  Turn10: y=4 -> freeway4: same -> at t=10: A(10)= -59+24=-35, B(10)=-48+24=-24 -> safe.\n  Turn11: y=5 -> freeway5: at t=11: A(11)= -59+30=-29, B(11)=-48+30=-18 -> safe.\n  Turn12: y=6 -> freeway6: at t=12: as above, [133,168] -> safe.\n  Turn13: y=7 -> freeway7: at t=13: [241,288] -> safe.\n  Turn14: y=8 -> freeway8: at t=14: [289,336] -> safe.\n\nSo no collision at any turn.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem might be that at turn14, we are at freeway8, but the car on freeway8 is the same as freeway7? and we computed freeway7 collision at t=7? but that was for freeway7. At freeway8, we have the same car? Actually, no: the freeways are independent. The table gives for each freeway k a car. So freeway7 has one car, freeway8 has another car? but they have the same parameters? \n\nIn the table, freeway7: (-48,-95,right,48) and freeway8: same. So they are different cars but same parameters. So at turn14, freeway8: the car is at [ -95+48*(14-6), -48+48*8 ] = [ -95+384, -48+384] = [289,336] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nBut why then is the problem given? Maybe I made a mistake in the collision condition? \n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd we checked that for each freeway we were on, at the turn T we were there, the car's span did not include 0.\n\nSo the answer should be 9 moves: all U.\n\nBut let me check if we can do less? H=9 is minimal because we have to go from 0 to 9, which is 9 steps up. So no shorter sequence.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n\nBut wait: the last action is at turn14, and we end at y=9 at the end of turn14.\n\nBut note: we are required to output the actions for turns starting at t1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo t from 0 to 8 (since H=9, t=0,...,8) -> turns: 6+0=6, 6+1=7, ..., 6+8=14.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\nBut wait: there is a known issue: at turn7, we are at freeway1 and we are safe, but what about the car on freeway7? It is at freeway7, and we are at freeway1, so we don't care.\n\nHowever, let me reexamine the collision condition: it says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are only collided if we are on that freeway at that turn and the car covers 0.\n\nSo it's per freeway and per turn.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is valid.\n\nBut I recall that in the initial summary, I thought freeway7 and 8 are dangerous at turn7, but we are not on them at turn7? we are on freeway1 at turn7.\n\nSo why did I think we might have a problem? I think I misread: the dangerous freeways at a turn are only the one we are standing on.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence of 9 Ups.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9.\n\nHowever, let me check if we can do it in 9? We have to go up 9 times. So no.\n\nBut note: we can also stay or go down? but that would only increase the number of turns. So minimal is 9.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut wait: the initial state says the player is at (0,0) at turn6. Then at turn7, we are at (0,1). Then we are at freeway1 at turn7.\n\nBut freeway1: the car is at [37,48] at turn7? \n   At turn7: freeway1: [37+12*(7-6), 48+12*(7-6)] = [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> 0 not in there. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nSo I think the answer is 9 Ups.\n\nBut why are there cars with negative positions? They are moving right and will eventually pass 0? but we are at positive turns and they are moving away from 0? \n\nFor freeway2: the car is at [-59, -48] at turn6. Then at turn7: [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42]. Then at turn8: [-47,-36] and so on. They are moving to the right (increasing). They will pass 0 at turn14? \n\nAt turn14: freeway2: [-59+6*(14-6)= -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> so the head is exactly at 0? and the tail at -11. So the car covers 0 at turn14. Therefore, if we were on freeway2 at turn14, we collide. But we are on freeway8 at turn14, so we avoid.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is safe.\n\nI think we are good.\n\nBut the problem has freeway6 and freeway7 collisions at early turns? but we are not on those freeways at those turns.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is 9 Ups.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 6 to turn 14.\n\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 1)\\) at the end of turn 6, but collision checks occur at the beginning of each turn. Since \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway, no collision check is needed at turn 6.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1). The car on freeway 1 at turn 7 has a span of \\([37 + 12 \\times (7-6), 48 + 12 \\times (7-6)] = [49, 60]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2).

The car on freeway 4 at turn 10 has a span of \\([-59 + 6 \\times (10-6), -48 + 6 \\times (10-6)] = [-35, -24]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5). The car on freeway 5 at turn 11 has a span of \\([-59 + 6 \\times (11-6), -48 + 6 \\times (11-6)] = [-29, -18]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6). The car on freeway 6 at turn 12 has a span of \\([-83 + 36 \\times (12-6), -48 + 36 \\times (12-6)] = [133, 168]\\), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- At turn 13, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7). The car on freeway 7 at turn 13 has a span of \\([-95 + 48 \\times (13-6), -48 + 48 \\times (13-6)] = [241, 288]\\), which does not contain 0.

Safe.\n- After the action at turn 14 (U), the player moves to \\((0, 9)\\), achieving the goal.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions because the player is never on a freeway at a turn where the car on that freeway spans 0.

The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and for each freeway, there are cars defined with head, tail, direction, and speed. Collision occurs only if at the turn when the player is on a freeway, the x-position 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. So, if they move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T they are still on y, and only on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 7 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, list out the car states at turn t_1=7:\n\n- Freeway 1: car at (60,49, right, 12) – since direction is right, head is at 49? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases. For right-moving, span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so both increase.\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (60,49, right, 12). Since direction is right, for right-moving cars, the span is given as [τ, h], so here τ is tail, h is head? But it says head h, tail τ, so for right-moving, head should be the front, which is larger if moving right.\n\nAssume that for right-moving cars, head is the right end, tail is the left end. So at position, for right-moving, head > tail.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end, so head < tail.\n\nBut in this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: (60,49, right, 12) – head=60, tail=49? But if moving right, and head=60, tail=49, that would imply head is at higher x, so tail at 49, head at 60, so span [49,60] at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-42,-53, right,6) – head=-42, tail=-53? -42 > -53, so tail=-53, head=-42, span [-53,-42]? But tail should be left, so if moving right, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nx-axis: lower x to the left, I assume.\n\nSo for right-moving car, it moves to increasing x, so tail is smaller x, head is larger x.\n\nSo for freeway 2: head=-42, tail=-53. Since -42 > -53, head is at -42, tail at -53, so span from min to max: tail to head, [ -53, -42 ].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5 same as freeway 2: (-42,-53, right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-12,-47, right,36) – head=-12, tail=-47? -12 > -47, so tail=-47, head=-12, span [-47,-12]\n\nFreeway 7: (0,-47, right,48) – head=0, tail=-47, span [-47,0]\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-47, right,48) same as 7.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1 at turn 7.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars (freeways are y=1 to 8), once we reach y=9, we're safe, no collision possible.\n\nNow, we need to move from y=1 to y=9, so we need to go up, but we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision is checked only at the turn when the player is on the freeway. If the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are on that y at turn T+1, so for the action at turn T, it affects position at turn T+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player has position y_t.\n\nThen, based on action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t is given, then action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=7, and we need to compute for future turns.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1, so time elapsed from turn 7.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time T, span depends on direction.\n\nFor right-moving car: initial span at T=7: let’s say tail τ_0, head h_0, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T, span is [ τ_0 + s*(T-7), h_0 + s*(T-7) ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, so:\n\nGeneral formula for right-moving car: at turn T, position span [ τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1) ]\n\nwhere τ and h are tail and head at t_1.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 is in [ τ_k + s_k*(T - 7), h_k + s_k*(T - 7) ]\n\nPlayer starts at y_7 = 1.\n\nWe need y_{t} for t >=7.\n\nLet me denote the turn from start: let t be the turn number, with t=7 initial.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe need to find actions a_t for t=7,8,9,... such that y_t reaches 9 for some t, and no collision at any turn from 7 to that t-1, I think? When we reach y_t=9, since no car on y=9, no collision at that turn or after, but we need to be safe until we reach.\n\nCollision only when on y=1 to 8.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in car span on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=1, the minimal number of turns in terms of moves: since we need to go up 8 units, each U action moves up one, S or D don't help, so minimal H would be if we go up every turn, but we might have to wait or avoid, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut we start at turn 7, and we need to output actions from turn 7.\n\nNow, let's list the car on each freeway and when they cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, find the times T when 0 is in the car span at turn T.\n\nSince only one car per freeway? Looking at the table, each freeway has one car listed, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: car (60,49, right,12)\n\nAt turn T, span: [49 + 12*(T-7), 60 + 12*(T-7)]\n\nSet min = 49 + 12(T-7), max = 60 + 12(T-7)\n\n0 is in [min, max] if min <= 0 <= max\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: min = 49 + 12(T-7), max = 60 + 12(T-7)\n\nmin <= 0 <= max\n\n49 + 12(T-7) <= 0 and 0 <= 60 + 12(T-7)\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 12(T-7) <= 0 => 12(T-7) <= -49 => T-7 <= -49/12 ≈ -4.083, so T-7 <= -5 since T integer? T-7 is integer.\n\nT-7 <= floor(-49/12) = floor(-4.083) = -5? -49/12 = -4.083, so 12(T-7) <= -49, since 12(T-7) integer, T-7 <= ceil(-49/12) or floor?\n\n12(T-7) <= -49, divide both sides by 12, T-7 <= -49/12 ≈ -4.083, so since T-7 integer, T-7 <= -5.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 60 + 12(T-7) => 12(T-7) >= -60 => T-7 >= -60/12 = -5.\n\nSo both inequalities: T-7 <= -5 and T-7 >= -5, so T-7 = -5.\n\nThus at T-7 = -5, T=2, but T=2 is before turn 7, since t_1=7, T=2 <7, so for T>=7, min >0? Let's see.\n\nAt T-7 = -5, min = 49 +12*(-5) = 49 -60 = -11, max=60-60=0.\n\nSo at T=2, min=-11, max=0, so 0 is included.\n\nBut for T>7, T-7 >=0, min =49 +12*(something >=0) >=49>0, so min>0, thus 0 not in span for T>=7.\n\nSimilarly, max=60+12*(T-7) >0 for T>=7.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at all turns T>=7, since car is moving right, and at T=7 min=49>0, so x=0 is not covered, and will never be for T>=7. So freeway 1 is safe at all times for T>=7.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-42,-53, right,6) head=-42, tail=-53? Earlier I said tail is left end.\n\nIn the state: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nSo at t_1=7, tail τ = -53, head h = -42.\n\nSpan at T: [ τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7) ] = [ -53 + 6(T-7), -42 + 6(T-7) ]\n\n0 in span if -53 +6(T-7) <= 0 <= -42 +6(T-7)\n\nLet Δt = T-7\n\nSo -53 +6Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -42 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -53 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=53 => Δt <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so Δt <= 8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +6Δt => 42 <= 6Δt => Δt >= 42/6 = 7\n\nSo Δt >=7 and Δt <=8\n\nThus at Δt=7, T=14, and Δt=8, T=15\n\nAt T=14: min = -53 +6*7 = -53+42= -11, max= -42+42=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nAt T=15: min= -53+48= -5, max= -42+48=6, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (-42,-53,right,6), so same, collision at T=14 and 15.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=14,15.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at T=14,15.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-12,-47, right,36)\n\nhead=-12, tail=-47\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 +36(Δt), -12 +36(Δt) ] where Δt = T-7\n\n0 in span if -47 +36Δt <=0 <= -12 +36Δt\n\nFirst: -47 +36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/36≈1.305, so Δt <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +36Δt => 12 <=36Δt => Δt >=12/36=1/3≈0.333, so Δt >=1 since Δt integer\n\nThus Δt=1, so T=8\n\nAt T=8: min= -47 +36(1) = -47+36= -11, max= -12+36=24, so 0 in [-11,24]\n\nΔt=1, T=7+1=8.\n\nNow freeway 7: (0,-47, right,48)\n\nhead=0, tail=-47\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 +48(Δt), 0 +48(Δt) ] = [ -47 +48Δt, 48Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +48Δt <=0 <= 48Δt\n\nFirst: -47 +48Δt <=0 => 48Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/48<1, so Δt <=0? Since Δt integer >=0, Δt=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 48Δt, which for Δt>=0 always true except Δt=0? 0 <= 48*0 =0, so 0 <=0 is true, so at Δt=0, 0 in [ -47 +0, 0 ] = [-47,0], which includes 0.\n\nBut Δt=0 is T=7.\n\nNow, for Δt>0, min = -47 +48Δt, at Δt=0 min=-47, at Δt=1 min=1, max=48, so 0 not in [1,48]\n\nSimilarly for larger Δt.\n\nSo at T=7, for freeway 7, 0 is in span because min=-47<=0<=0=max.\n\nBut at T=7, player is on y=1, not on y=7, so for freeway 7, collision only if player is on y=7 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, (0,-47,right,48), so at T=7, 0 in span.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is covered at turn T for T>=7:\n\n- Freeway 1: never for T>=7\n\n- Freeway 2: at T=14 and T=15\n\n- Freeway 3: at T=14 and 15\n\n- Freeway 4: at T=14 and 15\n\n- Freeway 5: at T=14 and 15\n\n- Freeway 6: at T=8\n\n- Freeway 7: at T=7\n\n- Freeway 8: at T=7\n\nAlso, note that for freeways 2,3,4,5, collision at T=14,15; freeway 6 at T=8; freeway 7 and 8 at T=7.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 7, y=1.\n\nAt turn 7, player is on y=1. Now, is there collision at turn 7?\n\nFor y=1, freeway 1: at T=7, span min=49, max=60, both >0, so 0 not in span, so no collision on y=1 at T=7.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collision at T=7, but player is not on them.\n\nSo at turn 7, no collision since on y=1 which is safe.\n\nNow, player takes action a_7, which determines y_8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=1, to go to y=9, we need 8 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut moving down might not be useful since we need to go up, but perhaps to avoid being on a row at a bad time.\n\nNow, the critical points are:\n\n- Freeway 6 has collision at T=8, so if player is on y=6 at turn 8, collision.\n\n- Freeway 7 and 8 have collision only at T=7, which is past, so for T>7, they are safe? Freeway 7 at T=7 only, for T>7, min increases, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 have collision at T=14 and 15, which might be far, but we might reach y=9 before that.\n\nFirst, let's think about the near future.\n\nAt turn 7, player at y=1, safe.\n\nAction a_7: can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_8 = 2\n\nIf S, y_8=1\n\nIf D, y_8=0, but y=0 is not a freeway, I think? y=0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, both no cars.\n\nSo if at y=0, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 8, if player is on y=6, collision, because freeway 6 has car covering x=0 at T=8.\n\nOther freeways are safe at T=8 except possibly.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=8 only.\n\nFreeway 1 safe, freeway 2,3,4,5 safe at T=8 since collision only at 14,15.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 safe at T=8.\n\nSo only issue at T=8 is if on y=6.\n\nPlayer at turn 7, y=1.\n\nIf a_7 = U, then y_8 =2\n\nIf a_7 = S, y_8=1\n\nIf a_7 = D, y_8=0\n\nNow, at turn 8, if y_8=6, collision, but y_8=2 or 1 or 0, all not 6, so no collision at turn 8 regardless of action at turn 7.\n\ny_8 is the position after action, so at turn 8, player is at y_8.\n\nIf y_8=6, collision at turn 8.\n\nBut with actions above, y_8 is 2,1, or 0, not 6, so safe.\n\nThen, we need to go to higher y.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=6 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8 is the only time when y=6 is dangerous.\n\nFor other rows, at other times, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 6 is only dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2-5 dangerous at T=14,15, which is later.\n\nNow, the minimal path: to go from y=1 to y=9, we can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=6 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8 is the next turn.\n\nAt turn 7, we are at y=1.\n\nAfter one action (turn 7), at turn 8, we are at y_8.\n\nWe don't want y_8=6.\n\nBut from y=1, with one action, we can go to y=2 (U), y=1 (S), y=0 (D), none is 6, so y_8 cannot be 6 anyway. So no problem at turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 8, we can take action to go to y_9, and so on.\n\nBut we need to see if at later turns, when we are on other rows, if there is danger.\n\nNow, freeways 2-5 have danger at T=14 and 15.\n\nBut T=14 is turn 14, which is several turns after 7.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn 14, there are 7 turns (t=7 to t=14, that's 8 positions? Let's see: turns t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 8 turns, but positions from y_7 to y_14.\n\ny_7 at turn 7, y_8 at turn 8, ..., y_14 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, if on y=2,3,4, or 5, collision.\n\nSimilarly at turn 15.\n\nBut we might reach y=9 before turn 14.\n\nMinimal time to go from y=1 to y=9: if we go up every turn, after 8 up moves, we reach y=9 at turn 7+8=15? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 7: y=1\n\nAfter a_7=U: turn 8, y=2\n\na_8=U: turn 9, y=3\n\na_9=U: turn 10, y=4\n\na_10=U: turn 11, y=5\n\na_11=U: turn 12, y=6\n\na_12=U: turn 13, y=7\n\na_13=U: turn 14, y=8\n\na_14=U: turn 15, y=9\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=8, and freeways 2-5 have collision at T=14, but y=8 is not 2,3,4,5, so freeway 8 is safe at T=14, as we saw earlier, only collision at T=7 for y=7 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 13, y=7, which is safe for T=13, since only collision at T=7.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 12, y=6, but freeway 6 collision only at T=8, which is past, so at turn 12, y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all seems fine? But at turn 14, y=8, and freeway 8: at T=14, span min = -47 + 48*(14-7) = -47 + 48*7 = -47 + 336 = 289, max=336, both large positive, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nBut is there a faster way? To reach earlier.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves, so at least 8 actions, so from turn 7 to turn 14, we can be at y=9 at turn 15.\n\nWith 8 actions: actions at t=7 to t=14, y at t=15 is 9.\n\nIf we start at t=7 y=1, after first action at t=7, y_8; after second, y_9; ... after k actions, y_{7+k}.\n\nTo have y_{7+k} =9, since y_7=1, we need k up moves, so minimal k=8, so at turn 7+8=15, y=9.\n\nWe can reach at turn 15.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 12, y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut there is a problem: at turn 8, if we were on y=6, but in this sequence, at turn 8, y=2, not 6.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 8, y=2, which is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we are on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nIn the sequence: all U from turn 7 to 14.\n\nt=7: y=1, action U\n\nt=8: y=2, action U\n\nt=9: y=3, action U\n\nt=10: y=4, action U\n\nt=11: y=5, action U\n\nt=12: y=6, action U\n\nAt turn 12, y=6. Now, freeway 6 dangerous only at T=8, which is turn 8, not turn 12, so at turn 12, no car covers x=0 on y=6. Span at T=12: Δt=12-7=5, min= -47 +36*5 = -47+180=133, max=-12+180=168, both >0, so safe.\n\nt=13: y=7, action U\n\nAt turn 13, y=7. Freeway 7 dangerous only at T=7, at T=13, Δt=6, min= -47+48*6= -47+288=241, max=288, safe.\n\nt=14: y=8, action U\n\nTurn 14, y=8. Freeway 8 dangerous only at T=7, at T=14, min= -47+48*7= -47+336=289, max=336, safe.\n\nt=15: y=9, done.\n\nNow, at turn 14, when y=8, and we take action U to go to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nBut freeways 2-5 are dangerous at T=14 and 15, but y=8 is not 2,3,4,5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15, if we were on y=2,3,4,5, but we are at y=9.\n\nSo this sequence seems safe and takes 8 actions: turns t=7 to t=14, reaching at t=15.\n\nBut the question is to minimize H, the number of turns, which should be the number of actions, I think.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, and sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, we reach y=9? Let's see the output.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we are at position after turn t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, position y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart at turn t1=7, position y_7 given.\n\nAfter action a_7, y_8 set.\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} is set to 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions.\n\nIn this case, with H=8, y_{7+8}=y_{15}=9.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nWith H=7 actions, can we have y_{14}=9?\n\ny_{14} is position at turn 14.\n\ny_7=1, to y_{14}=9, we need to increase by 8 in 7 moves? From turn 7 to turn 14, that's 7 actions: a_7 to a_13, setting y_8 to y_14.\n\ny_14 = y_7 + sum of Δy from t=7 to 13.\n\ny_7=1, y_14=9, so net change +8 in 7 moves.\n\nEach move can be +1, -1, 0, so to increase by 8 in 7 moves, we must have all U except one S or D, but if we have one S, net +7, not +8; if one D, net +6, less; so impossible to gain 8 in 7 moves. Max gain is 7 with all U. So y_14 <= 1 + 7 =8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, with H=8 actions, y_{15} can be 9 with all U.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it seems safe, but is there a problem at some point?\n\nEarlier I thought freeway 6 at T=8, but in the sequence, at turn 8, y=2, not 6.\n\nBut what if we go faster or slower.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in H=8, but avoid some rows, but not necessary.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 12, y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut let's check if at turn 8, y=6 is dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: freeways 2-5 at T=14 and 15.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 14, we are at y=8, not on 2-5.\n\nBut if we were slower, we might be on 2-5 at turn 14, but in this case we are faster.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 before turn 15?\n\nNo, as above.\n\nPerhaps with moving down, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo H=8 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=8: collision, so if at turn 8, player on y=6, collision.\n\nBut in our sequence, at turn 8, y=2, not 6.\n\nNow, suppose we want to be on y=6 at some other time, but only T=8 is dangerous, so other times safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the sequence, we pass y=6 at turn 12, which is safe.\n\nBut is there any other danger?\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 only at T=7, so for T>7, safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 13, y=7, safe; turn 14, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, but we have freeways 2,3,4,5 with cars, but they are dangerous only at T=14 and 15.\n\nIf we are on y=2,3,4, or 5 at turn 14 or 15, collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 14, we are at y=8, not on 2-5.\n\nAt turn 15, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut suppose we move slower, for example, if we stay at some point, we might be on y=4 at turn 14, which would be bad.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we go fast, so we avoid that.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly.\n\nAnother thing: the player can go to y=0, but that might delay.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo the all U sequence should work.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nStart at turn 7, y=1.\n\na_7 = U → y_8 = 2\n\na_8 = U → y_9 = 3\n\na_9 = U → y_10 = 4\n\na_10 = U → y_11 = 5\n\na_11 = U → y_12 = 6\n\na_12 = U → y_13 = 7\n\na_13 = U → y_14 = 8\n\na_14 = U → y_15 = 9\n\nNow, check for collision at each turn:\n\nTurn 7: y=1, freeway 1: span at T=7: [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=2, freeway 2: at T=8, Δt=1, span [-53 +6(1), -42 +6(1)] = [-47, -36], min=-47, max=-36, both negative, 0 not in [-47,-36], so safe.\n\nFreeway 2 car: at T=8, τ + s(Δt) = -53 +6(1) = -47, h + s(Δt) = -42 +6 = -36, so span [-47,-36], 0 not in, since -36 <0? -36 is less than 0, so all negative, 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, turn 9: y=3, freeway 3: same as above, at T=9, Δt=2, span [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41,-30], still negative, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=4, freeway 4: T=10, Δt=3, span [-53+18, -42+18] = [-35,-24], negative, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=5, freeway 5: T=11, Δt=4, span [-53+24, -42+24] = [-29,-18], negative, safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=6, freeway 6: T=12, Δt=5, span [-47 +36*5, -12 +36*5] = [-47+180, -12+180] = [133,168], both positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=7, freeway 7: T=13, Δt=6, span [-47 +48*6, 0 +48*6] = [-47+288, 288] = [241,288], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=8, freeway 8: T=14, Δt=7, span [-47+48*7, 48*7] = [-47+336, 336] = [289,336], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at turn 8, freeway 6 is dangerous, but we are on y=2, not y=6.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=8 but different sequence? But this seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 3,4,5 are the same as 2, but we covered.\n\nBut freeway 6 has different car.\n\nIn the sequence, we go through all rows.\n\nBut perhaps we can skip some or something, but not necessary.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we need to go up.\n\nBut one thing: at turn 8, if we were on y=6, it would be bad, but we start from y=1, so we can't be on y=6 at turn 8 with up moves only.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing at turn 7, y_8=1, then we might be slower.\n\nBut in that case, we might be on lower row at turn 14.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn 7: a_7=S, y_8=1\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=2\n\na_9=U, y_10=3\n\n...\n\nup to a_13=U, y_14=6? y_8=1, y_9=2, y_10=3, y_11=4, y_12=5, y_13=6, y_14=7? After 6 actions from turn 8 to 13: let's count.\n\nAt turn 7: y=1, a_7=S → y_8=1\n\na_8=U → y_9=2\n\na_9=U → y_10=3\n\na_10=U → y_11=4\n\na_11=U → y_12=5\n\na_12=U → y_13=6\n\na_13=U → y_14=7\n\na_14=U → y_15=8\n\nNot yet at 9. Need another action to y_15=8, then a_14=U to y_15=9? Messy.\n\nWith delay, it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9, if we start from y=1, need at least 8 up moves, so if we do k stay or down, we need k extra actions.\n\nMinimal is 8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence with all U, we reach in 8 actions.\n\nNow, but in the output, we need to specify the actions from turn 7.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to box the actions.\n\nBut is there any reason to not go all up?\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=5 at turn 14 or something, but in this case, we are not.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, since it is dangerous only at T=8, we can be on y=6 at other times.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=6 at turn 12, which is fine.\n\nBut suppose we go up faster, but we can't, since we start from y=1.\n\nAnother idea: can we go to y=0 to avoid something? But y=0 is safe, but it doesn't help to go up.\n\nFor example, if at some point we move down, we might delay reaching y=9.\n\nNot beneficial.\n\nPerhaps to avoid the future danger at T=14-15 on rows 2-5.\n\nBut since we are going up fast, we are not on those rows at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, we are on y=8.\n\nIf we were slower, say at turn 14, if y=4, then on freeway 4, collision at T=14.\n\nBut in our case, we avoid by being fast.\n\nSo the all U sequence is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 7 and 8.\n\nAt turn 13, y=7, but freeway 7 only dangerous at T=7, so at T=13, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 and 8 both have cars at (0,-47,right,48), so at T=7, they cover x=0.\n\nBut for T>7, they move away.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen y_15=9.\n\nIn the action, a_t for t=7 to 14.\n\nIn the output, it should be from turn t1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, but here t1=7, so actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_7 to a_{14}.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\nBut the turn labels should be as per the problem.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1 is 7.\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 8 actions.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify H.\n\nBut the output is the sequence, and H is minimal.\n\nBut in the box, it's the actions.\n\nNow, but I think we missed something.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 3,4,5 are the same as 2, but we don't care.\n\nBut freeway 6: at turn 8, if on y=6, collision.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are not.\n\nBut suppose we start at y=1, and we do something else.\n\nFor example, if we go up at turn 7 to y=2 at turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=2 is safe, as span for freeway 2 at T=8 is [-47,-36], no 0.\n\nThen we continue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? No.\n\nAnother point: the player can stay on a row to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in less than 8 actions? Impossible, as net +8 needed.\n\nH=8 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps with moving down and up, but that would increase H.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns from 7 to 14.\n\nNow, write the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 8. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn, which takes exactly 8 moves to increase the y-position from 1 to 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is safe at turn 7 (span [49, 60], 0 not in span).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8: Freeway 2 is safe at turn 8 (span [-47, -36], 0 not in span).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 9: Freeway 3 is safe at turn 9 (span [-41, -30], 0 not in span).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 10: Freeway 4 is safe at turn 10 (span [-35, -24], 0 not in span).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11: Freeway 5 is safe at turn 11 (span [-29, -18], 0 not in span).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12: Freeway 6 is safe at turn 12 (span [133, 168], 0 not in span; collision only occurs at turn 8).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 13: Freeway 7 is safe at turn 13 (span [241, 288], 0 not in span; collision only occurs at turn 7).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14: Freeway 8 is safe at turn 14 (span [289, 336], 0 not in span; collision only occurs at turn 7).\n- Finally, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15: No freeway at y=9, so safe.\n\nThis sequence reaches the goal at turn 15 (\\(t_1 + H = 7 + 8 = 15\\)) with no collisions.\n\nThe action sequence for turns 7 to 14 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) on turn t_1 = 9. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you decide an action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCars move continuously. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right. The span is given as [head, tail] or [tail, head] depending on direction, but from the update rule, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] and it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so head decreases. Similarly for right-moving, [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], so head increases.\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, on freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12). Direction is right, so it should be moving right. But the head and tail: -36 and -47, so if direction is right, and it's moving right, the head should be the right end, I think. Let me clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. And it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\". But in the notation, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h, and τ + sΔT, h + sΔT, so if s>0, both increase, so the car moves right. Similarly for left-moving, [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so both decrease.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12). Since direction is right, the span should be [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But in the input, it's given as (head, tail) = (-36, -47), so head is -36, tail is -47. Since direction is right, and right-moving, the head should be the front when moving right, so at position, head is larger than tail? But here, -36 > -47, so head -36, tail -47, so tail is left, head is right, so [tail, head] = [-47, -36], and when moving right, at time T, position is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=3 to y=9, so that's 6 units up. The minimal number of turns if no cars would be 6 turns, all U actions. But with cars, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there is a car such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, the x-position is always 0 for player, so collision when car span covers x=0 at the turn player is on that row.\n\nNow, t_1 = 9 is current turn. Player is at y=3, so on freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nBut at turn t_1, player is at (0,3), so on freeway 3, we need to check if there is collision at turn t_1=9 for freeway 3.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions at turn t=9 for each freeway.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at turn T, span is:\n\nIf direction left: [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nIf direction right: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nt_1 = 9.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span = [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-47 + 12(T-9), -36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car? The table says \"Cars\" but for each freeway, it lists one tuple, so I think only one car per freeway? Let me check.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFreeway 2: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (60,25,right,36)  head=60, tail=25? But 60>25, direction right, so tail=25, head=60? In the tuple it's (head,tail) = (60,25), and direction right, so since moving right, head should be right end, so tail left, head right, so [tail, head] = [25,60]? But 25<60, yes.\n\nAt t_1=9, for freeway 6: direction right, span at T: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [25 + 36(T-9), 60 + 36(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (96,49,right,48) head=96, tail=49, direction right, so [49 + 48(T-9), 96 + 48(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (96,49,right,48) same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, for collision at turn T on freeway k, if 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer is at y=3 at turn t=9. We need to check freeway 3 for collision at t=9.\n\nFreeway 3: car: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span: [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-41 + 6(T-9), -30 + 6(T-9)]\n\nAt T=9, span = [-41 + 0, -30 + 0] = [-41, -30], so x from -41 to -30, all negative, 0 not in [-41,-30], so no collision at t=9 on y=3.\n\nPlayer can take action at t=9 to go to y_{10}.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we need to go up, D is down, which might not help, so probably mostly U and S, but S might be used to wait if there is a car blocking.\n\ny from 3 to 9, difference 6, so min H=6 if no obstacles.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour, but since we can only move vertically, no horizontal move, so we have to go through the freeways.\n\nThe freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, as no cars mentioned.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3, goal y=9.\n\nWe need to move up to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nEach freeway y=1 to 8 might have a car that could be at x=0 at some turn.\n\nWe need to ensure that when the player is on a freeway y at turn T, for that y and T, 0 is not in the car's span on y.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and for each turn T, whether there is a collision risk, i.e., if 0 is in the car span at T.\n\nSince only one car per freeway, we can compute for each freeway k, the times when 0 is covered by the car on k.\n\nFor a freeway with car (h,t,d,s), at time T, the span.\n\nSet ΔT = T - 9, since t_1=9.\n\nFor freeway k=1: d=right, s=12, τ=-47, h=-36? Earlier I used τ and h.\n\nIn the input, for k=1: head=-36, tail=-47, d=right, s=12.\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [tail + s ΔT, head + s ΔT] = [-47 + 12 ΔT, -36 + 12 ΔT]\n\nSet equal to contain 0: -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT\n\nSo -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/12 = 3.9167\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 12 ΔT => 12 ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo ΔT >= 3 and ΔT <= 3.9167, since ΔT integer (turns), so ΔT = 3 or 4? ΔT = T-9, integer.\n\nΔT >=3 and <= 3.9167, so ΔT=3 or ΔT=4? 3.9167, so ΔT<=3 since 4>3.9167? 12*3=36, 12*4=48.\n\nAt ΔT=3: lower bound = -47 + 12*3 = -47 + 36 = -11\n\nUpper bound = -36 + 36 = 0\n\nSo span = [-11, 0] at ΔT=3, which includes 0 since upper bound is 0.\n\n0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <= 0 true, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nAt ΔT=4: lower = -47 + 48 = 1, upper = -36 + 48 = 12, so [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nΔT=3: T-9=3, T=12\n\nΔT=4: T=13, but at T=13, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nNow, for k=1, collision when ΔT=3, T=12.\n\nAt T=12, if player on y=1, collision.\n\nBut y=1 is freeway, player might not be there.\n\nNow freeway k=2: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nhead=-30, tail=-41, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-41 + 6 ΔT, -30 + 6 ΔT]\n\nContain 0: -41 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -30 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst: -41 + 6 ΔT <= 0 => 6 ΔT <= 41 => ΔT <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 + 6 ΔT => 6 ΔT >= 30 => ΔT >= 5\n\nSo ΔT >=5 and ΔT <=6.833, so ΔT=5,6\n\nAt ΔT=5: lower= -41+30= -11, upper= -30+30=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=6: lower= -41+36= -5, upper= -30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 included? -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=7: lower= -41+42=1, upper= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo for k=2, collision at T=14 and T=15? ΔT=5, T=14; ΔT=6, T=15.\n\nt_1=9, ΔT=T-9, so T=9+ΔT.\n\nΔT=5, T=14; ΔT=6, T=15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=3: same as k=2, (-30,-41,right,6), so identical, collision at T=14 and T=15.\n\nFreeway k=4: same, collision at T=14,15.\n\nFreeway k=5: same, collision at T=14,15.\n\nNow freeway k=6: (60,25,right,36)\n\nhead=60, tail=25, d=right, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [25 + 36 ΔT, 60 + 36 ΔT]\n\nContain 0: 25 + 36 ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 36 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 25 + 36 ΔT <= 0? 36 ΔT <= -25, but ΔT >=0, 36ΔT >=0, 25>0, so 25+36ΔT >=25>0, so left inequality never true. Thus 0 cannot be <= lower bound since lower bound >=25>0, so 0 never in span. No collision on k=6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=7: (96,49,right,48)\n\nhead=96, tail=49, d=right, s=48\n\nSpan [49 + 48 ΔT, 96 + 48 ΔT]\n\nLower bound 49 + 48ΔT >=49>0, so 0 never in span. No collision.\n\nFreeway k=8: same as k=7, no collision.\n\nSo only freeways 1,2,3,4,5 have collision risks.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision only at T=12\n\n- Freeways 2,3,4,5: collision at T=14 and T=15\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at t=9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, D might not be useful, but could be to avoid if stuck, but let's see.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=3 to y=9, need to increase by 6, so at least 6 turns.\n\nBut if we go straight up, we might hit a collision time.\n\nLet's list the freeways we need to pass: from y=3 to y=9, we go through y=4,5,6,7,8, and arrive at y=9.\n\nAt each step, we move to a new y at the next turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, after action, to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T only if on y_T, and car on y_T has 0 in span at T.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=3, freeway 3 has car, but at t=9, as computed, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, if player takes action at t=9 to go to y=4 at t=10.\n\ny=4 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 4: car, but freeway 4 collision only at T=14 and 15, so at t=10, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if go to y=5 at t=11, freeway 5 collision at 14,15, so at t=11, safe.\n\nBut let's plan the path.\n\nWe need to be careful around the collision times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 has collision at T=12, on y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is below, we are starting from y=3, going up, so we might not go to y=1, unless we move down, which is inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2-5 have collisions at T=14,15 on y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=3 is where we start, but at t=9, no collision.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 in min turns, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nSuppose we start at t=9, y=3.\n\nAction at t=9: if U, to y=4 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: at t=10, ΔT=1, span for k=4: [-41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at t=10: U to y=5 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, on y=5, span [-41+12, -30+12]? ΔT=11-9=2, for k=5: same, [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: no collision, as we saw, span always positive, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=13.\n\ny=7, freeway 7, no collision, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=14.\n\nNow at t=14, on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: no collision, safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 has car, but no collision as computed.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, on y=8? Let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn t=9: action, to y_{10}\n\nAt turn T, after action, position y_{T+1} is set, but collision at turn T is based on y_T.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At the start of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\n- Then player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with bounds.\n\n- During turn T, player is on y_T, so if on freeway, check if car on y_T has 0 in span at time T.\n\n- Then after action, move to y_{T+1} for next turn.\n\nIn this case:\n\nStart t=9, y_9 = 3.\n\nAt t=9, on y=3, no collision (as above).\n\nChoose a_9: say U, so y_{10} = 4.\n\nNow turn t=10: player at y_10=4.\n\nAt t=10, on y=4, freeway 4 car: at T=10, ΔT=1, span [-41+6*1, -30+6*1] = [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, so y_{11}=5.\n\nt=11: at y=5, on freeway 5, span at T=11, ΔT=2, [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18], no 0, safe.\n\na_11: U, y_{12}=6.\n\nt=12: at y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\na_12: U, y_{13}=7.\n\nt=13: at y=7, freeway 7, no collision, safe.\n\na_13: U, y_{14}=8.\n\nt=14: at y=8, freeway 8, no collision, safe.\n\na_14: U, y_{15}=9.\n\nNow at t=15, player is at y=9, which is the goal, and since y=9 is not a freeway, no car, so no collision to worry.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so at turn t=15, y=9, we are done.\n\nH is the number of turns? The sequence is from t=9 to t=14 for actions, H=6 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H turns, position at t_1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t_1=9, position (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence: actions from t=9 to t=9+H-1, and at turn t=9+H, position y=9.\n\nIn this case, with all U:\n\n- Action at t=9: U, to y=4 at t=10\n\n- t=10: U, to y=5 at t=11\n\n- t=11: U, to y=6 at t=12\n\n- t=12: U, to y=7 at t=13\n\n- t=13: U, to y=8 at t=14\n\n- t=14: U, to y=9 at t=15\n\nSo after 6 actions, at turn t=15, y=9. So H=6.\n\nNow, were there any collisions? We need to check for each turn when player was on a freeway.\n\nt=9: y=3, freeway 3, at T=9, no collision\n\nt=10: y=4, freeway 4, at T=10, ΔT=1, span [-35,-24], no 0\n\nt=11: y=5, freeway 5, at T=11, ΔT=2, span [-29,-18], no 0\n\nt=12: y=6, freeway 6, no collision\n\nt=13: y=7, freeway 7, no collision\n\nt=14: y=8, freeway 8, no collision\n\nt=15: y=9, not freeway, no issue.\n\nBut at t=14, we are on y=8 at turn t=14, but freeway 8 has no collision, as span is positive.\n\nEarlier we have collision risks at other times, but in this path, we didn't encounter them.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 1 collision at T=12, but we were on y=6 at t=12, not y=1.\n\nFreeways 2-5 collision at T=14 and 15, but at t=14, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, no collision, and freeway 2-5 are y=2,3,4,5, we are not on them at t=14.\n\nAt t=15, we are moving to y=9, but at turn t=15, if we were on a freeway, but in this case, at t=15, we are at y=9 after action, but during turn t=15, player is on y_{15}.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn t=14, we are on y=8, take action U, so at turn t=15, player is at y=9.\n\nDuring turn t=15, player is on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car, no collision.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut the collision at T=15 for freeways 2-5, but we are not on those freeways at t=15, since we are on y=9.\n\nSimilarly for t=14, we are on y=8.\n\nSo in this path, no collisions, and we reach in 6 turns.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me confirm the car on freeway 2-5 at t=14.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at T=14: ΔT=14-9=5, span [-41 + 6*5, -30 + 6*5] = [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if player were on y=2 at t=14, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at t=14, we are on y=8, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly at t=15, if on y=2, collision, but we are on y=9.\n\nSo yes, we avoided the collision times.\n\nMoreover, freeway 1 at t=12: if on y=1, collision, but we were on y=6.\n\nSo with all U actions, we can reach in 6 turns without collision.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and 6 seems minimal since we need to move up 6 steps.\n\nPerhaps we can do it faster? No, because each U increases y by 1, and y must be integer, so min 6 turns.\n\nUnless we start at y=3, and go to y=9, difference 6, so at least 6 actions of U or combination, but S or D would not help to go faster, so min H=6.\n\nAnd with the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6,7,8, no collision, so we are fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=12, we are on y=6, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the actions.\n\nBut the player starts at turn t_1=9, position (0,3).\n\nActions: for turn t=9: U, to y=4 at t=10\n\nt=10: U, to y=5 at t=11\n\nt=11: U, to y=6 at t=12\n\nt=12: U, to y=7 at t=13\n\nt=13: U, to y=8 at t=14\n\nt=14: U, to y=9 at t=15\n\nSo actions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U\n\nH=6.\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=9 to t=9+H-1, so t=9 to 14, 6 actions.\n\nNow, in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a9=U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = a10=U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 5: a_{14} = U\n\nt_1=9, so turns: 9,10,11,12,13,14\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to wait, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=11, we are on y=5, which is freeway 5, and at T=11, no collision, as span [-29,-18], not including 0.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4,5 have collision at T=14 and T=15.\n\nAt T=14, if on y=2,3,4, or 5, collision.\n\nIn our path, at t=14, we are on y=8, which is freeway 8, no issue.\n\nAt t=15, we are on y=9, no issue.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? No, because from y=3 to y=9, min 6 moves.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case, 6 is achievable.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1 at T=12, but we are not on it.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not considered on the new y at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nBut in our case, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3, at t=9, we are on it, but no collision.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 3 has the same car as 2,4,5, so at T=14 and 15, collision on y=3.\n\nBut at t=14, we are on y=8, not y=3.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nSo H=6.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 9 to 14.\n\nIn the format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U }\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has (60,25,right,36), which at t=9, span [25,60], but moving right, so at later times, it will be at higher x, but since we only care about x=0, and it starts at min 25>0, so never reaches x=0, similarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have head 96 and 49, both large positive, so no issue.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nMaybe at some turn, if we were to be on a collision point, but we are not.\n\nFor example, suppose we stayed at y=3 for some turns, but that would only increase H, so worse.\n\nOr move down, but that would also increase time to reach y=9.\n\nSo min is 6.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision times again.\n\nFreeway 1: collision only at T=12\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=14 and T=15\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5.\n\nIn our path, we are at:\n\nt=9: y=3, safe\n\nt=10: y=4, safe\n\nt=11: y=5, safe\n\nt=12: y=6, safe\n\nt=13: y=7, safe\n\nt=14: y=8, safe\n\nNo collision at these points.\n\nAt t=15, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with all U actions.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) on turn 9 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The vertical distance from y = 3 to y = 9 is 6 units, requiring at least 6 turns if moving up (U) each turn.\n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (1 to 8) and the car on that freeway covers x = 0 at turn T.\n- Car positions and collision times:\n  - Freeway 1: Collision only at T = 12.\n  - Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5: Collisions at T = 14 and T = 15.\n  - Freeways 6, 7, 8: No collision at any time, as car spans are always positive and never cover x = 0.\n- A sequence of 6 consecutive U actions moves the player from y = 3 to y = 9 in 6 turns:\n  - Turn 9: Start at y = 3, move U to y = 4 at turn 10.\n  - Turn 10: At y = 4, move U to y = 5 at turn 11.\n  - Turn 11: At y = 5, move U to y = 6 at turn 12.\n  - Turn 12: At y = 6, move U to y = 7 at turn 13.\n  - Turn 13: At y = 7, move U to y = 8 at turn 14.\n  - Turn 14: At y = 8, move U to y = 9 at turn 15.\n\n### Collision Check:\n- Turn 9 (y = 3): Freeway 3 car span at T = 9 is [-41, -30], no collision.\n- Turn 10 (y = 4): Freeway 4 car span at T = 10 is [-35, -24], no collision.\n- Turn 11 (y = 5): Freeway 5 car span at T = 11 is [-29, -18], no collision.\n- Turn 12 (y = 6): Freeway 6 has no collision.\n- Turn 13 (y = 7): Freeway 7 has no collision.\n- Turn 14 (y = 8): Freeway 8 has no collision.\n- Turn 15: Player reaches y = 9 (not a freeway, no collision).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in H = 6 turns with no collisions. Since the minimum turns required is 6 (due to the vertical distance), and this sequence is feasible, H = 6 is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 9 to 14 is all U.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for that y, there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, when I move to a new y, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, I care about the car on my current y_T.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, for the freeway I'm on, y_T, if there's a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at turn T, I collide. But since I'm on y_T at turn T, I need to avoid that.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t_1=10, and I need to find actions starting from t_1.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at t_1=10.\n\nFreeway 1: car at (-24, -35, right, 12) so head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed s=12. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] because for right, span is [τ, h] and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\" in the table: freeway 1 to 8 all have \"right\" direction.\n\nFreeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, ..., all right-moving.\n\nBut in the car update, for right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince head h is the front, for right-moving, as time increases, the car moves to the right, so head increases.\n\nIn the description: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nBut here all are right-moving, so for each car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in this span at turn T when I'm on that freeway.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at t=10.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 5, since I need to go up 5 units, so 5 U actions, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nBut let's see if I can go straight up.\n\nFirst, I need to check for each freeway y=1 to 8, when I'm on it, if at that turn, 0 is in the car span for that y.\n\nBut I'm not going to be on all freeways; I start at y=4, and I need to go to y=9, so I'll be on y=4,5,6,7,8,9. But y=9 is the goal, and there are no freeways for y=0 or y=9, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when I'm on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut at the start, I'm on y=4, which is a freeway.\n\nSimilarly, when I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when the car is present at x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, car span at time T: [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] for right-moving cars.\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-10)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ < h, I assume, because tail is behind.\n\nIn freeway 1: h=-24, τ=-35, so τ < h since -35 < -24.\n\nSimilarly all others.\n\nSo for each car, the time when 0 is in span: min = τ + s(T-10), max = h + s(T-10)\n\n0 between min and max, so τ + s(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-10)\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s(T-10) ≤ 0 ⇒ s(T-10) ≤ -τ ⇒ T-10 ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince s>0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ h + s(T-10) ⇒ s(T-10) ≥ -h ⇒ T-10 ≥ -h/s\n\nSo T-10 ≥ ceil(-h/s) ? Since T integer, but inequalities.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 10\n\nThen τ + s ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + s ΔT\n\nSo from left: s ΔT ≤ -τ ⇒ ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nFrom right: 0 ≤ h + s ΔT ⇒ s ΔT ≥ -h ⇒ ΔT ≥ -h/s\n\nSo ΔT must satisfy: -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince τ and h negative, -τ/s and -h/s positive.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12\n\n- h/s = -(-24)/12 = 24/12 = 2\n\n- τ/s = -(-35)/12 = 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nSo ΔT ≥ 2 and ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT=2 or 3?  ΔT ≥ 2 and ΔT ≤ 2.9167, so ΔT=2 or 3? 2.9167, so ΔT <= 2 since 2 <= 2.9167, and ΔT <= floor(2.9167) but inequality.\n\nΔT must be integer, so ΔT >= ceil(-h/s) and ΔT <= floor(-τ/s)? Let's see.\n\nFrom ΔT >= -h/s and ΔT <= -τ/s\n\n- h/s = 2 exactly for freeway 1.\n\n- τ/s = 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nSo ΔT >= 2 and ΔT <= 2.9167\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT <= 2.9167 means ΔT <= 2 because 3 > 2.9167, not satisfied.\n\nΔT <= 2.9167, so possible ΔT=2, since 2 <= 2.9167, and ΔT=3 is 3 > 2.9167? 3 > 2.9167, so ΔT=3 not <= 2.9167, so only ΔT=2.\n\nΔT must satisfy ΔT <= -τ/s = 35/12 ≈ 2.9167, so ΔT <= 2 since ΔT integer, ΔT <= floor(2.9167) = 2? floor is 2, but 2 <= 2.9167 yes, 3>2.9167 no.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT >= -h/s = 2 exactly, so ΔT >= 2.\n\nThus for freeway 1, 0 in span only when ΔT=2, i.e., T=12.\n\nT-10=ΔT, so at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 2: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-24)/6 = 24/6 = 4\n\n- τ/s = -(-35)/6 = 35/6 ≈ 5.8333\n\nSo ΔT >= 4 and ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.8333\n\nThus ΔT = 4,5\n\nT=14 or 15? ΔT=4, T=14; ΔT=5, T=15\n\nT=10 + ΔT, so T=14 or 15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? h=-24, τ=-35, s=6, same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-24,-35,right,6) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nh=-48, τ=-83, s=36\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\n- τ/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈ 2.3056\n\nΔT >= 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ceil(1.333)=2? ΔT >= 1.333, since integer, ΔT >= 2\n\nΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.3056, so ΔT <= 2\n\nThus ΔT=2, T=12\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nh=-48, τ=-95, s=48\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/48 = 48/48 = 1\n\n- τ/s = -(-95)/48 = 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nΔT >= 1 and ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1.979, thus ΔT=1\n\nT=11\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-95,right,48) same as 7, so T=11\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs at x=0:\n\nFreeway 1: only at T=12\n\nFreeway 2: T=14 and T=15\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, T=14,15\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=14,15\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=14,15\n\nFreeway 6: T=12\n\nFreeway 7: T=11\n\nFreeway 8: T=11\n\nNow, I start at t=10, position y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path would be to go up each turn: U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when there is a car at x=0 on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo let's see for each y I might be on.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at t=10, I need to check if at t=10, on y=4, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 4 has car, but when is collision? For freeway 4, collision at T=14 and 15, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, ΔT=0, for freeway 4: min = τ + s*0 = -35, max = h +0 = -24, so [-35,-24], 0 not in, so no collision at t=10 on any freeway, I think.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, for the path: I need to be on y=4 at some turns, y=5, etc., up to y=8, and finally y=9.\n\ny=9 no freeway, safe.\n\nNow, the critical points are when I am on a freeway during the times when car is at x=0.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If I am on freeway 7 or 8 at t=11, collision, since T=11 for them.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 and 6 at t=12, collision.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 at t=14 or 15, collision.\n\nBut I might not be on those freeways at those times if I time my movement.\n\nSince I start at t=10, y=4.\n\nI can choose to move U, D, or S each turn.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least 5, since I need to increase y by 5.\n\nCan I reach in H=5 turns? That means from t=10 to t=14, I go to y=9 at t=14? Let's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position: at the beginning of turn t, I am at (0, y_t).\n\nI perform action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, which is for the next turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the car span at turn T, collision.\n\nFor H turns, I start at t_1, perform actions at t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, I need to not collide when at y_t.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, I am at position y_t, and that's when collision is checked.\n\nAfter last action, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, but since I reached (0,9), and y=9 not freeway, no collision, so we don't care about turn t_1 + H for collision, only for reaching.\n\nSo collision only during turns t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor minimal H, start with H=5.\n\nThen turns: t=10,11,12,13,14\n\nAt t=10, y=4, freeway 4, no car at x=0, as we saw.\n\nAt t=11, if I go up, y=5, or stay, y=4, or down y=3.\n\nBut at t=11, freeway 7 and 8 have car at x=0, so if I am on y=7 or 8 at t=11, collision.\n\nBut at t=11, if I am on y=4 or 5 or something, not 7 or 8, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, freeway 1 and 6 have car, so if on y=1 or 6, collision.\n\nNow, back to H=5 path.\n\nSuppose I go all U: actions at t=10,11,12,13,14\n\nThen:\n\nt=10: a_t=U, so y_{11} = y_{10} +1 =4+1=5\n\nBut at turn t=10, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn t=11, I am at y=5? No.\n\nAt the start of turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn t=10: start with y=4, perform a_{10}, then go to y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy\n\nAt turn t=10, I am at y=4, collision check: freeway 4, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nThen I perform action, say U, so y_{11} =5.\n\nNow turn t=11: I am at y=5, perform a_{11}, go to y_{12}, etc.\n\nAt turn t=11, I am at y=5. Freeway 5, which has car, but at t=11, is there car at x=0?\n\nFor freeway 5, collision at T=14 and 15, not at t=11. At t=11, ΔT=1, for freeway 5: min = τ + s*1 = -35 +6*1 = -35+6= -29? s=6 for freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: τ=-35, s=6, h=-24\n\nAt T=11, ΔT=1, span: [τ + s*1, h + s*1] = [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29, -18], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 at t=11 have car, but I am on y=5, not 7 or 8, so ok.\n\nNow at t=11, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nSuppose I go U again: a_{11}=U, so y_{12} =5+1=6\n\nTurn t=12: I am at y=6.\n\nNow freeway 6 has car at x=0 at t=12, as we computed earlier.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=12, collision, yes.\n\nSo if I am on y=6 at t=12, collision.\n\nBut in this case, at t=12, y=6, and freeway 6 has car at x=0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=6 at t=12.\n\nIn the all U path, at t=12, I am at y=6, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down to not be on y=6 at t=12.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nMaybe delay or something.\n\nSince at t=12, y=6 is bad, I should not be on y=6 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, y=7 or 8 is bad, but I am not there yet.\n\nNow, for H=5, I need to reach y=9 by t=14? After 5 actions, from t=10 to t=14 actions, I am at y_{15} after last action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nStart: turn t=10, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{10}, y_{11} set.\n\nThen turn t=11, y= y_{11}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=10 + k, I am at y_{10+k}.\n\nI want y_{10+H} =9 after H actions.\n\nAnd for turns t from 10 to 10+H-1, I need safe position.\n\nFor H=5, I want y_{15} =9.\n\nAnd turns t=10 to 14 need to be safe.\n\ny_t for t=10,11,12,13,14.\n\nAt t=14, y= y_{14}, and after a_{14}, y_{15}=9.\n\nNow, in all U:\n\nt=10: y=4, safe\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, safe as above\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\nt=12: y=6, but freeway 6 collision at t=12, unsafe\n\nSo stuck.\n\nTo avoid, at t=11, instead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 by t=15? y15=9.\n\nIf at t=11, I stay, a11=S, then y12=5 (same as y11)\n\nt=11: y=5, safe\n\na11=S, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, freeway 5, at t=12, ΔT=2, min= τ + s*2 = -35 +12= -23? s=6, -35 +12= -23? 2*6=12, -35+12=-23, max=h + s*2= -24 +12= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, y=5, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up, but I have only 3 actions left? From t=12 to t=14 actions to reach y15=9.\n\nCurrently at t=12, y=5.\n\nAfter a12, y13; a13, y14; a14, y15.\n\nI need y15=9, from y12=5, I need to go up 4 times, but only 3 actions, impossible with U only, since +4 in 3 steps max +3 if all U, so y15=8 max if start from y12=5.\n\ny12=5, after a12: y13 <=6, a13: y14<=7, a14: y15<=8, so at most y15=8, not 9. So cannot reach y=9 in 3 actions from y=5.\n\nIf I go down at some point, it takes more steps.\n\nSo with H=5, if I stay at t=11, I cannot reach y=9 by t=15.\n\nIf I go down at t=11, worse.\n\nSo H=5 is impossible because at t=12, y=6 is dangerous, and if I avoid it by staying or down, I lose progress and cannot reach in 5 turns.\n\nThus minimal H must be at least 6.\n\nNow H=6: I want y_{16}=9, and turns t=10 to 15 safe.\n\nActions at t=10 to 15, 6 actions.\n\nI need net +5 in y, so possible with some S or D, but D would require more U later, so probably mostly U.\n\nNow, critical times: t=11: avoid y=7 and y=8\n\nt=12: avoid y=1 and y=6? Freeway 1 at t=12, and freeway 6 at t=12.\n\nAlso t=14 and 15: avoid y=2,3,4,5? Freeway 2,3,4,5 have collision at t=14 and 15.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at t=10.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by t=16.\n\nLet me list the unsafe (y,t) pairs:\n\n- At t=11: y=7 and y=8 unsafe\n\n- At t=12: y=1 and y=6 unsafe\n\n- At t=14: y=2,3,4,5 unsafe? Freeway 2,3,4,5 all unsafe at t=14 and t=15.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: each has collision at t=14 and t=15, so for any of these y, at t=14 or 15, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, y=7 or 8 unsafe.\n\nAt t=12, y=1 or 6 unsafe.\n\nOther times and other y are safe, as long as no car at x=0.\n\nFor example, y=1: only unsafe at t=12, because freeway 1 only at t=12.\n\nSimilarly y=6 only at t=12.\n\ny=7 only at t=11, etc.\n\nNow, since I start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, I will pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I can stay or move slowly.\n\nNow for H=6, turns t=10 to 15.\n\nt=10: I am at y=4, which is safe (t=10 not critical for y=4)\n\nAt t=10, y=4: freeway 4, at ΔT=0, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions to avoid the unsafe points.\n\nFirst, at t=11, I should not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSince I am at y=4 at t=10, at t=11 I can be at y=3,4,5 depending on action at t=10.\n\nIf a10=U, y11=5\n\na10=S, y11=4\n\na10=D, y11=3\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt t=11, if I am on y=5, it is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\ny=4 also safe, y=3: freeway 3, at t=11, ΔT=1, min= τ +s*1= -35+6= -29, max=h+s*1=-24+6=-18, [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, similar, safe at t=11.\n\ny=1: at t=11, freeway 1: ΔT=1, min= τ+s*1= -35+12= -23? s=12 for y=1, τ=-35, h=-24, min= -35+12= -23, max=-24+12=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nOnly specific times unsafe.\n\nSo at t=11, all y except 7 and 8 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, except y=1 and 6, all safe.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at t=16, so after 6 actions.\n\nI can go up most of the time.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=6 at t=12, for example.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14 and 15, I need to not be on y=2,3,4,5, but since I am going up, by t=14 I might be higher.\n\nLet's see the time.\n\nt=10: y=4\n\nt=11: y=?\n\nt=12: y=?\n\netc.\n\nSince at t=12, y=6 is bad, I should make sure that at t=12, I am not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, not on y=7 or 8, but I am low, so not issue.\n\nNow, if I go up directly, at t=10: a10=U, y11=5\n\nt=11: I am at y=5, safe.\n\nNow at t=11, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go U, y12=6, but at t=12, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I should not go U at t=11.\n\nI could go S or D.\n\nIf a11=S, then y12=5\n\nThen at t=12, y=5, which is freeway 5, and at t=12, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5: at t=12, ΔT=2, min= τ + s*2 = -35 + 12 = -23? s=6, -35 + 12 = -23, max = h + s*2 = -24 + 12 = -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=12, y=5, safe.\n\nNow I need to go to y=9 by t=16.\n\nFrom t=12, y=5, after 4 actions (t=12,13,14,15), I need y16=9, so +4 in 4 steps, possible with all U.\n\nBut at t=14 and t=15, y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe if I am on them.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 2,3,4,5 unsafe at t=14 and 15.\n\nSo if I go all U from t=12:\n\nt=12: y=5, safe (as above)\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, now freeway 6, but at t=13, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6: collision only at t=12, as we computed earlier.\n\nAt t=13, ΔT=3, min= τ + s*3 = -83 + 36*3 = -83 + 108 = 25? τ=-83, s=36\n\nmin = τ + s ΔT = -83 + 36*3 = -83 + 108 = 25\n\nmax = h + s ΔT = -48 + 108 = 60\n\nspan [25,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times safe except t=12.\n\nSo at t=13, y=6 safe.\n\nThen a13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, freeway 7, at t=14, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7: collision at t=11 only, as computed.\n\nAt t=14, ΔT=4, min= τ + s*4 = -95 + 48*4 = -95 + 192 = 97\n\nmax = h + s*4 = -48 + 192 = 144, span [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same.\n\nNow, but at t=14, y=7 is safe, but freeway 2,3,4,5 unsafe at t=14, but I am on y=7, not those, so ok.\n\nThen a14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, freeway 8, at t=15, ΔT=5, min= τ + s*5 = -95 + 48*5 = -95 + 240 = 145\n\nmax = h + s*5 = -48 + 240 = 192, [145,192], 0 not in, safe. (collision only at t=11)\n\nThen a15=U, y16=9, reached.\n\nBut I need to check at t=15, y=8 is safe, yes.\n\nNow, what about t=14? I have y=7 at t=14, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=14 or 15 with other y? No, because I'm not on them.\n\nIn this path: from t=12 y=5, I go U to y13=6, U to y14=7, U to y15=8, U to y16=9.\n\nBut at t=14, I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nt=15 at y=8, safe.\n\nBut I need to go back to the beginning.\n\nAt t=10: y=4, a10=U, y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, a11=S (stay), y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, a12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, a13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, a14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, a15=U, y16=9\n\nNow, check all turns for safety:\n\nt=10: y=4, freeway 4, ΔT=0, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11: y=5, freeway 5, ΔT=1, min=-35+6=-29, max=-24+6=-18, [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=12: y=5, freeway 5, ΔT=2, min=-35+12=-23, max=-24+12=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=13: y=6, freeway 6, ΔT=3, min=-83+108=25, max=-48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=14: y=7, freeway 7, ΔT=4, min=-95+192=97, max=-48+192=144, [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=15: y=8, freeway 8, ΔT=5, min=-95+240=145, max=-48+240=192, [145,192], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAll safe, and y16=9.\n\nH=6 turns: actions at t=10 to 15.\n\nIn the sequence: a10=U, a11=S, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U.\n\nBut is this minimal? Earlier I thought H=5 impossible, so yes, H=6 is achievable.\n\nBut in this, I have one S action, which is fine.\n\nCould I have no S and still H=6? For example, if I go down and up, but that might take more steps.\n\nBut here H=6 is fine.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nSuppose at t=11, instead of staying, I go up to y=6, but at t=12, y=6 is bad.\n\nIf I go down at t=11 to y=4, then at t=12, y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=12: freeway 4, ΔT=2, min=-35+12=-23, max=-24+12=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=12, I need to reach y=9 by t=16, which requires +5 in 4 actions: possible with all U: a12=U, y13=5; a13=U, y14=6; a14=U, y15=7; a15=U, y16=8, only y=8, not 9. Oh, y16=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 4 actions from t=12 to t=15, y16= something, but I need y16=9.\n\nStart from t=12, y=4.\n\nAfter a12, y13; a13, y14; a14, y15; a15, y16.\n\nWith all U: y13=5, y14=6, y15=7, y16=8 <9, not reach.\n\nWith one extra up, but only 4 actions, max y16=8.\n\nSo I need to be higher earlier.\n\nIf I go up at t=10 and t=11, but at t=11, if I go U, y12=6, which is bad at t=12.\n\nUnless I can be at y=6 at a different time.\n\nBut at t=12, y=6 is unsafe, so I must avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=7 before t=11 or after, but at t=11, y=7 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=7 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems fine.\n\nAnother idea: go down first to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=10, go D to y=3, then t=11 y=3, safe; then go up, but I need more steps to go up.\n\nFor H=6, I can reach as above.\n\nIn my sequence: a10=U, a11=S, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U\n\nWith y: t10:4, t11:5 (after a10=U), at t11 y=5, a11=S, so y12=5, t12 y=5, a12=U, y13=6, t13 y=6, a13=U, y14=7, t14 y=7, a14=U, y15=8, t15 y=8, a15=U, y16=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTo save a turn, but H=5 not possible, so this should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with no S, but with D or something, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=10, go U to y=5.\n\nt=11: instead of S, go D to y=4, but then at t=11 y=4, which is safe, a11=D, y12=4.\n\nThen t=12 y=4, as above, then I need to go to y=9 in 4 actions, impossible as before.\n\nAt t=11, go U to y=6, but at t=12, y=6 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo my sequence seems good.\n\nNow, but I have freeway 2,3,4,5 unsafe at t=14 and 15, but in my path, at t=14 I am at y=7, not 2-5, and at t=15 y=8, not 2-5, so fine.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns t=10 to t=15.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the sequence, a11 is S, which is stay.\n\nBut is there a way without stay? For example, if I go up later.\n\nSuppose at t=10, I stay: a10=S, y11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, safe\n\nThen a11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe as before\n\nThen same as before, I need to go up to y=9 in 4 actions from y=5 at t=12, impossible to reach y=9 by t=16? From t=12 y=5, with actions at t=12,13,14,15, y16= at most 8, as before.\n\nIf I start by going up faster.\n\nAt t=10, U to y=5.\n\nt=11, I cannot go U because y=6 at t=12 bad.\n\nUnless I go to y=7 at t=11, but at t=11, y=7 is bad, collision.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=11 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=6 at t=12.\n\nSo I must be at y<=5 at t=12, I think.\n\nAt t=12, I can be on y=5, which is safe as we saw.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=12 I am at y=5, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=6 at t=13 or other times.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it works.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go up to y=5 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, y=5, instead of staying, I could go down, but that wastes.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think H=6 with one stay is fine.\n\nNow, in the car state, freeway 6 has a car, but in my path at t=13 I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me write it clearly.\n\nMinimal H: 6 turns.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the player position is (0,4) at turn t_1=10.\n\nAnd I reach (0,9) at turn 16, after 6 actions.\n\nNow, for the collision note: when I move to a new y, I am not on it until next turn, which I accounted for.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can check if H=5 is possible with different moves.\n\nSuppose I go up at t=10 to y=5.\n\nThen at t=11, I must not be on y=6 at t=12, so I stay at y=5, but then as before, cannot reach in time.\n\nIf at t=11 I go down to y=4, then at t=12 y=4, then need +5 in 3 actions: impossible.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 6. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on a freeway \\(y\\) at a turn \\(T\\) where a car on that freeway has position 0 within its span, thus avoiding collisions.\n\nThe unsafe turns and freeways are:\n- At turn 11: freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe (cars present at x=0).\n- At turn 12: freeways 1 and 6 are unsafe (cars present at x=0).\n- At turns 14 and 15: freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are unsafe (cars present at x=0).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid these unsafe states:\n- At turn 10, move up to y=5 (safe, as freeway 4 has no car at x=0 at turn 10).\n- At turn 11, stay at y=5 (safe, as freeway 5 has no car at x=0 at turn 11, and y=7 and y=8 are avoided).\n- At turn 12, move up to y=6 (but at turn 12, the player is at y=5, which is safe, as freeway 5 has no car at x=0 at turn 12).\n- At turn 13, move up to y=7 (safe, as freeway 6 has no car at x=0 at turn 13).\n- At turn 14, move up to y=8 (safe, as freeway 7 has no car at x=0 at turn 14, and freeways 2-5 are avoided).\n- At turn 15, move up to y=9 (safe, as freeway 8 has no car at x=0 at turn 15, and freeways 2-5 are avoided).\n\nAfter the action at turn 15, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 16. The collision checks for turns 10 to 15 are all safe, as verified below:\n\n- Turn 10: y=4, freeway 4, car span at ΔT=0: [-35, -24], 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 11: y=5, freeway 5, car span at ΔT=1: [-29, -18], 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 12: y=5, freeway 5, car span at ΔT=2: [-23, -12], 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 13: y=6, freeway 6, car span at ΔT=3: [25, 60], 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 14: y=7, freeway 7, car span at ΔT=4: [97, 144], 0 not in span → safe.\n- Turn 15: y=8, freeway 8, car span at ΔT=5: [145, 192], 0 not in span → safe.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,5) at turn t1=12 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn. The note says that when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on row y_T, and you decide an action to go to y_{T+1}. But for collision, it's based on where you are at turn T, so y_T determines which freeway you're on for collision check at turn T.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the car spans are given for turn t1=12, and we need to compute them for future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nGiven car states at t1=12:\n\n- Freeway 1: car with head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=12\n\n- Freeway 2: head=-12, tail=-23, direction=right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2? head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6\n\n- Freeway 4: same\n\n- Freeway 5: same\n\n- Freeway 6: head=24, tail=-11, right, speed=36? That seems odd. Head=24, tail=-11, but direction right, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the span definition.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so h - s(T-t1), etc.\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume, since it says [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn freeway 6: head=24, tail=-11, direction right. But for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so probably τ is the left end, h is the right end. Here head=24, tail=-11, so if direction is right, τ should be the tail, left end, h head right end, so [τ, h] = [-11, 24]? But it says (head, tail) in the table, so for freeway 6: (head, tail) = (24, -11), direction right.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 6, direction right, so at time t1, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]? But it says head=24, tail=-11, so if tail is τ and head is h, and right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-11, 24].\n\nBut τ = -11, h=24, so [ -11, 24 ].\n\nThen at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 36(T-12), 24 + 36(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: head=48, tail=1, direction right, speed=48. So span at t1: [τ, h] = [1, 48] for right-moving? Tail=1, head=48, so [1,48].\n\nAt T: [1 + 48(T-12), 48 + 48(T-12)]\n\nNow, collision happens at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car span at that turn.\n\nWe start at turn t1=12, y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H and sequence of actions.\n\nSince we can only move up, down, or stay, and we start at 5, need to go to 9, so we need to move up at least 4 times. But we might have to avoid cars, so we might need to stay or move down sometimes to wait for safe passage.\n\nThe actions are per turn, and we move at each turn.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence: {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions? t=0 to H-1, that's H actions, leading to H turns? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,5). Then we perform action a_{t1} which determines y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t1 + H -1} which gets us to y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, action at time t1, which affects position at t1+1? No.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we perform action a_t, which changes y from y_t to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T means at the time we are at y_T, we check for cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T, and only check cars for freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check for that freeway.\n\nWe start at turn t1=12, y=5.\n\nWe need to find H and actions such that at some turn, y =9.\n\nThe sequence ends when y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, which correspond to times t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, after k actions, we are at turn t1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y=5.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y= y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9, so we need to perform H actions to reach turn t1+H with y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, we are at turn t1+H with y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nMinimal H, meaning fewest actions to reach y=9 safely.\n\nSince we need to go from 5 to 9, minimum 4 up moves, so H at least 4, if no delays.\n\nBut with cars, we might need more.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collision at each turn we are on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8, so when we are at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nWe start at y=5, which is a freeway, so we need to check if at turn t1=12, on freeway 5, is there a car collision.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's check the current state at t1=12.\n\nPlayer at y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars: head=-12, tail=-23, direction right, speed=6.\n\nSince direction right, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with τ=tail, h=head.\n\nHere tail τ = -23? Head h = -12? In the table: for freeway 5, (head, tail) = (-12, -23), direction right.\n\nSo τ = tail = -23, h = head = -12? But usually head is the front, so for right-moving, if moving right, head should be on the right, but here head=-12, tail=-23, so since both negative, -12 > -23, so head is at -12, tail at -23, so the car is from -23 to -12? Let's see the span.\n\nAt t1, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-23, -12]? But it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, and τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the initial description: \"for car k, head at h, tail at τ\", and for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 5 at t1=12: head h = -12, tail τ = -23, direction right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [-23 + 6(T-12), -12 + 6(T-12)]\n\nNow, collision at turn T if player on freeway y_T, and 0 in span at T.\n\nAt turn t1=12, y=5, freeway 5, is 0 in span at T=12?\n\nSpan at T=12: [-23 + 6(0), -12 + 6(0)] = [-23, -12], which is from -23 to -12, so 0 not in [-23,-12], since 0 > -12? -12 is less than 0, -23 < -12 < 0, so [-23,-12] is all negative, 0 not included. So no collision at t=12.\n\nGood, we start safely.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once we reach y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut to reach there, we need to pass through freeways 6,7,8 or go directly, but since we can only change by ±1 or 0, we must go through intermediate rows.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their car spans over time.\n\nt1=12 is the starting point.\n\nFor any turn T, we can compute the span for each freeway.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and time increases, we need to find a path in time and row.\n\nEach turn, we choose action, which changes row, and time increases.\n\nWe start at (t=12, y=5)\n\nWe need to reach some (t, y=9) with t >=12.\n\nCollision if at (t,y), for that y, 0 is in the car span at time t.\n\nSince cars move horizontally, and we are fixed at x=0, we care about whether 0 is covered by some car on row y at time t.\n\nFor each freeway k, and time T, we can find if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut each freeway has one car, as per the table.\n\nIn the table, for each freeway, there is one car listed, I think, since it says \"cars\" but only one entry per row, so one car per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, freeway 2: one car, etc.\n\nSo for each row, there is one car moving.\n\nNow, for a given row k and time T, we can compute if 0 is in the car span.\n\nIf not, then that (k,T) is safe for the player to be on row k at time T.\n\nWe need to find a sequence from (t=12, y=5) to some (t, y=9), with each step moving to adjacent row or same, and at each point (t,y), if y between 1 and 8, it must be safe, i.e., no car covering x=0 at that time.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, define the span for each car at time T relative to t1=12.\n\nSet τ = T - 12, so τ=0 at t=12.\n\nThen for each freeway, the span at time T=12 + τ is:\n\nFreeway 1: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [tail + s τ, head + s τ] = [-11 + 12 τ, 0 + 12 τ] = [12τ -11, 12τ]\n\nFor 0 to be in span: 12τ -11 <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nWhich is: 12τ -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 12τ\n\nSince τ integer (turns discrete), τ >=0.\n\n0 <= 12τ always true for τ>=0.\n\n12τ -11 <=0 ⇒ 12τ <=11 ⇒ τ <= 11/12 <1, so τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, 12(0)-11 = -11 <=0 <=0, yes.\n\nAt τ=1, 12(1)-11=1 >0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <=12τ is true, but 12τ -11 <=0? 12-11=1 <=0? 1>0, false, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly for higher τ.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at τ=0, i.e., t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, we are on y=5, not y=1, so no issue.\n\nFreeway 2: head=-12, tail=-23, direction right, speed=6\n\nSpan: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-23 + 6τ, -12 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6τ <= 0 <= -12 +6τ\n\nSo -23 +6τ <=0 ⇒ 6τ <=23 ⇒ τ <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so τ<=3\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +6τ ⇒ 6τ >=12 ⇒ τ >=2\n\nSo τ=2,3\n\nAt τ=2: -23+12= -11 <=0? 0 <= -12+12=0, yes, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt τ=3: -23+18= -5 <=0, 0 <= -12+18=6, yes.\n\nτ=4: -23+24=1 <=0? 1>0 false, not.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=2,3, t=12+2=14, t=15.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6, so same as freeway 2, unsafe at t=14,15.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6, so unsafe at t=14,15.\n\nFreeway 5: same as above, head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6, so unsafe at t=14,15.\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car? No, different rows, but same parameters, so yes, for each, unsafe at t=14 and t=15.\n\nt=12+τ, τ=2,3 so t=14,15.\n\nNow freeway 6: head=24, tail=-11, direction right, speed=36\n\nSpan: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-11 + 36τ, 24 + 36τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 +36τ <=0 <= 24 +36τ\n\n-11 +36τ <=0 ⇒ 36τ <=11 ⇒ τ <=11/36 <1, so τ=0\n\n0 <=24+36τ always true for τ>=0.\n\nAt τ=0: -11 <=0 <=24, true.\n\nτ=1: -11+36=25 <=0? 25>0 false, not.\n\nSo unsafe only at τ=0, t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, we are on y=5, not y=6.\n\nNow freeway 7: head=48, tail=1, direction right, speed=48\n\nSpan: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ]\n\n0 in span if 1+48τ <=0 <=48+48τ\n\nBut 1+48τ >=1 >0 for τ>=0, so 1+48τ <=0 false. Thus never unsafe, since left end >=1 >0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same, head=48, tail=1, right, speed=48, span [1+48τ, 48+48τ], left end >=1, so 0 never in span. Always safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are always safe? Let's confirm.\n\nAt any τ, min of span is 1+48τ >=1 >0, so 0 not <= min, and since it's a closed interval I assume, 0 not in [1+48τ, 48+48τ] as lower bound >0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow freeway 1: unsafe only at t=12\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at t=12\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: unsafe at t=14 and t=15\n\nFreeway 7,8: always safe\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, unsafe at t=12\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, unsafe at t=12\n\nBut at t=12, we are on y=5, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 are always safe, rows y=7 and y=8 have no cars covering x=0 at any time, so we can be there anytime safely.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=1 to 6 have unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- y=1: unsafe only at t=12\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=14,15\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=14,15\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=14,15\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=14,15\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at t=12\n\nNow, we start at t=12, y=5.\n\nAt t=12, y=5 is safe, as we checked.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, we can go to them directly if possible.\n\nBut to get to y=7, we need to go through y=6 or from y=5 to y=6, then to y=7.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=12, but we can go later.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is unsafe at t=14,15, so we need to avoid being on y=5 at t=14 or 15.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4.\n\nNow, we are at (t=12, y=5)\n\nWe want to go up to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up at t=12, to y=6 at t=13.\n\nBut at t=12, we are on y=5, safe.\n\nAction at t=12: if a_t=U, then y_{13} = y_{12} +1 =6\n\nAt t=13, we are on y=6? At turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=12, we are at y=5.\n\nWe choose action a_{12}, which determines y_{13}.\n\nThen at turn t=13, we are at y_{13}, and so on.\n\nNow, at t=13, if we are on y=6, we need to check if safe.\n\ny=6 is unsafe only at t=12, not at t=13, since only unsafe at τ=0.\n\nt=13 is τ=1, which for y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at t=13, it should be safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=7 at t=14, and so on.\n\nBut at t=14, if we are on y=7, it is safe, since y=7 always safe.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nOption 1: Go up directly.\n\nAt t=12: start at y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_{12}: U, then y_{13} = 5 +1 =6\n\nAt t=13: y=6, now check safety: y=6, t=13.\n\nτ = t-12 =1, for freeway 6, span at τ=1: [-11 +36(1), 24+36(1)] = [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_{13}: U, then y_{14} =6+1=7\n\nAt t=14: y=7, freeway 7 always safe, so ok.\n\nAction a_{14}: U, then y_{15} =7+1=8\n\nAt t=15: y=8, safe.\n\nAction a_{15}: U, then y_{16} =8+1=9, reached.\n\nSo in 4 actions: U at t=12, U at t=13, U at t=14, U at t=15, reaching y=9 at t=16.\n\nH=4 actions? Sequence from t=12 to t=15, 4 actions, y from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9 at t=16.\n\nt: 12 y=5\n\na12: U, t13 y=6\n\na13: U, t14 y=7\n\na14: U, t15 y=8\n\na15: U, t16 y=9\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nAt t=12: y=5, safe as before.\n\nt=13: y=6, safe as above.\n\nt=14: y=7, freeway 7, span at t=14: τ=14-12=2, [1 +48*2, 48+48*2] = [1+96,48+96]=[97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=15: y=8, similar, [1+48*3,48+48*3]=[1+144,48+144]=[145,192], safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=14 and t=15, we are on y=7 and y=8, which are safe, but what about y=5? At t=14, if someone were there, but we are not on y=5 at t=14.\n\nIn this path, we are never on rows 2,3,4, etc., and we avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=5, unsafe at t=14,15, but we are not on y=5 at those times; we left at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe only at t=12, but we are on it at t=13, safe.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=4 actions, from t=12 to t=15, reaching t=16 y=9.\n\nBut we started at t=12 y=5, after 4 up moves, we should be at y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=14, y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe, but we are on y=7, fine.\n\nSimilarly t=15 same.\n\nIs there a way with H=3? To go from y=5 to y=9 in 3 moves: need to increase by 4, so must do U each time, no down or stay.\n\nSo sequence: a12:U, y13=6\n\na13:U, y14=7\n\na14:U, y15=8\n\nThen y15=8, not 9. After 3 actions, at t=15, y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need one more action to U to y=9 at t=16.\n\nWith 3 actions, we can be at y=8 at t=15.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9, so minimum 4 actions to go from 5 to 9.\n\nUnless we start from y=5, after one U, y=6 at t=13; after two U, y=7 at t=14; after three U, y=8 at t=15; after four U, y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo H=4 is minimum possible, since we need to gain 4 units.\n\nAnd in this sequence, it seems safe.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=14, y=7, safe; but is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: at t=14, if we were on y=5, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we go directly up to 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6 at t=13 is safe, as we have.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo H=4 should be achievable.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 6 at t=13.\n\nt=13, τ=1, freeway 6: span [-11 +36(1), 24+36(1)] = [25,60], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the car on freeway 6 has speed 36, which is high, so it moves fast, and at t=12, it was covering x=0, but at t=13, it has moved to [25,60], far away.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, what about freeway 1? But we never go to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2-5 unsafe at t=14,15, but we are on y=7 and 8 then.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but they never cover x=0, as we saw.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: at t=12, span [1,48], at t=13, [1+48,48+48]=[49,96], etc., all min >=1, so never 0.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U   (t1=12)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U  (t=13)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U  (t=14)\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U  (t=15)\n\nAfter that, at t=16, y=9.\n\nH=4.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so actions at t=12,13,14,15.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the sequence, it should be written as Turn t_1: U, Turn t_1 +1: U, etc.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nIs there any reason why this might not work?\n\nAt t=14, we are on y=7, which is freeway 7, and car is at [1+48*(14-12), ...] t=14, τ=2, [1+96,48+96]=[97,144], fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if moving affects, but I think it's fine.\n\nAnother path: suppose we stay at t=12, but that would delay, not better.\n\nOr go down, but that would take more steps to go up later.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=4, but y=4 is unsafe at t=14,15, and we might need to avoid that.\n\nBut unnecessary.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=15, we do U to y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,5) at turn t1=12.\n\nAfter action a12, to y=6 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=6, position (0,6), and check freeway 6 at t=13: as above, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list all unsafe times for each row.\n\nRows:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=12\n\ny=2: unsafe t=14,15\n\ny=3: unsafe t=14,15\n\ny=4: unsafe t=14,15\n\ny=5: unsafe t=14,15\n\ny=6: unsafe t=12\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: always safe\n\nWe start at (t=12,y=5), safe.\n\nWe can go to (t=13,y=6), safe since y=6 unsafe only t=12.\n\nThen (t=14,y=7), safe.\n\n(t=15,y=8), safe.\n\nThen (t=16,y=9), reached.\n\nIf we go to (t=13,y=5) by staying, but then at t=13 y=5, is it safe?\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=14,15, but at t=13, τ=1, freeway 5: span at τ=1: [-23 +6(1), -12 +6(1)] = [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -17<= -6 <0, so safe at t=13.\n\nBut if we stay, we delay, not better.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nSo minimal is 4 turns.\n\nThus the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nSo for t_1=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U }\n\nH=4.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 6.\n\nAt t=12, span [-11,24], includes 0.\n\nBut we are not on it at t=12.\n\nAt t=13, [25,60], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps the direction or something, but I think correct.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(12\\).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 4, requiring at least 4 \"U\" (up) actions, as each \"U\" increases \\(y\\) by 1, and \"D\" or \"S\" would increase the number of turns.\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n- Based on the car states at \\(t_1 = 12\\), the unsafe times for each freeway are:\n  -

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, player starts at (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical movement is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on row y. Only at the next turn (if moving) will the player be on row y'. Therefore, we only check the freeway corresponding to the current row at each turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 13) until we reach row 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 13. We are going to simulate turns: turn 13, 14, 15, ... until we get to row 9.\n\nThe car state at turn t1 (13) is given. We need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nEach car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation for left and right moving:\n\n- Right-moving: the car moves to the right. At time t, the span is [tau, h] (with tau < h). Then at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)].\n- Left-moving: the car moves to the left. At time t, the span is [h, tau] (with h < tau). Then at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t), tau - s*(T-t)].\n\nBut note: in the given state, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll the cars in the table have direction \"right\". So they are all right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for a car at turn t0=13 with span (head, tail) and direction right, the span at turn T (>=13) is:\n\n  [tail + s*(T-13), head + s*(T-13)]\n\nWe must check if the player is on freeway k at turn T and if 0 is in the interval [tail + s*(T-13), head + s*(T-13)].\n\nBut note: the head and tail at turn 13 are given. For example:\n\nFreeway 1: (head=12, tail=1, right, speed=12)\n\nAt turn T, the car on freeway 1 will be at:\n\n  tail_T = 1 + 12*(T-13)\n  head_T = 12 + 12*(T-13)\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [tail_T, head_T] (which is a closed interval? I assume so).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the player starts at row 6 at turn 13. We need to plan actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). Note that the player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: reach row 9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns including the starting turn? or the number of actions?).\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and a sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1. So H is the total number of turns from the start until the turn when we are at row 9. For example, if we start at turn 13 and at turn 13 we are at row 6, then at turn 14 we are at row 7, then at turn 15 we are at row 8, then at turn 16 we are at row 9 -> then H=4 (turns 13,14,15,16) and we output actions for turns 13,14,15.\n\nNote: at turn 16 we are at row 9 and we stop. We don't need an action for turn 16 because we have already reached at the beginning of turn 16? Actually, we need to output actions until the last action that gets us to row 9. The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after H turns (starting at t1) we are at row 9.\n\nSo the actions are for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at row 9.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (13) at row 6. We take action at turn 13 to move to row 7,6, or stay at 6? Then at turn 14 we are at that row, and so on.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 13 until the last turn (which is turn 13+H-1). Note that at the last turn we are at row 9, and row 9 is not a freeway? The freeways are from 1 to 8. So row 9 is safe (no cars). Also row 0 is safe? But we are starting at 6 and going up, so we don't want to go to row 0.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are on row 0 or row 9, no collision check.\n\nSo the only rows we need to worry are 1 to 8.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway (row) and compute when they are dangerous (i.e., when 0 is in their span).\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) the intervals of time (turns) during which the car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nFor freeway k, the car is given at turn 13. We compute the span at time T (integer) as:\n\n  [tail + s*(T-13), head + s*(T-13)]   (for right-moving)\n\nWe want to know for which T, 0 is in that interval.\n\nSo:\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-13)\n\nSolving for T:\n\n   (0 - head) / s <= T-13 <= (0 - tail) / s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving right, the tail is less than the head. Also, the speed s is positive.\n\nHowever, we have to be cautious because the interval might not be integer? But T is integer, so we can compute the integer T that satisfy the inequality.\n\nBut note: the span is continuous, but we are only checking at integer T. So we can compute the real numbers and then check the integer T in the interval.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the exact T_min and T_max for which 0 is in the span.\n\nLet me define for a car:\n\n   A = (0 - head) / s + 13\n   B = (0 - tail) / s + 13\n\nThen the car covers 0 for T in [A, B] (if A<=B). But since the car is moving to the right, and tail < head, then (0-head)/s <= (0-tail)/s, so A <= B.\n\nBut note: the car might not be present at non-integer T? We are only concerned with integer T.\n\nSo the set of dangerous turns T (integer) for freeway k is:\n\n   T_min = ceil(A)   ? Actually, we need to check:\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-13)\n\nWe can rearrange:\n\n   T >= (0 - head)/s + 13   and   T <= (0 - tail)/s + 13\n\nBut note: because the car is moving right, as T increases, the entire car moves right. So at time T, the car is at [tail + s*(T-13), head + s*(T-13)].\n\nThe condition for 0 to be in the span is:\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   T-13 >= (0 - tail)/s   -> but wait, this is reversed? \n\nLet me do:\n\n   Lower bound: tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   s*(T-13) <= -tail   =>   T-13 >= ceil( (-tail) / s )? \n\nActually, it's:\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   T-13 >= ceil( (-tail) / s ) ? Not exactly: \n\nWe have:\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   T-13 >= (0 - tail) / s   [if s>0, then inequality direction remains]\n\nBut note: (0-tail) is positive if tail<0? \n\nActually, let me write:\n\n   Condition 1: tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   T >= 13 + (0 - tail) / s   [because we divide by positive s]\n\n   Condition 2: head + s*(T-13) >= 0   =>   T >= 13 + (0 - head) / s   [but note: (0-head) might be negative]\n\nWait, condition 2: head + s*(T-13) >= 0  =>  s*(T-13) >= -head  =>  T-13 >= (-head)/s.\n\nBut note: because head is the front and tail is the rear, and the car is moving right, we have:\n\n   The entire car is to the left of 0 when the front (head) is still less than 0? \n\nActually, the condition for 0 to be in [tail_T, head_T] is:\n\n   tail_T <= 0 and head_T >= 0.\n\nSo:\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   and   head + s*(T-13) >= 0.\n\nTherefore:\n\n   T >= 13 + ceil( (0 - head) / s )   ? But note: (0 - head)/s might be negative, so we have to be careful.\n\nActually, we can write:\n\n   T >= 13 + max( ceil( (0 - head)/s ), ceil( (0 - tail)/s )? ) -> no.\n\nFrom:\n\n   head + s*(T-13) >= 0   =>   T-13 >= (0 - head)/s\n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   T-13 <= (0 - tail)/s   [because we are moving the term and dividing by positive s, but note: when we divide by positive the inequality remains]\n\nWait: \n\n   tail + s*(T-13) <= 0   =>   s*(T-13) <= -tail   =>   T-13 <= (-tail) / s   [because s>0]\n\nSimilarly:\n\n   head + s*(T-13) >= 0   =>   T-13 >= (-head) / s\n\nSo:\n\n   (-head)/s <= T-13 <= (-tail)/s\n\nTherefore:\n\n   T in [ 13 + (-head)/s , 13 + (-tail)/s ]\n\nBut note: (-head)/s might be fractional, and (-tail)/s too. So the integer T must satisfy:\n\n   T_min = ceil(13 + (-head)/s)\n   T_max = floor(13 + (-tail)/s)\n\nBut wait: the inequalities are inclusive? \n\nActually, the condition is:\n\n   T-13 >= (-head)/s   and   T-13 <= (-tail)/s\n\nSo the smallest integer T that satisfies T-13 >= (-head)/s is ceil(13 + (-head)/s).\n\nThe largest integer T that satisfies T-13 <= (-tail)/s is floor(13 + (-tail)/s).\n\nBut note: if 13 + (-head)/s is integer, then T_min = 13 + (-head)/s.\n\nSimilarly for T_max.\n\nSo the dangerous turns for a car are:\n\n   T_min = ceil(13 - head/s)\n   T_max = floor(13 - tail/s)\n\nThen T in [T_min, T_max] (inclusive) are dangerous.\n\nBut note: if T_min > T_max, then no dangerous turn.\n\nLet me test with freeway 1:\n\n   head = 12, tail=1, s=12.\n\n   T_min = ceil(13 - 12/12) = ceil(13 - 1) = ceil(12) = 12\n   T_max = floor(13 - 1/12) = floor(12 + 11/12) = 12\n\nSo only at T=12? But we start at T=13. So at T=13:\n\n   head_T = 12 + 12*(0) = 12? No, at T=13, the car is at [1,12] because it hasn't moved? \n\nWait: the update rule: at T>t1 (which is 13), the car moves. So at T=13, we are at the initial state: [1,12] for freeway1. So at T=13, 0 is not in [1,12]. \n\nBut according to our formula:\n\n   T_min = ceil(13 - 12/12) = ceil(12) = 12\n   T_max = floor(13 - 1/12) = floor(12.916...) = 12\n\nSo the dangerous turn is T=12, which is before our current turn (13). So at T=13, the car has moved to [1+12*(0)=1, 12+12*(0)=12] -> still [1,12]. So 0 is not covered.\n\nNow, what about T=14? \n\n   head_14 = 12 + 12*(1) = 24\n   tail_14 = 1 + 12*(1) = 13\n\n   The span at T=14 is [13,24] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo freeway1 is never dangerous for T>=13.\n\nSimilarly, let's check freeway 2 to 5: they are all (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nWait: head=-6, tail=-17? \n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? The table says: for freeway2: (-6, -17, right, 6). \n\nThis is inconsistent because -6 > -17? Actually, -6 is greater than -17. So the head is -6 and tail is -17? Then the car spans from -17 to -6? That is, the tail is at -17 and the head at -6? \n\nThen at T=13: [tail, head] = [-17, -6]. \n\nAt T, the car moves to [ -17 + 6*(T-13), -6 + 6*(T-13) ]\n\nWe want 0 in that interval:\n\n   Condition: \n        -17 + 6*(T-13) <= 0   =>   6*(T-13) <= 17   =>   T-13 <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833   =>   T<= 15.833 -> T<=15 (if integer)\n        -6 + 6*(T-13) >= 0   =>   6*(T-13) >= 6   =>   T-13 >= 1   =>   T>=14\n\nSo T in [14,15] (integer) -> T=14,15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5 have the same car? So they are dangerous at T=14 and 15.\n\nNow freeway 6: (60,25,right,36)\n\nWait: head=60, tail=25? But 60>25, so that's fine.\n\nAt T, the car is at [25+36*(T-13), 60+36*(T-13)]\n\nWe want 0 in [25+36*(T-13), 60+36*(T-13)]\n\n   Condition1: 25+36*(T-13) <=0 -> 36*(T-13)<=-25 -> T-13<= -25/36 -> T<=13-25/36<13 -> no T>=13 satisfies.\n\n   Condition2: 60+36*(T-13)>=0 -> 36*(T-13)>=-60 -> T-13>=-60/36≈-1.666 -> which is always true for T>=13.\n\nBut condition1 is never satisfied for T>=13. So no dangerous turn.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: (96,49,right,48)\n\n   Condition1: 49+48*(T-13)<=0 -> 48*(T-13)<=-49 -> T-13<= -49/48≈-1.02 -> always false for T>=13? \n   Condition2: 96+48*(T-13)>=0 -> always true for T>=13.\n\nBut condition1 fails, so no dangerous turn.\n\nTherefore, only freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T=14 and T=15.\n\nSo we have:\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5: dangerous at T=14 and T=15.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 13 at row 6.\n\nWe wish to get to row 9 as quickly as possible. The minimal moves would be 3 moves up: U, U, U. But we must avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nThe dangerous freeways are 2,3,4,5 (rows 2,3,4,5) at times 14 and 15.\n\nSo if we are on row 2,3,4, or 5 at turn 14 or 15, we collide.\n\nOur plan:\n\nWe start at row 6 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, we choose an action. Then at turn 14 we are at a new row, and so on.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At turn 14: we cannot be on rows 2,3,4,5.\n- At turn 15: we cannot be on rows 2,3,4,5.\n\nBut note: at turn 13 we are at row 6. Then:\n\nOption 1: Move up at turn13: then at turn14 we are at row7.\n\nThen we can move up again at turn14: then at turn15 we are at row8.\n\nThen at turn15 we move up to row9? Then at the beginning of turn16 we are at row9 -> so we have reached at turn16.\n\nBut we must check the positions at each turn:\n\nTurn13: row6 -> safe? row6 is freeway6, but we saw freeway6 is not dangerous at any time? So safe.\n\nTurn14: we are at row7 (if we moved up at 13). Freeway7: is it dangerous? We saw freeway7 is not dangerous. So safe.\n\nTurn15: we are at row8 (if we moved up at 14). Freeway8: not dangerous. Safe.\n\nThen at turn15 we do U again: then at turn16 we are at row9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: at turn15 we are at row8 and we take action U. Then at the beginning of turn16 we are at row9. We need to check turn15: we are at row8 during turn15? and that is safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn13: U -> from 6 to 7\nTurn14: U -> from 7 to 8\nTurn15: U -> from 8 to 9\n\nThen we are done at turn16. H=4? (turns 13,14,15,16) and we output actions for turns13,14,15.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" meaning the total number of turns from start until we are at row9. So H=4.\n\nBut is there a way in 3 turns? That would be:\n\nAt turn13: we start at row6. Then after 3 actions (at turn16) we would be at row9? But we need to get to row9 at the beginning of turn16? \n\nActually, after H turns: starting at turn13, after 1 turn (turn14) we are at row6 + action at turn13, then after 2 turns (turn15) we are at ... and after 3 turns (turn16) we are at row9. So H=4.\n\nBut note: we can only move one per turn. From 6 to 9 requires 3 moves up. So minimal H is 4 (because we start at turn13 and end at turn16).\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the danger with this plan:\n\nTurn13: at row6 -> safe (freeway6 not dangerous at any time, and at turn13: freeway6 car is at [25,60] -> 0 not in there, so safe).\n\nTurn14: we are at row7 -> freeway7: at turn14, car is at [49+48*(1)=97, 96+48=144] -> 0 not in [97,144] -> safe.\n\nTurn15: we are at row8 -> freeway8: at turn15, car is at [49+48*(2)=49+96=145, 96+96=192] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn15 we take U and at turn16 we are at row9 -> goal.\n\nBut note: the dangerous freeways (2,3,4,5) at turns14,15: we are not on any of them at those turns.\n\nSo this plan works.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to move faster? We cannot move faster because we need 3 moves to go from 6 to 9.\n\nAlternatively, we could move down? But that would take more moves.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", so 4.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without being on row6 at turn13? We start at row6, so we have to be there at turn13.\n\nBut row6 is safe at turn13.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\n\nBut wait, at turn15 we are at row8 and then we move to row9 at turn16. So the last action is at turn15.\n\nSo output:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=4, so t from 0 to 3? \n\nt=0: turn13, t=1: turn14, t=2: turn15.\n\nSo three actions.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and we are at row9 at turn13+H-1. So if H=4, then at turn13+3=16 we are at row9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there any danger we missed? What about freeway6 at turn13: we are at row6 at turn13. The car on freeway6 at turn13: [25,60] -> 0 not in there. Then at turn14 we are at row7, and freeway6 at turn14: [25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> 0 not in. Similarly, freeway7 at turn14: [49+48=97, 96+48=144] -> safe. \n\nBut note: we don't check freeway6 at turn14 because we are on row7 at turn14. We only check the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut wait: what if we stay at row6 at turn13? Then at turn14 we are still at row6. At turn14, freeway6: [25+36=61,60+36=96] -> safe. Then we can move up at turn14 to row7, then at turn15 to row8, then at turn16 to row9. That would be:\n\nTurn13: S\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U -> but then we reach at turn17? So H=5, which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, if we go up at turn13 to row7, then stay at turn14? Then at turn15 we are at row7? Then we have to go up twice: at turn15 and turn16 to row9. Then we reach at turn17. H=5.\n\nSo the minimal is with H=4.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=3? That would mean we are at row9 at turn15 (because turn13,14,15: three turns). But to get from row6 to row9 in two moves? We would need to move up twice: then at turn14 we would be at row8, and then at turn15 we would be at row9? \n\nBut that requires:\n\nTurn13: U -> row7\nTurn14: U -> row8\nThen at turn15: we are at row8? And then we move U at turn15 to get to row9 at turn16? So we are at row9 at turn16, which is H=4.\n\nIf we want to be at row9 at turn15, we would have to be at row9 at the beginning of turn15? But we start at turn13 at row6. Then:\n\nAt turn13: we take an action -> then at turn14 we are at row? \nAt turn14: take an action -> then at turn15 we are at row?\n\nTo be at row9 at the beginning of turn15, we would have to have been at row8 at turn14 and then take U at turn14. But then at turn15 we are at row9.\n\nSo we need to get to row8 by turn14? \n\nAt turn13: we start at row6. We can move up to row7 at turn14? Then we need to move two steps in one turn? Not possible. \n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut what about the danger? Our plan goes through row7 at turn14 and row8 at turn15, which are safe. \n\nBut what if we try to go through row5? That is dangerous at turn14 and 15. So we avoid row2,3,4,5 at turns14 and15.\n\nBut in our plan we are above row5.\n\nAlternatively, could we go down? But that would take more moves.\n\nSo the plan is safe and minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous turns for freeways 2,3,4,5:\n\nFreeway2: car at turn13: tail=-17, head=-6, s=6.\n\nAt turn14: \n   tail14 = -17 + 6*(14-13) = -17+6 = -11\n   head14 = -6 + 6 = 0\nSo the span at turn14 is [-11,0]. Does this include 0? Yes, because the head is at 0.\n\nThe problem says: the car span at T is [tail + s*(T-13), head + s*(T-13)] for right-moving. And we require 0 to be in the span.\n\nAt turn14: 0 is in [-11,0] (because 0 is the endpoint). So yes, dangerous.\n\nAt turn15:\n   tail15 = -17+12 = -5\n   head15 = -6+12 = 6\n   span = [-5,6] -> 0 is in there.\n\nSo at turn14 and 15, freeway2 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: same car, so same dangerous times.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5 at turns14 and15.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt turn14: we are at row7 -> freeway7, which is safe.\nAt turn15: we are at row8 -> freeway8, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut what if we are at row5 at turn13? Then at turn14 we would be at row5 (if we stay) or row4 or row6. But if we are at row5 at turn14, that's dangerous. But we start at row6. So we don't go to row5 at turn13? \n\nAt turn13, we start at row6. We could move down to row5 at turn14? But that would be dangerous at turn14. So we avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", so:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut wait, at turn15 we are at row8 and we move to row9. Then at turn16 we are at row9 and we stop.\n\nSo we don't need an action for turn16 because we have already reached.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut let me confirm the format: the problem says:\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo for t1=13:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut note: the sequence has 3 actions, and H=4.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\", and we do.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a plan that takes the same H but avoids the danger? We don't need because our plan is safe.\n\nAlternatively, if we did:\n\nTurn13: S -> stay at row6 at turn14? Then at turn14: row6 is freeway6 -> safe (as computed). Then at turn14 we do U: to row7 at turn15. Then at turn15 we do U: to row8 at turn16. Then we still need one more U to row9 at turn17. So that would be H=5.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr if we do:\n\nTurn13: D -> to row5 at turn14. Then at turn14 we are at row5 -> which is dangerous (freeway5 at turn14: dangerous). So collision.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal and safe plan is U,U,U.\n\nBut wait: what about the possibility of going up and then down to avoid a danger? But we don't have any danger in our path.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nOne more: what if we go up to row7 at turn14, then at turn15 we go down? Then we avoid row8 at turn15? But then we are at row6 at turn16? Then we have to go up again. That would take more moves.\n\nSo minimal is the direct up.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and aims to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Car Hazards**:  \n  - Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 have cars that are hazardous at turns 14 and 15. Specifically:\n    - At turn 14, the car spans cover 0 on these freeways.\n    - At turn 15, the car spans also cover 0 on these freeways.\n  - Freeways 1, 6, 7, and 8 are safe at all turns starting from 13, as their car spans never include 0 for \\(T \\geq 13\\).\n\n- **Player Movement**:  \n  - The player must move from row 6 to row 9, requiring three upward moves (each increasing \\(y\\) by 1).\n  - The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 4 (turns 13 to 16), with actions taken at turns 13, 14, and 15.\n\n- **Collision Avoidance**:  \n  - **Turn 13**: Start at row 6. Freeway 6 is safe (car span: [25, 60] at turn 13, 0 not included). Action \\(U\\) moves to row 7 at turn 14.\n  - **Turn 14**: At row 7. Freeway 7 is safe (car span: [97, 144] at turn 14, 0 not included). Action \\(U\\) moves to row 8 at turn 15.\n  - **Turn 15**: At row 8. Freeway 8 is safe (car span: [145, 192] at turn 15, 0 not included). Action \\(U\\) moves to row 9 at turn 16.\n  - **Turn 16**: Position is \\((0, 9)\\), which is the goal (no cars on row 9).\n\nThis sequence avoids rows 2–5 during hazardous turns (14 and 15) and reaches row 9 in minimal turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 13 to 15 is \\(U, U, U\\), resulting in:\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 6 \\xrightarrow{U} y = 7\\)\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 7 \\xrightarrow{U} y = 8\\)\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 8 \\xrightarrow{U} y = 9\\)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (unless at 9, then stays)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (unless at 0, then stays)\n- S: stay\n\nCollision condition:\nAt turn T, if the player is at position (0, y_T) and y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the car on freeway y_T.\nCollision occurs if the car's span at turn T covers the x-coordinate 0.\n\nImportant note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y (the starting row) and then moves to y' at the next turn. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to the current row (the row we are leaving) and not the row we are entering.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". Here y_T is the row the player is on at the beginning of the turn (before the action). So when we take an action at turn T, we are currently on y_T, and we are going to move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy. At the moment of turn T, we are still on y_T, so we check the car on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8). Also, note that we start at (0,0) at turn 15, and 0 is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8) so at turn 15 we are safe.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1..8) at a turn when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nGiven car state at turn 15 (t1=15):\n\nWe note the direction and speed. The update for a car:\n\nLeft-moving: [h, τ] -> at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: the table gives head and tail. For left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem defines:\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut looking at the data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\".\n\nSo for right-moving cars, the initial span at t1=15 is [τ, h] (so τ is the leftmost, h is the rightmost). Then at turn T (>=15), the span becomes [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n\nWe have:\n\nFreeway 1: (h=48, τ=37, right, s=12) -> initial span [37,48] (since τ is the tail, h is the head, and right-moving: so the car extends from τ to h, and moves right).\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> meaning from tail to head? So the car covers [τ, h] at t1.\n\nThen at T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nBut note: the player moves one row per turn (unless staying). We need to get from row 0 to row 9, so we must pass through each row 1,2,...,8 exactly once? Not necessarily: we can go up and down. However, we want minimal turns, so we probably want to go straight up. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nOur goal: minimize H (number of turns) to reach row 9.\n\nWe start at turn 15, row 0.\n\nWe can simulate turn by turn.\n\nWe are going to consider the next turns: t=15,16,17,... and at each turn we choose an action (U, D, S) that leads to a safe state.\n\nWe note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are at row 0 at turn 15: safe (since row0 is not a freeway).\n\nWe need to plan the actions for turns 15,16,17,... until we reach row 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on rows 1..8 at a turn when the car on that row has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and for each future turn T (>=15) the span of the car on that freeway.\n\nWe'll denote:\nFor freeway k, at turn T (relative to t1=15, so T=15,16,...), the car's span is:\n\nSince all cars are right-moving:\n\nFreeway 1: τ0 = 37, h0=48, s=12\n  Span at T: [37 + 12*(T-15), 48 + 12*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 2: τ0=-48, h0=-59? Wait, that seems backwards. The table says: for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). But note: the problem says for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [τ, h]. So τ should be the left end and h the right end? But here τ=-48 and h=-59 -> that would be [ -48, -59 ] which is backwards? Because -48 > -59, so that would be an interval that goes from -48 to -59? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, the table says for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 6). But in the format: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nThe problem says: for a right-moving car, the span is [τ, h]. And the update: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the head and tail: which is which? The problem says: \"head\" and \"tail\". Typically, the head is the front. For a right-moving car, the front (head) is to the right of the tail.\n\nBut in the data for freeway 2: head = -48, tail = -59. Then the head is at -48 and tail at -59? Then the car extends from -59 (left) to -48 (right). So the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. But the table says (head, tail) = (-48, -59). So we have to interpret: the first number is head, the second is tail. So for freeway 2: head = -48, tail = -59 -> meaning the car spans from tail=-59 to head=-48? Then the interval is [-59, -48]. But the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? But that's not what the table says: the table says (head, tail) = (-48, -59). So the head is -48 and the tail is -59. So the car goes from -59 to -48? Then the span is [-59, -48]. \n\nBut the problem's update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] meaning [tail, head] and then moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both. So:\n\nFreeway 2: τ = -59, h = -48? But the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\" -> so the first number is head, the second is tail.\n\nSo for freeway 2: head h = -48, tail τ = -59. Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at turn T: [-59 + 6*(T-15), -48 + 6*(T-15)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59 -> span at t1: [-59,-48], and then at T: [-59+6*(T-15), -48+6*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, s=36 -> span at t1: [-83,-48], then at T: [-83+36*(T-15), -48+36*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, s=48 -> span at t1: [-95,-48], then at T: [-95+48*(T-15), -48+48*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, we are only concerned when the player is on a freeway row. We must check for each freeway row k and for each turn T if the player is on row k at turn T, then we require that 0 is not in the car's span on row k at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn. We start at turn 15 at row 0.\n\nWe want to get to row 9 as fast as possible. The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we go straight up: 0->1->2->...->9, which takes 9 moves: from turn15 to turn23).\n\nBut we must check if that path is safe.\n\nSo let's check the safety for each row at the time we would be there if we go straight up:\n\nPlan: \nTurn15: at row0 (safe) -> then we do U to go to row1 at turn16.\nTurn16: at row1 -> check freeway1 at turn16.\n\nCompute for freeway1 at turn16: T=16\n  Span: [37 + 12*(16-15), 48 + 12*(16-15)] = [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nTurn16: we are at row1, then we do U -> go to row2 at turn17.\nTurn17: at row2 -> check freeway2 at turn17.\n  Freeway2: at T=17: [-59+6*(17-15), -48+6*(17-15)] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in this -> safe.\n\nTurn17: U -> row3 at turn18.\nTurn18: row3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? \n  Freeway3: same car as freeway2? Actually, the table says freeway3 also has (-48,-59,right,6) -> so same as freeway2: at T=18: [-59+6*(18-15), -48+6*(18-15)] = [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\nTurn18: U -> row4 at turn19.\nTurn19: row4 -> freeway4: same car? at T=19: [-59+6*(19-15), -48+6*(19-15)] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\nTurn19: U -> row5 at turn20.\nTurn20: row5 -> freeway5: same car? at T=20: [-59+6*(20-15), -48+6*(20-15)] = [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n\nTurn20: U -> row6 at turn21.\nTurn21: row6 -> freeway6: head=-48, tail=-83, s=36 -> at T=21: \n  [-83 + 36*(21-15), -48 + 36*(21-15)] = [-83 + 36*6, -48 + 36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133, 168] -> 0 not in [133,168] -> safe.\n\nTurn21: U -> row7 at turn22.\nTurn22: row7 -> freeway7: head=-48, tail=-95, s=48 -> at T=22:\n  [-95 + 48*(22-15), -48 + 48*(22-15)] = [-95 + 48*7, -48 + 48*7] = [-95+336, -48+336] = [241, 288] -> safe.\n\nTurn22: U -> row8 at turn23.\nTurn23: row8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7? at T=23: \n  [-95 + 48*(23-15), -48 + 48*(23-15)] = [-95+48*8, -48+48*8] = [-95+384, -48+384] = [289, 336] -> safe.\n\nThen turn23: U -> row9 at turn24.\n\nSo we would reach row9 at turn24? Actually, we started at turn15 at row0. Then:\n\nTurn15: row0 -> then we do U at turn15 to go to row1 at turn16.\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn15: U -> at turn16 we are at row1.\nTurn16: U -> at turn17 at row2.\n...\nTurn22: U -> at turn23 at row8.\nTurn23: U -> at turn24 at row9.\n\nSo H = 9 turns? But we did 9 actions: from turn15 to turn23 (inclusive) -> 9 turns? But the player position at turn15 is row0, then after 9 moves (at turn24) we are at row9.\n\nBut note: we are required to output the actions for turns starting at t1=15, and we need H actions? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, so H actions. And then at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nSo if we start at turn15 and do 9 actions (t=0 to 8: so H=9), then the last action is at turn15+8=23, and then at turn24 we would be at row9? But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So we must be at row9 at the end of the last action? \n\nLet me clarify the timing:\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). We choose action a_t. Then we update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo if we do 9 actions (H=9) from turn15 to turn23, then:\n\nTurn15: a15 -> y16 = y15 + Δy15 = 0 + 1 = 1.\nTurn16: a16 -> y17 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n...\nTurn23: a23 -> y24 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo at the end of the last action (at turn23) we have set y24 to 9, but we are not at row9 until turn24. However, the problem says: we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9. Here t1=15, H=9, so t1+H-1 = 15+9-1=23. But at turn23, we are still at row8 (because we are at row8 at the beginning of turn23, then we do U and then at turn24 we are at row9). So at turn23, we are at row8, not 9.\n\nThis is a misunderstanding. The problem says: we are to determine the minimal H and actions such that at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut according to the update: at turn t, we start at (0,y_t) and then we do action a_t, and then we end up at (0,y_{t+1}) at the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. After the action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}. So we are at row y_t at turn t.\n\nWe want at some turn T = t1+H-1, the player is at row9. That means at turn T, we are at row9.\n\nHow do we get to row9 at turn T? We must have been at row8 at turn T-1 and done U at turn T-1, or at row9 and done S, or ... but note we start at row0 at turn15.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn T, we must have arrived there by an action at turn T-1.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. So we must have H such that at turn 15+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nIn our plan above, we are at row9 at turn24. So T=24. Then H-1 = 24-15 = 9 -> H=10? But that would be 10 actions.\n\nAlternatively, if we count the turns: we start at turn15 at row0. Then:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn15: row0.\nAfter 1 action (turn15 done): turn16: row1.\n...\nAfter 9 actions: turn24: row9.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn24, we have H-1 = 24 - 15 = 9, so H=10. Then the actions are from t=0 to t=9? But the sequence is {a_{15}, a_{16}, ..., a_{23}} -> 9 actions? \n\nThe problem says: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So if H=10, then t from 0 to 9: a_{15+0} to a_{15+9} = a15 to a24? But that would be 10 actions, and then we are at row9 at turn25? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me reread: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0). We take an action a_{t1} (which is the first action) and then we move to the next state at turn t1+1.\n\nWe want that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9? Or at the end of the action at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9?\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". This y is the position at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action?\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\", meaning that at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, then we do action a_t, and then at the beginning of turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo y_t is the position at the start of turn t.\n\nTherefore, we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9.\n\nBut we start at turn15 (t1=15) at row0. We want to be at row9 at the start of turn T. Then T = t1+H-1.\n\nHow many actions do we take? We take actions at turns 15, 16, ..., T-1. So the number of actions is (T - 15). And T = t1+H-1 = 15+H-1, so T - 15 = H-1. Therefore, we take H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is of H actions: from t=0 to H-1. \n\nThis implies: we take H actions: at turns 15, 16, ..., 15+H-1. Then the state at the beginning of turn 15+H is y_{15+H}. But we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{15+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo if we take H actions, then after the last action (at turn 15+H-1) we have updated to y_{15+H}. But we require that at the beginning of turn 15+H-1 we are at 9? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, we require that at the beginning of turn 15+H-1 we are at 9. Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence requires H actions starting at turn15.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ... \n\nAnd then the note: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nI think the standard interpretation is that after taking H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1), we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? But the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at row9, and we don't take an action at that turn? But the sequence is defined for H actions.\n\nLet me check the index: \n\nWe are at turn t1: position y_{t1}=0.\nAfter action a_{t1}, we are at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}.\n...\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, we are at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and move to y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as we have been at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), meaning we want to be at row9. And we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we have already reached. However, we are required to take H actions? So we would take an action at turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at 9? But that action might move us away? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", so we must be at (0,9) at some turn. And we are free to choose when to stop. But note the requirement: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to reconcile.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after taking H actions (the last action at turn t1+H-1), we are at row9 at the next turn (turn t1+H). But then the requirement should be y_{t1+H}=9, not y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo I think the intended meaning is: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9. And we have taken H-1 actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-2) to get there. But the sequence is for H actions? That doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence includes the action at turn t1+H-1, but then after that action we are at row10? which is invalid. So we must use S at the last step? \n\nBut we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we can choose a_{t1+H-1} = S to stay at row9. Then at the next turn we are still at row9. But the requirement is only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9, and we are.\n\nBut then why do we need to take an action after reaching? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach\", so once we reach, we stop. But the sequence is defined for exactly H actions.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that we need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take H actions? But that would be H actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9 at the beginning? But when we start turn t1+H-1, we are at row9, then we take an action. That action might be S, then we stay at row9 for the next turn.\n\nBut the requirement is only to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1 (at the beginning). So even if we then move away, we have been at row9 at that turn. However, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which usually means we want to be there and then we can stop. But the problem doesn't say we stop; we just need to be there at some turn.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is the number of turns from the start until we are at row9 (at the beginning of a turn). And then we output the actions for the turns from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at row9? But that means we are at row9 at the start of that turn, and then we take an action? \n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the requirement: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". This y is defined as the position at the beginning of the turn. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} (which is the last action in the sequence), and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy.\n\nIf we choose S, then we stay at row9 for the next turn. But the requirement doesn't say we have to stay, only that we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we might choose S at the last step.\n\nBut note: we could have reached row9 earlier and then done something else, but we want minimal H, so the earliest turn at which we are at row9.\n\nIn our plan above, we are at row9 at the beginning of turn24. So t1+H-1 = 24 -> 15+H-1=24 -> H=10.\n\nThen we take 10 actions: from turn15 to turn24.\n\nBut at turn24, we are at row9 at the beginning, and then we take an action (which would be the 10th action). But we only need to be at row9 at turn24 (the beginning), so we can do S at turn24 to stay.\n\nBut wait, in our simulation, we would be at row9 at the beginning of turn24 only if we were at row8 at turn23 and did U at turn23. Then at the beginning of turn24, we are at row9.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn15: U -> to row1 at turn16\nTurn16: U -> row2 at turn17\n...\nTurn23: U -> row9 at turn24\n\nThen at turn24, we are at row9 (beginning of turn24). So we are at row9 at turn24 = t1+9. So 15+H-1 = 24 -> H=10.\n\nThen the sequence has 10 actions: from turn15 to turn24.\n\nBut at turn24, we are at row9 at the beginning, and then we take an action. We must output an action for turn24. We can do S.\n\nBut the requirement is satisfied at the beginning of turn24, so any action at turn24 is fine as long as it doesn't cause a collision? But at turn24, we are on row9, and row9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8), so it is safe. We can do S.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We did 9 moves upward and then one S? But we are at row9 at turn24, so H=10.\n\nCan we get there earlier?\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 9 (because we start at row0 and need to go up 9 rows). But in 9 actions, we would be at turn23 (beginning) at row9? \n\nHow? We start at turn15 (row0). After 1 action (turn15: U) -> turn16: row1.\nAfter 2: turn17: row2.\n...\nAfter 9 actions: turn24: row9.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row9 is at turn24. Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me check: if we do 9 actions, then the last action is at turn23, and then at turn24 we are at row9. So at the beginning of turn24 we are at row9. Then we are at row9 at turn24. So we need H such that t1+H-1 = 24 -> 15+H-1=24 -> H=10.\n\nSo we must output 10 actions.\n\nBut in our simulation, we only did 9 upward moves. We need one more action? The 10th action is at turn24: we are at row9 and we do S.\n\nBut the problem does not require that we stay at row9, only that we are there at turn t1+H-1. So we are there at turn24 (with H=10, so t1+H-1=24). And we have taken 9 U's and then at turn24 we take S.\n\nBut we could also do U at turn24? But that would try to go to row10, which is not allowed, so it stays at 9. But S is clearer.\n\nNow, we must check if the entire path is safe. We already checked the upward moves until turn23 (when we go to row9 at turn24). But what about the action at turn24? We are at row9 at the beginning of turn24, and row9 is not a freeway, so no collision check. Then we do S, and we stay at row9 for turn25, which is also safe.\n\nBut is there a way to get to row9 earlier? For example, by turn23? That would require being at row9 at the beginning of turn23. But that would require 9 upward moves in 8 actions? That's impossible because we start at row0. Each U moves one row up. So we need 9 U's to go from 0 to 9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut wait: we start at row0 at turn15. After 1 action (U at turn15) we are at row1 at turn16. After 2 actions: row2 at turn17. ... After 8 actions: row8 at turn23. Then at turn23, we do U: then at turn24 we are at row9. So to be at row9 at the beginning of a turn, the earliest is turn24.\n\nTherefore, H=10.\n\nNow, we must check that the entire path we simulated is safe. We did:\n\nTurn15: row0 -> safe (not a freeway)\nAction: U -> then at turn16: row1.\n\nTurn16: at row1 -> check freeway1 at turn16: [37+12*(16-15), 48+12*(16-15)] = [49,60] -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn17: row2.\n\nTurn17: row2 -> freeway2: [-59+6*(17-15), -48+6*(17-15)] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn18: row3.\n\nTurn18: row3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? [-59+6*(18-15), -48+6*(18-15)] = [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn19: row4.\n\nTurn19: row4 -> freeway4: [-59+6*(19-15), -48+6*(19-15)] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn20: row5.\n\nTurn20: row5 -> freeway5: [-59+6*(20-15), -48+6*(20-15)] = [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn21: row6.\n\nTurn21: row6 -> freeway6: [-83+36*(21-15), -48+36*(21-15)] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn22: row7.\n\nTurn22: row7 -> freeway7: [-95+48*(22-15), -48+48*(22-15)] = [-95+336, -48+336] = [241,288] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn23: row8.\n\nTurn23: row8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7? [-95+48*(23-15), -48+48*(23-15)] = [-95+384, -48+384] = [289,336] -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn24: row9.\n\nNow, we are at turn24: at row9 (safe). Then we need to do the 10th action? We do S.\n\nBut note: at turn24, we are at row9, so no freeway, safe. Then we do S: we stay at row9 for turn25.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: S\n\nBut wait, we are at row9 at the beginning of turn24, and we do S at turn24 to stay. Then the requirement is satisfied at turn24 (which is t1+H-1 = 15+10-1=24).\n\nBut is there any issue? What if we don't do the S? The problem says we must output H actions. We must output 10 actions. So we have to include an action for turn24.\n\nWe could do U at turn24, but that would try to go to 10, which is not allowed, so it stays at 9. But S is equivalent and clearer.\n\nBut note: the problem says we must avoid collisions. At turn24, we are at row9 (safe) and then we do S: no collision.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid plan.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions to be sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nFreeway1 at turn16: \n  T=16: [37+12*(1)=49, 48+12=60] -> correct, 0 not in [49,60].\n\nFreeway2 at turn17: \n  T=17: [-59 + 6*2 = -59+12 = -47, -48+12=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 at turn18: \n  T=18: [-59+6*3=-59+18=-41, -48+18=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn19: \n  T=19: [-59+6*4=-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn20: \n  T=20: [-59+6*5=-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn21: \n  T=21: [-83+36*6=-83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn22: \n  T=22: [-95+48*7=-95+336=241, -48+336=288] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn23: \n  T=23: [-95+48*8=-95+384=289, -48+384=336] -> safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the actions are 9 U's and then an S at the last step.\n\nBut we can also do U at the last step? But that would be the same as S since we are at 9. So either is fine.\n\nHowever, the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. Then we do an action. If we do U, then we try to go to 10, which is not allowed, so we stay at 9. So it's effectively the same as S.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do S.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that we stay at 9, only that we are there at that turn. So even if we do D at the last step, we would go to 8 at the next turn, but we have already satisfied the condition at the beginning of turn24. However, that would be unnecessary and might be confusing. So we do S.\n\nBut let me check if the problem requires us to be at row9 at the last turn and then we stop? The problem doesn't specify, but to be safe, we do S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: S\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn24, and we are at row9 at the beginning of turn24, then we do S, and then at turn25 we are still at row9. But the requirement is only at turn24.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", so we are at (0,9) at turn24. The subsequent turn doesn't matter.\n\nBut the minimal H is 10, and this is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way to get to row9 earlier? For example, if we skip some rows by moving faster? But we can only move one row per turn. So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\n}\n\nBut note: the turn numbers: the current turn is t1=15. We output from turn15 to turn24 (10 turns).\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\n\nBut wait, in the answer format, it should be exactly as above.\n\nBut let me confirm the car at freeway6: I see the car is (-48, -83, right, 36). I computed at turn21: [ -83+36*(21-15)= -83+36*6 = -83+216=133, -48+216=168]. But what if we are at row6 at a different turn? In our plan, we are at row6 at turn21. But if we go faster, we might be there earlier, but we cannot.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7: at turn22: [ -95+48*7= -95+336=241, -48+336=288]. \n\nBut note: freeway8 is the same as freeway7? The table says for freeway8: (-48,-95,right,48) -> same as freeway7. So at turn23: for freeway8: same calculation as freeway7 at turn23? Actually, freeway7 and freeway8 are independent. But in our plan, we are at freeway8 at turn23, and we computed freeway8 at turn23: [ -95+48*8= -95+384=289, -48+384=336]. \n\nBut wait, the table says freeway7 and freeway8 have the same car? No, they are different rows. But the car parameters are the same. So the computation is the same for freeway7 and freeway8 at the same turn? But we hit freeway7 at turn22 and freeway8 at turn23, so different turns.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway1 at turn16: we are at row1 at turn16, and the car is at [49,60]. But note: the car moves to the right, so at turn16 it is at 49 to 60, which is far to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, others are negative until they become positive, but we hit them when they are still negative or when they are positive and away.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 10. The sequence of actions is designed to move the player upward by one row each turn for the first 9 turns, reaching row 9 at the beginning of turn 24 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 10 - 1 = 24\\)). At turn 24, the action is \"S\" (stay) to remain at row 9, satisfying the requirement that \\(y_{24} = 9\\).\n\nThe path avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n- At each turn when the player is on a freeway row, the car on that row does not cover the x-coordinate 0 at that specific turn, based on the car update rules and initial states.\n\n### Car Span Calculations for Relevant Turns:\n- **Freeway 1 (row 1) at turn 16**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([37, 48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 16: \\([37 + 12 \\times (16-15), 48 + 12 \\times (16-15)] = [49, 60]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [49, 60]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 2 (row 2) at turn 17**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-59, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 17: \\([-59 + 6 \\times (17-15), -48 + 6 \\times (17-15)] = [-47, -36]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [-47, -36]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 3 (row 3) at turn 18**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-59, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 18: \\([-59 + 6 \\times (18-15), -48 + 6 \\times (18-15)] = [-41, -30]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [-41, -30]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 4 (row 4) at turn 19**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-59, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 19: \\([-59 + 6 \\times (19-15), -48 + 6 \\times (19-15)] = [-35, -24]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [-35, -24]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 5 (row 5) at turn 20**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-59, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 20: \\([-59 + 6 \\times (20-15), -48 + 6 \\times (20-15)] = [-29, -18]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [-29, -18]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 6 (row 6) at turn 21**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-83, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 21: \\([-83 + 36 \\times (21-15), -48 + 36 \\times (21-15)] = [133, 168]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [133, 168]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 7 (row 7) at turn 22**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-95, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 22: \\([-95 + 48 \\times (22-15), -48 + 48 \\times (22-15)] = [241, 288]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [241, 288]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 8 (row 8) at turn 23**:  \n  Initial span at turn 15: \\([-95, -48]\\) (right-moving).  \n  Span at turn 23: \\([-95 + 48 \\times (23-15), -48 + 48 \\times (23-15)] = [289, 336]\\).  \n  0 \\(\\notin [289, 336]\\) → safe.\n\nRows 0 and 9 are not freeways, so no collision checks are needed there.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 15 to 24 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 17, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player moves at each turn by choosing an action: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), or S (stay: y unchanged). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is only on the freeway at the turn when they are at that y. Also, note that if at turn T the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} (different freeway), then at turn T they are only on freeway y_T and at turn T+1 they are on freeway y_{T+1}. So we must avoid collisions at each turn for the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nThe car update rules: \n  - For a car that is moving right: at time t, the span is [τ, h] (with τ < h) and at time T (from initial time t_1=17), the span becomes [τ + s*(T-17), h + s*(T-17)].\n  - For a car that is moving left: [h, τ] (with h < τ) becomes [h - s*(T-17), τ - s*(T-17)].\n\nBut note: in the given car state, all cars are moving right (since direction is \"right\") and the head is greater than the tail? Actually, in the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12). But note that -48 > -59? Actually, if it's moving right, then the head should be at a larger x than the tail? But -48 is to the right of -59? Yes, because -48 > -59. So the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48] for freeway 1? But the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially at t_1: span is [τ, h] -> so if they give (h, τ) then we have to invert? Actually, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is at a higher x) and tail at lower x. So the span is [τ, h] (since τ < h). \n\nBut in the table for freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59 -> so τ=-59, h=-48 -> span is [-59, -48]. Similarly for others.\n\nSo for each car on freeway k at time T (>=17), the car's span is:\n  [τ + s*(T-17), h + s*(T-17)]   for right-moving.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T happens if the player is on freeway k at time T (i.e., y_T = k) and 0 is in the interval [τ + s*(T-17), h + s*(T-17)].\n\nWe are to plan from T=17 (current turn) until we reach y=9. We start at y=2 at T=17.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions.\n\nNote: The goal is to be at (0,9) at turn (t_1 + H - 1). So we must be at y=9 at that turn.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). The minimal number of moves to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 moves (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid cars on the freeways we step on at each turn.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting at T=17) and for each freeway we are on at that turn whether there is a car on that freeway whose span at time T includes 0.\n\nNote: at T=17, we are at y=2. We must check freeway 2 at T=17.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and for each turn T (from 17 onward) the positions of the cars and see when 0 is in the span.\n\nWe'll consider T from 17 to, say, 17+20 (to be safe).\n\nFirst, let's list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12) -> span at T: [ -59 + 12*(T-17), -48 + 12*(T-17) ]\n\nFreeway 2: (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6) -> [ -47 + 6*(T-17), -36 + 6*(T-17) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6) -> same as above? But note: same parameters but on a different freeway.\n\nFreeway 4: same as above? (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 5: same as above? (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 6: (h=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36) -> [ -11 + 36*(T-17), 24 + 36*(T-17) ]\n\nFreeway 7: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48) -> [ 1 + 48*(T-17), 48 + 48*(T-17) ]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"cars on freeway k\", so each freeway has one car? And the parameters are given per freeway.\n\nNow, we must avoid the freeways we are on at each turn T if the car on that freeway at time T has 0 in its span.\n\nLet's compute the intervals for each freeway for T from 17 to, say, 25.\n\nAt T=17:\n\nFreeway1: [ -59 + 0, -48+0] = [-59, -48] -> 0 not in [-59,-48] -> safe for freeway1 at T=17? But we are not on freeway1 at T=17 (we are on freeway2) so irrelevant.\n\nWe are at y=2 at T=17. So we must check freeway2 at T=17.\n\nFreeway2: [ -47 + 6*(0) = -47, -36 ] -> [-47, -36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nSo at T=17, we are safe.\n\nNow, we plan the actions. We need to go from y=2 to y=9. We can only move up, down, or stay. The minimal moves are 7 ups. But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns and check for collisions on the freeway we are on.\n\nWe want the minimal H, so we try to go as fast as possible (always up) and see if we can avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars on the freeways we will step on:\n\nWe start at y=2 at T=17.\n\nThen we plan:\n\nT=17: at y=2 -> safe as we saw.\n\nT=18: we can choose to go up to y=3, or stay at y=2, or go down to y=1 (but going down is away from goal).\n\nWe want to go up. So let's assume we go up at every turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 17: y=2 (safe)\nTurn 18: action U -> y=3 at T=18? Actually, at T=18, we are at y=3? \n\nBut note: at turn T, the action we take at T determines y_{T+1}. Actually, the update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at T=17 (current turn), we are at y_17=2. Then we choose a_17, which determines y_18.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18, we choose a_18, which determines y_19, and so on.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at t_1=17: a_17, a_18, ... until the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe will be at y=9 at turn T when we set y_T = 9. How? \n\nWe start at T=17: y=2.\n\nAfter H-1 actions (from t=0 to H-1, meaning from T=17 to T=17+H-1), we have y_{17+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 7: we do 7 U actions.\n\nBut we must check at each turn T (from 17 to 17+6) the freeway we are on at that turn? Actually, at each turn T we are at y_T. Then we take an action that determines y_{T+1}. But the collision check is only at the turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nSo we must check for T from 17 to 17+6 (if we do 7 U's) the freeway we are on at T.\n\nAt T=17: y=2 -> check freeway2: safe (as above).\n\nAt T=18: we are at y=3 (if we did U at T=17) -> check freeway3.\n\nFreeway3 at T=18: T-17=1 -> [ -47 + 6*1, -36 + 6*1 ] = [-41, -30] -> 0 not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nAt T=19: y=4 -> check freeway4.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway2 and 3? [ -47 + 6*(19-17)=6*2=12 -> [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAt T=20: y=5 -> check freeway5.\n\nFreeway5: [ -47 + 6*(20-17)=6*3=18 -> [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n\nAt T=21: y=6 -> check freeway6.\n\nFreeway6: [ -11 + 36*(21-17)=36*4=144 -> [-11+144, 24+144] = [133, 168] -> 0 not in [133,168] -> safe.\n\nAt T=22: y=7 -> check freeway7.\n\nFreeway7: [1 + 48*(22-17)=48*5=240 -> [1+240, 48+240] = [241, 288] -> safe.\n\nAt T=23: y=8 -> check freeway8.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? [1+48*(23-17)=48*6=288 -> [1+288, 48+288] = [289, 336] -> safe.\n\nAt T=24: we would be at y=9? But wait, after 7 U moves:\n\nT=17: y=2 (start)\nT=17: action U -> y=3 at T=18\nT=18: action U -> y=4 at T=19\nT=19: action U -> y=5 at T=20\nT=20: action U -> y=6 at T=21\nT=21: action U -> y=7 at T=22\nT=22: action U -> y=8 at T=23\nT=23: action U -> y=9 at T=24\n\nBut at T=24, we are at y=9. However, note that the goal is to be at (0,9). Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1..8), we don't check for cars on freeway when we are at y=9. So we are safe at T=24.\n\nBut we have to be at y=9 at some turn. At T=24, we are at y=9. The last action (U) is taken at T=23 to go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: from T=17 to T=23: 7 actions (U at each).\n\nBut wait, we need to check the freeways we were on at T=17 to T=23? \n\nAt T=17: y=2 -> safe\nT=18: y=3 -> safe\nT=19: y=4 -> safe\nT=20: y=5 -> safe\nT=21: y=6 -> safe\nT=22: y=7 -> safe\nT=23: y=8 -> safe\n\nSo it seems we can go straight up without any problem.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway6 at T=21: T-17=4 -> [ -11 + 36*4 = -11+144=133, 24+144=168] -> [133,168] -> 0 not in there.\n\nWhat about freeway7 at T=22: [1+48*5=241, 48+48*5=240? Wait: 48*5=240, so [1+240=241, 48+240=288] -> [241,288] -> correct.\n\nSimilarly freeway8 at T=23: [1+48*6=289, 48+288=336? Wait: 48*6=288, so [1+288=289, 48+288=336] -> [289,336] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut wait, are there any freeways that might have a car that covers 0 at an earlier or later time? For example, freeway6: when does it cover 0? We need to solve: \n  -11 + 36*(T-17) <= 0 <= 24 + 36*(T-17)\n\nBut note: the interval is [ -11+36*(T-17), 24+36*(T-17) ]. Since the car is moving right, the interval moves to the right.\n\nWe want 0 in [A, B] where A=-11+36*(T-17) and B=24+36*(T-17).\n\nSo we require A <= 0 <= B.\n\nA<=0: -11+36*(T-17) <=0 -> 36*(T-17) <=11 -> T-17 <= 11/36 -> T-17 <= 0.305... -> T<=17.305, so only T=17? But at T=17: A=-11, B=24 -> and -11<=0<=24 -> yes! \n\nAt T=17, freeway6 has the span: [ -11 + 0, 24+0] = [-11,24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24.\n\nBut at T=17, we are at freeway2, not freeway6. So we are safe. But if we were at freeway6 at T=17, we would have collided.\n\nNow, when else? \n\nWe require 0>=A and 0<=B.\n\n0>=A: 0>=-11+36*(T-17) -> 36*(T-17)<=11 -> T-17<=11/36 -> T<=17+11/36 -> so only T=17? (since T is integer, T=17)\n\nBut also 0<=B: 0<=24+36*(T-17) -> always true for T>=17? Because 24+36*(nonnegative) is positive.\n\nSo freeway6 only covers 0 at T=17? But wait, at T=17: [ -11, 24] includes 0. At T=18: [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> 0 not in. So only T=17.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway7: [1+48*(T-17), 48+48*(T-17)] -> we require 1+48*(T-17) <=0 and 0<=48+48*(T-17). The second inequality is always true for T>=17. The first: 1+48*(T-17)<=0 -> 48*(T-17)<=-1 -> T-17<=-1/48 -> T<=17-1/48 -> so no T>=17 satisfies. So freeway7 never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same as freeway7? [1+48*(T-17), 48+48*(T-17)] -> same as above, never covers 0 for T>=17.\n\nNow freeway1: [ -59+12*(T-17), -48+12*(T-17) ] -> we require:\n  -59+12*(T-17) <=0 and 0<=-48+12*(T-17)\n\nFirst: -59+12*(T-17)<=0 -> 12*(T-17)<=59 -> T-17<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=21.916 -> so T=17,18,19,20,21.\n\nSecond: 0<=-48+12*(T-17) -> 48<=12*(T-17) -> T-17>=4 -> T>=21.\n\nSo together: T>=21 and T<=21.916 -> only T=21? \n\nCheck: at T=21: \n  A = -59+12*4 = -59+48 = -11\n  B = -48+12*4 = -48+48=0\n  So the interval is [-11,0] -> which includes 0? Yes, because -11<=0<=0.\n\nSo at T=21, freeway1 has a car that covers 0? But note: freeway1 is at y=1. So if the player is at y=1 at T=21, then collision.\n\nBut in our plan, we are not at y=1 at T=21. We are at y=6 at T=21. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: [ -47+6*(T-17), -36+6*(T-17) ]\n\nWe require:\n  -47+6*(T-17)<=0 and 0<=-36+6*(T-17)\n\nFirst: -47+6k<=0 -> 6k<=47 -> k<=47/6≈7.833 -> k<=7 (for integer k=T-17) -> T<=24.\n\nSecond: 0<=-36+6k -> 6k>=36 -> k>=6 -> T>=23.\n\nSo together: k>=6 and k<=7.833 -> k=6,7 -> T=23,24.\n\nAt T=23: [ -47+6*6, -36+6*6] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes.\n\nAt T=24: [ -47+6*7, -36+6*7] = [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? Yes.\n\nSo freeway2 has a car covering 0 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nBut note: in our plan we are at freeway2 only at T=17? Then we leave. At T=18 we are at y=3, etc.\n\nWe are not on freeway2 at T=23 or T=24. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same parameters as freeway2? So also at T=23 and T=24, freeway3 has a car at 0? But we are at freeway3 only at T=18 (if we go up) and at T=18: k=1 -> [ -47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> no 0.\n\nWe are not on freeway3 at T=23 or T=24.\n\nSame for freeway4 and 5: same parameters? So they will have the same pattern: they cover 0 at T=23 and T=24? But we are on freeway4 at T=19 and freeway5 at T=20. At those times, they are safe.\n\nSo in the direct 7-step up plan, we avoid all collisions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7? And the actions are 7 U's.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We start at T=17 and after H turns we are at T=17+H-1? Let me see the index.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1.\n\nThen the position at the end of the last action is at time t_1+H.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\".\n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\".\n\nAfter the last action (the H-th action, taken at t_1+H-1), we are at the position at time t_1+H? \n\nThe update: at time t, we take action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at the start of turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}=2.\n\nWe take action a_{t_1} (at turn t_1) -> then at turn t_1+1, we are at y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1+H-1, we take the last action, and then at turn t_1+H, we are at y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\".\n\nBut at turn t_1+H-1, we have just taken the action at that turn? Then we are at position y_{t_1+H-1}? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is (x_t, y_t). At turn t_1, we are at (0,2). Then we take an action at turn t_1 to get y_{t_1+1}. So the position at turn t_1 is (0,2). After taking an action at turn t_1, we move to (0, y_{t_1+1}) at turn t_1+1.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t is (0, y_t). \n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn T = t_1+H-1.\n\nSo at turn T = t_1+H-1, we must have y_T = 9.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt turn t_1=17: we are at y_17=2.\n\nWe take actions: a_17, a_18, ..., a_{17+H-2} to get to y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nThe last action is at turn 17+H-2? Then we are at y_{17+H-1}=9 at turn 17+H-1.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: from t=17 to t=17+H-2 (total H-1 actions?).\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that is a_{t_1+0}, a_{t_1+1}, ... a_{t_1+H-1}. So the indices are from t_1 to t_1+H-1 (total H actions).\n\nBut then the position at the end of these H actions is at time t_1+H.\n\nWe want that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\".\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions? \n\nBut then after H actions, we are at turn t_1+H, but we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nThis suggests that we might not need the last action? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turns\" H includes the starting turn? \n\nLet me see the example: we start at turn t_1. We are already at that turn. Then we take actions for the next H-1 turns? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence is from t_1 to t_1+H-1 (so H actions) and we are to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t_1+H-1, then the position at turn t_1+H-1 is determined by the previous state and the action at t_1+H-1? Actually, no: the position at turn t is the state after the action of the previous turn? \n\nThe game dynamics: \n  At turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo the position at turn t is (0, y_t). \n\nWe want at some turn T, we are at (0,9). The turn T must be >= t_1.\n\nIn the sequence of actions: we start at turn t_1, and we take an action a_{t_1} which will determine y_{t_1+1}. Then at turn t_1+1, we are at y_{t_1+1}. \n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1, that means we must have y_{t_1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow many actions do we take? We take actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-2? Because the last action that affects the position at turn t_1+H-1 is taken at turn t_1+H-2.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t_1+0}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1+H-1}. That would be H actions, which would affect positions from turn t_1+1 to t_1+H.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1+H-1} = 9, we must achieve that by the actions taken from t_1 to t_1+H-2? So the last action we take that matters is at turn t_1+H-2. Then the action at turn t_1+H-1 would be taken but it doesn't affect y_{t_1+H-1} (it affects y_{t_1+H}).\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nSo we take H actions: at t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 is given and not changed by a_{t_1} until the next turn.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1}, we are at y_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1+H-1}, we are at y_{t_1+H} at turn t_1+H.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. That is, we want y_{t_1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut the action a_{t_1+H-1} taken at turn t_1+H-1 will change y_{t_1+H-1} to y_{t_1+H}. So at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y_{t_1+H-1} (which we want to be 9) and then we take an action that moves us to y_{t_1+H}. \n\nSo we can be at 9 at turn t_1+H-1, and then we take an action (which might move us away, but we don't care as long as at turn t_1+H-1 we are at 9).\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. So we must have y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nThe actions we take from t_1 to t_1+H-2 determine y_{t_1+H-1}. And the action at t_1+H-1 doesn't affect y_{t_1+H-1} (it affects the next state). \n\nSo we need to take actions at t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-2 to get to y_{t_1+H-1}=9. That is H-1 actions. But the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+H-1}. So we have one extra action at the end.\n\nThis suggests that H must be at least the number of steps to get from y_0 to 9 plus one? Or perhaps we can choose the last action arbitrarily?\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn from t_1 to t_1+H-1. At turn t_1+H-1, we are at y_{t_1+H-1}=9, which is not a freeway, so safe. Then the action at t_1+H-1 can be anything (but we must output it). \n\nIn our case, we want to get to y=9 at turn t_1+? \n\nWe start at y_17=2. We want y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves (actions) to go from 2 to 9 is 7 moves (each U). Then we would have:\n\nAfter 0 actions: at turn17: y17=2.\nAfter 1st action (a17): y18 = 2 + (0 or 1 or -1) -> we want to go to 3? \nAfter 7 actions: at turn17+7=24, we are at y24 = 9.\n\nBut we want to be at y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nSo 17+H-1 = 24 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nAnd the actions: from t_1=17 to t_1+H-1=17+7=24? But H=8, so t_1+H-1=17+7=24, so we take actions at turns 17,18,...,24? That would be 8 actions.\n\nBut we only need 7 actions to get from y17=2 to y24=9. The 8th action at turn24 is taken after we are already at y24=9. \n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn17: a17 = U -> y18=3\nTurn18: a18 = U -> y19=4\n...\nTurn23: a23 = U -> y24=9\nThen at turn24: we are at y24=9. We take an action a24? But we are already at the goal at turn24. The problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1=17+8-1=24. So at turn24, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action a24 at turn24, but that action doesn't change the fact that at turn24 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the collision check: at turn24, we are at y24=9 -> safe (no freeway). Then we take an action at turn24, which will move us to y25. But we don't care about y25.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8? But that seems inefficient because we are taking an extra action.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at (0,9) at turn23? Then we would set t_1+H-1=17+H-1=23 -> H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nThen we need y23=9.\n\nStarting from y17=2, to y23=9: that requires 6 steps? But 2+6=8, not 9. So we need 7 steps to go from 2 to 9. So we cannot be at 9 at turn23.\n\nThe positions:\n\nturn17: y=2\nAfter action at17: turn18: y=3\n...\nAfter action at23: turn24: y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn24. So the earliest turn at which we are at 9 is turn24.\n\nTherefore, we must have 17+H-1 = 24 -> H=8.\n\nAnd the actions: 7 U's and then the last action (at turn24) can be anything? But the problem says we have to output H actions. And we are required to avoid collisions at every turn from 17 to 24.\n\nAt turn24, we are at y=9 -> safe. So the last action can be, say, S (stay) or U (but then we would go to 10, but the grid bounds: y in [0,9] -> if we try to go above 9, it stays at 9? The update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then clipped to [0,9]? \n\nThe problem says: y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]. So if we go above, it becomes 9? \n\nBut in the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and then we have y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, then 9+1=10 -> which is then set to 9? So effectively we stay.\n\nSimilarly, D would go to 8.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do S at the last action.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nWe take 7 U's and then one S? But we don't need the last action to do anything. But we have to output H=8 actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U -> this gets us to y24=9 at turn24.\nTurn24: S (or anything) -> but we are at turn24 and we take action at24, which sets y25. But at turn24, we are already at 9, and the goal is achieved at turn24. Then at turn24 we take an action, but we don't care about the state after.\n\nBut we must avoid collision at turn24: we are at y24=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence of 8 actions: 7 U's and 1 S at the end.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn from 17 to 24. We already checked that at turns 17 to 23 we are safe (since we are at freeways 2 to 8 at turns 17 to 23 respectively, and we checked they are safe). At turn24 we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a way to get there in fewer than 8 turns? \n\nH is the number of actions, and we need to be at 9 at turn17+H-1.\n\nWe need at least 7 steps to go from 2 to 9. So the minimal turn to be at 9 is turn17+7=24. So we must have 17+H-1=24 -> H=8.\n\nThus minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait: what if we can go faster? We can only move one per turn. 2 to 9 is 7 steps, so 7 actions, but then the turn at which we arrive is 17+7=24. So we need H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm: we take actions at turns 17,18,...,23 (7 actions) to get to y24=9 at turn24. Then we must also take an action at turn24? But the sequence requires H actions. So if H=7, then we take actions at turns17,18,...,23. Then at turn24, we are at y24=9, which is the goal. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1 = 17+7-1=23. But at turn23, we are at y23=8 (because after 6 actions: turns17 to22, we are at y23=8? Then at turn23 we take the 7th action (U) to go to y24=9. But at turn23, we are at y23=8, not 9.\n\nSo we are not at 9 at turn23. Therefore, H=7 is not sufficient.\n\nHence, we need H=8: we take actions at turns17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. We want to be at (0,9) at turn24 (which is t_1+H-1=17+8-1=24). And we are: because after the action at turn23, we are at y24=9. Then at turn24, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at turn24 (which we can choose arbitrarily, say S) but it doesn't affect the state at turn24.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: S\n\nBut we must check that during turns17 to24, we don't collide. We already did for turns17 to23: safe. Turn24: y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: at turn24, we are at y=9, so no freeway, safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, and the actions are 7 U's and then one S.\n\nBut we can do the last action as U? Then we try to go to 10, but it becomes 9. So same as S. So we can do U again? Or S. It doesn't matter.\n\nI think the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\nIs there a way with H=7? We would need to be at (0,9) at turn17+7-1=23. So at turn23, we must be at y23=9.\n\nBut starting from y17=2, we can do 7 actions? But 7 actions would take us to:\n\nAfter action at17: y18=3\n...\nAfter action at22: y23=8\nAfter action at23: y24=?\n\nTo be at y23=9, we must have been at y22=8 and then done U at turn22? But then at turn23, we are at y23=9? \n\nBut the action at turn22: if we do U at turn22, then y23 = y22+1. So if we want y23=9, then at turn22 we must be at y22=8 and do U.\n\nSimilarly, we need to get to y22=8 by turn22.\n\nStarting at y17=2, to get to y22=8: that requires 6 steps (because 2+6=8). So we can do 6 U's: at turns17 to22: 6 U's, then we are at y22=8? \n\nAt turn17: start at 2\nTurn17: U -> y18=3\nTurn18: U -> y19=4\nTurn19: U -> y20=5\nTurn20: U -> y21=6\nTurn21: U -> y22=7\nTurn22: U -> y23=8\n\nNot 8? We are at 8 at turn23. But we want 9 at turn23. So we need to be at 9 at turn23: so we need y23=9.\n\nWe need to get from 2 to 9 in 6 steps? 2+6=8, so we cannot. The minimal steps to go from 2 to 9 is 7. So we need 7 moves, which take 7 actions, and then we are at turn24.\n\nHence, H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about moving faster? We can only move one per turn. So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 turns with 7 U's and 1 S at the end.\n\nBut let me write the actions for turns 17 to 24.\n\nNote: the problem says the current turn is t_1=17, and we output:\n\nTurn 17: a_{17}\nTurn 18: a_{18}\n...\nTurn 24: a_{24}   (since H=8, the last action is at t_1+H-1=17+7=24)\n\nAnd we set a17 to a23 as U, and a24 as S.\n\nBut we must check that during the journey, we avoid collisions. We did for turns17 to23. At turn24, we are at y24=9, safe.\n\nBut what about the car movements? We have to ensure that at each turn we are on a freeway, we avoid.\n\nAt turn17: y=2 -> freeway2: at T=17, car on freeway2: [-47, -36] -> safe.\nAt turn18: y=3 -> freeway3: at T=18: [ -47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\nAt turn19: y=4 -> freeway4: at T=19: [ -47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\nAt turn20: y=5 -> freeway5: at T=20: [ -47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\nAt turn21: y=6 -> freeway6: at T=21: [ -11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [-11+144,24+144]=[133,168] -> safe.\nAt turn22: y=7 -> freeway7: at T=22: [1+48*5,48+48*5]=[241,288] -> safe.\nAt turn23: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=23: [1+48*6,48+48*6]=[289,336] -> safe.\nAt turn24: y=9 -> not a freeway -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\n}\n\nBut note: the last action can be U as well, because if we do U at turn24, then y25 = min(9+1,9)=9. So it's the same. But to be explicit, we choose S.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not require the last action to be taken? But it says H actions. So we must output 8 actions.\n\nWe'll output S for the last.\n\nSo this is the plan.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) at turn 24 (since \\(t_1 = 17\\) and \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 24\\) implies \\(H = 8\\)) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 17, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n- From turn 17 to turn 23, the action is \"U\" (up) to move vertically from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 7 steps, as \\(9 - 2 = 7\\) and each \"U\" increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- At turn 24, the player is already at (0, 9), so the action \"S\" (stay) is chosen to maintain the position. Any action (\"U\", \"D\", or \"S\") is safe at \\(y = 9\\) since it is not a freeway, but \"S\" is used for clarity.\n\nCollision checks are performed for each turn from 17 to 24, considering the player's \\(y\\)-position and the car spans on the corresponding freeway at that turn. The car spans are calculated using the update rules for right-moving cars (given direction \"right\"):\n\n- For freeway \\(k\\) at turn \\(T\\), the car span is \\([\\tau + s \\cdot (T - 17), h + s \\cdot (T - 17)]\\), where \\((h, \\tau, d, s)\\) are the car parameters.\n\nThe collision checks confirm safety:\n- **Turn 17 (\\(y = 2\\))**: Freeway 2 car span \\([-47, -36]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 18 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Freeway 3 car span \\([-41, -30]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 19 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 car span \\([-35, -24]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 20 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 car span \\([-29, -18]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 21 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 car span \\([133, 168]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 22 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 car span \\([241, 288]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 23 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 car span \\([289, 336]\\) does not contain 0.\n- **Turn 24 (\\(y = 9\\))**: Not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 19, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on the original row (y) and then at turn T+1 they are on the new row (y+1 or y-1). Therefore, when moving, the player is only subject to the car on the current row at the time of the turn.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions (U, D, S) from turn t1=19 to turn t1+H-1 (so the last action is at turn t1+H-1) such that the player ends at y=9.\n\nThe grid has freeways from y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=4 and must end at y=9. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars) but we cannot go above 9 or below 0.\n\nThe car update:\nFor each car, we are given the state at turn t1=19. We then need to compute the car's span at any future turn T (T>=19).\n\nGiven a car at freeway k (which is row k) with (head, tail, direction, speed) at t1=19.\n\nFor left-moving cars (but note: the problem says left-moving: span at T = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. However, note the representation:\n\nIn the table, for a right-moving car, the initial span at t1 is given as (head, tail, right, speed) and the span is [tau, head]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). We must interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car: the initial span at t1 is [tail, head] (so head is the front, and tail is the rear). Then at time T, the car moves right so the entire span shifts right by s*(T-t1). Similarly, for left-moving: the initial span is [head, tail] (with head being the front, which is more left? Actually, for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and h should be the front? But the problem says: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So h is the front? But then h must be less than tau? Actually, for left-moving, the car moves to the left, so the front (head) is at a smaller x than the tail? That would be inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that at t1, the car occupies from x=h to x=tau. Then at T, it moves left, so both h and tau are shifted left by s*(T-t1). But then if the car is moving left, the front is at the left, so h should be the leftmost point? Then the head is at h and the tail at tau? But then tau would be to the right of h? Then the car would be from h (left) to tau (right) but moving left? That doesn't make sense because then the front (which is the leading part) should be at the left? Actually, if moving left, the front is the leftmost point. So the head is at h (the leftmost) and the tail at tau (the rightmost). Then the span is [h, tau] and when moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> meaning the car is from tau to h? Then at T: [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So tau is the leftmost? and h the rightmost? But the problem says: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So tau is the left end and h is the right end.\n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). How are head and tail defined?\n\nLooking at the problem: \nFor left-moving: head is the front? and tail is the rear? Then for left-moving, the front (head) is the leftmost point? and the rear (tail) is the rightmost point? Then the span is [head, tail] (from left to right) and moving left, so both head and tail decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: head is the front (which is the rightmost point) and tail is the rear (leftmost point). Then the span is [tail, head] (from left to right) and moving right, so both tail and head increase.\n\nBut the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So in the data, the first number is tail and the second is head? That matches: for right-moving, tail is the left end and head is the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the data gives (head, tail) and the span is [head, tail] meaning head is the left end and tail is the right end? But the problem says: for left-moving, the span is [h, tau] and then [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So in the data, the first number (head) is the left end and the second (tail) is the right end.\n\nHowever, in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let's check:\n\nAll cars in the table are given as (head, tail, direction, speed) and the direction is \"right\". So:\n\nFor a right-moving car, the initial span at t1=19 is [tail, head] (so tail is the left end, head is the right end). Then at turn T, the span is [tail + s*(T-19), head + s*(T-19)].\n\nBut wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\", and in the data, the car is given as (h, tau, ...) but the problem uses tau as the tail? So in the data, the first number is head? and the second is tail? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me read the table:\n\nThe table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo the first number is called \"head\", the second \"tail\".\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the car spans from tail (left) to head (right). Therefore, the initial span is [tail, head]. Then at turn T, it becomes [tail + s*(T-19), head + s*(T-19)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost), so the initial span is [head, tail] and then becomes [head - s*(T-19), tail - s*(T-19)].\n\nIn our problem, all cars are right-moving. So we have:\n\nFreeway 1: head = -24, tail = -35, direction=right, speed=12 -> so the car is from -35 to -24 at t1=19. Then at turn T, the car is at [ -35 + 12*(T-19), -24 + 12*(T-19) ].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: head=-24, tail=-35, right, 6 -> [ -35 + 6*(T-19), -24 + 6*(T-19) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2\nFreeway 4: same as 2\nFreeway 5: same as 2\nFreeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, right, 36 -> [ -83 + 36*(T-19), -48 + 36*(T-19) ]\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, right, 48 -> [ -95 + 48*(T-19), -48 + 48*(T-19) ]\nFreeway 8: same as 7\n\nCollision: when the player is at freeway k at turn T, we check if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe need to move from y=4 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 5 moves (all U). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must plan the moves so that when we are on a freeway row (y=1 to 8) at a particular turn, the car on that row does not cover 0 at that turn.\n\nNote: We start at turn 19 at y=4. We are at row 4 at turn 19. So we must check the car on row 4 at turn 19: \nRow 4: car: [ -35 + 6*(0) ] = [-35, -24] at T=19? Actually, T=19: T-19=0 -> [ -35, -24] -> 0 is not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nThen we can plan the next moves.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H. We can try to go as fast as possible (always U) and see if we can avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future turns:\n\nWe are at turn 19. We are going to simulate turns: 19, 20, 21, ...\n\nThe player:\nAt turn 19: y=4.\n\nWe can choose actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay).\n\nWe want to reach y=9. We are at y=4, so we need to go up 5 times. But we might have to wait sometimes? Or go down? But going down would be away from the goal, so probably not optimal. However, we might have to avoid a car by staying or even going down to let a car pass? But since the cars are moving and we are at x=0, we only care if the car covers x=0 at the turn we are on that row.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and each future turn T when the car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nFor freeway k, we have the car's span at T: [L(T), R(T)] = [tail + s*(T-19), head + s*(T-19)] for right-moving cars.\n\nWe need to check when 0 is in [L(T), R(T)]: i.e., L(T) <= 0 <= R(T).\n\nSo for each freeway, we can compute the time interval (if any) when the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: the cars are long and moving, so they cover 0 for a continuous interval of time? Actually, turns are discrete.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: s=12, tail=-35, head=-24\n  L(T) = -35 + 12*(T-19)\n  R(T) = -24 + 12*(T-19)\n  We require: -35 + 12*(T-19) <= 0 <= -24 + 12*(T-19)\n\n  Solve:\n  First inequality: -35 + 12*(T-19) <= 0 -> 12*(T-19) <= 35 -> T-19 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> T <= 19+2.916 = 21.916 -> T<=21 (since T integer) for the left end? Actually, we need both.\n\n  Actually, we need:\n    -35 + 12*(T-19) <= 0   => T-19 >= ceil(35/12)? Not exactly. We have two conditions:\n\n  Condition 1: L(T) <= 0 -> -35 + 12*(T-19) <= 0 -> 12*(T-19) <= 35 -> T-19 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> so T-19 <= 2 -> T<=21? Or T-19 can be 3? Because 12*3=36>35 -> so T-19=0,1,2,3? Actually, let me compute:\n\n    T=19: -35<=0 -> true, and -24<=0 -> true? But we require 0 to be between L and R.\n\n  Actually, we require L(T) <= 0 and 0 <= R(T). \n\n  So:\n    L(T) <= 0: -35 + 12*(T-19) <= 0 -> 12*(T-19) <= 35 -> T-19 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> so T-19 can be 0,1,2 -> because at T-19=3: 12*3=36 -> -35+36=1>0 -> fails.\n\n    R(T) >= 0: -24 + 12*(T-19) >= 0 -> 12*(T-19) >= 24 -> T-19 >= 2.\n\n  So we need T-19>=2 and T-19<=2.916? So T-19=2? Because:\n      T=19: T-19=0 -> L(19)= -35<=0, but R(19)=-24<0 -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n      T=20: T-19=1 -> L(20)= -35+12=-23, R(20)=-24+12=-12 -> both negative -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n      T=21: T-19=2 -> L(21)= -35+24=-11, R(21)=-24+24=0 -> so 0 is in [-11,0]? Actually, 0 is the right endpoint -> included? Yes. So collision at T=21 on freeway1.\n      T=22: T-19=3 -> L(22)= -35+36=1, R(22)=-24+36=12 -> then 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway1 is dangerous only at T=21.\n\nFreeway2: s=6, tail=-35, head=-24\n  L(T)= -35+6*(T-19)\n  R(T)= -24+6*(T-19)\n\n  Conditions:\n    L(T)<=0: -35+6*(T-19)<=0 -> 6*(T-19)<=35 -> T-19 <= 35/6 ≈5.833 -> T<=24 (since 6*5=30<=35, 6*6=36>35 -> so T-19<=5 -> T<=24)\n    R(T)>=0: -24+6*(T-19)>=0 -> 6*(T-19)>=24 -> T-19>=4.\n\n  So T-19 must be between 4 and 5 (inclusive). \n    T=23: T-19=4 -> L(23)= -35+24=-11, R(23)= -24+24=0 -> 0 in [-11,0] -> collision.\n    T=24: T-19=5 -> L(24)= -35+30=-5, R(24)= -24+30=6 -> 0 in [-5,6] -> collision.\n    T=25: T-19=6 -> L(25)= -35+36=1, R(25)= -24+36=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway2: dangerous at T=23,24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: same as freeway2 -> dangerous at T=23,24.\nfreeway4: same -> dangerous at T=23,24.\nfreeway5: same -> dangerous at T=23,24.\n\nFreeway6: s=36, tail=-83, head=-48\n  L(T)= -83+36*(T-19)\n  R(T)= -48+36*(T-19)\n\n  Conditions:\n    L(T)<=0: -83+36*(T-19)<=0 -> 36*(T-19)<=83 -> T-19 <= 83/36 ≈2.305 -> T<=21 (since T-19=0,1,2)\n    R(T)>=0: -48+36*(T-19)>=0 -> 36*(T-19)>=48 -> T-19>=48/36≈1.333 -> T-19>=2? \n\n  So T-19 must be at least 2 and at most 2.305? Only T-19=2 -> T=21.\n      T=21: L(21)= -83+72=-11, R(21)= -48+72=24 -> 0 in [-11,24] -> collision.\n\n  So freeway6: dangerous at T=21.\n\nFreeway7: s=48, tail=-95, head=-48\n  L(T)= -95+48*(T-19)\n  R(T)= -48+48*(T-19)\n\n  Conditions:\n    L(T)<=0: -95+48*(T-19)<=0 -> 48*(T-19)<=95 -> T-19<=95/48≈1.979 -> T<=20 (because T-19=0,1) -> but wait, T-19=2: 48*2=96>95 -> so T-19<=1 -> T<=20? \n    Actually: T-19=0: -95<=0 -> true, but R(T)= -48<0 -> 0 not in the span? Then condition for R(T)>=0: \n    R(T)>=0: -48+48*(T-19)>=0 -> 48*(T-19)>=48 -> T-19>=1.\n\n  So T-19>=1 and T-19<=1.979 -> only T-19=1 -> T=20.\n      T=20: L(20)= -95+48*1 = -47, R(20)= -48+48=0 -> 0 in [-47,0] -> collision.\n\n  Also, check T=21: T-19=2 -> L(21)= -95+96=1, R(21)= -48+96=48 -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway7: dangerous at T=20.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> dangerous at T=20.\n\nSummary of dangerous times per row:\n\nRow 1: T=21\nRow 2: T=23,24\nRow 3: T=23,24\nRow 4: T=23,24\nRow 5: T=23,24\nRow 6: T=21\nRow 7: T=20\nRow 8: T=20\n\nWe start at T=19 at row4 (safe).\n\nWe need to go from row4 to row9. The minimal moves would be 5 moves (each U). But we have to avoid the dangerous times on the rows we step on.\n\nWe can simulate the moves. We have to decide the sequence of actions.\n\nNote: we are at T=19, y=4.\n\nWe can only change row by moving U or D. But we are at row4 and we want to go to row9 (up). So we should go up.\n\nLet me try to go straight up:\n\nOption 1: Always U from T=19 to T=23 (5 moves: T19, T20, T21, T22, T23) -> then we would be:\n\nAt T19: action U -> at T20: y=5 (because at T19 we do U, then at T20 we are at y=4+1=5)\nBut note: the action at T19: we start at T19 at y=4. We choose an action at T19 that will determine y at T20.\n\nActually, the state at T19: y=4. Then we choose a_{19} (which is the action at turn 19). Then at turn 20, the player's position is updated: y20 = y19 + Delta y19.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 19: we are at y=4. We choose an action (U, D, or S). Then at turn 20, we are at y = 4 + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S).\n\nThen at turn 20, we are on row y20 and we must check the car on that row at turn 20.\n\nPlan for always U:\n\nT19: action U -> then at T20: y=5 -> row5? But row5 is freeway? yes, row5 is freeway. Check row5 at T20: \nRow5: dangerous at T23,24 -> so T20 is safe? yes.\n\nT20: action U -> then at T21: y=6 -> row6. Check row6 at T21: dangerous? yes, row6 is dangerous at T21 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at T20 because we would be on row6 at T21 and collide.\n\nWe must avoid being on row6 at T21.\n\nAlternative: at T19, we do not go up? But we have to go up eventually.\n\nWe can wait at row4 for one turn? Then at T19: we do S (stay). Then at T20: y=4 -> row4. Check row4 at T20: dangerous? row4 is dangerous at T23,24 -> T20 is safe.\n\nThen at T20: we do U -> then at T21: y=5 -> row5. Check row5 at T21: row5 is dangerous at T23,24 -> T21 safe.\n\nThen at T21: we do U -> then at T22: y=6 -> row6. Check row6 at T22: \nRow6: we computed dangerous only at T21 -> T22 is safe? \nFor row6: \n  T=22: T-19=3 -> L(22)= -83+36*3 = -83+108=25, R(22)= -48+108=60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSo at T22: we are on row6 -> safe.\n\nThen at T22: we do U -> then at T23: y=7 -> row7. Check row7 at T23: \nRow7: dangerous at T20 -> T23 is safe? \nRow7: we computed dangerous only at T20. At T23: \n  T23: T-19=4 -> L(23)= -95+48*4 = -95+192=97, R(23)= -48+192=144 -> 0 not in [97,144] -> safe.\n\nThen at T23: we do U -> then at T24: y=8 -> row8. Check row8 at T24: \nRow8: dangerous at T20 -> T24: \n  T24: T-19=5 -> L(24)= -95+48*5 = -95+240=145, R(24)= -48+240=192 -> safe.\n\nThen at T24: we do U -> then at T25: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn19: S (stay at row4 at T19 -> then at T20 we are at row4? Actually, we are at row4 at T19 and we do S -> so at T20 we are still at row4? Then we check row4 at T20: safe? yes.\n\nBut note: we start at T19 at row4 and we do S -> then at T20, we are still at row4.\n\nThen at T20: we do U -> then at T21: y=5 -> row5 -> safe (row5 at T21 is safe).\n\nThen at T21: we do U -> then at T22: y=6 -> row6 -> safe (as above).\n\nThen at T22: we do U -> then at T23: y=7 -> row7 -> safe.\n\nThen at T23: we do U -> then at T24: y=8 -> row8 -> safe.\n\nThen at T24: we do U -> then at T25: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from T19 to T24 (actions at T19,20,21,22,23,24) -> 6 actions? Then H=6? And we reach y=9 at turn T25? But the problem: we need to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the sequence is from t=t1 (19) to t1+H-1. And after H actions, we are at turn t1+H? \n\nThe player update: at turn t, we do action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at the new position.\n\nWe start at turn t1=19 at y=4.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done actions at turns 19, 20, ..., 19+H-1. Then at turn 19+H, we are at the new position.\n\nWe require that at turn 19+H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan, we do 6 actions: at T19, T20, T21, T22, T23, T24. Then at T25, we are at y=9. So H=6, and we are at y=9 at turn 19+6=25.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Minimal H.\n\nWe tried going straight up and got stuck at T21 on row6. Then we delayed the move to row6 by one turn. But maybe we can go faster by going up twice in a row? Or avoid waiting?\n\nAlternative: at T19: we go up to row5. Then at T20: we are at row5. Then at T20: we want to go to row6? But row6 at T21 is dangerous. So we cannot go to row6 at T21. So we must avoid being on row6 at T21.\n\nAt T20: we are at row5. We can do S at T20? Then at T21: we are at row5 -> safe. Then at T21: we go to row6 -> but row6 at T21 is dangerous -> collision. So that doesn't help.\n\nAt T20: we can do D? Then at T21: we go back to row4. Then at T21: row4 is safe? Yes, because row4 is only dangerous at T23,24. Then at T21: we do U -> then at T22: we are at row5. Then at T22: we do U -> at T23: row6 -> safe (because row6 only dangerous at T21). Then at T23: we do U -> at T24: row7 -> safe. Then at T24: U -> at T25: row8 -> safe? Then at T25: U -> at T26: row9. This takes 7 actions: T19:U, T20:D, T21:U, T22:U, T23:U, T24:U, T25:U -> 7 actions. Worse than the 6 we had.\n\nSo the previous plan (with a wait at T19) is better.\n\nBut can we do it in 5 actions? We need 5 moves up. Then we would be at row9 at turn19+5=24.\n\nWe start at T19: y=4.\n\nT19: U -> T20: y=5 -> safe (row5 at T20 safe)\nT20: U -> T21: y=6 -> collision (row6 at T21 dangerous) -> fails.\n\nT19: U -> T20: y=5 -> safe\nT20: S -> T21: y=5 -> safe\nT21: U -> T22: y=6 -> safe (row6 at T22 safe)\nT22: U -> T23: y=7 -> safe\nT23: U -> T24: y=8 -> safe\nT24: U -> T25: y=9 -> goal. This is 6 actions (T19:U, T20:S, T21:U, T22:U, T23:U, T24:U). Same as before.\n\nBut note: in the first plan we did T19:S, T20:U, T21:U, T22:U, T23:U, T24:U -> also 6 actions.\n\nIs there a way with 5 actions? We need to avoid row6 at T21. The only way to get to row6 without being at T21 is to be at row6 at a different time. But to be at row6 at T20? That would require:\n\nAt T19: we are at row4. To be at row6 at T20, we would have to move up twice? But we can only do one action per turn. So at T19: we do U -> then at T20: we are at row5. Then at T20: we do U -> at T21: row6. We cannot get to row6 at T20.\n\nTo be at row6 at T22: then we would do:\n\nT19: U -> T20: row5\nT20: U -> T21: row6 -> but T21 is dangerous -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the collision at row6 on T21 by being there at T20 or T22? But we can only get to row6 at T21 by moving from row5 at T20 to row6 at T21. And we cannot skip row6.\n\nSo we must not be at row6 at T21. Therefore, we must delay the move to row6 until T22. \n\nBut to be at row6 at T22, we must be at row5 at T21. And to be at row5 at T21, we must be at row4 or row5 or row6 at T20? \n\nWe start at row4 at T19. \n\nOption:\n  T19: U -> T20: row5\n  T20: S -> T21: row5 -> safe\n  T21: U -> T22: row6 -> safe\n\nThen we have T22: row6 -> safe. Then we need to go to row9: 3 more moves: T22:U->T23:row7, T23:U->T24:row8, T24:U->T25:row9. Total 5 moves? But we did 4 actions: T19:U, T20:S, T21:U, T22:U, T23:U, T24:U? That's 6 actions again.\n\nWait, after T19:U (action1) -> T20: row5\nT20:S (action2) -> T21: row5\nT21:U (action3) -> T22: row6\nT22:U (action4) -> T23: row7\nT23:U (action5) -> T24: row8\nT24:U (action6) -> T25: row9.\n\nStill 6.\n\nBut we want to be at row9 at T24? Then we must be at row8 at T23. To be at row8 at T23, we must be at row7 at T22. To be at row7 at T22, we must be at row6 at T21. But row6 at T21 is dangerous. So we cannot be at row6 at T21.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get to row9 by T24. The earliest is T25.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, the two sequences we have:\n\nOption A:\n  T19: S -> then at T20: row4\n  T20: U -> T21: row5\n  T21: U -> T22: row6\n  T22: U -> T23: row7\n  T23: U -> T24: row8\n  T24: U -> T25: row9\n\nOption B:\n  T19: U -> T20: row5\n  T20: S -> T21: row5\n  T21: U -> T22: row6\n  T22: U -> T23: row7\n  T23: U -> T24: row8\n  T24: U -> T25: row9\n\nBoth are 6 actions.\n\nBut we must check if they are safe.\n\nOption A:\n\nT19: at row4 -> safe (we start there, and we checked row4 at T19 safe)\nT19: action S -> then at T20: we are at row4. Check row4 at T20: \n  Row4: car at T20: T20-19=1 -> [ -35+6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nT20: action U -> at T21: row5. Check row5 at T21: \n  Row5: car: same as row4? Actually, row5 has a car: head=-24, tail=-35, s=6 -> [ -35+6*(21-19)= -35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nT21: action U -> at T22: row6. Check row6 at T22: \n  Row6: car: head=-48, tail=-83, s=36 -> T22-19=3 -> [ -83+36*3=-83+108=25, -48+108=60] -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nT22: action U -> at T23: row7. Check row7 at T23: \n  Row7: car: head=-48, tail=-95, s=48 -> T23-19=4 -> [ -95+192=97, -48+192=144] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nT23: action U -> at T24: row8. Check row8 at T24: \n  Row8: same as row7? -> [ -95+48*5=-95+240=145, -48+240=192] -> safe.\n\nT24: action U -> at T25: row9 -> goal.\n\nOption B:\n\nT19: U -> at T20: row5. Check row5 at T20: \n  Row5: [ -35+6*(20-19)= -29, -24+6=-18] -> safe.\n\nT20: S -> at T21: row5. Check row5 at T21: \n  [ -35+6*2=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n\nT21: U -> at T22: row6. Check row6 at T22: \n  [ -83+36*3=25, -48+108=60] -> safe.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nBut which one is minimal? Both have H=6.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: we start at row4. In option A, we stay at row4 for an extra turn. In option B, we go to row5 and then stay.\n\nBut both take the same number of turns.\n\nWe can also consider if we can go up to row5 at T19, then at T20 we go down to row4? Then at T21 we go up to row5? Then we would be:\n\nT19: U -> T20: row5 -> safe\nT20: D -> T21: row4 -> safe (row4 at T21: T21-19=2 -> [ -35+6*2=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe? Actually, row4 at T21: \n  [ -35+12 = -23? Actually, row4 has s=6? So [ -35+6*2=-23, -24+6*2=-12] -> safe.\nThen T21: U -> T22: row5 -> safe (row5 at T22: T22-19=3 -> [ -35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe)\nThen T22: U -> T23: row6 -> safe (as before)\nThen T23: U -> T24: row7\nThen T24: U -> T25: row8\nThen T25: U -> T26: row9 -> that's 7 actions, worse.\n\nSo we stick to 6.\n\nWe can output either option.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for minimal H. We have H=6.\n\nNow, the answer format: we list the actions from turn t1=19 to turn t1+H-1 = 19+6-1=24.\n\nSo 6 actions: at turns 19,20,21,22,23,24.\n\nFor option A: \n  Turn19: S\n  Turn20: U\n  Turn21: U\n  Turn22: U\n  Turn23: U\n  Turn24: U\n\nFor option B:\n  Turn19: U\n  Turn20: S\n  Turn21: U\n  Turn22: U\n  Turn23: U\n  Turn24: U\n\nWe can choose one. Let me choose option A.\n\nBut wait: at the start, we are at row4 at T19. If we do S at T19, we stay at row4 at T20. Then we start moving.\n\nBut what about the cars on row4 at T20? We computed: row4 at T20 is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider if we can avoid row5 at a dangerous time? But row5 is dangerous at T23 and T24. In our plan, we are at row5 at T21 (in option A) and at T20 and T21 (in option B). Both T20 and T21 are safe for row5.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nI'll go with option A.\n\nBut let me check if there is a plan that takes less than 6? We saw that 5 is not possible.\n\nAnother idea: go up to row5 at T19, then at T20 go to row6? But row6 at T21 is dangerous, and we cannot be at row6 at T20. So no.\n\nOr: at T19: U -> row5 at T20\nT20: U -> row6 at T21 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t_1=19, H=6, so t from 0 to 5: \na_{19+0}=a19 = S\na20 = U\na21 = U\na22 = U\na23 = U\na24 = U\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise, the turns are: \nTurn 19: a_{19} = S\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U\nTurn 22: a_{22} = U\nTurn 23: a_{23} = U\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 6 actions? And H=6? Then the last action is at turn 19+5=24? And at turn 25 we are at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, we could output option B. But I think both are acceptable.\n\nBut let me double-check option B:\n\nOption B:\n  T19: U -> at T20: row5 -> safe (row5 at T20: [-29,-18] safe)\n  T20: S -> at T21: row5 -> safe (row5 at T21: [-23,-12] safe)\n  T21: U -> at T22: row6 -> safe (row6 at T22: [25,60] safe)\n  T22: U -> at T23: row7 -> safe\n  T23: U -> at T24: row8 -> safe\n  T24: U -> at T25: row9 -> goal.\n\nAlso safe.\n\nBut note: in option B, we are at row5 at T20 and T21. Is there a problem? Row5 is dangerous at T23 and T24, which we avoid. So both are safe.\n\nBut the problem says to output the minimal H and a sequence. Since both have H=6, we can choose either.\n\nI'll choose option A because it starts with a stay, which might be more conservative.\n\nBut actually, we can also consider if we can do a down move? But that would take more moves.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nHere t_1=19, H=6, so t=0 -> a19, t=1->a20, ... t=5->a24.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd at turn 19+6=25, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) is 6. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by carefully timing movements to bypass dangerous turns when cars occupy position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Solution Reasoning:\n- **Initial Position**: At turn 19, the player is at \\(y = 4\\). The car on freeway 4 at turn 19 is safe (span \\([-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span).\n- **Dangerous Turns** (collisions if on freeway at these turns):\n  - Freeway 1: turn 21\n  - Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5: turns 23, 24\n  - Freeway 6: turn 21\n  - Freeway 7, 8: turn 20\n- **Strategy**: \n  - **Turn 19**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 4\\) to avoid moving prematurely. At turn 20, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (car span \\([-29, -18]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - **Turn 20**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\). At turn 21, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (car span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - **Turn 21**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\). At turn 22, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (car span \\([25, 60]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - **Turn 22**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\). At turn 23, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (car span \\([97, 144]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - **Turn 23**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\). At turn 24, \\(y = 8\\) is safe (car span \\([145, 192]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - **Turn 24**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\), reaching the goal at turn 25.\n- **Why minimal?** A direct path (5 consecutive U moves) fails due to collisions (e.g., at turn 21 on \\(y = 6\\)). Alternative paths (e.g., using D or extra S) require more turns. \\(H = 6\\) is the minimum.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn 19 to turn 24 (6 actions) ensures arrival at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 25:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 21, and I start at y=0. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1=21. Since all cars are moving right in this case, according to the car update rules:\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], because initially at t_1, span is [τ, h] for right-moving, so after time Δt = T - t_1, it moves right by s*Δt, so new head is h + s*Δt, new tail is τ + s*Δt, so span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span. That means the car is crossing x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, important: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you decide to move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you only check collision for y_T at turn T. Then at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check for that freeway.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nThat means at turn T, you are only concerned with cars on your current row y_T for that turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, because cars are only on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal, both should be safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, each with one car listed.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at t_1=21:\n\nFreeway 1: head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12\n\nFreeway 2: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6\n\nFreeway 3: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6\n\nFreeway 4: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6\n\nFreeway 5: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=6\n\nFreeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, direction=right, speed=36\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48\n\nFreeway 8: head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48\n\nAll are right-moving.\n\nSince they're all moving right, their spans are shifting to the right over time.\n\nFor collision, at a given turn T and freeway k, we need to see if 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nThe span at time T for a car on freeway k is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving, since initial at t_1 is [τ, h].\n\nFor freeway 1, at t_1, span [37,48]? Head is 48, tail is 37, so if right-moving, head is larger, so span [tail, head] = [37,48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nGeneral formula: for right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T - t_1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all right here.\n\nNow t_1 = 21.\n\nI need to find when each freeway has a car crossing x=0, meaning when 0 is in the span for some T.\n\nSince the car is moving, it will cross x=0 at some time.\n\nFor each freeway, I can find the times when collision occurs, i.e., when 0 is in the span.\n\nThen, to avoid collision, when I am on that freeway at turn T, it must not be that 0 is in the span at T for the car on that row.\n\nSince each row has only one car, I think.\n\nThe table has one car per freeway.\n\nSo, for each freeway, I need to find the set of turns T where collision is possible.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1 = T - 21\n\nThen for a car, 0 is in span at T if:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSo, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for Δt.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nSo Δt must satisfy: -h / s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nSince τ < h for right-moving? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, tail τ, head h, with h > τ, since head is front.\n\nIn the notation, for freeway 1, head=48, tail=37, so h=48, τ=37, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2, head=-48, tail=-59, so h=-48, τ=-59, since -48 > -59, so h > τ still.\n\nh is the head position, which is larger for right-moving.\n\nSo in general, for right-moving, h > τ, so -h < -τ, since both negative? Not necessarily.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: h=48, τ=37, s=12\n\nThen Δt ≥ -h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nBut Δt = T - 21, which is time from now, so for T >=21, Δt >=0.\n\nBut -4 and -3.083 are negative, so for Δt >=0, the inequality Δt >= -4 is always true since -4<0, and Δt <= -3.083 is false for Δt>=0.\n\nLet me calculate numerically.\n\n-h/s = -48/12 = -4\n\n-τ/s = -37/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nNow, τ + s Δt <=0 and 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nFirst: s Δt <= -τ ⇒ Δt <= -τ/s ≈ -3.083? -τ/s = -37/12 = -37/12 = -3 1/12 ≈ -3.083\n\nBut Δt <= -3.083, and since Δt >=0, this is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, second: Δt >= -h/s = -4, which is true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut both must hold: Δt >= -4 and Δt <= -3.083. Since -4 < -3.083, for Δt in [-4, -3.083], but this interval is negative, so for T>=21, Δt>=0, which is not in [-4,-3.083], so 0 is never in the span for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, let's check.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=21, span is [37,48], 0 not in it.\n\nAs time increases, s Δt >0, so τ + s Δt increases from 37, h + s Δt from 48, both increasing, so span moves right, away from 0, so 0 never crossed. So freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm with the inequality.\n\nΔt must be in [-4, -3.083] for collision, but this is negative time, before t_1, so at and after t_1, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nThen Δt >= -h/s = -(-48)/6 = 48/6 = 8\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-59)/6 = 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nSo Δt >=8 and Δt <=9.833, so for Δt=8 and Δt=9, since Δt integer? Turns are discrete, so T integer, Δt integer.\n\nΔt >=8 and Δt <=9.833, so Δt=8,9\n\nΔt=8: T = t_1 + Δt = 21+8=29\n\nΔt=9: T=21+9=30\n\nNow check: at T=29, Δt=8, span: τ + s Δt = -59 + 6*8 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, yes collision.\n\nAt T=30, Δt=9, τ + s Δt = -59 + 54 = -5\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 54 = 6\n\nspan [-5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nAt T=31, Δt=10, τ + s Δt = -59+60=1, h + s Δt = -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, so only T=29 and T=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, head=-48, tail=-59, speed=6, so same, collision at T=29 and 30.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at 29,30.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at 29,30.\n\nNow freeway 6: head=-48, tail=-83, speed=36\n\nThen Δt >= -h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo Δt >=1.333 and <=2.305, so Δt=2? Since integer, Δt=2 only? 1.333 to 2.305, so Δt=2.\n\nΔt=1: 1<1.333? No, Δt=1 < 1.333, not >=\n\nΔt=2: 2>=1.333 and 2<=2.305, yes\n\nΔt=3: 3>2.305, no\n\nSo only Δt=2, T=21+2=23\n\nCheck: at T=23, Δt=2, τ + s Δt = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 72 = 24\n\nspan [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nAt T=22, Δt=1, τ + s Δt = -83 + 36 = -47\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 36 = -12\n\nspan [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=24, Δt=3, τ + s Δt = -83 + 108 = 25\n\nh + s Δt = -48 + 108 = 60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=23 for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-48)/48 = 48/48 =1\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-95)/48 = 95/48 ≈1.979\n\nSo Δt >=1 and <=1.979, so Δt=1? 1 to 1.979, integer, so Δt=1.\n\nT=21+1=22\n\nCheck: τ + s Δt = -95 + 48*1 = -95 +48 = -47\n\nh + s Δt = -48 +48 =0\n\nspan [-47,0], 0 included.\n\nT=21, Δt=0, span [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nT=23, Δt=2, τ + s Δt = -95 + 96 =1, h + s Δt = -48 +96=48, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=22.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48, so collision at T=22 only.\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: no collision\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=29,30\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=29,30\n\nFreeway 4: T=29,30\n\nFreeway 5: T=29,30\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=23\n\nFreeway 7: collision at T=22\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=22\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, moving one row at a time, and at each turn, when I am on a freeway row (y=1 to 8), I must not be there when that row has collision.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nStart at T=21, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, the minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 actions, from T=21 to T=29, reaching y=9 at T=29? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, I start at y_T, and after action, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at T=21, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_{21}, which determines y_{22}.\n\nSimilarly, a_{22} determines y_{23}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe turn when I first reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no car, I can stay there or whatever, but I just need to reach it.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=0, and need to be at y=9, the minimal number of actions is 9, if I always go up, but I might need to wait or avoid collisions.\n\nWith 9 actions: from T=21 to T=29, y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt T=21: position y=0\n\nAfter action a_{21}, at T=22, y_{22} = y_{21} + Δy, depending on action.\n\nSet t=0 relative to t_1.\n\nLet k be the step, starting from k=0.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + k = 21 + k\n\nPosition: at turn 21 + k, y_{21+k}\n\nAfter action, at turn 21 + k+1, y_{21+k+1}\n\nStart: k=0, T=21, y=0\n\nAfter H actions, at T=21+H, y_{21+H} should be 9.\n\nSo I need y_{21+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H is 9, if I go up every time.\n\nBut I need to check if I can go directly up without collision.\n\nNow, I need to be on each row y=1 to 8 at some point, and avoid being there when collision happens for that row.\n\nBut collision times are different for each row.\n\nAlso, since I move step by step, I will be on each row exactly once if I go directly, but I might stay or move down to avoid, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row the unsafe times when I cannot be on that row.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): no collision ever, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): unsafe at T=29,30\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): unsafe T=29,30\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): unsafe T=29,30\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): unsafe T=29,30\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): unsafe at T=23\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at T=22\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): unsafe at T=22\n\nNow, I start at T=21, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are that row 7 and 8 are unsafe at T=22, which is soon, and row 6 at T=23.\n\nIf I go directly up:\n\nAt T=21: y=0, safe (no car)\n\nAction U: go to y=1 at T=22? At T=21, I am on y=0, choose action U, so y_{22} = y_{21} +1 = 0+1=1\n\nThen at T=22, I am on y=1.\n\nAt T=22, I am on row y=1.\n\nBut row 1 is always safe, so no collision.\n\nNow, for row 7 and 8, unsafe at T=22, but I am not on them at T=22.\n\nAt T=22, I am on y=1.\n\nThen action: suppose U again, to go to y=2 at T=23.\n\nAt T=22, I choose action, say U, so y_{23} = y_{22} +1 =1+1=2\n\nAt T=23, I am on y=2.\n\nNow, at T=23, row 6 is unsafe, but I am on y=2, not y=6.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which is unsafe only at T=29,30, not now.\n\nSo at T=23, I am safe on y=2.\n\nContinue: action U, to y=3 at T=24.\n\nAt T=23, choose U, y_{24} = y_{23} +1 =2+1=3\n\nT=24, on y=3, safe since T=24 not 29 or 30.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=4 at T=25.\n\nT=24, U, y_{25} =4\n\nT=25, on y=4, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at T=26.\n\nT=25, U, y_{26} =5\n\nT=26, on y=5, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at T=27.\n\nT=26, U, y_{27} =6\n\nNow at T=27, I am on y=6.\n\nBut row 6 is unsafe only at T=23, which has passed, and T=27 is after, so should be safe.\n\nCheck row 6: unsafe only at T=23.\n\nAt T=27, no collision, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=7 at T=28.\n\nT=27, U, y_{28} =7\n\nT=28, on y=7.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=22, not 28, so safe.\n\nU to y=8 at T=29.\n\nT=28, U, y_{29} =8\n\nT=29, on y=8.\n\nBut row 8 is unsafe at T=29? T=29 is unsafe for rows 2,3,4,5.\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=22 only.\n\nT=22 has passed.\n\nAt T=29, row 8 should be safe.\n\nRow 8 collision only at T=22, as per above.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 only T=22.\n\nRow 6 only T=23.\n\nNow at T=29, I am on y=8.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at T=30.\n\nT=29, U, y_{30} =9\n\nT=30, on y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at T=30, rows 2,3,4,5 are unsafe.\n\nBut I am on y=9, so no issue.\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at T=30, with H=9 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart T=21, y=0\n\nAfter 1st action (k=0, a_{21}=U), T=22, y=1\n\nAfter 2nd action (a_{22}=U), T=23, y=2\n\nAfter 3rd action (a_{23}=U), T=24, y=3\n\nAfter 4th action (a_{24}=U), T=25, y=4\n\nAfter 5th action (a_{25}=U), T=26, y=5\n\nAfter 6th action (a_{26}=U), T=27, y=6\n\nAfter 7th action (a_{27}=U), T=28, y=7\n\nAfter 8th action (a_{28}=U), T=29, y=8\n\nAfter 9th action (a_{29}=U), T=30, y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, when I was on a freeway:\n\nT=22: y=1, row 1 safe\n\nT=23: y=2, row 2 unsafe only at T=29,30, not 23, so safe\n\nT=24: y=3, safe\n\nT=25: y=4, safe\n\nT=26: y=5, safe\n\nT=27: y=6, row 6 unsafe only at T=23, not 27, safe\n\nT=28: y=7, row 7 unsafe only at T=22, not 28, safe\n\nT=29: y=8, row 8 unsafe only at T=22, not 29, safe\n\nT=30: y=9, no car, safe\n\nSo all good, and I reached y=9 at T=30 with 9 actions.\n\nBut is T=30 the arrival? At T=30, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn count.\n\nThe sequence is from a_{21} to a_{29}, that's 9 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns? In the problem, it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\", I think at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see the indexing.\n\nIn the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the player update: after action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter actions from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have H actions, and at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, for H actions.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, at t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}, and so on, up to after a_{t_1 + H -1}, at t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the path above, with H=9 actions:\n\na_{21} to a_{29}, then at T=30, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H = 21 + 9 =30, y_{30}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd we reached in 9 turns, which is minimal possible since we need to increase y by 9.\n\nBut is there a problem? In this path, at no point was I on an unsafe row at the wrong time.\n\nFor example, at T=22, I was on y=1, safe.\n\nAt T=23, on y=2, which is safe since unsafe only later.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 are unsafe at T=22, but I was not on them.\n\nRow 6 unsafe at T=23, but at T=23 I was on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can go directly up in 9 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if row 1 is indeed always safe.\n\nFreeway 1: at any T, span: τ + s(T-21) = 37 + 12(T-21)\n\nh + s(T-21) = 48 + 12(T-21)\n\nFor T>=21, both >=37>0, so 0 not in span, yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the sequence, I used all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by moving faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so 9 is minimal.\n\nUnless I start from y=0 and go to y=9, 9 steps.\n\nBut at T=21, I am at y=0, and after first action, I go to y=1 at T=22, so I cannot be at y=9 before T=30 with only up moves.\n\nIf I stay or something, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see if I can avoid the unsafe times or something, but in this case, I don't encounter any collision.\n\nPerhaps for rows 2-5, they are unsafe at T=29,30, but I am on them earlier, so fine.\n\nBut in my sequence, I am on row 2 at T=23, which is before 29, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if at T=29 and 30, rows 2-5 are unsafe, but I am not on them at that time; I am on row 8 at T=29 and row 9 at T=30.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, all actions are U.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +8: a_{t_1+8} = U\n\nt_1=21, so actions from a_{21} to a_{29}, but a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=9, t from 0 to 8.\n\na_{21+0} = a_{21} = U\n\na_{21+1} = a_{22} = U\n\n...\n\na_{21+8} = a_{29} = U\n\nThen at T=30, y=9.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars?\n\nFor example, at T=22, row 7 and 8 have collision, but I am on row 1, not affected.\n\nSimilarly, at T=23, row 6 has collision, I am on row 2.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't.\n\nMaybe I can stay at some point to avoid, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see the car on row 6 at T=23, etc., but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach y=9 earlier by being on higher rows, but no, I start from 0.\n\nUnless I move down, but that would not help reaching faster.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but it doesn't help to go down.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all U is fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, they have high speeds, but in this path, I avoid the collision times.\n\nPerhaps for row 2,3,4,5, they have collision at T=29,30, which is late, so if I were on them later, it might be problem, but I am on them early.\n\nIn fact, since I go up quickly, I pass before the late unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, for early unsafe times, I pass after.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the position at each turn:\n\nTurn T | y position | Action chosen at T (for next y)\n\nAt T, I am at y_T, then I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy\n\nAnd at T, I must be safe on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nT=21: y=0, choose a_{21}=U, so y_{22}=1\n\nT=22: y=1, choose a_{22}=U, y_{23}=2\n\nT=23: y=2, choose a_{23}=U, y_{24}=3\n\nT=24: y=3, choose a_{24}=U, y_{25}=4\n\nT=25: y=4, choose a_{25}=U, y_{26}=5\n\nT=26: y=5, choose a_{26}=U, y_{27}=6\n\nT=27: y=6, choose a_{27}=U, y_{28}=7\n\nT=28: y=7, choose a_{28}=U, y_{29}=8\n\nT=29: y=8, choose a_{29}=U, y_{30}=9\n\nNow, at each T, y_T is safe:\n\nT=21: y=0, no car, safe\n\nT=22: y=1, freeway 1, no collision, safe\n\nT=23: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only at T=29,30, not 23, safe\n\nT=24: y=3, freeway 3, same, safe\n\nT=25: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=26: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=27: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only at T=23, not 27, safe\n\nT=28: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=22 only, not 28, safe\n\nT=29: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=22 only, not 29, safe\n\nT=30: y=9, goal, not on freeway.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to write the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with less than 9, impossible.\n\nPerhaps by moving down and up, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up, but I start at y=0, and need to go to 9, so staying or moving down increases H.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 21 to 29.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{21} to a_{29}, all U.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut in the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nH=9, but the sequence is given, and H is implied.\n\nThe answer should have the turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn the box, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=21.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as per the format.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6,7,8 again.\n\nFreeway 7: collision at T=22, but at T=22 I was on y=1, fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the position when moving, but the collision is only when on the row at that turn.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, for example, from y=7 to y=8 at T=28, I choose U, so at T=28 I am on y=7, which is safe, then at T=29 I am on y=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 9, with the sequence all U.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 21\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving upward (action \\(U\\)) at every turn, as this direct path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe, as the car span never includes \\(x=0\\) for \\(T \\geq 21\\).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Collision at \\(T=29\\) and \\(T=30\\).

The path is on \\(y=8\\) at \\(T=29\\), which is safe.\n\n### Path Summary:\n- At turn \\(T=21\\), start at \\(y=0\\) (safe, no cars).\n- After each \\(U\\) action, \\(y\\) increases by 1, reaching \\(y=9\\) at \\(T=30\\).\n- No collision occurs at any point, as the player is never on an unsafe freeway at the collision times.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=8\\) (i.e., turns 21 to 29) is all \\(U\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The current turn is t1 = 22, and I start at y=1. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, but since I'm starting on y=1, I need to be careful about collisions there too.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], where t1 is the current turn, 22.\n\nFor each freeway, I have the head and tail at t1=22.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: head h=60, tail τ=49, direction right, speed s=12. So at time T, span is [49 + 12(T-22), 60 + 12(T-22)]\n\n- Freeway 2: h=-42, τ=-53, right, s=6. Span: [-53 + 6(T-22), -42 + 6(T-22)]\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2? h=-42, τ=-53, right, s=6. Identical to freeway 2? That seems odd, but okay.\n\nThe table says for freeway 3,4,5 all have (-42,-53,right,6). And freeway 6: (-12,-47,right,36), freeway 7: (0,-47,right,48), freeway 8: (0,-47,right,48).\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are the same too? That might be a problem, but I'll go with it.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nImportant point: if I move to a new y at turn T, I am not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, when I take action, I am still on the current y, and I move to the new position at turn T+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t. I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, for collision at turn t: I am on freeway y_t at turn t, and for that freeway, if there is a car where 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if y_T is the freeway row, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nAnd the note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=22, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are boundaries, I think y=0 is the start, y=9 is the goal.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, I need to check if 0 is in the car span for that freeway at time T.\n\nIf I am on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9, so I have to pass through y=2 to y=8, but I can move up or down, so I might go down to y=0 first or something, but since y=0 is safe, it might be a way to avoid cars.\n\nBut I need to minimize turns, so probably going up directly is best, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find out when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway k, I need to find times T when 0 is NOT in the car span for that freeway at time T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at time T, 0 ∉ [τ + s(T - 22), h + s(T - 22)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all are right-moving, as per the table.\n\nFor freeway 1: τ=49, h=60, s=12, so span at T: [49 + 12(T-22), 60 + 12(T-22)]\n\nSet L1(T) = 49 + 12(T-22)\n\nH1(T) = 60 + 12(T-22)\n\n0 is in span if L1(T) <= 0 <= H1(T)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for freeway 1:\n\nL1(T) = 49 + 12(T-22) = 12T - 264 + 49 = 12T - 215\n\nH1(T) = 60 + 12(T-22) = 12T - 264 + 60 = 12T - 204\n\nSo 0 in span if 12T - 215 <= 0 <= 12T - 204\n\nWhich is 12T <= 215 and 12T >= 204? Let's see:\n\n12T - 215 <= 0 => T <= 215/12 = 17.916, so T <= 17 since T integer? Turn numbers are integers, I assume.\n\nT is turn, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 12T - 204 => 12T >= 204 => T >= 204/12 = 17\n\nAnd 12T - 215 <= 0 => 12T <= 215 => T <= 215/12 = 17.916, so T <= 17\n\nT >= 17 and T <= 17?

At T=23, is it safe? Freeway 2 unsafe only at T=29,30, so T=23 is safe.\n\nT=24: y=3, freeway 3. Similarly, unsafe only at T=29,30, so safe.\n\nT=25: y=4, freeway 4, same, safe.\n\nT=26: y=5, freeway 5, same, safe.\n\nT=27: y=6, freeway 6. Now freeway 6 unsafe at T=23, but T=27 is different.\n\nAt T=27, for freeway 6, span: from earlier, L6(T) =36T-839, H6=36T-804\n\nT=27: L=36*27-839=972-839=133, H=972-804=168, [133,168], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nT=28: y=7, freeway 7. At T=28, freeway 7: L7(T)=48(T-22)-47, H7=48(T-22)\n\nT=28: T-22=6, L=48*6 -47=288-47=241, H=288, [241,288], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 was unsafe at T=22, but T=28 is fine.\n\nT=29: y=8, freeway 8. Similarly, T=29: T-22=7, L=48*7 -47=336-47=289, H=336, [289,336], safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=22, but T=29 ok.\n\nThen T=30: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nIn this path, at T=29, y=8, which is freeway 8, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=29 and T=30.\n\nIn this path, at T=29, I am on y=8, not on y=2,3,4,5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at T=30, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this sequence, all positions are safe, and I reach y=9 at T=30.\n\nT=30 is turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the turn numbering.\n\nStart at turn t1=22, position y_{t1} = y_{22} =1\n\nAfter H turns, I have actions from t=22 to t=22+H-1, and y at turn t=22+H-1 is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: t from 0 to H-1 relative to t1, but in terms of absolute turn.\n\nSet t=0 at t1, so turn t1+0, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + (H-1)\n\nAt turn t1 + (H-1), y =9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt turn 22 (t1+0), y=1\n\nTurn 23 (t1+1), y=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 30 (t1+8), y=9? t1=22, t1+8=30, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 22 to 29, I take 8 actions: a_{22} to a_{29}, and at turn 30, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9, at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd the last action is at turn T-1, which sets y_T.\n\nThe sequence of actions until I first reach y=9.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nStart turn 22, y=1.\n\nAfter action a_{22}, y_{23} set.\n\nIf I do U at each step:\n\na_{22} = U, y_{23} =2\n\na_{23} = U, y_{24} =3\n\n...\n\na_{29} = U, y_{30} =9\n\nSo at turn 30, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=22 to t=29, that's 8 actions.\n\nH=8 turns? The minimal H.\n\nIn this case, all positions during the path are safe, as I checked.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nAt T=27, y=6, freeway 6, we said safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 was unsafe only at T=23, which is not this time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=29, y=8, freeway 8, safe, not unsafe time.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=29,30, but I am not on them, so fine.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=8 at T=29, which is safe.\n\ny=8 at T=29, freeway 8, which we calculated safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=30, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, but I start at y=1 at T=22, safe.\n\nT=23, y=2, freeway 2, at T=23, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=29,30, so at T=23, should be safe.\n\nConfirm: freeway 2, L2(T) =6T -185\n\nH2(T)=6T-174\n\nT=23: L=6*23 -185=138-185= -47? 138-185= -47, yes.\n\nH=138-174= -36? 6*23=138, H2=6T-174=138-174= -36\n\nSo span [-47, -36], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other points seem safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 at T=23 is unsafe, but in this path, at T=23, I am on y=2, not y=6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can just go up directly in 8 moves, reaching y=9 at turn 30.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nSo actions: at turn 22: U\n\n23: U\n\n24: U\n\n25: U\n\n26: U\n\n27: U\n\n28: U\n\n29: U\n\nThen at turn 30, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nSo for H=8, actions at t1+0 to t1+7.\n\nt1=22, so actions at 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I would be on a row at unsafe time.\n\nSpecifically, at T=29, I am on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=29, as above, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 unsafe at T=29, but I am not on them.\n\nSimilarly, at T=30, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nBut T=30, y=9, not a freeway.\n\nIn the action sequence, the last action is at turn 29, which sets y_{30}=9.\n\nAnd I need to be at (0,9), which I am.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster? From y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 up moves, so 8 actions, can't be faster.\n\nUnless I start lower, but I start at y=1, so 8 moves.\n\ny=1 to y=9, difference 8, each up increases by 1, so yes, minimum 8 actions.\n\nAnd in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 6 at T=23, but I wasn't there.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I start from lower, but I start at y=1, not lower.\n\nOr if I go down first, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=0 at some point, then I need to come back, so more than 8 moves.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 at T=23.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=23, unsafe, as we calculated.\n\nBut in the path, I am at y=6 at T=27, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut what about freeway 7 and 8 at T=22? But at T=22, I am on y=1, not y=7 or 8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThe car state has multiple freeways with same cars, but that shouldn't affect, since we check per row.\n\nIn this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo actions: for turn 22: U\n\n23: U\n\n24: U\n\n25: U\n\n26: U\n\n27: U\n\n28: U\n\n29: U\n\nAnd I reach at turn 30.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is turn 22: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} turn 23: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7} turn 29: U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +8 =30, y=9.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn when I reach.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t1), at turn t1+1, y=2 if U.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k, y=1+k if all U.\n\nSet y=9, so 1+k=9, k=8, so after 8 actions, at turn t1+8=30, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so H actions, reaching at turn t1+H.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, H=8, actions at t1 to t1+7, i.e., 22 to 29.\n\nThen at turn 30, position (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but is there any collision at T=29 or something.\n\nAt T=29, in this path, I am on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=29, as calculated, span [289,336] or something, 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at T=29, meaning if I were on y=2,3,4,5 at T=29, it would be collision.\n\nBut I am on y=8, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, at T=30, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nBut T=30, freeway 2,3,4,5 are also unsafe, but again, not on them.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can be faster, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thing: at the start, turn 22, y=1, safe.\n\nBut let me see freeway 7 and 8 at T=22: unsafe, but I am not on them.\n\nNow, suppose I try to go faster, but I can't, since I need 8 moves.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier if I was at higher y, but I start at y=1.\n\nOr if I use down, but that would slow down.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=0 at turn 23, then I need 9 moves to y=9, worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 at T=23 is unsafe, but I avoid it by being there later.\n\nIn this path, I am at y=6 at T=27, safe.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to avoid T=23 for other rows?\n\nFor example, if I wanted to be on y=6 at T=23, I can't, but I don't.\n\nIn this case, all U works.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=8.\n\nBut let me make sure about freeway 1 at start.\n\nAt turn 22, y=1, freeway 1: span [49,60] at T=22, 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can skip some rows or something, but I have to go through each, but since I move one step, I visit each row.\n\nUnless I stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have h=0 at t1=22, so at T=22, span includes 0, so unsafe.\n\nBut since player not on, ok.\n\nNow, for the sequence, all U.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nThen at turn 30, y=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H=8.\n\nThe sequence has 8 actions.\n\nNow, but the player position: start at (0,1) turn 22.\n\nAfter a_{22}=U, at turn 23, (0,2)\n\na_{23}=U, turn 24, (0,3)\n\n...\n\na_{29}=U, turn 30, (0,9)\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut I recall that at turn T, when I move, I am not on the new row until next turn.\n\nFor example, when I take action at turn t to go up, at turn t I am still on current y, and I move to y+1 at turn t+1.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t, I am on y_t, and check collision for that row at time t.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 22: y=1, on freeway 1, time 22, safe.\n\nTurn 23: y=2, on freeway 2, time 23, safe as calculated.\n\nTurn 24: y=3, freeway 3, time 24, safe.\n\nTurn 25: y=4, freeway 4, time 25, safe.\n\nTurn 26: y=5, freeway 5, time 26, safe.\n\nTurn 27: y=6, freeway 6, time 27, safe (span [133,168] not include 0).\n\nTurn 28: y=7, freeway 7, time 28, safe (span [241,288]).\n\nTurn 29: y=8, freeway 8, time 29, safe (span [289,336]).\n\nTurn 30: y=9, not freeway, no collision.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but freeway 6 at time 23 is unsafe, but I am not on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with all up actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n\n}\n\nSince t1=22, but we use relative.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 29, y=8, and freeway 8 safe, but freeway 2,3,4,5 unsafe, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can be on y=9 earlier, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=0 is safe, and if I go down to y=0 at some point to avoid a car, but in this case, no need, and it would cost extra moves.\n\nFor example, suppose at some turn I need to be on a row that is unsafe, but in this path, all rows I am on are safe at that time.\n\nFor instance, freeway 6 is unsafe only at T=23, but I am on it at T=27, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nFreeways 2-5 unsafe at T=29,30, but at T=29 I am on y=8, which is safe, and at T=30 on y=9.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, this should be fine.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 3,4,5 are the same as 2, but that doesn't change anything.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be for any t1, but since the cars depend on time relative to t1, it should be fine.\n\nIn the sequence, all U.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem with freeway 7 or 8.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in less than 8 if I start by staying or something, but staying at y=1 doesn't help, since I need to move up.\n\nFor example, if I stay at turn 22, then y still 1 at turn 23, then I need to go up from there, but I reach later.\n\nSimilarly, worse.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for 8 turns.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 22.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), at least 8 upward moves are required since each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and the player cannot jump multiple rows in one turn.\n- The car positions and movements were analyzed to determine safe times for each freeway row:\n  - Freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\)): Safe for all \\(T \\geq 22\\).\n  - Freeway 2 (\\(y = 2\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 29, 30\\); safe otherwise for relevant \\(T\\).\n  - Freeway 3 (\\(y = 3\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 29, 30\\); safe otherwise (identical to freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 4 (\\(y = 4\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 29, 30\\); safe otherwise (identical to freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 5 (\\(y = 5\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 29, 30\\); safe otherwise (identical to freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 6 (\\(y = 6\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 23\\); safe otherwise.\n  - Freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 22\\); safe otherwise.\n  - Freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)): Unsafe at \\(T = 22\\); safe otherwise (identical to freeway 7).\n\nA direct upward path is feasible and minimizes \\(H\\):\n- At turn 22, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1), which is safe at \\(T = 22\\).\n- Moving up each turn:\n  - Turn 23: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), safe at \\(T = 23\\).\n  - Turn 24: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3), safe at \\(T = 24\\).\n  - Turn 25: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4), safe at \\(T = 25\\).\n  - Turn 26: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5), safe at \\(T = 26\\).\n  - Turn 27: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), safe at \\(T = 27\\) (not \\(T = 23\\)).\n  - Turn 28: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7), safe at \\(T = 28\\) (not \\(T = 22\\)).\n  - Turn 29: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8), safe at \\(T = 29\\) (not \\(T = 22\\)).\n- At turn 30, \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nThis path requires 8 actions (turns 22 to 29) and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30. No shorter path is possible, as 8 moves are necessary to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9. Detours (e.g., moving down to \\(y = 0\\)) would increase \\(H\\) and are not beneficial.\n\n### Minimal Sequence\n- \\(H = 8\\) turns.\n- Actions: All \"U\" (up) for each turn from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 7\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 6: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 24, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe movement options are U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), or S (stay: y unchanged). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on row y_T during turn T. So when we are at row y at turn T, we check the car on row y at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1 (24). For future turns, we can compute the car positions using their speeds and directions.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) at speed s per turn.\n- Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) at speed s per turn.\n\nBut note: the directions given are either \"right\" or \"left\". In the problem, the update for left-moving is: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\nFor right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]? But wait, the input format is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12). \nSince it's right-moving, the car moves to the right. The initial head is at -36 and tail at -47? That seems backwards because typically the head is the front. But note the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> but the input is (head, tail). So we must interpret: \n  For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So the initial span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But the input is given as (head, tail) = (-36, -47). \n\nThe update rule says for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] \nBut if τ is the tail and h is the head, then that makes sense: the entire segment moves right by s*(T-t1).\n\nSo for freeway 1 (right-moving): \n  head at t1: -36, tail at t1: -47.\n  Then at time T, the head will be at: -36 + 12*(T-24)\n  and the tail will be at: -47 + 12*(T-24)\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car (if there were any) we would subtract.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, k) for k in {1,...,8} and the car on freeway k at turn T has a span that includes 0. That is, the car's tail <= 0 <= head? But note: for a right-moving car, the span is [tail, head] (since tail is left and head is right). For left-moving, the update rule gives [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and since head is the front (which for left-moving would be the leftmost? or rightmost?) \n\nActually, for left-moving, the head is the front (the leftmost) and the tail is the rear (the rightmost). The update rule for left-moving: \n  Initially: [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note that h is the head (leftmost) and τ is the tail (rightmost). So the span is [h, τ] meaning from h to τ (with h < τ). But if the car is moving left, then the entire segment moves left. \n\nSo regardless of direction, we can represent the car at time T as an interval [L(T), R(T)] where:\n  For right-moving: L(T) = tail + s*(T-t1), R(T) = head + s*(T-t1)\n  For left-moving: L(T) = head - s*(T-t1), R(T) = tail - s*(T=t1)   ??? \n\nWait, the update rule for left-moving: \n  Initially: [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: the initial representation in the input is (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, the head is the front? But the update rule says the initial span is [h, τ]. So if we are given (head, tail) = (h, τ) for left-moving, then the initial span is [h, τ]. After moving left by s*(T-t1), it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo the condition for collision at freeway k at turn T is that the player is at (0, k) and 0 is in the interval [L(T), R(T)] for the car on that freeway.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"only if 0 ∈ Span(T)\". And the span is the set of x-coordinates occupied by the car. So if the car is from L to R (with L<=R), then we require L<=0<=R.\n\nNow, we are at turn 24, at y=3. We need to get to y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we must go up at least 6 times. The minimal H would be 6 if we can go straight up without being hit by any car on rows 4,5,6,7,8 at the respective turns.\n\nBut we must also avoid rows that have cars that might hit us at the moment we are on that row.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving from y=3 at turn 24 to y=9. We can also move down or stay to avoid cars, but that would increase H.\n\nGoal: minimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but if we cannot go up on a turn because the next row (if we go up) would be dangerous at that turn? Actually, note:\n\n- At turn 24, we are at row 3. We choose an action for turn 24 that will determine our row at turn 25: \n  - If we choose U: then at turn 25 we will be at row 4.\n  - If we choose D: then at turn 25 we will be at row 2 (but note we cannot go below 0, but 3-1=2>=0, so okay).\n  - If we choose S: then at turn 25 we are still at row 3.\n\nBut we are concerned about collisions at the turn we are on. At turn 24, we are at row 3. We must check row 3 at turn 24: is there a car on row 3? The freeways are from 1 to 8. Row 3 is freeway 3? The table lists freeways 1 to 8. But note: the freeway index k corresponds to the row? So at row 3, we have freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 24, for freeway 3: \n  Cars: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n  So it's right-moving. \n  Head at turn24: -30, tail: -41.\n  So the span at turn24: [tail, head] = [-41, -30] (since right-moving: tail is left, head is right). \n  Does 0 lie in [-41, -30]? No, because -30 < 0 is false? Actually, -30 is negative, so 0 is greater than -30 -> not in the interval. So we are safe at turn24 on row3.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves. We want to go to row 9. We can try to go up every turn. But we must check for each turn and each row we are on.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn. We start at turn24 at row3.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (row k) and for each future turn T, the position of the car on that row. But note: the car state is given for each freeway at turn24. So we can compute for any T>=24.\n\nWe are going to try to move up as much as possible, but if at a turn T we are going to be on a row k that has a car that covers 0 at turn T, then we must avoid being on row k at turn T. We can avoid by:\n  - Staying on the same row (if that row is safe) and then going up later? \n  - Or moving down? But moving down would take us away from the goal.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we prefer to go up. But if we cannot go up because the next row (at the next turn) would be dangerous at that next turn, then we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid.\n\nBut note: if at turn T we are at row k and we choose to go up, then at turn T we are still on row k (so we are safe there) and then at turn T+1 we are on row k+1. So we only need to check row k at turn T (which we are on) and then if we move up, we must check row k+1 at turn T+1? Actually, no: at turn T, we are on row k. The action we take at turn T (U, D, S) only affects the row at turn T+1. At turn T, we are on row k, and we check row k at turn T for collision. Then, if we choose U, then at turn T+1 we are on row k+1, and then we check row k+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 24: at row 3. Check row3 at turn24: safe (as above).\n\nNow, for turn24, we choose an action that will determine row25.\n\nWe want to go to row9. The minimal steps is 6 (if we go up 6 times). So let's check if we can go up 6 times consecutively.\n\nWe are going to simulate:\n\nTurn24: we are at row3. We choose U -> then at turn25 we will be at row4.\n\nAt turn25, we are at row4. Check row4 at turn25: \n  Freeway4: (-30, -41, right, 6) at turn24.\n  At turn25 (T=25, T-t1=1), \n      head = -30 + 6*1 = -24\n      tail = -41 + 6*1 = -35\n      span = [-35, -24] -> does not contain 0? (since -24 < 0) -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U at turn25 -> row5 at turn26.\n\nAt turn26: row5. Check freeway5 at turn26: same car type? \n  Freeway5: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n  At turn26: T-t1=2, head = -30+12 = -18, tail=-41+12=-29 -> span [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nThen U: turn26 to row6 at turn27.\n\nAt turn27: row6. Freeway6: (60, 25, right, 36) -> note: head=60, tail=25? But for right-moving, the span should be [tail, head] = [25,60] at turn24? \n  But wait: the input says (head, tail) = (60,25). So at turn24: the car is from 25 to 60? \n  Then at turn27 (T=27, T-t1=3): \n      head = 60 + 36*3 = 60 + 108 = 168\n      tail = 25 + 36*3 = 25+108=133\n      span [133,168] -> does not contain 0 -> safe.\n\nThen U: turn27 to row7 at turn28.\n\nAt turn28: row7. Freeway7: (96,49,right,48)\n  At turn24: span [49,96]? \n  At turn28 (T=28, T-t1=4): \n      head = 96 + 48*4 = 96+192=288\n      tail = 49 + 48*4 = 49+192=241\n      span [241,288] -> safe.\n\nThen U: turn28 to row8 at turn29.\n\nAt turn29: row8. Freeway8: (96,49,right,48) -> same as above? \n  At turn29 (T=29, T-t1=5): \n      head = 96 + 48*5 = 96+240=336\n      tail = 49 + 48*5 = 49+240=289\n      span [289,336] -> safe.\n\nThen U: turn29 to row9 at turn30.\n\nAt turn30: we are at row9. But note: the goal is (0,9) and there is no freeway 9 (freeways only 1-8). So we don't check any car? We are safe.\n\nSo if we go U at every turn from turn24 to turn29 (6 turns: 24,25,26,27,28,29) then we reach row9 at turn30.\n\nBut wait: we started at turn24 at row3. After one U (turn24) we are at row4 at turn25. Then after 5 more U's: \n  turn25: row5\n  turn26: row6\n  turn27: row7\n  turn28: row8\n  turn29: row9 -> then we are done at turn29? \n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nAt turn24: start at row3.\nAfter turn24: we do U -> row4 at turn25.\nAfter turn25: U -> row5 at turn26.\nAfter turn26: U -> row6 at turn27.\nAfter turn27: U -> row7 at turn28.\nAfter turn28: U -> row8 at turn29.\nAfter turn29: U -> row9 at turn30.\n\nSo we need 6 actions: turns 24 to 29, and we arrive at row9 at turn30. But the problem says: the sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo H = number of turns = 6? Then the actions are for t=0 to H-1: \n  t=0: turn24\n  t=1: turn25\n  ...\n  t=5: turn29\n\nAnd at turn29 (the last action) we do U, and then at turn30 we are at row9. But the position at the end of the last action (turn29) is row8? Then we haven't reached row9 at the last action. \n\nWait, the update: \n  After an action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. \n  So we are at row3 at turn24 (before any action at turn24). Then we take action at turn24: U -> then at turn24+1 (turn25) we are at row4.\n\nWe need to be at row9 at the moment after the last action? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after these H actions, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the last action is taken at turn t_1 + H - 1, and then the next state (at turn t_1+H) is the result. So we want at turn t_1+H the player to be at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we have:\n  After H actions: we are at turn t_1 + H, and we require y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\nHow many actions? We start at turn t_1 (24) and we do H actions: at turns 24, 25, ..., 24+H-1. Then at turn 24+H, we are at the new state.\n\nWe start at turn24: y24=3.\nAfter action at turn24: y25 = 3 + (change from action at turn24)\nAfter action at turn25: y26 = y25 + (change from turn25)\n...\nAfter action at turn24+H-1: y_{24+H} = ... \n\nWe want y_{24+H} = 9.\n\nWe need to go from 3 to 9: a net change of +6. Each U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0. So the minimal H is 6 if we use only U.\n\nBut in the simulation above, we did 6 U's and then at turn24+6 = 30, we are at row9. So H=6.\n\nBut we must check at every step the row we are on at each turn.\n\nAt turn24: we are at row3 -> safe (as above).\n\nAfter first action (U at turn24): we are at row4 at turn25 -> safe (as above).\n\nAfter second action (U at turn25): at turn26 we are at row5 -> safe.\n\nAfter third action (U at turn26): at turn27 we are at row6 -> safe.\n\nAfter fourth action (U at turn27): at turn28 we are at row7 -> safe.\n\nAfter fifth action (U at turn28): at turn29 we are at row8 -> safe.\n\nAfter sixth action (U at turn29): at turn30 we are at row9 -> goal, and no car check on row9.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n  Turn24: U\n  Turn25: U\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n\nBut wait, we must check the intermediate rows at the turns we are on. We have checked that at the moment we are on each row (3 at turn24, 4 at turn25, 5 at turn26, 6 at turn27, 7 at turn28, 8 at turn29) the car on that row does not cover 0.\n\nHowever, note that at turn24 we are already at row3 and we don't take an action that changes our row until the next turn. But we are safe at row3 at turn24.\n\nBut what about the other rows? We don't care about rows we are not on.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row8 at turn29: \n  Freeway8: (96,49,right,48) at turn24.\n  At turn29: T-t1=5, so \n      head = 96 + 48*5 = 96+240=336\n      tail = 49 + 48*5 = 49+240=289\n      So the span is [289,336] -> 0 is not in there.\n\nSimilarly, row7 at turn28: \n  Freeway7: same car? Actually, freeway7 and freeway8 have the same car? The table says:\n  7 | (96,49,right,48)\n  8 | (96,49,right,48)\n\nSo both freeway7 and freeway8 have the same car? That's possible. Then at turn28 for freeway7: \n  head=96+48*4=96+192=288\n  tail=49+192=241 -> [241,288] -> safe.\n\nBut what about row6 at turn27? \n  Freeway6: (60,25,right,36) at turn24.\n  At turn27: T-t1=3 -> \n      head=60+36*3=60+108=168\n      tail=25+36*3=25+108=133 -> [133,168] -> safe.\n\nRow5 at turn26: freeway5: (-30,-41,right,6) -> \n  At turn26: T-t1=2 -> \n      head=-30+12=-18\n      tail=-41+12=-29 -> [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nRow4 at turn25: freeway4: same as row5? freeway4: (-30,-41,right,6) -> \n  At turn25: T-t1=1 -> \n      head=-30+6=-24\n      tail=-41+6=-35 -> [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nSo indeed, we can go straight up in 6 moves.\n\nBut is there a problem at row8 at turn29? We are at row8 at turn29: we must check freeway8 at turn29. We did: [289,336] -> safe.\n\nAnd then after the last U at turn29, we are at row9 at turn30, which is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, and the actions are all U.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=6.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We start at row3 and need to get to row9: we need to cover 6 rows. Each move we can only move one row up at most. So minimal H is 6. Therefore, this is optimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we can skip some rows by moving faster? No, because we can only move one row per turn.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nHere, t_1=24, H=6, so t from 0 to 5: \n  t=0: turn24\n  t=1: turn25\n  ...\n  t=5: turn29\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have H=6.\n\nHowever, let me check if there is any car that might hit us at these turns? \n\nI see that freeway1,2,3,4,5 all have cars that are at negative positions and moving right. They will eventually cover 0? \n\nFor example, freeway1: at turn24: [-47,-36] -> moving right at speed 12. When will it cover 0?\n  We need: tail + 12*(T-24) <= 0 <= head + 12*(T-24)\n  => -47 + 12*(T-24) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-24)\n\n  Solve: \n    12*(T-24) >= 36   => T-24 >= 3 => T>=27\n    and \n    12*(T-24) <= 47   => T-24 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 => T<=27.916 -> so T=27,28?\n\n  At T=27: \n      tail = -47 + 12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n      head = -36+36 = 0 -> so the span is [-11,0]. 0 is included? Yes, the head is at 0.\n\n  So at turn27, the car on freeway1 covers 0.\n\nBut at turn27, we are at row6 (if we follow the above plan). We are not on freeway1 (row1) at turn27. So we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: (-30,-41,right,6) -> same as freeway3,4,5? \n  They have the same parameters: (-30,-41,right,6). \n  When will they cover 0?\n      tail: -41 + 6*(T-24) <= 0  => 6*(T-24) <= 41 => T-24 <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833 -> T<=30.833\n      head: -30+6*(T-24) >=0 => 6*(T-24)>=30 => T-24>=5 -> T>=29.\n\n  At T=29: \n      tail = -41 + 6*5 = -41+30 = -11\n      head = -30+30 = 0 -> so at T=29, the car covers 0.\n\nBut at turn29, we are at row8? Then we are not on freeway2 (row2) at turn29. So safe.\n\nBut note: if we had stayed on row2 at turn29, we would have been hit. But we are not.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we had to go through row1 at some point? We didn't. We started at row3 and went to row4,5,...,9. We never were on row1 or row2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. We are only concerned with the freeway we are on at the turn we are on.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway3 at turn27? \n  Freeway3: same as freeway2: (-30,-41,right,6)\n  At turn27: T-t1=3 -> \n      head = -30+6*3 = -30+18 = -12\n      tail = -41+18 = -23 -> span [-23,-12] -> does not contain 0.\n\nBut we were at row6 at turn27, not row3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is 6 U's.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway6? We checked at turn27: it was at [133,168] -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway6 has a car that is moving right at speed 36. At turn24, it is at [25,60]. When will it cover 0?\n  tail: 25+36*(T-24) <=0? -> 25+36*(T-24) <=0 -> 36*(T-24)<=-25 -> impossible because T>=24. So it will never cover 0? Actually, it starts at 25 (which is positive) and moves right, so it only goes to higher positive numbers. So it never covers 0. Similarly, freeway7 and 8: start at 49 and 96 and move right -> never cover 0.\n\nTherefore, the only freeways that will eventually cover 0 are freeways 1,2,3,4,5? \n  But freeway1: as above, at turn27 it covers 0.\n  freeway2: at turn29? \n      Actually, freeway2,3,4,5: all the same: (-30,-41,right,6). They all will cover 0 at turn29? \n      But note: we have freeway2,3,4,5 each with the same car? That seems odd, but the table says so.\n\nBut we are not on these freeways at the critical times.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence. We have H=6, and the sequence above.\n\nBut the answer format only shows the actions, not H. But the problem says \"determine H and the sequence\", but the boxed part only shows the sequence. The instruction says: \n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo we don't need to write H in the box. But we have determined H=6.\n\nSo we write the sequence for turns 24 to 29.\n\nBut wait: the last turn we act is turn29? And then at turn30 we arrive at row9. So the sequence has 6 actions: for turns24,25,26,27,28,29.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 24 is 6. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 24, move up (U) to reach row 4 at turn 25. The car on freeway 3 (row 3) at turn 24 has a span \\([-41, -30]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 25, move up (U) to reach row 5 at turn 26. The car on freeway 4 (row 4) at turn 25 has a span \\([-35, -24]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 26, move up (U) to reach row 6 at turn 27. The car on freeway 5 (row 5) at turn 26 has a span \\([-29, -18]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 27, move up (U) to reach row 7 at turn 28. The car on freeway 6 (row 6) at turn 27 has a span \\([133, 168]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 28, move up (U) to reach row 8 at turn 29. The car on freeway 7 (row 7) at turn 28 has a span \\([241, 288]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 29, move up (U) to reach row 9 at turn 30. The car on freeway 8 (row 8) at turn 29 has a span \\([289, 336]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n\nAfter these actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 30. This sequence is optimal as it requires exactly 6 upward moves to cover the vertical distance from row 3 to row 9, and no collisions occur on any intermediate row at the respective turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 25, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at the same time, for a car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: when moving from freeway y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on freeway y. Then at turn T+1, the player will be on freeway y'. Therefore, when we are at turn T, we are only at risk of collision from the freeway we are currently on (y) and not the one we are moving to (y').\n\nWe are starting at (0,4) at turn 25. We need to get to (0,9). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The y-coordinate is updated accordingly, and must stay in [0,9]. Since we start at 4 and need to get to 9, we must move up at least 5 times. We cannot move down because that would take us away from the goal. So the minimal number of moves is 5 if we can go straight up without being blocked.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Note that the freeways are the rows y=1, y=2, ... y=8. The player is currently at y=4. We must avoid being on a freeway row (from 1 to 8) when a car on that row has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=25. For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction: \n- For right-moving cars: the head is the front (so at turn t1, the car spans from tail to head, and the head is the rightmost point). \n- For left-moving cars: the head is the front (so the car spans from head to tail? Actually, the update rule for left-moving is: \n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  and for right-moving:\n    Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation: in the table, for all cars, the direction is \"right\", so we are only dealing with right-moving cars.\n\nSo for a right-moving car at turn T (relative to turn t1=25, so T = 25 + dt, where dt>=0), the span becomes:\n    [τ + s*(T-25), h + s*(T-25)]\n\nWe are told that at turn T, collision occurs on freeway k if the player is on freeway k and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway. Note that each freeway has only one car? The table lists one car per freeway.\n\nSo for freeway k, we have one car. We must check for each freeway k and for each turn T whether the car on k has a span that includes 0.\n\nBut note: the player is only on one freeway per turn. So we need to simulate the player's path and check for each turn T (from t1=25 onward) and the freeway y_T that the player is on (if y_T is between 1 and 8) whether the car on that freeway at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nLet me denote:\n  For a right-moving car on freeway k, with initial (at t1=25) head = h, tail = τ, speed = s:\n      At turn T (>=25), the head position = h + s*(T-25)\n      The tail position = τ + s*(T-25)\n\nBut note: the representation of the car in the table for right-moving: \n    They give (head, tail, direction, speed) at t1=25.\n\nHowever, for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span at T is [τ + s*(T-25), h + s*(T-25)].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in the interval [τ + s*(T-25), h + s*(T-25)]. \n\nThis is equivalent to:\n    τ + s*(T-25) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-25)\n\nBut note: the car is moving to the right. Also, since the car is long, τ is less than h? Actually, for a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head is the right end, so τ < h.\n\nSo the condition for collision on freeway k at turn T is:\n    τ + s*(T-25) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-25)\n\nWe can rearrange for T:\n    (0 - h) / s <= T - 25 <= (0 - τ) / s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving right, h and τ are negative at t1=25? Because the car is to the left of 0. But as T increases, the car moves right.\n\nLet me look at the given cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> τ = -35, h = -24, s=12\nFreeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\nFreeway 3: same as 2\nFreeway 4: same as 2\nFreeway 5: same as 2\nFreeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> τ=-95, h=-48, s=48\nFreeway 8: same as 7\n\nWe are at turn 25. We are starting at y=4. We need to go to y=9. So we will pass through freeways 5,6,7,8? Actually, we start at 4, then we can go to 5, then 6, then 7, then 8, then 9. But note: the goal is at (0,9), and 9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So when we are at 9, we are safe from collisions.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions on freeways 5,6,7,8 when we are on them.\n\nWe can also stay on a row or even move down? But moving down would not help because we need to go up. However, sometimes we might have to wait to avoid a car. But note: we can only move one step per turn. So if we are on a freeway that is blocked at the current turn, we cannot stay there? Because if we stay, we are still on that freeway and might be hit again? Or we can move away.\n\nBut note: we can move up, down, or stay. So if we are on a freeway that is blocked at turn T, we can move to an adjacent freeway (if possible) to avoid the collision. However, we cannot move to a freeway that is blocked at turn T? But note: at turn T, when we are on freeway y, we are at risk only from the car on y. Then at the same turn T, we take an action that will move us to y' at turn T+1. So if we move, we leave the freeway y at turn T, and then at turn T+1 we are on freeway y'. Therefore, if we are on a freeway that is blocked at turn T, we must not be there. So we must either leave that freeway by moving up or down (if possible) or we must not be on that freeway at turn T.\n\nTherefore, our plan: we need to simulate the player's movement from y=4 at turn 25 to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding being on a freeway k at a turn T when the car on k has a span that includes 0 at T.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from T=25) the condition: is the car on k blocking the position 0 at T?\n\nBut note: the player can only be on one freeway per turn, so we only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible, but we might have to wait (by staying on a non-freeway row or by moving to an adjacent row that is safe) to avoid a collision.\n\nNon-freeway rows: y=0 and y=9. These are safe because there are no cars. So we can stay at y=0 or y=9 without any problem.\n\nWe start at y=4 (which is freeway 4). We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1-8 when they are blocked at the current turn.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k and for T from 25 onward, the time window when the car is blocking 0.\n\nFor a freeway k, we have:\n    Let dt = T - 25.\n    Condition: τ + s*dt <= 0 <= h + s*dt\n\nBut note: the car is moving to the right, so as dt increases, the car moves to the right. Since τ and h are negative at t1=25, the car is to the left of 0. It will eventually cover 0 and then move past.\n\nWe can solve for dt:\n\n    τ + s*dt <= 0   =>   dt >= ceil(-τ / s)   ??? Actually, we have:\n\n    Lower bound: τ + s*dt <= 0  =>  dt >= ceil( (-τ) / s )? But note: we require 0 to be >= τ+s*dt, so that is always true until the car passes 0? Actually, the condition is:\n\n    The car covers 0 when:\n        τ + s*dt <= 0   and   0 <= h + s*dt\n\n    Rearranged:\n        dt >= (-τ) / s   and   dt >= (-h) / s? Actually:\n\n        τ + s*dt <= 0  =>  dt >= (-τ)/s   (since s>0)\n        0 <= h + s*dt  =>  dt >= (-h)/s   (but note: h is negative, so -h is positive)\n\n    Actually, the condition is two inequalities:\n\n        dt >= (-τ)/s   and   dt <= (-h)/s   ??? \n\n    Let me check:\n\n        We require: τ + s*dt <= 0  -> dt >= (-τ)/s   (because τ is negative, so -τ is positive)\n        and 0 <= h + s*dt  -> h + s*dt >= 0  -> s*dt >= -h  -> dt >= (-h)/s   (but note: h is negative, so -h is positive)\n\n    Wait, that can't be: the two conditions are both lower bounds? Actually, the condition for 0 to be in [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] is:\n\n        τ + s*dt <= 0 <= h + s*dt\n\n    This is equivalent to:\n        dt >= (-τ)/s   and   dt <= (-h)/s   ??? \n\n    Let me plug in numbers for freeway 1:\n\n        τ = -35, h = -24, s=12.\n\n        Condition: -35 + 12*dt <= 0 <= -24 + 12*dt\n\n        Rearranged:\n            -35 + 12*dt <= 0  => 12*dt <= 35  => dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n            and 0 <= -24 + 12*dt => 24 <= 12*dt => dt >= 2.\n\n        So dt must be an integer between 2 and 2.9167 -> so only dt=2? But wait, at dt=2:\n            τ + s*dt = -35 + 24 = -11, h+s*dt = -24+24=0 -> then 0 is included? [ -11, 0] includes 0? Yes.\n\n        At dt=3: \n            τ+s*dt = -35+36=1, h+s*dt=-24+36=12 -> then [1,12] does not include 0? So condition fails.\n\n        So the condition is: 2 <= dt < 3? But dt is integer, so only dt=2.\n\n        Therefore, the freeway 1 is blocked only at turn T=25+2=27.\n\n    Similarly, for freeway 2: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6.\n\n        Condition: -35+6*dt <= 0 <= -24+6*dt\n        => 6*dt >= 35? -> dt>= ceil(35/6)=ceil(5.833)=6? and 6*dt>=24 -> dt>=4? \n        Actually:\n            -35+6*dt <=0 -> 6*dt<=35? No, that's not right.\n\n        Let me write:\n            -35 + 6*dt <= 0  => 6*dt <= 35 => dt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n            and 0 <= -24+6*dt => 6*dt>=24 => dt>=4.\n\n        So dt must be an integer in [4,5.833] -> dt=4,5.\n\n        Therefore, at T=25+4=29 and T=25+5=30, freeway 2 is blocked.\n\n    Similarly, we can compute for every freeway.\n\nBut note: the player will be moving through the freeways. We are starting at freeway 4 at turn 25.\n\nWe need to get to freeway 5,6,7,8 and then to 9.\n\nWe can also move down? But that would be away from the goal. So we try to go up unless blocked.\n\nLet me compute the blocking times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: s=12, τ=-35, h=-24\n    Blocked when: dt >= 24/12 = 2 and dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.9167 -> dt=2 -> T=27.\n\nFreeway 2: s=6, τ=-35, h=-24\n    Blocked when: dt>=24/6=4 and dt<=35/6≈5.833 -> dt=4,5 -> T=29,30.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2 -> T=29,30.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 -> T=29,30.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 2 -> T=29,30.\n\nFreeway 6: s=36, τ=-83, h=-48\n    Condition: -83+36*dt <=0 and 0<=-48+36*dt\n        => 36*dt>=48 -> dt>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 -> so dt>=2? (since integer) and 36*dt<=83 -> dt<=83/36≈2.305 -> so dt=2? \n        Check: dt=2: \n            τ+s*dt = -83+72=-11, h+s*dt=-48+72=24 -> [-11,24] includes 0 -> yes.\n        dt=1: \n            τ+s*dt=-83+36=-47, h+s*dt=-48+36=-12 -> [-47,-12] doesn't include 0 -> no.\n        dt=3: \n            τ+s*dt=-83+108=25, h+s*dt=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] doesn't include 0 -> no.\n        So only dt=2 -> T=27.\n\nFreeway 7: s=48, τ=-95, h=-48\n    Condition: -95+48*dt<=0 and 0<=-48+48*dt\n        => 48*dt>=48 -> dt>=1 and 48*dt<=95 -> dt<=95/48≈1.979 -> so dt=1? \n        Check dt=1: \n            τ+s*dt=-95+48=-47, h+s*dt=-48+48=0 -> [-47,0] includes 0 -> yes.\n        dt=2: \n            τ+s*dt=-95+96=1, h+s*dt=-48+96=48 -> [1,48] doesn't include 0 -> no.\n        So only dt=1 -> T=26.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7 -> blocked at T=26.\n\nSummary of blocked freeways at turns:\n\nTurn 26: freeways 7 and 8 are blocked.\nTurn 27: freeways 1 and 6 are blocked.\nTurns 29 and 30: freeways 2,3,4,5 are blocked.\n\nWe start at turn 25 at y=4 (freeway 4). \n\nWe must avoid:\n- At turn 25: we are on freeway 4. Is freeway 4 blocked at turn 25? \n    For freeway 4: dt=0 -> τ+s*0=-35, h+s*0=-24 -> [-35,-24] does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 25, we are safe.\n\nNow, we can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we prefer to move up. But we have to check the consequences.\n\nLet me try to go straight up:\n\nTurn 25: at y=4 -> safe.\n\nTurn 26: we want to be at y=5? But to get to y=5 at turn 26, we must have taken action U at turn 25. Then at turn 26, we are at y=5.\n\nBut at turn 26, freeway 5 is not blocked? The blocked freeways at turn 26 are 7 and 8. Freeway 5 is blocked at turns 29 and 30. So at turn 26, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nSo we can move to y=5 at turn 26.\n\nTurn 26: we are at y=5. Then we take action U at turn 26 to go to y=6 at turn 27.\n\nTurn 27: we are at y=6. Now, at turn 27, freeway 6 is blocked! (because we found freeway 6 is blocked at T=27). So we cannot be on freeway 6 at turn 27.\n\nTherefore, if we go straight up, we will be on freeway 6 at turn 27 and collide.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway 6 at turn 27.\n\nWhat can we do? At turn 26, we are at y=5. Instead of moving up to y=6 at turn 27, we could:\n\nOption 1: stay at y=5 for turn 26? But then at turn 26 we are at y=5 (safe, because freeway 5 is not blocked at turn 26) and then at turn 27, we are still at y=5? But we have to take an action at turn 26. If we take S, then at turn 27 we are still at y=5. But then at turn 27, freeway 5 is blocked? Yes, because freeway 5 is blocked at T=29 and 30, but not at 27? So at turn 27, freeway 5 is safe. Then at turn 27, we can move to y=6? But turn 27 is blocked for freeway 6, so we cannot go to y=6 at turn 27. We would have to wait at y=5 until after turn 27? But we are at y=5 at turn 27: is that safe? Yes, because freeway 5 is only blocked at 29 and 30. Then at turn 28, we can move to y=6? But we need to check freeway 6 at turn 28: \n    Freeway 6: at T=28, dt=3 -> τ+s*dt=-83+36*3=-83+108=25, h+s*dt=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTurn 25: U -> y=5 at turn 26.\nTurn 26: S -> stay at y=5 at turn 27? Actually, no: if we take S at turn 26, then at turn 27 we are still at y=5. Then at turn 27, we can take U to go to y=6 at turn 28. At turn 28, we are at y=6 and it is safe (as computed above). Then we can continue up.\n\nBut we lost one turn: we were at y=5 at turn 26 and then we stayed at y=5 at turn 27, so we didn't progress. Then we move to y=6 at turn 28.\n\nThen we need to go to y=7,8,9. \n\nBut we have to avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turn 26? They are blocked at turn 26, but we are not on them at turn 26. Then at turn 28, we are at y=6. Then we can move to y=7 at turn 29? But at turn 29, freeway 7 is not blocked? Freeway 7 is only blocked at turn 26. At turn 29: \n    dt = 29-25 = 4\n    Freeway 7: τ+s*dt=-95+48*4=-95+192=97, h+s*dt=-48+192=144 -> [97,144] doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7 -> safe.\n\nBut note: at turn 29, freeways 2,3,4,5 are blocked. But we are going to be at y=7 at turn 29? Then we are safe because freeway 7 is not blocked.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 25: U -> y=5 at turn 26.\nTurn 26: S -> y=5 at turn 27. (safe, because freeway5 not blocked at 27)\nTurn 27: U -> y=6 at turn 28. (freeway6 at turn28: safe as above)\nTurn 28: U -> y=7 at turn 29. (freeway7 at turn29: safe)\nTurn 29: U -> y=8 at turn 30. (freeway8 at turn30: \n        dt=30-25=5 -> freeway8: τ+s*dt=-95+48*5=-95+240=145, h+s*dt=-48+240=192 -> [145,192] doesn't include 0 -> safe)\nTurn 30: U -> y=9 at turn 31.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 31. That took 6 turns (from turn25 to turn30: actions at t25,26,27,28,29,30 -> 6 actions) and then at turn31 we are at y=9.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe started at turn25 at y=4. We need 5 moves up to get to y=9. But we had to wait one turn (at turn26 we stayed at y=5) to avoid the collision at y=6 on turn27. So total moves: 5 moves up and one stay? Actually, we did: U, S, U, U, U, U -> that's 6 actions. But the moves up are 5: we did U at t25 (to5), then at t27:U (to6), t28:U (to7), t29:U (to8), t30:U (to9). So we did 5 U's and one S. So 6 actions.\n\nCan we do it in 5? That would require 5 consecutive U's without any delay. But we saw that if we go straight up:\n\nt25: U -> y=5 at t26 (safe)\nt26: U -> y=6 at t27 -> but at t27, freeway6 is blocked -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we could move down? But that would take us away and then we have to come back, which would take more turns.\n\nOr we could skip freeway6 at turn27 by being on a different row? But we have to be on row6 to move from 5 to 7? No, we can only move one step at a time. So we must go through row6.\n\nBut we can avoid being on row6 at turn27 by being on row6 at a different turn? We are at row5 at turn26. We cannot jump to row7 at turn27. We have to go through row6 at some turn. The only other option is to delay the move to row6 until after turn27.\n\nSo we must avoid row6 at turn27. The next safe time for row6 is turn28. So we have to wait until turn28 to be on row6.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do it in 5 turns. The minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the wait by going down? \n\nSuppose at turn25 we do D? That would be to y=3 at turn26. Then we are at freeway3 at turn26: safe? Freeway3 is blocked only at turns29,30. Then at turn26 we are safe. Then we can go up? But then we have to go up to 4,5,6,7,8,9 -> that would take 6 moves (from y=3 to y=9: 6 moves). And we are at turn25: D -> turn26: y=3; then we do 6 U's: at turn27: y=4, turn28: y=5, turn29: y=6, turn30: y=7, turn31: y=8, turn32: y=9. But now at turn29: we are at freeway3? Actually, at turn29 we are at y=6? \n\nWait, let's track:\n\nt25: start y=4 -> D -> t26: y=3 (freeway3: at t26, freeway3 is safe? because freeway3 is blocked at t29,30 -> safe at t26)\nt26: U -> t27: y=4 (freeway4: safe at t27? freeway4 blocked at t29,30 -> safe)\nt27: U -> t28: y=5 (freeway5: safe at t28? blocked at t29,30 -> safe)\nt28: U -> t29: y=6 (freeway6: at t29, dt=4 -> freeway6: τ=-83+36*4=-83+144=61, h=-48+144=96 -> [61,96] doesn't include0 -> safe)\nt29: U -> t30: y=7 (freeway7: at t30, dt=5 -> τ=-95+48*5=145, h=-48+240=192 -> safe? [145,192] doesn't include0 -> safe)\nt30: U -> t31: y=8 (freeway8: same as 7 -> safe)\nt31: U -> t32: y=9\n\nThat took 7 actions (from t25 to t31: 7 actions) and we are at y=9 at turn32. Worse than the previous 6.\n\nAlternatively, after going down to y=3, we might wait? But that would be even longer.\n\nSo the first plan (with one stay) is better.\n\nBut in the first plan, we were at y=5 at turn26 and then stayed at y=5 at turn27. Then we moved up. Total turns: 6.\n\nBut note: we are at turn25: we take action at turn25 (U) -> then turn26 (S) -> turn27 (U) -> turn28 (U) -> turn29 (U) -> turn30 (U). So we take 6 actions: t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t30. Then at turn31, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if we are safe at every step:\n\nTurn25: action U -> we are at y=4 at turn25? Actually, the action is taken at the beginning of the turn? The update: after taking action at turn t, we move to the next state at turn t+1? Or does the action at turn t update the state for turn t?\n\nLooking at the update: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). We take action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nTherefore, at turn25, we start at (0,4). We take an action at turn25, which determines y_{26}.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn25: we are at y=4. We take an action -> then at turn26, we are at the new y.\n\nTherefore, we are at y=4 at turn25. We must check: at turn25, we are on freeway4 -> is it blocked? We computed: freeway4 is not blocked at turn25 (dt=0) -> safe.\n\nThen we take action U at turn25 -> so at turn26, we are at y=5.\n\nAt turn26: we are at y=5 (freeway5). Check freeway5 at turn26: \n    dt=1 -> for freeway5: τ=-35, s=6 -> τ+s*dt=-35+6=-29, h+s*dt=-24+6=-18 -> [-29,-18] doesn't include0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take action S at turn26 -> so at turn27, we are at y=5 (freeway5). \n    Check freeway5 at turn27: dt=2 -> τ+s*dt=-35+12=-23? Wait, s=6 -> -35+6*2=-35+12=-23, h+s*dt=-24+12=-12 -> [-23,-12] doesn't include0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take action U at turn27 -> at turn28, we are at y=6 (freeway6). \n    Check freeway6 at turn28: dt=3 -> τ=-83+36*3=-83+108=25, h=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] doesn't include0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take action U at turn28 -> at turn29, we are at y=7 (freeway7). \n    Check freeway7 at turn29: dt=4 -> τ=-95+48*4=-95+192=97, h=-48+192=144 -> [97,144] doesn't include0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take action U at turn29 -> at turn30, we are at y=8 (freeway8). \n    Check freeway8 at turn30: dt=5 -> τ=-95+48*5=-95+240=145, h=-48+240=192 -> [145,192] doesn't include0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take action U at turn30 -> at turn31, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo that works.\n\nBut we have to do 6 actions. Is there a way to do 5? We thought not, but let me see if we can avoid the wait by going up at a different timing.\n\nAnother idea: at turn25, we do not move up immediately. Instead, we stay at y=4 for turn26? \n\nTurn25: S -> then at turn26, we are still at y=4 (freeway4). Check freeway4 at turn26: dt=1 -> τ+s*dt=-35+6*1=-29, h+s*dt=-24+6=-18 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn26, we take U -> to y=5 at turn27.\nAt turn27: we are at y=5 (freeway5). Check freeway5 at turn27: as above, safe.\nThen we want to go to y=6 at turn28: \n    at turn28, freeway6: safe (as above).\nThen we can go to y=7 at turn29: safe.\ny=8 at turn30: safe.\ny=9 at turn31.\n\nBut that is still 6 actions: t25: S, t26:U, t27:U, t28:U, t29:U, t30:U -> 6 actions. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go faster by going two steps in a row? But we are limited to one step per turn.\n\nWhat if we go up at turn25 to y=5, then at turn26 we go down to y=4? That seems counterintuitive. Then at turn27 we go up to y=5 again, and then at turn28 to y=6, etc. But that would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut note: we have to check if we can do it without the wait? We must avoid freeway6 at turn27. So we cannot be on freeway6 at turn27. The only way to be on freeway6 is at a turn other than 27. The next available turn for freeway6 is turn28. So we have to schedule to be on freeway6 at turn28. \n\nWe start at turn25 at y=4. We can be at:\n\nturn25: y4\nturn26: y5 (by U at t25)\nturn27: we must avoid y6 -> so we cannot do U at turn26. We can do S (stay at y5) or D (go to y4). If we go to y4 at turn27, then at turn27 we are at y4 (freeway4). Check freeway4 at turn27: safe? as above -> yes. Then at turn27, we take U to y5 at turn28. Then at turn28, we take U to y6 at turn29? But then we are at y6 at turn29: which is safe? \n    freeway6 at turn29: dt=4 -> τ=-83+36*4=-83+144=61, h=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n\nThen we go to y7 at turn30, y8 at turn31, y9 at turn32 -> that's 7 actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first plan is best: U, S, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut in the first plan, we did:\n\nt25: U -> to y5 at t26\nt26: S -> to y5 at t27\nt27: U -> to y6 at t28\nt28: U -> to y7 at t29\nt29: U -> to y8 at t30\nt30: U -> to y9 at t31\n\nSo the actions are: U, S, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut we have to write for each turn:\n\nTurn t1 (which is 25): U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\n\nAnd then at turn31, we are at (0,9). So we took 6 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we get to the next state at turn t1+H, and we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? \n\nWait, no: the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nHow does the indexing work?\n\nWe are at turn t1 (25) at (0,4). Then we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. After taking action at turn t, we update to the next state at turn t+1. Therefore, after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we update to turn t1+H, and we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so the actions are at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after these actions is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, there might be a confusion in indexing.\n\nCheck: \n    We start at turn t1 at position (0, y_{t1}).\n    We take action a_{t1} -> then we are at turn t1+1 at position (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\n    Then we take action a_{t1+1} -> then we are at turn t1+2 at position (0, y_{t1+2}).\n\n    ...\n\n    We take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then we are at turn t1+H at position (0, y_{t1+H}).\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\nBut according to the update, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H, not at turn t1+H-1.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, we list the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to the last action.\n\nBut note: the player position is updated at the next turn. So to be at (0,9) at a turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that got us there.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. And we have taken H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" ? \n\nWait, in the problem statement: \"reach (0,9)\" and the turn when we are at (0,9) is the turn after the last action? \n\nBut then the minimal H is the number of actions. And we are at the goal at turn t1+H.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then \"to reach (0,9)\".\n\nBut note: in the answer format, we list the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action. The last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our plan, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+6 (i.e., 25+6=31). So H should be 6? Because we take 6 actions: at turns 25,26,27,28,29,30.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? The number of turns we play? That is, the number of actions we take? That is H=6.\n\nAnd then the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+5 (i.e., 25 to 30).\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\n\nBut wait, after the last action at turn30, we are at y=9 at turn31. The problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nBut t1+H-1 = 25+6-1=30. At turn30, we are still at y=8? Because we take action at turn30 to go to y=9 at turn31.\n\nSo we are not at (0,9) at turn30. We are at (0,9) at turn31.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is a critical point.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y=9 at turn31 = t1+6. So we require t1+H-1 = 31 -> 25+H-1=31 -> H=7.\n\nBut that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state is updated at the same turn? \n\nCheck the update rule: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo the state at turn t+1 is determined by the state and action at turn t.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is the state before taking the action at turn t.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1, we are at (0,4). Then we take an action at turn t1, which updates the state to turn t1+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t, we must have taken an action at turn t-1 that led to that state.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H, meaning we have taken H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nHow can we be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? That means we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that led to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut we start at turn t1 at y=4.\n\nSo we need to get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the number of actions we take is H-1? \n\nLet me see the indexing:\n\n    t1: we start at y=4. We take an action a_{t1} -> then we are at y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n    ...\n    We take actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}. That would be H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nBut then after taking action at t1+H-1, we would be at turn t1+H, not at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so H actions. Then the turn indices for actions: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after these actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we are at (0,9) at the turn when we take the last action? But that doesn't make sense because we take the action and then update.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then in the answer format, we list the actions for the turns starting at t1.\n\nBut note: the example in the answer format: \n    Turn t1: a_{t1}\n    Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n    ...\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we are at (0,9) at the next turn? But the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1?\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding.\n\nAnother interpretation: maybe the state is updated immediately? But the update rule clearly says y_{t+1} = ...\n\nLooking at the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And y_T is the player's y at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T. And we take an action at turn T that will update the state for turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nSo we require that at turn T = t1+H-1, we are at y_T=9.\n\nBut how? \n\nWe start at turn t1 at y_{t1}=4.\n\nThen we take an action at turn t1, and we are at y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we need to have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (total H-1 actions) to get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem asks for a sequence of H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThat would be one extra action.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me look at the problem again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut if we take H actions (at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1), then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action, we are at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H. So y_{t1+H-1} is the state before taking the action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we must have reached y=9 at turn t1+H-1 by the actions taken before that turn.\n\nThe action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at y=9? But then the action might move us away? \n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so once we are at (0,9), we are done. But the problem doesn't say we have to stay there. It only says to reach.\n\nBut the collision avoidance is only during the journey. When we are at (0,9), we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1-8), so no collision.\n\nSo we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, but that action might move us to y=10? But y is bounded to [0,9], so if we are at y=9 and take U, then y_{t1+H} = min(9+1,9)=9? Or does it stay at 9? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if at y_t=9 and we take U, then y_{t+1}=min(10,9)=9.\n\nSimilarly, D: 9-1=8, S:9.\n\nSo we can be at 9 and then stay at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. And then we have to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the goal is already reached at turn t1+H-1, so the action at turn t1+H-1 is not necessary for reaching, but the problem asks for a sequence of actions until we have reached.\n\nHowever, the minimal H might be the number of turns we are acting until we have reached. Since at turn t1+H-1 we are at the goal, we don't need to act after that? But the problem says we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 we are at the goal.\n\nBut how did we get to the goal at turn t1+H-1? By the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nSo the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at the goal? And it might be any action, but it doesn't change the state.\n\nSo we can choose any action for the last step? But that would be one extra action.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal H should be the number of actions required to first reach the goal.\n\nWe start at turn t1 at y=4. We want to be at y=9 at turn t1+k for some k.\n\nThe number of actions we take is k, because at each action we advance one turn.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn t1+k, we must have taken k actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+k-1.\n\nThen at turn t1+k, we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we set: t1+H-1 = t1+k  => H-1 = k  => H = k+1.\n\nThat is, H is one more than the number of turns it takes to first reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn t1+5, then k=5, so H=6, and we take actions at turns t1 to t1+5 (6 actions), and we are at y=9 at turn t1+5 = t1+H-1.\n\nIn our case, we reach at turn31 = t1+6, so k=6, then H=7, and we take actions at turns25 to 31? But then we are at y=9 at turn31 = t1+6 = t1+H-1? H=7 -> t1+H-1=25+7-1=31. Yes.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn31, which is t1+6.\n\nAnd we take actions at turns25,26,27,28,29,30,31? But that's 7 actions.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at y=9 at turn31. The actions that got us there are taken at turns25 to30 (6 actions). Then at turn31, we are already at the goal. Do we need to take an action at turn31? The problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. And H is the minimal number of turns such that after H actions we have reached at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut in our case, we reached at turn31 by taking 6 actions. So to have turn31 be t1+H-1, we need H-1=6 -> H=7. And then we take 7 actions: at turns25 to31.\n\nBut the action at turn31 is taken when we are already at y=9. It doesn't matter what we do because we are already at the goal and not in danger (since y=9 is safe). We can choose S, for example.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7? But that seems artificial.\n\nLet me see if we can reach earlier.\n\nIs it possible to be at y=9 at turn30? That is t1+5.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn30, we need to have taken 5 actions: from turn25 to turn29.\n\nBut we start at y=4 at turn25. To get to y=9 in 5 actions, we need 5 steps up: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut we saw that if we do U at turn25: to y5 at turn26\nU at turn26: to y6 at turn27 -> but at turn27, freeway6 is blocked -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot reach at turn30.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is turn31.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn31 = t1+6.\n\nTo satisfy the requirement that at turn t1+H-1=31, we are at y=9, we set 25+H-1=31 -> H=7.\n\nThen we must provide 7 actions: for turns25 to31.\n\nThe actions that move us to y=9 are only the first 6: turns25 to30. The action at turn31 can be anything, say S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: S\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29:U\nTurn30:U  -> after this action, at turn31 we are at y=9.\nTurn31: S  (or U or D, doesn't matter)\n\nBut is turn31 safe? We are at y=9, so no collision. So it's fine.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=7.\n\nBut we only needed 6 actions to get there. The seventh action is redundant.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we have to take H actions.\n\nSince we are required to be at the goal at turn t1+H-1, and we are there at turn31, then H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nAnd we must include the action at turn31.\n\nBut is there a way to be at the goal at an earlier turn? We saw not.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to be at the goal at turn30? But we cannot.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nBut let me double-check the indexing with a smaller example.\n\nSuppose we start at y=8 at turn t1, and we want to go to y=9. Then we can do one action U at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn t1+1.\n\nThen we require at turn t1+H-1 = t1+1, so H-1=1 -> H=2.\n\nAnd we take actions at turn t1 and t1+1.\n\nThe action at turn t1: U -> gets us to y=9 at turn t1+1.\nThe action at turn t1+1: we are at y=9 at turn t1+1 (before taking the action), and then we take an action, say S, and then at turn t1+2, we are still at y=9.\n\nBut the requirement is only to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = t1+1. So it is satisfied.\n\nSo in this case, H=2.\n\nIf we only took one action, then we would be at y=9 at turn t1+1, but then we wouldn't have taken an action at turn t1+1, but the sequence requires H=2 actions.\n\nSo it's consistent.\n\nTherefore, in our case, we are at y=9 at turn31 = t1+6, so H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nSo we need 7 actions.\n\nThe first 6 actions are as before: U, S, U, U, U, U for turns25 to30.\n\nThe last action at turn31: we can choose S.\n\nAnd we are safe at turn31: at y=9, no collision.\n\nNow, we must check that during the journey, we are safe at every turn.\n\nWe already did:\n\nTurn25: y=4 -> safe.\nTurn26: y=5 -> safe.\nTurn27: y=5 -> safe.\nTurn28: y=6 -> safe.\nTurn29: y=7 -> safe.\nTurn30: y=8 -> safe.\nTurn31: y=9 -> safe.\n\nThe actions:\n\nTurn25: U -> moves to y5 at turn26.\nTurn26: S -> stays at y5 at turn27.\nTurn27: U -> moves to y6 at turn28.\nTurn28: U -> moves to y7 at turn29.\nTurn29: U -> moves to y8 at turn30.\nTurn30: U -> moves to y9 at turn31.\nTurn31: S -> stays at y9 at turn32. But we are already at the goal at turn31, so turn32 doesn't matter.\n\nBut note: at turn31, we are at y9. Then we take action S at turn31, and then at turn32 we are still at y9.\n\nThe requirement is only up to turn31 (t1+H-1=25+7-1=31) and we are at y9 at that turn. The action at turn31 is taken at turn31, and then we update to turn32, but we don't care about turn32.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nH=7, and the actions:\n\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: S   (or any, but S is safe)\n\nBut the problem doesn't ask for H in the box, only the sequence of actions in the specified format.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: S\n}\n\nBut note: the turns are labeled as t1, t1+1, etc. Since t1=25, we write:\n\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: S\n\nBut wait, the last turn we write is turn31, which is t1+6, and we are taking actions from t1 to t1+6 (7 actions).\n\nThis matches H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer than 7 actions? We need to be at y=9 at turn31, which requires 6 steps up and one wait, so 6 actions to get there. Then one extra action. So total 7 actions.\n\nIf we can be at y=9 at an earlier turn, we could reduce H. But we cannot.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at y=9 at turn30.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn30, we must have been at y=8 at turn29 and taken U at turn29.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn29, we must have taken actions from turn25 to turn28 (4 actions) to go from y4 to y8.\n\nThe minimal steps: 4 ups: 4 actions. So we would be at y8 at turn29? \n\nTurn25: start y4.\nTurn25: U -> turn26: y5\nTurn26: U -> turn27: y6\nTurn27: U -> turn28: y7\nTurn28: U -> turn29: y8\n\nThen at turn29, we take U to go to y9 at turn30.\n\nBut at turn27, we are at y6 -> freeway6 at turn27: blocked! -> collision.\n\nIf we avoid that by waiting:\n\nTurn25: U -> y5 at26\nTurn26: S -> y5 at27 (safe)\nTurn27: U -> y6 at28 (safe, as we computed freeway6 at28 is safe)\nTurn28: U -> y7 at29 (safe)\nTurn29: U -> y8 at30 (safe)\nTurn30: U -> y9 at31\n\nSo we are at y9 at31, not at30.\n\nWe cannot reach at30.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 25, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required is 7, with the sequence of actions taken from turn 25 to turn 31.\n\n### Collision Analysis and Path Selection\n- **Initial Position (Turn 25)**: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 25 (no car spans 0).\n- **Key Blocking Times** (based on car movements):\n  - Freeway 6 blocked at turn 27.\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 blocked at turn 26.\n  - Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 blocked at turns 29 and 30.\n- **Strategy**: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) by turn 26. Wait at \\(y = 5\\) during turn 27 to avoid freeway 6 blocking. Then move up consecutively to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 31.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 25 (current turn)**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 26. Freeway 4 is safe at turn 25.\n- **Turn 26**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 26.\n- **Turn 27**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 28. Freeway 5 is safe at turn 27, and freeway 6 is safe at turn 28.\n- **Turn 28**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 29. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 28, and freeway 7 is safe at turn 29.\n- **Turn 29**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30. Freeway 7 is safe at turn 29, and freeway 8 is safe at turn 30.\n- **Turn 30**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31. Freeway 8 is safe at turn 30.\n- **Turn 31**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 9\\). The goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 31 (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 31 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 25 + 7 - 1 = 31\\)) with minimal \\(H = 7\\).\n\n### Answer\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: S \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 27, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When moving, the player is only on the freeway corresponding to their y-coordinate at the beginning of the turn. So if at turn T the player is at y_T and moves to y_{T+1} (which is different), then at turn T they are only on freeway y_T, and at turn T+1 they are on freeway y_{T+1}. Thus, we only check the car on the freeway corresponding to the current y at each turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (27). For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost (higher x) and tail leftmost (lower x). For right-moving, the head is the leftmost (lower x) and tail the rightmost (higher x). However, in the update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and at time T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table for freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 12). Since it's right-moving, the initial span at t1=27 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]. Actually, the table says: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (0, -11, right, 12). So for right-moving, the head is the front (which is at the left when moving right) and tail is the end? But the update rule for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, the given tuple is (head, tail) = (0, -11). In the update rule for right-moving, they use [τ, h] as the initial span? But the table says \"head\" and \"tail\". We must interpret:\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving, the initial span at t1 is given as [τ, h]. But the table says: (head, tail) = (0, -11). So if the car is moving right, then the head (front) is at 0 and tail (end) at -11? Then the span is from tail to head: [-11, 0]. So the update for right-moving: at time T, the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12*(T-27), 0 + 12*(T-27)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the initial span is [h, τ] and then [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the table has only right-moving cars in this instance.\n\nWe are to avoid being on a freeway y at turn T when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe start at turn 27 at y=5. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can plan a path through the freeways. We are allowed to stay at y=0 or y=9 without any car (since cars are only on y=1..8). But we start at y=5 and need to get to y=9, so we must go through y=6,7,8.\n\nWe must avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8 at the exact turn when we are on that freeway.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars at any turn T (relative to t1=27) by:\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T, we compute its span at T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 27 to turn 27+H-1 such that the player ends at y=9.\n\nLet t = T - t1, so at t=0 (turn 27) we are at y=5.\n\nWe need to simulate the moves and check for collisions.\n\nFirst, note the car configurations at t1=27:\n\nFreeway 1: right-moving, head=0, tail=-11, speed=12. So at time T, span = [-11 + 12*(T-27), 0 + 12*(T-27)]\nFreeway 2: right-moving, head=-12, tail=-23, speed=6 -> span at T: [-23 + 6*(T-27), -12 + 6*(T-27)]\nFreeway 3: same as 2: [-23 + 6*(T-27), -12 + 6*(T-27)]\nFreeway 4: same: [-23 + 6*(T-27), -12 + 6*(T-27)]\nFreeway 5: same: [-23 + 6*(T-27), -12 + 6*(T-27)]\nFreeway 6: right-moving, head=24, tail=-11, speed=36 -> wait, the table says: (24, -11, right, 36). So head=24, tail=-11? Then span at T: [-11 + 36*(T-27), 24 + 36*(T-27)]\nBut note: the table says \"head\" and \"tail\", and for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the leftmost point) and tail is the end (which is the rightmost point). However, in the update rule, they use [τ, h] for the initial span? Actually, the update rule says: for right-moving, initial span is [τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But the table gives (head, tail). So if the car is moving right, the head is the front (and should be the leftmost) and the tail is the end (rightmost). So the initial span should be [head, tail]? But that would be [0, -11] for freeway1? That doesn't make sense because 0 > -11, so the interval [0, -11] is empty? \n\nThere is a confusion in the notation.\n\nLooking back at the update rule:\n\n- Right-moving: initial span at t1 is [τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut the table lists: (head, tail). So for freeway1: head=0, tail=-11. Then in the update rule, they use [τ, h] = [-11, 0]. So τ is the tail and h is the head? Then we should interpret the table as: the first number is the head, the second is the tail, and for right-moving the head is at the left (smaller x) and tail at the right (larger x). But in the example, head=0 and tail=-11, which would imply head is at 0 and tail at -11? Then the car extends from -11 to 0? But then the head is at 0 and the tail at -11? That would mean the car is moving right, so the head (front) is at 0 and the tail (back) at -11. Then the entire car is from -11 to 0. Then the initial span is [-11,0]. And the update: at time T, the car moves so that the entire segment is shifted by s*(T-t1) to the right? Then the span becomes [-11 + 12*(T-27), 0 + 12*(T-27)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: head=-12, tail=-23 -> the car is from -23 to -12? Then update: [-23 + 6*(T-27), -12 + 6*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway6: head=24, tail=-11 -> car from -11 to 24? Then update: [-11 + 36*(T-27), 24 + 36*(T-27)]\n\nFreeway7 and 8: (48,1,right,48) -> head=48, tail=1? Then car from 1 to 48? Then update: [1 + 48*(T-27), 48 + 48*(T-27)]\n\nBut wait, the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and then shifts by adding s*(T-t1). So τ is the tail (the rightmost point) and h is the head (the leftmost point). So in the table, the first number is the head (leftmost) and the second is the tail (rightmost). Then for freeway1: head=0 (leftmost) and tail=-11 (rightmost)? But that would imply the car extends from 0 to -11? That's backwards. Actually, if the car is moving right, the head (front) is at 0 and the tail (back) is at -11, so the entire car is from -11 to 0. So the leftmost is -11 and the rightmost is 0. Then in the update rule, they use [τ, h] for the initial span? But τ is the tail and h is the head? Then τ=-11, h=0? Then the initial span is [τ, h] = [-11,0]. That matches.\n\nSo we can compute:\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T (with T relative to t1=27: let dt = T-27):\n\nFreeway 1: span = [-11 + 12*dt, 0 + 12*dt] = [12*dt - 11, 12*dt]\nFreeway 2: [-23 + 6*dt, -12 + 6*dt]\nFreeway 3: same as 2\nFreeway 4: same as 2\nFreeway 5: same as 2\nFreeway 6: [-11 + 36*dt, 24 + 36*dt]\nFreeway 7: [1 + 48*dt, 48 + 48*dt]\nFreeway 8: same as 7\n\nWe are concerned only when the player is on freeway k at turn T, then we check if 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at y=5 at turn 27 (dt=0). We are at freeway 5? But freeway 5 is y=5? Actually, the freeways are labeled by k from 1 to 8, and k=1 corresponds to y=1, k=2 to y=2, etc.\n\nSo when the player is at y, they are on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8). At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\nWe need to get from y=5 to y=9. The minimal number of moves would be 4 moves up (if we can go straight without collision). But we must check the cars on freeways 5,6,7,8 at the times we are on them.\n\nWe can also move down or stay to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to simulate from dt=0 (turn27) onwards.\n\nLet y0 = 5.\n\nWe are going to try to find a path with minimal H. We can try H=4: going up 4 times: U,U,U,U.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt turn27 (dt=0): we are at y=5. Check freeway5: car span = [-23 + 6*0, -12 + 6*0] = [-23,-12]. 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen we move up: a_{27}=U -> at turn28 (dt=1): y=6.\n\nAt turn28, we are on freeway6. Check car on freeway6 at dt=1: span = [-11+36*1, 24+36*1] = [25, 60]. 0 is not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nThen a_{28}=U: at turn29 (dt=2): y=7.\n\nAt turn29: freeway7. Car on freeway7: [1+48*2, 48+48*2] = [1+96, 48+96] = [97,144]. 0 not in [97,144] -> safe.\n\nThen a_{29}=U: at turn30 (dt=3): y=8.\n\nAt turn30: freeway8. Same as freeway7: [1+48*3, 48+48*3] = [1+144, 48+144] = [145,192]. 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen a_{30}=U: at turn31 (dt=4): y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo in 4 moves (H=4) we can reach. The sequence: U, U, U, U.\n\nBut we must check every turn we are on a freeway. We started at turn27 (dt=0) at y=5, then at turn28 (dt=1) at y=6, turn29 (dt=2) at y=7, turn30 (dt=3) at y=8, and then at turn31 (dt=4) we are at y=9 (no car). So we only check freeways at turns 27,28,29,30.\n\nAt all these turns, 0 is not in the car's span. Therefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway6 at dt=1: [ -11+36*1 = 25? Actually, -11+36 = 25? Yes. And 24+36=60. So [25,60] does not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at dt=2: [1+96=97, 48+96=144] -> no 0.\n\nBut wait, freeway6: the car at dt=0 (turn27) is at [-11,24]? But at dt=0: [-11+0, 24+0] = [-11,24]. At turn27 (dt=0) on freeway6: if the player were there at dt=0, they would be in danger? But we are not on freeway6 at dt=0. We are at freeway5 at dt=0.\n\nNow, at dt=1 (turn28): the car on freeway6 has moved to [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60]. So 0 is not in [25,60].\n\nSimilarly, the car on freeway7 at dt=0 is [1,48]? Then at dt=2: [1+96,48+96]=[97,144] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 27: U  (from y=5 to y=6 at the next state, but at turn27 we are at y=5, then we move to y=6 at the beginning of turn28? Actually, the update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn27: y=5.\nWe do a_{27}=U -> then at the start of turn28: y=6.\n\nSo we are at freeway5 at turn27, and then at freeway6 at turn28, etc.\n\nWe have to check:\n\n- Turn27 (dt=0): freeway5 -> safe (0 not in [-23,-12])\n- Turn28 (dt=1): freeway6 -> safe (0 not in [25,60])\n- Turn29 (dt=2): freeway7 -> safe (0 not in [97,144])\n- Turn30 (dt=3): freeway8 -> safe (0 not in [145,192])\n\nThen at turn31 (dt=4): we are at y=9, so done.\n\nSo the actions: \nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\n\nBut we must output the actions for turns starting at t1 (27) for H=4 turns? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. And we need to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn27 (t=0) and do actions at turn27,28,29,30 (t=0,1,2,3) -> H=4. Then at turn31 (which is t1+4) we are at y=9. But the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. So at turn27+4-1 = turn30? But at turn30 we are at y=8 (if we did three U's we would be at y=8 at turn30). Let me clarify:\n\n- At turn27 (t0=27): we are at y=5. We do a_{27}=U -> then at turn28: y=6.\n- At turn28: we do a_{28}=U -> at turn29: y=7.\n- At turn29: we do a_{29}=U -> at turn30: y=8.\n- At turn30: we do a_{30}=U -> at turn31: y=9.\n\nSo at the end of the sequence (after the last action at turn30), the next state is turn31 at y=9. But we are to have the position at turn t1+H-1 = 27+H-1 = 27+4-1 = 30. But at turn30, we are at y=8? \n\nThe problem says: we are to find a sequence of actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1, the position is (0,9). \n\nBut note: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we update to the next state. So at turn t1+H-1, we are at a position, and then we apply the action to get to the next state at turn (t1+H-1)+1. But the goal is that at the state at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we want that \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nThe state y_{t} is the state at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action? The game dynamics: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_{t}\". So at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we get y_{t+1}. Therefore, we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would be y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}. But we want the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9? Or the state after the last action to be 9?\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. And we are to have the position at turn t1+H-1. So that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1. But if at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are already at (0,9), then we don't need to move? However, the problem says we start at (0,5) at turn t1=27, and we are to take actions until we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo let me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the condition: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nIn our plan:\n\n- At turn27 (t1): we start at y=5. Then we take an action. We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of some turn T = t1+H-1.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn27: begin at y=5 -> take action a27 -> then at turn28: y = 5 + Δy27.\n\nTurn28: begin at y6 -> take a28 -> turn29: y7.\n\nTurn29: begin at y7 -> take a29 -> turn30: y8.\n\nTurn30: begin at y8 -> take a30 -> turn31: y9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn31, we are at y=9. Therefore, we want to set H-1 = 4? Then H = 5? But then the turn we are at (0,9) is at turn t1+H-1 = 27+5-1 = 31.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions would be for t=0 to H-1, i.e., from turn27 to turn27+H-1. So if H=5, then we do actions at turns 27,28,29,30,31? But then at turn31 we do an action? But we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn31? Then we can do S (stay) at turn31? But that would be an extra action.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=9 at the beginning of turn30? How?\n\nWe need to get from y=5 to y=9 in 3 moves? Then we would be at y=8 at the beginning of turn28? Then we do two more U: at turn28: from y=8 to y=9? Then at turn29: we are at y=9 at the beginning? Then H-1 = 2? So H=3? But we started at turn27 at y=5.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n- Turn27: start at y=5, do U -> turn28: y=6.\n- Turn28: do U -> turn29: y=7.\n- Turn29: do U -> turn30: y=8.\n\nWe are at y=8 at the beginning of turn30. We need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn30? Then we must have been at y=9 at the beginning of turn30. How?\n\nWe must do 4 moves? Then we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn31.\n\nSo the minimal H such that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is H=5? Then the state at turn31 (which is 27+4) is the 5th state? Actually, the turns are:\n\nAt turn27: state y5.\nAfter action at turn27: state at turn28: y6.\nAfter action at turn28: state at turn29: y7.\nAfter action at turn29: state at turn30: y8.\nAfter action at turn30: state at turn31: y9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn31, we are at y9. Therefore, we want H such that t1+H-1 = 31. So 27+H-1=31 -> H=5.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is for turns 27,28,29,30 (4 actions). But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so we need H actions? \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So if H=5, then t from 0 to 4: actions at turns 27,28,29,30,31. But at turn31, if we are at y9 at the beginning, we can do S (or anything, but we are already at goal). So we can do:\n\n- Turn27: U\n- Turn28: U\n- Turn29: U\n- Turn30: U\n- Turn31: S   (to stay, but actually we don't need to move)\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn31. Then we are done. But the action at turn31 is taken? Then we are still at (0,9) after the action? So we can do S.\n\nBut is H=5 minimal? We have to get from 5 to 9, which is 4 steps, so we need at least 4 moves. But we have 4 moves (the U's) and then one extra action? But the last action at turn31: we are at y9 and we do S, which is harmless. But we could have been at y9 at the beginning of turn30? Then we wouldn't need the last action.\n\nHow to be at y9 at the beginning of turn30? We must have arrived at turn30 at y9. Then the action at turn29 must have been U and we were at y8 at turn29. So:\n\n- Turn27: start at y5 -> do U -> turn28: y6.\n- Turn28: do U -> turn29: y7.\n- Turn29: do U -> turn30: y8? Then at turn30 we are at y8, not y9.\n\nTo be at y9 at turn30, we must have:\n\n- At turn29: we were at y8, then we do U -> then at turn30: y9.\n\nSo we need to be at y8 at turn29. Then:\n\n- Turn27: y5 -> U -> turn28: y6.\n- Turn28: y6 -> U -> turn29: y7? Then we are at y7 at turn29, then U -> turn30: y8.\n\nStill not y9 at turn30.\n\nWe need 4 moves to go from y5 to y9: 5->6,6->7,7->8,8->9. So we cannot be at y9 at the beginning of turn30 if we started at y5 at turn27. We must use 4 moves, so the earliest we can be at y9 is at the beginning of turn31.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5. The actions: we do 4 U's and then at the last turn (turn31) we do S? But we are already at y9 at the beginning of turn31, so we can do S. But we could also do nothing? The problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do 4 U's and then we are at y9 at the beginning of turn31, but we must specify an action for turn31? Then we do S.\n\nBut note: we are to avoid collisions at the turns when we are on a freeway. At turn31, we are at y9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So we are safe.\n\nBut we must check the entire path:\n\nWe are on:\n\n- Turn27 (dt=0): y=5 -> freeway5: safe? car: [-23, -12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n- Turn28 (dt=1): y=6 -> freeway6: [ -11+36*1, 24+36*1] = [25,60] -> safe.\n- Turn29 (dt=2): y=7 -> freeway7: [1+48*2, 48+48*2] = [97,144] -> safe.\n- Turn30 (dt=3): y=8 -> freeway8: same as 7: [1+48*3, 48+48*3] = [145,192] -> safe.\n- Turn31 (dt=4): y=9 -> not a freeway, safe.\n\nThen the actions: \nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: U\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: S   (to stay at y9)\n\nBut we could do anything at turn31? But we are at y9, so if we do U, we would go to y10? But y is bounded to [0,9]. The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and then clamped? The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9? But then we can do U at turn31 and still be at y9. But the problem doesn't specify clamping? It says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so it must be clamped. So we can do U at turn31 and then y_{32}=9 (if clamped). But that would be the same as doing S.\n\nBut to be safe, we do S.\n\nBut the problem says: minimal number of turns H. We have H=5. But we are at y9 at the beginning of turn31, which is the state after 5 actions? Actually, we took 5 actions: at turns 27,28,29,30,31. But the last action at turn31 is not necessary? However, we must provide H actions.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. So if H=5, then t1+H-1 = 27+5-1=31. So we are at y9 at the beginning of turn31. Then the action at turn31 is taken? But we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn31. So the action at turn31 doesn't change the state? But we must provide it.\n\nAlternatively, we can do only 4 actions? Then the state at the beginning of turn27+4-1 = turn30. We want at turn30 to be at y9. But with 4 actions (at turns27,28,29,30) we get:\n\n- After action27: turn28: y6.\n- After action28: turn29: y7.\n- After action29: turn30: y8.\n- After action30: turn31: y9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn30, we are at y8, not y9. So we are not at the goal at turn30.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=5 and be at y9 at turn31.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: U\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: S\n\nBut we must check if we are safe at turn30: we are at y8 at turn30 (dt=3) -> freeway8: [1+48*3, 48+48*3] = [145,192] -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn31: we are at y9 -> safe.\n\nBut is there a way to get there in H=4? Then we would need to be at y9 at turn27+4-1 = turn30. So we need to be at y9 at the beginning of turn30. How?\n\nTo be at y9 at turn30, we must have been at y8 at turn29 and done U at turn29. Then:\n\n- Turn27: from y5 to ... \n- We must go from y5 to y8 in two moves? That requires 3 moves: 5->6,6->7,7->8. So we can be at y8 at turn29? Then at turn29: do U -> then at turn30: y9.\n\nBut we start at turn27 at y5.\n\n- Turn27: do U -> turn28: y6.\n- Turn28: do U -> turn29: y7.\n- Then at turn29: we are at y7. Then we do U -> turn30: y8, not y9.\n\nWe need to do three U's to go from 5 to 8? Then at turn30 we are at y8. Then we need a fourth U at turn30 to get to y9 at turn31.\n\nSo we cannot get to y9 at turn30. Therefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut note: we can also move faster? The moves are only ±1 or 0. So we cannot jump.\n\nAlternatively, we can move up twice and then wait? But that would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut in our initial plan we only used 4 moves? But we need to specify 5 actions? The last one is at turn31, and we are already at goal.\n\nBut the problem says: minimal number of turns H. And we are to provide a sequence of H actions.\n\nWe can try to see if we can avoid the last S by being at y9 earlier? We cannot.\n\nBut note: the freeway cars: are there any that might hit at a different time? We have to check if we can go faster? But we are going as fast as possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up and then down? That would be slower.\n\nSo we stick to H=5.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the last action? The problem says: the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. And after the last action, we are at the state at the next turn? But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). So if we take H-1 actions? Then we would be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me reexamine:\n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t: y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 5.\n\nWe take actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThen the state after these actions? The last action is at turn t1+H-1, so we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut we want the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9? Or at the beginning of turn t1+H to be 9?\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we take an action a_{t1+H-1}? But we are already at 9, so we can do S (or U/D, but then we might leave? But we are at 9, so U would try to go to 10, but then clamped to 9? So we remain at 9.\n\nSo in any case, we must take an action at turn t1+H-1? Because the sequence includes actions for t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of that turn? Then the action doesn't change the state? \n\nSo for our case: we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn31 (which is t1+4). Then t1+H-1=31 -> 27+H-1=31 -> H=5.\n\nThen the actions are for turns 27,28,29,30,31.\n\nWe are at:\n\n- Turn27: y5 -> do U -> turn28: y6.\n- Turn28: y6 -> do U -> turn29: y7.\n- Turn29: y7 -> do U -> turn30: y8.\n- Turn30: y8 -> do U -> turn31: y9? But then at the beginning of turn31, we are at y9? Then we do a_{31}: we can do S, and then at turn32: still y9.\n\nBut we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=y_{31}=9 at the beginning of turn31. Then we do an action at turn31? But the goal is only to reach (0,9) at turn31? Then we have done it. The action at turn31 is taken after we are already at the goal.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say we stop after reaching the goal. It says we must provide a sequence that by the end we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn31, and then we take an action (any) at turn31. But we are still at (0,9) after that action? So we can choose any action? We choose S.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is 5. But we are at the goal at the beginning of turn31, so we have reached. The last action doesn't harm.\n\nBut we must check if the last action (at turn31) causes a collision? But we are at y9, which is not a freeway, so no car to collide.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: U\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: S\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? Then we must be at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+4-1 = turn30.\n\nSo at turn30, we are at y9. How?\n\nWe must have been at y8 at turn29 and done U at turn29. Then:\n\n- Turn29: do U -> then at turn30: y9.\n\nBut we start at turn27 at y5.\n\n- Turn27: do U -> turn28: y6.\n- Turn28: do U -> turn29: y7.\n\nThen at turn29: we are at y7. Then we do U -> turn30: y8, not y9.\n\nTo be at y8 at turn29, we need:\n\n- Turn27: from y5 to ... in two moves: 5 to 6 to 7? Then at turn29: we are at y7.\n\nWe cannot be at y8 at turn29. Therefore, H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway5 at turn27: we are at y5 at turn27: car5: [-23, -12] -> safe.\n\nWhat if we try to go faster? We can't.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y6 and then wait? But that would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal is 5.\n\nBut in our initial simulation, we only needed 4 actions to get to y9? But we have to account for the state at the beginning of the last turn.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=5. And we are at (0,9) at turn31 (the beginning).\n\nBut note: the car on freeway6 at turn28: we checked [25,60] -> safe. But what about the car on freeway6 at turn27? We don't care because we are not on freeway6 at turn27.\n\nBut what if we try to go up one step and then wait? For example, if we go to y6 at turn28, and then wait at y6 for a turn? Then we would be at y6 at turn29? Then we check freeway6 at turn29 (dt=2): [-11+36*2, 24+36*2] = [-11+72, 24+72] = [61,96]. 0 not in -> safe. Then we can proceed. But that would take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y9 in 4 moves (actions) but then we are at y9 at turn31, and we still need the last action.\n\nSo we stick to H=5.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at y9 at an earlier turn? Only if we start at a higher y? We start at y5.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nSo I think the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway1 at dt=0: [12*0-11, 12*0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? At dt=0: [ -11, 0]. So 0 is the right endpoint? Is 0 included? The interval is closed? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\". So if the car span is [a,b] and a<=0<=b, then collision.\n\nAt freeway1, at dt=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Then if we are on freeway1 at dt=0, we collide? But we are at y=5 at dt=0, so safe.\n\nBut if we were to go to freeway1 at some turn? We don't.\n\nSimilarly, at dt=1: freeway1: [12*1-11, 12*1] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut we are not going to freeway1.\n\nNow, what about freeway6 at dt=0: [-11,24] -> 0 is in? Because -11<=0<=24? Then if we were at freeway6 at dt=0, we would collide. But we are at y5 at dt=0.\n\nIn our plan, we are at freeway6 at dt=1: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nBut what if we go to freeway6 at dt=0? We cannot because we start at y5.\n\nSo the only potential danger is if we are at a freeway at a turn when the car covers 0.\n\nIn our path, we avoid that.\n\nBut we must check the entire sequence.\n\nAt turn27 (dt=0): y5 -> freeway5: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn28 (dt=1): y6 -> freeway6: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nAt turn29 (dt=2): y7 -> freeway7: [1+96,48+96]=[97,144] -> safe.\n\nAt turn30 (dt=3): y8 -> freeway8: [1+144,48+144]=[145,192] -> safe.\n\nAt turn31 (dt=4): y9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=5. Is there a way with H=4? We argued not, because we need 4 moves to go from 5 to 9, and then we are at the goal at the beginning of turn31, which is the 5th state.\n\nBut note: the problem might count the turns differently? Or perhaps we can be at y9 at turn30 by a different route? For example, if we go up to y9 in 4 moves, but we are at y9 at turn31, so that's after 4 actions? Then we need the state at the beginning of turn30 to be y9? But we can't.\n\nAlternatively, we start at turn27 and do 3 actions? Then the state at turn27+3-1 = turn29? We want at turn29 to be at y9. But we start at y5: we need 4 moves, so impossible.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 5, starting from turn \\(t_1 = 27\\). The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 27, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). Moving up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 28 avoids collision with the car on freeway 5 (span \\([-23, -12]\\)), as 0 is not in the span.\n- At turn 28, moving up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 29 avoids collision with the car on freeway 6 (span \\([25, 60]\\)), as 0 is not in the span.\n- At turn 29, moving up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30 avoids collision with the car on freeway 7 (span \\([97, 144]\\)), as 0 is not in the span.\n- At turn 30, moving up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31 avoids collision with the car on freeway 8 (span \\([145, 192]\\)), as 0 is not in the span.\n- At turn 31, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of the turn. Staying (S) maintains the position at \\(y = 9\\), and no collision occurs as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 31 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 27 + 5 - 1 = 31\\)) in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 27: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 28: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 29: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 30: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 31: } S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 30, and I have the positions and speeds of the cars on each freeway.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]. Since they're moving right, the head is to the right, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] and it moves right, so at time T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], but in this case, all cars are right-moving, according to the table. Let me check:\n\nAll cars have direction \"right\", so all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37? That seems odd because usually head is larger for right-moving, but here head=48, tail=37, so tail=37, head=48, so span [37,48] at t_1=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) — tail=-59, head=-48? Since it's right-moving, and tail should be left, head right, so if both negative, tail=-59 is left, head=-48 is right since -48 > -59.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36) — tail=-83, head=-48\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48) — tail=-95, head=-48\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is at position x=0 on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, y_T is the row, and we need to avoid when y_T is between 1 and 8, and x=0 is occupied by a car on that row.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn t_1=30.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\nActions: U, D, S to move up, down, or stay. y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy as above, and y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, and rows 1-8 have cars, we need to move up, but avoid the times when a car is at x=0 on the row we're on.\n\nThe key point is that at each turn, when we are on a row y between 1 and 8, we need that for that row, at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nMoreover, note that if we move to a different row at turn T, we are not on that row until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T we are on y_T, and we take action to go to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, we are only on row y_T, so we only care about cars on row y_T at turn T. At turn T+1, we are on row y_{T+1}, so we care about cars on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if at turn T there is a car at x=0 on y_{T+1}, it doesn't matter because you're not there yet.\n\nSimilarly, when you leave a row, at the turn you leave, you might still be there, but since you're moving, you're only on the row when you start the turn there or something? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe collision definition: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T. That means, at the time when you are on row y_T, if at that same time, a car on that row has 0 in its span, you collide.\n\nAnd the note clarifies: if at turn T you decide to move to a different row, so y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T you are on y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}, so for turn T, you only care about row y_T, and for turn T+1, you care about row y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, since the player moves instantly at the end of the turn or something? Let's see the update: y_{t+1} is based on action at t, so at turn t, position is y_t, and action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo during turn t, you are at position (0, y_t), and you take action a_t, then at the start of turn t+1, you are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at turn T, meaning when you are at (0, y_T), and if at that time, for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span, then collision.\n\nSo for each turn T, we need that if y_T is between 1 and 8, then no car on row y_T has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nFor y_T=0 or 9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nNow, we start at T=t_1=30, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is also safe.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns H, meaning we want to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, the minimal number of moves would be 9 moves up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should try to go up as fast as possible, only deviating when necessary to avoid a collision.\n\nNow, for each row from 1 to 8, we need to find when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nFirst, let's define the time from current turn.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1 = T - 30, so at τ=0, current time.\n\nFor each freeway k, the car span at time τ (relative) is:\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at time τ is [τ_k + s_k * τ, h_k + s_k * τ], where τ_k and h_k are the tail and head at τ=0.\n\nIn the notation, for each car, we have (head, tail, dir, speed) at t_1.\n\nSo for right-moving, span at t_1 is [tail, head]? Let's see the car update:\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd at T=t_1, it should be [τ, h], so yes, at t_1, span is [tail, head] for right-moving.\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, ...), but for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12), so head=48, tail=37, so at t_1, span [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6), head=-48, tail=-59, span [-59,-48] at t_1.\n\nNow, we need 0 to be not in the span at time T for row y_T.\n\nSo for a given freeway k, at time τ, span is [τ_k + s_k τ, h_k + s_k τ]\n\n0 is in span if τ_k + s_k τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_k + s_k τ\n\nSince the span is [left, right] with left <= right.\n\nFor right-moving, left = tail + s τ, right = head + s τ.\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, i.e., tail + s τ <= 0 and 0 <= head + s τ\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo for each row, we need for that row at time τ, the inequality not satisfied.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find when 0 is in the span.\n\nLet's list for each row the car parameters at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): head=48, tail=37, s=12\n\nSo left = 37 + 12τ, right = 48 + 12τ\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12τ <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 12τ\n\nBut 37 + 12τ <= 0 implies τ <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, and 0 <= 48 + 12τ implies τ >= -4.\n\nSince τ >=0 (future times), 48 + 12τ >=48 >0, so 0 <= right always true for τ>=0.\n\nThen 37 + 12τ <=0 only if τ <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but τ >=0, so 37+12τ >=37>0, so left >0, thus 0 < left <= right, so 0 not in span for any τ>=0. So row 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt τ=0, span [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAs τ increases, both increase, so span moves right, always positive, so 0 never in span for τ>=0. So indeed, for row 1, it is always safe to be there, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nIs that right? The car is at [37,48] at τ=0, moving right at speed 12, so it starts at x=37 to 48 and moving away, so yes, x=0 is never occupied. So row y=1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): head=-48, tail=-59, s=6\n\nLeft = tail + s τ = -59 + 6τ\n\nRight = head + s τ = -48 + 6τ\n\n0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, i.e. -59 + 6τ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 6τ\n\nWhich is τ >= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 and τ <= 48/6 = 8\n\nτ >= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 and τ <= 8\n\nBut 9.833 > 8, so impossible. Thus for all τ, 0 not in span. Similarly, at τ=0, span [-59,-48], both negative, 0 not in. As τ increases, when τ=8, right= -48+48=0? -48 + 6*8 = -48+48=0, so at τ=8, right=0.\n\nLeft = -59 + 48 = -11 <0, so at τ=8, span [left, right] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 is in span since left <=0 and 0<=0? 0 <= right is true when right=0.\n\nSimilarly, left <=0 is true.\n\nSo at τ=8, 0 is in span.\n\nSimilarly, for τ<8, right <0, so 0 > right, not in span.\n\nFor τ>8, right>0, but left = -59 +6τ, at τ=10, left=-59+60=1>0, so span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, when is 0 in span?\n\n-59 +6τ <=0 and 0 <= -48 +6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <= 59/6 ≈9.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6τ => 6τ >=48 => τ >=8\n\nSo for τ between 8 and 59/6≈9.833, 0 is in span.\n\nSince τ integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer.\n\nτ = T - t_1, integer.\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9 inclusive? τ=8: right= -48+48=0, left=-59+48=-11<=0, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=9: left= -59 +54= -5 <=0, right= -48+54=6 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=10: left= -59+60=1>0, right=6>0, 0 not <= right? 0 <=6 true, but left=1>0, so 0 < left, not in span.\n\nSimilarly τ=7: left=-59+42=-17<0, right=-48+42=-6<0, so 0 > right, not in span.\n\nSo for row y=2, collision when τ=8 or τ=9.\n\nThat is, at relative times 8 and 9 after t_1.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Table says freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car: head=-48, tail=-59, s=6.\n\nSo for each of rows 2,3,4,5, the car is identical, so same unsafe times: τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nBut they are on different rows, so we need to consider each row separately.\n\nFor row 2, at τ=8 and 9, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for row 3, same, unsafe at τ=8,9.\n\nBut row 3 is different freeway, but same car config, so yes.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-83, s=36\n\nLeft = tail + s τ = -83 + 36τ\n\nRight = head + s τ = -48 + 36τ\n\n0 in span if -83 +36τ <=0 and 0 <= -48 +36τ\n\nFirst: -83 +36τ <=0 => 36τ <=83 => τ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +36τ => 36τ >=48 => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSo τ between 1.333 and 2.305, so for integer τ, τ=2? Since τ=1: left=-83+36= -47<0, right=-48+36=-12<0, 0 not <= right? 0 > right.\n\nτ=2: left=-83+72= -11 <=0, right=-48+72=24 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=3: left=-83+108=25>0, right=24+36? -48+108=60>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, row y=6 unsafe.\n\nτ=2: yes.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-95, s=48\n\nLeft = -95 + 48τ\n\nRight = -48 + 48τ\n\n0 in span if -95 +48τ <=0 and 0 <= -48 +48τ\n\nFirst: -95 +48τ <=0 => 48τ <=95 => τ <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +48τ => 48τ >=48 => τ >=1\n\nSo τ between 1 and 1.979, so for integer τ, only τ=1? τ=1: left=-95+48= -47 <=0? -47 <=0 true, right=-48+48=0, so 0 <=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nτ=2: left=-95+96=1>0, right=-48+96=48>0, 0 not in.\n\nτ=0: left=-95<0, right=-48<0, 0 not <= right.\n\nSo only at τ=1, unsafe for row y=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, (-48,-95,right,48), so only unsafe at τ=1.\n\nNow, row 1 we said always safe.\n\nSummarize the unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\n- y=3: unsafe at τ=8,9 (since same car)\n\n- y=4: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\n- y=5: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\n- y=6: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at τ=1\n\n- y=8: unsafe at τ=1\n\nτ is relative time from now, t_1=30.\n\nWe need to get from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H, so at relative time H-1, we should be at y=9.\n\nLet t be the relative time step, starting from 0.\n\nAt time t (relative), position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nWe apply actions for t=0 to H-1, and at t=H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\ny_t changes by +1, -1, or 0 each step.\n\nSince we start at 0 and end at 9, we must have net +9, so we need at least 9 up moves. If we never go down or stay, H=9, y_9=9? Let's see.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, after first action, at t=1, y could be 0,1, or -1 but y>=0, so if at y=0 and D, y stays 0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}= max(0, -1)=0? Since y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0, similarly if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nIn this case, start y=0, end y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if we go up every step, we reach y=9 in 9 steps: after 9 up moves, y_9=9.\n\nBut we might hit unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nWe need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are for specific τ.\n\nSince τ = t, relative time.\n\nt starts from 0.\n\nAt relative time t, we are at position y_t.\n\nFor y_t between 1 and 8, it must not be unsafe at time t.\n\nNow, let's list the constraints.\n\nFirst, row y=1: always safe, so no problem.\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=8 and t=9\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=2\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=1\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=1\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are t=1,2,8,9.\n\nt=1: rows 7 and 8 are unsafe, so we must not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=1.\n\nt=2: row 6 is unsafe, so not on y=6 at t=2.\n\nt=8 and t=9: rows 2,3,4,5 are unsafe, so not on those rows at t=8 or t=9.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0 at t=0, and want to go to y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid the unsafe positions.\n\nFirst, at t=1, we must not be on y=7 or 8. But at t=0, we are at y=0, so after one action, at t=1, we can be at y=0 or y=1 (if S or U; D would keep at 0).\n\nSince we start at y=0, at t=1, y can be 0 or 1, not 7 or 8, so no problem, we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, we must not be on y=6. At t=1, we are at y=0 or 1, so at t=2, after action, we can be from y=0 to y=2 (if from 1 and U).\n\ny=6 is far, so at t=2, we cannot be at y=6 anyway, since we start from low y. So no issue.\n\nt=2 is early, we are still at low y, so y=6 is not reachable yet. Max we can be at t=2 is y=2 (if U,U from t=0 and t=1).\n\nSimilarly, min y=0.\n\nSo at t=2, y_t <=2 <6, so we cannot be on y=6, so automatically safe for row 6 at t=2. Similarly, rows 7 and 8 at t=1 are not reachable.\n\nSo the only real constraints are at t=8 and t=9, where we must not be on rows 2,3,4,5.\n\nThat is, at time t=8 and t=9, y_t should not be 2,3,4, or 5.\n\nSince rows 2,3,4,5 are all unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 by some time.\n\nThe minimal H is 9, with y_t = t for t=0 to 9, but at t=8, y=8, which is not 2,3,4,5, so it should be ok? y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut row y=8 is unsafe only at t=1, not at t=8.\n\nUnsafe for y=8 is at t=1, not at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, unsafe rows are 2,3,4,5.\n\nSo if we go directly up, at t=8, y=8, which is safe since row 8 is unsafe only at t=1, not t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to check if we hit any other unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=1, we are at y=1 if we go U first, or y=0 if S or D.\n\ny=1 at t=1: row y=1 is always safe, so ok.\n\nAt t=2, y=2 if we go U,U.\n\ny=2 at t=2: is row y=2 unsafe at t=2? Earlier, for y=2, unsafe only at t=8 and t=9, not at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo if we go straight up: actions all U.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\na_t: U, then t=1: y=1, safe (row 1 always safe)\n\na_t=U, t=2: y=2, row y=2 at t=2: unsafe only at t=8,9, t=2 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, t=3: y=3, safe\n\n...\n\nUp to t=8: y=8, row y=8 unsafe at t=1, not t=8, so safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut is there a collision at some point?\n\nAt t=8, y=8, row 8: at time t=8, is there a car at x=0?\n\nFor row 8, freeway 8, car at relative time τ=t=8.\n\nEarlier for row 8, unsafe only at τ=1, not at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, for row 2 at t=2, not unsafe.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor row 2: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\nAt τ=2, which is t=2, not unsafe, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe only at τ=2, but at τ=2, if we are on row 6, but in the direct path, at t=2, we are at y=2, not y=6, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 unsafe at τ=1, but at t=1, we are at y=1, not 7.\n\nSo it seems the direct path is safe.\n\nBut let's list the positions over time for direct up:\n\nRelative time t | y_t | row safe? \n\nt=0: y=0, safe (not on freeway)\n\nt=1: y=1, row 1 always safe\n\nt=2: y=2, row 2 at t=2: unsafe only at t=8,9, so t=2 safe\n\nt=3: y=3, row 3 at t=3: unsafe only at t=8,9, so safe\n\nt=4: y=4, row 4 at t=4: safe, not t=8,9\n\nt=5: y=5, row 5 at t=5: safe\n\nt=6: y=6, row 6 at t=6: unsafe only at t=2, not t=6, so safe? row 6 unsafe at τ=2 only.\n\nAt t=6, τ=6, not 2, so safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, row 7 at t=7: unsafe only at τ=1, not 7, so safe\n\nt=8: y=8, row 8 at t=8: unsafe only at τ=1, not 8, so safe\n\nt=9: y=9, safe\n\nSo all safe, and we reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at t=9, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn terms of actions: we take actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so H actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, we take action a_{t_1 + t}, and after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, that's H actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be y=9? Let's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nReach (0,9), meaning at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nBut in the sequence, after actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's see: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, the position at time t_1 + H is set.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} = y after H actions.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSimilarly, at start, turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =0.\n\nWith H actions, we go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nIn the above, with all U, we reach y=9 at turn t_1 + 9.\n\nTurn t_1: position (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at t_1+1: y=1 if U\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + 8}, position at t_1+9: y=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 +9, position (0,9).\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1+8.\n\nIn the path above, all positions are safe as we checked.\n\nBut is row 1 always safe? Yes.\n\nAnd no issues at t=1,2,etc.\n\nBut let's confirm for row 6 at t=6.\n\nIn direct path, at t=6 relative, y=6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at τ=2, which is t=2, not t=6, so at t=6, τ=6, for row 6 car: left = -83 + 36*6 = -83 + 216 = 133, right = -48 + 216=168, both positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,9) at turn t_1 +9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H=9, actions all U.\n\nBut the answer should be for the minimal H, which is 9.\n\nBut perhaps there is a problem at t=8 and t=9 for rows 2-5, but in the path, at t=8, we are at y=8, which is not 2-5, so fine.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nSo it should be ok.\n\nBut let's list the car positions to be thorough.\n\nFor example, at t=8 relative, τ=8.\n\nFor row y=2: at τ=8, car span: left = tail + s τ = -59 + 6*8 = -59+48= -11, right= -48 +48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in span, so if we were on y=2 at τ=8, collision, but we are at y=8, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for row y=8 at τ=8: car span: for y=8, car head=-48, tail=-95, s=48, left= -95 + 48*8 = -95 + 384= 289, right= -48 + 384=336, both large positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the car on row 6 at τ=2 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see if we can do faster? H=8?\n\nIf H=8, we need to reach y=9 in 8 actions.\n\nStart from y=0, after 8 actions, y=9.\n\nSince we start at 0, end at 9, net change +9 in 8 steps, so we must have 9 up and possibly some down or stay, but since net +9 in 8 steps, the sum of Δy must be +9.\n\nEach action: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo to have net +9 in 8 actions, we need 9 U and some D or S, but 9 U would require 9 actions, with 8 actions, we can have at most 8 U, so y <=8 after 8 actions, cannot reach y=9.\n\nExactly, with 8 actions, starting from y=0, the maximum y we can reach is 8 (if all U), so y_{t_1 +8} <=8 <9, so we cannot reach y=9 in 8 actions.\n\nSimilarly, with H actions, to reach y=9 from y=0, we need at least 9 actions, since each U increases by 1, and D or S don't help to increase.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, and we can achieve it with all U.\n\nThus the sequence is all U for 9 actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=30.\n\nSo actions from turn 30 to turn 38.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to 8? t from 0 to H-1=8, so turns 30 to 38.\n\nAfter action at 38, position at 39 is y=9.\n\nThe sequence: a_{30} to a_{38}, all U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars?\n\nPerhaps for row 1, but it's always safe.\n\nAnother thing: the player position at each turn.\n\nAt turn 30: y=0, safe\n\nAction U: to y=1\n\nTurn 31: y=1, row 1: at τ=1, car? Row 1 car at τ=1: left=37+12*1=49, right=48+12=60? 48+12=60, span [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 32: y=2, row 2 at τ=2: left= -59 +12? s=6 for row 2? Freeway 2, s=6.\n\nLeft = tail + s τ = -59 + 6*2 = -59+12= -47? τ=2 relative.\n\nt_1=30, turn T=32, τ=2.\n\nLeft = -59 + 6*2 = -59+12= -47, right= -48 +12= -36, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some rows? No, each row has one car, as per table.\n\nFreeway k for k=1 to 8, each has one car.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, actions all U.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nSo for turn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn 39.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions at turns 30 to 38.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nBut H=9, from t=0 to 8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 30 +9 -1=38, yes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for row 6 at τ=2, which is turn 32, if we were on y=6, but we are not, we are on y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be complete, at turn 32 (τ=2), row y=6: car span left= -83 +36*2= -83+72= -11, right= -48+72=24, so [ -11,24], 0 in span, so if on y=6 at that turn, collision, but we are on y=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is, in the beginning, I thought rows 2-5 are unsafe at t=8,9, but since we are at y=8 and y=9, not on those rows, it's ok.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if we stay or move down to avoid, but that would increase H, which is not minimal.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal and achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,0) at turn 30.\n\nAfter U at turn 30, to (0,1) at turn 31.\n\nAnd so on, to (0,9) at turn 39.\n\nActions from 30 to 38.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=9, and we have 9 actions.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t=0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nIn the box, we need to write it like that.\n\nSince all are U, we can say all actions are U.\n\nBut I think listing is fine.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify the turns.\n\nAnother thing: in the car update, for right-moving, it says span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], and for freeway 1, at t_1, head=48, tail=37, so [37,48].\n\nBut in the position, x=0, which is far away.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check row 5 at some time.\n\nIn the path, at τ=5, y=5, row 5: car head=-48, tail=-59, s=6, left= -59 +6*5= -59+30= -29, right= -48+30= -18, both neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8, row 8: car left= -95 +48*8= -95+384=289, right=-48+384=336, 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I believe this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 30 to turn 38, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 39.\n\n### Verification of Safety and Path:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars).\n- At each subsequent turn, the player moves up by one unit, reaching \\(y = t - 30 + 1\\) at turn \\(t\\) for \\(t = 31\\) to \\(39\\).\n- Collisions are avoided because:\n  - For row \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1): The car span is always positive for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\), so \\(x = 0\\) is never occupied. Thus, row 1 is always safe.\n  - For rows \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) (freeways 2-5): These rows are unsafe only at relative times \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\) (turns 38 and 39). At these times, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) and \\(y = 9\\), not on rows 2-5, so no collision occurs.\n  - For row \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6): Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 32). At turn 32, the player is at \\(y = 2\\), not \\(y = 6\\), so safe.\n  - For rows \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) (freeways 7-8): Unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 31). At turn 31, the player is at \\(y = 1\\), not \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\), so safe.\n- At turn 39, \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nSince \\(H = 9\\) is the minimum possible (as net change of +9 requires at least 9 up moves), and the path is collision-free, this sequence is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied at turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 30\\) to \\(38\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 32, and the player is at (0,2). We want to get to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8). The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the cars move horizontally with given speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n- When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T) and at turn T+1 the player is on y' (so we check the car on freeway y' at turn T+1). However, note that the problem states: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we only care about the freeway we are currently on (y_T).\n\nTherefore, at each turn t (starting from t1=32), we are at a position (0, y_t). We choose an action a_t which leads to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, where delta is +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S). We must ensure that:\n1. At turn t (when we are at y_t), the car on freeway y_t (if y_t is between 1 and 8) does not have a span that includes 0 at time t.\n2. Additionally, if we move and change freeway, then at the next turn we will be on the new freeway and must check that at turn t+1 the car on the new freeway (if between 1 and 8) does not have 0 in its span at time t+1.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is only checked at the turn when the player is on that freeway. So if we are moving from y to y' at turn t, then:\n- At turn t: we are on y, so we check freeway y at time t.\n- At turn t+1: we are on y', so we check freeway y' at time t+1.\n\nAlso, we must not go below 0 or above 9.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9 in the minimal number of turns (H). Note that we start at y=2 and we need to get to y=9, which is 7 steps upward. However, we might have to wait (S) or even move down (D) to avoid cars.\n\nWe are given the car states at time t1=32. For each freeway k (1 to 8) we have one car? Actually, the table lists one car per freeway? But note: the table has 8 rows, one for each freeway? And each row has one car? But the problem says \"cars\" but the table shows one tuple per freeway. So I assume each freeway has exactly one car.\n\nLet me list the cars at t1=32:\n\nFreeway 1: car1 = (h=-48, tau=-59, d='right', s=12)\nFreeway 2: car2 = (h=-36, tau=-47, d='right', s=6)\nFreeway 3: car3 = (h=-36, tau=-47, d='right', s=6)\nFreeway 4: car4 = (h=-36, tau=-47, d='right', s=6)\nFreeway 5: car5 = (h=-36, tau=-47, d='right', s=6)\nFreeway 6: car6 = (h=24, tau=-11, d='right', s=36)   # note: if d='right', then the car moves to the right. But the span is given as [head, tail]? The problem says for right-moving: [tau, h]? \n\nWait, the problem states:\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12). For a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But the input is given as (head, tail) and then direction. How should we interpret?\n\nLooking at the problem: \n  For car k: (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd then for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h]? \n\nBut in freeway 1: h=-48, tau=-59, and direction='right'. So the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? Then the car is from -59 to -48? But note that the problem says for right-moving: the head is at h and tail at tau? Actually, the representation in the table is (head, tail, ...). \n\nI think the problem is consistent: \n  For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point and the tail the leftmost? Then the span is [tail, head] = [tau, h]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost? Then the span is [head, tail] = [h, tau] (which would be [leftmost, rightmost] for left-moving? but that doesn't make sense because if the car is moving left, then the head is the front which is the leftmost? and the tail is the rightmost? So the span is [h, tau] meaning from h (left) to tau (right) but then the car is moving left so the entire car is to the right of h? Actually, no: when moving left, the head (front) is at h and the tail (back) at tau, and if the car is moving left, then the head is to the left of the tail? So the span is [h, tau] but then h should be greater than tau? \n\nBut in the given data, we don't have any left-moving car. All are right-moving.\n\nSo for a right-moving car: \n  At time t1, the car spans [tau, h] (so from tau to h, and since the car moves right, the head is at h and tail at tau, and h > tau?).\n\nIn freeway1: h=-48, tau=-59 -> so h > tau? yes, -48 > -59. So the car spans from x=-59 to x=-48 at time t1=32.\n\nNow, we need to compute the position of the car at any future time T (>=32). \n\nFor a right-moving car on freeway k:\n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-32), h + s*(T-32)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving (none here) would be [h - s*(T-32), tau - s*(T-32)].\n\nWe are concerned with whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSo for freeway k, at time T, the car will cover the interval [A, B] where:\n  For right-moving: A = tau + s*(T-32), B = h + s*(T-32)\n\nThen 0 is in [A, B] if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nOur goal: starting at turn 32 at y=2, we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible without being at a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at a time T when the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at T.\n\nNote: when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (freeways are from 1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe are starting at y=2 (freeway 2) at time 32. We must check freeway 2 at time 32.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway at time 32 whether 0 is in the span? Actually, we are at time 32 at freeway 2.\n\nBut note: we start at time 32 at (0,2). So we must check freeway 2 at time 32.\n\nFreeway 2: right-moving, tau=-47, h=-36, s=6.\n  Span(32) = [tau + s*(32-32), h + s*(32-32)] = [-47, -36]\n  Is 0 in [-47, -36]? No, because -47 <= -36 < 0. So safe.\n\nNow, we plan a sequence of moves. We want to minimize the number of turns. The minimal without obstacles would be 7 moves up: U repeated 7 times. But we must check for collisions.\n\nWe must simulate the path and check at each step the freeway we are on at that time.\n\nWe are at:\n  t=32: y=2 -> safe (as above)\n\nNow, if we move up at t=32: then at t=33 we will be at y=3.\n\nAt t=32: we are on freeway 2 -> safe (as above).\nAt t=33: we are on freeway 3 -> we must check freeway 3 at time 33.\n\nFreeway 3: right-moving, tau=-47, h=-36, s=6.\n  At time 33: [ -47 + 6*(33-32) , -36 + 6*(33-32) ] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41, -30]\n  0 is not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nThen at t=33, if we move up again to y=4 at t=34.\n\nAt t=33: freeway 3 safe.\nAt t=34: freeway 4 at time 34: \n  Freeway4: same as freeway3? tau=-47, h=-36, s=6 -> [ -47+6*(34-32), -36+6*(34-32) ] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\nThen t=34: move up to y=5 at t=35.\n  Freeway4 at t=34: safe.\n  Freeway5 at t=35: same car? [ -47+6*(35-32), -36+6*(35-32) ] = [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18] -> safe.\n\nThen t=35: move up to y=6 at t=36.\n  Freeway5 at t=35: safe.\n  Freeway6 at t=36: \n      Freeway6: (h=24, tau=-11, right, s=36)\n      At time 36: [ -11 + 36*(36-32), 24 + 36*(36-32) ] = [-11 + 36*4, 24+36*4] = [-11+144, 24+144] = [133, 168] -> 0 not in [133,168] -> safe.\n\nThen t=36: move up to y=7 at t=37.\n  Freeway6 at t=36: safe.\n  Freeway7 at t=37: \n      Freeway7: (h=48, tau=1, right, s=48) -> wait, the input says (48, 1, right, 48). For right-moving, the span at t1=32 is [tau, h] = [1,48]? \n      But wait: the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So at t1=32: [1,48]. Then at time 37: \n          [1 + 48*(37-32), 48 + 48*(37-32)] = [1+48*5, 48+48*5] = [1+240, 48+240] = [241, 288] -> safe.\n\nThen t=37: move up to y=8 at t=38.\n  Freeway7 at t=37: safe.\n  Freeway8 at t=38: \n      Freeway8: same as freeway7? (48,1,right,48) -> [1+48*(38-32), 48+48*(38-32)] = [1+48*6, 48+48*6] = [1+288, 48+288] = [289, 336] -> safe.\n\nThen t=38: move up to y=9 at t=39. We are done.\n\nSo with 7 moves (all U) we get to y=9 at time 39 (starting at 32: 32 to 39 is 7 moves? Actually, from t=32 to t=39 is 7 steps? Let me count:\n\n  t=32: start at y=2\n  t=32: action U -> at t=33: y=3\n  t=33: action U -> at t=34: y=4\n  t=34: action U -> at t=35: y=5\n  t=35: action U -> at t=36: y=6\n  t=36: action U -> at t=37: y=7\n  t=37: action U -> at t=38: y=8\n  t=38: action U -> at t=39: y=9\n\nSo 7 actions (from t=32 to t=38) and we finish at t=39.\n\nBut we must check every step: we have checked the freeway at the time we are on it and found safe. However, we did not check if we can stay? But we are moving every time.\n\nBut wait: at each turn when we are at a freeway (y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8) we checked the car at that time and found safe.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway6 at time 36: \n  Freeway6: [tau + s*(36-32), h + s*(36-32)] = [-11 + 36*4, 24+36*4] = [-11+144=133, 24+144=168] -> indeed 0 not in [133,168].\n\nHowever, note that the car on freeway6 at time 32 is at [tau, h] = [-11,24]. At time 32, 0 is in [-11,24]? because -11<=0<=24 -> yes! So at time 32, if we were on freeway6, we would be collided. But we are not on freeway6 at time32. We are on freeway2 at time32, then freeway3 at time33, etc.\n\nBut wait: what about if we had to wait? In this plan we don't wait. However, we must check if at the time we are on freeway6 (which is at time36) the car has moved away? And we saw that at time36, the car is at [133,168] which is way beyond 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: at time32, freeway7: [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48]? Actually, 0 is less than 1? So 0 is not in [1,48]? Correct. But at time32, freeway7: [1,48] -> 0 is not included. Then at time37, we are on freeway7: [1+48*5=241, 48+240=288] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8? At time32: [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48]. Then at time38: [1+48*6=289, 48+288=336] -> safe.\n\nHowever, there is a potential problem: what if we had started at freeway6? But we don't.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway6 at time32: it is at [-11,24] which covers 0. So if we were to be on freeway6 at time32, we would crash. But we are not.\n\nNow, is there any time when we are on a freeway and the car is covering 0? We checked the times we are on freeways 2 to 8 at the respective times and found safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we had to wait at some point? In this plan we don't wait. However, we must ensure that the path is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at time35: we were at freeway5 at time35? Actually, we arrived at freeway5 at time35? How?\n\nAt time34: we were at freeway4 (y=4) and we moved up at time34 to freeway5 (y=5) at time35. So at time35, we are on freeway5. The car on freeway5: same as freeway2,3,4: tau=-47, h=-36, s=6. \n  At time35: [ -47 + 6*(35-32) , -36 + 6*(35-32) ] = [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 at time34: [ -47+6*(34-32) , -36+6*(34-32) ] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway1? We never step on freeway1? We start at y=2 and move up to y=3,4,... so we skip freeway1.\n\nSo the entire plan of 7 consecutive Ups seems safe.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=7 moves? Actually, we are at turn32, and we take actions at turns 32,33,...,38 (7 actions) and then at turn39 we are at (0,9). So H=7? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1. So we have actions for t1+0 to t1+6 (since H-1=6, so H=7). \n\nBut note: we are at turn32 and we take 7 actions (at turns 32 to 38) and then at turn39 we are at 9. So the number of turns we act is 7, and we reach at turn39, which is after 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence for t from 0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions? And after H actions we are at (0,9). So H=7.\n\nBut is there a possibility to do it in less? We start at y=2 and need to get to y=9: we need at least 7 moves upward. Since we cannot move more than one per turn, 7 is the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the plan is: U, U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut let me verify the freeway we are on at each time and the car positions:\n\nTime32: at y=2 -> freeway2: car at [-47, -36] -> safe.\nTime33: at y=3 -> freeway3: at time33: [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\nTime34: at y=4 -> freeway4: at time34: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\nTime35: at y=5 -> freeway5: at time35: [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\nTime36: at y=6 -> freeway6: at time36: [-11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [133,168] -> safe.\nTime37: at y=7 -> freeway7: at time37: [1+48*5, 48+48*5] = [1+240=241, 48+240=288] -> safe.\nTime38: at y=8 -> freeway8: at time38: [1+48*6, 48+48*6] = [1+288=289, 48+288=336] -> safe.\n\nThen at time39, we are at y=9 -> safe (no car).\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway1? We never step on freeway1, so we don't care.\n\nHowever, note that freeway6 at time32: the car is at [-11,24] which covers 0. But we are not on freeway6 at time32. We are on freeway2 at time32, then freeway3 at time33, etc. So we are safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at time36? We are at freeway6 at time36 and the car is at [133,168] -> safe.\n\nBut what if the car on freeway6 moves so fast that at time36 it is already beyond 0? Actually, at time36, it has moved to [133,168] which is way beyond 0. But at time32 it was at [-11,24] and it moves right at 36 per turn? So in 4 turns (from 32 to 36) it moves 36*4=144 units to the right. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and 8: they are moving at 48 per turn. So at time32, freeway7 is at [1,48]. Then at time37 (5 turns later) it moves 48*5=240, so becomes [241,288]. \n\nBut wait: what if we are a bit slower? For example, if we had to wait at some point, we might run into a car? But we don't wait.\n\nBut let me check if we are safe at the intermediate times.\n\nBut there is one more thing: what if the car on freeway5 (for example) comes back? No, they are moving continuously in one direction.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: freeway6 at time32: [ -11, 24] -> which does include 0. But we are not on freeway6 at time32. Then at time33: the car moves to [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> 0 not in. Then time34: [25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> safe. So if we had been on freeway6 at time32 we crash, but we are not.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is 7 consecutive Ups.\n\nBut note: the answer format:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nSo for t1=32:\n\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n\nAnd we are done at turn39.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of H actions. So H=7.\n\nBut let me think: is there a possibility that we can avoid freeway6 at a critical time? Actually, we don't need to avoid it because at the time we are on it (time36) it is safe.\n\nAlternatively, what if we go slower? For example, if we wait at y=5 for one turn? Then we would take more turns. So that would be worse.\n\nOr if we go down? That would also take more turns. So 7 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we take a detour? For example, go up to y=3, then down to y=2, then up? That would take more turns. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7 consecutive Ups.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway1? We never step on it, so we don't care.\n\nHowever, note that we start at y=2 and we are safe at time32. Then we move up.\n\nBut what about if we had to wait at y=2? Then we would be at y=2 at time33. We must check: at time33, freeway2: \n  [ -47 + 6*(33-32), -36+6*(33-32) ] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41, -30] -> safe. \nBut if we wait, then we are still safe? But we don't need to.\n\nSo the minimal is 7.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7. But note: we are at turn32 and we take 7 actions, then at turn39 we are at the goal. The problem does not require that we are at the goal at the same turn we take the last action? Actually, the last action (at turn38) moves us to y=9 at turn39. And we are done at turn39.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nAfter the sequence of H actions, the last state is at time t1 + H. Because:\n  Start: time t1, state y_{t1}\n  After action 0 (at t1): state at time t1+1 is y_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  After action H-1 (at time t1+H-1): state at time t1+H.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nLet me check: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo the state at time t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut in our plan:\n  At time t1 (32): y=2\n  After first action (at t32): at time33, y=3\n  After second (at t33): time34, y=4\n  After third (t34): time35, y=5\n  After fourth (t35): time36, y=6\n  After fifth (t36): time37, y=7\n  After sixth (t37): time38, y=8\n  After seventh action (at t38): time39, y=9.\n\nSo we want y_{39}=9. But the problem says we need y_{t1+H-1}=9, so t1+H-1 = 32+H-1 = 39 -> so H-1 = 7? Then H=8? \n\nWait, that doesn't match. \n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo the index: after H actions (t=0 to H-1), the state at time t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut note: the state after the action taken at time t is at time t+1.\n\nSo:\n  At time t1: we are at y_{t1}\n  We take action a_{t1} at time t1 -> then at time t1+1, we have y_{t1+1}\n  Then action a_{t1+1} at time t1+1 -> y_{t1+2}\n  ...\n  We take the last action of the sequence at time t1+H-1 -> then at time t1+H, we have y_{t1+H}\n\nBut the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThat would be the state at the time we take the last action? \n\nBut the last action is taken at time t1+H-1, and then the next state (at time t1+H) is the result of that action. \n\nBut the problem requires that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That is, at the time we take the last action, we are already at 9? \n\nBut then the last action would be taken at a state that is 9? And then the next state would be 9 (if we stay) or 10 (if we go up, but we cannot) or 8 (if we go down). \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo the sequence of actions must lead to being at 9 at time t1+H-1. \n\nThis means that the last action is taken at time t1+H-1, but that action is taken at a state that is already 9? Or we take an action that moves us to 9 at time t1+H-1? \n\nBut note the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at time t, we are at y_t, we take action a_t, then we become y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nWe require that at time t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nBut the state at time t1+H-1 is the result of the action taken at time t1+H-2? \n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have taken an action at time t1+H-2 that leads to 9 at time t1+H-1. \n\nBut then the last action we take is at time t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo the last action is at time t1+H-1. \n\nBut then the state at time t1+H-1 is the state before taking that action? \n\nThe problem says: we are to give a sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nAnd then the requirement is: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut at time t1+H-1, we take action a_{t1+H-1} and then the state becomes y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo the last action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at a state that is 9. \n\nThen the next state y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta, which must be between 0 and 9. \n\nBut we don't care about what happens after we reach 9? The problem only requires that at some turn (namely t1+H-1) we are at 9. \n\nSo we can stop at that turn? \n\nBut note: we are at 9 at time t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that time? But what action? It doesn't matter as long as we are at 9 at that time. \n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions. And at time t1+H-1, we are at 9, which is safe (no car). Then we take an action at that time? But we are already at the goal. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we must specify an action for the last turn. \n\nBut we are at 9 at time t1+H-1, then we can choose any action? But we must not leave 9? Because if we go up, we go to 10 which is invalid. So we must choose S (stay) or D (down to 8) but then we leave the goal. \n\nThe requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. It doesn't say we have to stay there. But if we leave, then we are not at 9 anymore. \n\nBut the condition is only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nBut if we take an action that moves us away at the same turn, then we are not at 9 at the next turn. But the condition is only for the turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we can choose any action at the last turn? However, if we choose U, then we go to 10 which is invalid? The update requires y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we cannot choose U at 9. Similarly, D would take us to 8. \n\nBut if we choose D, then at time t1+H-1 we are at 9 (so we meet the goal condition at that turn) but then at time t1+H we are at 8. That might be acceptable? But the problem only requires to reach 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". It doesn't say we have to stay. \n\nHowever, typically we want to stay? But the problem does not specify. \n\nBut note: the collision condition: at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, which is safe. Then we take an action. After that, we are at 8 at time t1+H? Then we are on freeway8? And we must avoid collision? \n\nThe problem says: we must avoid collisions during the entire sequence? \n\nThe problem states: \"avoiding collisions with cars ...\". So during the entire sequence of turns from t1 to t1+H-1? Or until we have reached? \n\nActually, we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, safe. Then we take an action at that turn. But the collision condition is checked at the turn we are on a freeway. At turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 (safe). Then after taking the action, at the next turn (t1+H) we are at 8? Then we are on freeway8 at time t1+H? But the problem does not require that we avoid collisions after the goal is reached? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions ...\". The avoiding collisions applies to the entire sequence of actions? Meaning for every turn in which we are at a freeway (1..8) during the period from t1 to the time we are at 9? \n\nBut note: we are at 9 at time t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn. The state at time t1+H-1 is 9 (safe). Then the action taken at time t1+H-1 moves us to 8 at time t1+H. At time t1+H, we are at freeway8? And we must avoid collision? But we are not required to be safe after we have reached the goal? \n\nThe problem does not specify. But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. After that, we don't care? \n\nBut the avoiding collision condition is stated for the game, so probably we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway (1..8) during the entire sequence of actions, including the last action? \n\nAt the turn we are at 9 (time t1+H-1), we are safe. Then we take an action. The next state (time t1+H) is at y=8? Then we are on freeway8 at time t1+H? And we must avoid collision at time t1+H? But we don't care about the state after we have reached the goal? \n\nThe problem is ambiguous. \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. It does not say we must remain there. \n\nHowever, the avoiding collision condition is for the entire path during the actions? \n\nTo be safe, we should not cause a collision at any time we are on a freeway during the entire sequence of H actions. \n\nBut the sequence of actions covers turns t1 to t1+H-1. The states we are in are from time t1 (before first action) to time t1+H (after last action). \n\nBut the collision condition is checked at the time we are on the freeway: \n  At time t (for t from t1 to t1+H-1) we are at state y_t, and then we take action a_t. But the collision condition at time t is for the freeway y_t at time t. \n\nAfter the last action (at time t1+H-1), we move to y_{t1+H}. Then at time t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}, and if y_{t1+H} is between 1 and 8, we must avoid collision at time t1+H? \n\nBut the problem does not require that? The problem only says \"avoiding collisions with cars\" during the game, but the game is defined until we reach the goal? \n\nTo avoid ambiguity, let me read the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nAnd the turn T is any turn during the game. \n\nSo if at any turn T (from t1 to ...) we are on a freeway and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at time T, we collide. \n\nTherefore, we must avoid collision at every turn we are on a freeway, even after we have reached the goal? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then after that, we are still playing? \n\nThe problem says: we are to find a sequence of actions to reach (0,9). It doesn't say we stop. But the sequence is defined for H actions. \n\nSo after the H-th action, we are at time t1+H. And if at time t1+H we are on a freeway, we must avoid collision at that time. \n\nIn our plan, if we take an action at time t1+H-1 (the last action) that moves us to 8 at time t1+H, then we are on freeway8 at time t1+H, and we must check the car on freeway8 at time t1+H. \n\nBut we don't want to cause a collision at time t1+H. \n\nTherefore, at the last action, if we are at 9, we should not move down? We should stay? \n\nSo to be safe, at the last turn (when we are at 9) we should choose S (stay) so that at the next turn we are still at 9 (safe). \n\nBut then we are at 9 at time t1+H-1? How did we get there? \n\nWe must have gotten to 9 at time t1+H-1 by an action taken at time t1+H-2? \n\nThen the last action (at time t1+H-1) is S, so we stay at 9 at time t1+H. \n\nBut we don't care about time t1+H as long as we are at 9 at time t1+H-1? And the problem doesn't say we have to stop the game. \n\nBut to avoid a collision at time t1+H, we can choose to stay at 9. \n\nSo let me redefine our plan: we want to be at 9 at time t1+? \n\nWe start at time32: y=2.\n\nWe want to be at 9 at time t1+H-1 = 32+H-1.\n\nWe need to get from y=2 at time32 to y=9 at time 32+H-1.\n\nThe number of steps is (32+H-1 - 32) = H-1 turns? But we have H actions? \n\nThe state at time t1 is y0 = 2.\n\nAfter 1 action (at time t1): state at time t1+1 = y1.\n...\nAfter k actions: state at time t1+k.\n\nWe want state at time t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo we need to go from y=2 at time32 to y=9 at time 32+H-1.\n\nThe number of time steps from 32 to 32+H-1 is (H-1) steps.\n\nIn each step, we can change y by -1,0, or +1.\n\nThe minimal number of upward moves is 7. And we can do it in 7 upward moves, which would take 7 steps? \n\nFrom time32 to time32+7: \n  At time32: y=2\n  After 7 steps (at time32+7): we would be at y=2+7=9.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at time32+H-1 = 32+7 => H-1=7 => H=8.\n\nBut then we would have 8 actions? \n\nBut we only need 7 upward moves? \n\nHow? \n\nWe start at time32: y=2.\nWe take action at time32: move up -> time33: y=3\n...\nAt time38: we are at y=8 (after 6 moves: 2+6=8) -> then at time38 we take the 7th up move -> then at time39: y=9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at time t1+H-1 = 32+H-1.\n\nSet 32+H-1 = 39 => H-1=7 => H=8.\n\nSo we need 8 actions? And the last action (the 8th) is taken at time32+7=39? But then the state at time39 is the result of the action at time39? And we require the state at time39 (which is time32+7) to be 9? \n\nBut at time39, we are at 9 only if we were at 9 at time39 and we stay? Or if we were at 8 at time39 and we move up? \n\nBut the state at time39 is the state after the action taken at time38? \n\nTo have y_{39}=9, we must have been at y38 and taken an action that moves to 9.\n\nSo if we are at 8 at time38, we take U at time38 to be at 9 at time39.\n\nThen we are at 9 at time39.\n\nBut then we require that at time t1+H-1 = 32+H-1 = 39, we are at 9. So 32+H-1=39 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nAnd the last action is at time39? But the actions are at times 32 to 32+7 (which is 39)? \n\nBut then we have to specify an action for time39. But at time39, we are at 9. Then we can choose S.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Time32: U (to go to 3 at time33)\n  Time33: U\n  Time34: U\n  Time35: U\n  Time36: U\n  Time37: U\n  Time38: U  -> then at time39: we are at 9.\n  Then at time39: we take action S (to stay at 9).\n\nBut then we are at 9 at time39 and also at time40 we are at 9. \n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at time39 (which is t1+7, and H=8, so t1+H-1=32+8-1=39). \n\nSo we have reached at time39.\n\nAnd the action at time39 is S, which is safe.\n\nBut do we need to take that S? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must take 8 actions. The last action is at time39, and we are at 9 at time39 (before taking the action) and we take S to remain.\n\nBut we could also take any other action? But we cannot take U. D would move us to 8 at time40, which would then require collision check at freeway8 at time40? But the problem only requires up to time39 we are at 9. However, we must avoid collision at every turn we are on a freeway during the entire sequence, including time40 if we are on a freeway then.\n\nTo be safe, we take S at the last step.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8? But we took 7 Ups and then one S. But we could have taken 7 Ups and then at time39 we are at 9, and then we take S. But the 7 Ups are taken at times32 to 38, and then at time39 we take S.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? \n\nWe require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{32+7-1}=y_{38}=9.\n\nSo we need to be at 9 at time38.\n\nHow? \n  Start at time32: y=2.\n  We have 6 steps (time32 to time37) to get to 9? \n  We need to cover 7 units in 6 steps? That means we must move up at least 7 times, but we only have 6 actions? \n\nThe net displacement must be +7. Each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0. \n  Let u be number of U, d be number of D, s be number of S. Then u - d = 7, and u+d+s=6.\n  Then 2u + s = 13 -> u = 6.5? Not integer. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, H=8 is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: we might be able to get there in 7 steps? No, because we need 7 net up moves and we have only 6 actions to get from time32 to time38 (which is 6 steps: 32->33, 33->34, 34->35, 35->36, 36->37, 37->38). \n\nThe state at time38 is the result of 6 actions. \n\nStart: time32: y0=2.\nAfter action0 (at time32): time33: y1 = y0 + a0\n...\nAfter action5 (at time37): time38: y6 = y5 + a5.\n\nWe require y6=9.\n\nSo 2 + (number of U - number of D) in 6 actions = 9.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S. Then u-d = 7, and u+d+s=6.\n\nThen u-d=7, u+d<=6? Impossible because u>=7, d>=0, then u+d>=7>6.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be at 9 at time38.\n\nThe minimal H is 8, with the state at time39=9.\n\nAnd we can do it with 7 Ups and then one S (at the last step).\n\nBut we can also do it with 7 Ups: the last up at time38 moves us to 9 at time39, and then at time39 we take S to stay.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at every step.\n\nWe already checked the path from time32 to time38: we are at y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at times32,33,34,35,36,37,38 respectively, and we checked that at each of these times, the car on the corresponding freeway does not cover 0.\n\nNow, at time39, we are at y=9 (safe) and we take action S. Then at time40, we are still at 9 (safe). So no collision.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\nTurn39: S\n\nBut the last action is at time39, and we are at 9 at time39 (which is t1+7, and H=8 so t1+H-1=32+8-1=39) -> satisfied.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 8 actions without the extra S? For example, if we wait at some point, then we might need to move up later. But we don't want to.\n\nAlternatively, we could have a sequence that gets to 9 at time39 with 7 Ups and then one S, which is what we have.\n\nBut note: we could have waited at some freeway and then moved, but that would take more than 7 up moves? Or the same.\n\nBut we already have a plan with 8 actions: 7U and 1S.\n\nBut is there a plan with 8 actions that gets to 9 earlier? No, because we need at least 7 up moves and we start at 2.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, we must confirm that the entire path is safe.\n\nWe have checked times32 to 38 for freeways 2 to 8. But what about the last action? At time39, we are at y=9 (safe) and we take S. Then we are at y=9 at time40, but we don't care about collision at time40 because the sequence only requires avoiding collision during the turns we are on freeways 1-8 and during the turns of the actions? \n\nSpecifically, we must check collision at every turn T from 32 to 39 (inclusive) for the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nAt time39, we are on freeway9? No, y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So at time39, we are at y=9 -> no car, so safe.\n\nTherefore, we only care about times32 to 38.\n\nWe have already checked:\n\nTime32: y=2 -> freeway2: car at [-47, -36] -> safe.\nTime33: y=3 -> freeway3: car at [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\nTime34: y=4 -> freeway4: car at [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\nTime35: y=5 -> freeway5: car at [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\nTime36: y=6 -> freeway6: car at [-11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [133,168] -> safe. [because 36-32=4]\nTime37: y=7 -> freeway7: car at [1+48*5, 48+48*5] = [241,288] -> safe. [37-32=5]\nTime38: y=8 -> freeway8: car at [1+48*6, 48+48*6] = [289,336] -> safe. [38-32=6]\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: S\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and t1=32. The sequence is for t1 to t1+H-1 = 32 to 32+7=39.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: S\n}\n\nBut let me double-check freeway6 at time36: \n  Time36: 36-32=4, so freeway6: [ -11 + 36*4, 24 + 36*4 ] = [-11+144, 24+144] = [133,168] -> correct.\n\nFreeway7 at time37: [1+48*5, 48+48*5] = [1+240,48+240]=[241,288] -> correct.\n\nFreeway8 at time38: [1+48*6,48+48*6]=[1+288,48+288]=[289,336] -> correct.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway1? We never step on it, so it doesn't matter.\n\nHowever, note that freeway6 at time32: [ -11, 24] -> includes 0, but we are not on freeway6 at time32.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 32\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn 34 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up, D for down, S for stay. The position is updated based on the action, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given the head and tail at turn t1=34, direction, and speed. I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nA collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the interval where the car occupies, and it moves left or right based on direction.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at T+1 you're on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, we care about the freeway y_T that you're on at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, and we check for cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the cars:\n\nAll cars are given at turn t1=34.\n\nLet me list them clearly:\n\nFreeway k=1: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed s=12\n\nSince direction is right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let me see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state table, for k=1, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nBut for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? head and tail might be confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for left: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the input, for k=1: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, dir right.\n\nSince dir is right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nYes, because τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span is from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is left, tail is right.\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think? Let's check.\n\nk=1: right, s=12\n\nk=2: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nk=3: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nk=4: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nk=5: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nk=6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nk=7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nk=8: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nAll are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars? No, from the table, it seems one car per freeway, since it says \"Cars\" but lists one tuple per row, so I think one car per freeway.\n\nThe header says \"Cars (head, tail, dir, speed)\" and only one per line, so yes, one car per freeway for k=1 to 8.\n\nFreeway y=1 to 8, each has one car.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn t1=34.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, I think, since y=0 to 9, so y=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, minimal turns H, meaning minimal number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, and actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need to specify actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nNow, the sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}, and after that, at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on action.\n\nSo if we start at y=4, to reach y=9, we need to go up 5 units, but we can also go down or stay, but since we want minimal turns, probably we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nEach action can change y by -1,0,+1, so to increase y by 5, minimal actions would be 5 up moves, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nBut we need to minimize H.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied, i.e., if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nSince collision happens only if at turn T, y_T = k, and for freeway k, 0 in Span(T).\n\nAnd we need to ensure that for the turns we are on each freeway, it's not occupied.\n\nNow, let t1 = 34.\n\nFor a future turn T, let ΔT = T - 34.\n\nFor each freeway, compute the span at T.\n\nStart with k=1: dir right, s=12, τ=-35, h=-24 at T=34.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s*ΔT, h + s*ΔT] = [-35 + 12*ΔT, -24 + 12*ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12ΔT\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince the car moves right, the span is shifting right.\n\n0 in span when the left end <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nSo for k=1:\n\n-35 + 12ΔT <= 0 and -24 + 12ΔT >= 0\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/12 = 2.916, so ΔT <= 2 since integer? ΔT is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and ΔT are integers, I assume, since turns.\n\nIn the update, T > t1, integer.\n\nSo ΔT >=0 integer.\n\nk=1:\n\n-35 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <= 2\n\n-24 + 12ΔT >= 0 => 12ΔT >= 24 => ΔT >= 2\n\nSo both: ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only at ΔT=2, i.e., T=34+2=36\n\nAt T=36, -35 + 12*2 = -35+24= -11 <=0, and -24+24=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nΔT=1: left= -35+12= -23 <=0, right= -24+12= -12 <0, so 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nΔT=2: [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=3: left= -35+36=1 >0, right= -24+36=12>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only at T=36, occupied for k=1.\n\nNow k=2: similarly, (-24,-35,right,6) same as k=1 but speed 6.\n\nτ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -35 +6ΔT <=0 and -24 +6ΔT >=0\n\nFirst: 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\nSecond: 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT=4,5\n\nT=34+4=38 and T=34+5=39\n\nCheck:\n\nΔT=4: left= -35+24= -11 <=0, right= -24+24=0 >=0, so 0 in span at T=38\n\nΔT=5: left= -35+30= -5 <=0, right= -24+30=6 >=0, yes\n\nΔT=3: left= -35+18= -17 <=0, right= -24+18= -6 <0, no\n\nΔT=6: left= -35+36=1>0, no\n\nSo k=2 occupied at T=38 and 39.\n\nk=3: same as k=2, (-24,-35,right,6), so same, occupied at T=38,39.\n\nk=4: same, T=38,39\n\nk=5: same, T=38,39\n\nNow k=6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nτ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [-83 +36ΔT, -48 +36ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -83 +36ΔT <=0 and -48 +36ΔT >=0\n\nFirst: 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 36ΔT >=48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2\n\nΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2, T=36\n\nAt T=36: left= -83+72= -11 <=0, right= -48+72=24 >=0, yes.\n\nΔT=1: left= -83+36= -47 <=0, right= -48+36= -12 <0, no\n\nΔT=2: as above\n\nΔT=3: left= -83+108=25>0, no\n\nSo k=6 occupied only at T=36.\n\nNow k=7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nτ=-95, h=-48, s=48\n\nSpan: [-95 +48ΔT, -48 +48ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -95 +48ΔT <=0 and -48 +48ΔT >=0\n\nFirst: 48ΔT <=95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond: 48ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo ΔT=1, T=35\n\nAt T=35: left= -95+48= -47 <=0, right= -48+48=0 >=0, yes.\n\nΔT=0: T=34, span [-95,-48], 0 not in\n\nΔT=2: left= -95+96=1>0, no\n\nSo k=7 occupied at T=35.\n\nk=8: same as k=7, (-48,-95,right,48), so occupied at T=35.\n\nSummarize for each freeway, times when occupied at x=0:\n\nk=1: T=36\n\nk=2: T=38,39\n\nk=3: T=38,39\n\nk=4: T=38,39\n\nk=5: T=38,39\n\nk=6: T=36\n\nk=7: T=35\n\nk=8: T=35\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at T=34.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 is freeway k=4? y is the vertical position, freeway y=1 to 8 correspond to positions.\n\nPlayer position (x=0, y), with y from 0 to 9.\n\nFreeways are at y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=k, and k between 1 and 8, we check if freeway k is occupied at T.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nThe collision is only for y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nStart at T=34, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and y=9 is 5 up, minimal 5 up moves, but we might need to avoid being on certain freeways at certain times.\n\nFirst, let's list for each possible y and T, whether it is safe to be there.\n\nBut y from 1 to 8, and T from 34 onwards.\n\nSince we care about the path, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, note that at T=34, player is on y=4.\n\nIs y=4 occupied at T=34?\n\nFreeway k=4, car at T=34.\n\nFor k=4: at T=34, ΔT=0, span: since dir right, τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, span at T=34: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-35, -24], which is [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways at T=34: since ΔT=0, for k=1: [-35,-24], 0 not in; k=2: same; k=3: same; k=4: same; k=5: same; k=6: [-83,-48], 0 not; k=7: [-95,-48], 0 not; k=8: same. So all safe at T=34.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no car.\n\nThe dangerous times are when freeways are occupied.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- k=1 occupied at T=36\n\n- k=2 occupied at T=38,39\n\n- k=3 occupied at T=38,39? k=3 is same as k=2, T=38,39\n\nk=3: car same as k=2, so yes T=38,39\n\nk=4 same, T=38,39\n\nk=5 same, T=38,39\n\nk=6 occupied at T=36\n\nk=7 occupied at T=35\n\nk=8 occupied at T=35\n\nFor other times, freeways are safe.\n\nPlayer starts at T=34, y=4.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we want minimal time, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nFor example, at T=35, k=7 and k=8 are occupied, so if player is on y=7 or y=8 at T=35, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=36, k=1 and k=6 occupied, so avoid y=1 or y=6 at T=36.\n\nAt T=38 and 39, k=2,3,4,5 occupied, so avoid y=2,3,4,5 at T=38 and 39.\n\nk=2,3,4,5 all occupied at T=38 and 39.\n\nNow, player at T=34, y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nThe critical points are around T=35,36,38,39.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should try to reach y=9 quickly without hitting the occupied times.\n\nOne idea: since at T=35, y=7 and y=8 are dangerous, we should not be on them at T=35.\n\nSimilarly, at T=36, y=1 and y=6 are dangerous.\n\nAt T=38-39, y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous.\n\nNow, from T=34, we can take action to change y.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nStart: T=34, y=4\n\nNow, action at T=34: a_{34}, determines y_{35}\n\nSimilarly, a_{35} determines y_{36}, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we start at y=4, the minimal actions to increase y by 5 is 5 U moves, but we may need to wait or detour.\n\nBut detour down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nWe can stay in place or move down to avoid being at certain y at certain T.\n\nBut moving down might increase H.\n\nSince the occupied times are specific, we can try to be above or below during those times.\n\nFor example, at T=35, we should not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSince we start at y=4 at T=34, possible actions:\n\nIf we go U at T=34, then y_{35} = 5\n\nIf D, y_{35}=3\n\nIf S, y_{35}=4\n\nSimilarly for next.\n\nNow, T=35 is dangerous for y=7 and 8, but y=5,6,etc. are safe at T=35 except for k=7 and k=8, which are y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt T=35, only k=7 and k=8 occupied, so y=1 to 6 and y=9 should be safe? y=1 to 8 are freeways, but only if occupied.\n\nAt T=35, k=7 and k=8 occupied, so if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\ny=1 to 6 should be safe at T=35, since not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nk=1 at T=35: for k=1, we have occupied only at T=36, not at T=35.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo at T=35, safe for y=1,2,3,4,5,6,9, not safe for y=7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=36, k=1 and k=6 occupied, so not safe for y=1 and y=6, safe for others.\n\nAt T=37: are there any occupied? From above, k=1 only at 36, k=6 only at 36, k=7 only at 35, k=8 only at 35, k=2-5 only at 38,39.\n\nSo at T=37, no freeway occupied, all y=1 to 8 safe? Let me confirm.\n\nk=1: occupied only T=36\n\nk=2: T=38,39\n\nk=3: same\n\n...\n\nk=6: T=36\n\nk=7: T=35\n\nk=8: T=35\n\nSo at T=37, all freeways are safe, since no occupation.\n\nSimilarly, T=34 safe, T=35: only y=7,8 unsafe\n\nT=36: y=1,6 unsafe\n\nT=37: all safe\n\nT=38: k=2,3,4,5 occupied, so y=2,3,4,5 unsafe at T=38\n\nT=39: same, y=2,3,4,5 unsafe\n\nT=40: no occupation, all safe? k=2-5 occupied only T=38,39, so after that, no.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nPlayer at T=34, y=4.\n\nWe want to go up to y=9.\n\nOne minimal way: go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nStart T=34, y=4\n\nAction a34: suppose U, then y35 = 5\n\nAt T=35, y=5, which is safe, since only y=7,8 unsafe.\n\nThen a35: U, y36=6\n\nBut at T=36, y=6 is unsafe! Because k=6 occupied at T=36.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf a35: S, y36=5, then at T=36, y=5, is it safe? T=36, only y=1 and y=6 unsafe, y=5 is safe, since k=5 occupied only at T=38,39.\n\nk=5 at T=36: ΔT=2, for k=5, s=6, τ=-35,h=-24, span at T=36: ΔT=2, [-35+12, -24+12]? ΔT=T-34, T=36, ΔT=2.\n\nFor k=5: span at T: [-35 +6*ΔT, -24 +6*ΔT]\n\nΔT=2: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=36 safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=35, if we go S, y36=5, safe, but not up.\n\nThen at T=36, position y=5, we can go U to y=6, but at T=36, y=6 is unsafe.\n\na36: if U, y37=6, but at turn T=36, we are on y=5, and we take action to go to y=6, so at T=36, we are on y=5, which is safe, and we move to y=6 at T=37.\n\nAt T=36, y_T = y36 = position during turn T=36.\n\nAfter action at T=36, y_{37} changes.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and we check collision based on y_T and freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThen we choose action to set y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, at T=35, if y=5, safe.\n\nThen a35: if U, then y36 = 6.\n\nBut at T=36, y=6, and k=6 occupied, so collision.\n\nIf a35: S, then y36=5, at T=36, y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=36, we can do a36: U, then y37=6.\n\nNow at T=37, y=6, is it safe? T=37, no occupation, so safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at T=37.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=34, if we go U to y=5 at T=35, then S to y=5 at T=36, then U to y=6 at T=37.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9 from y=6.\n\ny=6 to y=9, need +3, so three U moves.\n\nBut at T=38 and 39, y=2,3,4,5 are unsafe, but y=6,7,8,9 should be safe? At T=38, k=2,3,4,5 occupied, so y=2,3,4,5 unsafe, but y=6,7,8 should be safe, since k=6 only at T=36, not at 38.\n\nSimilarly k=7 only at T=35.\n\nSo y=6 at T=38 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7,8 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo from T=37, y=6, we can go U to y=7 at T=38.\n\nAt T=38, y=7: is it safe? k=7 occupied only at T=35, not at 38, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=8 at T=39, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=40.\n\nBut at T=39, y=8, is it safe? k=8 occupied only at T=35, not at 39, so yes.\n\nThen y=9 at T=40.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nStart T=34, y=4\n\na34: U → y35=5 (at T=35, y=5 safe)\n\na35: S → y36=5 (at T=36, y=5 safe, not 6)\n\na36: U → y37=6 (T=37, y=6 safe)\n\na37: U → y38=7 (T=38, y=7 safe, since k=7 not occupied)\n\na38: U → y39=8 (T=39, y=8 safe)\n\na39: U → y40=9\n\nSo at T=40, y=9.\n\nH=6 actions: from t=34 to 39, 6 actions, reach at T=40.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started with U, then S, then U,U,U,U.\n\nTotal actions: 5 U and one S, so H=6.\n\nBut minimal possible is 5, with all U.\n\nCan we do it in 5?\n\nAll U: a34 U: y35=5\n\na35 U: y36=6 but at T=36, y=6 collision, impossible.\n\na34 S: y35=4\n\nThen a35 U: y36=5\n\nThen a36 U: y37=6\n\nThen a37 U: y38=7\n\na38 U: y39=8\n\na39 U: y40=9, same as above, but we have an extra S at beginning.\n\nWith a34 S, we have y35=4 at T=35, which is safe.\n\nThen a35 U: y36=5 at T=36, safe.\n\na36 U: y37=6\n\na37 U: y38=7\n\na38 U: y39=8\n\na39 U: y40=9\n\nStill H=6 actions.\n\na34 D: y35=3\n\nThen we are lower, need more moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo with the S at T=35, we avoided being on y=6 at T=36.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had a35 S, which is at T=35 action, setting y36.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are at each turn.\n\nIn the first plan: actions at T=34: U, T=35: S, T=36: U, T=37: U, T=38: U, T=39: U. So 6 actions.\n\nCan we go faster?\n\nSuppose we go up at T=34 to y=5.\n\nThen at T=35, instead of S, we go D? But that would be worse.\n\nOr, can we be at y=6 at a different time?\n\nAt T=36, y=6 is unsafe, but at other times safe.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=6 at T=36.\n\nSimilarly, for other points.\n\nSince at T=38 and 39, y=2-5 are unsafe, but we are going up, so we might be above.\n\nIn the above, we were at y=7 at T=38, which is above.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately but skip the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, from T=34 y=4, go U to y=5 at T=35.\n\nThen at T=35, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=6 at T=36 which is bad, we can go to y=7 at T=36? But to go to y=7 at T=36, we need to be at y=6 at T=35, but at T=35, y=6 is safe? At T=35, only y=7 and 8 unsafe, so y=6 is safe.\n\nT=35: y=1 to 6 safe, y=7 and 8 unsafe.\n\nSo at T=35, we can be at y=6.\n\nFrom T=35 y=5, if we go U, y36=6, but then at T=36 y=6 collision.\n\nIf we go U at T=35 to y=6, but y36=6 at T=36 collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=35, we can go S to y=5 at T=36, as before.\n\nOr go D to y=4 at T=36, but then we are lower.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=35, y=7 and 8 are unsafe, but if we can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nBut from y=4, to y=9, need at least 5 steps.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=35,36,38,39.\n\nT=37 is safe for all.\n\nSo perhaps we can aim to be at y=9 by T=37 or earlier.\n\nBut T=34: y=4\n\nIf we go U at T=34: y35=5\n\nThen to go to y=9 at T=37, we need y37=9.\n\nFrom y35=5 to y37=9, that requires two moves: but each move changes y by at most 1, so from y=5 at T=35, after two actions, at T=37, y could be at most 7, if UU, y37=7.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by T=37 from there.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=9 at T=36: from y=4 at T=34, after two actions: a34 and a35, y36 = y34 + Δy34 + Δy35.\n\ny36 <= 4 +1 +1 =6 <9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at T=37: y37 = y34 + Δy34 + Δy35 + Δy36\n\nMax 4+1+1+1=7 <9, still less.\n\nT=38: y38 <=4+1+1+1+1=8<9? 4 to 5,6,7,8 in four moves? T=34 to T=38: actions at T=34,35,36,37, y38.\n\ny38 = y34 + sum_{t=34 to37} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y38 <=4 +4=8.\n\nStill less than 9.\n\ny=9 requires y38=9, which needs +5 from start, but from T=34 to T=38, there are 4 actions: a34 to a37, so y38 = y34 + Δy34 + Δy35 + Δy36 + Δy37\n\nSo max increase 4, to y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 5 actions, since from y=4 to y=9, delta=5.\n\nWith 5 actions, y_{t1+5} = y34 + sum_{t=34 to 38} Δy_t? Let's see indices.\n\nAt turn T, after action at T, y_{T+1}.\n\nStart T=34, y34=4.\n\nAfter action a34, y35 set.\n\nAfter a35, y36, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} position.\n\nWe want y_{34+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions: a34 to a34+H-1.\n\ny_{34+H} = y34 + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{34+k}\n\nSince y34=4, to have y_{34+H}=9, need sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{34+k} =5.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so H >=5.\n\nMinimal H=5 is possible only if all actions U.\n\nBut with all U, y35=5, y36=6, but at T=36, y=6 collision, as before.\n\nMoreover, at T=36, we are on y=6 when k=6 occupied.\n\nSo impossible with all U.\n\nNow, can we have all U but avoid T=36?\n\nFor example, if we start later, but we start at T=34.\n\nPerhaps with some S or D, but with H=5, if we have one S, then sum Δy <=4, so y_{34+5} <=4+4=8<9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if one D, sum <=3, worse.\n\nSo for H=5, we must have all five actions U, to have sum=5.\n\nBut with all U: a34 U: y35=5\n\na35 U: y36=6\n\na36 U: y37=7\n\na37 U: y38=8\n\na38 U: y39=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=35: y=5, which is safe, as before.\n\nAt T=36: y=6, but k=6 occupied at T=36, collision! Not possible.\n\nAt T=37: y=7, safe.\n\nT=38: y=8, safe? k=8 occupied only at T=35, not 38, so safe.\n\nT=39: y=9, safe.\n\nBut T=36 has collision.\n\nSo impossible with H=5.\n\nTherefore minimal H must be at least 6.\n\nWith H=6, we can reach y=9 at T=40, as in the first sequence.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had a S at T=35, so we reached later.\n\nCan we reach at T=39 with H=6?\n\ny_{34+6} = y40.\n\nWith H=6 actions, we can reach y=9 at T=40.\n\nBut can we reach earlier? T=39 is y_{39}, which requires 5 actions, but we saw H=5 impossible.\n\ny_{39} is after 5 actions: a34 to a38, y39.\n\nWith 5 actions, y39 <=8, as above, cannot be 9.\n\ny39 = y34 + Δy34 + Δy35 + Δy36 + Δy37\n\nMax 4+4=8 if all U, but y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need y_{T} for T>=39? y39=9 requires after 5 actions, but sum Δy <=5, but with positions.\n\nFrom y34=4, after k actions, y_{34+k} <=4+k.\n\nSet equal to 9, so 4+k=9, k=5, so y_{39} <=4+5=9 only if all U, but as above, with all U, y39=9? Sequence: a34 U: y35=5, a35 U: y36=6, a36 U: y37=7, a37 U: y38=8, a38 U: y39=9. Yes, y39=9 with 5 actions, but at T=36 y=6 collision.\n\nSo the issue is the collision, not the position.\n\nBut with H=5, we must pass through y=6 at T=36 if going up fast, which is bad.\n\nPerhaps a different path with H=6 but reach at T=40, but with fewer delays.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had to wait at y=5 for one turn to avoid y=6 at T=36.\n\nBut at T=38 and 39, y=2-5 are unsafe, but since we are going up, we can be above y=5.\n\nIn the sequence above, we were at y=7 at T=38, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do better.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=6 before T=36.\n\nFor example, at T=34, go U to y=5.\n\nAt T=35, since y=6 is safe at T=35, we can go U to y=6? But if we go U at T=35, y36=6, which is at T=36, collision.\n\nBut at T=35, when we are at y=5, if we go U, we set y36=6, so during turn T=35, we are on y=5, taking action to move to y=6.\n\nAt T=35, position is y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen after action, at T=36, we are on y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=6 at T=36.\n\nTo be at y=6 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at T=35, we can be on y=6, but only if we arrive at T=35.\n\nFrom start, T=34 y=4.\n\nIf we go U to y=5 at T=35? a34 U: y35=5.\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=35, we need y35=6.\n\nBut y35 is set by action at T=34, which can only increase by 1, so y35 <=5, cannot be 6 at T=35.\n\nSimilarly, at T=34, y=4, cannot be higher.\n\nSo the only times we can be at y=6 are T=36 or later.\n\nBut at T=36, it is occupied, so we cannot be on y=6 at all? No, at other times it is safe.\n\nFor example, at T=35, y=6 is possible? From above, y35 <=5, so cannot be at y=6 at T=35.\n\ny35: after one action from y34=4, so y35=3,4, or5.\n\nSo y=6 can only be reached at T=36 or later.\n\nAt T=36, it is unsafe.\n\nAt T=37, it is safe, as in the earlier sequence.\n\nSimilarly, for other points.\n\nSo we must avoid being on y=6 at T=36, which we did by not moving to y=6 at that turn.\n\nNow, back to the sequence with H=6.\n\nIn that sequence, we have actions: U, S, U, U, U, U for t=34 to 39.\n\nBut at T=38 and T=39, we are on y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\nBut at T=38, y=7, freeway k=7, is it occupied? k=7 occupied only at T=35, not at T=38, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, we have one S action, which costs an extra turn.\n\nBut since H=5 impossible, H=6 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach without the S.\n\nFor example, go down first or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nSuppose at T=34, go S: y35=4\n\nThen a35 U: y36=5\n\na36 U: y37=6\n\nNow at T=37, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a37 U: y38=7\n\na38 U: y39=8\n\na39 U: y40=9\n\nSame as before, but we started with S instead of U, so at T=35 we are at y=4 instead of y=5.\n\nBut still 6 actions to reach at T=40.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, same turn.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we were at y=5 at T=35, here at y=4.\n\nBut both take same number of actions.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier? For example, at T=39, but y39=9 requires 5 U moves, but with collision at T=36 if we go directly.\n\nUnless we skip y=6 or something, but we have to pass through intermediate y.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=7 or 8 before T=35.\n\nBut at T=34, we can only reach y=5 at T=35.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps stay low until after the dangerous times.\n\nBut the dangerous times are T=35,36,38,39.\n\nT=37 is safe.\n\nFor example, at T=34 y=4, go D to y=3 at T=35.\n\nThen at T=35, y=3, safe.\n\nBut we are lower.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut at T=38 and 39, y=2-5 unsafe, so we need to be above y=5 or below y=2 after that.\n\nSince we want to go to y=9, better to be above.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at T=35, go U to y=4 at T=36.\n\nBut at T=36, y=4, is it safe? T=36, only y=1 and y=6 unsafe, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen a36 U to y=5 at T=37.\n\na37 U to y=6 at T=38.\n\nBut at T=38, y=6, is it safe? T=38, y=2,3,4,5 unsafe, but y=6 is safe, since k=6 not occupied.\n\nThen a38 U to y=7 at T=39.\n\na39 U to y=8? We need to go to y=9.\n\ny at T=39 is 7? Sequence:\n\nT=35: y=3 (after a34 D)\n\na35: U, y36=4\n\na36: U, y37=5\n\na37: U, y38=6\n\na38: U, y39=7\n\na39: U, y40=8? Not 9.\n\ny40=8, not 9.\n\nWe need one more U to y41=9.\n\nBut that would be 7 actions: a34 to a40, y41=9.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nFrom above, at T=37 y=5, go U to y=6 at T=38, then U to y=7 at T=39, U to y=8 at T=40, U to y=9 at T=41, still 7 actions.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence with 6 actions is better.\n\nIn the first sequence, we reached y=9 at T=40 with 6 actions.\n\nNow, but in that sequence, at T=38 and T=39, we are on y=7 and y=8, which are fine.\n\nBut there is another issue: at T=38, y=7, but k=7 is freeway, and at T=38, is it occupied? No, as per above.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence I had: U at 34, S at 35, U at 36, U at 37, U at 38, U at 39.\n\ny: T=34:4, T=35:5 (after U), T=36:5 (after S), T=37:6 (after U), T=38:7 (after U), T=39:8 (after U), T=40:9 (after U).\n\nAt T=36, y=5, safe.\n\nT=37, y=6, safe.\n\nT=38, y=7, safe.\n\nT=39, y=8, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nCan we avoid the S and reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up twice quickly but to a different y.\n\nFor example, at T=34, go U to y=5.\n\nThen at T=35, go U to y=6, but that sets y36=6, which at T=36 collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=35, go D to y=4, but then at T=36 y=4, which is safe, but we lost progress.\n\nThen need more moves.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one S action.\n\nBut we need to output the actions starting from t1=34.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn 34: a_{34} = U\n\nTurn 35: a_{35} = S\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = U\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = U\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = U\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U\n\nAfter a39, y40=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=34 to t=39, 6 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions briefly.\n\nFor example, at T=36, we were not on y=6, so no issue.\n\nAt T=38, y=7: freeway k=7, car at T=38: ΔT=4, τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48*4, -48 + 48*4] = [-95+192, -48+192] = [97,144], which is way right, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the beginning, at T=35, we are on y=5, k=5: at T=35, ΔT=1, span [-35 +6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with no S, but H=6 still.\n\nFor example, go up, then down, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at T=34, U to y=5.\n\nT=35, D to y=4? But then at T=36 y=4, safe, but then we need to go up from y=4.\n\na36 U to y=5, a37 U to y=6, but at T=37 y=6 safe, then a38 U to y=7, a39 U to y=8, then need a40 U to y=9, so 7 actions: U,D,U,U,U,U? Let's list:\n\na34 U: y35=5\n\na35 D: y36=4\n\na36 U: y37=5\n\na37 U: y38=6\n\na38 U: y39=7\n\na39 U: y40=8\n\na40 U: y41=9, H=7, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence with one S is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we used S at T=35.\n\nBut we could use S at another time, but this seems efficient.\n\nAnother point: at T=38 and 39, y=2-5 are unsafe, but since we are above, no issue.\n\nIn our path, we are at y=5 at T=36, which is before T=38, so safe.\n\nThen we go to y=6 at T=37, safe, etc.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from turn t1=34.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nHere t1=34, H=6, so actions at turn 34 to 39.\n\nAnd the player reaches (0,9) at turn 40.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a way with H=6 but reach at T=39? But y39=9 requires 5 U, but with H=6 actions, if we have an extra move, we can reach earlier, but y_{39} can be at most 9 only if we start from lower, but we start from y=4, so with actions, to reach y=9 at T=39, we need exactly 5 U and no S or D, which forces the collision.\n\nIf we have S or D, y39<9.\n\nSo cannot reach at T=39.\n\nEarliest is T=40 with H=6.\n\nPerhaps with different path.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 is safe, we could go down to y=0 and wait, but that would take more turns to come back.\n\nFor example, at T=34, go D to y=3, then to y=2, etc., but then to go up to y=9, need more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence above is minimal.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on k=6.\n\nk=6 occupied at T=36, we avoided y=6 at that time.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to higher y faster, but not possible.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn 34 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\nThe occupancy at x=0 for each freeway is determined based on the car positions and movements. The turns when x=0 is occupied (i.e., 0 is in the car's span) are:\n- Freeway 1: Occupied at turn 36.\n- Freeway 2: Occupied at turns 38 and 39.\n- Freeway 3: Occupied at turns 38 and 39.\n- Freeway 4: Occupied at turns 38 and 39.\n- Freeway 5: Occupied at turns 38 and 39.\n- Freeway 6: Occupied at turn 36.\n- Freeway 7: Occupied at turn 35.\n- Freeway 8: Occupied at turn 35.\n\nAt other turns, all freeways are safe.\n\n### Player Movement and Collision Avoidance\n- The player must move from y=4 to y=9, requiring a net increase of 5 units. The minimal number of actions without obstacles is 5 (all \"U\" moves), but this is impossible due to collisions at turn 36 if moving directly upward.\n- At turn 35, freeways 7 and 8 are occupied, so y=7 or y=8 must be avoided.\n- At turn 36, freeways 1 and 6 are occupied, so y=1 or y=6 must be avoided.\n- At turns 38 and 39, freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied, so y=2, y=3, y=4, or y=5 must be avoided.\n\nA sequence of actions must be found to reach y=9 quickly while avoiding these occupied positions at critical turns. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 6, with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 40.\n\n### Optimal Sequence\n- **Turn 34 (start)**: Player at y=4. Action \"U\" moves to y=5 at turn 35. This is safe since y=5 is not occupied at turn 35.\n- **Turn 35**: Player at y=5. Action \"S\" keeps y=5 at turn 36. This avoids moving to y=6 at turn 36 (which is occupied) and y=5 is safe at turn 36.\n- **Turn 36**: Player at y=5. Action \"U\" moves to y=6 at turn 37. Turn 37 has no occupancy issues, so y=6 is safe.\n- **Turn 37**: Player at y=6. Action \"U\" moves to y=7 at turn 38. y=7 is safe at turn 38 since freeway 7 is only occupied at turn 35.\n- **Turn 38**: Player at y=7. Action \"U\" moves to y=8 at turn 39. y=8 is safe at turn 39 since freeway 8 is only occupied at turn 35.\n- **Turn 39**: Player at y=8. Action \"U\" moves to y=9 at turn 40, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence has \\(H = 6\\) actions and avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 35: y=5 is safe (freeway 5 not occupied).\n- At turn 36: y=5 is safe (freeway 5 not occupied).\n- At turn 37: y=6 is safe (freeway 6 not occupied).\n- At turn 38: y=7 is safe (freeway 7 not occupied).\n- At turn 39: y=8 is safe (freeway 8 not occupied).\n\nNo sequence with \\(H < 6\\) is possible, as \\(H=5\\) would require all \"U\" actions but causes a collision at turn 36 (y=6 occupied).\n\n### Answer\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 6, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: S \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) at turn 36 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, given head, tail, direction, and speed, I can compute where it will be at any future turn. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the car's span includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=36. Player starts at y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I need to go up 4 levels, from 5 to 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on y=1 to 8. Since I'm starting at y=5, and going up, I might need to go through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=1 to 8 have cars, but I'm at y=5 now, and I need to be on y=9, which has no cars since freeways are only y=1 to 8. y=9 is the top, no freeway, I think it's safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there. But to get there, I have to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so at each turn, you're at x=0, y_t.\n\nWhen you're on a freeway y, at turn T, if there's a car on that freeway whose span includes x=0 at turn T, you collide.\n\nSince you move vertically, you're always at x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when cars are at x=0.\n\nLet me list the car states at turn t=36.\n\nFor each freeway k, cars are given with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, span moves left, so head decreases.\n\nThe notation:\n\nFor left-moving: head and tail, and span is [h, τ] or [τ, h]? It says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but if it's left-moving, and head is, I think head is the front, so for left-moving, front is smaller x? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nWhat is head and tail? I think head is the front of the car.\n\nFor right-moving, front is at larger x, so if direction is right, head should be the right end, tail left end.\n\nSimilarly for left, head left end, tail right end.\n\nBut in the span definition:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so h is the left end, since it decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and moves to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so head should be the right end, tail left end.\n\nBut it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSince right-moving, head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nAt t=36, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0], since τ is left, h is right.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] = [-11 + 12(T-36), 0 + 12(T-36)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for freeway y, if there is a car on that freeway with 0 in span(T).\n\nThat is, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, car span includes 0 if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars are present and when x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, (head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12)\n\nAt t=36, span: left = tail = -11, right = head = 0? No.\n\nAs above: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] = [-11 + 12(T-36), 0 + 12(T-36)]\n\nLet Δt = T - 36\n\nSo span = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\nx=0 is in span if -11 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 12 Δt\n\nSince 12 Δt >=0 for Δt>=0, so 0 <= 12 Δt always true for Δt >=0.\n\nAnd -11 + 12 Δt <= 0 ⇒ 12 Δt <= 11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/12 < 1\n\nSince Δt integer (turns), Δt =0 only? Δt <= 11/12 <1, so Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=36, span = [-11, 0], so 0 is included? -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is the right end.\n\nAt T=36, span is [-11,0], so x=0 is included, since it's the right end.\n\nBut at turn T=36, if player is on freeway 1, collision occurs.\n\nBut player is at y=5 at t=36, and freeway 1 is y=1, so if player is on y=1, collision.\n\nBut currently player is on y=5, not on y=1.\n\nFor future turns.\n\nx=0 in span when -11 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 12 Δt\n\n0 <= 12 Δt always for Δt >=0\n\n-11 + 12 Δt <= 0 ⇒ 12 Δt <= 11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/12 <1\n\nSo only at Δt=0, which is T=36.\n\nFor T>36, Δt>=1, -11 +12Δt >= -11+12=1 >0, so span is [1,12] at Δt=1, which is 1 to 12, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly for higher Δt, span moves right, so x=0 not covered for T>36.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car is at x=0 only at T=36. After that, it's gone.\n\nBut since player is not on y=1 now, and we're going up, we might not go to y=1.\n\nNext, freeway 2: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so tail = -23, head = -12? Given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nSince right-moving, head should be right end, tail left end.\n\nSo at t=36, span [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 6 Δt, -12 + 6 Δt]\n\nx=0 in span if -23 +6Δt <= 0 <= -12 +6Δt\n\nNow, 0 <= -12 +6Δt ⇒ 6Δt >=12 ⇒ Δt >=2\n\nAnd -23 +6Δt <= 0 ⇒ 6Δt <=23 ⇒ Δt <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so Δt <=3 since integer.\n\nSo for Δt=2,3\n\nAt Δt=2, span = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0? 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nAt Δt=3, span = [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nAt Δt=4, span = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 1>0, not include 0.\n\nSo at T=36+2=38 and T=36+3=39, car on freeway 2 at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-12, -23, right, 6) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 6), same as 2.\n\nSo same times, T=38 and 39.\n\nFreeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 6), again same.\n\nFreeway 5: (-12, -23, right, 6), same.\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car? Or different cars but same state.\n\nBut each freeway has its own car, I think.\n\nIn the table, it's listed separately, so each has a car with same properties.\n\nSo for each of y=2,3,4,5, car at x=0 at T=38 and 39.\n\nFreeway 6: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\n( head, tail, dir, speed) = (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nRight-moving, so head=24 (right), tail=-11 (left)\n\nAt t=36, span [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt T, span [ -11 + 36 Δt, 24 + 36 Δt ]\n\nx=0 in span if -11 +36Δt <= 0 <= 24 +36Δt\n\nNow, 0 <= 24 +36Δt always true for Δt>=0\n\n-11 +36Δt <=0 ⇒ 36Δt <=11 ⇒ Δt <= 11/36 <1, so only Δt=0 possible? But at Δt=0, span [-11,24], -11<=0<=24 true, so at T=36.\n\nFor Δt>=1, -11+36Δt >= -11+36=25>0, so not <=0, so x=0 not in span.\n\nOnly at T=36.\n\nBut player not on y=6 now.\n\nFreeway 7: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\n( head, tail, dir, speed) = (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nRight-moving, head=48 right, tail=1 left? Tail=1, which is positive.\n\nAt t=36, span [τ, h] = [1, 48]\n\nAt T, span [1 + 48 Δt, 48 + 48 Δt]\n\nx=0 in span if 1 +48Δt <= 0 <= 48+48Δt\n\nBut 1 +48Δt >=1 >0 for Δt>=0, so left end >=1 >0, so 0 not in span, ever, since min is at least 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (48, 1, right, 48) same as 7, so never at x=0.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: car at x=0 only at T=36\n\n- y=2: car at x=0 at T=38,39\n\n- y=3: same, T=38,39\n\n- y=4: same, T=38,39\n\n- y=5: same, T=38,39\n\n- y=6: car at x=0 at T=36\n\n- y=7: never\n\n- y=8: never\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at T=36.\n\nAt T=36, if player is on y=5, is there a car?\n\ny=5 has car at x=0 only at T=38 and 39, not at T=36. At T=36, for y=5, car is at? Freeway 5 car: at T=36, Δt=0, span [-23, -12] for y=5? No.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 2,3,4.\n\nAt T=36, Δt=0, span [-23,-12], which is from x=-23 to -12, not including 0. So at T=36, no car at x=0 on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: at T=36, car at x=0? Freeway 6: at T=36, span [-11,24], includes 0, yes.\n\nBut player is on y=5 at T=36.\n\nNow, player needs to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut to reach y=9, player must be on y=8 at some point, then move up to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=5, need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 have potential cars.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have no cars at x=0 ever, as per above. y=7 and y=8 cars never at x=0, so always safe.\n\ny=6 has car only at T=36, which is past.\n\ny=1 to 5 have cars at certain times, but since we start at y=5 and go up, we might not go down.\n\nPlayer can move down or up or stay.\n\nBut to minimize turns, probably go up directly.\n\nBut need to avoid collisions.\n\nCurrent y=5 at t=36.\n\ny=5 has car at x=0 at T=38 and 39.\n\nSo if player is on y=5 at turn T=38 or T=39, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,3,2 also have cars at T=38,39, but we're not going there.\n\ny=6 has car only at T=36, not after, so safe after T=36.\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nSo the only danger is on y=5 at T=38 and 39.\n\nPlayer needs to not be on y=5 at those times.\n\nSince we start at y=5 at t=36, we need to move away before T=38.\n\nT=38 is two turns from now? t=36,37,38,...\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k and car on k at x=0, collision.\n\nFor y=5, dangerous at T=38 and 39.\n\nSo player must not be on y=5 at turn 38 or 39.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have dangers but not relevant if we go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, from y=5, minimum moves: need to increase y by 4, so at least 4 up moves.\n\nBut can have stay or down moves, but that would increase H, so probably not minimal.\n\nMinimal H should be 4, if we go up up up up in 4 turns.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=5 at T=38 or 39.\n\nT=38 is turn 38, which is 2 turns after 36: from t=36 to t=38 is two steps? Let's see the turns.\n\nTurn numbers: current turn t=36.\n\nAt turn t=36, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_{36}, at turn t=37, y_{37} = y_{36} + Δy_{36}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t=38, y_{38} = y_{37} + Δy_{37}, and so on.\n\nThe turn when we check collision is at the beginning of the turn, I think, based on position.\n\nFrom the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, based on y_T, we check if on that freeway, car span includes x=0.\n\nNow, for T=38 and T=39, if y_T = 5, collision.\n\nT=38 is 2 turns after t=36: t=36,37,38, so T=38 is the turn after next.\n\nSimilarly, T=39 is three turns after.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at t=36, y=5.\n\nWe can do actions to move up.\n\nBut if we go up immediately, let's see.\n\nOption 1: Go up at t=36, to y=6 at t=37.\n\nAt t=36: we are at y=5. Action: if we do U, then y_{37} = y_{36} +1 =6\n\nBut at turn t=36, we are on y=5. Is there collision? At t=36, on y=5: car on y=5 at t=36? As above, at t=36, y=5 car span is [-23,-12] for Δt=0, which is -23 to -12, not include 0, so no collision at t=36.\n\nThen after action U, at t=37, y=6.\n\nAt t=37, on y=6: is there car at x=0? y=6 car: at T=37, Δt=37-36=1, span for y=6: earlier, freeway 6: span at T: [-11 +36 Δt, 24 +36 Δt]\n\nAt Δt=1, T=37, span = [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], which is 25 to 60, 0 not included, so safe.\n\nThen at t=37, we can do U again to y=7 at t=38.\n\nAction at t=37: U, then y_{38} = y_{37} +1 =6+1=7\n\nAt t=38, y=7.\n\ny=7: no car ever at x=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=38, action U to y=8 at t=39.\n\ny_{39} =7+1=8\n\nAt t=39, y=8: safe, no car.\n\nThen at t=39, action U to y=9 at t=40.\n\ny_{40} =8+1=9\n\nAt t=40, y=9: not a freeway, no collision, and we reached (0,9).\n\nNow, H=4 turns? From t=36 to t=39 actions, to reach at t=40.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\n- Turn t=36: at y=5, action a_{36}. If U, then to y=6 at t=37.\n\n- Turn t=37: at y=6, action a_{37}, if U, to y=7 at t=38.\n\n- Turn t=38: at y=7, action a_{38}, if U, to y=8 at t=39.\n\n- Turn t=39: at y=8, action a_{39}, if U, to y=9 at t=40.\n\nAt t=40, position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=36 to t=39, that's 4 actions: a_{36} to a_{39}.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think, the minimal H such that after H actions, we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from t=36 to t=36+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=36+H, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it says sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=36, so actions at t=36, t=37, ..., up to t=36+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=36+H, position should be y=9.\n\nIn this case, if we start actions at t=36, after 4 actions: at t=40, y=9.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nAt t=36: position y=5, no car at x=0, as span [-23,-12] not contain 0.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt t=37: position y=6, car span [25,60] not contain 0, safe. Action U.\n\nAt t=38: position y=7, no car at x=0 ever, safe. Action U.\n\nAt t=39: position y=8, no car at x=0, safe. Action U.\n\nAt t=40: position y=9, not freeway, no collision.\n\nWe reached at t=40.\n\nBut is y=5 safe at t=37 or other times? At t=37, we are at y=6, not y=5.\n\nThe dangerous times for y=5 are t=38 and t=39.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=38 and t=39, we are at y=7 and y=8, not on y=5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nBut what about t=36 for y=6? At t=36, y=6 has car at x=0, but we are not on y=6 at t=36; we are on y=5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIn this sequence, we used all U, reached in 4 turns.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster? H=4 seems minimal since we need to go up 4 steps.\n\nCan we reach in 3 turns? That would require moving up faster, but we can only move +1 per turn, so from y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 moves: to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter 3 actions, we could be at y=8, for example, but not at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we need to be at y=9 at time t=36+H.\n\nWith H=3, at t=39, position y_{39} = y_{36} + Δy_{36} + Δy_{37} + Δy_{38}, each Δy <=1, so max y=5+3=8, less than 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, H=4 is minimum.\n\nIn the above, with all U, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFor y=5, dangerous at t=38 and t=39.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=38, we are at y=7, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly at t=39, at y=8.\n\nNow, what if we stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nPerhaps go down, but that would be worse.\n\nSo H=4 with all U actions should work.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nt1=36.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nThen at t=37, y=6\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nt=38, y=7\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nt=39, y=8\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nt=40, y=9\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=36 to t=39.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = U\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = U\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = U\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut is there any issue with the car on y=6 at t=36?\n\nAt t=36, we are not on y=6, we are on y=5.\n\nAt t=37, when we are on y=6, car is at [25,60], no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can be faster, but we can't.\n\nMaybe we can reach at an earlier time, but t=40 is the earliest possible.\n\nStart at t=36 y=5, after one move t=37 y=6, after two t=38 y=7, after three t=39 y=8, after four t=40 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at t=40.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 6, at t=36, car is present, but we avoid it by not being there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): car at x=0 when?\n\nAs earlier, for y=5: car with span at T: [-23 +6 Δt, -12 +6 Δt]\n\nSet -23 +6Δt <=0 <= -12 +6Δt\n\n0 <= -12 +6Δt ⇒ Δt >=2\n\n-23 +6Δt <=0 ⇒ Δt <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so Δt=2,3\n\nT=36+2=38, 36+3=39\n\nYes.\n\nAt t=36, Δt=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=37, Δt=1, span [-23+6= -17, -12+6= -6], -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt t=38, Δt=2, span [-23+12= -11, -12+12=0], -11 to 0, includes 0.\n\nAt t=39, Δt=3, span [-23+18= -5, -12+18=6], -5 to 6, includes 0.\n\nAt t=40, Δt=4, span [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], 1 to 12, not include 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nIn our sequence, we are not on y=5 at t=38 or 39.\n\nAt t=37, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, car span at T: [-11 +36 Δt, 24 +36 Δt]\n\nAt t=36, Δt=0, [-11,24], includes 0.\n\nAt t=37, Δt=1, [-11+36=25, 24+36=60], 25-60, not include 0.\n\nAt t=38, Δt=2, [-11+72=61, 24+72=96], etc., no.\n\nSo only dangerous at t=36.\n\nWe avoid by being on y=6 only at t=37, when safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 no issue.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4 with actions U,U,U,U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe initial position is (0,5) at turn 36.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t depending on action.\n\nIn the sequence above, it works.\n\nPerhaps we can do it with H=4 but different actions, but U,U,U,U is fine.\n\nTo be thorough, suppose we stay at t=36, then y=5 at t=37.\n\nAt t=37, on y=5: car span? At t=37, Δt=1 for y=5 car, span [-17,-6], not include 0, so safe.\n\nThen at t=37, we can go to y=6 at t=38.\n\nBut at t=38, if we go to y=6, but at t=38, position y=6? Let's see.\n\nIf at t=36, action S (stay), then y_{37} = y_{36} + 0 =5\n\nAt t=37, position y=5, action U, then y_{38} =5+1=6\n\nAt t=38, position y=6.\n\nNow at t=38, on y=6: car span at T=38, Δt=38-36=2, span [-11+72=61, 24+72=96], not include 0, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=7 at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, y=7, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=8 at t=40? At t=39, action U, y_{40} =7+1=8? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt t=39, y=7, action U, then y_{40} =8\n\nThen at t=40, y=8, action U to y=9 at t=41.\n\nBut now we reached at t=41, with H=5 actions? Worse.\n\nAfter staying at t=36, at t=37 y=5, then U to y=6 at t=38.\n\nThen at t=38, on y=6, safe, then U to y=7 at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, y=7, U to y=8 at t=40.\n\nAt t=40, y=8, U to y=9 at t=41.\n\nSo at t=41, y=9, with 5 actions from t=36 to t=40.\n\nH=5, larger than 4.\n\nIf we go down, even worse.\n\nSo the direct up is best.\n\nIn the first sequence, with all U, we use 4 actions to reach at t=40.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, for t=36 to t=39.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the collision rule again.\n\nAnother point: when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until next turn.\n\nIn our case, when we move from y to y+1 at turn T, we are at y at turn T, and move to y+1 at T+1.\n\nFor example, at t=36, we are on y=5, action U, then at t=37 we are on y=6.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSuppose at t=38, if we were on y=5, but we are not.\n\nIn our sequence, we avoid the dangerous times.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, at t=39, dangerous, but we are on y=8 at that time.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the car on freeway 6 at t=36 is at x=0, but since we are not on y=6, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=4 with all U.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be boxed with the actions.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = U\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = U\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = U\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1 is 36.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H is 4.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer, it seems only the sequence is boxed, but H should be mentioned.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\"\n\nAnd it says \"determine H\", but in the box, only actions.\n\nProbably H is implied by the sequence length.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so the number of lines gives H.\n\nIn the box, we list the turns and actions.\n\nSo for this, with 4 turns.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4 but different? I think not.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier if we start from different position, but we start at y=5.\n\nAnother thing: y=9 is the target, and it's safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=39 we are at y=8, then move to y=9 at t=40.\n\nCould we be at y=9 earlier? No, because from y=5, min 4 steps.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per turn.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1, for example, but it was only at t=36, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, all covered.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4, with the sequence U,U,U,U for turns 36 to 39.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn text, but since it's a box, probably formatted.\n\nIn the response, I can write it as such.\n\nSince it says \"put your answer in boxed\", I think this is it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we do something else.\n\nFor example, if we go up at t=36 to y=6 at t=37.\n\nThen at t=37, instead of up, we stay or down, but that would delay reaching y=9.\n\nFor instance, if at t=37, we stay, then y=6 at t=38.\n\nAt t=38, on y=6, safe, as car not at x=0.\n\nThen go to y=7 at t=39, etc., but then we reach later.\n\nSimilarly, worse.\n\nIf we go down to y=4 at some point, but y=4 has cars at t=38,39, so if we go to y=4 at t=37, for example.\n\nAt t=36, action D, then y_{37}=4.\n\nAt t=37, on y=4: car on y=4 at t=37? Similar to y=5, at t=37, Δt=1, span for y=4 car: same as others, [-23+6= -17, -12+6= -6], not include 0, so safe.\n\nThen at t=37, action U to y=5 at t=38.\n\nBut at t=38, on y=5, which is dangerous! Car at x=0, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=5 at t=38.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, we might hit the dangerous time.\n\nSo better to go up directly.\n\nThus, the sequence is optimal.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 36 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeway 1**: Car at \\(x=0\\) only at turn 36. Not hazardous after turn 36.\n- **Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5**: Cars at \\(x=0\\) at turns 38 and 39. Hazardous at these times.\n- **Freeway 6**: Car at \\(x=0\\) only at turn 36. Not hazardous after turn 36.\n- **Freeways 7 and 8**: No car at \\(x=0\\) at any turn. Always safe.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y=5\\) at turn 36. The hazardous times for \\(y=5\\) are turns 38 and 39, so the player must not be on \\(y=5\\) at these turns.\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y=9\\)\n- From \\(y=5\\) to \\(y=9\\), a minimum of 4 upward moves (U actions) are required, as each move increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- A sequence of four U actions starting from turn 36 achieves this:\n  - Turn 36: U → \\(y=6\\) at turn 37\n  - Turn 37: U → \\(y=7\\) at turn 38\n  - Turn 38: U → \\(y=8\\) at turn 39\n  - Turn 39: U → \\(y=9\\) at turn 40\n\n### Collision Check\n- **Turn 36**: Player at \\(y=5\\). Car on \\(y=5\\) at turn 36 has span \\([-23, -12]\\), which does not include \\(x=0\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 37**: Player at \\(y=6\\). Car on \\(y=6\\) at turn 37 has span \\([25, 60]\\), which does not include \\(x=0\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 38**: Player at \\(y=7\\). Freeway 7 has no car at \\(x=0\\) ever. Safe.\n- **Turn 39**: Player at \\(y=8\\). Freeway 8 has no car at \\(x=0\\) ever. Safe.\n- **Turn 40**: Player at \\(y=9\\), which is not a freeway. No collision possible. Goal reached.\n\nThis sequence avoids all hazardous times:\n- At turns 38 and 39, the player is on \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\), not on \\(y=5\\), so no collision with cars on freeways 2-5.\n- The car on freeway 6 at turn 36 is avoided as the player is on \\(y=5\\) then.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\)\n- \\(H = 4\\) is minimal, as fewer turns (e.g., \\(H=3\\)) cannot reach \\(y=9\\) from \\(y=5\\) due to the maximum \\(\\Delta y = +1\\) per turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions is \\(U, U, U, U\\) for turns 36 to 39.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: & U \\end{array} }",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n- At turn T, the player is on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T for collision).\n- At the next turn (T+1), the player will be on y' (so we check the car on freeway y' at turn T+1).\n\nThus, we are only concerned with the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=39. For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\nFor a right-moving car (d='right'):\n  At turn t1: the car spans from tail to head, meaning [tail, head] (with tail < head, because it's moving right).\n  At turn T: the car is at [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nFor a left-moving car (d='left'):\n  At turn t1: the car spans from head to tail? But note the example: left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  However, in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have any left-moving.\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving: the head is the front? So for left-moving, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rule for left-moving is:\n  Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nGiven:\nFreeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) -> at t1=39: the car is at [37, 48] (since tail=37, head=48, and right-moving: so tail is the left end, head is the right end). \n  Actually, the problem says for right-moving: at t1: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway1 at t1=39: \n  tail = 37, head = 48, so the car covers [37, 48] at turn 39.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is at turn T, the player is at (0, k) and the car on freeway k at turn T must have 0 in its span.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each future turn T (>=39) the span of the car on that freeway.\n\nHowever, note that the cars are moving at constant speed. Also, note that the car on a freeway is fixed? Actually, each freeway has one car? From the table, each row is a freeway (from 1 to 8) and each has one car.\n\nSo for freeway k, we have a car defined by (h, tau, d, s). All are right-moving.\n\nSo the car on freeway k at turn T (>=39) is at:\n  [tau + s*(T-39), h + s*(T-39)]\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(T-39), h + s*(T-39)].\n\nBut note: the interval is [tail + s*(T-39), head + s*(T-39)] and since tail < head (because right-moving) and s>0, the interval is increasing.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 39. We are at freeway 0 (but freeways are from 1 to 8, so at turn 39 we are at y=0 -> not on any freeway? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to y=8. So at y=0, we are safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal and also safe.\n\nWe need to move from y=0 to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn. So minimum moves would be 9 moves (if we go up every turn: 0->1->2->...->9). But we must avoid the freeways when a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe can consider a BFS (breadth-first search) over the states: (turn, y). The turn starts at 39 and we are at y=0.\n\nBut note: the state space in time might be large because the cars are moving and the collision condition is time-dependent. However, note that the cars move linearly and we are only concerned with when the car covers x=0. Moreover, the cars are moving at constant speed and we can compute the exact times when the car covers x=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T>=39 whether the car on freeway k at turn T covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the player can stay at a freeway for multiple turns? We must avoid every turn we are on a freeway (1-8) and the car is covering 0.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway k, the time intervals (in turns) when the car is covering x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, the car covers x=0 at turn T if:\n   tau + s*(T-39) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-39)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  T_min = ceil( ( -h + 39*s ) / s ) ? Actually:\n\n  We have:\n      tau + s*(T-39) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-39)\n\n  => \n      T >= ( -tau ) / s + 39   [from the left inequality: tau + s*(T-39) <= 0 -> T <= ( -tau ) / s + 39? Wait, no]\n\n  Actually:\n\n      tau + s*(T-39) <= 0   =>   s*(T-39) <= -tau   => \n        if s>0: T-39 <= -tau/s   => T <= 39 - tau/s\n\n      and \n      0 <= h + s*(T-39)   =>   s*(T-39) >= -h   => T-39 >= -h/s   => T >= 39 - h/s\n\n  But note: since the car is moving right, and tail (tau) is less than head (h), then the condition for 0 being in the interval is:\n\n      tau + s*(T-39) <= 0   and   0 <= h + s*(T-39)   ?\n\n  Actually, the interval is [tau + s*(T-39), h + s*(T-39)] and 0 is in the interval if:\n\n      tau + s*(T-39) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-39)\n\n  But note: because the car is moving right, the entire interval is moving to the right. Also, since tau < h, we have:\n\n      The condition becomes: \n          tau + s*(T-39) <= 0   and   h + s*(T-39) >= 0\n\n  => \n      T <= ( -tau ) / s + 39   and   T >= ( -h ) / s + 39\n\n  But note: if we rearrange:\n\n      From the first: T <= 39 - tau/s\n      From the second: T >= 39 - h/s\n\n  Since h > tau, then 39 - h/s < 39 - tau/s, so the interval is [39 - h/s, 39 - tau/s]. However, we must note that T must be an integer (turn) and the inequalities are inclusive.\n\n  But wait: let me check with an example.\n\n  Freeway1: tau=37, h=48, s=12.\n\n  Then the interval for T: \n      T >= 39 - 48/12 = 39 - 4 = 35\n      T <= 39 - 37/12 = 39 - 3.083... = 35.916...\n\n  So T must be an integer such that 35 <= T <= 35? Because 35.916... -> T=35? But let me check:\n\n  At T=35: \n      car position: [37 + 12*(35-39), 48 + 12*(35-39)] = [37 - 48, 48 - 48] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because 0 is between -11 and 0? But note: the interval is [-11,0] -> so 0 is included.\n\n  At T=36: \n      [37 + 12*(36-39) = 37 - 36 = 1, 48 - 36 = 12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  Actually, the condition at T=35: the car covers from -11 to 0 -> so 0 is included. At T=36: from 1 to 12 -> 0 not included.\n\n  So the interval is only T=35? But we are starting at T=39, so T=35 is in the past? We are only concerned with T>=39.\n\n  Therefore, for freeway1, at T>=39, the car never covers 0? Because the last time it covered 0 was T=35.\n\n  Similarly, we can compute for other freeways.\n\n  But note: the condition we derived: T must be in [39 - h/s, 39 - tau/s]. Since h and tau are positive in freeway1? Actually, freeway1: h=48, tau=37, positive. Then 39 - h/s = 35, and 39 - tau/s = 39 - 37/12 = 35.916... -> so only T=35 and T=36? Actually, T=35 is the only integer? But at T=35: included, T=36: not included? \n\n  Actually, at T=35: [37 + 12*(35-39) = 37 - 48 = -11, 48-48=0] -> 0 is included (at the right edge). \n  At T=36: [37 + 12*(36-39)=37-36=1, 48-36=12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So for freeway1, the car covers 0 only at T=35? Then at T>=39, it's safe.\n\n  But wait: what if the car is behind and moving right? For example, freeway2: (-48, -59, right, 6). \n\n  Note: the head is -48 and tail is -59? But for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? Here, -48 > -59. So the car is from -59 to -48? \n\n  At turn T: [ -59 + 6*(T-39), -48 + 6*(T-39) ]\n\n  We want 0 to be in that interval:\n\n      -59 + 6*(T-39) <= 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-39)\n\n  => \n      T-39 >= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> T >= 39 + 9.833 = 48.833 -> so T>=49\n      and \n      T-39 <= 48/6 = 8 -> T <= 39+8 = 47\n\n  But 49 > 47 -> no solution? So the car never covers 0? \n\n  Let me check: at T=39: the car is at [-59, -48] -> not covering 0.\n  As T increases, the car moves right: at T=47: [ -59 + 6*8 = -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> so 0 is included? (at the right edge) -> so T=47: 0 is included? \n\n  Actually, at T=47: \n      tail + s*(T-39) = -59 + 6*(8) = -59+48 = -11\n      head + s*(T-39) = -48 + 48 = 0\n      so the interval is [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\n  So why did we get T>=49 and T<=47? \n\n  Let me recast the inequalities:\n\n      -59 + 6*(T-39) <= 0   => 6*(T-39) <= 59 -> T-39 <= 59/6 ≈9.833 -> T<=39+9.833=48.833 -> so T<=48 (if integer) because T is integer? Actually, we have to be careful: the inequality is <=, so T-39 <= 59/6 -> T<= floor(59/6)+39? \n\n  Actually, we have:\n\n      -59 + 6*(T-39) <= 0   => T-39 <= 59/6 -> T <= 39 + 59/6 = 39+9+5/6 = 48+5/6 -> so T<=48 (if we take integer, then T<=48? But 48.833 -> T can be 48? Then at T=48: \n          tail: -59 + 6*(9) = -59+54 = -5\n          head: -48+54=6\n          so the interval is [-5,6] -> 0 is included.\n\n      and \n      0 <= -48 + 6*(T-39)  => 48 <= 6*(T-39)  => T-39 >= 8 -> T>=47.\n\n  So the condition is T>=47 and T<=48? Actually, T>=47 and T<=48.833? But the second inequality is T<=48.833, so for integers T=47,48.\n\n  At T=47: \n        tail: -59 + 6*(47-39)= -59 + 6*8 = -59+48 = -11\n        head: -48+48=0 -> so [ -11, 0] -> includes 0.\n  At T=48:\n        tail: -59 + 6*9 = -59+54=-5\n        head: -48+54=6 -> so [ -5,6] -> includes 0.\n\n  So the car on freeway2 covers 0 at T=47 and T=48.\n\n  But we start at T=39, so T=47 and 48 are in the future.\n\n  Therefore, we must avoid freeway2 at turns 47 and 48.\n\n  Similarly, we can compute for every freeway.\n\n  Let me do for freeway3: same as freeway2? (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as freeway2: so it also covers 0 at T=47,48.\n\n  Freeway4: same -> T=47,48.\n\n  Freeway5: same -> T=47,48.\n\n  Freeway6: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n      Condition: \n        tail: -83 + 36*(T-39) <= 0 -> 36*(T-39) <= 83 -> T-39 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T<=41.305 -> T<=41\n        head: -48 + 36*(T-39) >=0 -> 36*(T-39)>=48 -> T-39>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 -> T>=40.333 -> T>=41 (since integer, T>=41)\n\n      So T must be in [41,41]? because 41<=41.305? So T=41.\n\n      At T=41: \n          tail: -83 + 36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n          head: -48+72=24 -> so [ -11,24] -> includes 0.\n\n      So freeway6: only at T=41.\n\n  Freeway7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n      Condition:\n        tail: -95 + 48*(T-39) <=0 -> 48*(T-39)<=95 -> T-39<=95/48≈1.979 -> T<=40.979 -> T<=40\n        head: -48+48*(T-39)>=0 -> 48*(T-39)>=48 -> T-39>=1 -> T>=40\n      So T=40.\n\n      At T=40: \n          tail: -95+48*1 = -47 -> but wait: T-39=1 -> 48*1=48 -> tail=-95+48=-47, head=-48+48=0 -> so [-47,0] -> 0 included.\n\n  Freeway8: same as freeway7: so T=40.\n\n  Summary of dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\n    Freeway1: no danger (only at T=35, which is before 39)\n    Freeway2: T=47,48\n    Freeway3: T=47,48\n    Freeway4: T=47,48\n    Freeway5: T=47,48\n    Freeway6: T=41\n    Freeway7: T=40\n    Freeway8: T=40\n\n  Therefore, we must avoid:\n\n    freeway6 at turn 41\n    freeway7 and 8 at turn 40\n    freeway2,3,4,5 at turns 47 and 48.\n\n  Now, the player starts at turn 39 at y=0.\n\n  We want to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\n  The minimal number of moves is 9 (if we go up every turn: 9 moves, so from turn39 to turn48: 9 turns? Actually, at turn39 we are at y0, then we take 9 actions: at turn39 (action0), turn40 (action1), ... turn48 (action9) and then at the end of turn48 we are at y9.\n\n  But note: we are at turn39: we start at (0,0) at turn39. Then we take an action at turn39 to move to turn40. So:\n\n      Turn39: we are at y0 -> we take action a39 -> then at turn40 we are at y1 = y0 + delta.\n\n  We need to be at y9 at the end of some turn. Let the last action be at turn T, then at turn T+1 we are at y9? Actually, the sequence of actions: we take H actions starting at turn t1 (39) for t=0 to H-1. Then the last action is at turn39+H-1, and the position after that action is y_{39+H} = 9.\n\n  So the state at turn T (>=39) is the player's y-coordinate.\n\n  We are at:\n      T=39: y=0 (safe, because y=0 is not a freeway)\n\n  We want to reach y=9 at turn T (and then we stop). But note: we don't require to stay at y=9? Actually, we only require that at the end of the sequence we are at (0,9). So when we reach y=9, we stop.\n\n  The moves:\n\n      At turn T (>=39), we choose an action (U,D,S). Then at turn T+1, we are at a new y.\n\n  However, when we are at turn T, we are on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and we must check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n  Important: when we are at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action, and then we move to (0, y_{T+1}) at turn T+1.\n\n  So the collision at turn T: we are at y_T (which is the freeway we are on) and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\n  Example: at turn39, we are at y=0 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\n  Then we choose an action at turn39. Suppose we choose U: then at turn40 we are at y=1.\n\n  At turn40: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 -> we check the car on freeway1 at turn40: we computed that freeway1 is safe at turn40? (because freeway1 only had danger at T=35) -> so safe.\n\n  But wait: what about freeway7 and 8? They are dangerous at turn40? But we are at freeway1 at turn40, so we don't care about freeway7 and 8.\n\n  Similarly, if we are at freeway7 at turn40, that would be dangerous. But we are at freeway1.\n\n  So we need to plan a path from y=0 at turn39 to y=9 at some turn T, such that for every turn t from 39 to T-1 (because at turn T we are at y9, which is safe) we do not collide.\n\n  Specifically, for each turn t (>=39) and for the y we are at at that turn, if y is between 1 and 8, then the car on freeway y at turn t must not cover 0.\n\n  We are going to simulate from turn39 to as many turns as needed.\n\n  The minimal H is the number of actions. Since we must go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 actions (if we go up every time). Let's try if 9 actions work.\n\n  Plan: at each turn from 39 to 47 (9 turns: t=39,40,...,47) we do U. Then:\n\n      Turn39: start at y0 -> take U -> at turn40: y1.\n      Turn40: at y1 -> take U -> at turn41: y2.\n      Turn41: at y2 -> take U -> at turn42: y3.\n      Turn42: at y3 -> take U -> at turn43: y4.\n      Turn43: at y4 -> take U -> at turn44: y5.\n      Turn44: at y5 -> take U -> at turn45: y6.\n      Turn45: at y6 -> take U -> at turn46: y7.\n      Turn46: at y7 -> take U -> at turn47: y8.\n      Turn47: at y8 -> take U -> at turn48: y9.\n\n  Now check collisions:\n\n      At turn39: y=0 -> safe.\n      At turn40: y=1 -> freeway1: check freeway1 at turn40: \n          car: [37+12*(40-39)=37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> [49,60] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n      At turn41: y=2 -> freeway2: check freeway2 at turn41: \n          car: [-59+6*(41-39)= -59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not included -> safe? \n          But wait: we computed that freeway2 is dangerous at T=47 and 48, not 41. So safe.\n      At turn42: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? at turn42: \n          [-59+6*(42-39)= -59+18=-41, -48+18=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> safe.\n      At turn43: y=4 -> freeway4: same -> [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe.\n      At turn44: y=5 -> freeway5: same -> [-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n      At turn45: y=6 -> freeway6: check at turn45: \n          car: [-83+36*(45-39)= -83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> [133,168] -> safe? \n          But we computed that freeway6 is dangerous at T=41. At turn45, it's safe.\n      At turn46: y=7 -> freeway7: check at turn46: \n          car: [-95+48*(46-39)= -95+48*7 = -95+336=241, -48+336=288] -> safe? \n          But we computed that freeway7 is dangerous at T=40. At turn46, safe.\n      At turn47: y=8 -> freeway8: check at turn47: \n          car: [-95+48*(47-39)= -95+48*8 = -95+384=289, -48+384=336] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn48: we are at y9 -> goal and safe.\n\n  So it seems the straight path is safe? \n\n  But wait: at turn41, we are at freeway2? Actually, no: at turn40 we were at y1, then we moved up to y2 at turn41? \n\n  Actually, at turn41: we are at y2 (freeway2). We computed freeway2 at turn41: \n        tail: -59 + 6*(41-39) = -59+12 = -47\n        head: -48+12 = -36 -> so the car is at [-47,-36] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n  But note: we also have freeway6 at turn41: but we are not on freeway6 at turn41, we are on freeway2. So we don't care about freeway6.\n\n  Similarly, at turn40: we are at freeway1, and freeway7 and 8 are dangerous at turn40? But we are not on freeway7 or 8.\n\n  So the straight path (9 moves) is safe? \n\n  But wait: what about the goal? We reach y9 at turn48? \n\n  However, note that at turn47: we are at y8 (freeway8). Then we take U at turn47, and at turn48 we are at y9. But we don't check y9 for collision because it's not a freeway? \n\n  So the entire path is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 9, and the sequence is 9 U's.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, which corresponds to turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n  So for H=9: \n      t=0: turn39: a_{39} = U\n      t=1: turn40: a_{40} = U\n      t=2: turn41: a_{41} = U\n      t=3: turn42: a_{42} = U\n      t=4: turn43: a_{43} = U\n      t=5: turn44: a_{44} = U\n      t=6: turn45: a_{45} = U\n      t=7: turn46: a_{46} = U\n      t=8: turn47: a_{47} = U\n\n  Then at turn48: we are at y9.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the last action. So at the last action (at turn47) we are moving from y8 to y9. Then at turn48 we are at y9.\n\n  However, the problem does not require us to be at y9 at a specific turn, just as soon as possible. And 9 actions is the minimum.\n\n  But wait: is there a path that takes less than 9? We must go from 0 to 9, and each move can only change by at most 1, so 9 is the minimum.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is 9 moves of U.\n\n  However, let me double-check the dangerous freeways at the turns we are on:\n\n      turn39: y0 -> safe.\n      turn40: y1 -> freeway1: car1 at turn40: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> no 0 -> safe.\n      turn41: y2 -> freeway2: car2 at turn41: [-59+6*2=-47, -48+12=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> no 0 -> safe.\n      turn42: y3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? [-59+18=-41, -48+18=-30] -> safe.\n      turn43: y4 -> freeway4: same -> [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe.\n      turn44: y5 -> freeway5: same -> [-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n      turn45: y6 -> freeway6: car6 at turn45: [-83+36*6= -83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> safe.\n      turn46: y7 -> freeway7: car7 at turn46: [-95+48*7= -95+336=241, -48+336=288] -> safe.\n      turn47: y8 -> freeway8: car8 at turn47: [-95+48*8= -95+384=289, -48+384=336] -> safe.\n\n  So indeed safe.\n\n  But wait: what about freeway6 at turn41? We are not on freeway6 at turn41, we are on freeway2. So we don't care.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n      Turn 39: U\n      Turn 40: U\n      Turn 41: U\n      Turn 42: U\n      Turn 43: U\n      Turn 44: U\n      Turn 45: U\n      Turn 46: U\n      Turn 47: U\n\n  However, the problem says the current turn is t1=39, and we start at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn39 to move to y1 at turn40.\n\n  So the answer should be:\n\n      Turn 39: U\n      Turn 40: U\n      Turn 41: U\n      Turn 42: U\n      Turn 43: U\n      Turn 44: U\n      Turn 45: U\n      Turn 46: U\n      Turn 47: U\n\n  But note: after 9 actions (from turn39 to turn47) we are at turn48 at y9. However, the problem does not require to output the turn when we reach, only the sequence of actions.\n\n  But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the minimal number of actions? Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions.\n\n  So H=9.\n\n  However, let me check if we can do it in 8? We must go from 0 to 9 in 8 moves? Then the net change is +9, but each move is at most +1, so impossible. So 9 is minimal.\n\n  Therefore, we output 9 actions of U.\n\n  But note: what if we try to avoid the dangerous turns by waiting? But the dangerous turns are at 40,41,47,48 for specific freeways, but we are not on those freeways at those dangerous turns? So we don't need to avoid.\n\n  However, what if we had been on freeway6 at turn41? Then we would have collided. But we are not.\n\n  So the answer is the sequence of 9 U's.\n\n  But wait: let me check the initial condition: at turn39, we are at (0,0). Then we take U at turn39 -> at turn40 we are at (0,1). Then we take U at turn40 -> at turn41 we are at (0,2). So we are never on freeway6 (which is y=6) at turn41? Correct.\n\n  However, what if we had taken a different route? But we don't need to because the straight route works.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 9 and the actions are all U.\n\n  Output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\n}\n\n  But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", and H=9, so t from 0 to 8: \n      t=0: turn39\n      t=1: turn40\n      ...\n      t=8: turn47\n\n  So we output for turns 39 to 47.\n\n  However, the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we start at turn t1 (39). The first action is at turn39.\n\n  So the above is correct.\n\n  But wait: one more check: at turn47 we are at y8 and we move to y9 at turn48. And we are at y8 at turn47: we are on freeway8? We computed freeway8 at turn47: safe.\n\n  So no problem.\n\n  However, note that freeway8 is dangerous at turn40? But we are on freeway8 at turn47, not turn40.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 9.

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1. Since all cars are moving right, according to the data.\n\nCar update: for right-moving cars, the span moves right with speed s per turn. So at time T > t_1, the head becomes h + s*(T - t_1), and tail becomes τ + s*(T - t_1). Similarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Meaning the car covers the x-position 0 at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, the player is only on the new row at the next turn. So if at turn T, you move to a different y, at turn T you are still on the old row, and only at T+1 you are on the new row. So you don't collide with cars on the new row during the move turn.\n\nThe task is to find a sequence of actions from turn t_1 onwards to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nCurrent position: y=2 at t=41.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 7. Minimum moves would be 7 up actions, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions at turn t_1=41 for each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway k, I have one car given.\n\nk=1: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=12\n\nSince direction is right, the span is from τ to h, but in the update, for right-moving, span is [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] at time T.\n\nIn the car state, for k=1, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Head and tail might be positions.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be the right end, so for k=1, head=-48, tail=-59, but -48 > -59, so if moving right, head at -48, tail at -59, meaning the car extends from x=-59 to x=-48? But that seems backward.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car update: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\" but in the input, it's given as (head, tail).\n\nIn the table, for k=1: \"(-48, -59, right, 12)\"\n\nAnd in the update rule: for right-moving, span is [τ, h]? But here head=-48, tail=-59, so if τ is tail and h is head, and it's right-moving, then span should be from left to right, so τ should be left end, h right end.\n\nBut here tail=-59, head=-48, so since -59 < -48, the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, and moving right, so at time t, position is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] for the span.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the collision, at turn T, collision if player is on freeway k and 0 is in the span for that car on k.\n\nSpan is the interval covered.\n\nFor k=1 at t_1=41: car from x=-59 to x=-48, speed 12 right.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nk=2: (-36, -47, right, 6) so tail=-47, head=-36? But -47 < -36? -47 is more negative, so if tail is left end, head is right end, yes, from x=-47 to x=-36.\n\nInput is (head, tail), but head is given first, then tail? In the notation, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\" so for k=1, h=-48, τ=-59, so head is -48, tail is -59. Since moving right, tail is left end, head is right end, so span [left, right] = [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, k=2: head=-36, tail=-47? head=-36, tail=-47, so if tail is left, head right, span [-47, -36]? But tail=-47, head=-36, -47 < -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nBut τ is tail, which is the back, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same as k=2? (-36, -47, right, 6) head=-36, tail=-47, span [-47, -36]\n\nk=4: same, (-36, -47, right, 6) span [-47, -36]\n\nk=5: same, (-36, -47, right, 6) span [-47, -36]\n\nk=6: (24, -11, right, 36) head=24, tail=-11, so span [-11, 24]? tail=-11, head=24, so [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nk=7: (48, 1, right, 48) head=48, tail=1, span [1, 48]\n\nk=8: same as k=7, (48, 1, right, 48) span [1, 48]\n\nNow, the player is at y=2, which is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn t_1=41, player on y=2.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and no cars on y=9, I assume, as freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars.\n\nBut player starts at (0,2), and wants to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, to avoid collisions, when the player is on a freeway row at a certain turn, 0 should not be covered by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time T, the span is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nCollision at T if player on y=k and 0 in [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nSince the car is moving, the time when 0 is covered depends on the position.\n\nLet me define dt = T - t_1, so at time t_1 + dt.\n\nFor each freeway, find the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince the span moves, it covers 0 for a range of times.\n\nFor freeway k, car span at t_1 is [left_t1, right_t1], speed s.\n\nThen at dt, span [left_t1 + s*dt, right_t1 + s*dt]\n\n0 is in span if left_t1 + s*dt <= 0 <= right_t1 + s*dt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n0 >= left_t1 + s*dt and 0 <= right_t1 + s*dt\n\nSo s*dt >= -left_t1 and s*dt >= -right_t1? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nFrom left_t1 + s*dt <= 0 <= right_t1 + s*dt\n\nFirst inequality: left_t1 + s*dt <= 0 => s*dt <= -left_t1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= right_t1 + s*dt => s*dt >= -right_t1\n\nSo we have:\n\n- right_t1 <= s*dt <= - left_t1\n\nThen dt must satisfy:\n\n- right_t1 / s <= dt <= - left_t1 / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\ndt is integer, turns.\n\nAlso, since the car might not cover 0 at all if the interval doesn't include 0.\n\nFor each freeway, let's compute the time window when collision is possible if player is on that row.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: at t_1, span [-59, -48], s=12\n\nleft_t1 = τ = -59, right_t1 = h = -48? Earlier I said span [τ, h] for right-moving, with τ left, h right.\n\nFor k=1, τ = -59, h = -48, so left = -59, right = -48.\n\ns=12\n\nThen dt collision if -right <= s*dt <= -left\n\n-(-48) <= 12*dt <= -(-59) => 48 <= 12*dt <= 59\n\nSo 12*dt >= 48 and 12*dt <= 59\n\nThus dt >= 48/12 = 4\n\ndt <= 59/12 = 4.916...\n\nSince dt integer, dt = 4 or 5? 12*dt <=59, dt <= 59/12=4.916, so dt <=4 since integer? dt <= floor(59/12)=4? 12*4=48, 12*5=60>59, so 12*dt <=59 only for dt<=4, but 48<=12*dt<=59.\n\n12*dt >=48, dt>=4\n\n12*dt <=59, dt<= floor(59/12)=4 since 12*4=48, 12*5=60>59, so only dt=4? Let's see:\n\nAt dt=4, s*dt=12*4=48, span left +48= -59+48= -11, right +48= -48+48=0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nCollision at dt=4.\n\nAt dt=5, s*dt=60, left -59+60=1, right -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nAt dt=3, s*dt=36, left -59+36=-23, right -48+36=-12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at dt=4, collision possible on k=1.\n\ndt= T - t_1, so at T = t_1 + 4 = 41 + 4 = 45, if player on y=1, collision.\n\nNow freeway k=2: head=-36, tail=-47, so left=τ=-47? τ is tail, which is left end for right-moving.\n\nIn input (head, tail), head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nFor k=2: head=-36, tail=-47, so left=tail=-47, right=head=-36? -47 < -36, so span [left, right] = [-47, -36]\n\ns=6\n\nThen dt collision if -right <= s*dt <= -left\n\n-right = -(-36) =36\n\n-left = -(-47) =47\n\ns*dt =6 dt\n\nSo 36 <= 6 dt <= 47\n\nThus 6 dt >=36 => dt >=6\n\n6 dt <=47 => dt <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so dt <=7\n\nThus dt=6,7\n\nAt dt=6: s*dt=36, left -47+36=-11, right -36+36=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt dt=7: s*dt=42, left -47+42=-5, right -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt dt=5: s*dt=30, left -47+30=-17, right -36+30=-6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nAt dt=8: s*dt=48, left -47+48=1, right -36+48=12, span [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T= t_1 +6 and t_1 +7, i.e., 47 and 48.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same as k=2, head=-36, tail=-47, s=6, so same, collision at dt=6,7\n\nk=4: same, collision dt=6,7\n\nk=5: same, collision dt=6,7\n\nNow k=6: head=24, tail=-11, so left=tail=-11, right=head=24, s=36\n\ndt collision: -right <= s*dt <= -left\n\n-right = -24\n\n-left = -(-11) =11\n\ns*dt=36 dt\n\nSo -24 <= 36 dt <= 11\n\nNow, 36 dt >= -24 and 36 dt <=11\n\nFirst, 36 dt <=11 => dt <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so dt <=0\n\n36 dt >= -24 => dt >= -24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666, so dt >=0? dt integer, turn difference.\n\ndt = T - t_1, T >= t_1, so dt >=0.\n\n36 dt <=11, since 36>0, dt <= floor(11/36)=0\n\n36 dt >= -24, dt >= ceil(-24/36)= ceil(-2/3)=0? Since dt >=0.\n\nAt dt=0: s*dt=0, span left=-11, right=24, so [-11,24], 0 in, yes.\n\nAt dt=1: s*dt=36, left -11+36=25, right 24+36=60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nAt dt=-1, but T >= t_1, dt >=0, no.\n\nSo only at dt=0, collision on k=6.\n\ndt=0 means T=t_1=41.\n\nAt turn 41, on freeway k=6, car covers 0.\n\nBut player is at y=2 at t=41, not on y=6, so no problem now.\n\nCollision only if on that row at that turn.\n\nNow k=7: head=48, tail=1, so left=tail=1, right=head=48, s=48\n\ndt collision: -right <= s*dt <= -left\n\n-right = -48\n\n-left = -1\n\ns*dt=48 dt\n\nSo -48 <= 48 dt <= -1\n\nNow, 48 dt <= -1 => dt <= -1/48 ≈ -0.0208, so dt <= -1? But dt >=0, impossible.\n\n48 dt >= -48 => dt >= -1, which is true for dt>=0.\n\nBut 48 dt <= -1 requires dt <= -1/48 <0, not possible for dt>=0.\n\nSo no solution, meaning 0 never covered for k=7.\n\nSimilarly, k=8 same as k=7, no collision possible.\n\nk=7: at t_1, span [1,48], all positive, and moving right, so at later times, span [1+48dt, 48+48dt], all positions greater than 1, so 0 never covered. Similarly for k=8.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision only at dt=4, T=45\n\n- y=2: collision at dt=6 and 7, T=47,48\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, collision at 47,48\n\n- y=4: same, 47,48\n\n- y=5: same, 47,48\n\n- y=6: collision only at dt=0, T=41\n\n- y=7: no collision\n\n- y=8: no collision\n\ny=6 collision at T=41, but player is at y=2 at T=41, not on y=6, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, turn 41.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince I need to go up, D is counterproductive, probably not used, except maybe to avoid something, but let's see.\n\nThe dangerous points are on y=1 at T=45, and on y=2,3,4,5 at T=47 and 48.\n\ny=6,7,8 are safe except y=6 at T=41 which is past.\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, which is above.\n\nNow, minimal path: from y=2, I can go up directly.\n\nBut I might need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSince y=2 has collision at T=47 and 48, but I don't have to be there at those times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t_1=41 onwards.\n\nAt turn 41: position y=2\n\nI need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up, to y=3 at turn 42.\n\nOr stay, y=2 at 42, or down to y=1, but y=1 has collision at T=45, so might be bad.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimum turns: 7 up moves, but with waiting, might be more.\n\nSince there are obstacles, I need to schedule when to be on which row.\n\nThe constraints:\n\n- At turn 45, I should not be on y=1, because collision.\n\n- At turns 47 and 48, I should not be on y=2,3,4,5, because collision on those rows.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all have collision at 47 and 48.\n\ny=1 collision only at 45.\n\ny=6,7,8 safe except y=6 at 41 which is irrelevant.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nThe critical times are 45,47,48.\n\nTurn 41: y=2\n\nI need to be above y=5 by turn 47, or below, but since I need to go up, below might not help.\n\nLet's think about the position over time.\n\nLet me make a timeline.\n\nLet t be absolute turn, starting from t=41.\n\nAt t=41: y=2\n\nAction a_41 determines y_42.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need y_t for t>=41.\n\ny_t must avoid:\n\n- If t=45, y_t != 1\n\n- If t=47 or 48, y_t not in {2,3,4,5}\n\nAlso, since I move step by step, y changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, diff 7, so H at least 7.\n\nCan I do it in 7 turns? That means reaching y=9 at t=41+7-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, position at t_1 + t.\n\nAt time t_1 + t, y position.\n\nStart at t=0: t_1 +0 =41, y=2\n\nAfter H turns, at time t_1 + H, but the sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn, at t=41, after 0 actions, y=2\n\nAfter 1 action at t=41, to y=3 at t=42\n\nAfter 2 actions, y=42 at t=43? Let's index properly.\n\nAt time T, y_T.\n\nAt T=41, y=2\n\nAfter action a_41, y_42 = y_41 + delta y\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k}, y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we have actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nNow, for collision: at each time T, when we are on y_T, it must not collide, meaning for that y_T, at time T, 0 not in car span on that row.\n\nNow, in the 7-turn plan: if I go up every turn from t=41 to t=47.\n\nActions at t=41,42,43,44,45,46,47\n\ny: t=41:2\n\na41=U, y42=3\n\na42=U, y43=4\n\na43=U, y44=5\n\na44=U, y45=6\n\na45=U, y46=7\n\na46=U, y47=8\n\na47=U, y48=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=41: y=2, freeway 2. At t=41, for y=2, car on y=2 at t=41? At t=41, y=2, and for y=2, collision at t=47 and 48, not at 41. At t=41, y=2 car: at t_1=41, span [-47,-36] for y=2, which does not include 0? x from -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in, so safe at t=41.\n\nSimilarly, at t=42: y=3, freeway 3. At t=42, dt=42-41=1, for y=3 car: similar to y=2, at dt=1, s=6, span left -47+6= -41? For y=3, car same as y=2, span at dt: left -47 + s*dt, s=6, dt=1, left -47+6=-41, right -36+6=-30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=43: y=4, dt=2, span -47+12= -35? s*dt=12, left -47+12=-35, right -36+12=-24, span [-35,-24], no 0.\n\nt=44: y=5, dt=3, s*dt=18, left -47+18=-29, right -36+18=-18, span [-29,-18], no 0.\n\nt=45: y=6, freeway 6. At t=45, dt=45-41=4, for y=6 car: at t_1, span [-11,24], s=36, at dt=4, s*dt=144, left -11+144=133, right 24+144=168, span [133,168], 0 not in. And collision only at dt=0 for y=6, which is t=41, so safe.\n\nt=46: y=7, freeway 7, no collision ever, safe.\n\nt=47: y=8, freeway 8, no collision, safe.\n\nt=48: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nIn this path, at t=47, y=8, and at t=48, y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, at t=48, y=9, so after 7 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart: t=41, y=2\n\nAfter a41: t=42, y=3\n\na42: t=43, y=4\n\na43: t=44, y=5\n\na44: t=45, y=6\n\na45: t=46, y=7\n\na46: t=47, y=8\n\na47: t=48, y=9\n\nSo at t=48, y=9, which is turn t_1 + 7, since 41+7=48.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=41 to t=41+H-1 for actions, position at t=41+H.\n\nHere, actions from t=41 to t=47, that's 7 actions, H=7, position at t=48=41+7.\n\nAnd y=9.\n\nNow, check if any collision: in the path, at t=45, y=6, which is fine, as above.\n\nAt t=47, y=8, fine.\n\nBut t=47 is a critical time for y=2,3,4,5, but we are on y=8, not on those, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut at t=45, we are on y=6, not on y=1, so no problem with y=1 collision.\n\nIn this path, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let's confirm y at each turn:\n\nt=41: y=2, safe as above\n\nt=42: y=3, safe\n\nt=43: y=4, safe\n\nt=44: y=5, safe\n\nt=45: y=6, safe\n\nt=46: y=7, safe\n\nt=47: y=8, safe\n\nt=48: y=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=7, which is the minimum possible since distance is 7.\n\nIn the actions, I used U all the way.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from t=41 to t=47.\n\nThe answer should list actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn this case, all actions are U.\n\nBut let's see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nAt t=47, we are on y=8, but the critical time for y=2-5 is at t=47 and 48.\n\nAt t=47, if we were on y=5, for example, collision, but we are on y=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=48, if on y=5, collision, but we are on y=9.\n\nIn this path, we avoid all.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier?\n\nWith H=6 actions: from y=2 to y=9 in 6 moves? But y changes by at most 1 per turn, so from 2 to 9, min 7 changes, so H=7 is minimum.\n\nFor example, after 6 actions, y could be at most 2+6=8 if all up, or less.\n\nStart y=2 at t=41.\n\nAfter 1 action: t=42, y<=3\n\nAfter 2: t=43, y<=4\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions: t=47, y<=8\n\nAfter 7 actions: t=48, y<=9\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=48, need 7 actions.\n\nIf I reach earlier, but since y=2 at t=41, the earliest to y=9 is at t=48, with 7 up moves.\n\nt=41: y=2\n\nt=42: y=3\n\n...\n\nt=48: y=9\n\nYes, t=48 is earliest possible.\n\nAnd in this case, with all U, it works.\n\nBut in the path above, at t=45, we are on y=6, but y=1 has collision at t=45, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at t=47 and 48, we are above.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=45 with other rows?\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a45: at t=45, action a45, which affects y46.\n\nIn the position, at time t, y_t is before action or after? In the game dynamics, player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, based on action at t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are at position y_T, and we check if collision on that row at that time.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt T=45: y_45=6 (after a44, which is U from y44=5 to y45=6)\n\ny_45=6, freeway 6, at time 45, as above, span [133,168], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 collision only at t=41, but at other times, when dt>0, it might cover 0? For y=6, at dt=0, t=41, span includes 0.\n\nAt dt=1, t=42, span [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, only at t=41.\n\nSo at t=45, no issue.\n\nTherefore, with all U actions, I can reach y=9 at t=48.\n\nH=7 turns? Turns: actions at t=41,42,43,44,45,46,47, that's 7 actions.\n\nSequence: a41=U, a42=U, a43=U, a44=U, a45=U, a46=U, a47=U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be on a row at bad time.\n\nFor example, at t=47: y=8, not in {2,3,4,5}, safe.\n\nt=48: y=9, not a freeway.\n\nBut t=47 and 48 are bad for y=2,3,4,5, but we are not there.\n\nIn the sequence, we pass through y=5 at t=44, which is before t=47, so safe.\n\ny=4 at t=43, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but impossible.\n\nOr with some S, but that would make H larger, not smaller.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at t=48.\n\nBut in the car states, for y=7 and y=8, no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=6 only dangerous at t=41, which we are not on at that time.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at t=45, fine.\n\nSo seems all set.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision for y=2 at t=47.\n\nAt t=47, if on y=2, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at t=47, we are on y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at y=2, which is freeway 2, at t=41.\n\nAt t=41, for y=2, car: as above, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\n}\n\nTurns from 41 to 47, 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if I go down, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nOr if I wait, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps at some point I need to avoid, but in this case, no conflict.\n\nBut let me think about t=45.\n\nAt t=45, if I were on y=1, collision, but I'm not.\n\nIn the path, I'm on y=6.\n\nSuppose I go slower: if I stay at y=2 for some turns, but at t=47 and 48, I cannot be on y=2, so I need to be away by then.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=2 until t=46, but at t=47, I need not to be on y=2.\n\nBut in our case, going up directly is fine.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at t=41,42, then at t=42, y=2, still safe? At t=42, y=2: dt=1, span [-41,-30], no 0, safe.\n\nBut if I stay until t=46, at t=46, y=2: dt=46-41=5, s=6, span left -47+30= -17? s*dt=30, left -47+30=-17, right -36+30=-6, span [-17,-6], no 0.\n\nThen at t=47, if I go up, to y=3 at t=48, but at t=47, if I am still on y=2, collision, since t=47 is bad for y=2.\n\nSo at t=47, I cannot be on y=2.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 until t=46, then at t=47, I must move, say U to y=3 at t=48.\n\nBut at t=47, position y=2, which is collision.\n\nBecause at t=47, on y=2, and collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2 at t=47.\n\nSimilarly, I need to leave y=2 before t=47.\n\nIn the direct up path, I leave early, no problem.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut in our path, we are fine.\n\nSo I think all U is the way.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 48, y=9.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=41.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U\n}\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: when moving, the collision rule says that if you move at turn T to different y, at turn T you are on old y, and only at T+1 on new y.\n\nIn this case, for example, at each turn, when we do U, at that turn we are on the current y, then move to next.\n\nBut in the collision check, we only care about the position at time T, which is before the action.\n\nIn the dynamics, at turn T, we are at position, then we take action, which may change position for next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on position y_T and the car on that row at time T.\n\nIn our sequence, we never are on a bad row at bad time.\n\nFor instance, at T=47, y_47=8, which is safe.\n\nNot on y=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the car on y=1 at t=45, but we avoid it by being on y=6.\n\nSo all good.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 41 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car states at turn 41 are:\n- Freeway 1: car span [-59, -48], moving right at speed 12. Collision occurs only at turn 45 (relative turn dt=4).\n- Freeway 2: car span [-47, -36], moving right at speed 6. Collision occurs at turns 47 and 48 (dt=6 and 7).\n- Freeway 3: car span [-47, -36], moving right at speed 6. Collision occurs at turns 47 and 48 (dt=6 and 7).\n- Freeway 4: car span [-47, -36], moving right at speed 6. Collision occurs at turns 47 and 48 (dt=6 and 7).\n- Freeway 5: car span [-47, -36], moving right at speed 6. Collision occurs at turns 47 and 48 (dt=6 and 7).\n- Freeway 6: car span [-11, 24], moving right at speed 36. Collision occurs only at turn 41 (dt=0).\n- Freeway 7: car span [1, 48], moving right at speed 48. No collision possible, as 0 is never covered.\n- Freeway 8: car span [1, 48], moving right at speed 48. No collision possible, as 0 is never covered.\n\nThe dangerous times are:\n- Turn 45: collision on y=1.\n- Turns 47 and 48: collision on y=2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2, a minimum of 7 up actions (U) is required, as the y-coordinate changes by at most ±1 per turn. A sequence of all U actions from turn 41 to turn 47 achieves y=9 at turn 48 without collisions:\n\n- At turn 41: y=2 (safe, as collision on y=2 occurs only at turns 47 and 48).\n- At turn 42: y=3 (safe, as collision on y=3 occurs only at turns 47 and 48; at turn 42, the car span on y=3 is [-41, -30], not covering 0).\n- At turn 43: y=4 (safe, as collision on y=4 occurs only at turns 47 and 48; at turn 43, the car span on y=4 is [-35, -24], not covering 0).\n- At turn 44: y=5 (safe, as collision on y=5 occurs only at turns 47 and 48; at turn 44, the car span on y=5 is [-29, -18], not covering 0).\n- At turn 45: y=6 (safe, as collision on y=6 occurs only at turn 41; at turn 45, the car span on y=6 is [133, 168], not covering 0).\n- At turn 46: y=7 (safe, as no collision possible on y=7).\n- At turn 47: y=8 (safe, as no collision possible on y=8).\n- At turn 48: y=9 (goal reached, and y=9 has no freeway).\n\nThis sequence avoids all dangerous positions at critical times:\n- At turn 45, y=6 (not y=1).\n- At turns 47 and 48, y=8 and y=9 (not in {2,3,4,5}).\n\nH=7 is minimal, as reaching y=9 from y=2 requires at least 7 moves. Any sequence with delays (S or D actions) would increase H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: U \\\\\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,4) at turn t1 = 43. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 through 8, and for each, I'm given their position at turn t1=43: head, tail, direction, and speed. Collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The player is only on a freeway when they are at that y-position during their move.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, when they decide to move, they are still on the current y, and only after the move do they occupy the new y for the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn index. At turn t, the player is at position y_t. They choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen, for collision: at turn T, if the player is at y_T, and y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the car on that freeway. If 0 is in the car's span at turn T, collision occurs.\n\nThe car's span moves over time based on its speed and direction.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to compute when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nLet me list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: head h = -24, tail τ = -35, direction right, speed s=12\n\nSince direction is right, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut h and τ are positions at t1. For left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h I assume, since it's tail and head.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But it says head h and tail τ.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so it implies that for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so at t1, position from τ to h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" which might mean h is left, τ is right or something? But it says [h, τ] for left-moving.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me parse.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nIf h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, h should be the front when moving left, so if moving left, front is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, front is increasing.\n\nIn the input, for all cars here, direction is right, so let's focus on that.\n\nFor right-moving: at t1, Span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ and h given.\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -24, tail τ = -35, direction right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], I assume, since τ should be smaller if moving right.\n\nτ = -35, h = -24, so -35 < -24, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s (T - t1), h + s (T - t1)] = [-35 + 12*(T - 43), -24 + 12*(T - 43)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, player starts at y=4 at t1=43.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9, which is above the freeways, so once at y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we need to go to 9, so probably not useful to go down.\n\nNow, since we want minimal turns, and y from 4 to 9, difference is 5, so minimum 5 turns if we can go up directly, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway, when 0 is in the car's span, and avoid being on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut since the player moves step by step, we need to plan a path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nDefine t_rel = T - t1 = T - 43, the time relative to t1.\n\nSo for a given freeway, at relative time t, span is as above.\n\n0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at relative time t is [τ + s t, h + s t] for t = T - t1.\n\nThen 0 in span if τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nAll cars given are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8, all direction right.\n\nSo for each, we have τ, h, s.\n\nLet's list:\n\nFreeway k | τ | h | s\n\n1: τ = -35, h = -24, s=12\n\n2: τ = -35, h = -24, s=6? Wait no\n\nLook at input:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 12) — head h=-24, tail τ=-35\n\nBut for span, as per right-moving, it should be [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 6) same τ and h? Head -24, tail -35? That can't be right for all.\n\nFreeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 6) — same as freeway 1 but different speed.\n\nFreeway 3: (-24, -35, right, 6) same\n\nFreeway 4: (-24, -35, right, 6) same\n\nFreeway 5: (-24, -35, right, 6) same\n\nThen freeway 6: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nFor freeways 1-5, all have τ = -35, h = -24? But head and tail: if τ = -35, h = -24, and moving right, span at t1 is [-35, -24], so the car is from -35 to -24, which is 12 units long? -24 - (-35) = 11, but not important.\n\nFor freeway 1, s=12.\n\nNow, for a car, 0 in span at relative time t if:\n\nτ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nSince τ <= h for right-moving.\n\nSo for freeway 1: τ = -35, h = -24, s=12\n\nSo -35 + 12 t <= 0 <= -24 + 12 t\n\nNow, -35 + 12t <= 0 => 12t <= 35 => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 + 12t => 24 <= 12t => t >= 24/12 = 2\n\nSo for t in [2, 2.916], since t must be integer? t is relative turn, so integer.\n\nt = T - t1, and turns are discrete, so t integer.\n\nt >= 2 and t <= floor(35/12)? 35/12=2.916, so t <= 2 since 2.916, floor is 2? But t <= 2.916, so t <= 2 since integer? t <= floor(2.916) = 2, but 2.916, t=2 is 2 <= 2.916, yes; t=3 is 3>2.916, not <=.\n\n-35 + 12t <= 0\n\n12t <= 35\n\nt <= 35/12 = 2 + 11/12 ≈2.916, so for integer t, t <= 2? t=2: -35 + 24 = -11 <=0, true; t=3: -35+36=1 >0, not <=0? The inequality is τ + s t <=0, which is min <=0.\n\nAnd 0 <= h + s t, max >=0.\n\nAt t=2: min = -35 + 12*2 = -35+24= -11 <=0, true\n\nMax = -24 + 24 =0 <=0, true, 0<=0.\n\nAt t=3: min = -35+36=1 >0? 1 <=0? False, 1 >0, so min=1 >0, so 0 not >= min.\n\nSimilarly, max= -24+36=12 >=0, but min=1 >0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, at t=1: min= -35+12= -23 <=0, true; max= -24+12= -12 <=0? 0 <= -12? False, -12 <0, so max <0, so 0 not <= max.\n\n0 <= max must hold, but max = -12 <0, so 0 > max, not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at t=2, 0 in span? t=2 relative.\n\nRelative t=2, which is T = t1 + 2 = 43 + 2 = 45.\n\nNow for freeway 2: same τ=-35, h=-24, but s=6.\n\nτ + s t <=0 <= h + s t\n\n-35 +6t <=0 <= -24 +6t\n\nFirst, -35+6t <=0 => 6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24 +6t => 24 <=6t => t >=4\n\nSo t integer, t=4,5\n\nt=4: min= -35+24= -11<=0, max= -24+24=0<=0, true\n\nt=5: min= -35+30= -5<=0, max= -24+30=6>=0, true\n\nt=6: min= -35+36=1>0, not <=0, false\n\nSo t=4 and 5, relative.\n\nT = t1 + t = 43 +4=47, 43+5=48? Relative t, T= t1 + t_rel.\n\nt_rel=4, T=47; t_rel=5, T=48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since (-24,-35,right,6), so same, dangerous at t_rel=4,5 → T=47,48\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=47,48\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=47,48\n\nNow freeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-83? For right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt relative time t, span: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\n0 in span if -83 +36t <=0 <= -48 +36t\n\nFirst, -83+36t <=0 => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48 +36t => 48 <=36t => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSo t integer, t=2? t=1: min= -83+36= -47 <=0, true; max= -48+36= -12 <=0? 0 <= -12? False, max=-12<0\n\nt=2: min= -83+72= -11 <=0, true; max= -48+72=24 >=0, true, 0<=24 yes.\n\nt=3: min= -83+108=25>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only t=2, relative, T=43+2=45\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nh=-48, τ=-95, span at t1: [-95,-48]\n\nAt t: [-95 +48t, -48 +48t]\n\n0 in span: -95+48t <=0 <= -48+48t\n\nFirst: -95+48t <=0 => 48t <=95 => t <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+48t => 48 <=48t => t >=1\n\nSo t integer, t=1: min= -95+48= -47 <=0, true; max= -48+48=0 <=0, true.\n\nt=2: min= -95+96=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only t=1, relative, T=43+1=44\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-95,right,48), so dangerous at t_rel=1, T=44\n\nSummarize dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous at T=45\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous at T=47,48\n\n- Freeway 3: dangerous at T=47,48\n\n- Freeway 4: dangerous at T=47,48\n\n- Freeway 5: dangerous at T=47,48\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at T=45\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at T=44\n\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at T=44\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at T=43.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 4 to 9, minimum 5 up moves, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince the dangerous times are only at specific turns, and for specific freeways, we might be able to avoid by not being on that freeway at that turn, or by moving away.\n\nAlso, note that at y=0 and y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\ny=0 might be below, but we want to go up.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous (freeway, turn) pairs:\n\n- At T=44: freeway 7 and 8 dangerous (y=7 and y=8)\n\n- At T=45: freeway 1 and 6 dangerous (y=1 and y=6)\n\n- At T=47: freeway 2,3,4,5 dangerous (y=2,3,4,5)\n\n- At T=48: freeway 2,3,4,5 dangerous (y=2,3,4,5)\n\nT=47 and 48, all of y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous? Freeways 2,3,4,5 correspond to y=2,3,4,5.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k, I assume.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at T=46, is there any dangerous? From above, no. Only T=44,45,47,48.\n\nT=43,44,45,46,47,48,...\n\nAt T=43, we are at y=4.\n\nT=43 is the current turn, and we are at position, but we start by choosing action at t1=43 for the next position.\n\nClarify the timeline.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThey choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen for collision at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for car on freeway y_T, 0 in span at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are concerned with y_T and the car on that row at that time.\n\nNow, at T=43, player is at y=4. Now, freeway 4 is at y=4.\n\nIs freeway 4 dangerous at T=43? From above, freeway 4 is dangerous at T=47 and 48, not at 43.\n\nAt T=43, for freeway 4: we need to check if 0 in span at T=43.\n\nFor freeway 4, which is one of 2,3,4,5, all with τ=-35, h=-24, s=6.\n\nAt relative t=0 (T=43), span: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-35, -24], min=-35 <=0, max=-24 <0? -24 <0, so 0 not <= max, since max negative. So 0 not in [-35,-24], so safe at T=43.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at T=43, we are at y=4, and it's safe.\n\nWe need to choose action at T=43 to go to y_{44}.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn.\n\nThe dangerous points:\n\n- At T=44, freeway 7 and 8 are dangerous, so if player is on y=7 or y=8 at T=44, collision.\n\n- At T=45, freeway 1 and 6 dangerous, so if on y=1 or y=6 at T=45, collision.\n\n- At T=47, freeway 2,3,4,5 dangerous, so if on y=2,3,4,5 at T=47, collision.\n\n- At T=48, same, y=2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nWe start at T=43, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from y=4 to y=5 at T=44, y=6 at T=45, y=7 at T=46, y=8 at T=47, y=9 at T=48.\n\nBut check collisions:\n\nAt T=44: y=5? Start at T=43, y=4.\n\nAfter action at T=43, y_{44} = y_{43} + a_{43}.\n\nIf we go up, a_{43}=U, then y_{44} = 5.\n\nAt T=44, player at y=5. Now, freeway 5? y=5 corresponds to freeway 5.\n\nBut at T=44, is freeway 5 dangerous? Freeway 5 dangerous at T=47 and 48, not at 44.\n\nFrom above, dangerous only at specific times.\n\nAt T=44, dangerous freeways are 7 and 8, not 5.\n\nSo y=5 at T=44 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, y=6, freeway 6 is dangerous at T=45, so collision!\n\nIn the sequence: T=43, y=4\n\na=U: T=44, y=5\n\na=U: T=45, y=6 — but at T=45, freeway 6 is dangerous, so if on y=6, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=6 at T=45.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=7 at T=46: but let's see.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nT=43: y=4 (safe)\n\na=U: T=44: y=5 (freeway 5, not dangerous at T=44, safe)\n\na=U: T=45: y=6 (freeway 6 dangerous at T=45, collision)\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go down or stay, but we need to go up.\n\nPerhaps go up slower or faster.\n\nAnother idea: at T=45, avoid being on y=6.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at T=44, so if we stay at T=44, action S, then y_{45} = y_{44} =5? Action at T=44 determines y_{45}.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T in 1-8 and car span contains 0 at T.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt T=43: y=4, safe as above.\n\nNow, choose a_{43}: if U, then y_{44} =5\n\nThen at T=44: y=5, which is freeway 5. At T=44, freeway 5: span at T=44 relative t=44-43=1.\n\nFor freeway 5, τ=-35, h=-24, s=6, span at t_rel=1: [ -35 +6*1, -24 +6*1] = [-29, -18], min=-29<0, max=-18<0, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=44, choose action for y_{45}.\n\nIf we choose U, y_{45}=6, then at T=45, y=6, freeway 6 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we choose S, y_{45}=5, then at T=45, y=5, freeway 5. At T=45, t_rel=2, for freeway 5: span [ -35+12, -24+12]? s=6, t_rel=2: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12], min=-23<0, max=-12<0, 0 not in, so safe? But freeway 5 dangerous only at T=47,48, not at 45.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose D, y_{45}=4, then at T=45, y=4, freeway 4, similarly safe.\n\nBut we need to go to 9.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=44, if we stay, y=5 at T=45, safe, but then we are still at y=5, and later at T=47 and 48, y=5 is dangerous, so we need to move away before that.\n\nSimilarly, we can go down to y=4 at T=45, but then we are at y=4, which might be dangerous later.\n\nBut let's think about the constraints.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe dangerous turns are T=44,45,47,48.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At T=44, cannot be on y=7 or y=8\n\n- At T=45, cannot be on y=1 or y=6\n\n- At T=47, cannot be on y=2,3,4,5\n\n- At T=48, cannot be on y=2,3,4,5\n\nAlso, at other times, all freeways are safe, as long as not at those times.\n\nNow, player starts at T=43, y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T=47 and 48, we must not be on those rows at those times.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=6 at T=45, etc.\n\nNow, from start, at T=43, y=4.\n\nWe can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at T=44, as above.\n\nThen at T=44, y=5, safe (since not y=7 or 8).\n\nNow at T=44, we choose action for T=45.\n\nWe need to avoid y=6 at T=45, because freeway 6 dangerous.\n\nAlso, avoid y=1, but we are at y=5, so y=1 is far.\n\nSo possible actions: U to y=6, but cannot, collision.\n\nS to stay at y=5, or D to y=4.\n\nIf S, then at T=45, y=5, which is safe as above, since freeway 5 not dangerous at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, we are at y=5.\n\nNow, we need to move because at T=47 and 48, y=5 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for y=4, etc.\n\nNow, at T=45, we can choose to go up or down or stay.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAlso, at T=45, if we go up to y=6, but at T=45, y=6 is dangerous only if we are on it at T=45, but we are choosing action at T=45 for y_{46}.\n\nAt T=45, position y=5 (if we stayed).\n\nThen action a_{45}:\n\nIf U, y_{46}=6\n\nThen at T=46, y=6. Now, is freeway 6 dangerous at T=46? From above, only dangerous at T=45, not at 46. At T=46, relative t=3, for freeway 6: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, span at t_rel=3: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], min=25>0, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other freeways at T=46 are safe, since no dangerous events.\n\nThen from y=6, we can go up to y=7 at T=47? T=47 is dangerous for y=2,3,4,5, but y=7 is not in that, so should be safe? Freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at T=44, not at 47.\n\nAt T=47, freeway 7: relative t=4, span [-95 +48*4, -48 +48*4] = [-95+192, -48+192] = [97,144], min=97>0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same.\n\nAnd y=6 at T=46 is safe.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nFrom T=43: y=4\n\na=U: T=44: y=5\n\nThen at T=44, instead of going to y=6 at T=45, we stay: a=S, so T=45: y=5 (safe)\n\nNow at T=45: y=5, choose a_{45}\n\nIf U, y_{46}=6\n\nT=46: y=6 (safe, as above)\n\nThen at T=46, choose a_{46}, say U, y_{47}=7\n\nNow T=47: y=7. Freeway 7, not dangerous at T=47, as above. Dangerous only at T=44.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 is not in y=2-5, so safe.\n\nThen a_{47}=U, y_{48}=8\n\nT=48: y=8. Freeway 8 dangerous? At T=48, relative t=5, freeway 8: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48, span [-95+48*5, -48+48*5] = [-95+240, -48+240] = [145,192], min>0, safe.\n\nThen a_{48}=U, y_{49}=9, reached at T=49.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at T=49, with 6 actions? From T=43 to T=49, that's 6 turns: actions at T=43,44,45,46,47,48.\n\nT=43: start position, but we take actions from t=43 onwards.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{43} to a_{48}, 6 actions, to reach y=9 at T=49.\n\nBut minimal H? Since we need H turns to reach, from turn t1 to t1+H-1, position at t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nIn this case, at T=43 (turn t1), we are at y=4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSet t1=43.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we start from y_{t1} =4.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so minimum H=5 to go from 4 to 9.\n\nIn the above, we used H=6 actions: actions at t=43 to 48, position at t=49 is 9.\n\nBut perhaps we can do with H=5.\n\nWith H=5 actions, we reach at turn t1+5=43+5=48, y=9.\n\nNow, is it possible?\n\nStart at T=43, y=4.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at T=48, y=9.\n\nNow, the path: we need y_{48}=9.\n\nSince y changes by ±1 or 0 each step, to go from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps, we must have net +5, so exactly 5 up moves, no down or stay, because if we stay or go down, we need more ups, but with 5 actions, if we have k up, m down, p stay, k+m+p=5, k - m =5, since net +5.\n\nSo k - m =5, k + m + p =5.\n\nThen 2k + p =10, so k=5, m=0, p=0 is only solution? k - m =5, k + m + p=5.\n\nSet m=0, then k=5, p=0.\n\nIf m=1, k=6, but k+m+p=6+1+p=7+p>5, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, only k=5, m=0, p=0.\n\nSo with H=5, we must move up every turn, no down or stay.\n\nSo actions: a_{43}=U, a_{44}=U, a_{45}=U, a_{46}=U, a_{47}=U\n\nThen positions:\n\nT=43: y=4\n\nAfter a_{43}=U: T=44: y=5\n\nAfter a_{44}=U: T=45: y=6\n\nBut at T=45, y=6, freeway 6 dangerous, collision. Cannot.\n\nAfter a_{45}=U: T=46: y=7\n\nAfter a_{46}=U: T=47: y=8\n\nAfter a_{47}=U: T=48: y=9\n\nNow, collisions: at T=45, y=6, collision as above.\n\nAlso, at T=47, y=8, but freeway 8 not dangerous at T=47? At T=47, freeway 8: relative t=4, span [-95+192, -48+192]=[97,144]>0, safe.\n\nBut at T=45, collision, so invalid.\n\nThus, direct up in 5 turns impossible due to collision at T=45.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 6 turns or more, but with detours or waits.\n\nIn my earlier sequence with 6 actions, we reached at T=49.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier with different path.\n\nH=5 impossible, so minimal H=6.\n\nIn H=6, we reach at T=49.\n\nBut with 6 actions, we might have stays or downs, but to minimize H, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nIn the sequence I thought: actions: a43=U, a44=S, a45=U, a46=U, a47=U, a48=U\n\nThen positions:\n\nT=43: y=4\n\na43=U: T=44: y=5\n\na44=S: T=45: y=5 (since S, no change)\n\na45=U: T=46: y=6\n\na46=U: T=47: y=7\n\na47=U: T=48: y=8\n\na48=U: T=49: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=43: y=4, safe\n\nT=44: y=5, freeway 5, at T=44, not dangerous, safe\n\nT=45: y=5, freeway 5, at T=45, as above, span min=-23<0, max=-12<0? t_rel=2 for freeway 5: s=6, t=2, [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], both negative, 0 not in, safe\n\nT=46: y=6, freeway 6, at T=46, t_rel=3, span [-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60]>0, safe\n\nT=47: y=7, freeway 7, at T=47, t_rel=4, span [-95+192, -48+192]=[97,144]>0, safe\n\nT=48: y=8, freeway 8, at T=48, t_rel=5, span [-95+240, -48+240]=[145,192]>0, safe\n\nT=49: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll safe, and we reached at T=49 with 6 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nWith H=6, we reach at T=49.\n\nBut perhaps with H=6, we can reach at T=48? No, with H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=43, after H actions, position at turn 43 + H.\n\nSet y_{43} =4.\n\nAfter a_{43}, y_{44}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{43+H-1}, y_{43+H}\n\nSet y_{43+H} =9.\n\nFor H=6, y_{49}=9.\n\nIf we can reach at T=48 with fewer actions, but H=5 not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go down first or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0, but then we need to come back up, which takes more turns.\n\nSince we have to avoid T=47 and 48 for y=2-5, and T=45 for y=6.\n\nAnother idea: at T=44, instead of staying, we go down to y=4.\n\nThen at T=45, y=4.\n\nBut at T=45, y=4 is safe, since freeway 4 not dangerous.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut at T=47 and 48, y=4 dangerous if we are there.\n\nSo we need to be above y=5 by T=47.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the above sequence, we stayed at y=5 at T=45, which is safe, then went up to y=6 at T=46, etc.\n\nWe could go directly to y=7 or higher earlier.\n\nFor example, from T=43, y=4, go up to y=5 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, instead of staying, go up to y=6? But at T=45, if we are at y=6, collision.\n\nBut we choose action at T=44 for y_{45}.\n\nIf we go U at T=44, y_{45}=6, then at T=45, y=6, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo down to y=4 at T=45? Then at T=45, y=4, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 at T=45.\n\nThen we need to go up, but at T=47, y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo we must move to y=6 or higher by T=46 or something.\n\nLet's list the positions over time.\n\nWe need y_T for T=43 to, say, 49.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- At T=44, y_T !=7 and y_T !=8 (cannot be on y=7 or 8)\n\n- At T=45, y_T !=1 and y_T !=6\n\n- At T=47, y_T !=2,3,4,5\n\n- At T=48, y_T !=2,3,4,5\n\nAlso, y changes by at most 1 each step.\n\nStart T=43, y=4.\n\nEnd at some T, y=9.\n\nMinimal T for y=9.\n\nSince we must avoid y=2-5 at T=47 and 48, the player must be at y<=1 or y>=6 at T=47 and T=48.\n\nBut y=0 or1 or6,7,8,9.\n\ny=1 might be dangerous if freeway 1, but only at specific times.\n\nAt T=47, freeway 1: let's check if dangerous.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous only at T=45, not at 47.\n\nAt T=47, t_rel=4, freeway 1: s=12, span [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24]>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 at T=47, safe.\n\nSo at T=47 and 48, it is safe to be on y=1 or y=6,7,8,9, but not y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, back to minimal path.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFrom start, at T=43, y=4.\n\nWe can go up to y=5 at T=44.\n\nNow, at T=44, we must not be on y=7 or 8, but we are at y=5, ok.\n\nFor T=45, we must not be on y=6 (or y=1, but not relevant).\n\nSo at T=45, y cannot be 6.\n\nOptions:\n\n- If at T=44, we stay, then y_{45}=5, which is not 6, so safe.\n\n- If we go up, y_{45}=6, collision.\n\n- If we go down, y_{45}=4, not 6, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to reach high y by T=47.\n\nIf we stayed at y=5 at T=45, then at T=45, we can go up to y=6 at T=46.\n\nThen at T=46, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=46, we can go up to y=7 at T=47.\n\nAt T=47, y=7, which is >=6, so not in 2-5, safe.\n\nThen go to y=8 at T=48, y=8 safe, then to y=9 at T=49.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf at T=44, we went down to y=4 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, y=4, safe (not y=6).\n\nThen at T=45, we can go up to y=5 at T=46? But at T=46, y=5.\n\nThen at T=47, y=5, but T=47, y=5 dangerous! Because freeway 5 dangerous at T=47.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=45, if we go up to y=5 at T=46, then at T=46, y=5.\n\nBut T=47 is next: at T=47, if we are still at y=5 or go to y=6, etc.\n\nAt T=46, position y=5 (if we went up from y=4 at T=45).\n\nThen action at T=46: if U, y_{47}=6\n\nThen at T=47, y=6, which is not in 2-5, so safe (y=6 is ok at T=47).\n\nThen similarly, go to y=7 at T=48, y=8 at T=49, y=9 at T=50? Slower.\n\nT=45: y=4 (after down at T=44)\n\nT=46: y=5 (if a_{45}=U)\n\nThen T=47: if a_{46}=U, y=6\n\nThen T=48: y=7 (a_{47}=U)\n\nT=49: y=8 (a_{48}=U)\n\nT=50: y=9 (a_{49}=U)\n\nThis takes 7 actions to reach at T=50, worse than before.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=45, go directly to y=6? But y changes by 1 per turn, cannot jump.\n\nMust go through y=5.\n\nUnless we go up faster, but we can only change by 1.\n\nSo from y=4 to y=6 in one step impossible.\n\nThus, going down at T=44 leads to slower path.\n\nBetter to stay or go up when possible.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 at T=44, then at T=44, since we must avoid y=6 at T=45, we stay at y=5 for T=45, then go up to y=6 at T=46, which is safe, then to y=7 at T=47, etc. as first sequence.\n\nBut at T=47, we go to y=7, which is fine.\n\nIn that sequence, we reach at T=49.\n\nBut can we reach at T=48?\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=48, we need to be at y=9 at turn 48.\n\nWith actions from T=43 to T=47, 5 actions, but we saw that with 5 up moves, we have collision at T=45.\n\nIf we have stays or downs, we cannot reach y=9 in 5 actions, as net change must be +5 with 5 actions, so only all up.\n\nBut collision.\n\nPerhaps start by not going up immediately.\n\nFor example, at T=43, instead of up, go down or stay.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSuppose at T=43, stay: a=S, then y_{44}=4\n\nAt T=44, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=44, we can go up to y=5 at T=45.\n\nBut at T=45, we need to avoid y=6, so if we go to y=5, safe.\n\nThen same as before, y=5 at T=45, then go up to y=6 at T=46, y=7 at T=47, y=8 at T=48, y=9 at T=49. Same as first sequence but delayed by one turn? No.\n\nT=43: y=4, a=S: T=44: y=4\n\nThen a=U: T=45: y=5\n\nThen a=U: T=46: y=6\n\nBut at T=46, y=6 safe, but now at T=45, we are at y=5.\n\nThen T=46: y=6\n\nT=47: if U, y=7\n\nT=48: y=8\n\nT=49: y=9\n\nStill reach at T=49 with actions from T=43 to 48? Actions: a43=S, a44=U, a45=U, a46=U, a47=U, a48=U, then y49=9, same H=6.\n\nBut we were at y=4 longer.\n\nWorse in a way, but same H.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had a43=U, a44=S, a45=U, etc., reached same time.\n\nBut in that, at T=45 we were at y=5, which is fine.\n\nNow, to reach at T=48, y=9.\n\nOnly possible with all up moves, but collision at T=45.\n\nUnless we can be at a safe position at T=45.\n\nBut if we go all up, at T=45 y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we go up but slower, we don't reach in time.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=7 directly, but need multiple steps.\n\nAnother thought: since at T=44, y=7 and 8 are dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nWe could go to y=6 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 at T=46 instead of T=45.\n\nIn the sequence, we did that.\n\nPerhaps go to y=9 via y=0, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0, then up, but from y=4 to y=0, 4 down, then to y=9, 9 up, at least 13 actions, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo minimal H=6 seems necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, we have H=6 actions.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nNow, in my sequence: actions at t=43 to t=48.\n\nt1=43.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 43: a_{43} = U (to go to y=5 at T=44)\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn t, we specify a_t.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t to go to next position.\n\nIn the sequence: to have y_{49}=9, with actions from t=43 to t=48.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn 43: choose a_{43}, after which y_{44} = y_{43} + Δy = 4 +1 =5 if U\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\n- Turn 43: U → y44=5\n\n- Turn 44: S → y45=5 (no change)\n\n- Turn 45: U → y46=6\n\n- Turn 46: U → y47=7\n\n- Turn 47: U → y48=8\n\n- Turn 48: U → y49=9\n\nAnd we checked all positions safe.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the stay.\n\nFor example, at T=44, instead of staying, go down to y=4, but then we need to go up later, might not save time.\n\nAt T=44, go up to y=6? But that would be a double move, but no, each action changes by at most 1.\n\nCannot.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=45, y=6 dangerous, but y=5 and y=7 are safe at that time.\n\nIf we could be at y=7 at T=45, but from T=43, in two steps: to T=44 and T=45.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=43, after two actions, y_{45} can be y=4,5,6, but not 7, since max change +2.\n\nSo y=7 impossible at T=45.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5,6 possible at T=45.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe, so must be y=4 or 5 at T=45.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nIf at T=45, y=5, then to y=9, need 4 up moves, to T=49.\n\nIf at T=45, y=4, then to y=9, need 5 up moves, to T=50.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best to be at y=5 at T=45, as in the sequence.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut at T=47 and T=48, we are at y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=47 we are at y=7, which is fine.\n\nBut T=47 is dangerous only for y=2-5, not for y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at T=48 if we can be at y=8 at T=47 or something, but from y=5 at T=45, to y=8 at T=47: in two actions, from y=5 to y=8, min two up moves, so at T=47, y=7 if we go up twice.\n\ny45=5, a45=U: y46=6, a46=U: y47=7, then a47=U: y48=8, a48=U: y49=9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at T=48 from here.\n\nUnless we start higher earlier, but we can't.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have a stay at turn 44.\n\nBut perhaps we can have a different path without stay.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5 at T=44, then at T=44, go down to y=4 at T=45? But then at T=45 y=4, then we need to go up, but slower.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nGo to y=3 or something, but worse.\n\nSo the sequence with one stay seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt1=43.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nThen position at turn 49 is 9.\n\nH=6 turns, from t=43 to t=48.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so {a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1}\n\nHere t1=43, H=6, so t=43 to 48.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 43: a_{43}\n\nTurn 44: a_{44}\n\n...\n\nTurn 48: a_{48}\n\nWith actions above.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, at T=44 dangerous, but we are not on them.\n\nAlso, for freeway 6 at T=45, we avoided by not being there.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=46 we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to y=7 faster, but not possible.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at T=43, go up to y=5 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, instead of stay, we go up? But to y=6 at T=45, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo down to y=3? Then at T=45, y=3, but at T=45, y=3 is freeway 3, which is not dangerous at T=45, since dangerous only at T=47,48.\n\nBut then from y=3, we need to go to y=9, more steps.\n\nFor example: T=43: y=4, a=D to y=3 at T=44? a43=D, y44=3\n\nAt T=44, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a44=U, y45=4\n\nAt T=45, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a45=U, y46=5\n\na46=U, y47=6? But at T=47, y=6 is safe, not dangerous.\n\ny47=6, then a47=U, y48=7, a48=U, y49=8, a49=U, y50=9, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence is better.\n\nThus, minimal H=6 with the sequence: U, S, U, U, U, U\n\nNow, write in the answer.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision point.\n\nAt T=47 and T=48, we need to avoid y=2,3,4,5.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=47, we are at y=7, which is above, safe.\n\nSimilarly T=48, y=8, safe.\n\nAt T=45, we are at y=5, not y=6, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 without the stay, but I don't think so.\n\nSuppose we start by staying at T=43: a43=S, y44=4\n\nThen a44=U, y45=5\n\nSame as before, then a45=U, y46=6, etc., but then at T=45 y=5, same as sequence but we used a stay earlier, but still reach at same time.\n\nIn terms of actions, same number.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we have a stay at T=44, which is fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe current turn is t1=43.\n\nPlayer position (0,4)\n\nWe need to output the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\n}\n\nBut is this minimal? H=6.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=6 but reaching earlier? No, with H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=43, H=6, reach at 49.\n\nBut turn indices: at turn 43, we are at position, we take action for next.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 43\\) is 6, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 43.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the critical turns when collisions occur. The dangerous turns and freeways are derived from the car states:\n\n- At turn 44, freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous.\n- At turn 45, freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 6\\) are dangerous.\n- At turns 47 and 48, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are dangerous.\n\nThe action sequence is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 44, avoiding \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at the dangerous turn 44.\n- Stay at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 45, avoiding \\(y = 6\\) at the dangerous turn 45.\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 46, which is safe as freeway \\(y = 6\\) is only dangerous at turn 45.\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 47, which is safe as freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are dangerous at turn 47, but \\(y = 7\\) is not affected.\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 48, which is safe for similar reasons as turn 47.\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 49, reaching the goal safely.\n\nAll positions during the sequence are verified to be collision-free based on the car span calculations at each turn.\n\nThe action sequence for turns 43 to 48 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: S \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U\n}",

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. They move left or right with a given speed. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. So, if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=45, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their movement.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at t1=45:\n\n- Freeway 1: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSince direction is right, the span is [tail, head] = [-11, 0] at t1=45. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so head is the right end. The span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed), and for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]. Then at time T > t1, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12(T-45), 0 + 12(T-45)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nGeneral formula for car position at time T:\n\nFor a right-moving car: position at T: head_T = head_{t1} + s * (T - t1)\n\ntail_T = tail_{t1} + s * (T - t1)\n\nSince it's moving right, the span is [tail_T, head_T]\n\nFor left-moving, it would be [head_T, tail_T] with head_T decreasing, but in this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: dir=right\n\nFreeway 2: dir=right? It says \"right\" in the table.\n\nIn the car state:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |\n\nFor k=1: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nk=2: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nk=3: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nk=4: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nk=5: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nk=6: (24, -11, right, 36)  head=24, tail=-11? That can't be right because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, for k=6: head=24, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSo at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nSimilarly, k=7: head=48, tail=1, right, speed 48 → span [1,48] at t1\n\nk=8: same as k=7, [1,48] at t1\n\nFor k=1: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed 12 → span [-11,0] at t1\n\nk=2 to k=5: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed 6 → span [-23,-12] at t1\n\nk=6: head=24, tail=-11, right, speed 36 → span [-11,24] at t1\n\nk=7: head=48, tail=1, right, speed 48 → span [1,48] at t1\n\nk=8: same, span [1,48] at t1\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThat is, if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) for the car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince all cars are on separate freeways, I need to check for each freeway separately when 0 is covered.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at t1=45.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be just moving up 4 times, but I have to avoid collisions on freeways 6,7,8 when I'm on them.\n\ny=5 to y=9, so freeways 6,7,8 are above, but I need to pass through y=6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn T, player is on y_T.\n\nIf I move up at turn T, y_{T+1} = y_T + 1, so at turn T, I'm on y_T, and at turn T+1, on y_T+1.\n\nCollision at T depends on y_T and car on y_T at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when the car covers position 0.\n\nFor freeway k, at time T, the car span includes 0 if tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all are right-moving, span is [tail_T, head_T], so 0 in span if tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T.\n\nNow, tail_T and head_T as functions of T.\n\nSet t1=45.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\ntail_T = tail_{t1} + s*(T - t1) = -11 + 12*(T - 45)\n\nhead_T = 0 + 12*(T - 45) = 12(T-45)\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12(T-45) ≤ 0 ≤ 12(T-45)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet Δt = T - 45, so time since t1.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\ntail_T = -11 + 12 Δt\n\nhead_T = 0 + 12 Δt = 12 Δt\n\n0 in span: min(tail_T, head_T) ≤ 0 ≤ max(tail_T, head_T), but since it's right-moving and tail_T < head_T, so tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T\n\nSo -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nFrom 0 ≤ 12 Δt, since 12>0, Δt ≥ 0\n\nFrom -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0, 12 Δt ≤ 11, Δt ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nBut Δt is integer since turns are discrete, I assume T is integer.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSo for y=1, 0 in span when tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T\n\n-11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\n0 ≤ 12 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 0\n\n-11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/12 < 1, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 0?

Covered at T=47 and 48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): same, covered T=47,48.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, covered T=47,48.\n\nNow, player is starting at y=5 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, for y=5, is 0 covered?\n\nAt t1=45, Δt=0, for y=5: tail_T = -23 +6*0 = -23, head_T = -12 +0 = -12, span [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in span. So no collision at T=45 on y=5.\n\nBut at T=47 and 48, 0 is covered on y=5.\n\nNow, freeway 6 (y=6): head=24, tail=-11, speed=36, right\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt T, tail_T = -11 + 36 Δt\n\nhead_T = 24 + 36 Δt\n\n0 in span if tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T\n\n-11 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 24 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 36 Δt ≤ 11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for integer Δt, Δt ≤ 0\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 24 + 36 Δt ⇒ since 24>0, always true for Δt ≥0\n\nBut Δt ≤0, and Δt ≥0, so only at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0: tail_T = -11 ≤0, head_T=24 ≥0, so yes.\n\nFor Δt>0, tail_T = -11 +36Δt, at Δt=1, tail=25, head=60, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=0, covered.\n\nBut Δt=0 is T=45.\n\nNow, for y=6 at T=45, 0 is covered.\n\nPlayer is at y=5 at T=45, not on y=6, so no issue.\n\nIf player were on y=6 at T=45, would collide, but not.\n\nNow, freeway 7 (y=7): head=48, tail=1, speed=48, right\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nAt T, tail_T = 1 + 48 Δt\n\nhead_T = 48 + 48 Δt\n\n0 in span: tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T\n\ntail_T =1 +48Δt ≥1 >0 for all Δt≥0, so min is at least 1, so 0 < min, so 0 never in span for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, tail=1, head=48, speed=48, so tail_T ≥1 >0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSo summary of when collision can occur:\n\n- y=1: only at T=45\n\n- y=2: at T=47,48\n\n- y=3: at T=47,48\n\n- y=4: at T=47,48\n\n- y=5: at T=47,48\n\n- y=6: at T=45\n\n- y=7: never\n\n- y=8: never\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, on y=5: for y=5, at T=45, not covered, as we saw, since span [-23,-12], no 0. So safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are 1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, no freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is above freeways.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=5, I need to increase y by 4, so at least 4 turns if I move up each time.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on certain freeways at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, when moving up, I will be on y=6, y=7, y=8 at some points.\n\nNow, collision only if on a freeway when 0 is covered for that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor y=6: only unsafe at T=45. Since at T=45, covered, but for T>45, not covered.\n\nAt T=45, covered, but player is not on y=6 at T=45, so ok.\n\nIf player is on y=6 at T=46, for example, is it covered?\n\nAt T=46, Δt=1, for y=6: tail_T = -11 +36*1 =25, head_T=24+36=60, span [25,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, any T>45, y=6 is safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=5 is safe at T=45, but unsafe at T=47 and 48.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,3,2 unsafe at T=47,48.\n\nBut I'm starting from y=5 at T=45, and I want to move up.\n\nPossible to move up directly?\n\nLet me simulate.\n\nAt T=45: player at y=5. Action a_{45}, but the sequence starts from t=0 to H-1, with t1=45, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nPosition at turn T is after action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1, player is at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,5).\n\nThen we choose action a_{t1}, which determines Δy, so y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, player is on y_T, and for that freeway, 0 in car span at T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nFor T=t1=45, player is at y=5.\n\nWe choose action a_{45}, which affects y_{46}.\n\nNow, for collision at T=45: on y=5, car on y=5: at T=45, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, I can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\ny=9 is the target, so when y_t =9 for some t, we stop at that turn.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t1 to t1+H-1, actions, and at turn t1+H-1, position should be (0,9).\n\nLet’s say we start at turn t1, after 0 actions, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAlso, in the answer format, it starts from Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd at turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} =5.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t= t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd y_{t1+H} should be 9? No.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nLet's index.\n\nSet t1=45.\n\nAt turn 45: position y_45 =5\n\nWe apply action a_45, then position at turn 46: y_46 = y_45 + Δy_45\n\nThen apply a_46, y_47 = y_46 + Δy_46\n\n...\n\nApply a_{45 + k} for k=0 to H-1, then position at turn (45 + k) after action, but after action at turn T, position is at turn T+1? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: at the start of turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines the move, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, before action, I think, we are on y_T, and car span at T covers 0.\n\nThe collision is based on position at turn T.\n\nIn the dynamics, it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo, at the beginning of turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check for collision based on that.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which moves to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nBack to the goal: we want y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nt1=45, so y_{45 + H - 1} =9.\n\nCurrently y_45=5.\n\nSo the change in position: from turn 45 to turn 45+H-1, there are (H-1) actions? Let's see the number of steps.\n\nFrom turn 45 to turn 45+H-1, that's from time T=45 to T=45+H-1.\n\nThe position at T=45+H-1 should be 9.\n\nThe actions are applied from time t1 to t1+H-1, i.e., from T=45 to T=45+H-1.\n\nFor each action at time T, it affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAction at T: a_T, determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo, starting from y_45.\n\nAfter a_45, y_46 = y_45 + Δy_45\n\nAfter a_46, y_47 = y_46 + Δy_46 = y_45 + Δy_45 + Δy_46\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{45 + k}, y_{46 + k} = y_45 + sum_{i=0}^{k} Δy_{45+i} for i from 0 to k, but y_{46+k} = y_45 + sum_{j=0}^{k} Δy_{45+j} where j from 0 to k.\n\nWe want y_{45 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{45 + H - 1} = y_45 + sum_{k=0}^{(H-1)-1} Δy_{45+k} ? Let's set the index.\n\nLet the turn for position: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo for turn S = 45 + H - 1, we want y_S =9.\n\nS = 45 + H - 1.\n\ny_S = y_{45} + sum_{T=45}^{S-1} Δy_T\n\nBecause from T=45 to T=S-1, there are (S-45) actions, each changing y to next.\n\nNumber of actions from 45 to S-1 inclusive is (S-1) - 45 + 1 = S - 45.\n\nAnd y_S = y_45 + sum_{T=45}^{S-1} Δy_T\n\nWe want y_S =9, with S=45+H-1.\n\nSince y_45=5, we need to increase by 4, so the sum of Δy from T=45 to S-1 must be +4, since each Δy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go up 4, the minimal number of turns H should be at least 4, if we move up each time.\n\nBut H is the number of turns in the sequence, which is the number of actions.\n\nSequence has H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for t1=45, actions at T=45 to T=45+H-1.\n\nThen position at turn t1+H = 45+H should be y_{45+H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{44+H} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =45 + H -1.\n\nSet K = H -1, so we want y_{45 + K} =9 for some K.\n\nWith actions from T=45 to T=45 + K -1? Let's clarify.\n\nDefine the target turn: let T_target = t1 + H -1 =45 + H -1\n\ny_{T_target} =9\n\ny_{T_target} = y_45 + sum_{T=45}^{T_target -1} Δy_T\n\nThe sum is over T from 45 to T_target -1, number of terms: (T_target -1) - 45 +1 = T_target -45\n\nAnd each Δy_T is integer between -1 and 1, and we need y_{T_target} - y_45 =4, so sum_{T=45}^{T_target -1} Δy_T =4\n\nThe number of actions in the sum is M = T_target -45\n\nThen sum of M terms of Δy, each in {-1,0,1}, sum to 4.\n\nMinimal M when all Δy=1, so M=4.\n\nThen T_target -45 =4, so T_target =49\n\nThen H from T_target = t1 + H -1 =45 + H -1 =49, so 45 + H -1 =49, thus H-1=4, H=5.\n\nWith actions at T=45,46,47,48, then y_49 = y_45 + Δy_45 + Δy_46 + Δy_47 + Δy_48\n\nAnd y_49=9.\n\nIf we move up each time, y_46=6, y_47=7, y_48=8, y_49=9.\n\nBut we need to check for collision at each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt each turn T, we are at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, we check if car on y_T has 0 in span at T.\n\nIn this path: start at T=45, y=5: safe, as before.\n\nT=46, y=6: for y=6 at T=46, Δt=46-45=1, tail_T= -11 +36*1=25, head=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=47, y=7: y=7, freeway 7, car at T=47, Δt=2, tail_T=1 +48*2=1+96=97, head=48+96=144, [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=48, y=8: similarly, y=8, tail=1+48*2=97? T=48, Δt=48-45=3, tail_T=1 +48*3=1+144=145, head=48+144=192, all large, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=49, y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn T=49 with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to a_{48}, since a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, t1=45, H=5, so actions at 45,46,47,48, position at turn 49=9.\n\nBut at T=47 and T=48, if we were on lower freeways, it might be unsafe, but here on y=7 and y=8, safe.\n\nIn this path, at T=47, y=7, safe; T=48, y=8, safe.\n\nWhat about T=45 and T=46: y=5 and y=6, both safe as above.\n\nT=45 y=5 safe, T=46 y=6 safe.\n\nSo with H=5, moving up each time: actions U,U,U,U from T=45 to 48.\n\nSequence: a_{45}=U, a_{46}=U, a_{47}=U, a_{48}=U, then at turn 49, y=9.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nEarlier I thought about y=5 being unsafe at T=47 and 48, but in this path, at T=47, we are at y=7, not on y=5, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=48, y=8.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision times.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe at T=47 and 48.\n\nBut if player is not on y=5 at those times, no issue.\n\nIn this case, player leaves y=5 at T=45 by moving up, so at T=46, on y=6, not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIs there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can do it in 4 moves, but with H=5 turns of actions? H is the number of actions.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to increase by 4, with moves of +1, min H=4 actions? But let's see.\n\nWith H actions, we go from turn t1 to position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{45} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1 + k} ? Better not.\n\nSet S = t1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\ny_S = y_{45} + sum_{T=45}^{S-1} Δy_T\n\nThe number of Δy terms is S - 45.\n\ny_S - y_45 =4, so sum of (S-45) terms, each in {-1,0,1}, sum to 4.\n\nMinimal when all +1, so S-45=4, S=49.\n\nThen number of terms: S-45=4, so 4 actions, from T=45 to T=48.\n\nThen H such that S = t1 + H -1 =45 + H -1 =49, so 45+H-1=49, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions: a_{45} to a_{48}, four actions.\n\nSequence: t=0 to H-1=4, so a_{45+0} to a_{45+3}, i.e., a45 to a48.\n\nPosition at turn 49: y49=9.\n\nWith all U: a45=U, y46=6; a46=U, y47=7; a47=U, y48=8; a48=U, y49=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=45: y=5, freeway 5, car span at T=45: Δt=0, tail=-23, head=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=46: y=6, freeway 6, car at T=46, Δt=1, tail= -11+36=25, head=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=47: y=7, freeway 7, car at T=47, Δt=2, tail=1+96=97, head=48+96=144, [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=48: y=8, freeway 8, car at T=48, Δt=3, tail=1+144=145, head=48+144=192, [145,192], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=49: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collisions, and we reach in 4 actions, H=5? H=5 means 5 actions? No.\n\nH is the number of turns, which is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nSequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, with 4 actions, we reach y49=9 at turn 49.\n\nt1 + H -1 =45 + H -1.\n\nSet to 49: 45 + H -1 =49, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nBut with 4 actions, we have H=4? Let's see.\n\nIf H=4, then actions from t=0 to 3, a_{45} to a_{47}.\n\nThen position at turn t1 + H -1 =45 +4 -1=48 should be 9.\n\ny_{48} = y_45 + Δy_45 + Δy_46 + Δy_47\n\nIf all U, y48 =5 +1+1+1=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 48, we need y48=9.\n\ny48 = y45 + Δy45 + Δy46 + Δy47\n\nSet to 9, 5 + sum =9, so sum of three Δy must be 4, impossible since each <=1, max sum 3.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 in fewer than 4 steps from y45=5.\n\nMinimal: with 4 actions, we can reach y49=9.\n\nWith 3 actions, y48 <= 5+3=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 5, with 4 actions? H=5 means 5 actions? Confusion.\n\nH is defined as the number of turns, and the sequence has H actions.\n\nIn the sum, to go from y45 to y49, we need actions at 45,46,47,48, that's 4 actions.\n\nThen H should be 4 for the number of actions.\n\nBut in the target, t1 + H -1 =45 + H -1 =49, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nPerhaps H includes the starting point or something.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n\"to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo for t1=45, y_{45 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith y45=5, so 45 + H -1 must be at least 49, since y49=9 with U,U,U,U.\n\ny49=9, so 45 + H -1 =49, thus H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen the sequence has H=5 actions: t from 0 to 4, so a45 to a49? t=0: a_{45+0}=a45, t=1: a46, ..., t=4: a_{45+4}=a49.\n\nBut with actions a45 to a49, that's 5 actions, position at turn 50: y50 = y45 + Δy45 to Δy49.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{45+5-1}=y49=9.\n\nSo if we have actions a45 to a49, y50 is set, but we care about y49.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nSo after a49, y50 is set.\n\nBut position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn 49, y49 is the position before action a49.\n\nTo have y49=9, we need to reach y=9 at turn 49.\n\nWith actions from a45 to a48, we set y46 to y49.\n\nSpecifically: after a45, y46; after a46, y47; after a47, y48; after a48, y49.\n\nSo with four actions: a45,a46,a47,a48, we can set y49=9 by all U.\n\nThen y49=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H, we have actions from t=0 to H-1, so if H=5, it would include a45 to a49, but a49 would affect y50, which is not needed.\n\nBut we only need up to a48 to set y49.\n\nThe last action is a_{t1 + H -1}, and after that, position at turn t1 + H -1 is set? Let's see.\n\nThe position y_{t1 + H -1} is determined by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}, I think.\n\nFrom the sequence: actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} are applied.\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} is set.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-2}, y_{t1+H-1} set.\n\nThen we apply a_{t1+H-1}, which would set y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nBut for position at turn t1+H-1, it is set before a_{t1+H-1} is applied.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a_{t1+H-1}, but it affects the next position, not the current.\n\nFor y_{t1+H-1} to be 9, it depends on actions up to a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nSo in the sequence, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2} to reach y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThen a_{t1+H-1} is the last action, but since we reached the goal at turn t1+H-1, perhaps we don't need to specify action beyond, but the sequence includes it.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in this case, with H=5, sequence a45 to a49, but for y49 to be 9, we need actions a45 to a48 set y49=9, and a49 can be anything, but since we reached at turn 49, a49 is not necessary, but the sequence includes H actions.\n\nPerhaps for the last turn, when we are at y=9, we can choose S or something.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nMinimal H: we need y_S =9 for S=45 + H -1.\n\ny_S = y45 + sum_{T=45}^{S-1} Δy_T\n\nNumber of Δy terms: from T=45 to S-1, that's (S-45) terms.\n\ny_S - y45 =4, so sum of (S-45) terms =4.\n\nMinimal S-45 when all Δy=1, so S-45=4, S=49.\n\nThen number of actions: S-45=4, actions at T=45,46,47,48.\n\nThen S = t1 + H -1 =49, so 45 + H -1 =49, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen the sequence has H=5 actions: a45,a46,a47,a48,a49.\n\nBut with a45 to a48 all U, y49=9.\n\nThen at turn 49, we are at y=9, so action a49 can be S, for example, since we don't need to move.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at turn 49, y=9, no freeway, safe, so a49=S is fine.\n\nWe can have a49=S, but it adds an extra action.\n\nTo have exactly H=4, but S = t1 + H -1 =45 + H -1.\n\nSet y_{45+H-1}=9.\n\nIf H=4, S=45+4-1=48, y48=9.\n\ny48 = y45 + Δy45 + Δy46 + Δy47\n\nSet to 9, 5 + sum_{45,46,47} Δy =9, so sum=4, but only three terms, each <=1, max sum=3<4, impossible.\n\nSo cannot with H=4.\n\nWith H=5, S=45+5-1=49, y49=9, achievable with four U actions, but H=5 actions.\n\nThe fifth action a49 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to specify all actions.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, since we need to reach at turn 49, H=5 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier with different moves, but from y=5 to y=9, min 4 steps, turn 49.\n\nIf we move faster, but we can only move +1 per action, so no, min 4 actions to increase by 4.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal for the number of turns in the sequence.\n\nNow back to the path: with all U, it seems safe, but let's confirm if at any point we are on a freeway when 0 is covered.\n\nIn the plan: actions a45=U, then at turn 46: y=6\n\na46=U, turn 47: y=7\n\na47=U, turn 48: y=8\n\na48=U, turn 49: y=9\n\nCollision checks:\n\nTurn 45: y=5, freeway 5, car: at T=45, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 46: y=6, freeway 6, car at T=46: Δt=1, span [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 47: y=7, freeway 7, car at T=47: Δt=2, span [1+96, 48+96]= [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 48: y=8, freeway 8, car at T=48: similarly, [1+144,48+144]= [145,192], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 49: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut why are there freeways 1-4 with unsafe times? Since we are not on them, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is only unsafe at T=45, but we are on it at T=46, safe.\n\nSo it seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem might be that at T=47 and 48, freeways 2-5 are unsafe, but we are on higher freeways.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we stay or move down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 5 with actions U,U,U,U,S or something, but since we reach at turn 49, and action at turn 49 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence for H=5: actions at t=0,1,2,3,4: a45,a46,a47,a48,a49.\n\nWith a45=U, a46=U, a47=U, a48=U, a49=S.\n\nThen positions: after a45, y46=6; after a46, y47=7; after a47, y48=8; after a48, y49=9; after a49, y50=9 (if S).\n\nBut at turn 49, we are at y=9, so goal reached.\n\nWe could have a49=U, but y=9, if U, y50=10, but y=10 invalid, since y in 0-9, so must stay or something, but the move is clipped, y_{t+1} = clip(y_t + Δy, 0,9), but in this case, from y=9, U would be clipped to 9, I assume.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if out of bound, it should be clipped.\n\nBut in the problem, it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if move up from 9, it stays 9.\n\nSimilarly for down from 0.\n\nSo a49 can be U, but y50=9, same as S.\n\nBut to be safe, S is fine.\n\nNow, but in this sequence, at turn 47 and 48, we are on y=7 and y=8, safe.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we might be on unsafe freeway.\n\nFor example, if we delay, we might be on y=5 at T=47, which is unsafe.\n\nBut in this path, we move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps we can move faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=6 at T=45 is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nH=5, actions: a45=U, a46=U, a47=U, a48=U, a49=S or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1=4.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 6: at T=45, covered, but we not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider when moving, but the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for example, if at turn T, you choose U, you move to y_{T+1}=y_T +1, but at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision checked on y_T at T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, on y_{T+1}, checked on that.\n\nSo in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, if we stay at T=45, then at T=46, if on y=5, is it safe?\n\nAt T=46, for y=5: car at T=46, Δt=1, tail_T= -23 +6*1= -17, head_T= -12 +6= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=47: tail= -23+12= -11, head= -12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nSo if on y=5 at T=47, collision.\n\nBut in our path, we are not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps the player can move down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think with H=5, actions U,U,U,U,S is fine.\n\nBut to have minimal, since with four actions we reach, but we need H=5 for the turn count.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=4 but not reaching y=9, but we must reach.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: start by staying or moving down to avoid the unsafe times, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=5 for some turns, we have to avoid T=47 and 48.\n\nAt T=45: safe, T=46: safe as above (span [-17,-6]), T=47: unsafe, T=48: unsafe.\n\nT=49: for y=5, car at T=49, Δt=4, tail= -23+24=1, head= -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe again.\n\nSo if we stay at y=5 until T=46, then move, but we need to go up.\n\nBut it would take more turns.\n\nFor example: at T=45, S, then y46=5 (still)\n\nThen at T=46, S or move.\n\nBut at T=46, y=5 safe.\n\nThen at T=47, if on y=5, unsafe, so we must not be on y=5 at T=47.\n\nSo at T=46, we need to move, either U or D.\n\nIf U, to y=6 at T=47.\n\ny=6 at T=47: Δt=2, tail= -11+72=61? T=47, Δt=47-45=2, y=6 car: tail_T= -11 +36*2= -11+72=61, head=24+72=96, [61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we can go up from there.\n\nBut from y=5 at T=46, we move to y=6 at T=47, then need to go to y=9, still need 3 more up moves, to reach y=9 at turn 50, for example.\n\nActions: T=45: S, y46=5\n\nT=46: U, y47=6\n\nT=47: U, y48=7\n\nT=48: U, y49=8\n\nT=49: U, y50=9\n\nThen S=50, t1+H-1=45+H-1=50, H-1=5, H=6, worse than before.\n\nIf we move down, but y=4 might be unsafe at T=47,48.\n\ny=4 at T=47: car on y=4, same as y=5, covered at T=47,48.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the direct up is fastest.\n\nPerhaps we can move up faster, but cannot.\n\nSo I think H=5 with four U and one S is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=5, we have five actions, but only four are needed to move, the last can be S.\n\nPerhaps we can have only four actions with H=4, but earlier we saw impossible.\n\nt1+H-1=45+H-1=48 for H=4, y48=9 impossible.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the actions, we can have a45=U, a46=U, a47=U, a48=U, a49=S.\n\nBut at turn 49, we are at y=9, so a49=S is fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but we must have H actions.\n\nIn the collision, since we reach at turn 49, and action at turn 49 doesn't affect position at turn 49.\n\nBut we have to include it.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6 at T=45.\n\nThe car state says for k=6: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nAt T=45, span [-11,24], which includes 0, so if player on y=6 at T=45, collision, but player not.\n\nIn our move, we go to y=6 at T=46, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps there is a car on y=8 or something, but no.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but at T=47, when we are on y=7, car is far away.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\"\n\netc.\n\nFor t1=45.\n\nWith H=5.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: S  (since we are at y=9, stay)\n\nBut at turn 49, after action S, y50=9, but we are already at y=9 at turn 49.\n\nIn the sequence, it includes action at turn 49.\n\nTo make it consistent, we can have all U, but at turn 49, if we do U, y50= min(9+1,9)=9, same as S.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the minimal, since H=5, we have to have five actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by starting from different position, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the player can move to y=4 or something, but that would take longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, go down to y=4, but y=4 unsafe at T=47,48, same issue.\n\nOr go to y=0, but then need to come up, more turns.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSo I think direct up is best.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nSequence: a45=U, a46=U, a47=U, a48=U, a49=S\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 6 has head=24, tail=-11, so at T=45, [ -11,24], includes 0.\n\nBut we not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for the given t1.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 45\\) is 5. This is achieved with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- At turn 45, move up (U) to position \\(y_{46} = 6\\).\n- At turn 46, move up (U) to position \\(y_{47} = 7\\).\n- At turn 47, move up (U) to position \\(y_{48} = 8\\).\n- At turn 48, move up (U) to position \\(y_{49} = 9\\).\n- At turn 49, the position \\(y_{49} = 9\\) is reached, so stay (S) is used for the final action, keeping \\(y_{50} = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), as verified below for each turn when the player is on a freeway:\n\n- **Turn 45 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 car span at \\(T=45\\) is \\([-23, -12]\\), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 46 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 car span at \\(T=46\\) (with \\(\\Delta t = 1\\)) is \\([-11 + 36 \\times 1, 24 + 36 \\times 1] = [25, 60]\\), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 47 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 car span at \\(T=47\\) (with \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)) is \\([1 + 48 \\times 2, 48 + 48 \\times 2] = [97, 144]\\), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 48 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 car span at \\(T=48\\) (with \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)) is \\([1 + 48 \\times 3, 48 + 48 \\times 3] = [145, 192]\\), which does not include 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 49 (\\(y = 9\\))**: No freeway, so no collision possible. Safe.\n\nThe actions are chosen to minimize \\(H\\), and any deviation (e.g., staying or moving down) would require more turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) while avoiding unsafe times on lower freeways (e.g., freeways 2-5 are unsafe at turns 47 and 48).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ } S }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=48, and I need to get to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y no change). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for each freeway at turn t1=48. For each car, it has head h, tail τ, direction d, and speed s. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving. From the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so for left-moving, h and τ decrease over time.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so h and τ increase over time.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1, it says (48,37,right,12). Since it's right-moving, head is 48, tail is 37? That might be a notation issue. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12). But according to the span definition for right-moving, it should be [τ, h], so τ is the left end and h is the right end? Let's see the update.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], which I think means from τ to h, with τ < h since it's moving right. But here, for freeway 1, head=48, tail=37, and since it's right-moving, τ should be the left end, so τ=37, h=48? But it's listed as (head h, tail τ), so h=48, τ=37, and direction right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? But in the notation, it says head and tail, but in the update, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ and h, but which is which?\n\nI think there might be inconsistency. Let me read the car update carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which suggests h is left, τ is right, since it moves left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is left, h is right, since it moves right, τ increases, h increases.\n\nBut in the table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ), so for both directions, head and tail are defined, but the span depends on direction.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48,37,right,12). Since direction is right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], so left end 37, right end 48.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the car's span at that turn. That is, if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for the car on freeway k, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn this case, player starts at y=0 at t1=48.\n\nI need to get to y=9, which is the top, no cars there, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8, avoiding times when for the car on that row, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nLet me first list all the cars and their spans at time t, relative to t1=48.\n\nSet t1=48, so for any time T, Δt = T - t1.\n\nThen for each car, Span(T) depends on Δt.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12)\n\nSince right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nWith Δt = T - 48.\n\nCollision if player is on y=1 at turn T and 0 in [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6)\n\nDirection right, so Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6) identical to k=2.\n\nIn the table, k=2 and k=3 both say (-48,-59,right,6), same for k=4 and k=5? Let me check.\n\nTable:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (48,37,right,12) |\n\n| 2 | (-48,-59,right,6) |\n\n| 3 | (-48,-59,right,6) | same as 2\n\n| 4 | (-48,-59,right,6) | same\n\n| 5 | (-48,-59,right,6) | same\n\n| 6 | (-48,-83,right,36) |\n\n| 7 | (-48,-95,right,48) |\n\n| 8 | (-48,-95,right,48) | same as 7\n\nk=2,3,4,5 all have identical cars? But each freeway has one car, I assume, since it says \"cars\" but for each freeway, it's one entry, so one car per freeway.\n\nk=1 has one car, k=2 has one, etc. But k=2,3,4,5 all have the same parameters: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6. Similarly k=7 and 8 same.\n\nBut they are on different freeways, so we need to consider each separately.\n\nFor freeway 2: car with Span(T) = [-59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt]\n\nSimilarly for k=3,4,5: same span, since same parameters.\n\nk=6: (h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36)\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-83 + 36 Δt, -48 + 36 Δt]\n\nk=7: (h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48)\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-95 + 48 Δt, -48 + 48 Δt]\n\nk=8: same as k=7.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for k, 0 ∈ [left, right] at time T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and spans are moving right.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at T=48.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but since I need to go up, probably mostly U, but I can go down or stay to avoid collisions.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimal without obstacles is 9 turns, all U. But with cars, I might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut y can only be between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the car span, meaning when collision would occur if player is on that row at that time.\n\nFor each freeway k, find the times T when 0 ∈ Span_k(T)\n\nSince T is turn, integer, and Δt = T - 48.\n\nSet τ = T - 48, so τ >=0 for future turns.\n\nFor k=1: Span(T) = [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ] where τ = T-48\n\n0 ∈ [37+12τ, 48+12τ] iff 37+12τ <= 0 <= 48+12τ\n\nSince 37+12τ >0 for τ>=0? 37+12*0=37>0, and increases, so 37+12τ >=37>0, so 0 < left end, so 0 never in span for k=1. Because left end is 37 at τ=0, and increases.\n\n[37+12τ, 48+12τ], min at τ=0: [37,48], all positive, and increases, so always positive, so 0 never in this interval. So for freeway 1, no collision possible at any time, because the car is always to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: Span(T) = [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\n0 ∈ [-59+6τ, -48+6τ] iff -59+6τ <= 0 <= -48+6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -59+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so τ <=9 since integer? τ is integer, turns.\n\nT integer, τ integer.\n\n-59+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <= floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +6τ => 48 <=6τ => τ >= 48/6 =8\n\nSo both: τ >=8 and τ <=9\n\nThus for τ=8 and τ=9, 0 in span.\n\nτ= T-48, so T=48+8=56 and T=48+9=57\n\nSimilarly for k=3,4,5: same as k=2, since same car parameters.\n\nk=2,3,4,5 all have same, so for each, collision at T=56 and T=57 if on that row.\n\nNow k=6: Span(T) = [-83 +36τ, -48 +36τ]\n\n0 ∈ [-83+36τ, -48+36τ] iff -83+36τ <=0 <= -48+36τ\n\nFirst: -83+36τ <=0 => 36τ <=83 => τ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so τ <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+36τ => 48 <=36τ => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ >=2 since τ integer? τ >= ceil(4/3)=2\n\nτ >=2 and τ <=2, so only τ=2\n\nThus T=48+2=50\n\nNow k=7: Span(T) = [-95 +48τ, -48 +48τ]\n\n0 ∈ [-95+48τ, -48+48τ] iff -95+48τ <=0 <= -48+48τ\n\nFirst: -95+48τ <=0 => 48τ <=95 => τ <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so τ <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+48τ => 48 <=48τ => τ >=1\n\nSo τ >=1 and τ <=1, thus τ=1\n\nT=48+1=49\n\nSimilarly for k=8, same as k=7, collision at T=49\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each row:\n\n- Freeway 1: never dangerous, car never at 0.\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous at T=56 and T=57\n\n- Freeway 3: same as 2, dangerous at T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 4: same, T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 5: same, T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at T=50\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at T=49\n\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at T=49\n\nNote that for rows with multiple dangerous times, but each row has its own car.\n\nPlayer needs to not be on row k at time T when k is dangerous at T.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt T=49, rows 7 and 8 are dangerous. If player on y=7 or y=8 at T=49, collision.\n\nAt T=50, row 6 is dangerous.\n\nAt T=56 and 57, rows 2,3,4,5 are dangerous. Since k=2,3,4,5 all dangerous at same times.\n\nT=56 and 57.\n\nNow, other times, no danger except these.\n\nPlayer starts at T=48, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, I can move U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, minimal steps without obstacles is 9 moves of U.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times: T=49,50,56,57.\n\nT=49: avoid y=7 and y=8\n\nT=50: avoid y=6\n\nT=56: avoid y=2,3,4,5\n\nT=57: avoid y=2,3,4,5\n\nAt other times, all rows are safe, since no other dangerous points.\n\nFor example, at T=48, player is at y=0, which is safe, no cars there.\n\nNow, I need to plan the sequence of actions from T=48 onwards.\n\nSet T=48: y=0\n\nI need to choose actions for t=0 to H-1, where t is offset from t1, so at time t1+t.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nStart: T=48, y=0\n\nFirst action at T=48: a_{48}, which determines y_{49}\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe minimal H might be more than 9 if I have to wait.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by T=57 or something.\n\nSince the dangerous times are early and late, I might go quickly or wait.\n\nFirst, at T=49, I need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly at T=50, not on y=6.\n\nAt T=56 and 57, not on y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 are all dangerous at T=56 and 57.\n\nTo avoid, I should not be on rows 2-5 at T=56 and 57.\n\nSimilarly, at T=49, avoid y=7,8; T=50 avoid y=6.\n\nNow, since I need to go up, I can try to be above the dangerous rows early or something.\n\nLet me think about the position over time.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nThe earliest possible: if I go up every turn, I can be at y=9 at T=48+9=57? Start T=48 y=0, after one U: T=49 y=1, T=50 y=2, ..., up to T=57 y=9.\n\nBut let's see if this causes collisions.\n\nAt T=49, y=1? If I go U at T=48, then at T=49, y=1.\n\nBut at T=49, dangerous rows are y=7 and 8, y=1 is safe, so ok.\n\nAt T=50, y=2 (if I go U again), dangerous row is y=6, y=2 is safe, so ok.\n\nThen continue: T=51 y=3, T=52 y=4, T=53 y=5, T=54 y=6, T=55 y=7, T=56 y=8, T=57 y=9.\n\nNow, at T=56, y=8, but at T=56, dangerous rows are y=2,3,4,5, not y=8. y=8 is row 8, which is dangerous only at T=49, not at T=56.\n\nAt T=56, only rows 2-5 are dangerous.\n\nSimilarly at T=57, rows 2-5 dangerous.\n\nIn this path, at T=56, y=8, which is not dangerous, so ok.\n\nAt T=57, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at T=54, y=6, is that dangerous? At T=54, no dangerous time, since dangerous times are only T=49,50,56,57.\n\nT=50 is dangerous for y=6, but T=54 is not T=50, so y=6 is safe at T=54.\n\nSimilarly, all other times safe.\n\nIn this sequence, I go directly to y=9 in 9 turns, arriving at T=57.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart T=48, y=0\n\nAction U: then T=49, y=1\n\nU: T=50, y=2\n\nU: T=51, y=3\n\nU: T=52, y=4\n\nU: T=53, y=5\n\nU: T=54, y=6\n\nU: T=55, y=7\n\nU: T=56, y=8\n\nU: T=57, y=9\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nAt T=49: y=1, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nAt T=50: y=2, not 6, safe. (dangerous is y=6 at T=50)\n\nAt T=56: y=8, not in 2-5, safe.\n\nAt T=57: y=9, safe.\n\nOther times, no issues.\n\nIs there any problem? What about row 6 at other times? At T=50, y=6 is dangerous, but here at T=50, y=2, not 6.\n\nAt T=54, y=6, but T=54 is not dangerous for any row, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the minimal H should be the number of actions to reach, so from T=48 to T=57, that's 9 actions? Let's see.\n\nTime: actions at T=48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56, and at T=57, y=9, so after 9 actions, I reach at T=57.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=0 to t=8, since t=0: action at t1+0=48, t=1:49, ..., t=8:56, then y at T=57 is after action at T=56.\n\nThe position after action at time T is y_{T+1}? No.\n\nGame dynamics: player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAnd action at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, you take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t, position is y_t, then action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn this case, at time t1=48, position is (0, y_{48}) = (0,0)\n\nThen action a_{48} determines y_{49}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\" or what?\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after these H actions, we should be at (0,9).\n\nAfter action at time t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after action at time t1 + H - 1, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe turn when we reach (0,9) is t1 + H.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions from t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nIn the path above, if I start at T=48 y=0, after 9 actions: actions at T=48 to T=56, then y at T=57 should be 9.\n\ny_{57} = 9.\n\nWith actions: a_{48} to a_{56}, all U.\n\nNow, at each step, the position at time T is y_T.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, if player is on freeway y_T = k, and for that k, 0 in span at T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt T=48: y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nAfter a_{48}=U, y_{49}=1\n\nAt T=49: y=1, freeway 1, but as we saw, no danger, safe.\n\nAfter a_{49}=U, y_{50}=2\n\nAt T=50: y=2, freeway 2. Now, freeway 2 is dangerous at T=56 and 57, but not at T=50. At T=50, for k=2, is 0 in span? Earlier we have for k=2, dangerous at T=56,57 only. At T=50, τ=T-48=2, Span(T)= [-59 +6*2, -48 +6*2] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], which is negative, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at T=50 is safe.\n\nThen continue: a_{50}=U, y_{51}=3\n\nAt T=51: y=3, freeway 3. Span for k=3 at T=51: Δt=3, [-59+6*3, -48+6*3]=[-59+18,-48+18]=[-41,-30], negative, safe.\n\na_{51}=U, y_{52}=4\n\nT=52: y=4, k=4, span [-59+6*4,-48+24]=[-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], negative, safe.\n\na_{52}=U, y_{53}=5\n\nT=53: y=5, k=5, span [-59+30,-48+30]=[-29,-18], negative, safe.\n\na_{53}=U, y_{54}=6\n\nT=54: y=6, k=6. Now, freeway 6 dangerous at T=50. At T=54, Δt=6, span [-83+36*6, -48+36*6]=[-83+216, -48+216]=[133,168], positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\na_{54}=U, y_{55}=7\n\nT=55: y=7, k=7. Dangerous at T=49. At T=55, Δt=7, span [-95+48*7, -48+48*7]=[-95+336, -48+336]=[241,288], positive, safe.\n\na_{55}=U, y_{56}=8\n\nT=56: y=8, k=8. Dangerous at T=49. At T=56, Δt=8, span for k=8 same as k=7, [-95+48*8, -48+384]=[-95+384,336]=[289,336], positive, safe.\n\nBut at T=56, rows 2-5 are dangerous, but y=8 is not among them, so safe.\n\nThen a_{56}=U, y_{57}=9\n\nAt T=57: y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at T=57.\n\nSo with 9 actions, all U, starting from T=48 to T=56, we reach at T=57.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9, since we need H actions to go from y=0 to y=9, minimal is 9, and we achieved it without issues.\n\nBut earlier I thought about dangerous times, but in this path, we didn't hit any dangerous situation.\n\nSpecifically, at T=49, we were at y=1, not 7 or 8.\n\nAt T=50, we were at y=2, not 6.\n\nAt T=56, we were at y=8, not 2-5.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times again.\n\nAt T=49: dangerous rows y=7 and 8.\n\nWe were at y=1, safe.\n\nAt T=50: dangerous row y=6, we were at y=2, safe.\n\nAt T=56: dangerous rows y=2,3,4,5, we were at y=8, safe.\n\nAt T=57: dangerous rows y=2,3,4,5, we would be at y=9, but after action, or at turn T=57 position.\n\nAt T=57, if we are at y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=57, after action, y=9.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nIn this case, all safe.\n\nPerhaps for other rows, but no other dangers.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought k=1 is always safe, which it is.\n\nk=6 at T=50 dangerous, but we not there.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nThen after first U, at T=49, y=1, which is freeway 1, but safe as we saw.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier.\n\nIf I start at T=48 y=0, after one action, T=49, y can be 1 (U) or 0 (S) or -1 but y=0 min, so D not possible? y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D would make y_{t+1}=-1, not allowed, so at y=0, cannot go D, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot go U.\n\nBut here, to reach faster, from y=0, I need to increase y.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9: if I go U every turn, I reach y=9 at T=57, as above.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay, y stays 0, not helpful.\n\nOr go down, but cannot at y=0.\n\nSo minimal time to reach is 9 turns after start, arriving at T=57.\n\nWith H=9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from T=48 to T=56.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +8: U\n\nSince H=9, t from 0 to 8.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1=8.\n\nSo actions at turns 48 to 56, all U.\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars?\n\nFor example, at T=50, we are at y=2, but freeway 2 is not dangerous at T=50, only at 56 and 57.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if for some row, the car is present at other times, but from the spans, only at specific times 0 is covered.\n\nFor instance, freeway 1: never, as span always positive.\n\nFreeway 2: span at T=50: as above, [-47,-36], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, at T=50 dangerous, but we avoid by not being there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that multiple rows have the same danger times.\n\nBut in this case, no problem.\n\nMaybe I can go slower to avoid, but no need, since minimal is achieved.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be boxed with the actions.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nBut the player is at (0,0) initially, and after actions, reaches (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn T | y_T | action a_T | y_{T+1}\n\nT=48: y=0, action a_48=U, then y_49=1\n\nT=49: y=1, action U, y_50=2\n\nT=50: y=2, action U, y_51=3\n\nT=51: y=3, action U, y_52=4\n\nT=52: y=4, action U, y_53=5\n\nT=53: y=5, action U, y_54=6\n\nT=54: y=6, action U, y_55=7\n\nT=55: y=7, action U, y_56=8\n\nT=56: y=8, action U, y_57=9\n\nNow, collision check at each T:\n\nT=48: y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nT=49: y=1, on freeway 1, span [37+12*1? Δt=T-t1=T-48, at T=49, Δt=1, span [37+12*1, 48+12*1]=[49,60], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=50: y=2, freeway 2, span [-59+6*2, -48+12]=[-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], not include 0, safe.\n\nT=51: y=3, freeway 3, span same as above, since same car, [-59+6*3,-48+18]=[-59+18,-30]=[-41,-30], not 0.\n\nT=52: y=4, freeway 4, span [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], not 0.\n\nT=53: y=5, freeway 5, span [-59+30,-48+30]=[-29,-18], not 0.\n\nT=54: y=6, freeway 6, span [-83+36*6, -48+216]=[-83+216,168]=[133,168], not 0, safe.\n\nT=55: y=7, freeway 7, span [-95+48*7, -48+336]=[-95+336,288]=[241,288], not 0, safe.\n\nT=56: y=8, freeway 8, span same as 7, [-95+48*8, -48+384]=[-95+384,336]=[289,336], not 0, safe.\n\nT=57: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached.\n\nSo no issues.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from turn 48 to 56.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 48: U \\\\ Turn 49: U \\\\ Turn 50: U \\\\ Turn 51: U \\\\ Turn 52: U \\\\ Turn 53: U \\\\ Turn 54: U \\\\ Turn 55: U \\\\ Turn 56: U }\n\nSince t1=48, and H=9, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to 8.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for each turn.\n\nBut in the box, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it as per the format.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No, since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so minimum 9 actions.\n\nIf I stay or go down, it would take more turns, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, it was dangerous at T=50, but we were not there, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\nThe cars on each freeway have specific times when their spans include position 0, causing a collision if the player is on that freeway at that turn. The hazardous times are:\n- **Freeway 7 and 8**: Hazardous at \\(T = 49\\) (since \\(\\Delta t = T - 48 = 1\\), and the span includes 0).\n- **Freeway 6**: Hazardous at \\(T = 50\\) (since \\(\\Delta t = 2\\), and the span includes 0).\n- **Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5**: Hazardous at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(T = 57\\) (since \\(\\Delta t = 8\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 9\\), and the span includes 0 for each).\n- **Freeway 1**: Never hazardous, as the car span is always positive and never includes 0.\n\nThus, the player must avoid:\n- \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 49\\),\n- \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 50\\),\n- \\(y = 2, 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(T = 57\\).\n\n### Minimal Path to (0, 9)\nThe minimal number of turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\) is 9, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1. A sequence of 9 consecutive \"U\" actions achieves this:\n- Start at \\(T = 48\\), \\(y = 0\\).\n- After first \"U\" at \\(T = 48\\), \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 49\\).\n- Continue \"U\" each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 57\\).\n\nThis path avoids all hazards:\n- At \\(T = 49\\), \\(y = 1\\) (not 7 or 8), safe.\n- At \\(T = 50\\), \\(y = 2\\) (not 6), safe.\n- At \\(T = 56\\), \\(y = 8\\) (not 2-5), safe.\n- At \\(T = 57\\), \\(y = 9\\) (not on freeway), safe.\n\nAll other turns and positions are safe, as no hazards exist outside the specified times. Since 9 is the minimum possible \\(H\\) (as \\(y\\) must increase by 9), this sequence is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 8\\) (i.e., turns 48 to 56) is all \"U\". After the last action at \\(T = 56\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 57\\).\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 48: U \\\\ Turn 49: U \\\\ Turn 50: U \\\\ Turn 51: U \\\\ Turn 52: U \\\\ Turn 53: U \\\\ Turn 54: U \\\\ Turn 55: U \\\\ Turn 56: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 49, and I'm at y=1. I have to find a sequence of actions—U for up, D for down, or S for stay—that gets me to y=9 without getting hit by any car when I'm on a freeway row.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. Each car is defined by its head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], and for left-moving, it's [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]. But looking at the car states, all cars are right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all. Let me confirm:\n\n- Freeway 1: (60,49,right,12) — head=60, tail=49? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, if head is 60 and tail is 49, that means the car is from 49 to 60, so length 11, and moving right. But at time t_1=49, the span is [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right-moving, head should be the right end, tail the left end, so Span = [tail, head].\n\nIn freeway 1: head=60, tail=49, right, s=12. So at t_1, Span = [49,60] since right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, others: freeway 2: head=-42, tail=-53, right, s=6. Head=-42, tail=-53, so tail is smaller, so Span = [-53, -42]? But direction is right, so as time increases, it moves to higher indices.\n\nLet me denote t_1 = 49 for simplicity.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y at that turn, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at time T. That is, if the car covers position 0 at time T.\n\nPosition 0 is the x-coordinate where I am, since I'm always at x=0.\n\nI start at (0,1) at turn t_1=49.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny ranges from 0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and before that, I might be on the freeways.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1, so after H actions, I'm at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 in car span on freeway k at time T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I go to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at T.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at a row, it's at the next turn.\n\nLet me list the car spans over time.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to see when a car covers position 0.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and span moves right with speed s.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nCollision if 0 is in [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)].\n\nSince τ and h are given at t_1.\n\nt_1 = 49.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, head h=60, tail τ=49, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 12(T-49), 60 + 12(T-49)]\n\nSet 0 in [49 + 12(T-49), 60 + 12(T-49)]\n\nSo 49 + 12(T-49) ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 12(T-49)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: 49 + 12(T-49) ≤ 0 ⇒ 12(T-49) ≤ -49 ⇒ T-49 ≤ -49/12 ≈ -4.083, so T ≤ 49 - 4.083 = 44.917, so T ≤ 44 since T integer? Turns are integers, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 ≤ 60 + 12(T-49) ⇒ -60 ≤ 12(T-49) ⇒ T-49 ≥ -60/12 = -5, so T ≥ 49 - 5 = 44.\n\nFrom left: 49 + 12(T-49) ≤ 0 ⇒ 12(T-49) ≤ -49 ⇒ T-49 ≤ -49/12 = -49/12 = -4.0833, so T ≤ 49 - 4.0833 = 44.9167, so T ≤ 44.\n\nFrom right: 0 ≤ 60 + 12(T-49) ⇒ 12(T-49) ≥ -60 ⇒ T-49 ≥ -5, so T ≥ 44.\n\nT ≤ 44 and T ≥ 44, so T=44.\n\nAt T=44, left end: 49 + 12(44-49) = 49 + 12(-5) = 49 - 60 = -11\n\nRight end: 60 + 12(-5) = 60 - 60 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, yes.\n\nFor T=45: left: 49 + 12(45-49) = 49 + 12(-4) = 49 - 48 = 1\n\nRight: 60 + 12(-4) = 60 - 48 = 12\n\nSo [1,12], 0 not in, so no collision at T=45 or later for freeway 1.\n\nAt T=44, span is [-11,0], so 0 is covered.\n\nBut T=44 is before t_1=49? t_1=49 is current turn, so T=44 is in the past, but we care about future turns from t_1 onwards, I think.\n\nCollision at turn T only if T >= t_1, I assume, since we start from t_1.\n\nThe car update is for T > t_1, but at T=t_1, we have the span as given.\n\nAt turn T=t_1, for freeway 1, span is [49,60], which is all positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nFor T>t_1, as above, only at T=44 it was covered, but 44<49, so for T>=49, 0 not covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=49, span [49,60], 0 not in. For T=50, [49+12(1),60+12(1)]=[61,72], etc., all above 0, so never covers 0 for T>=49. So freeway 1 is safe at all times from t_1 onwards.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, head=-42, tail=-53, s=6, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-53 + 6(T-49), -42 + 6(T-49)]\n\nSet 0 in this interval:\n\n-53 + 6(T-49) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6(T-49)\n\nLeft: -53 + 6(T-49) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(T-49) ≤ 53 ⇒ T-49 ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so T ≤ 49 + 8.833 = 57.833, T <= 57\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -42 + 6(T-49) ⇒ 42 ≤ 6(T-49) ⇒ T-49 ≥ 42/6 = 7, so T ≥ 49 + 7 = 56\n\nThus T from 56 to 57 inclusive.\n\nT=56: left: -53 + 6(56-49) = -53 + 6(7) = -53 + 42 = -11\n\nRight: -42 + 42 = 0\n\nSo [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nT=57: left: -53 + 6(8) = -53 + 48 = -5\n\nRight: -42 + 48 = 6\n\nSo [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nT=58: left: -53 + 6(9) = -53 + 54 =1\n\nRight: -42 + 54 =12\n\n[1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision at T=56 and T=57.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2?

So T=56,57.\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=56,57.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, head=-12, tail=-47, s=36, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-47 + 36(T-49), -12 + 36(T-49)]\n\nSet 0 in:\n\n-47 + 36(T-49) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 36(T-49)\n\nLeft: -47 + 36(T-49) ≤ 0 ⇒ 36(T-49) ≤ 47 ⇒ T-49 ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T ≤ 50.305, T<=50\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -12 + 36(T-49) ⇒ 12 ≤ 36(T-49) ⇒ T-49 ≥ 12/36 = 1/3, so T ≥ 49.333, T>=50 since T integer.\n\nT-49 >= 1/3, so T >= 50 since T integer.\n\nT <=50 and T>=50, so T=50.\n\nAt T=50: left: -47 + 36(1) = -47 + 36 = -11\n\nRight: -12 + 36 = 24\n\nSo [-11,24], 0 covered.\n\nT=49: at t_1, span [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=51: [-47+72, -12+72]= [25,60], not cover 0.\n\nSo only T=50 collision on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, head=0, tail=-47, s=48, right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-49), 0 + 48(T-49)] = [-47 + 48(T-49), 48(T-49)]\n\nSet 0 in:\n\n-47 + 48(T-49) ≤ 0 ≤ 48(T-49)\n\nLeft: -47 + 48(T-49) ≤ 0 ⇒ 48(T-49) ≤ 47 ⇒ T-49 ≤ 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so T ≤ 49.979, T<=49\n\nBut T >= t_1=49, so T=49.\n\nAt T=49: left: -47 + 48(0) = -47? At T=t_1, T-49=0, so span [-47 + 0, 0 + 0] = [-47, 0]\n\n0 is included, since it's [ -47, 0 ], so 0 is covered.\n\nRight end is 0, so yes.\n\nSo at T=49, on freeway 7, collision if I am there.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= 48(T-49), which for T=49 is 0<=0, true.\n\nFor T>49, left: -47 +48(T-49) , at T=50, -47+48=1, right=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nT=49: [-47,0], 0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Head=0, tail=-47, s=48, right. So identical, collision at T=49.\n\nSummary of dangerous times:\n\n- Freeway 1: safe at all T>=49\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 3: same, T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 4: same, T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 5: same, T=56,57\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=50\n\n- Freeway 7: collision at T=49\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at T=49\n\nAt turn T, if I am on freeway k, and k has collision at that T, I get hit.\n\nI start at turn t_1=49, position y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at T=49, since no collision there.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have collision at T=49, but I'm not on them.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H might be small, but I have to avoid the dangerous times on the rows I cross.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, I must pass through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but I can go up or down, but since 9 is up, probably going up is better.\n\ny from 1 to 9, so I need to increase y by 8, so minimal actions: if I go up every turn, I need 8 actions: from y=1 to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in 8 steps.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nWith 8 up moves, I would be at y=9 after 8 turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can do that without collision.\n\nStart at turn 49, y=1.\n\nAction at turn 49: if I do U, then y_{50} = 1 +1 =2\n\nBut at turn 50, I am on y=2? Let's see the position over time.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, I am on y_T, and if y_T = k for k=1-8, and car on k covers 0 at T.\n\nAt turn 49, I am at y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=49, span [49,60], 0 not covered, so safe.\n\nNow, I take action a_{49}.\n\nIf I take U, then y_{50} = 1 +1 =2.\n\nSo at turn 50, I am on y=2.\n\nNow, freeway 2: at T=50, is there collision? From above, freeway 2 has collision only at T=56 and 57, not at 50.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5 same.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=50: span [-53 +6(50-49), -42 +6(1)] = [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=3 at turn 51, etc.\n\nBut I need to go through all.\n\nBut there is freeway 6 with collision at T=50.\n\nIf I am on y=6 at turn 50, I get hit.\n\nIn my path, if I go directly up.\n\nStart:\n\nTurn 49: at y=1, safe as above.\n\nAction a_{49}: U, so y_{50} = 2\n\nAt turn 50, I am on y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=50: as above, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action a_{50}: U, y_{51} =3\n\nAt turn 51, on y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=51: similar, span [-53 +6(51-49), etc.] = [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41,-30], safe.\n\na_{51}: U, y_{52}=4\n\nTurn 52, y=4, freeway 4: [-53 +6(52-49)? T-49=3, -53+18= -35, -42+18= -24, [-35,-24], safe.\n\na_{52}: U, y_{53}=5\n\nTurn 53, y=5, freeway 5: [-53 +6(4) = -53+24= -29, -42+24= -18, [-29,-18], safe.\n\na_{53}: U, y_{54}=6\n\nTurn 54, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=54: span [-47 +36(54-49), -12 +36(5)] = [-47 + 36*5, -12 + 180] = [-47 + 180, 168]? 36*5=180, yes.\n\n-47 + 180 = 133, -12 + 180 = 168, so [133,168], not cover 0, safe.\n\nCollision only at T=50 for freeway 6.\n\na_{54}: U, y_{55}=7\n\nTurn 55, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=55: span [-47 +48(55-49), 48(6)] = [-47 + 288, 288] = [241,288], not cover 0, safe.\n\na_{55}: U, y_{56}=8\n\nTurn 56, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=56: similar to 7, span [-47 +48(56-49), 48(7)] = [-47 + 336, 336] = [289,336], safe? But freeway 8 collision at T=49, but not at T=56.\n\nEarlier freeway 7 and 8 collision at T=49 only.\n\nAt T=56, no.\n\na_{56}: U, y_{57}=9\n\nAt turn 57, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I reached y=9 at turn 57.\n\nBut turn t_1=49, so from turn 49 to 57, that's 8 actions: actions at t=49 to 56, y from 1 to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at turns 50 to 57.\n\nAt turn 57, I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: started turn 49 at y=1, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 49, y=1.\n\nAfter first action a_{49}, at turn 50, y=2.\n\nAfter second action a_{50}, at turn 51, y=3.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 49 + k, y = 1 + k.\n\nTo be at y=9, 1 + k =9, k=8.\n\nSo at turn 49+8=57, y=9.\n\nAnd in this sequence, I was never on a freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at turn 56, I was on y=8, freeway 8, but collision only at T=49, not at 56.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4,5 have collision at T=56 and 57.\n\nIn this path, at turn 56, I am on y=8, not on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nAt turn 57, I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7 at turn 55: I was on y=7, T=55, safe.\n\nIs there any problem?\n\nWhat about freeway 6 at turn 50: I was on y=2 at turn 50, not on y=6.\n\nSo all good.\n\nSo with 8 up actions, I can reach in 8 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? I need to go from y=1 to y=9, difference 8, each up move increases y by 1, so minimum 8 actions. Down or stay would take more, so 8 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, it works without any issue.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: collision at T=49 only.\n\nAt T=49, I was on y=1, not 7 or 8.\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=50, I was on y=2 at T=50.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: collision at T=56 and 57.\n\nAt T=56, I was on y=8.\n\nAt T=57, on y=9.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't, since I need to increase y by 8.\n\nUnless I can skip rows, but no, I have to move one row at a time.\n\nThe move is only to adjacent y or same, so I must change y step by step.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nThe sequence is all U: a_{49} to a_{56} all U.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7} = U\n\nAfter action at t_1+7, at turn t_1+8, y=9.\n\nt_1=49.\n\nSo actions from t=49 to t=56 inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=49 to 56, that's 8 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1 for the actions, so H actions.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with H=8, actions at t=49 to 56, all U.\n\nThen at turn 57, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car states, freeway 2,3,4,5 are all identical and have collision at 56 and 57, but I avoid them.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? No, since 8 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps if I go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I had to avoid something, but in this path, no issue.\n\nBut let me check if at some point I might be forced to stay.\n\nFor instance, at turn 49, if I go up to y=2 at turn 50.\n\nBut at turn 50, freeway 6 has collision, but I'm not on y=6, I'm on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster? No.\n\nAnother thing: y=0 is also available, but since I'm going to 9, going down to 0 would take extra steps, not helpful.\n\nSo I think H=8 with all U is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 3,4,5 are the same as 2, but I don't care since I'm not on them at bad times.\n\nFreeway 6 has collision at T=50, but I'm on y=2 at T=50, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7 and 8.\n\nAt T=49, collision, but I'm on y=1, safe.\n\nIf I were to be on y=7 or 8 at T=49, I would be hit, but I'm not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can go directly but with stay, but that would increase H.\n\nNo need.\n\nSo I think the minimal sequence is all up.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player position is at x=0, and cars move, but since I'm always at x=0, and cars cover x=0 at certain times.\n\nIn the sequence above, it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1, but it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am not on the target row yet.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am on y_T, I take action a_T, then y_{T+1} is set, so at turn T, I am still on y_T.\n\nWhen I go to y_{T+1}, I arrive at turn T+1.\n\nAnd at turn T, if I move to a different row, I am not on that row at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nFor example, at turn 50, I am on y=2, not moving to y=6 or something.\n\nAll fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,1) at turn t_1=49.\n\nAfter actions, at turn 57, (0,9).\n\nWith actions: Turn 49: U, Turn 50: U, ..., Turn 56: U.\n\nSo 8 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so H=8.\n\nActions: a_{49} to a_{56}, all U.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} (U)\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7} (U)\n\nt_1 + H-1 = t_1 +7, since H=8.\n\nH-1=7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but let me write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=8.\n\nSequence: all U.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? That would require increasing y by 8 in 7 moves, but each move can only change by at most 1, so impossible. Minimum 8 moves.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can start by staying or something, but that would only increase H.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 up actions.\n\nBut let me write it in the box.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 3,4,5 are listed, but same as 2, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at some row I need to avoid by not being there, but in this path, I don't hit any danger.\n\nAnother point: at turn 56, I am on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=49 only, not at T=56.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at T=55, safe.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=54, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 49\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The vertical position \\(y\\) must increase from 1 to 9, a difference of 8. Each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, so the minimum number of actions required is 8, as \"D\" or \"S\" actions would increase \\(H\\) without progress.\n- The car positions and collision times were analyzed for each freeway at turns \\(T \\geq 49\\):\n  - Freeway 1: Safe for all \\(T \\geq 49\\) (span never covers 0).\n  - Freeway 2: Collision at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(T = 57\\).\n  - Freeway 3: Collision at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(T = 57\\) (identical to Freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 4: Collision at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(T = 57\\) (identical to Freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 5: Collision at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(T = 57\\) (identical to Freeway 2).\n  - Freeway 6: Collision at \\(T = 50\\) (safe otherwise).\n  - Freeway 7: Collision at \\(T = 49\\) (safe otherwise).\n  - Freeway 8: Collision at \\(T = 49\\) (safe otherwise).\n- A sequence of 8 consecutive \"U\" actions, starting at turn 49, results in the following path:\n  - Turn 49: Start at \\(y = 1\\) (Freeway 1, safe at \\(T = 49\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 50, \\(y = 2\\) (Freeway 2, safe at \\(T = 50\\) since collision only at \\(T = 56\\) and \\(57\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 51, \\(y = 3\\) (Freeway 3, safe at \\(T = 51\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 52, \\(y = 4\\) (Freeway 4, safe at \\(T = 52\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 53, \\(y = 5\\) (Freeway 5, safe at \\(T = 53\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 54, \\(y = 6\\) (Freeway 6, safe at \\(T = 54\\) since collision only at \\(T = 50\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 55, \\(y = 7\\) (Freeway 7, safe at \\(T = 55\\) since collision only at \\(T = 49\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 56, \\(y = 8\\) (Freeway 8, safe at \\(T = 56\\) since collision only at \\(T = 49\\)).\n  - Action \\(U\\): At turn 57, \\(y = 9\\) (no freeway, safe).\n- This path avoids all collisions:\n  - At \\(T = 50\\), when Freeway 6 has a collision, the player is on \\(y = 2\\), not \\(y = 6\\).\n  - At \\(T = 56\\) and \\(57\\), when Freeways 2–5 have collisions, the player is on \\(y = 8\\) (at \\(T = 56\\)) and \\(y = 9\\) (at \\(T = 57\\)), not on the affected freeways.\n- \\(H = 8\\) is minimal because each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, and 8 steps are required to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence consists of 8 \"U\" actions, from turn 49 to turn 56:\n- Turn 49: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 50: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 51: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 52: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 53: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 54: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 55: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 56: \\(U\\)\n\nAt turn 57, the position is (0, 9), achieving the goal in \\(H = 8\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 50, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (each freeway is a horizontal row at y=k).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1 in y), down (D: -1 in y), or stay (S: 0 change). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision rule: At turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is one of the rows 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span (which is moving with time) contains the x-coordinate 0 (the player's x is always 0), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y_T. So the car on the freeway y_T at turn T must not have a car covering x=0. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1} and we check for cars at that row at turn T+1.\n\nThe car movement:\nFor a car at time t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n- Left-moving (d='left'): at time T (>=t1), the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  Note: in the example given for left-moving, the initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that for a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost end? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire segment shifts left. So if h > tau, then the car extends from tau to h? But note the example: \n  The problem states for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] -> then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This suggests that the initial head is at h and tail at tau, and then both decrease by s*(T-t1). So the car moves left.\n\nBut look at the right-moving example: \n  Right-moving: [Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the representation of the span is given as [min, max] for the segment? Not exactly: for left-moving they write [h, tau] and then subtract, but if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? Actually, note the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". Typically, the head is the front. So:\n\nFor left-moving: the head is the front (which is the leftmost part) and the tail is the rear (rightmost). But in the span representation, they write [h, tau]. However, if the car is moving left, then the head (leftmost) is at a smaller x than the tail? Actually, the problem states for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if h < tau, then the segment is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau (with h the left end). But in the example for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> but wait, they have negative numbers? \n\nLet's look at the car data:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\nFreeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 6)\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 6)\nFreeway 4: same\nFreeway 5: same\nFreeway 6: (24, -11, right, 36)   -> note: 24 and -11? then head=24, tail=-11? but if it's right-moving, then the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] meaning [tail, head]? \n\nWait, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). Therefore, the initial span is from tail to head: [tail, head]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost), so the initial span is [head, tail]? But then the example for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> but it says right, so we should use the right-moving rule. Then the initial span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But the problem writes the car as (head, tail, direction, speed). So in the table, the first number is head, the second is tail? \n\nBut for freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right. Then for right-moving, the tail should be the leftmost and head the rightmost. But -48 > -59, so the tail is -59 and head is -48, so the car spans from -59 to -48? That makes sense: the car is at positions from -59 to -48 (so 12 units long: 48-59+1? actually 12 units: from -59 to -48 inclusive is 12 units? -48 - (-59) = 11, so 12 units? Actually, the number of integers from a to b inclusive is |b-a|+1. But the car length is |head - tail|? \n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at time t1, the car covers [tau, h]. Then at time T, it covers [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo in the data, the first number is head and the second is tail. For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost. For a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost.\n\nNow, in our data, all cars are right-moving? Let's check:\n\nFreeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right -> so the car is from -59 (tail, left) to -48 (head, right). The car length is 12 units? | -48 - (-59) | = 11, so 12 units? Actually, from -59 to -48 inclusive is 12 positions: -59, -58, ..., -48 (that's 12 numbers). But the speed is 12? So it moves 12 units per turn? That seems consistent: the entire car moves right by 12 per turn.\n\nFreeway 2: head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right -> car from -47 to -36? length: | -36 - (-47) | = 11, so 12 positions? But the speed is 6. So it moves 6 per turn.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: same as 2.\n\nFreeway 6: head=24, tail=-11, direction=right -> car from -11 to 24? that's 36 units? and speed=36 -> moves 36 per turn.\n\nFreeway 7: head=48, tail=1, direction=right -> from 1 to 48? 48 units? speed=48 -> moves 48 per turn.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, the player is at (0,2) at turn 50. We need to go to (0,9). The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 7 moves (all U: from y=2 to y=9). But we have to avoid collisions on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting at T=50, then 51, ...) and for each row we are on at that turn, whether a car on that row at turn T covers x=0.\n\nNote: at turn T, the player is at row y_T. We only check the car on that row at that turn.\n\nWe are starting at row 2 at turn 50. Then we take actions for t=50, 51, ... until we reach row 9.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn 50 to the turn when we first reach row 9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we try to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving, so we have to compute at each future turn T, the position of the cars on each row.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t1=50.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, we are given its state at t1=50. Then at turn T (>=50), the car's span is:\n\nIf right-moving: [ tail + s*(T-50), head + s*(T-50) ]\nIf left-moving: [ head - s*(T-50), tail - s*(T-50) ]\n\nBut all cars in this problem are right-moving? The data says all are 'right'. So we only use the right-moving formula.\n\nSo for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) at t1=50, at turn T, the car spans:\n  [ tail + s*(T-50), head + s*(T-50) ]\n\nWe are concerned with whether 0 is in that interval at turn T for the row we are on.\n\nNow, we are at row 2 at turn 50. We must avoid row 2 at turn 50? Actually, we are on row 2 at turn 50, so we check the car on row 2? But wait, the freeways are rows 1 to 8. Row 2 is freeway 2.\n\nLook at the car on freeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nAt turn 50: the car spans [ -47 + 6*(0) , -36 + 6*(0) ] = [-47, -36]. 0 is not in [-47, -36]? because -47 <= 0 <= -36? No, 0 is greater than -36. So not in the interval. So at turn 50, we are safe on row 2.\n\nNow, we can plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to go to row 9. The minimal number of moves is 7 (if we go up 7 times). But we have to avoid cars on the rows we step on.\n\nWe need to simulate the moves and check for collisions.\n\nWe are at turn 50: y=2. We are safe.\n\nThen at turn 51: we choose an action (U, D, or S). We want to minimize H, so we prefer U. But we have to check when we are on a row that has a car at the same turn.\n\nWe must check for each future turn and each row we land on.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at the relevant turns.\n\nFirst, note that the cars on freeway k are only relevant when we are on row k.\n\nWe are going to traverse rows 2, then possibly 3,4,...,9. We start at 2 and end at 9.\n\nWe can also go down? But that would increase H, so we avoid unless necessary. Similarly, staying (S) would also increase H.\n\nBut sometimes we might need to wait to let a car pass.\n\nWe must check for each row and for the turns when we might be on that row.\n\nSince the cars are moving fast, we can compute the time windows when a car covers x=0 on a given row.\n\nFor a car on row k (freeway k) with parameters (head, tail, speed) and direction (all right), we can solve for T such that:\n   tail + s*(T-50) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-50)\n\nBut note: the car's span at T is [tail + s*(T-50), head + s*(T-50)].\n\nSo we need:\n   tail + s*(T-50) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-50)\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n   (0 - head) / s <= T-50 <= (0 - tail) / s\n\nBut note: since the car moves to the right, the interval at time T is [A, B] = [tail+s*(T-50), head+s*(T-50)]. We require 0 to be in [A, B], so A<=0<=B.\n\nTherefore:\n   tail + s*(T-50) <= 0   =>   T-50 <= -tail / s\n   and\n   0 <= head + s*(T-50)   =>   T-50 >= -head / s\n\nBut note: for our cars, head and tail are negative for freeways 1-5? But freeway 6,7,8 have positive and negative.\n\nLet me write the inequality:\n\n   -head / s <= T-50 <= -tail / s\n\nBut note: since the car moves right, and if head and tail are negative, then -head and -tail are positive.\n\nFor freeway 2: tail=-47, head=-36, s=6.\n\nThen: \n   -head = 36, so -head/s = 36/6 = 6\n   -tail = 47, so -tail/s = 47/6 ≈ 7.833\n\nSo the car covers x=0 when 6 <= T-50 <= 7.833, i.e., T in [56, 57] (since T is integer, T-50 must be integer). But 6<= dT <=7.833 -> dT=6,7.\n\nAt T=56: \n   [ -47 + 6*(56-50) = -47 + 36 = -11, -36 + 36 = 0 ] -> so [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, at the upper bound.\n\nAt T=57: \n   [ -47 + 6*7 = -47+42 = -5, -36+42=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is included.\n\nAt T=58: \n   [ -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo freeway 2 is dangerous at T=56 and T=57.\n\nBut we are at turn 50. We are on row 2 at turn 50 and safe. We don't want to be on row 2 at turns 56 or 57.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the time intervals (if any) when the car covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n   -head = 48, -head/s = 48/12=4\n   -tail = 59, -tail/s = 59/12≈4.9167\n   So T-50 in [4, 4.9167] -> integer T: 54, 55? \n   T-50=4: T=54 -> [ -59 + 12*4 = -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> [-11,0] -> covers 0? yes.\n   T-50=5: T=55 -> [ -59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n   Actually, at T=54: tail+s*(T-50)= -59+48=-11, head+s*(T-50)= -48+48=0 -> [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included (at the end). So T=54 is dangerous.\n   T=55: [ -59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12]. So only T=54.\n\nBut wait: the inequality: \n   T-50 >= -head/s = 48/12=4\n   T-50 <= -tail/s = 59/12≈4.9167\n   So T-50 must be at least 4 and at most 4.9167 -> integer: 4 and 5? But at T-50=5: \n        tail + s*5 = -59+60=1, head+s*5=-48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n   So only T-50=4 -> T=54.\n\nBut note: the condition is tail+s*(T-50) <= 0 <= head+s*(T-50). At T=54: head+s*4=0, so 0 is included. At T=55: tail+s*5=1>0, so 0 is not included.\n\nSo freeway 1: dangerous at T=54.\n\nFreeway 2: as above: dangerous at T=56 and T=57.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n   Car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> same as freeway 2? \n   So dangerous at T=56 and T=57.\n\nFreeway 4: same -> T=56,57.\n\nFreeway 5: same -> T=56,57.\n\nFreeway 6: (24, -11, right, 36)\n   -head = -24, -head/s = -24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666 -> but T-50 must be >= -0.666, which is always true for T>=50.\n   -tail = 11, -tail/s = 11/36≈0.3056\n   So T-50 must be <= 0.3056 -> so T-50=0? because T is integer and T>=50 -> T-50=0 -> T=50.\n   At T=50: [ -11 + 36*0 = -11, 24+0=24] -> [-11,24] -> 0 is in this interval? yes.\n\n   So freeway 6 is dangerous at T=50.\n\n   But we are at T=50 and we are on row 2, not row 6. So at T=50, we don't care about row 6.\n\n   Also, are there other T? T-50 must be integer and in [ -0.666, 0.3056] -> only T=50.\n\nFreeway 7: (48,1,right,48)\n   -head = -48, -head/s = -48/48 = -1 -> T-50>=-1 -> always true for T>=50.\n   -tail = -1, -tail/s = -1/48 ≈ -0.0208 -> so T-50 <= -0.0208 -> T-50 <= -1? because T-50 is integer and non-negative? \n        But T-50>=0, and we need T-50<= -0.0208, which is not possible. So no T where it covers 0.\n\n   Let me check: \n        Condition: 1 + 48*(T-50) <= 0 <= 48 + 48*(T-50)\n        The left inequality: 1+48dT <=0 -> dT<=-1/48 -> impossible for dT>=0.\n        So freeway 7 is never dangerous.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7 -> never dangerous.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each row:\n\nRow 1: T=54\nRow 2: T=56,57\nRow 3: T=56,57   (same as row2, because same car parameters? but note: the car on row3 is independent and has the same parameters? so yes, same behavior)\nRow 4: T=56,57\nRow 5: T=56,57\nRow 6: T=50\nRow 7: never\nRow 8: never\n\nWe start at T=50 on row 2 (safe). We want to go to row 9.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- On row 1: at T=54\n- On row 2: at T=56,57\n- On row 3: at T=56,57\n- On row 4: at T=56,57\n- On row 5: at T=56,57\n- On row 6: at T=50\n\nWe are not on row 6 at T=50 (we are on row2) so we are safe for row6 at T=50.\n\nOur goal: we need to be on row 9 at some turn. We start at row2 at T=50.\n\nWe can go up 7 times: \n   T=50: row2 (safe)\n   T=51: row3 (if we go U) -> but then we have to check row3 at T=51: is it dangerous? According to above, row3 is dangerous only at T=56,57. So at T=51, it's safe.\n   T=52: row4 -> safe? row4 dangerous only at T=56,57 -> safe at T=52.\n   T=53: row5 -> safe? same as above -> safe.\n   T=54: row6 -> dangerous at T=50? but T=54: row6. What about row6? We only computed that row6 is dangerous at T=50. At T=54: \n        For row6 car: (head=24, tail=-11, speed=36) at T=54:\n        span = [ -11 + 36*(54-50) = -11 + 36*4 = -11+144=133, 24+144=168] -> [133,168] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n   T=55: row7 -> safe (row7 never dangerous)\n   T=56: row8 -> safe (row8 never dangerous)\n   T=57: row9 -> we are done.\n\nBut wait: at T=57 we are at row9. The problem says we must avoid cars on freeways 1-8. Row9 is not a freeway? So we don't check row9? The freeways are y=1 to 8. So row9 is safe.\n\nBut let me check the moves:\n\n   T=50: start at row2 (safe)\n   T=50: action U -> then at T=51 we are at row3.\n   T=51: action U -> T=52: row4.\n   T=52: action U -> T=53: row5.\n   T=53: action U -> T=54: row6 -> safe? yes, because row6 at T=54: [133,168] doesn't include 0.\n   T=54: action U -> T=55: row7 -> safe (no car ever at row7? we have row7 car but it never covers 0, and at T=55: \n        row7 car: (48,1,right,48) at T=55: \n        span = [1 + 48*(55-50)= 1+48*5=241, 48+240=288? wait: 48*5=240 -> [1+240=241, 48+240=288] -> no 0 -> safe.\n   T=55: action U -> T=56: row8 -> safe: similarly, [1+48*6=289, 48+288=336] -> no 0.\n   T=56: action U -> T=57: row9 -> done.\n\nTotal moves: 7 moves (from T=50 to T=56: 6 moves? Let's count:\n\n   We start at T=50: row2.\n   After 1 move (T=50 action): T=51 -> row3.\n   After 2: T=52 -> row4.\n   After 3: T=53 -> row5.\n   After 4: T=54 -> row6.\n   After 5: T=55 -> row7.\n   After 6: T=56 -> row8.\n   After 7: T=57 -> row9.\n\nSo 7 moves: actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nBut wait: we have to avoid row2 at T=56 and T=57? But we are not on row2 at those turns. Similarly for row3,4,5: we are only on row3 at T=51, row4 at T=52, row5 at T=53. And these are not the dangerous times (56,57). So safe.\n\nBut what about row1? We never go to row1, so we don't care.\n\nSo this plan seems safe.\n\nBut wait: the dangerous times for row3 are T=56 and T=57, and we are on row3 at T=51, which is safe. Similarly for row4,5.\n\nSo is the minimal path 7 moves? \n\nBut note: we must check that we don't go beyond the grid: we are always going up and within bounds.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We are going as fast as possible.\n\nBut wait: what about row6 at T=54: we are safe. But what if we go slower? Then we might hit the dangerous times on rows 2-5 at T=56,57.\n\nBut in this plan we avoid them because we are past row5 by T=53.\n\nBut is there a problem with row1? We don't go to row1.\n\nSo the sequence: \n   Turn 50: U\n   Turn 51: U\n   Turn 52: U\n   Turn 53: U\n   Turn 54: U\n   Turn 55: U\n   Turn 56: U\n\nThen at turn 57 we are at row9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we start at t1=50.\n\nSo we output actions for t=50,51,...,56 (7 actions) and then at the next turn (57) we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem: we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions, and after the last action (at the H-th step) we are at the next turn.\n\nWe start at turn t1=50. After the first action (at t=0 in the sequence, which is turn 50) we are at turn 51? \n\nBut the game update: \n   At turn t, we choose a_t, then we update: \n        y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, after H actions (from t=t1 to t1+H-1), we are at turn t1+H, and we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n   a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then at the next turn, which is t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nIn our plan:\n   We want to be at row9 at turn 57.\n\nWe start at turn50: row2.\n\nAfter 7 actions: \n   Action at turn50: U -> turn51: row3\n   Action at turn51: U -> turn52: row4\n   ...\n   Action at turn56: U -> turn57: row9.\n\nSo we need H=7, and the actions are for turns 50 to 56.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions? And then we are done at turn t1+H.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1). And we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nIn our case, we are at (0,9) at turn 57, which is t1+7 (since 50+7=57). So H=7.\n\nBut is it minimal? We cannot do in 6 because we start at row2 and need to go to row9: 7 steps (each step moves up by 1) is minimal.\n\nBut what if we go up faster? We can only move one per turn.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: are we sure that at row6 at T=54 is safe? We computed: \n   Freeway6: at T=54: \n        tail = -11, head=24, speed=36\n        span = [ -11 + 36*(54-50) = -11 + 36*4 = -11+144=133, 24+144=168] -> [133,168] -> 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row7 at T=55: \n        Freeway7: (48,1,right,48)\n        at T=55: [1 + 48*5 = 1+240=241, 48+240=288] -> safe.\n\nRow8 at T=56: [1+48*6=289, 48+288=336] -> safe.\n\nBut what about row1? We are never on row1.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that when we are on a freeway at turn T, we check the car on that freeway at turn T. We have checked.\n\nBut is there any car that we haven't considered? For example, freeway3: we only computed that it is dangerous at T=56,57. But we are on freeway3 at T=51, which is not 56 or 57, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: we are at T=52, which is safe.\n\nSo I think we are good.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times for freeway3: same as freeway2: \n   tail=-47, head=-36, s=6 -> dangerous at T=56 and T=57? \n   At T=51: \n        span = [ -47 + 6*(51-50) = -47+6=-41, -36+6=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: same.\n\nBut what about freeway5: same.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is 7 ups.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nWe have H=7.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n\nBut wait: the last action at turn56 leads to row9 at turn57.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so 7 actions: from turn50 to turn56.\n\nBut let me check if we can leave earlier? We cannot because we need 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to do it in 7 moves but with a different sequence? We don't need to, because going straight up is safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go slower? Then we might hit the dangerous times on rows2-5 at T=56,57. For example, if we stay at row5 until T=56, then at T=56 we are on row5 and that row is dangerous. So we must be above row5 by T=56.\n\nIn our plan, at T=56 we are on row8, which is safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\", and we do.\n\nBut let me check if we can finish earlier? For example, if we could go faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr if we skip some rows by going faster? But we can't.\n\nSo that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 50 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The minimal number of moves required to move from y=2 to y=9 is 7 upward moves (U), as each move increases the y-coordinate by 1.\n\nThe car configurations and their dangerous times (when they cover x=0) are as follows:\n- Freeway 1: Dangerous at T=54\n- Freeway 2: Dangerous at T=56 and T=57\n- Freeway 3: Dangerous at T=56 and T=57 (same parameters as freeway 2)\n- Freeway 4: Dangerous at T=56 and T=57 (same parameters as freeway 2)\n- Freeway 5: Dangerous at T=56 and T=57 (same parameters as freeway 2)\n- Freeway 6: Dangerous at T=50\n- Freeway 7: Never dangerous\n- Freeway 8: Never dangerous\n\nThe sequence of moves is planned to avoid these dangerous times:\n- At turn 50 (y=2): Safe (not on freeway 6 at T=50).\n- Move U to y=3 at turn 51: Freeway 3 is dangerous only at T=56 and T=57, so safe.\n- Move U to y=4 at turn 52: Freeway 4 is dangerous only at T=56 and T=57, so safe.\n- Move U to y=5 at turn 53: Freeway 5 is dangerous only at T=56 and T=57, so safe.\n- Move U to y=6 at turn 54: Freeway 6 at T=54 is safe (car spans [133, 168], 0 not included).\n- Move U to y=7 at turn 55: Freeway 7 is never dangerous, so safe.\n- Move U to y=8 at turn 56: Freeway 8 is never dangerous, so safe.\n- Move U to y=9 at turn 57: y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so no collision check is needed, and the goal is reached.\n\nThis sequence of 7 upward moves (H=7) avoids all dangerous times on the freeways and reaches (0, 9) at turn 57 (t_1 + H = 50 + 7).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 51, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). The y-coordinate must be between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering the x=0 position.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on y_T. So we only check the car on the current freeway (y_T) at turn T.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (which is 51). For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For left-moving: the car moves left, so the head is the leftmost part? Actually, the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the example for right-moving: at t1, the car is from τ to h (so τ is the leftmost and h the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] meaning τ is the tail and h is the head? And then it moves right so the entire segment shifts right.\n\nHowever, in the given data, we have:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> this is (h, τ, d, s). But note the representation: for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h]. So in this case, τ = -47 and h = -36? But that would mean the car is from -47 to -36? But then the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut wait, the given data is: (head, tail, direction, speed). How do we interpret head and tail?\n\nLooking at the problem: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\". Then for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] meaning the tail is the left end and head the right end? Or vice versa?\n\nBut in the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the entire car moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both ends. Therefore, the head and tail are just the two endpoints? But the update rule differentiates left and right by the order? Actually, the update rule uses the same formula regardless of which is head or tail? \n\nWait, the update rule says:\n- Left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the order in the span is always from left to right? Not necessarily: for left-moving, the car is moving left, so the head (which is the front) is at the right? Actually, no: when moving left, the front (head) would be the leftmost? \n\nBut the problem states for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then moves left. If the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be at the left, so the head is the leftmost? Then the span [h, τ] would be from h (left) to τ (right) if h < τ? But in the example for freeway 1: (-36, -47) and it's right-moving. So if we take [τ, h] = [-47, -36] then the car is from -47 to -36, which is a length of 11. Then moving right: at time T, the car will be at [-47 + 12*(T-51), -36 + 12*(T-51)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have [h, τ] and then subtract s*(T-t1).\n\nBut in our problem, all cars in the given state are right-moving? Actually, the direction is given: all are \"right\". So we only use the right-moving update.\n\nSo for each car on freeway k, at time T (>= t1), the car's span is:\n  [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the problem gives (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, we are told the span is [τ, h] at t1? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". But in the data, we have (head, tail) = (h, τ). So in the data, the first number is head, the second is tail.\n\nFor right-moving: the span at t1 is [tail, head]? Because the problem says: \"for car k: (head, tail, direction, speed)\" and then for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" where τ is tail and h is head.\n\nTherefore, for a car given as (h, τ, 'right', s), the span at t1 is [τ, h]. Then at time T, the span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the span at t1 would be [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn our case, all cars are right-moving. So we can compute the position of the car at any future turn.\n\nWe are to avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if the car on that freeway (if any) has a span that covers 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: There is one car per freeway? The table lists one car per freeway? Yes, the table has freeways 1 to 8, each with one car.\n\nBut wait, freeway 6,7,8 have (60,25,right,36) and (96,49,right,48) etc. Note: for freeway 6: head=60, tail=25? Then the span at t1=51 is [25,60]? But that would be from 25 to 60? Then moving right at speed 36 per turn? That seems very fast.\n\nBut note: the update: at time T, the car on freeway 6 will be at [25 + 36*(T-51), 60 + 36*(T-51)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nOur plan: we start at y=3 at turn 51. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without any cars would be 6 (if we go up every turn: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves? Actually, from 3 to 9: 6 steps? But we are at turn 51: at turn 51 we are at y=3. Then we take actions at turn 51, 52, ... until we reach 9.\n\nAt turn 51: we are at y=3. Then we take H actions? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions and after H turns we are at the position. So if we start at turn 51 and take an action at turn 51, then at turn 51+1 we have moved.\n\nSo to go from 3 to 9, we need 6 upward moves. So H=6? But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting at 51) and for each freeway we might be on at that turn, whether the car on that freeway covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeways we step on. Since we start at y=3, then we move to y=4,5,6,7,8,9. But note: we might choose to go down sometimes? But minimal steps would be going up always? Unless there is a collision that forces us to wait or go down.\n\nBut going down would increase the number of steps. So we should try to go up as much as possible, and only if we are going to collide, then we might wait or go down to avoid.\n\nHowever, note that we can also stay at the same y. So if we are at y and at the next turn we would collide if we go up, we can stay and wait until the car passes, then go up.\n\nBut we are to minimize the total turns H.\n\nWe have to compute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) the times at which the car on freeway k covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k (right-moving) with (h, τ, s) at time t1=51, the car covers 0 at time T if:\n  τ + s*(T-51) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-51)\n\nBut note: the span at time T is [τ + s*(T-51), h + s*(T-51)]. So we require:\n  τ + s*(T-51) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-51)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  T_min = ceil( ( -τ ) / s + 51 )   ? Actually, we have:\n\n  τ + s*(T-51) <= 0  => T <= ( -τ ) / s + 51   ? But note: we have inequality. Actually, we can write:\n\n  Let Δt = T - 51, then:\n      τ + s*Δt <= 0 <= h + s*Δt\n\n  =>   τ <= -s*Δt   and   -s*Δt <= h   ? Actually, rearranged:\n\n  -s*Δt <= h   =>   s*Δt >= -h   => Δt >= ceil(-h / s)   ? But note: h is negative? Actually, look at the data.\n\nWe have:\n\nFreeway 1: h=-36, τ=-47, s=12 -> so τ=-47, h=-36. Then:\n  -47 + 12*Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12*Δt\n  => 12*Δt <= 47  => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> so Δt <= 3? But also 12*Δt >= 36 -> Δt >= 36/12 = 3.\n\nSo at Δt=3: T = 51+3 = 54, the car covers 0? Let me check:\n  At T=54: Δt=3 -> span: [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0] -> so 0 is included? Yes, the right end is 0.\n\nBut note: the condition is τ + s*Δt <= 0 <= h + s*Δt. At T=54: \n  τ + s*Δt = -47 + 36 = -11 <=0, and h+s*Δt = -36+36=0 -> so 0 is included. So collision at T=54 on freeway1.\n\nSimilarly, at T=55: Δt=4 -> [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo freeway1 is dangerous only at T=54? Actually, only when Δt=3? Because at Δt=2: \n  [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not included.\nAt Δt=3: [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nNow, freeway2: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> same as freeway1? Actually, no: the data says for freeway2: (head, tail) = (-30, -41). So τ=-41, h=-30? Then:\n  -41 + 6*Δt <= 0 <= -30 + 6*Δt\n  => 6*Δt >= 30 -> Δt>=5\n     6*Δt <=41 -> Δt<=41/6≈6.83 -> so Δt=5,6.\n\nCheck Δt=5: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? yes.\nΔt=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? yes.\nΔt=7: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway2: dangerous at T=51+5=56 and 51+6=57.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: same as freeway2? The data is the same: (-30, -41, right, 6). So each of freeways 2,3,4,5 is dangerous at T=56 and 57.\n\nFreeway6: (60,25,right,36) -> so head=60, tail=25? Then the span at t1 is [25,60]? Then at T: [25+36*(T-51), 60+36*(T-51)].\n\nWe require: 25+36*Δt <= 0 <= 60+36*Δt -> but 25+36*Δt is positive for Δt>=0, so 0 is never in the interval? Because the car is entirely to the right of 0 at t1 (since 25>0) and moving right, so never covers 0. So safe.\n\nFreeway7: (96,49,right,48) -> head=96, tail=49? Then [49,96] at t1. Then at T: [49+48*Δt, 96+48*Δt]. This is always positive? So never covers 0. Safe.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: safe.\n\nSo only freeways 1 to 5 are dangerous at specific times:\n\nFreeway1: only at T=54 (Δt=3)\nFreeway2: at T=56 (Δt=5) and T=57 (Δt=6)\nFreeway3: same as 2: T=56,57\nFreeway4: same: T=56,57\nFreeway5: same: T=56,57\n\nNow, we start at turn 51 at y=3. We need to go to y=9. The path: we will pass through y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe can plan the moves:\n\nTurn 51: we are at y=3. We choose an action (U, D, or S). We can only move to y=2,3,4? But we want to go up. However, we have to avoid being on a freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We are at turn T and position y. We want to know when we will be on which freeway.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid:\n\nAt turn 54: freeway1 is dangerous. But we are at y=3 at turn51. How can we be at freeway1? Freeway1 corresponds to y=1? The freeways are labeled by y: freeway k is at y=k? The problem says: freeways at y=1,...,8. So freeway1 is at y=1, freeway2 at y=2, etc.\n\nSo we must avoid being at:\n\n- y=1 at turn54 (because freeway1 is dangerous at turn54)\n- y=2 at turn56 and 57 (freeway2 dangerous at 56 and 57)\n- y=3 at turn56 and 57 (freeway3 dangerous at 56 and 57)\n- y=4 at turn56 and 57 (freeway4 dangerous at 56 and 57)\n- y=5 at turn56 and 57 (freeway5 dangerous at 56 and 57)\n\nNote: freeway6,7,8 are safe.\n\nOur goal: reach y=9.\n\nWe start at turn51 at y=3.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns. The minimal without obstacles is 6 turns: from 3 to 9 in 6 moves: so we would be at:\n\nTurn51: y=3\nTurn52: y=4\nTurn53: y=5\nTurn54: y=6\nTurn55: y=7\nTurn56: y=8\nTurn57: y=9\n\nBut at turn54: we are at y=6 -> that's freeway6? But freeway6 is safe. So no problem? Then at turn56: we are at y=8 -> freeway8 is safe. So why worry?\n\nBut note: we must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4,5 at the dangerous times? But in this plan, we are never at y=1,2,3,4,5 at the dangerous times? Because:\n\nAt turn54: dangerous for y=1. But we are at y=6 -> safe.\n\nAt turn56: dangerous for y=2,3,4,5. But we are at y=8 -> safe.\n\nSo this plan is safe? Then we can do:\n\nTurn51: U -> y=4\nTurn52: U -> y=5\nTurn53: U -> y=6\nTurn54: U -> y=7\nTurn55: U -> y=8\nTurn56: U -> y=9\n\nBut wait, at turn56 we are at y=8 and we do U to go to y=9 at turn57? Actually, at turn56 we are at y=8, then we do U and at turn57 we are at y=9. But we need to be at y=9 at the last turn? The problem says: we take H actions and after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we must be at (0,9).\n\nIn this plan, after 6 actions (from turn51 to turn56) we have:\n\nAfter turn51 (action U): turn52 -> y=4\nAfter turn52 (U): turn53 -> y=5\nAfter turn53 (U): turn54 -> y=6\nAfter turn54 (U): turn55 -> y=7\nAfter turn55 (U): turn56 -> y=8\nAfter turn56 (U): turn57 -> y=9\n\nSo at the end of turn56 (after the 6th action) we are at y=8? We need to be at y=9. So we need one more action? Actually, we started at turn51 at y=3. We take an action at turn51 to move to y=4 at turn52. Then we take 5 more actions to get to y=9 at turn57? That would be 6 actions? But wait, we start at turn51, and we take actions at turn51,52,...,56 (6 actions) and then at turn57 we are at y=9. So the last action is at turn56, and the state at turn57 is y=9. So we have reached at turn57? Then H=7? Because we take 6 actions? But the problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions? And after H actions we are at the goal.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. And after the last action (at t1+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\nSo if we start at t1=51, and we take H actions, the last action is at 51+H-1, and then we are at the next state at 51+H. But the goal must be achieved at the turn after the last action? Actually, no: the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t and then the next state is at turn t+1. So to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have taken the action at turn T-1 that moves us to y=9 at turn T.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Let me check: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we start at turn t1=51, and we take H actions: at turns 51,52,...,51+H-1. Then the state after these actions is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait: the state at turn t1 (before any action) is (0, y_{t1}). Then we take an action a_{t1} and then we get to turn t1+1 with y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy. Then we take a_{t1+1} and get to turn t1+2, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, we have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and the last state we are in is at turn t1+H. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nThat doesn't make sense because at turn t1+H-1 we have just taken an action and then we are at the next state at turn t1+H? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo it says: at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). That means that the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? and then we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: that is, a_{t1} (t=0) to a_{t1+H-1} (t=H-1). And we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we have just taken the action a_{t1+H-1} and then the state is updated? Actually, no: the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"current turn is t1\" and we are at (0, y_{t1}) at turn t1. Then we take an action a_{t1} and then we update to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn. Then we take action a_t, and then the state at turn t+1 is computed.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at some state (0,y). Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}, and then we get to turn t1+H with state y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the requirement is: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nThat would mean we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action? But then we might move away? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLooking back: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo it requires that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9. \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we have not taken the action of that turn? We are about to take an action? And then we update. But the requirement is for the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\nSo if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are already at the goal? Then we don't need to take the action? But we have to take H actions? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" \n\nand then the condition: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo it seems: we start at turn t1 (state y_{t1}), and we take actions at t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1 (so H actions) and then the state at turn t1+H-1 must be (0,9). \n\nBut note: after taking an action at turn t, we update to turn t+1. So:\n\n- At turn t1: state y_{t1} (given)\n- Take a_{t1}: then state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1: we have state y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take a_{t1+H-1}? But the problem says the sequence includes a_{t1+H-1} and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\nThat would be inconsistent because if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, we update to turn t1+H. So the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of the turn, and then we take an action and update.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are already at the goal at that turn? And then we take an action? But that action might move us away? \n\nBut the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. And we are to list the actions from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we can choose to stay (S) and then we remain at 9 at the next turn? But the requirement is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 must be 9.\n\nAlternatively, we might have reached 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nBut the minimal H is the minimal number of turns from the start? \n\nActually, H is the number of actions? And we require that after taking the first H-1 actions? No, the state at turn t1+H-1 must be 9. \n\nLet me define the timeline:\n\nTurn: t1, t1+1, t1+2, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1: we are at y0 = given (3). \nWe take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n...\nAt turn t1+k: we are at y_k (state at the beginning of the turn). Then we take a_{t1+k} -> then at turn t1+k+1: y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, the state y_{H-1} = 9? \n\nBut note: the turn index: \n  turn t1: state y0 (given)\n  turn t1+1: state y1\n  ...\n  turn t1+H-1: state y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we start at turn t1 (state y0) and after (H-1) actions (taken at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-2) we get to state y_{H-1} at turn t1+H-1. Then we take one more action? But the sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, which corresponds to actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1. But at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are already at y=9? Then we take an action (which might be S to stay) and then we remain at 9 at the next turn? \n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (the beginning) we are at 9. \n\nSo we don't need to take the last action? But the sequence includes it? \n\nAlternatively, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9, and then we take an action at that turn (which must be S to stay? or any action that doesn't move? but we can move and then leave? but the requirement is the state at the beginning of the turn is 9). \n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" ... up to the last action. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must take an action at that turn? And then the state at the next turn is updated? But the condition is satisfied at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we don't care about the next state? \n\nBut the problem says \"to reach (0,9)\" and then stay? It doesn't say we have to stay. It only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSo if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we can take any action? But if we take U, we go to 10 which is invalid? So we must take S or D? But D would go to 8? Then we leave 9.\n\nBut the requirement is only at that turn we are at 9. So we can leave immediately? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"avoid collisions\" only at the turns we are on a freeway? And at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9: which is the goal? But note: y=9 is not a freeway? The freeways are y=1 to 8. So at y=9, there is no car? So we are safe.\n\nBut the requirement is only to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we can then do anything? But we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway? And at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9 (not a freeway) so no collision? Then we are safe.\n\nSo we can plan to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut how do we get there? We start at turn51 at y=3. We need to be at y=9 at turn51+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H? Without obstacles, we can do:\n\nAt turn51: y=3\nWe want to be at turn51+H-1: y=9.\n\nThe difference in y: 6. The number of turns from turn51 to turn51+H-1: (H-1) - 0 = H-1 turns? Actually, the state at turn51 is given. Then we take actions at turn51,52,...,51+H-2 to move from turn51 to turn51+H-1. So we have H-1 actions? But the problem says we take H actions? \n\nThis is inconsistent with the problem's indexing.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- The state at turn t1: y_{t1} = 3.\n- We take actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} (H actions).\n- Then the state at turn t1+H is determined by the last action? But the problem requires the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo if we take H actions, we are affecting the states from turn t1+1 to turn t1+H. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the first H-1 actions? \n\nBut we take H actions? So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and it will affect the state at turn t1+H, not at t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we only need the first (H-1) actions? Then why do we need the H-th action? \n\nThe problem says: we must take a sequence of H actions, and at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThis implies that the last action (the H-th action) is taken at turn t1+H-1, but it doesn't affect the state at turn t1+H-1 (which is already determined by the previous actions). So the last action is taken at the turn where we are already at the goal? And then we can choose to stay or move? But if we move, we leave the goal? \n\nBut the requirement is only to be at the goal at that turn. So we can do:\n\n- Use the first (H-1) actions to get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n- Then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action (say S) to stay.\n\nThen the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9 (as required) and then we take action S and remain at 9 for turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is only for turn t1+H-1, not for turn t1+H.\n\nSo minimal H: we need to get to y=9 as soon as possible, and then we take one extra action at the turn we arrive? \n\nFor example, we want to be at y=9 at turn T. Then we set T = t1+H-1. So we need to get to y=9 at turn T, and then H = T - t1 + 1.\n\nThe minimal T at which we can be at y=9 is: we start at turn51 at y=3. We can move at most 1 per turn. So the earliest T is 51+6 = 57: because we need 6 moves to go from 3 to 9.\n\nAt turn51: we are at y=3.\nAt turn52: we can be at y=4.\n...\nAt turn57: we can be at y=9.\n\nSo T = 57. Then H = T - t1 + 1 = 57 - 51 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnd the actions: from turn51 to turn57-1=56? But we take actions at turn51 to turn57-1? But H=7 actions: at turn51,52,53,54,55,56,57? But turn57 is T=57, and we require the state at turn57 (T=57) to be 9. But then the action at turn57 is taken after we are already at 9? \n\nLet me write:\n\nWe want y_{57} = 9.\n\nThe state at turn57 is determined by the action at turn56: \n  y57 = y56 + Δy56.\n\nTo have y57=9, we must have been at y56=8 or 9 or 10? But we can only move by 1. So if we are at y56=8 and take U, then y57=9.\n\nOr if we are at y56=9 and take S, then y57=9.\n\nOr if we are at y56=10? but we can't be at 10.\n\nBut how do we get to y56=8 or 9? \n\nWe need to be at y57=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn51 to turn56? That would be 6 actions. But we are to take H=7 actions? Then we would also take an action at turn57? But then that action would affect y58.\n\nBut the requirement is only for y57=9.\n\nSo we can take 6 actions: at turn51 to turn56, and then we are at y57=9. Then we do not need to take an action at turn57? But the sequence is for H=7 actions? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n So if we set H=7, then we require y_{51+7-1} = y_{57}=9.\n\n We take actions at t=0 to 6: which are turn51,52,53,54,55,56,57? But t=0: turn51, t=1: turn52, ... t=6: turn57.\n\n So we take an action at turn57. But at the beginning of turn57, we are at y57. Then we take an action a_{57} and that updates to y58.\n\n But we require y57=9. So at the beginning of turn57, we must be at 9. Then we take an action (which could be S, U, or D). But if we take U, we go to 10 which is invalid? So we must take S or D.\n\n But the requirement is only for the state at the beginning of turn57, so we are safe.\n\n However, we must have reached y57=9 by the actions taken at turns51 to 56.\n\n So the actions at turns51 to 56 move us from y51=3 to y57=9. That requires 6 actions? But we have 7 actions: the 7th action is at turn57, which is after we are at 9.\n\n So the minimal number of actions to reach y=9 is 6, but then we have to take one extra action at the goal turn? So H=7.\n\n But is there a way to be at y=9 at an earlier turn? For example, at turn56: y56=9.\n\n Then we would require y_{51+H-1}=9 at turn56. Then H-1 = 56-51 = 5, so H=6.\n\n Then we take actions at turn51 to turn56? But that's 6 actions: turn51,52,53,54,55,56.\n\n And we require that at the beginning of turn56, we are at y56=9.\n\n But how? The state at turn56 is determined by the action at turn55: \n   y56 = y55 + Δy55.\n\n So we need to be at y55=8 or 9 or 10? and then take an action to be at 9 at turn56.\n\n We can try to be at y56=9.\n\n The earliest we can be at 9 is turn57 if we move up every turn? Because:\n\n  turn51: y=3\n  turn52: y=4 (after action U at 51)\n  turn53: y=5\n  turn54: y=6\n  turn55: y=7\n  turn56: y=8\n  turn57: y=9\n\n So to be at y56=9, we would have to have been at y55=9 and taken S, or at y55=8 and taken U, etc. But can we get to 9 by turn56? \n\n We need to cover 6 units in 5 actions: from turn51 to turn55 (5 actions) and then the state at turn56 is determined by the action at turn55.\n\n The net displacement must be +6. Each action can be +1, -1, or 0. The maximum we can move in 5 actions is +5. So it's impossible to be at y=9 at turn56.\n\n Therefore, the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn57.\n\n So we must have y57=9.\n\n Then H must satisfy: t1+H-1 = 57 -> 51+H-1=57 -> H=57-51+1=7.\n\n So minimal H is 7.\n\n Now, the actions: we need to be at y57=9. That means at turn57, the state is 9. How do we get there? We need to be at y56=8 or 9 or 10? but 10 is invalid. So we must be at y56=8 and then take U, or at y56=9 and take S.\n\n We want to avoid collisions at every turn from 51 to 57? Because at each turn we are on a freeway if 1<=y<=8, and we must not be there if the car on that freeway covers 0 at that turn.\n\n So we simulate the path from turn51 to turn57.\n\n The intended path without obstacles: \n   turn51: y=3 -> freeway3\n   turn52: y=4 -> freeway4\n   turn53: y=5 -> freeway5\n   turn54: y=6 -> freeway6 (safe)\n   turn55: y=7 -> freeway7 (safe)\n   turn56: y=8 -> freeway8 (safe)\n   turn57: y=9 -> not a freeway, safe.\n\n But we must check each turn for collision:\n\n turn51: y=3 -> freeway3: dangerous at turn56 and 57? but this is turn51 -> safe (because freeway3 is only dangerous at 56,57). So safe.\n\n turn52: y=4 -> freeway4: dangerous at 56,57 -> turn52 is safe.\n\n turn53: y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous at 56,57 -> safe.\n\n turn54: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (car never covers 0).\n\n turn55: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\n turn56: y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\n So the path is safe.\n\n Therefore, the actions are:\n\n   turn51: U (from 3 to 4 at turn52? but wait: at turn51 we are at 3, we take U -> then at turn52 we are at 4. But we require the state at turn57 to be 9. \n\n   We need to be at y57=9. We are at turn56 at y=8, then we take U at turn56 to get to 9 at turn57.\n\n   So the actions:\n\n      turn51: U -> leads to y52=4\n      turn52: U -> y53=5\n      turn53: U -> y54=6\n      turn54: U -> y55=7\n      turn55: U -> y56=8\n      turn56: U -> y57=9\n\n   And then we need one more action? Because H=7, so we have to take an action at turn57? \n\n   But the requirement is only that at turn57 (the beginning) we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn57. We can choose S to stay.\n\n   So the seventh action is at turn57: S.\n\n   Then the state at turn58 would be 9, but we don't care.\n\n   However, is it allowed to take an extra action? The goal is to be at 9 at turn57, and we are, and then we take an action (which doesn't cause a collision? at turn57 we are at y=9, not a freeway, so no collision check) and then we are done.\n\n   So the sequence:\n\n        Turn 51: U\n        Turn 52: U\n        Turn 53: U\n        Turn 54: U\n        Turn 55: U\n        Turn 56: U\n        Turn 57: S\n\n   But wait, after the action at turn57 (S), we are still at 9 at turn58? But that's after the requirement.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do:\n\n        Turn 51: U\n        Turn 52: U\n        Turn 53: U\n        Turn 54: U\n        Turn 55: U\n        Turn 56: U   -> then at turn57: y=9, and then we take any action? But we must avoid going out of bounds? If we take U at turn57, we go to 10 which is invalid? So we must take S or D? \n\n   The problem says: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot take U at turn57.\n\n   Therefore, we take S.\n\n   But note: we are at turn57 at y=9, and then we take S: then y58=9, which is valid.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   But is there a way to avoid the extra action? \n\n   We require H to be minimal. We showed that we cannot be at 9 before turn57, so H must be at least 7. So 7 is minimal.\n\n   However, we could consider if we can be at 9 at turn57 with only 6 actions? But then we would not have an action at turn57? But the problem requires H actions. With H=7, we have 7 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, if we don't take an action at turn57, but the problem says we must take a sequence of H actions. So we must take 7 actions.\n\n   So the above plan is valid.\n\nBut wait, is there a shorter path? What if we move faster by using the same number of turns? We cannot: we need 6 upward moves. We are doing 6 upward moves and one stay at the end.\n\nBut could we reach 9 earlier by moving down and then up? That would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision at the turns:\n\nThe dangerous times are only at:\n  freeway1: turn54\n  freeway2,3,4,5: turns56,57\n\nIn our path:\n\n  turn51: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (turn51 is not 56 or 57)\n  turn52: y=4 -> freeway4: safe\n  turn53: y=5 -> freeway5: safe\n  turn54: y=6 -> freeway6: safe\n  turn55: y=7 -> freeway7: safe\n  turn56: y=8 -> freeway8: safe\n  turn57: y=9 -> no freeway\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut what if we consider that at turn57 we take an action? We are at y=9, not on a freeway, so no car to collide with. Safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: S\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn57: S. Then the state at turn58 is 9, but we don't care. The requirement is met at turn57.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1=57, and we are there at the beginning of turn57, and then we take an action. But the action doesn't prevent us from having reached the goal.\n\nSo it is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, could we avoid the extra action by not moving on the last turn? But we have to take H=7 actions.\n\nOr can we reach 9 at turn57 with only 6 actions? Then we would not need the 7th. But we cannot: because from 3 to 9 in 6 moves requires 6 upward moves, and then we would be at 9 at turn57. But then we have only taken 6 actions (from turn51 to turn56). Then we would set H=6? But then we require y_{51+6-1}=y_{56}=9. But we are at y56=8 (after 6 actions? Let me check:\n\n  turn51: start at 3, take U -> turn52:4\n  turn52: U -> turn53:5\n  turn53: U -> turn54:6\n  turn54: U -> turn55:7\n  turn55: U -> turn56:8\n  turn56: U -> turn57:9\n\nSo at turn56 (after the 6th action at turn56) we are at y56=8? Then the state at turn56 is 8, not 9. So we don't satisfy y56=9.\n\nIf we try to be at 9 at turn56, we would need to have been at 9 at turn55 and then take S, or at 8 and take U? But we cannot get to 9 by turn56: as explained, we need 6 moves and we only have 5 actions to influence the state at turn56 (actions from turn51 to turn55).\n\nSo we must have H=7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: S\n}\n\nBut let me check if at turn57 we are at y=9? Yes, at the beginning of turn57 we are at 9. Then we take S and then at turn58 we are at 9. But the requirement is only for turn57.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway3,4,5 are dangerous at turn57? But at turn57, if we were on freeway3,4,5 we would be in danger. But we are at y=9, which is not freeway3,4,5. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn57, the car on freeway1,2,3,4,5: freeway1 is not dangerous at turn57 (only at 54), freeway2,3,4,5 are dangerous at 57? But we are not on them.\n\nSo safe.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, starting from (0, 3) at turn 51, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The minimal number of turns required is 7, as it takes at least 6 upward moves to go from y=3 to y=9, and the earliest turn to reach y=9 is turn 57. After reaching y=9 at turn 57, an additional action (stay, S) is taken at turn 57 to satisfy the sequence length of 7 actions.\n\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed as follows:\n- Freeways 1 to 5 have cars that cover x=0 at specific turns:\n  - Freeway 1 (y=1): covers x=0 at turn 54.\n  - Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 (y=2,3,4,5): cover x=0 at turns 56 and 57.\n- Freeways 6, 7, 8 (y=6,7,8) do not cover x=0 at any turn and are safe.\n\nThe optimal path moves upward every turn from turn 51 to turn 56, reaching y=9 at turn 57. The actions are:\n- Turn 51: U (moves to y=4 at turn 52).\n- Turn 52: U (moves to y=5 at turn 53).\n- Turn 53: U (moves to y=6 at turn 54).\n- Turn 54: U (moves to y=7 at turn 55). At turn 54, y=6 is safe (freeway 6 has no collision).\n- Turn 55: U (moves to y=8 at turn 56). At turn 55, y=7 is safe (freeway 7 has no collision).\n- Turn 56: U (moves to y=9 at turn 57). At turn 56, y=8 is safe (freeway 8 has no collision).\n- Turn 57: S (stays at y=9). At turn 57, y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is at (0, 9) at turn 57 (after 7 actions) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: S\n}",

We are constrained to y in [0,9]. We must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\n Important note: when we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T we are still on y_T. So at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collision. Then at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1} and we check that freeway.\n\n We are given the state of the cars at turn t1=54. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) we have a car described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point? But in the problem, it says:\n   Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n   Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n However, note the representation in the table:\n   For freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) -> this is right-moving, so at t1=54, the span is [τ, h] = [37,48]? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then it moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in the table, the first number is h and the second is τ? Actually, the table says: (head, tail, ...). \n\n Let me clarify the notation in the table: \n   The car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n For a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost point if moving right). So at time t1, the head is at h and the tail is at τ, and since it's moving right, the entire car is from τ to h (with τ < h). Then at time T, the head becomes h + s*(T-t1) and the tail becomes τ + s*(T-t1). So the span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (leftmost point) and the tail is the back (so the car spans from h to τ, but note that h > τ because the head is at a larger x but moving left). However, in the table, all cars are right-moving? Actually, the table only has \"right\" for all.\n\n So all cars are right-moving. Therefore, for a car (h, τ, right, s) at turn t1, the span at turn T (T>=t1) is:\n   [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n We must avoid being at freeway k at turn T if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\n We start at turn 54 at y=0. We are safe at y=0 and y=9 because there are no cars. We only worry about freeways 1 to 8.\n\n We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns if there were no cars would be 9 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\n Since we are at (0,0) at turn 54, and we want to get to (0,9), we must traverse freeways 1 to 8. We can also step back if necessary, but that would increase H.\n\n We are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn 54 (t1=54) for the next H turns until we land on y=9 at turn 54+H-1? Note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1. So at turn t1 (54) we take the first action, then at turn t1+1 (55) the next, ... until turn t1+H-1.\n\n We must check for each turn T (starting at 54) and each freeway we are on (y_T) whether at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\n How the player moves:\n   At turn T, we are at y_T. We choose an action (U, D, S) which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + { -1, 0, +1 } (clamped to [0,9]).\n\n   At turn T, we are on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and we check the car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n   Then we move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (from 54 onward) the span of the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\n    For a car on freeway k: we are given (h, τ, d, s) at t1=54. Since all are right-moving, we have:\n        span_low(T) = τ + s*(T-54)\n        span_high(T) = h + s*(T-54)\n\n    Then at turn T, the car is present on freeway k and occupies [span_low(T), span_high(T)].\n\n    We are in danger at freeway k at turn T if and only if:\n        0 is in [span_low(T), span_high(T)]   (i.e., span_low(T) <= 0 <= span_high(T))\n\n 2. We need to plan a path from y=0 at turn 54 to y=9 as quickly as possible without stepping on a freeway k at a turn T when the car on k at T covers 0.\n\n We can use BFS in the state (turn, y) but note that the turn can go arbitrarily high? However, we are looking for minimal turns. Since the minimal steps without cars is 9, and we might have to wait, we can bound the turns.\n\n Alternatively, note that the cars are moving at constant speed. The danger at a freeway k is periodic? Actually, the car spans are moving to the right. The condition for danger at freeway k at turn T is:\n\n        τ_k + s_k*(T-54) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k*(T-54)\n\n    =>  (0 - h_k) / s_k <= T-54 <= (0 - τ_k) / s_k\n\n But note: for right-moving cars, the car is moving to the right, so the entire span is shifting to the right. Therefore, the danger interval for T is only a contiguous interval (if any) and then it moves away.\n\n However, since the car might be initially to the left and then moves to the right, the danger at 0 might occur only once? Actually, it can occur only once because the car is moving at a constant speed and once it passes 0, it won't come back.\n\n But note: the car is continuous? Actually, the span is a continuous segment. Since the car is moving to the right, once the entire car has passed 0 (i.e., the entire car is to the right of 0) then 0 is never covered again. Similarly, before the car arrives, 0 is not covered.\n\n So for each freeway k, we can compute the interval of turns (if any) during which the car covers 0.\n\n Let T0 = 54.\n\n For freeway k, the car covers 0 at turn T if:\n        τ_k + s_k*(T-T0) <= 0 <= h_k + s_k*(T-T0)\n\n Solve for T:\n\n        T_min_k = T0 + ceil( ( - h_k ) / s_k )   ??? Actually, we need to be careful.\n\n Rearranged:\n\n        τ_k + s_k*(T-T0) <= 0   =>   T >= T0 + ceil( ( - τ_k ) / s_k )   ??? Not exactly, because if we are solving for real numbers, then:\n\n        T >= T0 + ( - τ_k ) / s_k   and   T <= T0 + ( - h_k ) / s_k   ??? \n\n Wait, let's write:\n\n        τ_k + s_k*(T-T0) <= 0   =>   T <= T0 - τ_k / s_k   ??? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Actually, note: the car moves to the right. The condition for 0 being covered is:\n\n        The left end (τ_k + s_k*(T-T0)) must be <= 0, and the right end (h_k + s_k*(T-T0)) must be >= 0.\n\n So:\n        τ_k + s_k*(T-T0) <= 0   =>   T <= T0 - τ_k / s_k   -> but note: τ_k is negative? Let's see the given data.\n\n Given data for freeway 1: h=48, τ=37 -> both positive? Then the car is entirely in positive x at T0? Then at T0, the car on freeway 1 is from 37 to 48? Then 0 is not covered.\n\n But wait, freeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> at T0=54, the car spans [37,48]. Since 0 is not in [37,48], it's safe at T0.\n\n Similarly, freeway 2: h=-48, τ=-59? Then the car is from τ=-59 to h=-48? So at T0, the car is from -59 to -48. Then 0 is not covered. But as T increases, the car moves right.\n\n For freeway 2: τ = -59, h = -48, s=6.\n\n        Condition: -59 + 6*(T-54) <= 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-54)\n\n        Solve the inequalities:\n\n        -59 + 6*(T-54) <= 0  =>  6*(T-54) <= 59  => T-54 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833  => T <= 54+9.833 = 63.833 -> so T<=63 (if integer, then T<=63)\n\n        and \n        0 <= -48 + 6*(T-54)  =>  48 <= 6*(T-54)  => T-54 >= 8  => T>=62\n\n        So the car covers 0 at freeway 2 only when T is in [62,63] (if we consider integer T). Because:\n\n          T=62: -59 + 6*(8) = -59+48 = -11 <=0, and -48+48=0 -> so 0 is covered? \n          Actually, at T=62: left end = -59 + 6*(62-54) = -59+48 = -11, right end = -48+48=0 -> so the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? Yes, because the right end is 0.\n\n          T=63: left end = -59+6*9 = -59+54 = -5, right end = -48+54=6 -> [ -5,6] covers 0.\n\n          T=64: left end = -59+6*10 = 1, right end = -48+60=12 -> 0 not covered.\n\n        So freeway 2 is dangerous at T=62 and T=63.\n\n Similarly, we can compute for every freeway the dangerous turns.\n\n However, note: we might not need to compute for all freeways for all turns if we plan to avoid by timing.\n\n Since we are going from y=0 to y=9, we must pass each freeway exactly once? But we can go up and down. We might wait at a safe freeway to let a car pass.\n\n But note: the cars on different freeways are independent.\n\n We can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (from 54 to, say, 54+20, to be safe) whether the car on k is dangerous at T.\n\n Let T0=54.\n\n We'll create a 2D danger array: danger[k][T] = True if at turn T, the car on freeway k covers 0.\n\n But note: we only care about freeway k at turn T if we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\n Steps for BFS:\n\n   State: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 54) and y is the current vertical position (0..9).\n\n   We start at (54,0) and we want to reach any state (t,9) and we want the minimal t (then minimal H = t - 54 + 1? Actually, the last action we take at turn t-1 leads to y=9 at turn t. So we want to minimize t - 54?).\n\n   Actually, we start at turn 54 at y=0. Then we take an action at turn 54 to move to y1 at turn 55? \n\n   But note: the problem says the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1 relative to t1. So:\n\n        t_1 (turn 54): first action a_{54}\n        then at turn 55: we are at y1 = y0 + Δy (from a_{54})\n\n   So at turn 54, we are at y=0. Then we take an action that moves us to y1 at turn 55? Actually, the update is:\n\n        y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n   So at turn 54, we are at y_54=0. Then we choose a_{54} which determines y_55.\n\n   And at turn 54, we are on freeway y_54=0 -> which is safe (since no car on y=0). Then at turn 55, we are on freeway y_55, and we check the car on that freeway at turn 55.\n\n   Therefore, the state at the beginning of turn t is (t, y). Then we choose an action, and then we move to (t+1, y') and then we check if at turn t+1, being on freeway y' is safe? Actually, the collision check is at the turn when we are on the freeway. So:\n\n        At turn t, we are at y_t. We choose a_t which will lead to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\n        Then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}. Now, if y_{t+1} is in [1,8], we check the car on freeway y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, we must ensure that at the moment we are at a freeway (at turn t+1), the car on that freeway at turn t+1 does not cover 0.\n\n   The starting state: at turn 54, we are at y=0 -> safe. Then we choose an action that will lead to a new y at turn 55. Then at turn 55, if y55 is in [1,8] we check danger for freeway y55 at turn 55.\n\n   We cannot get a collision at turn 54 because we are at y=0.\n\n   So we model:\n\n        State: (turn, y) meaning that at the beginning of turn `turn`, we are at position (0,y). Then we choose an action that will lead to the next state.\n\n        The next state is (turn+1, y') where y' = y + { -1,0,+1 } (clamped to [0,9]). \n\n        Then we check: at the new state (turn+1, y'), if y' is in [1,8], then we must check if the car on freeway y' at turn (turn+1) covers 0. If it does, then this transition is invalid.\n\n   Goal: we are at (turn, 9) for any turn. We want the minimal turn (i.e., the minimal number of steps from 54) to reach 9.\n\n   Since we are at turn 54 at start, we want to minimize (turn - 54) such that at turn we are at y=9.\n\n   But note: when we reach (turn,9), we are done. The last action was taken at turn-1? \n\n        Actually, we start at turn 54 at y0=0. Then we take H actions: \n            a_{54}, a_{55}, ..., a_{54+H-1}\n        and then at turn 54+H, we are at y_{54+H}. \n\n        We require y_{54+H} = 9.\n\n        So we want to be at y=9 at turn 54+H.\n\n        Therefore, H = (turn at which we are at y=9) - 54.\n\n        We want minimal H.\n\n   We can do BFS (or Dijkstra, since all steps cost 1) over states (turn, y). The turn can go up to 54 + ... we don't know, but we can set a limit. Since without obstacles we can do in 9 moves, and with obstacles we might have to wait a few turns, we can set an upper bound for turn, say 54+50.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        Let dist[turn][y] = minimal number of steps taken to reach (turn, y) from (54,0). We want min { turn - 54 | y=9 }.\n\n        We start: at turn=54, y=0 -> dist[54][0]=0.\n\n        Then we consider from state (t, y) we can go to (t+1, y') for y' in {y-1, y, y+1} (if within [0,9]).\n\n        Then we check: if we move to y' at turn t+1, and if y' is in [1,8], then we must check the car on freeway y' at turn t+1: is 0 in the car's span?\n\n        If it is, then this move is invalid.\n\n        Otherwise, we update.\n\n   We'll precompute for every freeway k (1..8) and for every turn t (from 54 to 54+max_turn) whether the car on k at turn t is dangerous.\n\n   We set max_turn = 20? 30? Let's see the cars: the most dangerous car might be the one that moves the fastest? \n\n        Freeway 7 and 8: speed 48. They start at (-48,-95) and (-48,-95). \n\n        For freeway 7: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48.\n\n        Condition: \n            -95 + 48*(t-54) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(t-54)\n\n            => t-54 >= ceil(95/48) ≈ 1.98 -> t>=56 (if we take integer, then t>=56? Let's check)\n\n            and t-54 <= 48/48=1 -> t<=55.\n\n        So no solution? Let me compute:\n\n            Lower bound: -95 + 48*(t-54) <= 0  => 48*(t-54) <= 95  => t-54 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> t<=55.979 -> so t<=55 (if integer, then t=55 and 56? but we have to check both bounds).\n\n            Upper bound: 0 <= -48 + 48*(t-54)  => 48*(t-54) >= 48  => t-54>=1 -> t>=55.\n\n        So t must be in [55,55.979] -> so only t=55.\n\n        At t=55: \n            left = -95 + 48*(1) = -47\n            right = -48 + 48 = 0\n            so the span is [-47,0] -> covers 0? yes, because 0 is the right endpoint.\n\n        So freeway 7 is dangerous at t=55.\n\n        Freeway 8: same parameters -> dangerous at t=55.\n\n        Freeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36) -> \n            Condition: \n                -83 + 36*(t-54) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(t-54)\n\n            => \n                -83 + 36*(t-54) <=0 => 36*(t-54)<=83 => t-54<=83/36≈2.305 -> t<=56.305 -> so t<=56\n                0 <= -48+36*(t-54) => 36*(t-54)>=48 => t-54>=48/36≈1.333 -> t>=55.333 -> so t>=56 (since integer, t>=56)\n\n            So t must be 56.\n\n            At t=56: \n                left = -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n                right = -48+72=24 -> [ -11,24] covers 0 -> dangerous at t=56.\n\n        Freeway 5: (-48,-59,right,6) -> we computed: dangerous at t=62 and 63? Actually, let me recompute:\n\n            τ=-59, h=-48, s=6.\n\n            Condition:\n                -59+6*(t-54) <=0 and 0<=-48+6*(t-54)\n\n            => \n                -59+6*(t-54)<=0 -> 6*(t-54)<=59 -> t-54<=59/6≈9.833 -> t<=63.833 -> t<=63\n                0<=-48+6*(t-54) -> 6*(t-54)>=48 -> t-54>=8 -> t>=62\n\n            So dangerous at t=62,63.\n\n        Similarly, freeway 2,3,4: same as freeway 5? \n\n            Freeway 2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as above: dangerous at 62,63.\n            Freeway 3: same parameters -> dangerous at 62,63.\n            Freeway 4: same -> dangerous at 62,63.\n\n        Freeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> \n            Condition: \n                37+12*(t-54) <=0 and 0<=48+12*(t-54)\n\n            The first inequality: 37+12*(t-54)<=0 -> 12*(t-54)<=-37 -> t-54<=-37/12≈-3.08 -> which is impossible since t>=54.\n\n            So freeway 1 is never dangerous.\n\n        Therefore, the dangerous freeways and turns:\n\n            freeway 7: t=55\n            freeway 8: t=55\n            freeway 6: t=56\n            freeway 2: t=62,63\n            freeway 3: t=62,63\n            freeway 4: t=62,63\n            freeway 5: t=62,63\n\n        Freeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\n        So we can build a danger table:\n\n            danger[k][t] for k=1..8 and t from 54 to 54+max_t (we set max_t=30, so t from 54 to 84? but we don't need that long, because we can do in 9 moves, but we might have to wait until t=64 to avoid freeways 2-5 at 62,63?).\n\n        We note:\n\n            t=55: freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous.\n            t=56: freeway 6 is dangerous.\n            t=62: freeways 2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n            t=63: freeways 2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\n        All other freeways at other times are safe? Actually, freeway 1 is always safe. And the others are safe at other times.\n\n        But note: freeway 7 is dangerous only at t=55? Then at t=56, freeway 7 is safe? Yes, because the car moves on.\n\n   Now, we plan:\n\n        We start at (54,0). We can choose U, S, D. But D would go to y=-1 -> not allowed, so only U or S? Actually, y must be in [0,9]. So from y=0, we can only go to 0 (S) or 1 (U). \n\n        Option 1: at turn 54, choose U -> then at turn 55, we are at y=1. But freeway 1 is safe at turn 55? Yes, because freeway 1 is always safe. So this is safe.\n\n        Option 2: at turn 54, choose S -> then at turn 55, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\n        But we want to minimize H, so we prefer to move up.\n\n        Then from (55,1): we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\n        Now, if we go to y=2 at turn 56: then we are at freeway 2 at turn 56. Is freeway 2 dangerous at turn 56? We said freeway 2 is dangerous only at 62 and 63 -> so safe. Then we can go.\n\n        But note: we have to avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turn 55? We are not on freeway 7 or 8 at turn 55 because we were at freeway 1.\n\n        Similarly, at turn 56, we are at freeway 2? But freeway 2 is safe at turn 56.\n\n        Then we can go: \n            turn54: U -> (55,1)\n            turn55: U -> (56,2)\n\n        Then at turn56, we are at freeway 2 -> safe.\n\n        Then we can go up: \n            turn56: U -> (57,3)\n\n        Now, freeway 3 at turn57: dangerous? freeway3 is dangerous at 62,63 -> safe at 57.\n\n        Similarly, we can go straight up until we hit freeway 6 at some turn? \n\n        But note: at turn56, freeway6 is dangerous? We are not on freeway6 at turn56, we are at freeway2 at turn56 and then we move to freeway3 at turn57.\n\n        When do we hit freeway6? We go: \n            turn57: U -> (58,4)\n            turn58: U -> (59,5)\n            turn59: U -> (60,6) -> at turn60, we are at freeway6.\n\n        Now, freeway6 is dangerous only at turn56? So at turn60, it's safe.\n\n        Then we continue:\n            turn60: U -> (61,7) -> at turn61, freeway7: dangerous? freeway7 is dangerous only at turn55 -> safe.\n            turn61: U -> (62,8) -> at turn62, freeway8: dangerous? freeway8 is dangerous only at turn55 -> safe? \n            turn62: U -> (63,9) -> we are done.\n\n        Total turns: from turn54 to turn63: that's 9 moves? \n\n        But wait: \n            turn54: action U -> at turn55: y=1\n            turn55: action U -> at turn56: y=2\n            turn56: action U -> at turn57: y=3\n            turn57: action U -> at turn58: y=4\n            turn58: action U -> at turn59: y=5\n            turn59: action U -> at turn60: y=6\n            turn60: action U -> at turn61: y=7\n            turn61: action U -> at turn62: y=8\n            turn62: action U -> at turn63: y=9\n\n        So H=9? \n\n        But wait, we are at y=9 at turn63. Then the last action was at turn62. So the sequence of actions is from turn54 to turn62, that's 9 actions.\n\n        However, we must check the dangerous turns: \n\n            At turn62: we are at freeway8? Actually, at turn62 we are at y=8? Then we check freeway8 at turn62: safe? because freeway8 is only dangerous at turn55.\n\n            Then at turn63, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\n        But note: at turn62, we are at freeway8? and we are about to move to freeway9? Actually, at turn62 we are at y=8, and we take U to go to y=9 at turn63.\n\n        However, there is a problem: at turn62, we are at freeway8, and we know that freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous at turn62? But we are at freeway8, which is not in {2,3,4,5}. \n\n        So the danger for freeway8 at turn62: we computed only for freeway8 at turn55? So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, this path seems safe.\n\n        But wait: what about freeway2 at turn62? We are not on freeway2 at turn62, so we don't care.\n\n        So we can do it in 9 moves.\n\n        However, note that at turn62 we are at freeway8, and we are moving to freeway9 at turn63. But we must also note that at turn62, we are at freeway8 and we have to check the car on freeway8 at turn62. We computed that freeway8 is dangerous only at turn55, so at turn62 it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n            turn54: U\n            turn55: U\n            turn56: U\n            turn57: U\n            turn58: U\n            turn59: U\n            turn60: U\n            turn61: U\n            turn62: U\n\n        But wait: at turn60 we were at freeway6 (y=6) at turn60: safe? because freeway6 is dangerous only at turn56 -> safe.\n\n        However, let me double-check the dangerous turn for freeway6: we computed t=56. But at turn56, the car on freeway6: \n            τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, T=56 -> \n            span: [-83+36*(56-54), -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24] -> which includes 0 -> dangerous at turn56.\n\n        But we are at freeway6 at turn60: \n            [-83+36*(60-54), -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133, 168] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\n        So the path is safe.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 9.\n\n        But wait: is there a problem at turn62? We are at freeway8 at turn62: \n            freeway8: τ=-95, h=-48, s=48 -> at turn62: \n                left = -95 + 48*(62-54) = -95 + 48*8 = -95+384=289\n                right = -48+384=336 -> [289,336] -> doesn't cover 0 -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway7 at turn61: \n            τ=-95, h=-48, s=48 -> at turn61: \n                left = -95+48*(61-54)= -95+48*7 = -95+336=241\n                right = -48+336=288 -> safe.\n\n        So the plan is safe.\n\n        However, what about freeways 2,3,4,5 at turn62? They are dangerous at turn62, but we are at freeway8 at turn62 and freeway7 at turn61, etc. So we avoid them.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 9 moves: all U.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We found H=9.\n\n        However, we must output the sequence for turns 54 to 54+8 (i.e., 54 to 62).\n\n        So:\n\n            Turn 54: U\n            Turn 55: U\n            Turn 56: U\n            Turn 57: U\n            Turn 58: U\n            Turn 59: U\n            Turn 60: U\n            Turn 61: U\n            Turn 62: U\n\n        But note: at turn62 we take the last action (the 9th action) and then at turn63 we are at y=9.\n\n        The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here H=9, so t from 0 to 8.\n\n        So a_{54} = U, a_{55}=U, ... a_{62}=U.\n\n        However, we must ensure that we don't get stuck at freeway2 at turn62? We are at freeway8 at turn62, which is safe, and then we move to freeway9 (which is safe) at turn63.\n\n        But wait: what if we try to go faster? We cannot, because we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9.\n\n        Alternatively, we might try to go slower to avoid the dangerous turns? But we don't need to.\n\n        However, note: we have to avoid freeway6 at turn56? But we are not on freeway6 at turn56, we are on freeway2 at turn56 (if we go up twice). And freeway2 at turn56 is safe.\n\n        So the above sequence is safe.\n\n        But wait: what if we go up one more time at turn54? We already did.\n\n        Let me write the positions:\n\n            turn54: y=0 -> safe (no car check because y=0)\n            turn55: y=1 -> check freeway1: safe (always safe)\n            turn56: y=2 -> check freeway2: safe (because dangerous at 62,63 only)\n            turn57: y=3 -> freeway3: safe\n            turn58: y=4 -> freeway4: safe\n            turn59: y=5 -> freeway5: safe\n            turn60: y=6 -> freeway6: at turn60: [133,168] -> safe\n            turn61: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn61: [241,288] -> safe\n            turn62: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn62: [289,336] -> safe\n            turn63: y=9 -> safe\n\n        So it works.\n\n        However, what about the car on freeway2 at turn56? \n            freeway2: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6 -> at turn56: \n                left = -59 + 6*(56-54) = -59+12 = -47\n                right = -48+12 = -36 -> [-47,-36] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway3,4,5 at the turns we pass (57,58,59) are safe because they are dangerous only at 62,63.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9 and the sequence is all U.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=9, meaning 9 actions and we reach at turn63 (which is 9 steps after 54: from 54 to 55 is step1, ... 54 to 63 is step9).\n\n        So we output:\n\n            Turn 54: U\n            Turn 55: U\n            Turn 56: U\n            Turn 57: U\n            Turn 58: U\n            Turn 59: U\n            Turn 60: U\n            Turn 61: U\n            Turn 62: U\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t from 0 to 8 (since H-1=8), that's 9 actions.\n\n        But let me check if we can do it in 8? That would require going from 0 to 9 in 8 moves: we need to move up 9 times? But we start at 0 and end at 9: that requires 9 moves. So 8 moves is impossible.\n\n        Therefore, H=9 is minimal.\n\n        However, we must consider if there is a path that takes the same 9 moves? We have one.\n\n        But what if we try to go down? That would take more moves.\n\n        So the answer is the above sequence.\n\n        However, I notice: the car on freeway6 is dangerous at turn56, but we are not on freeway6 at turn56. We are on freeway2. So we are safe.\n\n        But what if we were to be on freeway6 at turn56? Then we would be in danger. So we avoided it by being at freeway2 at turn56.\n\n        But note: we have to be at freeway6 eventually. We passed it at turn60, which is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\n        Let's code the BFS to be sure? But with the precomputation, we know the dangerous states.\n\n        Alternatively, we can simulate the above.\n\n        But note: what if we choose to stay at turn54? Then we start moving at turn55. Then:\n\n            turn54: S -> (55,0)\n            turn55: U -> (56,1) -> safe? at turn55: we were at y=0 (safe) then at turn56 we are at y=1 -> check freeway1 at turn56: safe.\n            then we continue: \n                turn56: U -> (57,2) -> freeway2 at turn57: safe? freeway2 dangerous at 62,63 -> safe.\n                ... until turn63: we are at y=8 -> then turn64: U -> y=9.\n\n            That's 10 moves: H=10 -> not minimal.\n\n        So we stick with the 9-move plan.\n\n        But wait: what if we do a down move? That would be even worse.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        Output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\n}\n\n        However, let me check if we can skip one of the freeways by going faster? We cannot because we must go up 9 times.\n\n        Alternatively, note that we might avoid freeway6 at turn60 by going faster? But we are already going as fast as possible.\n\n        But what if we start by staying at y=0 for one turn? Then we avoid freeway1 at turn55? But we don't need to avoid it because it's safe. And then we are delayed by one.\n\n        So we stick with the above.\n\n        However, there is a potential problem: at turn62, we are at freeway8. But at turn62, freeways 2,3,4,5 are dangerous. We are at freeway8, so we are safe. But what if we had to be at freeway2 at turn62? Then we would be in trouble. But we are not.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the sequence of 9 U's.\n\n        But wait: what if we take a detour? For example, at some point we go down to avoid a danger? But in this case, we don't need to because we avoid the dangerous times by being at the freeways at safe times.\n\n        Since we have no danger on the path we took, we don't need to detour.\n\n        So we output the sequence.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=9.\n\n        But let me double-check the car on freeway2 at turn56: \n            freeway2: at turn56: \n                τ=-59, h=-48, s=6 -> \n                new head = -48 + 6*(56-54) = -48+12 = -36\n                new tail = -59+12 = -47\n                So the car spans [-47, -36] -> which is from -47 to -36, and 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, at turn62, freeway2: \n            head = -48 + 6*(62-54)= -48+48=0\n            tail = -59+48=-11\n            So the span is [-11,0] -> which includes 0 -> dangerous. But we are not on freeway2 at turn62, we are on freeway8.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n        We'll write the answer.\n\n        Note: the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We have avoided them.\n\n        So the final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\n}\n\n        But wait: the last action is at turn62, and after that we are at turn63 at y=9. The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", which happens at turn63. The sequence of actions is for turns 54 to 62, which is 9 actions.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"the minimal number of turns H\". Here H=9.\n\n        We are done.\n\n        But what if the car on freeway1 becomes dangerous? We checked: freeway1 is safe at all times.\n\n        So we are confident.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 54 is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at a turn when a car covers position \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe dangerous turns and freeways are:\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at turn 55\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at turn 55\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at turn 56\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5: dangerous at turns 62 and 63\n\nThe path taken is:\n- At turn 54, start at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 55 (freeway 1 is safe at all turns).\n- Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 56 (freeway 2 is safe at turn 56, as danger occurs only at turns 62 and 63).\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57 (freeway 3 is safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58 (freeway 4 is safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 59 (freeway 5 is safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 60 (freeway 6 is safe at turn 60, as danger occurs only at turn 56).\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 61 (freeway 7 is safe at turn 61).\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 62 (freeway 8 is safe at turn 62).\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63 (goal reached, safe).\n\nThe sequence of actions is all \"U\" (up) for 9 turns, as this is the minimal path without delays or detours, and all positions are safe at the respective turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 2) at turn t1 = 56. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving up, down, or staying, while avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving either left or right, and I need to make sure that when the player is on a freeway y at turn T, the car on that freeway doesn't have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule is: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T. And importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. That means you don't check for collision on y+1 at turn T; you only check when you're actually on that row.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action: U for +1, D for -1, S for 0. And y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there's a car defined with head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction: right means it's moving right, so the span increases over time. Left means moving left, span decreases.\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 12) — head at -48, tail at -59? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), but for direction, it says: left-moving: span from h to τ, and after time, h - sΔt, τ - sΔt. Similarly for right: [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]. In the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, in the update, it says [τ, h] for span, so τ is the left end, h is the right end? I'm confused.\n\nLook: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, ...). So for right-moving, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end? But in the span, it's [τ, h] with τ and h, so if τ is tail and h is head, then for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\", so h is left end, τ is right end? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ], and after time, h - sΔt, τ - sΔt, so since s is positive, it decreases, so h is the front when moving left? This is messy.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the position at time t.\n\nFor any car, the span at time T can be calculated based on initial position at t1 and speed.\n\nLet me denote t1 = 56 for all cars.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\n- If direction is right, then at time t, the left end is τ + s*(t - t1)\n\nThe right end is h + s*(t - t1)\n\nBecause from the update: for right, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so left end = τ + s(T-t1), right end = h + s(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly, for left, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so left end = h - s(T-t1), right end = τ - s(T-t1)\n\nIn the car state, for all cars, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but head and tail are not consistently the front; it depends on direction.\n\nTo simplify, I should compute the left and right ends at time t.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is between left end and right end at time t for the freeway the player is on.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at time t if y_t = y.\n\nNow, at t=56, player is at y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and we start at y=2, we probably want to move up as much as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), which is on freeway? Position is (0, y), so at x=0, y=row. When we say on freeway, it means when y is between 1 and 8, we need to check for cars at x=0 at that turn.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway.\n\nSince there's one car per freeway, I think.\n\nFrom the table, each freeway has one car listed.\n\nNow, let's list the cars and their positions over time.\n\nt1 = 56.\n\nFor each freeway k, car state:\n\nk=1: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=12\n\nSince direction right, at time t, left end = τ + s*(t - t1) = -59 + 12*(t - 56)\n\nRight end = h + s*(t - t1) = -48 + 12*(t - 56)\n\nk=2: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, right, s=6\n\nLeft end = τ + s*(t-t1) = -47 + 6*(t-56)\n\nRight end = h + s*(t-t1) = -36 + 6*(t-56)\n\nτ is tail, which for right-moving is left end.\n\nIn k=2, tail τ=-47, head h=-36, so since right-moving, τ=-47 is left, h=-36 is right, so at t1, span from -47 to -36.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: same as k=2? h=-36, τ=-47, right, s=6\n\nk=4: same, h=-36, τ=-47, right, s=6\n\nk=5: same, h=-36, τ=-47, right, s=6\n\nk=6: head h=24, tail τ=-11, right, s=36\n\nSo left end = τ + s*(t-t1) = -11 + 36*(t-56)\n\nRight end = h + s*(t-t1) = 24 + 36*(t-56)\n\nk=7: head h=48, tail τ=1, right, s=48\n\nLeft end = τ + s*(t-t1) = 1 + 48*(t-56)\n\nRight end = h + s*(t-t1) = 48 + 48*(t-56)\n\nk=8: same as k=7, h=48, τ=1, right, s=48\n\nAll cars are right-moving except possibly, but all are right here.\n\nIn the list, all directions are right.\n\nk=1 to 5 and 6,7,8 all right.\n\nk=1 has different parameters.\n\nNow, player needs to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since we need to move up 7 units, from 2 to 9, difference 7, so if we move up every turn, it would take 7 turns, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut we need to avoid cars on rows 1 to 8 when we are on them.\n\nAlso, we start at y=2 at t=56.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action, which affects y for next turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at turn t, we are on freeway y_t, and we need no car on that freeway to have 0 in its span at time t.\n\nCollision at turn T if 0 in span of car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAnd since we move after the action, when we are at y_t at turn t, we are on that row at that time.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, which is safe, but we need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so when y_t=9, we are at (0,9), done.\n\nWe need the sequence of actions from t=56 onwards.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=56 to t=56 + H -1, we have H actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_t1 + sum of Δy from t=0 to H-1.\n\nStart at t1, y_t1 = 2.\n\nAfter action a_t1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy_t1\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe position after H turns: after H actions, we have moved H steps, so y at time t1 + H.\n\nTurn t1: we are at y_t1 = 2.\n\nAfter action a_t1, at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = 2 + Δy_t1\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nAnd we need minimal H such that we can achieve this without collision during the path.\n\nCollision during turns from t1 to t1+H-1, since at turn t1+H, if we are at y=9, it's safe, no car.\n\nAt each turn t from t1 to t1+H-1, when we are at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, we need that for freeway y_t, at time t, 0 not in car span.\n\nAt turn t, we are on row y_t, so we check car on row y_t at time t.\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, the spans change over time.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and each time, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut time is discrete, turns.\n\nt starts from t1=56.\n\nLet me define the car positions for each freeway at time t.\n\nFor freeway k=1 (y=1):\n\nDirection right, s=12\n\nAt time t, left end = τ + s*(t - t1) = -59 + 12*(t - 56)\n\nRight end = h + s*(t - t1) = -48 + 12*(t - 56)\n\n0 in span if left end <= 0 <= right end\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince all are right-moving, and speeds are high, we need to find when 0 is covered for each row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the time when 0 is in the car span.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nleft end = -59 + 12(t-56)\n\nright end = -48 + 12(t-56)\n\n0 in span if -59 +12(t-56) <= 0 <= -48 +12(t-56)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +12(t-56) <= 0 => 12(t-56) <= 59 => t-56 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so t <= 56 + 4.916 = 60.916, so since t integer, t <= 60\n\nt-56 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so t-56 <= 4 since integer? t-56 <= floor(4.916) =4? No, inequality.\n\n12(t-56) <= 59, t-56 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so for integer t, t-56 <= 4, thus t <= 60? Let's see:\n\nIf t-56 = 4, 12*4=48 <=59, true\n\nt-56=5, 12*5=60 >59, false? 60>59, so not <=59.\n\n12(t-56) <=59\n\nt-56 <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so since t integer, t-56 <=4, so t <= 56+4=60\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 +12(t-56) => 48 <= 12(t-56) => 4 <= t-56 => t >= 60\n\n0 <= -48 +12(t-56) => 48 <= 12(t-56) => 4 <= t-56 => t >= 60\n\nAnd from first, t <=60\n\nSo t=60 only.\n\nFor t=60: left end = -59 +12(60-56) = -59 +12*4 = -59+48 = -11\n\nRight end = -48 +12*4 = -48+48=0\n\nSo at t=60, span from -11 to 0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt t=59: left end = -59 +12(59-56) = -59 +12*3 = -59+36= -23\n\nRight end = -48 +12*3 = -48+36= -12\n\n0 not in [-23,-12], since -12 <0\n\nAt t=61: left end = -59 +12(5) = -59+60=1\n\nRight end = -48+60=12\n\n0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for k=1, 0 in span only at t=60.\n\nNow freeway k=2 (y=2):\n\nh=-36, τ=-47, right, s=6\n\nLeft end = τ + s(t-t1) = -47 +6(t-56)\n\nRight end = h + s(t-t1) = -36 +6(t-56)\n\n0 in span if -47 +6(t-56) <= 0 <= -36 +6(t-56)\n\nFirst: -47 +6(t-56) <=0 => 6(t-56) <=47 => t-56 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so t <=56+7=63? Since 7.833, t-56<=7 for integer? Let's see.\n\n6(t-56) <=47, t-56 <=47/6≈7.833, so t <= 56+7.833=63.833, so t<=63 for integer t? t-56 <=7.833, so t-56 <=7 since 7<=7.833, 8>7.833? t-56=7, 6*7=42<=47 true; t-56=8, 48>47 false? 48>47, so not <=47.\n\nSo t-56 <=7, t<=63\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 +6(t-56) => 36 <=6(t-56) => 6 <= t-56 => t >=62\n\n0 <= -36 +6(t-56) => 36 <=6(t-56) => 6 <= t-56 => t >= 62\n\nAnd from first, t<=63\n\nSo t=62 or 63.\n\nAt t=62: left end = -47 +6(62-56) = -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11\n\nRight end = -36 +36=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt t=63: left end = -47 +6(7) = -47+42= -5\n\nRight end = -36 +42=6\n\nSpan [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt t=61: left end = -47 +6(5) = -47+30= -17\n\nRight end = -36+30= -6\n\nSpan [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=64: left end = -47 +6(8) = -47+48=1\n\nRight end = -36+48=12\n\nSpan [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for k=2, 0 covered at t=62 and t=63.\n\nBut k=2 is freeway y=2.\n\nNow, similarly, k=3: same as k=2? From table, k=3: (-36,-47,right,6) same as k=2.\n\nk=4 same, k=5 same.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| k | cars |\n\n1: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\n2: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\n3: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\n4: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\n5: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\n6: (24,-11,right,36)\n\n7: (48,1,right,48)\n\n8: (48,1,right,48)\n\nk=3,4,5 all have same as k=2? But different freeways.\n\nk=3 is freeway y=3, with car same as y=2? But different row.\n\nEach freeway has its own car.\n\nFor k=3 (y=3): car is (-36,-47,right,6), same as k=2.\n\nSimilarly k=4 and k=5 same.\n\nSo for k=3,4,5, the car is identical to k=2, so for each, 0 covered at t=62 and t=63.\n\nBut since different rows, we need to check separately.\n\nFor k=2, y=2, covered at t=62,63\n\nSimilarly for k=3, y=3, also covered at t=62,63? Let's see.\n\nThe car on k=3 has same parameters, so at same times, 0 covered for that row.\n\nSimilarly for k=4 and k=5.\n\nk=6: y=6, car (24,-11,right,36)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=-11, right, s=36\n\nLeft end = τ + s(t-t1) = -11 +36(t-56)\n\nRight end = h + s(t-t1) = 24 +36(t-56)\n\n0 in span if -11 +36(t-56) <= 0 <= 24 +36(t-56)\n\nFirst: -11 +36(t-56) <=0 => 36(t-56) <=11 => t-56 <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so t-56 <=0, t<=56\n\nSince t-56 integer, t-56 <=0, t<=56\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24 +36(t-56) => -24 <= 36(t-56) => since 36>0, t-56 >= -24/36 = -2/3 ≈ -0.666, so t-56 >= 0? -0.666, so for integer, t-56 >= 0? t-56 >= ceil(-0.666) = 0? Let's think.\n\n0 <= 24 +36(t-56)\n\nSince 24 +36(t-56) >=0 always? No, if t-56 negative, it could be negative.\n\nBut t >= t1=56, so t-56 >=0, so 24 +36(t-56) >=24 >0, so always true for t>=56.\n\nSimilarly, first inequality: -11 +36(t-56) <=0\n\nAt t=56, -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true\n\nAt t=57, -11+36=25>0? -11 +36(1) =25 >0, not <=0.\n\n-11 +36(t-56) <=0\n\nAt t=56, -11 <=0 true\n\nAt t=57, -11+36=25 >0, false\n\nSo for t=56 only, since t-56=0.\n\nt-56 <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so only t=56.\n\nAnd second inequality always true for t>=56.\n\nSo at t=56, for k=6, 0 in span.\n\nAt t=56: left end = -11 +0 = -11\n\nRight end =24 +0=24, so span [-11,24], 0 included.\n\nAt t=57: left end = -11 +36(1) =25, right end=24+36=60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo for k=6, 0 covered only at t=56.\n\nNow k=7: y=7, car (48,1,right,48)\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=1, right, s=48\n\nLeft end = τ + s(t-t1) =1 +48(t-56)\n\nRight end = h + s(t-t1) =48 +48(t-56)\n\n0 in span if 1 +48(t-56) <= 0 <= 48 +48(t-56)\n\nFirst: 1 +48(t-56) <=0 => 48(t-56) <= -1, which is impossible since t>=56, t-56>=0, 48(t-56)>=0, so 1 + something non-negative >0, cannot be <=0.\n\nSo never true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 48 +48(t-56) always true.\n\nSo no solution, 0 never in span for k=7.\n\nSimilarly, k=8: same as k=7, (48,1,right,48), same thing, left end=1 +48(t-56) >=1>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nNow k=1: we had only t=60\n\nk=2: t=62,63\n\nk=3: same as k=2, t=62,63\n\nk=4: same, t=62,63\n\nk=5: same, t=62,63\n\nk=6: t=56 only\n\nk=7: never\n\nk=8: never\n\nk=1 is y=1, covered at t=60\n\ny=2 covered at t=62,63\n\ny=3 covered at t=62,63\n\ny=4 covered at t=62,63\n\ny=5 covered at t=62,63\n\ny=6 covered at t=56 only\n\ny=7 and y=8 never covered.\n\nNow, player starts at t=56, y=2.\n\nAt t=56, y=2, but for y=2, is it covered? y=2 is freeway k=2, covered at t=62 and 63, not at t=56.\n\nAt t=56, for k=2, we have left end = -47 +6(0) = -47, right end=-36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut at t=56, for y=6, it is covered, but player is not on y=6 at t=56.\n\nPlayer is on y=2 at t=56.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is covered.\n\nNow, the covered times:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=60\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=62,63\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=62,63\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=62,63\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=62,63\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at t=56\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=56, so for t>56, y=6 is safe.\n\nNow, player at t=56, y=2, which is safe at t=56.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we move up every turn, starting from y=2 at t=56.\n\nAfter first action, say at t=57, y=3 if we go up, etc.\n\nBut we have to consider the actions.\n\nSet t_abs = t, with t1=56.\n\nPlayer position over time.\n\nAt t=56, y=2.\n\nWe choose a_56, which affects y at t=57.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2, we need at least 7 up moves, since each up increases y by 1, and y from 2 to 9, delta 7.\n\nBut we might have down or stay, which would increase H.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 7, but could be more if we need to avoid.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are around t=60 to 63 for rows 1-5, but row 1 only t=60, rows 2-5 at t=62,63.\n\nAlso, row 6 unsafe only at t=56.\n\nSince we start at t=56, and row 6 unsafe at t=56, but we are not on row 6 at t=56, we are on row 2.\n\nNow, to go up, we need to pass through rows 3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are always safe, so no issue.\n\nRow 6 is only unsafe at t=56, so for t>56, safe.\n\nNow, the main problem is rows 2,3,4,5 at times around t=62-63.\n\nSpecifically, at t=62 and 63, rows 2,3,4,5 are all unsafe.\n\nBut row 1 unsafe only at t=60.\n\nSince we start from below, we might go up quickly before t=62 or after t=63.\n\nt=62 is 6 turns after t=56, since 62-56=6.\n\nSimilarly, t=63 is 7 turns after.\n\nAt t=56, y=2.\n\nIf we move up every turn:\n\nt=56: y=2, safe (not covered)\n\nAction U, then at t=57, y=3\n\nt=57: y=3, now for y=3, covered at t=62,63, not at t=57 (since t=57<62), so safe.\n\nAction U, t=58, y=4\n\nSimilarly, t=58: y=4, safe, since t=58<62\n\nAction U, t=59, y=5\n\nt=59: y=5, safe, t=59<62\n\nAction U, t=60, y=6\n\nt=60: y=6, now y=6 is freeway k=6, which is unsafe only at t=56, not at t=60. At t=60, for k=6, left end= -11 +36(60-56)= -11 +36*4= -11+144=133, right end=24+144=168, span [133,168], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo at t=60, y=6 safe.\n\nAction U, t=61, y=7\n\nt=61: y=7, which is always safe.\n\nAction U, t=62, y=8\n\nt=62: y=8, always safe.\n\nAction U, t=63, y=9\n\nt=63: y=9, which is not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reach at t=63, which is 7 turns after start? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart at t=56, y=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=56.\n\nAfter 1st action a_56, at t=57, y=?\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=56 to t=56+H-1, and after H actions, at time t=56+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with all U:\n\n- At t=56: y=2, safe\n\n- Action U: then at t=57, y=3, safe\n\n- Action U: t=58, y=4, safe\n\n- Action U: t=59, y=5, safe\n\n- Action U: t=60, y=6, safe (as above)\n\n- Action U: t=61, y=7, safe\n\n- Action U: t=62, y=8, safe\n\n- Action U: t=63, y=9, reached.\n\nSo we reached at t=63, after 7 actions: actions at t=56 to t=62? Let's list:\n\nActions: a_56, a_57, a_58, a_59, a_60, a_61, a_62\n\nAfter a_62, at t=63, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=56 to t=62 inclusive, that's 7 actions, H=7.\n\nNow, at each step, we were safe: at t=56, y=2, not covered; t=57 y=3 not covered (t=57<62); similarly t=58,59 all before t=62, so safe; t=60 y=6 safe; t=61 y=7 safe; t=62 y=8 safe. And we never were on rows 2-5 at t=62 or 63, since at t=62 we were on y=8.\n\nIn this path, at t=62, y=8, which is safe, not on y=2-5.\n\nSimilarly at t=63, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 7 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nAt t=60, we are on y=6, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut y=1 is unsafe at t=60, but we are not on y=1.\n\nIn this path, we start from y=2 and go up, never on y=1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 moves up, so H=7 is minimum possible, since we need to increase by 7.\n\nWith down or stay, it would take more turns, so H=7 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be unsafe.\n\nIn the path:\n\nt=56: y=2, car on y=2 at t=56: left end=-47, right end=-36, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=57: y=3, car on y=3: same as y=2, at t=57, left end= -47 +6(1) = -41? t-56=1, left end= -47 +6(1) = -41, right end= -36 +6= -30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=58: y=4, car y=4: similar, left end= -47 +6(2) = -47+12= -35, right end= -36+12= -24, span [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=59: y=5, car y=5: left end= -47 +6(3) = -47+18= -29, right end= -36+18= -18, span [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=60: y=6, car y=6: at t=60, t-56=4, left end= -11 +36*4 = -11+144=133, right end=24+144=168, span [133,168], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=61: y=7, car y=7: always safe, left end=1 +48(61-56)=1+48*5=1+240=241, right end=48+240=288, not 0, safe.\n\nt=62: y=8, similar, safe.\n\nThen at t=63, y=9, done.\n\nSo all safe, and H=7.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at t=63.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=56 to t=62, all U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if we were to be on y=2 at t=62, it would be unsafe, but in this path, we are not.\n\nSimilarly, we avoid the dangerous times.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nBut what about row y=1? It is unsafe at t=60, but we never go to y=1, since we start at y=2 and go up.\n\ny=0 is available, but going down would take us away from goal, so not useful.\n\nThus, with all U actions, we can reach in H=7 turns.\n\nBut let me check the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for k=3,4,5, they are the same as k=2, but since we pass through quickly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nAnother thing: at t=56, for y=6, it is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nIf we were to go to y=6 at t=56, we couldn't, but we don't.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=6 at t=60, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But from y=2, to y=9, min 7 moves, so at earliest t=56+7=63.\n\nt=56: start, after 7 actions, at t=63.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case, it works.\n\nBut let me double-check row y=1 at t=60.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=60, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2-5 unsafe at t=62,63, but at t=62, we are on y=8, not on them.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the car for k=6.\n\nk=6: at t=56, span [-11,24], 0 included, so if player were on y=6 at t=56, collision, but player is on y=2.\n\nAt t=60, as above, not covered.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U actions for 7 turns.\n\nActions: a_56 = U, a_57 = U, a_58 = U, a_59 = U, a_60 = U, a_61 = U, a_62 = U\n\nThen at t=63, y=9.\n\nNow, H=7.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U\n\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 62: a_{62} = U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 63.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0 to 6, actions at t1 + t = 56 to 62.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t=0 to H-1, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=7, actions at 56 to 62.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nThe player cannot go below 0 or above 9, but in this path, y from 2 to 9, all within bounds.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can go faster, but cannot.\n\nOr if there is a reason to go down or stay, but that would only make it slower.\n\nFor example, if we stayed at some point, we might be safe, but H larger.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSo this should be the minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for k=2,3,4,5, all have cars that cover at t=62,63, but since we are above by then, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, k=1 at t=60, but we are not on y=1.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 56\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The car positions and collision conditions have been analyzed for each freeway and turn, as detailed below.\n\n### Car Collision Analysis\n- **Freeway \\(y = 1\\) (k=1)**: Car span covers x=0 only at turn 60.\n- **Freeway \\(y = 2\\) (k=2)**: Car span covers x=0 at turns 62 and 63.\n- **Freeway \\(y = 3\\) (k=3)**: Car span covers x=0 at turns 62 and 63 (same as k=2).\n- **Freeway \\(y = 4\\) (k=4)**: Car span covers x=0 at turns 62 and 63 (same as k=2).\n- **Freeway \\(y = 5\\) (k=5)**: Car span covers x=0 at turns 62 and 63 (same as k=2).\n- **Freeway \\(y = 6\\) (k=6)**: Car span covers x=0 only at turn 56. For turns after 56, y=6 is safe.\n- **Freeway \\(y = 7\\) (k=7)**: Car span never covers x=0 (always safe).\n- **Freeway \\(y = 8\\) (k=8)**: Car span never covers x=0 (always safe).\n\nThe player must not be on a freeway row (y=1 to 8) at a turn when x=0 is covered by the car on that row. Rows y=0 and y=9 are safe with no cars.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\nThe player starts at y=2 at turn 56. To reach y=9, a minimum of 7 upward moves (U actions) are required, as the vertical distance is 7 units. Moving down or staying would increase the number of turns, so H=7 is the minimal possible.\n\nA sequence of 7 consecutive U actions achieves this:\n- At turn 56, y=2 (safe, as y=2 is not covered at t=56).\n- Action U: At turn 57, y=3 (safe, as t=57 < 62, so y=3 not covered).\n- Action U: At turn 58, y=4 (safe, as t=58 < 62, so y=4 not covered).\n- Action U: At turn 59, y=5 (safe, as t=59 < 62, so y=5 not covered).\n- Action U: At turn 60, y=6 (safe, as y=6 is only unsafe at t=56, and t=60 > 56).\n- Action U: At turn 61, y=7 (safe, as y=7 always safe).\n- Action U: At turn 62, y=8 (safe, as y=8 always safe).\n- Action U: At turn 63, y=9 (reached goal, safe).\n\nThis sequence avoids all collision points:\n- The player is never on y=1 (unsafe at t=60) or on y=2 to y=5 at t=62 or 63.\n- The path stays within bounds (y between 0 and 9).\n\nThus, H=7 is minimal, and the action sequence is all U for turns 56 to 62.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U \\\\\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U \\\\\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U \\\\\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U \\\\\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U \\\\\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U \\\\\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at that exact turn T, then collision.\n\nNote: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y, and then moves to y' for the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on the freeway y_T (the starting freeway at that turn). Therefore, when we are at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car on freeway k, we are given its state at turn t1=58. We then compute its span at any future turn T (>=58) as:\n\nIf the car is right-moving (d='right'):\n  At turn T: head = initial_head + s*(T-58)\n            tail = initial_tail + s*(T-58)\n  So the span is [tail, head] (since head > tail for right-moving? Actually, note the initial state: for right-moving, the head is the leading part? But the initial state for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail) but the update for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the table, all cars in this problem are right-moving. So we only need the right-moving formula.\n\nHowever, let's look at the initial data:\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-24, tail=-35, direction='right', speed=12.\nSo at turn T, the car on freeway 1 will be at:\n  head(T) = -24 + 12*(T-58)\n  tail(T) = -35 + 12*(T-58)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and 0 is in the interval [tail(T), head(T)] (for right-moving, note that tail(T) <= head(T) because the car moves right and the head is the front? Actually, the initial head=-24 and tail=-35, so tail < head, so the span is [tail, head] and increasing.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and since τ is the tail and h is the head, and τ < h, then the interval is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo we require that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, then 0 should not be in [tail_k(T), head_k(T)].\n\nOur goal: start at y58=4, and we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. Since we can only move one step per turn (or stay), the minimal number of turns in the absence of cars would be 5 (because 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 moves up). But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8. Note that when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1..8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe start at y=4 (freeway 4) at turn 58. We need to check at each turn T and for the freeway we are on (y_T) whether the car on that freeway covers 0 at turn T.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions from turn 58 to turn (58+H-1) so that at turn (58+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can try to simulate the minimal path: 4->5->6->7->8->9. But we must check at each step if we are safe on the freeway we step on at that turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision, but since we want minimal turns, we prefer going up unless forced to wait or detour.\n\nWe are going to compute the car positions at the relevant turns and freeways.\n\nFirst, note that the cars move at constant speed. The critical point is when the car spans cover 0. We can compute for each freeway the time intervals (if any) when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: since the cars are moving continuously in one direction, the span at 0 might happen only once? Actually, for a given freeway, the car is moving and the span is shifting. For a right-moving car, the entire span moves to the right. So the time when 0 is in the span is a contiguous interval? Actually, it is a single contiguous interval (if at all) because the car is moving at constant speed.\n\nFor a freeway k, the car's head and tail at time T (relative to t1=58) are:\n\n  head(T) = h0 + s*(T-58)\n  tail(T) = t0 + s*(T-58)\n\nWe require that at time T, the player is on freeway k and 0 is in [tail(T), head(T)].\n\nBut note: the car is on freeway k at every turn? Actually, the car is fixed on freeway k. So we can precompute for each freeway k the set of T (>=58) such that 0 is in [t0+s*(T-58), h0+s*(T-58)].\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  t0 + s*(T-58) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-58)\n\n  => (0 - h0) / s <= T-58 <= (0 - t0) / s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving right, and t0 < h0, and s>0, then:\n\n  T-58 >= ceil( (0 - h0) / s )? Actually, we are dealing with integers? The positions are integers? The problem does not specify, but the initial positions are integers and speeds are integers, and T is integer. So we can use integer arithmetic.\n\nHowever, note that the span is a continuous interval? But the problem states the span as [a, b] and we are at integer positions? Actually, the car is at integer positions? The head and tail are given as integers, and they move by integer steps? So the entire span is integer.\n\nSo the condition for collision at turn T on freeway k is:\n\n  tail(T) <= 0 <= head(T)\n\n  => t0 + s*(T-58) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-58)\n\nWe can solve:\n\n  T >= 58 + ceil( (0 - h0) / s )   ? But note: because we require 0 <= h0+s*(T-58) => T-58 >= ceil( (0 - h0) / s )? Actually, if (0-h0) is negative, then (0-h0)/s is negative, so T-58 >= a negative number is always true? So let's rearrange:\n\nFrom t0 + s*(T-58) <= 0: \n  s*(T-58) <= -t0   => T-58 <= (-t0) / s   (if s>0, then we can divide and the inequality remains the same)\n\nBut note: t0 is negative (from the data, all t0 and h0 are negative), so -t0 is positive.\n\nSimilarly, from 0 <= h0 + s*(T-58):\n  s*(T-58) >= -h0   => T-58 >= (-h0) / s\n\nSo:\n\n  (-h0)/s <= T-58 <= (-t0)/s\n\nBut note: because the car is moving right and the initial head and tail are negative, the car will eventually cross 0.\n\nHowever, we must note that h0 is the head and t0 is the tail? In the initial data for freeway 1: h0=-24, t0=-35. Then:\n\n  (-h0)/s = 24/12 = 2\n  (-t0)/s = 35/12 ≈ 2.9166\n\nSo T-58 must be in [2, 2.9166]. Since T is integer, T-58 can only be 2? because 2.9166 is between 2 and 3? So T=58+2=60: then we check:\n\nAt T=60:\n  head(60) = -24 + 12*(60-58) = -24 + 24 = 0\n  tail(60) = -35 + 24 = -11\n  So the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? Yes.\n\nBut wait: the condition is 0 in [tail, head]. The head is 0 and tail is -11, so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=59: \n  head(59) = -24 + 12*1 = -12\n  tail(59) = -35 + 12 = -23 -> then 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nAt T=61:\n  head(61)= -24 + 12*3 = 12\n  tail(61)= -35 + 36 = 1 -> then the span is [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=60? Actually, at T=60: [ -11, 0] includes 0. At T=61: [1,12] doesn't include 0. But note: the condition is inclusive? Yes, because it says \"0 in Span(T)\".\n\nSo freeway 1: unsafe at T=60.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every freeway.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway k the set of turns T (>=58) when the car on k covers 0.\n\nLet dT = T-58.\n\nThen for freeway k, the condition is:\n\n  t0_k + s_k * dT <= 0 <= h0_k + s_k * dT\n\n  => dT >= ceil( ( -h0_k ) / s_k )   ??? Let me be careful.\n\nActually, we have two inequalities:\n\n1. h0_k + s_k * dT >= 0   => dT >= ceil( ( -h0_k ) / s_k )   [if s_k>0, which it is]\n\n2. t0_k + s_k * dT <= 0   => dT <= floor( ( -t0_k ) / s_k )\n\nBut note: the first inequality: because dT must be integer, we require dT >= ceil( ( -h0_k ) / s_k )? Actually, we can write:\n\n  dT >= ceil( ( -h0_k ) / s_k )   [because if ( -h0_k ) / s_k is fractional, then we need the next integer]\n\nSimilarly, the second: dT <= floor( ( -t0_k ) / s_k )   [because if ( -t0_k ) / s_k is fractional, then we take the integer part?]\n\nBut let's test with freeway1:\n\n  h0_k = -24, s_k=12 -> ( - (-24) ) / 12 = 24/12 = 2 -> ceil(2)=2.\n  t0_k = -35 -> ( - (-35) ) / 12 = 35/12 ≈ 2.9166 -> floor(2.9166)=2.\n\nSo dT in [2,2] -> only dT=2 -> T=60.\n\nBut wait: at dT=2, we have:\n  head = -24+24=0 -> 0>=0 -> true.\n  tail = -35+24=-11 -> -11<=0 -> true.\n\nSo that works.\n\nAnother example: freeway 2: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n  h0=-24, s=6 -> (-h0)/s = 24/6=4 -> ceil(4)=4.\n  t0=-35 -> (-t0)/s=35/6≈5.8333 -> floor(5.8333)=5.\n\nSo dT must be between 4 and 5 inclusive? So T=58+4=62 and 58+5=63? But let me check:\n\nAt dT=4: T=62\n  head = -24 + 6*4 = -24+24=0 -> 0>=0 -> true.\n  tail = -35+24=-11<=0 -> true -> unsafe.\n\nAt dT=5: T=63\n  head = -24+30=6\n  tail = -35+30=-5 -> then 0 is in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\nAt dT=3: T=61\n  head=-24+18=-6 -> 0>=-6 -> true? But the head condition is head(T)>=0? Actually, we require 0<=head(T). At dT=3: head(T)=-6, so 0<=-6? false -> condition fails.\n\nAt dT=6: T=64\n  head=-24+36=12\n  tail=-35+36=1 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway2: unsafe at T=62 and 63.\n\nBut according to our formula: dT>=4 and dT<=5 -> so 4 and 5 -> T=62,63.\n\nSo the formula: dT must be in [ ceil( (-h0)/s ) , floor( (-t0)/s ) ].\n\nBut note: we must also ensure that ceil( (-h0)/s ) <= floor( (-t0)/s ). If not, then no collision.\n\nNow, let's compute for all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: h0=-24, t0=-35, s=12\n  (-h0)/s = 24/12=2 -> ceil=2\n  (-t0)/s = 35/12≈2.9166 -> floor=2\n  => dT in [2,2] -> T=60\n\nFreeway 2: h0=-24, t0=-35, s=6\n  (-h0)/s=24/6=4 -> ceil=4\n  (-t0)/s=35/6≈5.8333 -> floor=5\n  => dT in [4,5] -> T=62,63\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? The data: (-24,-35,right,6) -> same as freeway2: T=62,63\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway2: T=62,63\n\nFreeway 5: same: T=62,63\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-83,right,36)\n  (-h0)/s=48/36=1.333 -> ceil=2\n  (-t0)/s=83/36≈2.3055 -> floor=2\n  => dT in [2,2] -> T=60\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-95,right,48)\n  (-h0)/s=48/48=1 -> ceil=1\n  (-t0)/s=95/48≈1.979 -> floor=1\n  => dT in [1,1] -> T=59\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7: (-48,-95,right,48) -> T=59\n\nSummary of unsafe turns per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T=60\nFreeway 2: T=62,63\nFreeway 3: T=62,63\nFreeway 4: T=62,63\nFreeway 5: T=62,63\nFreeway 6: T=60\nFreeway 7: T=59\nFreeway 8: T=59\n\nWe start at turn 58 at y=4.\n\nWe want to move from y=4 to y=9. The minimal steps are 5 (if we go up every turn: 4->5->6->7->8->9). The turns would be:\n\nTurn 58: start at y=4\nTurn 59: move U -> y=5\nTurn 60: move U -> y=6\nTurn 61: move U -> y=7\nTurn 62: move U -> y=8\nTurn 63: move U -> y=9 -> done at turn63 (H=6: from turn58 to turn63, 6 turns? Actually, we start at turn58 and we do 5 moves: \n  turn58: we are at y4 (we haven't moved yet, so we are about to choose an action for turn58 to go to turn59)\n  We need to output actions for turn58, turn59, turn60, turn61, turn62.\n\nBut note: after 5 moves (5 actions) we would be at turn63? Let me count:\n\n  At turn58: we are at y4. Then we take action a58 to move to next state at turn59: y59 = y58 + a58.\n  Then at turn59: we are at y59, then take a59 to get to y60, etc.\n\nSo to get to y=9 from y=4, we need 5 upward moves. So we would take 5 consecutive U actions? Then the sequence of turns:\n\n  Turn58: U -> y59=5\n  Turn59: U -> y60=6\n  Turn60: U -> y61=7\n  Turn61: U -> y62=8\n  Turn62: U -> y63=9\n\nBut we must check at each turn T (from 58 to 62) the freeway we are on (y_T) and whether that freeway has a car that covers 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: at turn58: we are at y58=4 -> freeway4. But at turn58, the car on freeway4: we computed that freeway4 is unsafe at T=62 and 63. But at T=58: \n  freeway4: dT=0 -> head=-24, tail=-35 -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn59: we are at y59=5 -> freeway5. Check freeway5: unsafe at T=62,63. At T=59: \n  freeway5: dT=1 -> head=-24+6*1=-18, tail=-35+6=-29 -> 0 not in [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nAt turn60: we are at y60=6 -> freeway6. Check: freeway6 is unsafe at T=60. \n  freeway6: dT=2 -> head=-48+36*2 = -48+72=24, tail=-83+72=-11 -> span=[-11,24] -> 0 is in there -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot be on freeway6 at turn60.\n\nTherefore, the direct path fails at turn60.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway6 at turn60.\n\nWe have several options:\n\nOption 1: delay moving to freeway6 until after turn60. But note freeway6 is only unsafe at turn60. At turn61: \n  freeway6: dT=3 -> head=-48+108=60, tail=-83+108=25 -> [25,60] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nSo if we can avoid being on freeway6 at turn60, but then move to freeway6 at turn61, that would be safe.\n\nBut how? We start at y58=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 in minimal steps.\n\nWe must change the timing so that we are not on freeway6 at turn60.\n\nWe could:\n\n- Stay at y=5 for one extra turn? But then we might be safe at freeway5 at turn60? But freeway5 is safe at turn60? \n  freeway5: unsafe at T=62,63. At T=60: dT=2 -> head=-24+12= -12? Wait, freeway5: same as freeway2: s=6, so at dT=2: \n    head=-24+6*2 = -12, tail=-35+12=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nBut we are at turn59: we are at y=5 (if we moved up at turn58). Then at turn59 we could choose to stay at y=5 (so at turn59 we are at y=5, and then at turn60 we are still at y=5). Then at turn60, we are on freeway5 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn60, we move to y=6 -> but then at turn60 we are still on freeway5? No: when we move at turn60, we are at y60=5 (from the previous state) and then we take an action to go to y61. So at turn60, we are at freeway5 -> safe. Then at turn61: we are at y61=6 (if we moved up at turn60). Then we are on freeway6 at turn61 -> which is safe (as we saw above).\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn58: U -> y59=5 (freeway5) -> safe (freeway5 at T=59: safe as above)\nTurn59: S -> stay at y59=5? Actually, wait: at turn59 we are at y59=5. Then we take an action at turn59 to stay: so y60=5. Then at turn60, we are at freeway5 -> safe.\nTurn60: U -> y61=6 (freeway6) -> and at turn61: we are on freeway6 at T=61 -> safe? \n  freeway6 at T=61 (dT=3): head=-48+36*3= -48+108=60, tail=-83+108=25 -> [25,60] -> no 0 -> safe.\nThen we continue:\nTurn61: U -> y62=7 (freeway7) -> now at turn62: freeway7. But freeway7 is unsafe at T=59? We computed freeway7 unsafe at T=59? But we are at T=62. \n  freeway7: unsafe at T=59? Actually, we computed freeway7: unsafe only at T=59. At T=62: dT=4 -> head=-48+48*4=-48+192=144, tail=-95+192=97 -> [97,144] -> no 0 -> safe.\nBut wait, we have to check every freeway we step on.\n\nSo at turn62: we are at freeway7 -> safe.\n\nThen:\nTurn62: U -> y63=8 (freeway8) -> at turn63: freeway8. Freeway8 is unsafe at T=59? At T=63: dT=5 -> head=-48+48*5= -48+240=192, tail=-95+240=145 -> [145,192] -> safe.\n\nThen:\nTurn63: U -> y64=9 -> done at turn64.\n\nBut we are at turn64? And we started at turn58. So we did 6 actions? \n  turn58: U\n  turn59: S\n  turn60: U\n  turn61: U\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: U -> at the end of turn63 we are at y64=9? \n\nActually, after the last action at turn63, we are at the next state: so at turn64 we are at y=9. But the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at the end of the sequence. The last action is at turn63, and after that we are at y64=9. So we have taken H=6 actions? The sequence from t58 to t58+5 (since t starts at 0 for the sequence? The problem says: sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning from turn t1 to t1+H-1. So we have H actions: a58, a59, a60, a61, a62, a63 -> 6 actions.\n\nBut we could do better? The minimal without cars is 5. Is there a way in 5?\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid freeway6 at turn60 by going down? But that would take more steps.\n\nOr we could go up faster? We cannot, because we can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: we could be on freeway4 at turn60? But we start at freeway4 at turn58. If we stay at freeway4 for two turns? Then:\n\nTurn58: S -> stay at y58=4 -> then at turn59: still at freeway4 -> safe? \n  freeway4 at T=59: dT=1 -> head=-24+6= -18, tail=-35+6=-29 -> [-29,-18] -> safe.\nTurn59: S -> at turn60: freeway4 -> safe? \n  freeway4 at T=60: dT=2 -> head=-24+12=-12, tail=-35+12=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\nBut then we are still at y=4 at turn60. Then we need to go up 5 times from turn60 to turn64: then we get to y=9 at turn64? That's 6 actions as well.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to skip freeway6 entirely by going from freeway5 to freeway7? But we can only move one step per turn. So we have to go through freeway6.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? For example, if we go down to freeway3 at some point? That might avoid the collision but then we have to go back, so more steps.\n\nSo the minimal might be 6.\n\nBut let me check if we can do 5.\n\nWe require to be at y=9 at turn58+5-1 = 62? So at turn62 we must be at y=9. But we start at y=4 at turn58. So we need to go up 5 times in 5 actions: \n  turn58: U -> y59=5\n  turn59: U -> y60=6\n  turn60: U -> y61=7\n  turn61: U -> y62=8\n  turn62: U -> y63=9 -> but wait, after the last action at turn62, we are at y63=9? Then we are done at the end of turn62? Actually, the problem says: we take H actions and then at the state after the last action we are at (0,9). So the last action is at turn t1+H-1. We start at t1=58. So after H actions, the last state is at turn58+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1: so the actions are at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then after the last action, we are at turn t1+H. So we require at turn t1+H the y coordinate is 9.\n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn t1=58. Then we take action at turn58: that leads to state at turn59. Then action at turn59 leads to state at turn60, etc.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t1+H, we need to have taken H actions.\n\nWe start at turn58: we haven't taken any action yet. Then we take H actions: at turn58,59,...,58+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn58+H.\n\nWe require y_{58+H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 5: because we start at y58=4, and we need 5 moves up: \n  after 1st (turn59): y=5\n  after 2nd (turn60): y=6\n  after 3rd (turn61): y=7\n  after 4th (turn62): y=8\n  after 5th (turn63): y=9\n\nSo H=5: then we are at turn58+5=63? Actually, the state after the last action is at turn58+H. So if H=5, then we are at turn63.\n\nBut in the direct path, we had a collision at turn60: at that turn we are at freeway6 and it's unsafe.\n\nIs there a way to be at freeway6 at a different turn? \n\nWe must be at freeway6 at some turn. The unsafe turn for freeway6 is only turn60. So if we can be at freeway6 at turn61 or turn59? \n\nBut we are at freeway5 at turn59 (if we went up at turn58). Then we can go to freeway6 at turn59? Actually, we can only move one step per turn. So we go from freeway5 to freeway6 at turn59? But that would mean at turn59 we are at freeway6? \n\nBut at turn59, we start at freeway5 (if we went up at turn58) and then we take an action at turn59 to go up to freeway6. Then at turn59, we are still at freeway5 (because the move happens after the collision check? Actually, the problem states:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd note: at turn T, we are at y_T (the position at the beginning of the turn). Then we choose an action that moves us to the next freeway for the next turn. So the freeway we are on during turn T is the one we started at.\n\nTherefore, when we are at freeway5 at turn59 and we choose to move up, then during turn59 we are at freeway5 -> safe (freeway5 at T=59 is safe). Then we move to freeway6 at the next state (turn60). So at turn60, we are at freeway6 -> and that is unsafe at T=60.\n\nSo we cannot avoid being at freeway6 at turn60 if we go from freeway5 at turn59 to freeway6 at turn60.\n\nBut what if we delay the move to freeway6? We already considered that: by staying at freeway5 at turn59 and then moving at turn60: but then at turn60 we are at freeway5 (if we stay) and then we move to freeway6 at turn61? \n\nActually, if we do:\n\nTurn58: U -> y59=5 (freeway5 at turn59: safe)\nTurn59: S -> so we stay at freeway5 at turn59? Then at the end of turn59, we are still at freeway5. Then at turn60: we are at freeway5 (because the state at the start of turn60 is the same as at the end of turn59: freeway5). Then we can choose to move up at turn60: then at turn60 we are at freeway5 (so safe, because freeway5 at T=60: safe) and then we move to freeway6 at turn61. Then at turn61 we are at freeway6 -> safe (as computed).\n\nBut then we have:\n\nTurn58: U -> y59=5\nTurn59: S -> y60=5\nTurn60: U -> y61=6\nTurn61: U -> y62=7\nTurn62: U -> y63=8\nTurn63: U -> y64=9\n\nThat's 6 actions. We reach y=9 at turn64.\n\nBut we can try to make up the time? We lost one turn by staying. Is there a way to avoid the collision without an extra step?\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to freeway7 at an earlier time? But we have to go through freeway6.\n\nAnother idea: we might avoid freeway6 entirely? But we have to go from freeway5 to freeway7? That requires two moves: but we can only move one per turn. So we must go through freeway6.\n\nBut note: we can go down to freeway4 and then up? That would take more steps.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut wait: we have another problem: freeway7 and freeway8 are unsafe at T=59. But in our plan, we are at freeway5 at T=59 and freeway5 at T=60, so we avoid freeway7 and 8 at T=59. Then we are at freeway6 at T=61, freeway7 at T=62, freeway8 at T=63: and we checked that these are safe.\n\nBut we must also check freeway7 at T=62: safe, freeway8 at T=63: safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn58: U -> to y59=5\n  Turn59: S -> stay at y59=5 (so at turn59 we are at freeway5: safe; at turn60 we start at freeway5: safe)\n  Turn60: U -> to y61=6 (at turn60: we are at freeway5: safe; then move to freeway6 for the next state, but at turn60 we are safe because we are on freeway5)\n  Turn61: U -> to y62=7 (at turn61: we are at freeway6: safe? yes, because freeway6 at T=61: dT=3 -> [25,60] -> safe)\n  Turn62: U -> to y63=8 (at turn62: freeway7: T=62 -> dT=4 -> [97,144] -> safe)\n  Turn63: U -> to y64=9 (at turn63: freeway8: T=63 -> dT=5 -> [145,192] -> safe)\n\nThen at turn64 we are at y=9. So we have taken 6 actions: from turn58 to turn63.\n\nBut note: the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that leads to (0,9). So we output:\n\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: S\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We lost one turn by staying. Can we avoid that?\n\nWhat if we go down at some point? For example, at turn59 we go down to freeway4? Then:\n\nTurn58: U -> y59=5 (freeway5 at T=59: safe)\nTurn59: D -> y60=4 (freeway5 at T=59: safe? yes, and then we move to freeway4 at turn60. But at turn60 we are at freeway4: safe? \n  freeway4 at T=60: dT=2 -> head=-24+12=-12, tail=-35+12=-23 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn60: we are at freeway4 -> safe. Then we need to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps: \n  turn60: U -> y61=5\n  turn61: U -> y62=6\n  turn62: U -> y63=7\n  turn63: U -> y64=8\n  turn64: U -> y65=9 -> that's 7 actions: worse.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go faster by not staying? But we have to avoid freeway6 at T=60.\n\nWe might try to be at freeway6 at a different time? But we can only control the timing by staying or moving vertically.\n\nAnother idea: can we be at freeway6 at turn59? That would require that at turn58 we are at freeway5 and then at turn58 we move up to freeway6? Then at turn58: we start at freeway4 -> safe. Then we move up to freeway5 at turn59? No, we can only move one per turn. So we cannot jump from freeway4 to freeway6 in one move.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut note: we have another constraint: freeway7 and freeway8 are unsafe at T=59. In our plan we are not on freeway7 or 8 at T=59, so that's safe.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 5 actions? Let's see the timing:\n\nWe require to be at y=9 at turn63 (if H=5). The path must go through freeway6 at some turn. The only unsafe turn for freeway6 is T=60. So we must avoid being at freeway6 at T=60. But in the 5-step plan, we are at freeway6 at T=60 (if we go 4->5 at T58, 5->6 at T59, then at T60 we are at freeway6). \n\nCan we be at freeway6 at a different turn? The only other possibility is to be at freeway6 at T=58 or T=59 or T=61, etc.\n\nBut we start at T58 at freeway4. To get to freeway6, we need two moves: \n  Option A: \n      T58: U -> freeway5 at T59\n      T59: U -> freeway6 at T60 -> unsafe at T60.\n\n  Option B: \n      T58: S -> freeway4 at T59\n      T59: U -> freeway5 at T60\n      T60: U -> freeway6 at T61 -> then we are at freeway6 at T61: safe, but then we are at freeway6 at T61 and we still have to go to 7,8,9: which would be T61: freeway6, T62: freeway7, T63: freeway8, then T64: freeway9? But then we need 6 actions to get to y=9 at T64: \n          T58: S -> y59=4\n          T59: U -> y60=5\n          T60: U -> y61=6\n          T61: U -> y62=7\n          T62: U -> y63=8\n          T63: U -> y64=9 -> 6 actions.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we go up twice quickly and then slow down? \n\n  T58: U -> y59=5\n  T59: U -> y60=6 -> unsafe at T60? \n\nBut we have to avoid that.\n\nSo we must have at least one non-up move? We can either stay or go down. Either way, we add at least one extra step.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6.\n\nBut note: in the answer format, we output the actions for turns starting at t1=58.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: S\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n\nBut wait, we have 6 actions. After these 6 actions, we are at turn64: y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the minimal number of turns H. H is the number of actions? So H=6.\n\nBut let me confirm the last action: at turn63 we move up from y63=8 to y64=9. Then we are done.\n\nBut we must also check if we are safe at every turn:\n\nTurn58: at freeway4 -> T=58: dT=0 -> freeway4: [-35,-24] -> safe.\nTurn59: at freeway5 -> T=59: dT=1 -> freeway5: head=-24+6= -18, tail=-35+6=-29 -> [-29,-18] -> safe.\nTurn60: at freeway5 -> T=60: dT=2 -> freeway5: head=-24+12=-12, tail=-35+12=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\nTurn61: at freeway6 -> T=61: dT=3 -> freeway6: head=-48+36*3=60, tail=-83+108=25 -> [25,60] -> safe (0 not in).\nTurn62: at freeway7 -> T=62: dT=4 -> freeway7: head=-48+48*4=144, tail=-95+192=97 -> [97,144] -> safe.\nTurn63: at freeway8 -> T=63: dT=5 -> freeway8: head=-48+48*5=192, tail=-95+240=145 -> [145,192] -> safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway8 at turn63: safe. Then we move to freeway9 (which is safe because y=9 has no cars) at turn64.\n\nSo this sequence works.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=5? We saw it's not possible because we would be at freeway6 at turn60.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go up to freeway3? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: S\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6. The answer format is to output the actions for the turns.\n\nHowever, we must check if we can do without the stay? For example, if we go down at some point to avoid the collision and then go up, but that would take more steps.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up to freeway7 earlier? But we cannot because we can only move one per turn. To get to freeway7 we must go through freeway6.\n\nBut note: we can avoid freeway6 at the critical time by going to freeway5 and then freeway6 in a different timing. We already considered that and we needed a stay.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up twice and then down? \n\n  T58: U -> y59=5\n  T59: U -> y60=6 -> collision at T60? so we cannot do that.\n\nOr:\n\n  T58: U -> y59=5\n  T59: D -> y60=4 -> then at T59: freeway5 safe, at T60: freeway4 safe? \n      Then we are at y=4 at T60. Then we need to go up 5 times: \n          T60: U -> y61=5\n          T61: U -> y62=6 -> at T62: freeway6 -> safe? \n          T62: U -> y63=7\n          T63: U -> y64=8\n          T64: U -> y65=9 -> 7 actions: worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut note: we have freeway1 unsafe at T=60 and freeway7 and 8 at T=59. We avoided freeway6 at T=60 by being at freeway5 that turn. And we were not on freeway7 or 8 at T=59.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nBut let me write the answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: S\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n}\n\nNote: The last action is at turn63, and then at turn64 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence. The sequence ends at turn63, and the state after that is (0,9). So it is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 58 is 6. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 58, starting at \\(y = 4\\), moving up to \\(y = 5\\) avoids collision on freeway 4 (safe at \\(T = 58\\)).\n- At turn 59, staying at \\(y = 5\\) avoids collision on freeway 5 (safe at \\(T = 59\\)) and also avoids freeways 7 and 8, which are unsafe at \\(T = 59\\).\n- At turn 60, moving up to \\(y = 6\\) occurs from \\(y = 5\\), so the player is on freeway 5 at \\(T = 60\\) (safe), avoiding freeway 6, which is unsafe at \\(T = 60\\).\n- At turn 61, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) is safe on freeway 6 (safe at \\(T = 61\\)).\n- At turn 62, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) is safe on freeway 7 (safe at \\(T = 62\\)).\n- At turn 63, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe on freeway 8 (safe at \\(T = 63\\)).\n\nAfter the action at turn 63, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 64.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: S\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) on turn t_1 = 60. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they move left or right with a given speed. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that turn. The span moves with the car's speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: When the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if they move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T they are still on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, we check the car on y_T, and whether 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=60, and we need to compute where they are at future turns.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSince direction is right, and head=0, tail=-11, that means the car is from -11 to 0 at t=60? But direction right, so it's moving right.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, it's head and tail decreasing, for right-moving, increasing.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]? But it says head and tail.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the freeway 1 entry: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSo head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12(T-60), 0 + 12(T-60)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut collision is when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is at (0,y).\n\nNow, player position: at each turn, player is at (0, y_t)\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, if y_T = k, then we need that 0 is not in the car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe car on freeway k is fixed for that row; each freeway has one car, I assume, from the table.\n\nTable has one entry per freeway, so one car per freeway.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: car is right-moving, span at T: [ -11 + 12(T-60) , 0 + 12(T-60) ] = [12(T-60) - 11, 12(T-60)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nHead h=-12, tail τ=-23? But for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at t1.\n\nThen at T: [ -23 + 6(T-60) , -12 + 6(T-60) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-12, -23, right, 6) — it says the same for 2,3,4,5.\n\nLet me list all:\n\nFreeway 1: (head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=12) → span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0] for right-moving? I think I have confusion.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" no, it says:\n\n\"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSo for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? But [τ, h] with τ=-11, h=0, so from -11 to 0.\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 12(T-60), 0 + 12(T-60) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: head=-12, tail=-23, direction right, speed=6\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nHere for freeway 2, h=-12, τ=-23, so head=-12, tail=-23, so since right-moving, at t1, car is from -23 to -12.\n\nAt T, [ -23 + 6(T-60), -12 + 6(T-60) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2? Head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6 — yes, same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: (24, -11, right, 36) — head=24, tail=-11, direction right, speed=36\n\nSpan at t1: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 36(T-60), 24 + 36(T-60) ]\n\nBut tail=-11, head=24, so from -11 to 24, which is length 35, but moving right.\n\nFreeway 7: (48, 1, right, 48) head=48, tail=1, direction right, speed=48\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [1, 48]\n\nAt T: [1 + 48(T-60), 48 + 48(T-60)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (48,1,right,48)\n\nNow, player starts at y=5 at t=60.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5 to y=9, difference of 4, so minimum 4 turns if we can go up each time, but we have to avoid cars on the freeways when we are on them.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position (0, y_t), so we are on freeway y_t at that turn, and we check the car on freeway y_t at that turn for collision.\n\nIf we move, at turn t, we choose action, which affects y_{t+1}, but at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nNow, from y=5, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways to cross are y=6,7,8 to reach y=9 from y=5.\n\ny=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we start at y=5 at t=60, so at turn 60, we are on y=5.\n\nNow, for y=5, there is a car? Freeway 5 has a car: from above, freeway 5: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6\n\nAt turn T, span: [ -23 + 6(T-60), -12 + 6(T-60) ]\n\nAt turn 60, T=60, span: [ -23 + 0, -12 + 0] = [-23, -12], so 0 is not in this, since -23 to -12, all negative, so no collision at t=60 on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, we need to go up to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 has no car? Freeways are from 1 to 8, y=9 is the goal, no car, so when we reach y=9, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is the bottom, but we start from y=5.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so when y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, minimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find when it is safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and at turn T, when is 0 not in the car's span on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars are moving, we need to find for each freeway, the times when 0 is not covered by the car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car right-moving, span at T: [ -11 + 12(T-60), 12(T-60) ] because [ -11 + 12(ΔT), 0 + 12(ΔT) ] where ΔT = T - 60\n\nSet low = -11 + 12ΔT, high = 12ΔT\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high, i.e., -11 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nSince high = 12ΔT, low = high - 11, because the length is from low to high, difference 11.\n\n-11 to 0 is length 11, so span length 11.\n\nSo 0 in span if low <= 0 <= high, i.e., high -11 <= 0 <= high\n\nSince low = high - 11\n\nSo 0 <= high and high -11 <= 0, so high -11 <= 0 <= high, so 0 <= high <= 11\n\nBut high = 12ΔT, so 0 <= 12ΔT <= 11\n\nSince ΔT >=0, 12ΔT >=0 always, so 12ΔT <= 11, so ΔT <= 11/12 < 1\n\nSince ΔT integer (turns), ΔT =0, 12*0=0 <=11, yes; ΔT=1, 12*1=12>11, not <=11.\n\nSo for ΔT=0, high=0, low=-11, so 0 is in [ -11,0], yes, at ΔT=0, T=60, 0 is included? High=12*0=0, low=-11, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is included, so yes, collision if on freeway 1 at T=60.\n\nBut player is not on freeway 1 at t=60, player is on y=5.\n\nFor freeway 1, 0 in span when 12ΔT <=11, so ΔT=0 only, since ΔT integer, ΔT=0.\n\nΔT=0: 12*0=0 <=11, yes; ΔT=1:12>11, no; ΔT=2:24>11, no, etc.\n\nSo only at T=60, 0 is in span for freeway 1. For other times, since car moving right, after T=60, high=12ΔT >0, low=high-11, so for ΔT>=1, high>=12, low>=1, so 0 < low, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, before T=60, but we start from T=60, so for T>60, freeway 1 is safe except at T=60.\n\nBut at T=60, if player is on y=1, collision, but player is on y=5.\n\nNow freeway 2: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 + 6ΔT, -12 + 6ΔT ] where ΔT = T-60\n\nLow = -23 + 6ΔT, high = -12 + 6ΔT\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -23 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -12 + 6ΔT\n\nLeft: -23 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so ΔT <= 3\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo for ΔT from 2 to 3 inclusive.\n\nΔT=2: low = -23 +12 = -11, high= -12 +12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=3: low= -23 +18= -5, high= -12+18=6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=4: low= -23+24=1, high= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nΔT=1: low= -23+6= -17, high= -12+6= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not included.\n\nΔT=0: low=-23, high=-12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, unsafe when ΔT=2 or 3, i.e., T=62 or 63.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car parameters. Head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6, so same as above, unsafe at T=62,63.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=62,63.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at T=62,63.\n\nNow freeway 6: head=24, tail=-11, right, speed=36\n\nSpan at T: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-11, 24] at t1, so at T: [ -11 + 36ΔT, 24 + 36ΔT ]\n\nLow = -11 + 36ΔT, high = 24 + 36ΔT\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high\n\n-11 + 36ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 36ΔT\n\nLeft: -11 + 36ΔT <= 0 => 36ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for integer ΔT, ΔT=0\n\nRight: 0 <= 24 + 36ΔT, always true since ΔT>=0, 24+36ΔT >=24>0.\n\nSo only when ΔT=0, low=-11<=0, high=24>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor ΔT>=1, low = -11+36 >=25>0, so not include 0.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe only at T=60.\n\nBut player not on it at t=60.\n\nNow freeway 7: head=48, tail=1, right, speed=48\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [1,48]? τ=1, h=48, so [1,48]\n\nAt T: [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT]\n\nLow =1 +48ΔT, high=48+48ΔT\n\n0 in span? low =1+48ΔT >=1>0 for ΔT>=0, so always low >=1 >0, so 0 never in span. Thus freeway 7 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, (48,1,right,48), so low=1+48ΔT>0, always safe.\n\nNow, freeway 1 unsafe at T=60 only, but player not on it.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=60 only.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 unsafe at T=62 and 63.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at t=60.\n\nAt t=60, on freeway 5, which is unsafe? Freeway 5 unsafe at T=62 and 63, but at T=60, is it safe?\n\nFor freeway 5, at ΔT=0, T=60, low=-23, high=-12, both negative, 0 not in, so safe at t=60.\n\nSimilarly, we need to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on freeways 2,3,4,5 at t=62 or 63? Freeways 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at t=62 and 63.\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4,5 correspond to y=2,3,4,5.\n\nPlayer is currently at y=5.\n\nAt turn t=60, y=5, which is safe since at t=60, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we want to go up, D or S would delay.\n\nBut we might need to wait to avoid unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe freeways are y=2,3,4,5 at t=62 and 63.\n\ny=1 is unsafe only at t=60, which has passed.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=60, passed.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, player at t=60: y=5, safe.\n\nAt turn t=60, we choose action for y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter action, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1=60.\n\nSet τ = t - 60, so τ=0 is turn 60.\n\nPlayer position at τ: y_τ\n\nAt τ=0, y=5.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some τ = H-1, since sequence from t=60 to t=60+H-1, with H turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, at time t1+H, position after H steps.\n\nLet's see the time.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is y_T.\n\nAfter choosing action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nThe turns are discrete.\n\nStart: at turn T=60, position y=5.\n\nWe perform action a_{60}, then at turn 61, position y_{61} = y_{60} + Δy_{60}\n\nThen at turn 61, we are on y_{61}, check collision for that freeway at turn 61.\n\nAnd so on, until we reach y=9.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions from a_{60} to a_{60+H-1} such that after H actions, at turn 60+H, y_{60+H} =9, and for each turn from 60 to 60+H-1, when we are on y_t, no collision.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nThe last turn is when we reach y=9.\n\nSuppose at turn T, y_T =9, then we are done, no need for further action.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions until we are at y=9.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions starting from t1.\n\nNow, minimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=5, need to go to y=9, so at least 4 up moves, but we might need to stay or down if forced, but probably not necessary.\n\nThe problem is to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at τ=2 or 3 (t=62 or 63), since those are unsafe times for those freeways.\n\nτ=2 is t=62, τ=3 is t=63.\n\nAt τ=0, t=60, y=5 safe.\n\nWe need to leave y=5 before t=62 if possible, or be elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are always safe, we can go there anytime.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=6,7,8 or something.\n\nFrom y=5, we can go directly to y=6,7,8,9 with up moves.\n\nBut at certain times, some freeways are occupied.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): unsafe only at τ=0, so for τ>=1, safe.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): unsafe at τ=2,3; safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 (y=3): same, unsafe at τ=2,3\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): unsafe at τ=2,3\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): unsafe at τ=2,3; safe at τ=0,1,4,...\n\nAt τ=0, safe; τ=1: let's see, for freeway 5, at τ=1, t=61, ΔT=1, low= -23 +6*1= -17, high= -12+6= -6, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=2: unsafe, τ=3: unsafe, τ=4: low= -23+24=1>0, high=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): unsafe only at τ=0, safe for τ>=1.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): always safe\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): always safe\n\ny=9: no car, safe.\n\nPlayer at τ=0, y=5, safe.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nPossible to go up every turn, but let's see if we can be at y=9 by τ=4 or something.\n\nSuppose we go up at every turn.\n\nStart τ=0, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_60: U, so at τ=1, t=61, y=6.\n\nAt t=61, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at τ=1 (ΔT=1), as above, safe since unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nThen action a_61: U, at τ=2, t=62, y=7.\n\ny=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nThen action a_62: U, at τ=3, t=63, y=8.\n\ny=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nThen action a_63: U, at τ=4, t=64, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check for each turn if collision.\n\nAt turn t=60: y=5, freeway 5, τ=0, safe.\n\nt=61: y=6, freeway 6, τ=1, safe (since freeway 6 unsafe only at τ=0)\n\nt=62: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=63: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nt=64: y=9, not on freeway, or no car, safe.\n\nAnd we reached in 4 turns: from t=60 to t=63 actions, position at t=64 is y=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=60 to t=63: U,U,U,U.\n\nH=4 turns.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt t=62, y=7, safe.\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4,5 are unsafe at t=62, but we are on y=7, not on those, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly at t=63, we are on y=8.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6 at t=61.\n\nt=61, τ=1, freeway 6: low = -11 + 36*1 = -11+36=25, high=24+36=60, so [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo in this case, we can reach in 4 turns with all U.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let's see if at some point we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on y=5 at t=62, it would be unsafe, but we are not, we move up.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? But from y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 up moves, so H=4 is minimum.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=60 to t=60+H-1, actions, then at t=60+H, position.\n\nIn this case, with actions at t=60,61,62,63 (4 actions), at t=64, y=9.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier? Start at t=60, y=5.\n\nAfter one action, t=61, y=6 max.\n\nAfter two, t=62, y=7 max.\n\nAfter three, t=63, y=8 max.\n\nAfter four, t=64, y=9.\n\nCannot reach before t=64, since at t=60 we are at y=5.\n\nt=60: y=5, after first action to y=6 at t=61, etc., so y=9 at earliest t=64.\n\nSo H=4 is minimum.\n\nAnd with all U, it works, as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=62, we are on y=7, which is safe, but freeways 2-5 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there is any constraint that might force us to wait.\n\nFor example, if we had to go through y=5 at unsafe time, but we start from there and leave early.\n\nPerhaps we can consider going down, but that would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nNow, the actions: for turn t=60: U\n\nt=61: U\n\nt=62: U\n\nt=63: U\n\nThen at t=64, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1 =60, H=4, so actions from t=60 to t=63.\n\nt=60,61,62,63.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U\n\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\n\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\n\nTurn 63: a_{63} = U\n\nIn the sequence, we don't list the position after, just the actions.\n\nIn the collision note, it says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in our case, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check car on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor example, at t=60, we are on y=5, check car on y=5 at t=60, safe.\n\nThen we move U, so at t=61, we are on y=6, check car on y=6 at t=61, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSuppose at some point we move to a freeway that is unsafe at that time, but in this path, not the case.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 1 is unsafe at t=60, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6, it says (24, -11, right, 36), but at t=60, span is [-11,24], which includes 0, so unsafe, but we are not on y=6 at t=60.\n\nAt t=61, when we are on it, not unsafe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 at t=61.\n\nt=61, ΔT=1, span: [-11 +36(1), 24 +36(1)] = [25, 60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we should consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 6, tail is -11, head=24, but direction right, so at t=60, it is from -11 to 24, including 0.\n\nBut at t=61, moved right by 36, so from 25 to 60.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, another thing: the player starts at (0,5), and we need to reach (0,9), which we do.\n\nIn the sequence, all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in answer format, it lists the actions, not H separately.\n\nIn the box, it lists the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, H=4.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? Impossible, as above.\n\nPerhaps if we start by going down, but that would take more turns to come back, so worse.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nSequence: all U.\n\nBut in the freeway state, freeway 6 has (24, -11, right, 36), but -11 to 24, which is from left to right? Tail -11, head 24, so if right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so yes.\n\nBut at t=60, it covers x=0, but we not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, at t=62, unsafe, but we avoid by not being there.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y=6 at t=61, y=7 at t=62, etc.\n\nt=62: y=7, freeway 7: car (48,1,right,48), at t=62, ΔT=2, span [1+48*2, 48+48*2] = [1+96, 48+96] = [97,144], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAlways safe, as said.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), and cars are on the freeway, but only when on that y, and at that turn, we check.\n\nNo other interactions.\n\nSo minimal sequence is four U moves.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nt_1 = 60\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U\n\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\n\nTurn 62: a_{62} = U\n\nTurn 63: a_{63} = U\n\nIn the sequence, from t=60 to t=63, four actions.\n\nAnd at t=64, position (0,9).\n\nIn the collision note, it says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd when moving, at turn T, we are on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nIn our case, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we go up multiple, but no, each action only changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns to move from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 4, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve this.\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n- Car spans are computed relative to turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = T - 60\\)):\n  - **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe only at \\(\\Delta T = 0\\) (turn 60).

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 61 and the player starts at (0,6). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The player can only move vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay). The horizontal position is always 0.\n\nCollision condition: At turn T, if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn T, the car on freeway k has a span that includes 0, then a collision occurs.\n\nNote: The player is only on a freeway at the exact turn when they are on that row. When moving from one row to another, they are only considered to be on the starting row at the beginning of the turn and then move to the next row at the end of the turn. Therefore, during the turn when they are moving, they are not on the destination row until the next turn.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and check for collisions on the rows we are on at each turn.\n\nThe car movement:\n- For a right-moving car: at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since at t1, the car is from tau to h, and it moves right with speed s per turn).\n- Similarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the given car state is at turn t1 (which is 61). So for any future turn T (>=61), we can compute the car's span.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=6 to y=9 in minimal H (number of turns) without any collision.\n\nSince the goal is above (from 6 to 9) and we want minimal turns, we would prefer to go up. However, we must avoid the cars on rows 6,7,8 (and also if we have to go through rows 5,4, etc., but that would be longer so we avoid that).\n\nBut note: we start at row 6 at turn 61. We can move up to row 7, then 8, then 9. That would take 3 moves (if we move up every turn). However, we must check if at the time we are on row 7 and 8, the cars on those rows do not have a span that includes 0.\n\nLet's compute the car positions at the relevant turns.\n\nFirst, note that the player starts at y=6 at turn 61. Then:\n\nTurn 61: at row 6. We must check row 6 at turn 61: is there a car on row 6 that covers 0?\nRow 6 has: (60, 25, right, 36). This is a right-moving car. The span at turn 61 is [25 + 36*(61-61), 60 + 36*(61-61)] = [25,60]. 0 is not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nNow, we plan to move up. But we must check the next rows at the turns we will be on them.\n\nWe are going to consider the minimal H: 3 turns (if possible). That would be:\nTurn 61: action U -> then at turn 62, we are at row 7.\nTurn 62: action U -> then at turn 63, we are at row 8.\nTurn 63: action U -> then at turn 64, we are at row 9. And then we stop (H=3, but note: we take 3 actions: at t61, t62, t63, and at t64 we are at 9).\n\nBut we must check at each turn the row we are on.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 61: row 6 -> check row 6 at turn 61: safe (as above).\n- Turn 62: row 7 -> check row 7 at turn 62: \n  Row 7: car (96, 49, right, 48)\n  At turn 62 (T=62, t1=61): \n      span = [49 + 48*(62-61), 96 + 48*(62-61)] = [49+48, 96+48] = [97, 144]\n  0 is not in [97,144] -> safe.\n- Turn 63: row 8 -> check row 8 at turn 63:\n  Row 8: car (96,49,right,48) same as row7? Actually, the table says:\n      Freeway 8: (96,49,right,48)\n  So at turn 63: [49 + 48*(63-61), 96+48*2] = [49+96, 96+96] = [145, 192] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 64 we are at row 9 and we don't need to check row 9 because there are no freeways above 8? Actually, the goal is row 9, and the freeways are from 1 to 8. So row 9 has no cars. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, a sequence of 3 Ups would work: \nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H is the minimal number of turns. So H=3.\n\nBut let me double-check: \nAt turn 61: we start at row6. We do U -> at the end of turn61, we move to row7? But note the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\nAt turn61, we are at y_{61}=6. Then we take a_{61}=U -> so y_{62}=6+1=7.\n\nAt turn62: we are at row7. Then we take a_{62}=U -> y_{63}=8.\nAt turn63: we take a_{63}=U -> y_{64}=9.\n\nSo we reach at turn64. But the sequence of actions is for turns 61,62,63 (t=0,1,2 relative to t1) and H=3.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence from t1 to t1+H-1. So we have H=3, and the actions at 61,62,63.\n\nIs there a possibility that we can do it in less than 3? From 6 to 9: we need to go up 3 steps. Each step takes one turn. So no, 3 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we do nothing? We have to move. So minimal is 3.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car that might hit us during these turns? We have checked:\n\nTurn61: row6 -> safe.\nTurn62: row7 -> safe.\nTurn63: row8 -> safe.\n\nBut what about row6 at turn62? We are not on row6 at turn62, because we moved to row7 at the end of turn61. Similarly, we are not on row7 at turn63? \n\nActually, at each turn, we are only on one row: at the beginning of the turn, we are at a row, and then we move at the end of the turn. So:\n\n- At the beginning of turn61: we are at row6 -> check row6 at turn61: safe.\n- Then we move to row7 at the end of turn61 -> so at the beginning of turn62, we are at row7 -> check row7 at turn62: safe.\n- Then we move to row8 at the end of turn62 -> at the beginning of turn63: row8 -> check row8 at turn63: safe.\n- Then we move to row9 at the end of turn63 -> and at the beginning of turn64: row9 -> but we don't need to check because there are no cars on row9. And we have reached.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on row6 at turn62: what is it? \nRow6 car: (60,25,right,36) at turn61. At turn62: [25+36, 60+36] = [61,96]. 0 is not in [61,96] -> safe, but we are not on row6 at turn62 anyway.\n\nSimilarly, row7 at turn63: \nRow7: at turn63: [49+48*2, 96+48*2] = [49+96, 96+96] = [145,192] -> safe, but we are on row8 at turn63, not row7.\n\nSo the sequence of 3 Ups is safe.\n\nBut let me check the other rows to see if there is any problem that might force us to take a detour? For example, if one of the rows we need to pass through had a car that would be at 0 at the time we are there, then we would have to wait. But in this case, all the cars on the rows we are using (6,7,8) are far to the right at the given turns.\n\nBut note: the cars on rows 1-5? We are not going to use them because we are going upward. But what if we had to go down? We don't need to because we are going to 9 from 6.\n\nBut wait: the problem says avoiding collisions only on freeways 1..8. And row0 and row9 are safe? Actually, the player can be on row0 and row9 without worrying about cars (since cars are only on 1..8). But we start at 6 and go to 9, so we don't go to row0.\n\nBut note: if we try to go up and we are at row8 and we try to go to row9, that's safe.\n\nHowever, let me check row6 again at turn61: the car is [25,60] at turn61. 0 is not in [25,60]. But what about the car on row6 at turn61? It's safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on row1: (12,1,right,12). At turn61: [1+12*(61-61), 12+12*0] = [1,12] -> 0 not in. But we are not on row1.\n\nSimilarly, row2: (-6,-17,right,6) at turn61: [-17+6*0, -6+6*0] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in. But we are not on row2.\n\nBut what about if we had to wait? We don't need to.\n\nBut is there any car that might come to 0 at a later turn? For example, on row6: the car is moving right at 36 per turn. At turn61: [25,60]. Then at turn62: [25+36,60+36]=[61,96]. So it's moving away. Similarly, row7: at turn61: [49,96] -> turn62: [49+48,96+48]=[97,144] -> moving away. Row8: same.\n\nBut what about the other rows? We are not using them.\n\nBut let me check row5: at turn61: car (-6,-17,right,6) -> at turn61: [-17,-6]. Then at turn62: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0]. Oh! at turn62, the car on row5 has a span [-11,0]. Does 0 lie in [-11,0]? Yes, because the span is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\".\n\nSo at turn62, if the player is on row5, they would collide. But we are not on row5 at turn62. We are on row7.\n\nSimilarly, row4: same car as row5? The table says for row2,3,4,5: all have (-6,-17,right,6). So:\n\nRow4: at turn61: [-17,-6] -> at turn62: [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes. But again, we are not on row4.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we had to go through row5? We don't.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 3 Ups.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for H=3, we have:\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\n\nBut let me write the answer as per format.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". And we found H=3.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we can do it in 2 turns? That would require moving two steps per turn? But the actions only allow +1, -1, 0 per turn. So no, 3 is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, if we could move two at once? But no, the moves are only U, D, S.\n\nSo H=3.\n\nBut wait: what about row9? The goal is to be at (0,9). We reach at turn64 (after the third action). So we have taken 3 actions and the player is at row9 at turn64. So H=3 is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action is at t1+H-1. Then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at the new position.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the position at turn t1+H-1 is the last state? Actually, the update is:\n\nAfter action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo if we start at t1 (turn61) at y61=6, then:\nAfter a61: we get y62.\nAfter a62: we get y63.\nAfter a63: we get y64.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} to be 9? But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and \"minimal number of turns H\".\n\nAnd note: the position after H actions: we have taken H actions (at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1) and then the position at turn t1+H is the result.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nLet me parse: the actions are taken at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position after these actions? \n\nBut the update: \nAt turn t, we take action a_t and then we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after the first action (at t1), we have y_{t1+1}.\nAfter the last action (at t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThis means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action (which is taken at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9. But that would be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo if we start at turn t1 at y_{t1} = 6, then:\n\n- After 0 actions: we are at y_{t1} = 6 (so we haven't reached 9).\n- After 1 action: at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = 6,7, or 5.\n- After 2 actions: at turn t1+2, we are at ... \n- After k actions: at turn t1+k, we are at a new position.\n\nWe require that at some turn T, we are at 9. And we are taking actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to find H and a sequence of H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) such that after these H actions, we are at 9. But that would be at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem states: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? That would then change the position to something else.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H-1 actions? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nI think there is a confusion.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> that's H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn we take an action) the player is at (0,9)? But the position at the beginning of that turn? Or after the action?\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". But y_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t (before the action).\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta, which might not be 9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of a turn? And then we don't care what happens after? But the goal is to be at (0,9) and then we stop.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify if we require to stay or just pass through.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nSo if at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, then we have already reached. Then we don't need to take the action at that turn? But the sequence requires an action at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take an action (like S) to stay, then we are still at 9 at the next turn. But the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9, which we have. Then we take an action and then we are still at 9? But the problem doesn't require that we remain, only that we reach.\n\nBut note: if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t, then we have reached. So we could stop at that turn? But the sequence requires H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and at the end of the last action (i.e., at turn t1+H) we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have arrived at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn (which might move us away, but that doesn't matter because we have already been at 9 at that turn).\n\nBut that seems odd because we might leave immediately.\n\nAlternatively, we can interpret that we require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that doesn't necessarily have to keep us there? But the goal is just to reach.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"avoid collisions\" at every turn we are on a freeway. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we are on row9. Since row9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), we don't check for collision. Then we take an action (say S) and we stay at 9? Or we take U and go to 10? But 10 is invalid? The grid is y=0..9, so if we take U at row9, we stay at 9? Or the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but clamped to [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we stay at 9.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we remain at 9, only that we have been at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo in our plan:\n\nWith 3 actions (H=3), we have:\n\nAt turn61 (beginning): y61=6 -> we take U -> then at the end of turn61: y62=7.\n\nAt turn62 (beginning): y62=7 -> take U -> y63=8.\n\nAt turn63 (beginning): y63=8 -> take U -> y64=9.\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 61+3-1 = 63, we are at 9? But at the beginning of turn63, we are at 8, not 9. Then we take the action and then we become 9 at turn64.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn64.\n\nBut we want at the beginning of turn63 to be 9? That would require that we get to 9 at the beginning of turn63.\n\nHow? \n\nWe start at turn61: y61=6.\nAfter one action at turn61: we get to y62. To be at 9 at the beginning of turn62? That would require y62=9. But we can only move 1 per turn. So from 6 to 9 in one turn? Impossible.\n\nWith two actions: \nTurn61: action -> y62 = 6 + (U: +1) = 7.\nTurn62: action -> y63 = 7 + (U: +1) = 8.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn63: y63=8.\n\nWith three actions:\nTurn63: action -> y64 = 8+1 = 9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn64: y64=9.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we need to set H-1 = the turn index offset such that at the beginning of that turn we are at 9.\n\nSo we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nWe see that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn64 (which is t1+3). So we want t1+H-1 = t1+3 => H-1=3 => H=4.\n\nThat means we need 4 actions? But that would be:\n\nAction at t61: ... and then at the beginning of t61+4-1 = t64, we are at 9.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can do:\n\nTurn61: U -> y62=7\nTurn62: U -> y63=8\nTurn63: U -> y64=9\nThen at the beginning of turn64, we are at 9. And we have taken 3 actions? But we need 4 actions? Then we would take an action at turn64? But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn64, so we have reached. Then we can do any action? But the sequence must be of length H=4.\n\nBut the problem says: we have to take H actions, and at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nWith H=4, t1+H-1 = 61+4-1=64. So at the beginning of turn64, we must be at 9.\n\nHow do we get to 9 at the beginning of turn64? \n\nWe start at turn61: y61=6.\nAfter turn61: y62 = 6 + (action) -> if we do U: 7.\nAfter turn62: y63 = 7 + (action) -> if U:8.\nAfter turn63: y64 = 8 + (action) -> if U:9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn64: y64=9.\n\nAnd we have taken 3 actions: at t61, t62, t63. But the problem requires 4 actions? Then we would have to take a fourth action at turn64? \n\nBut then the sequence is of 4 actions: \nTurn61: U\nTurn62: U\nTurn63: U\nTurn64: ? \n\nBut at turn64, we are at 9. We can do S (stay). Then y65=9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 61+4-1=64, we are at 9. And we are. Then we take the fourth action at turn64 (which is the last in the sequence) and then we are still at 9 at turn65.\n\nSo the minimal H would be 4? But that would be one more than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to 9 faster? But we cannot.\n\nBut wait: if we do nothing? Then we stay at 6. We have to move up.\n\nAnother possibility: we move up twice and then wait? But that would be:\n\nTurn61: U -> y62=7\nTurn62: U -> y63=8\nTurn63: S -> y64=8  (not 9)\nTurn64: U -> y65=9 -> then at the beginning of turn65: 9.\n\nThen we would set H=5: so that t1+H-1 = 61+5-1=65 -> at the beginning of turn65: 9.\n\nBut that is longer.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4: we take 4 actions and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn64.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 at the beginning of turn63? Only if we can move 3 in one turn? No.\n\nOr at the beginning of turn62? Move from 6 to 9 in one action? No.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at 9 at the beginning of a turn is turn64.\n\nTherefore, H=4.\n\nBut then we have to provide 4 actions. The first three are U, and the fourth can be S (to stay at 9).\n\nNow, we must check that during these turns, we avoid collisions.\n\nWe already checked turns 61,62,63 for rows 6,7,8 respectively.\n\nNow, at turn64: we are at row9 at the beginning. Then we take action S (or U, but U would stay at 9). Since row9 has no cars, no collision. But we are on row9 at turn64? The freeways are 1-8, so no collision.\n\nBut what about the actions we take? We are at row9 at turn64, then we do S: we stay at 9. That is safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn61: U\nTurn62: U\nTurn63: U\nTurn64: S\n\nBut we could do U again at turn64? Then we stay at 9 (since 9+1=10 -> clamped to 9). So same.\n\nBut the problem is: at turn64, we are at row9. We don't care about the action as long as we avoid collision. But since we are on row9, there is no car, so any action is safe.\n\nBut we must check the previous turns again: we have already checked that:\n\nTurn61: row6 -> safe\nTurn62: row7 -> safe\nTurn63: row8 -> safe\n\nAnd turn64: row9 -> safe.\n\nSo this sequence works.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4 that might be shorter in time? No, because we must wait until turn64 to be at 9 at the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at 9 at the beginning of an earlier turn? No.\n\nBut what if we move faster? We can't.\n\nOr if we move down and then up? That would be longer.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut this seems to contradict our initial understanding.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the condition: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nWe must have y at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 equals 9.\n\nThe earliest turn when we can have y=9 at the beginning is turn64 (because at turn61:6, turn62:7, turn63:8, turn64:9).\n\nTherefore, H must satisfy: t1+H-1 = 64? -> 61+H-1=64 -> H=64-60=4.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nThus, the sequence is:\n\nTurn61: U\nTurn62: U\nTurn63: U\nTurn64: S (or U, but S is natural)\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions at the turns we are on the freeways.\n\nWe have:\n\nAt turn61: on row6 -> car6: (60,25,right,36) at turn61: [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAt turn62: on row7 -> car7: (96,49,right,48) at turn62: [49+48, 96+48] = [97,144] -> safe.\nAt turn63: on row8 -> car8: (96,49,right,48) at turn63: [49+48*2, 96+48*2] = [49+96,96+96]=[145,192] -> safe.\n\nAt turn64: on row9 -> no car -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is valid.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". At turn64, we are on row9, so no freeway, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal H\", and we have H=4.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? That would require y_{t1+3-1}=y_{63}=9. But we showed that y63=8. So impossible.\n\nAlternatively, if we start by doing nothing? Then we are at 6 at turn62. Then we need to get to 9 by turn63? That would require moving from 6 to 9 in one action? Impossible.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut the initial thought was 3 moves, but that gets us to 9 at turn64, which is the beginning of turn64, and then we have to take an extra action.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check the car on row1 at turn64? We are not on row1, but just to be sure: row1 at turn64: car (12,1,right,12) -> at turn64: [1+12*(64-61), 12+12*3] = [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> 0 not in. Safe, but irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, row2 at turn64: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17+6*3, -6+6*3] = [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nRow3: same as row2? The table shows row2,3,4,5 have the same car: (-6,-17,right,6). So row3 at turn64: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nRow4: same.\n\nRow5: same.\n\nRow6: at turn64: [25+36*3, 60+36*3] = [25+108,60+108]=[133,168] -> safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4, and the sequence is U, U, U, S.\n\nWe could do U, U, U, U (which would also keep us at 9) but S is equivalent.\n\nTherefore, I will write S.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: S\n}\n\nNote: The problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t1=61.\n\nSo that's the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn 61, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 4. The sequence of actions must ensure the player avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. The car positions are updated based on their direction and speed, and collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway row \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the car's span on that row includes the x-coordinate 0.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial State (Turn 61)**:\n  - Player position: \\(y_{61} = 6\\)\n  - Goal: Reach \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 61 + 4 - 1 = 64\\), i.e., \\(y_{64} = 9\\).\n- **Movement Constraints**: Each action changes the y-coordinate by at most ±1 per turn. Moving from 6 to 9 requires at least 3 upward moves, but the earliest the player can be at y=9 at the **beginning** of a turn is turn 64:\n  - Turn 61: Start at y=6.\n  - Turn 62: After one U, y=7.\n  - Turn 63: After two U's, y=8.\n  - Turn 64: After three U's, y=9 (beginning of turn 64).\n- **Collision Avoidance**:\n  - **Turn 61 (y=6)**: Car on row 6 has span \\([25 + 36 \\times (61-61), 60 + 36 \\times (61-61)] = [25, 60]\\). 0 ∉ [25, 60] → safe.\n  - **Turn 62 (y=7)**: Car on row 7 has span \\([49 + 48 \\times (62-61), 96 + 48 \\times (62-61)] = [97, 144]\\). 0 ∉ [97, 144] → safe.\n  - **Turn 63 (y=8)**: Car on row 8 has span \\([49 + 48 \\times (63-61), 96 + 48 \\times (63-61)] = [145, 192]\\). 0 ∉ [145, 192] → safe.\n  - **Turn 64 (y=9)**: No cars on row 9 (freeways only up to y=8) → safe.\n- **Sequence**:\n  - Actions: Three \"U\" (up) moves to reach y=9 by turn 64, and one \"S\" (stay) at turn 64 to remain at y=9 (since the goal is achieved at the beginning of turn 64, and \"S\" ensures no movement).\n  - Minimal \\(H = 4\\): The player reaches y=9 at the beginning of turn 64 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 64\\)).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 62, and the player is at (0,7). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement in y is:\n  U: y = y + 1\n  D: y = y - 1\n  S: y = y\n\nWe start at y=7 and want to get to y=9. The minimal vertical moves would be two ups (U) in a row. However, we must avoid collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn T, the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span (at turn T) includes the x-coordinate 0.\n\nNote: The player is at x=0 always.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of the turn T the player is still on the freeway y. Then at turn T+1, the player will be on freeway y'. Therefore, we only check the freeway we are on at the current turn.\n\nSo at each turn t (starting from t1=62), we are at position (0, y_t). We must ensure that if y_t is between 1 and 8, then at turn t, the car on freeway y_t does not have a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=62 for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to compute the car's span at any future turn T (relative to t1, so T = 62 + delta_t, where delta_t = T - 62).\n\nFor a car at freeway k at turn 62:\n  head = h, tail = tau, direction d (either 'left' or 'right'), speed s.\n\nBut note: the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: \n   Span(T) = [h - s*(T - 62), tau - s*(T - 62)]\n\nRight-moving:\n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T - 62), h + s*(T - 62)]\n\nHowever, note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (24, 13, right, 12) -> but note that for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the table says for right-moving: \n   \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\"\n\nBut in the table, the car on freeway1 is given as (24, 13, right, 12). \n  So at t1=62: head=24, tail=13? That would imply the car is from 13 to 24? But that's increasing? Actually, for a right-moving car, the head is the front, which is the larger coordinate? But in the update they write [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? \n\nLet me reinterpret: \n\nThe problem states for a right-moving car:\n   Span(t1) = [tau, h]   -> meaning the car occupies from tau to h (with tau <= h) and moves to the right.\n\nSo at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n   Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> but note that for left-moving, the head is the front which is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says: \n        \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at h and the tail at tau? And h < tau? That would be confusing.\n\nLooking at the example for freeway1: (24,13,right,12) -> so head=24, tail=13? Then at t1, the car is from 13 to 24? But if it's moving right, then the head (front) is at 24? So the car is from 13 to 24? Then the span is [13,24] at t1.\n\nBut the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that tau is the left end and h is the right end? Then in this case, tau=13 and h=24.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the left end? and tail the right end? \n\nBut the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] and then moves left. So if h is the head and tau the tail, then h < tau? \n\nActually, the problem does not specify which is larger. We must look at the update.\n\nFor freeway1: (24,13,right,12) -> if we take the given as (head, tail) then head=24, tail=13. For right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the car spans from tail to head: [13,24]. Then at time T, it becomes [13 + s*(T-t1), 24 + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, if we have (head, tail) and head is the front (leftmost) and tail the rear (rightmost), then the car spans from head to tail: [head, tail] (if head < tail). Then when moving left, the entire car moves left: [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the problem, the representation for left-moving is given as (h, tau) and then the span at t1 is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(dt), tau - s*(dt)].\n\nSo we will use:\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn t1=62:\n\nIf d == 'right':\n   The car at time T (>=62) occupies [tau + s*(T-62), h + s*(T-62)]\n\nIf d == 'left':\n   The car at time T occupies [h - s*(T-62), tau - s*(T-62)]\n\nNow, we are only concerned when the player is at freeway k at turn T, and then we check if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 62 at y=7.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns from 62 onward until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince the minimal moves are 2 (two U), we try to see if we can do it in 2 turns.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nAt turn 62: we are at y=7. We must check freeway 7 at turn 62.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> direction right, so at time T=62:\n   span = [tail + s*(0), head + s*(0)]? Actually, at T=62, the offset is 0.\n\nBut note: the state is given at t1=62.\n\nSo for freeway7: tail = -95, head = -48? Wait, the representation is (head, tail) = (-48, -95). But for right-moving, we have the head as the rightmost? Then the car spans from tail to head: [-95, -48]. \n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> so tau is the tail and h is the head. So in the table, the car is given as (h, tau) = (-48, -95). Then tau = -95, h = -48.\n\nSo at T=62, the car on freeway7 is [tau, h] = [-95, -48]. \n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [-95, -48]? -> no, because -48 is less than 0? Actually, -48 is negative and 0 is positive -> so 0 is not in the interval? \n\nWait: the interval is from -95 to -48. So the car is at negative x. Therefore, at T=62, the car is not covering x=0.\n\nBut note: the car moves right with speed 48 per turn.\n\nAt turn T, the car will be at:\n   [ -95 + 48*(T-62), -48 + 48*(T-62) ]\n\nWe are at turn 62: so we are safe at freeway7 at turn62.\n\nNow, we plan the next actions:\n\nOption 1: Move up at turn62 -> then at turn63 we are at y=8.\n\nThen at turn63, we are at freeway8. Then we must check freeway8 at turn63.\n\nFreeway8: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> same as freeway7? \n   At turn63: T-62=1 -> \n        tail = -95 + 48*1 = -47\n        head = -48 + 48*1 = 0\n   So the car spans [-47, 0]. So at x=0, the car is at 0? The span includes 0? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"collision occurs if 0 is in the span\". The span is [a, b] meaning from a to b inclusive? And 0 is in [-47,0]? Yes, because 0 is the endpoint.\n\nSo at turn63, if we are on freeway8, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do U at turn62 to go to y=8 at turn63 because at turn63 we are on freeway8 and the car on freeway8 at turn63 includes 0.\n\nOption 2: Stay at turn62? Then at turn62 we are still at y=7. Then at turn63 we are at y=7. Then we can try to move up at turn63 to y=8 at turn64.\n\nBut we want to minimize turns. Also, we might consider moving down? But that would take us away from 9.\n\nLet's try to do U at turn62: then at turn63 we are at y=8 -> but we saw that at turn63, freeway8 has a car that covers 0 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we might do D at turn62? That would take us to y=6. Then we are at freeway6 at turn62? Actually, we are at freeway7 at turn62: we already checked and it's safe. Then at turn62 we do D -> then at turn63 we are at y=6.\n\nBut then we are at freeway6 at turn63.\n\nCheck freeway6: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> at turn62: [tau, h] = [-83, -48] -> safe at turn62.\n\nAt turn63 (T=63, dt=1): \n   freeway6: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=6 at turn63 and we want to get to y=9. That would require 3 moves: U, U, U? So at least 3 more turns? That would be 4 turns from start? But we started at turn62 at y=7.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to avoid the collision at freeway8 at turn63 by delaying the move to freeway8 until the car has passed.\n\nSo let's compute the car on freeway8:\n\nThe car: (h, tau) = (-48, -95), d=right, s=48.\n\nAt turn T, the car is at [ -95 + 48*(T-62), -48 + 48*(T-62) ]\n\nWe want to know when the car leaves x=0. The car covers 0 if:\n   -95 + 48*(T-62) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-62)\n\nSolve for T:\n\nFirst, the car leaves 0 when the head (the right end) passes 0. So when -48 + 48*(T-62) >= 0? Actually, we require 0 to be in the interval.\n\nSo we require:\n   -95 + 48*(T-62) <= 0   and   0 <= -48 + 48*(T-62)\n\nBut note: the second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-62) \n  => 48*(T-62) >= 48\n  => T-62 >= 1\n  => T >= 63\n\nAnd the first inequality: \n   -95 + 48*(T-62) <= 0 \n   => 48*(T-62) <= 95\n   => T-62 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n   => T <= 62 + 1.979 = 63.979 -> so T<=63 (since T integer) -> T=63.\n\nSo only at T=63: \n   The car is at [ -95+48= -47, -48+48=0] -> so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=64: \n   [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1, 48] -> does not include 0.\n\nTherefore, freeway8 is safe at turn64 and beyond? Actually, the car has passed 0.\n\nSo if we are at freeway8 at turn64, we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, what about freeway7? \n\nFreeway7: same car? Actually, no: freeway7 has the same type of car: (-48,-95,right,48). At turn62: [-95, -48] -> safe.\n\nAt turn63: [-47,0] -> so if we are at freeway7 at turn63, then 0 is included -> collision.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway7 at turn62 and we are safe. Then at turn62 we can choose to stay or move.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We are at y=7 at turn62.\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption A: \n   turn62: S (stay at y=7) -> then at turn63 we are at y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn63: unsafe (because the car covers 0) -> collision.\n\nOption B:\n   turn62: D -> then at turn63 we are at y=6 -> then we can avoid the collision at freeway7 at turn63? But we are not on freeway7 at turn63, we are on freeway6.\n\nBut what about freeway6 at turn63? We computed: safe.\n\nThen at turn63 we are at y=6. Then we can move:\n\nOption B1: turn63: U -> then at turn64 we are at y=7. Check freeway7 at turn64: \n   freeway7 car: at turn64: dt=2 -> [ -95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [1,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn64: we can do U again to y=8 -> then at turn65 we are at y=8. Check freeway8 at turn65: \n   freeway8 car: at turn65: dt=3 -> [ -95+48*3, -48+48*3] = [-95+144, -48+144] = [49,96] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn65: we are at y=8, then we do U again to y=9 -> then we are done.\n\nSo that would be:\n   turn62: D -> to y=6\n   turn63: U -> to y=7\n   turn64: U -> to y=8\n   turn65: U -> to y=9\n\nTotal H=4 moves? But we started at turn62 and we do 4 actions: at turn62,63,64,65 -> so we reach at turn65? Actually, the position at turn65 is y=9.\n\nBut note: the minimal might be less? \n\nWhat if we wait at y=7 until the car on freeway7 passes? The car on freeway7 is unsafe at turn63? But at turn64 it becomes safe. So:\n\nAt turn62: we are at y=7 (safe at turn62). Then we do S at turn62 -> then we are at y=7 at turn63? But at turn63, the car on freeway7 covers 0 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=7 at turn63.\n\nWe must leave freeway7 by turn63. How?\n\nWe can move down at turn62 to y=6 (as above) or up to y=8? But moving up to y=8 at turn63 is unsafe because freeway8 is unsafe at turn63.\n\nSo the only safe move at turn62 is down? \n\nBut what about staying at y=7 and then at turn63 we move? But at turn63 we are at freeway7 and we collide? So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must leave freeway7 at turn62? \n\nAt turn62, we can choose:\n   U: leads to freeway8 at turn63 -> unsafe at turn63 (freeway8)\n   D: leads to freeway6 at turn63 -> safe at turn63 (freeway6: [-47,-12] doesn't have 0)\n   S: leads to freeway7 at turn63 -> unsafe.\n\nSo only D is safe at turn62.\n\nThen we go to y=6 at turn63.\n\nAt turn63, we are at y=6. Now we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go to 9. So we want to go up.\n\nOption: U at turn63 -> to y=7 at turn64.\n\nCheck freeway7 at turn64: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn64 we are at y=7. Then we can do U to y=8 at turn65.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn65: [49,96] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn65 we are at y=8. Then we do U to y=9 at turn66 -> done.\n\nSo sequence:\n   turn62: D\n   turn63: U\n   turn64: U\n   turn65: U\n   turn66: U? Wait, at turn65 we are at y=8, then we do U at turn65 to get to y=9 at turn66? Then we need 5 actions? \n\nBut note: we start at turn62 at y=7. We do:\n\n   turn62: D -> y=6 (at turn63)\n   turn63: U -> y=7 (at turn64)\n   turn64: U -> y=8 (at turn65)\n   turn65: U -> y=9 (at turn66)\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn66? Then H=5? But we did 4 actions: from t62 to t65 (4 actions: t62, t63, t64, t65) and at the end of turn65 we are at y=9? \n\nWait: \n   At turn62: we start at y=7, then we apply a_{t62} -> then at the beginning of turn63 we have y_{63} = y62 + delta.\n\nSo the position at the start of turn63 is the result of the action at turn62.\n\nTherefore, after 1 action (at turn62) we are at y=6 at turn63.\n\nAfter 2 actions (turn62 and turn63) we are at y=7 at turn64.\n\nAfter 3 actions: at turn65 we are at y=8.\n\nAfter 4 actions: at turn66 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we need 4 actions to get to y=9 at turn66.\n\nBut we want to minimize the number of turns H. Here H=4? But note the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nWe start at t1=62. We do actions at t=62,63,64,65 -> that's 4 actions, so H=4? Then the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning t=0,1,2,3 -> which corresponds to t62, t63, t64, t65.\n\nBut can we do it in 3 actions? \n\nWe start at y=7 at turn62.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn62 + (H-1). So after H-1 moves.\n\nIf H=3, then we do 3 actions: at t62, t63, t64 -> and at turn65 we are at y=9.\n\nThe moves: \n   We need to go from 7 to 9: that's +2, so two U and one other move? But we have 3 moves: we must have two U and one other (which could be S or D). But D would set us back.\n\nAlternatively, we could do: U, S, U? Then:\n   turn62: U -> y=8 at turn63\n   turn63: S -> y=8 at turn64\n   turn64: U -> y=9 at turn65.\n\nBut we must check the collisions.\n\nAt turn62: we are at y=7 (safe, as we saw) -> then we do U -> at turn63 we are at y=8. But at turn63, freeway8 is unsafe (car covers 0) -> collision at turn63.\n\nSo that fails.\n\nWhat about: D, U, U? \n   turn62: D -> y=6 at turn63\n   turn63: U -> y=7 at turn64\n   turn64: U -> y=8 at turn65 -> then we are at y=8 at turn65, not y=9.\n\nThen we need another U at turn65 to get to y=9 at turn66.\n\nSo that's 4 moves.\n\nAlternatively: \n   turn62: S -> but unsafe at turn63? So we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: use two U's but skip the unsafe freeway8 at turn63 by going to freeway8 at a later turn.\n\nWe saw that freeway8 is safe at turn64 and beyond? \n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn62. We cannot get to y=8 at turn64 without going through y=7 at turn63? \n\nHow about:\n\n   turn62: U -> to y=8 at turn63 -> unsafe? So we must avoid.\n\n   turn62: D -> to y=6 at turn63 -> safe\n   turn63: U -> to y=7 at turn64 -> safe (freeway7 at turn64: [1,48] safe)\n   turn64: U -> to y=8 at turn65 -> safe (freeway8 at turn65: [49,96] safe)\n   turn65: U -> to y=9 at turn66 -> done.\n\nBut that's 4 moves.\n\nCan we combine and do a double move? No, we can only move one step per turn.\n\nWhat if at turn63, after going to y=6, we do U twice? \n\n   turn62: D -> y=6 at turn63\n   turn63: U -> y=7 at turn64\n   turn64: U -> y=8 at turn65 -> safe at freeway8? \n        freeway8 at turn65: [ -95 + 48*(65-62)= -95+48*3= -95+144=49, -48+144=96] -> safe.\n   then turn65: U -> y=9 at turn66.\n\nBut that's 4 moves.\n\nBut note: we are at y=7 at turn62. We want to be at y=9 at the end of the last action. The last action is at turn62+H-1.\n\nWe need to see if we can do it in 3 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go up to y=9 in two moves but with a delay? \n\nBut we cannot: because from y=7 to y=9 we need two U's. But we have to avoid the freeway8 at turn63 and freeway7 at turn63.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n   turn62: U -> to y=8 (at turn63) -> unsafe? So we must avoid.\n\n   turn62: S -> unsafe at turn63? So we avoid.\n\n   turn62: D -> safe.\n\nSo we must do D at turn62. Then we are at y=6 at turn63.\n\nAt turn63, we can do U to y=7 at turn64 -> safe.\n\nAt turn64, we can do U to y=8 at turn65 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn65, we do U to y=9 at turn66 -> done. That's 4 moves.\n\nBut wait: at turn65 we are at y=8 and we do U to get to y=9. And at that turn65 we are on freeway8? But we are at (0,8) at turn65, and then we move to (0,9) at turn66. At turn65, we are on freeway8 and we must check freeway8 at turn65: which is safe. Then at turn66, we are at freeway9? But there are no cars on freeway9? The problem says avoid collisions on freeways y=1..8. So when we are at y=9, we don't have to worry about cars.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n   turn62: D\n   turn63: U\n   turn64: U\n   turn65: U\n\nBut note: after the last action at turn65, we are at y=9? \n\nActually:\n   At turn62: start at y=7, do D -> at turn63: y=6.\n   At turn63: do U -> at turn64: y=7.\n   At turn64: do U -> at turn65: y=8.\n   At turn65: do U -> at turn66: y=9.\n\nWe are at (0,9) at turn66. The problem asks for the minimal H such that we reach at turn t1 + H - 1? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end of these H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo the last action is at t1 + (H-1). And after that action, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our case, the last action is at turn65 = t1 + (65-62) = t1+3. So H-1 = 3? Then H=4.\n\nWe have 4 actions: at t62, t63, t64, t65.\n\nBut note: the starting turn is t1=62. We do an action at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3. Then H=4.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=3? Then we would do actions at t62, t63, t64. Then at turn65 we are at (0,9). \n\nThat means we must be at y=9 at the end of the action at turn64? \n\nBut we start at y=7. We can do:\n\n   Option: \n      t62: U -> y=8 at t63 -> unsafe? (collision at freeway8 at t63)\n      t62: D -> y=6 at t63\n      t63: U -> y=7 at t64\n      t64: U -> y=8 at t65 -> but then we are at y=8 at t65, not y=9.\n\nSo we need one more U to get to 9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 4.\n\nBut what about using S at some point? \n\nFor example, at turn62: D -> y=6 at turn63 (safe)\n   turn63: S -> y=6 at turn64? Then we are still at freeway6 at turn64. Check freeway6 at turn64: \n        dt = 64-62 = 2\n        freeway6: [ -83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24] -> does it include 0? Yes, because -11<=0<=24 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn64, if we are at freeway6, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at freeway6 at turn64.\n\nWe must leave freeway6 by turn64.\n\nSo after going to freeway6 at turn63, we must not stay at turn63? We must move at turn63 to either U or D? \n\nBut if we move U at turn63 to freeway7 at turn64, that's safe (as we saw freeway7 at turn64: [1,48] -> safe).\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nSo the sequence we have (D, U, U, U) is safe.\n\nBut let's verify all steps:\n\nTurn62 (t=62): \n   Position: (0,7) -> freeway7: check car at t62: [ -95, -48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n   Action: D -> new y = 7-1=6.\n\nTurn63 (t=63):\n   Position: (0,6) -> freeway6: car at t63: [ -83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> new y = 6+1=7.\n\nTurn64 (t=64):\n   Position: (0,7) -> freeway7: car at t64: [ -95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> new y=8.\n\nTurn65 (t=65):\n   Position: (0,8) -> freeway8: car at t65: [ -95+48*3, -48+48*3] = [-95+144, -48+144] = [49,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> new y=9.\n\nThen we are done.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut note: we have to write the answer for turns starting at t1=62.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=4, so t from 0 to 3: \n   t=0: a_{62} = D\n   t=1: a_{63} = U\n   t=2: a_{64} = U\n   t=3: a_{65} = U\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut wait, we have to check if there is a faster way? What if we go down to y=5? \n\nWe start at y=7, then D to y=6, then D to y=5? Then we have to go up 4 steps? That would be more moves.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway6 at turn64 by moving up at turn63 and then again at turn64? \n\nWe did that: from y=6 at turn63, we did U to y=7 at turn64 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we do U twice from y=6? \n\n   turn63: U -> y=7 at turn64 (safe)\n   turn64: U -> y=8 at turn65 (safe)\n\nThat's what we did.\n\nBut then we need one more to get to 9.\n\nSo we have to do 4 moves.\n\nAnother idea: at turn62, we do D to y=6. Then at turn63, we do U to y=7. Then at turn64, we do U to y=8. Then at turn65, we do U to y=9. That's 4 moves.\n\nIs there a way to get to 9 in 3 moves? We don't see.\n\nBut note: we are at y=7 at turn62. If we could get to y=9 at turn64, that would be two moves? But that requires two U's. But the first U at turn62 would take us to y=8 at turn63, which is unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 4.\n\nWe must also check the other freeways? \n\nIn our sequence we only go through freeways 7, 6, 7, 8. We checked:\n\n   turn62: freeway7 -> safe\n   turn63: freeway6 -> safe\n   turn64: freeway7 -> safe\n   turn65: freeway8 -> safe\n\nBut what about freeway1 to 5? We don't go there? \n\nWe are at y=7, then y=6, then y=7, then y=8, then y=9. So we never are on freeways 1,2,3,4,5. So we don't have to check them.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway6: we checked at turn63: safe. But what if we had stayed at freeway6? We saw at turn64 it becomes unsafe. But we left at turn63 (by moving up at turn63) so we don't stay at freeway6 at turn64.\n\nSo the answer is the above sequence.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn 62 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The analysis shows that a sequence of 4 actions is required to safely reach the target, as fewer actions result in collisions or failure to reach y=9.\n\n### Key Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeway 7 at turn 63**: The car spans [-47, 0], which includes 0 → collision if present.\n- **Freeway 8 at turn 63**: The car spans [-47, 0], which includes 0 → collision if present.\n- **Freeway 6 at turn 64**: The car spans [-11, 24], which includes 0 → collision if present.\n\n### Safe Sequence:\n1. **Turn 62 (start at y=7)**:  \n   - Action: `D` (move down to y=6).  \n   - Collision check: Freeway 7 at turn 62 spans [-95, -48] → 0 not included → safe.\n2. **Turn 63 (y=6)**:  \n   - Action: `U` (move up to y=7).  \n   - Collision check: Freeway 6 at turn 63 spans [-47, -12] → 0 not included → safe.\n3. **Turn 64 (y=7)**:  \n   - Action: `U` (move up to y=8).  \n   - Collision check: Freeway 7 at turn 64 spans [1, 48] → 0 not included → safe.\n4. **Turn 65 (y=8)**:  \n   - Action: `U` (move up to y=9).  \n   - Collision check: Freeway 8 at turn 65 spans [49, 96] → 0 not included → safe.\n\nAfter 4 actions, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 66. No shorter sequence is possible without collisions or failing to reach y=9.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=63, with head, tail, direction, and speed. Since direction is given, for right-moving cars, head is the right end, tail is left; for left-moving, it's the opposite. But in this case, all cars are moving right, according to the table. Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (36,25,right,12) — head 36, tail 25? That seems odd because if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail. 36 and 25, with direction right, so head=36, tail=25, meaning the car spans from x=25 to x=36, and since it's moving right, at future times, it will be at positions like [25 + s*dt, 36 + s*dt].\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail. Here, head=36, tail=25, so min x is tail=25, max x is head=36? The notation says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] where h is head, τ is tail, and since moving right, τ < h.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] → [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: h=36, τ=25, d=right, s=12. So at t1=63, span is [τ, h] = [25,36].\n\nThen at time T, span is [25 + 12*(T-63), 36 + 12*(T-63)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (6, -5, right, 6) so span at t1: [ -5, 6 ]? Tail τ=-5, head h=6, so min x = τ = -5, max x = h =6.\n\nThen at T, [ -5 + 6*(T-63), 6 + 6*(T-63) ]\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 same as 2: all (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (-12,-47,right,36) h=-12, τ=-47, so min x=τ=-47, max x=h=-12? But -47 is less than -12, so min x should be τ if τ < h.\n\nτ=-47, h=-12, since -47 < -12, so span is [τ, h] = [-47, -12]\n\nAt T, [ -47 + 36*(T-63), -12 + 36*(T-63) ]\n\nFreeway 7: (0,-47,right,48) h=0, τ=-47, span [ -47, 0 ] at t1\n\nAt T, [ -47 + 48*(T-63), 0 + 48*(T-63) ]\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway. That is, for freeway k, if y_T = k, and for some car on k, 0 is between the min and max x of its span at time T.\n\nAlso, important: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked based on cars on y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you arrive there at turn T+1, so at turn T, you are still on y_T, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only on y_T at turn T.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=6 to y=9. Since I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, minimum turns is 3, if I go up three times: U,U,U.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions. So at each turn, when I'm on a certain y, I need that at that time, for the car on that y, 0 is not in its span.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=6 at turn t1=63, I need to check for y=6 at time 63.\n\nBut y=6 is a freeway, and there is a car on it? Freeways are y=1 to 8, and player is on y=6 at turn 63.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, what is the car? Freeway k=6 has car: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nBut freeway 6 is for y=6, I think. The freeways are listed as k=1 to 8, corresponding to y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo for y=6, freeway 6 has that car.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway k, if player is on y=k, then check if 0 in span of car on k at time T.\n\nAt turn t1=63, player is on y=6.\n\nCar on freeway 6: span at T=63: since t1=63, dt=0, span is [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [τ, h] = [-47, -12]\n\nSo min x = -47, max x = -12, so 0 is not between -47 and -12? -47 to -12, all negative, so 0 > max x, so 0 not in [-47,-12], so no collision at turn 63. Good.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9. y=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, so no cars there, so once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, but I need to be at (0,9), which is fine.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and since x is always 0 for player, we just care about y.\n\nNow, minimal H: since from 6 to 9, min 3 turns if I can go up each time without collision.\n\nBut I need to check for each step.\n\nLet me denote time starting from t1=63.\n\nAt turn t=63, position y=6.\n\nI need to choose actions for t=63,64,etc., until I reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I do U at t=63: then y_{64} = 6 +1 =7.\n\nBut at turn t=63, I am on y=6, and I perform action, which affects next position.\n\nAction at time t determines Δy for position at t+1.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at time t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at time T if, when I am on y_T, and for the car on freeway y_T, 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSo for each time T, if I am on a freeway y_T between 1 and 8, I need that 0 not in car span on that y at time T.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeways.\n\nIn this case, y=6 to y=9, so y=7 and y=8 are freeways.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when I reach y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the plan: if I go up three times.\n\nStart at t=63, y=6.\n\nAction a_{63}: if I choose U, then y_{64} =7.\n\nAt turn t=63, I am on y=6, need no collision at t=63.\n\nAs before, for y=6, car at t=63: span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=64, I am on y=7, since y_{64}=7.\n\nNow, for y=7 at time t=64.\n\nFreeway 7 has car: (0,-47,right,48) at t1=63.\n\nAt time T=64, dt = T - t1 = 64-63=1\n\nSpan: for right-moving, [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-47 + 48*1, 0 + 48*1] = [-47+48, 48] = [1, 48]\n\nτ = -47, h=0, s=48, dt=1\n\n[τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-47 + 48*1, 0 + 48*1] = [1, 48]\n\nSo span at t=64 is [1,48], min x=1, max x=48, so 0 is not in [1,48], since 0<1, so safe.\n\nThen I am on y=7 at t=64, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\nSuppose I choose U again at t=64: a_{64}=U, then y_{65} =7 +1 =8.\n\nAt t=65, I am on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has car: same as 7, (0,-47,right,48) at t1=63.\n\nAt t=65, dt=65-63=2\n\nSpan: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-47 + 48*2, 0 + 48*2] = [-47+96, 96] = [49, 96]\n\n0 not in [49,96], safe.\n\nThen at t=65, y=8, I need to go to y=9.\n\nChoose U at t=65: a_{65}=U, then y_{66} =8+1=9.\n\nAt t=66, I am on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd I reached (0,9) at turn t=66, which is t1 + 3, since t1=63, t=66 is t1+3.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=63 to t=65, three actions, H=3 turns.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1, so if H=3, actions at t=63,64,65, and position at t=66 is y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, was there any collision? At t=63 on y=6: safe, t=64 on y=7: safe, t=65 on y=8: safe. Then at t=66 on y=9 safe.\n\nBut when I was on y=7 at t=64, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=65, span [49,96], 0 not in.\n\nBut is there a car on y=7? Freeway 7, car at t=64: [1,48], yes.\n\nBut what about other freeways? No, collision only with car on the same freeway at the same time.\n\nSo for each time, only check the freeway I am on.\n\nIn this case, it seems I can reach in 3 turns with U,U,U.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=6 at t=63: freeway 6 car: (-12,-47,right,36) at t=63, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, yes.\n\nBut freeway 6 has speed 36, but at t=63 it's fine.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that when I move, I don't have issue.\n\nIn this sequence, I only visited y=6 at t=63, y=7 at t=64, y=8 at t=65.\n\nI didn't go to other y, so no need to check others.\n\nBut is there a problem? What about freeway 5 or something? But I wasn't on them, so no.\n\nBut let me see if at some point 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on y=7, at t=64, car span [1,48], 0 not covered.\n\nBut what about earlier or later times? Since I'm only there at that time, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=65, [49,96].\n\nBut let me check if at t=63, for y=7.\n\nAt t=63, freeway 7 car: at t1=63, span [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nSo min x= -47, max x=0, so 0 is included? Max x=0, so 0 is in the span, since it's [ -47, 0 ], inclusive.\n\nThe span is [min, max], so if min <= 0 <= max, then 0 is in span.\n\nAt t=63, for y=7, span [ -47, 0 ], min=-47, max=0, so 0 <= max, and 0 >= min, so 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8 at t=63, same car, span [-47,0], 0 included.\n\nBut in my sequence, I was not on y=7 or y=8 at t=63, I was on y=6.\n\nAt t=64, for y=7, span [1,48], min=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=65, [49,96], min=49>0.\n\nNow, but if I were to stay or something, but in this case, I moved up quickly.\n\nBut is there a car on y=6 at other times? For example, if I stayed on y=6.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 1 to 5, but I didn't go there.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 have cars: (6,-5,right,6) at t1=63.\n\nFor example, freeway 2: at t=63, span [τ, h] = [-5,6]\n\nSince τ=-5, h=6, so min=-5, max=6, so 0 is in [-5,6]? -5 <= 0 <=6, yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nAt t=63, for y=2, car span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5 same, since all have same car state.\n\nBut I am not on y=2,3,4,5 at t=63, so no issue.\n\nIn my sequence, I only go through y=6,7,8 at times 63,64,65, all safe.\n\nBut y=8 at t=65 is safe, but what about at t=64 or other times.\n\nFor example, on y=8 at t=64: freeway 8 car at t=64, dt=1, span [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-47 +48*1, 0 +48*1] = [1,48], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=63, [ -47,0], includes 0, but I wasn't there.\n\nSo for my path, it seems fine.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, and I did in three moves.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot? Let me see the car on y=7 and y=8.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 at other times.\n\nBut I was only on y=6 at t=63.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can go faster, but min is 3 turns.\n\nBut maybe due to cars, I need to wait or something, but in this case, no.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both have cars that at t=63 cover x=0, since span [-47,0], includes 0.\n\nBut at t=64, they move to [1,48], so x=0 is free.\n\nSimilarly, at t=65, [49,96], etc.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 or y=8 at t=63, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nI start from y=6 at t=63.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly, but let's see if I go up to y=7 at t=64, which is safe, then to y=8 at t=65, safe, then to y=9.\n\nBut when I go to y=8 at t=65, I am on y=8 at t=65, and car span [49,96], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut what about freeway 6? At t=64, if I were on y=6.\n\nAt t=64, freeway 6 car: at t=63, span [-47,-12], dt=1, s=36, so span [ -47 +36*1, -12 +36*1] = [-11, 24]\n\nMin x= -11, max=24, so -11 <=0<=24, yes 0 is in [-11,24], so at t=64, if I were on y=6, I would collide.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nBut in my sequence, I left y=6 at t=63, so at t=64 I am on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, etc., but not relevant.\n\nSo with U,U,U at t=63,64,65, I reach y=9 at t=66.\n\nBut t=66 is t1 +3, since t1=63.\n\nH=3 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: (36,25,right,12) at t1=63.\n\nSpan at t=63: [25,36], min=25>0, so 0 not in, and since it's moving right, at later times min increases, so never covers x=0, so y=1 is always safe? At t=63, [25,36], all positive, and increasing, so min x=25 +12*dt >0 always, so for y=1, at any time, car span min x >=25 >0, so 0 never covered, so y=1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4,5: at t=63, span [-5,6], includes 0, and with speed 6, moving right.\n\nAt time T, span [ -5 +6*(T-63), 6 +6*(T-63) ]\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -5 +6dt <=0 <=6 +6dt\n\nSince min increases, and max increases.\n\n0 <= max always true since max >=6>0? At t=63, max=6>0, and increasing, so 0 <= max always true.\n\nNow min <=0: -5 +6dt <=0, so 6dt <=5, dt <= 5/6 <1, so only at dt=0, i.e., T=63, min=-5<=0.\n\nAt T=64, dt=1, min= -5+6=1>0, so min=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly for later times.\n\nSo for y=2,3,4,5, at T=63, car covers x=0, but at T>63, min>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for y=6: at t=63, span [-47,-12], min=-47<0, max=-12<0, so 0 not in.\n\nAt t=64, span [-11,24], min=-11<0, max=24>0, so 0 in.\n\nAt t=65, dt=2, span [-47+72, -12+72]= [25,60], min=25>0, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for y=7: at t=63, span [-47,0], min<0, max=0, 0 in.\n\nAt t=64, span [1,48], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nAt t=65, [49,96], min>0.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nSo in summary, for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe, car never at x=0.\n\ny=2,3,4,5: unsafe only at t=63, safe for t>63.\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=64, but safe at t=63 and t=65 onwards? At t=63: safe, as min=-47, max=-12, both <0.\n\nt=64: unsafe, min=-11, max=24, 0 in.\n\nt=65: safe, min=25>0.\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=63 (covered), safe t>=64.\n\ny=8: same as y=7.\n\nNow, back to my plan: start at y=6, t=63: safe.\n\nThen move to y=7 at t=64: at t=64, I am on y=7, which is safe, since at t=64, y=7 safe.\n\nThen move to y=8 at t=65: at t=65, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=66.\n\nAll safe.\n\nCould I go faster? From y=6 to y=9 in fewer than 3 turns? No, because each move changes y by at most 1, so min 3 turns.\n\nI could go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nOr stay, but that increases H.\n\nSo min H=3.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions at t=63,64,65.\n\na_{t1} = a_{63} = U\n\na_{64} = U\n\na_{65} = U\n\nThen at t=66, y=9.\n\nNow, but the player position at turn T is y_T.\n\nIn the output, it should list the actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to the actions needed.\n\nSince H=3, actions at t=63,64,65.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might have issue, but seems not.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I go to y=7 at t=64, but y=7 at t=64 is safe.\n\nBut what if I wanted to go to y=8 directly or something, but I can't, since I can only move one step.\n\nAnother path: suppose I stay at t=63, S, then at t=64, on y=6, but at t=64, y=6 is unsafe, since car covers x=0.\n\nSo if I stay at t=63, a_{63}=S, then y_{64}=6, same y, so at t=64, I am on y=6, and car on y=6 at t=64 has span [-11,24], which includes 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot stay; I must move up or down at t=63.\n\nIf I move down, to y=5, but y=5 at t=64: let's see.\n\nIf a_{63}=D, then y_{64}=6-1=5.\n\nAt t=64, on y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway, car at t=64: freeway 5 has same car as 2,3,4,5? Freeway 5: (6,-5,right,6) at t1=63.\n\nAt t=64, dt=1, span [ -5 +6*1, 6 +6*1] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9, which takes more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, it takes longer.\n\nSo best is to go up directly.\n\nThus, sequence should be U,U,U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=65, I go to y=8, and at t=65, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 that might be a problem? No.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for H=3.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 6 car: it has high speed, but in this case, fine.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 6 at t=64 covers x=0, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H=3, actions: U at t=63, U at t=64, U at t=65.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt says: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nSo for t1=63,\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut since H=3, three actions.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn the action sequence, t=63 to 65, that's three turns.\n\nPosition after action at t=65 is y=9 at t=66.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it out.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nNow, but let me make sure about the car on y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt t=63, if I were on y=7, unsafe, but I am not.\n\nIn the movement, since I move at t=63 to go to y=7 at t=64.\n\nAt t=64, on y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in 2 turns? But from y=6 to y=9, I need to increase y by 3, each action changes by at most 1, so impossible in 2 turns. Min 3 turns.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 3,4,5 are same, but not used.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=64 unsafe, but avoided.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably with the braces.\n\nIn the text, it might be written as Turn 63: a_{63} but in output, it should be the action.\n\nIn the answer format example, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning to replace with the values.\n\nSo for this, Turn 63: U\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U }\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in the car on freeway 7 and 8, at t=63, span includes 0, but since I move up, I am on y=7 only at t=64, when it's safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can go to y=9 faster, but no.\n\nOr if I go to y=8 first or something, but same.\n\nSo I believe this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 63\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate from 6 to 9, requiring a minimum of 3 turns, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at time \\(T\\).\n- The car spans at relevant times for freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are:\n  - **Freeway 6** (at \\(y = 6\\)): Car state at \\(t_1 = 63\\) is \\((-12, -47, \\text{right}, 36)\\).\n    - At \\(T = 63\\): Span \\([-47, -12]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-47, -12]\\) (safe).\n    - At \\(T = 64\\): Span \\([-47 + 36(1), -12 + 36(1)] = [-11, 24]\\), \\(0 \\in [-11, 24]\\) (unsafe).\n    - At \\(T = 65\\): Span \\([-47 + 36(2), -12 + 36(2)] = [25, 60]\\), \\(0 \\notin [25, 60]\\) (safe).\n  - **Freeway 7** (at \\(y = 7\\)): Car state at \\(t_1 = 63\\) is \\((0, -47, \\text{right}, 48)\\).\n    - At \\(T = 63\\): Span \\([-47, 0]\\), \\(0 \\in [-47, 0]\\) (unsafe).\n    - At \\(T = 64\\): Span \\([-47 + 48(1), 0 + 48(1)] = [1, 48]\\), \\(0 \\notin [1, 48]\\) (safe).\n    - At \\(T = 65\\): Span \\([-47 + 48(2), 0 + 48(2)] = [49, 96]\\), \\(0 \\notin [49, 96]\\) (safe).\n  - **Freeway 8** (at \\(y = 8\\)): Car state at \\(t_1 = 63\\) is \\((0, -47, \\text{right}, 48)\\) (same as freeway 7).\n    - At \\(T = 63\\): Span \\([-47, 0]\\), \\(0 \\in [-47, 0]\\) (unsafe).\n    - At \\(T = 64\\): Span \\([1, 48]\\), \\(0 \\notin [1, 48]\\) (safe).\n    - At \\(T = 65\\): Span \\([49, 96]\\), \\(0 \\notin [49, 96]\\) (safe).\n\n### Sequence to Reach (0, 9) in \\(H = 3\\) Turns:\n- **Turn 63**: Player is at \\(y = 6\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 64. The player starts at (0,7). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. When we take an action at turn t, we are moving from y_t to y_{t+1}. At turn t, the player is at y_t and we check for collision on freeway y_t at that turn. If we move to y_{t+1} at turn t, then at turn t we are still on y_t and at turn t+1 we are on y_{t+1}.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=64. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) we have a car described by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for the car is linear in time.\n\nWe need to compute the position of each car at any future turn T (>=64). \n\nLet Δt = T - 64.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T, we are concerned only when the player is on that freeway at turn T. Since the player moves vertically, we must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at that exact turn.\n\nCar update:\n\n- If direction is 'right', then at turn T: \n   head_T = head_0 + s * Δt\n   tail_T = tail_0 + s * Δt\n   and the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since tail_0 <= head_0 for right? Actually, the problem says for right: initial span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]. Note: in the table, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> that must be a typo? Because for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail. But here head=48, tail=37? Then 48>37, so that's okay. The span at t1=64 is [37,48]? But the problem says for right: initial span is [τ, h] meaning [tail, head]. So for freeway1: tail=37, head=48? But the table says (48,37,...). Let me read the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". So for freeway1: head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the tail is behind. So the car covers [tail, head] = [37,48]. Then at time T, the car will be at [37 + 12*(T-64), 48 + 12*(T-64)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have head and tail such that head>tail? Actually, the problem says for left: initial span [h, τ] (which is [head, tail]) becomes [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]. So the head is the front? Then for a left-moving car, the head is at a higher x than the tail? But then the car moves left, so the head decreases.\n\nIn our case, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at t=64, then moves to [37+12*Δt, 48+12*Δt]\nFreeway 2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12] at t=64, then [1+6*Δt, 12+6*Δt]\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (12,1,right,6)\nFreeway 4: same\nFreeway 5: same\nFreeway 6: (24,-11,right,36) -> [-11,24] at t=64, then [-11+36*Δt, 24+36*Δt]\nFreeway 7: (48,1,right,48) -> [1,48] at t=64, then [1+48*Δt, 48+48*Δt]\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (48,1,right,48)\n\nBut note: freeways 2,3,4,5 are identical? and 7 and 8 are identical? and 6 is different.\n\nWe are starting at (0,7) at turn 64. Our goal is to get to (0,9). We can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T if the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0. That is, if the car's span at turn T covers 0, then if the player is on that freeway at that turn, collision.\n\nNote: The player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. So at turn t, we are on freeway y_t. But if y_t is 0 or 9, there are no cars, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe start at y=7 (which is freeway 7) at turn 64. We must check the car on freeway7 at turn64: [1,48] at turn64? So the car on freeway7 at turn64 is [1,48]. Does 0 fall in [1,48]? No, because 0<1. So we are safe at turn64.\n\nBut note: the car update is continuous? Actually, the problem says \"the car span becomes\" at turn T. So at each integer turn T, we have a span. And we only check at integer turns.\n\nSo we are safe at turn64 on freeway7.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves? Without any cars, we could go: from 7 to 8 to 9: two moves (U at turn64 and U at turn65). But we have to avoid cars on freeways 8 and possibly others if we go through them.\n\nBut note: at turn64 we are at y=7. We are going to take an action at turn64 that will determine y65. Then at turn65 we are at y65, and so on.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At turn T, if we are on a freeway k (1<=k<=8), then we require that the car on freeway k at turn T does not have a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are at turn64: y64=7, and we are safe (as above).\n\nNow, we consider actions:\n\nWe can go up to 8, down to 6, or stay at 7.\n\nBut if we go up to 8 at turn64, then at turn65 we will be at y65=8. Then we must check freeway8 at turn65.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to 6, then at turn65 we are at freeway6.\n\nOr if we stay, we remain at freeway7 for turn65.\n\nWe must compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nLet Δt = T - 64.\n\nFor freeway1: [37 + 12*(T-64), 48 + 12*(T-64)] -> we only care when the player is on freeway1? But we start at 7 and are going to 9, so we might not go to freeway1? So we can ignore freeways below 6? Actually, we start at 7, and we can only move to 6,7,8. We need to get to 9, so we must go through 8 and then 9. So we will be on freeways 6,7,8 and possibly 5 if we go down? But that would be inefficient. Minimal path: 7->8->9: that's two moves. But we have to check freeway8 at the turn we are on it.\n\nSo let's check freeway8 at turn65 and turn66? We are going to consider the two-move plan: U at turn64 and U at turn65.\n\nAt turn64: we are at y=7 -> safe (as above).\n\nAt turn64, we take action U -> then at turn65 we are at y=8.\n\nAt turn65: we must check freeway8.\n\nFreeway8 at turn65 (T=65, Δt=1): \n   tail = 1 + 48*1 = 49\n   head = 48 + 48*1 = 96? \n   Actually, the car on freeway8: initial at turn64: tail=1, head=48? Then at turn65: [1+48*1, 48+48*1] = [49,96]. \n   Does 0 fall in [49,96]? No. So safe.\n\nThen at turn65 we take U -> then at turn66 we are at y=9 -> goal. And at turn66 we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n\nThen at turn66 we are at (0,9). So H=2? But wait, the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1? We start at turn64, and we take two actions: at turn64 and turn65. Then at turn66 we are at 9. So H=2.\n\nBut is that safe? We were at:\n- Turn64: y64=7 -> safe (car7 at turn64: [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48])\n- Turn65: y65=8 -> car8 at turn65: [49,96] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway7 at turn65? We are not on freeway7 at turn65, so we don't care. Similarly, freeway8 at turn64: we were not on freeway8 at turn64, so we don't care.\n\nSo that seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car update for freeway8 at turn65: \n   initial at turn64: [1,48] (tail=1, head=48) for a right-moving car. Then after 1 turn: \n   tail = 1 + 48*1 = 49\n   head = 48 + 48*1 = 96\n   so [49,96]. Correct.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway7? We are at freeway7 at turn64. Then we move to freeway8 at turn65. But at turn65, we are at freeway8, so we check freeway8 at turn65. We don't check freeway7 at turn65 because we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn64 we were at freeway7, so we checked freeway7 at turn64.\n\nSo the two-move plan works.\n\nBut why would we need more? The problem says \"minimal number of turns\". So 2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger? What if we had to avoid a car? Then we might need to wait. But in this case, it seems safe.\n\nBut wait, the car on freeway6: (24,-11,right,36) at turn64: span [-11,24]. Then at turn65: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> doesn't cover 0. But we are not going to freeway6 in the two-move plan.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: (12,1,right,6) at turn64: [1,12]; at turn65: [7,18] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nBut we don't go to freeway5 or 6.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go up at turn64 and then at turn65 we are at 8, and then we can go up again at turn65 to 9 at turn66. That's the plan.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we did avoid.\n\nBut let me check the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". That means at turn T, we are still on y_T. So when we move from 7 to 8 at turn64, at turn64 we are at 7, and then at turn65 we are at 8. So at turn64 we are only on freeway7, and at turn65 we are only on freeway8.\n\nTherefore, the two-move plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we had to consider if the car on freeway7 at turn65? We don't, because we are not at freeway7 at turn65.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. H is the number of turns? We take two actions: at turn64 and turn65, and then at turn66 we are at 9. So H=2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n}\n\nBut let me verify the car on freeway8 at turn65 again. The car on freeway8 at turn64 is [1,48]. Then at turn65, it moves to [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96]. So 0 is not in there. Correct.\n\nWhat about freeway7 at turn64: [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48]. Correct.\n\nBut wait, the car on freeway7 and freeway8 are the same? No, freeway7 and freeway8 are separate. The car on freeway7: (48,1,right,48) -> at turn64: [1,48]. Similarly for freeway8: same car? But they are on different freeways. So freeway7 has a car that at turn64 is [1,48], and freeway8 has a car that at turn64 is [1,48] (from the table). But they are independent.\n\nSo at turn64, freeway7: [1,48] -> safe (0 not in [1,48])\nAt turn64, freeway8: [1,48] -> but we are not on freeway8 at turn64, so we don't care.\n\nAt turn65, freeway8: [49,96] -> safe.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway7 for turn65? Then we would need to check freeway7 at turn65: [1+48*1, 48+48*1] = [49,96] -> safe too. But we are going to freeway8.\n\nSo the two-move plan is safe.\n\nBut is there a reason to take a longer path? Probably not, since we want minimal turns.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in one move? From 7 to 9? The moves are only ±1 or 0. So we cannot jump. So minimal is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t1=64, so t=0 corresponds to turn64, t=1 to turn65. So two actions.\n\nBut let me write it in the required format.\n\nBut wait, what about the other freeways? For example, if we had gone down to 6 at turn64, then at turn65 we would be at 6, and then we have to go up to 7, then to 8, then to 9, which takes more moves. So that would be worse.\n\nOr if we stayed at 7 at turn64, then at turn65 we are at 7, then we can go to 8 at turn66, then to 9 at turn67: that would be 3 moves.\n\nSo 2 is minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if at turn64 and turn65, any car on the freeways we are on is dangerous? We did: freeway7 at turn64: safe, freeway8 at turn65: safe.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at turn65? We are not on freeway7 at turn65, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, what about freeway6? We are not on it.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So we only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at turn64: even though we are not on it, just to see: [1,48] at turn64, which does not include 0. But if we were to be on freeway8 at turn64, it would be safe too? But we are not.\n\nSo the answer is two moves: U at 64 and U at 65.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we are at (0,9) at turn66, which is after two moves.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n}\n\nBut note: the turn labels are as given: Turn 64, Turn 65.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. Here t1=64.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n\nBut wait, what if the car on freeway8 at turn65 was covering 0? Then we would have to avoid. But it doesn't.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway6: (24,-11,right,36) at turn64: span [-11,24]. Then at turn65: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> safe. At turn66: [-11+72, 24+72] = [61,96] -> safe. But we don't go there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: at turn64: [1,12]; turn65: [7,18]; turn66: [13,24] -> all safe? But again, we don't go to freeway5.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? For example, if we were at freeway8 at a turn when the car covers 0, then we would have to avoid. But in this case, we don't have that.\n\nBut let me check when the car on freeway8 covers 0? The car on freeway8: [1+48*Δt, 48+48*Δt]. We require 0 in [1+48*Δt, 48+48*Δt]. \n\nSolve: 1+48*Δt <= 0 <= 48+48*Δt? \n\nFirst, 0 <= 48+48*Δt -> always true for Δt>=0? But 1+48*Δt <=0? Then 48*Δt <= -1 -> impossible for Δt>=0. So the car on freeway8 never covers 0 at any future turn? Because the tail at turn64 is 1, and it moves right at 48 per turn. So the tail is always at least 1 and increasing. Therefore, we are always safe on freeway8? Then why would we ever have to avoid it? \n\nSimilarly, for freeway7: same car? [1+48*Δt, 48+48*Δt] -> the tail is 1 at turn64, and increases. So 0 is never in the span.\n\nBut what about freeway6? The car is [ -11 + 36*Δt, 24 + 36*Δt]. When does it cover 0?\n\nWe need: -11 + 36*Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 36*Δt.\n\nThe second inequality is always true for Δt>=0. The first: -11 + 36*Δt <=0 -> 36*Δt <=11 -> Δt <= 11/36 < 1. So only at Δt=0? But at Δt=0 (turn64): -11 <=0<=24 -> true. So at turn64, freeway6 has a car that covers 0? \n\nAt turn64: freeway6 car: head=24, tail=-11? So the span is [-11,24]. Yes, 0 is in [-11,24]. So if we are on freeway6 at turn64, we would collide.\n\nBut we start at freeway7, not freeway6. So we are safe.\n\nIf we go to freeway6 at turn65: then we check freeway6 at turn65: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> 0 not in there. So safe.\n\nBut we don't need to go to freeway6.\n\nSimilarly, what about freeway5? The car is [1,12] at turn64. Then at turn65: [7,18]; turn66: [13,24]; etc. Does it ever cover 0? 1+6*Δt <=0? -> 6*Δt <=-1 -> impossible. So always safe? But at turn64: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]. So safe.\n\nBut freeway2,3,4,5 are all the same: [1,12] at turn64, then increasing. So they never cover 0? Because the tail is 1 at turn64 and moves right.\n\nFreeway1: [37,48] at turn64, then increasing -> never covers 0.\n\nSo the only freeway that has a car covering 0 at turn64 is freeway6. But we are not on it.\n\nTherefore, the minimal path is 7->8->9 in two moves.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n}\n\nBut to be complete, let me check if we can do it in two moves by going down? No, because going down from 7 to 6 then we have to go up again, which would take at least 3 moves: 7->6->7->8->9? That's 4 moves. So no.\n\nOr 7->6->7->8->9: 4 moves. Or 7->6->5->... no, that's worse.\n\nSo minimal is 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 64\\) is 2. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- At turn 64, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\).\n- At turn 65, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) because:\n- At turn 64, the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). The car on freeway 7 at turn 64 has span \\([1, 48]\\), which does not include 0 (safe).\n- At turn 65, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 at turn 65 has span \\([49, 96]\\) (calculated as \\([1 + 48 \\times 1, 48 + 48 \\times 1]\\)), which does not include 0 (safe).\n\nNo other sequence achieves the goal in fewer turns, as moving directly from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in one move is not allowed (only \\(\\Delta y = \\pm 1\\) or 0 per turn).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) on turn t_1 = 65. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=8 and want to go to y=9, moving up makes sense, but we have to avoid cars.\n\nThe key point is that collision only happens if the player is on a freeway at the same turn that a car occupies position x=0 on that freeway. Also, when moving, the player isn't on the new row until the next turn; so if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=65, and they move left or right with constant speed.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each future turn, whether there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T0 = 65.\n\nFor each car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time t is [τ + s*(t - T0), h + s*(t - T0)]\n\nSince it's moving right, the head is at h at T0, so at time t, it's shifted by s*(t - T0) to the right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars are right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet me list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12)\n\nFreeway 2: (h=18, τ=7, d=right, s=6)\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: same (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (h=60, τ=25, d=right, s=36)\n\nFreeway 7: (h=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (96,49,right,48)\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 all have identical cars: (18,7,right,6)\n\nAnd 7 and 8 are identical: (96,49,right,48)\n\nFreeway 1 is (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6 is (60,25,right,36)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car at time t.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time t, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span [τ + s*(t - T0), h + s*(t - T0)] for right-moving.\n\nSince all cars on a freeway might be different, but in this case, for freeways 2-5, there are multiple cars but all same parameters? No, the table says \"Cars\" for each freeway, but it lists one tuple, so I think each freeway has one car with those parameters. But for freeway 2, it has one car (18,7,right,6), similarly for others. Freeway 1 has one, etc.\n\nThe heading is \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" and it lists one for each, so I think each freeway has exactly one car.\n\nFor freeway 2,3,4,5, each has a car with (18,7,right,6), so they are identical but on different rows.\n\nSimilarly, 7 and 8 have identical cars.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn t, for freeway y_t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, and if on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at time t.\n\nThe player is on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nTo reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so when the player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, and y=9 is the top, I think safe.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so once we reach y=9, we're safe.\n\nCurrently at y=8.\n\nSince we start at y=8, and want to go to y=9, we need to move up.\n\nBut at y=8, there might be a car that collides at some turns.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nThe minimal H: since we're at y=8, one move up should get us to y=9, but only if we can do it without colliding.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t_1.\n\nAt t=0 (which is turn t_1), position is (0,8)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t=1 (t_1+1), position y_{t_1+1} = y_8 + Δy, depending on action.\n\nThen after H turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe player update: after action at t, position changes to t+1.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet T_abs as absolute turn.\n\nAt T_abs = t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,8)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at T_abs = t_1 +1, position y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I think, because at turn t_1 + H, if y=9, no collision possible.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nThe player is at position at turn T, and collision is if at that turn, on freeway y_T, car covers 0.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, if y=9, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1, position (0,8), which is on freeway 8, so collision possible if car on row 8 covers x=0 at turn t_1.\n\nIn general, for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when the player is on a freeway row (1-8), we need to ensure no car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, if on row 9, no issue.\n\nThe minimal H: since we start at y=8, and want to be at y=9, the quickest is to move up immediately, so H=1, meaning one action: at turn t_1, do U, then at turn t_1+1, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if at turn t_1, when we are at y=8, whether there is a collision.\n\nIf not, we can do that.\n\nIf there is, we might need to stay or move down temporarily to avoid.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nFirst, check for row 8 at time t_1=65.\n\nFreeway 8 has a car: (h=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48)\n\nAt time t, the span is [τ + s(t - 65), h + s(t - 65)] = [49 + 48(t-65), 96 + 48(t-65)] for right-moving.\n\nAt t=65, span = [49 + 48(0), 96 + 48(0)] = [49,96], since t-65=0.\n\nx=0 is not in [49,96], so at t=65, no collision on row 8.\n\nWe are at row 8 at turn 65, and x=0 not covered, so safe.\n\nThen, we can do action U at turn 65, moving to y=9 at turn 66.\n\nAt turn 66, position is (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached the goal.\n\nH=1, since one action at turn t_1.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nAction at turn t_1: U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position (0,9)\n\nAnd H=1, meaning one action.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=1, only one action at t_1.\n\nAnd position at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the player update: after actions from t=0 to H-1, position at turn t_1 + H -1 is (0,9)\n\nSet t relative to t_1.\n\nAt time t (relative), turn t_1 + t.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + t is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t}, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at t=0, position y_0 = 8\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=H, position y_H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 is the time after H-1 actions? Let's index carefully.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At turn t_1 (absolute), position: y^{(0)} = 8\n\n- Action a_{t_1} is applied, then at turn t_1 +1, position y^{(1)} = y^{(0)} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n- Similarly, action a_{t_1 + k} for k=0 to H-1, applied, then at turn t_1 + H, position y^{(H)} = y^{(H-1)} + Δy_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWe want y^{(H)} = 9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be (0,9).\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 is the time after (H-1) actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0, position y^{(t)}\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + t, position at turn t_1 + t +1 is y^{(t+1)}\n\nThe turn when position is set is t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nWe want at some turn T, position is (0,9), and T = t_1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nSince we start at t_1, the turn index for position is t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, etc.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + K to be (0,9) for some K.\n\nThen H is the number of actions to achieve that.\n\nFrom the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and position at t_1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions? Let's think.\n\nSuppose H=1: one action at turn t_1.\n\nThen position at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so at turn t_1, position should be (0,9), but at turn t_1, we are at (0,8), so not yet.\n\nAfter action at t_1, position at t_1+1 is set.\n\nSo for H=1: action at t_1, then position at t_1+1 is y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nWe want this to be 9, so Δy_{t_1} = +1, U.\n\nThen position at turn t_1+1 is (0,9).\n\nBut the turn when we reach (0,9) is t_1+1, which is t_1 + H -1? For H=1, t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, but at t_1 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think there's a confusion in indexing.\n\nRead the problem carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" with t absolute.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is position.\n\nAction a_T is taken, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for T = t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1? Let's see the turn when position is set.\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1 is set.\n\nSo after actions from T=t_1 to t_1+H-1, the last position set is at turn (t_1+H-1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or misindexing.\n\nLook: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nBut from the action sequence, with H actions, we reach position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, with no action, position at t_1 is (0,8), not 9.\n\nWith one action at t_1, position at t_1+1 is set to 9 if U.\n\nSo turn reached is t_1+1.\n\nBut t_1 + H -1 for H=1 is t_1, which is wrong.\n\nI think it should be reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says t_1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps the actions include the starting turn.\n\nAnother way: the sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, so turns t_1+0 to t_1+H-1.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + t for t=0 is initial.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + t, position at t_1 + t +1.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + t for some t to be 9, and t = H-1? Let's see.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H -1, that is the time when position is set, before any action at that turn.\n\nFor that to be 9, it must be that the actions before have brought it to 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, position at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1 should be 9, but at t_1 it is 8, so impossible for H=1.\n\nIf H=2, position at turn t_1 +2-1 = t_1+1 should be 9.\n\nSo with actions at t_1 and t_1+1, position at t_1+1 is 9.\n\nAction at t_1: a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nThen action at t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, then y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Δy_{t_1+1}\n\nWe want y_{t_1+1} = 9.\n\nFor that, we need to set y_{t_1+1} = 8 + Δy_{t_1} = 9, so Δy_{t_1} = +1, U.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, position is 9, and we don't care about later actions, but the sequence has H actions, so for H=1, it would be only one action, but with one action, we can set y_{t_1+1} =9, but the position at t_1+H-1 for H=1 is t_1, not t_1+1.\n\nSo for H=1, position at t_1+1-1=t_1 is 8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at t_1+1 be 9, we need H=2, with actions at t_1 and t_1+1, but the action at t_1+1 doesn't affect y_{t_1+1}, it affects y_{t_1+2}.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\" means the turn after H-1 actions or something.\n\nLet's look back at the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd in the player update, \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at turn T, y_T is position, action a_T is taken, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe sequence is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so actions from T= t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H is set.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat means for turn t_1 + H -1, which is before the last action.\n\nFor example, with H=1: sequence a_{t_1} for t=0 to 0, one action at t_1.\n\nThen position at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1 should be 9, but it is 8, so impossible.\n\nWith H=2: actions at t_1 and t_1+1.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 +2 -1 = t_1+1 should be 9.\n\nNow, position at t_1+1 is set by action at t_1: y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nTo have y_{t_1+1} =9, we need Δy_{t_1} = +1, U.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, position is 9.\n\nThen we also have action at t_1+1, which will affect y_{t_1+2}, but since we only care about reaching at t_1+1, it doesn't matter what a_{t_1+1} is, as long as we reach at that turn.\n\nBut the sequence must be specified, so we can choose a_{t_1+1} arbitrarily, say S or something.\n\nBut for minimal H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nFrom y=8, we can reach y=9 at turn t_1+1 by doing U at t_1.\n\nThen for that, we need H such that t_1 + H -1 = t_1+1, so H-1 =1, H=2.\n\nThen actions: at t_1: U, and at t_1+1: some action, say S, but since we already reached at turn t_1+1, it doesn't matter.\n\nThe position at turn t_1+1 is 9, which is the goal.\n\nSimilarly, if we do nothing, we stay at 8, not 9.\n\nSo for this case, H=2, with actions: a_{t_1} = U, and a_{t_1+1} = say S.\n\nBut we only need to reach, so a_{t_1+1} can be anything, but to minimize turns, we can set it to S or U, but y=9 is max, so S or D, but D would go down to 8, but at turn t_1+1 position is 9, then if we do D at t_1+1, y_{t_1+2} =8, but we don't care, since we reached at t_1+1.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, so for H=2, at turn t_1+1, we are at 9, good.\n\nAnd collision should be avoided at all turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which for H=2, turns t_1 and t_1+1.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y=8, on freeway 8.\n\nAt turn t_1+1, position y=9, not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nSo only need to check at turn t_1 for row 8.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, at t=65, for row 8, car span [49,96], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThus, we can do U at t_1, reach y=9 at t_1+1.\n\nFor H=2, position at t_1+1 is 9.\n\nIn general, to reach at turn T, H = (T - t_1) +1.\n\nSince at turn T, position set, and T = t_1 + K for some K, then H = K +1.\n\nFor example, reach at turn t_1+1, K=1, H=2.\n\nReach at turn t_1, K=0, H=1, but at t_1 it is 8, not 9, impossible.\n\nSo minimal K is 1, H=2.\n\nBut in this case, since we can reach at t_1+1, and it's safe.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn t_1, on row 8, is it safe? Yes.\n\nBut we need to make sure that during the move, no issue.\n\nWhen we do U at t_1, at turn t_1 we are on y=8, then after action, at turn t_1+1 on y=9.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are on row 8, check collision: no, as above.\n\nAt turn t_1+1, on row 9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,8), and we want to go to (0,9), so moving up is direct.\n\nBut perhaps on other rows there are cars, but since we are only on row 8 at turn t_1, and then row 9, no other rows involved.\n\nSo for this case, it seems we can do it in H=2 with a_{t_1} = U.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1.\n\na_{t_1} = U\n\na_{t_1+1} can be S, for example.\n\nThen position at turn t_1+1 is 9.\n\nAnd we reached at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +2-1 = t_1+1, correct.\n\nNow, but in the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nBut a_{t_1+1} is not necessary, but we have to include it since H=2 requires two actions.\n\nTo minimize H, H=2 is minimal possible since we start at 8, need to move to 9, which takes at least one action, so minimal H=2.\n\nWith H=1, impossible as above.\n\nSo for this case, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's check if there is any car that could cause issue at t_1 for row 8.\n\nFreeway 8: car at t=65: [49 + 48*0, 96 + 48*0] = [49,96], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but we don't care since we are only on row 8 at that turn.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if we need to consider other actions.\n\nSuppose we do S at t_1, then stay at 8, then later move up.\n\nBut that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, moving down would be worse.\n\nSo minimal is to move up immediately.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we can do it at turn t_1+1.\n\nBut in the car state, there might be cars on other rows that could affect if we delay, but since we can go directly, no need.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, at future turns, but we are only at row 8 at turn t_1, not later.\n\nIn this path, we are only on row 8 at turn t_1 and row 9 at t_1+1.\n\nNo other times.\n\nSo only need to check turn t_1 for row 8.\n\nWhich is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=65, span [49,96], all positive, so x=0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, for completeness, other freeways, but not relevant.\n\nBut in the list, freeway 8 has (96,49,right,48), head 96, tail 49, so at t=65, from 49 to 96, yes.\n\nNow, but the player is at x=0, so if 0 in span.\n\nNot.\n\nSo collision only if 0 in the span at that turn.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\nH=2\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1+1: S (or anything)\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify.\n\nBut to be precise, let's see if at turn t_1+1, if we are at y=9, no issue.\n\nAction at t_1+1 can be S, U, or D, but since y=9, if U, y=10 invalid, so must be S or D.\n\nBut if D, y goes to 8, but position at turn t_1+1 is 9, which is the goal, so it doesn't affect reaching at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, which for H=2 is t_1+1.\n\nAt that turn, we are there, good.\n\nSubsequent actions don't change that.\n\nFor minimal H, we can choose a_{t_1+1} = S, for example.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"a sequence\".\n\nIn this case, H=2.\n\nBut let's see if H can be less, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can reach at turn t_1, but at t_1 it is 8, not 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, for this specific state, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's look at the car states; there might be a reason why we cannot move up immediately.\n\nFor example, if at turn t_1, on row 8, there was a car covering x=0, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps for row 9, but row 9 has no cars.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, but in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the cars are moving, and at turn t_1, it's safe, but let's see for row 8 at other times, but we are not there.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let's verify the car on row 8.\n\nFreeway 8: h=96, τ=49, s=48, right-moving.\n\nAt time t, span: [49 + 48(t-65), 96 + 48(t-65)]\n\nFor t=65: [49,96]\n\nt=66: [49+48,96+48] = [97,144]\n\nt=67: [49+96,96+96]? 48*2=96, [49+96,96+96] = [145,192], all large, so x=0 never covered for t>=65.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but not needed.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 8, but row 7 is different.\n\nBut we don't care.\n\nNow, just to be curious, row 6: freeway 6: (h=60, τ=25, d=right, s=36)\n\nAt t=65: [25 + 36(0), 60 + 36(0)] = [25,60]\n\n0 not in.\n\nAt other times: [25 + 36(t-65), 60 + 36(t-65)]\n\nFor t<65, it could be negative, but t>=65, all positive and increasing, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, row 5: freeway 5 has car (18,7,right,6)\n\nAt t=65: [7 +6(0), 18+6(0)] = [7,18]\n\n0 not in.\n\nAt t=66: [13,24], etc., never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for rows 2,3,4.\n\nRow 1: (60,49,right,12) at t=65: [49,60], not 0.\n\nSo all rows are safe at t=65 for x=0.\n\nBut we are only concerned when the player is on that row.\n\nIn this case, since we can go directly, it should be ok.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, and we move to y=9.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother point: the collision definition says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, when moving from y=8 to y=9 at turn T, at turn T you are on y=8, so only check row 8 at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y=9, no check.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S (for example)\n\nIn the answer, we need to write the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=65.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: S\n\nBut since we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =65 +2 -1=66, position (0,9)\n\nYes.\n\nTo make H smaller, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 65, but cannot, since we start at 8.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut the problem might be trickier because of the cars.\n\nFor example, suppose we couldn't move up immediately, then we might need to wait or move down.\n\nBut in this case, no.\n\nLet's see if at turn t_1, row 8 is safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps for row 9, but no cars.\n\nAnother thought: the goal is (0,9), which is not a freeway, so once there, safe.\n\nAnd we can get there in one move.\n\nBut with H=2 as above.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 1, but impossible.\n\nSo for this, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see the car on row 8: it is moving right, fast, so x=0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I should compute for row 8 at t=65: 0 not in [49,96], yes.\n\nSo I think we can proceed.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: S\n}\n\nIn the answer format, it should be in terms of t_1, but since t_1 given, we can use numbers.\n\nThe problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSince t_1=65, we can write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: S\n}\n\nBut action at turn 66 is not necessary, but we have to include since H=2.\n\nWe could do U again, but y=9, if U, y=10 invalid, so must not U, so S or D.\n\nS is fine.\n\nTo be safe, S.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 +1, a_{t_1+1} = S.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) on turn \\(t_1 = 65\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The goal position (0, 9) is not a freeway, so no collision checks occur there.\n- At turn 65, the player is on freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)).\n- For freeway 8, the car state is \\((h = 96, \\tau = 49, d = \\text{right}, s = 48)\\).\n- At turn 65, the car span is \\([ \\tau + s \\cdot (65 - 65), h + s \\cdot (65 - 65) ] = [49 + 0, 96 + 0] = [49, 96]\\).\n- Since \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([49, 96]\\), no collision occurs at turn 65 on freeway 8.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 8\\), the player must move up (U) at some turn.\n- The minimal way is to move up immediately at turn 65:\n  - Action at turn 65: \\(a_{65} = U\\), so \\(y_{66} = y_{65} + \\Delta y_{65} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n- At turn 66, position is (0, 9), which is the goal.\n- Collision is checked at turn 65 (on freeway 8, safe as above) and turn 66 (not a freeway, no collision).\n- The sequence requires \\(H = 2\\) turns to reach (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 65 + 2 - 1 = 66\\).\n- The action at turn 66 does not affect the position at turn 66 (since \\(y_{66}\\) is already 9), so it can be stay (S) for simplicity.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- \\(H = 2\\)\n- Actions:\n  - Turn 65: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 66)\n  - Turn 66: S (stay, no effect on position)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: S\n}",
