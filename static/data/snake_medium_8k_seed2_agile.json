So possible: U, D, L.\n   - U: (4,7) → y=7 is a wall → invalid.\n   - D: (4,5) → check if valid.\n   - L: (3,6) → check if valid.\n\n### Checking Moves:\n1. **Move D to (4,5)**:\n   - (4,5) is not a wall, not an obstacle, and not occupied by the snake's body (current body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Move L to (3,6)**:\n   - (3,6) is not a wall, not an obstacle, and not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **(1,5)**: Life span 2 at turn 12 → disappears after turn 13. Cannot reach it in time (as reasoned in the thinking model).\n- **(2,6)**: Life span 5 at turn 12 → can be eaten within 5 turns. From (4,6), moving L to (3,6) brings us closer to (2,6).\n- **(6,1)**: Far away, not urgent.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving L to (3,6) is better because:\n   - It brings the snake closer to the food at (2,6), which can be eaten in the next move (from (3,6), move L to (2,6)).\n   - Moving D to (4,5) doesn't provide a clear path to food and may lead to dead ends due to obstacles.\n\n### Tail Danger Check:\n- Tail is at (5,5). Moving to (4,5) doesn't involve the tail, and no food is on the tail cell, so no danger.\n- However, moving L to (3,6) is still better for accessing (2,6).\n\n### Final Choice:\n\\boxed{L}",

Moving into the tail is safe unless there's food (Tail Reward Danger). Here, no food is present, so it's safe.\n- **Down (D)**: \\( (4,4) \\)\n  - Free (no walls, obstacles, or body segments).\n- **Right (R)**: \\( (5,5) \\)\n  - Free (no walls, obstacles, or body segments).\n- **Left (L)**: \\( (3,5) \\)\n  - Occupied by a body segment (not the tail), so this is a deadly collision.\n\nThus, valid moves are U, D, or R.\n\n### Assessing Each Move\n1. **Up (U) to \\( (4,6) \\)**:\n   - Moves towards the top border, away from the food at \\( (4,2) \\) and \\( (3,2) \\).\n   - Not optimal for reaching food quickly.\n\n2. **Down (D) to \\( (4,4) \\)**:\n   - Directly moves towards \\( (4,2) \\), the closest food.\n   - Aligns with the previous plan to efficiently reach \\( (4,2) \\) by Turn 19.\n\n3. **Right (R) to \\( (5,5) \\)**:\n   - Moves away from the immediate food targets.\n   - Could be part of a longer path to \\( (6,1) \\), but \\( (6,1) \\) is too far to reach before it disappears (by Turn 20).\n\n### Food Accessibility\n- \\( (6,1) \\): Requires at least 6 moves (Manhattan distance), but only 3 moves remain before it disappears (Turn 20). **Unreachable**.\n- \\( (4,2) \\): Can be reached in 3 moves (D to \\( (4,4) \\), D to \\( (4,3) \\), D to \\( (4,2) \\)).\n- \\( (3,2) \\): Can be reached after \\( (4,2) \\) by moving Left (L) from \\( (4,2) \\).\n\n### Decision\nThe most efficient and safe action is to continue the previous plan:\n- **Move Down (D)** to \\( (4,4) \\), setting up to reach \\( (4,2) \\) by Turn 19.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n- Moving to \\( (4,4) \\) is safe (no collisions).\n- Ensures the snake grows by eating \\( (4,2) \\) and then \\( (3,2) \\), maximizing score early.\n\n### Final Action\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Right (R) to (6, 4):**\n   - New head position: (6, 4)\n   - Snake grows if food is eaten: No food at (6,4), so no growth.\n   - Next possible moves from (6,4):\n     - Cannot reverse to left (L) next turn.\n     - Can go U, D, or R.\n   - Distance to foods:\n     - (6,1): 3 steps down (D,D,D), but disappears after Turn 20 (next turn is 20, so can't reach in time).\n     - Other foods are far; not immediately beneficial.\n\n**2. Move Down (D) to (5, 3):**\n   - New head position: (5, 3)\n   - Food at (5,1) is below; can reach in two moves (D to (5,2), then D to (5,1)).\n   - Life span of (5,1) is 10, so plenty of time.\n   - Also, moving down may allow accessing (4,2) later.\n\n**3. Move Up (U) to (5, 5):**\n   - New head position: (5, 5)\n   - No food nearby in that direction.\n   - Moves away from most foods.\n\n### Considering the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous thinking model at Turn 18 planned the following sequence:\n- Turn 18: R\n- Turn 19: D\n- Turn 20: L\n- Turn 21: D\n- Turn 22: L\n\nAt Turn 19, the planned move is D (down) to (5,3).\n\nLet's see if this is still optimal given the current state.\n\n### Verifying the Planned Move (D to (5,3))\n\nAfter moving D to (5,3):\n- Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n  - Tail (2,6) is removed.\n- Next move at Turn 20: L to (4,3)\n  - (4,3) is free (not wall, not obstacle, not in snake body after move).\n- Then at Turn 21: D to (4,2) to eat food at (4,2).\n- Then at Turn 22: L to (3,2) to eat food at (3,2).\n\nThis sequence allows eating two positive foods safely.\n\n### Alternative Immediate Move (R to (6,4))\n\nIf we deviate and move R to (6,4):\n- Snake positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n- Next moves would aim towards foods, but:\n  - (6,1) is unreachable in time.\n  - Other foods require more moves to reach, and the path may become constrained.\n\nThis seems less optimal than following the initial plan.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately at Turn 19?\n- Food at (6,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1) — none adjacent to (5,4).\n- So no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFollowing the initial plan seems optimal:\n- Turn 19: D (down) to (5,3)\n  - Sets up to eat (4,2) and (3,2) in subsequent turns.\n  - Avoids getting trapped in the bottom-left early.\n  - Maximizes score by safely eating two positive foods.\n\nOther moves either don't lead to food quickly or risk trapping the snake.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Valid moves are:\n1. **Down (D)**: Move to (5, 2).\n   - (5, 2) is not a wall or obstacle, and not occupied by the body (except the tail, which is safe).\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (4, 3).\n   - (4, 3) is not a wall or obstacle, and not occupied by the body.\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (6, 3).\n   - (6, 3) is not a wall or obstacle, and not occupied by the body.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (6, 1) is unreachable this turn (Manhattan distance > 1).\n- (3, 2) and (4, 2) are the closest reachable foods.\n  - To reach (4, 2):\n    - Move Down to (5, 2), then Left to (4, 2) on the next turn.\n    - Move Left to (4, 3), then Down to (4, 2) on the next turn.\n  - To reach (3, 2):\n    - Requires additional moves after reaching (4, 2).\n\n### Optimal Path:\nThe best immediate action is to **move towards (4, 2)**, as it has a longer life span (6 turns) and is closer than (3, 2).

The head is not adjacent to the tail, so no danger.\n   - **Food at (5, 1) and (2, 5)**: Both are positive and can be eaten later.\n\n### Immediate Action Decision (Turn 23)\n\nGiven the current state and the guidance from the previous thinking model (which planned to move Left on Turn 22 to eat the food at (3, 2)), the snake is now at (3, 2) with direction Left. The possible moves are U, D, or L.\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (2, 2)**:\n  - No food.\n  - Safe move, but does not gain any points.\n  - The snake would continue moving left, potentially towards the food at (2, 5) in future turns.\n\n- **Move Up (U) to (3, 3)**:\n  - No food.\n  - Safe move, but may lead to a dead end as (3, 4) is an obstacle.\n  - Not ideal for long-term survival.\n\n- **Move Down (D) to (3, 1)**:\n  - No food.\n  - Safe move, and positions the snake to potentially move right towards the food at (5, 1) in future turns.\n  - This aligns with the previous plan to navigate towards (5, 1).\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to **move Down (D)** to (3, 1). This:\n- Avoids dead ends (unlike moving Up).\n- Positions the snake to move right towards the food at (5, 1) in the next turn.\n- Follows the previous plan's strategy of navigating towards the food at (5, 1).\n\n### Action Sequence (Continuation from Previous Plan)\n\n- **Turn 23**: D (from (3, 2) to (3, 1))\n- **Turn 24**: R (from (3, 1) to (4, 1))\n- **Turn 25**: R (from (4, 1) to (5, 1)) to eat the food at (5, 1).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves from (6,1) are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,2)\n   - Check if (6,2) is free:\n     - Not a wall (y=2 is not a border).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (current body positions are from (5,1) to (5,4)).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,0)\n   - y=0 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,1)\n   - (5,1) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment).\n   - Moving here would cause a collision.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,1)\n   - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot perform an instant reverse. The current direction is R (right), so the opposite is L (left), which is already invalid due to body collision.\n\nThus, the only valid move at Turn 27 is **Up (U)** to (6,2).\n\n### Verifying the Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan suggested moving U at Turn 27, which aligns with our current evaluation. Continuing from (6,2):\n\n- **From (6,2)**, direction is U (since we moved up from (6,1)).\n  - Possible moves:\n    - U to (6,3)\n    - D to (6,1) (reverse, but D is opposite to U, so invalid instant reverse)\n    - L to (5,2)\n    - R to (7,2) (x=7 is wall, invalid)\n  - Valid moves: U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\nThe plan was to continue upwards to (6,3), then (6,4), etc., to eventually reach (4,6). This seems safe as:\n\n- Moving upwards along x=6 avoids immediate body collisions.\n- The path is clear of obstacles until reaching (6,6), then moving left to (5,6) and (4,6) to eat the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (5,4), and the head is at (6,1). They are not adjacent, so no risk of the head colliding with the newly grown tail after eating food.\n- **Food Accessibility**:\n  - (2,5): Life span is 5 at Turn 27 (will disappear after Turn 31). Distance is too far to reach in time.\n  - (4,6): Life span is 8 at Turn 27 (will disappear after Turn 34). Reachable via the planned path by Turn 33.\n\n### Alternative Moves Consideration\n\nIs there a better immediate move than U at Turn 27?\n\n- **Moving L to (5,1)**: Invalid (body collision).\n- **Moving D or R**: Invalid (wall or body collision).\n- **Only U is valid**.\n\nThus, no alternative moves are better or safer at this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state and the constraints:\n\n- The only valid move at Turn 27 is **Up (U)** to (6,2).\n- This move aligns with the previous plan to safely navigate towards the positive food at (4,6).\n- There are no immediate risks or better alternatives.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but we must consider:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Cannot move opposite to the current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L.\n2. **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into walls (x=0,7 or y=0,7).\n3. **Body Collision**: Cannot move into any body segment except the tail (since the tail moves forward).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,6) → (6,7)\n   - y=7 is a wall → Invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,6) → (6,5)\n   - Check (6,5):\n     - Not a wall: x=6 (not 0 or 7), y=5 (not 0 or 7).\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (6,5) not in [(1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)].\n     - Not occupied by snake's body: Snake positions are [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1)] → (6,5) not in this list.\n   - Valid move.\n3. **Left (L)**: (6,6) → (5,6)\n   - Instant reverse (from R to L) → Invalid.\n   - Also, (5,6) is the second segment of the snake → Collision → Invalid.\n4. **Right (R)**: (6,6) → (7,6)\n   - x=7 is a wall → Invalid.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid move at Turn 36 is **Down (D)** to (6,5).\n\n### Verifying Future Moves\n\nTo ensure that moving Down doesn't lead to a dead end, let's simulate a few turns:\n\n**Turn 36**: Move D to (6,5).\n- New head: (6,5).\n- New body: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2)].\n- Tail (6,1) is removed (no food eaten).\n- Direction is now D (since we moved Down).\n\n**Turn 37**: From (6,5), direction D.\nPossible moves:\n1. Up (U): (6,5) → (6,6)\n   - (6,6) is part of the body → Collision.\n   - Also, reverse direction (from D to U) → Invalid.\n2. Down (D): (6,5) → (6,4)\n   - Check (6,4):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in snake's body: Current body is [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2)] → (6,4) not here.\n   - Valid.\n3. Left (L): (6,5) → (5,5)\n   - Check (5,5):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in snake's body → Valid.\n4. Right (R): (6,5) → (7,5)\n   - x=7 is a wall → Invalid.\n\n**Choosing between D and L at Turn 37**:\n\n- **Move D to (6,4)**:\n  - Next moves could be D to (6,3), etc., keeping options open.\n- **Move L to (5,5)**:\n  - From (5,5), possible moves:\n    - U to (5,6): body → Collision.\n    - D to (5,4): body → Collision.\n    - L to (4,5): body → Collision.\n    - R to (6,5): body → Collision.\n  - **Dead end**: All moves lead to collision → Snake dies.\n\nThus, at Turn 37, we must move D to (6,4) to avoid the trap at (5,5).\n\n**Turn 37**: Move D to (6,4).\n- New head: (6,4).\n- New body: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)].\n- Tail (6,2) is removed.\n- Direction is D.\n\n**Turn 38**: From (6,4), direction D.\nPossible moves:\n1. Up (U): (6,4) → (6,5)\n   - (6,5) is body → Collision.\n   - Reverse direction → Invalid.\n2. Down (D): (6,4) → (6,3)\n   - Check (6,3):\n     - Not wall, not obstacle, not body → Valid.\n3. Left (L): (6,4) → (5,4)\n   - (5,4) is body → Collision.\n4. Right (R): (6,4) → (7,4)\n   - x=7 is wall → Invalid.\n\nOnly valid move is D to (6,3).\n\n**Turn 38**: Move D to (6,3).\n- New head: (6,3).\n- New body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].\n- Tail (5,2) is removed.\n- Direction is D.\n\n**Turn 39**: From (6,3), direction D.\nPossible moves:\n1. Up (U): (6,3) → (6,4)\n   - (6,4) is body → Collision.\n   - Reverse direction → Invalid.\n2. Down (D): (6,3) → (6,2)\n   - Check (6,2):\n     - Not wall, not obstacle.\n     - Not in body: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)] → (6,2) not here.\n   - Valid.\n3. Left (L): (6,3) → (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is tail → Safe (tail moves away).\n4. Right (R): (6,3) → (7,3)\n   - x=7 is wall → Invalid.\n\nChoices: D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\nBoth are safe, but let's consider food:\n\n- Food at (5,4) is under the body at position (5,4).\n- To eat it, we need to free (5,4) by moving the body away, then move head to it.\n- Currently, (5,4) is part of the body.\n- Moving L to (5,3) is safe but doesn't help with food.\n- Moving D to (6,2) is also safe and may help in future.\n\nGiven that (1,1) and (2,1) are too far to reach before they disappear, and (5,4) has a long life, we can prioritize survival over immediate food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt Turn 36, the only safe and valid move is **Down (D)** to (6,5). All other moves either lead to immediate collision or dead ends in the near future.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Invalid.\n\n### Valid Moves: D or L.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Move Down (D) to (6, 2)**:\n   - New head: (6, 2)\n   - Tail moves away from (5, 3), so (5, 3) is vacated.\n   - No food at (6, 2), so snake length remains the same.\n   - Next turn, from (6, 2), possible moves: Down to (6, 1) or Left to (5, 2).\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 3)**:\n   - New head: (5, 3) (current tail)\n   - Tail moves away from (5, 3), so (5, 4) becomes the new tail.\n   - No food at (5, 3), so snake length remains the same.\n   - Next turn, from (5, 3), possible moves: Left to (4, 3), Up to (5, 4), or Down to (5, 2).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (5, 4) is currently under the snake's body (at position (5, 4)). To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (5, 4), then the head must move onto it.\n  - Moving Left to (5, 3) at Turn 39 will make (5, 4) the tail at Turn 40, allowing the head to move to (5, 4) at Turn 41 to eat it (if no \"Tail Reward Danger\" applies).\n\n### \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- At Turn 39, head is at (6, 3), tail at (5, 3). They are adjacent (horizontally).\n- If we move to (5, 3) (tail), no food is eaten, so no danger.\n- At Turn 40, if head moves to (5, 4) (new tail), and (5, 4) has food, we must check adjacency:\n  - Head at (5, 3), tail at (5, 4): adjacent vertically. Eating (5, 4) would cause the head and new tail to collide (since the snake grows, the tail doesn't move). Thus, this is dangerous and should be avoided.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving Left (L) to (5, 3) at Turn 39 is safe (no food eaten), and it positions the snake to potentially eat (5, 4) later (after ensuring no \"Tail Reward Danger\").\n- Moving Down (D) to (6, 2) is also safe but doesn't help in eating (5, 4) soon.\n\nGiven the guidance from the previous thinking model (which planned to move Left at Turn 39 to set up eating (5, 4) later), we follow that plan.\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{L}",

Internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n  \n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (4, 3)\n  - Body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\n  - Tail: (4, 4)\n  \n- **Snake Head Direction**: Left (L)\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (2, 1): value=1, life_span=1\n  - (5, 4): value=1, life_span=3\n  - (3, 5): value=1, life_span=6\n  - (3, 1): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 41\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is Left (L), the possible moves without instant reverse (cannot move Right) are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (3, 3)\n   - Check if (3, 3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall or border.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (checking the snake positions: (4,3) is head, rest are behind; (3,3) is not in the list).\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (4, 4)\n   - (4, 4) is the tail of the snake.\n   - There is no food at (4, 4) (food is at (5,4), (3,5), etc.).\n   - Moving to the tail is safe if it's not eating food (no Tail Reward Danger here).\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (4, 2)\n   - Check if (4, 2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall or border.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Valid move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Availability\n\nLet's consider the food items and their life spans:\n\n1. **(2, 1)**: life_span=1 (will disappear after Turn 41)\n   - Distance from (4,3): |4-2| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 moves.\n   - Cannot reach it in 1 move (current turn). Will disappear after this turn. Ignore.\n\n2. **(5, 4)**: life_span=3 (available until Turn 43)\n   - Currently under the snake's tail at (4,4).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away (i.e., snake moves without eating).\n     - Then head can move to (5,4).\n   - Current head is at (4,3). To expose (5,4), need to move away from it first.\n\n3. **(3, 5)**: life_span=6 (available until Turn 46)\n   - Can plan to reach it later.\n\n4. **(3, 1)**: life_span=9 (available until Turn 49)\n   - Can plan to reach it much later.\n\n### Planning the Next Moves\n\nFrom the previous plan at Turn 40, the sequence was:\n- Turn 40: L (to (4,3))\n- Turn 41: U (to (4,4))\n- Turn 42: R (to (5,4)) to eat the food at (5,4).\n\nHowever, at Turn 41, the snake is at (4,3), and the next move was planned as U to (4,4). \n\nBut let's verify if this is still the best move:\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (4,4)**\n- (4,4) is the tail.\n- Moving to the tail is safe because:\n  - No food is at (4,4).\n  - After moving, the tail will move away, exposing (5,4) if it's the old tail position.\n- Next move can be Right to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (3,3)**\n- Moves away from the food at (5,4).\n- Not directly helpful for eating (5,4) soon.\n\n**Option 3: Move Down (D) to (4,2)**\n- Moves away from (5,4).\n- Not directly helpful for eating (5,4).\n\nGiven that (5,4) is the most imminent food that can be eaten soon (by Turn 42), moving Up to (4,4) is the best choice to set up for eating it next turn.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nAt Turn 41:\n- Head at (4,3), adjacent to tail at (4,4) (since (4,3) and (4,4) are adjacent).\n- Tail has food? No, food is at (5,4), not at (4,4).\n- So no Tail Reward Danger here. Moving to (4,4) is safe.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately at Turn 41?\n- Head at (4,3). Adjacent cells:\n  - (4,4): tail, no food.\n  - (3,3): no food.\n  - (4,2): no food.\n  - (5,3): body segment, cannot move there.\n- No immediate food to eat.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 41\n\nThe best move is to follow the previous plan and move Up to (4,4) to set up for eating the food at (5,4) on the next turn.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 45 \\):\n\n- **Grid**: 7x7 grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (4,5), followed by body segments: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Total length = 11.\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Left (L).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,5): value = +1, life_span = 2 (will disappear after Turn 46).\n  - (3,1): value = +1, life_span = 5 (will disappear after Turn 49).\n  - (2,3): value = +1, life_span = 8 (will disappear after Turn 52).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 45\n\nFrom the head position (4,5) and current direction L, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: to (3,5)\n   - (3,5) has food with value +1.\n   - Check if eating is safe:\n     - After eating, the snake grows to length 12.\n     - New head at (3,5), body extends to include (4,5), etc.\n     - Tail is at (5,6). Is head adjacent to tail after eating? Head at (3,5), tail at (5,6): not adjacent (distance is sqrt(8) > 1), so safe.\n     - No immediate collision risks.\n   \n2. **Up (U)**: to (4,6)\n   - (4,6) is not occupied by the snake or walls.\n   - No food here, so snake length remains the same.\n   - After move: head at (4,6), body follows, tail at (6,6) is removed.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: to (4,4)\n   - (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (4th segment), so this would cause a collision. Not allowed.\n   \n4. **Right (R)**: to (5,5)\n   - (5,5) is occupied by the snake's body (2nd segment), so collision. Not allowed.\n   - Also, moving right is opposite to current direction (L), which is not allowed (\"no instant reverse\").\n\nSo, valid moves are L (to eat food) or U (to move without eating).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Left (L) to (3,5) to eat food**\n- Pros:\n  - Immediate +1 score.\n  - Food at (3,5) will disappear soon (after Turn 46), so eating now ensures we don't miss it.\n  - Grows the snake, which could be useful for future moves (but also makes maneuvering harder).\n- Cons:\n  - Snake grows longer, which might limit future movement options in tight spaces.\n  - Need to ensure that future moves don't lead to dead ends.\n\n**Option 2: Move Up (U) to (4,6)**\n- Pros:\n  - Keeps the snake length the same, which might help in tight spaces.\n  - Avoids growing the snake, which could be beneficial if we're heading towards more food.\n- Cons:\n  - Misses the +1 score from the food at (3,5), which will disappear soon.\n  - Future moves might still lead to dead ends.\n\n### Future Planning\n\nFrom the previous thinking model's plan (from Turn 44), the sequence was:\n- Turn 44: L (from (5,5) to (4,5))\n- Turn 45: L (from (4,5) to (3,5)) to eat food\n- Turn 46: U (from (3,5) to (3,6))\n- Then move right to avoid dead ends.\n\nThis seems reasonable because:\n1. Eating the food at (3,5) ensures we don't miss it.\n2. Moving up to (3,6) avoids the dangerous area near (2,5) which can lead to dead ends.\n3. Moving right thereafter keeps the snake in open spaces.\n\nIf we choose not to eat at Turn 45 and move U to (4,6), the sequence might be:\n- Turn 45: U to (4,6)\n- Turn 46: Then we can try to eat the food at (3,5) by moving L to (3,6) then D to (3,5), but:\n  - Moving L to (3,6) at Turn 46: head at (3,6), then D to (3,5) at Turn 47.\n  - But at Turn 47, (3,5) is now part of the snake's body (from previous moves), so cannot eat it then. Hence, we'd miss the food.\n\nThus, delaying eating the food at (3,5) leads to missing it entirely, which is not optimal.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: After eating at (3,5), the tail is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to the new head at (3,5), so no danger.\n- **Collisions**: Moving to (3,5) is safe as it's not occupied by the snake's body (only food is there).\n- **Walls/Obstacles**: (3,5) is not a wall or obstacle.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (3,5) to eat the positive food, ensuring we don't miss it and following a safe path as per the previous plan.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The guidance from the previous thinking model suggests moving R at Turn 47 to continue the safe path toward the food at (6,5). \n\n### Immediate Action for Turn \\( t_0 = 47 \\):\n\\boxed{R} \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Valid Moves**: From (3,6) with direction U, the possible moves are:\n   - U: (3,7) → Wall (y=7) → Invalid.\n   - D: (3,5) → Occupied by snake body → Invalid.\n   - L: (2,6) → Free, but leads to a dead end (as analyzed in the previous thinking model).\n   - R: (4,6) → Free and aligns with the safe path toward (6,5).\n\n2. **Previous Plan**: The thinking model at Turn 46 planned to move R at Turn 47 to avoid the left dead end and progress toward the food at (6,5). This remains the optimal choice.\n\n3. **No Instant Reverse**: The current direction is U, so moving D would be invalid (opposite direction) and also blocked by the snake's body.\n\nThus, the only safe and strategic action is **R**.",

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (5,6)\n  - Body: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]\n  - Tail: (6,4)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: R (right)\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,1): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n  - (2,3): value=1, life_span=4\n  - (6,5): value=1, life_span=7\n  - (5,3): value=1, life_span=10\n\nFrom the previous thinking model's output at Turn 48, the planned sequence was:\n- Turn 48: R\n- Turn 49: R\n- Turn 50: D\n- Turn 51: D\n- Turn 52: D\n- Turn 53: L\n\nAt Turn 48, the snake was at (4,6) and moved right to (5,6). Now, at Turn 49, the snake is at (5,6), and the next planned move is R to (6,6).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves at Turn 49\n\nGiven the snake's current position (5,6) and direction R, let's evaluate possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,6) → (5,7)\n   - (5,7) is a wall (y=7 is a border wall). **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,6) → (5,5)\n   - (5,5) is part of the snake's body. **Collision**. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,6) → (4,6)\n   - Opposite of current direction R. **Invalid** (no instant reverse).\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,6) → (6,6)\n   - (6,6) is not a wall or part of the snake's body. **Valid**.\n\nThus, the only valid move is **R to (6,6)**.\n\n### Checking for Food at (6,6)\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (6,6) is not listed as having food. So, moving to (6,6) does not result in eating food.\n\n### Updating Snake Positions After Move\n\nIf the snake moves to (6,6):\n- New head: (6,6)\n- New body: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]\n- Tail (6,4) moves away, so (6,5) is now free (previously had food under the tail).\n\n### Next Steps and Considerations\n\nThe next planned move at Turn 50 is D to (6,5), which has food. Let's see if that's possible:\n\nAt Turn 50:\n- Snake head at (6,6), direction R (since last move was R).\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (6,7) → wall. **Invalid**.\n  - D: (6,5) → has food (value=1, life_span=7 at Turn 48, so at Turn 50, life_span=5).\n    - Distance from head (6,6) to tail (6,4): |6-6| + |6-4| = 2 (not adjacent).\n    - No Tail Reward Danger.\n    - Valid move to eat food.\n  - L: (5,6) → part of the body. **Invalid**.\n  - R: (7,6) → wall. **Invalid**.\n\nThus, at Turn 50, the only valid move is D to (6,5) to eat the food, increasing the score by +1 and the snake's length by 1.\n\n### Verifying the Plan\n\nThe sequence seems sound:\n1. Turn 49: R to (6,6) (only option).\n2. Turn 50: D to (6,5) to eat food (only option).\n3. Subsequent moves (Turn 51: D, Turn 52: D, Turn 53: L) can be evaluated similarly based on the new state after eating.\n\n### Potential Issues\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: At Turn 50, when moving to (6,5), the tail is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to the head (6,6). So, no danger.\n- **Food Expiration**: \n  - (3,1): Disappears after Turn 49 (not reachable).\n  - (2,3): Disappears after Turn 52 (life_span=4 at Turn 49: 49,50,51,52).\n    - At Turn 49, head at (5,6); distance to (2,3) is |5-2| + |6-3| = 6. Cannot reach in time.\n  - (5,3): Disappears after Turn 59 (not urgent).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move at Turn 49 is **R (right)** to (6,6), following the previously planned sequence to eventually eat the food at (6,5) at Turn 50.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However, at Turn 53, the snake is at (6,3), and both (6,2) and (5,3) are valid moves with food.\n\nConsidering the long-term survival:\n- Moving Left to (5,3) seems better as it moves the snake towards the center and avoids the edge.\n- The food at (6,2) has a longer lifespan (until Turn 61), so it can be eaten later.\n- The food at (5,3) has a shorter lifespan (until Turn 58), but still enough time to be eaten later if not now.\n\nHowever, the immediate priority is to maximize score while ensuring the snake doesn't get trapped. Eating (5,3) now seems safer as it doesn't corner the snake as much as moving down to (6,2) would.\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 53\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (5,3) to eat the food there.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This aligns with the current state (head at (6,1), direction `D`).\n2. **Current Turn 57 Action**: \n   - **Head Position/Direction**: (6,1), moving `D` (down). \n   - **Valid Moves**: \n     - `U` (up to (6,2)): Occupied by body (segment (6,2)) and is instant reverse (opposite of `D`), so invalid. \n     - `D` (down to (6,0)): Wall collision (y=0). \n     - `R` (right to (7,1)): Wall collision (x=7). \n     - `L` (left to (5,1)): Free (not wall/body) and allowed (not instant reverse). \n   - **Only Valid Move**: `L` (left to (5,1)), as confirmed by the previous plan.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The sequence continues as planned: `L` at Turn 57, `L` at Turn 58, then `U` at Turn 59 to path toward the food at (4,4). \n- The action strictly adheres to the non-thinking executor role, following the precomputed safe path.",

The two possible moves now are L or U.\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - Moves away from the food area, making it harder to reach (5,6) later.\n   - Not optimal for the plan to eat (5,6).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (3,6)**:\n   - Moves closer to (5,6), setting up a better path to reach it after it's vacated.\n   - From (3,6), next moves could be towards (5,6) after turn 66.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (3,6), aligning with the plan to reach (5,6) after it's vacated.\n\n\\boxed{U}",
