        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn, so I only check the car on the current y for collision.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1, which is 0 here, and I need to find actions starting from t_1.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn relative to t_1=0.\n\nThe car update: for a car at t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving, d is left, but in the table, all cars are \"right\" or \"left\"? Looking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,3) — so direction is right, meaning it moves to the right.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nLeft-moving: span becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, since it's moving right, the head is on the right, so at time T, the span is from τ + sΔT to h + sΔT, where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, from h - sΔT to τ - sΔT.\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to be careful with head and tail. For right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end. For left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end? The problem doesn't specify, but from the span update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIf h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, if head is the front when moving left, so if it's moving left, head should be the leftmost point? Let's see the update.\n\nSuppose at t1, span is [h, τ] for left-moving. Then at T, it moves left, so positions decrease, so [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. Since it's moving left, the head (front) should be at min position? I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the position of the ends.\n\nFor a car, at time t, it occupies a set of x-positions.\n\nAt t1, for a given car, we have head and tail positions, which define the span.\n\nFor direction, if right-moving, the car is moving to increasing x, so the tail is at smaller x, head at larger x.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, tail at larger x, head at smaller x? But in the update formula, it's consistent with the direction.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: (48,37,right,3) — since direction right, head=48, tail=37, so at t1, span [37,48]? But it says head=48, tail=37, and direction right.\n\nIn the span for right-moving: at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nAt t1, ΔT=0, so [τ, h], so for this car, at t1, span is [37,48], since τ=37, h=48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] at t1, and [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] at T.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=3\n\nFreeway 2: three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\n-48,-59? tail=-59, head=-48? So span at t1: [ -59, -48 ]? But that seems odd, positions can be negative, I guess.\n\nSimilarly, second car: tail=-23, head=-12, span [-23,-12]? head=-12, tail=-23, so τ=-23, h=-12, so span [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t1.\n\nThird car: head=24, tail=13, span [13,24]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3? Also identical.\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,6) — similar to freeway 1 but speed 6.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4) — tail=-59, head=-48, dir=right, speed=4\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nNow, all cars are right-moving, so for each, at time T, the span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nt1=0, so at time T, position x: for a car, min x = τ + sT, max x = h + sT\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y at that turn, and for some car on freeway y, the player position x=0 is between min x and max x inclusive, I assume.\n\nSince player is at (0,y), so x=0.\n\nSo for a car on freeway y at turn T, if min_x <= 0 <= max_x, then collision if player is on that y.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn T if that's where they are during that turn.\n\nNow, I start at (0,0) at turn t1=0.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nBut I start at (0,0) at turn 0, and I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say H-1.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with y_{t1} = y_0 = 0, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, I think.\n\nLet t be the turn index starting from t1=0.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, and we check for collision on freeway y_t if 1<=y_t<=8.\n\nThen after action, at turn t+1, y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0, which is safe, and end at y=9, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=1 to 8, but I can avoid being there when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since I need to go from 0 to 9, the minimum possible is 9 actions if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\ny_t changes by at most 1 per turn, so from 0 to 9, minimum 9 turns, but that would be at turn 9, y=9.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at t=1, y= y0 + Δy_0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn H, y_H = y_{t1 + H}? Let's index properly.\n\nt1=0, initial turn, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, which is a_0, we go to turn t1+1=1, position y_{t1+1} = y_1.\n\nThen after a_{t1+1} = a_1, to y_2, and so on, up to after a_{t1+H-1}, we have y_{t1+H}, and we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions, and we reach y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, one action a_{t1}, then y_{t1+1} = y_1 = y0 + Δy, which could be 1,0, or -1, but to reach 9, not possible in one action. Min H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more if I need to wait.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, when a car is at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, and each car on it, find the times T when min_x <=0<= max_x for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to find if any car on that freeway has x=0 occupied at time T.\n\nFor a given freeway y, at time T, collision if there exists a car on y such that τ + sT <= 0 <= h + sT for that car.\n\nSince all cars on same freeway might have different τ,h,s, I need to check each.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and their span at time T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1, one car: τ=37, h=48, s=3, dir=right.\n\nAt time T, min_x = 37 + 3T, max_x = 48 + 3T\n\nCollision if min_x <=0<= max_x, so 37+3T <=0 and 0<=48+3T\n\nBut 48+3T >=48>0 always true for T>=0.\n\n37+3T <=0 => 3T <= -37 => T <= -37/3 ≈ -12.333, but T>=0, so 37+3T >=37>0, so min_x =37+3T >0 for all T>=0, so 0 < min_x, so 0 not in [min_x, max_x], so no collision on freeway 1 at any time. Because the car is at x=37 to 48 and moving right, so always positive and increasing, never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: y=5, car τ=37, h=48, s=6, dir=right.\n\nmin_x =37+6T, max_x=48+6T, both >0 for T>=0, so no collision on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, car τ=-59, h=-48, s=4, dir=right.\n\nτ=-59, h=-48, so min_x = τ + sT = -59 + 4T\n\nmax_x = h + sT = -48 + 4T\n\nCollision if min_x <=0<= max_x, so -59+4T <=0 and 0<= -48+4T\n\nFirst, 0<= -48+4T => 4T >=48 => T>=12\n\nSecond, -59+4T <=0 => 4T <=59 => T<=14.75, so T<=14 since integer T.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo for T from 12 to 14 inclusive, collision possible? min_x <=0<= max_x.\n\nAt T=12: min_x = -59 +4*12 = -59+48= -11, max_x= -48+48=0\n\nSo min_x=-11, max_x=0, so 0 is included, since max_x=0, so 0 <=0 is true, so yes, collision at T=12.\n\nAt T=13: min_x=-59+52= -7? 4*13=52, -59+52=-7, max_x=-48+52=4, so -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nT=14: min_x=-59+56=-3, max_x=-48+56=8, so -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nT=15: min_x=-59+60=1, max_x=-48+60=12, min_x=1>0, so 0 not <= max_x? 0 < min_x, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: min_x=-59+44= -15, max_x=-48+44= -4, both <0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same car, τ=-59, h=-48, s=4, so same as freeway 7, collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, three cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12, dir=right\n\nmin_x = -59 +12T, max_x = -48 +12T\n\nCollision if -59+12T <=0 and 0<= -48+12T\n\n0<= -48+12T => 12T>=48 => T>=4\n\n-59+12T <=0 => 12T<=59 => T<=4.916, so T<=4\n\nT>=4 and T<=4, so T=4.\n\nAt T=4: min_x=-59+48= -11, max_x=-48+48=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T=5: min_x=-59+60=1, max_x=-48+60=12, min_x=1>0, not <=0.\n\nT=3: min_x=-59+36= -23, max_x=-48+36= -12, both <0.\n\nSo only at T=4 for this car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: τ=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nmin_x = -23 +12T, max_x = -12 +12T\n\nCollision: -23+12T <=0 and 0<= -12+12T\n\n0<= -12+12T => T>=1\n\n-23+12T <=0 => 12T<=23 => T<=1.916, so T<=1\n\nT>=1 and T<=1, so T=1.\n\nAt T=1: min_x=-23+12= -11, max_x=-12+12=0, 0 in span.\n\nT=2: min_x=-23+24=1, max_x=-12+24=12, min_x=1>0.\n\nT=0: min_x=-23, max_x=-12, both <0.\n\nThird car on freeway 2: τ=13, h=24, s=12\n\nmin_x=13+12T, max_x=24+12T\n\nCollision: 13+12T <=0? 13+12T >=13>0, so min_x>0, always, no collision.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision possible at T=4 (from first car) and T=1 (from second car). Since any car can cause collision, so at T=1 and T=4, there is collision on y=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same cars: collision at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 1,5,6 no collision.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nI need to get from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8.\n\nI start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nAt turn 0, I am at y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nThen I take action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, I need to not be on a freeway y when collision happens on that y at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T=1, on freeways 2,3,4, there is collision, so I should not be on y=2,3, or 4 at turn 1.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, on y=2,3,4, collision.\n\nAt T=12,13,14, on y=7 and 8, collision.\n\nOther times, no collision except those.\n\nBut for freeways with no cars or cars never at zero, like y=1,5,6, no collision at any time.\n\ny=1 has no collision, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly y=5 and 6.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe shortest path is to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid being on the bad freeways at bad times.\n\nThe critical times are T=1,4,12,13,14.\n\nAt T=1, I should not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=4, not on y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=12,13,14, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSince y=1,5,6 are always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, I start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nAt turn 0, I take action a_0, which sets y_1.\n\ny_1 can be 0 (if S), 1 (if U), or -1 but y=-1 invalid, so y_1 must be 0 or 1, since y=0, action D would go to y=-1, not allowed, so from y=0, possible actions: S (y=0), U (y=1), D not possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, D to 8, S to 9, U not possible.\n\nBut here start from y=0.\n\nSo at turn 0, a_0: S or U.\n\nIf S, y_1=0, still at start.\n\nIf U, y_1=1.\n\nNow, at turn 1, if I am on y=1, that is fine, no collision on y=1.\n\nBut on y=2,3,4 at turn 1, collision.\n\nSo if I go to y_1=1, I am on y=1 at turn 1, which is safe.\n\nIf I stay at y_0=0, also safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut let's see the constraints.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=1 and T=4.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=7,8 at T=12,13,14.\n\nSince y=2,3,4 are symmetric in collision times, I can treat them similarly.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nSuppose I start by going up.\n\nAt turn 0, action U, then y_1=1 at turn 1.\n\nAt turn 1, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 1, I take action, can go to y=2,1, or 0.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at turn 2, but turn 2 is not a collision time for y=2, since collision only at T=1 and T=4 for y=2,3,4.\n\nAt T=2, no collision on any freeway, I think.\n\nT=1: y=2,3,4 collision\n\nT=4: y=2,3,4 collision\n\nT=12,13,14: y=7,8 collision\n\nOther times, all freeways safe.\n\nAt T=2, no collision, so I can be on any y.\n\nSimilarly T=3, etc.\n\nSo from turn 1, y=1, I can go to y=2 at turn 2.\n\ny_2=2.\n\nAt turn 2, I am on y=2 at turn 2, which is safe, since no collision at T=2.\n\nThen I can go to y=3 at turn 3, or stay, etc.\n\nBut at turn 4, I need not to be on y=2,3,4.\n\nTurn 4 is a problem.\n\nSimilarly, later for y=7,8 at T=12,13,14.\n\nFirst, let's get to higher y.\n\nSince y=1,5,6 are always safe, I might stay there if needed.\n\nBut to go up, I need to pass through.\n\nMinimal time: if no cars, I can go UUUUUUUUU, 9 actions, from turn 0 to turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at turn 4, and on y=7,8 at turns 12,13,14.\n\nTurn 4 is early, turns 12-14 later.\n\nSince I start at turn 0, I can reach y=9 before turn 12 if I go fast.\n\nFor example, if I go up continuously, at turn t, y_t = t, since start from y=0.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, turn 1, y=1\n\na_1=U, turn 2, y=2\n\na_2=U, turn 3, y=3\n\na_3=U, turn 4, y=4\n\nAt turn 4, y=4, which is freeway 4, and at T=4, collision on y=4, so I would collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=2 or 3 at turn 4, also collide.\n\nSo at turn 4, I must not be on y=2,3, or 4.\n\nWhere can I be? On y=0,1,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at turn 4, if I have y=4, I collide, so I need to not be there.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 1, if I were on y=2,3,4, I collide, but at turn 1, I can be on y=1, which is safe.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 4, y=4 is bad.\n\nSo I need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at all times, I can stay on y=1 for some turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nNow, turn 4 is the issue.\n\nI need at turn 4 to be not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSo possible: on y=1, or y=5 or above, or below.\n\nBut below y=1 might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, where can I be?\n\nIf I go directly, at turn 3, y=3.\n\nThen at turn 4, if I go up, y=4, collide.\n\nIf I stay, y=3, still on y=3 at turn 4, collide.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2, but at turn 4, y=2, still collide.\n\nSo from y=3 at turn 3, any action leads to y=2,3, or 4 at turn 4, all bad.\n\ny=2,3,4 are all bad at turn 4.\n\nSo if I am on y=2 or 3 at turn 3, I cannot avoid being on bad y at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=4 at turn 3, same issue.\n\nAt turn 3, if y=3, then a_3: U to y=4 at turn 4, bad; S to y=3 at turn 4, bad; D to y=2 at turn 4, bad.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 3, y=2: U to y=3 at turn 4, bad; S to y=2, bad; D to y=1 at turn 4.\n\ny=1 at turn 4 is safe, since no collision on y=1.\n\nIf at turn 3, y=2, and I go down to y=1 at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 3, y=4, I can go down to y=3, but y=3 at turn 4 bad; or to y=4 bad; or to y=5? From y=4, action U to y=5.\n\ny=5 at turn 4, is it safe? y=5 has no collision at any time, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6, etc.\n\nBut in the direct path, at turn 3, I am at y=3.\n\nTo avoid being on bad y at turn 4, I need to not be at y=3 at turn 3 if I plan to go to bad y, but I can be at y=3 at turn 3 only if I go up slowly.\n\nLet's think from the beginning.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0, a_0: U or S.\n\nIf a_0=U, then turn 1, y=1.\n\nNow at turn 1, y=1, safe.\n\na_1: I can go U to y=2, or S to y=1, or D to y=0.\n\nIf I go U to y=2 at turn 2.\n\nTurn 2, y=2, safe (no collision at T=2).\n\nNow a_2: I can go U to y=3, or S, or D.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at turn 3.\n\nTurn 3, y=3, safe (no collision at T=3).\n\nNow at turn 3, I need to choose action for turn 4.\n\nI cannot stay or go up or down to y=2,3,4 at turn 4.\n\nSo I must go to y=1 or y=5.\n\nBut from y=3, I can go down to y=2, but y=2 at turn 4 bad; or to y=3 bad; or to y=4 bad. I can only change by 1, so from y=3, possible y_{t+1} = 2,3,4.\n\nAll of which are bad at turn 4.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=3 at turn 3, because I have no good action for turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 2, I am at y=2.\n\nThen at turn 3, if I go down to y=1, then at turn 3, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can be on y=1, safe, or go to y=2 or y=0.\n\nBut y=2 at turn 4 bad, so I can stay on y=1 or go down to y=0.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nFrom turn 2, y=2, if I go down to y=1 at turn 3.\n\nThen at turn 3, y=1.\n\nThen a_3: I can go U to y=2 at turn 4, but turn 4 y=2 bad; S to y=1 at turn 4, safe; D to y=0 at turn 4, safe.\n\nBut to go up, I need to not go to y=2 at turn 4.\n\nSo I can stay on y=1 at turn 4, or go down.\n\nBut staying on y=1 delays.\n\nAfter turn 4, I can go up.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 2, I am at y=2, I could go up to y=3 at turn 3, but as before, stuck.\n\nOr stay at y=2 at turn 3, but then at turn 3, y=2, and at turn 4, if I go down to y=1, then turn 4 y=1 safe.\n\nLet's list the states.\n\nI need to be not on y=2,3,4 at turn 4.\n\nSo at turn 4, y must be 1, or 5,6,7,8,9, or 0.\n\nBut y=0 is low.\n\nSince I am at turn 0,1,2,3, I can be at different positions.\n\nTo minimize time, I should be as high as possible by turn 4, but not on 2,3,4.\n\nSo possible to be on y=5 at turn 4, for example.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start, at turn 0, a_0=U, y1=1 at turn 1.\n\na_1=U, y2=2 at turn 2.\n\na_2=U, y3=3 at turn 3.\n\nNow at turn 3, y=3, I need to go to y=5? But I can only change by 1, so to y=4 or 2, not 5.\n\nImpossible to reach y=5 from y=3 in one step.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 4, y=4 is bad, but I can be at y=5 if I were at y=4 or y=6, but from y=3, I can only go to 2,3,4.\n\nSo at turn 3, I must be at y=1 or y=5 or something to be safe at turn 4.\n\nBut y=5 at turn 3: how? From start, at turn 0 y=0, turn 1 y=1, turn 2 y=2, turn 3 y=3, so y=3 at turn 3 is the highest I can be.\n\nUnless I go slower earlier.\n\nFor example, if at turn 0, I stay, a_0=S, then turn 1 y=0.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nAt turn 1, if I am at y=0, then a_1=U, turn 2 y=1.\n\nThen a_2=U, turn 3 y=2.\n\nThen at turn 3, y=2, I can go down to y=1 at turn 4, for example.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nFrom turn 0 to turn 4, I can be at y=1.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=9, 8 steps, so at least 8 actions from there.\n\nBut I have actions from turn 4 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's avoid turn 4 collision.\n\nSo one way: at turn 3, be at y=2 or y=3 or y=4, but then I have to go to y=1 or y=5, but can't reach y=5 from y=3, so must go down to y=2 or less, but at turn 4, y=2,3,4 bad, so from y=3 at turn 3, I can go down to y=2 at turn 4, but bad, or to y=4 bad, no good.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2,3,4 at turn 3, because from there, I can only be on y=2,3,4 at turn 4, all bad.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 3, I am on y=1, then at turn 4, I can be on y=1 (safe), or y=2 (bad), or y=0 (safe).\n\nSo I can be on y=1 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 3, I am on y=5, then at turn 4, I can be on y=5 (safe), y=6, or y=4.\n\ny=4 at turn 4 bad, so I can stay or go up, not down.\n\nBut how to be on y=5 at turn 3?\n\nFrom start, at turn 0 y=0, turn 1 y=1, turn 2 y=2, turn 3 y=3, can't be y=5.\n\nIf I go slower, at turn 2, y=1, for example.\n\nThen at turn 3, I can go to y=2.\n\nBut at turn 3 y=2, then turn 4 I have to go to y=1 to avoid bad.\n\nThen turn 4 y=1.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nBut at turn 2, if I am at y=1, I can go to y=2 at turn 3, but then turn 4 problem.\n\nAt turn 2, if I am at y=1, I can stay at y=1 at turn 3, then at turn 4, I can stay at y=1 or go to y=2 or y=0.\n\nBut if I go to y=2 at turn 4, bad, so I can stay or go down.\n\nThen at turn 4, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, similarly, I need to handle the later times.\n\nFirst, let's plan to be at y=1 at turn 4.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut there is another constraint at T=12,13,14 for y=7 and 8.\n\nT=12 is later, so if I go fast, I might reach y=9 before T=12.\n\nTurn 4 is at t=4, y=1.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 8 more steps, so at turn 12, I could be at y=1 + 8 =9, if I go up every turn.\n\nTurn 4, y=1.\n\nAfter action a_4, turn 5, y=2 or 1 or 0.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\na_4=U, turn 5 y=2\n\na_5=U, turn 6 y=3\n\na_6=U, turn 7 y=4\n\na_7=U, turn 8 y=5\n\na_8=U, turn 9 y=6\n\na_9=U, turn 10 y=7\n\na_10=U, turn 11 y=8\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=9\n\nAt turn 12, y=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut at turn 10, y=7 at turn 10.\n\nIs there collision on y=7 at T=10? Collision on y=7 only at T=12,13,14.\n\nT=10 is before, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11, y=8 at turn 11, collision on y=8 at T=12,13,14, T=11 is not those, so safe.\n\nTurn 12, y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this case, I reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nNow, what about turn 4? In this path, at turn 4, I was at y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to get to y=1 at turn 4.\n\nFrom start.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0, a_0=U, turn 1 y=1\n\nAt turn 1, y=1, a_1=U, turn 2 y=2\n\nAt turn 2, y=2, now I need to not be on bad at turn 4, so at turn 3, I can go down to y=1 or something.\n\nAt turn 2, y=2, a_2: if I go U, to y=3 at turn 3, then stuck.\n\nIf I go S, to y=2 at turn 3, then at turn 3, y=2, then a_3: I can go D to y=1 at turn 4, for example.\n\nThen turn 4 y=1, safe.\n\nIf at turn 2, I go D to y=1 at turn 3, then at turn 3 y=1, then a_3: I can go S to y=1 at turn 4, or U to y=2 but bad, or D to y=0.\n\nSo I can go S to y=1 at turn 4.\n\nEither way.\n\nTo minimize actions, I should go up when possible.\n\nIn the path above, from turn 0 to 2: I have y=0,1,2 at turns 0,1,2.\n\nThen at turn 2, action a_2: let's say I go down to y=1 at turn 3.\n\na_2 = D, then turn 3 y=1.\n\nThen a_3 = S or D, to be at y=1 at turn 4.\n\nSay a_3=S, turn 4 y=1.\n\nThen from turn 4, as before, go up: a_4=U, turn 5 y=2\n\na_5=U, turn 6 y=3\n\na_6=U, turn 7 y=4\n\na_7=U, turn 8 y=5\n\na_8=U, turn 9 y=6\n\na_9=U, turn 10 y=7\n\na_10=U, turn 11 y=8\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=9\n\nSo I reach at turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 4, y=1, and I stayed or went down to be safe, but I could have been higher.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, if I could be at y=5, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is always safe, I could go to y=5 quickly.\n\nBut to reach y=5, from y=0, min 5 steps: turn 5 y=5 if all U.\n\nAt turn 0: y=0, a0=U, turn1 y=1\n\na1=U, turn2 y=2\n\na2=U, turn3 y=3\n\na3=U, turn4 y=4 — but at turn4 y=4, collision! Bad.\n\nIf I go slower, at turn4 y=4 bad.\n\nSo I must not be at y=4 at turn4.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=5 is turn5.\n\nAt turn5, y=5, safe.\n\nBut at turn4, I need to be not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSo for example, at turn3, I can be at y=1 or y=5, but y=5 not possible.\n\nOnly y=1 or below.\n\nSo I think being at y=1 at turn4 is fine.\n\nThen go up to y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at turn4?\n\nFor example, if I stay at start for one turn.\n\nAt turn0, a0=S, turn1 y=0\n\nThen a1=U, turn2 y=1\n\na2=U, turn3 y=2\n\nThen at turn3 y=2, a3=D to y=1 at turn4.\n\nThen turn4 y=1.\n\nSame as before, but I started slower, so I reach later.\n\nTurn0 S, so at turn1 y=0, then I need to go to y=1 at turn2, etc., so at turn4 y=1, same as before, but I wasted one turn at start, so I reach later.\n\nFor example, from above, if I do a0=S, turn1 y=0\n\na1=U, turn2 y=1\n\na2=U, turn3 y=2? At turn2 y=1, a2=U, turn3 y=2\n\nThen a3=D, turn4 y=1\n\nThen from turn4, go up to y=9 at turn12? Let's count.\n\nTurn4 y=1\n\na4=U, turn5 y=2\n\n...\n\nup to a11=U, turn12 y=9? From y=1 to y=9, 8 steps: after 8 actions, y increases by 8, from y1 to y9.\n\nStart from turn4 y=1.\n\nAfter a4, turn5 y=2\n\na5, turn6 y=3\n\na6, turn7 y=4\n\na7, turn8 y=5\n\na8, turn9 y=6\n\na9, turn10 y=7\n\na10, turn11 y=8\n\na11, turn12 y=9\n\nSo turn12 y=9.\n\nBut if I started with a0=U, I had turn1 y=1, but then I went down at some point.\n\nIn the first path: turn0: y=0, a0=U\n\nturn1: y=1\n\na1=U\n\nturn2: y=2\n\na2=D? In my first plan, at turn2, a2=D to go to y=1 at turn3\n\nThen turn3: y=1\n\na3=S, turn4: y=1\n\nThen a4=U, turn5 y=2\n\n...\n\na11=U, turn12 y=9\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nIf at turn2 y=2, I go S to y=2 at turn3, then a3=D to y=1 at turn4.\n\nThen turn4 y=1, same.\n\nNow, but I have the later constraint: at T=12,13,14, I need not to be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn this path, at turn10: y=7? From above: turn4 y=1, turn5 y=2, turn6 y=3, turn7 y=4, turn8 y=5, turn9 y=6, turn10 y=7, turn11 y=8, turn12 y=9.\n\nAt turn10, y=7 at turn10.\n\nT=10, collision on y=7 at T=12,13,14, so T=10 is fine, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, turn11 y=8 at T=11, not 12,13,14, fine.\n\nTurn12 y=9, fine.\n\nBut at turn10 y=7, which is fine.\n\nNow, however, if I were on y=7 at turn12, it would be bad, but I am at y=8 at turn11 and y=9 at turn12, so not on y=7 or 8 at T=12.\n\nT=12: at turn12, y=9, not freeway.\n\nBut just to confirm.\n\nIn this path, I have to go down at turn2 or something, which might not be efficient, but it works.\n\nBut can I avoid going down and reach faster?\n\nSuppose I go up to y=3 at turn3, but I cannot stay there for turn4.\n\nUnless I jump, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 and y=6 are always safe, I could reach them earlier and stay, but I need to pass through y=2,3,4.\n\nBut at turn4, I must not be on them.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 before turn4 or after.\n\nFor example, at turn3, y=3, but I have to leave before turn4.\n\nBut at turn3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at turn4.\n\nNo way.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 at turn4.\n\nTo be at y=5 at turn4, I need at turn3 to be at y=4 or y=5 or y=6.\n\nBut at turn3, from start, max y=3, so I can be at y=4 only if I was at y=3 at turn2 and go up, but at turn2 y=3? Turn0 y=0, turn1 y=1, turn2 y=2, can't y=3 at turn2.\n\nMinimal time to y=4 is turn4: turn0 y0=0, a0=U, y1=1; a1=U, y2=2; a2=U, y3=3; a3=U, y4=4.\n\nBut y4=4 at turn4 bad.\n\nTo be at y=5 at turn4, impossible, since y4 <= y3 +1 <=4, since y3<=3.\n\ny3 <=3, so y4 <=4.\n\nSo at turn4, y<=4, and if y=2,3,4, bad, so only possible y=0 or1 at turn4.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 or1.\n\nIn practice, y=1 is the best.\n\nSo I must be at y<=1 at turn4.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nNow, in the up path, I need to handle T=12,13,14 for y=7 and8.\n\nIn the above, I reach y=9 at turn12, before the critical times except turn12.\n\nBut at turn12, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut what about turn11, y=8 at turn11, which is not T=12, so fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I don't go down, but I have to.\n\nAnother point: at turn1, I could stay on y=1 longer.\n\nBut in the above path, from turn4 y=1, I go up continuously to y=9 at turn12.\n\nTotal turns: from turn0 to turn12, that's 13 turns? Let's index.\n\nTurn t: from 0 to 12, that's 13 turns, but positions from y0 to y12.\n\ny at turn t.\n\nStart: turn0, y=0\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nActions from a0 to a_{H-1}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_t for t=0 to H-1, y_H =9.\n\nIn the path: after a0, turn1 y1\n\n...\n\nafter a11, turn12 y12=9\n\nSo actions a0 to a11, that's 12 actions, H=12.\n\ny at turn12=9.\n\nMinimal without cars is 9 actions, to turn9 y9=9.\n\nHere 12 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nSince I have to be low at turn4, but maybe I can be higher later.\n\nAnother constraint is the late times.\n\nT=12,13,14 for y=7,8.\n\nIf I reach y=9 before turn12, I can avoid that.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at turn11 or earlier.\n\nBut from turn4 y=1, min to y=9 is 8 actions, to turn12.\n\nturn4 y=1, after 8 actions: a4 to a11, turn5 to turn12, y from 2 to 9, turn12 y=9.\n\nCan I be faster before turn4?\n\nAt turn4, I must be y=1 or 0.\n\nIf I can be y=1 earlier, but I need to waste time to avoid being high at turn4.\n\nFor example, at turn0, if I stay, turn1 y=0.\n\nThen a1=U, turn2 y=1.\n\nThen I can stay on y=1 or go up.\n\nBut if I go up to y=2 at turn3, then at turn4 I have to come down to y=1, so same as before.\n\nIf I stay on y=1 from turn2 to turn4.\n\nFor example:\n\nturn0: y=0, a0=U, turn1 y=1\n\na1=S, turn2 y=1 (since S, no change)\n\na2=S, turn3 y=1\n\na3=S, turn4 y=1\n\nThen at turn4 y=1, safe.\n\nThen from turn4, go up: a4=U, turn5 y=2\n\na5=U, turn6 y=3\n\na6=U, turn7 y=4\n\na7=U, turn8 y=5\n\na8=U, turn9 y=6\n\na9=U, turn10 y=7\n\na10=U, turn11 y=8\n\na11=U, turn12 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut I used S actions, which don't progress.\n\nIn the first way, I used D action at turn2, which also doesn't progress.\n\nIn terms of number, same H=12.\n\nBut in the first way with down, at turn2 I went down, so at turn3 y=1, then S at turn3 to y=1 at turn4.\n\nIn terms of y-position, at turn3 I was at y=1 instead of higher.\n\nBut since I have to be low at turn4, it's fine.\n\nNow, but in this case, at turn10 y=7, which is before T=12, fine.\n\nBut suppose I want to reach earlier, I need to be higher at turn4, but I can't.\n\nUnless I go faster to y=5 or6, but I can't before turn5.\n\nAt turn5, I can be at y=5, for example.\n\nBut turn5 is after turn4.\n\nAt turn4, I must not be on y=2,3,4, so I can be on y=5 only if I were at y=4 or5 or6 at turn3, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12, with y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the late collision with fewer actions.\n\nSuppose I go up faster after turn4.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps, turn12.\n\nIf I can start higher, but I can't at turn4.\n\nAnother idea: for the late times, T=12,13,14, I need not to be on y=7 or8 at those turns.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=7 at turn10, y=8 at turn11, both before T=12.\n\nBut if I were slower, I might be on y=7 at turn12, which is bad.\n\nBut in this case, I am fine.\n\nSuppose I want to reach before turn12.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=9 at turn11.\n\nThen I need y=9 at turn11.\n\nFrom turn0, min 11 turns? turn0 y=0, after 11 actions, turn11 y=11, but y max=9, so I can reach at turn9 with 9 actions.\n\nBut with constraints, at turn4, I need to be low.\n\nSuppose at turn4 I am at y=1, then to y=9 at turn11, I need 7 steps: from y=1 to y=9 in 7 steps? y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so min 8 steps.\n\nAfter k actions, y increases by at most k.\n\nFrom turn4 y=1, after k actions, y_{4+k} <= 1 + k.\n\nSet y_{4+k} =9, so 1+k >=9, k>=8.\n\nSo turn 4+8 =12, y12=9.\n\nCannot reach before turn12.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at turn4, then even later.\n\nSo minimal is turn12 with y=9.\n\nAnd in the path, I can avoid collisions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, at turn1, I need not to be on y=2,3,4, but in the path, at turn1, I am on y=1, which is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose.\n\nTo minimize actions, but H is fixed at 12.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to have at turn4 y=1.\n\nFor example, one way:\n\nturn0: y=0, a0=U (to y=1 at turn1)\n\nturn1: y=1, a1=U (to y=2 at turn2)\n\nturn2: y=2, now a2: I can go D to y=1 at turn3, or S to y=2 at turn3, then from there go D or something.\n\nIf a2=D, then turn3 y=1\n\nThen a3=S, turn4 y=1\n\nThen a4=U, turn5 y=2\n\na5=U, turn6 y=3\n\na6=U, turn7 y=4\n\na7=U, turn8 y=5\n\na8=U, turn9 y=6\n\na9=U, turn10 y=7\n\na10=U, turn11 y=8\n\na11=U, turn12 y=9\n\nActions: a0=U, a1=U, a2=D, a3=S, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U\n\nAt turn3, I did a3=S, but I could do a3=U to y=2, but at turn4 y=2 bad, so I must not.\n\na3=D to y=0 at turn4, but then I start from lower, later arrival.\n\nSo better to stay at y=1.\n\nAt turn2, I could do a2=S, then turn3 y=2, then a3=D to y=1 at turn4.\n\nThen same, turn4 y=1.\n\nThen same up sequence.\n\nBut in that case, a2=S, a3=D.\n\nSlightly different actions.\n\nBut both H=12.\n\nNow, about the late times: in this path, at turn10 y=7, turn11 y=8, both at T=10 and 11, not 12,13,14, so no collision.\n\ny=7 and 8 have cars only at T=12,13,14 for collision.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8.\n\nAt turn10, y=7, T=10, not collision time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there any other collision times?\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at T=1 and T=4, but in the path, at turn1, I am on y=1, not 2,3,4.\n\nAt turn4, y=1, not 2,3,4.\n\nAt turn5, y=2, but T=5, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have a down action, which might not be necessary if I can stay.\n\nBut in this case, to avoid turn4, I need to go down or stay low.\n\nAnother way: since y=5 is safe, I could go directly to y=5 after turn4.\n\nBut in the path, I do.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path by skipping some levels when no cars, but I have to move step by step.\n\nI think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn for late collision.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nIn the path, I am at y=8 at turn11, T=11, not 12.\n\ny=7 at turn10, T=10, not 12.\n\nAnd at T=12, I am at y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSuppose I go slower between, but that would increase H.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, with t1=0.\n\nH=12 actions? Actions from t=0 to 11.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo actions for turn 0 to turn 11.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: D  (to go down to y=1 at turn3)\n\nBut turn2 action D, from y=2 to y=1 at turn3.\n\nThen turn3: S (stay at y=1 for turn4)\n\nThen turn4: U\n\nTurn5: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn11: U\n\nBut turn11: a11=U, to y=9 at turn12.\n\nNow, the actions: a0 to a11.\n\nBut at turn3, I used S, but I could use other.\n\nTo avoid down, I could have stayed at y=1 earlier.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn0: U, turn1 y=1\n\nThen a1: S, turn2 y=1\n\na2: S, turn3 y=1\n\na3: S, turn4 y=1\n\nThen a4: U, turn5 y=2\n\na5: U, turn6 y=3\n\na6: U, turn7 y=4\n\na7: U, turn8 y=5\n\na8: U, turn9 y=6\n\na9: U, turn10 y=7\n\na10: U, turn11 y=8\n\na11: U, turn12 y=9\n\nHere I used more S actions, but same H=12.\n\nIn the first sequence, I used one D and one S, here three S, but H same.\n\nBut in terms of minimal actions, both 12 actions.\n\nNow, in the first sequence, with down, it might be fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can have no down or less S.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at turn0: U, turn1 y=1\n\na1: U, turn2 y=2\n\na2: S, turn3 y=2  (stay at y=2 for turn3)\n\nThen at turn3, y=2, a3: D, to y=1 at turn4\n\nThen turn4 y=1\n\nThen same up.\n\nActions: a0=U, a1=U, a2=S, a3=D, a4=U, ..., a11=U\n\nStill, I have S and D.\n\nBut H=12.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure about the collision at turn1.\n\nIn all paths, at turn1, I am on y=1 or 0, not 2,3,4, so fine.\n\nNow, about freeway 3 and 4, same as 2.\n\nBut in the path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster through y=5,6 which are always safe.\n\nBut I have to go through y=2,3,4 at some point, but I can do it when no collision.\n\nFor example, after turn4, I go through y=2,3,4 at turns when no issue.\n\nIn the sequence above, I do.\n\nAt turn5 y=2, turn6 y=3, turn7 y=4, all after turn4, and no collision times for them except T=1 and4, which are past.\n\nT=1 and4 are before, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow for the sequence, I'll use the first one with down.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: D  (to go to y=1 at turn3)\n\nTurn 3: S  (stay at y=1 for turn4)\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAfter a11, at turn12, y=9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}  which is turn0: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t1+1}  turn1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +11: a_{t1+11}  turn11: U\n\nt1=0, so turns from 0 to 11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the actions clearly.\n\nAlso, I need to confirm the car on freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nBut all covered.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence without down action.\n\nFor example, start with S.\n\nTurn0: S, turn1 y=0\n\na1: U, turn2 y=1\n\na2: U, turn3 y=2? a2=U, from y=1 to y=2 at turn3.\n\nThen at turn3 y=2, a3: D to y=1 at turn4\n\nThen turn4 y=1\n\nThen a4: U, etc., same as before, but I started with S, so I have one more action or same? Turn0 S, so at turn1 y=0, then I need to go to y=1, etc., so I reach y=9 at turn12 still, but with different actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn0: S\n\nTurn1: U  (to y=1 at turn2? After a1=U, at turn2 y=1? Let's:\n\nTurn0: position y=0\n\na0=S, turn1 y=0\n\na1=U, turn2 y=1\n\na2=U, turn3 y=2\n\na3=D, turn4 y=1\n\na4=U, turn5 y=2\n\n...\n\na10=U, turn11 y=8? From turn4 y=1, a4=U turn5 y=2, a5=U turn6 y=3, ..., up to a10=U turn11 y=7? Let's count.\n\nAfter a4=U, turn5 y=2\n\na5=U, turn6 y=3\n\na6=U, turn7 y=4\n\na7=U, turn8 y=5\n\na8=U, turn9 y=6\n\na9=U, turn10 y=7\n\na10=U, turn11 y=8\n\na11=U, turn12 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut with a0=S, which is extra stay.\n\nIn the first sequence, I have a2=D and a3=S, which are not up, but similar.\n\nI think the first sequence is fine.\n\nTo have all U except for the avoid part.\n\nBut in the avoid, I need to adjust.\n\nSince at turn1, if I stay at y=1, I can avoid going to y=2 at turn1, but I did go to y=2 at turn2.\n\nIn the sequence, I can stay at y=1 for multiple turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn0: U, turn1 y=1\n\na1: S, turn2 y=1\n\na2: S, turn3 y=1\n\na3: S, turn4 y=1\n\nThen a4: U, a5:U, ..., a11:U, to turn12 y=9.\n\nHere actions: a0=U, a1=S, a2=S, a3=S, a4=U, a5=U, ..., a11=U.\n\nNo down, but three S.\n\nIn terms of moving, similar.\n\nBut I think for the answer, any is fine.\n\nI'll go with the first one with down.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 0: U  \nTurn 1: U  \nTurn 2: D  \nTurn 3: S  \nTurn 4: U  \nTurn 5: U  \nTurn 6: U  \nTurn 7: U  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \nTurn 11: U  \n}\n\nt1=0, so Turn t_1: U, which is turn0.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, H=12, so turns from 0 to 11.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This requires 12 actions from turn 0 to turn 11, resulting in the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 12.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by avoiding the collision points:\n- At turn 1, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) have collisions, so the player must not be on these freeways.\n- At turn 4, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) have collisions, so the player must not be on these freeways.\n- At turns 12, 13, and 14, freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have collisions, but since the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12, this is avoided.\n\nThe action sequence is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 2\\) by turn 2.\n- Move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3 to avoid being on \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 4.\n- Stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4 to avoid collision.\n- Move up continuously from turn 5 to turn 11 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12, avoiding the late collision times by not being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 12, 13, or 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=0}^{11}\\) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 0: U \\\\  \nTurn 1: U \\\\  \nTurn 2: D \\\\  \nTurn 3: S \\\\  \nTurn 4: U \\\\  \nTurn 5: U \\\\  \nTurn 6: U \\\\  \nTurn 7: U \\\\  \nTurn 8: U \\\\  \nTurn 9: U \\\\  \nTurn 10: U \\\\  \nTurn 11: U  \n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays, and cars move left or right with given speeds.\n\nFirst, understand the car positions and how they move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], where t1 is the current turn, which is 1.\n\nCurrent turn t1 = 1.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head 51, tail 40, direction right, speed 3. So at time T, span is [40 + 3(T-1), 51 + 3(T-1)]\n\n- Freeway 2: three cars. First: head -36, tail -47, right, speed 12. Span: [-47 + 12(T-1), -36 + 12(T-1)]\n\nSecond: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 12. Span: [-11 + 12(T-1), 0 + 12(T-1)] = [-11 + 12(T-1), 12(T-1)]\n\nThird: head 36, tail 25, right, speed 12. Span: [25 + 12(T-1), 36 + 12(T-1)]\n\n- Freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (54,43,right,6) → span [43 + 6(T-1), 54 + 6(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (54,43,right,6) yes.\n\nFreeway 7: (-44,-55,right,4) → span [-55 + 4(T-1), -44 + 4(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, the collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T. Meaning, the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, we care when the car's span includes 0.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But the collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, I think, based on the position before moving? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, you are at (0, y_T). Then you take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nBut the collision is at turn T, based on y_T and the car spans at time T.\n\nAlso, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} at time T, even if they cover 0 at time T, because you're not there yet.\n\nBut at time T, you are on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nSimilarly, at time T+1, you will be on y_{T+1}, so you care about cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe span is given for time T, which is the same as turn number, I think.\n\nTime is in turns, so T is turn number.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t1=1, position (0,1).\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, and y from 0 to 9, to go from y=1 to y=9, minimum turns is 8 if we always go up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since we want minimal H, probably we go up as much as possible, except when there's a car at x=0.\n\nH is the number of turns including the actions from t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, we reach turn t1+H-1 with y=9.\n\nStart at turn 1, position y=1.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 1, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 2, y could be 0,1,2.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 1+k, y position.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after that, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at turn t1=1, y1=1.\n\nSo we want y_{1 + H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 1+H, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 at turn 1+H.\n\nSince y starts at 1 and needs to be 9, the minimal H is at least 8, if we go up every step.\n\nBut we might need more if we have to avoid cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when it is safe to be on that y, meaning that at that turn, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, we need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 not in span at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeways with multiple cars, we need to check all.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving to a y at turn T, we need that at turn T, for that y, it is safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the set of turns T where 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, span at T: [40 + 3(T-1), 51 + 3(T-1)]\n\nSet 0 in [40 + 3(T-1), 51 + 3(T-1)]\n\nSo 40 + 3(T-1) ≤ 0 ≤ 51 + 3(T-1)\n\nLet u = T-1, so 40 + 3u ≤ 0 ≤ 51 + 3u\n\nFirst inequality: 40 + 3u ≤ 0 => 3u ≤ -40 => u ≤ -40/3 ≈ -13.333, so u ≤ -14 since u integer? T is turn, so u = T-1 integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nu = T-1, integer.\n\n40 + 3u ≤ 0 => 3u ≤ -40 => u ≤ -40/3 = -13.333, so u ≤ -14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 51 + 3u => 51 + 3u ≥ 0 => 3u ≥ -51 => u ≥ -17\n\nSo u ≥ -17 and u ≤ -14\n\nu ≤ -14 from first, u ≥ -17 from second.\n\nu ≥ -17 and u ≤ -14, so u = -17, -16, -15, -14\n\nThen T-1 = u, so T = u+1\n\nThus T = -16, -15, -14, -13\n\nBut turns start from 1, I assume, so for T ≥1, this never happens. T negative doesn't exist, so for all T≥1, 0 not in span for freeway 1. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: car (54,43,right,6), span [43 + 6(T-1), 54 + 6(T-1)]\n\nSet 0 in [43 + 6u, 54 + 6u] where u=T-1\n\n43 + 6u ≤ 0 ≤ 54 + 6u\n\nFirst: 43 + 6u ≤ 0 => 6u ≤ -43 => u ≤ -43/6 ≈ -7.166, so u ≤ -8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 54 + 6u => 6u ≥ -54 => u ≥ -9\n\nSo u ≥ -9 and u ≤ -8, u= -9,-8\n\nT-1 = u, T= u+1 = -8, -7\n\nAgain, T negative, not possible. So freeway 5 always safe.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: car (-44,-55,right,4) span [-55 + 4(T-1), -44 + 4(T-1)]\n\nSet 0 in [-55 + 4u, -44 + 4u] with u=T-1\n\n-55 + 4u ≤ 0 ≤ -44 + 4u\n\nFirst: -55 + 4u ≤ 0 => 4u ≤ 55 => u ≤ 55/4 = 13.75, so u ≤ 13\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -44 + 4u => 44 ≤ 4u => u ≥ 11\n\nSo u ≥ 11 and u ≤ 13, u=11,12,13\n\nT-1 = u, T=12,13,14\n\nT=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as 7, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeways 2,3,4 are identical, each with three cars.\n\nLet's take freeway 2.\n\nCars:\n\n1. (-36,-47,right,12) span [-47 + 12u, -36 + 12u] with u=T-1\n\n2. (0,-11,right,12) span [-11 + 12u, 0 + 12u] = [-11 + 12u, 12u]\n\n3.

Because freeway 4 unsafe at T=4.\n\nAt turn 4, if we are on y=4, freeway 4, and at T=4, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nTherefore, the direct path has a problem at turn 4.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway 4 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but freeway 4 is the one we hit.\n\nNow, at turn 3, if we are at y=3, we can choose to stay or go down or up.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince at turn 4, y=4 is unsafe, we can either not be on y=4 at turn 4, or delay being there.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, instead of going up to y=4, we could stay at y=3 or go down to y=2, but that might cost extra turns.\n\nSince the unsafe turn is only T=4 for y=4, we can be on y=4 at a different turn.\n\nFor instance, at turn 5, y=4 might be safe.\n\nLet's check freeway 4 at T=5.\n\nu=4\n\nFirst car: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], no\n\nThird car: [25+48,36+48]=[73,84], no\n\nSo safe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, T=3 safe, T=4 unsafe, T=5 safe.\n\nNow, for other freeways.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 4, we cannot be on y=4.\n\nSo one option: at turn 3, when at y=3, instead of going up to y=4 at turn 4, we stay at y=3 for turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4, we are at y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, unsafe at T=4? Freeway 3 has cars identical, so at T=4, also unsafe.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=4: u=3\n\nFirst car: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for all, so at T=4, freeway 3 is unsafe too.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 4, if we are on y=2,3, or4, all unsafe because freeways 2,3,4 are all unsafe at T=4.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 are different freeways, but each has the same car configuration, so each is unsafe at their own T=1 and T=4.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, if we are on y=k, we care about cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn T=4:\n\n- If on freeway 2, unsafe\n\n- If on freeway 3, unsafe\n\n- If on freeway 4, unsafe\n\n- Other freeways: freeway 1,5,6 safe, freeway 7,8 safe for now.\n\nBut at T=4, y=1,5,6,7,8 might be safe, but we are coming from below.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 4, to avoid collision, we must not be on freeway 2,3, or4 at that turn.\n\nSo possible positions: y=0,1,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are boundaries, but y=0 might be ok, but we need to go up.\n\nWe start from y=1 at turn1.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe states:\n\nFor each turn and each freeway, when it is unsafe.\n\nBut since freeways 2,3,4 are symmetric and unsafe at same times: T=1 and T=4.\n\nT=1 is turn1, but at turn1 we are on y=1, which is freeway1, safe, not affected.\n\nOnly T=4 is the problem turn for freeways 2,3,4.\n\nAt turn 4, being on y=2,3, or4 is unsafe.\n\nOther freeways safe at T=4.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe only at T=12,13,14, so at T=4 safe\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nDirect path: turn1 y=1, turn2 y=2, turn3 y=3, turn4 y=4 (but unsafe), so conflict.\n\nSo need to detour.\n\nOptions at turn3: from y=3, we can go down to y=2, but at turn4, if we are at y=2, freeway2 unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=3, freeway3 unsafe at turn4.\n\nOr go up to y=4, unsafe.\n\nAll bad at turn4.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=2,3,4 at turn4.\n\nTherefore, at turn4, we should be on y=1 or y=5 or above.\n\ny=5 is freeway5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn3.\n\nFrom turn3 y=3, if we go down to y=2, but at turn4 we would be at y=2, unsafe.\n\nBetter to go down earlier or stay.\n\nSince at turn4 we need to be away from y=2,3,4, we can plan to be at y=1 or y=5 at turn4.\n\nFor example, at turn3, instead of being at y=3, we could be at a different y.\n\nLet's think from the beginning.\n\nTurn1: start at y=1, must be there, safe. Action: we can go up, down, or stay. But to go to 9, up is better.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=2 at turn2.\n\nTurn1: y=1, safe. Action U, so to y=2 at turn2.\n\nTurn2: y=2, freeway2, at T=2, which is safe, as we computed earlier.\n\nNow at turn2, we can choose action for turn3.\n\nWe want to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at turn4.\n\nAt turn2, y=2, we can go up to y=3, or stay, or down to y=1.\n\nIf we go up to y=3 at turn3, then at turn3 y=3.\n\nThen at turn3, we need to decide for turn4.\n\nBut at turn4, we cannot be on y=3, so from y=3, we must go to y=2,3, or4, all unsafe at turn4.\n\nIf we go to y=2, at turn4 y=2 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=3, stay, unsafe.\n\nGo to y=4, unsafe.\n\nNo good.\n\nFrom turn2 y=2, instead of going up, we could stay at y=2 for turn3.\n\nThen turn3: y=2, freeway2 at T=3.\n\nT=3: u=2, freeway2: first car [-47+24, -36+24]=[-23,-12] no 0, second [ -11+24,24]=[13,24] no, third [49,60] no, so safe.\n\nThen at turn3 y=2, now we need to go to turn4.\n\nBut at turn4, we cannot be on y=2, so we must move away.\n\nOptions: go down to y=1, or go up to y=3, or stay but staying at y=2 is unsafe at turn4.\n\nSo from y=2 at turn3, we can:\n\n- Action D: go to y=1 at turn4\n\n- Action U: go to y=3 at turn4\n\nBut both y=1 and y=3 at turn4: y=1 is freeway1, safe; y=3 is freeway3, unsafe at T=4.\n\nSo only go to y=1 is safe at turn4.\n\nAction S: stay at y=2, but then at turn4 y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=1 at turn4.\n\nThen turn4: y=1, freeway1, safe.\n\nNow we are at y=1 at turn4, but we need to go to y=9, so we lost progress.\n\nThen from there, we can go up, but it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn5: from y=1, go up to y=2, but need to check safety.\n\nAt turn4, y=1, safe.\n\nAction for turn5: say U to y=2.\n\nTurn5: y=2, freeway2 at T=5.\n\nu=4, first car [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12] no 0, second [37,48] no, third [73,84] no, safe.\n\nThen turn6: from y=2, U to y=3.\n\nTurn6: y=3, freeway3 at T=6.\n\nu=5, first car [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24] no, second [-11+60,60]=[49,60] no, third [25+60,36+60]=[85,96] no, safe.\n\nTurn7: U to y=4.\n\nTurn7: y=4, freeway4 at T=7.\n\nu=6, first car [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36] no, second [-11+72,72]=[61,72] no, third [25+72,36+72]=[97,108] no, safe.\n\nThen continue: turn8: U to y=5, freeway5 safe.\n\nTurn9: U to y=6, freeway6 safe.\n\nTurn10: U to y=7, freeway7 at T=10.\n\nNow freeway7: car (-44,-55,right,4) span [-55+4u, -44+4u] with u=T-1\n\nAt T=10, u=9, span [-55+36, -44+36] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn11: U to y=8, freeway8 at T=11.\n\nu=10, span [-55+40, -44+40]=[-15,-4], no 0, safe.\n\nTurn12: U to y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, and we reach at turn12.\n\nBut earlier we were at turn4 y=1, then to turn12 y=9, that's 8 moves? Let's count turns.\n\nStart turn1 y=1.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nSequence: let's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn1: y=1, action? We need to specify actions.\n\nIn this path:\n\nTurn1: at y=1, action U, so to y=2 at turn2.\n\nTurn2: at y=2, action? Earlier I had at turn2, I considered going up or staying, but in this scenario, from turn2 y=2, I stayed or something.\n\nLet's trace:\n\nFrom above: after turn1 U to y=2 at turn2.\n\nTurn2: y=2, but to avoid problem at turn4, I need to not be on y=2,3,4 at turn4.\n\nSo at turn2, from y=2, I could go down to y=1 at turn3.\n\nThen turn3: y=1\n\nThen turn3: at y=1, I can go up to y=2 at turn4? But at turn4, if I go to y=2, unsafe.\n\ny=1 at turn3: freeway1 safe.\n\nThen action for turn4: I can go to y=0, y=1, or y=2.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 safe, y=2 unsafe at turn4.\n\nSo from y=1 at turn3, I can go down to y=0 or stay at y=1 or go up to y=2 but unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, go down to y=0 or stay at y=1.\n\nBut staying at y=1 doesn't help progress.\n\nGo down to y=0.\n\nThen turn4: at y=0, safe, since no freeway.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut let's see the path I thought earlier where I went to y=1 at turn4.\n\nIn the first alternative:\n\nTurn1: y=1, action U, to y=2 turn2\n\nTurn2: y=2, action D? Or what.\n\nTo be at y=1 at turn4.\n\nAt turn2 y=2, I can go down to y=1 at turn3.\n\nThen turn3: y=1, action for turn4: if I go down to y=0 or stay at y=1.\n\nSay stay at y=1 for turn4.\n\nThen turn4: y=1, safe.\n\nThen turn4: at y=1, action U to y=2 turn5.\n\nTurn5: y=2, safe as before (T=5)\n\nThen turn5: action U to y=3 turn6\n\nTurn6: y=3, freeway3 at T=6, safe.\n\nTurn6: action U to y=4 turn7\n\nTurn7: y=4, freeway4 at T=7, safe.\n\nTurn7: action U to y=5 turn8\n\nTurn8: y=5, freeway5 safe\n\nTurn8: action U to y=6 turn9\n\nTurn9: y=6, freeway6 safe\n\nTurn9: action U to y=7 turn10\n\nTurn10: y=7, freeway7 at T=10, u=9, span [-55+36, -44+36]=[-19,-8] no 0, safe\n\nTurn10: action U to y=8 turn11\n\nTurn11: y=8, freeway8 at T=11, u=10, span [-55+40, -44+40]=[-15,-4] no 0, safe\n\nTurn11: action U to y=9 turn12\n\nTurn12: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, number of actions: from turn1 to turn11, actions a1 to a11, and at turn12 y=9.\n\nSo H=11 actions? Let's see: actions from t1 to t1+H-1, with y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=1, y_{1+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 1+H, y=9.\n\nHere, from turn1 to turn12, we have 11 actions: a1 to a11.\n\ny12=9.\n\nMinimal possible is 8 actions to turn9, but here 11, which is more.\n\nBut we can do better by not going down.\n\nAnother idea: at turn4, be on a different y.\n\nFor example, be on y=5 at turn4.\n\ny=5 is freeway5, always safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=5 by turn4.\n\nStart y=1 turn1.\n\nTo be at y=5 at turn4, we need to increase y by 4 in 3 actions (from turn1 to turn4, 3 actions?).\n\nAt turn1, after action, turn2 position.\n\nPosition at turn T is before action, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then take action a_T, to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo to have y_4 =5, for example.\n\ny1=1\n\nThen after a1, y2 = y1 + Δa1\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δa2\n\nAfter a3, y4 = y3 + Δa3\n\nWe want y4=5.\n\ny1=1, so need net +4 from y2,y3,y4 changes, but y4 depends on actions.\n\ny2 = y1 + Δa1\n\ny3 = y2 + Δa2 = y1 + Δa1 + Δa2\n\ny4 = y3 + Δa3 = y1 + Δa1 + Δa2 + Δa3\n\nSet y4=5, y1=1, so Δa1 + Δa2 + Δa3 = 4\n\nEach Δa is -1,0,1, so possible, e.g., all U, but y2=2, y3=3, y4=4, but y4=4 at turn4 unsafe.\n\nOr U,U,U but that gives y4=4.\n\nTo get y4=5, need to go up faster, but we can only go up one per turn, so impossible to have y4=5.\n\nMax y4: start y1=1, after one action y2<=2, after two y3<=3, after three y4<=4, so y4 max 4, cannot be 5 at turn4.\n\nSimilarly, min y4=1-3=-2, but y>=0, so possible y4=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nCannot be y=5 at turn4.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at turn4 is possible, as before.\n\ny=0 at turn4 possible.\n\nBut y=5 not possible.\n\nSo at turn4, we can only be on y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAnd y=2,3,4 unsafe, so only safe options are y=0 or y=1.\n\nAs in the previous path, we went to y=1 at turn4.\n\nBut that cost extra turns.\n\nCan we be on y=5 earlier? No.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 2,3,4 are unsafe only at T=4, but safe at other times, we can delay going through them.\n\nFor example, stay at lower y until after turn4.\n\nStart at turn1 y=1.\n\nInstead of going up, we can stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nTurn1: y=1, action S, stay at y=1 for turn2.\n\nTurn2: y=1, now at T=2, freeway1 safe.\n\nThen action for turn3: can go up to y=2.\n\nTurn3: y=2, at T=3, freeway2 safe? T=3, freeway2: as before, safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at turn3, we need to go to turn4.\n\nBut at turn4, cannot be on y=2, so go down to y=1 or up to y=3, but y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo go down to y=1 at turn4.\n\nTurn4: y=1, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nFrom turn3 y=2, go up to y=3 at turn4, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo seems we have to spend turn4 at y=0 or y=1.\n\nThen from there go up, reaching y=9 at turn12 as before.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, after turn4, we can go up faster.\n\nIn the path, from turn4 y=1, we went up each turn to y=2 turn5, y=3 turn6, y=4 turn7, y=5 turn8, y=6 turn9, y=7 turn10, y=8 turn11, y=9 turn12.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, from turn7 to turn12, 5 turns? Turn7 y=4, turn8 y=5, turn9 y=6, turn10 y=7, turn11 y=8, turn12 y=9, that's 5 actions, 6 turns? Positions: turn7 y=4, after a7 U, turn8 y=5; a8 U, turn9 y=6; a9 U, turn10 y=7; a10 U, turn11 y=8; a11 U, turn12 y=9. So from turn7 to turn12, 5 actions.\n\nBut turn4 y=1, then turn5 y=2, turn6 y=3, turn7 y=4, so from turn4 to turn7 is 3 actions to go from y=1 to y=4.\n\ny4=1, y5=2, y6=3, y7=4.\n\nThen to y9 at turn12.\n\nTotal turns from start: turn1 to turn12, 12 turns, with 11 actions.\n\nBut minimal is 8, so 11 is 3 extra turns.\n\nWe can reduce by not going to y=1 at turn4, but we have to be at y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 might be faster to go up? No, same as y=1.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 before turn4, but impossible.\n\nOr, since freeway 7 and 8 have unsafe later, but we can avoid that by being there earlier or later.\n\nBut since we reach before T=12, not issue.\n\nBut in this case, with the detour, we reach at turn12.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to higher y faster after the danger turn.\n\nBut from turn4, we are at low y.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y at turn4.\n\nBut we can't, max y=4.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe.\n\nPerhaps at turn3, we are not at y=3.\n\nFor example, start turn1 y=1, action U to y=2 turn2.\n\nThen at turn2 y=2, instead of going to y=3, we go down to y=1 at turn3.\n\nThen turn3 y=1, then for turn4, we can go to y=0 or y=1 or y=2.\n\ny=2 unsafe, so go to y=0 or y=1.\n\nSay go to y=0 at turn4.\n\nTurn4 y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nTurn4: at y=0, action U to y=1 turn5.\n\nTurn5 y=1, freeway1 safe.\n\nAction U to y=2 turn6.\n\nTurn6 y=2, freeway2 at T=6, safe as before.\n\nThen U to y=3 turn7, y=3 at T=7 safe, etc.\n\nBut now we reach later: turn5 y=1, turn6 y=2, turn7 y=3, turn8 y=4, turn9 y=5, turn10 y=6, turn11 y=7, turn12 y=8, turn13 y=9. Worse, turn13.\n\nFrom turn4 y=0, to turn5 y=1, turn6 y=2, ..., up to turn12 y=8, turn13 y=9. Yes, worse.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at turn4 than y=0.\n\nIn the first path, with turn4 at y=1, then turn12 at y=9.\n\nBut can we save a turn somewhere?\n\nFor example, after turn4, instead of going step by step, but we have to, since we can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless we can skip some freeway, but no, we have to go through each y.\n\nAnother thought: at turn3, from y=2 (if we are at y=2 turn3), we could go up to y=3, but then at turn4 y=3 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps start by going down to y=0 at some point, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, since freeways 5 and 6 are always safe, and we can be on them, but to reach them, we need to go through 2,3,4.\n\nBut at turn4, if we can be on y=5, impossible.\n\nUnless we are already at higher y before turn4, but we start from low.\n\nMinimal time is at least 8, but with the constraint at turn4, we have to spend turn4 at safe y, which is y=1 or y=0, then from there to y=9 takes 8 more turns? From y=1 to y=9, min 8 actions to turn9, but we are at turn4 y=1, so to turn12 y=9, that's 8 actions from turn4 to turn12, but turn4 to turn12 is 8 turns, 8 actions? Positions: turn4 y=1, after 8 actions, at turn12 y=9, yes.\n\nBut from turn1 to turn4, we have actions to get to y=1 at turn4.\n\nIn the path, turn1 y=1, action U to y=2 turn2; turn2 action D to y=1 turn3; turn3 action S to y=1 turn4? Or action D to y=0, but we did action S to stay at y=1 for turn4.\n\nLet's list the actions clearly.\n\nIn the first path:\n\n- Turn1: at y=1, action U → y2=2\n\n- Turn2: at y=2, action D → y3=1  (go down to y=1 for turn3)\n\n- Turn3: at y=1, action S → y4=1  (stay for turn4)\n\nThen:\n\n- Turn4: at y=1, action U → y5=2\n\n- Turn5: at y=2, action U → y6=3\n\n- Turn6: at y=3, action U → y7=4\n\n- Turn7: at y=4, action U → y8=5\n\n- Turn8: at y=5, action U → y9=6\n\n- Turn9: at y=6, action U → y10=7\n\n- Turn10: at y=7, action U → y11=8\n\n- Turn11: at y=8, action U → y12=9\n\nSo at turn12, y=9.\n\nActions from turn1 to turn11, 11 actions.\n\nH=11, since y_{1+H} = y12=9, so 1+H=12, H=11.\n\nBut we can reduce the actions before turn4.\n\nFor example, at turn2, instead of going down, we can stay at y=2 for turn3, then from there go down to y=1 for turn4.\n\nTurn1: action U → y2=2\n\nTurn2: at y=2, action S → y3=2  (stay at y=2 for turn3)\n\nTurn3: at y=2, action D → y4=1  (go down to y=1 for turn4)\n\nThen turn4: y=1, same as before.\n\nThen from turn4, same actions to go up.\n\nBut now at turn3, we are at y=2 instead of y=1, so we lost a bit, but in terms of time, same: turn3 y=2, then turn4 y=1, then turn5 y=2, etc., so from turn4 y=1 to turn12 y=9, same as before.\n\nIn this case, turn3 y=2, then turn4 y=1, turn5 y=2, so we visited y=2 twice, but time same.\n\nIn the first, turn3 y=1, turn4 y=1, turn5 y=2.\n\nHere turn3 y=2, turn4 y=1, turn5 y=2, so y=2 at turn3 and turn5, but turn5 is later, so no gain.\n\nFrom turn4 y=1, we go directly to y=2 at turn5, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, after turn4, when we go up, at turn7 y=4, but we can be at y=4 earlier? No, because from turn4 y=1, min to y=4 is turn7.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: at turn1, instead of going up, we go down to y=0, but that seems worse.\n\nOr stay at y=1 for multiple turns.\n\nBut that delays.\n\nFor example, stay at y=1 until after turn4.\n\nTurn1: action S → y2=1\n\nTurn2: action S → y3=1\n\nTurn3: action S → y4=1  (at turn4 y=1 safe)\n\nThen turn4: action U → y5=2\n\nThen same as before, turn5 y=2, turn6 y=3, turn7 y=4, turn8 y=5, ..., turn12 y=9? Turn4 y=1, turn5 y=2, turn6 y=3, turn7 y=4, turn8 y=5, turn9 y=6, turn10 y=7, turn11 y=8, turn12 y=9.\n\nSame as before, 11 actions to turn12.\n\nBut in this case, we stayed at y=1 for turns 2,3,4, but we started at turn1 y=1, so actions: turn1 S to y2=1, turn2 S to y3=1, turn3 S to y4=1, turn4 U to y5=2, etc., to turn11 U to y12=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nIn the first path, we went to y=2 at turn2, then back to y=1 at turn3, then stay at turn4.\n\nBut that also has 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 at turn3, but then at turn4 we have to move, but to where? y=2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid losing turns around turn4.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11, with y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=4 at turn4, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nOr, be on y=4 at turn3 or turn5.\n\nAt turn3, if we are at y=4, how? From y=1 at turn1, to y=4 at turn3: y1=1, a1 U to y2=2, a2 U to y3=3, max y3=3, cannot be y=4 at turn3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn5, y=4 possible.\n\nBut at turn4, we need to be safe.\n\nAnother thought: the collision only happens if we are on the freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nBut at turn4, for y=4, it is unsafe, but if we are not on y=4 at turn4, ok.\n\nBut to reach y=5, we need to be on y=4 at some point, but at turn4 it is unsafe, but at other times safe.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=4 at turn4, unsafe.\n\nBut we can be on y=4 at turn5, for example.\n\nIn the path I have, we are on y=4 at turn7, which is safe.\n\nBut can we be on y=4 earlier?\n\nFor example, after turn4, from y=1 at turn4, we go up: turn4 U to y5=2, turn5 U to y6=3, turn6 U to y7=4, so turn7 y=4.\n\nBut if we could be at higher y at turn4, we can't.\n\nSuppose at turn3, we are at y=3, then at turn3, we go down to y=2 at turn4, but y=2 unsafe at turn4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr go up to y=4 at turn4, unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, it is unsafe only at T=4, but at T=3 or T=5 safe, so if we can be on y=4 at T=3 or T=5.\n\nAt T=3, we can be on y=4? No, as above.\n\nAt T=3, max y=3.\n\nSo we can only be on y=4 from T=4 onwards.\n\nBut at T=4, unsafe, so we must be on y=4 at T>=5.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=4 is turn5.\n\nThen from there to y=9 min 5 actions to turn10.\n\ny5=4, then y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9, so turn10 y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=4 at turn5.\n\ny1=1, to y5=4.\n\nNeed y5=4.\n\ny1=1, then actions a1 to a4 to reach y5.\n\ny5 = y1 + Δa1 + Δa2 + Δa3 + Δa4\n\nSet y5=4, y1=1, so Δa1 + Δa2 + Δa3 + Δa4 =3\n\nEach Δa <=1, so possible, e.g., U,U,U,S or U,U,S,U, etc., so that y2=2, y3=3, y4=3 or 4, but y4<=4.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe positions.\n\nSpecifically, at turn4, we need y4 not 2,3,4.\n\nSo y4 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns, we need safe.\n\nNow, to have y5=4.\n\nSince y4 must be 0 or 1, and y5=4, that means from y4 to y5, we must have Δa4 = +3? No, Δa4 can only be -1,0,1, so from y4 to y5, y5 = y4 + Δa4, so if y4=0 or 1, y5 <=2 or 3, cannot be 4.\n\nExactly.\n\nIf y4=0, y5 <=1\n\ny4=1, y5<=2\n\ny4=2,3,4 not allowed at turn4.\n\nSo y5 cannot be 4 if y4 is 0 or 1.\n\ny5 max is 2 if y4=1.\n\nFor example, y4=1, then y5 = y4 + Δa4 <=1+1=2\n\nSimilarly, if y4=0, y5<=1.\n\nSo at turn5, y5 <=2 if we are safe at turn4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have y5=4; the earliest we can have y=4 is turn7, as in the path.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can have y=9 at turn11.\n\ny_{1+H}=9, at turn11.\n\nThen H=10 actions.\n\nIs it possible?\n\ny1=1, after 10 actions, y11=9.\n\nNet change +8, so possible.\n\nBut with the constraint at turn4.\n\ny4 must be 0 or 1.\n\nThen y5 <= y4 +1 <=2\n\ny6 <= y5 +1 <=3\n\ny7 <= y6 +1 <=4\n\ny8 <= y7 +1 <=5\n\ny9 <= y8 +1 <=6\n\ny10 <= y9 +1 <=7\n\ny11 <= y10 +1 <=8\n\nBut we need y11=9, but y11 <=8, contradiction.\n\ny11 <=8 if y4=1, or less.\n\nIf y4=1, y5<=2, y6<=3, y7<=4, y8<=5, y9<=6, y10<=7, y11<=8 <9, impossible to have y11=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y4=0, y5<=1, y6<=2, ..., y11<=7<9.\n\nSo indeed, impossible to reach y=9 before turn12.\n\nThus minimal is turn12 with y12=9, H=11 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions from turn1 onwards.\n\nIn the path, we have several options.\n\nFor example, one way:\n\n- Turn1: action U to go to y=2 at turn2\n\n- Turn2: action D to go to y=1 at turn3\n\n- Turn3: action S to stay at y=1 for turn4\n\n- Turn4: action U to go to y=2 at turn5\n\n- Turn5: action U to go to y=3 at turn6\n\n- Turn6: action U to go to y=4 at turn7\n\n- Turn7: action U to go to y=5 at turn8\n\n- Turn8: action U to go to y=6 at turn9\n\n- Turn9: action U to go to y=7 at turn10\n\n- Turn10: action U to go to y=8 at turn11\n\n- Turn11: action U to go to y=9 at turn12\n\nIn this, at turn3, action S to stay at y=1.\n\nWe could at turn3 go down to y=0, but that would make it slower.\n\nOr, as I thought earlier, at turn2 stay at y=2, then turn3 go down to y=1 for turn4.\n\nBut in terms of actions, similar.\n\nNow, in this sequence, we need to make sure all positions are safe.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nTurn1: y=1, freeway1, safe.\n\nAfter action U, to turn2 y=2.\n\nTurn2: y=2, freeway2 at T=2, safe as computed.\n\nAction D, to turn3 y=1.\n\nTurn3: y=1, freeway1 at T=3, always safe.\n\nAction S, to turn4 y=1.\n\nTurn4: y=1, freeway1 at T=4, safe.\n\nAction U, to turn5 y=2.\n\nTurn5: y=2, freeway2 at T=5, u=4, span [1,12], [37,48], [73,84], no 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to turn6 y=3.\n\nTurn6: y=3, freeway3 at T=6, u=5, first car [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24], second [-11+60,60]=[49,60], third [25+60,36+60]=[85,96], no 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to turn7 y=4.\n\nTurn7: y=4, freeway4 at T=7, u=6, first [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36], second [-11+72,72]=[61,72], third [25+72,36+72]=[97,108], no 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to turn8 y=5.\n\nTurn8: y=5, freeway5, always safe.\n\nAction U, to turn9 y=6.\n\nTurn9: y=6, freeway6, always safe.\n\nAction U, to turn10 y=7.\n\nTurn10: y=7, freeway7 at T=10, u=9, span [-55+36, -44+36]=[-19,-8], no 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to turn11 y=8.\n\nTurn11: y=8, freeway8 at T=11, u=10, span [-55+40, -44+40]=[-15,-4], no 0, safe.\n\nAction U, to turn12 y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe can have a different sequence where we don't go down at turn2.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn1: action S, stay at y=1 for turn2\n\nTurn2: action S, stay at y=1 for turn3\n\nTurn3: action S, stay at y=1 for turn4\n\nTurn4: action U, to y=2 turn5\n\nThen same as above from turn5.\n\nBut this has more stays, but same number of actions to reach y=9 at turn12.\n\nIn this case, turn1 to turn4 all at y=1, then up.\n\nBut at turn4 y=1, then turn5 y=2, ..., turn12 y=9, same.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions: turn1 S, turn2 S, turn3 S, turn4 U, turn5 U, ..., turn11 U to y12=9.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we moved more but same time.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions starting from turn1.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1 (which is 1): U\n\nTurn t1 +1 (2): D\n\nTurn t1 +2 (3): S\n\nTurn t1 +3 (4): U\n\nTurn t1 +4 (5): U\n\nTurn t1 +5 (6): U\n\nTurn t1 +6 (7): U\n\nTurn t1 +7 (8): U\n\nTurn t1 +8 (9): U\n\nTurn t1 +9 (10): U\n\nTurn t1 +10 (11): U\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t1} = a1\n\nt=1: a2\n\n...\n\nt=10: a11\n\nIn the box, we write Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=11, so from turn1 to turn11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, a1=U, a2=D, a3=S, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U\n\nWe can have a sequence without down, but with stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn1: S\n\nTurn2: S\n\nTurn3: S  (to stay at y=1 for turns 2,3,4)\n\nTurn4: U  (to y=2 turn5)\n\nTurn5: U  (to y=3 turn6)\n\nBut at turn5 y=2, then turn6 y=3, but we need to go to y=4 at some point.\n\nFrom turn4: U to y=2 turn5\n\nThen turn5: U to y=3 turn6\n\nTurn6: U to y=4 turn7\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut in this, actions: turn1 S, turn2 S, turn3 S, turn4 U, turn5 U, turn6 U, turn7 U, turn8 U, turn9 U, turn10 U, turn11 U\n\na1 to a11: S,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut with three S at beginning.\n\nIn the first sequence, we have U,D,S at start.\n\nBut both have 11 actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nIn the car states, freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but we passed them at T=10 and 11, which is before T=12, so safe.\n\nAlso, freeway 1,5,6 always safe.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=11 but different actions.\n\nBut I think it's acceptable.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be in a box.\n\nBut we need to specify the minimal H, but in the sequence, H=11.\n\nIn the task, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the answer, we output the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a sequence with H=10? We saw impossible.\n\nH=11 is minimal.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, at turn1, we are at y=1, and freeway1 safe, but we took action U, but we could take other actions, but going up is better.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence of actions.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring that at each turn, the player is not on a freeway where a car covers \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 4, freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). To avoid this, the player must be at \\(y = 1\\) (safe) or \\(y = 0\\) at turn 4. The sequence positions the player at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4.\n- After turn 4, the player moves up incrementally to \\(y = 9\\), reaching it at turn 12.\n- All positions during the sequence are safe:\n  - Turn 1: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 always safe.\n  - Turn 2: \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2 safe at \\(T=2\\).\n  - Turn 3: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 always safe.\n  - Turn 4: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 always safe.\n  - Turn 5: \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2 safe at \\(T=5\\).\n  - Turn 6: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 safe at \\(T=6\\).\n  - Turn 7: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 safe at \\(T=7\\).\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 always safe.\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 always safe.\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 safe at \\(T=10\\) (span \\([-19, -8]\\), no 0).\n  - Turn 11: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 safe at \\(T=11\\) (span \\([-15, -4]\\), no 0).\n  - Turn 12: \\(y = 9\\), no freeway, safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{10}\\) (for \\(t\\) from 0 to \\(H-1 = 10\\)) is:\n\n- \\(a_1 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=2\\) at turn 2)\n- \\(a_2 = D\\) (move down to \\(y=1\\) at turn 3)\n- \\(a_3 = S\\) (stay at \\(y=1\\) for turn 4)\n- \\(a_4 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=2\\) at turn 5)\n- \\(a_5 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=3\\) at turn 6)\n- \\(a_6 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=4\\) at turn 7)\n- \\(a_7 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=5\\) at turn 8)\n- \\(a_8 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=6\\) at turn 9)\n- \\(a_9 = U\\) (move up to \\(y=7\\) at turn 10)\n- \\(a_{10} = U\\) (move up to \\(y=8\\) at turn 11)\n- \\(a_{11} = U\\) (move up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 12)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 2, and the player is at (0,2). We wish to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: The grid has vertical positions y=0 to y=9. The player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). The player must avoid being at a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T if at that turn T, the x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nNote: The collision condition is only checked at the exact turn T: if at turn T, the player is on freeway k (which is y=k), then we check if x=0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at that turn T.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is at y at turn T and then moves to y+1 at turn T+1. So at turn T, the player is still on the old row. Therefore, when moving, the new row is only occupied at the next turn.\n\nCar movement:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- If left-moving (d='left'): at turn T (>=t1), the car's head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1). The span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (note: since it's left, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem states: left-moving: span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)]. So if the car is moving left, then at time T, the car covers [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? But note: if the car is moving left, the head (front) is at the leftmost? Actually, the problem defines for left-moving: at t1, the span is [h, tau] and then at T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that h is the right end and tau is the left end? Because as the car moves left, both h and tau decrease.\n\nBut note the example for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So in the initial state, tau is the left end and h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the initial span is [h, tau] meaning h is the left end? Actually, the problem says: left-moving: span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that h is the right end and tau is the left end? Because if the car moves left, the entire segment shifts left. So to be consistent, in the initial state for a left-moving car, the head (front) is at h (which is the leftmost) and tail at tau (the rightmost)? That doesn't match because if the car moves left, the front (head) should be leading to the left. Alternatively, the problem might define the span as [min, max] regardless? But the right-moving example uses [tau, h] and then both increase, meaning tau is the left and h is the right.\n\nSo to clarify:\n- Right-moving: at t1, the car covers [tau, h] (with tau < h) and at time T, it covers [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n- Left-moving: at t1, the car covers [h, tau] (but note: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left, so h should be the leftmost and tau the rightmost? Then the span would be [h, tau] with h<tau? But the problem says [h, tau] and then both decrease. So if h is the leftmost and tau the rightmost, then as the car moves left, the entire segment moves left, so the leftmost becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the rightmost becomes tau - s*(T-t1). But the problem writes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and if h<tau, then this interval is [h', tau'] with h'<tau'. However, the problem does not specify the order of h and tau. Looking at the given data:\n\nIn the current state, for freeway 1: (54,43,right,3) -> but if right, the span should be [tau, h] and tau should be less than h? But here 54 and 43: 54>43, so if it's right, then the head is 54 and tail is 43? But the problem says for right: [tau, h] and then becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So if we have (54,43,right,3) and if the span is [43,54] at t1? But the problem writes the car as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right, head is the rightmost? Then the head should be 54 and tail 43, and the span is [43,54]. Similarly, for left, the head is the leftmost? But the problem doesn't have any left-moving cars in this instance.\n\nLooking at the given cars, all are right-moving? Actually, the direction is all 'right'. So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nTherefore, for every car, the span at time t1 (which is turn 2) is [tau, head] with tau <= head. Then at turn T (>=2), the span becomes [tau + s*(T-2), head + s*(T-2)].\n\nCollision: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (y=k) and if the x=0 is in any car's span on freeway k at that turn T, then collision.\n\nWe start at (0,2) at turn 2. Our goal is to get to (0,9). We can only move vertically.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 2. We wish to go to y=9. The minimal moves without any cars would be 7 moves of 'U' (since 2+7=9). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe note that the player is at freeway y only when y is between 1 and 8. The start y=2 is a freeway, and the goal y=9 is not (it's the top, above the freeways). Therefore, we must avoid being on freeways 1 to 8 at any turn when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nSince we start at freeway 2 at turn 2, we must check if at turn 2, freeway 2 has a car that covers x=0.\n\nLet's check the cars on freeway 2 at turn 2:\n\nFreeway 2 has three cars:\n1. (-24, -35, right, 12) -> at turn 2: span = [-35, -24]? Wait, no: for right-moving, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). The problem says: for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] at t1? But in the table, the car is written as (head, tail, ...). So for the first car: head=-24, tail=-35? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. Similarly, the second car: (12,1,right,12) -> [1,12]. The third: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48].\n\nSo at turn 2, freeway 2 has cars: [-35,-24], [1,12], [37,48]. None of these cover 0? 0 is not in [-35,-24] (which is negative), not in [1,12] (1 to 12, 0 is below 1), and not in [37,48]. So we are safe at turn 2.\n\nNow, we plan the moves. We want to go from y=2 to y=9. We can use a sequence of U, D, S. We want minimal H.\n\nSince we are at y=2 and we wish to get to y=9, we need at least 7 moves of U. However, we might have to wait (S) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we will be on at each turn.\n\nWe can simulate turn by turn. We are at turn 2 at y=2.\n\nOur actions start at turn 2: we choose a_{2}. Then at turn 3, we are at y3 = y2 + delta, and so on.\n\nWe wish to minimize the number of turns. We'll try to go up as fast as possible, but if we see a collision, we might have to wait or even move down (but moving down might not be helpful since we are at 2 and we want to go to 9).\n\nLet me denote the turn index: we start at turn 2.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- On freeway 1: y=1\n- On freeway 2: y=2\n- ...\n- On freeway 8: y=8\n\nWe are currently at y=2 (freeway 2) at turn 2. We are safe at turn 2.\n\nNow, we can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe want to go to 9, so moving down to 1 is possible but then we have to go up again. Similarly, staying at 2 might be necessary to avoid a future collision.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we might be on at future turns whether a car will be at x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nFirst, note the current turn is t1=2. For a turn T (>=2), the car on freeway k at turn T is at:\n\nFor a car with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, t, d, s) at turn 2, at turn T (T>=2):\n\nThe car spans [t + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)] because it's right-moving.\n\nWe must check if 0 is in that interval for the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns. We'll try to go up as much as possible until we hit a danger, then we might have to wait.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 2 (safe).\n\nTurn 2: we can choose U, then at turn 3 we are at y=3 (freeway 3). Or we can choose S (stay at 2 for turn 3) or D (go to 1 at turn 3).\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we prefer to go up. However, we must check freeway 3 at turn 3.\n\nCheck freeway 3 at turn 3:\n\nFreeway 3 has the same cars as freeway 2? Actually, the table says:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n| 1 | (54,43,right,3) |\n| 2 | (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12) |\n| 3 | same as 2? It says: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12) |\n| 4 | same as 2? |\n| 5 | (60,49,right,6) |\n| 6 | same as 5? |\n| 7 | (-40,-51,right,4) |\n| 8 | same as 7? |\n\nWait, the table says for freeway 3: same as freeway 2? So three cars: \n1. (head=-24, tail=-35, right,12) -> span at turn 3: \n   T=3, so time passed = 1. \n   span = [ -35 + 12*1, -24 + 12*1 ] = [-23, -12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n2. (12,1,right,12): [1+12, 12+12] = [13,24] -> doesn't cover 0.\n3. (48,37,right,12): [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 3 at turn 3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 at turn 4? But we are not there yet.\n\nWe are planning:\n\nTurn 2: U -> then at turn 3, we are at y=3.\n\nNow at turn 3, we are at freeway 3. We check: safe as above.\n\nThen we can do U again at turn 3: then at turn 4, we are at y=4.\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 4:\n\nFreeway 4 has the same cars as freeway 2? The table says: same as 2 and 3? So the same three cars.\n\nAt turn 4: time passed = 2.\n1. [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> this covers 0? -11 to 0: 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is [a,b] and if a<=0<=b, then 0 is included.\n\nSo at turn 4, freeway 4: the first car covers [-11,0]. Therefore, if we are at freeway 4 at turn 4, we collide.\n\nSo if we go U at turn 2 and U at turn 3, then at turn 4 we are at y=4 -> and we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway 4 at turn 4.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway 4 at turn 4.\n\nHow can we avoid? We can:\n\nOption 1: At turn 3 (when we are at y=3) we do not move up to 4 at turn 4. Instead, we can stay at 3 (so at turn 4 we are still at 3) or move down to 2.\n\nBut if we stay at 3 at turn 4, then we are at freeway 3 at turn 4. Check freeway 3 at turn 4:\n\nAt turn 4, freeway 3: same cars? \n1. [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? Then we collide at freeway 3 at turn 4? \n\nBut wait, freeway 3 at turn 4: the car that was on freeway 3 at turn 2 is the same as freeway 4? No, the cars are per freeway. The table says freeway 3 has the same set of cars as freeway 2? But they are on different freeways. So at turn 4, freeway 3 has:\n\nCar1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? Then if we are at freeway 3 at turn 4, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we move down to 2 at turn 4, then we are at freeway 2 at turn 4. Check freeway 2 at turn 4:\n\nCar1: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? Then we collide.\n\nSo at turn 4, no matter if we are at freeway 2,3,4 we have a car that covers 0? \n\nBut wait, let me check each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 at turn 4: only one car (54,43,right,3). At turn 4: time passed=2, so [43+3*2, 54+3*2] = [43+6,54+6] = [49,60] -> no.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars: \n1. [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n2. [1+24,12+24] = [25,36] -> no.\n3. [37+24,48+24] = [61,72] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 2: the first car covers 0 at turn 4.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? The table says freeway 3 has the same cars? Then same: first car covers 0.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars? Then same: first car covers 0.\n\nFreeway 5: (60,49,right,6) -> at turn 4: [49+6*2, 60+6*2] = [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> no.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? Then [61,72] -> no.\n\nFreeway 7: (-40,-51,right,4) -> at turn 4: [-51+4*2, -40+4*2] = [-51+8, -40+8] = [-43,-32] -> no.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? Then same.\n\nSo at turn 4, freeways 2,3,4 are dangerous (have a car covering 0). Freeways 1,5,6,7,8 are safe.\n\nBut we are currently at turn 2 at y=2. We are going to be at y=3 at turn 3 (if we go up at turn 2). Then at turn 3, we must avoid being at freeway 4 at turn 4? But we see that freeway 3 at turn 4 is also dangerous. So if we are at freeway 3 at turn 3, we cannot stay there for turn 4? Because then we'd be at freeway 3 at turn 4 and collide.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot move down to freeway 2 at turn 4 because freeway 2 is dangerous at turn 4.\n\nSo at turn 3, we must move to a freeway that is safe at turn 4. The safe freeways at turn 4 are 1,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut from freeway 3 (at turn 3), we can only move to:\n\n- U: to freeway 4 (which is dangerous at turn 4) -> collide.\n- D: to freeway 2 (dangerous at turn 4) -> collide.\n- S: stay at freeway 3 (dangerous at turn 4) -> collide.\n\nSo no matter what we do at turn 3, we end up in a freeway that is dangerous at turn 4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway 3 at turn 3? Then we must avoid getting to freeway 3 at turn 3.\n\nBut we are at freeway 2 at turn 2. We haven't moved yet. We can choose at turn 2 not to go up to 3, but to stay at 2 or go down to 1.\n\nBut at turn 2, we are at freeway 2 and it's safe. Then at turn 3, if we stay at 2, we are at freeway 2 at turn 3. Check freeway 2 at turn 3:\n\nAt turn 3: time passed=1.\nCar1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> no.\nCar2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> no.\nCar3: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 2 at turn 3 is safe.\n\nBut then at turn 4, freeway 2 becomes dangerous. So at turn 3, we must leave freeway 2 to avoid being there at turn 4? But we can only move to freeway 1 or 3.\n\nIf we move to freeway 3 at turn 4? Then at turn 4, freeway 3 is dangerous -> collide.\n\nIf we move to freeway 1 at turn 4? Then we are at freeway 1 at turn 4. Check freeway 1 at turn 4:\n\nOnly one car: (54,43,right,3) -> at turn 4: [43+3*2, 54+3*2] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo if we go down to freeway 1 at turn 3 (from freeway 2 at turn 2 and then D at turn 3), then at turn 4 we are at freeway 1 and safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 at turn 4, which is freeway 1. Then we can start going up.\n\nBut we lost progress because we were at y=2 and now we are at y=1.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 2 we could have gone down to freeway 1 at turn 3? Then we are at freeway 1 at turn 3. Check freeway 1 at turn 3:\n\nAt turn 3: time passed=1 -> [43+3,54+3] = [46,57] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, we are still at freeway 1? If we stay, then at turn 4 freeway 1 is [49,60] -> safe. But we are at y=1 and we want to go to 9.\n\nWe need to go up eventually.\n\nBut at turn 4, freeways 2,3,4 are dangerous. So we must avoid those at turn 4.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nOption 1:\nTurn 2: D -> then at turn 3: y=1 (freeway 1) -> safe at turn 3.\nThen at turn 3: we can choose to stay at 1 or go up to 2.\n\nBut if we go up to 2 at turn 3, then at turn 4 we are at freeway 2 -> which is dangerous (car covers 0) -> collide.\n\nSo at turn 3 we must stay at 1? Then at turn 4 we are at freeway 1 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, we can go up to 2? Then at turn 5 we are at freeway 2.\n\nNow, check freeway 2 at turn 5:\n\nAt turn 5: time passed = 3 (from turn 2 to 5: 3 turns).\nCar1: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> covers 0? 1 to 12: 0 is not in [1,12]? 0 is not included. So safe? [1,12] does not include 0? Because 0 is less than 1.\n\nCar2: [1+12*3, 12+12*3] = [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> no.\nCar3: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 2 at turn 5 is safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut we are at turn 5 at y=2. Then we can go up to 3 at turn 5? Then at turn 6 we are at freeway 3.\n\nCheck freeway 3 at turn 6: same cars? Then at turn 6: time passed=4.\nCar1: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\nCar2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> safe.\nCar3: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we have to check the other freeways as we go.\n\nWe also have to check freeway 5,6,7,8 at the turns we are there.\n\nBut note: freeway 5 and 6 have a car (60,49,right,6) and freeway 7 and 8 have (-40,-51,right,4). We must check when we pass through.\n\nLet me write the plan so far:\n\nTurn 2: at y=2 -> safe. We choose D to go to 1 at turn 3.\nTurn 3: at y=1 -> safe. We choose S (stay) to remain at 1 at turn 4? Or we can choose U? But if we choose U at turn 3, then at turn 4 we are at y=2 -> and freeway 2 at turn 4 is dangerous. So we must choose S at turn 3 to stay at 1 at turn 4.\n\nTurn 4: at y=1 -> safe (as computed). Then we choose U to go to 2 at turn 5.\nTurn 5: at y=2 -> safe (as above). Then we choose U to go to 3 at turn 6.\nTurn 6: at y=3 -> safe (as above). Then we choose U to go to 4 at turn 7.\n\nNow, at turn 7, we are at freeway 4. Check freeway 4 at turn 7:\n\nTime passed from turn 2 to 7: 5 turns.\nCar1: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\nCar2: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\nCar3: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen turn 7: we are at y=4 -> safe. Then we choose U to go to 5 at turn 8.\nTurn 8: at freeway 5. Check freeway 5 at turn 8:\n\nFreeway 5 has one car: (60,49,right,6) -> at turn 8: [49+6*6, 60+6*6]? Time passed=6 (from turn 2 to 8: 6 turns)? \n\nWait: at turn 8, time passed = 8-2 = 6.\n\nSo [49+6*6, 60+6*6] = [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U at turn 8: to go to 6 at turn 9.\nTurn 9: at freeway 6. Check freeway 6 at turn 9:\n\nFreeway 6 has the same car? Then [49+6*7, 60+6*7]? Time passed=7 (from turn 2 to 9: 7 turns) -> [49+42,60+42]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U at turn 9: to go to 7 at turn 10.\nTurn 10: at freeway 7. Check freeway 7 at turn 10:\n\nFreeway 7: (-40,-51,right,4) -> at turn 10: time passed=8.\nSo [-51+4*8, -40+4*8] = [-51+32, -40+32] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U at turn 10: to go to 8 at turn 11.\nTurn 11: at freeway 8. Check freeway 8 at turn 11:\n\nSame as freeway 7? Then [-51+4*9, -40+4*9]? Time passed=9 -> [-51+36, -40+36] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose U at turn 11: to go to 9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check. And we are at (0,9) at turn 12.\n\nTotal turns: from turn 2 to turn 12, we took 11 actions? Actually, we start at turn 2 and we do actions at turn 2,3,...,11 (10 actions) and then at turn 12 we are at 9.\n\nBut let me count:\n\nTurn 2: action D -> to y=1 at turn 3.\nTurn 3: action S -> stay at y=1 at turn 4.\nTurn 4: action U -> to y=2 at turn 5.\nTurn 5: action U -> to y=3 at turn 6.\nTurn 6: action U -> to y=4 at turn 7.\nTurn 7: action U -> to y=5 at turn 8.\nTurn 8: action U -> to y=6 at turn 9.\nTurn 9: action U -> to y=7 at turn 10.\nTurn 10: action U -> to y=8 at turn 11.\nTurn 11: action U -> to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nSo we have 10 actions? But we started at turn 2 and ended at turn 12. The number of actions is from turn 2 to turn 11 (inclusive) -> 10 turns? But the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H and the sequence.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 10 moves and ended at turn 12. The minimal without cars is 7 moves (7 U). We had to wait one turn (at turn 3 we did S) and one extra move for going down? Actually, we did one D and one S, then 8 U moves? Total moves: 1 (D) + 1 (S) + 8 (U) = 10 moves.\n\nBut note: we started at y=2 and ended at y=9: that's 7 steps up. But we did one step down (to 1) and then back up, so we did 8 steps up? Actually, from 2 to 1 (down) then 1 to 9 (8 up) -> total 9 moves? But we also had a stay. So the moves:\n\nStart at 2.\nMove D: to 1 (1 move)\nThen S: stay at 1 (2 moves)\nThen U: to 2 (3 moves)\nThen U: to 3 (4)\nThen U: to 4 (5)\nThen U: to 5 (6)\nThen U: to 6 (7)\nThen U: to 7 (8)\nThen U: to 8 (9)\nThen U: to 9 (10)\n\nSo 10 moves.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nAlternative: at turn 2, we stay (S) at y=2. Then at turn 3, we are at y=2 (safe, as we computed freeway 2 at turn 3 is safe). Then at turn 3, we can go down to 1? Then at turn 4 we are at 1 (freeway 1) -> safe. Then at turn 4, we go up to 2 at turn 5 (freeway 2 at turn 5 is safe, as we computed [1,12] doesn't cover 0). Then we can go up from there. But then we have:\n\nTurn 2: S -> y=2 at turn 3.\nTurn 3: D -> y=1 at turn 4.\nTurn 4: U -> y=2 at turn 5.\nThen same as before: from turn 5 at y=2, we can go up to 3 at turn 6, etc.\n\nThis also takes 10 moves: from turn 2 to turn 12? Actually, same number of moves: 10.\n\nBut we avoided the D at the beginning? Actually, we did S then D, which is two moves to get to 1 at turn 4? Then we go up at turn 4 to 2 at turn 5. Then we are at turn 5 at y=2, same as in the previous plan at turn 5.\n\nBut in the previous plan we were at y=1 at turn 4 and then went to 2 at turn 5. Here we are at y=2 at turn 5. So we are one step ahead? Let's see:\n\nPrevious plan:\nTurn 4: at y=1\nTurn 5: at y=2\n\nThis alternative:\nTurn 4: at y=1? No: in this alternative, at turn 2: S -> turn 3: y=2; then turn 3: D -> turn 4: y=1; then turn 4: U -> turn 5: y=2.\n\nSame as the first plan: at turn 5 we are at y=2.\n\nSo same.\n\nBut in the first plan we did D at turn 2 and then S at turn 3. Here we did S at turn 2 and D at turn 3. Then both have U at turn 4? Actually, in the first plan we did D (turn2), S (turn3), U (turn4). In the alternative, we did S (turn2), D (turn3), U (turn4). Same three moves to get to y=2 at turn5.\n\nSo same.\n\nCan we avoid going down to 1? We have to avoid freeways 2,3,4 at turn 4. The only safe freeways at turn 4 are 1,5,6,7,8. We are at y=2 at turn 2. We can only move to 1,2,3 at turn 3. Then from turn 3, we can only move to 0,1,2,3,4? But we are at freeway, so we can only move to adjacent freeways or same.\n\nBut we cannot jump to freeway 5 in one move. So we must go through the freeways.\n\nTherefore, the only safe haven at turn 4 is freeway 1 (or freeway 5, but we are at y=2 and 5 is too high to reach by turn 4?).\n\nTo get to freeway 5 at turn 4: we start at y=2 at turn 2. We need to go up 3 steps: so at turn 2: U (to 3 at turn3), then turn3: U (to4 at turn4) -> but then we are at freeway4 at turn4 -> collide. Or if we go up faster? We can only move one per turn. So we cannot reach freeway5 by turn4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 is the only safe one we can reach.\n\nSo we must be at freeway1 at turn4.\n\nHow to get to freeway1 at turn4? We can:\n\nOption A: \n- Turn2: D -> to1 at turn3.\n- Turn3: S -> to1 at turn4.\n\nOption B:\n- Turn2: S -> to2 at turn3.\n- Turn3: D -> to1 at turn4.\n\nBoth require two moves to get to freeway1 at turn4, and then we start going up.\n\nThen the rest: from turn4 at y=1, we go to y=2 at turn5 (safe), then to y=3 at turn6 (safe), then to y=4 at turn7 (safe), then to y=5 at turn8 (safe), then to y=6 at turn9 (safe), then to y=7 at turn10 (safe), then to y=8 at turn11 (safe), then to y=9 at turn12.\n\nSo total moves: from turn2 to turn11: 10 actions? And we reach y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut we can try to go faster after turn5? We are at y=2 at turn5. We need to go to y=9: that's 7 steps. So from turn5 to turn12: 7 moves? Then total moves: 10.\n\nBut note: after turn4, we are at y=1. Then we go to y=2 at turn5, then we have to go to 9: 7 more moves (from turn5 to turn12: 8 turns? Because we do an action at turn5 and then at turn6,...,turn11: 7 actions? Then we are at y=9 at turn12.\n\nActually, the number of actions: \n- Actions at turn2,3,4: 3 actions to get to y=1 at turn4? Actually, no: \n  In option A: \n      turn2: D -> at turn3: y=1\n      turn3: S -> at turn4: y=1\n      Then we do actions at turn4,5,6,...,11: 8 actions? \n  But at turn4 we do U to get to y=2 at turn5.\n  Then at turn5: U to y=3 at turn6.\n  ...\n  Then at turn11: U to y=9 at turn12.\n\n  So total actions: turn2 to turn11: 10 actions.\n\nThe minimal without cars is 7. But we had to do 10.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to avoid the detour? We saw that we cannot be at freeway3 at turn3 because then we are stuck for turn4. What if we wait at turn2 and turn3? Then we are at y=2 at turn4? But we cannot because freeway2 is dangerous at turn4.\n\nSo we must not be at y=2,3,4 at turn4.\n\nWe are forced to go to y=1 at turn4.\n\nBut what about y=0? We can go to y=0 at turn3 or turn4? But y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision. But note: if we are at y=0, we can stay there? But we need to go to 9.\n\nBut we can go to y=0 to avoid the danger? \n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn2: D -> to y=1 at turn3 (freeway1, safe).\nAt turn3: D -> to y=0 at turn4.\n\nAt turn4, we are at y=0 -> not a freeway, so no collision. Then at turn4, we can choose to go up to 1 at turn5.\n\nCheck freeway1 at turn5: \nTime passed=3 (from turn2 to5: 3 turns) -> [43+3*3,54+3*3]=[43+9,54+9]=[52,63] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn5: we are at y=1. Then we can go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway2 at turn5? We saw freeway2 at turn5 is safe: [1,12] -> 0 is not included? But note: at turn5, freeway2: the car1 is [1,12] -> but we are at freeway1 at turn5, then we go to freeway2 at turn6? \n\nActually, at turn5: we are at y=1. Then we can go up to 2 at turn6.\n\nCheck freeway2 at turn6: \nTime passed=4 -> \nCar1: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\nCar2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> safe.\nCar3: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen we go up as before.\n\nBut now, we did:\n\nTurn2: D -> y=1 at turn3\nTurn3: D -> y=0 at turn4\nTurn4: U -> y=1 at turn5\nTurn5: U -> y=2 at turn6\n\nThen from turn6 at y=2, we go to y=3 at turn7, y=4 at turn8, etc.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn6, whereas in the previous plan we were at y=2 at turn5. So we are one turn behind.\n\nThen we go up: turn6: U to3 at turn7, U to4 at turn8, U to5 at turn9, U to6 at turn10, U to7 at turn11, U to8 at turn12, U to9 at turn13.\n\nSo we end at turn13, with 11 actions? (from turn2 to turn12: 11 actions). Worse.\n\nSo the first plan is better.\n\nBut in the first plan we did 10 actions and ended at turn12.\n\nCan we avoid the extra moves? \n\nIdea: after turn4, we are at y=1. Then we go to y=2 at turn5. Then we can go up without stopping until y=9? But we have to check freeway5,6,7,8 as we go.\n\nBut we did and they are safe at the times we pass.\n\nBut we did 10 moves. Is there a way to do 9 moves?\n\nMinimal moves: we need to go from 2 to 9: 7 moves up. But we have to avoid the danger at turn4. We did one extra down and one extra stay? Actually, we did one down and one stay and then the 7 ups? But we did 8 ups? Because we went from 2 to 1 (down) then 1 to 9 (8 ups). So total moves: 1+1+8? But the 1+1 are two moves and then 8 moves: total 10.\n\nBut note: we also had to wait at turn3? But that was the stay.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to skip the stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn2: D -> to y=1 at turn3 (safe).\nAt turn3: U -> to y=2 at turn4. But at turn4, freeway2 is dangerous -> collide.\n\nSo we must not do that.\n\nAt turn2: S -> to y=2 at turn3 (safe).\nAt turn3: D -> to y=1 at turn4 (safe).\nAt turn4: U -> to y=2 at turn5 (safe).\n\nThen we are at y=2 at turn5. Then we need to go to 9: 7 moves. So at turn5: U, turn6: U, ... until turn11: U to 9 at turn12. That's 7 moves. Total moves: turn2: S, turn3: D, turn4: U, then turn5-11: 7 U -> total 10 moves.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut note: we don't need to wait at y=1 at turn4? We went up immediately. So we saved a move? Actually, in the first plan we did:\n\nTurn2: D -> turn3: y=1\nTurn3: S -> turn4: y=1   [we stayed one extra turn]\nThen turn4: U -> turn5: y=2\n\nBut in this version we did:\n\nTurn2: S -> turn3: y=2\nTurn3: D -> turn4: y=1\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y=2\n\nSo we didn't have the extra stay. We only did three moves to get to y=2 at turn5. Then we go up 7 moves: from turn5 to turn11: 7 moves, so we are at y=9 at turn12.\n\nTotal moves: 3 (for the initial) + 7 (for the up) = 10 moves.\n\nBut in the first plan we had to do D at turn2 and then S at turn3 and then U at turn4: that's also 3 moves to get to y=2 at turn5. Then 7 moves to 9: total 10.\n\nSo both are 10.\n\nBut in this version, we did not go to y=0 and we did not have an extra stay. So we can use this.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: S (stay at y=2 at turn3)\nTurn 3: D (go to y=1 at turn4)\nTurn 4: U (go to y=2 at turn5)\nThen from turn5 to turn11: we do U every turn.\n\nBut at turn5: we are at y=2 -> safe (as computed: freeway2 at turn5: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? But 1 to 12: 0 is not included? Correct.\n\nThen turn5: U -> to y=3 at turn6. Freeway3 at turn6: [13,24] (for the first car) -> safe.\nTurn6: U -> to y=4 at turn7. Freeway4 at turn7: [25,36] -> safe.\nTurn7: U -> to y=5 at turn8. Freeway5 at turn8: [49+6*6,60+6*6]= [85,96]? Wait, time passed from turn2 to8: 6 turns -> [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\nTurn8: U -> to y=6 at turn9. Freeway6: same as freeway5? Then [49+6*7,60+6*7]=[49+42,60+42]=[91,102] -> safe.\nTurn9: U -> to y=7 at turn10. Freeway7: (-40,-51,right,4) -> time passed=8: [-51+32, -40+32]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\nTurn10: U -> to y=8 at turn11. Freeway8: same -> time passed=9: [-51+36, -40+36]=[-15,-4] -> safe.\nTurn11: U -> to y=9 at turn12.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nTotal actions: 10 actions (from turn2 to turn11).\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions for turns starting at t1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: D\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut we must check if we can do it in less than 10? We have to make sure we avoid the cars.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 9 moves? That would be if we start at y=2 at turn2 and end at y=9 at turn11.\n\nWe need to go from 2 to 9: 7 moves up. So we have 2 moves to spare? But we have to avoid the danger at turn4.\n\nWe must be at y=1 at turn4 (to avoid the danger at freeways 2,3,4). Then from y=1 at turn4, we have to go to 9: that's 8 moves up. But we only have 7 moves from turn4 to turn11? Because from turn4 to turn11: 7 actions? Then we would be at 1 + 7 = 8 at turn11? Then we need one more to 9 at turn12.\n\nSo we cannot get to 9 by turn11? Because we start at turn4 at y=1, and we can only do 7 actions by turn11: then y=1+7=8 at turn12? And then we need another action to go to 9 at turn13.\n\nBut that would be 9 actions? But we are already at turn13, which is worse.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at y=1 at turn4, then we need 8 moves to go to 9. The earliest we can be at 9 is turn4+8=12. So we need at least 10 actions: from turn2 to turn11 (10 actions) to be at turn12.\n\nSo 10 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: D\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, in the sequence above, we did 10 actions and ended at turn12. The problem says the sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and we are at t1=2.\n\nSo the actions are at turns: 2,3,4,...,2+H-1.\n\nWe have H actions: at turns 2,3,4,...,2+H-1.\n\nWe want that after the last action (at turn 2+H-1), we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our plan: \n- We do the last action at turn11: which is the 10th action (since we start at turn2: index 0: turn2, index1: turn3, ... index9: turn11). Then at turn12, we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut the action at turn11 (the 10th action) is U, and after that, at turn12, we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence is for t from 0 to 9 (H=10): \na_{2+0} = a_2 = S\na_3 = D\na_4 = U\na_5 = U\na_6 = U\na_7 = U\na_8 = U\na_9 = U\na_10 = U\na_11 = U\n\nBut the turn indices: \nTurn 2: a_2 = S\nTurn 3: a_3 = D\nTurn 4: a_4 = U\nTurn 5: a_5 = U\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\nTurn 11: a_11 = U\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: D\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: we must check freeway 5 at turn8? We did: [85,96] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 5 at turn8: we are at y=5 at turn8? We go to y=5 at turn8? Actually, at turn7 we are at y=4, then we do U at turn7: so at turn8 we are at y=5. Then we check freeway5 at turn8: the car is [85,96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn9: we are at y=6 at turn9? Then freeway6: same car? [91,102] -> safe.\n\nBut note: freeway5 and 6 have the same car? The table says freeway6 has the same as freeway5? Yes, so freeway6 at turn9: same as freeway5 at turn8 but advanced by one turn? Actually, at turn9: time passed=7, so [49+6*7,60+6*7]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn10: we are at y=7 at turn10? Then freeway7: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn11: we are at y=8 at turn11? Then freeway8: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nThen we go to 9 at turn12.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid plan.\n\nIs there a plan with H=9? \n\nSuppose we try to be at y=9 at turn11. Then we start at y=2 at turn2. We need to gain 7 in y. So we must do at least 7 U moves. We have 9 moves: so we can do 7 U and 2 S? Or 7 U, 1 D and 1 U? But that might not help.\n\nBut we must be at y=1 at turn4. \n\nSo at turn4, we must be at y=1. \n\nFrom turn2 to turn4: two moves. We start at y=2 at turn2. We can do:\n\nOption1: D then D: to y=0 at turn4? But then we are at y=0 at turn4, which is safe. Then we need to go to 9: 9 steps? Then we need 9 moves? But we have only 7 moves left? From turn4 to turn11: 7 moves? Then we can get to y=0+7=7 at turn11? Then we are at 7, not 9.\n\nOption2: D then S: to y=1 at turn4. Then we need to go to 9: 8 moves. We have from turn4 to turn11: 7 moves? Then we get to 1+7=8 at turn11. Then we need one more to 9 at turn12.\n\nOption3: S then D: to y=1 at turn4. Then same.\n\nSo we cannot be at 9 at turn11. Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, meaning the sequence consists of actions from turn 2 to turn 11, and the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 12.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The player must not be on a freeway \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at any turn \\(T\\) if \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n- **Car Movement**: All cars are right-moving. For a car with initial (at turn 2) tail \\(\\tau\\), head \\(h\\), and speed \\(s\\), its span at turn \\(T \\geq 2\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)]\\).\n- **Critical Danger at Turn 4**: Freeways 2, 3, and 4 have a car covering \\(x = 0\\) at turn 4. Thus, the player must be at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe) or \\(y = 0\\) (non-freeway) at turn 4. The plan involves moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4 to avoid collision and then proceeding upward.\n- **Efficiency**: The sequence minimizes turns by using a detour to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4 and then ascending directly to \\(y = 9\\) without additional delays, ensuring all freeways are safe at the relevant turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 2 (current turn)**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 is safe at turn 3 (cars: \\([-23, -12]\\), \\([13, 24]\\), \\([49, 60]\\); 0 not covered).\n- **Turn 3**: Move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is safe at turn 4 (car: \\([49, 60]\\); 0 not covered).\n- **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 is safe at turn 5 (cars: \\([1, 12]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), \\([73, 84]\\); 0 not covered).\n- **Turns 5 to 11**: Move up (U) repeatedly to ascend from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\). All intermediate freeways are safe:\n  - Turn 5: \\(y = 3\\) at turn 6; freeway 3 safe (cars: \\([13, 24]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), \\([85, 96]\\)).\n  - Turn 6: \\(y = 4\\) at turn 7; freeway 4 safe (cars: \\([25, 36]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), \\([97, 108]\\)).\n  - Turn 7: \\(y = 5\\) at turn 8; freeway 5 safe (car: \\([85, 96]\\)).\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9; freeway 6 safe (car: \\([91, 102]\\)).\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10; freeway 7 safe (car: \\([-19, -8]\\)).\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11; freeway 8 safe (car: \\([-15, -4]\\)).\n  - Turn 11: \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 (not a freeway; no collision check).\n\n### Answer:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 10\\) with the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: S \\\\\nTurn 3: D \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed, I can find where it is at any future turn. Collision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, the player is on y_T, and only checks for collision on that row at that turn. If moving to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player isn't on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so no collision from y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=3, player at y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 7 times, but since I can stay or move down, it might take more than 7 turns if I have to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSet t=0 as the current turn, so at time τ = t1 + t, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt τ = t1 + t, action a_{t1+t} is taken, position y_{τ}.\n\nStart at τ=3, y=2.\n\nEnd when y=9 for some τ.\n\nMinimize H, the number of actions.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=3.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (57,46, right, 3). Since direction right, span is [τ, h] = [46,57] at t=3? No.\n\nThe notation: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], meaning tail to head, I think, since it says for right: span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] at t1, to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] at T.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: cars (57,46, right, 3). So head=57, tail=46, direction right, speed=3.\n\nAt t1=3, span = [tail, head] = [46,57] since right-moving.\n\nThe table says \"head h, tail τ\", and for direction, right or left.\n\nIn the update, for right: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nBut in the collision, it's when 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway y_T.\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, I need to see for each freeway, at each time, if there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y), so for a given freeway y and time T, if y has cars, check if any car on y has 0 in its span at T.\n\nNow, for freeway k, at time T.\n\nLet me list for each freeway, the cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, (head=57, tail=46, dir=right, speed=3)\n\nSince right-moving, at time T, span = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [46 + 3(T-3), 57 + 3(T-3)]\n\nSet ΔT = T - t1 = T - 3\n\nSo span at T: [46 + 3ΔT, 57 + 3ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if 46 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 57 + 3ΔT\n\nBut 46 + 3ΔT is increasing, min at ΔT=0: 46 to 57, both positive, so 0 not in range, and as ΔT increases, it moves right, so 0 never in span since min x is 46 >0. So on freeway 1, never a collision at x=0, because the car is always to the right.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23? That seems odd.\n\ntail=-23, head=-12, direction right, speed=12.\n\nAt t1=3, span = [τ, h] = [-23, -12] for right-moving? No.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so [tail, head] = [-23, -12]\n\nThen at time T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-23 + 12ΔT, -12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12ΔT\n\nWhich is -23 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT ≤ 1 since ΔT integer? T is turn, so ΔT integer.\n\nT is turn number, so ΔT = T - t1 is integer.\n\nSimilarly, all times discrete.\n\nSo ΔT integer.\n\n-23 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 = 1.916, so ΔT ≤ 1\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -12 + 12ΔT => 12 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo for ΔT=1, 0 ≤ -12 +12*1 = 0 ≤ 0? -12 +12=0, so 0 ≤ 0, which is true.\n\n-23 +12*1 = -23+12= -11 ≤0, true.\n\nFor ΔT=1, -23 +12= -11 ≤0 ≤0, yes 0 is in [-11,0]? Let's see:\n\nAt ΔT=1, span = [-23 +12, -12 +12] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 is included, since head is at 0.\n\nSo at T where ΔT=1, which is T= t1 +1 =4, the car spans from -11 to 0, so at x=0, it is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for other ΔT.\n\nΔT=1: -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes.\n\nΔT=0: span at T=3: [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative.\n\nΔT=2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=4 (ΔT=1), 0 is occupied on freeway 2 for this car.\n\nBut there are multiple cars on freeway 2.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (24,13, right,12)\n\nHead=24, tail=13, dir=right, speed=12\n\nAt T, span [13 +12ΔT, 24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 13+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24+12ΔT\n\n13+12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤ -13, impossible since ΔT≥0, 12ΔT≥0 > -13? 13+12ΔT ≥13>0, so left end >0, so 0 not ≤ left end, so never 0 in span. Since min is 13 at ΔT=0, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (60,49, right,12)\n\nHead=60, tail=49, [49+12ΔT, 60+12ΔT], min 49>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSo on freeway 2, only the first car causes a collision at T=4, when ΔT=1, i.e., turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, if player is on freeway 2, collision.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars are identical: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nSame as freeway 2, so similarly, only at T=4, collision possible from first car.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same cars, so same, collision at T=4 if on y=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nHead=-48? Tail=-59, direction right, speed=6.\n\nAt t1=3, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, [ -59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT\n\nFirst, -59 +6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤59 => ΔT ≤59/6≈9.833, so ΔT≤9\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -48 +6ΔT => 48 ≤6ΔT => ΔT ≥8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nΔT=8: -59 +48 = -11 ≤0, and -48+48=0 ≤0? 0 ≤0 true.\n\n-48 +6*8 = -48+48=0, so 0 ≤0 true.\n\n-59+48= -11 ≤0 true.\n\nSo at ΔT=8, span [-11, 0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=9: -59 +54= -5 ≤0, -48+54=6 ≥0, so 0 in [-5,6]\n\nΔT=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo at T when ΔT=8 or 9, i.e., T=3+8=11 or T=3+9=12, collision if on freeway 5.\n\nT=t1 + ΔT =3 + ΔT\n\nΔT=8: T=11\n\nΔT=9: T=12\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same car, (-48,-59,right,6), identical to freeway 5, so collision at T=11 and T=12 on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: car (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nHead=-36, tail=-47, direction right, speed=4\n\nAt T, span [ -47 +4ΔT, -36 +4ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -47 +4ΔT ≤0 => 4ΔT ≤47 => ΔT ≤47/4=11.75, so ΔT≤11\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +4ΔT => 36 ≤4ΔT => ΔT ≥9\n\nSo ΔT from 9 to 11 inclusive.\n\nΔT=9: -47+36= -11 ≤0, -36+36=0 ≤0, true\n\nΔT=10: -47+40= -7 ≤0, -36+40=4 ≥0, true\n\nΔT=11: -47+44= -3 ≤0, -36+44=8 ≥0, true\n\nΔT=12: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo collision on freeway 7 at T=3+9=12, 3+10=13, 3+11=14? T=t1 + ΔT=3 + ΔT\n\nΔT=9: T=12\n\nΔT=10: T=13\n\nΔT=11: T=14\n\nFreeway 8: same car (-36,-47,right,4), so same as above, collision at T=12,13,14 on freeway 8.\n\nNow, freeway 1 has no collision, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 have collision only at T=4.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 have collision at T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=3.\n\ny=2 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, but y=2 is freeway 2?\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, y=2 is freeway 2, etc., up to y=8 freeway 8.\n\nPlayer is at row y.\n\nAt turn T, player on row y_T.\n\nIf y_T is between 1 and 8, need to check collision for that row at that time.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no cars, so no collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeways.\n\nNow, player needs to reach y=9.\n\nStart at y=2, t=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up, but may need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, and y must stay in [0,9].\n\nThe dangerous times are when on a freeway at a time when collision occurs.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On freeway 2,3, or 4 at T=4: collision\n\n- On freeway 5 or 6 at T=11 or 12\n\n- On freeway 7 or 8 at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 1 has no collision at any time, as car is always right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2,3,4, only dangerous at T=4.\n\nFor freeway 5,6: dangerous at T=11,12\n\nFreeway 7,8: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, player starts at t=3, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt t=3, on freeway 2, but at t=3, for freeway 2, is there collision?\n\nAt t=3, ΔT=0, for freeway 2, first car span [-23,-12], 0 not in, other cars not near 0, so no collision at t=3 on y=2.\n\nBut at t=4, if on y=2,3, or4, collision.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nTo minimize H, probably want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no cars above, once I reach y=9, I can stop.\n\nBut need to reach it.\n\nNow, let me list the times and what rows are dangerous.\n\nDangerous situations:\n\n- At T=4: y=2,3,4 dangerous (since freeway 2,3,4)\n\n- At T=11: y=5,6 dangerous (freeway 5,6)\n\n- At T=12: y=5,6,7,8 dangerous (freeway 5,6 at T=12, and freeway 7,8 at T=12)\n\n- At T=13: y=7,8 dangerous\n\n- At T=14: y=7,8 dangerous\n\nOther times, no danger on any row, except possibly, but from above, only these times have collisions.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 always safe, freeway 2,3,4 only at T=4, etc.\n\nAt other times, all rows are safe.\n\nPlayer at t=3, y=2.\n\nIf I go up directly, but at t=4, if I am on y=2,3, or4, I collide.\n\nAt t=3, I can take action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at t=4, then at t=4, y=3, which is freeway 3, and T=4, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, y=2 at t=4, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at t=4.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is always safe, no collision.\n\nSo at t=3, if I go down, a_{t1} = a_3 = D, then y_4 = y_3 + (-1) = 2-1=1.\n\nAt t=4, y=1, freeway 1, no collision.\n\nThen at t=4, I need to take action to go to next.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nSince t=4 is dangerous for y=2,3,4.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am at y=1 if I went down.\n\nFrom y=1, I can go up to y=2, but at t=5, not t=4.\n\nt=4 is the dangerous time.\n\nAfter t=4, y=2,3,4 are safe except for later times, but later dangers are at T=11,12,etc., which is far.\n\nFirst, let's handle the immediate danger at t=4.\n\nSo to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Go down to y=1 at t=4: safe, since y=1 no collision.\n\n- Go up to y=3? But y=3 at t=4 is dangerous.\n\ny=3 at t=4 is on freeway 3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, stay y=2, collision.\n\nGo down to y=1: safe.\n\nCan I go to y=0?\n\ny=0 is below, and no freeway, so safe.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, if I go down, to y=1 at t=4.\n\ny=1 is still freeway, but safe.\n\nIf I go down again, to y=0, but at t=3, action D, y=1 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, I can go down to y=0 at t=5, or stay, or up.\n\nBut at t=4, since I am at y=1, I can choose action.\n\nBut t=4 is only dangerous for y=2,3,4, so y=1 is fine.\n\nNow, after t=4, no immediate danger until T=11, which is turn 11.\n\nt=3 to t=11 is 8 turns later? ΔT=8 from t1.\n\nt1=3, T=11 is ΔT=8.\n\nBut I need to move to y=9.\n\nSince no danger between t=5 to t=10, I can move freely.\n\nBut I have to avoid the future dangers at T=11,12,13,14 on certain rows.\n\nFirst, let's get past t=4.\n\nSo at t=3, I should go down to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nAction at t=3: D, to y=1 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to be careful not to be on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times: T=11,12,13,14\n\n- T=11: y=5,6 dangerous\n\n- T=12: y=5,6,7,8 dangerous\n\n- T=13: y=7,8 dangerous\n\n- T=14: y=7,8 dangerous\n\nNow, current at t=4, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe time from t=4 to t=11 is 7 turns (t=4 to t=10 is 6 actions? Let's think in terms of turns.\n\nAt time τ, after action.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some τ.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves up, but I can take fewer if I move faster, but since I need exactly 8 steps up to increase from 1 to 9, each U increases by 1, so to go from y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 Up actions, and possibly some S or D, but S or D would make it take more turns, so to minimize H, I should avoid S and D, and go straight up as much as possible, but avoiding the collision times.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end, including the action that gets me to y=9.\n\nStart at τ=t1=3, y=2.\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=t1 + H - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn τ, before action, position is for that turn.\n\nIn the game dynamics, at turn t, player is at position (0, y_t), then chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, collision occurs if on freeway y_T and 0 in car span on that row.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at y_T before taking action.\n\nAfter action, at turn T+1, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, y_T is the row.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from t1 to t1 + H -1, and at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is updated.\n\nBut position at turn t is y_t.\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nAfter actions a_3, a_4, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}, and at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1 + H -1, which sets y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H -1} + Δy, but we care that at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSince we set y_{t1 + H -1} =9, then the action at that turn doesn't change it if S, or if U or D, it might go to 10 or 8, but y must be in [0,9], so if y=9, action U would go to 10, invalid, similarly D to 8 not 9. So to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, the action must be such that it stays or comes to 9.\n\nBut since we end when y=9, and we take action to reach it, so at turn t1+H-1, y=9, and action a_{t1+H-1} could be S, or if coming from below, U to 9, or from above D to 9.\n\nBut to minimize H, probably we come from below with U.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nAt t=3, action D: so y_4 = y_3 + (-1) = 2-1=1\n\nNow at τ=4, y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=11,12,13,14.\n\nT=11 is τ=11.\n\nCurrent τ=4.\n\nFrom τ=4 to τ=11, there are 7 turns: τ=4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nIn 7 turns, I can move up to 7 steps, from y=1 to y=8, if I go up each time.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1\n\nAction U: y_5 = 2\n\nU: y_6=3\n\nU: y_7=4\n\nU: y_8=5\n\nU: y_9=6\n\nU: y_10=7\n\nU: y_11=8\n\nNow at τ=11, y=8.\n\nBut at τ=11, dangerous for y=5,6.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, which is dangerous at T=12,13,14, but at T=11, is it dangerous?\n\nAt T=11, dangerous for y=5,6 only.\n\ny=8 is not dangerous at T=11, only at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 dangerous at T=12,13,14? T=12,13,14 for y=7,8.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, which is safe, since only y=5,6 dangerous.\n\nThen at τ=11, I can go up to y=9.\n\nAction U at τ=11: y_12 = 8 +1 =9\n\nNow at τ=12, y=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, here at τ=12, y=9.\n\nBut let's check if at any point I was in collision.\n\nFirst, from τ=4 to τ=11:\n\nAt τ=4, y=1: freeway 1, safe\n\nτ=5, y=2: freeway 2, now at τ=5, is it dangerous? Only τ=4 was dangerous for y=2,3,4, but τ=5 is not dangerous, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=6, y=3: freeway 3, no danger at τ=6, safe.\n\nτ=7, y=4: freeway 4, safe, since only danger at τ=4.\n\nτ=8, y=5: freeway 5, at τ=8, danger at τ=11 and 12 for y=5, but τ=8 is early, safe.\n\nτ=9, y=6: freeway 6, similarly safe at τ=9.\n\nτ=10, y=7: freeway 7, danger at τ=12,13,14, but τ=10 early, safe.\n\nτ=11, y=8: freeway 8, at τ=11, danger only for y=5,6, so y=8 safe.\n\nThen at τ=11, action U, so y_12=9.\n\nAt τ=12, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, is y=9 at τ=12, which is the end.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some turn, here at τ=12.\n\nH: from t=3 to t=12? Actions from t=3 to t=11, I think.\n\nStart: actions from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=3.\n\nAt t=3, action D, to y=1 at t=4? Position after action.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t=3, y=2, take action a3.\n\nAfter a3, y4 is set.\n\nAt turn t=4, position y4, take action a4, and so on.\n\nAt turn t, collision based on y_t.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt t=3: y=2, take D, so y4=1\n\nAt t=4: y=1, take U, so y5=2\n\nAt t=5: y=2, take U, so y6=3\n\nAt t=6: y=3, take U, so y7=4\n\nAt t=7: y=4, take U, so y8=5\n\nAt t=8: y=5, take U, so y9=6\n\nAt t=9: y=6, take U, so y10=7\n\nAt t=10: y=7, take U, so y11=8\n\nAt t=11: y=8, take U, so y12=9\n\nNow at t=12, y=9, which is the position at turn t=12.\n\nSince we want y_t =9 for some t, here at t=12, y=9.\n\nAnd we took actions from t=3 to t=11, that's 9 actions? t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: 9 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so absolute, actions at t=3 to t=3 + H -1.\n\nSet t=3 as time 0 for simplicity.\n\nLet time t' = τ - t1, so at t'=0, τ=3, y=2\n\nThen actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at time t' = H-1, position y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t'=0: y=2, action D, so at next, y at t'=1 (τ=4) is 1\n\nBetter to think of position after actions.\n\nAfter k actions, position at time τ = t1 + k.\n\nAt time τ = t1, before action, position y_{t1}\n\nAfter first action, at τ = t1 +1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, position at τ = t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at some turn to be 9.\n\nThe sequence: actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} such that after these actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} =9? No.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means that at some turn, position is (0,9).\n\nBut in the context, after the sequence of actions, at turn t1 + H -1, position should be (0,9), I think.\n\nBecause the actions are from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so absolute turns t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format, it lists actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + something, ending when y=9.\n\nIn the box, it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd at that turn, position is (0,9).\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t, then action a_t is taken, then y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which could be S, or U to 10 invalid, or D to 8, so to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we must not move away, so action at that turn should be such that it sets y_{t1 + H} but we care about y_{t1 + H -1} being 9.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that after taking a_{t1 + H -1}, the position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9, meaning that we are at 9 before taking the action, or after?\n\nI think there's ambiguity.\n\nIn the game dynamics: at turn t, player is at (0, y_t), then chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nTo \"reach (0,9) at turn T\" means y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t, if y_t =8, and action U, then y_{t+1} =9, but at turn t, position is 8, not 9.\n\nWe reach (0,9) at turn t+1.\n\nBut in the sequence, if we stop at action a_t, position at t is not 9 yet.\n\nTo have position at turn t be 9, we need to be there before action.\n\nIn the action sequence given, for turn t, we specify a_t, and at that turn, position is y_t before action.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, it means at turn t1 + H -1, before taking a_{t1 + H -1}, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen we take a_{t1 + H -1}, which could be S, or U/D if possible, but if y=9, U to 10 invalid, so must be S or D to 8, but we want to be at 9, so probably a_{t1 + H -1} should be S, or if we came from below, we U to 9 at previous turn.\n\nLet's see the minimal way.\n\nTypically, to reach y=9 at turn T, we can have at turn T-1, y=8, action U, then at turn T, y=9.\n\nOr at turn T, y=9 and action S.\n\nBut to minimize H, we probably want to arrive as soon as possible.\n\nIn the earlier plan, from τ=3 to τ=12, with y=9 at τ=12.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, action U, so at τ=12, y=9.\n\nSo for turn τ=12, y=9.\n\nActions from τ=3 to τ=11: that's 9 actions.\n\nt1=3, H-1 =11? t1 + H -1 =12, so 3 + H -1 =12, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt1 + H -1 =12, t1=3, so 3 + H -1 =12, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at t=3 to t=12? t1 to t1+H-1=3 to 12? t1+H-1=12, so actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12? But at t=12, if we take action, but we want y at t=12 to be 9.\n\nIf at t=11, y=8, action U, then y12=9.\n\nThen at turn t=12, position y12=9, and we take action a12, which could be S, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include a12.\n\nThen at t=12, y=9 before action.\n\nThen we can take S to stay, or whatever, but since we reached, S is fine.\n\nH=10 actions from t=3 to t=12.\n\nt=3 to t=12 inclusive is 10 turns? t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: that's 10 actions.\n\nIndices: from 3 to 12, that's 10 terms.\n\nYes.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=3: action D, y4=1\n\nt=4: action U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3\n\nt=6: U, y7=4\n\nt=7: U, y8=5\n\nt=8: U, y9=6\n\nt=9: U, y10=7\n\nt=10: U, y11=8\n\nt=11: U, y12=9\n\nt=12: ? but at t=12, y=9, we need to have action, but since we reached at t=12, we can take S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t=12, we specify action, but y is already 9.\n\nIn the collision, at t=12, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=12, for freeway 7 and 8, it is dangerous, but y=9, not on freeway.\n\nNow, in this sequence, when was I on dangerous rows at dangerous times?\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=5, which is freeway 5.\n\nDangerous at t=11 and t=12 for y=5.\n\nt=8 is not dangerous, safe.\n\nt=9, y=6, freeway 6, dangerous at t=11,12, but t=9 safe.\n\nt=10, y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=10 safe.\n\nt=11, y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at t=12,13,14, but t=11, not dangerous, only y=5,6 at t=11 dangerous, so safe.\n\nThen at t=11, action U, to y12=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nInstead of going down, can I go up or stay?\n\nBut at t=4, if on y=2,3,4, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nOptions: go to y=1, or y=0, or y=5? But from y=2, I can only go to y=1,2,3 at t=4.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=2 and 3 are dangerous at t=4.\n\nSo only y=1 is safe option.\n\nCan I go to y=0?\n\nIf at t=3, action D, to y=1, as before.\n\nOr action D again? At t=3, action D, y4=1.\n\nThen at t=4, if I action D again, y5=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but then I have to come back, which takes more time, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying at y=1 at t=4 is fine.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=4, I go up to y=8 at t=11, as above.\n\nt=4 to t=11: 7 turns to go from y=1 to y=8, 7 ups.\n\nThen at t=11, U to y12=9.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=9 before t=12.\n\nBut at t=3, y=2.\n\nIf I go up immediately, but at t=4, if on y=3, collision.\n\nUnless I can be not on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nBut from t=3, I can only move to y=1,2,3 at t=4.\n\ny=1 safe, others not.\n\nSo I must spend at least one turn to go to y=1 or something.\n\nMinimal to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 ups, but I have to avoid t=4 on middle rows.\n\nAfter going down, I have to go up, so from y=1 to y=9, 8 ups, 8 turns.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=11: 8 actions to go to y=12? Let's see.\n\nAt t=4, y=1\n\nAfter one U, t=5, y=2\n\nAfter two U, t=6, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter seven U, t=11, y=8\n\nThen after eighth U, t=12, y=9\n\nSo 8 actions from t=4 to t=11 to reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: 8 actions, reaching y=9 at t=12.\n\nPlus the first action at t=3: D to y=1.\n\nSo actions at t=3 to t=11: 9 actions? t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: that's 9 actions, but at t=11, y=8, action U to y12=9, so position at t=12 is 9.\n\nWe need position at t= t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =12, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=0 to H-1 relative, so H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, H actions specified.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=3, if I could go to y=9 directly, impossible.\n\nOr, can I be at y=9 at t=11?\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=11, I need to have y at t=10 be 8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 invalid, so y10=8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=8, action U to y11=9.\n\nIf y10=9, action S to stay.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=11, I need to be at high y earlier.\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nAt t=4, I must be at y=1 to avoid collision.\n\ny4=1.\n\nThen at t=4, y=1.\n\nNow, to be at y=9 at t=11, that is 7 turns later.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9 in 7 turns: I need at least 8 steps up, but 7 actions, so impossible, since each action changes y by at most 1, so in 7 actions, I can increase y by at most 7, from 1 to 8, not to 9.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=4, after first action at t=4, y5 <=2\n\nAfter second, y6<=3\n\n...\n\nAfter seventh action at t=10, y11 <= 1+7=8\n\nThen at t=11, y=8, I can U to y12=9, but at t=11, y=8 not 9.\n\nTo have y11=9, I need y10=8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=8, action U at t=10 to y11=9.\n\nBut y10=8 at t=10.\n\nFrom y4=1 at t=4, to y10=8 in 6 actions? Actions at t=4 to t=9 affect y5 to y10.\n\nAt t=4, action a4, sets y5\n\nAt t=5, a5, sets y6\n\n...\n\nAt t=9, a9, sets y10\n\nAt t=10, a10, sets y11\n\nTo have y11=9, need y10=8 or 9, and appropriate action.\n\nBut y10 is set by action at t=9.\n\nFrom y4=1, after 5 actions (t=4 to t=8), y9 can be from 1-5 to 1+5, but to maximize, y9 <=1+5=6? Let's see the range.\n\nAfter k actions from t=4, the position at time t+1.\n\nAt time τ=4, y=1\n\nAfter action a4 at τ=4, y5 is set.\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nSimilarly, y6 = y5 + Δy5 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions from τ=4, at time τ=4+m, y_{4+m} = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{3+m} Δy_i\n\nFor y at time t, it depends on actions up to t-1.\n\nTo have y10 high.\n\ny10 is position at time t=10.\n\ny10 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{9} Δy_i  ? actions from i=4 to i=9 affect y5 to y10.\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\n...\n\ny10 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nSince y4=1, y10 = 1 + sum_{k=4}^{9} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy_k in {-1,0,1}, so y10 <= 1 + 6 =7, since 6 terms: k=4,5,6,7,8,9, that's 6 actions.\n\nΔy for k from 4 to 9, 6 actions, sum <=6, so y10 <=1+6=7\n\nSimilarly, y10 >=1-6=-5, but y>=0.\n\nSo max y10=7.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=7, I can U to y11=8, or if y10=7, U to y11=8, not 9.\n\nThen at t=11, y11=8, U to y12=9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before t=12 with this start.\n\nIf I don't go down at t=3, but I have to, to avoid collision.\n\nAnother option: at t=3, instead of D, I go S, but then y4=2, which is dangerous at t=4.\n\nOr U, y4=3, dangerous.\n\nOnly D is safe.\n\nGo to y=0: at t=3, D to y4=1, then at t=4, D to y5=0, but then from y=0, it takes longer to go up.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=0, then need to go to y=9, at least 9 ups, so reach y=9 at t=14 or later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10, with sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=8, y=5, and t=11 is dangerous for y=5, but at t=8, it is fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut at t=12, I have y=9, but t=12 is dangerous for y=7,8, but I am at y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way to avoid the later dangers or something, but since I am going fast, I pass before the dangers.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, y=8, which is dangerous at t=12, but at t=11, I am at y=8 and take U, so at t=12, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nAt t=11, position y=8, which is freeway 8, but at t=11, is it dangerous?\n\nDangerous at t=11 for y=5,6 only, not for y=8.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=11, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen I move to y=9 at t=12.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower to avoid being on y=5 or6 at t=11, but in this case, I am not on y=5 or6 at t=11, I am on y=8.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=11, y=8, not 5 or6.\n\nt=11 dangerous for y=5,6, but I am on y=8, safe.\n\nThen I move.\n\nAnother thing: at t=12, if I were on y=7 or8, dangerous, but I move to y=9 before that.\n\nIn the sequence, I am never on dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nNow, but H=10.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nt1=3, start action at t=3.\n\nAfter 9 actions: actions at t=3 to t=11, position at t=12 is y=9.\n\nt= t1 + H -1 =3 + H -1\n\nSet to 12, so 3 + H -1 =12, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=11.\n\nBut earlier, impossible from y=1 at t=4.\n\nUnless I start higher.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, if I could be at y=4 or something, but I can't at t=4 without colliding.\n\nAnother idea: at t=3, I go down to y=1, but then from there, I go up faster? No, I can only go one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 via other paths, but no, since only vertical move.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions to be sure.\n\nAlso, for the later dangers, but since I pass y=5 at t=8, which is before t=11,12, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 at t=9, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=10, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=11, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nNow, but at t=12, when I am at y=9, it is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I have action at t=12? No, last action at t=11, which sets y12=9.\n\nThen at turn t=12, position y=9, but in the action sequence, we specify actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, which is a_{12} if H=10, t1+H-1=3+10-1=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, I need to specify action, which can be S, for example.\n\nBut since we reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nNow, in the collision check, at t=12, y=9, no issue.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t1=3: action D (to go to y=1)\n\nThen Turn 4: action U (to y=2)\n\nTurn 5: U (to y=3)\n\nTurn 6: U (to y=4)\n\nTurn 7: U (to y=5)\n\nTurn 8: U (to y=6)\n\nTurn 9: U (to y=7)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=8)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y=9)\n\nAt Turn 11: action U, y12=9, so at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nt1+H-1=12, y=9.\n\nNow, action at turn 12: since y=9, we can take S.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions from t=3 to t=11, but that's 9 actions, missing t=12.\n\nActions: t=3: D\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U → this sets y12=9\n\nNow, at turn t=12, position y=9, and we need to include action for turn t=12, which is a_{12}, and since y=9, we can take S.\n\nThen the sequence has 10 actions: t=3 to t=12.\n\nAt t=12, action S, but y is already 9, and S keeps it.\n\nIn terms of reaching, at t=12, we are at y=9 before action, so it is fine.\n\nThe minimal H is 10.\n\nBut can I avoid the initial down and go up later?\n\nFor example, at t=3, if I go S, but y4=2, then at t=4, collision if on y=2.\n\nBut collision occurs at turn T if on freeway and 0 in span.\n\nAt t=4, if y=2, collision.\n\nUnless I move off before, but at t=4, I am on y=2 when collision is checked.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nThus, going to y=1 is necessary.\n\nPerhaps go to y=5 directly, but I can't, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the later part, but in this case, I reach at t=12.\n\nBut t=12 is one of the dangerous times, but for y=7,8, not for y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by not going down, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother thought: at t=3, I go down to y=1, as before.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=4, I go up, but perhaps I can be slower so that when I reach y=5,6, it is not at t=11 or12.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=1 for some turns, then go up later, but that would take more turns, since I need to reach y=9, so H larger, worse.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=1 for one turn: at t=4, action S, y5=1\n\nThen at t=5, U, y6=2, and so on, then I reach y=9 later, say at t=13, H larger.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=7, y=5, which is freeway 5, but at t=7, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeway numbers.\n\ny=1: freeway 1\n\ny=2: freeway 2\n\n...\n\ny=8: freeway 8\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt t=4: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nt=5: y=2, freeway 2, at t=5, not dangerous (only t=4 dangerous), safe\n\nt=6: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nt=7: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nt=8: y=5, freeway 5, at t=8, dangerous at t=11,12, but t=8 early, safe\n\nt=9: y=6, freeway 6, similarly safe\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=10 early, safe\n\nt=11: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at t=12,13,14, but at t=11, only y=5,6 dangerous, so y=8 safe\n\nThen at t=11, action U, to y12=9\n\nAt t=12: y=9, no issue.\n\nAction at t=12: S or whatever.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify all actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence above, actions from t=3 to t=12.\n\nt=3: D\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: S  (since y=9, stay)\n\nBut at t=12, action S, y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at t=12 is y=9.\n\nWe could have no action at t=12 if we ended earlier, but we need to reach at t=12.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at t=11, y=8, and I take U to y12=9, so at t=12, y=9.\n\nIf I don't take action at t=12, but I have to include it since we specify actions up to when we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, with 10 actions, we are at y=9 at t=12.\n\nPerhaps I can have only 9 actions, ending at t=11 with y=9.\n\nBut to have y_{11}=9.\n\nStart at t=3, y=2.\n\nAt t=4, must be y=1, so action D at t=3.\n\ny4=1.\n\nThen to have y11=9.\n\ny11 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{10} Δy_i\n\ny4=1\n\ny11 = 1 + sum_{k=4 to 10} Δy_k\n\nk from 4 to 10, that's 7 actions (t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10)\n\nsum <=7, so y11 <=1+7=8\n\ny11=8 max.\n\nThen action at t=11 to set y12, but we want y11=9.\n\ny11 is position at turn 11, before action a11.\n\ny11 depends on previous actions.\n\ny11 = y4 + sum_{i=4}^{10} Δy_i? Actions from i=4 to i=10 affect y5 to y11.\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\n...\n\ny11 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 + ... + Δy10\n\ny4=1, and 7 terms: Δy4 to Δy10, so y11 = 1 + sum_{j=4}^{10} Δy_j\n\nEach |Δy|<=1, so y11 <=1+7=8\n\ny11 >=1-7=-6\n\nSo y11 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus impossible to be at y=9 at t=11 or earlier.\n\nEarliest is t=12 with y=9.\n\nThus H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the action at t=12, I put S, but since we reached, it could be anything, but S is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have the last action as U to reach, but in this case, at t=11, I U to y12=9, so at t=11, y=8, action U.\n\nThen at t=12, y=9, action S.\n\nBut in the sequence, both are included.\n\nNow, about the cars, I think I covered.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list all dangerous points.\n\nAt T=4: y=2,3,4 dangerous.\n\nT=11: y=5,6 dangerous\n\nT=12: y=5,6,7,8 dangerous (since freeway 5,6 at T=12, and freeway 7,8 at T=12)\n\nT=13: y=7,8 dangerous\n\nT=14: y=7,8 dangerous\n\nIn my sequence:\n\n- At T=4: I am at y=1, not 2,3,4, safe.\n\n- At T=11: I am at y=8, not 5 or6, safe.\n\n- At T=12: I am at y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\n- T=13,14 not relevant.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThus, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut turn 12 is t=12.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nt1=3, H=10, so up to turn 3+10-1=12.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 11, I have U, which is from y=8 to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 12, S to stay, but since we are already at y=9, it might be redundant, but we need to specify the action for that turn.\n\nIn some interpretations, we could end when we reach, but according to the task, we specify actions until we are at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTo save one turn, but impossible.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at t=3, I go down to y=1.\n\nThen at t=4, I go up to y=2, etc., same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to higher y, but no.\n\nI think it's optimal.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut in the turn numbers, it should be turn t1, etc.\n\nIn the output, it should be like \"Turn 3: a_3\" etc.\n\nAnd for turn 12, action S.\n\nSince at turn 12, we are at y=9, and S is fine.\n\nTo avoid the S, but we need an action.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nIn the initial move, I went down, but perhaps I can go to y=0, but worse.\n\nI think H=10 is correct.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut at turn 11: U, from y=8 to y=9, so at turn 12, y=9.\n\nThen turn 12: S, y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at turn 12 is y=9.\n\nWe could have the last U at turn 12, but if at turn 12, y=9, and U to 10 invalid, so cannot.\n\nIn this sequence, it works.\n\nSince we reach at turn 12, and action S is taken.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined, with \\(H = 10\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by:\n- Moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4 to avoid the collision on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 4.\n- Moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) without delay, ensuring that the player is not on dangerous freeways at dangerous times (e.g., not on \\(y = 5, 6\\) at turns 11 and 12, and not on \\(y = 7, 8\\) at turns 12, 13, 14).\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12, where no collision can occur as \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 3, move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4, avoiding collision on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4.\n- From turns 4 to 11, move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, stay (S) as the player is already at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 with no collisions, as verified against the car positions and collision rules.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways y=1 to y=8 (each row is a freeway). The player starts at y=1 (freeway 1) at turn 4.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway i at turn T (meaning y_T = i) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when moving, at turn T, if the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} (by U or D), then at turn T the player is still on y_T. So the collision check for turn T is only on the freeway y_T. The move happens and then at turn T+1 the player is on y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the state of cars at turn t1=4. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\n- For right-moving cars: the car spans from tail to head, and at time t1=4, the span is [tau, head]. Then at time T (>=t1), the car's position is: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n- For left-moving cars: the car spans from head to tail? Actually, the update rule says for left-moving: span at t1 is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But note that in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\" for all. So we don't have any left-moving cars.\n\nTherefore, for every car, we can compute the span at turn T (>=4) as:\n\n  [ tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4) ]\n\nBut note: in the table, the cars are given in the format (head, tail, direction, speed). Since direction is right, then the car at time 4 is [tail, head] (because for right-moving, the update rule says: [tau, head] becomes [tau + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4)]). However, looking at the data:\n\n  Freeway 1: (60,49,right,3) -> so head=60, tail=49? Then the span at time 4 is [49,60]? But the update rule for right says: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, d, s) with d='right', the initial span at t1=4 is [tau, h]. Then at time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-4), h + s*(T-4)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car we would have [h, tau] and then [h - s*(T-4), tau - s*(T-4)].\n\nBut all given cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, we have:\n\n  initial_span = [tail, head]   at time 4.\n\nThen at time T (>=4): \n  car_span(T) = [ tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4) ]\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T: if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [ tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4) ].\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) starting at turn 4 (t=0 in our sequence index) that moves the player from y=1 to y=9, avoiding collisions and minimizing H (the number of turns).\n\nConstraints on y: y must be in [0,9]. So if at y=0 and we try to go down (D), we stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9, we cannot go up (U) beyond 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe start at turn 4 at y=1.\n\nWe can model this as a state space search where state is (turn, y). The turn starts at 4 and increases. We are to find the minimal H such that at turn (4 + H - 1) we are at y=9? \n\nNote: the sequence of actions is from turn t1 (4) to turn t1+H-1. The state at turn t1 is (4,1). Then we take an action at turn 4 and move to state at turn 5: (5, y5). Then at turn5 we take an action and so on until at some turn T we have y_T=9. Then H = T - 4 + 1? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_4\n  t=1: a_5\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{4+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that after the last action (at turn 4+H-1) we are at (0,9). So the state after the last action is at turn (4+H) with y=9? \n\nBut note: the action at turn t determines the position at turn t+1. So:\n\n  At turn t1=4: position is (0, y4) = (0,1)\n  Then we choose a4: \n      if a4 = U, then y5 = y4+1 = 2\n      if a4 = D, then y5 = 0 (because we started at 1 -> 1-1=0)\n      if a4 = S, then y5 = 1\n\nWe want that at some turn T (which is the turn when we take the last action) we have that the next state (at turn T+1) is (0,9). But note that the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me clarify: \n  Turn index: \n    t1 = 4: we are at y4 = 1.\n    Then we take action a4 at turn 4 -> this leads to y5.\n    Then at turn 5, we take action a5 -> leads to y6.\n    ...\n    At turn t = t1 + (H-1) = 4 + H - 1, we take an action a_{4+H-1}. Then after that action, we are at y_{4+H}? \n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 4+H-1) we are at (0,9). So that means that at the moment we are about to take the action at turn 4+H-1, we are at (0,9). However, that doesn't make sense because the action at turn 4+H-1 would then change the position? \n\nLet me read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But note that the position at turn t is the position at the start of the turn. Then we choose an action for that turn, and then we update to the next position.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we don't require to take an action at the turn when we are at 9? \n\nHowever, note the sequence of actions is taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. So the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we have:\n\n  After the action at turn t1+H-1, we have the position at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we are to have the position at turn t1+H-1 be 9. This implies that we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But that action might move us away? \n\nRe-read the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the condition is: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? But that action might move us to 8 or 10 (but 10 is invalid so it would become 9) or stay? However, note that the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to be at 9 at the start of that turn. But the minimal H would be achieved when we first reach 9 at the start of a turn. \n\nBut note: we might have to wait (by using S) at 9? However, the problem does not require to stay, only to reach. So we can stop the sequence at the turn when we first get to 9.\n\nHowever, the sequence of actions must be provided for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. And at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. How did we get to 9? The last action that got us to 9 was taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nLet me write:\n\n  Turn 4: start at y4=1 -> take action a4 -> then y5 = y4 + delta(a4)\n  Turn 5: start at y5 -> take a5 -> y6 = y5 + delta(a5)\n  ...\n  Turn T: start at yT -> take aT -> y_{T+1} = yT + delta(aT)\n\nWe require that at turn T = t1 + H - 1 = 4 + H - 1, we have y_T = 9.\n\nSo T = 4 + H - 1 -> H = T - 3.\n\nBut how did we get to y_T=9? It must be that at turn T-1 we were at y_{T-1} and then we took an action at turn T-1 that led to y_T=9? But wait: the position at turn T is the result of the action taken at turn T-1. Therefore, to be at 9 at turn T, the action taken at turn T-1 must have moved us to 9. \n\nBut note: at turn T we are about to take an action. The problem says that the sequence of actions includes the action at turn T? \n\nYes: the sequence is a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. And H is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions. \n\nTherefore, if we are at 9 at turn T, then we have taken H = T - 4 + 1 actions? \n\nBecause:\n  Action at turn 4: first action (index0) -> leads to y5\n  ...\n  Action at turn T: the last action in the sequence? \n\nBut note: the sequence is defined for t from 0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0} = a_4\n  a_{t1+1} = a_5\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} = a_{4+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 4+H-1) we are at (0,9). So at the start of turn 4+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take the last action a_{4+H-1}. But after that action, we are at y_{4+H}. However, we don't care about what happens after we reach 9? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So the last action is taken at the turn when we are already at 9? \n\nThis seems odd because we could have reached 9 at an earlier turn and then we are just taking an extra action at 9. But that would not be minimal. Therefore, the minimal sequence should end at the turn when we first arrive at 9.\n\nHow do we represent that? \n\nWe want the smallest H such that there is a sequence of H actions (from turn4 to turn4+H-1) that results in the player being at y=9 at the start of turn4+H-1. \n\nBut note: the state at turn4+H-1 is the result of the previous H-1 actions? \n\nLet me define:\n\n  Let T = turn index, starting at T0 = 4.\n  We are at y4 = 1.\n  After 0 actions: at T=4, y4=1.\n  After 1 action (a4): at T=5, y5 = y4 + delta(a4).\n  After 2 actions: at T=6, y6 = y5 + delta(a5) = y4 + delta(a4) + delta(a5).\n  ...\n  After k actions: at T=4+k, y_{4+k} = 1 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} delta(a_{4+i})\n\nWe require that at T = 4 + (H-1) we are at y=9? \n\nThat is: at turn T = 4 + H - 1, we have y_{4+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut the position at T=4+H-1 is the result of the previous H-1 actions? \n\nActually, the position at turn T is determined by the actions taken from turn4 to turn T-1. \n\nSo if we are at turn T=4+H-1, then we have taken (4+H-1) - 4 = H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is of length H. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let H be the number of actions. Then:\n\n  Turn 4: before any action, at y4=1.\n  Then we take H actions: a4, a5, ..., a_{4+H-1}.\n  The position after these H actions is at turn 4+H: y_{4+H} = 1 + sum_{t=0}^{H-1} delta(a_{4+t})\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 4+H-1.\n\nSo at turn 4+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take the last action a_{4+H-1} at that turn? Then after that action we move to y_{4+H}. \n\nBut we don't require y_{4+H} to be 9? We only require that at the start of turn 4+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo the last action a_{4+H-1} is taken when we are at 9. That action might move us away? But then we are at 9 at the start of that turn, so we have reached the goal at the start of that turn. The action taken at that turn is part of the sequence, but we don't care what happens after? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". So we are counting the actions. We want the smallest H such that at the start of turn 4+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nHow many actions have we taken by the start of turn 4+H-1? \n\nAt the start of turn4: 0 actions taken, at y4=1.\nAt the start of turn5: we have taken 1 action (a4), and we are at y5.\n...\nAt the start of turn T: we have taken T-4 actions, and we are at y_T.\n\nWe require at the start of turn T: y_T=9.\n\nThen the number of actions taken to get to that state is T-4. But the sequence of actions we are to provide is for the turns from 4 to T-1? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, and we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo: \n  T = t1 + H - 1 = 4 + H - 1.\n  And we require y_{4+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe number of actions taken to get to turn 4+H-1 is (4+H-1) - 4 = H-1. But the sequence has H actions? \n\nThis implies that the last action (the H-th action) is taken at turn 4+H-1? \n\nBut at the start of turn 4+H-1 we are already at 9. Then we take an action at that turn. That action is included in the sequence. \n\nSo the minimal H must be at least the number of turns from 4 to the first time we are at 9, and then we include an action at that turn. \n\nBut that action at the turn when we are at 9 is not necessary? However, the problem requires a sequence of H actions. \n\nWe must provide exactly H actions. And after the last action, we have that at the start of turn 4+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nWait, no: the condition is that at turn 4+H-1 (which is the turn at which we take the last action) we are at 9. But at the start of that turn we are at 9, and then we take the action. \n\nSo we are allowed to take an action at the goal? \n\nBut note: the collision condition: at turn 4+H-1, we are at y=9. Then we must check for collision at freeway 9? However, the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player at y=9 is not on any freeway? \n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y=1,...,8\". So if the player is at y=9, then there are no cars on that row? So no collision. \n\nSimilarly, at y=0, there are no cars? \n\nTherefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9). So we are safe at the goal.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that after H-1 actions we are at 9 at the start of the H-th action? \n\nThat is: \n  After k actions, we are at turn 4+k (start of turn 4+k) at position y_{4+k}.\n  We require that at the start of turn 4+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we require k = H-1 actions to have been taken to get to y_{4+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal integer such that we can be at 9 at the start of turn 4+H-1, meaning that we have taken H-1 actions to get there.\n\nBut then we must take one more action at turn 4+H-1? \n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions. The last action is taken at the turn when we are at 9. \n\nSo we can take any action at that turn? Because we are at 9 and we are safe. We can choose S (stay) to remain at 9? \n\nBut the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to reach at that turn. So we can choose any action? However, if we choose U at y=9, we stay at 9 (because it's the top). Similarly, D would take us to 8. But we don't care about the position after the last action? \n\nBut note: the condition is only that at the start of turn 4+H-1 we are at 9. After the action we might leave, but that doesn't matter. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at the start of turn 4+H-1. Then we take an action. \n\nSo to minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can get to 9 at the start of turn 4+H-1. \n\nThe minimal number of moves (actions) to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves (if we always go up). But we have obstacles (cars) so we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut note: we can also go down to 0 and then up? But that would take more moves. So ideally we go up.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at freeways 1 to 8 at the moment we are on them.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nSince H is minimal, we can do a BFS over states (turn, y) and simulate the cars at that turn to check for collision.\n\nThe state: (T, y) where T is the current turn (starting at 4 and increasing) and y in {0,1,...,9}.\n\nWe start at (4,1). We want to reach a state (T,9) for the smallest T. Then H = T - 4 + 1? \n\nBut note: we are to output the actions from turn4 to turn T. The number of actions is T-4. But the condition is that at turn T we are at 9. The sequence of actions is for turn4, turn5, ... turn T. So that's T-3 actions? \n\nWait, let me count:\n\n  Turn4: first action -> leads to state at turn5? But no, at the start of turn4 we are at (4,1). Then we choose an action for turn4 -> that leads to the state at turn5? \n\nBut we are to be at 9 at the start of turn T. So the state (T,9) is our goal. How many actions have we taken to get there? From turn4 to turnT: we have taken T-4 actions. \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is of length H, and we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 4+H-1. Therefore, we set T = 4+H-1, so H = T-3? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: we want to be at 9 at the start of turn T. Then H = T-3? \n\nBut let me see:\n\n  T = 4: start at (4,1). We haven't taken any action -> we need to take actions to get to 9.\n  T = 5: we are at y5 -> we have taken 1 action.\n  ...\n  T: we are at yT -> we have taken T-4 actions.\n\nWe require yT=9. Then the number of actions taken is T-4. But the problem says the sequence has H actions and we are at 9 at turn 4+H-1. So:\n\n  4+H-1 = T  => H = T-3.\n\nBut then the number of actions is T-4 = H-1? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n  and \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo H is defined as the minimal number of turns. And the sequence is for H actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAnd at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). To get there, we have taken (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1 actions. \n\nBut the sequence has H actions? \n\nYes, because we also take an action at turn t1+H-1. So the last action is taken at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal integer such that we can get to 9 at the start of turn 4+H-1 by taking H-1 actions, and then we take an additional action at that turn.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at 9 at the start of that turn, so the last action doesn't help in reaching 9? It's just an extra action we are forced to take? \n\nThis would mean that we are counting the action taken at the goal as part of the sequence. But that might not be minimal in terms of time? \n\nFor example, if we can get to 9 at the start of turn 10, then H-1 = 10-4 = 6, so H=7? But then we are taking 7 actions and we are at 9 at the start of the 7th action (which is turn 4+6=10). Then we take the 7th action at turn10.\n\nBut if we can get to 9 at turn10, then we don't need to wait until turn10 to take the last action? We could stop at turn10 without taking an action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nSo to minimize H, we want to minimize the turn at which we first reach 9, say at turn T, then set H = T-3? \n\nAlternatively, note that T = 4+H-1 -> H = T-3.\n\nAnd the number of actions is H = T-3.\n\nBut the number of actions taken to get to 9 is T-4 (from turn4 to turnT: T-4 actions). Then we take one more action at turnT? \n\nBut wait, the sequence of actions is defined for turns from 4 to 4+H-1 = T. So we take an action at turn T. \n\nBut to get to 9 at the start of turn T, we took actions at turns 4,5,...,T-1 -> that's (T-1)-4+1 = T-4 actions. Then at turn T, we take the H-th action? \n\nBut H = T-3, so the total number of actions is T-3. Therefore, we have T-4 actions to get to 9 and then we take one action at turn T? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me try an example without obstacles.\n\nExample: start at y=1 at turn4. We want to get to y=9. The minimal moves: 8 up moves. \n\nHow many turns does it take? \n\n  Turn4: start at1 -> we take action U at turn4 -> at turn5 we are at2.\n  Turn5: U -> turn6:3\n  ...\n  Turn11: U -> turn12:9.\n\nSo at the start of turn12, we are at9. Then we must take an action at turn12? \n\nThen T = 12. Then H = 12-3 = 9. \n\nBut we took 8 up moves to get to9 at turn12. Then we take a 9th action at turn12. \n\nBut the problem requires the sequence to have H=9 actions. And we are at9 at the start of turn12 (which is 4+9-1=12). \n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  ...\n  Turn11: U -> that's 8 actions? Then we need one more action at turn12? \n\nBut wait, the sequence is for t from0 to8: \n  a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12.\n\nBut we only need 8 actions to get to9 at turn12. The action at turn12 is extra. \n\nBut note: after the 8th action (at turn11) we are at turn12 at y=9. Then the problem requires that at turn12 (which is t1+H-1 = 4+9-1=12) we are at9. Then we output an action for turn12.\n\nWe can choose any action for turn12? Since we are at9, and we are safe. We can choose S.\n\nSo the minimal H in this case is 9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? \n\nWe would require to be at9 at turn4+8-1=11. \n\nThat means at the start of turn11, we are at9. \n\nHow many actions to get to9 by turn11? \n\n  We need to move from1 to9: 8 moves. \n  Actions taken at turn4,5,...,10 (7 actions) -> then at turn11 we are at y11 = 1 + 7*? -> if we did 7 up moves, we are at8 at turn11. \n\nSo we cannot be at9 at turn11 with only 7 actions. \n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nBut note: we could have moved faster? No, because we can only move one step per action.\n\nSo without obstacles, H=9.\n\nWith obstacles, we might need to wait sometimes, so H might be larger.\n\nWe need to simulate the cars and see when the freeways are safe.\n\nWe'll do a BFS in terms of the state (turn, y). The turn can go up to a certain limit. Since the cars move and eventually their spans might not cover 0, but we have multiple cars and freeways.\n\nWe start at (4,1). We want to reach (T,9) for the smallest T. Then H = T-3, and the sequence has H = T-3 actions: from turn4 to turn T (because the last action is at turn T, and T = 4+H-1 = 4+(T-3)-1 = T, so that matches).\n\nSteps:\n\n  Let state = (turn, y). \n  We start at (4,1). \n  We consider actions U, D, S (if applicable: at y=0, D is equivalent to S; at y=9, U is equivalent to S).\n\n  For each action, the next state is (turn+1, y') where:\n      if U: y' = min(y+1, 9)\n      if D: y' = max(y-1, 0)\n      if S: y' = y\n\n  But before we move to (turn+1, y'), we must check if the current state (turn, y) is safe? \n\n  However, note: collision happens at turn T only if we are on a freeway y_T in [1,8] and there is a car on that freeway at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n  So at state (turn, y), we check:\n      if y is in [1,8] (freeway), then we check all cars on freeway y at turn 'turn'. \n          For each car on freeway y: \n              span = [ tail + s*(turn-4), head + s*(turn-4) ]\n          if 0 is in [tail + s*(turn-4), head + s*(turn-4)] for any car, then collision -> invalid state.\n\n      If y is 0 or 9, then no collision.\n\n  But note: we are at (turn,y) at the start of turn 'turn'. Then we are about to take an action. The collision condition is checked at the start of the turn? \n\n  The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\n  So we must check the state (turn,y) for collision.\n\n  Therefore, when we are at (turn,y), if y in [1,8] and there is a car on that freeway at turn 'turn' that has 0 in its span, then we cannot be at that state.\n\n  So we simulate:\n\n      Start: (4,1): check freeway1 at turn4.\n\n      Then we choose an action, which leads to (5,y5). Then at (5,y5) we check for collision.\n\n  So the next state (turn+1, y') must be checked for collision at turn+1? \n\n  But note: the action is taken at turn 'turn', and then we move to the next state (turn+1, y'). The collision at turn 'turn' was already checked at the beginning of the turn? \n\n  Actually, we are at (turn,y) at the start of turn 'turn'. Then we choose an action. During the turn, we are on freeway y at turn 'turn', so we must be safe at that moment. Then after the action, we move to y' at turn+1.\n\n  Therefore, when we are at state (turn,y), we must first check that (turn,y) is safe (no collision). Then we choose an action that leads to (turn+1, y'), and then at (turn+1,y') we will check again.\n\n  So the initial state (4,1) must be safe. Then we generate next states.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      Let dist[turn][y] = minimal number of actions taken to reach (turn,y) [or we can store the previous action and turn]\n\n      We do BFS by increasing turn.\n\n      We start: (4,1) with 0 actions.\n\n      Then for each state (turn, y), if (turn,y) is safe, then we consider the next actions:\n\n          For each action a in {U, D, S}:\n              y_next = \n                  if a=='U': min(y+1,9)\n                  if a=='D': max(y-1,0)\n                  if a=='S': y\n\n              next_state = (turn+1, y_next)\n\n          If we haven't visited (turn+1, y_next) with a lower or equal number of actions, and if at (turn+1,y_next) we will check for safety (at turn+1) in the next step? \n\n          But note: we don't know yet if (turn+1,y_next) is safe until we check. So we will check when we pop it.\n\n      We stop when we reach a state (turn,9). Then H = turn - 3 (because we want to be at 9 at turn T, then H = T-3, and the sequence has H actions: from turn4 to turn T).\n\n      But note: the sequence of actions is the path from (4,1) to (turn,9). The number of actions is (turn - 4). But then we set H = turn - 3? \n\n      How many actions are in the sequence? It should be H. And we are at turn T = turn, and we require T = 4+H-1 -> H = turn-3.\n\n      But the number of actions we took to get to (turn,9) is turn-4. Then we haven't taken an action at turn T? \n\n      Actually, the last action we took was at turn T-1, which brought us to (T,9). Then we are at (T,9) and we have taken T-4 actions. But we need to output H actions, so we are missing one.\n\n      Therefore, we must continue? \n\n      But note: we are at (T,9) and we want to be at 9 at turn T, and then we must take an action at turn T. \n\n      So we need to extend the sequence by one action at turn T. \n\n      How do we account for that in BFS? \n\n      We can consider that the goal is to be at (T,9) and then we take an action at turn T (any action) and then we are done. \n\n      So the minimal T such that we can be at 9 at the start of turn T. Then the sequence of actions is the actions from turn4 to turn T. The actions from turn4 to turn T-1 get us to (T,9), and then the last action is at turn T. \n\n      Therefore, the total number of actions H = T-3, and we output the actions for turn4 to turn T.\n\n      So we can run BFS until we find a state (T,9) for the smallest T. Then H = T-3. \n\n      Then we need to reconstruct the sequence of actions: from turn4 to turn T (inclusive). \n\n      How many actions? From turn4 to turn T: that's T-4+1 = T-3 = H actions. \n\n      Example: T=7: actions at turn4,5,6,7 -> 4 actions, and H=7-3=4.\n\n      Then the condition: at turn t1+H-1 = 4+4-1=7, we are at (0,9). Correct.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          We are searching for the smallest T (>=4) such that (T,9) is reachable.\n\n          Then H = T-3.\n\n          The sequence: the actions taken at turns 4,5,...,T.\n\n      But note: the action at turn T is taken at the state (T,9). Then we move to (T+1, y_next), but we don't care. \n\n      How do we reconstruct the actions? \n\n      We store for each state (turn,y) the action that we took to get there from the previous state? Actually, we store the predecessor and the action that led to (turn,y).\n\n      Specifically, we can store:\n\n          prev[turn][y] = (previous_turn, previous_y, action_taken_at_previous_turn)\n\n      But note: the action taken at turn 'previous_turn' led from (previous_turn, previous_y) to (previous_turn+1, y). \n\n      However, we are at (T,9). The action that got us to (T,9) was taken at turn T-1. And then we need to choose an action at turn T.\n\n      But the problem requires the sequence of actions from turn4 to turn T. So we need to output the action for turn T as well. \n\n      Since we are at (T,9), we can choose any safe action? Actually, we are at y=9, so no collision. We can choose S (stay) to be safe. \n\n      Therefore, we can arbitrarily choose S for the last action.\n\n      But note: we might have multiple paths. But the BFS will find the minimal T. Then we reconstruct the actions from turn4 to turn T-1 from the path, and then we add an action S (or any) at turn T.\n\n      However, the last action doesn't matter as long as we are at 9 at the start of turn T. So we can always choose S.\n\n      So the plan:\n\n          Run BFS starting from (4,1). \n          For each state (turn, y), we check if it is safe (if y in [1,8], check cars on freeway y at turn 'turn').\n          If safe, then expand to next states (turn+1, y_next) for y_next from {y-1, y, y+1} (clamped to [0,9]).\n          We mark the minimal turn when we first reach y=9.\n\n          Then H = T - 3 (where T is the turn when we first reach 9).\n\n          Then we reconstruct the path: \n                actions[4] to actions[T-1]: the actions that led from (4,1) to (T,9)\n                actions[T] = S (or we could choose U or D? But at y=9, U and D are equivalent to S? Actually, U would be clamped to 9, D to 8? But we don't care about the next state. However, the problem does not specify any penalty for not staying, so we can choose any. But to be clean, we choose S.\n\n          Then output the actions from turn4 to turn T.\n\n      But note: the action at turn T is the last in the sequence. \n\n      However, the path reconstruction from BFS will give us the actions for turns 4 to T-1. Then we add an action for turn T.\n\n      Alternatively, we can store the entire path including the last action. But the last action (at turn T) is not part of the path that got us to (T,9) but an extra.\n\n      So we do:\n\n          Find T_min = minimal T such that (T,9) is safe and reachable.\n\n          Then the number of actions to get to (T,9) is T-4 (actions taken at turns4 to T-1). Then we add one action at turn T.\n\n          Total actions: H = T-3.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Let Q be a queue of (turn, y)\n          dist[turn][y] = something (we don't care about dist, we care about the path and minimal T)\n\n          We start: \n                Q.push((4,1))\n                parent[4][1] = None\n\n          While Q not empty:\n                (turn, y) = Q.pop()\n                if y==9: \n                    T_min = turn\n                    break\n\n                Check if (turn,y) is safe? \n                    If not, skip.\n\n                For each action a in [U,D,S]:\n                    y_next = move(y,a)\n                    next_turn = turn+1\n                    If (next_turn, y_next) not visited, and if we have not encountered a state with a smaller turn for y_next? Actually, we want minimal turn, so we can break ties by turn. We only visit each (turn,y) once because we do BFS by increasing turn.\n\n                Then we push (next_turn, y_next) and record parent: \n                    parent[next_turn][y_next] = (turn, y, a)   # meaning from (turn,y) we took action a to get to (next_turn, y_next)\n\n          Then after we break at (T_min,9), we reconstruct:\n\n                actions = []\n                We want the actions taken at turns4 to T_min.\n\n                But note: the path we stored is from (4,1) to (T_min,9) via actions taken at turns4 to T_min-1.\n\n                So the actions for turn4 to turn T_min-1 are stored. Then we need to add an action for turn T_min.\n\n          So:\n\n                current = (T_min,9)\n                path_actions = []\n                while current != (4,1):\n                    (turn, y) = current\n                    (prev_turn, prev_y, a) = parent[turn][y]\n                    path_actions.append( (prev_turn, a) )   # at turn 'prev_turn' we took action a to get to 'turn'\n                    current = (prev_turn, prev_y)\n\n                Then we reverse path_actions: this gives the actions at turns: 4,5,...,T_min-1.\n\n                Then we add an action at turn T_min: we choose S.\n\n                Then the sequence is: \n                    Turn4: a4 (from path_actions[0])\n                    Turn5: a5 (from path_actions[1])\n                    ...\n                    Turn T_min-1: a_{T_min-1} (last in path_actions)\n                    Turn T_min: S\n\n          Then H = T_min-3.\n\n      But note: the sequence has H = T_min-3 actions. And the turns: \n          turn4: first action -> a4\n          turn5: a5\n          ...\n          turn T_min: last action -> a_{T_min} = S\n\n          And the number of actions = (T_min - 4) [from turn4 to T_min-1] + 1 [for turn T_min] = T_min-3 = H.\n\n      Example: T_min=7: \n          actions: \n              turn4: a4\n              turn5: a5\n              turn6: a6\n              turn7: S\n          That's 4 actions, and H=7-3=4.\n\n      But note: we are at 9 at the start of turn7. Then we take action S at turn7 -> we remain at9. \n\n      However, the problem condition is satisfied: at turn7 (which is 4+4-1=7) we are at (0,9).\n\n  But wait: the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. \n      t0: t=0 -> a_{4+0}=a4\n      t=1: a5\n      t=2: a6\n      t=3: a7 (which is S)\n\n      So that's correct.\n\nNow, we need to simulate the cars.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn4. For each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway:\n\n  (head, tail, direction, speed) \n\nSince direction is always 'right', we use:\n\n  at turn T (>=4): \n      span = [ tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4) ]\n\nWe must check if 0 is in [tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4)] for any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nNote: the freeway k is fixed per row.\n\nWe are given:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (60,49,right,3) -> at turn T: [49+3*(T-4), 60+3*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 2: three cars: \n   (0,-11,right,12) -> [ -11+12*(T-4), 0+12*(T-4) ]\n   (36,25,right,12) -> [25+12*(T-4), 36+12*(T-4)]\n   (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59+12*(T-4), -48+12*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? \n   (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway4: same\n\nFreeway5: (-42,-53,right,6) -> [-53+6*(T-4), -42+6*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5.\n\nFreeway7: (-32,-43,right,4) -> [-43+4*(T-4), -32+4*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7.\n\nWe need to check for a given (turn, y) if y is in [1,8] and then for each car on that freeway, check if 0 is in the interval.\n\nNote: the intervals are continuous. We can compute for each car at turn T the interval and check if 0 is between the lower and upper bound.\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head is the right end? Actually, the update rule says: [tail + s*(T-4), head + s*(T-4)]. So the interval is [L, R] with L<=R.\n\nSo we can check: if L <= 0 <= R.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and for each car the times T when 0 is in the car's span? But the cars move continuously, so for each car we can solve:\n\n  L(T) = tail + s*(T-4)\n  R(T) = head + s*(T-4)\n\n  Then 0 is in [L(T), R(T)] if and only if:\n        L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n        => tail + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-4)\n\n  Solve for T:\n\n        T >= ( -tail ) / s + 4\n        T <= ( -head ) / s + 4   ??? \n\n  Actually:\n\n        tail + s*(T-4) <= 0  => s*(T-4) <= -tail  => T-4 <= -tail/s  => T <= 4 - tail/s\n\n        and \n\n        head + s*(T-4) >= 0  => s*(T-4) >= -head  => T-4 >= -head/s  => T >= 4 - head/s\n\n  But note: because tail and head are integers and s is integer, and T is integer? Actually, T is integer.\n\n  But note: the head and tail can be negative? Yes.\n\n  However, we have to be careful: for the car (0,-11,12): \n        L(T) = -11+12*(T-4)\n        R(T) = 0+12*(T-4)\n\n        We want: -11+12*(T-4) <= 0 <= 12*(T-4)\n\n        => 12*(T-4) >= 0  => T>=4\n        and -11+12*(T-4) <= 0 => 12*(T-4) <= 11 => T-4 <= 11/12 => T-4 <= 0.916... => T<=4.916...\n\n        So T=4: \n            L(4)= -11, R(4)=0 -> 0 in [-11,0] -> so at T=4, 0 is in the span.\n\n        T=5: \n            L(5)= -11+12=1, R(5)=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, for the car (36,25,12) at freeway2:\n            L(T)=25+12*(T-4)\n            R(T)=36+12*(T-4)\n            We need 25+12*(T-4) <= 0 <= 36+12*(T-4)\n            But 25+12*(T-4) is at least 25 at T=4, which is >0 -> so never?\n\n        Similarly, car (-48,-59,12): \n            L(T)=-59+12*(T-4)\n            R(T)=-48+12*(T-4)\n            We need -59+12*(T-4) <= 0 <= -48+12*(T-4)\n            => 0 <= -48+12*(T-4) -> 12*(T-4)>=48 -> T-4>=4 -> T>=8\n            and -59+12*(T-4) <=0 -> 12*(T-4)<=59 -> T-4<=59/12=4.916 -> T<=8.916 -> so only at T=8.\n\n        So at freeway2:\n            T=4: car1: 0 in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n            T=5: safe? \n                car1: [ -11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n                car2: [25+12=37, 36+12=48] -> no\n                car3: [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36]? \n            T=6: \n                car1: [ -11+24=13, 0+24=24] -> safe\n                car2: [25+24=49, 36+24=60] -> safe\n                car3: [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe\n            T=7: safe\n            T=8: car3: [-59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        Therefore, freeway2 is unsafe at T=4,8, and safe at T=5,6,7,9,...\n\n  Similarly, we can compute for each freeway the set of turns when it is unsafe.\n\nBut note: the unsafe condition is if at least one car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 4 to a limit) whether the freeway is safe.\n\nWe set a limit for T. Since we are doing BFS and we want the minimal T, and the minimal T is at least 4 and at most? \n\nThe player moves at most 1 per turn, so from 1 to 9: at least 8 turns -> T_min at least 12? But with obstacles, we might need to wait. \n\nThe cars move with positive speed, so eventually they will pass 0 and never come back? But note: the freeway might have multiple cars and they might come periodically? \n\nBut the cars move continuously and the grid is infinite? So each car only covers 0 for a contiguous set of turns? \n\nWe can compute the unsafe intervals for each freeway:\n\n  For a car: \n        T_low = ceil( ( -head ) / s + 4 )   ??? \n        Actually, from above:\n\n          0 in [tail+s*(T-4), head+s*(T-4)] \n          <=> \n          tail+s*(T-4) <= 0 <= head+s*(T-4)\n\n          <=> \n          ( -head ) / s <= T-4 <= ( -tail ) / s\n\n        But note: since head and tail are integers and s is integer, and T is integer, we can compute:\n\n          T_min_car = ceil( 4 - head/s )\n          T_max_car = floor( 4 - tail/s )\n\n        But wait: \n\n          We have: \n            s*(T-4) >= -head   => T-4 >= ceil(-head/s)   ??? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n          T-4 >= ceil( (-head) / s )   ? But if we have negative head, then -head is positive.\n\n        Let me try with car1 on freeway2: head=0, tail=-11, s=12.\n\n          Condition: \n            tail+s*(T-4) <= 0  -> -11+12*(T-4) <=0 -> T-4 <= 11/12 -> T-4 <= 0.916 -> T<=4.916 -> so T<=4 (since T integer) -> T=4? \n\n          and \n            head+s*(T-4) >=0 -> 0+12*(T-4)>=0 -> T>=4.\n\n          So T=4.\n\n        So the unsafe interval for this car is T=4.\n\n        Another example: car3 on freeway2: head=-48, tail=-59, s=12.\n\n          Condition1: tail+s*(T-4) <=0 -> -59+12*(T-4)<=0 -> 12*(T-4)<=59 -> T-4<=59/12=4.916 -> T<=8.916 -> T<=8 (integer)\n          Condition2: head+s*(T-4)>=0 -> -48+12*(T-4)>=0 -> 12*(T-4)>=48 -> T-4>=4 -> T>=8.\n\n          So only T=8.\n\n        So for each car, the unsafe turns are the integers T in [ T_low, T_high] where:\n\n          T_low = ceil( ( -head ) / s + 4 )   -> but wait: head+s*(T-4)>=0 -> s*(T-4)>=-head -> T-4 >= ceil(-head/s)  ??? \n\n          Actually, we have:\n\n            T-4 >= ceil( (-head) / s )   ? \n\n          But (-head) is positive if head is negative.\n\n          However, let me write:\n\n            head + s*(T-4) >= 0 \n            => s*(T-4) >= -head\n\n            If s>0, then T-4 >= ceil( (-head) / s )   ??? \n\n          Example: head=-48, s=12: \n            -head = 48\n            48/12 = 4 -> so T-4>=4 -> T>=8.\n\n          Condition1: tail+s*(T-4)<=0 \n            => s*(T-4) <= -tail\n            => T-4 <= floor( (-tail) / s )   ??? \n\n          tail=-59 -> -tail=59 -> 59/12 = 4.916 -> floor=4 -> T-4<=4 -> T<=8.\n\n          So T in [8,8] -> T=8.\n\n        Therefore, for a car, the unsafe turns T are integers such that:\n\n          T_min = ceil( 4 + (-head)/s )   [if head is negative, then (-head) is positive]\n          T_max = floor( 4 + (-tail)/s )\n\n          But note: if head is positive, then -head is negative, and the condition head+s*(T-4)>=0 becomes easier? \n\n          Example: head=60, tail=49, s=3 (freeway1 car): \n            Condition1: 49+3*(T-4)<=0 -> 3*(T-4)<=-49 -> T-4<=-49/3≈-16.33 -> T<=-12.33 -> no solution? \n            Condition2: 60+3*(T-4)>=0 -> always true for T>=4.\n\n          So no unsafe turn? \n\n        Actually, the car is at [49+3*(T-4), 60+3*(T-4)] and at T=4: [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]. Then as T increases, the car moves to the right, so 0 is never in the interval.\n\n        So the condition for head>0 and tail>0: \n          Condition1: tail+s*(T-4)<=0 -> T-4 <= -tail/s -> negative -> no solution for T>=4.\n\n        So unsafe interval is empty.\n\n        Similarly, if head<0 and tail<0, we get the interval as above.\n\n        If tail<=0<=head: then the car covers 0 at T=4? \n\n          Example: tail=-1, head=1: then at T=4: [-1,1] -> 0 in.\n\n        But note: our car on freeway2: tail=-11, head=0 -> then 0 is the head. So 0 is included.\n\n        So the formula:\n\n          The car is unsafe at T if and only if:\n\n            max( ceil(4 - head/s), 4 )  <= T <= floor(4 - tail/s)\n\n          But we have to consider T>=4.\n\n        Actually, we can compute:\n\n          T must be at least T1 = ceil( ( -head ) / s + 4 )   ??? \n\n          But note: head+s*(T-4)>=0  => T>= ceil( ( -head ) / s ) + 4? \n\n          Example: head=-48, s=12: -head=48 -> 48/12=4 -> ceil(48/12)=4 -> T>=4+4=8? \n\n          But we have T>=8.\n\n          And T<= floor( ( -tail ) / s ) + 4? \n\n          tail=-59: -tail=59 -> 59/12=4.916 -> floor=4 -> T<=4+4=8.\n\n          So T in [8,8].\n\n        But wait: if head is positive, then -head is negative, then ceil(-head/s) is negative, then T>= ceil(...)+4 might be negative -> so we set T>=4.\n\n        So:\n\n          T_min = max(4, ceil(4 - head/s))   # because: T-4 >= ceil( (-head)/s )  -> T>= ceil( (-head)/s ) + 4, but if (-head)/s is negative, then ceil is negative, then T>=4.\n\n          T_max = floor(4 - tail/s)   # because: T-4 <= (-tail)/s -> T<= 4 + (-tail)/s, then floor.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the upper bound: tail+s*(T-4)<=0 -> T-4 <= -tail/s -> T<=4 - tail/s.\n\n        Since tail is negative, -tail/s is positive.\n\n        But then T must be an integer in [T_min, T_max].\n\n        Example: freeway1 car: head=60, tail=49, s=3:\n            T_min = max(4, ceil(4 - 60/3)) = ceil(4-20)=ceil(-16)= -16? -> then T_min=4? \n            T_max = floor(4 - 49/3) = floor(4-16.333)=floor(-12.333)=-13 -> so no T in [4, -13] -> empty.\n\n        So we can compute for each car the unsafe turns as the integer T in [T_low, T_high] where:\n\n            T_low = ceil(4 + max( (-head)/s, 0 ) )? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid floating point and use integer arithmetic.\n\n        We have:\n\n          head + s*(T-4) >= 0  =>  s*(T-4) >= -head\n\n          If head <=0, then -head>=0, so T-4 >= ceil(-head/s)  -> T>= 4 + ceil(-head/s)  [if head<0, ceil(-head/s) = floor((-head+s-1)/s) ?]\n\n          If head>0, then the condition is automatically satisfied for T>=4? \n\n        Similarly, tail + s*(T-4) <=0  => s*(T-4) <= -tail\n\n          If tail>=0, then -tail<=0, so the condition is automatically satisfied? \n          If tail<0, then -tail>0, so T-4 <= floor(-tail/s)   -> T<= 4 + floor(-tail/s)\n\n        So:\n\n          If head>0 and tail>0: then the car is to the right and never covers 0? -> safe for all T>=4.\n          If head<=0 and tail<=0: then we have:\n                T_low = 4 + ceil(-head/s)   [if head<0, ceil(-head/s) = floor((-head+s-1)/s) ?] \n                T_high = 4 + floor(-tail/s)\n          If head>0 and tail<0: then we have only the condition from tail: T<=4+floor(-tail/s) and T>=4? \n                But we also require the head condition?

And the cars are given per freeway index.\n\n        However, the freeway index in the table is k=1..8, and y is the vertical coordinate, so freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n          if y in [1,8]:\n              if not safe_freeway[turn][y]: then the state is unsafe.\n\n          else (y=0 or 9): safe.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll create a 2D list: safe_table = \n        # index by freeway k (1..8) and turn T (4..40)\n        safe_table = [ [True]*(T_max+1) for _ in range(9) ]   # index 0 unused for freeway, freeway1 to 8: index1 to 8.\n\n        But we only care about T from 4 to 40.\n\n        Initialize: for k in 1..8: for T in 4..40: safe_table[k][T]=True.\n\n        For freeway k in 1..8:\n            for each car in freeway k:\n                head, tail, d, s = car   # d is always 'right'\n                if head>0 and tail>0:\n                    continue\n                if head<=0 and tail>0:\n                    continue   # safe for all T\n                # Otherwise:\n                if head<=0:\n                    a = -head\n                    T_low = 4 + (a+s-1)//s\n                else: # head>0 and tail<=0\n                    T_low = 4\n\n                if tail<=0:\n                    c = -tail\n                    T_high = 4 + c//s\n                else: # tail>0 and head<=0 -> we should have skipped above? \n                    # Actually, we have head<=0 and tail>0 -> we already skipped by the second if.\n                    # So we only get here if tail<=0 and head>0? or head<=0 and tail<=0? \n                    # Actually, we have:\n                    #   head<=0: then we set T_low\n                    #   tail<=0: then we set T_high\n                # Now, if T_low<=T_high, then for T in [T_low, T_high]: unsafe\n                if T_low<=T_high:\n                    for T_val in range(T_low, T_high+1):\n                        if T_val<=40 and T_val>=4:\n                            safe_table[k][T_val] = False\n\n        Then in BFS, for state (turn, y) with turn in [4,40] and y in [1,8], check safe_table[y][turn]. If False, skip.\n\n        For y=0 or 9: safe.\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\n  Let Q = deque()\n  dist = a dictionary or 2D array: we don't need the distance, we need the parent.\n\n  We can create a 2D array parent_turn and parent_y and action_prev for state (turn,y) for turn in [4,40] and y in [0,9].\n\n  Alternatively, we can use dictionaries.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      from collections import deque\n      Q = deque()\n      # We'll create arrays: \n      #   visited[turn][y] = boolean\n      #   parent[turn][y] = (prev_turn, prev_y, action_taken)  # action_taken from (prev_turn, prev_y) to (turn,y)\n\n      But note: we start at (4,1). Then we move to (5,y5) by an action at turn4.\n\n      We set:\n          visited[4][1] = True\n          parent[4][1] = None\n\n      Then we push (4,1)\n\n      Then while Q:\n          (turn, y) = Q.popleft()\n          if y==9:\n              T_min = turn\n              break\n\n          # Check safety at (turn,y): \n          if y in [1,8]: \n              if not safe_table[y][turn]: \n                  continue   # unsafe, skip\n          # else: safe\n\n          Then for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n              y_next = y\n              if action=='U':\n                  y_next = y+1\n                  if y_next>9: y_next=9\n              elif action=='D':\n                  y_next = y-1\n                  if y_next<0: y_next=0\n              else: # S\n                  y_next = y\n\n              next_turn = turn+1\n              if next_turn > 40: \n                  continue\n              if not visited[next_turn][y_next]:\n                  visited[next_turn][y_next] = True\n                  parent[next_turn][y_next] = (turn, y, action)\n                  Q.append( (next_turn, y_next) )\n\n      If we break at (T_min,9), then we reconstruct:\n\n          actions = []\n          # The last state is (T_min,9). The action that got us here was taken at turn T_min-1? \n          # But we are going to add an action at turn T_min arbitrarily as 'S'. \n          # First, we reconstruct the actions from 4 to T_min-1.\n\n          current_turn = T_min\n          current_y = 9\n          seq_actions = []   # will be in reverse order: from turn T_min-1 down to 4.\n\n          while current_turn > 4:\n              (prev_turn, prev_y, a) = parent[current_turn][current_y]\n              seq_actions.append(a)\n              current_turn = prev_turn\n              current_y = prev_y\n\n          Then reverse seq_actions -> this gives the actions at turn4,5,...,T_min-1.\n\n          Then we add an action at turn T_min: 'S'\n\n          So the full sequence: \n              turn4: seq_actions[0]\n              turn5: seq_actions[1]\n              ...\n              turn T_min-1: seq_actions[T_min-5]   # because from 4 to T_min-1: (T_min-1)-4+1 = T_min-4 actions?\n              turn T_min: 'S'\n\n          The length = (T_min-4) + 1 = T_min-3 = H.\n\n      Then output.\n\nBut note: we start at (4,1). The first action is at turn4. The state after the first action is (5, y5). The parent of (5,y5) is (4,1,a4). \n\nSo when we reconstruct from (T_min,9), we get the action taken at turn T_min-1 to get to (T_min,9). Then we need to add the action at turn T_min.\n\nExample: \n  Suppose we found T_min=7: \n      Then we start at (7,9). \n      We get: \n          (7,9) was reached from (6, y6) by an action a6 at turn6.\n      Then from (6,y6) we get a5 at turn5, and from (5,y5) we get a4 at turn4.\n\n      Then the actions: \n          turn4: a4\n          turn5: a5\n          turn6: a6\n          turn7: S\n\n      So we output 4 actions.\n\n  H = 7-3=4.\n\nNow, we code the precomputation for safe_table.\n\nGiven data:\n\nFreeway1: one car: (60,49,right,3) -> head=60>0, tail=49>0 -> safe.\n\nFreeway2: three cars:\n   car1: (0,-11,right,12) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> \n        head<=0: T_low = 4 + (0+12-1)//12 = 4 + 11//12 = 4\n        tail<=0: T_high=4+ (11//12)=4\n        so unsafe at T=4.\n   car2: (36,25,right,12) -> head>0 and tail>0 -> safe.\n   car3: (-48,-59,right,12) -> \n        head<=0: T_low=4 + (48+12-1)//12 = 4+59//12=4+4=8\n        tail<=0: T_high=4+59//12=4+4=8\n        unsafe at T=8.\n\n   So freeway2: unsafe at T=4 and T=8.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2 -> unsafe at T=4 and T=8.\n\nFreeway4: same.\n\nFreeway5: one car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> \n        head<=0: T_low=4 + (42+6-1)//6 = 4+47//6=4+7=11   (47//6=7)\n        tail<=0: T_high=4+53//6=4+8=12   (53//6=8) \n        unsafe at T=11,12.\n\nFreeway6: same.\n\nFreeway7: (-32,-43,right,4) -> \n        head<=0: T_low=4+(32+4-1)//4=4+35//4=4+8=12\n        tail<=0: T_high=4+43//4=4+10=14   (43//4=10)\n        unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway8: same.\n\nSo we build safe_table:\n\n   freeway1: safe for all T.\n\n   freeway2: unsafe at T=4,8.\n   freeway3: same.\n   freeway4: same.\n   freeway5: unsafe at T=11,12.\n   freeway6: same.\n   freeway7: unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n   freeway8: same.\n\nWe are ready to run BFS.\n\nStart: (4,1)\n\nAt (4,1): freeway1 -> safe (since freeway1 is safe at T=4).\n\nThen we consider actions: \n    U: y=2\n    D: y=0\n    S: y=1\n\nNext states: \n   (5,2): freeway2 at T=5: safe? freeway2: unsafe at T=4,8 -> so T=5 safe -> push.\n   (5,0): safe (y=0) -> push.\n   (5,1): freeway1 at T=5: safe -> push.\n\nWe want the minimal T for (T,9). So we do BFS by increasing turn.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  T=4: only (4,1)\n  T=5: (5,2), (5,0), (5,1)\n  T=6: from (5,2): actions: U->3, D->1, S->2 -> states: (6,3), (6,1), (6,2)\n        (5,0): actions: U->1, D->0, S->0 -> (6,1), (6,0), (6,0) -> but we only need to record once.\n        (5,1): actions: U->2, D->0, S->1 -> (6,2), (6,0), (6,1)\n\n  We avoid duplicates: we mark visited per (turn,y). \n\nWe continue until we hit y=9.\n\nWe'll write the BFS in code. But since we are doing by hand? We have to find the minimal T.\n\nBut note: we want minimal T. The minimal T for y=9 is at least 4+ (9-1)=12? But we have obstacles.\n\nWe can try to go up as fast as possible:\n\n  Turn4: at1 -> U -> to2 at turn5.\n  Turn5: at2 -> freeway2 at T=5: safe -> U -> to3 at turn6.\n  Turn6: at3 -> freeway3 at T=6: safe -> U-> to4 at turn7.\n  Turn7: at4 -> freeway4 at T=7: safe -> U-> to5 at turn8.\n  Turn8: at5 -> freeway5 at T=8: safe (because freeway5 unsafe at 11,12) -> U-> to6 at turn9.\n  Turn9: at6 -> freeway6 at T=9: safe -> U-> to7 at turn10.\n  Turn10: at7 -> freeway7 at T=10: safe (unsafe at 12,13,14) -> U-> to8 at turn11.\n  Turn11: at8 -> freeway8 at T=11: safe -> U-> to9 at turn12.\n\n  Then at turn12, we are at9. So T_min=12.\n\n  Then H=12-3=9.\n\n  Sequence: \n        Reconstruct: \n          (12,9) was reached by U from (11,8)\n          (11,8): freeway8 at T=11: safe -> how reached? \n          (11,8) was reached by U from (10,7)\n          (10,7): freeway7 at T=10: safe -> by U from (9,6)\n          (9,6): freeway6 at T=9: safe -> by U from (8,5)\n          (8,5): freeway5 at T=8: safe -> by U from (7,4)\n          (7,4): freeway4 at T=7: safe -> by U from (6,3)\n          (6,3): freeway3 at T=6: safe -> by U from (5,2)\n          (5,2): freeway2 at T=5: safe -> by U from (4,1)\n\n        So actions at turns4 to11: all U. Then at turn12: we add S.\n\n        But wait: the action that got us to (12,9) was taken at turn11: U. Then at turn12 we are at9, and we take action S.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: S\n\n        That's 9 actions.\n\nBut is freeway2 safe at T=5? Yes, because unsafe only at T=4,8.\n\nHowever, what about freeway3 at T=6: safe? yes.\n\nBut freeway4 at T=7: safe? yes.\n\nBut at turn8: we are at freeway5 at T=8: safe? freeway5 is unsafe at T=11,12 -> so safe.\n\nBut at turn11: freeway8: safe? freeway8 unsafe at T=12,13,14 -> so at T=11 safe.\n\nSo this path is safe.\n\nBut is there a faster path? \n\nMinimal moves: 8 moves -> so we must take at least 8 actions to get to9. Then we add one more action at the turn we are at9. So minimal H is 9.\n\nBut what if we can get to9 earlier by going down? \n\nGoing down: from1 to0: then we are stuck? Then we have to come back up -> that would take more turns.\n\nSo the above path is optimal in moves.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S\n\nBut wait: at turn12, we are at9, and we take S. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1=4+9-1=12 we are at (0,9). That is satisfied.\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn12, which is S. \n\nHowever, we could choose any action. But S is the natural choice.\n\nBut is there a path with H<9? \n\n  H=8: then we must be at9 at turn4+8-1=11.\n\n  How to be at9 at turn11? \n\n      We must have taken 7 actions (from turn4 to turn10) and then at the start of turn11 we are at9.\n\n      The minimal moves: 8 moves up. But 7 moves only get us to 1+7=8.\n\n      So we cannot be at9 at turn11.\n\n  Therefore, H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer.\n\nBut note: we must check if there is a path that arrives at turn11 at9? \n\n  To be at9 at turn11, we must have taken 7 actions: \n        y11 = 1 + (sum of moves over 7 actions) = 9.\n\n        So the sum of moves must be 8.\n\n        But each move is at most 1. So we need 8 moves? \n\n        But we only take 7 actions? \n\n        So impossible.\n\n  Hence, minimal H is 9.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" -> so we start with Turn4.\n\nWe have 9 actions: turns4 to12.\n\nBut the last turn is 12, which is t1+H-1 = 4+9-1=12.\n\nAnd at the start of turn12, we are at9.\n\nAnd we take action S at turn12.\n\nBut the problem does not require us to stay, so we could also choose U or D? \n\nAt y=9, U and D: \n  U: y_next = min(9+1,9)=9\n  D: y_next = max(9-1,0)=8\n\nBut the condition is only that at the start of turn12 we are at9. The action at turn12 can be anything.\n\nHowever, if we choose D at turn12, then after the action we move to8. But that doesn't affect the goal.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". We have reached at the start of turn12. \n\nSo we can choose any. But to be consistent, we choose S.\n\nWe can also choose U, which is equivalent to S at y=9.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so we can choose any.\n\nBut the minimal H is fixed.\n\nSo we choose S.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving upward continuously, as the freeways are safe at the required turns. The path is as follows:\n\n- At turn 4, move up to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 5, move up to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 6, move up to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 8, move up to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 10, move up to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 11, move up to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 12, stay at \\(y = 9\\) (action \\(S\\) is chosen, but any action is valid since the goal is reached at the start of turn 12).\n\nThe sequence ensures that at the start of turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 9 - 1 = 12\\), the player is at \\((0, 9)\\). The freeway safety is verified as follows:\n- Freeway 1: safe at all turns (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at turns 4 and 8; safe at turn 5.\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at turns 4 and 8; safe at turn 6.\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at turns 4 and 8; safe at turn 7.\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at turns 11 and 12; safe at turn 8.\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at turns 11 and 12; safe at turn 9.\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; safe at turn 10.\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; safe at turn 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: S\n}",

Actually, from the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> this is a right-moving car. So at turn t1=5, the car is from τ=-59 to h=-48? But wait, the representation says (head, tail, ...). \n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving: they say \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial span is [τ, h]. But in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). \n\nLet me check the example: for freeway 2, we have (12,1,right,12). Since it's right-moving, the span at t1=5 is [τ, h] = [1,12]. Similarly, (-36,-47,right,12) is [ -47, -36 ].\n\nSo the representation for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed). But note:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the head is the larger x (right end) and tail is the smaller x (left end). So the span is [tail, head].\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the smaller x (left end) and tail is the larger x? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, τ] and then [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if h is the head and τ the tail, then for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? But the update rule: at t1, the car is from h to τ? and then moves left? \n\nBut note the example: freeway1 has a right-moving car: (-48, -59, right, 3). So head=-48, tail=-59. Since it's right-moving, the span at t1=5 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [-59 + 3*(T-5), -48 + 3*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving? Actually, there are no left-moving cars in the given state. But we can assume the same representation: if a car is left-moving, then the head is the left end and tail is the right end? Then the span at t1 is [head, tail] (which would be from left to right, but then moving left). However, the update rule for left-moving says: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if the car moves left, then the entire segment shifts left.\n\nBut in the given state, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have to worry about left-moving.\n\nSo for each freeway, we have a list of cars. At any future turn T, the car on freeway k will have its span shifted by s*(T-5) to the right (if right-moving).\n\nWe are to plan a sequence of actions from turn t1=5 (so t=0 in our planning corresponds to turn 5) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 5.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T if there is a car on freeway y such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nNote: we are only at freeway y at turn T if our y coordinate at turn T is y. And we are at x=0 always.\n\nSo for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting at 5), we can compute the set of cars that would cover x=0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are fixed at the initial state. They move over time.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (relative to t1=5, so T = 5,6,7,...) whether x=0 is covered by any car on freeway k.\n\nLet me define the relative turn: t = T - 5. So at t=0 (which is turn 5), we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each t>=0, whether there is a car on freeway k that covers x=0 at time t (relative to t1=5).\n\nHow to compute for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) at freeway k:\n\nSince all are right-moving, the span at time t (where t=0 is turn5) is:\n  [tail + s * t, head + s * t]\n\nWe need 0 to be in [tail + s*t, head + s*t] i.e., \n  tail + s*t <= 0 <= head + s*t\n\nBut note: tail <= head (because for right-moving, tail is the left end and head the right end).\n\nSo condition: \n  tail + s*t <= 0 <= head + s*t\n\nWe can rearrange for t:\n\n  t >= ceil( ( - head ) / s )   ??? Actually, let's solve:\n\n  0 >= tail + s*t   =>   s*t <= -tail   =>   t <= ceil( (-tail) / s )? Actually, no:\n\nActually, we have two inequalities:\n\n1. tail + s*t <= 0  => s*t <= -tail  => t <= (-tail) / s   (if s>0)\n\n2. 0 <= head + s*t  => s*t >= -head  => t >= ceil( (-head) / s )   (if we are using integers? But note: positions are integers? The problem doesn't specify, but the given numbers are integers and the movement is linear with integer speed. We assume the positions are real? But the update is linear, and we are checking at integer turns.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is only at integer T. So t is integer.\n\nSo for a fixed car, the condition is:\n\n  t_min = ceil( (-head) / s )   [because we need t >= (-head)/s, and since t integer, we take ceil]\n  t_max = floor( (-tail) / s )   [because we need t <= (-tail)/s, and t integer, so floor]\n\nBut wait: actually, from the inequalities:\n\n  tail + s*t <= 0   => t <= (-tail) / s   -> since t is integer, the maximum t that satisfies is floor( (-tail)/s )? Actually, no: because if (-tail)/s is not integer, then t must be <= floor( (-tail)/s ). But let me test:\n\nExample: tail = -59, s=3 (freeway1): \n  condition: -59 + 3*t <= 0 -> 3*t <= 59 -> t <= 59/3 = 19.666... so t <= 19.\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition: 0 <= head + s*t -> 0 <= -48 + 3*t -> 3*t>=48 -> t>=16.\n\nSo for freeway1 car, it covers x=0 from t=16 to t=19 (inclusive).\n\nBut note: at t=0 (turn5), the car is at [-59, -48]. Then at t=16 (turn21): \n  tail + s*16 = -59 + 48 = -11 -> still negative? \n  Actually: -59 + 3*16 = -59+48 = -11 -> so the car is from -11 to -48+48=0? Actually, head + s*t = -48 + 48 = 0. So at t=16, the car covers from -11 to 0. So x=0 is covered? Actually, the span at t=16: [tail + s*t, head + s*t] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0]. So 0 is the right end. Is 0 included? The problem says \"if 0 in the span\". Since it's a closed interval? The update rule uses [a,b] so inclusive. So 0 is included.\n\nAt t=17: [-59+51, -48+51] = [-8,3] -> 0 is inside.\nAt t=18: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 inside.\nAt t=19: [-59+57, -48+57] = [-2,9] -> 0 inside.\nAt t=20: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not inside.\n\nSo actually, the car covers x=0 at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut according to the inequalities: \n  t_min = ceil( (-head) / s ) = ceil(48/3)=ceil(16)=16.\n  t_max = floor( (-tail) / s ) = floor(59/3)=floor(19.666)=19.\n\nSo the car is dangerous at t from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, for the other cars.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the interval [t_min, t_max] (if any) during which it covers x=0.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars. So for a freeway k, at time t, if there is at least one car whose interval contains t, then freeway k is dangerous at time t.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway k at time t if freeway k is dangerous at time t.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at t=0 (turn5). We can only move up, down, or stay. We start at y=2.\n\nOur goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, and we can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that at each time t (starting at 0) we are at a position y_t, and at the time we are at a freeway (1..8) we must not be on a dangerous time for that freeway.\n\nNote: at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so we are safe. But we start at y=2 and need to end at y=9. We can go through y=0? But the problem says the vertical axis is y=0,1,...,9. And the freeways are only at y=1..8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nBut note: the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we can go to y=0 and stay there? But we need to get to y=9.\n\nOur current state: at t=0 (turn5): y=2.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1..8) the dangerous times.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the dangerous intervals:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48,-59,right,3)\n  head=-48, tail=-59, s=3\n  t_min = ceil(48/3)=ceil(16)=16\n  t_max = floor(59/3)=floor(19.666)=19\n  So dangerous at t in [16,19]\n\nFreeway 2: three cars: \n  (12,1,right,12): \n      head=12, tail=1, s=12\n      t_min = ceil( (-12)/12 ) = ceil(-1) = -1 -> but t>=0, so we take max(0, ...). Actually, we need to check if the interval is nonnegative. Since t_min is negative, we take from t=0? But let's compute the condition:\n      Condition: 1+12*t <= 0 <= 12+12*t\n      First: 1+12*t <=0 -> 12*t<=-1 -> t<=-1/12 -> which is always false for t>=0? Actually, the first inequality is not satisfied for any t>=0? Because 1+12*t >=1>0. So this car never covers x=0? \n\n  Similarly, (48,37,right,12): \n      head=48, tail=37, s=12\n      Condition: 37+12*t <=0<=48+12*t -> \n        37+12*t<=0 -> 12*t<=-37 -> t<=-37/12 -> impossible for t>=0.\n      So not dangerous.\n\n  (-36,-47,right,12):\n      head=-36, tail=-47, s=12\n      Condition: -47+12*t <=0<=-36+12*t\n        First: -47+12*t<=0 -> 12*t<=47 -> t<=47/12=3.916 -> t<=3\n        Second: 0<=-36+12*t -> 12*t>=36 -> t>=3\n        So t must be 3? \n        Check: at t=3: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, at the right end.\n        Also at t=4: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n        So only t=3.\n\n  So freeway2 is dangerous at t=3.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2? The table says:\n  3 | (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) \n  So same as freeway2: dangerous at t=3 (only the third car).\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway2? dangerous at t=3.\n\nFreeway5: one car: (-36,-47,right,6)\n  head=-36, tail=-47, s=6\n  Condition: -47+6*t<=0<=-36+6*t\n    First: -47+6*t<=0 -> 6*t<=47 -> t<=47/6≈7.833 -> t<=7\n    Second: 0<=-36+6*t -> 6*t>=36 -> t>=6\n    So t in [6,7]\n  Check: t=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 included.\n         t=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 included.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  6 | (-36,-47,right,6) -> same as freeway5: dangerous at t in [6,7]\n\nFreeway7: (-28,-39,right,4)\n  head=-28, tail=-39, s=4\n  Condition: -39+4*t<=0<=-28+4*t\n    First: -39+4*t<=0 -> 4*t<=39 -> t<=9.75 -> t<=9\n    Second: 0<=-28+4*t -> 4*t>=28 -> t>=7\n    So t in [7,9]\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: dangerous at t in [7,9]\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways by time:\n\nt=0: none? \n  But we must check: at t=0, we are at freeway2? Actually, we are at y=2 at t=0 (turn5). So freeway2? \n  But freeway2: at t=0, the car (12,1,right,12): [1+0,12+0]=[1,12] -> 0 not included.\n        (48,37,right,12): [37,48] -> no\n        (-36,-47,right,12): [-47,-36] -> no\n  So safe at t=0 for freeway2.\n\nt=1: no car covers any freeway at t=1? \n  We'll list:\n\nFreeway1: [16,19] -> not 1\nFreeway2: only at t=3 -> safe\nFreeway3: same as 2 -> safe\nFreeway4: same -> safe\nFreeway5: [6,7] -> not 1\nFreeway6: same -> safe\nFreeway7: [7,9] -> not 1\nFreeway8: same -> safe\n\nt=2: similarly, safe for all.\n\nt=3: freeway2,3,4 are dangerous.\n\nt=4: no? freeway2,3,4: only t=3? so safe.\n\nt=5: safe.\n\nt=6: freeway5 and 6 are dangerous.\n\nt=7: freeway5,6,7,8 are dangerous.\n\nt=8: freeway7,8 (since [7,9] for freeway7 and 8) -> dangerous.\n\nt=9: freeway7,8 dangerous.\n\nt=10: freeway7,8: at t=10: \n  freeway7: [7,9] -> 10 not in [7,9]? no. \n  So safe? \n\nBut let me check freeway7: \n  Condition: t in [7,9] -> so t=7,8,9 are dangerous. t=10 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 same.\n\nNow, we start at t=0 at y=2. We must avoid:\n\n- At t=3: avoid freeways 2,3,4.\n- At t=6: avoid freeways 5,6.\n- At t=7: avoid freeways 5,6,7,8.\n- At t=8: avoid freeways 7,8.\n- At t=9: avoid freeways 7,8.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We start at y=2. We can move at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe want minimal H (number of turns from t=0 to the turn when we first reach y=9). Note: at the turn when we first reach y=9, we are done.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the turn we reach y=9.\n\nWe are at t=0 (turn5) at y=2.\n\nWe can consider a BFS or dynamic programming over (time, position) to find the minimal steps.\n\nBut note: time goes forward and we have constraints at each time step.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the time index (starting at 0) and y in {0,1,...,9}. We start at (0,2). We want to reach y=9 at the earliest time.\n\nAt each state (t,y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} that leads to y' = min(9, max(0, y + dy)).\n\nBut note: if at time t we are at a freeway y (i.e., y in {1..8}), then we must check if freeway y is dangerous at time t. If it is, then we cannot be there -> so that state is invalid.\n\nWe are allowed to be at y=0 or y=9 at any time (safe).\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we are at y=9 at time H-1? \n\nWait: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, and at time H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nSo at time 0: we are at y0=2 (given). Then we do action a0, then at time 1 we are at y1, ... until at time H-1 we are at y_{H-1}=9.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nWe can do BFS over time and y.\n\nTime is increasing, and we don't know how long we might have to wait. But note: we can always stay at y=0 or y=9 safely. However, we start at y=2 and need to go to y=9. The dangerous times are only from t=3 to t=9. So we might have to avoid being on certain freeways at those times.\n\nWe can try to simulate:\n\nOption 1: Go up as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=0:\n  t0: at y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (t=0: freeway2 safe)\n  We can try to move up.\n\nBut we know at t=3 we must avoid freeways 2,3,4.\n\nSo if we go up:\n\n  t0: y=2 -> safe\n  t1: if we go up: y=3 -> safe? because t=1: all freeways safe? yes.\n  t2: y=4 -> safe (t=2: safe)\n  t3: we are at y=4 at t=3 -> but freeway4 is dangerous at t=3 -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway4 at t=3.\n\nWe could avoid by going down? or by not being at freeway4 at t=3.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at a safe freeway until after the dangerous time.\n\nBut note: freeway1 is safe at t=3? \n  freeway1: dangerous only at [16,19] -> so safe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: dangerous at [6,7] -> safe at t=3.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at t0. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe could:\n\n- Go down to y=1 at t1, then stay until t=4? because at t=3, freeway1 is safe? \n  But then at t=3 we are at y=1 (freeway1) -> safe.\n\nThen after t=3, we can start moving up.\n\nBut at t=3, we are at y=1. Then we can move up to y=2 at t=4, then to y=3 at t=5, then to y=4 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6: freeway4? no, we are at y=4 at t=6? \n  But freeway4 is safe at t=6? because freeway4 was only dangerous at t=3? -> yes, safe.\n\nBut then at t=6 we are at y=4. Then we want to go to y=5 at t=7? but at t=7, freeway5 and 6 and 7 and 8 are dangerous. So we must avoid freeways 5,6,7,8 at t=7.\n\nBut if we are at y=4 at t=6, we can go up to y=5 at t=7 -> but freeway5 is dangerous at t=7 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down? but that would be counterproductive.\n\nOr we can stay at y=4 at t=6? then at t=7 we are still at y=4 -> freeway4: safe at t=7? yes, because freeway4 only dangerous at t=3. So we can stay.\n\nThen at t=7: we are at y=4 (safe). Then at t=8: we can go up to y=5. But at t=8: freeway5 is dangerous? \n  freeway5: dangerous at t=6 and 7 -> so at t=8, freeway5 is safe. \n  But freeway5 is at y=5? yes. So at t=8, if we are at y=5, then we are safe? \n  However, note: freeway7 and 8 are dangerous at t=8. But we are at y=5, which is freeway5 -> safe.\n\nSo then:\n\nt0: y=2 (safe)\nt1: go down to y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at t=1)\nt2: stay at y=1 -> safe\nt3: stay at y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at t=3)\nt4: go up to y=2 -> safe (freeway2: dangerous only at t=3, so safe at t=4)\nt5: go up to y=3 -> safe (freeway3: dangerous only at t=3, so safe at t=5)\nt6: go up to y=4 -> safe (freeway4: dangerous only at t=3, safe at t=6)\nt7: stay at y=4 -> safe\nt8: go up to y=5 -> safe (freeway5: dangerous at t=6,7 -> safe at t=8)\nt9: go up to y=6 -> but at t=9: freeway6 is dangerous? \n  freeway6: dangerous at t=6,7 -> so at t=9, safe. \n  But also freeway7 and 8 are dangerous at t=9. However, we are at freeway6 -> safe.\nt10: go up to y=7 -> but at t=10: freeway7 is safe? \n  freeway7: dangerous at t=7,8,9 -> safe at t=10. So safe.\nt11: go up to y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous? at t=11: freeway8 dangerous only at [7,9] -> safe. \n  But wait: freeway8 is dangerous at t=7,8,9 -> t=11 safe.\nt12: go up to y=9 -> done.\n\nTotal turns: 12? But we started at t0 and we have 12 actions? Then we are at y9 at t12? So H=13? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: from t0 to t11 (12 actions) and we end at y9 at t12? \n\nActually, the problem: \n  We have H turns: actions at t0, t1, ... t_{H-1}. Then at the end of the last action, we are at the next state, which is at time t0+H.\n\nBut we start at time t0 (turn5) at y=2. After H actions, we are at time t0+H at y=9.\n\nIn our state: we are at time index t (relative to t0) at the beginning of the turn. Then we choose an action, and at the end of the turn we are at y_{t+1} and the time for the next state is t+1.\n\nIn our simulation:\n\nt0: start at y=2. Then we do action a0 -> then we are at y1 at time t1 (which is t0+1 in absolute, or t=1 in relative).\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some time step.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTime (relative) | y (at the beginning of the turn) | action | next y (at the beginning of next turn)\nt0: y=2 -> then we do an action -> at t1 we are at y1.\n\nWe want at the beginning of a turn to have y=9? Actually, the problem says: we do a sequence of actions and after H actions we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the player update: after an action at time t, we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and that becomes the state at time t+1.\n\nSo we start at time t0 (turn5) with y=2. Then after H actions, we are at time t0+H at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t0, t0+1, ..., t0+H-1.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nIn the above path, we have:\n\nt0: at y=2 -> action: D (down to y=1) -> then at t1: y=1\nt1: at y=1 -> action: S (stay) -> then at t2: y=1\nt2: at y=1 -> action: S -> then at t3: y=1\nt3: at y=1 -> action: U (up to y=2) -> then at t4: y=2\nt4: at y=2 -> action: U -> then at t5: y=3\nt5: at y=3 -> action: U -> then at t6: y=4\nt6: at y=4 -> action: S -> then at t7: y=4\nt7: at y=4 -> action: U -> then at t8: y=5\nt8: at y=5 -> action: U -> then at t9: y=6\nt9: at y=6 -> action: U -> then at t10: y=7\nt10: at y=7 -> action: U -> then at t11: y=8\nt11: at y=8 -> action: U -> then at t12: y=9\n\nSo we have H=12 actions? Then we reach y=9 at the 12th action? So the absolute turn when we finish is t0+12 = 5+12=17.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe might avoid the long detour down.\n\nAlternative: we could go up to y=3 at t1, then to y=4 at t2. Then at t3 we must avoid freeway4. So we can go down to y=3 at t3? \n\nBut at t3, if we are at y=3: freeway3 is dangerous at t3 -> collision.\n\nGo down to y=2 at t3? freeway2 is dangerous at t3 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2,3,4 at t3.\n\nBut from y=4 at t2, we cannot go down to y=3 or y=2 at t3 without being on freeway3 or 2 at t3 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we must leave freeways 2,3,4 by t3? \n\nBut we start at y=2. We can go up to y=5? \n\nt0: y=2 -> safe\nt1: U to y=3 -> safe\nt2: U to y=4 -> safe\nt3: we are at y=4 at t3 -> dangerous. So we cannot be at y=4 at t3.\n\nBut we can go up to y=5 at t3? \n  Then at t3 we are at y=5 -> freeway5. \n  But freeway5 is dangerous at t=6,7 -> so safe at t=3.\n\nSo:\n\nt0: y=2 -> action: U -> y=3 at t1\nt1: y=3 -> action: U -> y=4 at t2\nt2: y=4 -> action: U -> y=5 at t3 -> safe? \n  Because freeway5: dangerous at [6,7] -> safe at t=3.\n\nThen we are at y=5 at t3.\n\nNow at t4: we can go up to y=6 -> safe? freeway6: dangerous at [6,7] -> safe at t=4.\nt4: U -> y=6 at t5 -> safe (freeway6 safe at t5? yes, since dangerous at 6 and 7 only)\n\nBut then at t5: we are at y=6. Then we can go up to y=7 at t6? \n  But at t6: freeway6 is dangerous -> we are at freeway6? no, because we move to y=7 at t6? \n  Actually: at the beginning of t5: y=6. Then we do U -> then at the beginning of t6: y=7.\n\nBut at time t6, we are at y=7. And freeway7 is dangerous at t6? \n  freeway7: dangerous at [7,9] -> so t6 is not in [7,9]? because [7,9] starts at t=7? \n  Actually, the interval is [7,9] -> so t=7,8,9. So t=6 is safe.\n\nSo at t6: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at t=7,8,9 -> safe at t=6.\n\nThen we can:\nt5: U -> to y=7 at t6 -> safe.\n\nThen at t6: we are at y=7. Then we want to go to y=8 at t7? \n  But at t7: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at t7? yes (since [7,9] includes 7). So collision.\n\nWe can stay at y=7 at t7? \n  Then at t7: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at t7 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway7 or 8 at t7,8,9.\n\nWe need to avoid being at y=7 or 8 at t=7,8,9.\n\nSo from y=7 at t6, we can go down? but that would be moving away from goal.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=6 until after t9? \n\nBut at y=6 (freeway6) at t7: freeway6 is dangerous at t7? \n  freeway6: dangerous at [6,7] -> so at t7: dangerous? \n  Actually, [6,7] -> so t=6 and 7. So at t7: dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at t7.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t7: freeway5 dangerous at t7 -> collision.\n\nSo we must be at a freeway that is safe at t7,8,9: that is only freeways 1,2,3,4? \n  But freeways 1: safe at t7? (dangerous only at [16,19]) -> safe.\n  freeway2: safe at t7? (only dangerous at t=3) -> safe.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at t6. To get to freeway2, we would have to go down: \n  from y=7 at t6: \n    t6: action D -> to y=6 at t7 -> but freeway6 dangerous at t7 -> collision.\n\n  t6: action D twice? no, only one action per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can go to y=0? \n\nBut from y=7 at t6: \n  We can go down: \n    t6: D -> y=6 at t7 -> collision (freeway6 at t7 dangerous)\n    t6: stay -> y=7 at t7 -> collision (freeway7 at t7 dangerous)\n    t6: U -> y=8 at t7 -> collision (freeway8 dangerous)\n\nSo we are stuck at t6 if we are at y=7.\n\nTherefore, the first path (going down to y=1 and waiting) might be the way.\n\nBut we can try to go to y=5 by t3, then we can try to go to y=0 to avoid the dangerous times at t6 and t7? \n\nBut note: at t6 and t7, we must avoid freeways 5,6,7,8. So if we are at y=0,1,2,3,4 we are safe? \n  But at t6: freeway5 and 6 are dangerous -> so if we are at freeway5 or 6, we crash. But if we are at y=0,1,2,3,4: \n    y=0: safe (no freeway)\n    y=1: freeway1 -> safe (dangerous only at [16,19])\n    y=2: freeway2 -> safe (only dangerous at t=3)\n    y=3: freeway3 -> safe (only dangerous at t=3)\n    y=4: freeway4 -> safe (only dangerous at t=3)\n\nSo at t6 and t7, we can be at y=0 to 4.\n\nSo from y=5 at t3, we can go down to y=4 at t4, then stay until after t7? \n\nBut then we have to go up again.\n\nPath:\n\nt0: y=2 -> U -> y=3 at t1\nt1: y=3 -> U -> y=4 at t2\nt2: y=4 -> U -> y=5 at t3 -> safe\nt3: y=5 -> D -> y=4 at t4 -> safe\nt4: y=4 -> S -> y=4 at t5 -> safe\nt5: y=4 -> S -> y=4 at t6 -> safe\nt6: y=4 -> S -> y=4 at t7 -> safe (because freeway4 only dangerous at t=3)\nt7: y=4 -> U -> y=5 at t8 -> safe (freeway5 dangerous at 6,7 -> safe at t8)\nt8: y=5 -> U -> y=6 at t9 -> safe (freeway6 dangerous at 6,7 -> safe at t9)\nt9: y=6 -> U -> y=7 at t10 -> safe (freeway7 dangerous at 7,8,9 -> safe at t10)\nt10: y=7 -> U -> y=8 at t11\nt11: y=8 -> U -> y=9 at t12\n\nTotal H=12 actions.\n\nSame length as the previous path.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe might go up faster and then avoid by going to y=0.\n\nBut going to y=0: we start at y=2. We can go down to y=1 at t1, then down to y=0 at t2. Then we can stay at y=0 until we need to go up.\n\nBut at t3, we are at y=0 -> safe. Then we can start going up at t3? \n\nBut then we have:\n\nt0: D -> y=1 at t1\nt1: D -> y=0 at t2\nt2: S -> y=0 at t3\nt3: U -> y=1 at t4\nt4: U -> y=2 at t5\nt5: U -> y=3 at t6\nt6: U -> y=4 at t7 -> but at t7: freeway4 is safe? yes (only dangerous at t=3). So safe.\nt7: U -> y=5 at t8 -> safe (freeway5 safe at t8)\nt8: U -> y=6 at t9 -> safe\nt9: U -> y=7 at t10 -> safe\nt10: U -> y=8 at t11\nt11: U -> y=9 at t12\n\nAgain 12 actions.\n\nBut we might leave y=0 earlier? \n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y=9 without waiting? \n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At t=3: must not be at freeway2,3,4.\n\nWe start at y=2 at t0.\n\nIf we go up:\n\nt0: U -> y=3 at t1\nt1: U -> y=4 at t2\nt2: U -> y=5 at t3 -> safe (freeway5 safe at t3)\n\nThen at t3: y=5.\n\nNow we are at t3, and we want to go up. But at t6 we must avoid freeway5 and 6? \n\nWe are at y=5 at t3. We can go:\n\nt3: U -> y=6 at t4 -> safe (freeway6 safe at t4? yes, dangerous at 6,7 -> safe at t4)\nt4: U -> y=7 at t5 -> safe (freeway7 safe at t5? dangerous at 7,8,9 -> safe at t5)\nt5: U -> y=8 at t6 -> at t6: freeway8? \n  freeway8: dangerous at t=7,8,9 -> so safe at t6.\nt6: U -> y=9 at t7 -> done.\n\nBut wait: at t6 we move to y=9? then we are done at t7? \n\nBut note: at t6 (the beginning of turn t6) we are at y=8. Then we do U -> then at the next state (t7) we are at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nt0: U (from y2 to y3 at t1)\nt1: U (y3->y4 at t2)\nt2: U (y4->y5 at t3)\nt3: U (y5->y6 at t4)\nt4: U (y6->y7 at t5)\nt5: U (y7->y8 at t6)\nt6: U (y8->y9 at t7)\n\nSo we have 7 actions? and we end at t7 (relative time 7).\n\nBut we must check the dangerous times:\n\nAt t3: we are at y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous at [6,7] -> so at t3: safe.\n\nAt t4: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at [6,7] -> so at t4: safe? because [6,7] starts at t=6? \n  But at t4: freeway6: \n      car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> at t4: \n          span: [-47+6*4, -36+6*4] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nAt t5: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: \n      car: (-28,-39,right,4) -> at t5: \n          span: [-39+4*5, -28+4*5] = [-39+20, -28+20] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nAt t6: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: \n      car: same as freeway7? but it's freeway8: (-28,-39,right,4) -> at t6: \n          span: [-39+4*6, -28+4*6] = [-39+24, -28+24] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nThen at t7: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo this path is safe? \n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway5 at t6? \n  We are at freeway5 only when we are at y=5. \n  At t3: we were at freeway5? yes, and it was safe. \n  At t4: we are at freeway6 -> and we computed freeway6 at t4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t5: freeway7 at t5: safe.\n\nAt t6: freeway8 at t6: safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t7 (relative time 7) -> so H=7 actions.\n\nThis is shorter than the previous 12.\n\nWhy did I think freeway5 was dangerous at t6? \n  The condition for freeway5: dangerous at t in [6,7]. \n  But at time t=6, we are at freeway8 (y=8) -> so we don't check freeway5.\n\nOnly when we are on freeway5 at time t=6, we crash. But we are not.\n\nSo the path:\n\nt0: U -> from y2 to y3\nt1: U -> y3 to y4\nt2: U -> y4 to y5\nt3: U -> y5 to y6\nt4: U -> y6 to y7\nt5: U -> y7 to y8\nt6: U -> y8 to y9\n\nSo 7 actions.\n\nNow, we must write the actions for the turns.\n\nThe initial turn is t1=5 (absolute turn).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn 5+7=12, we are at y=9.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times for the freeways we were on:\n\nAt turn5 (t0): we are at y=2 -> freeway2: \n      cars: \n        (12,1,right,12): at t0: [1,12] -> safe.\n        (48,37,right,12): [37,48] -> safe.\n        (-36,-47,right,12): at t0: [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nAt turn6 (t1): we are at y=3 -> freeway3: \n      same cars as freeway2: \n        at t1: \n          (12,1): [1+12*1, 12+12*1] = [13,24] -> safe.\n          (48,37): [37+12,48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n          (-36,-47): [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn7 (t2): y=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway2? \n      at t2: \n          (12,1): [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n          (48,37): [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\n          (-36,-47): [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nAt turn8 (t3): y=5 -> freeway5: \n      car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> at t3: \n          span: [-47+6*3, -36+6*3] = [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\nAt turn9 (t4): y=6 -> freeway6: \n      car: same as freeway5? (-36,-47,right,6) -> at t4: \n          [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nAt turn10 (t5): y=7 -> freeway7: \n      car: (-28,-39,right,4) -> at t5: \n          [-39+4*5, -28+4*5] = [-39+20, -28+20] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nAt turn11 (t6): y=8 -> freeway8: \n      same car as freeway7? but freeway8: (-28,-39,right,4) -> at t6: \n          [-39+24, -28+24] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn12 (t7): y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nBut note: is there an even shorter path? \n\nWe need to get from y=2 to y=9: minimum 7 steps? because we must go up 7 steps. And we have 7 moves of U. So we cannot do it in fewer than 7 actions.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until we have done H actions.\n\nHere H=7, so turns 5 to 11.\n\nBut note: at turn5, we start at (0,2) and do U -> to (0,3) at the beginning of turn6.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nAfter the last action (turn11), we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn12.\n\nBut the problem says: we must reach (0,9). And we do at the next state after the last action.\n\nSo it is correct.\n\nBut let me write in the boxed format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here, t1=5, and t from 0 to 6 (since H=7, so t=0,...,6) -> \n  a_{5+0} = a5 = U\n  a_{5+1}=a6=U\n  ...\n  a_{5+6}=a11=U\n\nSo the last action is at turn 11.\n\nAnd we are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 7. The sequence of actions involves moving up (U) at every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 5 (\\(t = 0\\)):** Player at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2).  \n  Cars on freeway 2:  \n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Span at \\(t = 0\\) is \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  - \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Span \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  - \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Span \\([-47, -36]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 6 (\\(t = 1\\)):** Player at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3).  \n  Cars on freeway 3 (same as freeway 2):  \n  - Spans at \\(t = 1\\): \\([13, 24]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), \\([-35, -24]\\), 0 not in any span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 7 (\\(t = 2\\)):** Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4).  \n  Cars on freeway 4 (same as freeway 2):  \n  - Spans at \\(t = 2\\): \\([25, 36]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in any span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 8 (\\(t = 3\\)):** Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5).  \n  Car on freeway 5: \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n  Span at \\(t = 3\\): \\([-47 + 18, -36 + 18] = [-29, -18]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t = 4\\)):** Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).  \n  Car on freeway 6: \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n  Span at \\(t = 4\\): \\([-47 + 24, -36 + 24] = [-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 10 (\\(t = 5\\)):** Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7).  \n  Car on freeway 7: \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\).  \n  Span at \\(t = 5\\): \\([-39 + 20, -28 + 20] = [-19, -8]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 11 (\\(t = 6\\)):** Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8).  \n  Car on freeway 8: \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\).  \n  Span at \\(t = 6\\): \\([-39 + 24, -28 + 24] = [-15, -4]\\), 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\nAfter the action at turn 11, the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12, which is safe as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 5 to 11 (7 actions) is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8, and they move horizontally. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1=6. I need to find where these cars are at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car spans include x=0.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move, I'll be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So at turn T, I only care about cars on y_T, not on y_{T+1} or others.\n\nAlso, for moving to y_{T+1} at turn T, I won't be considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so if there's a car on y_{T+1} at turn T with 0 in span, but I'm not there yet, no collision. Only when I'm actually on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, the car positions change over time. For left-moving cars, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right, with speed s per turn.\n\nAll cars here are moving right, from the data. Let me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, head is at -45, tail at -56? That seems odd because if it's moving right, head should be the right end, so if tail is -56 and head is -45, that means it's from -56 to -45, so length 11, and moving right, so head increases.\n\nIn the span description: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ tail, h head, so [tail, head] I think? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], meaning from tail τ to head h, with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 1: head h=-45, tail τ=-56, direction right. Since τ=-56, h=-45, and -56 < -45, so τ < h, so [τ, h] = [-56, -45]. Moving right, so at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-56 + 3(T-6), -45 + 3(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, only one car.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nBut (24,13) — 24 and 13, if tail τ=13, head h=24, then τ=13, h=24, so [13,24] at t_1=6.\n\nSimilarly, (60,49): τ=49, h=60? 49<60, so [49,60]\n\nAnd (-24,-35): τ=-35, h=-24? -35<-24, so [-35,-24]\n\nAll moving right at speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (-30,-41,right,6) so τ=-41, h=-30, [-41,-30]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (-30,-41,right,6) [-41,-30]\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4) τ=-35, h=-24, [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-24,-35,right,4) [-35,-24]\n\nAll cars are moving right, no left-moving.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn t=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and I start at y=3, I need to move up at least 6 times. But I might need to move down or stay to avoid cars, so it could take more than 6 turns.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so I should try to go up as much as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nEach turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nAt each turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I must not have a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nFor that, I need to know for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nSince cars move, their positions change over time.\n\nLet me define the time from t_1=6.\n\nSet t = T - t_1, so at t=0, it's turn t_1=6.\n\nThen at time t (relative), the car positions are as given, but shifted by s*t for right-moving.\n\nSince all moving right.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at relative time t, span for right-moving car is [τ + s*t, h + s*t], where τ and h are at t=0 (turn 6).\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t.\n\nThat is, 0 is between τ + s*t and h + s*t inclusive.\n\nSince the car is present if the span includes 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is in their span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, τ=-56, h=-45, s=3\n\nSo span at time t: [-56 + 3t, -45 + 3t]\n\n0 in span if -56 + 3t ≤ 0 ≤ -45 + 3t\n\nWhich is -56 + 3t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -45 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: -56 + 3t ≤ 0 ⇒ 3t ≤ 56 ⇒ t ≤ 56/3 ≈ 18.666, so t ≤ 18 since t integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -45 + 3t ⇒ 45 ≤ 3t ⇒ t ≥ 15\n\nSo t from 15 to 18 inclusive.\n\nt=15,16,17,18.\n\nAt t=15: -56 + 45 = -11 ≤0? -56+3*15= -56+45= -11 ≤0, and 0 ≤ -45+45=0, yes 0≤0.\n\nt=16: -56+48= -8 ≤0, 0≤ -45+48=3, yes\n\nt=17: -56+51= -5≤0, 0≤ -45+51=6, yes\n\nt=18: -56+54= -2≤0, 0≤ -45+54=9, yes\n\nt=19: -56+57=1 >0? 1 ≤0 false, so not.\n\nAnd t=14: -56+42= -14 ≤0, but 0 ≤ -45+42= -3? 0 ≤ -3 false, so no.\n\nSo freeway 1 has car covering x=0 at t=15,16,17,18 relative to turn 6.\n\nSo at absolute turns: turn 6+15=21, 22,23,24.\n\nRelative t, so at relative time t, absolute turn is t_1 + t = 6 + t.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous at t=15,16,17,18, so turns 21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) — τ=13, h=24, s=12\n\nSpan: [13 + 12t, 24 + 12t]\n\n0 in span: 13 + 12t ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12t\n\nBut 13 + 12t ≥ 13 >0 for t≥0, so 13+12t >0, thus 0 ≤ 24+12t always true, but 13+12t ≤0? 13+12t ≤0 only if t≤ -13/12, impossible since t≥0. So never 0 in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,12) τ=49, h=60, s=12\n\n[49+12t, 60+12t]\n\n49+12t ≥49>0, so 49+12t ≤0 impossible, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nSpan: [-35 + 12t, -24 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12t ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12t\n\nWhich is -35 + 12t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 + 12t\n\nFirst: -35 + 12t ≤ 0 ⇒ 12t ≤ 35 ⇒ t ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so t≤2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 12t ⇒ 24 ≤ 12t ⇒ t ≥ 2\n\nSo t=2 only.\n\nt=2: -35+24= -11 ≤0, 0≤ -24+24=0, yes.\n\nt=3: -35+36=1 >0? 1≤0 false, and 0≤ -24+36=12 true, but first inequality false.\n\nt=1: -35+12= -23≤0, 0≤ -24+12= -12? 0≤-12 false.\n\nSo only at t=2.\n\nThus for freeway 2, only the third car covers x=0 at t=2, so dangerous at relative t=2, absolute turn 6+2=8.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2, cars identical, so also dangerous only at t=2, turn 8.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, dangerous at t=2, turn 8.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (-30,-41,right,6) τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nSpan: [-41 + 6t, -30 + 6t]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 6t ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6t\n\nSo -41 + 6t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -30 + 6t\n\nFirst: -41 + 6t ≤ 0 ⇒ 6t ≤ 41 ⇒ t ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so t≤6\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30 + 6t ⇒ 30 ≤ 6t ⇒ t ≥ 5\n\nSo t=5,6\n\nt=5: -41+30= -11≤0, 0≤ -30+30=0, yes\n\nt=6: -41+36= -5≤0, 0≤ -30+36=6, yes\n\nt=4: -41+24= -17≤0, 0≤ -30+24= -6? false\n\nt=7: -41+42=1>0, false\n\nSo dangerous at t=5,6, turns 11,12.\n\nAbsolute: 6+5=11, 6+6=12.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, dangerous at t=5,6, turns 11,12.\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4) τ=-35, h=-24, s=4\n\nSpan: [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 4t ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 4t\n\nSo -35 + 4t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 + 4t\n\nFirst: -35 + 4t ≤ 0 ⇒ 4t ≤ 35 ⇒ t ≤ 35/4 = 8.75, so t≤8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 4t ⇒ 24 ≤ 4t ⇒ t ≥ 6\n\nSo t=6,7,8\n\nt=6: -35+24= -11≤0, 0≤ -24+24=0, yes\n\nt=7: -35+28= -7≤0, 0≤ -24+28=4, yes\n\nt=8: -35+32= -3≤0, 0≤ -24+32=8, yes\n\nt=5: -35+20= -15≤0, 0≤ -24+20= -4? false\n\nt=9: -35+36=1>0, false\n\nSo dangerous at t=6,7,8, turns 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, dangerous at t=6,7,8, turns 12,13,14.\n\nNow, freeway 9: but we need to reach y=9, which is a freeway? y=9 is the target, but cars are on y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, I assume. Similarly y=0 might have no cars, but we start from y=3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are boundaries, no freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when I'm on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. But I need to reach (0,9), so at that turn, I must be on y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start from y=3.\n\nNow, the player path: I start at turn t=6, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nI must avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nFor each y and each turn, I need to know if it is safe to be there.\n\nBut since the dangerous times are specific, I can list for each freeway the safe and dangerous times.\n\nFirst, y=1: dangerous at t=15,16,17,18 (relative to start, t=0 is turn 6)\n\nt=0: turn 6, but y=1 dangerous only at t=15,16,17,18 which are later.\n\nAt t=0, turn 6, is y=1 dangerous? From above, for y=1, dangerous only at t=15-18, so at t=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: dangerous at t=2 only, which is turn 8.\n\nAt t=0, turn 6, safe.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, dangerous at t=2, turn 8.\n\nAt t=0, turn 6, is it dangerous? t=2 is later, so at t=0, safe? Let me see.\n\nFor y=3, same as y=2 and y=4, dangerous only at t=2.\n\nt=2 relative, turn 8.\n\nSo at turn 6, t=0, for y=3, no danger, since only t=2 is dangerous for that row.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: dangerous at t=2, turn 8.\n\ny=5: dangerous at t=5,6, turns 11,12.\n\ny=6: dangerous at t=5,6, turns 11,12.\n\ny=7: dangerous at t=6,7,8, turns 12,13,14.\n\ny=8: dangerous at t=6,7,8, turns 12,13,14.\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe, no cars.\n\nNow, I start at turn 6, y=3, which is safe at turn 6.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal number of up moves: from y=3 to y=9, need 6 up moves. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid being on a row when dangerous.\n\nSince I can only change y by ±1 or 0 each turn, and I start at t=6, y=3.\n\nI want to reach y=9 in min turns, so I should go up when possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous turns for each y:\n\ny=1: dangerous at turns 21,22,23,24\n\ny=2: dangerous only at turn 8\n\ny=3: dangerous only at turn 8\n\ny=4: dangerous only at turn 8\n\ny=5: dangerous at turns 11,12\n\ny=6: dangerous at turns 11,12\n\ny=7: dangerous at turns 12,13,14\n\ny=8: dangerous at turns 12,13,14\n\ny=9: always safe\n\ny=0: always safe, but I don't want to go there probably.\n\nNow, turn 8 is dangerous for y=2,3,4.\n\nTurns 11,12 dangerous for y=5,6\n\nTurns 12,13,14 dangerous for y=7,8\n\nAnd later for y=1.\n\nSince I start at turn 6, y=3.\n\nTurn 6: y=3, safe.\n\nNow, turn 7: I can choose to go U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, to y=4 at turn 7.\n\nIf S, stay y=3.\n\nIf D, to y=2.\n\nNow, at turn 7, what rows are dangerous?\n\ny=2: dangerous only turn 8, so turn 7 safe for all except later.\n\nAt turn 7: y=1 safe, y=2 safe (danger only turn 8), y=3 safe (danger turn 8), y=4 safe (turn 8), y=5 safe (danger turns 11,12), similarly y=6,7,8 all safe at turn 7.\n\ny=7 dangerous from turn 12, etc.\n\nSo at turn 7, all rows are safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 8 is dangerous for y=2,3,4.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2,3, or 4 at turn 8.\n\nSince I start at turn 6, y=3, which is safe at turn 6.\n\nI need to be not on y=2,3,4 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8 is two turns from now.\n\nAt turn 6: I am at y=3.\n\nAfter one action (turn 6 action), I move to y_{turn7}.\n\nThen at turn 7, I choose action to go to y_{turn8}.\n\ny_{turn7} is set at turn 7, after action at turn 6.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, I am at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCollision at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and there is car on that row with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nFor turn T=6, I am at y=3, and as above, no car at turn 6 for y=3, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for turns starting from t_1=6.\n\nLet me denote the actions at turn t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nBut in the sequence, it's for turns t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nSet T_abs as absolute turn.\n\nStart T=6, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns, including the start? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1, I take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe position after H actions: start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, y_{t_1} =3.\n\nAfter first action (at turn t_1), I go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t_1 + k, I am at y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T, for some T.\n\nMin T - t_1 such that y_T =9.\n\nH = T - t_1 + 1? Let's see.\n\nIf I reach at turn t_1 + H - 1, then the number of turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1 is H turns.\n\nFor example, if H=1, only turn t_1, and I am at y=9 at turn t_1, but I start at y=3, so impossible in one turn.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 3 to 9, min 6 up moves, so at least 6 turns if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might need to wait or detour.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nAt turn 8, I must not be on y=2,3,4.\n\nTurn 8 is absolute turn 8.\n\nt_1=6, so turn 8 is t=2 relative.\n\nNow, at turn 6 (T=6), I choose action.\n\nAfter action, at turn 7, y_7.\n\nThen at turn 7, I choose action for turn 8.\n\ny_8 must not be 2,3,4.\n\nAlso, at turn 7, all rows are safe, as established.\n\nNow, I am at y=3 at turn 6.\n\nOptions at turn 6:\n\n- If I go U, to y=4 at turn 7.\n\n- If S, to y=3 at turn 7.\n\n- If D, to y=2 at turn 7.\n\nNow, at turn 7, I need to go to a position such that at turn 8, y_8 not in {2,3,4}.\n\nSince y_8 = y_7 + a_7, where a_7 is U, D, S.\n\ny_8 can be y_7-1, y_7, y_7+1.\n\nBut y_8 must be not 2,3,4.\n\nSo possible y_8: 0,1,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, but y=9 is target, I might not reach yet.\n\nNow, from y_7, I can choose to go to y_8.\n\nAlso, at turn 7, no danger, so I can be anywhere except I need to set for turn 8.\n\nMoreover, I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up when possible.\n\nBut at turn 8, I need to avoid y=2,3,4.\n\nNow, let's consider cases.\n\nFirst, suppose at turn 6, I go up to y=4 at turn 7.\n\nThen at turn 7, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to choose action so that y_8 not in {2,3,4}.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy.\n\nIf I go U, to y=5.\n\nIf S, to y=4.\n\nIf D, to y=3.\n\nBut y_8 cannot be 3 or 4, so I cannot stay or go down, only option is to go up to y=5.\n\ny=5 is not in {2,3,4}, so ok.\n\nSo from y=4 at turn 7, I must go U to y=5 at turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 8, I am at y=5.\n\nNow, is y=5 safe at turn 8? y=5 dangerous at turns 11 and 12, turn 8 is before, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 6 I stay, to y=3 at turn 7.\n\nThen at turn 7, y=3, I need to go to y_8 not in {2,3,4}.\n\nOptions: U to y=4, but y=4 is forbidden at turn 8.\n\nS to y=3, forbidden.\n\nD to y=2, forbidden.\n\nAll options lead to y_8 in {2,3,4}, which is dangerous at turn 8.\n\nTherefore, if I stay at turn 6, I end up at turn 8 on y=3 or 2 or 4, all dangerous.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If a_6 = S, y_7 =3\n\nThen at turn 7, if U, y_8=4, dangerous\n\nIf S, y_8=3, dangerous\n\nIf D, y_8=2, dangerous\n\nAll bad.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 6 I go down to y=2 at turn 7.\n\nThen at turn 7, y=2, I need to go to y_8 not in {2,3,4}.\n\nIf U to y=3, forbidden\n\nS to y=2, forbidden\n\nD to y=1, y=1 is not in {2,3,4}, so possible.\n\ny=1 at turn 8: is it dangerous? y=1 dangerous only at turns 21-24, turn 8 is fine, safe.\n\nSo I could go D to y=1.\n\nBut then I am at y=1, which is lower, might take more time to reach y=9.\n\nBut possible.\n\nFrom above, if I start by going up at turn 6, I can be at y=5 at turn 8.\n\nIf I stay or down, I might go to y=1 or something.\n\nBut to minimize time, going up is better.\n\nNow, another option: at turn 6, if I go down to y=2 at turn 7, then at turn 7 go down to y=1 at turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 8, y=1, safe.\n\nBut y=1 is low.\n\nThen I need to go up to y=9, which will take more turns.\n\nWhereas if I go up to y=5 by turn 8, I am higher.\n\nSo probably better to go up.\n\nNow, at turn 6, I go U to y=4 at turn 7.\n\nThen at turn 7, I go U to y=5 at turn 8.\n\nNow, at turn 8, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, turn 8: I am at y=5, choose action for turn 9.\n\ny=5 is safe at turn 8, as above.\n\nNow, turn 9: what is dangerous?\n\nAt turn 9, which rows are dangerous?\n\ny=1: dangerous turns 21-24, safe\n\ny=2: dangerous only turn 8, safe\n\ny=3: only turn 8, safe\n\ny=4: only turn 8, safe\n\ny=5: dangerous turns 11,12, turn 9 before, safe\n\ny=6: dangerous turns 11,12, safe\n\ny=7: dangerous turns 12,13,14, turn 9 before, safe\n\ny=8: dangerous turns 12,13,14, safe\n\nSo at turn 9, all rows safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 10 should be safe, let's confirm.\n\ny=5 dangerous at 11,12; y=6 at 11,12; y=7 at 12,13,14; so at turn 10, all safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=5 and y=6 dangerous.\n\ny=5 dangerous at 11 and 12, y=6 at 11 and 12.\n\ny=7 dangerous from 12, so at turn 11, y=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at turn 11.\n\nTurn 12: y=5,6,7,8 all dangerous? y=5 and 6 dangerous, y=7 dangerous, y=8 dangerous.\n\ny=5 dangerous at 11 and 12, so turn 12 dangerous for y=5.\n\ny=6 dangerous at 11 and 12.\n\ny=7 dangerous at 12,13,14.\n\ny=8 dangerous at 12,13,14.\n\nSo at turn 12, y=5,6,7,8 all dangerous.\n\nI must not be on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, y=5 and y=6 dangerous, but y=7 and y=8 safe.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at y=5.\n\nI can go U, D, or S.\n\nI want to go to y=9.\n\nTo avoid turn 12 danger.\n\nTurn 12 is absolute turn 12.\n\nt_1=6, so relative t=6.\n\nNow, at turn 8, I am y=5.\n\nTurn 9 and 10 are safe for all.\n\nTurn 11: dangerous for y=5 and y=6.\n\nTurn 12: dangerous for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some point, which is safe.\n\nNow, possible to reach y=9 before turn 12 or after.\n\nIf I can reach by turn 11, for example.\n\nTurn 8: y=5\n\nTurn 9: if I go U, to y=6\n\nOr S to y=5, or D to y=4.\n\nBut I want to go up.\n\nTurn 10, etc.\n\nSince turn 11 is dangerous for y=5 and y=6, I must not be on y=5 or y=6 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, not on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, y=9 is safe.\n\nAlso, y=0,1,2,3,4 are safe at turn 11 and 12, except y=4 is safe since danger only turn 8.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 all safe at turn 11 and 12.\n\nNow, from turn 8, y=5.\n\nI can go up to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y=6 is safe, since danger only turns 11,12.\n\nThen at turn 9, I am at y=6.\n\nThen turn 10: I can go U to y=7, or S, or D.\n\ny=7 at turn 10: safe, since danger from turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 10, if I go to y=7.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am at y=7.\n\nBut turn 11, y=7 is safe, because y=7 dangerous only from turn 12.\n\ny=7 dangerous at 12,13,14, so turn 11 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, I can be on y=7.\n\nThen at turn 11, I choose action to go to y_{12}.\n\nBut at turn 12, I must not be on y=7, because dangerous.\n\ny_{12} must not be 5,6,7,8.\n\nSo from y=7 at turn 11, I need to go to y_{12} not in {5,6,7,8}.\n\nOptions: U to y=8, forbidden\n\nS to y=7, forbidden\n\nD to y=6, forbidden\n\nAll lead to y=6,7,8, all forbidden at turn 12.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at turn 10 I go directly to y=8 or something.\n\nFrom turn 8: y=5\n\nTurn 9: I go U to y=6 (safe)\n\nTurn 10: I could go U to y=7 (safe)\n\nThen at turn 11, y=7, safe.\n\nBut then at turn 11, I need to go to y_{12}.\n\ny_{12} must be not 5,6,7,8.\n\nFrom y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8, all forbidden.\n\nI could go down to y=6 or something, but same.\n\nOr stay, but y=7 at turn 12 dangerous.\n\nSo impossible to go to y=7 at turn 11 if I want to avoid turn 12 on low rows.\n\nI need to be on a row where I can go to y=9 or y=4, etc., at turn 12.\n\ny_{12} can be 0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\ny=9 is possible if I can reach.\n\nBut from y=7 at turn 11, I can only reach y=6,7,8 at turn 12.\n\nNone of which are safe except if I go to y=8, but dangerous.\n\ny=8 is dangerous at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, all forbidden.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=6 at turn 11, same problem.\n\nAt turn 11, if I am on y=6, I can go to y=5,6,7 at turn 12, all dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=5 at turn 11, to y=4,5,6, y=4 safe but y=5 and6 dangerous.\n\nBut y=4 is safe.\n\nBut I need to not be on high rows at turn 11 if I can't escape.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nI must not be on y=5 or y=6 at turn 11.\n\nBecause if I am, I have to go to a dangerous row at turn 12 or stay dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 11, I must not be on y=5 or y=6, since if I am, and I go to y_{12}, it must be one of y=4,5,6 or y=5,6,7 etc., and y=5,6 are dangerous at turn 12, and y=4 is safe but from y=5 or6 I can go to y=4? From y=5 at turn 11, I can go D to y=4 at turn 12.\n\ny=4 is safe at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6, go D to y=5, dangerous, or to y=7, dangerous, or S to y=6 dangerous, so only if I can go down to y=4? From y=6, go D to y=5, which is dangerous, not good.\n\ny=6 to y=5 is down, but y=5 dangerous at turn 12.\n\nTo go to y=4 from y=6, I need two downs, but from turn 11 to turn 12, only one action, so y_{12} = y_11 + Δy, so from y=6, y_12 can be 5,6,7.\n\nAll dangerous at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, if I am on y=6 at turn 11, I cannot avoid being on a dangerous row at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=5 at turn 11, y_12 can be 4,5,6.\n\ny=4 is safe, y=5 dangerous, y=6 dangerous.\n\nSo I can go to y=4 at turn 12.\n\ny=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=7 at turn 11, I can only go to 6,7,8, all dangerous, no safe option.\n\ny=8 at turn 11: y=8 dangerous only from turn 12, so turn 11 safe.\n\nBut at turn 11, y=8, I can go to y=7,8,9 at turn 12.\n\ny=7 dangerous, y=8 dangerous, y=9 safe.\n\nSo I can go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=4 at turn 11, I can go to y=3,4,5; y=5 dangerous, but y=3 and y=4 safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nTo avoid being stuck, I should not be on y=5 or y=6 at turn 11, because:\n\n- If on y=5, I can go down to y=4 at turn 12, safe.\n\n- If on y=6, I cannot go to a safe row at turn 12, since 5,6,7 all dangerous.\n\n- If on y=7, I can go to y=9 if possible, or down to dangerous.\n\nBut from y=7, I can go to y=8 or y=9? y=8 to y=9 is one step.\n\nFrom y=7 at turn 11, go U to y=8 at turn 12, but y=8 dangerous at turn 12, collision.\n\nGo S to y=7, dangerous.\n\nGo D to y=6, dangerous.\n\nAll bad, so I cannot be on y=7 at turn 11 either.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at turn 11: I can go U to y=9 at turn 12, which is safe.\n\nOr S to y=8 dangerous, D to y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo only if I go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable yet.\n\nNow, summary for turn 11:\n\n- If on y=5, I can go to y=4 at turn 12 (safe)\n\n- If on y=6, no safe move to turn 12\n\n- If on y=7, no safe move to turn 12\n\n- If on y=8, I can go to y=9 at turn 12 if possible\n\n- If on y=4, I can go to y=3,4,5; y=5 dangerous, so go to y=3 or 4 safe.\n\n- Etc.\n\nTo have options, I should be on y=8 at turn 11 to go to y=9 at turn 12, or on y=5 to go to y=4, etc.\n\nBut I want to reach high, so better to be high.\n\nNow, from turn 8, I am at y=5.\n\nI need to be at turn 11 not on y=6 or y=7.\n\nTurn 8: y=5\n\nTurn 9: I can go U to y=6, or S to y=5, or D to y=4.\n\nBut if I go U to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nThen turn 10: from y=6, I can go U to y=7, S to y=6, D to y=5.\n\nBut at turn 11, I must not be on y=6 or y=7.\n\nSo if at turn 9 I am at y=6, then at turn 10, I need to go to a position where at turn 11 I am not y=6 or y=7.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\nIf I go to y=7 at turn 10, then y_11 could be 6,7,8\n\nIf to y=6, y_11=5,6,7\n\nIf to y=5, y_11=4,5,6\n\nTo avoid y=6 or y=7 at turn 11, I need y_11 <=5 or >=8.\n\ny_11=4,5,8,9\n\nBut from y=6 at turn 10, I can go to y=5,6,7.\n\nSo y_11 can be 5,6,7.\n\nI need y_11 <=5 or >=8, so only possibility is y_11=5.\n\nSo I must go down to y=5 at turn 11.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous at turn 11.\n\ny=5 dangerous at turn 11, so I cannot be on y=5 at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, if I am at y=6 at turn 10, I must go to y_11=5,6,7, all of which are either dangerous or lead to problem.\n\ny_11=5 dangerous, y_11=6 dangerous, y_11=7 not dangerous at turn 11 but then stuck for turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 11, y=5 and y=6 are dangerous, so I must not be on them at turn 11.\n\ny=7 is safe at turn 11, but as above, no good for turn 12.\n\nBut for turn 11 itself, I must avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at turn 11.\n\nBecause they are dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 is safe at turn 11.\n\nSo in this case, from y=6 at turn 10, if I go to y=7 at turn 11, y=7 is safe at turn 11, but then at turn 11 I have the problem for turn 12.\n\nBut for turn 11, it is ok to be on y=7.\n\nThe collision is only at the turn when I am on the row and car covers 0.\n\nAt turn 11, if on y=5 or y=6, collision.\n\nIf on y=7, no collision at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, I need to choose action for turn 12.\n\nBut as before, from y=7, no good action.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 10 I go down to y=5 from y=6, then at turn 11 on y=5, collision.\n\nOr stay, on y=6, collision.\n\nSo all bad.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=6 at turn 10, because then at turn 11 I must be on y=5,6,7, and y=5 and6 are dangerous, y=7 is safe but then stuck.\n\nIf I am at y=6 at turn 10, and I go to y=7 at turn 11, y=7 safe at turn 11, no collision.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am on y=7, and I need to go to y_12.\n\nBut y_12 must not be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFrom y=7, I can go to y=6,7,8, all forbidden.\n\nI could go down to y=6, but dangerous, or up to y=8 dangerous.\n\nNo, I have to choose an action, but all lead to collision at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=7 at turn 11, because I cannot avoid collision at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6 at turn 11.\n\nThe only ways to avoid turn 12 collision are:\n\n- Be on y=8 at turn 11 and go up to y=9 at turn 12\n\n- Be on y=5 at turn 11 and go down to y=4 at turn 12\n\n- Be on y=4 at turn 11 and go to y=3 or 4 or 5; but y=5 dangerous, so go to y=3 or 4\n\n- Be on y=3 or lower, go to safe low row.\n\nBut to reach y=9, better to be high.\n\nNow, back to turn 8.\n\nI am at y=5.\n\nIf I go down to y=4 at turn 9, for example.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=4.\n\nTurn 9 safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, I can go to y=5,4,3, etc.\n\nBut I need to position for turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, I must not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nSo I can be on y=4, or y=7, or y=8, etc.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe at turn 11.\n\nFrom turn 8 y=5, I can go S to y=5 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y=5 is safe, since danger at 11 and 12.\n\nThen at turn 9, I am at y=5.\n\nThen turn 10: I can go U to y=6, or S to y=5, or D to y=4.\n\nAt turn 11, I must not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nSo if I go U to y=6 at turn 10, then y_11=6, dangerous.\n\nIf S to y=5, y_11=5, dangerous.\n\nIf D to y=4, y_11=4, safe.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=4 at turn 10, to be at y=4 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn 11, I can choose action for turn 12.\n\ny_12 must not be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go U to y=5, dangerous\n\nS to y=4, safe\n\nD to y=3, safe\n\nSo I can stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nFrom turn 11 y=4, if I go U to y=5 at turn 12, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo S to y=4 at turn 12, safe, but not progress.\n\nOr D to y=3, safe.\n\nBut I am low.\n\nThen later I need to go up.\n\nBut turn 12 is dangerous for high rows, but after that, it might be ok.\n\nLet's list the dangerous turns again.\n\nDangerous turns:\n\nTurn 8: y=2,3,4 dangerous\n\nTurn 11: y=5,6 dangerous\n\nTurn 12: y=5,6,7,8 dangerous\n\nTurn 13: y=7,8 dangerous\n\nTurn 14: y=7,8 dangerous\n\nTurn 15: y=7,8? No, y=7 dangerous at 12,13,14; y=8 at 12,13,14.\n\ny=7 dangerous turns 12,13,14; y=8 turns 12,13,14.\n\nAfter that, only y=1 at turns 21-24, which is late.\n\nSo after turn 14, all rows safe except y=1 later, but I can be on y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, I should try to be high before turn 12 or after.\n\nBut at turn 12, I can be on y=9 if possible.\n\nNow, from turn 8, I am at y=5.\n\nI can go directly to higher rows.\n\nTurn 8: y=5\n\nTurn 9: go U to y=6 (safe)\n\nTurn 10: go U to y=7 (safe, turn 10 safe)\n\nThen at turn 10, y=7.\n\nTurn 11: from y=7, I can go U to y=8 (safe, since y=8 safe at turn 11)\n\nThen at turn 11, y=8.\n\nThen at turn 11, I can go U to y=9 at turn 12.\n\ny=9 at turn 12 is safe, no cars.\n\nAnd y=9 is the target.\n\nLet's see if this works.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: start y=3\n\nTurn 6 action: U, to y=4 at turn 7\n\nTurn 7 action: U, to y=5 at turn 8\n\nTurn 8 action: U, to y=6 at turn 9\n\nTurn 9 action: U, to y=7 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10 action: U, to y=8 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11 action: U, to y=9 at turn 12\n\nAt turn 12, y=9, which is safe, and we reach (0,9) at turn 12.\n\nNow, check for collisions at each turn.\n\nTurn 6: y=3, safe, no car\n\nTurn 7: y=4, at turn 7, safe, no danger\n\nTurn 8: y=5, at turn 8, y=5 dangerous at 11 and 12, not at 8, so safe\n\nTurn 9: y=6, dangerous at 11 and 12, not 9, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=7, dangerous at 12,13,14, not 10, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=8, dangerous at 12,13,14, turn 11 before, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nAt turn 12, I am at y=9, so I reach at turn 12.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1=6 to t_1 + H -1 =12.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =12, t_1=6, so 6 + H -1 =12, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nTurns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12: that's 7 turns.\n\nActions from turn 6 to turn 12? At turn 12, I take action to go to y_{13}, but since I reach y=9 at turn 12, I don't need to take action after that.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at the last turn, I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn 12, I am at y=9, so I don't take action for turn 13.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn 12, I take action a_{12}, which determines y_{13}, but since I want to be at y=9 at turn 12, I don't care about y_{13}.\n\nIn this case, at turn 12, I am at y=9, so for the action at turn 12, I can choose anything, but since I already reached, I can choose S or whatever, but to stop, I can choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify actions until the turn I reach.\n\nIn this path, I reach at turn 12.\n\nNow, check if all positions are safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=5, safe (danger at 11,12)\n\nTurn 9: y=6, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=7, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=8, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=9, safe\n\nNo collisions.\n\nAnd I used all U actions except the last one might not be needed, but I have to take action at each turn until I reach.\n\nAt turn 12, I take action a_{12}, but since I am at y=9, I can take S to stay, or U but y cannot be 10, so U invalid, or D to y=8, but I don't want to leave.\n\nThe position at turn T is after action at T-1? No.\n\nAt turn T, before action, I am at y_T.\n\nThen I choose a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn 12, I am at y=9, which is the target, so I don't need to move further.\n\nIn the action sequence, I take actions from turn 6 to turn 11 to reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\n- At turn 6: position y=3\n\n- Action a6: U, so y7 = y6 +1 =4\n\n- Turn 7: position y=4\n\n- Action a7: U, y8=5\n\n- Turn 8: position y=5\n\n- Action a8: U, y9=6\n\n- Turn 9: position y=6\n\n- Action a9: U, y10=7\n\n- Turn 10: position y=7\n\n- Action a10: U, y11=8\n\n- Turn 11: position y=8\n\n- Action a11: U, y12=9\n\n- Turn 12: position y=9, reached.\n\nSo actions from turn 6 to turn 11, that's 6 actions: a6 to a11.\n\nH=6, since from t=0 to t=H-1, with H-1=5? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=6, so a6, a7, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nHere, at turn 12, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =12.\n\nt_1=6, so 6 + H -1 =12, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions: t from 0 to 6, a6 to a11? t=0: a6, t=1: a7, ..., t=5: a11? Let's list:\n\nt=0: action at t_1 +0 =6\n\nt=1: action at 7\n\n...\n\nt=k: action at 6+k\n\nAt turn after action, position at turn 7 for a6, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAfter a6 (turn 6 action), position at turn 7: y=4\n\nAfter a7 (turn 7), position turn 8: y=5\n\n...\n\nAfter a11 (turn 11), position turn 12: y=9\n\nSo at turn 12, y=9, which is reached after H actions? Actions from turn 6 to 11, that's 6 actions (turns 6,7,8,9,10,11), so H=6.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =6 +6 -1=11, but at turn 11, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the actions be taken at turns T = t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAfter taking action at turn T, we move to position at turn T+1.\n\nThe position at turn T is fixed before action.\n\nWe want that at some turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nAnd T_final = t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the action sequence, we take actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after these H actions, we are at position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t_1 + H -1, before action, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 12, before action, we are at y=9, so T_final=12.\n\nt_1=6, so t_1 + H -1 =12, so 6 + H -1=12, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions from turn 6 to turn 12? But at turn 12, if we are already at y=9, we might not need to take action, but the sequence includes actions up to the turn we reach, I think.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to the last action.\n\nBut at the turn when we are at y=9, we take an action, but it might not affect since we are already there.\n\nIn this case, for turn 12, if we are at y=9, we can take S to stay, or whatever.\n\nIn the path I described, at turn 12, we are at y=9, so we need to take action a_{12}, but since we are at y=9, we can take S to stay at y=9 for turn 13, but we don't care.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 12, we need to have arrived there by action at turn 11.\n\nIn terms of the sequence:\n\n- At turn 6: position y=3, take action a6=U, so y7=4\n\n- Turn 7: position y=4, take a7=U, y8=5\n\n- Turn 8: position y=5, take a8=U, y9=6\n\n- Turn 9: position y=6, take a9=U, y10=7\n\n- Turn 10: position y=7, take a10=U, y11=8\n\n- Turn 11: position y=8, take a11=U, y12=9\n\n- Turn 12: position y=9, reached.\n\nSo to reach at turn 12, we take actions from turn 6 to turn 11, that's 6 actions, but H should be such that turn t_1 + H -1 =12, so 6 + H -1=12, H=7.\n\nWith H=7, actions from t=0 to 6: a6 to a11? t=0: a_{t1+0}=a6, t=1:a7, ..., t=5:a11, but t from 0 to H-1=6? H=7, H-1=6, so t=0 to 6, actions a6 to a11? t=0: a6, t=1:a7, t=2:a8, t=3:a9, t=4:a10, t=5:a11, that's 6 actions, t=0 to 5 is 6 values, H-1=6? t from 0 to H-1 inclusive, so number of actions is H.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, H=1, t=0 only, one action.\n\nThen turn t1 + H -1 = t1 +0 =t1, and at turn t1, position should be 9.\n\nBut here we start at y=3, not 9.\n\nIn our case, with actions a6 to a11, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nThen turn t1 + H -1 =6 +6 -1=11, and at turn 11, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nWe want at turn 12 y=9, so turn t1 + H -1 should be 12.\n\nSo 6 + H -1 =12, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 6: a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, and a12.\n\nBut at turn 12, we take action a12, but we are already at y=9? At turn 12, before action, we are at y=9, then we take a12, which could be S, to stay at y=9 for turn 13.\n\nBut since we reached at turn 12, we can stop.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a12=S or something.\n\nIn the path above, with 6 up actions from turn 6 to 11, we reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nSo for the action sequence, we have actions for turn 6 to 11, all U, and at turn 12, we don't take action since we reached.\n\nBut the sequence should include actions until the last one before reaching or including?\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nIn this case, y_{12} =9, so t_1 + H -1 =12, 6+H-1=12, H=7.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 6: a6 to a12.\n\nBut at turn 12, we take action a12, but we are at y=9, so we can take S to stay.\n\nIn the path, to have y12=9, we need to have come from y11 with action.\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy_{11}, so if y11=8, a11=U, then y12=9.\n\nThen at turn 12, we are at y=9, and we take a12, say S, to have y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nSo in the sequence, we need a12.\n\nBut in terms of the actions, for turns 6 to 11, we have U, and for turn 12, we can have S.\n\nBut since we reached at turn 12, H=7 with a12=S.\n\nWe could reach earlier?\n\nIs it possible in fewer than 7 turns?\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps up, but with actions, if I go up every time, I reach in 6 actions, but at which turn?\n\nStart turn 6 y=3.\n\nAfter 1st action (turn 6 U): turn 7 y=4\n\n2nd action (turn 7 U): turn 8 y=5\n\n3rd action (turn 8 U): turn 9 y=6\n\n4th action (turn 9 U): turn 10 y=7\n\n5th action (turn 10 U): turn 11 y=8\n\n6th action (turn 11 U): turn 12 y=9\n\nSo after 6 actions, at turn 12 y=9.\n\nNow, to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, at turn 12, so t1 + H -1 =12, H=7.\n\nWith H=7, we have actions from t=0 to 6, a6 to a12.\n\nBut a6 to a11 are U, and a12 can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify.\n\nSince at turn 12 y=9, we can take a12 immediately.\n\nBut in this path, it works with no collision, as checked.\n\nBut earlier I thought about turn 8 danger, but in this path, at turn 8, I am at y=5, which is safe.\n\nAnd I avoided the turn 11 and 12 by being on y=8 at turn 11 and going to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 11, y=8 is safe, and at turn 12, y=9 is safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nCould I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can I reach y=9 by turn 11?\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 11, I need to be at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nFrom start y=3 at turn 6, in 5 turns: from turn 6 to turn 11, that's 5 steps? Turns: from turn 6 to turn 11, number of actions: to go from y=3 to y=9 in 5 actions.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so in 5 actions, I can reach at most y=8, since 3+5=8.\n\nStart y3, after 1 action y4, 2 y5, 3 y6, 4 y7, 5 y8, so after 5 actions, at turn 11, y=8.\n\nThen with 6th action at turn 11 U, to y9 at turn 12.\n\nSo minimum to reach y9 is at turn 12, with 6 up actions from turn 6 to 11.\n\nThus H=7 for the sequence including the action at turn 12 to stay or something.\n\nIn the sequence with H=7, actions a6 to a12, with a6 to a11 U, and a12 S.\n\nBut at turn 12, after a12 S, y13=9, but we don't care, since we reached at turn 12.\n\nThe position y_{t1+H-1} = y_{12} =9, which is satisfied.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but since we must specify the sequence until y=9 is reached, and H is min.\n\nIs there a way to reach at turn 11?\n\nSuppose I go faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so impossible to reach before turn 12.\n\nStart turn 6 y=3, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action (turn 6): min turn 7 y=4\n\nAfter 2: turn 8 y=5\n\n...\n\nAfter 5: turn 11 y=8\n\nAfter 6: turn 12 y=9\n\nSo earliest at turn 12.\n\nThus H=7 is minimum possible, since from turn 6 to turn 12, 7 turns included? Turns from 6 to 12 inclusive is 7 turns, but the position is at those turns.\n\nt1 + H -1 =12, with t1=6, H=7.\n\nNow, in the path, all actions U except last one S, but we can have a12=U, but y cannot be 10, so invalid, so must S or D, but D down, not good, so S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's fine.\n\nNow, in the beginning, I thought about going down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 6 to 11, and S at turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 12, we take action after reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 12, action a12.\n\nBut in the answer, we list actions starting from t1=6.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 2,3,4, they have cars, but in this path, I only was on y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=3 at turn 6: no car\n\ny=4 at turn 7: no car\n\ny=5 at turn 8: no car at that time\n\netc., all safe.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 have dangerous at turn 8, but I was not on them at turn 8; at turn 8 I was on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = U (for turn 6)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{7} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1 = turn 12, action a_{12}\n\nWith H=7, so turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12\n\nActions: for turn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S (since y=9, cannot go up)\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut in the action for turn 12, S is to stay, so y remains 9.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 11, action U to go to y=12? No, at turn 11, position y=8, action U to go to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 12, position y=9, action S to stay.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, but I was on them at safe times.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, y=7, which is freeway 7, dangerous at 12,13,14, turn 10 safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11 y=8, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is minimal and safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about turn 8, but it was fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7.\n\nSequence of actions.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must move upwards as much as possible, except at the final turn where staying is required since \\(y = 9\\) is the target and moving up is invalid.\n\nThe car configurations and their dangerous times (when a car spans \\(x = 0\\)) have been analyzed for each freeway:\n- Freeway 1: Dangerous at turns 21, 22, 23, 24.\n- Freeway 2: Dangerous at turn 8.\n- Freeway 3: Dangerous at turn 8.\n- Freeway 4: Dangerous at turn 8.\n- Freeway 5: Dangerous at turns 11, 12.\n- Freeway 6: Dangerous at turns 11, 12.\n- Freeway 7: Dangerous at turns 12, 13, 14.\n- Freeway 8: Dangerous at turns 12, 13, 14.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 6, which is safe. To minimize \\(H\\), the player should move up at every opportunity, as this requires at least 6 up moves to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 3\\). However, due to the discrete movement and the need to avoid dangerous times, the earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 12, achieved with the following sequence:\n- At turn 6, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as no danger at turn 6).\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as no danger at turn 7).\n- At turn 8, move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is dangerous at turns 11 and 12, not turn 8).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is dangerous at turns 11 and 12, not turn 9).\n- At turn 10, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous at turns 12, 13, 14, not turn 10).\n- At turn 11, move up to \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is dangerous at turns 12, 13, 14, not turn 11).\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) is the target and has no cars, the player stays (action S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12, so \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\). With \\(t_1 = 6\\), solving \\(6 + H - 1 = 12\\) gives \\(H = 7\\). The sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 12 achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns without any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The vertical position y must be in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (which is one of 1..8) and at that turn, the x=0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNote: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y (so only the cars on freeway y at turn T matter). Then at the next turn, the player will be on y'.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (which is 7). For future turns T (>=t1), we can compute the car positions.\n\nFor a car given by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1:\n- For a right-moving car (d='right'): \n   At turn T, the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n   because at t1: span is [tau, head] (with tau<=head) and then it moves right by s*(T-t1) per unit time.\n\nBut note: in the table, for a right-moving car, the span is given as (head, tail) but the note says: \n   For right: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, in the table, the representation is: (head, tail, direction, speed). \nLooking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) -> so head = -42, tail = -53? But note: the representation says for right-moving: [tau, h] meaning [tail, head] and tail should be less than head? \nBut -53 < -42, so that's consistent: the car spans from -53 to -42 at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (36,25,right,12) -> but 25<36? Actually, 25 is the tail and 36 is the head? But the representation says: (head, tail) so head=36, tail=25? Then the span is [25,36] at t1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning [tail, head]. So if we have (head, tail) in the table, then we must interpret the first number as head and the second as tail? \n\nYes, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nSo for a right car: at t1, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h). Then at time T, the car is from tau + s*(T-t1) to h + s*(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly, for left: but we don't have any left in this problem? Actually, all cars in this state are right-moving? \n\nLooking at the table: all directions are \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nTherefore, for a car (h, tau, 'right', s) at turn t1, at turn T (>=t1), the car's span is:\n   [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T: if the player is on freeway k at turn T (so y_T = k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nOur goal: start at turn 7 at y=4, and we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, without colliding on any freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe must avoid freeways 1 to 8 only when we are on them and a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are allowed to be on y=0 and y=9 without worrying about cars? Because the freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo we start at turn 7 at y=4.\n\nWe can plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move to y=9.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn t1 (which is 7) for H turns, so that at the last turn (turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nLet me denote the time steps: \n   Turn 7: we are at y=4.\n\nAt turn 7, we choose an action a_7 that will determine y_8? Actually:\n\n   At turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t. Then:\n        y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at the same turn, we are at y_t and then we move to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn t, we are on freeway y_t. So at turn 7, we are at y=4 -> freeway 4? But note: freeways are y=1 to 8. So y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nTherefore, at turn 7, we are on freeway 4. So we must check if at turn 7, on freeway 4, is there a car that has 0 in its span?\n\nWe have the car state at turn t1=7 for freeway 4: \n   Cars: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nWe need to compute at T=7 (current turn) for each car on freeway 4:\n\nFor car1: (h=36, tau=25, right, s=12) -> span at T=7: [25, 36]? Actually, at T=7 (which is t1, so T-t1=0) -> [25+0, 36+0] = [25,36]. Is 0 in [25,36]? No.\n\nCar2: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> span at T=7: [-59, -48]. 0 is not in [-59,-48].\n\nCar3: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> span at T=7: [-23, -12]. 0 is not in [-23,-12].\n\nSo at turn 7, we are safe on freeway 4.\n\nNow, we can choose an action at turn 7: U (go to 5), D (go to 3), or S (stay at 4).\n\nWe want to get to 9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves? Without cars, we need 5 moves (from 4 to 9: 5 steps up). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and check for collisions at each turn.\n\nWe'll consider BFS (breadth-first search) over the state: (time, y) and record the minimal steps to reach (y=9) from (t=7, y=4). Time starts at 7 and increases. We are not bounded in time? But we want minimal H.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving and their positions change linearly. We can compute at any future turn T the position of each car.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 7) and y in [0,9]. We start at (7,4). We want to reach any (t,9) and then we stop at that turn.\n\nWe can define:\n\n   state: (t, y)\n\nWe can go to (t+1, y') where y' = y + { -1,0,1 } (clamped to [0,9]).\n\nBut we must check: at the state (t, y) we are at turn t at position y. So we must check if at turn t, if y is in [1,8] (freeway), then we must avoid collision.\n\nSo for a state (t, y) we must check:\n\n   if y in {1,2,...,8}: then we must check all cars on freeway y at turn t. \n        For each car on freeway y: \n            span = [tau + s*(t-t1), h + s*(t-t1)]   (t1=7)\n        and if 0 is in any of these spans, then this state is invalid.\n\nNote: the car configuration for each freeway is fixed at t1. So we know which cars are on which freeway at t1, and they move as described.\n\nWe have the car list per freeway at t1. We can precompute for each freeway and each car the linear function of the span.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway do not change? The problem does not say anything about cars entering or leaving. So we assume the same set of cars per freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and each car on k, the span at time t (>=7) is:\n\n   [tau + s*(t-7), h + s*(t-7)]\n\nThen at a state (t, y) with y=k (a freeway), we check if 0 is in any of the spans of the cars on freeway k at time t.\n\nWe must also note: when we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't check.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns (H) which is the number of actions. Since we start at turn 7, and we take H actions: at turn 7 we take the first action (which will lead to y at turn 8), then at turn 7+H-1 we take the last action that leads to y=9 at turn 7+H.\n\nBut note: we are at (7,4). Then after an action at turn 7, we are at turn 8 at y5 (if we go up) or y3 (if down) or y4 (if stay).\n\nWe want to have at some turn T (>=7) that y_T=9. And we want the minimal T-7+1? Actually, the problem says: we take actions from t1 (7) to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions. We start at turn 7, and we take H actions: at turn 7, 8, ... up to turn 7+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H steps and we are at turn 7+H? Actually:\n\n   At turn 7: we are at y_7 = 4.\n   Then we do action a_7 -> then at turn 8, we are at y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\n   After H actions, we are at turn 7+H, and the last action was at turn 7+H-1.\n\nBut the condition is: we must be at (0,9) at the last turn? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we are at (0,9). And the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1: so a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then after these H actions, we have moved H steps. So the turn after the last action is t1+H. But we are to be at (0,9) at the last action? \n\nActually, the player update: after action at t, we get y_{t+1}. So:\n\n   At turn t1: we are at y_{t1} = 4.\n   Action a_{t1} (at turn t1) leads to y_{t1+1}.\n   ...\n   Action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1) leads to y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nTherefore, the state at the end of the sequence is (t1+H, 9). And we must avoid collision at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? Because at turn t (from t1 to t1+H-1), we are at y_t (which is set by the previous action) and then we take an action to go to y_{t+1}. But note: at turn t1+H, we are at y=9 and we don't take an action? So we only care about collisions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1? \n\nHowever, the collision condition says: at turn T, if the player is on a freeway (y_T in [1,8]) and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo we must avoid collision at every turn from T = t1 (which is 7) to T = t1+H-1 (the last turn we are taking an action) because at turn t1+H we are not taking an action? But we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H and we don't care about collision at turn t1+H? Because the problem says \"avoid collisions\" during the journey. And at turn t1+H, we have reached the goal, so we don't need to avoid collision at the goal? But note: if we are at y=9, it's not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid collisions at turns: 7, 8, ..., 7+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at turn 7+H, we are at y=9.\n\nSo in the state (t, y) we are at turn t and position y. We start at (7,4). We take an action and then we move to (t+1, y') and then we check the new state at (t+1, y')? But note: the collision check is for the state we are in at turn t.\n\nSo:\n\n   At state (t, y): we must check that if y in [1,8], then at turn t, the cars on freeway y do not cover 0.\n\nThen we choose an action, and then we move to (t+1, y') and then we check that state.\n\nTherefore, the BFS:\n\n   Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of actions taken to reach (t,y) from the start (which is (7,4)), and also we need to record the path.\n\n   But note: time is unbounded? However, we are moving in a grid of 10 states (y=0..9) and we can wait, but the cars are moving and eventually the cars might leave the x=0 area? Or not? \n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speed. Some cars might come back? Actually, they are moving to the right. Since they are moving to the right, eventually they will pass x=0 and then never come back? But wait: they are moving to the right and their spans are intervals. Once the entire car is beyond 0 to the right, then the left end (which is increasing) will be beyond 0. Similarly, if the car is to the left, it might come to 0.\n\nBut observe: the cars are moving at positive speeds to the right. So the entire span moves to the right. Therefore, for a car that is to the left of 0 at t1, it will eventually cover 0? Then move beyond? Similarly, a car that is to the right of 0 at t1 is already beyond? But wait: we have cars that are at negative positions and moving right: they will eventually cover 0 and then move to positive.\n\nSo the danger is when a car's span includes 0 at a particular turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and each car, the time intervals (if any) when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: the car's span at time t: [L(t), R(t)] = [tau + s*(t-7), h + s*(t-7)]\n\nWe require that 0 is in [L(t), R(t)]? \n   => L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)\n\nSolve for t (real) but t is integer (turn).\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\n   L(t) = tau + s*(t-7) <= 0\n   R(t) = h + s*(t-7) >= 0\n\nSo:\n   t >= (0 - tau) / s + 7   [if s>0, then inequality direction remains]\n   t <= (0 - h) / s + 7? Actually:\n\n   L(t) <= 0: tau + s*(t-7) <= 0  => t <= ( - tau) / s + 7? Wait:\n\n   tau + s*(t-7) <= 0  => s*(t-7) <= -tau  => t-7 <= -tau/s  => t <= 7 - tau/s.\n\nBut note: tau is negative? Then -tau is positive.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n   t_min = ceil( (0 - tau) / s ) + 7? Actually, we have:\n\n   tau + s*(t-7) <= 0   => t <= ( - tau) / s + 7   [if s>0]\n\nBut also: h + s*(t-7) >= 0  => t >= ( - h) / s + 7   [if s>0]\n\nWait, let me write:\n\n   Condition for 0 in [L(t), R(t)]:\n\n        L(t) <= 0 and R(t) >= 0\n\n        => tau + s*(t-7) <= 0   and   h + s*(t-7) >= 0\n\n        => s*(t-7) <= -tau   and   s*(t-7) >= -h\n\n        => ( -h ) / s <= (t-7) <= ( -tau ) / s   [because s>0]\n\nBut note: since the car is right-moving and tau < h (and both are integers?), and s>0.\n\nSo the time interval for which the car covers 0 is:\n\n        t in [ 7 + ceil( (-h) / s ), 7 + floor( (-tau) / s ) ]   ??? \n\nBut note: the inequalities are real. We must consider integer t.\n\nActually, we can compute:\n\n        t_min_candidate = ceil( ( -h ) / s + 7 )? \n\nBut let me do:\n\n        (t-7) must be at least (-h)/s and at most (-tau)/s.\n\n        So: t-7 >= (-h)/s   => t >= 7 + ceil( (-h)/s )   if (-h)/s is not integer? But we can use:\n\n        Let A = (-h)/s, and B = (-tau)/s.\n\n        Then t-7 must be an integer k such that: A <= k <= B.\n\n        So k_min = ceil(A), k_max = floor(B).\n\n        Then t in [7 + ceil(A), 7 + floor(B)].\n\nBut note: if A is integer, then ceil(A)=A, and if B is integer, then floor(B)=B.\n\nExample: take a car: (h=-12, tau=-23, s=12) on freeway 4 at t1=7.\n\nThen A = (-(-12))/12 = 12/12 = 1 -> integer.\n     B = (-(-23))/12 = 23/12 = 1.916...\n\nThen k_min = ceil(1)=1, k_max = floor(23/12)=1.\n\nSo t in [7+1, 7+1] = [8,8].\n\nSo at turn 8, this car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for car (36,25,12) on freeway 4: \n   A = (-36)/12 = -3 -> ceil(-3) = -3\n   B = (-25)/12 = -2.083... -> floor(-2.083) = -3? \n   Then k_min = ceil(-3) = -3, k_max = floor(-2.083) = -3? \n   Then t in [7-3, 7-3] = [4,4]. But we are starting at turn 7, so that's in the past? So at turn 7, this car is at [25,36] and moving right, so it passed 0 long ago? and won't come back.\n\nSimilarly, the car (-48,-59,12): \n   A = (-(-48))/12 = 48/12=4 -> integer\n   B = (-(-59))/12 = 59/12≈4.916 -> floor(4.916)=4\n   Then t in [7+4, 7+4] = [11,11].\n\nSo for freeway 4, we have:\n   car1: (36,25) -> no collision at t>=7.\n   car2: (-48,-59) -> collision at t=11.\n   car3: (-12,-23) -> collision at t=8.\n\nTherefore, at freeway 4:\n   unsafe at turns: 8 and 11.\n\nBut note: we have three cars. So freeway 4 is unsafe at t=8 and t=11.\n\nSimilarly, we must do this for every freeway and every car.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of turns T (>=7) for which there is at least one car covering 0.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent. So we can compute the union of the dangerous intervals for all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe'll create a set unsafe[k] = { t in [7, ...] such that freeway k is unsafe at turn t }\n\nBut note: we might not know the entire set because time is infinite? However, we are going to BFS until we find the goal. We can break when we have a path. Also, note that the cars move linearly and eventually, once a car passes 0 to the right, it never comes back. So for each car, the dangerous interval is a consecutive set of integers? Actually, a single interval? And then after that the car is beyond 0 and won't cover 0 again? \n\nYes, because the car moves only to the right. So each car causes a contiguous interval of danger? But note: the interval might be empty? \n\nSo for each freeway k, we can compute the union of intervals for the cars on k.\n\nBut note: the intervals might be non-overlapping? We can compute the set of dangerous turns for freeway k by taking the union of the intervals for each car.\n\nThen, in the BFS, when we are at (t,y) with y in [1,8], we check if t is in unsafe[y]. If yes, then this state is invalid.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the unsafe set as a set of integers.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nFreeway 1: \n   Cars: [ (-42, -53, right, 3) ]\n   Compute for car: \n        A = (-(-42))/3 = 42/3 = 14 -> integer\n        B = (-(-53))/3 = 53/3 ≈ 17.666 -> floor(53/3)=17\n        Then k_min = 14, k_max = 17? -> t in [7+14, 7+17] = [21,24]\n\n   So unsafe turns: 21,22,23,24.\n\nFreeway 2: \n   Cars: [ (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) ]\n\n   Car1: (36,25,12): \n        A = (-36)/12 = -3 -> ceil(-3)=-3, B = (-25)/12≈-2.083 -> floor(-2.083) = -3 -> t in [7-3,7-3] = [4,4] -> not in [7,inf) -> safe.\n\n   Car2: (-48,-59,12):\n        A = (48)/12=4 -> integer -> k_min=4\n        B = 59/12≈4.916 -> floor=4 -> k_max=4 -> t=7+4=11.\n\n   Car3: (-12,-23,12):\n        A = 12/12=1 -> k_min=1\n        B = 23/12≈1.916 -> floor=1 -> k_max=1 -> t=7+1=8.\n\n   So unsafe turns for freeway 2: {8, 11}\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n   The table says: same cars? \n        Cars: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n   So same as freeway 2: unsafe at t=8,11.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3? -> unsafe at t=8,11.\n\nFreeway 5: \n   Cars: [ (-24,-35,right,6) ]\n        A = (24)/6=4 -> k_min=4\n        B = 35/6≈5.833 -> floor=5 -> k_max=5\n        Then t in [7+4, 7+5] = [11,12]\n\n   So unsafe turns: 11,12.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n   Cars: [ (-24,-35,right,6) ] -> same as freeway 5: unsafe at 11,12.\n\nFreeway 7: \n   Cars: [ (-20,-31,right,4) ]\n        A = 20/4=5 -> k_min=5\n        B = 31/4=7.75 -> floor=7 -> k_max=7\n        Then t in [7+5, 7+7] = [12,14]\n\n   So unsafe: 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? \n   Cars: same -> unsafe at 12,13,14.\n\nSummary:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at {21,22,23,24}   (we might not need to go that far? because we can get to 9 in less than 10 moves? so we can ignore for now)\n\nFreeway 2: {8,11}\nFreeway 3: {8,11}\nFreeway 4: {8,11}\nFreeway 5: {11,12}\nFreeway 6: {11,12}\nFreeway 7: {12,13,14}\nFreeway 8: {12,13,14}\n\nNow, we plan a path from (7,4) to (t,9) for some t>=7, such that we avoid the unsafe turns when we are on a freeway.\n\nWe do BFS over (t,y) for t from 7 upwards and y in [0,9]. We start at (7,4) with 0 actions (but note we haven't taken any action yet, but we are already at turn 7). Then we will take actions to move to next turns.\n\nWe want to reach a state (t,9) for some t. Then the number of actions is t-7? \n\nWait: \n   At turn 7, we are at (7,4). Then we take an action at turn 7 to go to turn 8 at y5 (if U). Then we are at (8,5). Then we take an action at turn 8 to go to (9,?) etc.\n\nWe require that at the turn we arrive at 9, we don't have to avoid collision at that turn? Because we are at y=9 (not a freeway) and we are done. But note: the collision check is at the turn we are at the freeway. When we are at (t,9) we are safe. However, if we get to (t,9) at turn t, then we have taken actions from turn 7 to turn t-1? \n\nActually, the state (t,y) means that at turn t we are at y. To get to (7,4) we haven't taken any action at turn 7? But the problem says we are at turn 7 at (0,4). Then we start by taking an action at turn 7.\n\nSo we start at (7,4). Then we take an action at turn 7 which will lead us to (8, y8). So the state at turn 8 is (8, y8). We must check the state at turn 7: (7,4) is safe? We already did: at turn 7, freeway 4 is safe.\n\nWe then simulate:\n\n   We consider the next state: from (t,y) we choose an action (U,D,S) to get to (t+1, y') where y' = y + dy, clamped to [0,9].\n\n   But note: we must check the state (t,y): if y in [1,8] then we must check that t is not in the unsafe set for that freeway.\n\n   Then, we move to (t+1, y') and then we check that state at turn t+1? But we haven't taken the action for turn t+1 yet? Actually, when we are at (t,y), we are about to take an action at turn t. After taking the action, we will be at (t+1, y') and then at turn t+1 we will check again.\n\n   However, the state (t,y) must be safe at turn t, because we are there at turn t.\n\n   Then, when we generate (t+1,y'), we will check that state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, algorithm:\n\n   Let Q be a queue of (t, y, path) where path is the sequence of actions taken so far (from turn 7 to turn t-1?).\n\n   We start at (7,4) with empty path? But we haven't taken any action. Then we will take an action at turn 7.\n\n   Actually, we start at (7,4) and then we consider the actions we take at turn 7 that lead to turn 8.\n\n   We can represent: we are at state (t,y) and we have taken actions for turns 7 to t-1? Then at turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action at turn t to go to (t+1, y').\n\n   So the initial state is (7,4) and we have not taken any action at turn 7 yet.\n\n   We then generate three actions at turn 7: U, D, S.\n\n   Then we get states (8,5), (8,3), (8,4).\n\n   But we must check the state (7,4): is it safe? Yes, as computed.\n\n   Then we check the next state? But the next state is at turn 8: so we check (8, y') only when we get there? Actually, when we are at (8, y'), we are at turn 8 and we must check if at turn 8, if y' is in [1,8], then we must check the unsafe set for freeway y' at turn 8.\n\n   So we check the current state (t,y) when we are about to leave it? Actually, we check the state at the moment we are in it.\n\n   Therefore, when we are at (t,y) we have already been verified to be safe at turn t? Actually, we should check when we pop the state? \n\n   Alternatively, when we generate a state (t,y) (from the previous state by an action) then we must check if it is safe (if y in [1,8] then t must not be in unsafe[y]). If not, we discard.\n\n   Then, from (t,y) we generate next states (t+1, y') for the three actions, and then we check (t+1,y') when we generate it.\n\n   But note: the start state (7,4) we must check? Yes.\n\n   We do:\n\n        Start: (7,4) -> check: freeway 4, unsafe set for 4: {8,11}. Since 7 is not in there, safe.\n\n        Then we push (8,5) with action U, (8,3) with D, (8,4) with S.\n\n        Now, when we generate (8,5): we must check: at turn 8, freeway 5? unsafe set for freeway 5: {11,12}. 8 is not in there -> safe.\n        Similarly, (8,3): freeway 3: unsafe set {8,11} -> turn 8 is in there -> unsafe! So we discard (8,3).\n        (8,4): freeway 4: unsafe set {8,11} -> turn 8 is in there -> unsafe! discard.\n\n        So from (7,4) we only have (8,5) by action U.\n\n        Then from (8,5): we can do U, D, S -> (9,6), (9,4), (9,5).\n\n        Check (9,6): freeway 6: unsafe set {11,12} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n        (9,4): freeway 4: unsafe at {8,11} -> 9 not in -> safe? but wait: at turn 9, freeway 4 is safe? because 9 is not 8 or 11 -> safe.\n        (9,5): freeway 5: unsafe at {11,12} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n\n        So we push (9,6) with action U from (8,5)\n             (9,4) with action D from (8,5) -> but wait: from (8,5) down: 5-1=4 -> (9,4)\n             (9,5) with action S.\n\n        Then we continue.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at any turn. The minimal turn might be?\n\nWithout obstacles, we can go up 5 times: \n   turn7:4 -> turn8:5 (U) -> turn9:6 (U) -> turn10:7 (U) -> turn11:8 (U) -> turn12:9 (U) -> at turn12 we are at 9.\n\nBut at turn12, we are at y=9 -> goal. And we have taken 5 actions: from turn7 to turn11.\n\nBut we must check the safety at each turn from 7 to 11.\n\nAt turn7: (7,4) -> safe.\nturn8: (8,5) -> safe (as above).\nturn9: (9,6) -> safe.\nturn10: (10,7) -> freeway7: unsafe set {12,13,14}. Turn10 is not in -> safe.\nturn11: (11,8) -> freeway8: unsafe set {12,13,14} -> 11 not in -> safe.\n\nThen at turn12: we are at 9 -> safe and goal.\n\nSo is this path valid? \n\nActions: \n   turn7: U -> to 5\n   turn8: U -> to 6\n   turn9: U -> to 7\n   turn10: U -> to 8\n   turn11: U -> to 9\n\nBut wait: after the last action (at turn11) we get to turn12 at 9. So we have taken 5 actions: at turns 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut we must check the state at turn11: we are at (11,8). Is that safe? freeway8: unsafe at {12,13,14} -> 11 not in -> safe.\n\nSo yes, 5 moves.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We start at 4, and we need to get to 9: at least 5 moves (because 9-4=5). So 5 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we go down? we saw that at turn8 we cannot be at 3 or 4, but we can be at 5. Then we go up. But we can also go down at some point? but that would take more moves. So 5 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check: if we try to go faster? we can only move one step per turn. So 5 moves is minimal.\n\nBut what about the unsafe conditions? In the path above, we avoided the unsafe turns.\n\nBut note: at turn11 we are at 8, and then we go to 9 at turn12. But what if we get to 9 earlier? We cannot because we need 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we could have a path that goes to 5 at turn8, then at turn9 we go to 6, then at turn10 we go to 7, then at turn11 we go to 8, then at turn12 we go to 9. That's 5 moves.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\n   turn7: U -> 5 (turn8)\n   turn8: U -> 6 (turn9)\n   turn9: U -> 7 (turn10)\n   turn10: U -> 8 (turn11) -> at turn11 we are at 8: safe? because freeway8 unsafe set: 12,13,14 -> 11 is safe.\n   turn11: U -> 9 (turn12)\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up twice and then wait? that would take more than 5 moves.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path that gets to 9 in fewer than 5 moves? Impossible: from 4 to 9 requires 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence of 5 actions: all U.\n\nBut let me verify each step:\n\n   Turn7: at (7,4): safe (as above).\n   Action: U -> then at turn8, we are at 5.\n\n   Turn8: at (8,5): freeway5 unsafe at {11,12} -> 8 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> then at turn9, we are at 6.\n\n   Turn9: at (9,6): freeway6 unsafe at {11,12} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> then at turn10, we are at 7.\n\n   Turn10: at (10,7): freeway7 unsafe at {12,13,14} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> then at turn11, we are at 8.\n\n   Turn11: at (11,8): freeway8 unsafe at {12,13,14} -> 11 not in -> safe.\n   Action: U -> then at turn12, we are at 9.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\n   Turn 7: U\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn 10: U\n   Turn 11: U\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. Here H=5, so from turn7 to turn11.\n\nBut the answer format:\n\n   Turn t_1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t_1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n\n   So:\n\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1\", so t=0: a7, t=1: a8, ... t=4: a11.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut is there any problem? We must check if at any turn we are forced to wait? But we don't need to.\n\nBut what if we try a different path? For example, at turn8 we are at 5, and then we go down? That would lead to 4 at turn9? But at turn9, freeway4 is unsafe? freeway4 unsafe at turn9? no, only at 8 and 11. So 9 is safe. But that would take more moves: from 4 to 5 to 4 then we have to go up again. So that would be longer.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to 5 at turn8, then stay at 5 at turn9? then we are at (9,5): safe? yes. But then we have to go up 4 more moves: total 5 moves? but we are at turn9 at 5, then we need 4 more moves: so total 5 moves? same. But we started at turn7 at 4, then turn8:5, turn9:5 (if we stay), then turn10:6, turn11:7, turn12:8, turn13:9 -> that's 6 moves. Worse.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 5 moves of U.\n\nBut note: what if we go up to 5 at turn8, then at turn9 we go to 6, then at turn10 we go to 7, then at turn11 we are at 7? wait, then we are at 7 at turn11: but we need to be at 9. That would take two more moves: 7->8 at turn12, 8->9 at turn13: total 6 moves.\n\nSo the direct path is best.\n\nBut we must be cautious: at turn11, we are at 8, which is safe? Yes. Then we go to 9 at turn12.\n\nBut what if we try to go to 9 at turn11? Then we would have to be at 8 at turn10? Let me see:\n\n   To be at 9 at turn11: \n        turn11: y11=9 -> must have been at 8 at turn10 and then U at turn10.\n\n        So: \n            turn10: at 8 -> freeway8: unsafe set {12,13,14} -> turn10 is not in -> safe.\n            then at turn10: U -> then at turn11: 9.\n\n        How do we get to 8 at turn10? \n            We start at 4 at turn7.\n            We need 4 moves to go from 4 to 8: 4->5->6->7->8: 4 moves? \n            So: \n                turn7: U -> 5 (turn8)\n                turn8: U -> 6 (turn9)\n                turn9: U -> 7 (turn10) -> wait, at turn10 we are at 7? then we need to go to 8 at turn10: so at turn10 we are at 7 and then we do U to get to 8 at turn11? but then we are at 8 at turn11, then we do U at turn11 to get to 9 at turn12.\n\n        How to be at 8 at turn10? \n            We must have been at 7 at turn9 and then U at turn9 -> then at turn10:8.\n\n        Then at turn10: we are at 8: safe (turn10 not in unsafe[8]? unsafe[8] is {12,13,14} -> safe).\n        Then at turn10: we can do U to go to 9 at turn11? But wait: if we are at 8 at turn10, and we do U at turn10, then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\n        So the path:\n            turn7: U -> 5 at turn8\n            turn8: U -> 6 at turn9\n            turn9: U -> 7 at turn10? -> no: \n                Actually: \n                    turn7: at 4 -> U -> at turn8:5\n                    turn8: at 5 -> U -> at turn9:6\n                    turn9: at 6 -> U -> at turn10:7\n                    turn10: at 7 -> U -> at turn11:8 -> then at turn11 we are at 8, not 9.\n\n        To get to 9 at turn11, we must be at 8 at turn10 and then U at turn10 -> then at turn11:9.\n\n        So we need to be at 8 at turn10. How?\n            We start at 4 at turn7. We need 4 moves: 4->5->6->7->8: \n                turn7: U -> 5 (turn8)\n                turn8: U -> 6 (turn9)\n                turn9: U -> 7 (turn10) -> wait, that only gets to 7 at turn10.\n\n        How to get to 8 at turn10? \n            We must do 4 moves in 3 steps? Impossible.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot reach 9 at turn11. The earliest is turn12.\n\n        So H=5 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 5 moves without going through any unsafe turn? We did.\n\nBut what if we try to avoid freeway 8 at turn11? But freeway8 is safe at turn11. So no problem.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to 9 earlier? We cannot.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if we take a different route? For example, go to 5 at turn8, then go to 6 at turn9, then go to 7 at turn10, then at turn10 we are at 7: safe. Then we could go up to 8 at turn11: safe, then to 9 at turn12: same as above.\n\nOr we could go from 7 to 8 at turn10? Then we are at 8 at turn11? But then we still need to go to 9 at turn12.\n\nOr we could go from 7 to 8 at turn10: \n   turn10: at 7 -> U -> at turn11:8 -> safe? \n   then turn11: U -> at turn12:9.\n\nSame.\n\nWhat if we go down at some point? For example, at turn8 we are at 5, then at turn9 we go down to 4: but that is safe at turn9? freeway4 unsafe at {8,11}: 9 is safe. But then we are at 4 at turn9, and we need to go to 9: that requires 5 more moves? total 5 moves? but we have already used 2 moves: 7->8->9 (but we are at 4 at turn9). Then we need 5 moves: 4->5->6->7->8->9: that would be 5 moves from turn9 to turn14? total 7 moves. Worse.\n\nSo the direct path is best.\n\nTherefore, the answer is five consecutive U moves.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the optimal sequence of actions consists of moving upward (U) for five consecutive turns. This path ensures the player avoids all unsafe freeway conditions at each turn, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 7 (current turn)**: Player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). The unsafe turns for freeway 4 are \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 11\\). Since \\(t = 7\\) is safe, the action U moves the player to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 8.\n- **Turn 8**: Player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). The unsafe turns for freeway 5 are \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\). Since \\(t = 8\\) is safe, the action U moves the player to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9**: Player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). The unsafe turns for freeway 6 are \\(t = 11\\) and \\(t = 12\\). Since \\(t = 9\\) is safe, the action U moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: Player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). The unsafe turns for freeway 7 are \\(t = 12\\), \\(t = 13\\), and \\(t = 14\\). Since \\(t = 10\\) is safe, the action U moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). The unsafe turns for freeway 8 are \\(t = 12\\), \\(t = 13\\), and \\(t = 14\\). Since \\(t = 11\\) is safe, the action U moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is the goal and not a freeway, so no collision check is needed. The total number of turns \\(H = 5\\) is minimal, as moving from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 5 upward moves.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n The grid has y from 0 to 9. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The player's vertical position updates as:\n   y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if U), -1 (if D), or same (if S), and it is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\n The cars are on freeways 1 to 8 (each row). For a car, at turn t1 (current turn) we are given its head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\n Important: The car movement is continuous. For a left-moving car (which we don't have in this problem, all are right-moving), the car moves to the left. But note: all cars in the given state are right-moving. So for a right-moving car:\n   At turn T, the car's span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [since at t1: span is [τ, h] and it moves right]\n\n However, note the representation in the table:\n   For freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3) -> but note: in a right-moving car, the head should be the larger coordinate? \n   But the table says: head = -39, tail = -50? That would imply that the head is at -39 and tail at -50, meaning the car is from -50 to -39? But that is 12 units long? Actually, the car length is |h - τ| + 1? But note the representation: \n      \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n   Let me clarify: for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost point) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So if the car is moving right, then at time t1, the car occupies [τ, h] and as time passes, both head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\n   But in the given data for freeway 1: head=-39, tail=-50. Since -39 > -50, so the car is from -50 to -39? That makes sense because -50 is the leftmost (tail) and -39 is the rightmost (head). So the car is 12 units long? (because (-39) - (-50) = 11, so 12 units? Actually, the number of integers from -50 to -39 inclusive is 12.\n\n   Similarly, for freeway 2: \n        (48,37,right,12): head=48, tail=37 -> so the car is from 37 to 48 (12 units: 48-37+1=12) and moves right.\n        (-36,-47,right,12): head=-36, tail=-47 -> from -47 to -36 (12 units) and moves right.\n        (0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11 -> from -11 to 0 (12 units) and moves right.\n\n   And same for freeways 3 and 4.\n\n   For freeway 5 and 6: (-18,-29,right,6) -> head=-18, tail=-29: so from -29 to -18 (12 units) and moves right at speed 6.\n\n   For freeway 7 and 8: (-16,-27,right,4) -> head=-16, tail=-27: from -27 to -16 (12 units) and moves right at speed 4.\n\n The collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n Note: The player is at x=0 always? The problem says the position is (0, y_t). So the player is always at x=0? Then we only care about the cars that at turn T have their span covering 0.\n\n Also note: if the player moves from freeway k to freeway k' at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on freeway k. And at turn T+1, the player will be on freeway k'. So at turn T, we only check the freeway k (the current one) for collision.\n\n How to simulate:\n\n We are at turn t1=8, at position (0,5). We are going to simulate for future turns.\n\n We are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and a sequence of actions (starting from turn t1) such that after H-1 actions (so at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\n Since we start at y=5 and we need to get to y=9, we must move up at least 4 times. But we might have to wait (S) or even move down to avoid collisions? But note: we are at freeway 5 initially.\n\n The cars move at every turn. We have to avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway k that covers x=0 at that exact turn T.\n\n We are going to simulate the car positions at any future turn T (relative to t1=8). Let dt = T - t1 = T - 8.\n\n For a car on freeway k with (h, τ, d, s) at t1=8, then at turn T=8+dt:\n   Since it's right-moving: \n        head(T) = h + s * dt\n        tail(T) = τ + s * dt\n\n   And the span at T is [tail(T), head(T)] (if head(T) >= tail(T)).\n\n The player's path: we start at y0 = 5 (at turn t1=8). Then we choose actions: U, D, S.\n\n We want the minimal H. So we can try to go up as fast as possible? But we must avoid collisions.\n\n Since the goal is above, we should prefer moving up. But if we are going to be hit by a car on a freeway we are about to step on, we might need to wait or even move down to let the car pass.\n\n However, note that we can only be on one freeway per turn. So we need to check for each turn T (starting from T=8) the freeway we are on (y_T) and whether there is a car on that freeway at turn T that covers x=0.\n\n Steps:\n\n We are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but since all actions cost 1, BFS by time) on the state (turn_offset, y) where turn_offset = t - t1 (so starting at 0) and y in [0,9]. We want to reach y=9 with minimal turn_offset (so H = turn_offset+1? because we start at offset0 and we have H-1 actions? Actually, after H-1 actions, we have H turns: from t1 to t1+H-1. But note: we start at t1 (offset0) and then we take H-1 actions to get to t1+H-1. So the total turns we are in is H (from t1 to t1+H-1, inclusive? Actually, the number of turns is H: we are at t1, then t1+1, ... t1+H-1. So the time we simulate is from dt=0 to dt=H-1?).\n\n Actually, at the start (turn_offset=0) we are at turn t1=8. Then after one action we are at turn_offset=1 (turn 9). So we want to reach y=9 at some turn_offset = dt (which we denote as step dt).\n\n The state: (dt, y) meaning that at turn t1+dt, we are at y.\n\n We start at (0,5). We want to reach any (dt,9).\n\n We can model the state (y, t) where t is the absolute turn? But since t1=8, and we are only concerned with the future, we can let t start at 8. But the cars' positions depend on the absolute turn (because dt = t - 8).\n\n How to check collision at state (dt, y): \n   If y is 0 or 9, then note: there are no freeways at y=0 and y=9? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe? But the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". So if we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? Then we are safe.\n\n   But note: the player update: we are at (0,y). If y is 0 or 9, we are not on any freeway? So no collision. So only when y is between 1 and 8 (inclusive) we have to check.\n\n   For a given (dt, y) with y in [1,8], we must check every car on freeway y (at turn t1+dt) to see if 0 is in [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] for that car? But note: there can be multiple cars on the same freeway. We only need one car that covers 0 to cause a collision.\n\n   However, note the car state: for freeway y, we have a list of cars. We must check each car on that freeway at that turn.\n\n   Important: the car data given is for the current turn (t1=8). So for freeway y, we have the list of cars that are present at t1=8. And they move continuously.\n\n   But note: the car state for freeway 1 has one car, freeways 2,3,4 have three cars each, freeways 5,6,7,8 have one car? Actually, freeway 5 and 6 have one car each? But the table says:\n\n        Freeway 1: one car\n        Freeway 2: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n        Freeway 3: same as freeway2?\n        Freeway 4: same as freeway2?\n        Freeway 5: one car: (-18,-29,right,6)\n        Freeway 6: one car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> same as freeway5?\n        Freeway 7: one car: (-16,-27,right,4)\n        Freeway 8: one car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> same as freeway7?\n\n   So we have:\n\n        k=1: [ (-39, -50, right, 3) ]\n        k=2: [ (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) ]\n        k=3: same as k=2\n        k=4: same as k=2\n        k=5: [ (-18,-29,right,6) ]\n        k=6: [ (-18,-29,right,6) ]   -> same as k=5\n        k=7: [ (-16,-27,right,4) ]\n        k=8: [ (-16,-27,right,4) ]   -> same as k=7\n\n   So we can precompute for each freeway k and for a given dt (relative to t1=8), the set of cars that are on that freeway at that dt, and check if any car's span covers 0.\n\n   For a car (h, τ, d, s) on freeway k, at dt:\n        head = h + s * dt\n        tail = τ + s * dt\n\n        and we require: tail <= 0 <= head? But note: for a right-moving car, we have tail <= head? Actually, since at t1 we have τ <= h? Then at future time, tail(dt) = τ + s*dt, head(dt)=h+s*dt, and τ<=h implies tail(dt)<=head(dt). So the condition is: tail(dt) <= 0 <= head(dt).\n\n   However, note: the car spans are continuous? But the grid is discrete? Actually, the problem says: \"car span\" and we are at integer x=0. So we require that 0 is in the interval [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]? And since the car is 12 units long? But note: the interval [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt] is a continuous interval? However, the problem states the car update as the entire span moving. And collision occurs if 0 is in the span. Since the player is at a single point (0, y), we require that 0 is in the continuous interval? But note: the problem says \"0 in Span(T)\".\n\n   But the span is defined as [a, b] meaning the set of real numbers from a to b? Or integers? The head and tail are integers? The problem uses integers for head and tail. And the movement: s*(T-t1) is integer? Because s and (T-t1) are integers. So the span at T is an interval of integers? Actually, the problem says: the car span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving? But that would be integers. So we are safe to consider the interval as integers? Then the condition is:\n\n        tail(dt) <= 0 <= head(dt)   (with integers, so inclusive)\n\n   However, note the representation for right-moving: \n        at t1: [τ, h] -> at T: [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]\n\n   So condition: τ+s*dt <= 0 <= h+s*dt.\n\n   But note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt]. Then condition: h-s*dt >= 0 and τ-s*dt <= 0? Actually, for left-moving the head is the leftmost? Then the condition would be: the span [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt] and we require h-s*dt <= 0 <= τ-s*dt? But the problem doesn't specify the meaning of head and tail for left-moving. However, in this problem, all cars are right-moving.\n\n   So we only consider right-moving: condition: τ + s*dt <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*dt? Actually, the condition is: τ+s*dt <= 0 <= h+s*dt? \n\n   Example: freeway2 at t1: one car is (0, -11, right, 12). Then at dt=0: τ=-11, h=0 -> so -11<=0<=0 -> true? So at dt=0, the car covers 0? But note: at turn t1=8, we are at freeway5, so we don't check freeway2? However, if we were at freeway2 at turn t1, we would collide? But we are at freeway5 at turn t1.\n\n   So for freeway2 at dt=0: \n        car1: (48,37,right,12): [37+0,48+0] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\n        car2: (-36,-47,right,12): [-47, -36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n        car3: (0,-11,right,12): [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n   So if we are on freeway2 at turn t1=8, we would collide? But we are not.\n\n   Now, what about at future dt? We must avoid being on freeway2 at any turn when the car (0,-11,right,12) is covering 0? But note: this car moves at 12 per turn? So at dt=1: \n        tail = -11 + 12*1 = 1, head = 0 + 12*1 = 12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        at dt=0: it was [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n        at dt=1: [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n   But wait: at dt=0: we are at turn t1=8, and the car is at [-11,0]. Then at dt=1 (turn 9): the car moves to [1,12]. So if we are on freeway2 at turn 8 (dt=0) we collide? at turn 9 (dt=1) we are safe? \n\n   However, note: we are at freeway5 at turn8. So we don't care about freeway2 at turn8.\n\n   How about freeway2 at turn9 (dt=1): \n        car1: [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        car2: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+12,0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n   So freeway2 is safe at dt=1? \n\n   But what about at dt=0? It's unsafe? So if we ever step on freeway2 at dt=0, we crash. But we don't at our start.\n\n   Similarly, let's check freeway5 at dt=0: \n        We have one car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> at dt=0: [-29, -18] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\n   How about freeway5 at dt=1: \n        tail = -29+6*1 = -23, head = -18+6*1 = -12 -> [-23,-12] -> doesn't cover 0 -> safe.\n\n   freeway5 at dt=2: [-17, -6] -> safe.\n   freeway5 at dt=3: [-11,0] -> now -11<=0<=0 -> covers 0 -> unsafe at dt=3.\n\n   So if we are on freeway5 at turn t1+3 (turn 11) we crash.\n\n   Similarly, freeway6: same car? so same as freeway5? at dt=3: unsafe.\n\n   freeway7: car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> at dt=0: [-27,-16] -> safe.\n        dt=1: [-23, -12] -> safe.\n        dt=2: [-19, -8] -> safe.\n        dt=3: [-15, -4] -> safe.\n        dt=4: [-11, 0] -> unsafe? because -11<=0<=0 -> true? unsafe at dt=4.\n        dt=5: [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe? because -7<=0<=4 -> true? \n        Actually, at dt=4: [ -27+4*4 = -27+16 = -11, -16+16=0] -> so [ -11, 0] -> covers 0 -> unsafe.\n        at dt=5: [ -27+20 = -7, -16+20=4] -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in there? yes -> unsafe.\n\n        When does it become safe? \n        The car moves at 4 per turn. The car is 12 units long? So it will cover 0 until the entire car passes 0? \n        The car covers 0 from the moment its head is >=0 and tail is <=0? \n        Actually, the car will cover 0 from the time when the tail <=0 and head>=0. \n\n        The tail at dt: -27+4*dt <=0 -> 4*dt<=27 -> dt<=6.75 -> so until dt=6? \n        At dt=6: tail = -27+24 = -3, head = -16+24=8 -> [ -3,8] -> still covers 0? \n        At dt=7: tail = -27+28=1, head= -16+28=12 -> [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        So freeway7: unsafe at dt=4,5,6? safe at dt=0,1,2,3,7,8,...\n\n   Similarly, freeway8: same car? so same as freeway7? unsafe at dt=4,5,6.\n\n   Now, let's check freeway1: \n        car: (-39,-50,right,3) \n        at dt=0: [-50,-39] -> safe.\n        dt=1: [-47,-36] -> safe.\n        ...\n        until when? \n        We require: -50+3*dt <=0 and 0<= -39+3*dt? \n        The head must be >=0: -39+3*dt>=0 -> 3*dt>=39 -> dt>=13.\n        The tail must be <=0: -50+3*dt<=0 -> 3*dt<=50 -> dt<=16.66 -> so from dt=13 to dt=16.\n\n        At dt=13: tail=-50+39=-11, head=-39+39=0 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe? because 0 is included? \n        At dt=14: [-50+42=-8, -39+42=3] -> unsafe? 0 in [-8,3] -> yes.\n        At dt=15: [-50+45=-5, -39+45=6] -> unsafe.\n        At dt=16: [-50+48=-2, -39+48=9] -> unsafe? 0 in [-2,9] -> yes.\n        At dt=17: [-50+51=1, -39+51=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway1: unsafe for dt in [13,16].\n\n   Freeway2,3,4: \n        We have three cars. But note: the first car (48,37,right,12) at dt=0: [37,48] -> safe? because 0 not in [37,48]. \n        The second car: (-36,-47,right,12): at dt=0: [-47,-36] -> safe.\n        The third car: (0,-11,right,12): at dt=0: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        So at dt=0: freeway2,3,4 are unsafe? because of the third car.\n\n        At dt=1: \n            car1: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe.\n            car2: [-47+12=-35, -36+12=-24] -> safe.\n            car3: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway2,3,4 are safe at dt>=1? \n\n        But wait, what about later? \n        The first car: it starts at [37,48] and moves right -> it will never cover 0? \n        The second car: starts at [-47,-36] and moves right: it will cover 0 when? \n            tail<=0 and head>=0: \n            -47+12*dt <=0 -> 12*dt<=47 -> dt<=3.9 -> so dt<=3? \n            and head: -36+12*dt>=0 -> 12*dt>=36 -> dt>=3.\n            So at dt=3: \n                tail = -47+36 = -11, head = -36+36=0 -> unsafe? [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n            dt=4: tail=-47+48=1, head=-36+48=12 -> safe.\n\n        So the second car is unsafe at dt=3? \n\n        Similarly, the third car: we saw at dt=0 unsafe, at dt=1 safe? and then at dt=2: \n            car3: [-11+24=13, 0+24=24] -> safe? \n            so only dt=0 and then the second car at dt=3? \n\n        Therefore, freeway2,3,4 are unsafe at dt=0 and dt=3? \n\n        Actually, at dt=0: unsafe (because of car3) and at dt=3: unsafe (because of car2). \n\n        Also note: the first car never covers 0? \n\n        So freeway2,3,4: unsafe at dt=0 and dt=3? safe at other times.\n\n   Now, we are at (dt=0, y=5). We can take actions: U, D, S.\n\n   We want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\n   The minimal number of moves: if we go up 4 times, we can get to y=9 in 4 moves? But we have to check the path.\n\n   Let's try:\n\n        dt=0 (turn8): we are at y=5 -> safe (freeway5: safe at dt=0).\n        Then we choose an action at turn8: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\n   If we choose U at dt=0 (turn8): then at dt=1 (turn9) we are at y=6.\n\n        Check freeway6 at dt=1: \n            freeway6 has the same car as freeway5? \n            car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> at dt=1: [-29+6= -23, -18+6=-12] -> safe.\n\n        Then we choose U again: at dt=2 (turn10) we are at y=7.\n\n        Check freeway7 at dt=2: \n            freeway7: car (-16,-27,right,4) -> at dt=2: [-27+8=-19, -16+8=-8] -> safe.\n\n        Then U: at dt=3 (turn11) we are at y=8.\n\n        Check freeway8 at dt=3: \n            freeway8: same car? at dt=3: [-27+12=-15, -16+12=-4] -> safe? \n\n        Then U: at dt=4 (turn12) we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\n        But wait, at dt=4 we are at y=9 -> safe (no freeway at y=9).\n\n        So the sequence: \n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Then at Turn12 we are at y=9? But we took 4 actions (from turn8 to turn11) and we are at turn12? \n\n        Actually, after 4 actions: \n            t0: turn8 -> y5\n            action0 (at turn8): U -> turn9: y6\n            action1 (at turn9): U -> turn10: y7\n            action2 (at turn10): U -> turn11: y8\n            action3 (at turn11): U -> turn12: y9\n\n        So we need 4 actions? H=4? and we are at (0,9) at turn12 (which is t1+4).\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\n        H is the number of turns? Actually, the sequence of actions has H actions? and we take the actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at the goal? \n\n        The problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions ... {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we start at t1 and take H actions, so we end at turn t1+H? and we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have that after these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n        How? \n            At turn t1: we are at (0,y0). We take action a_{t1} (which is the first action) and then at the next turn (t1+1) we are at y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n            Then at turn t1+1 we take action a_{t1+1} and at turn t1+2 we are at y2, etc.\n            So after H-1 actions, we have taken the last action at turn t1+H-2? and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at the next state? \n\n        The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n            t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{t1}\n            t=1: a_{t1+1}\n            ...\n            t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}  -> so the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H? \n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        Actually, the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\n        Let me reread: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n        And the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n        So: we start at turn t1 (which is turn8) and we have an action for turn8, then turn9, ... until turn t1+H-1. Then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9? \n\n        How the state evolves:\n            At turn t1: we are at (0, y0) = (0,5). \n            We take action a_{t1} at turn t1: then we move to y1 at turn t1+1.\n            Then we take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1: then we move to y2 at turn t1+2.\n            ...\n            We take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1: then we move to y_H at turn t1+H.\n\n        But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        That would mean that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? and then we take an action? But we don't need to? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n        So we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        How does that work? \n\n        The problem defines: \n            \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\n        So at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\n        Therefore, to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have:\n\n            y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n        We start at turn t1 (turn8) at y5.\n\n        We take H-1 actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y9? \n\n        But the problem says the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1: so the actions are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\n        Then the state at turn t1+H would be y_{t1+H} = ... \n\n        How do we have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        Actually, note: \n            At turn t1: we are at y5. \n            We take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y6 (if we choose U) ... \n            We want at turn t1+H-1 we are at y9? \n\n        This implies that we take H-1 actions? But the sequence has H actions? \n\n        There seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n        Let me read the problem: \n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n            and then we are to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\n        How many actions? H actions? Then we have H state transitions? \n\n        Then we would be at turn t1+H? \n\n        So the requirement should be: at turn t1+H we are at (0,9)? \n\n        But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \n            \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n        So the player must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        But then we are going to take an action at that turn? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning that we have achieved the goal at that turn. So we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\n        However, the sequence of actions is defined from t=0 to H-1, which corresponds to actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\n        So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we have taken H-1 actions? because the last action was taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\n        But the sequence has H actions? \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\n        But it explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n        I think we must interpret: \n            The sequence of actions is taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n            And after taking these actions, at the next turn (t1+H) we are at y_{t1+H}? \n\n        But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        How can we be at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we take the last action (the (H-1)-th action) at turn t1+H-1? and then we move to y_{t1+H}? \n\n        But we want to be at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        This implies that we don't require an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: we are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and a sequence of H actions? \n\n        But note: the minimal H might be 0? but we start at y5, so not at 9. \n\n        Alternatively, H might be the number of turns we are going to simulate? \n\n        After careful reading: \n            We start at turn t1. We are to determine a sequence of actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach (0,9) at some turn. \n\n            The minimal H is the number of turns we take? meaning the total turns from t1 to the turn we reach y9? \n\n            And the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? \n\n            Then at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action? and then at turn t1+H we are at y9? \n\n        But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n        Let me see the example: if we do nothing (S) for one action: \n            H=1: then we have one action: at turn t1 (turn8): S. \n            Then at turn t1+1 (turn9) we are still at y5? \n            So we are not at 9.\n\n        If we want to get to y9 in the minimal number of turns, we need to move up 4 times. \n\n        How many turns does that take? \n            We start at turn8: we take an action at turn8 -> then at turn9 we are at y6.\n            Then at turn9: action -> turn10: y7.\n            Then at turn10: action -> turn11: y8.\n            Then at turn11: action -> turn12: y9.\n\n        So we are at y9 at turn12. \n\n        How many actions? 4 actions: at turns8,9,10,11.\n\n        And we are at y9 at turn12. \n\n        Therefore, to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1, we would set H-1 = 4? so H=5? \n\n        Then we would be at turn8+5-1=12? \n\n        So H=5: meaning we take 5 turns? but we only take 4 actions? \n\n        The problem says: the sequence of actions has H actions? \n\n        Alternatively, the minimal H might be the number of actions? \n\n        The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", so H is the number of turns? \n\n        And the sequence of actions has H actions? \n\n        But then we are at turn t1+H after the last action? \n\n        And we require that at turn t1+H we are at (0,9)? \n\n        But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n        So I think there might be an off-by-one.\n\n        Given the confusion, let me look at the answer format: \n            Turn t1: a_{t1}\n            Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n            ...\n\n        and we are to write H actions? \n\n        But the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so H actions.\n\n        And we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        How? \n            After the first action (at t1) we are at turn t1+1 at y_{t1+1}.\n            After the last action (at t1+H-1) we are at turn t1+H at y_{t1+H}.\n\n        But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n        But then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        How can we be at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That means we were already there at the end of turn t1+H-2? \n\n        So we require that after taking H-1 actions, we are at y9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        And then we take an extra action at turn t1+H-1? which might be arbitrary? but we don't care? \n\n        But the problem says we have to write H actions. \n\n        And we are to reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        I will assume that the problem means: we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? but that action doesn't matter? \n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" meaning that we are done at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Alternatively, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\n        And we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we take the last action (the H-th action) at turn t1+H-1? and then we move to y_{t1+H}? \n\n        But we don't care about y_{t1+H}? \n\n        However, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n        So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? \n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n        We start at turn t1 (turn8) at y5. \n\n        We take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y9? \n\n        So the number of actions is H-1? but the problem says we write H actions? \n\n        This doesn't match.\n\n        Given the time, I will assume the problem means: we take H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1) and then we are at y=9 at turn t1+H? \n\n        And the problem says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is a mistake? \n\n        Or perhaps the index: the state at turn t is denoted by y_t, and the action at turn t is a_t. \n\n        Then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n        We start: \n            y_{t1} = 5.\n            a_{t1}: then y_{t1+1} = 5 + Δy_{t1}\n            ...\n            we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        This means that we have taken H-1 actions? \n\n        But the sequence of actions is from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}: which is H actions? \n\n        Then we would have computed y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy_{t1+H-1}? \n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        After re‐examining the problem statement: \n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n        This implies that after H-1 state transitions (because we take H actions, which cause H state transitions), we are at turn t1+H? \n\n        But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        This doesn't add up.\n\n        I think there is an off-by-one in the problem statement. \n\n        Given the example in the problem: \n            \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \"\n\n        So the state at time t+1 depends on the action at time t.\n\n        We start at time t1: y_{t1}=5.\n\n        We take action a_{t1} at time t1, then y_{t1+1} = 5 + Δy_{t1}.\n\n        We take action a_{t1+1} at time t1+1, then y_{t1+2} = ...\n\n        We want to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n        How many actions do we need? \n            To go from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H-1}, we have H-1 - t1 steps? no.\n\n        Actually, the number of steps (actions) is (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1.\n\n        But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\n        Therefore, I must be misinterpreting the indexing.\n\n        Let me try to count for a small example: \n            H=1: then the sequence has one action: a_{t1} (t=0 to 0). \n            Then we have: \n                at turn t1: we take a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}=5+Δy.\n            But we require y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=9? -> but we start at 5, so impossible.\n\n            H=2: two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n                at turn t1: we take a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}=5+Δy0.\n                at turn t1+1: we take a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2}=y_{t1+1}+Δy1.\n            We require y_{t1+2-1}=y_{t1+1}=9.\n\n            So after the first action, we are at y9 at turn t1+1? and then we take a second action at turn t1+1? but we are already at 9.\n\n        So to get to y9 at turn t1+1, we need to move up by 4? impossible in one action.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H for reaching y9 is: \n            to be at y9 at turn t1+4: \n                y_{t1+4}=9.\n\n            then we require: y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> so t1+H-1 = t1+4 -> H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\n        So with H=5, we have 5 actions? \n            actions at turns: t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4.\n            and then we are at turn t1+5: y_{t1+5} = ... \n            but we require y_{t1+5-1}=y_{t1+4}=9.\n\n        How do we achieve that? \n            We need to be at y9 at the beginning of turn t1+4? and then we take an action at turn t1+4? \n\n        But we are already at y9? \n\n        So the actions are for turns: t1 to t1+4, and the state at the beginning of turn t1+4 is y9.\n\n        How do we get to y9 at the beginning of turn t1+4? \n            We start at turn t1: y5.\n            We take actions at turn t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3: four actions? \n            then at turn t1+4 we are at y9.\n\n        So why do we have 5 actions? \n\n        This suggests that the problem might have a mistake.\n\n        Given the time constraints, I will output the sequence that gets to y9 at turn12 (t1+4) with 4 actions. Then we would have H=4 actions? but the problem might expect H=5.\n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are at the goal at turn12, which is 4 turns after turn8? \n\n        The number of turns from turn8 to turn12 is 5 turns? (8,9,10,11,12) -> 5 turns. \n\n        So H=5.\n\n        And we take actions at turns8,9,10,11 -> 4 actions. \n\n        But the problem requires a sequence of H=5 actions? \n\n        What is the fifth action? \n\n        We are at turn12: we are at y9. We don't need to move. But the problem says we must write 5 actions? \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Let me assume that the minimal H is the number of turns we are in the game until we are at the goal, including the start? \n            turn8: we are at y5 -> not goal.\n            turn9: y6 -> not goal.\n            turn10: y7 -> not goal.\n            turn11: y8 -> not goal.\n            turn12: y9 -> goal.\n\n        So we need 5 turns: turns 8,9,10,11,12. So H=5.\n\n        And we take actions at every turn we are not at the goal? \n\n        But at turn12, we are at goal, so we don't need to take an action? \n\n        However, the problem requires a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is 5 turns: turn8 to turn12-1= turn11? \n\n        So we take actions at turns8,9,10,11.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence has 4 actions? \n\n        But the problem says the sequence has H actions = 5 actions.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps we must include an action at the goal turn? \n\n        But that doesn't make sense.\n\n        Given the above, I think the intended meaning is: \n            H is the total number of turns that the player is involved in, from turn t1 to the turn when we first reach y9 (inclusive), and we take actions at every turn from t1 to the turn just before we reach y9? \n\n        But then the number of actions would be H-1.\n\n        The problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\n        I see now that the problem might have a off-by-one error.\n\n        To resolve, I will assume that the sequence of actions has length = the number of state transitions we need, which is 4. \n\n        And then H should be the number of turns that have passed? which is 5 turns (from turn8 to turn12).\n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\n        So they want H=5 and 5 actions.\n\n        What should the fifth action be? \n\n        At turn12, we are at y9. We can choose any action, say S, because we are at goal.\n\n        But the problem says we are to reach at turn t1+H-1 = 8+5-1 = 12. \n\n        So at turn12 we are at y9? \n\n        How do we get to y9 at turn12? \n            We start at turn8: y5.\n            action0 at turn8: U -> turn9: y6.\n            action1 at turn9: U -> turn10: y7.\n            action2 at turn10: U -> turn11: y8.\n            action3 at turn11: U -> turn12: y9.\n            action4 at turn12: we choose S (or anything) -> turn13: y9 (if we choose S) or y10 (if U) which is not allowed? but clamped to 9.\n\n        But the problem requires that at turn12 (which is t1+4) we are at y9. \n\n        However, after action3 (at turn11) we are at turn12: y9. \n\n        Then action4 at turn12: we are then at turn13: y9 or y8 or y10? \n\n        But we are required to be at y9 at turn12, not turn13.\n\n        So the fifth action is not needed.\n\n        Therefore, I think the problem means that we take actions only until the turn before we reach the goal? \n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem might have a typo, I will output the sequence of 4 actions that gets us to y9 at turn12.\n\n        But the problem asks for H=5 and 5 actions? \n\n        Let me try to see if there is a reason to wait: \n            In our earlier plan, we are safe? \n            dt=0 (turn8): y5 -> safe.\n            dt=1 (turn9): y6 -> freeway6 at dt=1: safe.\n            dt=2 (turn10): y7 -> freeway7 at dt=2: safe.\n            dt=3 (turn11): y8 -> freeway8 at dt=3: safe.\n            dt=4 (turn12): y9 -> safe.\n\n        But wait, at freeway5: at dt=3 (turn11) we are not on freeway5? we are on freeway8.\n\n        However, freeway5 at dt=3 is unsafe? but we are not on freeway5.\n\n        So the plan works.\n\n        Therefore, we can achieve in 4 actions.\n\n        But the problem might require H=5? \n\n        I will output the 4 actions and let H=4? \n\n        The problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H=4, we have actions at t=0,1,2,3: turns8,9,10,11.\n\n        Then at turn12 (which is t1+4) we are at y9.\n\n        And the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=y_{8+4-1}=y_{11}= ? \n\n        In our simulation: \n            turn8: y5\n            turn9: y6\n            turn10: y7\n            turn11: y8\n            turn12: y9\n\n        So at turn11 (t1+3) we are at y8, not 9. \n\n        Therefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to be at y9 at turn11 (t1+3).\n\n        How? \n            That means we must move up 4 times in 3 actions? \n            action0: U at turn8 -> turn9: y6\n            action1: U at turn9 -> turn10: y7\n            action2: U at turn10 -> turn11: y8 -> not 9.\n            action3: U at turn11 -> turn12: y9.\n\n        So we cannot be at y9 at turn11.\n\n        The only way to be at y9 at turn11 is if we start closer.\n\n        Therefore, we must have H>=5: \n            We want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n            t1=8 -> turn = 8+H-1 = 7+H.\n            We want to be at y9 at turn (7+H).\n\n            Minimal H: \n                if H=5: then turn = 7+5 = 12 -> so we want to be at y9 at turn12.\n                if H=4: then turn = 7+4 = 11 -> turn11.\n\n        So we need to be at y9 at turn12 if H=5.\n\n        Then the sequence of actions should be of length H=5: actions at turns8,9,10,11,12.\n\n        But at turn12, we are already at y9? so we can choose S.\n\n        So the plan with an extra S at the end:\n\n            turn8: U -> y6 at turn9\n            turn9: U -> y7 at turn10\n            turn10: U -> y8 at turn11\n            turn11: U -> y9 at turn12\n            turn12: S -> y9 at turn13\n\n        But then at turn12 we are at y9? so we have achieved the goal at turn12.\n\n        However, the action at turn12 is taken after we are already at the goal? \n\n        But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 8+5-1 = 12, we are at y9. \n\n        In this case, at the beginning of turn12, before we take any action, are we at y9? \n\n        No, at the beginning of turn12, we are at the state resulting from the action at turn11: which is y9 at turn12.\n\n        Then we take an action at turn12: which is not needed.\n\n        But the problem requires an action at turn12.\n\n        Alternatively, can we be at y9 at the beginning of turn12 without an action at turn11? \n\n        We would need to be at y8 at turn11 and then choose U at turn11 -> then at turn12 we are at y9.\n\n        So the fifth action is at turn12: but we are then at turn13? and we don't care.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 5, and the actions are U,U,U,U,S for turns8 to 12.\n\n        But note: at turn12, we are on freeway9? so no collision. \n\n        However, we must check the actions on the freeways we visit.\n\n        Let's simulate for H=5 (actions at turns8,9,10,11,12) and states at turns9,10,11,12,13.\n\n        state at turn8 (dt=0): y=5 -> safe.\n        action0 at turn8: U -> state at turn9 (dt=1): y=6 -> freeway6 at dt=1: safe.\n        action1 at turn9: U -> state at turn10 (dt=2): y=7 -> freeway7 at dt=2: safe.\n        action2 at turn10: U -> state at turn11 (dt=3): y=8 -> freeway8 at dt=3: safe.\n        action3 at turn11: U -> state at turn12 (dt=4): y=9 -> safe.\n        action4 at turn12: S -> state at turn13 (dt=5): y=9 -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can use H=5 and the sequence: U, U, U, U, S.\n\n        But is there a shorter sequence in terms of turns (H)? \n\n        The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\n        Can we be at y9 at an earlier turn? \n\n        We cannot be at y9 before turn12 because we need 4 moves.\n\n        So the minimal H is 5.\n\n        But note: we are at y9 at turn12, which is the (8+5-1=12)-th turn? \n\n        And we want to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\n        Is there a way to be at y9 at turn11 (which would require H=4 because 8+4-1=11)? \n\n        How? \n            At turn8: y5.\n            turn9: y6 (action U)\n            turn10: y7 (action U)\n            turn11: y9? -> we would need to move up by 2 in one action? not allowed.\n\n        So the earliest we can be at y9 is turn12.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 5.\n\n        But wait, what if we move up faster? no.\n\n        However, we must ensure safety. In the above plan we are safe.\n\n        But is there a problem with freeway5 at dt=3 (turn11)? \n            At turn11, we are at freeway8, not freeway5. \n            freeway5 at dt=3: car: [-29+6*3=-29+18=-11, -18+18=0] -> covers 0, so unsafe.\n            but we are not on freeway5 at turn11.\n\n        freeway6 at dt=3: same as freeway5: unsafe? but we are on freeway8 at turn11.\n\n        freeway7 at dt=4: unsafe (because at dt=4: [-27+16=-11, -16+16=0] -> covers 0) \n        freeway8 at dt=4: unsafe.\n\n        But in our plan, at dt=4 (turn12) we are at y9, so safe.\n\n        So the plan is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: S   (or we could choose anything, but S is safe)\n\n        But note: the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn8 to turn8+5-1 = turn12.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: S\n\n        However, wait: the action at turn12 is taken when we are at y9? and then we stay at y9. \n\n        But the problem only requires that we are at y9 at turn12 (which is before the action at turn12).\n\n        In our simulation, at the beginning of turn12 we are at y9 (because of the action U at turn11). \n        Then we take action S at turn12, and then at turn13 we are still at y9.\n\n        So we are at y9 at the beginning of turn12, which satisfies the condition.\n\n        Therefore, it is valid.\n\n        But is there a shorter sequence in terms of H? \n            H=5 is the minimal because we cannot be at y9 before turn12.\n\n        So we output the above.\n\n        However, let me check if we can avoid the last action? \n            The problem requires 5 actions. \n\n        But note: we could also do:\n\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U   -> but then at turn13 we would be at y10? and then clamped to 9? \n                According to the update: y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy,0),9)\n                So if we are at y9 and choose U, we are still at y9.\n\n            So it is safe.\n\n        But the problem does not require to minimize the number of actions beyond reaching the goal, so we can choose any action at the last step.\n\n        I'll choose S for simplicity.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\n        But note: the current turn is t1=8, and the actions are for turns 8 to 12.\n\n        However, the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", so we write:\n\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: S\n\n        But wait, the problem says the current turn is t1=8, and we are to start with turn8.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Let me double-check if we could have done it in H=5 but with a different sequence to avoid a collision? \n            In the above, we didn't have any collision.\n\n        But what if we are forced to wait somewhere? \n            We are not, because we moved up continuously and were safe.\n\n        However, let me check freeway8 at dt=3 (turn11): \n            freeway8: car (-16,-27,right,4) -> at dt=3: \n                tail = -27 + 4*3 = -27+12 = -15\n                head = -16+12 = -4\n            -> [-15,-4] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 5 and the sequence is as above.\n\n        But note: the problem has freeway2,3,4 unsafe at dt=0 and dt=3? \n            We never were on freeway2,3,4? we were on freeway5,6,7,8.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Final answer.\n\n        However, the initial state for freeway2,3,4 has a car covering 0 at dt=0, and also at dt=3. \n        But we are not on freeway2,3,4 at dt=0 or dt=3? \n            dt=0: we are on freeway5.\n            dt=3: we are on freeway8.\n\n        So safe.\n\n        One more thing: freeway5 at dt=3: unsafe. \n            We are at freeway5 only at dt=0 and maybe dt=1? \n            In our plan, we leave freeway5 at the first action: at turn8 we move to freeway6 at turn9 (dt=1).\n\n            At dt=1: freeway5: car -> [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n            At dt=2: freeway5: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n            At dt=3: [-11,0] -> unsafe, but we are not there.\n\n        Similarly, freeway6: \n            dt=0: we are not there (at dt=0 we are at freeway5)\n            dt=1: we are at freeway6: car at [-23,-12] -> safe.\n            dt=2: freeway6: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n            dt=3: [-11,0] -> unsafe, but at dt=3 we are at freeway8.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n        But note: the problem says the initial turn is t0=8, and we are at (0,5). \n\n        And the car state is as given.\n\n        So we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\n        However, the problem might expect without the last action? \n\n        But then we would only have 4 actions, and the problem asks for H=5 actions.\n\n        So we keep it.\n\n        If the problem means that we should have only the actions until we reach the goal, then we would output 4 actions, and H would be 4? \n\n        But then the condition y_{t1+H-1}=y_{8+3}=y_{11}=8, not 9.\n\n        Therefore, we must have H=5.\n\n        I think this is the intended answer.\n\n        Let me see if there is a sequence that gets us to y9 at turn12 with only 4 actions, and then we output 4 actions and H=4? \n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n\n        Then the sequence has 4 actions, and we are at turn12: y9.\n\n        And if the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=y_{8+4-1}=y_{11}=8, which is not 9.\n\n        So it does not satisfy.\n\n        Therefore, we must have H=5.\n\n        Final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 8 is 5.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=6. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars here are right-moving, meaning they're going from left to right on the x-axis. Since the collision depends on whether the player is on a freeway when x=0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe player position is only at x=0, so we only care about when the car spans include x=0 at the turn when the player is on that row.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U (up, +1), D (down, -1), S (stay, 0). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nAt turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, then for each car on that freeway, if 0 is in Span(T), collision occurs.\n\nBut note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}. So at turn T, you are on row y_T, and that's when you check for collision on row y_T.\n\nIf you move to a different row at turn T, you are not on that new row until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are only on y_T.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd for the move: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since at turn T, you are on y_T, you only care about cars on y_T for that turn.\n\nNow, the car spans: for right-moving cars, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] since at t_1, span is [τ, h] for right-moving, so at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nt_1 is given as 9, current turn.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 9.\n\nPlayer at (0,6)\n\nCars:\n\nFor each freeway, there might be multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-36, -47, right, 3) head -36, tail -47? That seems backward.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\n-36 and -47, with right direction. -36 is greater than -47, so head h = -36, tail τ = -47? But usually tail is behind, so for right-moving, τ should be left, h right, so if τ = -47, h = -36, that means the car is from x=-47 to x=-36, so span [ -47, -36 ] at t_1.\n\nBut in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" which would be from τ to h, so if τ = -47, h = -36, then [ -47, -36 ], which is correct, with left end -47, right end -36.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [ τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1) ] = [ -47 + 3(T-9), -36 + 3(T-9) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow freeway 2: multiple cars: (60,49, right,12), (-24,-35, right,12), (12,1, right,12)\n\n(60,49): if head 60, tail 49, but 60>49, so span [49,60]? [τ,h] with τ=49, h=60.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35): τ=-35, h=-24? [ -35, -24 ]\n\n(12,1): τ=1, h=12, [1,12]\n\nAll with speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (60,49, right,12), (-24,-35, right,12), (12,1, right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same again.\n\nFreeway 5: (-12,-23, right,6) τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23, right,4) τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=6 to y=9, so I need to move up, but avoid rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and want to go to y=9, the direct way is to go up three times: U,U,U to (0,9) in three turns.\n\nBut I need to check if at any turn, when I'm on a row, and at that turn, for that row, if a car has 0 in its span.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row, at which turns there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to find for each freeway k, when 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen, if the player is on row k at turn T, and 0 is in Span for some car on k, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t_1=9, position y=6.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is the position.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=9 onwards.\n\nLet me set t_1 = 9 as time zero for simplicity, so let τ = T - t_1 = T - 9, so at τ=0, current time.\n\nPlayer at y=6.\n\nAt time τ (relative), player position after actions.\n\nActions at τ=0,1,2,... for turns t=9,10,11,...\n\nAt time τ, the turn is t = t_1 + τ = 9 + τ.\n\nPlayer y-position at time τ: let y(τ) be position after τ actions? Let's define carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t_1, player is at (0,6).\n\nThen, at turn t_1, player chooses action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nLet me define the state at the start of each turn.\n\nAt the start of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen, player chooses action a_T, which causes y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen, during turn T, player is on row y_T, and we check collision on row y_T for turn T.\n\nThat is, for cars on freeway y_T, if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car, collision.\n\nSpan(T) depends on T.\n\nSince T = t_1 + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nWith t_1=9.\n\nSo for each freeway k, I need to find for which τ, 0 is in the span of some car on k at time T = 9 + τ.\n\nThen, if player is on row k at time τ, and for that k, at time τ, 0 is covered, then collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: at t_1, span [-47,-36], speed s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan at time T: [ -47 + 3(T-9), -36 + 3(T-9) ]\n\nSet equal to [ -47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ ] where τ = T-9.\n\n0 is in span if -47 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 3τ\n\nSo -47 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -36 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 47 => τ ≤ 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so τ <= 15\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -36 + 3τ => 36 ≤ 3τ => τ >= 12\n\nSo τ between 12 and 15 inclusive? τ >=12 and τ <=15.\n\nτ integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ >=12 and τ <=15, so τ=12,13,14,15.\n\nCheck:\n\nAt τ=12: span [-47 + 3*12, -36 + 3*12] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 <= 0.\n\nSimilarly τ=13: [-47+39, -36+39] = [-8,3], -8<=0<=3, yes.\n\nτ=14: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nτ=15: [-47+45, -36+45] = [-2,9], -2<=0<=9, yes.\n\nτ=16: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 1<=0? 0<1, not <=, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nτ=11: [-47+33, -36+33] = [-14,-3], -14<=0<=-3? 0 not <= -3, no.\n\nSo for k=1, occupied at τ=12,13,14,15.\n\nNow freeway k=2: three cars, all speed 12.\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,12) at t_1, span [49,60], since [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nAt time T, [49 + 12τ, 60 + 12τ] where τ=T-9\n\n0 in span: 49 +12τ <= 0 <= 60 +12τ\n\nBut 49+12τ >=49>0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 60+12τ always true since 60+12τ>0, but 49+12τ <=0? 49+12τ <=0 => 12τ <= -49, impossible since τ>=0. So never for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car on k=2: (-24,-35, right,12) τ=-35, h=-24? [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, [ -35 +12τ, -24 +12τ ]\n\n0 in span: -35 +12τ <= 0 <= -24 +12τ\n\nFirst: -35+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12τ => 24 <=12τ => τ >= 24/12 =2\n\nSo τ >=2 and τ <=2, so τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2: span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not <=12? 0<1, not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2.\n\nThird car on k=2: (12,1, right,12) [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 +12τ, 12 +12τ]\n\n0 in span: 1+12τ <=0 <=12+12τ\n\n1+12τ <=0 => 12τ <= -1, impossible. So never.\n\nThus for freeway 2, only the second car covers x=0 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, since freeway 3 is same as 2, and freeway 4 same, so for each of k=2,3,4, occupied at τ=2 only.\n\nk=2 has cars, and at τ=2, for k=2, one car has span [-11,0], so yes.\n\nSimilarly for k=3 and k=4, identical, so each has occupied at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway k=5: one car (-12,-23, right,6) [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T, [ -23 +6τ, -12 +6τ ]\n\n0 in span: -23 +6τ <= 0 <= -12 +6τ\n\nFirst: -23+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=23 => τ <= 23/6 ≈3.833, τ<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6τ => 12 <=6τ => τ >=2\n\nSo τ=2,3\n\nAt τ=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=1: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not\n\nτ=4: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not\n\nSo for k=5, occupied at τ=2 and τ=3\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=6: same as k=5, so occupied at τ=2,3\n\nNow freeway k=7: car (-12,-23, right,4) [τ,h] = [-23,-12], speed 4\n\nAt T, [ -23 +4τ, -12 +4τ ]\n\n0 in span: -23 +4τ <=0 <= -12 +4τ\n\nFirst: -23+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=23 => τ <= 23/4 = 5.75, τ<=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +4τ => 12 <=4τ => τ >=3\n\nSo τ >=3 and τ <=5, so τ=3,4,5\n\nAt τ=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nτ=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], yes\n\nτ=2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], no\n\nτ=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], no\n\nSo k=7 occupied τ=3,4,5\n\nSimilarly, k=8: same as k=7, occupied τ=3,4,5\n\nNow summarize for each row, the τ when it is dangerous, i.e., covered at x=0.\n\nk=1: τ=12,13,14,15\n\nk=2: τ=2\n\nk=3: τ=2\n\nk=4: τ=2\n\nk=5: τ=2,3\n\nk=6: τ=2,3\n\nk=7: τ=3,4,5\n\nk=8: τ=3,4,5\n\nk=1 is freeway 1, y=1.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9. Freeways are y=1 to 8, meaning cars are only on those rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nPlayer at τ=0, position y=6.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 6 to 9, difference 3, so at least 3 actions if I go up each time.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a row when it is dangerous for that τ.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am on y=6.\n\nWhat about y=6 at τ=0?\n\ny=6 is freeway, and dangerous when τ=2 or 3.\n\nAt τ=0, τ=0 not in {2,3}, so for k=6, dangerous at τ=2,3, not at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, I need to check for each position and time.\n\nSince the dangerous times are for specific τ, I can plan the path.\n\nI want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nDirect path: U,U,U to y=9 in three actions: from τ=0 to τ=3.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t=9), position y=6. Action a_{t_1} = a_9.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} determined.\n\nLet me define the state at start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn T=9+τ, position y_τ.\n\nThen choose action a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1} for next turn.\n\nThen during turn, on row y_τ, check collision.\n\nFor direct path:\n\nAt τ=0, y=6. Action: U, then y=7 for next turn.\n\nBut at this turn, τ=0, position y=6.\n\nIs y=6 dangerous at τ=0? From above, k=6 dangerous at τ=2,3, τ=0 not, so safe.\n\nThen action U, so at next turn τ=1, position y=7.\n\nNow at τ=1, y=7. Is y=7 dangerous at τ=1?\n\nk=7 dangerous at τ=3,4,5. τ=1 not in, so safe.\n\nThen action U, so y=8 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=8. Is y=8 dangerous at τ=2?\n\nk=8 dangerous at τ=3,4,5. τ=2 not in, so safe? τ=2 for k=8.\n\nk=8 occupied at τ=3,4,5, not τ=2, so at τ=2, not dangerous.\n\nThen action U, to y=9 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, position y=9? At start of turn τ=3, position y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=2, position y=8 (after previous action).\n\nThen at turn τ=2, position y=8, action U, so y_{τ=3} =9.\n\nThen at turn τ=3, position is y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check, or always safe.\n\nBut during turn τ=2, we are on y=8, which is safe at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=3, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with three actions: U at τ=0, U at τ=1, U at τ=2, reaching y=9 at τ=3.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt τ=2, when on y=8, safe, but I need to check if at that time, for the row I'm on.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At τ=0 (t=9): position y=6, action U. On row 6 at τ=0, safe.\n\n- At τ=1 (t=10): position y=7 (since previous action U), action U. On row 7 at τ=1. k=7 dangerous at τ=3,4,5, τ=1 not, safe.\n\n- At τ=2 (t=11): position y=8, action U. On row 8 at τ=2. k=8 dangerous at τ=3,4,5, τ=2 not, safe.\n\n- Then at τ=3 (t=12): position y=9, and we stop? The player reaches (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAfter H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so after H-1 steps? I need to define H.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the turn indices.\n\nStart at turn t_1=9, position y_{t_1} = y_9 =6.\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have H actions, and y_{t_1 + H} should be 9.\n\nThen the last position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H, we don't take action, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we need to ensure that during each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, no collision when on freeway.\n\nIn this case, with three actions: actions at t=9,10,11: U,U,U.\n\nThen at turn t=12, position y=9.\n\nNow, during:\n\n- Turn t=9 (τ=0): on y=6, safe\n\n- Turn t=10 (τ=1): on y=7, safe\n\n- Turn t=11 (τ=2): on y=8, safe\n\n- Then turn t=12: on y=9, no issue.\n\nSo H=3, sequence: U,U,U for t=9,10,11.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at τ=2? τ=2, t=11.\n\nk=8 dangerous at τ=3,4,5, which are t=12,13,14.\n\nτ=2 is t=11, so yes safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the car states, for example, at τ=2, for row 2,3,4, it is dangerous, but I am not on row 2,3,4 at that time.\n\nI am on row 6,7,8 at τ=0,1,2 respectively.\n\nAll safe at those times.\n\nBut let me confirm row 6 at τ=0: k=6 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=0.\n\nRow 7 at τ=1: k=7 dangerous at τ=3,4,5, not τ=1.\n\nRow 8 at τ=2: k=8 dangerous at τ=3,4,5, not τ=2.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in fewer? But from 6 to 9, minimum 3 actions, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\nS could keep same, but to go up, need U actions.\n\nSo minimum H=3 is possible.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot? For example, if at some point it was dangerous, but here it seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if y=9 is reached earlier, but no, with U,U,U, it takes three actions.\n\nMaybe I can go faster, but no, since max up per turn.\n\nUnless I start from different, but I start at 6.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=2, row 8 is safe, but what about later turns, but I don't care after reaching.\n\nIn this path, I never go to lower rows, so no issue with other dangerous times.\n\nBut let me list all dangerous times to see.\n\nFor row 1: dangerous τ=12,13,14,15\n\nBut I am not going there.\n\nRow 2,3,4: dangerous only at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, if I were on row 2,3, or 4, it would be dangerous, but in my path, at τ=2, I am on row 8, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 and 6 dangerous at τ=2,3: at τ=2, row 5 and 6 dangerous, but I am on row 8 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=3, row 5,6,7 dangerous? Row 5 and 6 dangerous at τ=3, row 7 at τ=3,4,5.\n\nBut at τ=3, in my path, I am on row 9, not on freeway.\n\nIn the action sequence, after three actions, at τ=3, position y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nPerhaps I can consider staying or down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo H=3 should work.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with three actions, I do.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on row 6 at τ=0.\n\nRow 6: freeway 6, cars: same as 5, dangerous at τ=2 and 3.\n\nAt τ=0, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at τ=1: dangerous at τ=3,4,5, not τ=1.\n\nτ=1 for row 7: k=7, dangerous τ=3,4,5, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car list, for row 6, it has car with speed 6, same as row 5.\n\nBut at τ=0, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should compute the span at t=9 for row 6.\n\nAt t=9, τ=0, for row 6, car: (-12,-23, right,6) but at t=9, span is [-23,-12], so x=0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly for row 7 at t=10, τ=1: row 7 car at t=10, T=10, τ=1, span [-23 +4*1, -12 +4*1] = [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nRow 8 at t=11, τ=2: span for row 8, same as row 7 but speed 4, τ=2, [-23 +4*2, -12 +4*2] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the goal is y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the format: for turn t_1=9, actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem with row 8 or something.\n\nPerhaps at τ=3, if I were on row 8, it would be dangerous, but I move to row 9 at τ=2 action, so at τ=3 I am on row 9.\n\nAnother thing: the car on row 2,3,4 at τ=2 is dangerous, but I am not there.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait, but no need.\n\nMaybe I can go directly to 9 in two turns? But impossible, since from 6, even with U,U, I go to 7 then 8, need third to 9.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2,3,4, at τ=2, covered, but since I am not on those rows, ok.\n\nBut let me check freeway 2 at τ=2: for example, the car (-24,-35, right,12), at τ=2, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so x=0 covered, so if on row 2 at τ=2, collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in my path, at τ=2, I am on row 8, not row 2.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother point: the player starts at (0,6) at turn t_1=9, which is τ=0.\n\nPosition y=6.\n\nNow, if I do nothing, stay, but then I need to go up later, more turns.\n\nOr if I go down, worse.\n\nSo U,U,U should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=3, actions U for t=9,10,11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=3.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=9, position is given, and after actions.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=9, H=3, so actions at t=9,10,11.\n\nEach U.\n\nThen position at t=12 is (0,9).\n\nNow, during turns 9,10,11, all safe.\n\nBut is there any car that might affect? For example, at τ=0 on row 6, safe.\n\nBut row 6 has cars, but at t=9, not covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should compute for row 6 at t=9.\n\nRow 6: car (-12,-23, right,6), at t=9, span [-23,-12], so x=0 not in, since -23 to -12, min x=-23, max x=-12, both negative, so x=0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the freeway list, for row 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but I already considered.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 1, dangerous at τ=12-15, but I finish at τ=3, so no issue.\n\nSo I think H=3 with U,U,U is possible.\n\nBut the player is at y=6, and I go to y=7,8,9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no car.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in less, but no.\n\nMaybe I can go to y=9 directly, but no.\n\nOr perhaps stay at y=6 and then go, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at τ=0, I do S, stay at y=6, then at τ=1, y=6, then action U to y=7 at τ=2, etc., but more turns.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSimilarly, down not useful.\n\nSo minimal is 3.\n\nBut let me see if at some point it is not safe, but in this case it is.\n\nPerhaps for row 8 at τ=2, but it is safe.\n\nBut let me list the dangerous periods again.\n\nFor row 8: dangerous τ=3,4,5\n\nAt τ=2, safe.\n\nIn my action, at τ=2, I am on row 8 and take action U, moving to row 9 for next turn.\n\nAt τ=2, I am on row 8, and since not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen to row 9.\n\nIf I had stayed on row 8 at τ=3, it would be dangerous, but I don't.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be three U actions.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to write for each turn.\n\nSo for turn t_1=9: U\n\nTurn t_1+1=10: U\n\nTurn t_1+2=11: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nNow, the boxed answer.\n\nBut the format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo here:\n\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nWith no turn for t_1 + 3, since after that position is at turn t_1 + H = t_1 +3 =12, y=9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the action sequence, t=9,10,11.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I consider going through other rows, but it would not be faster.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=5, but y=5 is dangerous at τ=2,3, and at τ=0, if I go down, to y=5 at τ=1, then y=5 at τ=1: is it dangerous?\n\ny=5 dangerous at τ=2,3, not τ=1, so at τ=1 on y=5 might be safe, but then I need to go up to 6,7,8,9, more steps.\n\nSimilarly, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, minimal H=3 with three U actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n}\n\nIn the format, it says \"a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps write the actions.\n\nYes.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 10, at position (0,7). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The player updates position at each turn with action U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1) or S (stay: y unchanged). The y-coordinate is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that when moving, the player is only considered to be on the freeway of the current turn's y-coordinate at that turn. So when we are at turn T and we are at y_T, we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. If we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T we are only on y_T, and at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}. \n\nCar update: \n  - For a right-moving car: at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  - For a left-moving car: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the given car state, all cars are right-moving (as per the direction in the table). Also, note that for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate and tail the smaller? Actually, the table says for freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the head is -33 and tail is -44? But that would mean the car is from -44 to -33? But the update rule for right-moving says: \n  initial: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nSo in this case, tau = -44, h = -33. Then at time T, the car is [ -44 + 3*(T-10), -33 + 3*(T-10) ].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: three cars: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> [ -59 + 12*(T-10), -48 + 12*(T-10) ]\n  car2: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> [ -23 + 12*(T-10), -12 + 12*(T-10) ]\n  car3: (24, 13, right, 12) -> [ 13 + 12*(T-10), 24 + 12*(T-10) ]   ... wait, but 13 to 24? That's a positive segment? \n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is given as [tau, h] meaning the tail is the first number? Actually, the table says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". So for freeway 2, the first car: head = -48, tail = -59. But that doesn't make sense because head should be the front? For a right-moving car, the front (head) is at a larger x-coordinate. Here, -48 is greater than -59, so the car spans from x=-59 to x=-48. Similarly, the third car: head=24, tail=13 -> the car is from 13 to 24.\n\nWe are at turn t1 = 10. We are at y=7. We need to get to y=9. We can only move up, down, or stay. Since we are at 7 and we want to go to 9, we need to move up twice. However, we must avoid collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nOur plan: we need to check at each freeway we will be on at the turn we are there. Since we start at y=7 at turn 10, we must check freeway 7 at turn 10, then if we move to y=8 at turn 11, we check freeway 8 at turn 11, then if we move to y=9 at turn 12, we are done (and note that y=9 is not a freeway, so no car check).\n\nBut note: we might not go directly. We might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a car.\n\nSo the minimal H might be 3 (if we go U, U) but we have to check if that is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to take more turns if at turn 10 we are on freeway 7 and there is a car at 0? Or at turn 11 if we are on freeway 8 and there is a car at 0?\n\nSo let's compute the car positions at the required turns.\n\nFirst, we are at turn 10, at y=7. We must check freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n  So at turn T=10: \n      tau = -19, h = -8? But wait, the table says: (head h, tail tau) = (-8, -19). \n  For a right-moving car, the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)] = [-19 + 4*(0), -8 + 4*(0)] = [-19, -8] at T=10.\n  The player is at x=0. Is 0 in [-19, -8]? No, because -8 is less than 0? Actually, -8 is negative, so 0 is not in that interval. So at turn 10, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nNow, if we do U at turn 10, then at turn 11 we are at y=8.\n\nWe then check freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-8, -19, right, 4) -> same as freeway 7? But the table says freeway 8: (-8, -19, right, 4). So same car.\n\nAt turn 11 (T=11): \n  [ -19 + 4*(11-10), -8 + 4*(1) ] = [-19+4, -8+4] = [-15, -4]\n  0 is not in [-15, -4]? Because -4 is still negative. So safe.\n\nThen we do U again at turn 11, and at turn 12 we are at y=9. Done.\n\nSo H=2? But note: the sequence of actions: \n  Turn 10: U -> from y=7 to 8 at turn 11? Actually, at turn 10 we start at y=7. Then at turn 10 we do U, so at the next turn (turn 11) we are at y=8. Then at turn 11 we do U, so at turn 12 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at turn t1 (10) and we are at (0,7). We take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ... until we reach at turn t1+H-1 the position (0,9). So the number of actions is H, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe want to minimize H. With H=2, we do two actions: at turn 10 and 11.\n\nBut wait: at turn 10 we are at (0,7). Then we do action at turn 10: U -> then at turn 11 we are at (0,8). Then at turn 11 we do action U -> at turn 12 we are at (0,9). So we have taken two actions (H=2) and reached at turn 12 (which is t1+2).\n\nBut the problem says: we are to provide the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So for H=2, we have two actions: at t1 and t1+1.\n\nBut we must check the entire path. We have two moves: \n  At turn 10: we are on freeway 7 (because we are at y=7 at turn 10) -> safe as computed.\n  At turn 11: we are on freeway 8 (because we are at y=8 at turn 11) -> safe as computed.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 2 turns.\n\nBut wait, what about the other freeways? We don't go to other freeways. We only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at turn 11: \n  The car on freeway 8: at turn 11: [-19 + 4*(1), -8 + 4] = [-15, -4] -> does not include 0. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at turn 10: [-19, -8] does not include 0.\n\nBut wait, freeway 5 and 6 have cars too? But we are not on those freeways at the turns we are there? We are only on freeway 7 at turn 10 and freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nSo the plan: \n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n\nBut the problem says: we are starting at (0,7) at turn 10. After two moves we are at (0,9) at turn 12.\n\nBut is there a catch? Let me check the car on freeway 8 again. The car on freeway 8 is the same as on freeway 7? The table says for freeway 7 and 8 both have (-8,-19,right,4). But that's two different cars? Or is it the same car? It doesn't matter because they are on different freeways.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 10? We don't care because at turn 10 we are not on freeway 8.\n\nBut what if we stay at freeway 7 for an extra turn? We don't need to.\n\nHowever, let me check if we can do it in one move? That would be moving from 7 to 9 in one move? But the actions only change by +1, -1, or 0. So we can only go to 8 at the next turn. So minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about the other cars? What if we go up and then down? That would be more than 2. So 2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me verify if at turn 10 on freeway 7 is safe? We did: [-19, -8] at turn 10 -> 0 is not in that interval.\n\nBut wait: the car update rule says for right-moving: \n  initial at t1: [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, the car is given as (head, tail). For freeway 7: head=-8, tail=-19. So the car is from -19 to -8? Then at T=10, it's [-19, -8]. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same car? Actually, the table says freeway 7 and 8 both have the same car? But that's two separate cars? Or is it a typo? The table lists each freeway independently. So freeway 7 has one car: (-8,-19,right,4) and freeway 8 has one car: (-8,-19,right,4). They are identical? That's acceptable.\n\nBut note: at turn 10, the car on freeway 7 is at [-19, -8] -> safe.\nAt turn 11, the car on freeway 8 is at [-15, -4] -> safe.\n\nSo the two-step plan is safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? For example, if we were to go through freeway 6? But we don't. We are going from 7 to 8 to 9, so we never set foot on freeways 1-6 during these two moves.\n\nBut wait: the problem says we start at (0,7) at turn 10. Then we move to (0,8) at turn 11, then to (0,9) at turn 12.\n\nSo we are only on freeway 7 at turn 10 and freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 10, if we do nothing (S) and then next turn we do two ups? That would take 3 turns. Worse.\n\nOr if we go down? That would be even worse.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait, what if the car on freeway 8 at turn 11 was covering 0? Then we would have to avoid. But it isn't.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8 at turn 11: \n  T = 11, t1=10 -> delta = 1\n  car: tail = -19, head = -8, speed=4\n  new tail = -19 + 4*1 = -15\n  new head = -8 + 4 = -4\n  So the segment is [-15, -4] -> which is all negative. So 0 is not in it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10 for freeway 7: [-19, -8] -> all negative.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut note: the table has other freeways with multiple cars? For example, freeway 2,3,4 have three cars each. But we are not on those freeways.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t starts at 0? That means:\n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_10\n  t=1: a_{t1+1} = a_11\n\nSo two actions.\n\nBut the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the current turn is t1=10. The problem says: \"current turn is {t_1}\" and in the task it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\". So we start at turn t1.\n\nBut note: the player update: we are at turn t1 at position (0,7). Then we choose an action at turn t1 (10) which will determine the position at turn t1+1 (11). Then at turn t1+1 we choose an action which determines the position at turn t1+2 (12). And at turn t1+2 (12) we are at (0,9). So the last action is at turn t1+1 (11).\n\nTherefore, we have two actions: at turn 10 and 11.\n\nBut let me check the car at turn 12? We don't need to because at turn 12 we are at y=9, which is not a freeway. And the collision condition only applies when on freeways 1-8.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we have to be at freeway 8 at turn 12? No, because at turn 12 we are at y=9, so we are not on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut I notice that freeway 5 and 6 have cars at turn 10? But we are not on them.\n\nHowever, let me check the car on freeway 5: (-6,-17,right,6) at turn 10: \n  [ -17 + 6*(0), -6 + 6*(0) ] = [-17, -6] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same car? It has (-6,-17,right,6) -> same as freeway 5? Then [-17,-6] at turn 10 -> safe.\n\nBut we are at freeway 7, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". We have H=2? But note: we take two actions and we reach at the state after two actions (i.e., at turn 12). The number of turns from t1 to the arrival is H? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions. And then we reach at turn t1+H. So H is the number of actions.\n\nBut the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 1? That would be: at turn 10, we do an action and then at turn 11 we are at (0,9). But the only actions are U, D, S. \n  U: from 7 to 8 -> not 9.\n  D: to 6 -> not 9.\n  S: stay at 7 -> not 9.\nSo impossible in 1. So 2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut wait, the table has freeway 2,3,4 with cars that at turn 10 are at positions that might be dangerous? For example, freeway 2: \n  car1: (-48,-59,right,12) at turn 10: [ -59 + 12*0, -48+0] = [-59,-48] -> safe.\n  car2: (-12,-23,right,12): [-23,-12] -> safe? because -12 is negative.\n  car3: (24,13,right,12): [13,24] -> positive, and 0 is not in [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4: same cars? So same positions? So safe.\n\nBut again, we are not on those freeways.\n\nSo I think the two-step plan is safe and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must move up twice: \\(7 \\to 8 \\to 9\\).\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 2, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, and two upward moves are required.\n\n### Collision Check:\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}\\) and the car span on that freeway includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n- The path involves:\n  - Turn 10: At \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7).\n  - Turn 11: At \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8) after moving up.\n  - Turn 12: At \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, no collision check).\n\n**Freeway 7 at Turn 10**:\n- Car: \\((-8, -19, \\text{right}, 4)\\)\n- For right-moving cars: \\(\\text{Span}(T) = [\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\), where \\(\\tau = -19\\), \\(h = -8\\), \\(s = 4\\), \\(T = 10\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Span}(10) = [-19 + 4(10 - 10), -8 + 4(10 - 10)] = [-19, -8]\n  \\]\n- \\(0 \\notin [-19, -8]\\) (both endpoints negative), so no collision.\n\n**Freeway 8 at Turn 11**:\n- Car: \\((-8, -19, \\text{right}, 4)\\)\n- \\(T = 11\\):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Span}(11) = [-19 + 4(11 - 10), -8 + 4(11 - 10)] = [-19 + 4, -8 + 4] = [-15, -4]\n  \\]\n- \\(0 \\notin [-15, -4]\\) (both endpoints negative), so no collision.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Moving up twice (actions \\(U\\) at turns 10 and 11) reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 in \\(H = 2\\) turns with no collisions.\n- This is minimal since \\(H = 1\\) is impossible (cannot jump from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in one action).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) (move from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) (move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12)\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ } U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,8) at turn t1=11, and we want to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways we are on at the time of the turn.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn we are on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and there is a car on that freeway whose span at turn T covers the x=0 position.\n\nAlso note: when we move (U or D) at turn T, we are at y_T at turn T and then move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check for collisions only with cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nOur current position is y_{t1} = 8. We are at turn 11, position (0,8). We want to get to (0,9). We can only move up, down, or stay. Since we are at 8 and want to go to 9, we would like to go up. However, we must avoid cars on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are currently on freeway 8 at turn 11. We must check if at turn 11, on freeway 8, there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nLooking at freeway 8: there is one car: (-4, -15, right, 4). Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\nBut note: at turn t1 (which is 11), we are at T = t1 = 11. So the car on freeway 8 at turn 11 is exactly as given: head = -4, tail = -15? Wait, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). However, in the given: (-4, -15, right, 4). This seems backwards because -4 is greater than -15. Actually, in the update rule for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning [tail, head] and then it moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\nBut in the given, we have (head, tail) = (-4, -15). Since it's right-moving, the head is the front so the car extends from tail to head, i.e., from -15 to -4? But that would be a car of length 11 (from -15 to -4). However, the update rule says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is given as [tau, h] and then at T it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if we are given (head, tail) in the table, we must interpret: for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? But here head=-4 and tail=-15, and -4 > -15, so the car is from -15 (tail) to -4 (head). Then at T=11, the car is at [tau, h] = [-15, -4]. Then at time T (relative to t1=11, so T=11 is time 0 relative to t1) the car is at [-15 + 4*(0), -4 + 4*(0)] = [-15, -4]. So at turn 11, the car is from -15 to -4. The position x=0 is not covered? Because 0 is not between -15 and -4? Actually, -15 to -4 is from -15 to -4, which does not include 0. So at turn 11, we are safe on freeway 8.\n\nNow, our goal is to get to (0,9). We are at (0,8) at turn 11. We can try to move up at turn 11: then at turn 12 we would be at (0,9). But we must check:\n\n- At turn 11: we are on freeway 8. We are safe as above.\n- At turn 12: we are at freeway 9? But note: we move at turn 11 to go to y=9 at turn 12. At turn 12, we are at y=9. However, the freeways are only from y=1 to y=8. The goal is at (0,9) which is above the freeways. So we don't have to worry about cars at y=9 because there are no freeways at y=9. So when we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1: we just need one action to go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut let me check the move: at turn 11, we are at y=8. We take action U. Then at the next turn (turn 12) we are at y=9 and we have reached the goal.\n\nSo the sequence is just one action: at turn 11, action U.\n\nBut wait, we must also check if during the move we are safe at turn 11? We are at turn 11 on freeway 8: we already checked that at turn 11 the car on freeway 8 does not cover x=0. And at turn 12 we are at freeway 9, which has no cars.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in one move.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states at turn 11 for freeway 8: the car is at [-15, -4] at turn 11. So x=0 is not in that interval. Safe.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". At turn 11 we are on freeway 8 and safe. At turn 12 we are on freeway 9 (which is not a freeway with cars) so no issue.\n\nBut wait: the goal is to reach (0,9) at the end of the sequence. The sequence of actions is for turns starting at t1 (which is 11) and we do H actions. So after H actions, we have taken H steps and we are at turn t1 + H - 1? Actually, the sequence is from t = t1 to t1+H-1. And the position after H actions is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Let me read:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n- t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{t1} -> leads to state at turn t1+1\n- t=1: a_{t1+1} -> leads to state at turn t1+2\n- ...\n- t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> leads to state at turn t1+H\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me read again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo the position at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). How do we get there?\n\nWe start at turn t1 at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8). Then we take an action at turn t1 (which is a_{t1}) and that updates the state to turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we are saying that at the turn t1+H-1 (which is the last turn we are acting on? Actually, the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, so we take H actions. Then the state at turn t1+H is the state after the last action. But the condition is on the state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWait, that is confusing. Let me clarify with an example:\n\nAt turn t1 (11): we are at y_{11}=8.\n\nAfter action a_{11} (at turn 11), we get y_{12} = y_{11} + Delta y_{11}.\n\nThen at turn 12, we are at y_{12}. Then if we take another action at turn 12, we get y_{13} and so on.\n\nThe condition is that at turn t1+H-1, the position is (0,9). So if H=1, then we are requiring y_{t1+H-1} = y_{11} = 8? But we want it to be 9. That doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, H must be at least 2? Because:\n\n- We start at turn t1 (11) at y=8.\n- We take action a_{11}: then at turn 12 we are at y=9 (if we choose U).\n- Then we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 = 12 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H must be such that 11+H-1 = 12 => H=2.\n\nBut then we are taking two actions: a_{11} and a_{12}. However, after the first action (at turn 11) we are already at y=9 at turn 12. Then why do we need a second action?\n\nThis seems to be a misunderstanding. Let me reread the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we take actions for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H is the state after the last action.\n\nBut the condition is: we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be the state at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action?\n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThis means that at the turn t1+H-1 (before taking the action of that turn?) we are at y=9? But that doesn't make sense because we start at t1 at y=8.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that the state y_t is defined at the beginning of turn t? Then we take action a_t and then we update to y_{t+1}. So:\n\n- At turn t1: state is y_{t1}=8. Then we take action a_{t1} and move to y_{t1+1}.\n- We want that at turn t1+H-1, the state is 9. That is, we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1, we are at 8. Then we take actions to get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we take one action (H=1), then we are acting at turn t1 (only one action) and then at the next turn (t1+1) we are at y_{t1+1}. But the condition is on turn t1+H-1 = t1+1-1 = t1. So we require that at the beginning of turn t1 we are at 9? But we are at 8. So that fails.\n\nIf we take two actions (H=2), then we require at turn t1+2-1 = t1+1 we are at 9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at 9. How do we get there?\n\n- At turn t1 (beginning): y_{t1}=8.\n- We take action a_{t1} (say U) and then at turn t1+1 (beginning) we are at y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nSo that satisfies the condition: at turn t1+1 (which is t1+H-1 with H=2) we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we need H=2. The sequence of actions is for turns t1 and t1+1? But note the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so a_{t1+0} and a_{t1+1}? Wait, no: the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}. So for H=2: \n- t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{11}\n- t=1: a_{t1+1} = a_{12}\n\nBut we only need to get to y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+1 (which is turn 12). Then what is the action at turn 12 for? It doesn't affect the state at turn 12? Because the state at turn 12 is already determined by the previous action.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look again at the problem statement:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIt says: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? But that cannot be because we are taking an action at that turn.\n\nI think there is a mix-up. Let me think of the state after the actions:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at state s_{t1} = (0,8). Then we take action a_{t1} and move to state s_{t1+1} = (0, y_{t1+1}).\n- Then at turn t1+1: we are at state s_{t1+1}. Then we take action a_{t1+1} and move to s_{t1+2}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some state. The condition is that the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). But we are taking an action at turn t1+H-1? That action might move us away.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after taking the sequence of H actions, the final state (at the end of the last action) is (0,9). That would be state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the condition says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the answer format: they say \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" and then \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\" etc. and the last turn they write is t1+H-1.\n\nAnd they require the minimal H.\n\nIn our case, we want to be at (0,9) as quickly as possible. The earliest we can be at (0,9) is at turn 12 (t1+1). So we want H to be minimal such that at the end of the sequence we are at (0,9). But the condition is written as at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nLet me assume that the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then:\n\n- Turn t1: state y_{t1}=8. We take action a_{t1} and that determines y_{t1+1}.\n- Turn t1+1: we start at y_{t1+1}. We take action a_{t1+1} and that determines y_{t1+2}.\n\nWe want that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the state is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nFor H=2: we want y_{t1+1} = 9. How? We start at y_{t1}=8. We take action a_{t1}=U, then y_{t1+1}=9. Then at turn t1+1 (the next turn) we start at 9. So we have achieved y_{t1+1}=9. Then we are done? But we are taking two actions? The sequence would be:\n\nTurn t1: U\nTurn t1+1: ? \n\nBut we don't need to do anything at turn t1+1 because we are already at 9 at the beginning of that turn. However, the problem says we must provide a sequence of H actions. So for H=2, we must provide two actions.\n\nBut note: we are at turn t1+1 at the beginning at y=9. Then we take an action at that turn. But we don't want to move away? And also, we must avoid collisions. However, at turn t1+1, we are on freeway 9? There is no freeway 9, so no collision. But if we move down, we go back to 8, which we don't want. So we can just stay (S) at turn t1+1.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nThen at the beginning of turn 12 we are at y=9 (from the previous action). Then we take S and remain at 9 at turn 13. But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 = 11+2-1 = 12 we are at 9. Which we are at the beginning of turn 12.\n\nSo that satisfies.\n\nBut note: we must check collisions at every turn we are on a freeway (y=1..8). At turn 11: we are at freeway 8. We already checked that at turn 11 the car on freeway 8 is at [-15,-4] so safe.\n\nAt turn 12: we are at freeway 9? But that's not in 1..8, so no car to collide. Then we take action S at turn 12: that means we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn 12 and then we stay at y=9 at turn 13. But during turn 12, we are on freeway 9? No, freeways are only 1-8. So safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn 12, when we are at freeway 9, we don't check. Then why do we need to take the second action? Because the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and for H=2 we must take two actions. However, the minimal H might be 1? But we saw that with H=1 we cannot satisfy the condition because then we require y_{11}=9, which is not true.\n\nSo H must be 2.\n\nBut let me see if there is a way with H=1? Only if we were already at 9 at turn 11, but we are not.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn 11 when we move? We are at freeway 8 at turn 11: safe. Then we move to freeway 9 at turn 12. So the entire sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=2. Is there a way to get there in one action? We cannot because the condition is on turn t1+H-1. For H=1, we would require turn t1 (11) to be at 9, which it is not.\n\nBut what if we do nothing? We are at 8 at turn 11 and we want to be at 9 at turn 11? Impossible.\n\nSo we must have at least H=2.\n\nBut wait, what about the car movements? We only checked at turn 11 for freeway 8. What about the next turns? In this plan, we are only on freeway 8 at turn 11 and then at turn 12 we are at 9. So we don't need to check other freeways.\n\nHowever, let me check the car on freeway 8 at turn 12? Because we are at turn 12 at freeway 9, so we don't care. But just for completeness: the car on freeway 8 at turn 12 (which is T = t1+1 = 12) is: \n- It is right-moving: so at T=12 (which is 1 turn after t1=11), the car moves: \n   tau = -15, h = -4, speed=4, so new head = -4 + 4*(1) = 0, new tail = -15 + 4*(1) = -11.\n   So the car spans from -11 to 0 at turn 12. This includes x=0? The span is [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. So x=0 is included? But we are not on freeway 8 at turn 12, so no collision.\n\nBut if we had stayed on freeway 8 at turn 12, we would have collided. But we are moving away.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go up at turn 11? Then at turn 12 we are at 9. Then we do nothing (S) at turn 12 to remain at 9. That's the plan.\n\nBut the problem says: when we move at turn T, we are at y_T at turn T and then we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at turn 11, we are at y=8 (freeway8) and then we move to y=9 for turn 12.\n\nSo we are never on freeway 8 at turn 12? We are at freeway 9 at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut why do we need the S? Because H=2, so we must provide two actions. And at turn 12, we are at y=9 and we don't want to move, so we stay.\n\nBut note: the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 = 11+2-1 = 12 we are at 9. We are at the beginning of turn 12 at 9, so we have reached the goal. Then the action at turn 12 is just to keep us there? But the problem doesn't say we have to stay there, but since we are providing two actions, we do the minimal necessary.\n\nAlternatively, could we do:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut that would try to go to y=10, which is invalid? The grid only goes from y=0 to 9. So if we try to go up from 9, it should clamp? The update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and it must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, it should stay at 9? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So it might clamp: if you try to go above 9, you stay at 9. So we could do U again and it would be the same as S? But that is unnecessary. We can do S.\n\nSo both are valid. But S is more natural.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=2. Is there a way with H=1? No, as explained.\n\nBut let me see the definition: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. For H=1, we only have one action at turn t1. Then the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 = t1 we are at 9. But we start at 8 at turn t1, so impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are taking two actions. So H=2.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some problems, the initial state might be considered as turn 0. But here, we start at turn t1=11.\n\nBut let me check the car at freeway 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 again? Because we are going to freeway 9, so we don't care. But what if we had to go through other freeways? We don't: we start at 8 and go to 9 in one move.\n\nBut what about freeway 9? It doesn't exist, so safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". So only when we are on freeways 1 to 8 we must check. When we are on y=0 or y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 11: we have a car at [-15,-4] -> does not cover 0.\n\nAt turn 12: the car moves to [-11,0] -> covers 0, but we are not on freeway 8 at turn 12.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, and the actions are:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". For H=2, t=0: t1+0=11, t=1: t1+1=12.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the current turn is t1=11, and we are to write the actions starting at turn 11.\n\nBut note: the car states are given at turn 11. We have used that.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway 8 at turn 11. We don't go to any other freeway. So we only need to check freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there is any car at freeway 8 at turn 11 that we missed? The table says freeway 8: one car (-4,-15,right,4) -> as above.\n\nFreeway 7: also a car (-4,-15,right,4). But we are not on freeway 7 at turn 11.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2. Is there a way with H=1? We argued no because of the condition on the turn index.\n\nBut perhaps the problem means that we must reach (0,9) at the end of the last action, which would be turn t1+H. Then for H=1: we take action at turn 11 and then at turn 12 we are at 9. Then we would require that at turn 12 we are at 9, which we are. But the condition in the problem is stated as y_{t1+H-1}=9. For H=1, that would be y_{11}=9, which is not true.\n\nSo we must stick to the condition as written.\n\nTherefore, we go with H=2.\n\nBut let me see the example in the problem? There is no example. So we follow the condition.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=11, and we are to write the actions for turn 11 and then turn 12.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut that would take two moves and we get to 9 at turn 13. But then at turn 12 we are still at 8. And we require to be at 9 at turn 12? For H=2, we require at turn 11+2-1=12 we are at 9. So if we do S at turn 11, we remain at 8 at turn 12. Then at turn 12 we do U and get to 9 at turn 13. But then at turn 12 we are at 8, not 9. So that fails.\n\nTherefore, we must go up at turn 11.\n\nSo the above is the only possibility.\n\nBut wait, what if we do D at turn 11? Then we go to 7 at turn 12. Then we are not at 9 at turn 12. So that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only minimal sequence is U at turn 11 and then S at turn 12.\n\nBut we could do U at turn 11 and then U at turn 12? That would keep us at 9 (since it clamps). But that is also acceptable. However, S is sufficient.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify which action to choose if multiple are possible. Since we are minimizing the number of turns, and both S and U (if at 9) are equivalent in terms of movement, we can choose S.\n\nBut to be safe, let me see if doing U at turn 12 causes any issue? At turn 12, we are at freeway 9: no cars. Then we do U: we try to go to 10, but it clamps to 9. So we stay at 9. So it's the same as S.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and do U, Delta y_t=+1, but then y_{t+1} = min(9+1,9)=9? Or is it clamped? The problem doesn't specify clamping, but it says y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]. So if we do U at 9, we get 10, but then it is set to 9? Or is it disallowed? The problem doesn't say. It says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so we assume that if the move would take it out, it is clamped to the boundary.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do S, which is explicitly staying.\n\nSo I think S is better.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The goal is to have \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\), meaning the player must be at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\).\n- Starting at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11, the minimal \\(H\\) is 2, as:\n  - For \\(H = 1\\), the condition requires \\(y_{11} = 9\\) (at the beginning of turn 11), but the initial position is \\(y = 8\\).\n  - For \\(H = 2\\), the condition requires \\(y_{12} = 9\\) (at the beginning of turn 12), which is achievable.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- **Turn 11 (current turn)**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to transition from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 12.\n- **Turn 12**: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the condition at the beginning of turn 12 (\\(y_{12} = 9\\)).\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn 11**: The player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 is given as \\((-4, -15, \\text{right}, 4)\\). At turn 11 (\\(T = 11\\)):\n  - Right-moving car: span = \\([\\tau + s \\cdot (T - t_1), h + s \\cdot (T - t_1)] = [-15 + 4 \\cdot 0, -4 + 4 \\cdot 0] = [-15, -4]\\).\n  - Position \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([-15, -4]\\), so no collision.\n- **At turn 12**: The player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), so no collision check is needed.\n- The action \\(S\\) at turn 12 does not change the position, and since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it remains safe.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H = 2\\), and the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}",
