        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. The current turn is t=0.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Also, internal obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). So, I can't move into these cells.\n\nSnake positions: only [(3,3)]. That means the snake is just one cell long, so it's only the head. Head direction is left (L), which is decreasing x.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (5,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive. No negative food here.\n\nSince the snake is only one cell, there's no body to worry about, so no collision risk with itself except for the tail reward danger, but that might not apply yet.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides. But here, since the snake is only one cell, the tail is the same as head, but when it eats food, it grows. Let me think.\n\nCurrently, snake is at (3,3), head direction L. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. The rule says \"no instant reverse\", so I can't move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so I can't move R immediately.\n\nSo for turn 0, possible actions: U, D, L. Moving L would be in the same direction, which is fine.\n\nNow, grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4).\n\nSnake at (3,3). Food at (4,3), (5,5), (1,3).\n\n(4,3) is to the right of (3,3), but since current direction is L, I can't move R immediately. (1,3) is to the left, same row. (5,5) is up and right.\n\nLife span: all food has life span 10, and it decreases each turn, including current, so after this turn, life span will be 9 for each, I think? The state says life span 10 at turn 0, so after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead. Since the snake is short, I can grow safely for now.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from (3,3) with direction L.\n\n- Move L (left) to (2,3)\n\n- Move U (up) to (3,4)\n\n- Move D (down) to (3,2)\n\nNow, check for walls or obstacles.\n\n(2,3): is this a wall? Internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4). (2,3) is not in that list, and not border since x=2 between 0 and 7, y=3 between 0 and 7, so safe.\n\n(3,4): not in obstacles, and y=4<7, x=3>0, safe.\n\n(3,2): obstacles have (3,1), but (3,2) is not listed, so should be safe. Borders: y=2>0, so ok.\n\nNow, food: (4,3) is at (4,3), which is right of (3,3). To eat it, I need to move right, but I can't this turn because of direction. (1,3) is at (1,3), left of (3,3). (5,5) is at (5,5).\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider each move.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3)\n\nThen, from (2,3), direction is now L (since I moved left).\n\nPossible moves: L, U, D (not R, since opposite).\n\nMove L to (1,3): (1,3) has food! Value 1, life span 10. If I move to (1,3), I eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut snake is currently length 1. After eating, length becomes 2. The food is at (1,3), and I move to it.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: but since I'm eating, the snake grows, so new tail is where the head was, but since it was length 1, after eating, head is at (1,3), and tail is at (3,3)? No.\n\nSnake positions: before move, snake is at [(3,3)]. After moving to (2,3) without eating, snake is still [(2,3)], since no food eaten.\n\nBut if I move directly to (1,3) from (2,3), and (1,3) has food.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: move from (3,3) to (2,3). No food at (2,3), so snake remains [(2,3)], length 1. Direction now L.\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), move L to (1,3). (1,3) has food, so I eat it. Snake grows: head moves to (1,3), tail stays? Since it was length 1, after eating, snake becomes [(1,3), (2,3)]? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the head moves to the new cell, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions [head, ... , tail]\n\nAfter moving to a cell with food, head moves to food cell, tail remains in place, so new positions: [new head, old head, ... , tail] but since it was single cell, it becomes [new head, old position].\n\nIn this case:\n\nTurn 0 start: snake at [(3,3)]\n\nTurn 0: move to (2,3), no food, so snake now at [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 1: move to (1,3), food present, so eat: head moves to (1,3), and since it grew, the body is added, so snake becomes [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nLength 2.\n\nNow, tail is at (2,3).\n\nHead at (1,3).\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,3): direction is L (since last move was left).\n\nBut (1,3) is at x=1, y=3. Borders: x=0 is wall, so I can't move left to (0,3), which would be illegal anyway since wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,1) and (1,6) are on this row, but (1,3) is not obstacle, but moving.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2), R to (2,3). But (2,3) is the tail, but in snake, if I move to tail, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut after moving, the tail moves, so if head moves to where tail was, and tail moves away, no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (1,3), if I move R to (2,3), which is current tail position.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied by tail. But since tail will move, depending on the move.\n\nLet's see: current positions: head (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nIf I move head right to (2,3), but (2,3) has the tail. After the move, the tail should move to where? In snake movement, when head moves, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nSo, from [ (1,3), (2,3) ], if head moves to (2,3), but (2,3) is current position of tail, so head would be moving to the same cell as tail, which is a collision? But the rule says you can move to tail cell because tail moves.\n\nI think I need to clarify.\n\nTypically in snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its current cell, so if head moves to where tail was, it's ok as long as tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: before move, positions: head at H, tail at T.\n\nAfter move, head moves to new position N, and tail moves to the next segment, so T is vacated.\n\nIf N is the same as T, then head and tail are at same cell only if it's the only segment, but with length 2, H and T are different.\n\nIn this case, from [ (1,3), (2,3) ], head at (1,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nIf head moves to (2,3), which is where tail is. After move, head is at (2,3), and the tail should move to where? The body segment that was at (2,3) was the tail, but since head moved to (2,3), and the snake moves, the tail position is updated.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the snake as a list.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (1,3), index 1: tail (2,3)\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, say to (2,3), but (2,3) is already occupied by the tail, so moving there would cause collision because the cell is occupied before the tail moves.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" but \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIt depends on the implementation.\n\nIn many snake games, moving to the tail cell is allowed if the tail is moving away, so no collision.\n\nFor example, if snake is [H, T], and H moves to T's position, and T moves to the previous position or something.\n\nBut when head moves, the tail moves only if no growth, so with growth, it's different.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off, so the cell is free.\n\n- If food, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows.\n\nIn the case where head moves to tail's cell:\n\nSuppose positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nIf head moves to B, which is tail.\n\nIf no food at B, then after move, head is at B, and tail moves off B to... but since it was at B, and the segment before is A, but A is moving to B, so the new tail position depends.\n\nAfter moving head to B, the new positions become [B, A] or something? Let's not confuse.\n\nI think it's safer to refer to the rules given.\n\nThe core rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, for body collision: \"head touches any body segment\" except that tail case.\n\nBut in this situation, when head moves to tail cell, it should be ok because the tail moves away.\n\nIn my example, from (1,3) moving to (2,3), which is tail.\n\nAfter move, head is at (2,3), and the tail was at (2,3), but since the snake moves, the tail segment moves to the position that was the head's previous position, I think.\n\nPositions before move: head (1,3), body/tail (2,3)\n\nHead moves to (2,3). The new head position is (2,3). Since it moved to a cell with food or not? (2,3) may or may not have food.\n\nIn this case, (2,3) is the tail position, not food.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), the tail needs to be updated. Since no growth, the tail moves to the next position in the chain. The segment that was at (2,3) is the tail, and it was preceded by the head, which is moving, so the new tail position is where the head was, (1,3).\n\nSo new positions: head at (2,3), tail at (1,3). So they are at different cells, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food at (2,3), eating would occur, tail doesn't move, so head at (2,3), tail at (2,3), collision.\n\nBut in this case, no food at (2,3) in that scenario.\n\nBack to the food.\n\nIn my earlier plan, if I move to (1,3) on turn 1, I eat the food, snake grows to [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nThen from there, I can move, say, down to (1,2) or up to (1,4), or right to (2,3) but (2,3) is the tail.\n\nMoving to (2,3) should be safe as per rule, since tail will move.\n\nBut let's list cells.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- U to (1,4): is this safe? y=4, x=1. Internal obstacles: (1,1) and (1,6), so (1,4) is not obstacle, borders ok.\n\n- D to (1,2): (1,2) not obstacle, y=2>0.\n\n- R to (2,3): which is current tail, but should be safe.\n\nBut (2,3) is not a wall.\n\nAlso, cannot move L to (0,3) because x=0 wall.\n\nSo options U, D, R.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) and (5,5) still available.\n\nBut (1,3) food is eaten, so only two left.\n\nLife span decreases each turn.\n\nTurn 0: food life span 10\n\nAfter turn 0: life span 9 for all\n\nAfter turn 1: life span 8, etc.\n\nBut since I'm planning, I need to think ahead.\n\nAnother option at turn 0: instead of moving L, I could move U or D.\n\nLet's consider the food at (4,3). It's at (4,3), which is adjacent right, but I can't move right this turn.\n\nIf I move up or down, I might be able to go around.\n\nBut (4,3) is on the same row, so if I don't go left, it might be available later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is at (5,5).\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but since snake is short, not an issue yet.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no body, so all food is accessible.\n\nBut for example, if food is under body, I need to move away first, but here no.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves for turn 0.\n\nMove L to (2,3):\n\n- Then from (2,3), I can move to (1,3) to eat food on turn 1, as above.\n\nMove U to (3,4):\n\n- Then direction U. Possible moves U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n\nU to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nBut (2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) to (2,4) not possible.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible:\n\n- U to (3,5): not wall, not obstacle\n\n- R to (4,4): not wall, not obstacle (internal obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), so (4,4) clear)\n\n- D to (3,3): but (3,3) is where I came from, but in terms of position, it might be empty now, but direction: if I move D, it's opposite to current U? Current direction after moving U is U, so moving D would be instant reverse, not allowed. So cannot move D.\n\nSimilarly, L to (2,4) is wall, cannot.\n\nSo only U or R from (3,4).\n\nIf U to (3,5), then from there, etc.\n\nBut no food nearby immediately.\n\nSimilarly, move D from (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nThen direction D.\n\nPossible moves D, L, R (not U, opposite).\n\nD to (3,1): but (3,1) is internal obstacle! Cannot move there.\n\nL to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(2,2) not obstacle, (4,2) not obstacle.\n\nAlso, cannot move U to (3,3) because opposite direction.\n\nSo from (3,2), can move D to (3,1) but wall, or L to (2,2), or R to (4,2).\n\nOnly L or R possible.\n\n(3,1) is obstacle, so cannot move D.\n\nSo options: L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\nNow, comparing the options.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) on turn 0, I can then move to (1,3) on turn 1 to eat the food there.\n\n(1,3) has food with life span 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns, but I can eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,3) is close, but I can't reach it directly.\n\nFood at (5,5) is farther.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating food is good.\n\nBut also, after eating, the snake grows, which might make it harder to move later.\n\nBut since grid has obstacles, I need to be careful.\n\nMoreover, with one cell, I can go anywhere easily.\n\nLet me plan a path.\n\nFirst, consider moving towards (1,3).\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3) and eat food. Snake now at [(1,3), (2,3)], length 2, direction L.\n\nNow, from (1,3), I need to move. Possible moves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2), R to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is the tail, but moving to (2,3) should be safe as per rule.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), since no food (assuming), head moves to (2,3), tail moves to (1,3)? Positions before move: head (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nHead moves to (2,3), new head at (2,3). Since no growth, tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The segment before tail is head, which was at (1,3), so tail moves to (1,3). So new positions: head (2,3), tail (1,3). No collision.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move.\n\nBut (1,3) food is eaten, so no food there now.\n\nAvailable food: (4,3) and (5,5)\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (2,3), after moving from (1,3) to (2,3), direction is R (since moved right).\n\nThen I can move R to (3,3), for example.\n\n(3,3) is empty now, I think.\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3)\n\nTurn 0: move to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move to (1,3), eat, snake at [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: move R to (2,3)? (2,3) is current tail.\n\nHead at (1,3), move to (2,3), which is tail position.\n\nAfter move, head at (2,3), tail moves to (1,3), so positions [(2,3), (1,3)]\n\nNow, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: R to (3,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is internal wall, so cannot move U to (2,4).\n\nD to (2,2): not obstacle.\n\nR to (3,3): not obstacle.\n\nSo can move R or D.\n\nIf move R to (3,3), then from there, etc.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), so I can go right to (3,3), then (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food.\n\nFrom (2,3), move R to (3,3) on turn 2.\n\nThen on turn 3, from (3,3), direction R, move R to (4,3) and eat food, since (4,3) has food.\n\nSnake grows to length 3.\n\nPositions: before turn 3, snake at [(2,3), (1,3)]? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 2: positions [(2,3), (1,3)] with head (2,3)\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,3). No food at (3,3), so head moves to (3,3), tail moves to (2,3)? Positions: before move, head (2,3), tail (1,3)\n\nHead moves to (3,3), new head (3,3). Tail moves to the position of the next segment, which was (1,3), but the segment before tail is head, which moved, so tail moves to where head was, (2,3). So new positions: head (3,3), tail (2,3). Body is [(3,3), (2,3)].\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (4,3). (4,3) has food, so eat: head moves to (4,3), tail does not move, so new positions: head (4,3), and body (3,3), tail (2,3). So [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nFrom here, I can move to other food.\n\nFood at (5,5) still.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), which is up and right.\n\nPossible moves from (4,3): U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nBut L to (3,3) is body, (3,3) is body segment, not tail. Tail is at (2,3), so (3,3) is body, so moving to (3,3) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, U, D, R possible.\n\n(5,3) is not food, but I can go towards (5,5).\n\nFor example, move U to (4,4), then to (4,5), then to (5,5), but (4,5) to (5,5) is right.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nFirst, back to turn 0.\n\nIf I move L, I can eat (1,3) on turn 1, then (4,3) on turn 3, so by turn 3, I have eaten two foods, length 3.\n\nNow, what about moving other ways.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move U to (3,4).\n\nThen direction U.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nNo food, snake at [(3,4)]\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), move U to (3,5) or R to (4,4) (cannot L to (2,4) wall, cannot D opposite).\n\nSay move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 2, from (4,4), I can move towards (5,5) or other.\n\nBut (5,5) is food, at (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), move R to (5,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut not directly close to (1,3) or (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I move D on turn 0 to (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), move L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\nSay move R to (4,2), then to (4,3) to eat food on turn 2? Turn 0: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2), say move R to (4,2) (assuming direction R now)\n\n(4,2) no food, so snake at [(4,2)]\n\nThen turn 2: move to (4,3), which has food, eat, grow to length 2: [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,3) or (5,5).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is left, but snake now at (4,3) and (4,2), so moving left might be possible but longer path.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is up.\n\nBut compared to moving left first, I ate (1,3) earlier.\n\nIn the first path, by moving L on turn 0, I eat (1,3) on turn 1 and (4,3) on turn 3.\n\nIn this path, if I move D then R, I eat (4,3) on turn 2, but (1,3) is farther, and might expire or something.\n\nLife span is 10, so after 3 turns, life span 7, still plenty.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), which is near the border, and with obstacles, it might be tricky to reach later.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), to go to (1,3), I need to go left, but row y=3 has obstacles? At (1,1) and (1,6), but (1,3) is at y=3, x=1, and (1,1) is at y=1, so same x but different y, so row y=3 is clear except borders.\n\nInternal obstacles at (1,1) and (1,6), but (1,1) is x=1,y=1, (1,6) x=1,y=6, so for y=3, x=1, it's free, but to reach it, from (4,3), I can move left to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied if snake is there.\n\nIn the first scenario, when I ate (1,3) early, it was easy.\n\nIf I don't, and go to (4,3) first, then to go to (1,3), I need to move left along y=3.\n\nBut if the snake is longer, it might block the path.\n\nFor example, if I have snake at [(4,3), (4,2)] after eating (4,3), then to go to (3,3), I can move left to (3,3), but (3,3) is empty, so ok.\n\nThen to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so I can go to (2,3) only if not blocked.\n\nBut since short, possible.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nFor instance, from (4,3), move L to (3,3) on turn 3 (if turn 2 ate (4,3)), but let's count turns.\n\nCase 1: move L on turn 0\n\n- T0: (2,3)\n\n- T1: (1,3) eat, snake [(1,3),(2,3)]\n\n- T2: move to (2,3)? Earlier I moved to (3,3) to go to (4,3), but from (1,3), I moved R to (2,3) on T2.\n\nIn T2, from (1,3) move to (2,3), then positions [(2,3),(1,3)]\n\nT3: from (2,3) move R to (3,3), positions [(3,3),(2,3)]\n\nT4: move R to (4,3) eat, positions [(4,3),(3,3),(2,3)]\n\nAte second food on T4.\n\nIf I go directly to (4,3) first.\n\nT0: move D to (3,2) for example.\n\nT0: move D to (3,2), snake [(3,2)]\n\nT1: move R to (4,2), snake [(4,2)]\n\nT2: move U to (4,3) eat? From (4,2) move to (4,3), which is up, and (4,3) has food, so eat, snake [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nAte (4,3) on T2.\n\nThen to eat (1,3), need to go left.\n\nT3: from (4,3) move L to (3,3), positions [(3,3),(4,3)]? Head at (4,3), move L to (3,3), no food, so head to (3,3), tail to (4,2)? Positions before move: head (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nMove head to (3,3), new head (3,3). Tail moves to where? The segment before tail is head, which was at (4,3), so tail moves to (4,3)? No.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (4,3), index 1: tail (4,2)\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, say (3,3), the body segments follow: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so tail moves to (4,3).\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nBut (4,3) is where head was, and tail is now at (4,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (2,3) on T4.\n\nT4: from (3,3) move L to (2,3), no food, head to (2,3), tail to (3,3)? Positions: head (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nMove head to (2,3), new head (2,3). Tail moves to where head was, (3,3). So positions [(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nThen T5: move L to (1,3) eat, positions [(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)] after growth.\n\nAte (1,3) on T5.\n\nCompared to first path: ate (1,3) on T1 and (4,3) on T3 or T4? In first path, with L move:\n\nT0: L to (2,3)\n\nT1: L to (1,3) eat, snake length 2\n\nT2: say move R to (2,3) but (2,3) was tail, but we moved to (3,3) earlier.\n\nIn my first sequence: T2 move to (3,3), then T3 move to (4,3) eat on T3.\n\nT0: (3,3) to (2,3)\n\nT1: (2,3) to (1,3) eat, snake [(1,3),(2,3)]\n\nT2: (1,3) to (2,3)? Or to (3,3)? I said to (3,3) but from (1,3), moving to (3,3) directly? No, adjacent only.\n\nFrom (1,3), to go to (3,3), I need to go to (2,3) first.\n\nSo T2: from (1,3) move to (2,3), which is tail position, but safe, positions become head (2,3), tail (1,3) or [(2,3),(1,3)]\n\nT3: from (2,3) move to (3,3), positions [(3,3),(2,3)]\n\nT4: from (3,3) move to (4,3) eat, positions [(4,3),(3,3),(2,3)]\n\nSo ate (1,3) on T1 and (4,3) on T4.\n\nIn the other path, ate (4,3) on T2 and (1,3) on T5.\n\nSo first path eats first food sooner, but second food on T4 vs T2 and T5.\n\nT1 and T4 vs T2 and T5, so similar, but in first path, I have two foods by T4, in second, by T5.\n\nBut T4 vs T5, so first path is faster by one turn for the second food? No: first path: food1 on T1, food2 on T4; second path: food1 (4,3) on T2, food2 (1,3) on T5. So both have two foods by T4 or T5, but in first, food1 earlier.\n\nBut also, the food at (5,5) is still there.\n\nNow, after eating, I can go to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has life span 10, so ok.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. But with short snake, not an issue.\n\nNow, what about moving towards (5,5) first?\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), from (3,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut I can't move right immediately because direction L.\n\nSo I have to move U or D or L first.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut it might take more turns to reach (5,5).\n\nFor example, T0: move U to (3,4)\n\nT1: move R to (4,4)  // since U, can move R\n\nT2: move R to (5,4) or U to (4,5)\n\nSay move U to (4,5) to go to (5,5)\n\nT2: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)\n\nThen T3: from (4,5) move R to (5,5) eat.\n\nSo eat (5,5) on T3.\n\nBut I missed (1,3) and (4,3), which are closer.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is at (4,3), same x as (4,5), but different y.\n\nBut I can go down later.\n\nBut (1,3) is far.\n\nSince all food positive, I should eat all if possible.\n\nBut with life span, I have time.\n\nLife span 10, so after 10 turns, food disappears.\n\nFrom turn 0, food disappears when life span <=0, so at turn 10, life span 0, disappears? Or after turn 10.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, life span L, at turn t+1, L-1, and when L=0, it disappears before the turn or after? \"Disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from spawn, it is gone.\n\nBut since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 0, L=10, after turn 0, L=9, ..., after turn 9, L=1, after turn 10, L=0, and it disappears, so on turn 10, it is not there.\n\nSimilarly, can be eaten on turns when L>0.\n\nFor (1,3), if I don't eat by turn 9, it disappears.\n\nBut since I can eat on turn 1, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nBut I also need to consider risks, but with short snake, no risks yet.\n\nAnother point: the food at (1,3) is near the border and obstacles, so if I don't eat it early, with longer snake, it might be harder to reach, but since the row is clear, it should be ok.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles: at (1,1) and (1,6), so for y=3, x=1, it's free, but to enter, from left, only from (2,3), which is clear.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so if I come from above or below, I might not be able to go to (1,3) if not from (2,3).\n\nFor example, if I am at (1,4), I can go down to (1,3), but (1,4) is free, no obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) free.\n\nSo I can reach (1,3) from above or below or right.\n\nBut with snake body, it might block, but early on, not an issue.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the closest food first.\n\n(1,3) is adjacent left, but I can't move left directly? I can move L on turn 0 to (2,3), then to (1,3) on turn 1.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent right, but I can't move right this turn.\n\n(5,5) is two moves away, but not directly.\n\nDistance to (1,3): from (3,3), one move to (2,3), then to (1,3), so two moves to eat.\n\nTo (4,3): from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) in one move, but I can't because direction L, can't move R.\n\nIf I move U or D, I can then move right later, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,4), then from there I can move R to (4,4), then to (4,3) or something, but (4,3) is at y=3, so from (4,4) to (4,3) is down, which might be possible.\n\nBut let's calculate turns.\n\nShortest path to (4,3): if I could move R, one turn, but can't. Next best, move U or D, then on next turn move towards.\n\nBut after moving U to (3,4), on turn 1, I can move R to (4,4), then on turn 2, move D to (4,3) to eat. So eat on turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (3,2) on turn 0, then turn 1 move R to (4,2), turn 2 move U to (4,3) eat, same turn 2.\n\nBut for (1,3), if I move L on turn 0 to (2,3), turn 1 to (1,3) eat on turn 1.\n\nSo (1,3) can be eaten on turn 1, (4,3) on turn 2 at best if I go directly, but since I can't go directly to (4,3) from start, earliest is turn 2.\n\n(5,5) on turn 3 as above.\n\nSo by moving L first, I eat (1,3) on turn 1, then I can eat (4,3) on turn 3 or 4, as before.\n\nIf I go for (4,3) first by moving U or D, I eat it on turn 2, then (1,3) on turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut eating (1,3) on turn 1 gives score earlier, but since score is cumulative, it doesn't matter when, as long as I eat before expiration.\n\nBut for long-term, eating early might be better to have more flexibility with shorter snake.\n\nBut with one cell, it's easy.\n\nAnother food: (5,5), I can eat it later.\n\nBut there is a risk if I don't eat it, but life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nNow, the tail reward danger: but for now, no issue.\n\nAlso, food under body: not applicable.\n\nSo for turn 0, moving L to (2,3) seems good to get (1,3) quickly.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,3).\n\nBut after eating (1,3), I am at (1,3) with tail at (2,3), so I need to move away.\n\nMoving to (2,3) is safe, as we discussed.\n\nThen to (3,3), etc.\n\nI could move up or down from (1,3) to explore, but that might delay eating other food.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) move U to (1,4), then I am away from (4,3).\n\nBut (5,5) is up, so I could go towards (5,5).\n\nBut (4,3) is closer to current position.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a sequence.\n\nGoal: eat all three foods if possible.\n\nFood positions: (1,3), (4,3), (5,5)\n\nWith life span 10, I have time.\n\nEfficient path: from (3,3), move L to (2,3) on T0.\n\nT1: move L to (1,3) eat, now at (1,3) with body (2,3), length 2.\n\nT2: move R to (2,3)  // to go back, since (2,3) is tail, move to it, positions become head (2,3), tail (1,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nT3: move R to (3,3), positions head (3,3), tail (2,3)? After move: head to (3,3), tail to where head was, (2,3), so positions [(3,3),(2,3)]\n\nT4: move R to (4,3) eat, positions [(4,3),(3,3),(2,3)] length 3.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nNow, go to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), which is up and right from (4,3).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) not food, but I can go to (5,4) then (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,3), move U to (4,4) on T5.\n\nT5: move U to (4,4), no food, so head to (4,4), tail moves to (3,3)? Positions before: head (4,3), body (3,3), tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (4,4), new head (4,4). The body segments move: the segment after head moves to where head was, (4,3), and tail moves to where the previous segment was, (3,3)? Let's index.\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] head (4,3), segment1 (3,3), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4), the segment1 moves to (4,3), and tail moves to (3,3). So new positions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nT6: from (4,4), move R to (5,4), no food? (5,4) not food, head to (5,4), body moves: segment1 to (4,4), tail to (4,3), positions [(5,4),(4,4),(4,3)]\n\nT7: move U to (5,5) eat, since (5,5) has food. Head to (5,5), tail does not move, so positions [(5,5),(5,4),(4,4),(4,3)] length 4.\n\nAte all three foods by turn 7.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,5) from (4,3), but (5,5) is not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nFrom (4,3), I could move R to (5,3) on T5, then U to (5,4) on T6, then to (5,5) on T7, same as above, but (5,4) not food, so on T7 eat.\n\nIn above, I went via (4,4), which is fine.\n\nNow, are there any risks? With longer snake, need to avoid collisions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), I am at (5,5) with body around.\n\nBut grid has obstacles, so I need to find a path to survive.\n\nBut since I ate all food, I can just move safely.\n\nBut the game continues, I assume, but no more food? Only three foods, but new food might spawn? The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so probably only these foods, and after eating, I just survive, but to maximize score, I need to eat as much as possible, but if no more food, score is fixed.\n\nThe problem says \"maximize score by eating positive food\", and food has life span, so if no new food, score is number eaten.\n\nBut in this case, I can eat all three.\n\nIf I don't eat (1,3) first, I might not eat it, but I can.\n\nAnother option: the food at (1,3) is near the border, and with internal obstacles, but as long as I go early, it's fine.\n\nSuppose at turn 0 I move U to (3,4).\n\nThen T1: move R to (4,4)\n\nT2: move R to (5,4) or to (4,5), say to (5,4) to go to (5,5)\n\nT2: from (4,4) move R to (5,4)\n\nThen T3: move U to (5,5) eat, snake now length 2: [(5,5),(5,4)]\n\nThen I need to go to (4,3) and (1,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), from (5,5), I can move down to (5,4)? But (5,4) is tail.\n\nMove D to (5,4)? But (5,4) is current tail position.\n\nHead at (5,5), move D to (5,4), which is tail.\n\nAfter move, head to (5,4), tail moves to where? If no food, tail moves to previous head position (5,5)? Positions before: head (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\nMove head to (5,4), new head (5,4). Tail moves to (5,5), so positions [(5,4),(5,5)]\n\nThen I can move from there to (5,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (4,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), move L to (4,4), then down to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,4) to (4,3) is down.\n\nT4: from (5,4) move L to (4,4), positions head (4,4), tail (5,5)? After move: head to (4,4), tail to (5,4)? Positions before: head (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (4,4), new head (4,4). Tail moves to where head was, (5,4). So positions [(4,4),(5,4)]\n\nT5: move D to (4,3) eat, positions [(4,3),(4,4),(5,4)] after growth.\n\nThen to (1,3), need to go left.\n\nFrom (4,3), move L to (3,3), but (3,3) might be free.\n\nT6: move L to (3,3), no food, positions head to (3,3), tail to (4,4)? Positions before: head (4,3), body (4,4), tail (5,4)\n\nMove head to (3,3), new head (3,3). Body moves: segment1 to (4,3), tail to (4,4). Positions [(3,3),(4,3),(4,4)]\n\nT7: move L to (2,3), positions head to (2,3), body to (3,3), tail to (4,3) or something. Before move: head (3,3), segment1 (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nMove head to (2,3), new head (2,3). Segment1 moves to (3,3), tail moves to (4,3). Positions [(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)]\n\nT8: move L to (1,3) eat, positions [(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)] after growth.\n\nAte (1,3) on T8, later than before.\n\nSimilarly, the first path ate all by T7.\n\nSo moving L first is better.\n\nBut in the first path, I ate (1,3) on T1, (4,3) on T4, (5,5) on T7.\n\nT7 for (5,5).\n\nIn the sequence: T4 ate (4,3), then T5 to (4,4), T6 to (5,4)? Earlier: after T4 at (4,3) with body, then T5 move U to (4,4), T6 move R to (5,4), T7 move U to (5,5) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in T5, I moved to (4,4), but (4,4) is not necessary; from (4,3), I could move directly R to (5,3) on T5.\n\nT5: from (4,3) move R to (5,3), no food, positions: before head (4,3), body (3,3), tail (2,3) or whatever.\n\nAfter T4: positions [(4,3),(3,3),(2,3)]\n\nT5: move R to (5,3), head to (5,3), body: segment1 to (4,3), tail to (3,3). Positions [(5,3),(4,3),(3,3)]\n\nT6: move U to (5,4), positions head to (5,4), body to (5,3), tail to (4,3). Positions [(5,4),(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nT7: move U to (5,5) eat, head to (5,5), tail stays, so positions [(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nSame as before, ate on T7.\n\nNow, all foods eaten.\n\nBut in the beginning, if I move to (1,3) first, it seems efficient.\n\nBut what about the direction constraint.\n\nAt turn 0, moving L is fine.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (1,3) might have tail reward danger if I eat it when adjacent to tail, but when I eat it, snake was length 1, no tail adjacent in a way that causes issue.\n\nTail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nBut when I move to (1,3), head is at (1,3), tail was at (2,3) before growth? Before eating, when I move to (1,3), head is moving to (1,3), which has food, and tail is at (2,3), which is adjacent? (2,3) is left of (1,3)? Positions: from (2,3) to (1,3), if I move left, (1,3) is left of (2,3), so adjacent.\n\nAnd tail is at (2,3), which has food? The food is at (1,3), not at (2,3). The tail cell is (2,3), which does not have food; the food is at the head cell when I eat.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (1,3), head will be at (1,3), tail at (2,3), so they are adjacent, but the tail cell (2,3) does not have food; the food is at (1,3), which is head cell.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nOnly if the tail cell has food, but here it doesn't.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, in other cases.\n\nTherefore, moving L on turn 0 to go to (1,3) is good.\n\nThen the sequence I have.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe state is turn t1=0, and I need to output for turn 0,1,2,... at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output the first few turns.\n\nBut to be precise, let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: move L to (1,3) eat\n\nThen turn 2: I need to move away. I can move R to (2,3), which is back, or U or D.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I moved R to (2,3) to go towards (4,3).\n\nI could move U or D, but that might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (1,4) on turn 2, then I am going up, away from other food.\n\nThen to go to (4,3), I need to come down, which takes more turns.\n\nSo moving R to (2,3) is better to stay on the row.\n\nSimilarly, after that, to (3,3), then (4,3).\n\nThen to (5,5).\n\nNow for the output, I need to specify actions.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 0.\n\nAlso, the format is for multiple turns.\n\nNow, life span: all food has life span 10, so I have time, but to be safe, eat soon.\n\nBut (1,3) can be eaten on turn 1, (4,3) on turn 4, (5,5) on turn 7, all within 10 turns.\n\nNow, for the answer, I should provide actions for turn 0 to, say, turn 5 or more.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output for the turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it's \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nSo for t1=0, Turn 0: action, Turn 1: action, etc.\n\nI need to specify how many turns? At least 5, I think, but probably until I have a plan.\n\nSince the game continues, I can output for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 2, I have moves.\n\nLet's list the actions for the first 5 turns.\n\nTurn 0: move L\n\nTurn 1: move L (to eat at (1,3))\n\nThen turn 2: move R (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 3: move R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: move R (to (4,3) and eat)\n\nThen turn 5: move U (to (4,4) to go towards (5,5))\n\nIn turn 5, from (4,3), after eating, head at (4,3), direction R, I move U to (4,4).\n\nIs that allowed? Direction is R, moving U is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns ahead, I can output up to turn 5.\n\nt1=0, so turns 0 to 5.\n\nBut turn 5 action is from position after turn 4.\n\nNow, in turn 2, I move R to (2,3), which was the previous position, but as we said, safe.\n\nTo avoid moving to tail, I could move U or D on turn 2, but that might delay.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) move U to (1,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3, from (1,4) move R to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\n(2,4) is internal wall, so cannot move to (2,4).\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), R to (2,4) but wall, so cannot R.\n\nL to (0,4) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf move U to (1,5), then I am stuck going up or down on x=1.\n\nThen to go to (4,3), I need to go down to (1,3) but (1,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (1,2) on turn 2.\n\nThen from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) obstacle, L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2)\n\nSo can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2) or D but D to (1,1) wall, so only U or R.\n\nIf move U to (1,3), back to where I was, but now (1,3) has no food, and tail might be there or not.\n\nAfter turn 1, snake at [(1,3),(2,3)]\n\nIf on turn 2 move D to (1,2), positions: head to (1,2), tail to (1,3)? Before move: head (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (1,2), new head (1,2). Tail moves to (1,3). Positions [(1,2),(1,3)]\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move R to (2,2), for example.\n\nBut then I am at (2,2), not on the row to (4,3).\n\nSo it takes more turns to reach (4,3).\n\nTherefore, moving R to (2,3) on turn 2 is the most efficient to keep moving towards other food.\n\nAnd it is safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R  // to eat (4,3)\n\nThen for turn 5, from (4,3), move U to go towards (5,5), so U.\n\nTo output 5 turns: turns 0 to 4 or 0 to 5?\n\nt1=0, think 5+ turns ahead, so probably output for 5 actions or more.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can do multiple.\n\nSince turn 4 I eat, and turn 5 I move U.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have defined moves.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes, but I need to specify action based on current, but since I plan, it should be ok.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nFirst, confirm the grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,1),(2,4),(1,1),(1,6),(6,4)\n\nIn my moves, when I go to (2,3), (1,3), (3,3), (4,3), all safe.\n\nThen to (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), all within bounds and not walls.\n\n(5,4) not wall, (5,5) not.\n\nInternal walls don't affect.\n\nSo good.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n\nTurn 0: L\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nAnd for thinking ahead, turn 5: U\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 4 or 5.\n\nSince think 5+ turns, output 5 actions: turns 0 to 4.\n\nt1=0, turn 0 to turn 4 is 5 turns: turn 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nYes.\n\nThen for turn 5, I can include or not, but the format might expect multiple.\n\nI think output for turns 0 to 4 is fine.\n\nTo be complete, up to turn 4, since turn 4 I eat the second food.\n\nBut let's see.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (1,3) first, as it is the closest accessible food given the current head direction (left). After eating (1,3), I will navigate towards (4,3) and then (5,5), avoiding walls, obstacles, and potential collisions. Since the snake is short initially, risks are minimal, but I must consider future growth and path efficiency.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (1,3) is 2 moves away and can be eaten on turn 1. It has a life span of 10, so eating it early avoids missing it if the snake gets longer and movement becomes restricted near obstacles.\n  - (4,3) is 3-4 moves away (depending on path) and can be eaten by turn 4.\n  - (5,5) is 6-7 moves away and can be eaten by turn 7, well within its life span of 10.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is left (L), so on turn 0, I cannot move right (R) due to no instant reverse. Moves are limited to U, D, or L.\n  - After eating, the snake grows, so I must avoid future body collisions. However, moving to the tail cell is safe as the tail moves forward.\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - No negative food exists, so all food is beneficial.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here; when eating (1,3), the tail cell (2,3) has no food, so no issue.\n  - Obstacles at (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), and (6,4) must be avoided. Paths are chosen to steer clear.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turns 0-1**: Move left to eat (1,3) efficiently.\n  - **Turns 2-4**: Move right to eat (4,3), using the same row for efficiency.\n  - **Turns 5+**: Move up toward (5,5) to eat it by turn 7.\n  - All food will be eaten within 7 turns, maximizing score with minimal risk.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 0 to 5+):\n- **Turn 0**: Move L to (2,3). This avoids instant reverse and starts the path to (1,3). No food eaten, snake remains length 1.\n- **Turn 1**: Move L to (1,3) and eat the food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 2: positions [(1,3), (2,3)]. Head direction is now L.\n- **Turn 2**: Move R to (2,3). This moves to the tail cell, which is safe (tail will move to (1,3)). Positions: head (2,3), tail (1,3). Head direction is now R.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,3). Positions: head (3,3), tail (2,3). Head direction R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move R to (4,3) and eat the food (+1 score). Snake grows to length 3: positions [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]. Head direction R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move U to (4,4) to start pathing toward (5,5). Positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (3,3). Head direction U.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats (1,3) on turn 1 and (4,3) on turn 4, minimizing turns to first two foods. (5,5) will be eaten by turn 7 via (4,4) → (5,4) → (5,5).\n- **Survival Focus**: Avoids obstacles (e.g., (2,4) is never approached) and leverages open paths. After turn 5, the snake can continue to (5,5) safely.\n- **Long-term**: By eating all food quickly, the snake remains short enough to navigate the grid. With no more food, the game can end with a score of 3, or new food may spawn for continued play.\n\nThis plan eats all food within 7 turns with no collision or wall risks, maximizing score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L \\\\\nTurn 1: L \\\\\nTurn 2: R \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: R \\\\\nTurn 5: U\n}",
