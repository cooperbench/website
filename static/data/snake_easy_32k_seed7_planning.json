        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn t1 = 0.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nThe snake is at position [(3,3)], which means it's just the head since there's only one segment. So the snake has length 1.\n\nThe head direction is left, so it's facing L (left).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (5,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (5,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, and life span starts at 10, decreasing each turn.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, there's no body to worry about collisions except walls and itself, but with one segment, self-collision isn't possible unless it tries to eat food adjacent to tail, but there is no tail yet.\n\nThe snake positions are [(3,3)], so head is at (3,3), and no other segments, so tail is the same as head for now. But when it eats food, it will grow.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but since head direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R. So I can move U, D, or L, but not R because that would be opposite.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So valid moves from current position: L (continue left), U (up), D (down). Not R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls are at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake at (3,3).\n\nFood at: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6)\n\n(5,3) is at the same y as snake, but x=5, snake at x=3,y=3.\n\nSince snake is at (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3), which is within bounds, x=2>0, so not wall.\n\nMoving up to (3,4), y=4<7, not wall.\n\nMoving down to (3,2), y=2>0, not wall.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible actions for turn t1=0.\n\nSince head direction is L, actions: U, D, L (not R).\n\nNow, after moving, the direction will be set to the new move.\n\nAlso, for food: life span decreases each turn, including current, so after this turn, life span of all food decreases to 9, since starting at 10.\n\nBut since we're moving, we might eat food this turn or later.\n\nEating food: if head moves to a food cell, and it's positive, we eat it, length increases by 1, and we get +1 score. Negative food would decrease score, but all here are positive.\n\nAlso, special case: food under snake body, but currently no body, so not an issue.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because new tail grows and collides. But currently, tail is same as head, so if there was food under, but no food under snake now, since snake at (3,3) and food elsewhere.\n\nSo for now, no immediate dangers.\n\nNow, let's think about paths to food.\n\nClosest food: (1,1) is at distance |3-1| + |3-1| = 2+2=4? Manhattan distance.\n\n(3,3) to (1,1): dx=2, dy=2, dist=4.\n\n(5,3): dx=2, dy=0, dist=2.\n\n(5,6): dx=2, dy=3, dist=5.\n\nSo (5,3) is closest at dist 2.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), and snake at (3,3), so to reach it, I need to move right, but current direction is L, and I cannot move R this turn because instant reverse is not allowed.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to (5,3) this turn.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- D: to (3,2)\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then head is at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,3) or U to (2,4) or D to (2,2), but not R back to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) is one step from (1,1), but (1,1) is down and left from (1,3)? (1,3) to (1,1) is down 2 steps? y from 3 to 1, dy=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (3,4), then I can go towards (5,6) or something.\n\nOr D to (3,2), but (3,2) is close to obstacle? Obstacle at (5,2), not immediate.\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake will have a body if it eats food.\n\nBut initially, no body.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nLet me make a small grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2) is wall.\n\nSnake: (3,3)\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6)\n\nNow, from (3,3), with direction L.\n\nMove options:\n\n1. Move L to (2,3): now head at (2,3), direction L. Snake positions: [(2,3)] since no body yet, but after move, if no eat, positions are new head only? When we move, if we don't eat, the snake moves, so for length 1, moving to a new position, the tail moves away, so new position is just the new head. Since no body, after moving to (2,3), snake is [(2,3)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut if we eat food, we grow, so positions include new head and old position becomes body.\n\nBut for now, no food at (2,3), (3,4), or (3,2), so moving to any of them doesn't eat food.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), not adjacent to (3,3), so no food eaten this turn.\n\nSo after move, snake remains length 1 at new position.\n\nLife span of food decreases to 9.\n\nNow, for turn t1+1, etc.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nGoal: eat positive food, avoid risks, think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, since all food has life span 10, and we're at turn 0, it will disappear after 10 turns, but we have time.\n\nBut we should eat soon to grow and be able to reach other food.\n\nNow, let's consider paths to each food.\n\nFirst, to (5,3): from (3,3), I need to go right, but I can't this turn because direction L, no reverse.\n\nSo I must move away first or change direction.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) or D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then direction U, and I can then move R to (4,4) or U to (3,5) or L to (2,4), not D (down) since opposite.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (5,4), then to (5,3) down, but (5,3) is at y=3, so from (5,4) to (5,3) is down, possible.\n\nBut that takes multiple turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,2), direction D, then I can move R to (4,2) or D to (3,1) or L to (2,2), not U.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, wall. So cannot go to (5,2).\n\nSo from (3,2), if I go R to (4,2), then from (4,2), I can only go U to (4,3) or D to (4,1) or R to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so not possible. (4,2) to (5,2) is right, but (5,2) wall, so invalid move.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) to (4,3) up, or (4,1) down.\n\nThen to (5,3): from (4,2), go up to (4,3), then right to (5,3).\n\nPossible.\n\nBut (4,3) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3) first, then from (2,3), I can go L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2), not R.\n\nThen to (5,3) from (2,3) is harder, since I need to go right, but I can't directly, so I have to go up or down first, then right.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) go U to (2,4), then R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then D to (4,3)? Messy.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nThe fastest way to (5,3) is to go right as soon as possible.\n\nSince I can't go right this turn, I need to change direction to a perpendicular one, then next turn I can go right.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,4), direction U, then on next turn, I can move R to (4,4) since not opposite (U to R is not opposite, opposite would be D).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4), etc.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (5,3) is not adjacent, so I need to go to (4,3) or (5,4) first.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), so from (4,4) go D to (4,3), then R to (5,3).\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,2), direction D, then next turn I can move R to (4,2), then from (4,2) go U to (4,3), then R to (5,3).\n\nBut from (4,2) to (4,3) is up, possible.\n\nNow, (4,2) to (4,3) is fine, but (4,2) is at y=2, and obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is not obstacle, only (5,2) is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) should be free.\n\nNow, another food at (1,1), which is left and down.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move L to (2,3), then I can go L to (1,3), then D to (1,2), then D to (1,1)? (1,3) to (1,1) is down two steps, but (1,2) might be free.\n\n(1,3) to (1,2) down, then (1,2) to (1,1) down.\n\nBut (1,1) is food, so when head moves to (1,1), it eats.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3), I could go D to (2,2), then L to (1,2), then D to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is corner, might be risky if snake grows.\n\nBut for now, snake short.\n\nAlso, food at (5,6), which is up and right.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), then R to (4,5), R to (5,5), then D to (5,6)? (5,6) is at y=6, so from (5,5) to (5,6) is up, not down.\n\ny=6 is below y=5? Let's define coordinates.\n\nAssume y increases up, like standard Cartesian, or y increases down like matrix?\n\nThe problem says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so U is y+1, which is up if y increases up, but in grids, often y increases down, but here U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n\nThe walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo U (x,y+1) means increasing y, so moving up.\n\nD (x,y-1) down, decreasing y.\n\nL (x-1,y) left, R (x+1,y) right.\n\nSo (3,3) to (5,6): dx=2, dy=3, since (5,6) is up and right.\n\ny from 3 to 6, dy=3 up.\n\nSo from (3,3), to reach (5,6), I need to go up and right.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is down and left.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to prioritize long-term survival and score.\n\nSince snake is short, eating one food will make it length 2, then I need to avoid self-collision.\n\nAlso, with internal obstacle, need to be careful.\n\nNow, let's consider the options for turn 0.\n\nMove L to (2,3):\n\nThen snake at (2,3), direction L.\n\nFood at (1,1) is close, at dist |2-1| + |3-1| =1+2=3? (2,3) to (1,1) dx=1, dy=2, dist=3.\n\nI can go to (1,3) next, then to (1,2) or (1,1) directly if possible, but (1,3) to (1,1) not adjacent, so (1,3) to (1,2) down, then (1,2) to (1,1) down.\n\nOr from (2,3) go D to (2,2), then L to (1,2), then D to (1,1).\n\nBoth take 3 moves from (2,3), but since I moved to (2,3) on turn 0, turn 1 at (2,3), turn 2 to say (1,3), turn 3 to (1,2), turn 4 to (1,1), so eat at turn 4.\n\nFrom turn 0 move L, turn 1 at (2,3), turn 2 move D to (2,2), turn 3 move L to (1,2), turn 4 move D to (1,1), eat.\n\nSimilarly, other ways.\n\nBut (1,1) is near corner, after eating, snake length 2, head at (1,1), tail at previous position, which would be (1,2) if I came from above.\n\nWhen I eat at (1,1), if I moved from (1,2) to (1,1), then snake positions: head at (1,1), body at (1,2), so tail at (1,2).\n\nThen I can move, but in corner, limited moves.\n\nFor example, from (1,1), I can only move U to (1,2) or R to (2,1), not D (y=0 wall) or L (x=0 wall? x=0 is wall, so at (1,1), x=1>0, y=1>0, so possible moves: U to (1,2), R to (2,1), D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, so invalid, L to (0,1) x=0 wall invalid. So only U or R.\n\nBut if body is at (1,2), moving U to (1,2) would collide with body, since head touches body segment.\n\nSo I must move R to (2,1).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut it might be risky.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,3), which is more central.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3, and obstacle at (5,2), so below is wall, but (5,3) is fine.\n\nNow, to reach (5,3) from (3,3), since I can't go directly right.\n\nOption: move U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1: at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen I can move R to (4,4) (not D, opposite), or U to (3,5), or L to (2,4).\n\nBest to go towards food, so move R to (4,4).\n\nTurn 2: at (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen I can move R to (5,4), or U to (4,5), or D to (4,3), not L.\n\nNow, (5,4) is not food, food at (5,3), so from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), then R to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (4,3) on turn 2, then turn 3 at (4,3), then move R to (5,3) on turn 3, eat.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3) eat.\n\nSo eat at turn 3.\n\nIf on turn 2 I move R to (5,4) instead, then turn 3 at (5,4), then I need to move D to (5,3) to eat, but (5,3) is below, so move D, but direction from (5,4) to (5,3) is D, which is down.\n\nThen turn 4 eat at (5,3), slower.\n\nSo better to go to (4,3) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D from (3,3) on turn 0 to (3,2).\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 1: at (3,2), I can move R to (4,2) (not U, opposite), or D to (3,1), or L to (2,2).\n\nMove R to (4,2).\n\nTurn 2: at (4,2), direction R.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid, or D to (4,1), or L to (3,2) but opposite? Direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L to (3,2).\n\nValid moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2) but wall, invalid, so only U or D.\n\nMove U to (4,3).\n\nTurn 3: at (4,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen move R to (5,3) eat.\n\nSequence: turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 R to (4,2), turn 2 U to (4,3), turn 3 R to (5,3) eat. Same as before, turn 3 eat.\n\nIf I had moved L on turn 0 to (2,3), then to (5,3) is farther.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) move U to (2,4) turn 1, then R to (3,4) turn 2, then R to (4,4) turn 3, then D to (4,3) turn 4, then R to (5,3) turn 5 eat. Slower, turn 5.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly to (1,1) from (2,3): turn 0 L to (2,3), turn 1 L to (1,3), turn 2 D to (1,2), turn 3 D to (1,1) eat. Turn 3 eat.\n\nBut as said, (1,1) corner might be risky after eating.\n\nNow, food at (5,6) is farther.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4) turn 0, then U to (3,5) turn 1, then U to (3,6) turn 2, then R to (4,6) turn 3, R to (5,6) turn 4? (5,6) is food, so at turn 4 if I go directly.\n\n(3,6) to (5,6) not adjacent, so from (3,6) move R to (4,6), then to (5,6).\n\nEat at turn 4.\n\nBut (5,6) is near top, y=6, below y=7 wall.\n\nAfter eating, snake length 2, head at (5,6), tail at (4,6) or wherever.\n\nThen I can move, but need to avoid walls.\n\nNow, comparing the foods:\n\n- (5,3) can be reached in 3 turns from start by going U then R then D then R, but that's 4 moves? Turn 0 move, position after turn 0.\n\nAfter turn 0 move, we are at new position at start of turn 1.\n\nTurn t1=0, I choose action, then snake moves to new cell, and if food there, eat.\n\nIn this case, no food at possible moves, so after action, no eat, snake at new position.\n\nThen turn t1+1=1, I choose next action, etc.\n\nTo eat at turn T, I move to food cell on that turn.\n\nFor (5,3):\n\nIf I go via up: turn 0 move U to (3,4), no eat\n\nTurn 1 move R to (4,4), no eat\n\nTurn 2 move D to (4,3), no eat? (4,3) is not food, food at (5,3)\n\nTurn 3 move R to (5,3), eat at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, via down: turn 0 move D to (3,2), no eat\n\nTurn 1 move R to (4,2), no eat\n\nTurn 2 move U to (4,3), no eat\n\nTurn 3 move R to (5,3), eat at turn 3.\n\nFor (1,1) if I go left: turn 0 move L to (2,3), no eat\n\nTurn 1 move L to (1,3), no eat\n\nTurn 2 move D to (1,2), no eat\n\nTurn 3 move D to (1,1), eat at turn 3.\n\nFor (5,6): turn 0 move U to (3,4), no eat\n\nTurn 1 move U to (3,5), no eat\n\nTurn 2 move U to (3,6), no eat\n\nTurn 3 move R to (4,6), no eat\n\nTurn 4 move R to (5,6), eat at turn 4.\n\nSo (5,3) and (1,1) can be eaten at turn 3, (5,6) at turn 4.\n\nBut (1,1) in corner might be less desirable.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,3), I can go to other food.\n\nMoreover, there is internal obstacle at (5,2), which might affect movements around (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is above (5,2) obstacle, so moving down from (5,3) to (5,2) is invalid, but I can move left, right, or up.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3) on turn 3, snake will have head at (5,3), and body at previous position, which is (4,3) if I came from left.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), or D but (5,2) wall, invalid, or L to (4,3), but body at (4,3), so moving L to (4,3) would collide, or R to (6,3) but x=6? x=7 wall, x=6 is within, x=6<7, so (6,3) is possible.\n\nx from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle only (5,2), so (6,3) is free.\n\nSo from (5,3), after eating, moves: U to (5,4), R to (6,3), or D invalid, L invalid because body at (4,3).\n\nSo must go U or R.\n\nIf go U to (5,4), then head at (5,4), body at (5,3) and (4,3)? Snake positions: after eating at turn 3, head to (5,3), and since it grew, body segment at (4,3), so positions: [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nThen moving U to (5,4), new head (5,4), tail moves away, so positions: [(5,4), (5,3)] or depending on direction.\n\nWhen snake moves, if not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so body segments shift.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3)\n\nThen if move U to (5,4), new head (5,4), the body (4,3) becomes tail and moves? No, when moving, the tail moves to the next position or something.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, new body segment added at previous tail position, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3, before move, snake at (4,3) for turn 2? Let's clarify.\n\nAt start turn 3, before action, snake positions depend on previous.\n\nIn the sequence for (5,3) via up:\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), move U to (3,4), no eat, so after move, snake at [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1: at (3,4), move R to (4,4), no eat, snake at [(4,4)]\n\nTurn 2: at (4,4), move D to (4,3), no eat, snake at [(4,3)]\n\nTurn 3: at (4,3), move R to (5,3), now (5,3) has food, so eat, snake grows, so new head (5,3), body segment added at previous position? After eating, the head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nPrevious tail position: before move, snake was at [(4,3)] single segment, so tail was (4,3). After moving head to (5,3) and eating, new body segment added at (4,3), so snake now: head (5,3), body (4,3), so positions [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nYes.\n\nThen from here, turn 4: I need to move. Possible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), R to (6,3), D to (5,2) invalid (wall), L to (4,3) but body at (4,3), so collision if move L.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nSay move U to (5,4), then no eat (no food there), snake moves: head to (5,4), tail (4,3) moves away, so new positions: [(5,4), (5,3)]? When moving, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from [(5,3), (4,3)] move U: head to (5,4), body (5,3) moves to where head was? The body segment that was at (5,3) moves to the new position? Let's index.\n\nPositions: segment 0: head at (5,3), segment 1: body at (4,3)\n\nAfter moving head U to (5,4), the new head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, so to (5,3). But (5,3) was head position, now it becomes body.\n\nThen tail was (4,3), which is removed since no growth.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,4), body at (5,3), so [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (6,3), head to (6,3), body to (5,3), so [(6,3), (5,3)]\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food, like (5,6) or (1,1), but (1,1) far.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is up.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go U to (5,5), then to (5,6), but (5,6) has food.\n\nIf I am at (5,4) after turn 4, then turn 5 move U to (5,5), no food, snake to [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 6 move U to (5,6), eat, since food there.\n\nThen grow to length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved R to (6,3), then from (6,3) I can go U to (6,4), etc., to (5,6) might take longer.\n\nBut (5,6) life span 10, at turn 0, after 4 turns to eat (5,3), then 2 more to (5,6), turn 6 eat, life span was 10, decreased to 10-6=4, still available.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 10, at turn 6, 10-6=4, still there.\n\nBut from (5,6) to (1,1) is far.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 decision.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) on turn 0, I can eat (1,1) at turn 3, but then stuck in corner with length 2.\n\nAfter eating (1,1) at turn 3, positions: head (1,1), body at (1,2) if came from above.\n\nThen moves: U to (1,2) but body there, collision, or R to (2,1), or D invalid, L invalid.\n\nSo only R to (2,1).\n\nThen snake to [(2,1), (1,1)]? After move.\n\nTurn 3: move to (1,1) eat, so head (1,1), body added at previous tail. Before move, snake at (1,2) single? Sequence for (1,1):\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), snake at [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3), snake at [(1,3)] (no eat, since no food at (1,3))\n\nTurn 2: move D to (1,2), snake at [(1,2)] no eat\n\nTurn 3: move D to (1,1), eat, so head to (1,1), new body at previous tail position (1,2), so snake [(1,1), (1,2)]\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (2,1) (only choice, since U to (1,2) body, collision, D invalid, L invalid), so move R to (2,1), no eat, snake moves: head to (2,1), body to (1,1), so [(2,1), (1,1)]\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), R to (3,1), D to (2,0) invalid, so U or R.\n\nBut to reach other food, need to go right or up.\n\nBut (5,3) might be eaten by then or not.\n\nLife span: all food life 10, turn 0 to turn 4, life decreased by 4, to 6 left.\n\n(5,3) still there, I can go to it.\n\nBut from (2,1), to (5,3) is dist |2-5| + |1-3| =3+2=5, several turns.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) farther.\n\nBut I might miss (5,3) if I don't go soon, but life span 10, at turn 4, 6 left, I can reach.\n\nBut it might be less efficient.\n\nMoreover, with internal obstacle, going to (5,3) might be better.\n\nAnother point: tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently no issue, but later when snake longer, if food under tail, but now no.\n\nBut in the corner, after eating (1,1), I had to move to (2,1), which is fine, but the area might be cramped.\n\nWhereas (5,3) is more open.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is near top.\n\nBut (5,3) seems central.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,6), which I can go after.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating one food, I need to eat more.\n\nSince all food positive, I should eat all if possible.\n\nBut life span: all have life 10, so if I eat (5,3) at turn 3, then I can go to (5,6) and eat at turn 6, as above.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go to (1,1), but (1,1) at turn 6, life 10-6=4, and dist from (5,6) to (1,1) is |5-1| + |6-1| =4+5=9, which takes 9 turns, but life only 4 left, so by the time I reach, it might disappear.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, after eating (5,6), life of (1,1) is 10-6=4, so it disappears at turn 10 (since life span decreases each turn including current? Life span: at turn t, food has life N, decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears.\n\nAt turn t, food has life_span L, then after k turns, at turn t+k, life_span is L - k.\n\nIt disappears when life_span <=0.\n\nAt turn t, before any action, life_span is given, then after the turn, it decreases.\n\nIn state, at turn t, food has life_span, which decreases after the turn? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we process, the countdown decreases by one for that turn.\n\nSo for example, at turn t=0, life_span=10, after turn 0, it becomes 9.\n\nAfter turn 1, 8, etc.\n\nIt disappears when life_span reaches 0.\n\nAfter k turns, at turn t+k, life_span = initial - k.\n\nIt is present as long as life_span >0.\n\nFor (1,1), at turn 0, life=10.\n\nAt turn 3, if I eat it, life=10-3=7>0, present.\n\nIf not, at turn 6, life=10-6=4>0, present.\n\nAt turn 10, life=0, disappears.\n\nNow, from (5,6) at turn 6, to (1,1), min dist 9, so I need 9 moves to reach, but at turn 6, life=4, so after 4 turns, at turn 10, life=0, disappears before I can reach if I start at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6 to turn 10 is 4 turns, so at turn 10, when I arrive, if I move to (1,1) on turn 10, but at turn 10, life_span=10-10=0, so it disappears, cannot eat.\n\nLife_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, before decrease, if life_span >0, food is there.\n\nAt the start of turn t, food is present if life_span >0.\n\nThen during the turn, if snake moves to it, it eats, and food consumed.\n\nThen after the turn, life_span decreases.\n\nIf life_span was 1 at start of turn, and not eaten, after turn it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nIf eaten, it is removed.\n\nSo for (1,1), at turn 0, life=10.\n\nAt turn 6, life=10-6=4, so present.\n\nAt turn 7, if not eaten, life=3, etc.\n\nAt turn 10, life=0, so not present.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be on the cell by turn 9 at latest.\n\nTurn 9: life=10-9=1, if I move to it on turn 9, I eat it before it disappears.\n\nIf on turn 10, life=0, not there.\n\nSo latest to eat is turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut (1,1) is far from (5,6).\n\nBack to planning.\n\nIf I eat (5,3) at turn 3, and (5,6) at turn 6, then at turn 6, (1,1) life=4, I can try to go to it.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (1,1): |5-1| + |6-1| =4+5=9 Manhattan, but with obstacles, might be more, but no obstacles in path except walls.\n\nShortest path 9 moves.\n\nAt turn 6, I need to reach by turn 9, so 3 turns, but 9>3, impossible to reach in 3 turns.\n\nTurn 6 to turn 9 is 3 turns: turn 7,8,9.\n\nIn 3 moves, I can cover dist 3, but (1,1) is dist 9, so cannot reach from (5,6) in 3 turns.\n\nThus, if I eat (5,3) and (5,6), I cannot eat (1,1) because it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (1,1) first, at turn 3, then from there to (5,3) or (5,6).\n\nAfter eating (1,1) at turn 3, at (1,1) with body (1,2), then move to (2,1) at turn 4.\n\nThen from (2,1), to (5,3): |2-5| + |1-3| =3+2=5, so min 5 moves.\n\nAt turn 4, (5,3) life=10-4=6, so I can reach by turn 9, since turn 4+5=9, life=10-9=1, can eat on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) life=10-4=6 at turn 4, dist to (5,6) from (2,1) is |2-5| + |1-6| =3+5=8, 8 moves, turn 4+8=12, but life=10-12= -2? At turn 12, life=10-12= -2, not present.\n\nEarliest eat at turn 12, but life at turn 12: start turn 12, life=10-12= -2? Life decreases each turn, at turn 0 start life=10, after turn 0, life=9.\n\nAt start of turn t, life_span = initial - t.\n\nFor (5,6), initial life=10, at start turn t, life=10-t.\n\nPresent if 10-t >0, i.e., t<10.\n\nCan eat on turn t if 10-t >=1, i.e., t<=9.\n\nSimilarly, disappear at turn 10.\n\nSo to eat (5,6), need to be on cell by turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,1) at turn 4, to (5,6) dist 8, need 8 moves, turn 4+8=12>9, cannot reach by turn 9.\n\nTurn 12 > 9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,1) to (5,3) dist 5, turn 4+5=9, can eat on turn 9.\n\nBut (5,6) cannot be reached from there in time.\n\nIf I eat (1,1) first, I can eat (5,3) later, but not (5,6).\n\nIf I eat (5,3) first, I can eat (5,6) later, but not (1,1).\n\n(5,6) can be eaten if I go directly.\n\nFor example, from start, go to (5,6) directly.\n\nTurn 0 move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1 move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2 move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 3 move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 4 move R to (5,6) eat at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4, (5,3) life=10-4=6, and (1,1) life=6.\n\nFrom (5,6), to (5,3): |5-5| + |6-3| =3, so min 3 moves.\n\nTurn 5 move D to (5,5), turn 6 move D to (5,4), turn 7 move D to (5,3) eat, turn 7.\n\nLife at turn 7: 10-7=3>0, can eat.\n\nThen from (5,3), to (1,1) dist |5-1| + |3-1| =4+2=6, turn 7+6=13, life of (1,1) at turn 13: 10-13= -3<0, not present, cannot eat.\n\nSo in all cases, I can eat only two foods, not all three, because (1,1) and (5,6) are far apart.\n\nI can choose which two to eat.\n\nNow, (1,1) is in corner, might be riskier for longer snake, but with length 2 or 3, it might be ok.\n\nBut also, after eating, I need to survive.\n\nMoreover, with internal obstacle at (5,2), but not directly affecting.\n\nNow, for maximizing score, I should eat as many as possible, but here max two.\n\nI can eat (5,3) and (5,6), or (1,1) and (5,3), or (1,1) and (5,6) but (1,1) and (5,6) are far, so I can eat both only if I eat one quickly and the other quickly, but (1,1) eat at turn 3, then to (5,6) dist from (2,1) to (5,6) is |2-5| + |1-6| =3+5=8, turn 4+8=12>9, cannot, as above.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (5,6) at turn 4, then to (1,1) dist 9, turn 4+9=13>9, cannot.\n\nSo only possible pairs are (1,1) and (5,3), or (5,3) and (5,6).\n\n(1,1) and (5,3) can be eaten: (1,1) at turn 3, (5,3) at turn 9.\n\nOr (5,3) at turn 3, (5,6) at turn 6.\n\nBoth give two points.\n\nNow, which is better? (5,3) and (5,6) are closer, so I can eat them faster, and be in a better position, while (1,1) is corner.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,3) and (5,6), snake longer, but grid has space.\n\nWhereas after eating (1,1), I am in corner.\n\nMoreover, there might be risks with the obstacle.\n\nBut for now, I think (5,3) and (5,6) is better.\n\nI could eat only one, but better to eat two.\n\nAnother option: since all food same value, no negative, I should aim for the closer ones or easier.\n\nBut (5,3) is reachable in 3 turns from start.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says to output actions from turn t1 onwards, but it doesn't specify how many turns to plan, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns or until eating.\n\nBut the output should be a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nThe format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"where each action\", but doesn't say how many, but I think I should provide a sequence for a few turns, say until I eat the first food or something.\n\nBut to maximize, I need to commit to a path.\n\nPerhaps I should choose to go for (5,3) first.\n\nThen to (5,6).\n\nSo from start, move U to (3,4) on turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1 move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2 move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3 move R to (5,3) eat\n\nThen from there, to go to (5,6), I need to move up.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), positions [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (5,4) (since D invalid, L body, R possible but U better for (5,6))\n\nMove U to (5,4), snake to [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,5), snake to [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6), eat, snake grows to [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nNow, after that, no more food, but I need to survive, but the problem is to maximize score, so after eating all possible, I should just avoid dying.\n\nBut here, after turn 6, I can move around.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think I should output until I have a plan.\n\nSince the food at (1,1) cannot be eaten, I ignore it.\n\nNow, for turn 0, action.\n\nI need to decide the first move.\n\nOptions: move U or D to set up for (5,3).\n\nMoving L to (2,3) would go towards (1,1), but I think (5,3) is better.\n\nAlso, moving D to (3,2) is similar to U for reaching (5,3), but with obstacle below.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), then to (4,2), but (4,2) has only two moves, U or D, since R to (5,2) wall, L opposite if direction D.\n\nIn that case, from (3,2) move R to (4,2), then from (4,2) only U to (4,3) or D to (4,1), so I go U to (4,3), same as before.\n\nBut (4,2) is near the obstacle, might be riskier if snake longer, but for now ok.\n\nBut moving U might be better because I can then go to (5,6) directly up.\n\nIf I move D, I go down, then to (5,3), then to (5,6) I need to go up, but from (5,3) I can go up.\n\nBut moving U first, I start going up earlier.\n\nIn terms of turns, similar for (5,3), but for (5,6), if I move U first, I am closer to (5,6).\n\nFor example, if I move U on turn 0, to (3,4), then I can go up to (3,5), etc., towards (5,6), but instead I go right to (4,4) to reach (5,3).\n\nBut I could go directly to (5,6) but slower.\n\nI think for efficiency, go to (5,3) first.\n\nNow, between moving U or D for turn 0.\n\nMoving D to (3,2): (3,2) is at y=2, and obstacle at (5,2), but not affecting directly.\n\nBut y=2 is closer to bottom, while U to (3,4) is higher.\n\nAlso, from (3,4), I can access more areas.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,3), at (5,3), moving U to (5,4) is fine.\n\nIf I were at (3,2), it might be closer to walls.\n\nBut not a big deal.\n\nI think moving U is symmetric, but since I want to go to (5,6) which is up, moving U first might be better.\n\nHead direction: current direction L, if I move U, direction changes to U.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think I'll go with move U on turn 0.\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nThen turn 1: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 4: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 5: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6: U to (5,6) eat\n\nNow, turn 6 eat (5,6), so at turn 6, I eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions from turn 0 onwards.\n\nThe answer should be for several turns.\n\nSince I thought 5+ turns ahead, I can output up to turn 6 or so.\n\nBut turn t1=0, so output Turn 0, Turn 1, ..., up to Turn 6.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can move safely.\n\nFor example, after turn 6 at (5,6), head at (5,6), body at (5,5) and (5,4)? After eating at (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body segments: previous head was (5,5), and before that (5,4), so body at (5,5) and (5,4).\n\nSnake: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nThen I can move, for example, R to (6,6), or L to (4,6), or D to (5,5) but body, collision, or U to (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible: R to (6,6), or L to (4,6).\n\nSay move R to (6,6), then to (6,5), etc., avoid walls.\n\nBut since no food, just survive.\n\nFor the sequence, I can stop after eating the foods.\n\nBut the output should include actions for the turns.\n\nNow, for turn 0, action U.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions.\n\nBut I need to confirm if on turn 2, moving D to (4,3) is safe.\n\n(4,3) is not wall, not body, should be fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body, but not.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nIf I move D on turn 0, similar, but then to reach (5,6) I need to go up later.\n\nFor example, turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 R to (4,2), turn 2 U to (4,3), turn 3 R to (5,3) eat, then turn 4 U to (5,4), etc., same as before to (5,6).\n\nBut from (4,2), I have to move U, which is fine.\n\nBut moving U first, I avoid the obstacle area.\n\n(5,2) obstacle, but (4,2) is ok.\n\nI think moving U is better.\n\nSo I'll go with U.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t1=0.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R (to eat (5,3))\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U (to eat (5,6))\n\nThen I can stop, or add more for survival.\n\nSince the grid is open, I can continue.\n\nFor example, after turn 6, at (5,6), move R to (6,6) on turn 7, etc.\n\nBut not necessary, I think up to eating is fine.\n\nThe problem says \"maximize score\", and after no food, score doesn't increase, so just survive.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two eats.\n\nTo think 5+ turns ahead, I have up to turn 6.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 6 is 7 turns.\n\nPerhaps output 5 actions or so.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nAnother option: I could go to (5,6) first, but it takes longer to eat first food.\n\nFor example, go to (5,6) in 4 turns, eat at turn 4, then to (5,3) in 3 turns, eat at turn 7.\n\nWhereas with (5,3) first, eat at turn 3 and turn 6.\n\nSlightly earlier.\n\nAnd (5,3) is closer initially.\n\nSo better.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle: at (5,2), which is below (5,3), but since I don't go down from (5,3), it's fine.\n\nAlso, when at (4,3), no issue.\n\nSo I think safe.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0, move U.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nThen to (5,6), turn 4: U, turn 5: U, turn 6: U\n\nIn turn 4,5,6 moving up from (5,3).\n\nAfter turn 3, at (5,3), move U to (5,4) turn 4, U to (5,5) turn 5, U to (5,6) turn 6.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write in the box.\n\nAlso, the action should be the direction.\n\nIn the format, it says \"U (up)\", etc.\n\nNow, I think I should include the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start writing.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while prioritizing long-term survival, the strategy focuses on efficiently reaching the closest food, (5,3), and then proceeding to (5,6), as both are reachable within their life spans and avoid the riskier corner position of (1,1). The food at (1,1) is too far to reach after eating the other foods, given its life span of 10 turns. Starting from the initial position (3,3) with direction left, the snake must avoid instant reversal (right is invalid on turn 0). Moving up (U) on turn 0 sets up a path to (5,3) in 3 turns and then to (5,6) by turn 6.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Turn-by-Turn Actions:** The sequence below ensures the snake eats (5,3) on turn 3 and (5,6) on turn 6, achieving a score of +2.\n- **Collision Avoidance:** \n  - No self-collision risks, as the snake is short (length 1 until turn 3) and movements are planned to avoid the body and walls.\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,2) is avoided by not moving down from (5,3).\n  - After eating, movements are chosen to steer clear of walls and body segments (e.g., from (5,3), only up or right are valid; up is chosen for efficiency).\n- **Food Life Spans:** \n  - (5,3) and (5,6) have life span 10 at turn 0. Life span decreases by 1 each turn, so:\n    - (5,3) is eaten on turn 3 (life span 7 at start of turn, >0).\n    - (5,6) is eaten on turn 6 (life span 4 at start of turn, >0).\n  - (1,1) cannot be eaten due to distance and life span constraints (dist 9 from (5,6) at turn 6; would require 9 moves, but life span 0 at turn 10).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead:** The plan covers 7 turns, ensuring the snake eats two foods and positions itself safely. After turn 6, the snake can move freely to survive, but no more food is reachable.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 0: Move U (up) to (3,4). This changes direction to up and avoids instant reversal. No food eaten.\n- Turn 1: Move R (right) to (4,4). Direction now right. No food eaten.\n- Turn 2: Move D (down) to (4,3). Direction now down. No food eaten.\n- Turn 3: Move R (right) to (5,3). Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 2). Snake positions: head at (5,3), body at (4,3).\n- Turn 4: Move U (up) to (5,4). Only valid moves are up or right (down is wall, left is body). Direction now up. No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (5,4), body at (5,3).\n- Turn 5: Move U (up) to (5,5). Direction up. No food eaten. Snake positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,4).\n- Turn 6: Move U (up) to (5,6). Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 3). Snake positions: head at (5,6), body at (5,5) and (5,4).\n\nAfter turn 6, the snake can move right to (6,6) or left to (4,6) to avoid walls and continue surviving, but no further food is available. This plan maximizes score with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 1: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 2: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 6: U (up)\n}",

The snake is at position [(3,4)], which means it's just the head since there's only one segment. The head direction is Up (U). Food items are:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 9\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 9\n\n- (5,6) with value 1, life span 9\n\n- (3,4) with value 1, life span 10\n\n(3,4) is where the snake is currently. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Since the snake has only one segment (just the head), if it moves away from (3,4), that cell becomes empty, and if it moves back, it could eat the food there. But since it's the head, moving away would leave the cell empty, and coming back later might allow eating it.\n\nThe snake positions are given as [(3,4)], so only one cell. That means the snake is of length 1 right now. So when it eats food, it will grow.\n\nNow, head direction is U, so it just moved up to (3,4). Since it's turn 1, and positions show (3,4), it must have started here or moved here.\n\nI need to think about the next moves. I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 columns and 8 rows, but walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No.\n\nBorder cells are walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), etc., all are walls. Playable cells are where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, I think? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, that would be 6x6, but let's confirm.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls for all y, y=0 and y=7 are walls for all x. So the grid has cells with x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but the border is walls, so snake can only be on (x,y) where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6. Similarly, food is placed within that, I assume.\n\nFood at (1,1): x=1,y=1, which is not border, since border is x=0 or x=7 etc. (1,1) has x=1, y=1, so it should be playable. Similarly, (5,3), (5,6), (3,4) all have x and y between 1 and 6 except (5,6): y=6, but y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so y from 1 to 6 should be fine. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=1 is bottom? Usually y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary. But since walls are at y=0 and y=7, the playable y should be from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly for x.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is within playable area.\n\nSnake at (3,4), head direction U.\n\nFood at (3,4) is under the snake head. Since the snake is only one segment, if it moves, it will leave (3,4), and if it comes back later, it can eat it, but only if the food is still there and life span allows.\n\nLife span: each food has life span decreasing each turn, including current turn? Life span is given, and decreases every turn.\n\nFor food at (3,4), life span 10, value 1. It's turn 1, so after this turn, life span decreases to 9, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, others have life span 9 at turn 1.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 1.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=1, so turn 1 action, then turn 2, etc., for at least 5 turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,4) with head direction U.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nRules: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn (turn 1).\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nIf I move U from (3,4), to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is within bounds? y=5, since y=6 is max playable? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is playable, not wall. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 to x=6.\n\n(3,4) to (3,5): U to (3,5)\n\nNo food at (3,5), so no eating, snake remains length 1.\n\nThen positions: head at (3,5), body was only head, so now snake is [(3,5)].\n\nBut when it moves, since no food eaten, the tail doesn't grow, so snake remains one segment.\n\nInitially length 1, eats food to grow.\n\nAfter move, new head position, and tail stays or moves? Since no food, tail doesn't grow, so the body segments follow.\n\nBut here, only one segment, so after moving to (3,5), snake is at [(3,5)], still length 1.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,4), or R to (4,4).\n\nNow, food at (3,4) is still there, but snake left, so it's on the grid.\n\nBut to eat it, snake needs to come back when it's free.\n\nNow, also, other food: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6).\n\n(5,3) is near the obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall, so (5,3) might be accessible, but (5,2) is wall, so snake can't go there.\n\n(5,6) is at y=6, which is playable.\n\nI need to think about risks.\n\nSince snake is short, no body collision risk yet.\n\nWalls and obstacles: need to avoid (5,2) and borders.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but since only one segment, tail is the head, but when moving, if head moves to a cell with food and it's the tail, but tail moves away, it might be ok, but let's see the rule.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nBut in this case, snake is length 1, so tail is the same as head. When it moves, if it eats food at the new position, it grows, so the tail stays or something.\n\nLet's clarify for length 1 snake.\n\nSuppose snake is at S, length 1. If it moves to a new cell with food, it eats, grows to length 2, head at new position, tail at previous position.\n\nIf it moves to a cell without food, it moves, head at new, no tail.\n\nBut for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food.\n\nFor length 1, tail is at same position, so head is always on the same cell as tail? No, positions: before move, head is at (3,4), which is also tail. After move, say to (3,5), if no food, tail disappears? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the previous tail cell, so snake shortens or stays same length? No.\n\nGrowth only when eating food.\n\nInitial state: snake positions [(3,4)], so one cell, length 1.\n\nWhen it moves to a new cell:\n\n- If new cell has no food, snake moves to new position, so now only the new cell, length 1.\n\n- If new cell has food, snake eats, grows, so now head at new cell, and tail at previous position, so length 2.\n\nIn this case, for the food at (3,4), it's under the snake. If the snake moves away, it leaves (3,4) empty, and food is there. If later the snake head moves back to (3,4), and the food is still there, it can eat it, but only if the body is not there, which it won't be since it moved away.\n\nBut when it moves back, if it eats, it grows, but since it's moving to (3,4), which was the previous position, but after moving away, the tail is gone.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nTurn 1: snake at (3,4), food at (3,4) with life span 10.\n\nIf on turn 1, I move to another cell, say (3,5), then:\n\n- Snake moves to (3,5)\n\n- Since no food at (3,5), snake remains length 1, so now positions [(3,5)]\n\n- Food at (3,4) is still there, life span decreases to 9 (since turn passed).\n\nThen, later, if snake moves back to (3,4), and food is there, it can eat it.\n\nBut when it moves to (3,4), it will be eating the food, so it grows to length 2, with head at (3,4) and tail at (3,5) or something.\n\nSequence:\n\nSuppose turn 1: move U to (3,5). No food, so snake now at [(3,5)], length 1. Food at (3,4) life span 9.\n\nTurn 2: if I move D to (3,4), but current direction is U, moving D is opposite, so cannot instant reverse. After moving U, new direction is U, so from (3,5), possible moves U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nD to (3,4) is opposite to current direction U, so not allowed on turn 2.\n\nRules: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction after move becomes the new direction.\n\nSo after moving U on turn 1, direction is U.\n\nOn turn 2, I cannot move D.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can move U, L, or R.\n\nIf I want to go back to (3,4), I have to do it later.\n\nFor example, move L or R first, then come back.\n\nBut food at (3,4) has life span 10 at turn 1, after turn 1 it becomes 9, then turn 2 becomes 8, and so on, so it will disappear after 10 turns from start.\n\nBut I need to plan actions.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating the food at (3,4) now, but how? Snake is on it, but to eat, I need to move away and come back.\n\nBut since it's the head, moving away doesn't immediately allow eating; I have to return.\n\nBut on the same turn, I can't eat it because I'm leaving.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:  \n1. The body moves away, and  \n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nFor the head position, if food is under head, I need to move the head away, then later move back when the cell is free.\n\nIn this case, for turn 1, I cannot eat the food at (3,4) because to eat, head needs to move onto it, but it's already on it. So I have to move away first.\n\nSo on turn 1, I must move to another cell, leaving the food.\n\nThen later, if I return, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nNow, other food positions: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6)\n\n(5,3) is near obstacle (5,2), which is a wall, so (5,3) might be accessible, but (5,2) is wall, so from (5,3), I can move U, D, L, R except to (5,2) or borders.\n\ny=3, so U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, so cannot, L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but x=6 is playable? x from 1 to 6, x=6 is playable, not wall, wall at x=0 and x=7.\n\nx=6, y=3 is within 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): y=6, which is playable, U to (5,7) but y=7 is wall, so cannot U, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6).\n\n(1,1): x=1,y=1, L to (0,1) wall, D to (1,0) wall, so can only move U to (1,2) or R to (2,1).\n\nNow, back to snake at (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible actions for turn 1: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5): no food, snake to (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,5), can move U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5). Cannot D.\n\n(3,6) has no food, (2,5) no, (4,5) no.\n\nIf I move L to (2,4) on turn 1: from (3,4) L to (2,4), no food there? Food is at (1,1), etc., not (2,4), so no eat, snake to (2,4), direction now L.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), direction L, can move L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3). Cannot R.\n\n(1,4) no food, (2,5) no, (2,3) no.\n\nIf move R to (4,4) on turn 1: to (4,4), no food, direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,4), direction R, can move R to (5,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3). Cannot L.\n\n(5,4) no food, (4,5) no, (4,3) no.\n\nNow, food at (5,3) is close to (4,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about getting food.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,4) has long life span, 10, so I can come back later.\n\nBut I should prioritize eating food to grow, but with long-term survival.\n\nSince snake is short, I can go for nearby food.\n\nFor example, (5,3) is at (5,3), which is two moves away if I go right and down, but from (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), if I move R to (4,4), then from there, I can move R to (5,4), or D to (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is far, (5,6) is also a bit far.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is up-right.\n\nI should consider the grid layout.\n\nLet me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: (1,1) to (6,6) except (5,2).\n\nFood at: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4)\n\nSnake at (3,4) head U.\n\nNow, life span: all food has life span 9 or 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I need to eat positive food.\n\nAll food here is value 1, positive.\n\nNo negative food mentioned.\n\nIn the list, all have value 1, so all positive.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,4), I can eat it by moving away and coming back.\n\nBut to come back, I need to be able to move to it without instant reverse issue.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,5), direction U, then I cannot move D immediately, so I need to go somewhere else and come back.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L or R, same thing.\n\nSince the grid is open, I can circle around.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (5,2), which might block some paths.\n\nAlso, (5,3) is next to the obstacle.\n\nNow, let's think about eating (5,3) first.\n\nFrom (3,4), move R to (4,4) on turn 1. Direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,4), direction R, I can move R to (5,4), or D to (4,3), or U to (4,5). Cannot L.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then at (4,3), which is adjacent to (5,3) food.\n\nThen on turn 3, from (4,3), direction D (since moved D), so I can move D to (4,2), but y=2, and (4,2) is not wall, but obstacle is at (5,2), not (4,2). (4,2) is playable? Walls only at borders and internal (5,2), so (4,2) is ok.\n\nFrom (4,3), after moving D, direction D, so can move L to (3,3), R to (5,3), U to (4,4), or D to (4,2).\n\nR to (5,3) is possible, and (5,3) has food, so if I move to (5,3) on turn 3, I eat the food, grow to length 2, with head at (5,3), tail at (4,3).\n\nThen life span of that food decreases, but I eat it, so it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake is longer, so collision risk.\n\nBut for now, length 1, no risk.\n\nLet's plan to go to (5,3).\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)  // from (3,4) to (4,4), no eat, snake at [(4,4)], direction R\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3)  // from (4,4) to (4,3), no food there, snake at [(4,3)], direction D\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3)  // to (5,3), has food, eat, grow to length 2, head at (5,3), tail at (4,3)\n\nNow, after eating, positions: head at (5,3), body at (4,3), so snake positions: [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nDirection after move: R (since moved right).\n\nNow, turn 4: from (5,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, so cannot. L to (4,3) but (4,3) is the tail.\n\nNow, moving to tail: since the tail will move, it might be ok, but need to see.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to (4,3), which is tail, and since no food there (food was at (5,3) eaten), so when I move to (4,3), the tail is there, but after move, head moves to (4,3), and tail moves away? Let's see.\n\nWhen snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the next segment or off.\n\nIn this case, snake: head at (5,3), tail at (4,3)\n\nIf I move L to (4,3), which is the tail position.\n\nSince I move to tail, and no food there, the head moves to (4,3), and since no food, the tail moves off, so the new snake is head at (4,3), and no tail? Positions: after moving to (4,3), the body was (5,3) and (4,3), head moves to (4,3), which is where tail was, but tail should move to where? In snake, when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the segment that was at (4,3) becomes the new tail or something.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo here, positions before move: head (5,3), body segment at (4,3)\n\nIf head moves to new position, say to (4,3) which is the tail position.\n\nIf head moves to (4,3), which is currently occupied by tail.\n\nThen, after move, head is at (4,3), and the body segment that was at (4,3) must move, but since it was the tail, and no growth, the tail disappears, so snake should be just at (4,3), length 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet me clarify snake movement.\n\nInitial: positions [H], length 1.\n\nAfter move to new cell without food: [new H], length 1.\n\nAfter move to new cell with food: [new H, old H], length 2.\n\nThen, for length 2 snake: positions [H, B] where B is body (tail).\n\nWhen moving:\n\n- If head moves to new cell without food: new head position, and tail moves off, so new positions [new H], since only one segment? No.\n\nWith two segments: positions [H, T]\n\nHead moves to new cell, say P.\n\nIf P has no food, then head moves to P, and the tail segment is removed, so the body is gone, and we have only head at P? That can't be right for snake game.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nIn snake game, when snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain. So the tail segment moves to where the second last was, and the old tail position is vacated.\n\nFor example, length 2: positions [H, T]\n\nAfter moving head to new position P (adjacent):\n\n- If P has no food, head moves to P, the body segment that was at H moves to where H was? No.\n\nThe segments: let's index them: segment 0 is head, segment 1 is tail.\n\nAfter move, new head at P, and segment 1 (tail) moves to the position where segment 0 was before move.\n\nSo new positions: [P, previous H]\n\nSince previous H is now the tail position.\n\nIf no food eaten, the snake length remains the same, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nIn this case, from [H, T], after move to P no food, new positions [P, H], but H was the head, now it's the tail, and T is gone.\n\nIn coordinates: suppose H at A, T at B.\n\nAfter move head to P, no food: new head at P, new tail at A (previous head position), and B is free.\n\nSo snake positions: [P, A]\n\nLength 2 still.\n\nThen if move again, from P to Q, no food, new head at Q, new tail at P, and A free.\n\nBack to our earlier point.\n\nIn turn 3, after moving to (5,3) and eating, snake is [ (5,3), (4,3) ] with (5,3) head, (4,3) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), direction R, possible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so cannot. L to (4,3).\n\nL to (4,3): (4,3) is the tail position.\n\nIf I move to (4,3), which is occupied by tail.\n\nAfter move, head moves to (4,3), and since no food there (assuming), the tail moves to the previous head position, which was (5,3). But (5,3) is where head was, so new positions: head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nBut (4,3) was tail, now head is there, and tail at (5,3).\n\nNo collision because tail moved.\n\nAnd no food at (4,3), so no grow.\n\nBut the cell (4,3) was occupied, but since tail moves, it's ok.\n\nThe rule says you can move to tail cell because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, it should be fine.\n\nBut in terms of position, after move, snake at [(4,3), (5,3)] with head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nDirection after move L.\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can go to other places.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate the food at (5,3) on turn 3.\n\nNow, what about the food at (3,4)? It's still there, life span decreasing.\n\nAlso, (5,6) and (1,1).\n\nBut let's see the full plan.\n\nAnother option: I could go for the food at (3,4) directly, but I can't eat it immediately.\n\nFor example, on turn 1, move U to (3,5), then later come back to (3,4).\n\nBut from (3,5), direction U, on turn 2, I can move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nSay move L to (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,5), can move L to (1,5), D to (2,4), U to (2,6), etc.\n\nThen to go back to (3,4), I need to go to (3,4) from, say, (2,4) or (4,4) or (3,3), but (3,3) not visited.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move R to (3,4), but only if direction allows.\n\nIt might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (5,6) is at (5,6), which is top-right, near wall.\n\ny=6, so U is not possible, wall.\n\nI should consider all food.\n\nBut let's think about the food under the snake.\n\nSince it's there, and life span 10, I can eat it later.\n\nBut to maximize, eating sooner might be better to grow and have more options, but with risk.\n\nSince snake is short, low risk.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 1, I move to a cell that allows me to come back to (3,4) soon.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,4) on turn 1. Direction L.\n\nThen turn 2, from (2,4), direction L, I can move L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3). Cannot R.\n\nNone of these are (3,4), so I need to go to (2,3) or (2,5) then to (3,4) later.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move R to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (3,4) has food.\n\nFrom (2,3), move R to (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen from (3,3), can move R to (4,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), etc.\n\nU to (3,4) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,5) on turn 2, then to (3,5), then to (3,4), but from (3,5) to (3,4) is D, which might be reverse if direction is U.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nPerhaps the fastest way to eat (3,4) is to move away and come back in two moves, but with direction constraint.\n\nFor example, turn 1: move R to (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4), but current direction is R, moving L is not opposite; opposite of R is L? Directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n\n\"Instant reverse\" means moving opposite to current direction.\n\nSo if current direction is R, moving L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, U and D opposites.\n\nSo from (4,4) direction R, I cannot move L to (3,4) because L is opposite to R.\n\nSimilarly, I can move U, D, or R.\n\nSo to go to (3,4), I need to change direction first.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,5), then from there, I can move L to (3,5) or something, but not directly to (3,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) move D to (4,3), then from (4,3) move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4) or something.\n\nBut it takes multiple turns.\n\nThe shortest way to eat (3,4) is to move to an adjacent cell, then on next turn move back, but I can't because of instant reverse.\n\nSo minimum two moves to eat it: move to one adjacent, then from there, since I changed direction, I can move back on a later turn, but not next.\n\nFor example, turn 1: move U to (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) or U to (3,6), not D.\n\nThen turn 3, from say (2,5), I can move D to (2,4), then turn 4 move R to (3,4).\n\nOr from (2,5) move R to (3,5), but (3,5) may not be free, etc.\n\nIt takes at least 3 turns to eat it: turn 1 move away, turn 2 move to another cell, turn 3 move back to (3,4).\n\nSimilarly for other directions.\n\nWhereas for (5,3), I can eat it in 3 turns as I thought earlier.\n\nIn 3 turns: turn 1 R to (4,4), turn 2 D to (4,3), turn 3 R to (5,3) eat.\n\nFor (3,4), it takes more turns to eat it.\n\nSo perhaps better to go for (5,3) first.\n\n(5,6) is also possible, but farther.\n\n(1,1) is farther.\n\nAnd (3,4) can be eaten later.\n\nSo let's go with that plan.\n\nBut after eating (5,3), I have a longer snake, and I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there's food at (5,6), which is close to (5,3).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), y=6, so from (5,3), I can go up.\n\nBut after turn 3, snake at (5,3) head, (4,3) tail, direction R.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), I can move R to (6,3) or U to (5,4) or L to (4,3) as before.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), no food, then snake moves to head (5,4), tail at (5,3)? Positions: before move head (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nMove head to (5,4), no food, so new head (5,4), new tail at (5,3) (previous head position), and (4,3) free.\n\nSo snake at [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), direction U, can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4). Cannot D.\n\n(5,5) no food, (4,4) no, (6,4) no.\n\nThen turn 6: from (5,5), move U to (5,6), but (5,6) has food, so eat, grow to length 3.\n\nHead at (5,6), tail at (5,4) or something.\n\nBefore move: head (5,5), tail (5,4)? Positions: after turn 5, if moved U to (5,5), no food, snake [ (5,5), (5,4) ]\n\nThen move U to (5,6), has food, eat, so new head (5,6), and since eat, tail doesn't move, so new segment at previous tail position? When eat, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at new position, and body includes the previous positions.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nFrom [ (5,5), (5,4) ], head at (5,5)\n\nMove to (5,6) with food: head moves to (5,6), and the tail stays, so new positions: [ (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) ]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen life span of (5,6) decreases, but eaten.\n\nSimilarly, I can plan to eat multiple food.\n\nBut back to turn 1.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,4) is being ignored, life span 10, so it will last until turn 10.\n\nI can eat it later.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5.\n\nSince t1=1, I need actions for turn 1,2,3,4,5,...\n\nLet's decide on a sequence.\n\nOne plan: go eat (5,3) first, then (5,6), then maybe (3,4) or (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is far.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,6), I can go to (3,4).\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother thing: the obstacle at (5,2) might block going down from (5,3), but I can go up.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a path.\n\nStart turn 1: move R to (4,4)  // direction R\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3)  // direction D\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3)  // eat food, grow to length 2, positions [(5,3), (4,3)], direction R\n\nNow turn 4: from (5,3), direction R, can move R to (6,3), U to (5,4), or L to (4,3) (tail, ok)\n\nBut if I move U to (5,4), no food, so snake to [(5,4), (5,3)]  // head (5,4), tail (5,3)\n\nDirection U\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4), direction U, move U to (5,5)  // no food, snake to [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nDirection U\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,6)  // eat food, grow to length 3, positions [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nBut turn 6 is beyond 5 turns, but I can include.\n\nFor the answer, I need at least 5 turns, so up to turn 5.\n\nt1=1, so turns 1 to 5.\n\nIn this sequence, by turn 5, I have eaten one food (at turn 3), and snake is at (5,5) or something.\n\nIn turn 5, after moving to (5,5), snake at [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nNo food eaten on turn 5.\n\nI could eat another food.\n\nFor example, after turn 3, instead of going up, I could go to (3,4) to eat the food there.\n\nFrom turn 3: snake at (5,3) head, (4,3) tail, direction R.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,3) but (4,3) is tail, move to it, no food, so new head at (4,3), new tail at (5,3), positions [(4,3), (5,3)], direction L.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,3), direction L, can move L to (3,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3) but R is opposite to L, cannot.\n\nIf move L to (3,3), no food, snake to [(3,3), (4,3)], direction L.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,3), can move L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), R to (4,3) but R opposite, cannot.\n\nU to (3,4): (3,4) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nBut turn 6.\n\nFor turn 5, I am at (3,3), not eating.\n\nTo eat (3,4) by turn 5, I need to be there on turn 4 or 5.\n\nFor example, alternative plan to eat (3,4) sooner.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)  // direction U\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5)  // direction R\n\nTurn 3: move D to (4,4)  // direction D, no food\n\nTurn 4: move L to (3,4)  // to (3,4), eat food, since food there, grow to length 2, head (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nBut on turn 4, I eat (3,4).\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4), direction L, can move L to (2,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3). Cannot R.\n\nNo food at those.\n\nSo I ate one food by turn 4.\n\nIn the first plan, I ate by turn 3.\n\nIn first plan, ate (5,3) on turn 3.\n\nIn this, ate (3,4) on turn 4.\n\nSlightly later.\n\nBut (5,3) and (3,4) both have value 1.\n\n(5,6) is also available.\n\nAnother plan: go directly to (5,6).\n\nFrom (3,4), turn 1 move R to (4,4)  // dir R\n\nTurn 2 move U to (4,5)  // dir U\n\nTurn 3 move U to (4,6)  // dir U, no food? (4,6) no\n\nThen turn 4 move R to (5,6)  // to (5,6), eat, grow.\n\nBut on turn 4.\n\nThen turn 5 from (5,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) to (5,6) is R, direction from U to R is not opposite, so ok.\n\nBut I ate on turn 4.\n\nWhereas with (5,3) I can eat on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is farther: from (3,4) to (1,1), need at least |3-1| + |4-1| = 2+3=5 moves, but with direction, might take more.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move L to (2,4)  // dir L\n\nTurn 2 move D to (2,3)  // dir D\n\nTurn 3 move D to (2,2)  // dir D\n\nTurn 4 move L to (1,2)  // dir L? From (2,2) move L to (1,2), direction L, but (1,2) no food\n\nThen turn 5 move D to (1,1)  // from (1,2) move D to (1,1), direction D, eat.\n\nBut on turn 5.\n\nAnd (1,1) might be risky if I go to border, but should be ok.\n\nBut takes longer.\n\nSo eating (5,3) on turn 3 seems efficient.\n\nNow, after that, I can go to (5,6) or to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has longer life span, 10, so it will last until turn 10, while others have life span 9, so disappear after turn 9? Life span decreases each turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 1, life span 10 for (3,4), so it exists for 10 turns: from turn 1 to turn 10, on turn 11 it disappears if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, life span 9 at turn 1, exists until turn 9.\n\nTurn 1: life span N, it decreases each turn, so after K turns, life span decreases by K.\n\nIt disappears when life span reaches 0? Or after life span turns.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor food at (3,4): life span 10 at turn 1, so at turn 1, it exists, after turn 1, life span 9; turn 2, life span 8; ... at turn 10, life span 0, disappears? When life span decreases to 0, it disappears at the end of the turn or before?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns, then gone.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, life span becomes L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears after that turn.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there during turn t, and after turn t, life span L-1.\n\nIf L=1, at turn t, it exists during turn t, after turn t, life span 0, disappears.\n\nFor (3,4): life span 10 at turn 1, so it exists from turn 1 to turn 10 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 1, life span 10, so during turn 1, it exists.\n\nAfter turn 1, life span decreases to 9.\n\nAt turn 2, life span 9, exists.\n\n...\n\nAt turn 10, life span 1, exists during turn 10.\n\nAfter turn 10, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not available on turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, for life span 9 at turn 1: at turn 1, life span 9, exists.\n\nAfter turn 1, life span 8.\n\n...\n\nAt turn 9, life span 1, exists.\n\nAfter turn 9, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSo (3,4) lasts until turn 10, others until turn 9.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nBut to eat early, grow early.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nI think going for (5,3) on turn 3 is good.\n\nThen for turn 4 and 5, I can head towards another food.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,3), snake at (5,3) head, (4,3) tail, direction R.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4) // no food, snake to head (5,4), tail (5,3), positions [(5,4), (5,3)], direction U\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,5) // no food, snake to [(5,5), (5,4)], direction U\n\nThen on turn 6, move U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut for turn 5, no eat.\n\nI could go to (3,4) from there, but it's farther.\n\nFrom (5,4), I could move L to (4,4) on turn 5, but direction U, moving L is not opposite, so possible.\n\n(4,4) no food.\n\nThen to (3,4) later.\n\nBut for now, with 5 turns, I can have eaten one food by turn 3.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,4), it's under the snake, and I need to output actions.\n\nBut in the state, food at (3,4) is listed, and snake is on it, but I have to move away first.\n\nIn the answer, I need to specify actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 1, since head is on (3,4) with food, but I cannot eat it because I need to move onto it, but it's already on, so must move away.\n\nSo for turn 1, I must move to U, L, or R.\n\nI think R to (4,4) is fine.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, to confirm the grid, are there any risks?\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,3), the cell (4,3) is tail, and if I move back, it's ok.\n\nBut in the sequence, I move U to (5,4), safe.\n\nThen to (5,5), safe.\n\n(5,5) is not wall, no obstacle.\n\nObstacle at (5,2), but I am at y=5, fine.\n\nAlso, borders: (5,5) is within 1-6.\n\nSo no immediate risk.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for turns 1 to, say, 5.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nt1=1, so turns 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 1: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 2: D (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 3: R (to (5,3), eat food)\n\nTurn 4: U (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (5,5))\n\nThen snake at (5,5) with body (5,4), and food at (5,6) can be eaten next.\n\nBut for turn 5, no action beyond, but I have 5 actions.\n\nI could include turn 6 to eat (5,6), but not necessary.\n\nAnother idea: after turn 3, I could go towards (3,4).\n\nBut from (5,3), to (3,4), it's two cells away: left and up.\n\nBut with direction.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3) move L to (4,3)  // to tail, no food, snake to [(4,3), (5,3)] head (4,3), tail (5,3), direction L\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)  // no food, snake to [(3,3), (4,3)], direction L\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (3,4) eat.\n\nBut on turn 5, at (3,3), not eating.\n\nIn this case, I didn't eat a second food by turn 5.\n\nIn the first sequence, I only ate one by turn 3.\n\nBut I can't eat two by turn 5 easily.\n\nFor example, if I go directly to (5,6) and eat on turn 4, then turn 5 somewhere.\n\nBut (5,6) eat on turn 4.\n\nSequence: turn 1 R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2 U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3 U to (4,6)  // no food\n\nTurn 4 R to (5,6)  // eat, grow to length 2\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,6) head, tail at (4,6), direction R (since moved right)\n\nPossible moves: from (5,6), y=6, so U to (5,7) wall, cannot; D to (5,5); L to (4,6) tail; R to (6,6)\n\nCan move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6) or L to (4,6)\n\nIf move D to (5,5), no food, etc.\n\nAte on turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, eating (3,4) on turn 4 as before.\n\nBut all have one eat by turn 4 or 3.\n\nSince (5,3) is eaten on turn 3, earliest, I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the food under snake: (3,4) will be eaten later, but not in 5 turns.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the state, snake head direction is given as U, and after each move, direction changes.\n\nIn answer format, just the action for each turn.\n\nNow, I think my sequence is ok.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nAfter turn 5, snake at (5,5), which is safe, and I can go to (5,6) to eat next turn.\n\nBut I need to think about tail reward danger or other risks.\n\nCurrently, with length 2 or 1, low risk.\n\nAnother thing: when I ate (5,3) on turn 3, the food was there with life span 9 at turn 1, so at turn 3, life span decreased to 7? Turn 1: life span 9, after turn 1: 8, turn 2: 7, turn 3: 6 when eaten? At turn t, when snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it at that turn.\n\nAt turn 3, food at (5,3) has life span: at turn 1, 9; after turn 1, 8; at turn 2, 8? Let's clarify the countdown.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\"\n\nI think: at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span L, and after the turn, it decreases to L-1.\n\nBut when the snake moves, it does so during the turn.\n\nTypically, the food is present during the turn if life span >0 at start of turn.\n\nWhen snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it during that turn, before the decrease.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify, but I think: if at the time of move, food is present, it can be eaten.\n\nSince life span decreases after the turn, during the turn, if life span >0, food is there.\n\nFor (5,3) at turn 1: life span 9\n\nAfter turn 1, life span 8\n\nAt turn 2, life span 8\n\nAfter turn 2, life span 7\n\nAt turn 3, life span 7, so present, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n\nPerhaps I can include eating (3,4) later, but for 5 turns, this is fine.\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 1 to 5). The strategy focuses on efficiently eating the positive food at (5,3) on turn 3 to grow the snake early, which provides more flexibility for future moves. After eating, the snake moves upward to position itself for eating the food at (5,6) on a subsequent turn (beyond turn 5), leveraging the open path and avoiding risks like walls, obstacles, and potential collisions. The food at (3,4) under the snake has a long life span (10 at turn 1), so it can be eaten later after moving away and returning safely. The internal obstacle at (5,2) is avoided by not moving downward from (5,3).\n\n- **Turn 1 (current turn)**: Move R (right) to (4,4). This moves the head away from (3,4) (freeing the cell for later eating) and toward the food at (5,3). No food is eaten, so the snake remains length 1. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 2**: Move D (down) to (4,3). This positions the snake adjacent to the food at (5,3). No food is eaten, so the snake remains length 1. New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R (right) to (5,3). The snake eats the positive food (+1 score), growing to length 2. The new positions are head at (5,3) and tail at (4,3). New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move U (up) to (5,4). This avoids the obstacle at (5,2) and moves toward the food at (5,6). No food is eaten, so the snake moves to head at (5,4) and tail at (5,3). New head direction: U.\n- **Turn 5**: Move U (up) to (5,5). This continues the path toward (5,6) for eating on turn 6. No food is eaten, so the snake moves to head at (5,5) and tail at (5,4). New head direction: U.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ turns ahead**:\n- By turn 5, the snake has eaten one food (at turn 3) and is positioned at (5,5) with direction U, ready to eat (5,6) on turn 6 (U move to (5,6), which is safe and efficient).\n- The food at (3,4) (life span 10) can be eaten around turn 7–10 by moving left/down from the current path (e.g., from (5,5) or later positions). With the snake longer, care is needed to avoid the \"tail reward danger\" when returning, but the path can be planned safely.\n- The food at (1,1) (life span 9) is farther but can be targeted later if feasible, though (5,6) and (3,4) are higher priority due to proximity after turn 5.\n- Risks are minimized: no wall or obstacle collisions (borders and (5,2) avoided), and with the snake length at 2 by turn 5, body collision is unlikely if movements are planned carefully (e.g., no tight loops). Instant reverse is prevented by direction management.\n\nThis sequence ensures one food is eaten early for growth, sets up for a second food, and keeps the snake safe for long-term survival and scoring.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 2: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 3: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 4: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the grid has walls. The borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nThe snake is currently just a single segment at (4,4), and the head direction is right (R). So the snake is only the head at this point since it's one segment. When it eats food, it will grow.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value +1 and life span 8, so it disappears after 8 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 10 (since current turn is 2, and life span decreases each turn including current, so after 8 turns: turn 2 to turn 9 it exists, gone on turn 10? Let's calculate: at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns including t, so if life span is L, it exists for L turns starting from the turn it's present. Here, turn 2, life span 8, so it will be there until turn 2 + 8 - 1 = 9? Or does it disappear at the end of turn 2 + L?\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Let's see: at turn t, life span is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1. When life span is 1, after that turn, it disappears. So for food at (1,1) with life span 8 on turn 2, it will be there until turn 9 (since on turn 9, life span 1, after turn 9 it disappears). Similarly, turn 2 + 8 - 1 = 9, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) and (5,6) both have life span 8, so disappear after turn 9.\n\n(3,4) has life span 9, so disappears after turn 10 (turn 2 + 9 - 1 = 10? Turn 2: life span 9, after turn 2: 8, turn 3:7, ..., turn 10: life span 1, present on turn 10, disappears after turn 10, so not on turn 11.\n\nBut since we're acting on turns, we need to know when it's available.\n\nNow, snake positions: only (4,4), so no body, just head. Direction is R, so moving right.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but since direction is R, I cannot instantly reverse to L. So cannot go left on next turn. But since it's the first move, I can choose any except opposite, but opposite to R is L, so cannot go L. Can go U, D, or R.\n\nAlso, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and internal at (5,2).\n\nGrid: let's sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nRows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\n(0,0) bottom-left? Usually in coordinates, (x,y), but for grid, y=0 might be bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but since movement U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo snake at (4,4), head direction R.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,1) - bottom-left area\n\n- (5,3) - right, down a bit from snake\n\n- (5,6) - right, up\n\n- (3,4) - left, same row as snake\n\n(3,4) is directly left of snake at (4,4), since x=3,y=4.\n\nAnd life span: all food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nSince snake is only head, eating food will grow it. After eating, length becomes 2, then body segments.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But currently, no tail, so not an issue yet.\n\nFirst, let's see possible moves from (4,4) with direction R.\n\nCannot go L (opposite), so can go U, D, R.\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- R: to (5,4). Is (5,4) valid? No wall? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 borders, and internal (5,2). (5,4) is not a wall, so ok. Also, no body, so safe.\n\n- U: to (4,5). Valid.\n\n- D: to (4,3). Valid.\n\nNow, food: (3,4) is directly left, but I cannot go left because of no reverse. So I cannot reach (3,4) this turn. (3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent left, but since I can't go L, I have to go elsewhere.\n\nOther food: (1,1) is far, (5,3) and (5,6).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is down from (5,4) or something.\n\nLet me list distances.\n\nCurrent position: (4,4)\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,4): distance Manhattan |4-3| + |4-4| = 1, but cannot move directly there.\n\n- (1,1): |4-1| + |4-1| = 3+3=6\n\n- (5,3): |4-5| + |4-3| =1 +1=2\n\n- (5,6): |4-5| + |4-6| =1 +2=3\n\n(3,4) is closest but unreachable directly.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince (3,4) is close and has longer life span (9 vs 8 for others), it might be good to get it soon, but I have to go around.\n\nBut I cannot go left now, so I must move away first.\n\nOptions:\n\nIf I go R to (5,4), then from there, I can go to (5,3) or (5,5) or (6,4), but not L to (4,4).\n\n(5,3) has food, so if I go to (5,4), then next turn I can go down to (5,3) to eat it.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), which is below (5,4).\n\ny=3 is down, since y increases up.\n\n(5,3) is down from (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (4,5), or D to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is down, and (5,3) is at (5,3), so from (4,3) I can go right to (5,3) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5), I can go to (5,6) or something.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,6), up.\n\nNow, (3,4) is at (3,4), left. To get there, I need to approach from another direction since I can't go left now.\n\nFor example, if I go up or down first, then left.\n\nBut it has life span 9, so I have until turn 10 to eat it. Turn 2 now, life span 9, disappears after turn 10, so I can eat it on turn 10 at latest.\n\nSimilarly, others disappear after turn 9, so earlier.\n\nBut since all +1, I need to get as many as possible while surviving.\n\nNow, also, after eating, snake grows, so body segments.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n\nCurrently no body, so immediate moves are safe.\n\nBut let's think about the path to (5,3).\n\nIf I go R to (5,4) now (turn 2), then on turn 3, I can go D to (5,3) and eat the food. Then snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (5,3), tail at (5,4)? When you eat, you grow on the next move, I think.\n\nStandard snake: when you move onto food, you eat it, and the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo on turn when you move to food cell, you eat, and snake grows immediately, so after eating, the head is on food, and the previous position becomes body, but since it was head, now it's body, and tail is added? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically in snake, when you eat, the head moves to food, consumes it, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays in place or something? No.\n\nMovement: each turn, head moves to new cell, if that cell has food, you eat, and tail does not move, so length increases by one. If no food, tail moves forward, length same.\n\nRule says: for positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so when head moves to food cell, it eats, and the snake grows, meaning the tail doesn't move that turn, so a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n\nBut in terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new position, say newH, and tail moves off its position, so new positions [newH, H, B1, ..., B2] if multiple segments, but since tail moved, the last segment is removed.\n\nWith eating: head moves to new position with food, eats, tail does not move, so new positions [newH, H, B1, ..., T] , so T stays, and new segment is added, but since tail didn't move, it's like the tail is extended.\n\nFor example, if snake is [A] (single segment), and moves to B with food: positions become [B, A], so now head at B, tail at A.\n\nIf no food, moving to B, but since no body, it just moves to B, positions [B], tail same as head, but length 1.\n\nIn this case, snake at (4,4), if it moves to (5,4) without food, positions become [(5,4)], still length 1.\n\nIf it moves to (3,4) with food, but can't directly.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nOption 1: Go R to (5,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen on turn 3, from (5,4), direction was R, so can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nNow, (5,3) is below, so I can go D to (5,3). (5,3) has food, so move to (5,3), eat, snake grows to length 2: positions [(5,3), (5,4)] head at (5,3), tail at (5,4). Direction after move: since I moved down, head direction now D.\n\nNow, on turn 4, from (5,3), direction D, so can go L, R, D, not U (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: L to (4,3), R to (6,3), D to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is a wall, internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nL to (4,3): is it wall? No, borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,3) is within, ok.\n\nR to (6,3): x=6<7, y=3>0, not wall.\n\nD to (5,2) is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\nNow, other food: (1,1), (5,6), (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is left and up from (5,3)? (5,3) to (3,4): |5-3| + |3-4| =2+1=3.\n\n(5,6) is up, |5-5| + |6-3| =0+3=3.\n\n(1,1) far.\n\nBut (3,4) has longer life, but we can go towards it.\n\nFrom (5,3), if I go L to (4,3), then from there.\n\nBut let's see the whole path.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going directly to (3,4) but I have to go around.\n\nAnother option: from start (4,4), go D to (4,3) on turn 2.\n\nThen on turn 3, from (4,3), direction D, so can go L, R, D, not U.\n\n(4,3) to (5,3) is right, so I can go R to (5,3) and eat the food. Then snake grows to [(5,3), (4,3)] head at (5,3), tail at (4,3). Direction R.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nOr from (4,3) I could go elsewhere, but (5,3) is close.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U from (4,4) to (4,5), then from there to (5,6) or something.\n\nBut let's compare the food.\n\n(5,3) and (3,4) are both close, but (3,4) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\n(5,3) disappears after turn 9, (3,4) after turn 10.\n\nBut turn 2 now, so I have time.\n\nBut to maximize, I should get the one that might be harder to get later.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake has body, so I need to avoid colliding.\n\nNow, another food at (5,6), which is up.\n\nAnd (1,1) is far, but I can get it later.\n\nBut life span all 8 or 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSince the grid is small, and walls, I need to be careful of dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,2) wall.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for (5,3) first since it's easy to get.\n\nOption: Turn 2, go R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 3, go D to (5,3) and eat. Now snake: head at (5,3), tail at (5,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), can go L to (4,3) or R to (6,3), not U or D (D is current, opposite U, but D to (5,2) is wall, invalid anyway).\n\nSo L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf go L to (4,3), positions: head to (4,3), no food there, so tail moves? After eating on turn 3, positions [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nOn turn 4, move head to new position.\n\nIf move to (4,3), no food, so tail moves off (5,4), so positions become [(4,3), (5,3)] head at (4,3), tail at (5,3). Direction L (since moved left).\n\nIf move to (6,3), positions [(6,3), (5,3)], direction R.\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can go towards (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is up-left from (4,3)? (4,3) to (3,4) is left and up, so I need to go left or up, but direction is L, so from (4,3), direction L, can go U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent up from (3,3) or left from (4,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,4), I can go to (4,4) first or directly.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I go U to (4,4), then on turn 5, from (4,4) direction U, can go U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nThen to (3,4), I can go L to (3,4) since not opposite (current direction U, opposite D, L is not opposite, so can go L to (3,4).\n\nThen eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, from other paths.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, on turn 2: if I go to (5,4), then turn 3 to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 4, I need to move. Say I go L to (4,3).\n\nThen positions: after move, head at (4,3), body at (5,3), so [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 5: from (4,3), direction L, can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), not R.\n\n(4,4) has no food, but it's a position.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4) on turn 5, then positions: head to (4,4), no food (assuming not, food is at (3,4) not eaten yet), so tail moves, positions become [(4,4), (4,3)]? Previous positions [(4,3), (5,3)], head to (4,4), so new head (4,4), and the body (4,3) since tail (5,3) moves off? When head moves, the tail moves off the last position.\n\nPositions: before move: head (4,3), body (5,3) — since length 2, indices: position 0 head, position 1 tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so new positions: [new_head, previous_head]\n\nSo from [(4,3), (5,3)] move to (4,4), no food, so new positions [(4,4), (4,3)]\n\nTail was (5,3), removed, and new tail is (4,3).\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nThen on turn 6, from (4,4) direction U, can go U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4), not D.\n\n(3,4) has food, so go L to (3,4) and eat. Then with food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, positions: head to (3,4), and previous positions [(4,4), (4,3)] but since eating, tail not move, so new positions [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]? When eating, head moves to new cell with food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the tail position stays, and a new segment is added there? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so the segment that was the tail is still there, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n\nLet's think: positions before move: let's say [H, B, T] for length 3, but here length 2.\n\nBefore move: positions [P_head, P_tail]\n\nMove head to new cell N.\n\nIf no food, new positions [N, P_head] and P_tail is removed.\n\nIf food at N, new positions [N, P_head, P_tail] or [N, P_head] and P_tail stays, but since P_tail was part of snake, it stays, so new segment at P_tail? No.\n\nTypically: the snake moves, head to new cell. If food, the tail does not advance, so the body extends: the new head is at N, and the tail remains, so the segment that was tail is still tail, and a new segment is not added; rather, the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: before: [A, B] with A head, B tail.\n\nAfter moving to N with food: new positions [N, A] and B is still there, so [N, A, B]? No, that would be three positions.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nWhen moving to a cell without food: head moves to new cell, tail moves off its cell, so positions shift: new head, then previous head becomes body, tail is removed.\n\nFor example, [A] single: move to B, no food: [B]\n\n[A,B] head A tail B: move head to C, no food: [C, A] and B removed.\n\nWith food: move head to C with food: [C, A] and B is not removed, so positions [C, A, B]? But B was tail, now it's body, and tail is still B? No, the tail is the last segment.\n\nAfter eating, the head is at C, the previous head A is now body, and the tail B remains, so positions [C, A, B] with C head, B tail.\n\nLength increased by one.\n\nSimilarly, if single segment [A], move to B with food: positions [B, A] with B head, A tail.\n\nIn this case, from (4,4) single, move to (5,4) no food: positions [(5,4)]\n\nThen to (5,3) with food: positions [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nThen move to (4,3) no food: positions [(4,3), (5,3)]  (tail (5,4) removed)\n\nThen to (4,4) no food: positions [(4,4), (4,3)]\n\nThen to (3,4) with food: positions [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] since eating, tail not move, so from [(4,4), (4,3)] move to (3,4) with food, new positions [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] head (3,4), tail (4,3)\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate (5,3) on turn 3 and (3,4) on turn 6.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4) eat\n\nNow, on turn 6, I eat (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) has life span 9, on turn 6 it is still there? Turn 2 life span 9, so on turn 6, life span left: from turn 2:9, turn3:8, turn4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, so yes, present.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) was eaten on turn3.\n\nNow, other food: (1,1) and (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is up.\n\nFrom turn 6, after eating (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)? Positions [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] head at (3,4), tail at (4,3).\n\nDirection after move to (3,4) was L, so direction L.\n\nNow, I can go to other food.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is far, |3-5| + |4-6| =2+2=4.\n\n(1,1) farther.\n\nBut also, there is (5,6) food.\n\nLife span: (5,6) disappears after turn 9, so on turn 6, life span left: turn 2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, gone after turn9.\n\nSo I have until turn9 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) same.\n\nNow, from (3,4), direction L, I can go U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\nThen towards (5,6) or (1,1).\n\nBut (5,6) might be easier.\n\nI need to think if there are risks.\n\nAnother option: from the beginning, go towards (3,4) faster.\n\nFor example, on turn 2, instead of going R, go U or D to then go left.\n\nSay turn 2: go U to (4,5)\n\nThen on turn 3, from (4,5) direction U, can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nThen I can go L to (3,5), for example.\n\nThen to (3,4), but (3,4) is below, so from (3,5) I can go D to (3,4) to eat.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: L to (3,5)  // no food at (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5) direction L (since moved left), can go U, D, L, not R.\n\nThen go D to (3,4) and eat. So eat on turn 4.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,4), (3,5)] head (3,4), tail (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen I can go to other food.\n\nCompared to previous where I ate on turn 3 and turn 6, here I ate (3,4) on turn 4, but not (5,3) yet.\n\n(5,3) is still there.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,4), direction D, can go L, R, D, not U.\n\nR to (4,4), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\nGo R to (4,4), no food, then positions: head to (4,4), tail moves, so [(4,4), (3,4)] since previous [(3,4), (3,5)], move to (4,4) no food, so new positions [(4,4), (3,4)] tail (3,5) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (4,4), can go to (5,4), then to (5,3) to eat.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,4) go R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 6: from (5,4) direction R, can go U, D, R, not L. Go D to (5,3) eat.\n\nSo ate (3,4) on turn 4 and (5,3) on turn 6.\n\nSimilar to before but different order.\n\nIn first sequence, I ate (5,3) on turn 3 and (3,4) on turn 6.\n\nIn this, (3,4) on turn 4 and (5,3) on turn 6.\n\nNow, turn count: in first sequence, by turn 6 I have eaten two food.\n\nIn second, also two by turn 6.\n\nBut in first, I ate (5,3) earlier.\n\nNow, the food at (5,6) is not eaten yet.\n\nAlso, (1,1).\n\nBut (5,6) might be a good target.\n\nAnother food at (5,6).\n\nIf I go directly to it.\n\nFor example, from start, turn 2: go U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 3: go U to (4,6)  // no food\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6) direction U, can go U, L, R, not D. U to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, border, so invalid. L to (3,6), R to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) has food, so go R to (5,6) and eat.\n\nSequence: turn 2: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: U to (4,6)  // no food, positions [(4,6)] since single, but after turn 2: positions [(4,5)], move to (4,6) no food, positions [(4,6)]\n\nTurn 4: move to (5,6) with food, positions [(5,6), (4,6)] head (5,6), tail (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can go to other food.\n\nAte (5,6) on turn 4.\n\nBut I missed (3,4) and (5,3) for now.\n\n(3,4) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3).\n\nBut let's see which one is better.\n\nI need to maximize the number of food eaten.\n\nAlso, avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, the grid has a wall at (5,2), so bottom-right area might be tricky.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,3), then I have to be careful not to get stuck.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is corner.\n\nNow, back to the current state.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider the path to multiple food.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nNow, another point: the food at (3,4) is on the same row, left, but I can't go directly, so moving away might be necessary.\n\nBut let's list all possible actions for turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: from (4,4) direction R, can go U, D, R.\n\n- If R to (5,4): then as before, can eat (5,3) on turn 3.\n\n- If U to (4,5): then can go to (5,6) or to (3,4) via (3,5)\n\n- If D to (4,3): then can go to (5,3) on turn 3 to eat.\n\nIf I go D to (4,3) on turn 2, then turn 3 go R to (5,3) eat, similar to first option.\n\nBut in first option with R then D, I go to (5,4) then (5,3).\n\nWith D then R, I go to (4,3) then (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), after eating, I am at (5,3) with tail at (4,3) or something.\n\nLet's define.\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3)  // no food, positions [(4,3)] (since single, moved to (4,3))\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,3) with food, eat, positions [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3), tail (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), which is up-left.\n\nFrom (5,3), direction R, can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2) wall, invalid, so U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf go U to (5,4), no food, positions: head to (5,4), tail moves, so [(5,4), (5,3)]  (tail (4,3) removed)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (5,4), can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4), not D.\n\nThen to (3,4), I need to go left.\n\nGo L to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4), (5,4)]? Previous [(5,4), (5,3)], move to (4,4), new positions [(4,4), (5,4)] tail (5,3) removed.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (4,4), go L to (3,4) eat, as before.\n\nTurn 4: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 5: L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: L to (3,4) eat\n\nSame as first sequence but different starting point.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating (5,3) on turn 3 and (3,4) on turn 6.\n\nIf I go to (5,6) first, I can eat on turn 4.\n\nBut (5,6) has life span 8, so on turn 4 it is still there.\n\nTurn 2: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: U to (4,6)  // no food\n\nTurn 4: R to (5,6) eat  // positions [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen from here, I can go to (3,4) or (5,3).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is left-down.\n\nFrom (5,6), direction R, can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid. D to (5,5), R to (6,6).\n\nSo can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nTo reach (3,4), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, go D to (5,5), no food, positions: head to (5,5), tail moves, so [(5,5), (5,6)] (tail (4,6) removed)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (5,5), can go L, R, D, not U.\n\nL to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4).\n\nThen to (3,4), I can go to (4,5) then (4,4) then (3,4), etc.\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,3), down.\n\nBut (5,3) might be eaten earlier if I go that way.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,1) is not considered yet.\n\nBut let's think about the long-term.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 with borders and one obstacle.\n\nThe area around (5,2) wall might be dangerous if snake is long.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,3), then I have to avoid (5,2) wall.\n\nSimilarly, bottom-left corner.\n\nSince all food is positive, and I need to eat as many as possible, I should aim to eat the closest first to grow the snake, but with the life span, I have time.\n\nBut growing the snake might allow me to reach other food faster? Not necessarily, since with body, movement might be constrained.\n\nFor example, with length 1, I can go anywhere, with length 2, I need to avoid the tail, but since tail follows, it's ok as long as I don't double back immediately.\n\nBut in general, shorter snake is more maneuverable.\n\nSo perhaps eat the easy food first.\n\n(5,3) and (3,4) are both easy to get within few turns.\n\n(5,6) is also easy if I go up.\n\n(1,1) is farther.\n\nAlso, there is the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but not applicable yet.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no body, so all food is accessible.\n\nIn this state, all food is on empty cells.\n\n(1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4) all not under snake.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, for turn 2, I need to choose an action.\n\nLet's consider the 5-turn plan.\n\nSuppose I go R to (5,4) on turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3: D to (5,3) eat. Snake: [(5,3), (5,4)] dir D\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), can go L to (4,3) or R to (6,3)\n\nSay go L to (4,3) no food. Snake: [(4,3), (5,3)] dir L\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3), dir L, go U to (4,4) no food. Snake: [(4,4), (4,3)] dir U\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4), go L to (3,4) eat. Snake: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] dir L\n\nNow, on turn 6, I have eaten two food, length 3.\n\nThen I can go to other food, like (5,6) or (1,1).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), from (3,4), I can go up or right.\n\nFor example, turn 7: from (3,4) dir L, go U to (3,5) or D to (3,3) or L to (2,4)\n\nSay go U to (3,5) no food. Snake: head to (3,5), tail moves, so [(3,5), (3,4)] since previous [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)], move to (3,5) no food, new positions [(3,5), (3,4)] and tail (4,3) removed? Positions before move: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nMove head to (3,5), no food, so new positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ] and tail (4,3) removed, body (4,4) becomes new tail? After move: head at (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, and the tail (4,3) is removed, so new positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ] with head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,5) dir U, go U to (3,6) or L to (2,5) or R to (4,5), not D.\n\nThen towards (5,6), say go R to (4,5) no food, etc.\n\nBut it will take several turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,6) first.\n\nTurn 2: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: U to (4,6) no food. Snake: [(4,6)]\n\nTurn 4: R to (5,6) eat. Snake: [(5,6), (4,6)] dir R\n\nTurn 5: from (5,6) dir R, go D to (5,5) no food (assume). Snake: [(5,5), (5,6)] dir D\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5) dir D, go L to (4,5) or R to (6,5) or D to (5,4)\n\nSay go L to (4,5) no food. Snake: [(4,5), (5,5)] dir L\n\nThen to (3,4), I can go down and left.\n\nBut (3,4) might be eaten by turn 6, life span 9, so on turn 6 life span 5, ok.\n\nBut from here, it might be longer path.\n\nTo eat (3,4) from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) then L to (3,4).\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) dir L, go D to (4,4) no food. Snake: [(4,4), (4,5)] dir D\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4) dir D, can go L to (3,4) eat, since not opposite (current D, opposite U, L is not opposite).\n\nGo L to (3,4) eat.\n\nSo ate (5,6) on turn 4 and (3,4) on turn 8.\n\nLater than previous sequences.\n\nIn first sequence, I ate (5,3) on turn 3 and (3,4) on turn 6.\n\nIn this, (5,6) on turn 4 and (3,4) on turn 8.\n\nSo better to eat the closer food first.\n\n(5,3) and (3,4) are both close.\n\n(5,3) is at distance 2 via path, (3,4) at distance 2 or 3 depending on path.\n\nAlso, (5,6) is at distance 3.\n\n(1,1) at distance 6.\n\nSo prioritize (5,3) and (3,4).\n\nBut I can't eat both immediately, so eat one first.\n\nSince (3,4) has longer life, I can eat (5,3) first, then (3,4), as in first sequence.\n\nThen later (5,6) and (1,1).\n\nBut (5,6) has shorter life, disappears after turn 9, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nIn the first sequence, by turn 6 I am at (3,4) with length 3.\n\nFrom there, to (5,6), which is (5,6), distance |3-5| + |4-6| =2+2=4, so at least 4 turns, turn 7,8,9,10.\n\nTurn 9 is the last to eat (5,6), since disappears after turn 9, so must eat on or before turn 9.\n\nOn turn 6, I can start moving.\n\nTurn 6: at (3,4) dir L, go U to (3,5) as before.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,5) dir U, go U to (3,6) or R to (4,5)\n\nSay go R to (4,5) no food. Positions: from [(3,5), (3,4)] move to (4,5), no food, new positions [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 8: from (4,5) dir R, go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5) or D to (4,4), not L.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), so I can go R to (5,5) first.\n\nGo R to (5,5) no food. Positions: [(5,5), (4,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 9: from (5,5) dir R, can go U to (5,6) which has food, so move to (5,6) and eat. Just in time on turn 9.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) can be eaten later if possible.\n\nBut life span 8, disappears after turn 9, so on turn 9 I am at (5,5), going to (5,6), so I can eat (5,6) on turn 9.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), far away, |5-1| + |6-1| =4+5=9, from (5,6) on turn 9, to (1,1) it would take at least 9 moves, but on turn 9, (1,1) has life span: turn 2:8, turn3:7,..., turn9:1, so present on turn 9, disappears after, so I can eat it on turn 9 only if I am there, but I am at (5,6), so not possible. After turn 9, gone, so I cannot eat (1,1) because it disappears after turn 9, so last chance turn 9, but I am not there.\n\nLife span: on turn 2, life span 8, so after turn 2, life span 7 for turn 3, ..., after turn 8, life span 1 for turn 9, after turn 9, life span 0, gone, so not present on turn 10.\n\nSo must be eaten on or before turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3) and (5,6), life span 8, must eat by turn 9.\n\n(3,4) life span 9, by turn 10.\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate (5,3) on turn 3 and (3,4) on turn 6, and (5,6) on turn 9.\n\n(1,1) cannot be eaten since too far.\n\nIf I go directly to (1,1) first, but it's far, and I might miss others.\n\nFor example, from start to (1,1), Manhattan distance 6, so at least 6 turns, turn 8 or later, but by then (5,3) and (5,6) might be gone if not eaten, but I can eat on the way, but not efficient.\n\nSo better to eat the close ones.\n\nIn the sequence where I ate (5,6) on turn 4, then I can eat (3,4) on turn 8 as above, but (5,3) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nAfter eating (5,6) on turn 4, positions [(5,6), (4,6)] dir R.\n\nThen I can go down to (5,5), etc., but to (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,6), turn 5: go D to (5,5) no food. Snake: [(5,5), (5,6)] dir D\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5) dir D, go D to (5,4) no food. Snake: [(5,4), (5,5)] dir D\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4) dir D, can go L to (4,4) or R to (6,4), not U.\n\nGo L to (4,4) no food. Snake: [(4,4), (5,4)] dir L\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4) dir L, go L to (3,4) eat. Snake: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] since eating, tail not move.\n\nBut I ate (3,4) on turn 8.\n\nNow, (5,3) is at (5,3), which is below (5,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), dir L, I can go to (5,3) but it's far.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4) dir L, go D to (3,3) or U to (3,5) or L to (2,4)\n\nNot directly to (5,3).\n\nTo reach (5,3) from (3,4), I need to go right and down, at least 3 moves: e.g., to (4,4) then (5,4) then (5,3), but (5,4) might have body.\n\nOn turn 8, after eating (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (5,4)? Positions [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] head (3,4), tail (5,4)\n\nDirection L (since moved left to (3,4)).\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4) dir L, can go to (3,3), (3,5), or (2,4)\n\nNone is (5,3). To go to (5,3), I need to move to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, cannot move there, collision.\n\n(4,4) is occupied by body, so I cannot move to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is tail, but moving to tail is allowed only if it moves away, but in this case, if I move to (4,4), it is body, not tail, and occupied, so collision.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can only move to adjacent empty cells: (3,3), (3,5), (2,4).\n\n(2,4) might be free, but not towards (5,3).\n\nThen on turn 9, I cannot reach (5,3), so (5,3) disappears after turn 9, not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, in this path, I missed (5,3).\n\nWhereas in the first path, I ate all three except (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is not eaten, but it's far.\n\nSo to maximize, the first sequence is better: eat (5,3) early, then (3,4), then (5,6) on turn 9.\n\nNow, for (1,1), with life span 8, must eat by turn 9, but from turn 6 position, I was going to (5,6), which is opposite direction, so not possible. Similarly, in any case, (1,1) is too far to reach by turn 9 from any position after eating others, so I can only eat three food: (5,3), (3,4), (5,6).\n\n(1,1) cannot be eaten.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 action.\n\nIf I go R to (5,4) on turn 2, I can execute the plan to eat (5,3) on turn 3, (3,4) on turn 6, (5,6) on turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence for (5,6) on turn 9, I was at (5,5) on turn 9? In the earlier:\n\nAfter turn 6: at (3,4) with body, but I need to go to (5,6).\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nAfter turn 6: positions [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] head (3,4), dir L\n\nTurn 7: go U to (3,5) no food. Snake: [(3,5), (3,4)] (since tail (4,3) removed, body (4,4) became tail? Positions before: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] move to (3,5) no food, so new head (3,5), previous head (3,4) becomes body, tail (4,3) removed, so new positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ] head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nDir U\n\nTurn 8: from (3,5) dir U, go R to (4,5) no food. Snake: [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5) dir R, go R to (5,5) no food? (5,5) may not have food, but I need to go to (5,6).\n\nFrom (4,5) dir R, I can go U to (4,6), R to (5,5), or D to (4,4), not L.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), so I should go to (5,5) first.\n\nGo R to (5,5) no food. Snake: [(5,5), (4,5)] dir R\n\nBut (5,6) is above, from (5,5), on turn 10? Turn 9 I am at (5,5), and (5,6) needs to be eaten on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 9, I am at (5,5), and I move to (5,6)? From (4,5) on turn 9, I can directly go to (5,6) if possible.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 9, direction R, I can go U to (4,6), R to (5,5), D to (4,4).\n\n(5,6) is not directly adjacent from (4,5)? (4,5) to (5,6) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I can only move to adjacent cells: up, down, left, right.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can go to (4,6), (5,5), (4,4), or (3,5) but not opposite.\n\n(5,6) is not reachable directly; I need to go to (5,5) or (4,6) first.\n\nThen to (5,6).\n\nBut on turn 9, from (4,5), if I go to (5,5), I am at (5,5), not (5,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), then on turn 10, but (5,6) not on turn 10.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,6) on turn 9 from this position.\n\nMistake.\n\nIn turn 8, I was at (3,5) dir U, I need to go towards (5,6).\n\nInstead of going R to (4,5), I should go U to (3,6) on turn 8.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,5) after move to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,4)] dir U\n\nTurn 8: go U to (3,6) no food. Snake: [(3,6), (3,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 9: from (3,6) dir U, can go L to (2,6), R to (4,6), U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo go R to (4,6) no food. But (5,6) is at (5,6), not reached.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (5,6) is two steps, |3-5| + |6-6| =2, so need two moves, but on turn 9, I can only be at (4,6), not (5,6).\n\nIf on turn 8 I go directly to a cell closer.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 8, instead of U to (3,6), go R to (4,5), but same issue.\n\nThe only way to reach (5,6) by turn 9 is to be at (5,5) or (4,6) or (5,7) or (6,6) on turn 9, but (5,7) wall, (6,6) possible.\n\nBut from the position after turn 6, I need to move efficiently.\n\nAfter turn 6: at (3,4) with body, but to go to (5,6), I can go right and up.\n\nFor example, turn 6: from (3,4) dir L, go U to (3,5) as before.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,5) dir U, go R to (4,5) no food. Snake: [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 8: from (4,5) dir R, go U to (4,6) no food. Snake: [(4,6), (4,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 9: from (4,6) dir U, can go R to (5,6) and eat! Yes, (5,6) is adjacent right, and I can move there.\n\nFrom (4,6), direction U, I can go to (5,6) since R is not opposite? Current direction U, opposite D, so I can go L, R, U.\n\nR to (5,6) is possible.\n\nAnd (5,6) has food, so on turn 9, move to (5,6) and eat.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, I ate (5,3) turn 3, (3,4) turn 6, (5,6) turn 9.\n\nAll within life span.\n\n(1,1) not eaten.\n\nNow, for turn 2, if I go D to (4,3), I can eat (5,3) on turn 3 similarly.\n\nOr if I go U, I might eat (5,6) earlier but miss (5,3) or something.\n\nBut with U, I can eat (5,6) on turn 4, then (3,4) on turn 8, and (5,3) might be missed.\n\nSince (5,3) is close to start, better to get it.\n\nAlso, in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to output actions starting from turn t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably for a few turns, or until a decision point.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 2 to turn 6, I have actions.\n\nFor turn 2, action R.\n\nThen turn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nThen later to (5,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 6 or so.\n\nSince the state is given, and I need to act, but for this response, I should provide the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if going R on turn 2 is best.\n\nIf I go D on turn 2 to (4,3), then turn 3 to (5,3) eat, then same as before, I can go to (3,4) via (4,4) etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nIf I go U, I might not get (5,3) easily.\n\nFor example, turn 2 U to (4,5), turn 3 U to (4,6), turn 4 R to (5,6) eat, then from there, to (3,4), I need to go left and down.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,6) dir R, go D to (5,5) no food. Snake: [(5,5), (5,6)] dir D\n\nTurn 6: from (5,5) dir D, go L to (4,5) no food. Snake: [(4,5), (5,5)] dir L\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) dir L, go D to (4,4) no food. Snake: [(4,4), (4,5)] dir D\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4) dir D, go L to (3,4) eat.\n\nBut (5,3) is not eaten, and on turn 8, (5,3) is gone after turn 9, but I can try to eat it before.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 6, I could go down to (5,4) then to (5,3), but on turn 6, (5,3) life span: turn 2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, so still there, but from (5,5) dir D, I can go D to (5,4) no food, turn 6: to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (5,5)] dir D\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4) dir D, can go L to (4,4) or R to (6,4), not U.\n\nThen to (5,3), I need to go down, but (5,3) is below, but from (5,4), D to (5,3) but (5,3) has food, so if I go D, I eat it.\n\nOn turn 7, from (5,4) go D to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut I ate (5,6) on turn 4 and (5,3) on turn 7, and (3,4) on turn 8 as above.\n\nAte three, same as before.\n\nBut (5,3) eaten on turn 7 instead of turn 3.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut in terms of score, same number.\n\nHowever, in the first sequence, by eating (5,3) early, the snake is longer, which might help in some way, but in this small grid, not necessary.\n\nBut with longer snake, I might block paths, but here not critical.\n\nSo both possible.\n\nBut for turn 2, going R or D both allow eating (5,3) soon.\n\nGoing U allows eating (5,6) soon.\n\nBut since (3,4) has longer life, I can get it later.\n\nNow, to choose, I think going towards (5,3) is fine.\n\nAlso, in the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so for response, I can output a sequence of actions starting from turn 2.\n\nLet me output for 5 turns: turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nBased on first plan.\n\nTurn 2: go R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 3: D to (5,3) eat\n\nThen turn 4: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: L to (3,4) eat\n\nAfter that, continue to (5,6).\n\nFor the boxed answer, I need to write the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 4, after eating (5,3), I could go R to (6,3) instead of L, but going L is towards (3,4), so better.\n\nSimilarly, all consistent.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nThen beyond, but for now.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn \\(t_1 = 2\\). The plan prioritizes eating positive food efficiently while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. Given the current state:\n\n- Snake is a single segment at (4,4) with direction R.\n- Food locations: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), and (3,4), all with value +1 and life spans indicating they disappear after turn 9 (for (1,1), (5,3), (5,6)) and after turn 10 (for (3,4)).\n- Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate food targets**: (5,3) is the closest reachable food (Manhattan distance 2 via path) and can be eaten on turn 3. (3,4) is also close but requires maneuvering due to the no-instant-reverse rule (cannot move left from (4,4) on turn 2). (5,6) is farther but can be reached by turn 9 before it disappears. (1,1) is too distant to reach by turn 9 and will not be eaten.\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating, the snake grows, so paths must avoid dead ends (e.g., near the wall at (5,2)). The grid is 8x8, so open spaces are used to navigate safely.\n- **5+ turn plan**: The sequence below eats (5,3) on turn 3, (3,4) on turn 6, and sets up for (5,6) on turn 9, maximizing score with 3 food eaten. All moves avoid walls and body collisions.\n- **Turn-by-turn actions**:\n  - Turn 2: Move right (R) to (5,4) – positions snake to eat (5,3) next turn.\n  - Turn 3: Move down (D) to (5,3) – eat food, snake grows to length 2 (positions: head (5,3), tail (5,4)).\n  - Turn 4: Move left (L) to (4,3) – avoid obstacle at (5,2) and move toward (3,4); no food, so tail moves (positions: head (4,3), tail (5,3)).\n  - Turn 5: Move up (U) to (4,4) – continue path to (3,4); no food, so tail moves (positions: head (4,4), tail (4,3)).\n  - Turn 6: Move left (L) to (3,4) – eat food, snake grows to length 3 (positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)).\n- **Beyond turn 6**: The snake can proceed to (5,6) by turn 9 (e.g., via (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), then (5,6) on turn 9), ensuring it is eaten before disappearance. Survival is maintained by avoiding walls and body.\n\nThis plan eats 3 food by turn 9, scores +3, and keeps the snake safe. Moves respect direction constraints (e.g., no instant reverse).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 3: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 4: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 6: L (left)\n}",

The snake is currently at position (5,4), heading right. The head direction is R, so moving right increases x.\n\nThe grid borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2), which I must avoid.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (5,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (5,6) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (3,4) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (1,1) it's 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns including this one, so it has 7 turns left starting from turn 3. Similarly, (5,3) and (5,6) have life span 7, and (3,4) has life span 8.\n\nCurrent turn is t=3.\n\nSnake positions: only [(5,4)], so the snake has only one segment? That means it's just the head, no body yet. Because it says \"snake positions: [(5,4)]\" and it's a list with one element. But in the rules, it says \"snake positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...]\" with head first, so if only one position, it must be that the snake has length 1.\n\nConfirming: \"Snake Positions: [(5,4)]\" – yes, only one segment. So the snake is of length 1 right now. That means when I eat food, I grow by one segment each time.\n\nAlso, since there's no body, I don't have to worry about body collisions except for the tail issue, but with only head, no tail yet.\n\nHead direction is R, so I'm moving right.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAvailable moves: I can go U, D, L, R. But since head direction is R, I cannot instantly reverse to L. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nCurrent position: (5,4)\n\nIf I move R (right): to (6,4)\n\nU (up): to (5,5)\n\nD (down): to (5,3)\n\nL (left): to (4,4) but since direction is R, moving L is reverse, not allowed. So only U, D, R are possible.\n\nNow, let's see the food locations relative to current position.\n\n- (1,1) is far away, at x=1,y=1, while I'm at (5,4). Distance: |5-1| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7, so about 7 moves away if I go directly, but I have to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\n- (5,3) is directly below me at (5,3), since I'm at (5,4). So if I move down, I go to (5,3), which has food.\n\n- (5,6) is directly above at (5,6), so move up to (5,5) first, then to (5,6), but (5,6) is two moves up.\n\nCurrent y=4, (5,6) is y=6, so |6-4|=2, so two moves up.\n\n- (3,4) is left at (3,4), but since I'm at (5,4), moving left would be to (4,4), then to (3,4). But moving left is not possible now because of no instant reverse; head direction is R, so I can't move L this turn.\n\nI can only move U, D, or R this turn.\n\nFood at (5,3) is very close; I can eat it by moving down to (5,3) this turn.\n\nBut I need to think about the risks and long-term.\n\nAlso, since the snake has no body, eating food will make it grow to length 2. Then I have to be careful.\n\nMoreover, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut right now, no tail, so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, when I have a tail, I need to be careful.\n\nNow, life span of food: all have life span 7 or 8, current turn 3.\n\n(5,3) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after turn 3 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for (5,3), life_span=7, at turn 3, it has 7 turns left, including turn 3. So it will disappear after turn 3+6=9? Countdown: at turn t, life_span decreases.\n\nTypically, if life_span is L, at turn t, it has L turns including t, so it disappears at turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nFor example, at turn 3, life_span=7, so after 7 turns, it disappears. After N turns means N turns from now.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after\" means after the current turn, so it will be gone at the start of turn N+1 or something.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, let's use the countdown.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 3, for food with life_span 7, countdown starts at 7, decreases by 1 each turn, so after turn 3, countdown=6; after turn 4, countdown=5; ... when countdown=0, it disappears. So it exists as long as countdown >0.\n\nAt turn t, when we process, countdown is for the turn.\n\nStandard: at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span, which is the number of turns it will remain, including t. So after t, life_span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life_span =1, it disappears after this turn.\n\nIf life_span=7 at turn 3, it will be there for turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and disappear after turn 9, so at turn 10 it's gone.\n\nLife_span=7, from turn 3 to turn 9, that's 7 turns: t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 → 7 turns, gone at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,4) life_span=8, from t=3 to t=10, gone at t=11.\n\nBut I need to plan for the next few turns.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (5,3) to eat the food there immediately.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2: positions [(5,3), (5,4)] but when I move to (5,3), the head is now at (5,3), and since I ate, I grow, so the tail stays or moves?\n\nRule: when you eat food, length increases, but the tail doesn't move immediately; it stays until the next move.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail remains in place for that turn, and when you move next, the tail follows.\n\nBut in terms of positions, after eating, the new segment is added at the position where the head was before moving? Let's clarify the growth.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd \"snake positions\" list.\n\nInitially, snake positions: [(5,4)] head only.\n\nIf I move down to (5,3) and eat the food there, then new positions: head moves to (5,3), and since I ate, I add a new segment at the previous position (5,4), so snake becomes [(5,3), (5,4)] with head at (5,3) and tail at (5,4).\n\nThen, for the next move, if I move somewhere, the tail will move to the previous head position or something? No.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, and if you didn't eat, the tail is removed; if you ate, the tail stays and a new segment is added.\n\nBut at the moment of eating, the growth happens immediately.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (5,3) and eating, the snake now has two segments: head at (5,3), body at (5,4).\n\nThen, for the next turn, I move from head (5,3) to a new position, say (5,2) or (6,3) or (5,4) but (5,4) is the body, so I can't move there, collision.\n\nAvailable moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), but (5,4) is current body, so if I move there, I collide with body and die. Unless it's the tail, and tail moves, but let's see the rule.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that is the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, after eating at (5,3), positions are [(5,3), (5,4)], head at (5,3), tail at (5,4).\n\nIf I move up to (5,4), that's where the tail is. Since the tail will move forward (to where the head was, (5,3)? When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves to the next segment or is removed if no growth.\n\nStandard: when you move, the head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and if you didn't eat, the last segment (tail) is removed; if you ate, the tail stays and no removal.\n\nBut in terms of collision, moving into the tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, from [(5,3), (5,4)], head at (5,3), tail at (5,4).\n\nIf I move head to (5,4), which is the tail position, then after move, head is at (5,4), and the tail should move to (5,3), but since I moved to (5,4), which was tail, and tail moves to (5,3), so no collision, because at the new state, head is at (5,4), body at (5,3), and they are adjacent, not overlapping.\n\nBut the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\nBut from (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,4) - which is tail, safe\n\n- D to (5,2) - but (5,2) is an internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles [(5,2)], so (5,2) is a wall, I can't move there, collision.\n\n- L to (4,3)\n\n- R to (6,3)\n\nAlso, head direction: after moving down to (5,3), the new head direction is D (down), so I cannot move up immediately next, because up is opposite to down? Directions: U and D are opposite, L and R are opposite.\n\nSo if I moved down to (5,3), head direction is now D, so next turn I cannot move U (up), because it's instant reverse.\n\nSimilarly, I can move L, R, or D.\n\nBut back to the immediate choice.\n\nFirst, at turn 3, I can:\n\n- Move D to (5,3) to eat the food\n\n- Move U to (5,5)\n\n- Move R to (6,4)\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), I eat the food, grow to length 2, positions [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nThen at turn 4, from (5,3), head direction D, I can move L to (4,3), R to (6,3), or D to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, so only L or R.\n\nMoving U to (5,4) is possible but (5,4) is the tail, and since head direction is D, moving U is opposite, so not allowed? Head direction is current direction before move.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3) with direction D, for the next move, I can only move in directions not opposite to D, so not U.\n\nSo from (5,3) with dir D, possible moves: L to (4,3), R to (6,3), D to (5,2) but wall, so only L or R.\n\nSay I move L to (4,3), then positions: head to (4,3), tail moves to (5,3), so snake at [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,3) now, it might disappear later, but life span is 7, from turn 3 to 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut (5,3) is very close, and I can eat it safely.\n\nHowever, after eating, I have a body at (5,4), and I'm at (5,3), so I can only go left or right, not up or down because down is wall, up is body but tail, but I can go up to (5,4) which is tail, but with direction D, I can't go up because opposite.\n\nSo I'm restricted.\n\nPerhaps it's better not to eat immediately and go for other food.\n\nFood at (5,6) above: I can move up to (5,5) now, then next turn to (5,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is left, but I can't go left directly because reverse not allowed; I have to go up or down first to change direction.\n\n(1,1) is far.\n\nAlso, (5,6) has life span 7, same as others.\n\nBut let's list all options for turn 3.\n\nOption A: Move D to (5,3) - eat food, grow, but then at turn 4, I must move L or R, and down is blocked by wall, so I have to go to (4,3) or (6,3).\n\nSay (4,3) or (6,3).\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut the grid has walls at borders, so x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (4,3) is valid, (6,3) valid.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (5,2), which is below, but I'm at (5,3), so (5,2) is wall, not accessible.\n\nOption B: Move U to (5,5) - no food there, positions: head at (5,5), no body, so still length 1. Head direction now U.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can move U to (5,6) to eat food there, or L to (4,5), or R to (6,5), or D to (5,4) but D is opposite to U? Direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) instantly.\n\nSo from (5,5) dir U, possible moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), eat food, grow to [(5,6), (5,5)]\n\nThen head direction U.\n\nNext moves, etc.\n\nOption C: Move R to (6,4) - no food, head to (6,4), dir R. Then at turn 4, I can move U to (6,5), D to (6,3), R to (7,4), L to (5,4) but L is opposite to R, so not allowed. So U, D, R possible.\n\n(6,3) has no food, (6,5) no, (7,4) border, x=7 is border wall? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so (7,4) is x=7, which is wall, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nSo from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), R to (7,4) but wall, not possible, L to (5,4) but opposite not allowed. So only U or D.\n\nMove U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term survival and score.\n\nSince all food is +1, I want to eat as many as possible, but avoid dying.\n\nAlso, with the snake growing, it gets harder to move.\n\nBut currently, length 1, so I can eat safely.\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (5,3). If I eat it now, I grow, and I have a body segment at (5,4). Then, the food at (5,6) is still there, but to reach it, I need to go from (5,3) to, say, (4,3) then (4,4) then (5,4) but (5,4) is body, but if I move there, it might be tail or not.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), positions [(5,3), (5,4)] at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 4, I move, say, L to (4,3), then positions: head (4,3), tail moves to (5,3)? When I move head to (4,3), the body segment at (5,4) moves to where the head was, (5,3), so new positions: [(4,3), (5,3)] head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nThen, the cell (5,4) is now empty.\n\nFood at (5,6) is above.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), then to (4,5), etc., to reach (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is at y=6, I'm at y=3, so several moves.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is left, from (4,3) I can move to (3,3) or something.\n\nBut life spans are long, so I have time.\n\nFood at (5,3) will disappear after turn 9, current turn 3, so I can eat it later, but if I don't eat now, someone else might, but since I'm the only snake, I can come back.\n\nBut the food might be eaten by me later or disappear.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat when convenient.\n\nHowever, there's a risk with the food at (5,3) because of the wall at (5,2) below.\n\nIf I eat it, I'm at (5,3) with wall below, so I can only go left or right, which might limit options.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can go to other places.\n\nFood at (5,6) is also close, and I can eat it by moving up twice.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is at (3,4), same y, different x.\n\nBut I can't go left directly.\n\nLet's think about the grid layout.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nFood: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4)\n\n(5,3) and (5,6) are on the same column, x=5.\n\n(5,3) is at y=3, (5,6) at y=6, I'm at y=4.\n\nAlso, (3,4) at x=3,y=4, same row as me.\n\n(1,1) at corner.\n\nSince I'm at (5,4), and I can move U, D, R.\n\nMoving D to (5,3) eats food, but then I'm stuck with only horizontal moves from there, and wall below.\n\nMoving U to (5,5) gets me closer to (5,6), and at (5,5) I can eat (5,6) next turn if I move U.\n\nMoving R to (6,4) gets me to the right, but then I'm near the border, and only U or D moves possible from there, as R is wall.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can only move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3), both no food, so I waste a turn.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to other places.\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), which is close to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut let's prioritize eating food with shorter life span, but all have similar life span, (5,3) and (5,6) life span 7, (3,4) life span 8, so (3,4) has one more turn, but not significant.\n\n(5,3) life span 7, from turn 3 to 9, 7 turns.\n\nSame as others except (3,4) has 8.\n\nBut all are long.\n\nNow, the key point is that if I eat (5,3) now, I grow, and then the food at (5,6) is still there, but to reach it, I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) after moving to (4,3) or (6,3), then to higher y.\n\nBut the cell (5,4) has the body, but it will move.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), at turn 4, if I move to (4,3), positions [(4,3), (5,3)], then at turn 5, I can move U to (4,4), positions [(4,4), (4,3)] tail at (4,3) or something.\n\nHead at (4,3), move U to (4,4), then positions: head (4,4), body moves to (4,3), so [(4,4), (4,3)]\n\nThen I can move to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,6), I can go to (5,5) then (5,6), but at (5,5), if I move there, it might be safe if the tail is not there.\n\nBut with length 2, the tail is moving, so it should be ok.\n\nBut there's a risk if the food is under the tail, but not now.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,3) is at (5,3), and if I eat it, I'm there, but the wall at (5,2) means I can never go down from there, so it's a dead end in that direction.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,4), I'm near x=7 wall, so limited space.\n\nWhereas if I go up to (5,5), I can access more area.\n\nAlso, food at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is left, and I can reach it by changing direction.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,5) now, then at turn 4, I can move U to (5,6) to eat that food, or move L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I eat (5,6) at turn 4, then I grow, positions [(5,6), (5,5)] head at (5,6) dir U.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\n(5,6) is near the top, y=6, close to y=7 wall, so similar issue, but I can move left or right.\n\ny=7 is wall, so from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, or L to (4,6), R to (6,6), or U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, not possible.\n\nSo only L or R, or D but D to (5,5) is body, and since head direction U, moving D is opposite, not allowed? Head direction after eating at (5,6) is U, so I cannot move D (down) instantly.\n\nSo only L or R possible.\n\nMove L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go down or something.\n\nBut again, limited.\n\nWhereas if I go for (3,4), it's more central.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), same y as me, x=3.\n\nTo reach it, from (5,4), I need to go left, but I can't directly because reverse not allowed; I'm heading R, so L not possible.\n\nSo I have to change direction first.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,5), then at turn 4, head direction U, I can move L to (4,5) (since not opposite), then at turn 5, from (4,5) dir L (since I moved left), I can move L to (3,5), or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) to eat the food at (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) has life span 8, so it will be there for a while.\n\nSimilarly, I can go directly from (5,4) to (4,4) but I can't because L not allowed.\n\nOnly after changing direction.\n\nMove D to (5,3), but that eats food, then I'm at (5,3), then I can move L to (4,3), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut that involves eating (5,3) first.\n\nI should consider the tail reward danger, but currently no tail, so not an issue.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here no body, so all food is accessible.\n\nNow, to maximize long-term, I should avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nEating (5,3) puts me near a wall with limited escape.\n\nSimilarly, eating (5,6) puts me near top wall.\n\nWhereas (3,4) is more open, and (1,1) is corner but I can go later.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,4) first.\n\nBut to do that, I need to move away from right.\n\nSo at turn 3, moving U or D might be better to change direction.\n\nMoving R to (6,4) gets me closer to border, which is bad.\n\nSo probably not R.\n\nBetween U and D, D eats food but traps me, U gets me closer to (5,6) but also near top.\n\nBut (5,6) can be eaten later.\n\nAnother idea: if I move U to (5,5), I don't eat anything, but at turn 4, I can move to (4,5) or (6,5) or to (5,6).\n\nIf I move to (4,5), then I'm heading left or up, and I can go to (3,4) from there.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, move U to (5,5), dir U.\n\nTurn 4, move L to (4,5), now dir L.\n\nTurn 5, move D to (4,4), dir D? When I move to (4,5), head direction is L.\n\nThen from (4,5), move D to (4,4), which is down, not opposite to L (left), so allowed.\n\nThen at (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) to eat the food at (3,4).\n\nTurn 5: at (4,4), move L to (3,4), eat food, grow to length 2 if I wasn't grown, but let's see.\n\nAt turn 3: start at (5,4), move U to (5,5), no eat, positions [(5,5)], length 1.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,5), no food there, positions [(4,5)], length 1.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4), no food at (4,4)? Food is at (3,4), not (4,4), so no eat, positions [(4,4)], length 1.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4), eat food, grow to [(3,4), (4,4)], length 2.\n\nThen head at (3,4) dir L.\n\nFrom there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut the food at (5,3) and (5,6) are still there, with life span 7, so at turn 6, for (5,3), life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 6, countdown 7-3=4? Let's calculate countdown.\n\nAt turn 3, life span 7, countdown=7.\n\nAfter turn 3, countdown=6.\n\nAfter turn 4, countdown=5.\n\nAfter turn 5, countdown=4.\n\nAt turn 6, when I act, countdown=4, so still there.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\nBut I used 3 turns to eat (3,4), and I have the snake at (3,4) with body at (4,4).\n\nThen I can go south or west, etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), which is east and south.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), or L to (2,4), or U to (3,5), or R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, so if I move R, it's the tail, so safe if I can.\n\nHead direction L, so I can move U, D, L (since R is opposite, not allowed).\n\nFrom (3,4) dir L, possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but R is opposite, not allowed, so only U, D, L.\n\nIf I move to (4,4), it's opposite, not allowed, so I can't move directly to the tail.\n\nSo I have to move U, D, or L.\n\nThen from there, to reach (5,3), I need to go east and south.\n\nFor example, move D to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut at (5,3), if I arrive when it's still there, I can eat.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\nBut let's see the initial choice.\n\nIf at turn 3, I move D to (5,3), eat immediately, then I have length 2, and I can move to (4,3) or (6,3) at turn 4.\n\nSay I move to (4,3), then positions [(4,3), (5,3)].\n\nThen at turn 5, from (4,3) dir L (since moved left), I can move U to (4,4), or D to (4,2), but y=2, is it wall? Walls: border y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is not border, but internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2), so (4,2) is free.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is ok.\n\nMove U to (4,4), then to (4,5), etc., to reach (5,6) or (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), from (4,4) I can move L to (3,4).\n\nBut in this case, I ate (5,3) early.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U at turn 3 to (5,5), then at turn 4 move U to (5,6) eat, then I have length 2 at (5,6) and (5,5), and I can move L or R.\n\nThen to reach (3,4), I need to go west and down.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,6), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut both options have me eating one food early but being near a wall.\n\nIf I move R at turn 3 to (6,4), then at turn 4, I can move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3), no food, so I waste turns, and I'm near east wall.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6), or L to (5,5), or D to (6,4) but (6,4) was previous, but with body? After moving to (6,4) at turn 3, no eat, positions [(6,4)], length 1.\n\nTurn 4 move U to (6,5), positions [(6,5)], length 1.\n\nThen I can move to (6,6) or (5,5) or (6,4) but D is opposite if dir U.\n\nDir after move to (6,5) is U, so can move U to (6,6), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall, D not allowed, so U or L.\n\nMove to (5,5), then from there I can go to (5,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut it takes more turns to reach food.\n\nSo moving R seems inefficient.\n\nTherefore, at turn 3, better to move U or D.\n\nNow, between U and D, moving D eats food immediately, but traps me in the south with the wall at (5,2) and border y=0.\n\nMoving U to (5,5) doesn't eat, but allows me to eat (5,6) next turn or go towards (3,4).\n\nEating (5,6) puts me near north wall.\n\nBut the grid is symmetric, except for the internal obstacle at (5,2), which is south, so south is more dangerous.\n\nAlso, (1,1) is southwest, but far.\n\nSo to avoid the south, perhaps moving U is better.\n\nMoreover, with the internal obstacle at (5,2), moving south might be riskier.\n\nSo let's choose to move U at turn 3.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (5,5) dir U, I can move U to (5,6) to eat, or move L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), I eat and grow to length 2, positions [(5,6), (5,5)], head dir U.\n\nThen at turn 5, I can only move L or R, as U to (5,7) wall, D not allowed opposite.\n\nSo move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\nSay move L to (4,6), positions [(4,6), (5,6)] head (4,6) dir L.\n\nThen at turn 6, from (4,6) dir L, can move U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, D to (4,5), L to (3,6), R to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, and R is opposite? Head direction L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,7) wall, not possible; D to (4,5); L to (3,6); R not allowed.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nMove D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf I move D to (4,5), then positions head (4,5), tail to (4,6)? Move head to (4,5), body moves to (4,6) previous head, so [(4,5), (4,6)]? No: previous positions [(4,6), (5,6)], head at (4,6), move to (4,5), so new head (4,5), body moves to (4,6), but the second segment was at (5,6), which moves to the previous head position (4,6), so new positions: [(4,5), (4,6)]? Let's list: old: index 0: (4,6) head, index 1: (5,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,5), new head at (4,5), and the body segment moves to where head was, (4,6), so new positions: [(4,5), (4,6)] with head at (4,5), tail at (4,6).\n\nThen head direction D (down).\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut to reach (3,4), I need to go down and left.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) has life span 8, at turn 6, countdown: at turn 3, life span 8, countdown=8; after turn 3, 7; turn 4,6; turn 5,5; turn 6,4, so still 4 turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) at turn 6 countdown=4 (since life span 7, turn 3:7, t4:6, t5:5, t6:4).\n\nSo I can reach it.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (5,6) at turn 4.\n\nIf at turn 4, from (5,5), instead of moving U to eat (5,6), I move L to (4,5) to go towards (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 4, move L to (4,5), no eat, positions [(4,5)], length 1 (since no grow).\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5) dir L, I can move L to (3,5), or D to (4,4), or U to (4,6), or R to (5,5) but R opposite not allowed.\n\nSo move L to (3,5), or D to (4,4), or U to (4,6).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so from (4,5) I can move D to (4,4), then at turn 6 move L to (3,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 5: move to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4)].\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4), eat, grow to [(3,4), (4,4)].\n\nThen I have the food at (5,6) and (5,3) still available.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is north, from (3,4) I can go north and east.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,6) might be far.\n\nIf I eat (5,6) first, it's closer to my initial position.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is below.\n\nBut with internal obstacle at (5,2), accessing (5,3) might be tricky.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the closest food first to grow and have more flexibility.\n\n(5,3) and (5,6) are both close; (5,3) is one move down, (5,6) is two moves up.\n\n(3,4) is two moves left but I need to change direction.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate a few paths.\n\nPath 1: Turn 3, move D to (5,3) eat. Snake: [(5,3), (5,4)] dir D.\n\nTurn 4, move L to (4,3) (since D dir, can move L). Positions: head to (4,3), body to (5,3), so [(4,3), (5,3)] dir L.\n\nTurn 5, from (4,3) dir L, move U to (4,4) (not opposite). Positions: head (4,4), body to (4,3), so [(4,4), (4,3)] dir U.\n\nTurn 6, from (4,4) dir U, move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4) or R to (5,4), etc.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), I can eat the food at (3,4), positions: head to (3,4) eat, grow to [(3,4), (4,4)]? Move head to (3,4), body moves to (4,4), and since I ate, add new segment, so positions: head (3,4), then the previous body positions, but with growth.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), new head (3,4), the body segments move: the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,4), and since I ate, I add a new segment at the previous tail position? Standard: when you eat, the new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions before move: [(4,4), (4,3)] head (4,4), tail (4,3).\n\nI move head to (3,4), which is food, so I eat and grow.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,4), the body segment at (4,4) moves to where head was, but since I ate, the tail stays, so new segments: head (3,4), then the previous head position becomes body, so (4,4) becomes body, and tail remains (4,3), but since I grew, I add a new segment at tail? No.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and if you ate, you add a new segment at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nLet's think: before move, positions: index 0: head (4,4), index 1: body (4,3)\n\nI move head to (3,4), so new head at (3,4).\n\nThen the body segment at (4,3) moves to where the head was, (4,4)? No: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo the new body segment 1 moves to the previous position of segment 0, which is (4,4).\n\nBut since I ate, I add a new segment at the previous position of the tail, which is (4,3).\n\nSo new positions: head (3,4), body at (4,4), and new tail at (4,3)? Indices: segment 0: (3,4), segment 1: (4,4) (moved from head old), segment 2: (4,3) (new from growth).\n\nSo length 3: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]\n\nHead at (3,4), dir L (since moved left).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I have eaten two foods: (5,3) and (3,4), and (5,6) is still there.\n\nFrom here, to reach (5,6), I need to go to (4,4) but it's body, or to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPath 2: Turn 3, move U to (5,5) no eat. Positions [(5,5)] dir U.\n\nTurn 4, move U to (5,6) eat. Grow to [(5,6), (5,5)] dir U.\n\nTurn 5, move L to (4,6) (only choice besides R). Positions: head (4,6), body to (5,6), so [(4,6), (5,6)] dir L.\n\nTurn 6, from (4,6) dir L, move D to (4,5) (since U wall, L possible, D possible, R not allowed).\n\nMove D to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body to (4,6), so [(4,5), (4,6)] dir D.\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,5) dir D, move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5) or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nIf I move to (4,4), no food, then to (3,4) later.\n\nBut to eat (3,4), it might take longer.\n\nAt turn 4, from (5,5), instead of moving U to eat (5,6), I move L to (4,5) to go towards (3,4).\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5) no eat. Positions [(5,5)] dir U.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,5) no eat. Positions [(4,5)] dir L.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4) no eat. Positions [(4,4)] dir D.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4) eat. Grow to [(3,4), (4,4)] dir L.\n\nThen I have eaten (3,4) at turn 6, and (5,6) is still at (5,6), with countdown at turn 6: for (5,6), life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 6, countdown=4 (t3:7, t4:6, t5:5, t6:4), so 4 turns left.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), then to (4,5), to (5,5), to (5,6) to eat at turn 10, but at turn 10, countdown for (5,6): at turn 6 countdown=4, so after t6:3, t7:2, t8:1, t9:0, so at turn 10 it's gone, so I can eat at turn 9 or before.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4) dir L, move U to (3,5) positions [(3,5), (3,4)]? Head to (3,5), body to (3,4), so [(3,5), (3,4)] dir U.\n\nTurn 8: move R to (4,5) positions [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R.\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,5) positions [(5,5), (4,5)] dir R.\n\nTurn 10: move U to (5,6) but at turn 10, food (5,6) countdown: at turn 6:4, t7:3, t8:2, t9:1, t10:0, so at the beginning of turn 10, countdown=0, so food disappeared, not there. So I cannot eat it.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, so at turn 3, life span 7, it will be gone after turn 9, so at turn 10 not there.\n\nAt turn 9, countdown=1, so if I move to (5,6) at turn 9, I can eat it if it's there.\n\nAt turn 9, from (5,5) move U to (5,6), if food is there, eat.\n\nCountdown at turn 9: for (5,6), at turn 3 life span 7, countdown=7; after t3:6; t4:5; t5:4; t6:3; t7:2; t8:1; t9:0? At turn 9, when I start, countdown=1 (since after turn 8, countdown=1), so during turn 9, if I move to it, I can eat it, and after that, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears.\n\nThe food is there as long as countdown >0 at the start of the turn, and I can eat it during the turn.\n\nAfter eating, countdown decreases, but since I ate it, it's removed anyway.\n\nSo at turn 9, countdown=1, I can eat (5,6) if I move there.\n\nIn the path: at turn 9, I am at (5,5), move U to (5,6) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nBut in this case, I can eat (5,6) at turn 9.\n\nBut I also have (5,3) to eat.\n\n(5,3) life span 7, at turn 3, so at turn 9 countdown=1, I can eat at turn 9.\n\nBut from (5,5) at turn 9, I go to (5,6), not to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is south, I'm at north.\n\nSo I might not eat (5,3).\n\nBut (1,1) is also there, but far.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat both (5,3) and (5,6) since they are close.\n\nBut with the internal obstacle, (5,3) might be difficult.\n\nBack to turn 3 decision.\n\nPerhaps the best is to move U to (5,5) at turn 3, then at turn 4 move U to (5,6) to eat, then at turn 5 move L to (4,6), then at turn 6 move D to (4,5), then at turn 7 move D to (4,4), then at turn 8 move L to (3,4) to eat that food.\n\nBut at turn 8, (3,4) countdown: life span 8 at turn 3, at turn 8 countdown=1 (t3:8, t4:7, t5:6, t6:5, t7:4, t8:3? Let's calculate:\n\nAt turn t, countdown at start of turn.\n\nTurn 3: countdown=8 for (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 3: countdown=7\n\nAfter turn 4: countdown=6\n\nAfter turn 5: countdown=5\n\nAfter turn 6: countdown=4\n\nAfter turn 7: countdown=3\n\nAfter turn 8: countdown=2\n\nAfter turn 9: countdown=1\n\nAfter turn 10: countdown=0, gone.\n\nSo at turn 8, countdown=2, so I can eat at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) at turn 8 countdown=2 (life span 7, t3:7, t4:6, t5:5, t6:4, t7:3, t8:2).\n\nSo both available.\n\nIn this path, I ate (5,6) at turn 4, and (3,4) at turn 8.\n\nI missed (5,3), but I can go to it later.\n\nBut (5,3) is near the obstacle, so it might be risky to go there with a longer snake.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) at turn 8 after eating, length 3 or something, I can go to (4,4), then to (5,4), but (5,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 8, positions before move: assume turn 7 I am at (4,4) with dir D or something.\n\nIn the path: turn 7: at (4,5) move D to (4,4), no eat, positions [(4,4)] if no body, but let's track.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5) no eat, snake [(5,5)] len1\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,6) eat, snake [(5,6), (5,5)] len2\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,6), positions [(4,6), (5,6)] len2\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,5), positions [(4,5), (4,6)] len2? Head to (4,5), body to (4,6), so [(4,5), (4,6)] len2\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) dir D, move D to (4,4) no eat, positions [(4,4), (4,5)] len2 (head (4,4), body (4,5))\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4) dir D, move L to (3,4) eat, grow to [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5)] len3\n\nThen from here, I can go to (5,3) but it's far, and with countdown 2 at turn 8, I can try to reach by turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut from (3,4), to (4,4) but occupied, so move U to (3,5), then R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, etc.\n\nComplicated, and (5,3) might not be reachable in time with the snake body.\n\nAt turn 8, from (4,4) before moving, I am at (4,4) with body at (4,5), head dir D.\n\nI move L to (3,4) eat, then positions as above.\n\nThen at turn 9, from (3,4) dir L (since moved left), I can move U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), so I need to go east and south, but with body at (4,4) and (4,5), it might be hard to man ever.\n\nFor example, move R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, and R is not opposite? Head direction L, so R is opposite, not allowed. So I can't move to (4,4).\n\nMove D to (3,3), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), but at (5,3) if I arrive at turn 10, countdown for (5,3): at turn 8 countdown=2, after t8:1, t9:0, so at turn 10 gone, so I can eat at turn 9 if I reach.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,4), move D to (3,3), no food, positions [(3,3), (3,4)] or something.\n\nThen turn 10 move to (4,3), no food, etc., too late.\n\nSo I might not eat (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is only one point, and I have other food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is far, I can go later, but with life span 7, at turn 10 it's gone.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 3, gone after turn 9, so at turn 10 not there.\n\nSo I can eat at most three foods: (5,6), (3,4), and maybe (1,1) if I go fast.\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), from (3,4) I can go southwest.\n\nBut let's not worry.\n\nFor turn 3, to avoid being trapped, I think moving U is better than moving D.\n\nMoving R is worse.\n\nSo I'll go with move U at turn 3.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 3 and beyond, but the instruction says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to how many? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nLook at answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to specify for a few turns, probably 5 turns or so.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I should provide a plan for the next 5 turns.\n\nBut the state might change, so I need to decide based on current state.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I can provide actions for turn 3 to turn 7 or something.\n\nSince the snake grows, it's dynamic.\n\nBut for now, at turn 3, I'll move U.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (5,5) dir U, I can move U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 5, from (5,6) dir U, move L to (4,6) (assume I choose left).\n\nThen at turn 6, from (4,6) dir L, move D to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 7, from (4,5) dir D, move D to (4,4) or to (3,5) etc.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nTo keep it simple, for turn 3, move U.\n\nThen the rest can be decided later, but I think I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can provide for turns 3,4,5.\n\nLet's see the food life span; all have at least 5 turns left, so no urgency.\n\nBut to start, I think move U at turn 3.\n\nSo action for turn 3: U\n\nThen for turn 4, if I am at (5,5) dir U, I can move U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 5, at (5,6) dir U, move L to (4,6)\n\nThen for turn 6, at (4,6) dir L, move D to (4,5)\n\n Etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list 3 actions or 5.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format doesn't specify how many to list.\n\nIn the example, it has \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I think list a sequence.\n\nSince t1=3, list from turn 3 to say turn 7 or 8.\n\nBut let's make a plan.\n\nPlan for turn 3 to turn 7:\n\nTurn 3: Move U to (5,5)  -- no eat\n\nTurn 4: Move U to (5,6)  -- eat food, grow to len2\n\nTurn 5: Move L to (4,6)  -- no eat, positions [(4,6), (5,6)] dir L\n\nTurn 6: Move D to (4,5)  -- no eat, positions [(4,5), (4,6)] dir D\n\nTurn 7: Move D to (4,4)  -- no eat, positions [(4,4), (4,5)] dir D\n\nThen at turn 8, I can move L to (3,4) to eat if possible.\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), so at turn 8 I can eat it.\n\nIn this, I ate one food at turn 4.\n\nIf at turn 4, I move L instead of U, to go towards (3,4).\n\nTurn 3: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: L to (3,4) eat\n\nThen I ate at turn 6.\n\nAnd (5,6) is still there, I can go back.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 6, I can move U to (3,5), then to (4,5), to (5,5), to (5,6) by turn 10, but (5,6) gone at turn 10, so at turn 9 I can be at (5,5) move U to (5,6) if countdown>0.\n\nAt turn 9, countdown=1 for (5,6), so can eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the question is for turn t1=3, and I need to provide actions.\n\nI think for turn 3, move U is a good choice.\n\nThen for turn 4, move U to eat (5,6).\n\nThen for turn 5, move L to (4,6).\n\n etc.\n\nBut to be specific, let's output for turns 3,4,5.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" etc., so I can list multiple.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother risk: the food at (5,3) is on the same column, and if I don't eat it, and later the snake body blocks the way, but since I'm not going south, it might be ok.\n\nBut with the internal obstacle, it might be safer to leave it.\n\nSo I think move U at turn 3.\n\nFinal decision.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing paths that avoid dead ends, walls, and potential collisions while targeting high-value food. Given the current state at turn 3:\n\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (walls) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,4), direction right (R), length 1 (no body segments yet).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (5,6): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (3,4): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 10).\n\n### Analysis for Turn 3 Decision\n- **Immediate moves (turn 3)**: From (5,4) with direction R, possible moves are U (up to (5,5)), D (down to (5,3)), or R (right to (6,4)). L (left) is invalid due to instant reverse rule.\n- **Risks and opportunities**:\n  - **Move D (down)**: Eats food at (5,3) immediately, growing to length 2. However, this traps the snake near the south wall (y=0) and internal obstacle (5,2), limiting future moves to only left or right from (5,3). This increases collision risk long-term and reduces access to other food.\n  - **Move R (right)**: Moves to (6,4), near the east wall (x=7). From there, only U or D moves are possible (since R is blocked by wall and L is invalid due to direction), wasting turns and reducing flexibility. Inefficient for reaching food like (3,4) or (5,6).\n  - **Move U (up)**: Moves to (5,5), no food eaten. This avoids southern risks, positions the snake closer to (5,6), and allows access to (3,4) by changing direction. It maintains grid flexibility for long-term survival and multiple food opportunities.\n- **Long-term view (5+ turns)**:\n  - Eating (5,3) early risks confinement with fewer escape routes. (5,6) is reachable in 2 moves and has the same life span, so delaying (5,3) is acceptable.\n  - Targeting (5,6) next (turn 4) is efficient, as it is only one move away from (5,5). After eating, moving left or right avoids the north wall.\n  - (3,4) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 10) and is accessible by moving west after changing direction at (5,5).\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,2) makes southern moves riskier, so avoiding D minimizes danger.\n- **Conclusion for turn 3**: Move U (up) to (5,5) for better positioning, avoiding the high-risk D move and inefficient R move.\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 3 to 7)\nThe sequence below plans 5 turns ahead (turns 3 to 7), ensuring the snake:\n- Eats (5,6) on turn 4 for early growth.\n- Heads towards (3,4) for a second food, leveraging its longer life span.\n- Avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions (no risk yet as snake is short).\n- Maintains direction constraints (no instant reverses).\n\n| Turn | Action | New Head Position | Direction | Food Eaten? | Snake Length | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|\n| 3    | U      | (5,5)            | U        | No          | 1            | Move up to avoid southern risks and position for (5,6). Direction changes to U. |\n| 4    | U      | (5,6)            | U        | Yes (+1)    | 2            | Eat (5,6); grow to length 2. Positions: head (5,6), tail (5,5). Direction U. |\n| 5    | L      | (4,6)            | L        | No          | 2            | Move left to avoid north wall; no reverse issue. Positions: head (4,6), tail (5,6). Direction changes to L. |\n| 6    | D      | (4,5)            | D        | No          | 2            | Move down toward central area; prepares for (3,4). Positions: head (4,5), tail (4,6). Direction changes to D. |\n| 7    | D      | (4,4)            | D        | No          | 2            | Move down closer to (3,4); no food. Positions: head (4,4), tail (4,5). Direction D. |\n\n**Post-turn 7 Plan**:\n- On turn 8, move L (left) to (3,4) to eat the food there (life span allows until turn 10). This would grow the snake to length 3.\n- Continue towards other food (e.g., (1,1) or remaining options) while avoiding walls and obstacles. (5,3) may be skipped due to high risk from internal obstacle and walls.\n\nThis sequence eats 1 food by turn 4 and positions for a second by turn 8, with minimal risk. Life spans are respected: (5,6) eaten on turn 4 (within life span), (3,4) targeted by turn 8 (countdown 2 at turn 8, safe).\n\n### Answer Format\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U (up)  \nTurn 4: U (up)  \nTurn 5: L (left)  \nTurn 6: D (down)  \nTurn 7: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think, but let's confirm. x from 0 to 7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are free, similarly for y. But walls are at x=0 and x=7, so moving to x=0 or x=7 is death, similarly for y=0 and y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: only [(5,5)]? That can't be right because if it's just one segment, it's the head, but the head direction is given as U (up). And it says snake positions: [(5,5)], which is a list with one element, so the snake has only one segment? But in snake, usually it starts with multiple segments, but here it might be a small snake.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Snake Positions: [(5,5)]\" – that's a single position, so the snake has only the head at (5,5). Head direction is U, meaning it moved up to get there or is facing up.\n\nBut in snake, when you eat food, you grow, but here the snake has no body, so it might be just starting. Also, for a snake with one segment, the tail is the same as head, but we need to be careful with movements.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (1,1,6,1) – that's (x,y,life_span,value), I think. The format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's listed as (x,y,life_span,value), let's see: \" (1, 1, 6, 1) \" – probably (x,y) = (1,1), life_span=6, value=1? But the value should be +1 or -1, here it's 1, so positive food? Similarly, all have value 1 except one.\n\nThe food list: \"(1, 1, 6, 1)\" – I think this means (x,y) = (1,1), value=6? No, the description says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 1, 6, 1)\" and it's listed with three numbers after, but it should be coordinate, value, life_span.\n\nLook: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 1, 6, 1)\" – this is inconsistent. In the core rules, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", but here it says \"Life Span and Value\" in the state, but the values are given as (x,y, something, something).\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value). Let's see the numbers:\n\n- (1,1,6,1) : x=1,y=1, life_span=6, value=1? But value should be +1 or -1 for positive or negative food, here it's 1, so positive.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (5,3,6,1) : x=5,y=3, life_span=6, value=1, positive\n\n- (5,6,6,1) : x=5,y=6, life_span=6, value=1, positive\n\n- (3,4,7,1) : x=3,y=4, life_span=7, value=1, positive\n\n- (5,1,10,1) : x=5,y=1, life_span=10, value=1, positive\n\nAll food has value=1, so all positive food? But in the list, it says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the state, it's written as (x,y, life_span, value) I think, with value last.\n\nFor (1,1,6,1), if value=1, it's positive food. Similarly all have value=1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,1) it's 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t=4.\n\nNow, snake is at [(5,5)] with head direction U. Since only one segment, the tail is also at (5,5).\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, so from turn 4 to turn 9 or so.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Head direction is U, so cannot move D on next turn, because reverse is not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction U, so possible moves: U (continue up), L (left), R (right), but not D (down).\n\nNow, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot go there.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,1) life 6, value +1\n\n- (5,3) life 6, value +1\n\n- (5,6) life 6, value +1\n\n- (3,4) life 7, value +1\n\n- (5,1) life 10, value +1\n\nSnake at (5,5), head direction U.\n\nSince snake has only one segment, moving to any adjacent cell is fine, as long as not wall or obstacle.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (5,6) – but (5,6) has food, and it's within bounds. y=6 is not wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since y=7 is wall, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are free.\n\nSimilarly, x from 1 to 6.\n\n(5,6) is a valid cell, and has food.\n\n- Down: (5,4) – but down is reverse? Head direction is U, so moving D would be reverse, which is not allowed. Cannot move down.\n\n- Left: (4,5)\n\n- Right: (6,5)\n\nNow, (6,5) is within bounds, x=6 is playable since x=7 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is fine.\n\n(5,4) is down, but cannot move down because reverse.\n\nSo possible actions at turn 4: U, L, or R.\n\nIf move U to (5,6), which has food. Since snake has only one segment, eating food will grow to two segments. After eating, the new segment is added, so positions become head at (5,6), and tail at (5,5), I think. In snake, when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the tail stays or moves? Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail does not move that turn, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nRecall: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats the food, the food disappears, and the snake grows by adding a new segment at the head position, but since the head moved, the body follows, but in this case, since only one segment, after eating, the snake will have head at food position and tail at previous position.\n\nFor example: start with head at (5,5), move to (5,6) which has food. After move, head is at (5,6), and since it ate, the tail remains at (5,5), so now snake is [(5,6), (5,5)] with head at (5,6) and direction now U.\n\nThen next turn, if move U, head to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so death. Cannot move up from (5,6) because y=7 is wall.\n\ny=6 is the top row, since y=7 is wall. Moving up from (5,6) to (5,7) would hit wall.\n\nSo moving U to (5,6) is possible, but then from (5,6), only left and right are possible, down would be reverse if direction is U.\n\nAfter moving U to (5,6), head direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next turn.\n\nPossible from (5,6): L to (4,6), R to (6,6), or if no reverse, but U is impossible (wall), D is reverse, so only L or R.\n\n(4,6) and (6,6) are valid cells, no food or anything yet.\n\nBut if I move to (5,6), I eat the food there, so score increases, length becomes 2.\n\nBut then I'm at (5,6) with body at (5,5). Now, from there, I need to move to survive.\n\nIf I move left to (4,6), then snake moves: head to (4,6), tail moves to (5,6)? Standard movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo from positions [(5,6), (5,5)] with head at (5,6), if move L to (4,6), then new head at (4,6), and the body segment (which was head) moves to where the body was? Let's think.\n\nInitial: after eating at turn 4, positions: [(5,6), (5,5)] head at (5,6)\n\nTurn 5: move to, say, (4,6). Head moves to (4,6), and the segment that was at (5,6) becomes the neck or body, and the tail at (5,5) moves to where the head was, which is (5,6). So new positions: head at (4,6), body at (5,6), tail at (5,6)? No.\n\nPositions list: before move, indices: [0] head (5,6), [1] tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move left to (4,6), new head at (4,6), and segment [1] moves to where [0] was, so to (5,6). So new positions: [(4,6), (5,6)]\n\nThe tail is at (5,6), which is the same as the body? (5,6) is occupied by the body now, but in the list, position [1] is (5,6), which is the tail segment.\n\nWith two segments, head and tail.\n\nNow, the cell (5,5) is empty now.\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,6) move right to (6,6), positions become [(6,6), (5,6)]\n\nNow, back to turn 4.\n\nOther options: move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5) at turn 4.\n\nIf move L to (4,5), no food there, so snake moves, but since no food, length same, so positions: head to (4,5), and tail? Since only one segment, tail moves with head? With one segment, moving to (4,5) means the snake is now at [(4,5)], head direction L.\n\nSimilarly for R to (6,5).\n\nNow, (4,5) has no food, (6,5) has no food.\n\nFood at (5,3) which is below, but I cannot move down now because reverse.\n\nAlso, (5,3) is at y=3, x=5.\n\nNow, I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: current turn 4.\n\nFood at (1,1) life 6, so disappears after 6 turns, meaning it will disappear at the end of turn 6? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 4, life span 6, so it will be there for 6 more turns, disappearing after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, food with life_span 6: countdown starts at 6 on turn 4, decreases to 5 on turn 5, ..., to 1 on turn 9, to 0 on turn 10, but when it reaches 0, it disappears. Typically, at the beginning of turn, or after?\n\nThe countdown decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 4, life_span=6, after turn 4, it becomes 5, and so on, until it reaches 0, and when it becomes 0, it disappears, probably before the turn or at the end.\n\nTo be precise, let's assume that at the start of turn, the life_span is checked, and if 0, it disappears before actions.\n\nBut the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n\n\"after N turns\" from current turn.\n\nCurrent turn t, life_span N, it will disappear after N turns, so at turn t+N, it is gone.\n\nFor turn t, during the turn, it is present, and at the end of turn t+N-1, it disappears or something.\n\nI think it's better to think that at the beginning of each turn, before action, the life_span is decremented, and if it becomes 0, the food is removed.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn t, the countdown decreases at some point.\n\nTo simplify, for planning, we can think that food with life_span L at turn t will be available until turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, life_span 6, so available on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life 6, same.\n\n(5,6) life 6, same.\n\n(3,4) life 7, available turns 4 to 10, disappears turn 11.\n\n(5,1) life 10, available turns 4 to 13, disappears turn 14.\n\nCurrent turn 4.\n\nNow, snake at (5,5), direction U.\n\nOptions at turn 4:\n\n- U to (5,6): eat food, grow to length 2, positions [(5,6), (5,5)]\n\n- L to (4,5): no food, snake still length 1 at (4,5), direction L\n\n- R to (6,5): no food, snake at (6,5), direction R\n\nNow, I need to consider risks and long-term survival.\n\nFirst, if I go U to (5,6), I eat the food immediately, but then I'm at (5,6) with body at (5,5). From there, I can only go L or R, since U is wall, D is reverse.\n\nIf I go L to (4,6) or R to (6,6), both are corners, and I might get stuck.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), I can go L to (3,6), D to (4,5), etc., but let's see the board.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,3), which is below, but I cannot go down directly from (5,6).\n\nMoreover, (5,3) has food, but to eat it, I need to go down, but from (5,6), down is to (5,5), which is where the body is. If I move D from (5,6) to (5,5), and the body is at (5,5), then head touches body, collision, death.\n\nImportant: when moving, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away, but in this case.\n\nAt positions [(5,6), (5,5)], if I move down to (5,5), which is occupied by the tail. Now, the tail will move away only if the snake moves, but when head moves to (5,5), at the same time, the tail is supposed to move to the previous position of the segment before it, but since there are only two segments, the tail is at (5,5), and when head moves down to (5,5), it is moving to the cell where the tail is, and at that moment, the tail might not have moved yet.\n\nIn snake movement, typically, all segments move simultaneously: head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the preceding segment.\n\nSo for two segments: head at A, tail at B.\n\nMove head to C.\n\nThen new head at C, tail moves to A (where head was).\n\nSo if C is B, and B is tail, then head moves to B, and tail moves to A, so head and tail swap, but since they move to each other's position, it might be ok, but in terms of collision, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail, and tail moves away, it should be fine, because after move, head is at B, tail is at A, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, positions: before move, head at (5,6), tail at (5,5).\n\nMove head down to (5,5). New head at (5,5). Then tail moves to where head was, (5,6). So new positions: head at (5,5), tail at (5,6).\n\nNo collision, because the tail moved away.\n\nBut the food at (5,5)? (5,5) was the tail position, but there is no food there; the food is at (5,3).\n\nIn this move to (5,5), there is no food, so no eating.\n\nBut (5,5) is empty, I think.\n\nIn this case, moving from (5,6) to (5,5) is possible, but it is down, which is reverse direction.\n\nHead direction is U, moving D is reverse, which is not allowed, as per movement constraints.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from (5,6) with dir U, cannot move D.\n\nSimilarly, cannot move U to wall.\n\nSo only L or R possible.\n\nIf I move L to (4,6) from (5,6), then positions become [(4,6), (5,6)]\n\nThen head at (4,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen I can move L to (3,6), D to (4,5), or U but U to (4,7) wall, not possible.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (6,6), can move R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, not possible, or D to (6,5), or L to (5,6) but that would be back, and (5,6) is now body, so moving L from (6,6) to (5,6) would be to body cell, which is occupied, so collision.\n\nFrom [(6,6), (5,6)], if move L to (5,6), which is occupied by the body segment. Head moves to (5,6), but at that moment, the body is at (5,6), so head collides with body.\n\nAfter move, the body segment moves to where head was, but during the move, when head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies before the body moves.\n\nTypically, collision is checked when head moves to a cell; if that cell is occupied by body or wall, death.\n\nIn this case, (5,6) is occupied by the body before the move, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, walls.\n\nSo from (6,6), moving L to (5,6) is invalid because (5,6) is occupied.\n\nMoving D to (6,5) is possible, since (6,5) is empty.\n\nMoving R to (7,6) wall, not possible.\n\nU to (6,7) wall, not possible.\n\nSo only down to (6,5).\n\nSimilarly from (4,6), moving L to (3,6) possible, D to (4,5) possible, U not, R to (5,6) but (5,6) occupied if body is there.\n\nBack to turn 4.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), I get food but then I'm in a corner with limited moves.\n\nI can move to (4,5) or (6,5) instead, avoiding the food for now.\n\nLet's consider moving L to (4,5) at turn 4.\n\nThen snake at (4,5), direction L, length 1.\n\nFrom there, I can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), or R to (5,5) but (5,5) is previous position, but since no body, moving R to (5,5) is possible, but no food, and it's the same cell, but in terms of direction, moving R would be opposite to current L? Current direction after move L is L, so moving R would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nAfter moving L to (4,5), head direction is L, so cannot move R (right) next turn.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since L is same direction or perpendicular).\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\n(4,6) has no food, (4,4) no food, (3,5) no food.\n\nFood at (3,4) which is below and left, and (1,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (6,5) at turn 4, then at (6,5), direction R, can move U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or R to (7,5) wall not possible, or L to (5,5) but L would be reverse if direction is R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo only U, D, R but R to wall not possible, so only U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n(6,6) has no food, (6,4) no food.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but with long-term survival.\n\nThere is food at (5,3), which is close, but I cannot go down directly because of reverse constraint.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can only go U, L, R.\n\nIf I go L or R, I can then go down later to reach (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is left and down.\n\nAlso, (5,1) is far down.\n\nBut (5,3) has life 6, available until turn 9, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has life 6, available until turn 9, but if I don't eat it now, it might disappear or I can eat later.\n\nBut if I eat it now, I grow, and can eat other food.\n\nBut the problem is that after eating (5,6), I'm at top row, which might be risky.\n\nLet's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this case, no tail reward issue yet, since snake is short.\n\nNow, another thing: food can spawn under body, but here no food under snake.\n\nAt (5,5), no food.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat multiple food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nList all food: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (3,4), (5,1)\n\n(5,6) is at top, (5,3) is at y=3, (5,1) at bottom, (3,4) at left, (1,1) corner.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so at x=5,y=2, I cannot go there.\n\nSo to go to (5,1) or (5,3), I need to be careful around (5,2).\n\nFor example, to eat (5,3), I can go down to it, but from (5,5), I cannot go down directly.\n\nSo I need to move left or right first, then down.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) or (6,5), I can go down to (4,4) or (6,4), then to (5,4) if possible, but (5,4) is empty, no food.\n\n(5,4) is a cell, no food, but I can move there.\n\nLet's simulate from turn 4.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,6) at turn 4.\n\nEat food, length 2, positions [(5,6), (5,5)], direction U.\n\nTurn 5: from here, can only move L or R.\n\nSay move L to (4,6) (since moving R similar by symmetry, but not exactly, because of other food).\n\nAssume move L to (4,6). Positions: head to (4,6), tail to (5,6), so [(4,6), (5,6)], direction L.\n\nNow, from (4,6), can move L to (3,6), D to (4,5), or U not possible.\n\nMove to (3,6): positions [(3,6), (4,6)]\n\nOr move D to (4,5): positions [(4,5), (4,6)]? Head to (4,5), tail to (4,6)? Before move, positions [(4,6), (5,6)]\n\nAfter move D to (4,5): head to (4,5), then the body segment (which was at (4,6)) moves to where head was, (4,6)? No: the segment that was at index 1, (5,6), moves to where index 0 was, which is (4,6).\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,5), body at (4,6).\n\nTail at (4,6).\n\nNow, (4,5) has no food.\n\nFrom here, I can go to other places.\n\nBut I'm at the top row, and food at (3,4) is below.\n\nTo reach (3,4), I need to go down.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), if I am there, I can move D to (4,4), L to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nThe point is, by eating (5,6) early, I grow but am in a corner, and the grid has limited space, especially with obstacle at (5,2).\n\nAnother option: at turn 4, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen snake at (4,5), direction L, length 1.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\nNo food at these cells.\n\nSay I move D to (4,4) to go down towards food at (3,4) or (5,3).\n\nMove D to (4,4), positions: head to (4,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,4), direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nNow, (3,4) has food! Life span 7, at turn 4 it was 7, so at turn 6, life span should be 5? Let's track life span.\n\nAt turn 4, all food present with their life span.\n\nEach turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\nAt turn 4: food at (3,4) life 7\n\nAt turn 5: life 6\n\nAt turn 6: life 5\n\nStill present.\n\nSo at turn 6, from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nEat (3,4), grow to length 2, positions: after move, head at (3,4), tail at (4,4)? Before move, snake at [(4,4)] length 1.\n\nMove to (3,4), eat food, so new positions: head at (3,4), tail at (4,4), so [(3,4), (4,4)], direction L.\n\nThen from here, I can go to other food.\n\nSimilarly, I could have gone to (5,3) from other paths.\n\nBut at turn 4, if I move L to (4,5), then D to (4,4), then L to (3,4) at turn 6, eat food.\n\nNow, food at (5,3) is still there, life 6 at turn 4, so at turn 6, life 4, still available.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), etc., to reach (5,3) or (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 4 I move R to (6,5), similar but on right side.\n\nBut there is food at (5,6) which might expire soon if not eaten.\n\nLife 6 at turn 4, available until turn 9, so I have time.\n\nBut let's compare the options.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,6) is at (5,6), and if I don't eat it now, I can eat it later, but after moving away, it might be harder to reach or I might be longer snake.\n\nBut since it's positive food, eating it is good.\n\nBut the risk is the corner.\n\nNow, there is also tail reward danger mentioned, but with short snake, not an issue.\n\nLet's think about moving to (5,3) directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), I cannot go down, so I need to go left or right first.\n\nSay at turn 4, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5) dir L, move D to (4,4) as before.\n\nThen at (4,4), turn 6, I can move R to (5,4) instead of L to (3,4).\n\n(5,4) is empty, no food.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is previous position, but no body, so can move, but direction: after moving to (5,4), head at (5,4), direction R? From (4,4) move R to (5,4), so direction R.\n\nThen can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(5,3) has food, so move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nBut at (5,3), there is the obstacle at (5,2), so moving down to (5,3) is fine, but from there, I need to be careful not to go to (5,2).\n\nAfter eating (5,3), positions: before move to (5,3), assume snake at (5,4) with length 1 or 2.\n\nIn this path: at turn 4, move L to (4,5), length 1.\n\nTurn 5, move D to (4,4), length 1 at (4,4).\n\nTurn 6, move R to (5,4), length 1 at (5,4).\n\nThen turn 7, move D to (5,3), eat food, grow to length 2, positions [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (5,3), direction D.\n\nThen from here, can move L to (4,3), R to (6,3), or D to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, cannot move there, or U to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, so cannot move U to body.\n\nMove U to (5,4) would be to body cell, collision.\n\nMove D to (5,2) wall, death.\n\nSo only L or R: to (4,3) or (6,3).\n\nSay move L to (4,3), positions [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nThen from there, can go to other areas.\n\nBut I ate (5,3) at turn 7.\n\nIf I had eaten (5,6) at turn 4, I would have score +1 by turn 4, but with risk.\n\nNow, back to turn 4 decision.\n\nI also have to consider the food at (5,6) might be eaten by someone else, but there is only one snake, so only I can eat it.\n\nBut if I don't eat it, it disappears after turn 9, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut (5,6) is at the top, and if I am elsewhere, I might not get back in time.\n\nWith 5 turns ahead, from turn 4 to turn 9.\n\nAt turn 4, if I move U to (5,6), I eat immediately, but then I'm stuck.\n\nIf I move L or R, I can eat (3,4) or (5,3) soon.\n\nFor example, with move L at turn 4 to (4,5), then D to (4,4) at turn 5, then L to (3,4) at turn 6 to eat, or to (5,4) and then D to (5,3) at turn 7.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving L to (3,4) at turn 6 eats (3,4), which is closer.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), value 1.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,3) or (1,1) etc.\n\nFood at (5,6) can be eaten later, for example, from (3,4), I can move to (3,5), (4,5), etc., to (5,5) then U to (5,6).\n\nBut when I go to (5,5), if the snake is longer, I need to ensure the path is clear.\n\nSince the snake is short now, it's easier to maneuver.\n\nSimilarly, the internal obstacle at (5,2) blocks the column at x=5 for y=2, so to go to (5,1), I need to go around, but (5,1) has life 10, plenty of time.\n\nPriority is long-term survival and eating multiple food.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nFirst, avoid the corner for now.\n\nSo at turn 4, do not move U to (5,6), instead move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\nBy symmetry, let's choose L to (4,5) to go towards (3,4).\n\nSo turn 4: move L to (4,5)\n\nSnake at (4,5), direction L, length 1.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\nNow, (3,5) has no food, (4,6) has no food, (4,4) no food.\n\nI want to go to (3,4) which is at (3,4), so down and left.\n\nSo moving D to (4,4) is a step towards it.\n\nMove D to (4,4).\n\nThen at (4,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\n(3,4) has food, so move L to (3,4) to eat.\n\nEat (3,4), grow to length 2, positions [(3,4), (4,4)], direction L.\n\nNow, life span of (3,4) was 7 at turn 4, at turn 6, it was eaten, so fine.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food.\n\nAvailable food: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,1)\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), (5,3) at (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), head at (3,4), body at (4,4).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, cannot move R to body cell.\n\nMove R to (4,4) would be collision.\n\nSo only U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\nAll empty, no food.\n\nSay I want to go to (5,3) or (5,6).\n\n(5,3) is closer.\n\nTo reach (5,3), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut from (3,4), moving R is not possible directly.\n\nSo move D to (3,3) or U to (3,5), or L to (2,4).\n\nMove D to (3,3) to go down.\n\nTurn 6: after eating at (3,4), positions [(3,4), (4,4)], dir L.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3). Head to (3,3), then tail moves to (3,4)? Positions: before move, head (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nMove head to (3,3), then tail moves to where head was, (3,4). So new positions: head at (3,3), tail at (3,4).\n\nNo food at (3,3), so length still 2.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,3), dir D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) might be wall? y=2, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), (4,3).\n\nNo food.\n\nI need to go right to x=5.\n\nSo move R to (4,3).\n\nHead to (4,3), tail to (3,3), positions [(4,3), (3,3)], direction R.\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,3), dir R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) has food! Life span at turn 4 was 6, at turn 9: from turn 4 to turn 9 is 5 turns, so life span decreased by 5, from 6 to 1, so available at turn 9.\n\nMove R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nEat (5,3), grow to length 3, positions: head to (5,3), and since ate, tail stays, so new head at (5,3), body at (4,3), tail at (3,3)? Before move, positions [(4,3), (3,3)]\n\nMove head to (5,3), eat food, so new segment: head at (5,3), the previous head (4,3) becomes body, and tail at (3,3) remains, but since ate, the tail does not move, so positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (3,3) — so [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nFrom here, I can go to other food, like (5,1) or (5,6), but (5,6) is up.\n\nBut obstacle at (5,2), so I cannot go down to (5,2), wall.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but wall, not possible, L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision, R to (6,3).\n\nSo only U or R: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nSay move U to (5,4), positions: head to (5,4), then body segments move: the segment that was at (5,3) moves to where head was? Positions before: index 0: (5,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3)\n\nAfter move U to (5,4): new head at (5,4), then index 1 (was (5,3)) moves to (5,3)? No: each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSegment at index 1 ( (4,3) ) moves to where index 0 was, which is (5,3).\n\nSegment at index 2 ( (3,3) ) moves to where index 1 was, which is (4,3).\n\nSo new positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), body (4,3)? Indices: [0] (5,4), [1] (5,3), [2] (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nNow, (5,4) is empty, no food.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I have eaten two food: (3,4) and (5,3), score +2.\n\nNow, about (5,6): at turn 9, it is still available, life span 6 at turn 4, at turn 9 life span 1, so available, but I need to go to it.\n\nFrom current position, say at (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nBack to turn 4, if I had moved U to (5,6), I would have eaten one food but been stuck.\n\nWith the other move, I can eat multiple.\n\nBut I missed (5,6) so far.\n\nAt turn 4, if I move R to (6,5), similar to moving L but on the right, but there is no food on the right, only (5,6) and (5,3) symmetric, but (3,4) is on left, so moving L is better to reach (3,4).\n\n(1,1) is also on left.\n\nSo moving L at turn 4 seems better.\n\nNow, what about the immediate reward: if I move U at turn 4, I eat (5,6) now, but with risk, and I might not eat others easily.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), after moving L or R, I am at (4,6) or (6,6), then I need to go down to reach (3,4) or (5,3), which is farther.\n\nFor instance, from (4,6), move D to (4,5), then to (4,4), etc., to (3,4), but it takes more turns.\n\nWhereas from (4,5) directly, I can reach (3,4) in two moves: turn 4 to (4,5), turn 5 to (4,4) or directly? From (4,5) to (3,4) is not adjacent; (4,5) to (3,4) is diagonal, not allowed, only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo from (4,5) to (3,4): one move left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), or down to (4,4) then left to (3,4).\n\nTwo moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,6), it takes more to reach other food.\n\nMoreover, (5,6) might be eaten later.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can eat (5,6) later.\n\nFor example, in the path above, after eating (5,3) at turn 9, I can go up to (5,4), then (5,5), then (5,6) at turn 10 or something.\n\nBut at turn 9, (5,6) life span: at turn 4 life 6, so at turn 9, life span should be 6 - (9-4) = 6-5=1, so available at turn 9.\n\nIf I move to (5,6) on turn 10, but life span decreases each turn, so at turn 9, it is present, after turn 9, it disappears? Life span N at turn t, disappears after N turns, so at turn t+N.\n\nAt turn 4, life 6, disappears after 6 turns, so at turn 10 it is gone.\n\nAvailable on turns 4 to 9 inclusive.\n\nTurn 10 it is not present.\n\nSo to eat (5,6), I must move onto it on or before turn 9.\n\nIn the path: at turn 9, I am eating (5,3) at (5,3), so on turn 9, I am at (5,3), cannot reach (5,6) on same turn.\n\nTurn 10, (5,6) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,6) if I don't go there early.\n\nIn this plan, by not eating (5,6) at turn 4, I miss it.\n\nBut I ate (3,4) and (5,3), two food, whereas if I eat (5,6) at turn 4, I have one, and then I might eat others.\n\nBut with (5,6) eaten, I have length 2, and can try to eat (3,4) or (5,3).\n\nFor example, from turn 4: move U to (5,6), eat, positions [(5,6),(5,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,6) (assume), positions [(4,6),(5,6)]\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6), can move L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n\nSay move D to (4,5), positions [(4,5),(4,6)]? Head to (4,5), tail to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5), direction D (since moved down), cannot move U.\n\nMove D to (4,4), positions [(4,4),(4,5)]\n\nThen turn 8: from (4,4), dir D, move L to (3,4) to eat, but (3,4) has food.\n\nAt turn 8, (3,4) life: at turn 4 life 7, so at turn 8, 7-4=3? Decreases each turn: turn 4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, turn7:4, turn8:3, so available.\n\nMove to (3,4), eat, grow to length 3, positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,5)? Before move: positions [(4,4),(4,5)]\n\nMove head to (3,4), eat, so new head (3,4), the previous head (4,4) becomes body, tail at (4,5) remains, so positions [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nThen I have eaten two food: (5,6) and (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (5,3) later.\n\nBut in the first plan without eating (5,6), I ate (3,4) and (5,3), also two, and missed (5,6).\n\nIn both cases, I can eat two food by turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut in the first plan, I missed (5,6), in the second I ate it.\n\nBut (5,6) is one food, same as others.\n\nHowever, in the second plan, after eating (5,6), I was at corner, but I managed to escape and eat (3,4).\n\nBut it took more turns: from turn 4 to turn 8 to eat second food, whereas in the first plan, I ate (3,4) at turn 6 and (5,3) at turn 9.\n\nTurn 6 and turn 9.\n\nBut turn 9 is later.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after eating (5,6) early, I was in a tighter spot.\n\nAlso, there is (5,1) with long life, I can eat later.\n\nBut let's see the answer format: I need to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for current turn and future turns? The answer format is to output actions from turn t1 onwards for several turns.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nSo I need to specify a sequence of actions, starting from turn 4.\n\nBut I don't know the full future, so I need to plan a short sequence based on the state.\n\nPerhaps for the next few turns to set up for eating food.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan a path.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 4, since (5,6) is above, and I can eat it, but to avoid being stuck, I can eat it and immediately move away.\n\nBut from (5,6), I have to move L or R.\n\nSay move L to (4,6), then I can go down.\n\nBut as above.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (5,6) later without missing it.\n\nAt turn 4, if I move not U, but L or R, then from there, I can go to (5,6) before turn 10.\n\nFor example, at turn 4 move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5 move U to (4,6)  -- but (4,6) is adjacent to (5,6)\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,5), snake at (4,5), dir L.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5), dir L, can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\nMove U to (4,6), positions [(4,6)], length 1, dir U (since moved up).\n\n(4,6) has no food.\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,6), dir U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,6), R to (5,6), U not possible (wall).\n\n(5,6) has food, so move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nEat (5,6), grow to length 2, positions [(5,6), (4,6)], dir R.\n\nThen from here, same as before, I can move D to (5,5) but cannot, reverse not allowed, dir is R, so down is perpendicular, but moving D to (5,5) is possible, but (5,5) is empty.\n\nMove D to (5,5), positions: head to (5,5), tail to (5,6)? Before: head (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nMove head to (5,5), then tail moves to (5,6), so positions [(5,5), (5,6)]\n\nThen I am at (5,5) with body at (5,6), and I can go to other food.\n\nAnd I ate (5,6) at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (3,4) or (5,3).\n\nFor example, from (5,5), move L to (4,5), etc.\n\nIn this case, I ate (5,6) at turn 6, not at turn 4, and I am not immediately stuck because I can move from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5) with positions [(5,5), (5,6)], head at (5,5), dir L (if moved left).\n\nThen I can move U not, wall? (5,6) is above, but U from (5,5) to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision.\n\nD to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nSo possible D, L, R.\n\nMove D to (5,4), etc.\n\nSo this seems better than eating at turn 4.\n\nBy moving to (4,6) first, then to (5,6), I eat later but have more flexibility.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,4) afterwards.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nAt turn 4, move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5, move U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 6, move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the food life spans are long, so I can be flexible.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the food that might expire soon, but all have similar life except (5,1) with 10.\n\n(5,6) and (5,3) have life 6, (3,4) life 7, (1,1) life 6, (5,1) life 10.\n\n(1,1) life 6 at turn 4, same as others.\n\nBut (1,1) is far, so I might not reach it soon.\n\nIn the short term, eating (5,6) and then (3,4) or (5,3).\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nAt turn 4, move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5, move U to (4,6)  -- to position for eating (5,6)\n\nTurn 6, move R to (5,6) to eat\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,6) with body at (4,6), positions [(5,6), (4,6)], dir R.\n\nNow, cannot move L (reverse), cannot move U (wall), can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nMove D to (5,5), as above.\n\nPositions: head to (5,5), tail to (5,6), so [(5,5), (5,6)]\n\nDir D.\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), dir D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nSay move D to (5,4) to go down towards (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) has food, but at (5,4), I can move to (5,3) next.\n\nBut obstacle at (5,2), so (5,3) is safe.\n\nFrom (5,4), move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 8, from (5,5) move D to (5,4), positions: head to (5,4), tail to (5,5), so [(5,4), (5,5)]\n\nDir D.\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,4), dir D, move D to (5,3) to eat, but (5,3) has food, eat, grow to length 3, positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5)? Before: [(5,4), (5,5)]\n\nMove head to (5,3), eat, so new head (5,3), previous head (5,4) becomes body, tail (5,5) remains, so positions [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (5,3), dir D.\n\nThen from here, as before, only U or R or L, but L to (4,3), R to (6,3), U to (5,4) but body, collision, so only L or R.\n\nAnd D to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo I can move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (5,6) at turn 6 and (5,3) at turn 9.\n\n(5,3) at turn 9 is ok, life span 6 at turn 4, at turn 9 life 1, available.\n\nI missed (3,4), but I can go to it later if possible.\n\n(3,4) life 7 at turn 4, at turn 9: 7-5=2, so available until turn 10? Turn 4:7, turn5:6, ..., turn9:2, turn10:1, so at turn 10, if life 1, available, disappears after turn 10, so at turn 11 gone.\n\nI can reach (3,4) from (4,3) for example.\n\nBut let's stop here for the sequence.\n\nSince the snake is at (5,3) with body, it might be harder.\n\nBut I have eaten two food.\n\nIn the first alternative, I could have eaten (3,4) earlier.\n\nBut for now, with this sequence, at turn 4, move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5, move U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 6, move R to (5,6) eat\n\nThen turn 7, move D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 8, move D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 9, move D to (5,3) eat\n\nBut at turn 9, move D to (5,3) from (5,4), which is fine.\n\nBut after that, I need to move away.\n\nBut for the output, I can output up to turn 8 or 9.\n\nThe state is turn 4, so I can output actions for turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut let's see if I can include (3,4).\n\nAt turn 4, move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5, move D to (4,4)  -- as in the first plan\n\nTurn 6, move L to (3,4) eat\n\nThen turn 7, move D to (3,3) or other.\n\nThen I can go to (5,3) but it might be tight for (5,6).\n\nFrom (3,4), at turn 6, I can move U to (3,5) then R to (4,5), etc., to (5,5) then U to (5,6) at turn 8 or 9.\n\nFor example, turn 6: after eating (3,4), positions [(3,4),(4,4)], dir L.\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5), positions: head to (3,5), tail to (3,4), so [(3,5),(3,4)]\n\nDir U.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,5), dir U, move R to (4,5), positions [(4,5),(3,5)]\n\nDir R.\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5), dir R, move R to (5,5), positions [(5,5),(4,5)]\n\nDir R.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) to eat, but at turn 9, (5,6) is available, life 1.\n\nMove U to (5,6), eat, grow to length 3, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (4,5)? Before: [(5,5),(4,5)]\n\nMove head to (5,6), eat, so new head (5,6), previous head (5,5) becomes body, tail (4,5) remains, so [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nThen I ate (3,4) and (5,6), and (5,3) is still there, but I didn't eat it yet.\n\n(5,3) can be eaten later.\n\nIn this case, I ate two food by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in both sequences, I can achieve two food.\n\nBut in the first sequence with moving to (4,6) first, I ate (5,6) and (5,3), in second I ate (3,4) and (5,6).\n\n(5,3) and (3,4) are both valuable.\n\nBut (5,3) has an obstacle below, but I managed.\n\nNow, for the initial choice, at turn 4, moving L seems better than moving U directly to (5,6).\n\nMoving R to (6,5) is similar but no food on right, so left is better for (3,4).\n\nSo I think move L at turn 4.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: D (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 6: L (to (3,4) eat)\n\nThen continue.\n\nOr with the other approach.\n\nSince the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", avoiding the corner at (5,6) immediately might be better.\n\nAlso, in the tail reward danger, with short snake, not an issue.\n\nSo I think moving L at turn 4 is safer.\n\nThen I can go to (3,4) to eat soon.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,4)  // to approach (3,4)\n\nTurn 6: L to (3,4) eat // eat (3,4)\n\nThen for future, I can move to other places.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify several turns.\n\nLet's say up to turn 8.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4) with body at (4,4), move D to (3,3) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nI think outputting 3 or 4 actions is fine.\n\nThe format says \"...\" so I can do as many as I want, but probably for 5 turns ahead.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nTurn 4,5,6,7,8: 5 actions.\n\nLet's define a sequence.\n\nAt turn 4: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4) eat\n\nNow at positions [(3,4), (4,4)], dir L.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)  // down to open space\n\nPositions: head to (3,3), tail to (3,4), so [(3,3), (3,4)]\n\nDir D.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), dir D, move R to (4,3)  // towards center or to (5,3)\n\nPositions [(4,3), (3,3)]\n\nDir R.\n\nThen I can continue to (5,3) later.\n\nBut (5,3) can be eaten if I go there.\n\nAt turn 8, (5,3) is available.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nBut not in this sequence.\n\nI think this is reasonable.\n\nTo include eating (5,6), but I might not have time.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must avoid immediate risks and plan a sequence that allows for eating multiple positive food items over the next 5+ turns. The current state (turn 4) has the snake at position (5,5) with head direction \"U\" (up), and the snake length is 1 (only the head). Key constraints include:\n- Cannot move opposite to the current direction (no \"D\" on turn 4).\n- Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2), so these cells are deadly.\n- All food is positive (value +1), with positions and remaining life spans: (1,1) life 6, (5,3) life 6, (5,6) life 6, (3,4) life 7, (5,1) life 10.\n- Food at (5,6) is adjacent but eating it immediately risks trapping the snake in the top row (y=6) with limited escape routes, potentially leading to a dead end. Avoiding this corner early supports long-term survival.\n- Food at (3,4) is reachable in 2 moves and has a longer life span (7 turns), making it a safer early target. Eating it first allows the snake to grow and maintain mobility.\n- After eating (3,4), the snake can navigate toward (5,3) or other food, avoiding the obstacle at (5,2).\n\nThe plan for turns 4-8 focuses on:\n- Turn 4: Move left (\"L\") to (4,5) to avoid the risky (5,6) food and position for accessing (3,4).\n- Turn 5: Move down (\"D\") to (4,4) to approach (3,4) directly.\n- Turn 6: Move left (\"L\") to (3,4) to eat the food, growing to length 2. This is safe with life span 7 at turn 4; it remains available until turn 10.\n- Turn 7: Move down (\"D\") to (3,3) to open space and avoid potential body collisions as the snake grows.\n- Turn 8: Move right (\"R\") to (4,3) to center the snake and prepare for future moves toward (5,3) or other food.\n\nThis sequence eats one food ( (3,4) ) by turn 6, avoids the (5,6) corner risk, and keeps the snake in open areas for flexibility. Food at (5,3) (life 6 at turn 4, available until turn 9) can be targeted after turn 8, and (5,1) has ample time (life 10). Survival is prioritized by steering clear of walls, obstacles, and tight spaces.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 4: Move left (\"L\") to (4,5). This avoids the immediate risk of (5,6) and aligns with the path to (3,4).\n- Turn 5: Move down (\"D\") to (4,4). Direction is now \"D\", enabling a direct move to (3,4) next turn.\n- Turn 6: Move left (\"L\") to (3,4). Eat food here (value +1), growing to length 2. New positions: head (3,4), tail (4,4).\n- Turn 7: Move down (\"D\") to (3,3). This moves away from the body segment at (4,4) and avoids reverse move issues. New positions: head (3,3), tail (3,4).\n- Turn 8: Move right (\"R\") to (4,3). This heads toward the center for better access to remaining food like (5,3). New positions: head (4,3), tail (3,3).\n\nBeyond turn 8, the snake can consider eating (5,3) by moving right to (5,3) on turn 9 (if life span allows) or navigating to other food, but this sequence ensures survival and sets up for high score potential.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: L\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: L\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 5, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. My goal is to maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nHere are the key details:\n\n- **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake has only one segment at (4,5). That means the snake is just the head right now, since there's only one position listed. So length is 1.\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving left (L). So from (4,5), moving left would go to (3,5).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Since it's turn 5, this food will disappear after 5 turns, so at turn 10 (life span decreases each turn, including current, so from turn 5 to 10 is 6 turns? Life span is 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, meaning it will be gone on turn 10. Let me clarify: \"life_span\" is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for food at turn t with life span N, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for N turns, from turn t to turn t + N - 1. For example, if N=5 at turn 5, it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see:\n\n- At turn 5, life span is 5, so it decreases to 4 at turn 6, to 3 at turn 7, to 2 at turn 8, to 1 at turn 9, and gone at turn 10. So it disappears after turn 9, meaning it's not there on turn 10. But \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. I think it's better to think: countdown starts at N, decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, countdown is N; at turn t+1, countdown N-1; ... at turn t + N - 1, countdown 1; then at turn t + N, it's gone. So for food at (1,1): turn 5, life span 5, so it will be gone after turn 9, meaning available from turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood list:\n- (1,1): value 1, life span 5 (available turns 5-9)\n- (5,3): value 1, life span 5 (turns 5-9)\n- (5,6): value 1, life span 5 (turns 5-9)\n- (3,4): value 1, life span 6 (turns 5-10, since at turn 5:6, turn6:5, ..., turn10:1, gone at turn11? Life span 6 at turn 5: available turns 5 to 10, gone at turn 11.\n- (5,1): value 1, life span 9 (turns 5 to 13)\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given, and for negative food it would be -1, but here all are 1, so all positive. And life span varies.\n\nNow, snake positions: [(4,5)] – that's a list with one element, so the snake has only the head, no body. So length is 1. When it eats food, it will grow.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so moving left.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is L, I can move L (continue left), or U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from L, I can go L, U, or D, but not R.\n\nNow, the grid: walls at borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake at (4,5), so coordinates: (4,5)\n\nI need to think 5 turns ahead, so plan moves for turns 5,6,7,8,9, etc., but the answer should start from turn 5 action, then turn 6, and so on, for at least 5 turns? The answer format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and it should be multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to provide actions for the next few turns, at least 5, but probably until a logical point.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I should plan a path that maximizes score while avoiding death.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid mentally.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7 inclusive, but walls occupy x=0 and x=7, so snake cannot be at x=0 or x=7. Similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls. So valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (5,2), which is within 1-6,1-6.\n\nSo cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6. Except (5,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nSnake at (4,5), head moving left.\n\nFood at:\n- (1,1)\n- (5,3)\n- (5,6)\n- (3,4)\n- (5,1)\n\nAll with value 1.\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating any food will increase length to 2, and the new segment will be added when it eats, so after eating, the tail is where the head was when it ate, I think. Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays until you move, but in terms of movement, when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n\nRule says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAnd for collision: head touches body, but when moving, if head moves to a cell with body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell, because tail will move away.\n\nBut since snake is length 1, there is no body, only head. So no collision risk yet.\n\nAlso, food can be under body, but since no body, not an issue.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But with length 1, tail is head, so not applicable yet.\n\nFirst, I need to move from (4,5).\n\nPossible moves from (4,5) with current direction L:\n- Left (L) to (3,5)\n- Up (U) to (4,6)\n- Down (D) to (4,4)\n\nCannot go right to (5,5) because opposite direction.\n\nNow, let's see nearby food.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is left and down from (4,5)? From (4,5) to (3,4) is diagonally, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, one cell away.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4) or (3,5), but not directly to (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), adjacent cells: (3,5) left, (5,5) right but invalid move, (4,6) up, (4,4) down.\n\n(3,4) is not adjacent to (4,5); it's one away diagonally.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is at (5,3), (5,6) at (5,6), etc.\n\n(3,4) is close; from (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), then (3,4) is left from (4,4).\n\nIf I go left to (3,5), then (3,4) is down from (3,5).\n\nOther food: (1,1) far, (5,3) near but x=5,y=3, (5,6) at (5,6), (5,1) at (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is near the obstacle at (5,2), but (5,2) is wall, so (5,1) might be accessible? y=1 is border, but y=1 is a wall row? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle (5,2).\n\nSo (5,1): x=5, y=1, y=1 is not y=0, so it should be playable, as long as not wall. y=1 is within 1 to 6, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) at (5,3), (5,6) at (5,6), which is y=6, not y=7, so playable.\n\nNow, life spans: I need to prioritize food that will disappear soon, but all have similar life except (5,1) has longer.\n\nBut all value 1, so equal reward.\n\nSince snake is short, I can go for nearest food.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is close to (4,5). Distance: |4-3| + |5-4| = 1+1=2, so two moves away.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (3,5) or (4,4), both one step from (3,4).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (4,5) is |5-4| + |3-5| =1+2=3, or via path.\n\n(5,6) at (5,6), |5-4| + |6-5| =1+1=2, so also close.\n\n(5,6) is up from (5,5), but (5,5) is empty? Let's list.\n\nCurrent position (4,5).\n\nIf I go up to (4,6), then (5,6) is right from (4,6), so two moves: turn 5 to (4,6), turn 6 to (5,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (4,4), then to (3,4) to eat at turn 6? Turn 5 to (4,4), then turn 6 to (3,4) to eat.\n\nIf I go left to (3,5), then to (3,4) to eat at turn 6.\n\n(5,3) is farther; from (4,5), to (5,5) but I can't go right directly, so I need to go to (4,6) or (4,4) first, then to (5,6) or (5,4), but (5,4) is empty? (5,4) might be free.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), so from (4,5) I can go down to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then down to (5,3), but that's three moves.\n\nSince direction is L, if I go down to (4,4), then I can go right to (5,4) or left to (3,4), etc.\n\nI need to think about the path and risks.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so I need to avoid self-collision.\n\nCurrently no body, so after first eat, length 2, then I have to be careful.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut for now, not applicable.\n\nLet's list all food and their expiration:\n\n- (1,1): life span 5 at turn 5, so available turns 5,6,7,8,9 (disappears after turn 9, gone turn 10)\n\n- (5,3): life span 5, available turns 5-9\n\n- (5,6): life span 5, available turns 5-9\n\n- (3,4): life span 6, available turns 5-10 (since at turn 5:6, turn10:1, gone turn11)\n\n- (5,1): life span 9, available turns 5-13\n\n(3,4) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\n(1,1) is far, at (1,1), which is corner, so I might not go there immediately.\n\n(5,6) and (3,4) are close.\n\n(5,3) is also close but near the obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,3) is above it.\n\n(5,1) is below it, but y=1 is playable.\n\nNow, from (4,5), I can:\n\nOption 1: Go left to (3,5) at turn 5.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) to eat the food at turn 6, since (3,4) has food.\n\nAfter eating, length becomes 2, head at (3,4), tail at (3,5)? When snake eats, on the turn it moves to food, it eats and grows, so the new tail is added, but for movement, the tail doesn't move that turn, so positions: after turn 5, if I move to (3,5), snake is at [(3,5)], still length 1.\n\nThen turn 6, move to (3,4), which has food, so eat, snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (3,4), body at (3,5). So snake: [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nThen direction: I moved down to (3,4), so head direction is D.\n\nNow, from there, I need to move to avoid colliding with body.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4) with direction D: can go D (down), L (left), R (right), but not U (up) because opposite to D.\n\nU would be up, which is opposite to down, so cannot.\n\nSo can go down to (3,3), left to (2,4), or right to (4,4).\n\n(3,3) might be free, (2,4), (4,4).\n\nNo food directly adjacent, I think.\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is to the right and down.\n\nFrom (3,4), to (4,4) then (5,4) then (5,3), but (5,4) is empty? Or is there food? No.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is up.\n\nBut with direction D, if I go right to (4,4), then I can go up or down, etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think 5 turns.\n\nFirst, back to turn 5.\n\nOption 2: Go down to (4,4) at turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go left to (3,4) to eat at turn 6, since (3,4) has food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,4), body at (4,4)? Positions: after turn 5 move to (4,4), snake [(4,4)] length 1.\n\nTurn 6 move to (3,4) and eat, snake [(3,4), (4,4)], head direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (3,4), with direction L, can go L (left), U (up), D (down), not R (right).\n\nCan go left to (2,4), up to (3,5), down to (3,3).\n\n(3,5) is where the tail is? Tail is at (4,4), which is not adjacent; (3,5) is above, not same cell.\n\nNo immediate issue.\n\nOption 3: Go up to (4,6) at turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go right to (5,6) to eat at turn 6, since (5,6) has food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (5,6), body at (4,6), length 2, head direction R.\n\nThen from (5,6), can go R (right), U (up), D (down), not L (left).\n\nBut x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable? x from 1 to 6, x=6 is valid, x=7 wall.\n\ny=6 valid, y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (5,6), can go right to (6,6), up to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, down to (5,5), left to (4,6) but body is at (4,6), so if go left to (4,6), it would collide with body.\n\nImportant: after eating, body at (4,6), head at (5,6). If I go left to (4,6), head moves to (4,6) which is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go left from (5,6); must go right or down.\n\nRight to (6,6) or down to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) might be free.\n\nNow, comparing the options for first move.\n\nAll three options allow me to eat food at turn 6: either (3,4), (3,4), or (5,6).\n\n(3,4) can be eaten via left or down first, (5,6) via up first.\n\n(5,3) is not eaten immediately.\n\nI need to think which one is better for long-term.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,6) has life span 5, available turns 5-9, so can be eaten later, but since I can eat it at turn 6, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly (3,4) has longer life.\n\nBut all positive, so eating any is good.\n\nNow, after eating, the situation differs.\n\nFirst, if I go for (3,4) by moving left to (3,5) at turn 5, then down to (3,4) at turn 6 to eat.\n\nAfter that, snake at [(3,4), (3,5)], head direction D.\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,4), with direction D, can go D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4). Cannot go U to (3,5) because body is there, and it's not tail? Tail is at (3,5), and head is at (3,4), so if I go up to (3,5), it would be moving to tail cell, but since tail will move, it might be ok, but rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I go up to (3,5), and tail is there, but after move, head moves to (3,5), and tail moves away? When head moves, the body follows, so tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if snake is [head, body1, body2, ... tail], after move, new head at new position, body1 at old head, body2 at old body1, ..., tail at the position of the second last segment.\n\nIn this case, after turn 6, snake: positions [(3,4) head, (3,5) tail]\n\nTurn 7, if I move head to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied by tail. When head moves to (3,5), the tail will move to where? The tail was at (3,5), and since it's only one body segment, after head moves to new position, tail moves to the old head position, which is (3,4).\n\nBut at the moment of move, head is moving to (3,5) which is occupied by tail, but since tail is moving away, it's allowed, and no collision.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't move to tail, it's also fine.\n\nIn this case, from (3,4) with direction D, I can go U to (3,5) safely, since tail is there and will move.\n\nOr D to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nIf at turn 5 I go down to (4,4), then turn 6 to (3,4) eat, snake at [(3,4), (4,4)], head direction L.\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,4), direction L, can go L to (2,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3), not R to (4,4) because body is there, and it's not tail? Tail is at (4,4), so moving right to (4,4) would be to tail cell, which is allowed since tail will move.\n\nIf I move right to (4,4), head to (4,4), tail moves to (3,4)? Positions: before move, head (3,4), tail (4,4). After move head to (4,4), tail moves to old head position (3,4). So head and tail swap positions, no issue.\n\nIf I go for (5,6): turn 5 up to (4,6), turn 6 right to (5,6) eat, snake at [(5,6), (4,6)], head direction R.\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,6), direction R, can go R to (6,6), D to (5,5), not L to (4,6) because body is there, and moving left to (4,6) would collide since body is there and not moving away yet? Tail is at (4,6), so moving to (4,6) is to tail cell, allowed.\n\nBut (4,6) is tail, so moving to it is safe.\n\nCan go down to (5,5) or right to (6,6).\n\nNow, to think long-term, I should consider which food to eat first and then plan for next.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,3) which is below, and (5,1) below.\n\n(5,3) has short life, available only until turn 9.\n\n(3,4) has until turn 10.\n\n(5,6) until turn 9.\n\n(1,1) until turn 9.\n\n(5,1) longer.\n\nAfter eating one food, I have length 2, and I can eat another.\n\nFor example, if I eat (3,4) first, then I can go towards (5,3) or (5,6).\n\nSimilarly if I eat (5,6) first, I can go to (5,3) or (3,4).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is near the obstacle (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is wall, so (5,3) is accessible, but moving around there might be tricky.\n\nFor instance, from (5,3), I can go up, down, left, right, but right to (6,3), left to (4,3), down to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so cannot go down, up to (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) at (5,1), can go up to (5,2) but wall, so only left, right, up? y=1, down to (5,0) wall, so only up, left, right.\n\nBut (5,2) wall, so from (5,1), can go to (4,1), (6,1), or (5,2) invalid, so only left/right, or up to (5,2) invalid, so only horizontal at y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at y=6, up to y=7 invalid.\n\nNow, back to turn 5 decision.\n\nLet's think about the grid layout.\n\nI should simulate the path for 5 turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the actions for 5 turns, from turn 5 to turn 9 or 10.\n\nSince food expires, I need to eat soon.\n\n(5,6) and (3,4) are both good options.\n\n(5,3) is also close but might be riskier.\n\nLet's consider going for (5,6) first.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6) and eat, now snake [(5,6), (4,6)], length 2, direction R.\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), with direction R, I can go R to (6,6) or D to (5,5). Cannot go L to (4,6) because it's occupied by body, but it's tail, so allowed, but let's see if it's good.\n\nIf I go L to (4,6), head to (4,6), which is current tail position, then tail moves to (5,6), so snake becomes [(4,6), (5,6)] but head at (4,6), body at (5,6), and direction L.\n\nBut (4,6) has no food, so not eating.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut perhaps better to go to (6,6) or (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is empty, I think.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (5,4) or (6,5), etc.\n\nThere is food at (5,3) below.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I go D to (5,5) at turn 7.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction D, can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5), U to (5,6) but body at (4,6) or where? Snake after turn 7: if head to (5,5), tail from (4,6) moves to (5,6)? Positions: before turn 7, head (5,6), tail (4,6).\n\nAfter move head to (5,5), tail moves to (5,6). So snake [(5,5), (5,6)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5), not U to (5,6) because body is there.\n\nBut (5,6) is tail, so moving up to (5,6) is allowed, since tail will move.\n\nIf I go D to (5,4), then to (5,3) to eat at turn 9? (5,3) has food.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) to (5,4) (direction D or whatever).\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,5), snake [(5,5), (5,6)]\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), go D to (5,4), now snake head at (5,4), body at (5,5), tail at (5,6) moved to (5,5)? After move, head to (5,4), body segment (which was head) at (5,5) moves to where head was, so body at (5,5), and tail at (5,6) moves to where body was, which is (5,5), but (5,5) is now occupied? No: positions before move: head (5,5), body (5,6) — since length 2, body is also tail.\n\nBefore turn 8: positions [(5,5), (5,6)] with (5,5) head, (5,6) tail.\n\nMove head to new position, say (5,4). Then new head at (5,4), and the body segment (tail) moves to the previous position of the head, which is (5,5). So new snake: [(5,4), (5,5)]\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\n(5,4) has no food, I think.\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), can go to (5,3) to eat, since (5,3) has food.\n\nMove to (5,3), eat, snake grows to length 3: head at (5,3), body at (5,4), tail at (5,5)? When eat, on the turn you move to food, you eat and the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nTurn 9: move head to (5,3), which has food, so eat, new head at (5,3), the body is the previous head (5,4), and since ate, a new tail segment is added at the previous tail position, but tail was at (5,5), and it doesn't move, so new positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5). Length 3.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, from (5,3), with direction D, can go D to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, invalid. L to (4,3), R to (6,3), U to (5,4) but body at (5,4), so if go up, to (5,4) occupied by body, collision.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" except if it's the tail and you move to it, but here (5,4) is body, not tail, tail is at (5,5).\n\nSo moving to (5,4) would be collision.\n\nCannot go U.\n\nCan go L to (4,3) or R to (6,3) or D invalid.\n\nSo must go left or right.\n\nSay go left to (4,3).\n\nThen safe.\n\nBut (5,3) food is eaten at turn 9, which is within its life span (5-9).\n\nSimilarly, I could have eaten earlier.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (5,6) at turn 6 and (5,3) at turn 9.\n\nNow, what about other food? (3,4) is still available until turn 10, but I'm at (4,3) or something, far.\n\n(1,1) and (5,1) available.\n\nBut let's see the first option with (3,4).\n\nAlternative: go for (3,4) first.\n\nSay at turn 5, move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4) and eat, snake [(3,4), (3,5)], head direction D.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), with direction D, can go D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), or U to (3,5) but body at (3,5), which is tail, so can go U safely.\n\nIf go D to (3,3), for example.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (5,3) or other.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (3,3) I can go right to (4,3), (5,3), but (4,3) may be free.\n\nTurn 7: move to (3,3), snake now [(3,3), (3,4)] head at (3,3), body at (3,4), tail at (3,5) moved to (3,4).\n\nAfter move to (3,3), head (3,3), body (3,4), tail was (3,5) moved to (3,4)? Before move: head (3,4), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,3), new head (3,3), body segment moves to old head (3,4), tail moves to old body (3,4), but since only one body, tail moves to (3,4). So snake [(3,3), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), go R to (4,3) for example, direction now R? Moved right, so direction R.\n\nThen snake head (4,3), body (3,3), etc.\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,3) go R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nMove to (5,3), eat, grow to length 3: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (3,3)? When eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), and new tail at previous tail position (3,3), so snake [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen from (5,3), same as before, cannot go down to wall, cannot go up to (5,4) if occupied, but (5,4) may be free, in this case body at (4,3) and (3,3), so (5,4) free.\n\nCan go up to (5,4), or left to (4,3) but body there, collision, or right to (6,3), etc.\n\nGo up to (5,4).\n\nBut I need to think about the internal obstacle.\n\nAnother option: at turn 5, go down to (4,4), then turn 6 to (3,4) eat, similar.\n\nBut (4,4) to (3,4) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (3,4), direction L, can go L, U, D.\n\nIf go down to (3,3), etc.\n\nSimilar to above.\n\nNow, compare to going for (5,6) first.\n\nIn (5,6) first path, I ate at turn 6 and turn 9.\n\nIn (3,4) first, I ate at turn 6 and turn 9.\n\nSame number.\n\nBut in (3,4) first, when I go to (5,3), I might be able to eat (5,1) later or something.\n\nBut (5,1) has long life.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1) which I might not reach soon.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the risk.\n\nIn the (5,6) first path, when I was at (5,3) with length 3, I was trapped a bit, but could go left or right.\n\nSimilarly in other.\n\nAnother food: (5,6) I ate early, but (3,4) is still available.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat two foods by turn 9.\n\nBut in the first path with (5,6), I ate (5,6) and (5,3), both at x=5.\n\nIn second, (3,4) and (5,3).\n\nNow, (5,1) is at (5,1), which is below, but with obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (5,1), I need to go to (5,1) from above or side, but since (5,2) wall, I can only approach from left or right at y=1.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nBut currently, after eating (5,3), I might be at (5,4) or elsewhere.\n\nAlso, (1,1) is at corner.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, and prioritize survival, I should choose a path that avoids dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area near (5,1) might be risky because of the wall and obstacle.\n\n(5,2) wall, so cells around: (5,1) can only be accessed from (4,1) or (6,1), and from (5,1), I can only go to (4,1), (6,1), or up but (5,2) wall, so no up, only left/right.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (5,0) invalid.\n\nSo (5,1) is a bit dangerous because limited moves.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) corner, can only go up or right.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, but I might not go there.\n\nNow for turn 5 decision, let's see which first move allows better access to multiple foods.\n\nIf I go up to (4,6), I can eat (5,6) at turn 6.\n\nIf I go left to (3,5), eat (3,4) at turn 6.\n\nIf I go down to (4,4), also eat (3,4) at turn 6.\n\n(4,4) to (3,4) is left.\n\nBut from (4,4), if I go down to (4,4) at turn 5, then to (3,4) at turn 6.\n\nCompared to going left to (3,5) then down.\n\nSlightly different position.\n\nBut after eating, in both cases head at (3,4).\n\nWith (3,5) first, when I move down to (3,4), direction D.\n\nWith (4,4) first, move left to (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,4), the possible moves are the same, but the direction affects what reverse is.\n\nFor example, if direction D, I cannot go U immediately, etc.\n\nBut since I can go other directions, it might not matter much.\n\nPerhaps going for (5,6) is better because it's closer to (5,3) and (5,1).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), (5,6) at (5,6), so same column.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go down to (5,5), then to (5,4), then to (5,3).\n\nBut as before, after eating (5,3), I have issue.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go left to (4,3) or right to (6,3), then down to (4,2) or (6,2), etc.\n\nOr to (5,1), but (5,1) is at y=1, so from (5,3) I can go down to (5,2) invalid, so must go left/right first, then down.\n\nFor example, to (4,3) then down to (4,2), then to (4,1) or (5,1) but (5,1) not adjacent to (4,2), from (4,2) to (5,1) is diagonal, not adjacent, so must go to (4,1) or (4,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,1), I need to be at (4,1) or (6,1) and then move to (5,1).\n\nSimilarly for (1,1).\n\nBut (5,1) has long life, so no rush.\n\nNow, another food: (5,1) at (5,1), value 1, life span 9.\n\nI should plan to eat the food that expires soon.\n\n(5,3), (5,6), (1,1) expire at turn 9, (3,4) at turn 10, (5,1) at turn 13.\n\nSo (5,3) and (5,6) should be eaten soon.\n\n(3,4) can wait a bit.\n\nAt turn 5, I am at (4,5).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is adjacent to (4,6) and (5,5).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), adjacent to (5,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), (5,6) is 2 moves away via (4,6) then (5,6).\n\n(5,3) is 3 moves away via (4,4) then (5,4) then (5,3), or other paths.\n\n(3,4) is 2 moves away.\n\nSo (5,6) and (3,4) are equally close.\n\nBut (5,6) might be better to eat first because after eating, I can go down towards (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,4), I can go right towards (5,3).\n\nBut the path to (5,3) from (3,4) might be longer.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,3): |5-3| + |3-4| =2+1=3 moves.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (5,3): |5-5| + |3-6| =0+3=3 moves down, but each move down, and at (5,5), (5,4), then (5,3).\n\nBut at (5,4), no issue.\n\nHowever, after eating (5,3), as before, I am stuck with no down move.\n\nBut I can go left or right.\n\nNow, let's consider the internal obstacle at (5,2), which blocks the column at x=5, y=2, so moving vertically at x=5 is blocked between y=1 and y=3.\n\ny=1,2,3; (5,2) wall, so from (5,1) to (5,3) is not directly connected; must go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,1) to (5,3): I can go to (4,1) then (4,2) then (4,3) then (5,3), or similarly via (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) and (6,2) may be free.\n\nSo not a big deal, but extra moves.\n\nFor now, I think going for (5,6) first is reasonable.\n\nThen I can eat (5,3) later.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) can be eaten after.\n\nBut (3,4) has longer life, so ok.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6) and eat, now snake [(5,6), (4,6)], direction R\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), move D to (5,5)  (since I cannot go U, and going L to (4,6) is safe but not productive, or R to (6,6), but D to (5,5) is towards (5,3))\n\nSo move D to (5,5), snake now [(5,5), (5,6)] head (5,5), tail (5,6), direction D\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4), snake [(5,4), (5,5)] head (5,4), body (5,5), direction D\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) and eat, snake grows to length 3: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5), direction D\n\nNow, at turn 9, at (5,3), with direction D, I cannot go D to (5,2) wall, cannot go U to (5,4) body, so must go L to (4,3) or R to (6,3)\n\nSay go L to (4,3) for safety.\n\nThen snake [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? Positions: before move, head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (4,3), then new head (4,3), body moves to old head (5,3), tail moves to old body (5,4). So snake [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nI ate two foods: at turn 6 and turn 9.\n\n(3,4) is still available until turn 10, so at turn 10, I can go to (3,4) from (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go left to (3,3) or up to (4,4), etc., then to (3,4).\n\nFor example, turn 10: from (4,3) go U to (4,4), then if (3,4) is still there, but turn 10 is last turn for (3,4)? Life span: at turn 5, life span 6, so available turns 5 to 10, disappears after turn 10, so on turn 10, it is there if not eaten.\n\nAt turn 10, I can move to (3,4) from (4,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9, I am at (4,3) after moving.\n\nLet's list the actions:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R (eat at (5,6))\n\nTurn 7: D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,3) (eat)\n\nThen at turn 9, after eating, I am at (5,3), and I move to (4,3), so action for turn 9 is D to (5,3), which is the move, and after that, the position is (5,3) with body.\n\nThen for turn 10, I need to move from there.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 9 action is D to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,3), I go L to (4,3), as above.\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), from (4,3) I can go up to (4,4), then left to (3,4) to eat at turn 11, but turn 11, (3,4) may be gone. Life span: available until turn 10, so on turn 10 it is there, turn 11 gone.\n\nAt turn 10, I am at (4,3) after turn 10 move.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3) move to (4,3)\n\nThen at turn 10, positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,4)? After move to (4,3), new head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,4)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4) or (3,3), but not directly to (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go up to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (3,4) at turn 11, but turn 11 (3,4) is gone.\n\nAt turn 10, (3,4) is available, but from (4,3), I cannot reach (3,4) in one move; it's diagonal. Must go to (4,4) or (3,3) first.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,4) at turn 10.\n\nIf I had gone to (3,4) earlier, I could have eaten it.\n\nIn this path, I missed (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has life until turn 10, so if I don't eat by turn 10, it's gone.\n\nIn the sequence above, I didn't eat it.\n\nIf I eat (3,4) first, I can eat it at turn 6, then go to (5,3) at turn 9.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4) and eat, snake [(3,4), (3,5)], direction D\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3), snake [(3,3), (3,4)] head (3,3), body (3,4), direction D\n\nTurn 8: move R to (4,3), snake head (4,3), body (3,3), direction R? Moved right, so direction R\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,3) and eat, snake head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (3,3) but when eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (3,3), length 3, direction R\n\nThen same as before, at (5,3), must go left or right.\n\nAte (3,4) at turn 6 and (5,3) at turn 9.\n\n(5,6) is still available until turn 9, so at turn 9, I am at (5,3), which is far from (5,6), so I cannot eat (5,6) by turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,6) is 3 steps up, but at turn 9, after eating, I am at (5,3), and (5,6) is available turn 9, so if I go up to (5,4) at turn 9, but at turn 9, I move to (5,3) and eat, so position at end of turn 9 is (5,3).\n\nThen turn 10: move to (5,4), but (5,4) may be free, then turn 11 to (5,5), turn 12 to (5,6), but turn 12, (5,6) is gone, since disappeared after turn 9.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 5, available turns 5,6,7,8,9, gone turn 10.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,6) after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in this path, I ate (3,4) and (5,3), missed (5,6).\n\nIn the first path, I ate (5,6) and (5,3), missed (3,4).\n\n(1,1) is far, not eaten in either.\n\n(5,1) has long life, can be eaten later.\n\nBut for now, both options give two foods eaten by turn 9.\n\n(3,4) has value 1, same as others.\n\nBut in terms of position, after eating (5,3), I am near the obstacle, which might be less flexible.\n\nAfter eating (3,4) and (5,3), I am at (5,3), which is similar.\n\nBut from (3,4) area, I can go to other parts.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) or (4,3), I can go to (1,1) or (5,1), but (1,1) expires soon.\n\n(1,1) available until turn 9, so by turn 9 I need to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,5), (1,1) is at (1,1), distance |4-1| + |5-1| =3+4=7 moves, so not reachable in 4 moves to turn 9.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 5 actions? Turn 5,6,7,8,9: 5 moves.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,1): min moves 3+4=7, so cannot reach by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) to (1,1) is far.\n\nSo (1,1) cannot be eaten; it will disappear unused.\n\nSimilarly, only (3,4), (5,3), (5,6) can be eaten if I choose.\n\n(5,1) has long life, can be later.\n\nSo for the first 5 turns, I can eat two of the three: (3,4), (5,3), (5,6).\n\n(5,3) is common in both plans.\n\nI can eat (5,6) and (3,4) but they are on opposite sides.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), go to (4,4) at turn 5, then to (3,4) at turn 6 eat.\n\nThen from (3,4), go right to (4,4) at turn 7, but (4,4) may be free, then to (5,4) at turn 8, then to (5,5) at turn 9, but (5,6) is at (5,6), from (5,5) to (5,6) at turn 10, but (5,6) gone.\n\nNot possible.\n\nFrom (3,4) after eating, go up to (3,5) at turn 7, then right to (4,5) at turn 8, then up to (4,6) at turn 9, then to (5,6) at turn 10, too late.\n\nSo I cannot eat both (3,4) and (5,6) because they are too far apart to eat both by turn 9 with only 5 moves from turn 5.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9: 5 moves, I can eat one at turn 6 and another at turn 9, but only if they are close.\n\n(3,4) and (5,3) are 3 moves apart from each other after eating first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) and (5,3) are 3 moves apart.\n\n(3,4) and (5,6) are |5-3| + |6-4| =2+2=4 moves apart, so from after eating one at turn 6, I need 4 moves to reach the other, so at turn 10, but it expires at turn 9, so impossible to eat both.\n\nTherefore, I can only eat one of (3,4) or (5,6), plus (5,3), since (5,3) can be reached from both in 3 moves.\n\nSo both options are valid for two foods.\n\nNow, which one to choose? (5,6) or (3,4) first.\n\nPerhaps (5,6) first is better because after eating (5,3), I can potentially go to (5,1) later, which is below, but with the obstacle, it might be tricky.\n\n(3,4) first, after eating (5,3), I can go to other areas.\n\nBut since (5,1) has long life, I can plan later.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, the area near x=5 might be more constrained due to the obstacle.\n\nFor example, at x=5, with (5,2) wall, the column is split, so moving between y=1 and y=3 requires going around, which might increase risk.\n\nWhereas the left side is open.\n\nSo perhaps eating (3,4) first is better for flexibility.\n\nLet's choose that.\n\nSo turn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4) and eat\n\nThen for turn 7, I need to move.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction D, I can go D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), or U to (3,5) safely.\n\nTo go towards (5,3), I can go R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 8: from (4,4), can go R to (5,4) (assuming direction R)\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), go D to (5,3) and eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, move to (5,3) eat.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 5: L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: D to (3,4) eat  // snake [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 7: R to (4,4)  // move to (4,4), direction R, snake head (4,4), body (3,4), tail (3,5) moved to (3,4)? Before move: head (3,4), tail (3,5)\n\nMove to (4,4), new head (4,4), body moves to old head (3,4), tail moves to old body (3,4), but body was only one, so tail moves to (3,4). Snake [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)  // head (5,4), body (4,4), direction R\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) and eat  // head (5,3), body (5,4), and tail added at (4,4)? When eat, tail doesn't move, so new head (5,3), body (5,4), tail at previous tail position, which was (4,4). So snake [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,3), can go L to (4,3) or R to (6,3), etc.\n\nAte (3,4) at turn 6 and (5,3) at turn 9.\n\n(5,6) not eaten, but it expired.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) not eaten.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions from turn 5 onwards for multiple turns.\n\nSince the state is at turn 5, I need to output actions for turn 5, turn 6, etc.\n\nI should provide at least 5 turns: turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nIn turn 8, I moved to (5,4), then turn 9 to (5,3).\n\n(5,4) is not wall, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem valid.\n\nIf I want to eat (5,6), I can do similar.\n\nBut with (3,4) first, I have a path.\n\nAnother option: at turn 5, go down to (4,4), then turn 6 to (3,4) eat, then same as above.\n\nBut with down first, direction when eating is L.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go D to (3,3) or R to (4,4), etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo avoid the potential issue at (5,3), I could eat (3,4) and then not go to (5,3), but (5,3) expires soon, so I should eat it.\n\n(5,1) has longer life.\n\nSo I think the plan is ok.\n\nFinal decision: go for (3,4) first.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4) and eat\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,4)  // towards (5,3)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) and eat\n\nThen for turn 10, I can go L to (4,3) or something, but I need to specify only for the answer, but the format says to list actions, so I can list up to turn 9 or more.\n\nThe core is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 5.\n\nIn the answer, I should list for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps list turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nSince after turn 9, I ate two foods, and snake length 3, I can continue.\n\nBut for the response, I think turn 5 to turn 9 is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nIn turn 7, I moved R to (4,4), but from (3,4) to (4,4) is right, which is valid.\n\nThen turn 8 R to (5,4), turn 9 D to (5,3).\n\nAll moves are possible, no wall or self-collision.\n\nIf I had gone up to (4,6) first, it would be similar but with (5,6).\n\nBut I think this is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 5 to turn 9). The snake starts at position (4,5) with a length of 1 and is moving left. The goal is to eat high-value food (all food here has value +1) while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's own body. Food with shorter life spans is prioritized to prevent it from expiring, but survival is key.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (5,3) and (5,6) have life spans of 5, expiring after turn 9 (available turns 5-9). (3,4) has a life span of 6, expiring after turn 10 (available turns 5-10). (5,1) has a long life span (9, expiring after turn 13), so it can be deferred. (1,1) is too far to reach before expiration (turn 9) and is ignored.\n  - (3,4) is eaten first at turn 6 as it is reachable in 2 moves and has moderate urgency. (5,3) is eaten at turn 9 as it expires soon and is reachable from (3,4) in 3 moves. (5,6) is skipped because it cannot be eaten alongside (3,4) by turn 9 due to distance constraints.\n- **Risks and Survival**:\n  - The snake starts with length 1, so no body collision risk initially. After eating, length increases, requiring careful movement to avoid self-collision.\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,2) makes the bottom-right area (e.g., near (5,1) and (5,3)) riskier due to limited mobility. Moving left first avoids this area early on.\n  - Paths are chosen to keep the snake in open areas for flexibility, reducing dead-end risks.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turns 5-6**: Eat (3,4) quickly to grow to length 2.\n  - **Turns 7-9**: Navigate toward (5,3) to eat it before expiration, ending at (5,3) with length 3.\n  - **Beyond Turn 9**: After eating (5,3), the snake can move left to (4,3) for safety (away from walls/obstacles) and consider eating (5,1) later due to its long life span.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 5-9):\n- **Turn 5**: Move left (L) to (3,5). This moves toward (3,4) for eating next turn. Direction becomes L (implicitly, but direction only matters for reverse constraints).\n- **Turn 6**: Move down (D) to (3,4) and eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,4), (3,5)]. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (4,4). This heads toward (5,3) and avoids the riskier bottom area. Snake positions: head (4,4), body (3,4). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 8**: Move right (R) to (5,4). Continues path to (5,3). Snake positions: head (5,4), body (4,4). Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (5,3) and eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 3: positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]. Direction becomes D.\n\n### Explanation of Safety and Efficiency:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - No walls or obstacles are hit (e.g., (5,4) and (5,3) are valid cells; (5,2) is avoided).\n  - No self-collision: At turn 6, moving to (3,4) is safe as no body exists initially. At turn 9, moving to (5,3) is safe as the body at (5,4) moves away.\n- **Food Utilization**: \n  - Eats two high-value foods ((3,4) and (5,3)) by turn 9, maximizing score with minimal risk. \n  - (5,6) is not eaten but is less critical due to similar value and expiration; it would require a detour that risks missing (5,3).\n- **Long-Term Focus**: \n  - After turn 9, the snake is at (5,3) with options: move left to (4,3) (safe) or right to (6,3) to access open areas. (5,1) can be targeted later (e.g., via (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (5,1)) after turn 10, leveraging its long life span.\n  - The plan avoids the constrained area near (5,2) until necessary, ensuring survival.\n\nThis sequence scores +2 by turn 9 and sets up for further food collection with the snake in a controllable position.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: L \\\\\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: R \\\\\nTurn 9: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nThe border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are walls, so yes, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: only one position, [(3,5)]. That means the snake is just the head, no body segments. Length 1. Head direction is L (left).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) value 1, life span 4\n\n- (5,3) value 1, life span 4\n\n- (5,6) value 1, life span 4\n\n- (3,4) value 1, life span 5\n\n- (5,1) value 1, life span 8\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nLife span means how many turns left before it disappears, including the current turn. So for (1,1), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after turn 6+3=9? Let's see: life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 6, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left including turn 6. So it will be there for turns 6,7,8,9, and disappear after turn 9 or before turn 10? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. But the problem says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1. When L=0 after a turn, it disappears. So for food at (1,1) with life span 4 at turn 6:\n\n- Turn 6: life span 4\n\n- Turn 7: life span 3\n\n- Turn 8: life span 2\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1\n\n- After turn 9, it disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,5), direction left. Since no body, it can move freely without self-collision, except for walls and obstacles.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But head direction is L, so I cannot move right on the next turn because of no instant reverse. Since direction is L, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right immediately.\n\nAvailable moves from (3,5):\n\n- U: to (3,6) - but y=6, is that within bounds? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is wall, but y=6 should be playable? Grid from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nBorder walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\nSo (3,5): possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) - y=6, which is within 1 to 6, so ok.\n\n- D: (3,4) - y=4, ok.\n\n- L: (2,5) - x=2, ok.\n\n- R: (4,5) - but cannot because opposite direction? No, direction is L, so R is opposite, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, walls: no walls at (3,6), (3,4), (2,5) except borders which are fine. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,1) - at turn 6, life span 4\n\n- (5,3) - life span 4\n\n- (5,6) - life span 4\n\n- (3,4) - life span 5, so longer life\n\n- (5,1) - life span 8, even longer\n\n(3,4) is directly below the head at (3,5). If I move D to (3,4), I can eat the food there.\n\nSince snake length is 1, eating food will make it grow to length 2.\n\nBut there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, no tail, so no issue. After eating, tail will be where head was, but since I'm moving to the food, it should be fine.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent turn t=6, snake at (3,5), head dir L.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), which has food. Since length=1, eating it: head moves to (3,4), and since it grows, the tail is added at previous position (3,5). So new positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5). Direction: I moved down, so new head direction D.\n\nNow, at (3,4), I ate food, so score +1, length 2.\n\nFood at (3,4) is consumed, so removed.\n\nOther food still there.\n\nNow, life spans decrease after each turn? The life span is given at turn t, and after each turn, it decreases.\n\nBut when I eat, it's removed.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, options at turn 6.\n\nAvailable moves: U, D, L. (R not allowed)\n\n- U: to (3,6)\n\n- D: to (3,4) with food\n\n- L: to (2,5)\n\nIf I go to (3,4), I eat immediately, get +1, and now have a body.\n\nBut I should consider long-term survival and maximizing score.\n\nThere are other food: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,1). (5,6) is at y=6, which is top row, playable.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is within bounds.\n\n(5,3) at (5,3), etc.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat as much as possible without dying.\n\nBut since I'm alone now, no immediate danger.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid: 6x6 from (1,1) to (6,6). Walls outside.\n\nObstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake head: (3,5)\n\nFood:\n\n(1,1) - bottom-left\n\n(5,3) - right, above obstacle\n\n(5,6) - top-right\n\n(3,4) - directly below head\n\n(5,1) - bottom-right, near obstacle\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is bottom row, x=5, y=1.\n\nNow, distances:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,4): distance 1, down.\n\nTo (1,1): need to go left and down, Manhattan distance |3-1| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps.\n\nTo (5,3): |3-5| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps\n\nTo (5,6): |3-5| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps? |5-6|=1, yes.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), head at (3,5), so Δx=2, Δy=1, distance 3.\n\nTo (5,1): |3-5| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps.\n\nAlso, (3,4) is 1 step down.\n\nLife spans:\n\n- (1,1): life 4 at t=6, so disappears after t=9 (turns 6,7,8,9)\n\n- (5,3): life 4, same, after t=9\n\n- (5,6): life 4, after t=9\n\n- (3,4): life 5 at t=6, so t=6,7,8,9,10, disappears after t=10\n\n- (5,1): life 8, longer, t=6 to t=13\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to eat multiple foods.\n\nBut with the snake growing, it might block paths.\n\nCurrently length 1, so I can go anywhere.\n\nIf I eat (3,4) now, I grow to length 2, head at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n\nThen from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nAvailable moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), but that's the tail, but since tail will move when I move, it might be ok, but let's see collision rules.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it is safe because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to other body segments, collision.\n\nBut here, after eating at (3,4), positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5).\n\nIf I move up to (3,5), which is current tail, since tail will move, it should be ok. When I move, head goes to (3,5), and since I ate last turn, the tail doesn't move? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays where it was, or adds a segment?\n\nThe rule: when eating positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so it grows by one.\n\nMovement: head moves to new cell, if no food, tail end is removed; if food, tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nIn this case, at turn 6, I move to (3,4) and eat, so head to (3,4), and since I ate, the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the previous position, so snake becomes [(3,4), (3,5)] with head at (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 7, if I move, say, up to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied by the tail. But since I move there, and the tail will move: head moves to (3,5), which was tail, and then the tail should move to... but the tail was at (3,5), but when head moves to a new cell, the tail segment is removed if no growth, but since no growth this turn (unless I eat), the tail should move forward.\n\nLet's clarify the movement and growth.\n\nTypically: at each turn, head moves to an adjacent cell. If that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the new head position is added, with the tail staying, so length increases by one. If no food, head moves, tail is removed from the end.\n\nBut in this case, when moving to a cell with food, you grow, so tail remains.\n\nNow, for collision: when you move head to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment (except the tail, which will move), it collides.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the current tail position, it is safe because the tail will move away, so no issue.\n\nIf head moves to any other body segment, collision.\n\nAlso, if head moves to wall or obstacle, collision.\n\nBack to turn 6.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), I eat the food, grow to length 2, positions: head (3,4), tail (3,5). Head direction now D.\n\nThen at turn 7, from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) - current tail, so ok, since tail will move. D to (3,3) - empty, L to (2,4), R to (4,4). All within bounds.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), which was tail, head moves to (3,5), and since no food there (food was eaten), tail moves to... previous tail was at (3,5), but when head moves to (3,5), and since no growth, the tail should be removed, but it's the same cell? Confusion.\n\nStandard: positions list: after growth at turn 6: segments [ (3,4), (3,5) ] with head at (3,4).\n\nAt turn 7, if I move U to (3,5): head moves to (3,5), which is currently occupied by the tail segment. Since it's the tail, and no growth, the tail is removed from (3,5), so the new positions should be head at (3,5), and no tail? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have it wrong.\n\nTypically in snake, the body segments move: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head, and the last segment (tail) is removed if no growth.\n\nSo with segments [A, B] where A is head, B is tail.\n\nMove head to new cell C.\n\nIf C has food, then new segments [C, A, B], length increases.\n\nIf no food, new segments [C, A], and B is removed.\n\nIn this case, at turn 6: after move to (3,4) with food, segments: head (3,4), tail (3,5) — so [ (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5).\n\nCell (3,5) is currently occupied by tail. But when we move, head goes to (3,5), and since (3,5) is the tail position, and no food there, the tail should be removed, but now head is at (3,5), and the previous head (3,4) becomes the new tail? Let's see.\n\nPositions: before move, segments S0 = (3,4), S1 = (3,5) with S0 head.\n\nMove head to (3,5).\n\nNew head position: (3,5)\n\nNow, since we moved to (3,5), which is not food (assuming no food there now), so no growth, so the tail is removed. Tail was S1 at (3,5), but we're moving to that cell, so after move, the new segments should be [ (3,5) ] only, because head moved to where tail was, and tail is removed, so snake is back to length 1 at (3,5).\n\nThat can't be right for collision.\n\nPerhaps the movement is: the head moves to the new cell, and if no growth, the tail end is removed, meaning the last segment is deleted.\n\nSo from [A, B], move head to C, no food: new segments [C, A], B is removed.\n\nIf C has food, new segments [C, A, B], B stays.\n\nIn this case, turn 6: after eating, [ (3,4), (3,5) ]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5). But (3,5) is currently occupied by B, the tail.\n\nWhen we move head to (3,5), we are moving to a cell that is occupied, but by the tail.\n\nAccording to collision rule, it is allowed because the tail will move away.\n\nBut in terms of position: new head position is (3,5). Since no food at (3,5), no growth, so the tail B at (3,5) is removed, and the new tail is A, which was (3,4).\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4) — so [ (3,5), (3,4) ], head at (3,5).\n\nBut the cell (3,5) was occupied, but we moved there, and since it was the tail, it's ok.\n\nThe body is now from (3,5) to (3,4), so if I'm at (3,5), I can move to other places.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to a different cell.\n\nBut in this case, moving to the former tail position is safe.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nAt turn 6, from (3,5), I can:\n\n- Move U to (3,6): no food there, so snake stays length 1, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\n- Move D to (3,4): with food, eat, grow to length 2, head at (3,4), direction D.\n\n- Move L to (2,5): no food, length 1, head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nNow, to think ahead 5 turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (1,1) life 4, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) and (5,6) life 4, by turn 9.\n\n(3,4) life 5, by turn 10.\n\n(5,1) life 8, by turn 13.\n\nSince I need to survive, and eat as much as possible.\n\nIf I eat (3,4) now, I get +1 immediately, but then I have a body, which might block paths later.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I can go for other food, but (3,4) is close, and life span 5, so I have time.\n\nBut it might be eaten later or something, but no other snake, so only I can eat it.\n\nFood doesn't move, only I move.\n\nSo I can leave it for later.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach other food first.\n\nFor example, (5,6) is at (5,6), distance 3 from (3,5): e.g., right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then up to (5,6). But direction is L, so I cannot move right immediately.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction L, so I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nSo to go to (5,6), I need to go right eventually, but not now.\n\nFirst move: if I move U to (3,6), then from there, I can move R to (4,6), then R to (5,6), but at (5,6) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,6) at turn 6.\n\nThen at turn 7, from (3,6), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n\nBut U to (3,7) is y=7 wall, invalid. So can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay move R to (4,6).\n\nThen at turn 8, from (4,6), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (4,7) wall, invalid. D to (4,5), or R to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is food, so move R to (5,6), eat, grow.\n\nSo in 3 turns, I eat (5,6) at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 7 from (3,6) I move L to (2,6), then to (1,6), but no food there, and (1,1) is far.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5) at turn 6.\n\nThen from (2,5), direction L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nL to (1,5), or U to (2,6), D to (2,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,6), it would take more moves.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is below, if I move D, I eat it now.\n\nBut let's consider the life spans.\n\n(5,6) life span 4 at t=6, so must be eaten by t=9. I can reach it by t=8 as above.\n\n(5,3) at (5,3), life 4.\n\nFrom (3,5), to (5,3): need to go right and down.\n\nBut cannot move right now.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), I eat that, then from there I can go to (5,3).\n\nBut after eating (3,4), I'm at (3,4) with tail (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4), then to (5,4), then down to (5,3)? (5,3) is food.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (5,2), so (5,3) is above it, ok.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,3): I can go right to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then down to (5,3).\n\nOr directly down to (3,3), but (3,3) no food, then to (4,3), etc, but longer.\n\nShortest: (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,3), but (5,4) to (5,3) is down, distance 3 steps.\n\nBut at (5,4), no food, so only when I move to (5,3) I eat.\n\nNow, if I eat at turn 6, then at turn 7 I can move R to (4,4), turn 8 to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,3) and eat.\n\nBut (5,3) life span 4 at t=6, so at turn 9, if I eat on turn 9, life span: at turn 6, life 4, turn 7 life 3, turn 8 life 2, turn 9 life 1, so on turn 9, I can still eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\n(1,1) is far, life 4, so I need to reach it soon.\n\nFrom current position (3,5), to (1,1): need to go left and down.\n\nIf I move L to (2,5) at turn 6.\n\nThen to (1,5) at turn 7 (move L).\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4), D to (1,3), D to (1,2), D to (1,1) at turn 11, but life span only to turn 9, so too late. Turn 6 to turn 11 is 5 moves, but from (1,5) to (1,1) is 4 steps down, so from turn 7 at (1,5), move D turn 8 to (1,4), turn 9 to (1,3), turn 10 to (1,2), turn 11 to (1,1). But at turn 10, life span: started t=6 life 4, t=7 life 3, t=8 life 2, t=9 life 1, t=10 life 0, so after turn 9 it disappears, not available on turn 10. So I cannot reach (1,1) by turn 9 from here.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I move directly down to (3,4) at turn 6, then I'm at (3,4), but that's not closer to (1,1).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (1,1): need left and down, e.g., L to (2,4), L to (1,4), then D to (1,3), etc, still 4 or 5 steps to (1,1), which would be after turn 10, too late.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6) or other positions.\n\nSo (1,1) is too far to reach before it disappears, since min Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |5-1| = 2+4=6, so at least 6 moves, but from turn 6, in 3 moves I can be at turn 9, which is the last chance, but in 3 moves I can only go 3 steps, not 6, so impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 9. Turn 6,7,8,9: 4 moves, but I start moving on turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, I move, so after move, position at end of turn 6.\n\nThen turn 7 move, position end turn 7, etc.\n\nTo eat on turn t, I move to the cell on turn t.\n\nFor (1,1), life span at t=6 is 4, so can be eaten on turns 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from (3,5), min steps to (1,1) is 6, so I need 6 moves to reach it.\n\nTurn 6: move 1\n\nTurn 7: move 2\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: move 6, position (1,1)\n\nBut on turn 11, food is gone, since disappeared after turn 9.\n\nSo earliest I can be at (1,1) is turn 11, but food only until turn 9, so impossible to eat (1,1). Similarly for other short-life food that are far.\n\n(1,1) cannot be eaten, because it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) and (5,6) are closer.\n\n(5,6): from (3,5), min steps 3, as I said: e.g., U to (3,6), R to (4,6), R to (5,6) — but first move U, then R, then R.\n\nAt turn 6 move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 7 move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 8 move R to (5,6) and eat.\n\nOn turn 8, life span: t=6 life 4, t=7 life 3, t=8 life 2, so available, eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): from (3,5), min steps 4: e.g., D to (3,4), R to (4,4), R to (5,4), D to (5,3) — but (3,4) has food, if I move there, I eat and grow.\n\nWithout eating, from (3,5) to (5,3): I need to go right, but cannot immediately, so must change direction.\n\nE.g., move L to (2,5) turn 6, then D to (2,4) turn 7, then R to (3,4) but (3,4) has food, or skip, say R to (3,4) but if I move to it, I eat, or go around.\n\nFrom (2,4), to (3,4), then to (4,4), then to (5,4), then to (5,3).\n\nBut (3,4) has food, so if I move to it, I eat.\n\nTo avoid eating (3,4), I could go directly, but (3,4) is on the way.\n\nSince (3,4) has longer life, I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's list all reachable food with their time.\n\nFirst, (5,6) can be eaten by turn 8 as above.\n\n(5,3) can be eaten, e.g., from (3,5) move D to (3,4) turn 6 (eat or not), but if I eat, I grow, then from (3,4) move R to (4,4) turn 7, then to (5,4) turn 8, then to (5,3) turn 9 eat.\n\nOn turn 9, (5,3) life: t=6 life 4, t=7 life 3, t=8 life 2, t=9 life 1, available.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,4) at turn 6, I could go directly to (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5) turn 6, then D to (2,4) turn 7, then R to (3,4) turn 8? But (3,4) has food, if I move to it I eat, or if I avoid, but (3,4) is at (3,4), to go to (5,3) I need to go to (4,4) or something.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move R to (3,4) and eat, or move D to (2,3), then R to (3,3), etc, longer to (5,3).\n\nSo not efficient, better to go through (3,4) or directly.\n\n(3,4) is on the way to many places.\n\n(5,1) has long life, life 8, so I have until turn 13 to eat it.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6) at turn 6, then I can reach (5,6) by turn 8.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), I eat it now, grow, then I can go to other food.\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), I go left, but (1,1) unreachable, and no food there, so not good.\n\nSo best to either go U for (5,6) or D for (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has life 5, so I can eat it later, but it's very close.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has only life 4, so I should prioritize eating it before it disappears.\n\n(5,6) life 4, must eat by turn 9, but I can eat by turn 8.\n\n(3,4) life 5, can eat by turn 10.\n\nSo eating (5,6) first might be better to not miss it.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,6), I can go for other food.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger later, but now no issue.\n\nAnother thing: if I eat (3,4) now, I grow, and then I have a body, which might cause issues if I go back.\n\nBut for now, let's plan a sequence.\n\nOption A: Go for (5,6) first.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,6)  // head now at (3,6), direction U, length 1\n\nTurn 7: from (3,6), can move L, R (U not, wall, D opposite but not available? Direction U, so can move U, L, R, but U to (3,7) wall, invalid. So only L or R.\n\nSay move R to (4,6)  // head at (4,6), direction R\n\nTurn 8: from (4,6), direction R, can move U, D, R. U to (4,7) wall, invalid. D to (4,5), or R to (5,6).\n\nMove R to (5,6), eat, grow to length 2. Positions: head (5,6), tail (4,6)? After move to (5,6) with food, so new head (5,6), previous head was (4,6), so segments [ (5,6), (4,6) ], tail at (4,6).\n\nHead direction R.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food, e.g. (5,3) or (3,4) or (5,1).\n\n(5,3) is below, but there's obstacle at (5,2), so from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then D to (5,3), but (5,4) to (5,3) is down, and (5,3) has food.\n\nBut at turn 8 I ate, so turn 9: from (5,6), move D to (5,5)  // no food, so head to (5,5), tail moves from (4,6) to? Previous segments [ (5,6), (4,6) ], move head to (5,5), no food (assume), so new segments [ (5,5), (5,6) ], tail at (5,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (5,4)  // no food, head to (5,4), tail to (5,5)? New segments [ (5,4), (5,5) ]\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (5,3)  // eat, grow. Head to (5,3), new segments [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) ], tail at (5,5).\n\nBut (5,3) life span: at turn 11, but originally life 4 at t=6, so at turn 11, it would be gone? Turn 6: life 4, t=7:3, t=8:2, t=9:1, t=10:0 disappear, so not available on turn 11. Turn 9 is last chance.\n\nIn this plan, I eat (5,3) on turn 11, too late.\n\nFrom after eating (5,6) at turn 8, position (5,6) with tail (4,6).\n\nInstead of going down, I could go left to (4,6) but that's tail, can move there? From (5,6), move L to (4,6), which is current tail position.\n\nMove to (4,6), which is tail, so safe. Since no food there, head to (4,6), tail was (4,6), but removed, new segments [ (4,6) ] only? Let's see.\n\nPositions: before move, [ (5,6), (4,6) ] head (5,6)\n\nMove head to (4,6), which is current tail.\n\nNew head position (4,6). Since no food, no growth, tail is removed. Tail was at (4,6), so after move, only head at (4,6), length 1.\n\nNot useful.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) as before, but to reach (5,3) faster.\n\nFrom (5,6), move D to (5,5) turn 9.\n\nThen turn 10 move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11 move D to (5,3) but too late.\n\nSince (5,3) must be eaten by turn 9, and at turn 8 I'm at (5,6), I can only be at (5,5) or (4,6) or (5,7 invalid) on turn 9, not (5,3). (5,3) is two steps down, from (5,6) to (5,5) turn 9, then to (5,4) turn 10, to (5,3) turn 11, but turn 9 I can be at (5,5) or (4,6), not (5,3).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,3) from (5,6) by turn 9. Impossible.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (5,6) first, I miss (5,3).\n\n(5,3) can only be eaten if I go directly from near.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I move towards it.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, move D to (3,4) and eat (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 7, from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8, move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9, move D to (5,3) and eat.\n\nOn turn 9, (5,3) life 1, available.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (5,3) by turn 9.\n\nAnd (3,4) eaten at turn 6.\n\n(5,6) I can still reach, but from after turn 9.\n\nAfter eating (5,3) at turn 9, I'm at (5,3) with body.\n\nPositions: let's track.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4) eat, grow to length 2: positions [(3,4), (3,5)] head (3,4) dir D\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,4) no food? (4,4) no food, so head to (4,4), tail to (3,4)? Previous: head (3,4), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (4,4), no food, so new head (4,4), and tail removed, so only [ (4,4) ]? No.\n\nSegments: before move, [ (3,4), (3,5) ] head (3,4)\n\nMove head to (4,4), no food, so new segments [ (4,4), (3,4) ], tail at (3,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4) no food, head to (5,4), new segments [ (5,4), (4,4) ], tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) eat, grow. Head to (5,3), new segments [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ], tail (4,4)\n\nNow, (5,6) is still there, life span 4 at t=6, so at turn 9, life span: t=9, original t=6 life 4, t=7 life 3, t=8 life 2, t=9 life 1, so available on turn 9, but I'm at (5,3), not at (5,6).\n\nAfter turn 9, I can go to (5,6).\n\nFrom (5,3), to (5,6): up, but obstacle at (5,2)? (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6), all clear except (5,2) is below, not issue.\n\nSo move U to (5,4) turn 10, but (5,4) is currently occupied by body? Positions: after turn 9, segments [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ], so (5,4) is body.\n\nFrom (5,3), head, can move U to (5,4), but (5,4) is body segment, not tail, so if I move there, collision.\n\nCannot move up to (5,4).\n\nCan move L to (4,3), or R to (6,3) but x=6? x=6 is within 1-6? x=1 to 6, x=6 is playable, but walls at x=7, so x=6 ok.\n\nMove R to (6,3), or D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,4) but body, collision; D to (5,2) wall; L to (4,3); R to (6,3).\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay move L to (4,3) turn 10.\n\nThen from (4,3), can move to (4,4) but (4,4) is tail? Positions: after move to (4,3), head to (4,3), no food, so new segments: from [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ] move head to (4,3), no food, so new head (4,3), and tail removed: last segment (4,4) removed? Segments before move: [head (5,3), then (5,4), then tail (4,4)]\n\nMove head to (4,3), new segments [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]? No: the segments are in order, head to new position, then the previous head becomes next, etc.\n\nStandard: positions list, head first. So [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to new cell C:\n\n- If no food, new list [C, H, B1, B2, ...] without the last element (tail removed)\n\n- If food, new list [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with tail kept.\n\nIn this case, turn 9: positions [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ] head (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: move to (4,3), no food, so new positions [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]? Move head to (4,3), so new head (4,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, and (5,4) becomes body, and tail (4,4) is removed.\n\nSo new segments: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] with head (4,3), tail (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,4) is free.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to (4,4), which is free, or other.\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), and it has life span, but at turn 10, life: t=6 life 4, t=7:3, t=8:2, t=9:1, t=10:0, so after turn 9 it disappears, not available on turn 10. So I missed (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, in this sequence, I ate (3,4) and (5,3), but missed (5,6).\n\n(5,6) could have been eaten if I went directly.\n\nBack to turn 6.\n\nIf I want to eat both (5,6) and (5,3), I need to eat (5,6) first since it's closer and same life.\n\nBut from (3,5), to (5,6) in 3 moves, eat at turn 8.\n\nThen from there, (5,3) is 3 steps away, but I can only reach by turn 11, too late.\n\nUnless I eat (5,3) before (5,6), but (5,6) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (5,3) min 4 moves, to (5,6) min 3 moves.\n\nBut to eat (5,3) by turn 9, I need to start moving early.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, move towards (5,3).\n\nBut I have to avoid instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction L.\n\nMove D to (3,4) turn 6, eat or not.\n\nIf I eat, as before, I can reach (5,3) by turn 9.\n\nIf I don't eat, from (3,5) move D to (3,4) but if I move to (3,4), I eat it since food there.\n\nI cannot not eat it if I move there.\n\nUnless I don't move to it.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), move L to (2,5) turn 6.\n\nThen turn 7 move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 8 move R to (3,4) but (3,4) has food, so if I move to it, I eat.\n\nTurn 9 move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10 move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11 move D to (5,3) too late.\n\nFrom (2,4), turn 8 move R to (3,4) and eat, then turn 9 from (3,4) move R to (4,4), etc, but to (5,3) on turn 11 late.\n\nSo only by eating (3,4) early can I reach (5,3) by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6), only by going directly.\n\nBut I can't eat both (5,6) and (5,3) because they are in different directions and short life.\n\n(5,6) is north-east, (5,3) is south-east.\n\nWith the body, it might be harder to move around.\n\nNow, there is also (5,1) with long life, and (3,4) with longer life.\n\nAnd (1,1) unreachable.\n\nSo perhaps I should eat (5,6) first to not miss it, then eat (3,4) later, and (5,1).\n\n(3,4) life 5, so can be eaten by turn 10.\n\nAfter eating (5,6) at turn 8, I'm at (5,6) with tail (4,6), length 2.\n\nThen I can go down to (5,5) turn 9, then to (5,4) turn 10, then to (5,3) but (5,3) gone, or to (3,4).\n\nFrom (5,6) to (3,4): e.g., move L to (4,6) turn 9, but (4,6) is tail, so if move to it, as before, might shrink or something.\n\nTurn 8: after eating (5,6), positions [ (5,6), (4,6) ] head (5,6) dir R\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,6), which is current tail. Move to (4,6), no food, so new head (4,6), and tail removed, so only [ (4,6) ], length 1.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move to (3,6), or (4,5), etc.\n\nThen to (3,4): from (4,6) move L to (3,6) turn 10, then D to (3,5) turn 11, D to (3,4) turn 12, but (3,4) life span 5 at t=6, t=7:4, t=8:3, t=9:2, t=10:1, t=11:0, so available until turn 10, on turn 11 gone. So turn 10 I can eat if I'm there.\n\nBut at turn 10, if I'm at (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or to (3,4), but to (3,4) directly.\n\nFrom (4,6) at turn 9 (after moving L), position (4,6) length 1.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (3,6) or D to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,4) by turn 10.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (3,4): min steps |4-3| + |6-4| =1+2=3, so need 3 moves: e.g., L to (3,6), then D to (3,5), then D to (3,4) turn 12, too late.\n\nTurn 10 move from (4,6) to (3,6), turn 11 to (3,5), turn 12 to (3,4), but on turn 10, (3,4) life 1, turn 11 life 0, gone, so not available turn 12.\n\nCannot eat (3,4) if I go for (5,6) first.\n\nIf I go for (3,4) first, I can eat it and (5,3), but miss (5,6).\n\nSo I have to choose which one to eat.\n\n(5,6) and (5,3) both have value 1, same as (3,4), so no difference in value.\n\nBut (5,1) has value 1, long life.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but with length 2 or 3, it should be ok.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 6, move U to (3,6), then turn 7 move R to (4,6), turn 8 move R to (5,6) eat, as before.\n\nThen from (5,6), instead of moving down, I can move L to (4,6), which as before, since it's tail, I move to it and snake shrinks to length 1 at (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6) at turn 9, I can move to (3,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), and I need to be there by turn 10 to eat.\n\nFrom (4,6) at turn 9, to (3,4): as above, min 3 steps, not possible by turn 10.\n\nMove directly from (5,6) to other direction.\n\nBut (5,6) has only three directions: L, D, R but R to (6,6) wall? x=6 is playable, x=7 wall, so (6,6) is ok.\n\nFrom (5,6), move R to (6,6) turn 9, then from there, not closer to (3,4).\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat both (5,6) and (3,4) because of the distances and life spans.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) can be eaten with (3,4).\n\nSo perhaps the best is to eat (3,4) and (5,3), and forget about (5,6).\n\nThen I can also eat (5,1) later.\n\n(5,1) life 8, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,3), I'm at (5,3), can go to (5,1).\n\nBut there's obstacle at (5,2), so from (5,3) I can move D to (5,4)? No, (5,3) to (5,4) up, but (5,1) down.\n\n(5,3) to (5,2) obstacle, so I cannot go directly down.\n\nFrom (5,3), to reach (5,1), I need to go around the obstacle.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\n(4,2) to (5,2) not possible.\n\nSo from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1), then R to (5,1).\n\nOr from (5,3) move R to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then L to (5,2) invalid, or to (6,1), then L to (5,1).\n\nLet's not worry about that now.\n\nFirst, for turn 6, I think I should move D to (3,4) to eat the food there immediately, then proceed to (5,3).\n\nThen I can eat two foods.\n\nIf I move U, I eat (5,6) but only one, and miss others.\n\n(5,6) is one food, (3,4) and (5,3) are two.\n\nSo better to eat (3,4) and (5,3).\n\nAlso, (5,1) can be eaten later.\n\nSo at turn 6, move D to (3,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) eat.\n\nNow, after turn 9, positions: as before, [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ] head (5,3)\n\nNow, from here, I can go for (5,1) or other.\n\nBut (5,6) is gone.\n\nNow, (5,1) at (5,1), life 8, so I have time.\n\nFrom (5,3), I need to go down to (5,1), but blocked by obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo must go around.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,3) turn 10.\n\nThen from (4,3), move D to (4,2) turn 11.\n\nThen from (4,2), can move D to (4,1) turn 12, or L to (3,2), etc.\n\nThen to (5,1): from (4,1) move R to (5,1) turn 13, eat.\n\nLife of (5,1): at turn 13, t=6 life 8, t=7:7, ..., t=13:1, so available, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat it.\n\nBut for the answer, I only need to provide actions for 5+ turns ahead, starting from turn 6.\n\nThe current turn is 6, so I need to output actions for turn 6,7,8,9,10,... at least 5 turns.\n\nSince turn 6 is current, I need to decide for turn 6 and then future turns.\n\nBut the future turns depend on what happens, but I need to plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output a fixed sequence based on the state.\n\nSince no other agents, I can plan.\n\nAlso, for the tail danger, but with short snake, low risk.\n\nAnother food: (5,1) is there, but far.\n\nIn the sequence above, after turn 9, I can go to (5,1) as planned.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4) eat.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)  // direction from D to R, but no reverse issue, since not opposite; D down, R right, not opposite.\n\nOpposite of D is U, R is not opposite.\n\nSo ok.\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), move R to (5,4)  // direction R\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move D to (5,3) eat  // direction D\n\nNow, for turn 10, from (5,3), head, positions [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4) but body, collision; D to (5,2) wall; L to (4,3); R to (6,3)\n\nSo move L to (4,3) for example.\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,3), can move to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but in this case, with the plan, I can survive and eat.\n\nTo be precise, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nStart from turn 6.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,1), but I can go there later.\n\nFor the sequence, I can plan to go to (5,1) after.\n\nBut for now, let's output turns 6 to 10 or so.\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3), move L to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,2), move D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 13: from (4,1), move R to (5,1) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I may not need all, but at least 5 turns.\n\nSince turn 6 is included, turns 6,7,8,9,10 are 5 turns.\n\nNow, in this, at turn 10, I move L to (4,3), which is safe.\n\nBut is there a better move?\n\nI could go for other areas, but no other food mentioned.\n\n(3,4) is eaten, (5,3) eaten, (5,6) gone, (1,1) gone, only (5,1) left.\n\nBut (5,1) has long life, so I can explore or something, but for survival, I need to avoid starvation, but with no food, I can move around, but here there is food.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 6, move L to (2,5), but then I may not reach food in time.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), move D to (2,4) turn 7, then to (3,4) turn 8 eat, then to (4,4) turn 9, then to (5,4) turn 10, then to (5,3) but (5,3) gone, or to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I eat only (3,4), miss (5,3) and (5,6).\n\nWorse.\n\nMove U to (3,6) turn 6, then to (4,6) turn 7, to (5,6) turn 8 eat, then I have length 2 at (5,6) and (4,6), then I can move, say, D to (5,5) turn 9, then to (5,4) turn 10, then to (5,3) but gone, or to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut only one food eaten.\n\nSo the first plan is better: eat (3,4) and (5,3).\n\nMoreover, in that plan, at turn 9, I have length 3.\n\nThen I can go for (5,1).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this case, when I eat at (5,3), the head is at (5,3), and the tail is at (4,4), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, no other risks.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for turn 6: move D\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes, but I need to ensure no instant reverse.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: move D, from dir L to D, not opposite, ok.\n\nTurn 7: move R, from dir D to R, not opposite, ok.\n\nTurn 8: move R, same dir or not, from R to R, same direction, ok.\n\nTurn 9: move D, from dir R to D, not opposite, ok.\n\nThen turn 10: move L, from dir D to L, not opposite.\n\nAll good.\n\nFor the boxed answer, I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nTurns 6 to 10.\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: L (to (4,3))\n\nTo be complete, but I think this is sufficient.\n\nPerhaps I can include more, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 10, moving to (4,3) is to start going to (5,1), but I can specify.\n\nBut for the answer, just the actions.\n\nAlso, in the state, snake positions only have head, so after moves, it will grow.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the output:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 6: D, Turn 7: R, Turn 8: R, Turn 9: D, Turn 10: L }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"action on turn\", and \"U (up), D (down), etc.\"\n\nAlso, need to write the turn numbers.\n\nIn the box.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nBut in the box.\n\nSince it says \"Turn \\(t_1\\): action\", etc.\n\nt1=6.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating the accessible high-value food within their life spans, avoiding collisions, and planning at least 5 turns ahead. The snake starts at position (3,5) with length 1 and direction left (L). The food at (3,4) is immediately accessible and has a longer life span (5 turns), allowing it to be eaten now while leaving time to reach other food. The food at (5,3) has a shorter life span (4 turns) and must be eaten by turn 9; it is reachable by turn 9 via a path that avoids the obstacle at (5,2). The food at (5,6) is also short-lived but conflicts with reaching (5,3) in time; sacrificing (5,6) allows eating both (3,4) and (5,3). The food at (1,1) is unreachable before it disappears (by turn 9), and (5,1) has a long life span (8 turns), so it can be targeted later.\n\n### Plan for Turns 6-10:\n- **Turn 6 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to (3,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 2). This is safe as the snake has no tail yet. New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (4,4). No food here, so length remains 2. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 8**: Move right (R) to (5,4). No food here, so length remains 2. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (5,3) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 3). This is safe as the tail is not adjacent. New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 10**: Move left (L) to (4,3) to begin navigating toward (5,1). No food here, so length remains 3. New head direction: L.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Turn 6**: Moving down eats (3,4) immediately, utilizing its proximity and longer life span. Moving up (U) would target (5,6) but miss (3,4) and (5,3); moving left (L) wastes time with no immediate gain.\n- **Turns 7-8**: Moving right twice positions the snake to reach (5,3) by turn 9, just before it disappears. No instant reverse issues (D to R and R to R are valid).\n- **Turn 9**: Eating (5,3) on the last possible turn (life span 1) maximizes score. The path avoids the obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Turn 10**: Moving left to (4,3) starts a safe path toward (5,1) for future turns, avoiding body collisions (positions after turn 9: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (4,4); moving left to (4,3) is clear).\n- **Long-term**: After turn 10, the snake can proceed to (5,1) via (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (5,1) by turn 13, within its life span (8 turns). Survival is prioritized—no risks of collision or starvation with this path.\n\nThis sequence eats two foods by turn 9, with a potential third (5,1) later, and avoids all walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: R \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 7, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? Let me confirm: x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 units, similarly for y, so yes, 8x8 grid. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), body at (3,5). Since head direction is down, which is decreasing y, so moving south. Head at (3,4), moving to (3,3) next if it continues down? Direction D means down, so y decreases. Current head (3,4), direction down, so next position would be (3,3) if it moves down.\n\nSnake has two segments: head (3,4) and tail (3,5). So the snake is short, only length 2.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 7, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t + N - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nThe description says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L. For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t if possible.\n\nSimilarly, here at turn 7:\n\n- (1,1): value 1, life span 3 → will disappear after turn 9? Life span 3 at turn 7: after turn 7, countdown to 2; after turn 8, to 1; after turn 9, to 0, so disappears at turn 10? I need to clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So at turn t, countdown is N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until countdown 0 at some turn, and it disappears after that turn or at the start of next turn?\n\nThe key point: it can be eaten as long as countdown >0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the turn starts or after?\n\nThe description says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it is gone. But with countdown decreasing each turn including current.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, food with life span L has L turns left including this one. After the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases by 1. So if L=1, it can be eaten on turn t, and after turn t, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, for L=3 at turn 7: it can be eaten on turn 7,8,9, and after turn 9, it disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nLife span N at turn t: available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1; disappears at turn t+N.\n\nFor (1,1): life span 3 at turn 7, so available turns 7,8,9; gone turn 10.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (5,3): value 1, life span 3 → available turns 7,8,9\n\n- (5,6): value 1, life span 3 → available turns 7,8,9\n\n- (5,1): value 1, life span 7 → available turns 7 to 13\n\n- (6,3): value 1, life span 10 → available turns 7 to 16\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all.\n\nNow, snake head direction: down, so current direction is D.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since current direction is D, reverse would be U, so I cannot move up immediately. Allowed moves: D (same direction), L (left), R (right), but not U.\n\nReverse of down is up, so yes, cannot move up.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo cells with walls: all (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7, (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, and specifically (5,2) is also a wall.\n\n(5,2) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), tail at (3,5). Since snake is moving down, from (3,5) to (3,4)? Positions are given as [(3,4), (3,5)], head first, so head is (3,4), and (3,5) is the body segment, which is the tail.\n\nSince head is moving down, it came from above, so previous position was (3,5), moved to (3,4) by going down? Let's see: direction is down, so at previous turn, head was at (3,5), moved down to (3,4). So the body segment at (3,5) is where the tail is now.\n\nIn terms of movement, when snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might become available if not grown.\n\nBut here, snake length is 2, so after eating food, it grows by one segment.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) probably bottom-left or top-left? Usually in coordinates, (0,0) is bottom-left, but in programming, sometimes top-left. But since y=0 and y=7 are walls, and direction down decreases y, so likely y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa.\n\nDirection down: (x,y) to (x,y-1), so if y decreases, that means y=0 is the bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n\nIf head at (3,4) moving down to (3,3), so y decreases, so lower y is down, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls, but since it's borders, all edge cells are walls.\n\nSpecifically, for any x, if y=0 or y=7, it's wall; for any y, if x=0 or x=7, it's wall. So corners are included.\n\nThen internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, snake: head (3,4), tail (3,5). So at (3,5), which is above head? Head (3,4), tail (3,5), and since y=5 is higher than y=4, and direction down, so yes, tail is north of head.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (1,1) - bottom-left area\n\n- (5,3) - near the obstacle? (5,2) is obstacle, so (5,3) is above it\n\n- (5,6) - top row, but y=6, since y=7 is wall, so row 6\n\n- (5,1) - bottom, near (5,2) obstacle? (5,1) is at bottom, since y=1\n\n- (6,3) - right side, x=6, y=3\n\nNow, life spans:\n\n- (1,1): life 3, available turns 7,8,9\n\n- (5,3): life 3, available 7,8,9\n\n- (5,6): life 3, available 7,8,9\n\n- (5,1): life 7, available 7 to 13\n\n- (6,3): life 10, available 7 to 16\n\nCurrent turn is 7, so the foods with life 3 must be eaten by turn 9 or they disappear.\n\nSnake is at (3,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4):\n\n- Down (D): to (3,3)\n\n- Left (L): to (2,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,4)\n\n- Up (U): but reverse, not allowed, since current direction down.\n\nCannot move up.\n\nNow, check if these moves are safe.\n\nFirst, (3,3): is it wall or body? Walls: (3,3) is not border, since x=3 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (3,3). Body: snake is at (3,4) and (3,5), so (3,3) is empty. So safe to move down? But after moving, head at (3,3), tail moves from (3,5) to where? When snake moves, head goes to new cell, tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment, but since length 2, tail was at (3,5), after head moves to (3,3), the body becomes (3,3) and (3,4), tail at (3,4). But (3,4) was head, now body.\n\nIn terms of collision, when moving to (3,3), it was not occupied by body before move, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, left to (2,4): not border, not obstacle, not body, so safe.\n\nRight to (4,4): same.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAlso, food can be under body, but here no food under snake, since snake at (3,4) and (3,5), food at other places.\n\nNow, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see which food to target.\n\nThe foods with short life: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\n(5,1) and (6,3) have longer life.\n\nDistance to them.\n\nFrom current head (3,4) to:\n\n- (1,1): Manhattan distance |3-1| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (5,3): |3-5| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (5,6): |3-5| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (5,1): |3-5| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (6,3): |3-6| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nBut distances can be more due to obstacles or paths.\n\nAlso, need to consider that after eating, snake grows, so paths might be blocked.\n\nSince snake is short, not much issue now.\n\nFirst, (5,3) is close, only distance 3, and available now.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is distance 4, but longer life.\n\nBut (5,3) has life 3, so need to eat soon.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is distance 4, also life 3.\n\n(1,1) is far, distance 5.\n\nNow, also, the obstacle at (5,2) might affect reaching (5,3) or (5,1).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), obstacle at (5,2), so (5,3) is accessible, but from where.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is below obstacle.\n\nNow, possible moves.\n\nI need to plan sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the answer format is to give actions for turns starting from t1=7, and probably for several turns, at least 5 ahead? The user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but answer format is to list actions for each turn, starting from current turn.\n\nThe boxed answer should have actions for turn 7, turn 8, etc., up to some point.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it's a sequence, I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nI should plan a path to get food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent: head (3,4), direction down.\n\nPossible actions: D, L, R\n\nIf move D to (3,3): now head at (3,3), tail at (3,4). Direction becomes down, since moved down.\n\nThen from (3,3), can move D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3), not U (reverse).\n\nIf move L to (2,4): head at (2,4), direction left? After moving left, new direction is left, so cannot move right next.\n\nSimilarly for R.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to (5,3) quickly.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (3,4), one way is to go right twice and down once, but with direction.\n\nCurrent position (3,4), can move right to (4,4), then from there, can move down to (4,3) or right to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), so from (4,4) to (5,3) is right and down, but not adjacent directly; (4,4) to (5,3) is diagonal, not allowed, must move horizontally or vertically.\n\nSo from (4,4), to reach (5,3), need to move to (5,4) or (4,3) first.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4), if I move down to (3,3), then right to (4,3), then right to (5,3), that would take three moves: turn 7 down, turn 8 right, turn 9 right to (5,3), but turn 9 is the last chance for (5,3) since life 3, available turn 9.\n\nLife span: at turn 7, life 3, available turn 7,8,9. So turn 9 is last to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly: from (3,4), move right to (4,4) on turn 7.\n\nThen on turn 8, from (4,4), I can move down to (4,3) or right to (5,4).\n\nIf move down to (4,3), then on turn 9, from (4,3), I can move right to (5,3) to eat.\n\nYes, that works: turn 7 R to (4,4), turn 8 D to (4,3), turn 9 R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go via down first: turn 7 D to (3,3), turn 8 R to (4,3), turn 9 R to (5,3), same.\n\nBut in the first way, after turn 8 at (4,3), I can go to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nNow, is (5,3) safe? When I eat at (5,3), snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (5,3), body at (4,3) and tail at (3,4) or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt turn 7 start: snake positions [(3,4), (3,5)]\n\nAfter action: say move R to (4,4)\n\nThen new positions: head moves to (4,4), tail moves? When head moves to new cell, the body follows, so the segment that was at (3,4) becomes body, and tail at (3,5) is removed? No.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail position is vacated.\n\nWith two segments: head at A, body at B.\n\nAfter move, head to new cell C, body moves to previous head position A, so now snake is at [C, A], tail at A.\n\nIn this case, start: head (3,4), body (3,5)\n\nAfter move right to (4,4): head now (4,4), body moves to (3,4), so positions [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 8, move down to (4,3): head to (4,3), body to (4,4), so positions [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nThen on turn 9, move right to (5,3): head to (5,3), which has food, so eat, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new positions: head at (5,3), body segments: the previous body (4,4) remains, and a new segment added at the previous tail position? When eating, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place.\n\nAfter move to food cell, head is on food, so it eats, length increases by one, so the tail does not move; a new tail segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving, but since tail didn't move, it's the same.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving head to food cell, the body moves as usual, but the tail position is not removed; instead, it stays, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nExample: before move, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new, B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., T to previous position, so T position vacated.\n\nAfter move with eating: head to new (food), B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., but T stays, and a new segment is added at T, so now snake has one more segment, tail at T.\n\nIn this case, with two segments.\n\nBefore turn 9: positions [(4,3), (4,4)] so head (4,3), body (4,4)\n\nMove to (5,3), which has food.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,3), body moves to previous head (4,3), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so the body segment that was at (4,4) remains? No.\n\nPositions before move: [head: (4,3), body: (4,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3): now head is (5,3), the body segment moves to the previous head position (4,3). But since it ate, the tail (which was (4,4)) does not move; it stays as a body segment, and a new segment is added? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: the body segments move to the position of the previous segment. Only the head moves to a new cell.\n\nWhen eating, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows.\n\nSo in sequence:\n\n- Before move: segments S0 (head), S1 (body), ..., Sk (tail)\n\n- After move to non-food: new head at new position, S1 moves to S0 old, S2 to S1 old, ..., Sk moves to Sk-1 old, so Sk old position vacated.\n\n- After move to food: new head at food, S1 moves to S0 old, S2 to S1 old, ..., Sk stays, and since it ate, Sk remains, and a new segment is added after Sk? No, the tail doesn't move, so the position Sk is still occupied, and the segments are: new head, then S0 old position for S1, etc., up to Sk, which is the tail.\n\nAfter eating, the tail remains in place, so the snake has the same segments plus the new head position, and the tail is not advanced, so it grows by one.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore turn 9 move: positions [ (4,3), (4,4) ] so head (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nMove head to (5,3): new head (5,3), the body segment that was tail (4,4) moves to the previous head position (4,3)? No.\n\nThe body segments: the first body segment S1 moves to where the head was.\n\nIn this case, only one body segment, which is also the tail.\n\nSo when head moves from (4,3) to (5,3), the body segment at (4,4) moves to where the head was, which is (4,3). But since it ate, the tail doesn't move; instead, the segment at (4,4) stays, and a new segment is not added; the growth means that after the move, the tail position is not removed.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: the snake moves, head to new cell. If not eating, tail cell is left. If eating, tail cell is not left, and the new tail is the old tail position, so snake longer.\n\nIn positions:\n\nAfter move without eating: new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_body...] but the last segment is removed.\n\nWith two segments: before move [H, T]\n\nAfter move to new cell C: [C, H] and T position is empty.\n\nAfter move to food: [C, H, T] because T stays, so now three segments.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in turn 9: before move, positions [(4,3), (4,4)] head (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nMove to (5,3): eat food, so new positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nAnd snake length 3.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI can reach (5,3) by turn 9 with the moves: turn 7 R to (4,4), turn 8 D to (4,3), turn 9 R to (5,3) eat.\n\nFrom current, I could go down first: turn 7 D to (3,3), then turn 8 R to (4,3), turn 9 R to (5,3) same.\n\nBut with right first, on turn 8 I am at (4,3), which is closer to (6,3) or other food.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), (6,3) is at (6,3), so can go right twice.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), available till turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,4), distance 4, so possible to reach by turn 9.\n\nFor example, turn 7 R to (4,4), turn 8 R to (5,4), turn 9 U to (5,5)? (5,6) is y=6, current y=4, so need to go up.\n\ny=4 to y=6, up two steps.\n\nFrom (3,4), move up? But cannot, reverse direction, current direction down, cannot move up.\n\nSo must move D, L, or R.\n\nIf move R to (4,4), then from (4,4), direction right, so can move U, D, R, not L (reverse).\n\nThen to go to (5,6), which is up and right.\n\nFrom (4,4), can move U to (4,5), then U to (4,6), then R to (5,6), but (4,6) to (5,6) is turn 9 if start turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4) R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4) U to (4,5)  // assuming can move up, since direction now right, not reverse.\n\nTurn 9: U to (4,6)  // but (4,6) not (5,6), and (5,6) is at (5,6)\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,6) not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,5) move R to (5,5), then U to (5,6) on turn 10, but turn 10 is too late, (5,6) disappears after turn 9, so last chance turn 9.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 8, move U to (4,5), but then to (5,6) on turn 9, not possible directly; must go to (5,5) or (5,6), but from (4,5), can move R to (5,5) on turn 9, but (5,5) not food, (5,6) is food but not reached.\n\nSo cannot reach (5,6) by turn 9 from here easily.\n\nAlternative: from current (3,4), move R to (4,4) turn 7, then turn 8 R to (5,4), then turn 9 U to (5,5)? (5,6) is above, so need U to (5,5) then U to (5,6) on turn 10, late.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6), but (5,5) on turn 9, (5,6) on turn 10, not available.\n\nIf I go up earlier, but I cannot from start.\n\nAnother way: move left or down first.\n\nSay turn 7 D to (3,3), then turn 8 R to (4,3), then turn 9 R to (5,3) as before for (5,3).\n\nBut for (5,6), it's farther.\n\nFrom (3,3) after turn 7 D, then turn 8 R to (4,3), but (4,3) to (5,6) is not direct.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nMove L to (2,4) turn 7, then from (2,4) can move U, D, L, not R (since direction left, reverse right not allowed).\n\nThen to (5,6) even farther.\n\nSo probably cannot reach (5,6) by turn 9 with current position; it's too far or path not direct.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is at (1,1), from (3,4), need to go left and down, but cannot move up, so must go down or left/right first.\n\nIf move D to (3,3) turn 7, then D to (3,2) turn 8, then L to (2,2) or something, but (1,1) not reached.\n\nTurn 7 D to (3,3), turn 8 L to (2,3), turn 9 D to (2,2), then turn 10 to (2,1) or (1,2), but (1,1) needs from (2,1) L and D, but not adjacent, so at least turn 11 to reach, too late.\n\nSimilarly, other paths, minimum distance 5, so at least 5 moves, turn 7,8,9,10,11, but last chance turn 9, so impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) might be reachable if I go directly right and up, but with direction constraint.\n\nCurrent direction down, cannot move up.\n\nSo from (3,4), if I move R to (4,4) turn 7, then from (4,4) direction right, can move U to (4,5) turn 8, then to (4,6) or (5,5) on turn 9, not (5,6).\n\nIf from (4,4) move R to (5,4) turn 8, then U to (5,5) turn 9, but (5,5) not food, (5,6) above, need another move.\n\nSo cannot reach (5,6) by turn 9.\n\n(5,3) is reachable by turn 9 as I thought.\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), distance 4, life 10, so not urgent.\n\n(5,1) at (5,1), life 7, not urgent.\n\nSo the only food I can get soon is (5,3) by turn 9.\n\n(5,3) is available, and I can reach it.\n\nMoreover, after getting it, snake grows to length 3.\n\nNow, but I need to think about risks.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,3), positions head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nNow, direction after moving right to (5,3), so direction right.\n\nThen I can consider next food.\n\nBut there is (6,3) at (6,3), which is adjacent right, so I could go there immediately on turn 10.\n\nBut let's not jump ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 7 action.\n\nI need to start moving towards (5,3).\n\nAs above, I can go right or down first.\n\nIf I go right to (4,4) on turn 7, then down to (4,3) on turn 8, then right to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nIf I go down to (3,3) on turn 7, then right to (4,3) on turn 8, then right to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nWith down first: after turn 7 D to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (3,4)\n\nThen turn 8 R to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (3,3)  // tail at (3,3)\n\n(4,3) has no food? (4,3) is empty, I think, no food listed.\n\nThen turn 9 R to (5,3) eat, positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), and since ate, tail (3,3) stays? Before move: positions [(4,3), (3,3)] head (4,3), tail (3,3)\n\nMove to (5,3): eat, so new positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nWith right first: turn 7 R to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 8 D to (4,3), positions: [(4,3), (4,4)]  // head (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 9 R to (5,3) eat, positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n\nIn both cases, after eating, snake at (5,3), (4,3), and either (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nNow, the position (4,4) might be better for accessing other areas, like (5,6) or (6,3), but (5,6) is gone, and (6,3) is at (6,3).\n\n(4,4) is closer to (6,3) than (3,3), since from (4,4) to (6,3) is |2| + |-1| = 3, from (3,3) to (6,3) is 3 + 0 = 3, same Manhattan, but with obstacles.\n\n(5,2) obstacle, but (6,3) not affected directly.\n\nAlso, (5,1) below.\n\nBut since (5,3) is eaten, and snake there.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to survive and get more food.\n\nThere is also (5,1) and (6,3).\n\n(5,1) at (5,1), which is below the obstacle (5,2), so to reach it, I need to go around, since (5,2) is wall.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go left, right, down, but down to (5,2) is wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (5,3), after eating, direction right, so possible moves: U (up, to (5,4)), D (down, to (5,2) but wall, not possible), L (left, to (4,3)), R (right, to (6,3)).\n\n(6,3) has food, so I could go there directly if possible.\n\nBut let's think turns.\n\nFirst, I need to decide turn 7 action.\n\nPerhaps going right first is better because on turn 8 I am at (4,3) which is closer to (6,3) if I want to go there after.\n\nBut (6,3) has long life, so not urgent.\n\nThere is also the food at (5,1), which has life 7, available till turn 13.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), since (5,2) is wall, I need to go via (4,1) or (6,1), etc.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), then down to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut let's plan sequence.\n\nSince the user said \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan actions for turns 7 to 12 or so.\n\nBut answer format is to list actions starting from turn 7.\n\nI could do that.\n\nBut I need to choose a path.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, no food under tail now.\n\nAlso, after moving, positions change.\n\nPerhaps for now, go for (5,3) since it's time-sensitive.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) cannot be reached, so ignore.\n\n(1,1) cannot be reached in time.\n\nSo target (5,3) for turn 9.\n\nNow, for turn 7, I can move right or down.\n\nIf I move right to (4,4), then on turn 8 I move down to (4,3), which is one step from (5,3).\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), then to (4,3) on turn 8.\n\nBut (4,3) is the same in both cases on turn 8.\n\nIn the first case, when I move to (4,4) on turn 7, the position (4,4) might be useful if there was food, but no food there.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), if I have tail at (4,4), I can go up to (5,4) etc., but no food there immediately.\n\nWhereas if tail at (3,3), I can go to other areas.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nAnother point: the grid has walls, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, bottom-left area with (1,1), but it will disappear, so not necessary to go.\n\nNow, (6,3) is close, at (6,3), which I can reach after eating (5,3).\n\nFor example, on turn 10, from (5,3) with direction right, I can move right to (6,3) to eat, since (6,3) has food.\n\nThen snake grows to length 4.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 7: I choose to move right to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 8: move down to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 9: move right to (5,3) eat.\n\nNow, after that, positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)  // from earlier simulation\n\nDirection after moving right to (5,3), so direction right.\n\nNow, from (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (5,4)\n\n- Down: to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, not possible\n\n- Left: to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, collision? (4,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\n- Right: to (6,3), which has food.\n\nSo only possible moves are up or right.\n\nRight to (6,3) has food, so I can eat it immediately.\n\nUp to (5,4) is empty.\n\nBut (6,3) has food, so better to eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? Moving to (6,3): not wall, not body? Body is at (4,3) and (4,4), (6,3) is empty, so safe.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3), eat, so snake grows: positions before move: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nMove head to (6,3): new head (6,3), body moves to (5,3), tail stays at (4,4), so positions [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,4) ] head (6,3), body (5,3), tail (4,4)\n\nLength 4.\n\nDirection after moving right to (6,3), so direction right.\n\nNow, from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (6,4)\n\n- Down: to (6,2)\n\n- Left: to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, collision\n\n- Right: to (7,3), but x=7 is wall, not possible.\n\nSo can move up or down.\n\nNow, other food: (5,1) at (5,1), which is below.\n\nBut (5,2) obstacle, so to reach (5,1), I need to go around, e.g., via (6,2) or (4,2), etc.\n\n(5,1) has life span 7, at turn 7, so available till turn 13.\n\nCurrent turn after turn 9 is turn 10? Let's keep track of turns.\n\nTurn 7: move\n\nTurn 8: move\n\nTurn 9: move and eat (5,3)\n\nNow turn 10: from (5,3) move to (6,3) and eat.\n\nSo turn 10: action to move right to (6,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 11: at (6,3), can move up or down.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is left and down from (6,3).\n\nBut (5,2) wall, so cannot go directly left to (5,3) because body.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move down to (6,2), for example.\n\nThen from (6,2), can move left to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall, not possible.\n\nOr down to (6,1), then left to (5,1).\n\n(6,1) is not wall? y=1, x=6, not border? Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,1) is within, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) not wall.\n\nBut (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo from (6,3), move down to (6,2) turn 11.\n\nThen from (6,2), can move down to (6,1) turn 12.\n\nThen from (6,1), move left to (5,1) turn 13 to eat, since life span 7, available turn 13? Life span at turn 7 is 7, so available turns 7 to 13? Disappears after turn 13, so can be eaten turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is the last chance.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nBut we are at turn 11 after moving to (6,2).\n\nSequence:\n\nAfter turn 10: positions head (6,3), body (5,3), tail (4,4)\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 11: move down to (6,2)  // now positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (5,3)? Before move: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,4) ]\n\nMove head to (6,2): new head (6,2), body moves: first body segment to previous head (6,3), second body segment to previous first body (5,3), but there are two body segments? Positions: index 0 head (6,3), index 1 body (5,3), index 2 tail (4,4)\n\nAfter move down to (6,2): new head (6,2), index 1 moves to old head position (6,3), index 2 moves to old index 1 position (5,3), and since not eating, tail position (4,4) vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (5,3)\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen turn 12: from (6,2), can move down to (6,1), since y decreases.\n\n(6,1) not wall, not body? Body at (6,3) and (5,3), (6,1) empty.\n\nMove to (6,1): new head (6,1), body to (6,2), tail to (6,3)? Positions before: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ]\n\nMove to (6,1): new head (6,1), index 1 to (6,2), index 2 to (6,3), and (5,3) vacated? Index 2 moves to old index 1 position (6,3), so positions [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] head (6,1), body (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen turn 13: from (6,1), can move left to (5,1), which has food, so eat.\n\n(5,1) is food, so move to (5,1), eat, so new positions: head (5,1), body moves to (6,1), tail stays at (6,3)? Before move: positions [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] head (6,1), tail (6,3)\n\nMove to (5,1): new head (5,1), body moves: first body to old head (6,1), second body to old first body (6,2), and since ate, tail (6,3) remains, so positions [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ]\n\nNow, snake longer.\n\nBut is this efficient? We got two food: (5,3) and (6,3) quickly, and then (5,1) by turn 13.\n\nBut we missed (5,6) and (1,1), but they expired.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need actions from turn 7.\n\nIn the above, I assumed turn 7 move right, but let's confirm if other options.\n\nBack to turn 7.\n\nIf I move down first to (3,3), then turn 8 right to (4,3), turn 9 right to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen after, positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (3,3)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (5,3), can move right to (6,3) to eat on turn 10.\n\n(6,3) is available.\n\nMove to (6,3) eat: positions before: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nMove to (6,3): new head (6,3), body to (5,3), tail to (4,3)? Not eating? Move to food, so eat: new head (6,3), body moves to (5,3), and tail (3,3) remains? Before move: head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (3,3)\n\nAfter move to (6,3) eat: new head (6,3), body moves to old head position (5,3), and since ate, tail (3,3) stays, so positions [ (6,3), (5,3), (3,3) ]? Body: the segment that was body moves to (5,3), and tail remains (3,3), so positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), tail (3,3)\n\nThen from (6,3), as before, can move down to (6,2) turn 11, etc. to (5,1).\n\nBut tail is at (3,3), which is far, but not a problem.\n\nCompared to previous, in the first path, after eating (6,3), tail was at (4,4), closer to bottom.\n\nBut not significant.\n\nIn the first path with move right first, after turn 9, tail at (4,4), which is higher y.\n\nBut for going to (5,1), it might be similar.\n\nNow, another food: (5,6) is gone, but there might be more later, but not given, so only these food.\n\nThe state has only these food listed.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should get all possible, but (5,6) and (1,1) expire soon.\n\nSince (5,1) and (6,3) are available longer.\n\nIn the sequence above, I can get (5,3), (6,3), and (5,1).\n\n(5,1) at (5,1), and after eating, I need to survive.\n\nBut grid is open.\n\nNow, for turn 7 action, either right or down is fine, but let's choose one.\n\nPerhaps move right to (4,4) to be more central.\n\nBut I think down is also ok.\n\nBut with move right, on turn 8 I am at (4,3), which is directly left of (5,3), so I can go right to it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the tail reward danger: but not applicable here, no food under tail.\n\nAlso, when I move to (6,3), it is food, and head was not adjacent to tail in a way that causes issue.\n\nFor example, before moving to (6,3), at (5,3), tail is at (4,4) or (3,3), not adjacent to head, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the plan seems good.\n\nNow, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe user said \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence.\n\nFor example, from turn 7 to turn 12 or so.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 7: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 9: R to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 10: R to (6,3) eat  // from (5,3) to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 11: D to (6,2)  // from (6,3)\n\nTurn 12: D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 13: L to (5,1) eat\n\nBut turn 13 is beyond, but for now, I can list up to turn 12 or as needed.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to list actions starting from turn 7.\n\nAlso, for the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if all is safe.\n\nAfter turn 10, at (6,3), I move down to (6,2), but is (6,2) safe? Not wall, not body, yes.\n\nThen to (6,1), safe.\n\nThen to (5,1), eat.\n\nBut at turn 13, (5,1) is available since life span 7, available turn 13.\n\nLife span at turn 7: 7, so available turns 7,8,9,10,11,12,13; disappears turn 14.\n\nSo turn 13 is last chance, yes.\n\nNow, after that, no more food, but I can continue moving to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, since the state may change, I think providing up to turn 12 is fine, or until the food is got.\n\nBut the user might expect a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nCurrent turn 7, so 5 turns ahead: turn 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nSo actions for turn 7 to 11.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: R (to (5,3) eat)\n\nTurn 10: R (to (6,3) eat)\n\nTurn 11: D (to (6,2))\n\nThen turn 12 would be D to (6,1), but not in 5 turns.\n\nFor turn 11, at (6,2), I could move elsewhere, but to get (5,1), moving down is necessary.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 11.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but outputting the actions.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 9, when I move to (5,3), it is food, and I eat, which is good.\n\nSimilarly turn 10 to (6,3) eat.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to specify the direction.\n\nAlso, in the format, it should be like \"Turn 7: R\" etc.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better path.\n\nFor example, after getting (5,3), instead of going to (6,3), I could go up to (5,4), but (5,4) no food, and (5,6) is expiring, but I cannot reach it by turn 9 from there.\n\nAfter turn 9 at (5,3), turn 10 move up to (5,4), then turn 11 to (5,5), turn 12 to (5,6), but (5,6) disappears after turn 9? Life span 3 at turn 7, available till turn 9, gone turn 10, so cannot.\n\nSimilarly, not possible.\n\nSo going to (6,3) is better.\n\nThen down to get (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) can be gotten later.\n\nFor the immediate, I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for turn 7, I decide to move right.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: R\n\nThen for turn 10: from (5,3) to (6,3) R\n\nTurn 11: from (6,3) to (6,2) D\n\nThen I can add turn 12: to (6,1) D, but not necessary.\n\nSince the user said \"maximize score\", getting (5,1) is good, so include.\n\nBut in answer, list as many as reasonable.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 7 to 11.\n\nIn turn 11, I move down to (6,2), which is towards (5,1).\n\nNow, another point: after moving to (6,2) on turn 11, from there I can move left? But (5,2) is wall, so cannot, only down or up or right, but right to (7,2) wall, so only down or up.\n\nDown to (6,1), then left to (5,1).\n\nBut not immediate.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide actions from turn 7 to turn 11.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nFirst, current turn t1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: R (right)\n\nTurn 8: D (down)\n\nTurn 9: R (right) to eat (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10: R (right) to eat (6,3)\n\nTurn 11: D (down)\n\nNow, for turn 11, moving down to (6,2).\n\nThen beyond, but not listed.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the food, there is (5,1), but I can get it later.\n\nSince the state might have new food, but not specified, so assume only these.\n\nI think for now, this is fine.\n\nBut in turn 9, when I move to (5,3), I eat, and on turn 10 to (6,3) eat, so I get two food quickly.\n\nThen moving down.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: R\nTurn 10: R\nTurn 11: D\n}\n\nBut turn 11 D is to (6,2), which is safe.\n\nTo think more long-term, after turn 11, I can go to (6,1) then to (5,1), but not in sequence.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nIf I move down first on turn 7, similar, but I think right is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 7):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid (x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7) with borders as walls and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (3,4), tail at (3,5), length 2, current direction Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 3 (available turns 7, 8, 9; disappears turn 10).\n  - (5,3): Value +1, life span 3 (available turns 7, 8, 9; disappears turn 10).\n  - (5,6): Value +1, life span 3 (available turns 7, 8, 9; disappears turn 10).\n  - (5,1): Value +1, life span 7 (available turns 7 to 13; disappears turn 14).\n  - (6,3): Value +1, life span 10 (available turns 7 to 16; disappears turn 17).\n- **Movement Constraints**: Current direction is Down, so cannot move Up (reverse) on the next turn. Allowed moves from (3,4) are Down (to (3,3)), Left (to (2,4)), or Right (to (4,4)).\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:**\n- **Time-sensitive food**: (1,1), (5,3), and (5,6) must be eaten by turn 9 or lost. However:\n  - (1,1) is at Manhattan distance 5 (|3-1| + |4-1| = 5), requiring at least 5 moves. With only 3 turns (7, 8, 9) available, it is unreachable by turn 9.\n  - (5,6) is at Manhattan distance 4 (|3-5| + |4-6| = 4), but the path requires moving Up, which is blocked by the reverse direction constraint on turn 7. Even with optimal moves, it cannot be reached by turn 9 due to the need for multiple Up moves.\n  - (5,3) is at Manhattan distance 3 (|3-5| + |4-3| = 3) and can be reached by turn 9 with a safe path. It is the only time-sensitive food achievable.\n- **Long-term food**: (5,1) and (6,3) have longer life spans and can be targeted after securing (5,3). (6,3) is adjacent to (5,3) and can be eaten immediately on turn 10 if the snake moves right after eating (5,3).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - The obstacle at (5,2) blocks direct downward movement from (5,3), but paths to (5,1) and (6,3) are safe.\n  - Snake growth must be managed to avoid self-collision. After eating (5,3) and (6,3), the snake length increases, but the planned path avoids dead ends and collisions.\n  - No food is under the snake body initially, and the tail reward danger is not triggered in this sequence.\n- **Path Optimization**: \n  - Target (5,3) by turn 9: Move Right on turn 7 to (4,4), Down on turn 8 to (4,3), Right on turn 9 to (5,3) to eat.\n  - Then target (6,3) on turn 10: Move Right from (5,3) to (6,3) to eat.\n  - After (6,3), move Down toward (5,1) for future eating by turn 13. The path (6,3) → (6,2) on turn 11 → (6,1) on turn 12 → (5,1) on turn 13 is safe and efficient.\n- **Survival Focus**: The plan avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 11, continuing downward sets up for (5,1) without risk.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 7 to 11):**\n- **Turn 7**: Move Right (R) to (4,4). This starts the path toward (5,3) and avoids the reverse direction constraint. Position: Head (4,4), tail (3,4).\n- **Turn 8**: Move Down (D) to (4,3). This positions the snake one cell left of (5,3). Position: Head (4,3), tail (4,4).\n- **Turn 9**: Move Right (R) to (5,3) to eat. (5,3) is eaten, snake grows to length 3. Position: Head (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,4). Direction is now Right.\n- **Turn 10**: Move Right (R) to (6,3) to eat. (6,3) is eaten, snake grows to length 4. Position: Head (6,3), body (5,3), tail (4,4). Direction is now Right.\n- **Turn 11**: Move Down (D) to (6,2). This moves toward (5,1) for future eating (by turn 13) and avoids walls/body. Position: Head (6,2), body (6,3), tail (5,3).\n\n**Beyond Turn 11 (for context, not part of answer):**\n- Turn 12: Move Down (D) to (6,1) to approach (5,1).\n- Turn 13: Move Left (L) to (5,1) to eat, utilizing the full life span of (5,1).\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating three high-value foods ((5,3), (6,3), and (5,1)) with minimal risk, while ensuring long-term survival. The actions for turns 7-11 are safe and optimal based on 5+ turn lookahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: R\nTurn 10: R\nTurn 11: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 8, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nThe snake is at positions: head at (4,4), body at (3,4). Since it's only two segments, the tail is at (3,4). The head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (4,4) from (3,4), I assume. Direction is given as R, so current heading is right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 8, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will be gone after turn T + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf life span is N at turn T, then:\n\n- At turn T: life span N\n\n- Turn T+1: life span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn T + (N-1): life span 1\n\n- Turn T + N: gone\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn T to turn T + N - 1.\n\nFor food at (1,1): turn 8, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9, gone after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): life span 2, same.\n\n(5,6): life span 2.\n\n(5,1): life span 6, so available for 6 turns from turn 8.\n\n(6,3): life span 9, available for 9 turns.\n\nAll have value 1, positive food.\n\nNow, snake is at [(4,4), (3,4)], head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) next, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nCurrent head direction R, so next move cannot be L.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake head at (4,4). Let's see possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): (4,5) - is this within bounds? y=5, x=4. Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=5 is fine, x=4 is between 0 and 7, not wall. Also, no internal obstacle at (4,5), I think only (5,2) is obstacle. So (4,5) should be free, but need to check if occupied by snake body.\n\nSnake body: only one segment at (3,4), so (4,5) is empty. But food might be there, but no food at (4,5), from the list.\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,1), (6,3). So (4,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, Down (D): (4,3) - y=3, x=4, not wall, not obstacle, not snake body (snake at (4,4) and (3,4)), so free.\n\nRight (R): (5,4) - x=5, y=4. Now, x=5 is not wall (walls x=0,x=7), y=4 not wall. But internal obstacle at (5,2), which is different cell. (5,4) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free? Obstacle only at (5,2), so (5,4) is fine. No food there, snake body not there.\n\nLeft (L): but cannot move left because current direction R, opposite not allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid mentally.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nFree cells: all except borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake: head (4,4), tail (3,4). So after one move, if I move, the tail will move, so (3,4) might be free unless I grow.\n\nCurrently length 2, if I eat food, length increases by 1.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) - value +1, life span 2 (gone after turn 9)\n\n- (5,3) - +1, life span 2 (gone after turn 9)\n\n- (5,6) - +1, life span 2 (gone after turn 9)\n\n- (5,1) - +1, life span 6 (gone after turn 13)\n\n- (6,3) - +1, life span 9 (gone after turn 16)\n\nAll positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to maximize score, but prioritize survival. Since the snake is short, I can grow, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, current turn t1=8.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 8, turn 9, turn 10, etc., but how many turns? The answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I should plan for at least 5 turns ahead, but output the sequence starting from turn 8.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the immediate turns, I think for the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 8.\n\nSince the future depends on what happens, I need to plan a strategy.\n\nAlso, food life spans are short for some, so I might want to eat the ones with short life first if possible.\n\nBut need to avoid dangers.\n\nFirst, let's list the possible moves from (4,4):\n\n- U to (4,5)\n\n- D to (4,3)\n\n- R to (5,4)\n\nAfter moving, the snake will have new head position, and the tail moves forward only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nBut for movement, when I move, the head moves to new cell, and the tail follows, so the new tail position depends on whether I ate food or not.\n\nIn this case, since I might eat food, I need to consider.\n\nBut for now, from (4,4), moving to:\n\n- (4,5): no food there, so after move, head at (4,5), body at (4,4), tail at (3,4)? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: before move: [(4,4), (3,4)]\n\nAfter move to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), then the body segments follow. Since no food eaten, the tail moves away from (3,4), so new positions: [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nSimilarly, move to (4,3): [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (5,4): [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNow, (5,4) has no food, so tail moves from (3,4) to... the last segment was (3,4), but when head moves to (5,4), the body segment at (3,4) moves to where the previous head was, which is (4,4), so new body at (4,4), head at (5,4), so positions: [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nFood at (1,1) - far away, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 9 or it's gone.\n\nTurn 8 or 9.\n\nBut from (4,4), it's at (1,1), which is far, 3 steps left and 3 down? x from 4 to 1 is 3 left, y from 4 to 1 is 3 down, but since I can only move one step per turn, I can't reach it in one move. Minimum distance: |dx| + |dy| = |4-1| + |4-1| = 3+3=6, so 6 moves away. But life span 2, so only 2 turns left, I can't reach it by turn 9. Turn 8: I move, turn 9 I move again, but after two moves, I can be at most 2 cells away, not 6. So impossible to eat (1,1). Similarly, (5,6) is at y=6, x=5, from (4,4), |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so distance 3, but life span 2, so if I go directly, I might reach in 3 moves, but only 2 turns available? Life span 2 at turn 8, so can be eaten turn 8 or 9.\n\nTurn 8: if I move towards it, I can be closer, but not reach on turn 8 or 9? Let's see positions.\n\nOn turn 8, I can move to, say, (4,5) or (5,4) or (4,3).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), from (4,4), I can move to (4,5) which is closer, then on turn 9, from (4,5) to (5,5) or (4,6), but (4,6) is y=6, which is border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (5,5) or (4,6) or (3,5) or (4,4), but (4,4) is where body is, but after move to (4,5), positions are [(4,5),(4,4)], so (4,4) is body, cannot move there.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but occupied by body, so invalid, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, to reach (5,6), from (4,5), I can move to (5,5) on turn 9, but (5,5) is not (5,6), still one away. Or from (4,5) move U to (4,6), then from (4,6) on turn 9 move R to (5,6), but that would be turn 10? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 8: I move from (4,4) to some position.\n\nIf I want to eat (5,6), which is at (5,6).\n\nOn turn 8, I need to be at (5,6) or move to it.\n\nBut from (4,4), I can move to (5,4) or (4,5), not directly to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is adjacent? (4,4) to (5,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are U, D, L, R, so (4,4) to (5,6) is diagonal, not directly reachable. I need to move to a neighbor.\n\nSo on turn 8, I can move to (5,4) or (4,5), both are closer to (5,6) than (4,4).\n\nSay I move to (5,4) on turn 8: positions [(5,4),(4,4)]\n\nThen on turn 9, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), or D to (5,3), or L to (4,4) but occupied, invalid, R to (6,4).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), but not directly to (5,6). Then on turn 10, from (5,5) to (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) has life span 2 at turn 8, so on turn 9, life span 1, can be eaten turn 9. On turn 10, it would be gone if life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 8, life span 2, so:\n\n- Turn 8: can be eaten, life span 2\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 10: gone\n\nSo to eat (5,6), I must be on (5,6) on turn 8 or 9.\n\nOn turn 8, I cannot reach (5,6) from (4,4) in one move; I can only reach adjacent cells.\n\n(5,6) is not adjacent to (4,4); adjacent are (4,5), (4,3), (5,4), (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is where tail is, but I can move to (3,4) only if it's free, but it's occupied, so not possible.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can only go to (4,5), (4,3), or (5,4).\n\nNone of which is (5,6), so I cannot eat it on turn 8.\n\nOn turn 9, I need to be at (5,6) to eat it.\n\nBut to be at (5,6) on turn 9, I need to move to it on turn 9.\n\nFrom where I am after turn 8.\n\nIf on turn 8 I move to (5,4), then on turn 9 from (5,4) I can move to (5,5), (6,4), (5,3), or (4,4) but invalid.\n\n(5,6) is not adjacent to (5,4); (5,4) to (5,6) is two steps away vertically.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,5) on turn 8, from (4,5) on turn 9 I can move to (4,6), (5,5), (3,5), or (4,4) invalid.\n\n(5,6) is adjacent to (4,6) and (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (4,6) or (5,5) on turn 9.\n\nThen from there, (4,6) to (5,6) is right, or (5,5) to (5,6) is up.\n\nBut that would be on turn 10? No, on turn 9, from (4,5) I can move to (4,6), and (4,6) is not (5,6), so I need another move to (5,6) on turn 10, but on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,5) on turn 9, (5,5) is not (5,6), so to eat on turn 9, I need to be on (5,6) on turn 9.\n\nBut from turn 8 position, the only way to reach (5,6) on turn 9 is if I am at a cell adjacent to it on turn 9.\n\nAfter turn 8 move, I am at one of (4,5), (4,3), or (5,4).\n\n(4,5) is adjacent to (5,6)? (4,5) to (5,6) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent are (4,6), (5,5), (4,4), (3,5).\n\n(5,6) has neighbors: (5,5), (5,7), (4,6), (6,6).\n\n(5,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n\n(6,6) is free, I think.\n\nBut from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (5,5), both of which are adjacent to (5,6).\n\nBut on turn 9, if I am at (4,6), I can move to (5,6) only if I choose to, but (5,6) is a separate cell.\n\nTo be at (5,6) on turn 9, I must move to it on turn 9 from my position at the start of turn 9.\n\nAt start of turn 9, my head is at the position I moved to on turn 8.\n\nSo if on turn 8 I move to (4,5), then at start of turn 9, head at (4,5), and I can move to (4,6), (5,5), etc., but not directly to (5,6) because it's not adjacent from (4,5).\n\nThe only cells adjacent to (5,6) are (5,5), (4,6), and (6,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (4,6) on turn 9, but (4,6) is not (5,6), so I am at (4,6) on turn 9, not at (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 10, I could move to (5,6), but it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,5) on turn 9 from (4,5), I am at (5,5) on turn 9, not (5,6).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,6) on turn 8 or 9 from current position. The closest I can be is adjacent on turn 9, but not on it.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (5,6) because it disappears after turn 9, and I can't reach it by then.\n\nSimilarly for (1,1): even farther, |dx|=3, |dy|=3, distance 6, impossible in 2 turns.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (4,4), |dx|=1, |dy|=1, distance 2.\n\nLife span 2, so can be eaten turn 8 or 9.\n\nOn turn 8, I can move to (5,4) or (4,3) or (4,5), none of which is (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to (4,4)? (4,4) to (5,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent are (4,5), (4,3), (5,4), (3,4).\n\n(5,3) has neighbors: (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3).\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, wall? Internal obstacle at (5,2), so blocked.\n\nSo (5,3) can be accessed from (5,4), (4,3), or (6,3).\n\nFrom current position (4,4), I can move to (5,4) or (4,3) on turn 8.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) on turn 8, then on turn 9 from (5,4) I can move D to (5,3), since (5,3) is down from (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,3) on turn 8, then on turn 9 from (4,3) I can move R to (5,3).\n\nSo I can eat (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: Turn 8 move R to (5,4), then turn 9 move D to (5,3) to eat food.\n\nOption 2: Turn 8 move D to (4,3), then turn 9 move R to (5,3) to eat food.\n\nNow, other foods: (5,1) at (5,1), life span 6, so available until turn 13.\n\n(6,3) at (6,3), life span 9, available until turn 16.\n\nAlso, (5,6) is impossible, (1,1) impossible.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is near (5,3), but (5,2) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n\nWalls: y=0 is wall, so y=1 is fine.\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so to reach (5,1), I must come from (5,0) but y=0 wall, or from (4,1) or (6,1), since (5,2) blocked.\n\n(5,1) neighbors: (5,0) wall, invalid; (5,2) obstacle, invalid; so only (4,1) and (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is at (6,3), neighbors: (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), (7,3) but x=7 wall, so (7,3) invalid; (6,2) and (6,4) and (5,3).\n\nNow, back to current turn.\n\nI need to choose a move for turn 8.\n\nPossible actions: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), I can then go to (5,3) on turn 9 to eat food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (4,3), I can go to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nBut moving to (4,5) might not lead directly to food.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid and possible dangers.\n\nSnake is short, only length 2, so body collision is less likely, but as it grows, need to be careful.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, no food under snake, I think.\n\nSnake at (4,4) and (3,4), no food there.\n\nFood is at other places.\n\nNow, for (5,3), if I eat it on turn 9, I grow to length 3.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,3) has life span 2, so if I don't eat it, it disappears, but I can eat it on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, I should go for the food I can eat, like (5,3).\n\nThen, after that, I can go to other foods.\n\nBut let's see the position after eating.\n\nSuppose on turn 8, I move R to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nThen on turn 9, I move D to (5,3) and eat food there, since (5,3) has food.\n\nAfter eating, length increases, so positions: head to (5,3), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so body is (5,4) and (4,4), so new positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction was down? On turn 9, I moved D, so direction down.\n\nNow, from here, I can consider next moves.\n\nFood left: (5,1), (6,3), and (5,6) gone, (1,1) gone.\n\n(5,1) at (5,1), but (5,2) is obstacle, so to reach (5,1), I need to go via (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) at (6,3).\n\nNow, from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4) but occupied by body? Positions: head (5,3), body (5,4) and (4,4).\n\n(5,4) is body segment, so I cannot move to (5,4).\n\nD to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,3) — (4,3) is free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\nR to (6,3) — (6,3) has food? Yes, (6,3) has food with life span 9.\n\nAlso, (4,3) is free, no food.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,3): L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nCannot go U or D because U to (5,4) occupied, D to (5,2) obstacle.\n\nNow, if I move R to (6,3), I eat the food there, since (6,3) has food.\n\nThen I grow, positions: head to (6,3), body: since food eaten, tail stays, so (5,3) and (5,4) and (4,4), but (4,4) is tail? Let's see: before move, positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move to (6,3) and eat, head to (6,3), body segments: the first body segment moves to previous head (5,3), and since food eaten, the tail (4,4) doesn't move, so new positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves away; if food, tail stays, and new head added, so length increases.\n\nSo positions: the new head is at new position, and the body segments are the previous positions, but the last segment remains if no food eaten, or all segments stay if food eaten.\n\nIf food eaten, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; all segments stay, head moves to new cell.\n\nSo from positions before move: [A, B, C] for length 3, head A.\n\nMove to new cell D, if D has food, then new positions: [D, A, B, C] — head D, then A, B, C.\n\nIf no food, new positions: [D, A, B] and C is removed.\n\nIn this case, before turn 9 move, positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (4,4).\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) and eating food, new positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), then (5,4), then (4,4) — so [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction right.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3) but occupied by body, invalid, R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(6,4) and (6,2) should be free.\n\n(6,4) no food, (6,2) no food.\n\nBut there is food at (5,1).\n\nNow, if on turn 9 from (5,3) I move L to (4,3) instead.\n\nThen no food at (4,3), so positions: head to (4,3), body: (5,3) and (5,4), tail (4,4) moves? No food, so tail moves away.\n\nBefore move: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (4,3): head to (4,3), then body segments: first body to (5,3), second body to (5,4), and since no food, tail (4,4) is removed, so new positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? Let's order: head (4,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes first body, then (5,4) becomes second body, and (4,4) is gone.\n\nSo [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (4,3), direction left.\n\nThen from here, I can go to (6,3) later or to (5,1).\n\nBut (6,3) is still there, life span 9.\n\nNow back to turn 8 choice.\n\nAnother option: on turn 8, move D to (4,3).\n\nThen positions: [(4,3), (4,4)] no food eaten.\n\nThen on turn 9, move R to (5,3) and eat food, similar to before.\n\nPositions after: head (5,3), body (4,3) and (4,4)? Before move: [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (5,3) eat: new positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nThen from (5,3), same as before, can go L to (4,3) but occupied, or R to (6,3), or U/D invalid as before.\n\nU to (5,4) free? (5,4) is not occupied now, in this case positions are [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)], so (5,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,2) obstacle invalid.\n\nSo from (5,3): U to (5,4), D invalid, L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3).\n\nSo possible U or R.\n\nIf U to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), tail (4,4) moves? No food, so positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] and (4,4) gone.\n\nThen head at (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (6,3) has food, so I might go there.\n\nNow, the third option on turn 8: move U to (4,5).\n\nThen positions: [(4,5), (4,4)] no food.\n\nThen on turn 9, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible: U to (4,6), D to (4,4) occupied invalid, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nNo food at these, except (5,6) but gone.\n\n(5,3) might be eaten if I go down, but from (4,5) to (4,4) invalid, to (5,5) or (4,6), not directly to (5,3).\n\nTo reach (5,3) from (4,5), I need to go down, but from (4,5) I can move D but to (4,4) which is body, invalid, or I can only go to (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n\nThen from there, say to (5,5), then down to (5,4) etc, but (5,3) might be gone by then.\n\nOn turn 9, (5,3) can be eaten, but from (4,5) I cannot reach (5,3) on turn 9.\n\n|dx|=1, |dy|=2, too far for one move.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 8, I cannot eat (5,3) on turn 9, and it disappears after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, other short life foods are gone.\n\nThen I have (5,1) and (6,3) with longer life.\n\nBut (5,1) at (5,1), life span 6, available until turn 13.\n\n(6,3) life span 9.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,5), on turn 9 I can go to say (5,5) or (4,6), then later to (6,3) or (5,1).\n\nBut let's compare risks.\n\nPerhaps moving towards (5,3) is better to get the food.\n\nMoreover, (6,3) is near (5,3), so I can eat both sequentially.\n\nIn the first scenario, if I move R on turn 8 to (5,4), then D on turn 9 to (5,3) eat, then on turn 10 from (5,3) I can move R to (6,3) to eat another food.\n\nThat seems efficient.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D on turn 8 to (4,3), then R to (5,3) on turn 9, then from (5,3) I can move R to (6,3) on turn 10.\n\nSame thing.\n\nBut if I move U, I miss the (5,3) food.\n\nNow, about (5,1): it's below, with obstacle.\n\nBut I can get it later.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nIn the sequence where I eat (5,3) and then (6,3), I grow to length 4 or so.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go down to (6,2) or up to (6,4), etc.\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), I need to reach it via (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move to (6,2) then to (6,1), but (6,1) is adjacent to (5,1)? (6,1) to (5,1) is left, adjacent.\n\n(6,1) to (5,1) is horizontal, yes.\n\nBut (5,1) might have food, but I need to be there.\n\nLife span 6, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nBut let's plan the sequence from turn 8.\n\nAlso, I need to think about tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,3) on turn 9, positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] if I came from R and D.\n\nThen if I move to (6,3) on turn 10, positions [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNow, head at (6,3), tail at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nThen I can move, say, to (6,2) or (6,4).\n\nBut (6,2) is free, no food.\n\n(6,4) free.\n\nNow, to go to (5,1), I might go to (6,2) then (6,1), then to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, other ways.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which might block paths.\n\nIn this area, moving around.\n\nBut since the snake is short, less risk of self-collision.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output sequence starting from turn 8.\n\nBut how many turns? I think I should output for turn 8,9,10,11,12, say 5 turns.\n\nBut it depends on the situation.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a sequence to eat the foods.\n\nFirst, eat (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen eat (6,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen go to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) at (5,1), from (6,3), I can go down to (6,2) on turn 11, then to (6,1) on turn 12, then to (5,1) on turn 13 to eat, since life span 6, turn 8 to 13, turn 13 is last chance? Life span 6 at turn 8, gone after turn 13.\n\nTurn 8: life 6, turn 9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, turn13:1, turn14: gone. So can be eaten up to turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life span 9, turn 8 to 16.\n\nNow, from (6,3) after eating on turn 10, positions [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nOn turn 11, I can move D to (6,2) or U to (6,4).\n\n(6,2) is free, no food.\n\nMove to (6,2), no food, so positions: head to (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), tail (4,4) moves? No food, so tail moves away: new positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] and (4,4) gone.\n\nLength 4, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so length same.\n\nPositions: head (6,2), then previous head (6,3), then (5,3), then (5,4), and (4,4) removed.\n\nSo [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nNow head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nThen on turn 12, move to (6,1)? (6,1) is free, no wall, y=1 not wall.\n\nMove to (6,1), no food, positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4) removed? No food, so tail moves: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] and (5,4) gone.\n\nThen on turn 13, from (6,1), move L to (5,1) to eat food at (5,1).\n\n(5,1) has food, so eat, grow to length 5.\n\nPositions: before move [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nMove to (5,1): (5,1) is adjacent? (6,1) to (5,1) is left, adjacent.\n\nEat food, so new positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nNow head at (5,1), direction left.\n\nThen I can move from there, but we might stop.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate three foods: (5,3), (6,3), (5,1).\n\n(5,1) eaten on turn 13.\n\nNow, back to turn 8.\n\nI have two choices to set up for (5,3): move R or D on turn 8.\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), then D to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then R to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nIf I move R to (5,4) on turn 8, then to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nAfter that, from (5,3), I can move directly to (6,3) on turn 10.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3) on turn 8, then to (5,3) on turn 9, but from (5,3), to go to (6,3) I need to move R, which is fine.\n\nBut in the first case, after moving to (5,4), I am closer to (6,3) perhaps.\n\nBut both work.\n\nNow, moving U on turn 8 might be worse because I miss (5,3).\n\nBut let's see if moving U has advantage.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (4,5) on turn 8, positions [(4,5),(4,4)]\n\nThen on turn 9, I can move to (5,5) or (4,6), say (5,5).\n\nNo food, positions [(5,5),(4,5)]\n\nThen on turn 10, I can move to (6,5) or (5,6) but (5,6) gone, or (5,4), etc.\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), from (5,5) I can move D to (5,4), then to (6,4) or something, but to reach (6,3), it takes more moves.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) move to (5,4) on turn 10, positions [(5,4),(5,5)]? Before: [(5,5),(4,5)], move to (5,4): head to (5,4), body to (5,5), tail (4,5) gone, so [(5,4),(5,5)]\n\nThen turn 11, from (5,4) move to (6,4) or (5,3), but (5,3) gone, or (4,4), etc.\n\nTo (6,4), positions [(6,4),(5,4)]\n\nThen turn 12, to (6,3) to eat (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I missed (5,3) and took longer to reach (6,3).\n\nSo better to go for the immediate food.\n\nMoreover, with moving U, I have no food eaten early.\n\nSo probably moving R or D on turn 8 is better.\n\nNow between R and D, is there a difference?\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), then to (5,3) D, then to (6,3) R.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then to (5,3) R, then to (6,3) R.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut when I move to (5,3) from different directions.\n\nIn the first case, after eating (5,3) from moving down, positions: [(5,3),(5,4),(4,4)]\n\nIn second case, from moving right to (5,3), positions: [(5,3),(4,3),(4,4)] — if I moved D then R.\n\nIn the move D then R case: turn 8 move D to (4,3), positions [(4,3),(4,4)]\n\nTurn 9 move R to (5,3) eat, positions [(5,3),(4,3),(4,4)]\n\nThen from here, to move to (6,3), I can go directly R, since (5,3) to (6,3) is adjacent.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIn the other sequence, positions [(5,3),(5,4),(4,4)], then move R to (6,3).\n\nAlso fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence with R then D, when at [(5,3),(5,4),(4,4)], the body is above, so I can only move left or right, not up because (5,4) occupied.\n\nBut I don't need to go up immediately.\n\nSimilarly, in the other, at [(5,3),(4,3),(4,4)], I can move up or right, but not down because (5,2) obstacle, not left because (4,3) occupied.\n\nBut moving right to (6,3) is possible.\n\nSo both are similar.\n\nPerhaps moving R on turn 8 is slightly better because (5,4) is closer to (6,3), but same distance.\n\n(5,4) to (6,3) is not adjacent, |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so I need two moves to reach (6,3) from (5,4), but from (5,3) I can go directly.\n\nAfter turn 9, I am at (5,3) in both cases, so same.\n\nIn both paths, after turn 9, I am at (5,3) with food eaten.\n\nThen turn 10 move to (6,3).\n\nNow, the only difference is the body positions, but since I move to (6,3), it should be fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the direction for no reverse, but since I plan the moves, I can ensure.\n\nFor example, if on turn 8 I move R, direction becomes R.\n\nThen turn 9 move D, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, if move D on turn 8, direction D, then turn 9 move R, not opposite.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo I think moving to (5,4) or (4,3) is fine.\n\nBut let's choose one.\n\nPerhaps moving R to (5,4) avoids the lower area where (5,2) obstacle is, but not really.\n\nI think I'll go with moving R on turn 8.\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) eat food\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,3) eat food\n\nNow, after turn 10, positions: as before, [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] after eating (6,3)\n\nNow turn 11: from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) or U to (6,4)\n\nI plan to go to (5,1), so move D to (6,2)\n\nNo food, so positions: head to (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), tail (4,4) moves? No food eaten, so tail moves away: new positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] and (4,4) gone.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction down.\n\nTurn 12: move to (6,1), no food, positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4) gone? [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 13: move to (5,1)? (5,1) is left from (6,1), so move L to (5,1) and eat food.\n\n(5,1) has food, so eat, grow to length 5: positions head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nNow, I have eaten all available foods except the ones that disappeared.\n\n(1,1) and (5,6) gone, (5,3) and (6,3) eaten, (5,1) eaten.\n\nSo score +3.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list actions from turn 8 to, say, turn 13 or so.\n\nBut turn 13 is when I eat (5,1), so actions up to turn 13.\n\nBut the moves: turn 8 to turn 13, that's 6 turns.\n\nSince I think 5+ turns, output for 5 turns or more.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions for each turn.\n\nNow, for turn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: R\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D? Turn 12 move to (6,1), which is down from (6,2), but direction: from (6,2) to (6,1) is down, yes.\n\nIn positions: after turn 11, at (6,2), move to (6,1) on turn 12, which is down.\n\nThen turn 13: move to (5,1) left.\n\nBut on turn 12, I am at (6,1), then turn 13 move L to (5,1).\n\nNow, is there any risk? For example, when I move to (6,1) on turn 12, no issue.\n\nThen to (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is at corner, but should be fine.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), I am at (5,1), and I can continue, but for now, I can output up to turn 13.\n\nSince the answer should start from turn 8, and go for several turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output turn 8 to turn 12, but turn 13 is when I eat, so include.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, from turn 8 to turn 12 is 5 turns ahead? Turn 8,9,10,11,12: that's 5 actions: turn 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nTurn 8: action for turn 8\n\nTurn 9: for turn 9\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 12: for turn 12.\n\nThen on turn 12 I am at (6,1), and move to (5,1) on turn 13, but not included.\n\nBut I can include turn 13.\n\nThe format doesn't specify how many, so I think output for as many as I plan.\n\nBut to be safe, output for 5 turns: turn 8 to 12.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 12 I move to (6,1), which is not eating, but turn 13 I eat.\n\nBut in the actions, I can list up to turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, in the initial plan.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,1) on turn 12, (6,1) might have something, but no, no food there.\n\nAnd no danger.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: R (right)\n\nTurn 9: D (down)\n\nTurn 10: R (right)\n\nTurn 11: D (down)\n\nTurn 12: D (down) to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 13: L (left) to (5,1) eat\n\nBut for output, I can do up to turn 12 or 13.\n\nSince the state is at turn 8, and I need actions starting turn 8.\n\nI think I'll output for turn 8 to turn 12, 5 actions.\n\nBut turn 12 I am moving to (6,1), not eating yet.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nTo include the eat, up to turn 13.\n\nBut turn 13 is turn t1+5? t1=8, t1+5=13.\n\nt1=8, turn 8,9,10,11,12: that's 5 turns: 8 to 12.\n\nTurn 8: first action, turn 9: second, etc., up to five actions.\n\nTurn 8,9,10,11,12: actions for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 13 would be sixth.\n\nBut I think it's ok to do 5.\n\nIn this case, on turn 12, I move to (6,1), then later to (5,1), but not in the sequence.\n\nBut I can adjust.\n\nAnother option: if on turn 8 I move D to (4,3), then turn 9 R to (5,3) eat, turn 10 R to (6,3) eat, same as before.\n\nThen from (6,3), instead of down, I could go up, but to go to (5,1), down is better.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 10 at (6,3), I need to go to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut in both cases similar.\n\nI think moving R on turn 8 is fine.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: R\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nBut on turn 12, I move to (6,1) from (6,2), but in the sequence above, after turn 10 at (6,3), turn 11 to (6,2), turn 12 to (6,1).\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it clear, I can write the actions.\n\nIn the output format, it should be in a box.\n\nBut first, confirm if moving U is better? I think not, because I miss the food.\n\nMoreover, with U, I might go to other areas, but no food there.\n\nFor example, (4,6) or something, but no food.\n\nSo I think R and D are better.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not applicable.\n\nAlso, when I eat (5,1) on turn 13, the tail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (5,3) on turn 9 (life span 2, so it must be eaten by turn 9).\n- Eat the positive food at (6,3) on turn 10 (life span 9, but accessible after eating (5,3)).\n- Position the snake to eat (5,1) by turn 13 (life span 6, so it must be eaten by turn 13), but this is beyond the 5-turn plan.\n- Avoid risks: The snake is short (length 2), so body collision is low-risk, but movements must avoid walls, obstacles, and instant reversals. The internal obstacle at (5,2) blocks direct access to (5,1), requiring a path via (6,1).\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Turn 8 (current turn)**: Move right (R) to (5,4). This sets up to eat (5,3) on turn 9 and avoids missing the short-life food. Moving up (U) or down (D) risks missing (5,3), which disappears after turn 9. R is allowed (no instant reverse from current R direction).\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (5,3) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 3). This is the only way to eat (5,3) by turn 9 from the turn 8 position.\n- **Turn 10**: Move right (R) to (6,3) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 4). From (5,3), R is the only safe move toward (6,3), as left (L) is blocked by body, up (U) is blocked by body, and down (D) is blocked by obstacle.\n- **Turn 11**: Move down (D) to (6,2). This starts the path to (5,1) via (6,1). (6,2) is safe (no walls, obstacles, or body).\n- **Turn 12**: Move down (D) to (6,1). This positions the snake to eat (5,1) on turn 13 (left move). (6,1) is safe and adjacent to (5,1).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Collisions**: No wall, obstacle, or body collisions in the sequence. After eating, the body grows, but the snake remains short enough to avoid self-collision risks in the planned turns.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable—no food under the snake's body, and the tail is never adjacent to the head when food is eaten.\n- **Food Access**: (1,1) and (5,6) are impossible to reach before disappearing (turn 9), so they are ignored. (5,1) is reachable by turn 13 but beyond the 5-turn output.\n- **Survival Focus**: The sequence secures 2 food items quickly and positions for a third, with open space to maneuver afterward (e.g., after turn 12, moving left to (5,1) is safe).\n\n### 5-Turn Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns 8 to 12 are below, ensuring no instant reversals and maximizing score within the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: R (right)  \nTurn 9: D (down)  \nTurn 10: R (right)  \nTurn 11: D (down)  \nTurn 12: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I think, since x=0 and x=7 are borders, meaning cells from x=0 to x=7 inclusive? No, typically in grids, if x=0 and x=7 are walls, the playable area might be from x=1 to x=6? Let me clarify.\n\nThe border cells are given as x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so that means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the snake cannot go there. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), and one body segment at (4,4). So the snake is two segments long right now. Head direction is R, which means it's moving right. So from (4,4) to (5,4), so moving right to (5,4).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (5,6) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (5,1) with value 5, life span 1? Wait, the format is (x, y, value, life_span), I think. Let's see the input:\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n\n- (1, 1, 1, 1)\n\n- (5, 3, 1, 1)\n\n- (5, 6, 1, 1)\n\n- (5, 1, 5, 1)\n\n- (6, 3, 8, 1)\"\n\nIn the list, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), I believe. But for (1,1,1,1), that might be confusing. Probably it's (x,y, value, life_span). Similarly for others.\n\nSo:\n\n- Food at (1,1): value 1, life span 1\n\n- Food at (5,3): value 1, life span 1\n\n- Food at (5,6): value 1, life span 1\n\n- Food at (5,1): value 5, life span 1\n\n- Food at (6,3): value 8, life span 1\n\nAll food has life span 1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 1 now, after this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So all food will disappear after turn 9 if not eaten on turn 9.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span 1, if not eaten on turn 9, it will be gone after turn 9. If eaten on turn 9, it's consumed.\n\nSimilarly, for others, but all have life span 1 except... wait, all have life span 1? Let's list:\n\n(1,1,1,1) - value 1, life span 1\n\n(5,3,1,1) - value 1, life span 1\n\n(5,6,1,1) - value 1, life span 1\n\n(5,1,5,1) - value 5, life span 1\n\n(6,3,8,1) - value 8, life span 1\n\n(6,3,8,1) - that's (x,y,value,life_span) = (6,3,8,1)\n\nAll have life span 1, so they must be eaten this turn or they vanish.\n\nBut there's also (5,1,5,1) which is value 5, and (6,3,8,1) value 8.\n\nSnake head at (5,4), moving right, so current direction is R.\n\nFrom the positions: snake positions [(5,4), (4,4)], head at (5,4), tail at (4,4). Since head direction is R, it just moved to (5,4) from (4,4), so it can't reverse to left immediately, because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nPossible moves: since head is at (5,4), direction R, so it can move U, D, R, but not L because L is opposite of R, so illegal.\n\nDirections: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y)\n\nCurrent head position: (5,4)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,5)\n\n- D: to (5,3)\n\n- R: to (6,4)\n\n- L: to (4,4), but (4,4) is the tail, but more importantly, L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is R, cannot move L.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, grid boundaries: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x from 1 to 6? Similarly y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nBorder cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6? But internal obstacle at (5,2), which is within that.\n\n(5,2) is an obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (1,1): value 1\n\n- (5,3): value 1\n\n- (5,6): value 1\n\n- (5,1): value 5\n\n- (6,3): value 8\n\nAll life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or gone.\n\nSnake at (5,4), with tail at (4,4).\n\nIf snake eats food, length increases by 1 for positive food.\n\nAll food here has positive value except... all values are positive: 1,1,1,5,8, all positive, so no negative food mentioned.\n\nIn the list, all values are 1 or more, so all positive.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nBut since all food will disappear after this turn, I need to eat one of them now if possible, or I might not get any food this turn.\n\nBut eating might not be safe; I need to consider collisions and future moves.\n\nFirst, let's see which food I can reach this turn.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): not a food position? Food at (5,6), (5,3), etc., not (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is empty, I assume.\n\n- D to (5,3): there is food at (5,3) with value 1.\n\n- R to (6,4): not a food position? Food at (6,3), but (6,4) is different.\n\n- L not possible.\n\nSo only by moving D to (5,3), I can eat food there.\n\n(5,3) has food, value 1.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), I eat the food, and since it's positive, length increases to 3.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will be: head moves to (5,3), and the tail: since it eats food, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (5,3), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, and tail (4,4) remains? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nBut when it eats, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added.\n\nSpecifically: before move: positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new pos, body moves to previous head, so if move to (6,4), new positions [(6,4), (5,4)], and (4,4) is no longer part of snake.\n\nBut if it eats, then after move, head at new pos, body at previous head, and tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,3) and eat, since (5,3) has food.\n\n(5,3) is adjacent and has food.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), the snake grows: head at (5,3), body at (5,4), and tail at (4,4), so positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)].\n\nLength 3.\n\nIf I move to other places without eating, snake moves, no growth.\n\nNow, other options: move U to (5,5): no food there.\n\nMove R to (6,4): no food there.\n\nMove D to (5,3): eat food value 1.\n\nBut there is also food at (6,3) with value 8, which is high, but I can't reach it this turn because from (5,4), moving R to (6,4) is possible, but (6,3) is below, not adjacent directly from (5,4) in one move. From (5,4), to (6,3) is diagonal, not allowed; only U, D, L, R.\n\nSo to reach (6,3), I need to move to (6,4) or (5,3) or (6,5), etc., but not directly.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is below, but not reachable in one move.\n\nSo this turn, the only food I can eat is at (5,3) by moving down.\n\nBut is it safe? Let's see.\n\nMove D to (5,3): now, (5,3) is not a wall, not an obstacle. Obstacle is at (5,2), not (5,3).\n\nWalls are borders and (5,2).\n\n(5,3) is clear.\n\nBut after moving, snake positions: head at (5,3), body at (5,4), tail at (4,4).\n\nNow, is there collision? Head at (5,3), body at (5,4), which is adjacent but not same cell, so no collision. Tail at (4,4), not adjacent to head.\n\nNow, but the food at (5,3) has life span 1, so if I eat it, fine.\n\nBut value is only 1, while there is (6,3) with value 8, which I might get later.\n\nBut (6,3) also has life span 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly all food disappears after this turn.\n\nSo if I don't eat (5,3) now, I lose it, and (6,3) I can't reach this turn, so I get no food this turn.\n\nBut I can survive and look for future food, but since no food is mentioned after this, I need to assume that new food might spawn, but the state doesn't specify future food, only current.\n\nThe state is for turn 9, with current food, and after this turn, all food disappears, so if I don't eat now, I have no food to eat immediately, but new food might appear in future turns, but the problem doesn't say anything about food spawning; I think we have to work with the current information.\n\nThe instruction is to maximize score, but with long-term survival.\n\nBut if I don't eat now, I might not die, but I miss the opportunity to eat high-value food later, but in this case, all food is disappearing, so if I don't eat, I get no points, and snake remains length 2.\n\nThen in future turns, new food might spawn, but it's not specified.\n\nI need to think based on the current state.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the grid and possible moves.\n\nList all cells.\n\nGrid size: since walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nFood at: (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,1), (6,3)\n\n(5,1) is at y=1, which is not border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is playable, similarly x=1 playable.\n\n(5,1) is within 1 to 6.\n\n(5,1) has food, but it's at (5,1), and obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (5,1), I need to go down, but from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), but (5,1) is further down.\n\nCannot reach in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) at y=6, which is playable, y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to x=6.\n\n(5,6) is food, but from (5,4), moving U to (5,5) not food, then I can go to (5,6) later, but not this turn.\n\n(6,3) is food, value 8, from (5,4), moving R to (6,4), then next turn I can go down to (6,3), but by then, the food might be gone, since life span 1, disappears after this turn.\n\nAll food has life span 1, so after turn 9, they all disappear.\n\nSo for turn 9, I can only eat food that is adjacent to head.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (5,4):\n\n- North: (5,5) - empty, no food\n\n- South: (5,3) - food, value 1\n\n- East: (6,4) - empty, no food\n\n- West: (4,4) - but that's the tail, and I can't move there because L is opposite direction, so illegal to move L.\n\nSo only possible moves with food: only down to (5,3) with value 1.\n\nOther moves: up to (5,5) or right to (6,4), no food.\n\nSo if I move down, I eat the food, grow to length 3.\n\nIf I move up or right, I don't eat, snake moves to new position, no growth.\n\nThen all food disappears, so no food left.\n\nThen I need to survive and wait for new food, but new food spawning is not specified, so perhaps I should assume that food will appear in the future, but I don't know when or where.\n\nTo maximize score, eating the value 1 food is better than nothing.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (5,3).\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (4,4)\n\nHead direction: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n\nNow, for next turns, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut since all food is gone, I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space.\n\nI could move to (6,4) to get closer to (6,3), but (6,3) disappears after this turn, so it won't be there.\n\nUnless I eat it this turn, which I can't.\n\nSo moving to (6,4) doesn't help for food.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,5) doesn't help.\n\nSo only by moving down I get food.\n\nBut value is 1, while (6,3) is 8, but I can't get it.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat and save space for better opportunities, but since no food, I might starve or something, but the snake can survive without food, just not grow.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating is good.\n\nMoreover, with longer snake, it might be harder to maneuver, but length 3 is still small.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger.\n\nBut in this case, if I eat at (5,3), the tail is at (4,4), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), head at (5,3), tail at (4,4), which is not adjacent, so fine.\n\nThen for turn 10, I need to move from (5,3).\n\nDirection is D (down).\n\nPossible moves: from (5,3), direction D.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up), because U is opposite of D.\n\nCurrent direction after move is D.\n\nSo cannot move U.\n\nCan move D to (5,2), but (5,2) is an obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nCan move L to (4,3)\n\nCan move R to (6,3)\n\n(6,3) has food, but it will be gone after this turn, so turn 10, no food there.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nSo from (5,3), moves:\n\n- D: to (5,2) - obstacle, invalid\n\n- U: to (5,4) - but U is opposite to current direction D, so illegal to move U.\n\n- L: to (4,3)\n\n- R: to (6,3)\n\nBoth (4,3) and (6,3) are empty, since food gone.\n\n(6,3) food gone.\n\nSo I can move L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (4,3), then positions: head to (4,3), body to (5,3), tail (5,4)? Let's trace.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 9: if I ate at (5,3), positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move, if no eat, head moves to new position, body follows.\n\nSo if move to (4,3), new head at (4,3), then body at (5,3), and tail: since no eat, the last segment (4,4) is removed, so new positions [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nSimilarly, if move to (6,3), new positions [(6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail (4,4) gone.\n\nNow, the grid has walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, for long-term, I need to find food, but no food now.\n\nPerhaps new food will spawn, but I don't know.\n\nMaybe I should not eat the low-value food and position for future.\n\nBut if I don't eat, I stay length 2, which might be more maneuverable.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (6,4) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,4)\n\nNo eat, so snake moves to [(6,4), (5,4)], tail (4,4) gone.\n\nDirection was R, moved R, so new direction R.\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,4), direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R? Cannot move L (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (6,5)\n\n- D to (6,3) - but no food\n\n- R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, invalid\n\n- L not possible\n\nSo can move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3)\n\nSimilarly, if I move U on turn 9 to (5,5), no eat, positions [(5,5), (5,4)], direction U.\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,5), direction U, can move U, L, R? Cannot move D (opposite).\n\nU to (5,6) - but (5,6) had food, gone now, so empty.\n\nL to (4,5)\n\nR to (6,5)\n\nD not possible.\n\nNow, back to turn 9 decision.\n\nIf I eat at (5,3), I get +1, length 3.\n\nIf not, I get 0, length 2.\n\nBut with length 3, I might be more constrained.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,3), on turn 10, I have to move from (5,3) to (4,3) or (6,3).\n\nSay I move to (4,3), positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? After move to (4,3), head (4,3), body (5,3), and since no eat, the tail (4,4) is removed, so only two segments: head (4,3), body (5,3).\n\nLet's clarify snake movement.\n\nInitial turn 9: positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move down to (5,3) and eat: new positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]  // head, previous head, tail stays\n\nThen turn 10, move to new position, no food (assume), so head moves to new cell, say (4,3), then new positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), and the tail (4,4) is removed because no growth, so positions [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nSimilarly, if move to (6,3), positions [(6,3), (5,3)]\n\nNow, the body at (5,3) is there.\n\nBut (5,3) was the head, now body.\n\nFor survival, with length 2 or 3, not much difference in small grid.\n\nGrid is 6x6 playable area, minus obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, minus (5,2) obstacle, so 36 -1 = 35 cells.\n\nWith snake length 2, 33 empty cells; length 3, 32 empty.\n\nBut with no food, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBut let's think about the high-value food at (6,3). Value 8, but I can't eat it this turn.\n\nUnless... is there a way?\n\nFrom (5,4), I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\n(6,3) is not adjacent; it's diagonal or not reachable.\n\nDistance: from (5,4) to (6,3) is |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent in grid, only horizontal/vertical adjacent.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,3) and then move towards other areas.\n\nBut other food is gone.\n\nAnother food: (5,1) value 5, but at (5,1), and obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (5,1), I need to go to (5,3) or (4,1) etc., but from (5,3), I can go down to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (5,1) from above because blocked.\n\nFrom left or right, but (5,1) is at bottom.\n\nCells around (5,1): (4,1), (6,1), (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so only (4,1) and (6,1) are accessible, but (5,1) itself is accessible only from (4,1) or (6,1), since (5,2) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) has food, but life span 1, so after turn 9, gone.\n\nSimilarly, all gone.\n\nSo for turn 9, only option to eat is at (5,3) with value 1.\n\nIf I don't eat, I get no points, but I might be in a better position for future food.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (6,4), then on turn 10, I can move down to (6,3), but no food, or up to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut since no food, it's similar.\n\nPerhaps new food will spawn near me.\n\nBut I have no information.\n\nTo maximize score, eating 1 is better than 0.\n\nMoreover, with longer snake, when new food spawns, I can eat and grow more.\n\nBut there is a risk with the tail reward danger, but not now.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but for now, no such issue.\n\nSo I think eating at (5,3) is the best choice for turn 9.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to specify actions for at least 5 turns? The think 5+ turns ahead, but the output is for the immediate turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nAnd I need to think ahead to choose the first action.\n\nSo for turn 9, I need to decide the action.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan based on that.\n\nBut since the state may change with new food, but in this case, after turn 9, all food gone, so for future turns, I need to survive and explore, but without food information, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that new food will spawn, but I don't know, so I need to focus on survival and positioning.\n\nFor turn 9, let's choose to move down to eat the food.\n\nSo action for turn 9: D\n\nThen for turn 10, from (5,3), direction D.\n\nAs before, can move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3), cannot U or D.\n\nD to (5,2) invalid, U illegal.\n\nSo two choices.\n\n(4,3) or (6,3).\n\nNow, the grid has obstacle at (5,2), so moving to (4,3) might be safer or not.\n\n(4,3) is at x=4,y=3.\n\nFrom there, I can move to other directions.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) at x=6,y=3.\n\nx=6 is not wall, but x=7 is wall, so (6,3) is playable.\n\nNow, to think ahead, I need to consider the board state.\n\nBut with no food, it's about avoiding dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,2) is blocked, so bottom left might be tricky.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nRows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nObstacle at (5,2)\n\nFood was at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,1), (6,3), all gone after turn 9.\n\nSnake after eating at (5,3) on turn 9: positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] for the end of turn 9.\n\nThen turn 10, move from (5,3) to new position, no food, so head moves, tail moves or not.\n\nIf move to (4,3), new positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), and tail (4,4) is removed, so [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nDirection: moved left, so new direction L.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (6,3), new positions [(6,3), (5,3)], direction R.\n\nSuppose I move to (4,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen positions [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,3), direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L? Cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,4)\n\n- D to (4,2)\n\n- L to (3,3)\n\n- R not possible\n\nNow, (4,4) was previous position, but not occupied now, since tail moved.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), so (4,4) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is empty, (3,3) empty.\n\nAll should be safe, no walls.\n\ny=2 is playable.\n\nMove to (4,4): then positions head (4,4), body (4,3), etc.\n\nBut no food, so just moving.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nTo maximize future opportunities, I should move towards open areas.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), moving U to (4,4) or D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n\n(4,2) is close to bottom, y=2, and x=4.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (3,2), (4,1), (5,2) invalid, (4,3) but occupied.\n\nBut (4,1) is corner, might be dead end if not careful.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is more central.\n\nBut with no food, I can just wander.\n\nBut let's think about the initial choice.\n\nIf on turn 9, I don't eat and move to (6,4).\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,4), no eat, positions [(6,4), (5,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 10: from (6,4), direction R, can move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3), since R to (7,4) wall, L illegal.\n\nSay move D to (6,3), positions [(6,3), (6,4)], direction D.\n\nThen turn 11: from (6,3), direction D, can move L to (5,3), R to (7,3) invalid, U illegal, D to (6,2).\n\nSo move to (5,3) or (6,2).\n\n(5,3) is empty, etc.\n\nBut similar situation.\n\nBy eating the food, I have +1 score and longer snake, which might be better for eating multiple food later.\n\nWith length 2, I can move faster.\n\nBut in this case, since grid is small, length 3 is fine.\n\nAnother food: (5,6) at y=6, value 1, but I can't reach it from (5,4) in one move; move U to (5,5), not food.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the life span, but all are 1, so must eat now or lose.\n\nExcept, is there food with longer life span? In the list, all have life span 1.\n\n(5,1,5,1) life span 1, etc.\n\nAll 1.\n\nSo I think for turn 9, moving down to eat (5,3) is the best.\n\nThen for turn 10, I need to choose a move.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n\nBut with no food, it's about exploring the grid without trapping myself.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) after turn 9, positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nOn turn 10, I can move to (4,3) or (6,3).\n\nMoving to (6,3) might be better because it's closer to the right side, and (6,3) was high-value, but gone, but the area might be open.\n\nMoving to (4,3) towards left.\n\nThe obstacle at (5,2) blocks the bottom center.\n\nSo to avoid dead ends, moving to (6,3) might be better.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go up or down.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), I can go left or up.\n\nBut let's see the bottom row: y=1, with (5,1) food but gone, and (5,2) obstacle, so cells (4,1), (6,1), (3,1), etc., but (4,1) and (6,1) are accessible only from sides.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1), I can go from (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1) but (5,1) only from sides since (5,2) blocked.\n\n(5,1) can be reached from (4,1) or (6,1).\n\n(4,1) from (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is at y=2.\n\nIf I go to (4,3) on turn 10, then I might go down to (4,2) or up.\n\nBut (4,2) is safe, then from there to (4,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is corner, if I go there, I might get trapped if the snake is long, but now short.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,3), then to (6,2) or (6,4), etc.\n\n(6,2) is at y=2, x=6.\n\nThen (6,1) below.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, but without food, it's hard to score.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that new food will spawn, and I need to be in a position to reach it.\n\nBut I don't know, so for survival, I should stay away from walls and corners.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), moving to (6,3) is better because it's less constrained.\n\nMoving to (4,3) is also fine, but let's choose (6,3) for turn 10.\n\nThen after that, I can move around.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many; probably for as many as I can plan, but at least the immediate one.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to plan 5 turns.\n\nBut with no food, the actions might be arbitrary as long as safe.\n\nSo for turn 9: move D to eat food at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3), direction D, move R to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 11: from (6,3), direction R (since moved right), so now direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R? Cannot move L (opposite).\n\nR to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,4)\n\nD to (6,2)\n\nL illegal.\n\nSo move to (6,4) or (6,2)\n\nSay move U to (6,4) to go up.\n\nThen positions: from turn 10 end: positions [(6,3), (5,3)] after moving to (6,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 11 move U to (6,4), new positions [(6,4), (6,3)], direction U.\n\nThen turn 12: from (6,4), direction U, can move U to (6,5), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) invalid, D illegal.\n\nSo move to (6,5) or (5,4)\n\nSay move U to (6,5), positions [(6,5), (6,4)], direction U.\n\nTurn 13: from (6,5), direction U, can move U to (6,6), L to (5,5), R invalid (x=7), D illegal.\n\nSo move to (6,6) or (5,5)\n\n(6,6) is top-right corner, might be dead end.\n\nMove to (5,5), positions [(5,5), (6,5)], direction L.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nIf on turn 11 from (6,3) I move D to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to start from turn 9.\n\nFirst, for turn 9, I think moving D is best.\n\nThen for turn 10, I can move to (6,3) or (4,3), let's choose (6,3) for example.\n\nThen for turn 11, from (6,3) move U to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 12, from (6,4) move to (6,5) or (5,4), say (5,4) to go left.\n\nTurn 12 move to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (6,4)], direction L.\n\nThen turn 13, from (5,4), direction L, can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R illegal.\n\nAll possible, say move U to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nSince the food at (5,6) is also there, value 1, but I can't eat it this turn.\n\nOn turn 9, if I move U to (5,5), no eat, then on turn 10, I can move U to (5,6) to eat it, but life span 1, so on turn 10, it's gone, so no.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 9, life span 1, after turn 9, if not eaten, gone.\n\nSo on turn 10, no food.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, for turn 9, only (5,3) can be eaten.\n\nSo I think action for turn 9 is D.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to specify actions.\n\nBut to think ahead, let's plan a path for survival.\n\nFrom (5,3) after eating, turn 10 move R to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 11, from (6,3) move U to (6,4)  (since moving down might go to corner)\n\nTurn 12, from (6,4) move to (5,4) or (6,5), say (5,4) to center.\n\nTurn 12 move to (5,4), positions: from turn 11 end [(6,4), (6,3)], move to (5,4), so new positions [(5,4), (6,4)], direction L.\n\nThen turn 13, from (5,4) move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: R (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 11: U (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 12: L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 13: U (to (5,5))\n\nAll safe moves.\n\nIf on turn 10 I move L to (4,3), similar.\n\nBut moving R might be better to avoid the obstacle area.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) value 5, but gone, and it's blocked by obstacle, so no issue.\n\nSo for turn 9, moving D to eat is the way to go.\n\nBut is there any risk in moving down?\n\n(5,3) is not under body; the snake body is at (5,4) and (4,4), so (5,3) is free.\n\nAfter moving, head at (5,3), body at (5,4), which is above, so no collision.\n\nAlso, tail at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, I think action for turn 9 is D.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 9 Decision and 5-Turn Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 9):**\n- Snake head at (5,4), moving right (direction R).\n- Snake length: 2 (positions: head (5,4), tail (4,4)).\n- Food with life span 1: All food disappears after this turn if not eaten. Only (5,3) is reachable this turn (value 1).\n- Walls: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- No negative food; all food is positive.\n\n**Immediate Turn 9 Decision:**\n- Possible moves from (5,4): U (to (5,5)), D (to (5,3)), R (to (6,4)). L is illegal (opposite of current direction R).\n- Only D (down) to (5,3) allows eating food (value 1), increasing length to 3.\n- Not eating risks losing all food (life span 1), scoring 0 this turn. With a short snake (length 2), future opportunities may exist, but eating now provides immediate score and longer body for future food (though length increases collision risk, it's manageable here).\n- Moving D is safe: No wall, obstacle, or body collision. Tail is at (4,4), not adjacent to (5,3), so no tail reward danger.\n\n**Long-Term Survival (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- After Turn 9, all food disappears. New food may spawn randomly, but positions are unknown. Prioritize:\n  - **Avoid dead ends:** The obstacle at (5,2) blocks bottom-center. Move toward open areas (e.g., right/upper half) to maintain mobility.\n  - **Minimize risk:** With length 3 after eating, avoid corners and walls. Prefer moves that keep multiple escape routes.\n  - **Direction handling:** After each move, update direction to prevent illegal reverses.\n- **Plan for Turns 10–13:** Start from post-Turn 9 state (snake at [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)], direction D). Moves focus on exploration:\n  - Turn 10: Move right (R) to (6,3)—central position, away from (5,2) obstacle.\n  - Turn 11: Move up (U) to (6,4)—avoids bottom row and corners.\n  - Turn 12: Move left (L) to (5,4)—toward grid center for flexibility.\n  - Turn 13: Move up (U) to (5,5)—continues upward, away from risks.\n- This path ensures no collisions, leverages current direction, and positions the snake in less constrained areas for future food. If new food spawns, reassess after Turn 13.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D (down)  \nTurn 10: R (right)  \nTurn 11: U (up)  \nTurn 12: L (left)  \nTurn 13: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,3), then body at (5,4), and tail at (4,4). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U is up (increasing y), D is down (decreasing y). L is left (decreasing x), R is right (increasing x).\n\nHead direction is D, so currently moving down, towards decreasing y.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,6) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (5,1) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (6,3) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (6,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 means +1 for positive food, but since all are 1, I think they are all positive. The value is given, and for positive it's +1, negative it's -1. Here all values are 1, so all positive.\n\nLife span: each food has a life span indicating how many turns left before it disappears. For (5,6), life span 1, so after this turn, it might disappear? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So for food at (5,6) with life span 1, after turn 10, its life span becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 11? I need to clarify.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at the start of turn 10, life span is given. After turn 10 is executed, life span decreases by 1. So for (5,6), life span 1 at turn 10, after turn 10, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it won't be there on turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) life span 4, after turn 10 it becomes 3, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=10, so I need to output actions for turn 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and so on? The answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns, but I might need to output a sequence.\n\nThe answer format is a box with multiple turns, but it might be open-ended. I think for this response, I should provide actions for a few turns, say 5 or more, based on the plan.\n\nBut since the state might change, I need to think ahead but output for the given state.\n\nI should simulate possible moves.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: head at (5,3), body at (5,4), tail at (4,4). So positions: (5,3) head, (5,4) body, (4,4) tail.\n\nHead direction is D, down, so moving to decreasing y.\n\nPossible moves from current position: since head is at (5,3), moving down would be to (5,2), but (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is D, down. Opposite is U, up.\n\nBut also, cannot move into walls or body, except tail if it moves.\n\nAvailable moves from (5,3):\n\n- U: up to (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by body, so collision if I move there. Body collision is deadly, so cannot move to body segments.\n\n- D: down to (5,2) — but (5,2) is wall (internal obstacle), so cannot.\n\n- L: left to (4,3) — is this free? Current positions: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). (4,3) is not occupied, and not wall? Walls are borders and (5,2). (4,3) should be free.\n\nx=4, y=3. Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,3) is within bounds, no wall there except borders, which (4,3) is not on border. Internal obstacle only at (5,2), so (4,3) should be free.\n\n- R: right to (6,3) — (6,3) has food? But let's see if it's free. (6,3) is a cell, not occupied by snake or wall? Snake is at (5,3),(5,4),(4,4), so (6,3) is free. Also, not wall.\n\nBut (6,3) has food with value 1, life span 7.\n\nNow, moving to (6,3) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut I need to consider the movement constraints.\n\nFirst, from current, possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,4) — occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n\n- D: (5,2) — wall, invalid.\n\n- L: (4,3) — free, no food? (4,3) has no food listed, so empty cell.\n\n- R: (6,3) — free, has food.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite: current direction D, opposite is U, which is invalid anyway. So only possible moves are L or R.\n\nL to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nNow, if I move R to (6,3), I eat the food there. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (6,3), then body segments follow. Original positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (4,4).\n\nAfter moving right to (6,3), head is at (6,3). Then the body: since we ate food, we add a new segment where the tail was? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by keeping the tail in place or adding a segment.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo after eating, the snake grows immediately. So positions: new head at (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes body, (5,4) remains body, and tail (4,4) remains, but since length increases, we add a new segment.\n\nSequence: before move, snake: segment 0: head (5,3), seg1: body (5,4), seg2: tail (4,4).\n\nAfter move to (6,3) and eat food, head is now at (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes the first body segment, then (5,4) is next body, then (4,4) is tail, and since we ate, we add a new tail segment? No.\n\nTypically, when snake moves and doesn't eat, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\nWhen it eats, head moves to new position, segments follow, but tail is not removed, so a new segment is added at the position where tail was, but since tail moves, it's added before tail moves? I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the rule: when eating, length increases, so after move, the snake has one more segment.\n\nSo before move: positions P0 (head), P1, P2 (tail).\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new, P0 to P1, P1 to P2, and P2 is removed? But in positions, it's updated.\n\nWith eating: head to new, P0 to P1, P1 to P2, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? But the tail moves.\n\nStandard: when snake moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n\n- If food, head moves to new cell, eats, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows; the new tail position is the old tail position, and a new segment is added there.\n\nIn terms of positions list:\n\nSuppose current positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to a new cell New:\n\n- If no food: new positions [New, H, B1, B2, ...] so the last segment (T) is removed.\n\n- If food: new positions [New, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is kept, and length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] so H=(5,3), B1=(5,4), T=(4,4)\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) with food: new positions [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] so head (6,3), then body (5,3), (5,4), tail (4,4). Length 4 now.\n\nIf no food, say move to empty cell, new positions [(new), (5,3), (5,4)] and (4,4) is removed.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), I eat the food at (6,3), value +1, snake grows to length 4.\n\nThen head is at (6,3), direction R (since I moved right).\n\nNow, life span of that food was 7, but since I eat it, it's gone.\n\nOther foods: (5,6) life span 1, so after this turn, it might disappear? At turn 10, life span 1, after turn 10 executed, life span decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) life span 4, becomes 3 after turn 10, etc.\n\nBut let's plan turn by turn.\n\nFirst, for turn 10, I need to choose action.\n\nOptions: L or R.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), I get immediate reward +1.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nIf I move L to (4,3), no food, so snake moves but no growth.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,3), then body to (5,3), tail to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nMove to (4,3): no food, so new positions: head (4,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, and (5,4) becomes tail? Before: [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,3): head to (4,3), then the first body is (5,3), then the next segment was (5,4), but (4,4) was tail. Since no eat, tail is removed, so new positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] so tail at (5,4).\n\nLength still 3.\n\nHead direction: I moved left, so direction L.\n\nNow, after this, head at (4,3).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,6), life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is below, but blocked by wall.\n\nLet me list all food:\n\n- (5,6): value 1, life span 1 — will disappear after turn 10 if not eaten now.\n\n- (5,1): value 1, life span 4 — at (5,1), but to reach it, need to go down, but (5,2) is wall, so cannot reach (5,1) directly? (5,1) is at y=1, x=5.\n\nFrom current head (5,3), to go to (5,1), I need to go down, but (5,2) is wall, so I cannot go directly down. I have to go around, but the grid has borders, so (5,1) might be inaccessible? Let's see the walls.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,2).\n\nSo (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is not a wall cell, but to reach it, from (5,3), I cannot go down because (5,2) is blocked. I need to go left or right first.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is at (5,6), y=6, x=5.\n\nFrom (5,3), to go up to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by body, so I cannot move up now.\n\n(5,6) is two cells up from head, but head at y=3, (5,6) y=6, so up 3 cells.\n\nBut life span 1, so only this turn to eat it, but I cannot move up directly because (5,4) is body.\n\nUnless I move away and come back, but life span 1, after this turn it disappears.\n\nSo for (5,6), since life span 1, and I cannot reach it this turn because from (5,3), moving up to (5,4) is blocked by body, and no other way since it's the same column, I cannot reach it in one move. So (5,6) cannot be eaten on turn 10, and after turn 10 it disappears. So I lose that food.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,1), it has life span 4, so I have until turn 13 to eat it? Turn 10: life span 4, after turn 10: 3, turn 11: 2, turn 12: 1, turn 13: 0 disappears. So must eat by turn 12? Life span decreases after each turn, so at turn t, life span N, it can be eaten on that turn, and after that, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n\nIf eaten on turn t with life span N, it's consumed.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn t, life span N-1.\n\nFor (5,6) life span 1 at turn 10: if not eaten on turn 10, after turn 10, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSince I cannot eat it on turn 10, it will disappear.\n\nFor (5,1) life span 4 at turn 10: can be eaten on turn 10,11,12,13? On turn 10, if eaten, ok. If not, after turn 10, life span 3, can be eaten on turn 11, and so on, until after turn 13, life span 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut (5,1) is at (5,1), which is blocked by wall at (5,2), so I need to go around.\n\nThe grid: rows y=0 to 7, x=0 to 7.\n\nAt x=5, y=2 is wall, so the cell (5,1) is isolated below the wall.\n\nHow to access (5,1)? From left or right.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) or (6,1), but (4,1) and (6,1) need to be reached.\n\n(6,1) has food with life span 10.\n\nAlso, (5,1) has food.\n\nNow, back to turn 10 choices.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,3) - eat food, grow to length 4, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (4,3) - no food, head at (4,3), direction L.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, after turn 10, the foods:\n\n- (5,6) disappears\n\n- (5,1) life span decreases to 3\n\n- (6,3) if not eaten, but if I move R, I eat it.\n\n- (6,1) life span 10 decreases to 9\n\nAlso, new food might spawn, but the problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning. Only the given foods are present, I think. The state has only these foods, and no mention of new food, so I assume only these foods exist, no new ones.\n\nSo only these four foods, but (5,6) will be gone.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,3) on turn 10.\n\nAfter that, snake: head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,4), tail (4,4). Length 4.\n\nHead direction R (right).\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- U: to (6,4) - is it free? Current positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). (6,4) not occupied, not wall? Walls: borders, x=6 is not border, x=7 is border, y=4 not border. Internal obstacle (5,2), not (6,4). So (6,4) free, no food.\n\n- D: to (6,2) - y=2, x=6. Not wall, not occupied? (6,2) not in positions, not wall, so free, no food.\n\n- L: to (5,3) - but (5,3) is occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n\n- R: to (7,3) - x=7, but x=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite: current direction R, opposite is L, which is invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\nNow, if I go U to (6,4), no food.\n\nThen head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPositions: after move, no eat, so new head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4)? Previous positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (6,4) no food: new positions [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail (5,4), (4,4) removed.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (6,2), no food, positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail (5,4).\n\nNow, from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, invalid, L to (5,4) body, invalid, R to (7,4) wall invalid. So only U to (6,5) or if possible, but from (6,4), moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,4) occupied, R to (7,4) wall. So only U possible.\n\n(6,5) is free? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,2), only D or U, but D to (6,1) has food, U to (6,3) occupied.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nBack to after turn 10 option 1.\n\nAfter moving R to (6,3) on turn 10, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nFor turn 11, I can move U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4), no food, head to (6,4), direction U.\n\nThen for turn 12, from (6,4), only possible move U to (6,5), no food? (6,5) free? Yes.\n\nThen head (6,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 13, U to (6,6), free? (6,6) should be free.\n\nThen turn 14, U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. Or other moves.\n\nFrom (6,5), moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) body, L to (5,5) free?, R to (7,5) wall.\n\n(5,5) might be free, no food listed.\n\nBut let's see the food: (6,1) is below, but I'm going up.\n\nIf on turn 11, from (6,3) I move D to (6,2), no food, head to (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 12, from (6,2), possible moves: D to (6,1) has food, U to (6,3) body, invalid, L to (5,2) wall, invalid, R to (7,2) wall invalid. So only D to (6,1) possible.\n\n(6,1) has food with value 1, life span 10 at turn 10, after turn 10 it will be 9, so on turn 12, if I move to (6,1), I eat it.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nPositions: before move, at turn 11 end, after moving to (6,2) on turn 11, positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4)? After turn 10: positions [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] \n\nTurn 11 move D to (6,2) no food: new positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail (5,4), (4,4) removed.\n\nThen turn 12 move D to (6,1): (6,1) has food, so eat, new positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] so tail (5,4).\n\nGrown to length 5.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen from (6,1), possible moves: D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid. U to (6,2) body, invalid. L to (5,1) has food? (5,1) has food, but is it reachable? (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, adjacent left from (6,1).\n\nL to (5,1): (5,1) is not occupied, not wall? Walls: (5,2) is wall, but (5,1) is not wall, it's a cell.\n\nCan I move to (5,1)? Yes, if free.\n\nBut there is food at (5,1), which has life span decreasing.\n\nAfter turn 10, (5,1) life span 3, then after turn 11, 2, after turn 12, 1, etc.\n\nOn turn 12, if I move to (5,1) from (6,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut from (6,1), after eating (6,1), I can move L to (5,1).\n\nMoves from (6,1): after head at (6,1), body at (6,2), etc.\n\nU to (6,2) occupied, invalid. D to (6,0) wall invalid. L to (5,1) free and has food. R to (7,1) wall invalid. So only L to (5,1).\n\nThen move to (5,1), eat food, grow to length 6.\n\nBut is there a risk? Tail reward danger?\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (5,1), the current tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (5,1). (5,1) and (5,4) are not adjacent; they are 3 units apart in y.\n\nAdjacent means neighboring cells, up/down/left/right.\n\nSo (5,1) and (5,4) are not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4)? Previous positions before move: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] after turn 12 move to (6,1) eat.\n\nThen move to (5,1) on turn 13: eat, so new positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] so tail (5,4).\n\nNow, from (5,1), I need to move. Possible moves: U to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, invalid. D to (5,0) wall invalid. L to (4,1) free? (4,1) no food, free. R to (6,1) body, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,1) possible.\n\nThen move to (4,1), no food, etc.\n\nBut in this path, by moving R on turn 10, I can eat (6,3) immediately, then (6,1) on turn 12, then (5,1) on turn 13, getting three foods.\n\n(5,1) on turn 13: at turn 10 life span 4, after turn 10:3, turn 11:2, turn 12:1, turn 13:0? On turn 13, before move, life span is 1? Let's track life span.\n\nTurn 10: foods:\n\n(5,6): life 1, disappears after turn 10\n\n(5,1): life 4\n\n(6,3): life 7\n\n(6,1): life 10\n\nAfter turn 10:\n\n(5,6) gone\n\n(5,1): life 3\n\n(6,3): if not eaten, life 6, but in this case, I ate it on turn 10, so gone.\n\n(6,1): life 9\n\nAfter turn 11:\n\n(5,1): life 2 (after turn 11)\n\n(6,1): life 8 (if not eaten)\n\nIn my sequence: turn 10 eat (6,3), gone.\n\nTurn 11: I moved D to (6,2), no eat.\n\nTurn 12: move to (6,1), eat, so (6,1) gone.\n\nNow (5,1) life: at turn 12, before move, after turn 11, life span 2? Turn 10 after: (5,1) life 3\n\nAfter turn 11: life 2\n\nAfter turn 12: if not eaten, life 1, but on turn 12 I eat (6,1), not (5,1).\n\nAfter turn 12, (5,1) life decreases to 1.\n\nThen turn 13: I can move to (5,1) from (6,1), but after turn 12, head at (6,1), and I move to (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, (5,1) has life span 1? After turn 12, it becomes 1, so on turn 13, it can be eaten, then after turn 13 it would be 0, but eaten.\n\nSo yes, I can eat (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), I need to be at (6,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or (4,1), etc.\n\nIn this case, from (6,1) after eating (6,1), I go directly to (5,1).\n\nNow, what about the other option on turn 10: moving L to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 10, move L to (4,3), no food, snake positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,4). Length 3.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow, from (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,4) — but (4,4) was tail, but after move, tail is at (5,4), so (4,4) is free? Before move, positions [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move to (4,3) no eat: new positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] so (4,4) is removed, free.\n\n(4,4) is now free, no food.\n\nU to (4,4): (4,4) free, no food.\n\n- D: to (4,2) — y=2, x=4. Not wall, not occupied, free, no food.\n\n- L: to (3,3) — free, no food.\n\n- R: to (5,3) — but (5,3) is occupied by body, invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite: current direction L, opposite is R, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3).\n\nAll no food.\n\nSuppose on turn 11, I move U to (4,4), no food.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3).\n\nThen from (4,4), moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) body, invalid, L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but (5,4) is body? Positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (5,3), so (5,4) is free? After move to (4,4), positions [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3)], so (5,4) not occupied.\n\n(5,4) was body before, but after move, it's removed.\n\nSo (5,4) is free.\n\nMoves from (4,4):\n\n- U to (4,5) free\n\n- D to (4,3) occupied by body, invalid\n\n- L to (3,4) free\n\n- R to (5,4) free\n\nNo food at these cells.\n\nSimilarly, I can go towards other foods.\n\nFor example, to reach (5,1), I need to go down, but blocked by wall at (5,2).\n\nFrom left side, e.g. (4,1) or (3,1), etc.\n\n(6,1) is also there.\n\nBut let's see which option gives more food.\n\nIn option 1, by moving R on turn 10, I get (6,3) immediately, then I can get (6,1) and (5,1) later.\n\nIn option 2, moving L, I might not get any food soon.\n\nMoreover, (5,1) has life span 4, but I need to reach it.\n\nFrom current, after moving L, head at (4,3), I can go down to (4,2), then (4,1), then to (5,1) but (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, adjacent.\n\nSo from (4,1), I can move R to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut need to go to (4,1) first.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) can be reached from (6,2) or (5,1), etc.\n\nBut in terms of turns.\n\nAlso, after moving L on turn 10, on turn 11, I might move to (4,2), for example.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2), no food, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (5,3)? After turn 10: positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] \n\nMove to (4,2) no eat: new positions [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3)\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (4,1), no food? (4,1) free, no food listed.\n\nThen head (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 13: move R to (5,1), which has food, eat.\n\n(5,1) life span: at turn 10:4, after turn 10:3, turn 11:2, turn 12:1, turn 13:0? After turn 12, life span 1, so on turn 13, I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, I can get (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nBut I missed (6,3) and (6,1).\n\n(6,3) was available at turn 10, but if I don't eat it, life span 7, so it will be there for several turns.\n\nAfter turn 10, if not eaten, (6,3) life span 6.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) life span 9.\n\nIn this path, I can get (5,1) on turn 13, but not (6,3) or (6,1) immediately.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go to (5,1), then to (6,1) or other.\n\nBut after eating (5,1), head at (5,1), then I can only move left to (4,1) or something, since up is wall, down wall, right to (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), moves: U wall, D wall, L to (4,1), R to (6,1).\n\nR to (6,1) has food.\n\nSo I can go to (6,1) after.\n\nBut let's compare scores.\n\nIn option 1 (move R on turn 10): eat (6,3) on turn 10, then (6,1) on turn 12, then (5,1) on turn 13. Total 3 foods by turn 13.\n\nIn option 2 (move L on turn 10): I can eat (5,1) on turn 13, and possibly (6,1) later, but I miss (6,3) on turn 10.\n\n(6,3) is still available, but I need to reach it.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), after eating (5,1), I go to (6,1), eat it, then from there I might go to (6,2), etc., but (6,3) is at (6,3), which is above.\n\nBut it takes more turns, and (6,3) has life span 7, so it will be there, but I might eat it later.\n\nHowever, moving L first might be riskier or less efficient.\n\nThere is another food at (5,6), but it disappears anyway.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the tail reward danger.\n\nIn option 1, when I eat (5,1) on turn 13, the tail is at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's think about the grid layout.\n\nThe internal wall at (5,2) blocks the vertical movement at x=5, except above and below.\n\ny=3 and above, or y=1 below.\n\nBut y=1 is only accessible from left or right.\n\nNow, back to turn 10 decision.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), I get immediate +1, and position to get (6,1) and (5,1) soon.\n\nIf I move L, I get no immediate food, and I might get (5,1) later, but miss (6,3) for now, but can get it later with more moves.\n\nBut since all foods are +1, getting them earlier might be better, but I need to survive.\n\nIn option 1, after eating (5,1), I am at (5,1), and I can move to (6,1) or (4,1), etc.\n\nBut the snake is longer, which might be riskier for collisions, but in this grid, it might be ok.\n\nIn option 2, snake is shorter, but I have fewer points.\n\nMoreover, there is a special case: food under body.\n\nCurrently, no food under body, I think.\n\nFor example, (5,6) is at (5,6), not under snake.\n\nSnake is at (5,3),(5,4),(4,4), so no food under.\n\nBut after moves, might be.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, not likely.\n\nNow, let's think about the move on turn 10.\n\nPerhaps moving R is better for immediate gain and access to other foods.\n\nBut let's see the life span of (6,3): 7, so plenty of time, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) life 10, long time.\n\n(5,1) life 4, so I need to eat it within 3 turns after turn 10, i.e., by turn 13.\n\nIf I move L on turn 10, I can still reach (5,1) by turn 13, as above.\n\nBut to reach (6,3), from left side, I need to go up, e.g., from (4,3) I can go to (4,4), (4,5), etc., then to (5,5), (6,5), down to (6,4), (6,3), but (6,3) might be eaten by then or not.\n\nBut if I don't eat it, it's there.\n\nIn the sequence where I move R, I eat it early.\n\nBut since all foods are equal, eating (6,3) early is fine.\n\nBut let's consider the path to (5,1).\n\nIn option 1, moving R, I go to (6,3), then to (6,2), (6,1), then (5,1), all in a straight line, efficient.\n\nIn option 2, moving L, I go to (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), then (5,1), which also works, but I don't get (6,3) and (6,1) in that path.\n\nAfter (5,1), I can go to (6,1), but (6,1) is still there.\n\nBut (6,3) is above, I might not go there.\n\nHowever, to maximize, I should get all foods if possible.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles, so it might not be efficient to go back.\n\nFor example, after being at (5,1), to go to (6,3), I need to go to (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), but (6,2) and (6,3) might be occupied by body if I have grown.\n\nBut in any case, I can plan.\n\nBut for now, on turn 10, moving R seems better because I get one food immediately, and set up for the others with fewer moves.\n\nMoving L, I get no food on turn 10, and only one food later, missing the opportunity for (6,3) now.\n\nBut (6,3) can be eaten later.\n\nLet's estimate the number of moves.\n\nIn option 1:\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,3) eat +1\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2) no eat\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1) eat +1\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) eat +1\n\nTotal 3 foods by turn 13.\n\nAfter that, I am at (5,1), can move L to (4,1) or something.\n\nIn option 2:\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,3) no eat\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2) no eat\n\nTurn 12: move D to (4,1) no eat\n\nTurn 13: move R to (5,1) eat +1\n\nTotal only one food by turn 13.\n\nThen I can go to (6,1) on turn 14, for example: from (5,1) move R to (6,1) eat +1, so second food on turn 14.\n\nAnd (6,3) is still there, life span 7 at turn 10, after turn 10:6, turn 11:5, turn 12:4, turn 13:3, turn 14:2, etc., so I can go to (6,3) later, but it takes more turns, and the snake is longer, might be harder.\n\nFor example, from (6,1) after eating, head at (6,1), then I need to go up to (6,2), but (6,2) might be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 14 eat (6,1), positions: suppose before turn 14, after turn 13: head at (5,1), body after eating (5,1) on turn 13.\n\nLet's not complicate.\n\nClearly, by moving R on turn 10, I can get three foods by turn 13, whereas moving L, I get only one by turn 13 and another on turn 14, but miss (6,3) unless I go back, which might not be efficient.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score, getting more earlier is better, and moving R allows that.\n\nMoreover, in moving L, when I go to (4,1), etc., I am closer to the border, might have less space, but not immediately dangerous.\n\nBut with the wall, it might be fine.\n\nAnother thing: after moving R and eating (6,3), the snake is longer, but in the path to (6,1) and (5,1), I am moving down and left, so the body follows, no immediate collision risk.\n\nSimilarly, in moving L, shorter snake, but I need to move to eat.\n\nBut on turn 10, moving R seems superior.\n\nPerhaps I can consider other moves.\n\nOn turn 10, only L or R possible, as U and D invalid.\n\nSo between L and R, R is better for immediate reward and positioning.\n\nMoreover, thinking long-term survival, by moving R, I can clear the foods efficiently.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should start from turn t1=10.\n\nSo for turn 10: R\n\nThen turn 11: from above, I need to move D to (6,2) to go down to (6,1)\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 10 move R, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nFor turn 11, I can move U or D.\n\nIf I move U, I go up, away from (6,1) and (5,1).\n\nWhereas if I move D, I go towards (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is below left.\n\nSo moving D is better to reach the foods.\n\nIf I move U, I might go to (6,4), (6,5), etc., but then (6,1) and (5,1) might expire or I need to come back.\n\n(5,1) life span short, only until turn 13.\n\nAfter turn 10, (5,1) life 3, so must eat by turn 13.\n\nIf I go up on turn 11, to (6,4), then turn 12 to (6,5), turn 13 to (6,6), then I am far from (5,1), cannot reach in time, so (5,1) disappears.\n\nWhereas (6,1) has long life, but I miss (5,1).\n\nBy moving D on turn 11, I can get both.\n\nSimilarly, in the L move option, I can get (5,1) but not efficiently.\n\nSo for turn 11, after moving R on turn 10, I should move D to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (6,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 13: move L to (5,1) eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 14, from (5,1), I can only move L to (4,1), since U and D walls, R to (6,1) but (6,1) is body now? After turn 13, positions: before turn 13, after turn 12 eat (6,1), positions: let's track.\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,3) eat, positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2) no eat, positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]  // (4,4) removed\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1) eat, positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]  // grown\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) eat, positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]  // grown\n\nNow head at (5,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2) wall, invalid; D to (5,0) wall invalid; L to (4,1) free; R to (6,1) occupied by body, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) no food, so move to (4,1) no eat.\n\nPositions: new head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4)? Previous positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nMove to (4,1) no eat: new positions [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] and (5,4) removed.\n\nTail is (5,3) now.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U, D, L, R except walls and body.\n\nBut this is beyond 5 turns.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 10 to at least turn 14.\n\nTurn 10: R\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1) after turn 13 move L to (5,1)? After turn 13 head at (5,1), move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 14, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: from (4,1), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) body invalid.\n\nU to (4,2) free, L to (3,1) free.\n\nSay move U to (4,2) or something.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for 5 turns, up to turn 14.\n\nTurn 10,11,12,13,14: that's 5 actions.\n\nNow, for turn 14, from (4,1), after moving to (4,1) on turn 13? Turn 13 action is L to (5,1)? Let's list actions clearly.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1)\n\nNow, after turn 13, head at (5,1), and we move L to (4,1) for turn 14? Turn 13 action is moving to (5,1), so at the end of turn 13, head at (5,1).\n\nFor turn 14, we move from (5,1) to (4,1), so action L.\n\nBut (4,1) is empty.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSince I have to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nAlso, confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nIn turn 10: move R to (6,3) - valid, eat.\n\nTurn 11: from (6,3) move D to (6,2) - valid, no eat.\n\nTurn 12: from (6,2) move D to (6,1) - valid, eat.\n\nTurn 13: from (6,1) move L to (5,1) - valid, since (5,1) free, eat.\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1) move L to (4,1) - valid, no eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I had moved L on turn 10, it would be slower.\n\nSo I think this is better.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: R\nTurn 11: D\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: L\nTurn 14: L\n}\n\nBut turn 14 is L to (4,1), but I can choose other, but L is fine.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, but for output, this sequence gets me three foods by turn 13.\n\nAfter that, I can continue, but not necessary for answer.\n\nPerhaps I should include a bit more to show survival.\n\nBut I think this is fine.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,6) disappears anyway, no issue.\n\nAnd (6,3) eaten.\n\nAll foods except (5,6) are eaten in this sequence.\n\n(6,1) and (5,1) eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nIn moving L, I might eat (6,3) later, but it takes more turns, and I might not, but in this case, with R move, I eat it early.\n\nSo I think R is optimal for turn 10.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 10 Decision\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated possible moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate risks and opportunities**: \n  - From the head position (5,3) with direction D (down), moving U (up) to (5,4) or D (down) to (5,2) is invalid due to body collision and wall, respectively. Only L (left) to (4,3) or R (right) to (6,3) is possible.\n  - Food at (5,6) has life span 1 and cannot be eaten on turn 10 (as (5,4) is occupied by the body), so it disappears after this turn.\n  - Moving R to (6,3) eats positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 4) and positions the snake to access other foods efficiently.\n  - Moving L to (4,3) yields no immediate reward and delays access to high-value foods.\n- **Long-term food access**:\n  - (5,1) has life span 4 (must be eaten by turn 13 to avoid disappearance). It is blocked by the wall at (5,2), requiring access from the left or right.\n  - (6,1) has life span 10 (plenty of time), and (6,3) has life span 7 (eaten immediately if moving R).\n  - Moving R on turn 10 enables a path to eat (6,1) and (5,1) within 3–4 turns with minimal risk.\n- **Collision and survival risks**:\n  - The planned path avoids body collisions and walls. After growing, the snake remains maneuverable in the available space.\n  - Tail reward danger is not triggered in this sequence, as the head is never adjacent to the tail when eating food.\n- **Comparison of options**:\n  - **Option 1 (Move R on turn 10)**: Eat (6,3) immediately (+1), then proceed to eat (6,1) and (5,1) by turn 13. Total: 3 foods by turn 13.\n  - **Option 2 (Move L on turn 10)**: No food on turn 10. Reach (5,1) by turn 13 for +1, but miss (6,3) and delay (6,1). Total: Only 1 food by turn 13, with (6,1) eaten later (e.g., turn 14). This is less efficient and risks missing (5,1) if delayed.\n- **Optimal path**: Moving R on turn 10 is superior for immediate gain, positioning, and long-term score. The sequence below eats all accessible foods ( (6,3), (6,1), (5,1) ) by turn 13 and ensures survival.\n\n### Planned Actions (5+ Turns)\nThe action sequence for turns 10–14 is optimized to eat three foods while avoiding risks. Beyond turn 14, the snake can explore safely (e.g., move to (4,1) then north), but the focus is on the critical 5-turn window. Actions are chosen to:\n- Comply with movement constraints (no instant reverse, avoid walls/body).\n- Account for food life spans ( (5,1) must be eaten by turn 13).\n- Prioritize survival: no tight spaces or collision risks in this path.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- **Turn 10 (t=10)**: Move R (right) to (6,3) – Eat positive food at (6,3) (+1 score, snake length 4). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 11 (t=11)**: Move D (down) to (6,2) – No food, but positions toward (6,1). Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 12 (t=12)**: Move D (down) to (6,1) – Eat positive food at (6,1) (+1 score, snake length 5). Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 13 (t=13)**: Move L (left) to (5,1) – Eat positive food at (5,1) (+1 score, snake length 6). Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 14 (t=14)**: Move L (left) to (4,1) – No food, but safe move away from walls. Head direction becomes L. (After this, the snake can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) for exploration.)\n\n### Outcome\n- **Score**: +3 by turn 13 (all accessible foods eaten).\n- **Survival**: No collisions or risks; grid remains navigable.\n- **Food Status**:\n  - (5,6): Disappeared after turn 10 (life span 1, not eaten).\n  - (6,3): Eaten on turn 10.\n  - (5,1): Eaten on turn 13 (before life span 0).\n  - (6,1): Eaten on turn 12.\n\nThis plan maximizes score within 5 turns and sets up for continued survival. If the state changes (e.g., new food spawns), re-evaluate after turn 14.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: R \\\\\nTurn 11: D \\\\\nTurn 12: D \\\\\nTurn 13: L \\\\\nTurn 14: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 11, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (6,3), then body segments at (5,3), (5,4), and tail at (4,4). The head direction is right (R), so it's moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood available:\n\n- At (5,1) with value 1 and life span 4. That means it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 11, it will be gone by turn 15.\n\n- At (6,1) with value 1 and life span 9, so it disappears after turn 20.\n\nBoth are positive food, since value is +1.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. Also, avoid risks like collisions with walls, body, or the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all borders, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. And internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,4), tail (4,4). So the snake is shaped like: from (6,3) right to (5,3)? No, head is at (6,3), which is right of (5,3), but since head is moving right, it came from left.\n\nPositions: index 0 is head: (6,3), then segment 1: (5,3), segment 2: (5,4), segment 3: (4,4). So let's plot this:\n\n- At y=4: x=4 (tail), x=5 (body segment 2)\n\n- At y=3: x=5 (body segment 1), x=6 (head)\n\nSo the snake is: head at (6,3), then it goes left to (5,3), then down to (5,4), then left to (4,4). So it's like a little bend.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so it was moving right to reach (6,3) from (5,3)? From positions, segment 1 is (5,3), head is (6,3), so it moved right from (5,3) to (6,3). But before that, it was at (5,4) or something? Positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]. So the path: previous head was at (5,3), moved right to (6,3). And before that, it was at (5,4) or? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe positions list: head first, so at turn t, head is at (6,3), previous head position was (5,3) at turn t-1, which is now segment 1. Before that, at turn t-2, head was at (5,4)? No.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the body follows.\n\nAt turn t-1: head was at (5,3), then it moved right to (6,3) at turn t.\n\nThe segment that was at (5,3) is now the first body segment.\n\nBefore turn t-1, at turn t-2, head was at the position that is now segment 2, which is (5,4). So at turn t-2, head was at (5,4), then it moved down? From (5,4) to (5,3) is up? y increases up or down?\n\nIn the input, it says U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down? Let's confirm.\n\nInput: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y=0 is top, but here it says U: (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing upwards, but let's see.\n\nIn the wall description, y=0 and y=7, but not specified which is top. But for movement, U: (x,y+1) means if y+1, it could be up or down depending on coordinate system.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume the grid has (0,0) at bottom-left, (7,7) at top-right, so y increases upwards. That makes sense with U: (x,y+1) up, D: (x,y-1) down.\n\nIn the snake positions, head at (6,3), body at (5,3), which is left, same y, then (5,4), which is left and up? (5,4) vs (5,3), y=4 > y=3, so up.\n\nPositions: (6,3) head, (5,3) body, (5,4) body, (4,4) tail.\n\nFrom head to first body: (6,3) to (5,3), so left, x decreased.\n\nThen to (5,4), from (5,3) to (5,4) is up, y increased.\n\nThen to (4,4), from (5,4) to (4,4) is left, x decreased.\n\nSo the snake: at some point, it was moving up from (5,3) to (5,4)? Let's think of the movement history.\n\nAt turn t-3: head was at (4,4), moved? Positions: tail is (4,4), which was head at turn t-3.\n\nAt turn t-2: head was at (5,4), since that's segment 2 now.\n\nAt turn t-1: head was at (5,3), moved down from (5,4) to (5,3)? (5,4) to (5,3) is down, y decreased.\n\nThen at turn t: head at (6,3), moved right from (5,3) to (6,3).\n\nSo sequence:\n\n- Turn t-3: head at (4,4) (current tail)\n\n- Turn t-2: head moved to (5,4)? How? From (4,4) to (5,4) is right, x+1.\n\n- Turn t-1: head moved to (5,3) from (5,4), down, y-1.\n\n- Turn t: head moved to (6,3) from (5,3), right, x+1.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, as given.\n\nNow, food: (5,1) and (6,1), both with value 1, life span 4 and 9 respectively.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, (6,1) at x=6,y=1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is directly above (5,1), since y=2 is up from y=1? y=1 to y=2 is up.\n\nGrid: let's define y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so y=1 is above y=0.\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom row, y=7 top row.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo (5,1) is at column 5, row 1 (from bottom, row 0 is bottom).\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) column 6, row 1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is column 5, row 2.\n\nSnake head at (6,3), which is row 3.\n\nI need to choose actions for multiple turns, but the output should be actions starting from turn t1=11.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn 11, 12, 13, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nAlso, I have to consider the food life spans.\n\nFirst, let's see possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since last move was R (to here), I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, meaning it just moved right, so opposite is L, which is not allowed. So I can move U, D, or R.\n\nNow, let's check the grid around head.\n\nHead at (6,3):\n\n- Up: (6,4) - is this within bounds? y=4, between 0 and 7, yes. Wall? Walls are at borders, so (6,4) is not a wall. Obstacles: internal obstacle at (5,2), not (6,4). Snake body: positions are (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). (6,4) is not occupied by snake body, so free? But when I move, the body moves, so I need to see where the body will be.\n\nFor collision: when I move to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body or wall at that time, I die.\n\nAlso, after moving, the tail moves, so cells might be freed.\n\nBut for the head movement, at the time of move, the cell must be free except for the tail, which is okay if I move to tail position, because tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to the current tail position, it's okay because after move, tail moves, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (4,4), not near.\n\nSo from (6,3):\n\n- Move U (up): to (6,4)\n\n- Move D (down): to (6,2)\n\n- Move R (right): to (7,3)\n\nBut x=7 is a wall, since border cells x=7 are walls. So (7,3) is wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Move L: but L is left, to (5,3), but (5,3) is currently occupied by the first body segment. Also, L is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,4) or D to (6,2). R is invalid because wall.\n\nCannot move L because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D possible now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nFood: I have two food items below at y=1, but head is at y=3.\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are at row 1.\n\nTo reach them, I need to go down.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (5,2), which is directly above (5,1).\n\nSo let's see the path to food.\n\nFirst, food at (5,1): to eat it, head must be on (5,1). But (5,1) might be accessible, but there's a body or something.\n\nCurrently, (5,1) is empty, I think, except for food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is empty.\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly down to (5,1) from (5,2) or something.\n\nFrom current position (6,3), if I go down to (6,2), that might be a step towards (6,1).\n\n(6,2): is it free? Walls: not border, x=6 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7. Obstacles: internal obstacle is at (5,2), not (6,2). Snake: positions are (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). So (6,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is free.\n\nNow, life span of food: (5,1) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn 11. So at turn 11, life span decreases to 3, then turn 12 to 2, turn 13 to 1, turn 14 to 0, so gone at turn 15. So it can be eaten on turn 11,12,13,14 if head is on it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) life span 9, from turn 11, decreases each turn, gone after turn 20, so can be eaten turns 11 to 19.\n\nNow, I need to plan to eat food while avoiding death.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (4,4), head at (6,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,4) and (6,3) are not adjacent; (4,4) to (5,4) is adjacent, but head is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to (4,4). Distance: x diff 2, y diff 1, not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's think about going for the food.\n\nFirst, (5,1) has short life, only 4 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nBut to eat (5,1), I need to get to (5,1).\n\nFrom current (6,3), I can go down to (6,2), then to (6,1) or other.\n\nBut (6,1) is also food, but let's see.\n\nPath to (5,1): (5,1) is at x=5,y=1. Obstacle at (5,2), so I cannot go directly to (5,1) from above because (5,2) is blocked.\n\nI have to approach from the sides.\n\nPossible ways to (5,1): adjacent cells are (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so not accessible. (5,0) is y=0, which is wall, so (5,0) is wall, cannot go there.\n\nSo only accessible from (4,1) or (6,1).\n\n(4,1) and (6,1) are the only ways to reach (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is accessible from (5,1), (6,0), (7,1), (6,2), but (6,0) is wall, (7,1) is wall, so only from (5,1) or (6,2).\n\n(5,1) is food, not a path, so to reach (6,1), I can come from (6,2) or from (5,1), but (5,1) is where I might eat food.\n\nTo eat (6,1), I can go directly from above, like (6,2) to (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, to eat (5,1), I need to come from (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nNow, from current position, I am at (6,3). I can move down to (6,2), then to (6,1) to eat that food.\n\n(6,1) has longer life, but (5,1) has short life.\n\nIf I go to (6,1) first, I can eat it, but then (5,1) might expire.\n\nI need to see if I can reach (5,1) in time.\n\nFrom (6,3), move D to (6,2) on turn 11.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1) on turn 12 to eat (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) has life span 9, so no rush.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), I am at (6,1), snake grows by one, so positions: new head at (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes body? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent turn 11: before move, positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nIf I move D to (6,2), new head at (6,2), then the body: the tail (4,4) will be removed? No, when I eat food, I grow, so tail stays.\n\nI move to (6,2), but I don't eat food yet, (6,2) has no food, so no growth. Snake moves to (6,2), so new positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). Tail (4,4) is removed, so length same.\n\nThen on turn 12, from (6,2), I can move D to (6,1), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows. New head (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). And tail not removed, so length increases to 5.\n\nNow, after that, I need to reach (5,1). From (6,1), I can move L to (5,1), but (5,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nFirst, (5,1) is at (5,1), and obstacle at (5,2), so from (6,1), move L to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut (5,1) has life span, if I do this on turn 13, it should be fine.\n\nLife span of (5,1): at turn 11, life span 4, so after turn 11, it decreases to 3? Let's clarify life span decrease.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life span L, it decreases at the end of turn t or during?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn 11, life span is 4, after turn 11, it becomes 3, and so on, until 0, then disappears before turn when it becomes 0.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for (5,1), life span 4 at turn 11:\n\n- During turn 11, countdown decreases by 1? Or at end?\n\nThe phrasing: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so I think at the beginning of the turn, or during.\n\nTo be safe, assume that at the start of turn, the life span is as given, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food during the turn, it eats before decrease.\n\nStandard: during the turn, if head moves to food, it eats, and food is consumed.\n\nThen at the end of turn, life span decreases.\n\nSo for (5,1) at turn 11: life span 4, can be eaten on turn 11,12,13,14. After turn 14, life span 0, disappears, not available on turn 15.\n\nSimilarly for (6,1), life span 9, can be eaten turns 11 to 19.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nIf I move on turn 11: D to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 12: D to (6,1) to eat (6,1). Now snake at (6,1), with body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). Length 5.\n\nThen on turn 13, from (6,1), I can move L to (5,1) to eat (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is still available on turn 13? Turn 13 is before turn 14, so yes.\n\nAfter turn 11, (5,1) life span 3 left (after decrease).\n\nAfter turn 12, life span 2 left.\n\nAfter turn 13, life span 1 left, eaten on turn 13.\n\nThen I eat both foods.\n\nBut is this safe? Let's see the positions.\n\nAfter turn 13: head at (5,1), body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). After eating, new head at (5,1), previous head (6,1) becomes body, and so on, with (5,4) as tail? Positions: after move to (5,1), eat, so new positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). But (5,3) is already there, and (5,4), but (5,3) might be connected.\n\nThe body segments: from head (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,4).\n\n(5,3) to (5,4) is up, but (5,3) is at y=3, (5,4) at y=4.\n\nNow, after this, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2) is blocking the area.\n\nNow, after eating both, I might be in a tight spot.\n\nMoreover, I need to think long-term survival.\n\nBut let's see if this path is possible.\n\nOn turn 11, from (6,3), move D to (6,2). Is (6,2) safe? Yes, free.\n\nThen turn 12, move D to (6,1), eat food. Now head at (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). All good.\n\nThen turn 13, move L to (5,1), eat food. Now head at (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (5,3) is at (5,3), which is adjacent to head (5,1)? (5,1) and (5,3) are not adjacent; y diff 2, so no collision.\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go up from (5,1).\n\nNow, from (5,1), where can I go?\n\nPossible moves from (5,1):\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2)\n\n(5,0) is y=0, wall, invalid.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\n(6,1) is occupied by body, since after turn 13, body includes (6,1).\n\nAfter turn 13, positions: head at (5,1), body segments: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nSo (6,1) is the first body segment, so occupied.\n\nTherefore, from (5,1), I can only move to (4,1), if it's free.\n\n(4,1): is it within bounds? x=4,y=1, not border, not obstacle, and not occupied by snake? Current snake positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (4,1) not in list, so free.\n\nSo I can move L to (4,1) on turn 14.\n\nThen I am at (4,1), with body (5,1), (6,1), etc.\n\nNow, the area is a bit cramped, but I can move around.\n\nBut let's see the tail: tail is at (5,4), which is far.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nAnother thing: in this plan, I ate both foods, but (5,1) was eaten on turn 13, which is within its life span.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nTail reward danger: but tail is at (5,4), not near.\n\nAnother point: when I moved to (6,1) on turn 12, I ate the food, but (6,1) is not tail, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for (5,1).\n\nBut after this, I might be stuck in the bottom left with obstacles.\n\nI have another choice: instead of going down immediately, I could go up first to avoid the body or something.\n\nBut let's see the food life: (5,1) has short life, so I should prioritize it.\n\nBut in the above, I ate both, so it seems good.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAfter turn 14, I am at (4,1), head direction L (since moved left from (5,1)).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no reverse, so cannot move R (right) to (5,1), which is body.\n\nU to (4,2)? D to (4,0), but (4,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) might be free.\n\nThen I can explore.\n\nBut the grid has walls, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2) is blocking, so from (4,1), I can go to (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is free? Let's assume yes.\n\nThen I can move around.\n\nBut let's consider if I don't go down immediately.\n\nAnother option: from current (6,3), I could move U to (6,4) on turn 11.\n\nThen what?\n\n(6,4) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut (5,1) has short life, if I go up, it might take longer to reach it, and I might not get there in time.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), to reach (5,1), I need to go down and left, but with obstacle.\n\nPath: from (6,4) to (6,3) but (6,3) might be body later.\n\nBetter to go down now to get the food.\n\nIn the first plan, I ate both foods by turn 13, which is efficient.\n\nBut after that, at (5,1), I could only move to (4,1), which might be okay.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nSay turn 14: move L to (4,1)? On turn 13 I moved to (5,1), turn 14 to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), move U to (4,2), for example.\n\nThen (4,2) is free, I assume.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut the snake is longer, so I need space.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating both if it traps me, but here it seems okay.\n\nAnother risk: when I move to (6,1) on turn 12, and then to (5,1) on turn 13, is there any collision?\n\nOn turn 12, after move to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nThen move to (5,1): from (6,1) to (5,1), left.\n\n(5,1) was free before, but after move, it's head.\n\nNo collision with body, since (5,1) not occupied at that time.\n\nBody positions are (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), all different.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), not (5,1).\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen after eating (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n(5,3) is a body segment, but not adjacent to head.\n\nNow, from (5,1), as before, only (4,1) free.\n\nMove to (4,1) on turn 14.\n\nThen positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nNow tail at (5,4).\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) or D to (4,0) invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSay move U to (4,2) on turn 15.\n\nThen head at (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n(5,3) and (5,4) are still there.\n\nNow, I need to avoid the body.\n\nFor example, (4,3) might be free? Positions: (4,2) head, (4,1) body, (5,1) body, etc. (4,3) not occupied, so I can move up to (4,3) if possible.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nThe point is, I can survive.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says to list actions starting from turn 11, but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. It says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably I need to provide a sequence, but for how long?\n\nPerhaps I should provide at least 5 turns or something, but it's not specified.\n\nSince it's a game, I need to decide moves one by one, but here I have to think ahead and output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output for the next few turns.\n\nBut to be safe, let's think of a plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1) eat first food\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) eat second food\n\nThen turn 14: move L to (4,1)\n\nNow, what about turn 15? From (4,1), I moved to (4,1) on turn 14, so on turn 15, from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nI need to choose.\n\nSimilarly, after that.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions.\n\nBut the format might expect multiple actions, but it says \"action on turn t1, action on t1+1, etc.\" so I can list for as long as I want, but probably for the immediate future.\n\nSince the food life is short, up to turn 14 might be enough, but I need to survive beyond.\n\nAnother thing: in the first move, I could move U instead of D.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4) on turn 11.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5), or L to (5,4), or R but R is wall.\n\n(5,4) is currently tail, but on turn 11, if I move to (6,4), no food, so snake moves: head to (6,4), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (4,4) is removed? Positions: current before move: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nMove U to (6,4): new head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). Tail (4,4) removed, so positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\n(5,4) is still there.\n\nNow, from (6,4), I can move L to (5,4), but (5,4) is the current tail? After move, positions have (5,4) as segment.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) from (6,4), left.\n\n(5,4) is occupied by the last body segment, but since it's the tail, and I move to it, it should be okay because the tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to tail position, no collision because tail moves after.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,4), which is the position of the last segment, then after move, head is at (5,4), and the tail was at (5,4) but since I moved to it, and it's food or not? (5,4) has no food, so no growth, so the tail is removed, and new positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). Previous tail (5,4) is gone, so head at (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3).\n\nNow, but I am not going towards the food.\n\nTo reach (5,1), I need to go down.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), but (5,3) is now a body segment.\n\nAfter above, positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo (5,3) is occupied.\n\nMove down to (5,3) is invalid, collision.\n\nMove left to (4,4) or right to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, invalid.\n\nRight to (6,4) is invalid, since occupied.\n\nU to (5,5)? y=5, possible, but not down.\n\nBut I need to go down for food.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), it might be messy.\n\nBetter not.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move U to (6,5), for example.\n\nBut then I am going away from food, and (5,1) might expire.\n\nFor instance, to reach (5,1) from (6,5): need to go down to y=1, but with obstacle.\n\nPath: from (6,5) to (6,4) but occupied, or to (5,5), etc., it takes time.\n\nMinimum steps: from (6,5) to (6,1) is 4 steps down, but (6,1) is food, but to eat (5,1), I need to go to (6,1) or (4,1) first.\n\nBut with life span, if I start from (6,3) turn 11, if I go up, by turn 12 I am at (6,4) or (6,5), then down to (6,1) by turn 15 or so, but (5,1) expires after turn 14, so on turn 15 it's gone, so I cannot eat it if I delay.\n\nTurn 11: at (6,3)\n\nIf turn 11 move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 13: move D to (6,4) but (6,4) is body? Positions: after turn 12: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) assuming previous.\n\nAfter turn 11: positions [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nAfter turn 12: if move U to (6,5), head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). (5,4) removed? No, after turn 11 move to (6,4), positions [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]? Let's track.\n\nInitial turn 11 before move: snake [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nMove U to (6,4): new head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (4,4) removed, so positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\n(5,4) is last.\n\nNow turn 12: from (6,4), move U to (6,5): new head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). (5,4) removed, so positions [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nNow to go down, turn 13: move D to (6,4), but (6,4) is now body, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nMove L to (5,5) or R invalid.\n\nSay move L to (5,5) if possible.\n\n(5,5) free? Probably.\n\nThen turn 13: move to (5,5)\n\nThen from there, down, but it takes more turns to reach y=1.\n\nFor example, turn 14 move to (5,4) but (5,4) might be free? Not occupied now.\n\nAfter turn 13, positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\n(5,3) was removed.\n\nThen move to (5,4) on turn 14? (5,4) is free? Yes.\n\nBut (5,4) to (5,3) down, but (5,3) might be free.\n\nThen to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo to reach (5,1), I need to go to (4,1) or (6,1) first.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move down? (5,4) to (5,3) but (5,3) is not occupied now, after turn 14? Let's not complicate.\n\nPoint is, it takes at least 3 more turns to reach (6,1) or something, but (5,1) expires after turn 14, so on turn 14, if I can eat it.\n\nBut from above, on turn 14, I might be at (5,4) or (5,3), not at (5,1).\n\nFor example, min steps: from (5,5) turn 13, to (5,4) turn 14, then to (4,4) or (6,4), but (6,4) might be body, or to (5,3) if possible.\n\n(5,3) is free? After turn 13 positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\n(5,3) free? Yes.\n\nTurn 14 move to (5,4)? From (5,5) move D to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nThen turn 15 move to (5,3)? D to (5,3)\n\nHead (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go down to (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3) but (6,3) might be body? After turn 15 move to (5,3), positions head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(6,3) not occupied.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), I need to go to (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), move L to (4,3), then down to (4,2), (4,1), then to (5,1).\n\nBut (4,1) to (5,1) is right, but (5,1) is food.\n\nBut by turn 15, (5,1) is gone, since life span: at turn 11, life span 4, so after turn 14, gone, turn 15 not available.\n\nTurn 14 is the last chance to eat.\n\nOn turn 14, where can I be?\n\nIf I went up, on turn 11 at (6,4), turn 12 at (6,5), turn 13 at (5,5), turn 14 at (5,4) or (4,5), etc., not at (5,1) or adjacent.\n\nNearest I can be is at (5,3) on turn 14? But from (5,3) to (5,1) not possible due to obstacle, or to (4,1) not adjacent.\n\n(5,3) to (4,1) not adjacent.\n\nSo impossible to eat (5,1) if I go up on turn 11.\n\nTherefore, to eat (5,1), I must go down on turn 11 to (6,2).\n\nThen proceed to eat both as before.\n\nMoreover, in that case, I get both foods quickly.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to escape the bottom area.\n\nIn the sequence: after turn 13, at (5,1), move to (4,1) on turn 14.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) on turn 15.\n\nNow, to maximize survival, I should go to open space.\n\nFor example, the top right might be more open.\n\nBut with the obstacle, it might be tricky.\n\nSince I need to output actions, let's define the sequence for turns 11 to 15 or so.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1) eat (6,1)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) eat (5,1)\n\nTurn 14: move L to (4,1)\n\nNow turn 15: from (4,1), head direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, invalid and reverse not allowed? Direction: last move was L to (4,1), so current direction L, so reverse is R, not allowed. So cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nI think U to (4,2) is better to go up.\n\nThen turn 15: move U to (4,2)\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output up to this point or more.\n\nThe format says to box the actions.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if moving to (6,1) is safe regarding tail reward, but no, tail is far.\n\nAnother point: the food at (6,1) could be eaten later, but since I eat it early, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (6,1) if I don't have to, but it's positive food, so why not.\n\nBut in this case, by eating both, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver, but the grid is 8x8, and snake length 5 or 6 after, should be manageable.\n\nAfter turn 13, length is 6: head, and 5 body segments.\n\nPositions: after eating (5,1), head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — that's 6 cells.\n\nThen after moving to (4,1), length 6 still, no new food.\n\nThen to (4,2), etc.\n\nI think the plan is solid.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nThen for turn 15, I can say U, but since the sequence might not need to be fixed, I can stop at turn 14 or add turn 15.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list as many as I want, but probably for the immediate actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nI think outputting turns 11 to 14 is fine, as I have a plan.\n\nTo be complete, up to turn 15.\n\nBut in turn 15, it depends.\n\nPerhaps I should output the moves I decided.\n\nSince the food is eaten by turn 13, and I move to safety.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,1) on turn 12, I eat the food, but (6,1) has life span 9, so I could leave it for later, but since I am there, and it's positive, I should eat it.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,1) on turn 12, I can go directly to (5,1) from (6,2), but from (6,2) to (5,1) is not adjacent; (6,2) to (5,1) is diagonal, not possible, must move to adjacent cell.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move L to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nOr D to (6,1), or U to (6,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,1), I need to go to (6,1) first or to (5,1) from left.\n\nBut from (6,2), only down to (6,1) or other.\n\nSo I have to go to (6,1) to approach (5,1).\n\nTherefore, the sequence is necessary.\n\nSo I think D, D, L, L is good.\n\nThen for turn 15, I can move U.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll list up to turn 14.\n\nThe current turn is 11, so actions for turn 11,12,13,14.\n\nThen turn 15 can be decided later, but since not required, fine.\n\nIn the box, I need to write the actions.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (5,1) has a short life span (4 turns, disappearing after turn 14), so it must be eaten by turn 14. The food at (6,1) has a longer life span (9 turns, disappearing after turn 20) but is efficiently eaten en route to (5,1). Both are positive food (+1 score each).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Moving directly toward the food avoids walls and obstacles. The internal obstacle at (5,2) blocks direct downward movement to (5,1), requiring an approach via (6,1).\n  - After eating both foods, moving left to (4,1) avoids immediate body collisions and opens paths for future movement.\n  - Tail reward danger is not an issue, as the tail is distant during all moves.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is right (R), so left (L) is not allowed on turn 11 (no instant reverse).\n  - After turn 11, the direction is updated based on the previous move.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - **Turn 11**: Move down (D) to (6,2) to position for accessing (6,1) and (5,1). This avoids walls and body segments.\n  - **Turn 12**: Move down (D) to (6,1) to eat the food there (value +1, length increases).\n  - **Turn 13**: Move left (L) to (5,1) to eat the food (value +1, length increases) before it expires.\n  - **Turn 14**: Move left (L) to (4,1) to escape the congested bottom-left area and avoid potential body collisions. This also positions the snake for upward movement toward open space.\n  - **Beyond**: After turn 14, the snake should move upward (e.g., to (4,2)) to access the less constrained upper grid, ensuring long-term survival.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 13, maximizing immediate score while ensuring the snake survives beyond turn 14 with a clear path for future movement.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{D (down)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{D (down)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{L (left)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{L (left)}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 12, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6. Because x=0 and x=7 are walls, so we can't go there. Similarly for y.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2)\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So the snake has 4 segments.\n\nHead direction is down, which is consistent with the positions: from (6,2) to (6,3) is down, since y increases down? Typically in grids, y=0 is top, so down would be increasing y. Let's see the movement definition: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). That might be counterintuitive.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — that means up increases y? Usually, in computer graphics, y increases down, but let's clarify.\n\nThe movement definitions:\n\n- U (x,y+1) — so if y+1, that means moving up if y=0 is bottom? But typically in such games, y=0 is top. I need to be careful.\n\nLook at the state: snake positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (6,2), next is (6,3). Since head direction is D (down), and D is (x,y-1)? D is (x,y-1), but from (6,2) to (6,3) is increasing y, so if D is down, that should decrease y? Inconsistency.\n\nMovement: D (x,y-1) — so if y decreases, that means y=0 is top, so down decreases y? But in positions, from (6,2) to (6,3), y increased from 2 to 3, but head direction is D, which is down. But D is (x,y-1), which would be to a lower y value.\n\nContradiction. Let me read carefully.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3). So from head to second segment, it went from (6,2) to (6,3), which is increasing y. But head direction is given as D (down).\n\nBut movement D is (x,y-1), which would decrease y. So if head is at (6,2) and moving down, it should go to (6,1), but here it's connected to (6,3), which has higher y.\n\nI think I have a confusion in coordinate system.\n\nPerhaps y=0 is bottom, so increasing y is up? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom or top?\n\nThe wall description: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" and it says \"y=0/y=7\" which might mean y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nBut in standard grid, if y=0 is top, then y=7 would be bottom, so walls at top and bottom.\n\nBut movement: U (x,y+1) — if y+1 and y=0 top, then U would move down to y=1, which is increasing y, so down the screen.\n\nSimilarly, D (x,y-1) would move up to lower y.\n\nIn positions: snake head (6,2), and next segment (6,3). If y=0 top, then (6,2) is above (6,3), so from head to body, it went down to (6,3), so direction down makes sense with D (x,y-1)? D (x,y-1) from (6,2) would be to (6,1), but it's connected to (6,3), which is y=3>2.\n\nI'm messing up.\n\nLet's define the coordinate system.\n\nAssume y=0 is the top row, y=7 is the bottom row.\n\nThen:\n\n- U (x,y+1): from (x,y) to (x,y+1), which is down (increasing y).\n\n- D (x,y-1): from (x,y) to (x,y-1), which is up (decreasing y).\n\nIn snake positions: head at (6,2), next at (6,3). Since y=3 > y=2, it moved down to (6,3), so direction should be down, which is U? But head direction is given as D.\n\nHead direction is D, but from (6,2) to (6,3) is increasing y, which is U movement? Confusion.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is the direction it was moving to get to current position.\n\nLet's read the input: \"Snake Head Direction\": D\n\nAnd positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nSo from (6,2) to (6,3), if y increases down, that's moving down, so direction down, which should be U if U is (x,y+1)? I think I need to map the direction label to the movement.\n\nMovement definitions:\n\n- U: (x,y+1)  // up? or down?\n\nTypically, in such contexts, U is up, but (x,y+1) with y=0 top would be down.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look at the values.\n\nFrom head (6,2) to second segment (6,3), y increased, so if y=0 top, moving down.\n\nDirection D is given, and D is defined as (x,y-1), which would decrease y, so moving up.\n\nBut here it moved to higher y, so direction should be U for down.\n\nThere's a mistake in my assumption or the problem.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is the direction the snake is facing for the next move, but it says \"Snake Head Direction\", and in the context, it's the current direction of movement.\n\nLet's read the state carefully.\n\n\"Snake Head Direction\": D\n\nAnd the positions show from head to body: (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,4).\n\nIf we assume y=0 is top, then:\n\n- (6,2) to (6,3): y from 2 to 3, down\n\n- (6,3) to (5,3): x from 6 to 5, left\n\n- (5,3) to (5,4): y from 3 to 4, down\n\nBut head at (6,2), and it moved to (6,3), so the direction to get to (6,2) was from where? The positions are listed head first, so the head is at (6,2), and the previous position was (6,1) or something, but we don't have that. The direction is the current movement direction.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is the direction it is moving now, so from turn 11 to turn 12, it moved to (6,2) with direction D.\n\nBut D is (x,y-1), which would be to a lower y, but (6,2) has y=2, so if it moved with D (y-1), it came from (6,3)? But positions show head at (6,2), then (6,3), so it came from (6,3) to (6,2)? That would be moving up, since y decreased from 3 to 2, so direction U? But it's given as D.\n\nI think I have a fundamental confusion.\n\nLet me list the positions in order: the snake is at turn 12: segments are (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So head is at (6,2), tail at (5,4).\n\nThe movement history: to be at (6,2), it must have come from (6,1) or (7,2) or (5,2), but (7,2) is x=7 wall, not possible. (5,2) is internal obstacle, also not possible. (6,1) is possible.\n\nHead direction is given as D, which is down.\n\nIf head is at (6,2) and direction D, that means it is facing down, so for the next move, it can move down to (6,3)? But (6,3) is occupied by the body.\n\nLet's think of the direction as the last move direction.\n\nFrom turn 11 to turn 12, the head moved to (6,2) from some previous position.\n\nSuppose at turn 11, head was at (6,1), and it moved down to (6,2). If D is (x,y-1), that would be to (6,1) if from (6,2), but let's define the move.\n\nThe move action is applied to the current head position to get to the new position.\n\nFor example, at turn t, snake is at positions, then I choose action, which moves the head to a new position, tail moves, etc.\n\nBut for the current state, the head direction is the direction it moved to arrive at the current head position.\n\nSo for head at (6,2), if it arrived from (6,1) by moving down, which is U (y+1) if y=0 top? I need to set the coordinate system.\n\nAssume y=0 is the top wall, y=7 is the bottom wall. So y increases as we go down.\n\nThen:\n\n- U (x,y+1): move down\n\n- D (x,y-1): move up\n\n- L (x-1,y): move left\n\n- R (x+1,y): move right\n\nIn positions: head (6,2), second (6,3), so from head to second, it moved down to (6,3), so the direction to get to second segment was down (U).\n\nBut the head at (6,2) was arrived from where? If the head moved to (6,2) from previous position.\n\nSuppose at turn 11, head was at (6,1), and it moved down to (6,2) by U action.\n\nThen at turn 12, head is at (6,2), and it is facing down, so direction is U? But it's given as D.\n\nGiven direction is D.\n\nD is (x,y-1), which with y=0 top, (x,y-1) is moving up to lower y.\n\nBut from positions, the head at (6,2) is connected to (6,3) which is below, so it came from above? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is the direction it will move next, but the state is before the move.\n\nThe state is for turn t1=12, and I need to choose actions for turn 12, 13, etc.\n\nSo at turn 12, the snake is at positions [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)], and head direction is D, meaning that on the previous move, it moved with direction D to get to (6,2).\n\nDirection D is (x,y-1), so it moved to (6,2) by decreasing y, so from (6,3) to (6,2), which is moving up.\n\nBut in the positions, (6,2) is head, then (6,3) is the next segment, so if it moved from (6,3) to (6,2), that means at turn 11, head was at (6,3), and it moved up to (6,2) for turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 12, head is at (6,2), and the body segments are (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), which matches.\n\nSo the movement from turn 11 to 12 was from (6,3) to (6,2) using D (up), so head direction is D (up).\n\nThen at turn 12, I need to choose an action for the next move.\n\nAvailable actions: I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since last move was D (up), I cannot move U (down) immediately, because U and D are opposites.\n\nDirections: U and D are opposite, L and R are opposite.\n\nLast move was D (up), so I cannot move U (down) on this turn.\n\nPossible moves: L (left), R (right), or D (up) again, but D is up, which is (x,y-1), from (6,2) to (6,1).\n\nNow, walls: border walls x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so y=0 is top wall, y=7 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nHead at (6,2), so:\n\n- Move U (down, (x,y+1)): to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied by the body, collision, deadly.\n\n- Move D (up, (x,y-1)): to (6,1)\n\n- Move L (left, (x-1,y)): to (5,2), but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, collision.\n\n- Move R (right, (x+1,y)): to (7,2), but x=7 is border wall, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is D (up) to (6,1).\n\nIs that right?\n\nMove U: (x,y+1) = (6,3), which is the second segment, so body collision.\n\nMove D: (x,y-1) = (6,1), which is within bounds, y=1 is not wall, y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable.\n\nMove L: (x-1,y) = (5,2), which is internal obstacle, so wall, collision.\n\nMove R: (x+1,y) = (7,2), x=7 is border wall, collision.\n\nAnd no instant reverse: last move was D (up), so I cannot move U (down), but U is down, which is not the opposite of D? D is up, U is down, so they are opposites, so I cannot move U.\n\nBut in this case, U is impossible anyway because of body.\n\nSo only possible move is D (up) to (6,1).\n\nBut let's confirm the food.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,1,3,1) : position (5,1), value 1, life span 3\n\n- (6,1,8,1) : position (6,1), value 1, life span 8\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nCurrent turn t1=12.\n\nFor food at (5,1): life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning on turn 15 it will be gone? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 12, life span 3, after turn 12, it becomes 2, after turn 13, 1, after turn 14, 0, so gone on turn 15. Similarly for (6,1) life span 8, disappears after turn 19 or something.\n\nNow, if I move D to (6,1), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, value +1, snake length increases.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4)\n\nIf I move to (6,1), new head at (6,1), then the body: the tail moves away from (5,4) to (5,3)? Standard snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nIf I eat food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nHere, moving to (6,1), which has food, so I eat it, value +1, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head at (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, then (6,3), then (5,3), then (5,4) remains as tail? No.\n\nWhen snake moves and eats food, head moves to new position, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail position stays, but the segments shift.\n\nLet's think:\n\nCurrent positions: [H: (6,2), B1: (6,3), B2: (5,3), T: (5,4)]\n\nAfter move to (6,1) with food eaten: new head at (6,1), then the previous positions: (6,2) becomes body, (6,3) becomes body, (5,3) becomes body, and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so (5,4) stays, but a new segment is added? No.\n\nIn snake, when you eat food, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position (6,1), then the first body is the old head (6,2), then old B1 (6,3), then old B2 (5,3), and the old tail (5,4) remains, so snake has 5 segments: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there any risk? Moving to (6,1) is safe, no collision.\n\nBut the food at (6,1) has life span 8, so it will be there for a while.\n\nThere is also food at (5,1).\n\nNow, the instruction says to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrently, only one move is possible, to (6,1), eating the food.\n\nBut is that the only choice? Earlier I thought only D is possible, but let's double-check.\n\nAvailable moves from (6,2):\n\n- U: to (6,3) - body at (6,3), collision, death.\n\n- D: to (6,1) - empty except food, but food can be eaten.\n\n- L: to (5,2) - internal obstacle, wall, collision.\n\n- R: to (7,2) - x=7 border wall, collision.\n\nSo indeed, only D to (6,1) is possible.\n\nSo for turn 12, I must move D (up) to (6,1).\n\nThen I eat the food at (6,1), snake grows to 5 segments.\n\nNow, after this, head is at (6,1), direction is D (since I moved up).\n\nNow, for turn 13, I need to choose next action.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn 12, 13, 14, etc., up to say 5 turns or more.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can simulate.\n\nBut first, after turn 12 move.\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1), eat food.\n\nNew state: turn 13.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction last move D (up).\n\nSnake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nFood: (5,1,3,1) still there, life span was 3 at turn 12, after turn 12, countdown to 2? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 12, food at (5,1) has life span 3. After turn 12, it decreases by 1 to 2.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1) was eaten, so gone.\n\nOnly food left is (5,1) with life span 2 at turn 13? Let's track life span.\n\nAt turn t1=12:\n\n- Food (5,1): value 1, life span 3\n\n- Food (6,1): value 1, life span 8\n\nAfter turn 12: since we moved to (6,1), we ate that food, so it's removed.\n\nFood (5,1) life span decreases by 1 to 2.\n\nAt turn 13, only one food: (5,1) with life span 2.\n\nNow, head at (6,1), last move was D (up), so cannot move U (down) next.\n\nPossible moves from (6,1):\n\n- U (down, (x,y+1)): to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by body, collision.\n\n- D (up, (x,y-1)): to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, collision.\n\n- L (left, (x-1,y)): to (5,1), which has food.\n\n- R (right, (x+1,y)): to (7,1), x=7 wall, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nMove L to (5,1) and eat the food there.\n\nThen for turn 13, action L.\n\nNow, after move: head to (5,1), eat food, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then old head (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), then (5,3), and old tail (5,4) stays? Snake positions: before move, [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nAfter move to (5,1) with food eaten: new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and since food eaten, add new segment, so tail is (5,4) but it moves? Standard: when moving, the tail moves only if no food, but if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at head.\n\nSo positions: new head (5,1), then previous segments: (6,1) now first body, (6,2) second body, (6,3) third body, (5,3) fourth body, and tail was (5,4), but since food eaten, (5,4) remains as tail, so snake has 6 segments: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nList: head (5,1), then next: old head (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), then (5,3), then tail (5,4).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, last move was L (left), so from (6,1) to (5,1).\n\nDirection: last move L.\n\nAt turn 14, head at (5,1), last move L, so cannot move R (right) next.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U (down, (x,y+1)): to (5,2), but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, collision.\n\n- D (up, (x,y-1)): to (5,0), y=0 wall, collision.\n\n- L (left, (x-1,y)): to (4,1), which is within bounds? x from 1 to 6, so (4,1) is playable.\n\n- R (right, (x+1,y)): to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: last move L, so cannot move R, which is impossible anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (4,1) or U and D are walls, so only L to (4,1) possible? U to (5,2) is wall, D to (5,0) wall, R to (6,1) body, so only L to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is empty, no food mentioned.\n\nNow, food: at turn 13, food at (5,1) was eaten, so no food left? After turn 13, food (5,1) was eaten, so gone.\n\nNo other food mentioned, so grid might have no food now.\n\nBut food life span: at turn 13, food (5,1) had life span 2, but we ate it, so it's consumed.\n\nNo other food, so we need to survive and wait for new food or something, but the state only gives current food; new food might spawn later, but we don't know, so we have to move carefully.\n\nFor turn 14, move L to (4,1).\n\nThen head to (4,1), last move L.\n\nSnake positions: before move: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nAfter move to (4,1) no food: so head to (4,1), tail moves away from (5,4) to where? Body segments: old head (5,1) becomes body, so (4,1) head, then (5,1), then (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), and tail was (5,4), but since no food, tail moves to (5,3)? Let's see the shift.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4) tail.\n\nAfter move left to (4,1) no food: new head (4,1), then body segments take previous positions: segment 1 becomes (5,1), segment 2 becomes (6,1), segment 3 becomes (6,2), segment 4 becomes (6,3), and segment 5 (tail) moves to segment 4's position (5,3), so tail at (5,3)? But segment 4 was (5,3), which is now occupied by tail.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then body: previous segment 0: (5,1), then seg1: (6,1), then seg2: (6,2), then seg3: (6,3), then tail: previous seg4: (5,3). But seg4 was (5,3), which is now the new tail.\n\nList: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and the old tail (5,4) is removed.\n\nSo snake positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nNow, at turn 14, head at (4,1), last move L.\n\nPossible moves for turn 15:\n\n- U (down, (x,y+1)): to (4,2)\n\n- D (up, (x,y-1)): to (4,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L (left, (x-1,y)): to (3,1)\n\n- R (right, (x+1,y)): to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nNo instant reverse: last move L, cannot move R.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nNow, (4,2) and (3,1) should be empty, no food mentioned.\n\nWe need to think about survival. The snake is long, and space might be tight.\n\nCurrent positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThe grid has internal wall at (5,2), so area around is constrained.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), moving U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), that might be ok.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nSince no food, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe tail is at (5,3), which might move.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions so far.\n\nBut the question is to think 5+ turns ahead and output actions starting from turn 12.\n\nFirst, turn 12: only choice, move D (up) to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 13: from (6,1), only choice move L to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 14: from (5,1), only choice move L to (4,1)\n\nNow for turn 15: from (4,1), I can move U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), then head at (3,1), last move L.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) body? Positions: after move to (3,1), snake: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail at (5,3) but after turn 14 move, positions are [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nAfter move to (3,1) no food: head (3,1), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail moves to (5,3)? Tail was (5,3), moves to where? When no food, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nCurrent before move: seg0: (4,1) head, seg1: (5,1), seg2: (6,1), seg3: (6,2), seg4: (6,3), seg5: (5,3) tail.\n\nMove to (3,1): new head (3,1), then seg1 becomes (4,1), seg2 becomes (5,1), seg3 becomes (6,1), seg4 becomes (6,2), seg5 becomes (6,3), and tail seg5 was (5,3), but it moves to seg4's position? After move, the segments shift: new body at previous positions: seg0 new position is head, so body starts from previous seg0 position.\n\nNew positions: head at new cell (3,1), then the first body is at previous head position (4,1), then previous seg1 (5,1), then previous seg2 (6,1), then previous seg3 (6,2), then previous seg4 (6,3), and the tail was previous seg5 (5,3), but since no food, it is removed, and the new tail is previous seg4 (6,3)? Let's list:\n\n- New head: (3,1)\n\n- New body 1: previous head (4,1)\n\n- New body 2: previous body seg1 (5,1)\n\n- New body 3: previous body seg2 (6,1)\n\n- New body 4: previous body seg3 (6,2)\n\n- New body 5: previous body seg4 (6,3)\n\nAnd previous tail (5,3) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3).\n\nNow, from (3,1), last move L, so can move U, D, L, but not R.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, so only U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved U from (4,1) to (4,2) at turn 15.\n\nBut let's go back.\n\nAt turn 15 from (4,1), choices U or L.\n\nI need to consider the board.\n\nThe snake has a loop or something, but with wall at (5,2), it might be trapped.\n\nCurrent positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is tail, but it will move.\n\nThe cell (5,2) is wall, so the snake cannot go there.\n\nAvailable spaces: for example, moving U to (4,2) is open.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other areas.\n\nMoving L to (3,1) also open.\n\nBut since no food, I should move to open spaces to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, the area to the left has more space.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6.\n\nInternal wall only at (5,2), so most cells are free.\n\nFrom (4,1), moving U to (4,2) might be better because it opens up the top area, whereas moving L to (3,1) is corner.\n\n(4,2) is row 2, which has y=2, but (5,2) is wall, so (4,2) is free.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1) body, L to (3,2), R to (5,2) wall.\n\nBut at that point, (4,1) might be body.\n\nLet's simulate if I choose U at turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: move U from (4,1) to (4,2)\n\nNo food, so move.\n\nHead to (4,2), last move U (down, since U is (x,y+1), down).\n\nSnake before: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nAfter move: new head (4,2), body: previous head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail moves to (5,3)? No food, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // since tail (5,3) removed, and the segment before was (6,3), so new tail (6,3)\n\nPositions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nNow head at (4,2), last move U (down).\n\nFor turn 16, possible moves:\n\n- U (down, (x,y+1)) to (4,3)\n\n- D (up, (x,y-1)) to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision\n\n- L (left, (x-1,y)) to (3,2)\n\n- R (right, (x+1,y)) to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, collision\n\nNo instant reverse: last move U (down), cannot move D (up), but D is impossible anyway.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,3) or L to (3,2)\n\nBoth seem ok.\n\nSay I move U to (4,3)\n\nThen head to (4,3), last move U.\n\nSnake: new head (4,3), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail to (6,3)\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] and (6,3) removed? Tail moves.\n\nBefore move: seg0: (4,2) head, seg1: (4,1), seg2: (5,1), seg3: (6,1), seg4: (6,2), seg5: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,3) no food: new head (4,3), body: seg1 at (4,2), seg2 at (4,1), seg3 at (5,1), seg4 at (6,1), seg5 at (6,2), and tail removed, so new tail (6,2)\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut this is just wandering.\n\nSince the initial moves were forced, for the answer, I need to output from turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: move D\n\nTurn 13: move L\n\nTurn 14: move L\n\nThen for turn 15, I have a choice, but since the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan.\n\nBut at turn 12, I had only one choice, similarly at 13 and 14.\n\nFor turn 15, I need to choose.\n\nBut in the context, since no food, it doesn't matter much, but I should avoid risks.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so paths might open.\n\nFor example, at turn 15 from (4,1), if I move U to (4,2), as above.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), then to (3,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is tail, and it might move away.\n\nIn the current position, the snake occupies (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is tail, and if I move, it might stay or move depending on food.\n\nBut since no food, when I move, the tail moves, so (5,3) is freed if I don't eat food.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nFor long-term, moving to (4,2) might be better to go to the top area.\n\nBut let's see the food that was there; all eaten, so new food might spawn, but we don't know, so we have to assume no new food for now.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can output the forced moves and then for turn 15, choose a safe move.\n\nBut the format is to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the first three are forced, I can output up to turn 15 or more.\n\nBut at turn 15, I have a choice.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, at turn 12, after moving to (6,1), and then to (5,1), etc., but when I ate the food at (6,1), it was positive, good.\n\nBut there was a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nIn this case, when I moved to (6,1), the tail was at (5,4), not adjacent to head at (6,1). Head at (6,1), tail at (5,4), not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y differ by 1.\n\n(6,1) and (5,4) differ in both, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, when I moved to (5,1), tail at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow for turn 15, from (4,1), I can choose to move U or L.\n\nSince last move was L at turn 14, and I can move U or L.\n\nMoving U to (4,2) might be better because it's towards the center, while (3,1) is corner.\n\nBut (4,2) is row 2, y=2.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nTo maximize space, I should go to less occupied areas.\n\nThe snake is in the bottom-right, with parts.\n\nCurrent positions at turn 14 after move: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nFree cells: many, like (1,1) to (3,1), (1,2) to (6,2) but (5,2) wall, so (1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2) free, etc.\n\n(4,2) is free, so moving U to (4,2) is good.\n\nMoving L to (3,1) is also free.\n\nBut (3,1) has more space to the left, while (4,2) has above.\n\nPerhaps both are fine, but I think moving up might be better to avoid the wall.\n\nLet's decide to move U at turn 15.\n\nThen for turn 16, from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or L to (3,2), as before.\n\nSay move U to (4,3).\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but for the output, I need to list the actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for turn 12 to 16 or 17.\n\nBut at turn 12, 13, 14 are forced, turn 15 I choose U, then turn 16 from (4,2) move U or L, say U.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nFirst, turn 12: move D\n\nTurn 13: move L\n\nTurn 14: move L\n\nTurn 15: move U\n\nThen for turn 16, depending on position.\n\nAt turn 15 move U to (4,2), so at turn 16 head at (4,2), last move U, can move U to (4,3) or L to (3,2), or D to (4,1) body, R to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSay move U to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 17 from (4,3), can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2) body, L to (3,3), R to (5,3) but (5,3) might be free or not.\n\nAt that point, tail has moved, so (5,3) might be free.\n\nBut let's not simulate too far.\n\nSince no food, the actions can be arbitrary as long as safe.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 16 or 17.\n\nAnother thing: the food life span, but all food eaten, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps in the initial state, after eating both foods, the snake is longer, and I need to survive.\n\nBut for now, I think the actions are:\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U (I choose this)\n\nTurn 16: U (assume)\n\nBut to be precise, let's list.\n\nSince the first three are forced, and for turn 15, I can specify.\n\nBut in the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output 5 turns: turn 12 to 16.\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: say U or L, but I need to choose.\n\nTo think ahead, moving U at turn 15 to (4,2), then at turn 16, moving L to (3,2) might be better to go left, away from the snake body.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving L to (3,2) then to (3,3) etc.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll output:\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd for turn 16, I can add, but the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so perhaps output at least 5 actions.\n\nTurn 12 to 16 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 12,13,14,15,16.\n\nFor turn 16, from the position after turn 15 move.\n\nAfter turn 15 move U to (4,2), head at (4,2), last move U.\n\nThen for turn 16, I can move L to (3,2) to explore new area.\n\nThen turn 17 from (3,2) can move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: L (to (3,2))\n\nThen for turn 17, not necessary, but can add.\n\nSince the grid might have new food, but not specified, so we move safely.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have analyzed the current state and planned actions 5 turns ahead (turns 12 to 16) based on the core rules. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current state (turn 12)**: Snake head at (6,2) with direction D (up, meaning (x,y-1) in the coordinate system where y=0 is the top wall). Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2). Food at (5,1) with value +1 and life span 3 (disappears after turn 14, as countdown decreases each turn including turn 12), and food at (6,1) with value +1 and life span 8 (disappears after turn 19). Snake positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), tail (5,4).\n- **Movement constraints**: No instant reverse. Last move was D (up), so U (down) is not allowed on turn 12.\n- **Collision risks**: Must avoid walls, body segments, and the internal obstacle.\n- **Food strategy**: Prioritize eating positive food when safe, but avoid \"Tail Reward Danger\" (no issue here as tail is not adjacent to head when eating). After eating both foods, focus on survival in open areas to avoid dead ends.\n- **Long-term planning**: Simulated moves 5+ turns ahead. Turns 12–14 are forced due to limited safe moves. On turn 15, chose U (down) to move toward open space and avoid corners. On turn 16, chose L (left) to continue exploring safer areas away from the snake's body and walls.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 12–16):\n- **Turn 12**: Only safe move is D (up) to (6,1), eating the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 5). New head position: (6,1). Last move: D.\n- **Turn 13**: Only safe move is L (left) to (5,1), eating the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 6). New head position: (5,1). Last move: L.\n- **Turn 14**: Only safe move is L (left) to (4,1) (no food). New head position: (4,1). Last move: L.\n- **Turn 15**: Safe moves: U (down) to (4,2) or L (left) to (3,1). Chose U (down) to (4,2) to move toward the center of the grid and avoid the corner at (3,1), improving long-term mobility. No food eaten. New head position: (4,2). Last move: U.\n- **Turn 16**: Safe moves: U (down) to (4,3) or L (left) to (3,2). Chose L (left) to (3,2) to explore leftward, away from the snake body and toward open space (x=1–3, y=1–6 has fewer obstacles). No food eaten. New head position: (3,2). Last move: L.\n\n### Rationale for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Turns 12–14**: Forced moves due to collisions (only one option each turn). Eating both foods maximizes immediate score and growth safely.\n- **Turn 15**: After eating all available food, the grid has no food (both foods consumed by turn 13). Moved U to (4,2) to prevent trapping in the bottom-left corner and access more open cells (e.g., (4,3), (3,2), etc.).\n- **Turn 16**: Moved L to (3,2) to continue into less occupied areas, reducing collision risk. From (3,2), future moves (e.g., turn 17+) can go U to (3,3), L to (2,2), or D to (3,1) if clear, ensuring survival.\n- **Survival focus**: By turn 16, the snake has length 6 and occupies [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (tail at (6,2)). The internal wall at (5,2) blocks the center, but moving left early avoids this risk. Path remains open to explore top-left (e.g., y=3–6, x=1–3) or bottom-left areas.\n- **Risk avoidance**: No food-related risks; \"Tail Reward Danger\" never triggered (tail not adjacent during eats). All moves avoid walls, body, and obstacles. Future moves beyond turn 16 can adapt to new food spawns but prioritize open spaces.\n\nThis plan scores +2 immediately and sets up for long survival by accessing open areas early.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: L\nTurn 14: L\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: L\n}",

        "step": 13,

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,1), then body segments at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail at (5,4). Head direction is down, which is D. Since head is at (6,1) and moving down, that would be to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down would hit the wall. Head direction is given as D, but I need to choose the next move based on that.\n\nThe head direction is the current facing direction, but I can choose to move in a different direction, except I can't instantly reverse. Since current direction is D (down), I cannot move up (U) immediately because that would be opposite.\n\nNow, food: there are two food items. One at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 2. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 13, it has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 14? Let me read carefully.\n\nLife-span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (5,1) with life span 2 at turn 13. That means:\n\n- At turn 13: life span 2\n\n- After turn 13, it decreases to 1\n\n- After turn 14, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 13 or 14, but not after that.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10. So it will last until turn 22 or something, but I need to think ahead only 5+ turns, so it should be available for a while.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,1). Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut D is down to (6,0), which is y=0, wall, so collision, death. Cannot move D.\n\nL is left to (5,1). (5,1) has food, but let's see what's there.\n\n(5,1) is a food position with positive food.\n\nR is right to (7,1). x=7 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot move R.\n\nU is up to (6,2). But (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body segment. Snake positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), so (6,2) is the first body segment.\n\nIf I move up to (6,2), that would be moving into the body, which is a collision, death. But the rule says: body collision if head touches any body segment, but there's an exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (6,2) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). The body segments are (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So (6,2) is the neck, directly behind head.\n\nIf I move to (6,2), head would be where the neck is, but since the neck will move away only if the snake moves, but in this move, if head moves to (6,2), and the body was at (6,2), it might cause collision.\n\nLet me read the collision rule carefully.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving into a body segment other than the tail is deadly. Only the tail cell is safe to move into because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (6,2) is not the tail; it's the segment right after head. Tail is at (5,4). So moving to (6,2) would be collision with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving down or right hits wall.\n\nMoving left to (5,1) might be possible.\n\n(5,1) is a food position. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,1):\n\n- U: to (6,2) - but occupied by body, collision, invalid\n\n- D: to (6,0) - wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (5,1) - not wall, not body? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nSo (5,1) is not occupied by snake, and not a wall except the internal obstacle is at (5,2), not (5,1).\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (5,2).\n\nSo (5,1) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake body. It has food, but that's fine.\n\n- R: to (7,1) - x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1). Is that right?\n\nU to (6,2) is invalid because body collision.\n\nD invalid, R invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) seems valid.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates. Head at (6,1), left is (5,1), which is within bounds, not wall, not body.\n\n(5,1) has food, but we'll deal with that.\n\nSo for turn 13, only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move to (5,1), I eat the food there. It's positive food, value +1, so snake length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (5,1), then the body: since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so new segments: head at (5,1), then previous head (6,1) becomes body, then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (5,4). But since it grew, the tail stays, so positions become: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nOriginal positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] with head at (6,1)\n\nAfter moving left to (5,1), head is now at (5,1), and since it ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the body is: previous head (6,1) is now the first body segment, then (6,2), then (6,3), then (5,3), then (5,4). So snake becomes: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nNow, head direction: I moved left, so new head direction is L.\n\nBut I need to think about future turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,1) is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nNow, life span: food at (5,1) had life span 2 at turn 13. After eating it on turn 13, it's gone.\n\nOther food at (2,2) with life span 10, so it will be there for a while.\n\nNow, after turn 13, snake is at (5,1), head direction L.\n\nNow, for turn 14, possible moves.\n\nCurrent head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nCannot move right (R) because that's opposite to L, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nL is left to (4,1)\n\nU is up to (5,2)\n\nBut (5,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nD is down to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot move D.\n\nDown from (5,1) is (5,0), y=0 wall.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- L: to (4,1)\n\n- U: to (5,2) - but (5,2) is wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (5,0) - wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (6,1) - but R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n(4,1) is empty, I assume.\n\nSo turn 14: move L to (4,1), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,1), then body: previous head (5,1) becomes new body, then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (5,4) moves away? Since no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nStandard snake movement: if no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, and tail leaves its cell.\n\nSo after moving to (4,1) without eating: positions become [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] and tail was (5,4), which is not part of snake now, so (5,4) is empty.\n\nSnake segments: let's list indices.\n\nBefore move: segments: 0: head (5,1), 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: tail (5,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) without eating: new head (4,1), segment 1 moves to previous head position (5,1), segment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (6,1), segment 3 moves to previous of segment 2, (6,2), segment 4 moves to previous of segment 3, (6,3), and segment 5 moves to previous of segment 4, which was (5,3). Tail was segment 5 at (5,4), but it moves to where segment 4 was, which is (5,3)? Let's think.\n\nPositions before move:\n\n- Segment 0: (5,1) - head\n\n- Segment 1: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,4) - tail\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1):\n\n- New segment 0: (4,1) - head\n\n- Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to where segment 4 was: (5,3)\n\nAnd the previous tail position (5,4) is now empty.\n\nSo snake positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail is now at (5,3), which was previously segment 4.\n\nNow, head at (4,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow turn 15: possible moves from (4,1), direction L.\n\nCannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible: U, D, L.\n\nL to (3,1)\n\nU to (4,2)\n\nD to (4,0) - but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(4,2) and (3,1) both seem accessible.\n\nNo immediate threats, but I need to think about the other food at (2,2).\n\nAlso, the food at (5,1) is gone, only (2,2) left, with life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 13, food at (2,2) had life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 13, it decreases to 9? Life span decreases every turn, including when we don't eat, I think.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nFor food at (2,2) at turn 13: life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 13, it becomes 9.\n\nAfter turn 14, 8, and so on.\n\nBut we can eat it anytime before it disappears.\n\nNow, snake at (4,1), need to get to (2,2), which is left and up.\n\n(2,2) is at x=2,y=2.\n\nCurrent head (4,1), so to reach (2,2), need to go left to x=2 and up to y=2.\n\nPossible paths.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, internal wall at (5,2), but that's not in the way directly.\n\nNow, back to turn 13, I assumed only move is L to (5,1), but is that the only option?\n\nAt turn 13, head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,0) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,1) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,2) body collision, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) valid, as above.\n\nBut is there a way to not eat the food? But I have to move, and only L is possible, so I must move to (5,1) and eat the food.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving to (5,1) is safe.\n\n(5,1) has food, positive, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, after eating, the tail is at (5,4), and head is at (5,1). Are they adjacent?\n\n(5,1) and (5,4): same x, y difference 3, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right, so |dy| or |dx| =1.\n\nHere |dy| =3, so not adjacent. Tail is at (5,4), head at (5,1), so no issue.\n\nAfter moving, head at (5,1), tail at (5,4), far apart.\n\nSo eating is safe.\n\nThen turn 14, I moved to (4,1), no choice.\n\nNow turn 15, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,1), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) invalid.\n\nNow, I need to go towards (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), current (4,1), so I need to go left twice and up once, or up once then left, etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nGrid: walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nAvailable cells.\n\nFrom (4,1), moving U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(4,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: after turn 14, snake is [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nSo (4,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) empty.\n\n(4,2) is not a wall; walls are borders and (5,2), so (4,2) is fine.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), then head direction becomes U.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,3), (3,2), etc., to reach (2,2).\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), direction L, then to (2,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) is the food, so I need to plan how to eat it.\n\nBut life span is long, 10 at turn 13, so after 2 turns, at turn 15, it has life span 8 or something, but still plenty.\n\nBut I should think about risks.\n\nAnother thing: after turn 13, I ate the food at (5,1), so it's gone.\n\nNow for turn 15, I have choices.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 13.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 13,14,15,... but how many? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is for several turns, not specified how many. Probably I need to output a sequence until a point where it's clear or I need to decide.\n\nSince only one move at turn 13, I can start with that.\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 14: move L to (4,1) as I thought, only choice.\n\nThen turn 15: from (4,1), I can choose U or L.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFood at (2,2) is positive, I should eat it, but no rush.\n\nBut there might be no other food, so I should go for it.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nCurrent snake positions: after turn 14, [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nThe area around: for example, if I go up to (4,2), from there I can go to (4,3), (3,2), (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, so not.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but that's body, or L to (3,2), R to (5,2) wall.\n\nCurrent direction after moving to (4,1) is L, but at turn 15, from (4,1), if I move U, direction changes to U.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), then head at (4,2), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is body segment, collision, or L to (3,2), R to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,1), then head at (3,1), direction L, then can move U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall invalid, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) body? (4,1) is body, but if I just moved from there, let's see.\n\nSuppose at turn 15 I move L to (3,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,1), then body: (4,1) moves to where head was? Positions: before move, head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,1) no eat: head (3,1), segment 1 to (4,1), segment 2 to (5,1), segment 3 to (6,1), segment 4 to (6,2), segment 5 to (6,3), and (5,3) is left, tail moves to (6,3)? Let's index.\n\nBefore turn 15 move: segments: 0: (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,1): new head (3,1), seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (5,1), seg3 to (6,1), seg4 to (6,2), seg5 to (6,3), and previous tail (5,3) gone, so positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\n(5,3) is empty now.\n\nHead at (3,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (2,1), (3,2), or U to (3,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), so from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), then from there to (2,2) or other.\n\n(3,2) might be available.\n\nTo reach (2,2), I should go to (3,2) first or directly from (3,1) to (2,1) then up, but (2,2) is above (2,1).\n\nLet's list coordinates.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, I can plan to go to the food.\n\nBut at turn 13, I must move L to (5,1).\n\nTurn 14, must move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 15, I can choose to move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), then I'm closer to y=2.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or U to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to (2,2), so I can go to (3,2) then to (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,1) at turn 15, then from (3,1) I can move U to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nEither way, I can reach (2,2) soon.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) might have Tail Reward Danger or something, but tail is far.\n\nAfter turn 14, tail is at (5,3) or after moves.\n\nLet's simulate a sequence.\n\nStart from turn 13:\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1) - eat food, snake grows to length 6: positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] head direction L\n\nFood at (5,1) eaten, gone.\n\nTurn 14: from (5,1), only move L to (4,1) - no food, so snake moves: head to (4,1), body: (5,1) from previous, then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (5,4) moves to (5,3)? Positions: before move, head (5,1), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (5,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,1) no eat: head (4,1), seg1 to (5,1), seg2 to (6,1), seg3 to (6,2), seg4 to (6,3), seg5 to (5,3), so positions [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] head direction L\n\nTail at (5,3)\n\nTurn 15: from (4,1), I can move U or L.\n\nSuppose I move U to (4,2) - no food there, I assume. Food only at (2,2), which is not eaten yet.\n\nSo move U to (4,2): head to (4,2), direction U.\n\nThen snake moves: head (4,2), seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (5,1), seg3 to (6,1), seg4 to (6,2), seg5 to (6,3), and (5,3) gone. Positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nHead at (4,2), direction U.\n\nNow turn 16: from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) wall, D to (4,1) body collision.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), which is closer to food (2,2).\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to (2,2).\n\nMove L to (3,2): head to (3,2), direction L? Moving left, so direction L.\n\nThen if no food, positions: head (3,2), seg1 to (4,2), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (5,1), seg4 to (6,1), seg5 to (6,2), and (6,3) gone.\n\nBut (2,2) has food, so I need to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen on turn 17, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nBut (2,2) is the food position.\n\nWhen I move to (2,2), I eat the food.\n\nNow, is there Tail Reward Danger? Tail is at (6,2) or something, far from (2,2), no issue.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 15, if I moved U to (4,2), then turn 16 move L to (3,2), no food, so positions: after turn 16, head at (3,2), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail at (6,2)? Let's list.\n\nBefore turn 16 move: positions [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] head (4,2)\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) no eat: head (3,2), seg1 to (4,2), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (5,1), seg4 to (6,1), seg5 to (6,2), and (6,3) gone. Positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nNow turn 17: from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nMove L to (2,2): since (2,2) has food, I eat it.\n\nCurrent direction: after moving to (3,2), direction is L, so moving L to (2,2) is fine, not reverse.\n\nEat food, snake grows: head to (2,2), then body: previous head (3,2) becomes new segment, and tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) and tail stays? Since ate, tail doesn't move, so the last segment (6,2) remains.\n\nBefore move: segments: 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2) tail\n\nAfter moving to (2,2) and eat: new head (2,2), seg1 to where seg0 was: (3,2), seg2 to where seg1 was: (4,2), seg3 to where seg2 was: (4,1), seg4 to where seg3 was: (5,1), seg5 to where seg4 was: (6,1), and seg5 (tail) was at (6,2), but since ate, it stays, so new segment 6 at (6,2)? Let's think.\n\nStandard: when eat, head moves to food, new segment added at the end, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the position where tail was remains part of snake.\n\nSo before move, tail is at (6,2)\n\nAfter head moves to (2,2) and eats, the snake becomes: head (2,2), then the previous segments: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and the tail (6,2) remains, so now 7 segments.\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nYes.\n\nNow head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to continue.\n\nBut the food is eaten, so no more food, but I can survive.\n\nBut I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 15 I chose U to (4,2), but I could have chosen L to (3,1) at turn 15.\n\nIf at turn 15 I move L to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) on turn 16, then to (2,2) on turn 17.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut moving U to (4,2) at turn 15 might be better because I go up, which might give more space, but in this case, from (4,1) moving U or L both fine.\n\nBut let's see if moving L to (3,1) has risk.\n\nAt turn 15, if move L to (3,1): positions after: head (3,1), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail at (6,3)? After turn 14: positions [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nMove L to (3,1) no eat: head (3,1), seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (5,1), seg3 to (6,1), seg4 to (6,2), seg5 to (6,3), and (5,3) gone. Positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,1), can move U to (3,2), or L to (2,1), or D to (3,0) wall invalid, R to (4,1) body collision.\n\nCurrent direction L, so moving R to (4,1) is opposite? Direction: after moving L to (3,1), direction is L, so moving R to (4,1) would be right, which is opposite to left, so instant reverse not allowed. Cannot move R.\n\nSo possible U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), no food, positions: head (3,2), seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (5,1), seg4 to (6,1), seg5 to (6,2), (6,3) gone. Positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nThen turn 17: move L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nHead at (3,2), move L to (2,2), eat, grow.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) and tail remains (6,2)? Before move, tail at (6,2), after eat, new segment at tail, so positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\n(6,2) is included.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the food on turn 17.\n\nNow, in the first path, when I moved to (4,2) on turn 15, the tail was at (6,3) or something, but no issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 13 and 14, I have no choice.\n\nFor turn 15, I need to choose an action.\n\nSince both U and L lead to eating the food, and no immediate risk, I can choose either.\n\nBut to maximize long-term, after eating the food, I need to survive.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), head at (2,2), with a longer snake.\n\nThe grid has walls, and I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after being at (2,2), I can move to (1,2), (2,3), (2,1), (3,2), but (3,2) might be body.\n\nIn the sequence where I went via (4,2), after eating at (2,2), positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\n(3,2) is the first body segment, so moving to (3,2) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,1): is (2,1) occupied? Positions: (2,2) head, (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n(2,1) is not in the list, so probably empty.\n\nL to (1,2): x=1, not wall, y=2.\n\nU to (2,3): y=3, not wall.\n\nBut R to (3,2) body, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nSimilarly, if I went via (3,1), after eating: positions [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nFrom (2,2), R to (3,2) body, invalid; D to (2,1) might be empty; U to (2,3); L to (1,2).\n\nSame.\n\nNow, to survive, I should go to open areas.\n\nBut since no more food, I just need to not die.\n\nBut the grid is small, and snake is long, might be tricky.\n\nFor example, the bottom left area might have space.\n\nBut let's not go too far; I need to output for current turns.\n\nFor the answer, I can output the sequence up to eating the food or a bit more.\n\nBut at turn 13, only one choice.\n\nTurn 14, only one choice.\n\nTurn 15, I have choice between U and L.\n\nBoth are fine, but let's see which one has better future options.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2) at turn 15, then to (3,2) at 16, then to (2,2) at 17.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1) at turn 15, then to (3,2) at 16, then to (2,2) at 17.\n\nIn both cases, turn 17 I eat the food.\n\nBut in the first case, when I move to (3,2) at turn 16, from (4,2), moving L to (3,2), and (3,2) might be empty, which it is.\n\nSimilarly in second case.\n\nBut in the second case, at turn 15, moving L to (3,1), then at turn 16 moving U to (3,2), which is fine.\n\nBut at turn 16, from (3,1), if I move U to (3,2), it's up, so direction U.\n\nThen turn 17 move L to (2,2), which is left, not opposite.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, after eating, in both cases, I'm at (2,2) with similar body positions.\n\nBut in the first path, when I went via (4,2), the body has (4,1), which is below, so from (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) or left to (1,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly in second path.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut to be specific, I'll choose to move U at turn 15 for no particular reason.\n\nPerhaps moving U at turn 15 keeps the snake in a less cramped position.\n\nAt turn 14, snake is at [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] so the body is mostly on the right and down.\n\nMoving U to (4,2) at turn 15 moves the head up, which might open more space.\n\nMoving L to (3,1) keeps it low.\n\nBut since I need to go to (2,2), up is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nLet's list the sequence.\n\nTurn 13: move L\n\nTurn 14: move L\n\nTurn 15: move U\n\nThen turn 16: move L (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: move L (to (2,2) to eat)\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, in the output, it should be like \"Turn 13: L\", etc.\n\nNow, after that, I can stop or continue.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and from turn 13 to 17 is 5 turns, I can output up to turn 17 or 18.\n\nBut at turn 17 I eat the food, so it's a milestone.\n\nPerhaps output until turn 17.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\nThe food at (2,2) has life span 10 at turn 13, so by turn 17, how many turns passed.\n\nTurn 13: life span 10\n\nAfter turn 13: 9\n\nAfter turn 14: 8\n\nAfter turn 15: 7\n\nAfter turn 16: 6\n\nAfter turn 17: 5, but eaten on turn 17, so it's fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think it's ok.\n\nBut at turn 13, I must move L, no choice.\n\nSimilarly turn 14, move L.\n\nTurn 15, I can move U or L, I'll choose U.\n\nThen turn 16, from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17, from (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n\nNow, what about direction? But I don't need to track direction for output, just actions.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nAlso, need to confirm if at turn 17, moving to (2,2) is valid.\n\n(2,2) has food, and it's not under body or anything.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (3,2) on turn 16, (3,2) is empty, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 13, when I move to (5,1), the food there has life span 2, and I eat it on turn 13, so it's within life span.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2), eaten on turn 17, life span was 10 at turn 13, so at turn 17, after decrease, it should be 6 or something, but still present.\n\nLife span at turn 13: 10\n\nAfter turn 13: 9 (before turn 14)\n\nAfter turn 14: 8 (before turn 15)\n\nAfter turn 15: 7 (before turn 16)\n\nAfter turn 16: 6 (before turn 17)\n\nOn turn 17, I eat it, life span 6, so ok.\n\nNow, I think the sequence is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: L\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: L\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nBut turn 17 is move to (2,2), which is left from (3,2).\n\nNow, in the output, it should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, for turn 18 and beyond, I don't need to, since I thought 5 turns ahead to eating.\n\nFrom turn 13 to 17 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 13: action for t1=13\n\nTurn 14: t1+1=14\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 17: t1+4=17\n\nt1=13, t1+1=14, t1+2=15, t1+3=16, t1+4=17.\n\n5 turns.\n\nI can add one more if needed, but not necessary.\n\nTo be complete.\n\nAfter turn 17, head at (2,2), I can move, say, U to (2,3) or something, but not specified.\n\nI think up to turn 17 is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 15, I chose U, but L is also possible, but U is ok.\n\nTo make it consistent.\n\nAnother point: at turn 13, when I move to (5,1), is there any risk with the food?\n\nThe food at (5,1) was under the body? Not necessarily; in the state, snake was at (6,1), (6,2), etc., (5,1) was empty with food.\n\nThe rule about food under body: but here it's not under body, so can be eaten directly.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 13):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid (coordinates (0,0) to (7,7)) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (6,1), body segments at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail at (5,4). Length = 5.\n  - Head direction: Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,1): Value +1, life span 2 (will disappear after turn 14).\n  - (2,2): Value +1, life span 10 (will disappear after turn 22).\n- **Immediate Constraints**:\n  - At turn 13, head at (6,1) with direction D.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Up (U) to (6,2): Occupied by body segment (6,2) → collision, invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (6,0): Wall (y=0) → collision, invalid.\n    - Left (L) to (5,1): Valid, contains positive food.\n    - Right (R) to (7,1): Wall (x=7) → collision, invalid.\n  - Only valid move is L to (5,1) to eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 6).\n  - No Tail Reward Danger: Tail at (5,4) is not adjacent to (5,1) (|dy| = 3 > 1).\n\n**Turn 14:**\n- After moving to (5,1) at turn 13:\n  - Snake positions: Head at (5,1), body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail at (5,4). Length = 6.\n  - Head direction: Left (L).\n- Possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (5,2): Wall (internal obstacle) → invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (5,0): Wall (y=0) → invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (4,1): Valid, no food.\n  - Right (R) to (6,1): Opposite to current direction L → instant reverse, invalid.\n- Only valid move is L to (4,1). No food eaten, snake moves normally (tail moves).\n\n**Turn 15:**\n- After moving to (4,1) at turn 14:\n  - Snake positions: Head at (4,1), body at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail at (5,3). Length = 6.\n  - Head direction: Left (L).\n- Possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (4,2): Valid, no food.\n  - Down (D) to (4,0): Wall (y=0) → invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Valid, no food.\n  - Right (R) to (5,1): Opposite to current direction L → instant reverse, invalid.\n- Choice: Both U and L are valid. Moving U to (4,2) is prioritized to position the snake closer to y=2 (food at (2,2)) and avoid potential dead ends near the bottom. This sets up for efficient pathing to the food.\n\n**Turn 16:**\n- After moving to (4,2) at turn 15:\n  - Snake positions: Head at (4,2), body at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail at (6,3). Length = 6.\n  - Head direction: Up (U) (from turn 15 move).\n- Possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (4,3): Valid, no food.\n  - Down (D) to (4,1): Occupied by body segment (4,1) → collision, invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (3,2): Valid, no food (adjacent to food at (2,2)).\n  - Right (R) to (5,2): Wall (internal obstacle) → invalid.\n- Move L to (3,2) to approach food at (2,2). No food eaten.\n\n**Turn 17:**\n- After moving to (3,2) at turn 16:\n  - Snake positions: Head at (3,2), body at (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail at (6,2). Length = 6.\n  - Head direction: Left (L) (from turn 16 move).\n- Possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (3,3): Valid, no food.\n  - Down (D) to (3,1): Valid, no food.\n  - Left (L) to (2,2): Valid, contains positive food.\n  - Right (R) to (4,2): Occupied by body segment (4,2) → collision, invalid.\n- Move L to (2,2) to eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 7). No Tail Reward Danger (tail at (6,2) is not adjacent).\n\n**Long-Term Considerations (5+ Turns):**\n- **Food Strategy**: Ate high-priority food at (5,1) on turn 13 (life span 2). Ate food at (2,2) on turn 17 (life span 10 at turn 13; after decreases, life span was 6 at turn 17, so valid). No other food; maximize survival after eating.\n- **Survival Post-Turn 17**: After eating at (2,2), head at (2,2) with body extending to (6,2). Open moves include U to (2,3), D to (2,1), or L to (1,2). Avoid R to (3,2) (body collision). Prioritize moving left/up to open areas for longevity.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: No negative food present. Early moves avoided walls/body collisions. Path to (2,2) was efficient with no dead ends. Future focus: Navigate open spaces (e.g., leftward to (1,2) or upward to (2,3)) to prevent self-trapping.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 13-17):**\n- Turn 13: Move L (to eat food at (5,1), grow to length 6).\n- Turn 14: Move L (only valid move, no food).\n- Turn 15: Move U (position for food approach, no food).\n- Turn 16: Move L (approach food at (2,2), no food).\n- Turn 17: Move L (to eat food at (2,2), grow to length 7).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: L \\\\\nTurn 14: L \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: L \\\\\nTurn 17: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,1), then body segments: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (5,1) from... let's see the positions: previous head was at (6,1) since it moved left to (5,1). Snake positions are listed as [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)], so head is (5,1), then next is (6,1), which is the first body segment. Since head direction is L, it came from the right, so from (6,1) to (5,1).\n\nNow, food: only one food mentioned: (2,2) with value 1 and life span 9. But in the input, it says \"(2, 2, 9, 1)\" – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value), so (2,2), life_span=9, value=1. Since value is positive, it's positive food.\n\nLife span is 9, and it decreases every turn, including current turn. So on turn 14, life span is 9, meaning it will disappear after 9 more turns, so on turn 23 it will be gone.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders and at (5,2).\n\nSnake:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nSo let's list all positions:\n\n- (5,1): head\n\n- (6,1): body\n\n- (6,2): body\n\n- (6,3): body\n\n- (5,3): body\n\n- (5,4): tail\n\nNow, head direction is L, so it's facing left. That means it can move U, D, L, or R, but not opposite to current direction immediately? No, the constraint is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is L, opposite is R, so it cannot move right on this turn. But it can move up, down, or left.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=14, and I need to choose action for turn 14.\n\nPossible moves from (5,1):\n\n- Up (U): to (5,2) – but (5,2) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacles. Walls: border cells and internal obstacle at (5,2). So (5,2) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Down (D): to (5,0) – but y=0 is a wall, so cannot move down.\n\n- Left (L): to (4,1) – let's check if this is valid. x=4, y=1, which is within bounds, and not a wall. Also, is it occupied by body? Snake body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) – (4,1) is not in this list, so should be free.\n\n- Right (R): to (6,1) – but (6,1) is occupied by the body. However, the rule says: can move into tail cell because tail moves, but (6,1) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). Let's see collision rules.\n\nDeadly collisions: body collision (head touches any body segment). But exception: can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nIn this case, (6,1) is the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is (5,4). So moving to (6,1) would be a body collision, since it's not the tail.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (6,1) is the segment right after head, so if head moves to (6,1), it would be colliding with the body part that is currently there, and since the body moves after the head, that segment might still be there or not? Let's think about movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves:\n\n- The head moves to a new cell.\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\n- The tail moves away from its current position.\n\nSo if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail moves, so no collision. But if it moves to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment, that segment hasn't moved yet, so it would collide.\n\nIn this case, from (5,1), moving right to (6,1): (6,1) is currently occupied by the first body segment. When head moves to (6,1), that cell is occupied, and since it's not the tail, it's a collision. The tail is at (5,4), so (6,1) is not tail.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,1) would cause a collision and death.\n\nMoving up to (5,2) is wall.\n\nMoving down to (5,0) is wall.\n\nMoving left to (4,1) is free.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (4,1)? But is that true?\n\nWhat about moving up or down? (5,1) to (5,2) is blocked by wall, (5,0) wall, right is body, left is (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) might be free; let's confirm.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(4,1): x=4, y=1, not on border, not the obstacle (5,2), and not in snake positions: snake at (5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(5,3),(5,4). So (4,1) is empty.\n\nTherefore, for turn 14, the only safe move is left to (4,1).\n\nBut the food is at (2,2), which is far away. Value 1, life span 9, so it will be there until turn 23.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), what can I do?\n\nAlso, snake head direction was L, and I move left, so direction remains L.\n\nNow, for turn 14, action must be L, since it's the only choice.\n\nBut let's confirm: are there other options? Up and down are walls, right is body, so yes, only left.\n\nSo for turn 14: L\n\nNow, after move, new positions: head moves to (4,1), then body: the segment that was at (6,1) moves to (5,1) (previous head position), but (5,1) is now the new position for the first body segment.\n\nLet's update snake positions after turn 14 move.\n\nCurrent positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nAfter moving left to (4,1):\n\n- New head: (4,1)\n\n- Then body segments: the first body segment moves to the old head position (5,1)\n\n- Second body segment moves to old first body position (6,1)\n\n- Third to (6,2)\n\n- Fourth to (6,3)\n\n- Fifth to (5,3)\n\n- Tail: the tail was (5,4), but since the snake didn't eat, length unchanged, tail moves away. The last body segment moves to (5,3), so tail is now at (5,3)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- Body 1: old head position (5,1)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 position (6,1)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 position (6,2)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 position (6,3)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 position (5,3)  // since body 4 was at (6,3), moves to (6,3)? Positions: index 0: head, 1: body1, 2: body2, etc.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: new position (4,1)\n\n- New segment 1: position of old head (5,1)\n\n- New segment 2: position of old segment 1 (6,1)\n\n- New segment 3: position of old segment 2 (6,2)\n\n- New segment 4: position of old segment 3 (6,3)\n\n- New segment 5: position of old segment 4 (5,3)  // old segment 4 was (5,3)? Let's see old positions: positions[0]=(5,1), [1]=(6,1), [2]=(6,2), [3]=(6,3), [4]=(5,3), [5]=(5,4)\n\nAfter head moves to (4,1):\n\n- New [0] = (4,1)  // head\n\n- New [1] = old [0] = (5,1)  // body\n\n- New [2] = old [1] = (6,1)  // body\n\n- New [3] = old [2] = (6,2)  // body\n\n- New [4] = old [3] = (6,3)  // body\n\n- New [5] = old [4] = (5,3)  // tail? old [4] was (5,3), which is now the tail position.\n\nThe tail was old [5]=(5,4), but since no eating, the tail moves off. The segment that was at (5,4) is not part of the snake anymore; the new tail is at old [4] position? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nPositions: the snake has segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., S_k (tail).\n\nAfter move:\n\n- S0 moves to new position\n\n- S1 moves to old S0 position\n\n- S2 moves to old S1 position\n\n- ...\n\n- S_k moves to old S_{k-1} position\n\nAnd the old S_k position is vacated.\n\nIn this case, k=5 (since 6 segments: indices 0 to 5).\n\nOld positions: S0=(5,1), S1=(6,1), S2=(6,2), S3=(6,3), S4=(5,3), S5=(5,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1):\n\n- New S0 = (4,1)\n\n- New S1 = old S0 = (5,1)\n\n- New S2 = old S1 = (6,1)\n\n- New S3 = old S2 = (6,2)\n\n- New S4 = old S3 = (6,3)\n\n- New S5 = old S4 = (5,3)  // now tail at (5,3)\n\nOld S5=(5,4) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nHead at (4,1), direction is still L, since moved left.\n\nNow, for turn 15, I need to choose next move.\n\nCurrent head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2)\n\n- D: to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (3,1)\n\n- R: to (5,1) but (5,1) is now occupied by S1, the first body segment. Not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nTail is at (5,3), so (5,1) is body, not tail.\n\nTherefore, cannot move right to (5,1).\n\nDown to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: up to (4,2) or left to (3,1).\n\n(4,2) is free? Let's check: not wall, not snake position.\n\nSnake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(4,2) not in list, and no wall, so free.\n\n(3,1) similarly free.\n\nFood is at (2,2), which is two steps left and one up from (4,1), or one left and one up from (3,1), etc.\n\nI need to plan towards the food but safely.\n\nAlso, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I should think about the path.\n\nFirst, from (4,1), I can go up to (4,2) or left to (3,1).\n\nIf I go left to (3,1), then from there, I can go U to (3,2), or L to (2,1), etc., towards food at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is adjacent to (2,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,3), not near food, so probably not an issue now.\n\nBut when I approach food, I need to ensure that if food is under tail, I don't eat it when adjacent.\n\nCurrently food at (2,2) is not under snake, I think.\n\nSnake is at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3); (2,2) is free.\n\nNow, let's plan a path to (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go left to (3,1), then I can go up to (3,2), then from (3,2) to (2,2) to eat.\n\n(3,2) to (2,2) is left.\n\nBut I need to check if (2,2) is safe to eat when I move to it.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving to (2,2) which has food, and it's positive, so I eat it, length increases by one.\n\nBut no tail danger now.\n\nPath: turn 14: L to (4,1) — we already have that.\n\nTurn 15: from (4,1), I can go L to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,1), go U to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 17: from (3,2), go L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut is (3,2) free? Yes, currently.\n\nAfter turn 15 move to (3,1), snake positions: head to (3,1), body: S1 to (4,1), S2 to (5,1), S3 to (6,1), S4 to (6,2), S5 to (6,3) // tail at (6,3)\n\nOld positions before turn 15: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] S0=(4,1), S1=(5,1), S2=(6,1), S3=(6,2), S4=(6,3), S5=(5,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,1):\n\nNew S0 = (3,1)\n\nNew S1 = old S0 = (4,1)\n\nNew S2 = old S1 = (5,1)\n\nNew S3 = old S2 = (6,1)\n\nNew S4 = old S3 = (6,2)\n\nNew S5 = old S4 = (6,3)  // tail\n\nOld S5=(5,3) vacated.\n\nNow, turn 16: from (3,1), I want to go U to (3,2)\n\nIs (3,2) free? No walls, no snake: current snake (3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3) — (6,2) is there, but (3,2) not, so free.\n\nMove U to (3,2)\n\nThen after: head (3,2), S1=(3,1), S2=(4,1), S3=(5,1), S4=(6,1), S5=(6,2) // tail at (6,2)\n\nThen turn 17: from (3,2), go L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\n(2,2) has food, value +1, so eat it.\n\nWhen moving to (2,2), it's food, so snake grows: head moves to (2,2), and the tail does not move, so new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nAfter move: head at (2,2), body: S1 at old head position (3,2), S2 at (3,1), S3 at (4,1), S4 at (5,1), S5 at (6,1), and since ate, new segment added, so S6 at old tail position (6,2)? Standard: when eat, head moves to new cell (with food), body segments move as usual, but tail stays, so new tail is old tail position.\n\nPositions: after move without eat: head new, body shift, tail vacated.\n\nWith eat: head new, body shift, and tail remains, so new segment at old tail position.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore move: positions S0=(3,2), S1=(3,1), S2=(4,1), S3=(5,1), S4=(6,1), S5=(6,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2):\n\n- New S0 = (2,2)\n\n- New S1 = old S0 = (3,2)\n\n- New S2 = old S1 = (3,1)\n\n- New S3 = old S2 = (4,1)\n\n- New S4 = old S3 = (5,1)\n\n- New S5 = old S4 = (6,1)\n\n- And since ate, add new segment at old S5 position: (6,2), so new S6 = (6,2)\n\nSo snake now: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nLength 7.\n\nAnd food at (2,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nLife span was 9, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nNow, this is for turn 17.\n\nBut I need actions starting from turn 14.\n\nIn this plan:\n\nTurn 14: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: L to (2,2) eat\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead? The instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is for actions on turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many to output. Probably I need to output for as many as I can, but since the state might change, perhaps just for the immediate decisions.\n\nThe answer format is: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output might be for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence of actions.\n\nBut in this case, with the food, I can reach it in 3 moves from turn 14.\n\nTurn 14 to 17.\n\nBut turn 14 is current, so actions for turn 14,15,16,17.\n\nBut after eating, I need to survive.\n\nNow, after turn 17, head at (2,2), and I need to move from there.\n\nBut let's see the state after eating.\n\nHead at (2,2), direction was left to get there, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nNow, (3,2) is occupied by S1, the first body segment, so cannot move right, collision.\n\n(2,1) is occupied by S2? Positions: S0=(2,2), S1=(3,2), S2=(3,1), S3=(4,1), S4=(5,1), S5=(6,1), S6=(6,2)\n\nSo (2,1) is not occupied? (2,1) is free? List: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — so (2,1) not in list, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free, (1,2) free.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by S1, so cannot move right.\n\nSo from (2,2), can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1), or L to (1,2).\n\nNo immediate danger, but I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nSince I ate the food, and no other food, I should just avoid walls and body.\n\nBut there might be more food later, but in this state, only one food given, so I need to assume that's all for now, or that new food may spawn, but the problem doesn't specify food spawning, so I think only the given food exists.\n\nThe food positions are given, so only (2,2) with life span 9.\n\nAfter eating it, no food, so I need to survive as long as possible without food, I guess.\n\nBut maximizing score means eating positive food when possible.\n\nCurrently, only one food, which I plan to eat on turn 17.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=14.\n\nTurn 14: move to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: move to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: move to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move to (2,2) and eat.\n\nNow, after that, I need to continue moving.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 14.\n\nThe output should be for turn 14, 15, 16, 17, and perhaps beyond.\n\nBut beyond, it depends.\n\nSince the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a bit further.\n\nAfter eating, snake is longer, and I need to navigate the space.\n\nThe grid has walls and obstacles.\n\nAvailable space: from (0,0) to (7,7), minus walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: all x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo playable cells: 6x6 minus one obstacle, so 35 cells? 6x6=36 cells, minus (5,2) obstacle, so 35 cells.\n\nSnake has 7 segments after eating, so 28 cells free.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAfter head at (2,2), I can move, say, left to (1,2) or down to (2,1) or up to (2,3).\n\n(1,2) is near border.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) near bottom.\n\n(2,3) is center.\n\nSince no food, I should just keep moving safely.\n\nBut to maximize survival, I should explore open areas.\n\nBack to turn 14 choices.\n\nEarlier I assumed I go left directly to (3,1), but I could go up first.\n\nFrom (4,1), I had two choices: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nI chose L to (3,1) to go directly to food.\n\nBut going U to (4,2) might be better for long-term?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf on turn 15, I go U to (4,2) instead.\n\nFrom (4,1), U to (4,2).\n\nThen positions after turn 15: head to (4,2), S1 to (4,1), S2 to (5,1), S3 to (6,1), S4 to (6,2), S5 to (6,3) // tail at (6,3)\n\nOld positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] S0=(4,1), S1=(5,1), S2=(6,1), S3=(6,2), S4=(6,3), S5=(5,3)\n\nAfter move U to (4,2):\n\nNew S0 = (4,2)\n\nNew S1 = old S0 = (4,1)\n\nNew S2 = old S1 = (5,1)\n\nNew S3 = old S2 = (6,1)\n\nNew S4 = old S3 = (6,2)\n\nNew S5 = old S4 = (6,3)  // tail\n\nOld S5=(5,3) vacated.\n\nNow, from (4,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by S1, not tail, so collision if move down.\n\nL to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo cannot move right.\n\nDown to (4,1) is body, invalid.\n\nLeft to (3,2) should be free.\n\nUp to (4,3) free.\n\nSo from (4,2), can go U to (4,3) or L to (3,2).\n\nFood at (2,2), so if go L to (3,2), then from there to (2,2) or other.\n\n(3,2) to (2,2) is left.\n\nBut (3,2) might be occupied later? Currently free.\n\nIf on turn 16, from (4,2) go L to (3,2), then turn 17 go L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nSame as before, but one turn later.\n\nTurn 15: U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 16: L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: L to (2,2) eat.\n\nCompared to previous: turn 15 L to (3,1), turn 16 U to (3,2), turn 17 L to (2,2).\n\nIn first plan, on turn 16 I'm at (3,2), in second, at turn 16 I'm also at (3,2), then eat on turn 17.\n\nBut in first plan, on turn 15 I'm at (3,1), which might be closer.\n\nBut in terms of turns to eat, same: turn 17 eat.\n\nBut in first case, after turn 15 at (3,1), I could have gone directly to (2,1) or something, but (2,1) not directly to food, food at (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,1), I went U to (3,2) then L to (2,2).\n\nI could from (3,1) go L to (2,1), then U to (2,2), but that also takes two moves: to (2,1) then to (2,2).\n\nBut when I move to (2,2), I eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut no big difference.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not an issue here.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,2) might be under the snake later? But in this path, it's not.\n\nBut in the state, the snake body is not near (2,2) now.\n\nSo both paths seem fine.\n\nBut earlier, from (4,1), if I go U to (4,2), I have more options later? For example, from (4,2) I can go to (4,3) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (4,3), I might go around, but it takes longer to reach food, and food has life span 9, but since I reach on turn 17, which is t1+3=17, life span was 9 on turn 14, so decreases each turn, on turn 15 life span 8, turn 16 life span 7, turn 17 life span 6, so still there, no problem.\n\nBut going directly is fine.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to survive.\n\nIn the first plan, after eating at (2,2), snake is around left-bottom area.\n\nPositions: after eating, head at (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNow, the area to the left and down is smaller.\n\n(2,2) can go U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\n(2,1) is free, (1,2) free, (2,3) free.\n\nIf I go left to (1,2), then I'm near the wall.\n\nx=1, y=2.\n\nThen from there, can go U to (1,3), D to (1,1), R to (2,2) but (2,2) is body now, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (2,1), near bottom.\n\nTo have more space, perhaps go up to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) to (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nMore open.\n\nSimilarly, in the alternative, if I was at (4,2) before, but I ended up at (2,2) anyway.\n\nBut to maximize long-term survival, after eating, I should move towards the center or open area.\n\nCurrently, the snake body is from (2,2) to (6,2) and down to (3,1), etc., so the right and bottom are occupied, left and top are free.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 except (5,2) wall.\n\nFree cells: many in top-left, for example.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), if I move up to (2,3), then I can go to (2,4), (3,3), etc., towards the center.\n\nWhereas if I go down or left, I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, if go left to (1,2), then from (1,2), can go U to (1,3), D to (1,1), but (1,1) and (1,3) are corners, might be dead ends.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) to (2,0) invalid, or (1,1), (3,1), but (3,1) is body now.\n\nAfter eating, positions include (3,1), so (3,1) is occupied.\n\nSo from (2,1), if I go there, can go to (1,1) or (2,2) but (2,2) body, or (3,1) body, so only (1,1) if free, but (1,1) might be free, but then stuck.\n\n(1,1): can go to (1,2) or (2,1), both might be occupied soon.\n\nSo better not to go down or left; go up to open area.\n\nTherefore, from (2,2), after eating, move up to (2,3).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the action sequence, I need to specify up to the point where I eat or beyond.\n\nThe output should include turn 14 action, and then for subsequent turns.\n\nSince the food is the only goal, and I eat on turn 17, I can output actions for turn 14,15,16,17.\n\nThen after that, I can continue with survival moves.\n\nBut the answer format might expect a sequence.\n\nI should output at least 5 actions? Turn 14 to 18 or something.\n\nTurn 14: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: L to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 18: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nNow, direction: after moving to (2,2) from (3,2), which is right? From (3,2) to (2,2) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (2,2), move U to (2,3), so direction changes to U.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), etc.\n\nAll fine.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead from turn 14: turns 14,15,16,17,18.\n\nActions: 14:L, 15:L, 16:U, 17:L, 18:U\n\nBut turn 18 U to (2,3)\n\nIs there any risk?\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not near, so ok.\n\nFood life span: on turn 14, life span 9, so disappears on turn 14+9-1? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning on the turn after it reaches 0.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, then after L turns, it disappears.\n\nOn turn t, L decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=1 on turn t + (L-1), then on next turn, it disappears.\n\nHere, turn 14, life span 9, so on turn 14: L=9, decrease to 8? Let's read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo on turn when it appears, life_span N, then each turn, countdown decreases, when countdown=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, countdown = N\n\nAfter turn t, countdown = N-1\n\n...\n\nAfter turn t + (N-1), countdown =1\n\nAfter turn t + N -1, when we move to next turn, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn t+N or after?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think after N turns, meaning on turn t+N it is gone.\n\nFor example, if N=1, disappears after 1 turn, so on the next turn, it's gone.\n\nAt turn t, countdown=1, after turn t, it disappears, so not available on turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, here N=9 at turn 14, so:\n\nTurn 14: countdown=9\n\nAfter turn 14, countdown=8 (before turn 15)\n\nTurn 15: countdown=8\n\n...\n\nTurn 22: countdown=1 (since 14+8=22?

No.\n\nTo confirm the no reverse move: on turn 17, I moved left to (2,2), so direction L. Then on turn 18, moving up, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nOpposite of L is R, U is perpendicular, fine.\n\nSimilarly, earlier moves.\n\nSo I think this is safe.\n\nOutput the actions.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 14 Decision\n\n**Current State (Turn 14):**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2)).\n- **Snake Positions:** Head at (5,1), body segments at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail at (5,4). Snake length is 6.\n- **Head Direction:** Left (L) – meaning the snake moved left to reach (5,1) from (6,1) on the previous turn.\n- **Food:** Only one food at (2,2) with value +1 and life span 9. It will disappear after turn 23 (countdown: 9 at turn 14, decreases to 8 after turn 14, and so on, reaching 0 at turn 23).\n- **Immediate Moves from (5,1):**\n  - Up (U) to (5,2): Blocked by internal wall (invalid).\n  - Down (D) to (5,0): Blocked by border wall (y=0, invalid).\n  - Right (R) to (6,1): Occupied by body segment (not tail; tail is at (5,4)). Moving here causes collision (deadly).\n  - Left (L) to (4,1): Free (no wall, obstacle, or snake body). **Only safe move.**\n\n**Path to Food and Risk Assessment:**\n- The food at (2,2) is valuable (+1 score, +1 length) and must be eaten before turn 23. It is safe to eat as it is not under the snake's tail (tail is at (5,4), far away), so no tail reward danger.\n- Shortest path to food: From (5,1) → (4,1) on turn 14 → (3,1) on turn 15 → (3,2) on turn 16 → (2,2) on turn 17. This takes 3 moves (turns 14-17) and eats the food safely.\n- **Why this path?** \n  - Minimizes turns to reach food, reducing risk of unexpected events (e.g., food expiration or new obstacles).\n  - Avoids dead ends: After eating, the snake can move upward to open areas (e.g., (2,3)) for long-term survival, as the bottom-right is crowded with body segments.\n  - No immediate risks: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. The path is clear, and food is not under the snake.\n- **Long-term survival (post-eating):** After eating at (2,2) on turn 17, the snake grows to length 7. The area near (2,2) has open cells (e.g., (2,3), (1,2), (2,1)), but moving up to (2,3) is preferred to access the open top-left quadrant (more space for evasion). From (2,3), future moves can explore toward (2,4) or (3,3) to avoid walls and body.\n\n**5+ Turn Lookahead Plan (Turns 14-18):**\n- **Turn 14 (current):** Move L to (4,1) – only safe option.\n- **Turn 15:** From (4,1), move L to (3,1) – direct path to food; U is also safe but delays eating.\n- **Turn 16:** From (3,1), move U to (3,2) – sets up direct move to food; D is invalid (wall), L to (2,1) possible but less efficient.\n- **Turn 17:** From (3,2), move L to (2,2) – eat food (+1 score, length increases to 7).\n- **Turn 18:** From (2,2), move U to (2,3) – prioritizes survival by moving to open area; avoids bottom/left corners which could trap the snake. Direction change from L to U is allowed (no instant reverse).\n\n**Why Not Other Paths?**\n- Going U on turn 15 (to (4,2)): Possible but adds delay to eating (still reaches food on turn 17 via (3,2)). However, it risks the snake body shifting and potentially blocking paths if food is not eaten promptly. Direct path is optimal.\n- After eating, moving D or L from (2,2) is riskier: D to (2,1) or L to (1,2) leads to corners with limited escape routes. U to (2,3) maximizes future mobility.\n\n**Food Life Span Consideration:** Food life span 9 at turn 14 → countdown 6 at turn 17 (safe to eat). Disappears after turn 23 if uneaten, but this plan eats it by turn 17.\n\n**Collision and Movement Checks:**\n- All moves respect \"no instant reverse\" (e.g., turn 17 direction L, turn 18 U is perpendicular, not opposite).\n- No wall/obstacle collisions: Path avoids (5,2) and borders.\n- Body collisions: Moving to tail cells is not needed; all target cells are free. After eating, moving to (2,3) is free.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: L (left)  \nTurn 15: L (left)  \nTurn 16: U (up)  \nTurn 17: L (left)  \nTurn 18: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 15. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but with (5,2) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the snake is shaped like: head at (4,1), body to the right to (5,1), down to (6,1), down to (6,2), down to (6,3), then left to (5,3). Head direction is L, meaning left, since it was moving left to (4,1) from (5,1)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (4,1) <- came from right? Positions are listed head first: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]. So the head is at (4,1), which is left of (5,1), and direction is L, so it's moving left. Next segment is (5,1), which is right of head, but that's the body. The direction is the current movement direction.\n\nHead direction is L, so it's facing left. That means from previous turn, it moved left to (4,1). Now, for the next move, I can't instantly reverse, so I can't move right (opposite of left). So possible moves are up, down, or left, but not right.\n\nNow, food: only one food item at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so since it's turn 15, it will disappear after 8 turns, so at turn 15 + 8 = 23, it will be gone. But life span decreases each turn, so on turn 15, life span is 8, turn 16 it becomes 7, ..., turn 22 it's 1, turn 23 it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 15 to 22 inclusive.\n\nFood value is +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer should include actions from turn 15 onwards, but since it's \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns, but the output should start from turn 15 action.\n\nThe answer format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so for turn 15, 16, 17, etc. But I need to specify actions for several turns, but it doesn't say how many; it says \"...\" so probably until I have a plan or something. But I think I should plan a sequence of moves that leads to eating the food safely or avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo possible cells:\n\n- x: 1 to 6\n\n- y: 1 to 6\n\nObstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- Body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail is at (5,3).\n\nFood at (2,2).\n\nCurrent head direction: L (left).\n\nPossible moves from (4,1): up, down, left. Not right because reverse not allowed.\n\n- Up: (4,1) to (4,2)\n\n- Down: (4,1) to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- Left: (4,1) to (3,1)\n\n- Right: not allowed, reverse.\n\nSo possible actions: U or L. Down is invalid because wall.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's see the path to the food. Food is at (2,2). From head (4,1), to reach (2,2), I need to go left and up.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I go L to (3,1), then from there, possible moves: from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) but (4,1) is where the body is, but let's see the snake movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the body segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I move from (4,1) to a new position, say (4,2) or (3,1), then the new snake positions will be: head at new position, then the body segments from index 1 to 5, but without the tail if I eat food, but I don't eat food yet.\n\nSince I'm not eating food, length remains same, so tail moves away.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent snake: positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ]\n\nIf I move up to (4,2), new head is (4,2), then the body becomes [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ], and tail (5,3) is removed since no growth. So new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (5,3) is gone, so (6,3) is now the tail? Let's list: after move, the segments are: new head (4,2), then previous head (4,1) becomes second segment, then (5,1) third, (6,1) fourth, (6,2) fifth, (6,3) sixth. But the snake has 6 segments, so after moving without eating, it should have same length, so tail is removed.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo from positions: index 0: head (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: tail (5,3)\n\nAfter move to new head position, say P.\n\nThen new positions: [P, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] and the tail (5,3) is removed, so the new tail is (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, if move to (3,1), new positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] and tail (5,3) gone.\n\nNow, the body segments: in first case, after moving up to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the cell (5,3) is now free.\n\nSimilarly, if move left to (3,1), positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) free.\n\nNow, food is at (2,2), which is not occupied by snake currently.\n\nI need to get to (2,2) to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go U to (4,2), then from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body, so collision? When moving, I can move to a cell that is not occupied by body except the tail, which will move.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (4,2), (4,1) is the second segment, so if I move down to (4,1) from (4,2), that would be collision because (4,1) is occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but occupied, invalid, L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n(5,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), L to (3,2). Down and right invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if from (4,1) I go left to (3,1), then from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid wall, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body segment, so invalid collision.\n\nSo only U or L from (3,1).\n\nNow, let's think about reaching the food at (2,2).\n\nFrom head (4,1), I can:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,2)\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or L to (3,2)\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), from (3,2), I can go to (2,2) directly? (3,2) to (2,2) is left, or to (3,3) up, (3,1) down, etc.\n\n(2,2) is food, and from (3,2), moving left to (2,2) would eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from (4,1), if I go U to (4,2), that might not be efficient to reach (2,2).\n\nIf I go directly left to (3,1), then from (3,1) go U to (3,2), then from (3,2) go L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nThat seems shorter.\n\nBut let's see the state after each move.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the life span of food. It has 8 turns left, so plenty of time, no rush.\n\nBut I should aim to eat it soon to avoid it disappearing or other risks, but since no other food, I need to eat this one.\n\nThe grid is small, and snake is long, 6 segments.\n\nPlayable area: 6x6 minus obstacle, so 36 -1 =35 cells, but walls are borders, so cells 1-6 in x and y, 36 cells, minus obstacle (5,2), so 35 cells, snake occupies 6, so 29 free cells, including food.\n\nAfter eating food, snake grows to 7 segments.\n\nNow, let's plan the move to (2,2).\n\nPath: from (4,1) to (2,2) can be via (3,1) then (3,2) then (2,2), or via (4,2) then (3,2) then (2,2), but (4,2) to (3,2) is left, then to (2,2) left.\n\nThe first way: move L to (3,1) on turn 15.\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,1) move U to (3,2)\n\nThen on turn 17, from (3,2) move L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nNow, check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, turn 15: move L to (3,1)\n\nAfter move: head at (3,1), body: [ (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ]? New positions: head (3,1), then previous head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Tail (5,3) gone.\n\nSo positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, head at (3,1), direction was L, but after move, the new direction depends on the move.\n\nFor reverse constraint, on next turn, I cannot move opposite to this move. I moved left to (3,1), so from (3,1), I cannot move right (towards (4,1)).\n\nNow turn 16: move U to (3,2)\n\nAfter move: head to (3,2), body: [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] and tail (6,3) gone.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNow, (6,3) free.\n\nHead direction now up.\n\nTurn 17: move L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nFood at (2,2), so eating it.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,2), which has food, so snake grows, so new length 7.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,2), then previous head (3,2) becomes second, and so on, and tail not removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n\nThe previous tail was (6,2), which is now part of body, and since we ate food, we add a segment, so the tail stays, and we add a new segment at tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo before move, positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail (6,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2) and eating food, new head at (2,2), then the previous segments are added: so [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] and since we ate, tail doesn't move, so (6,2) is now the 7th segment? Indices: 0: head (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: tail (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) was the tail before, now it's part of body, and since we ate, the tail is extended, so the new tail is still (6,2), but it's not moved, so the segment that was tail is still there, and we add a new segment at the position where tail was, but since tail didn't move, it stays.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: after moving without eating, tail is removed. After eating, tail is not removed.\n\nSo before move on turn 17, positions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] with head at (3,2), tail at (6,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2), which has food, so eat, grow. New positions: head at (2,2), then the existing body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — so all segments remain, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position? No, in snake, when you eat, you move head to food, and the tail stays in place, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n\nBut the tail position doesn't change immediately; it will move on next moves.\n\nIn terms of positions, after eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail does not advance, so the body segments are: new head, then the previous head, then previous body, but the tail position is not removed, so it's like the snake has an extra segment at the tail.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: [A, B, C, D, E] with A head, E tail.\n\nMove to new cell F, if no food, new positions [F, A, B, C, D] E gone.\n\nIf food at F, new positions [F, A, B, C, D, E] so E is still there, and we have new segment at E.\n\nIn this case, before move to (2,2): positions [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] head (3,2), tail (6,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2) with food, so new positions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] so now 7 segments, tail at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is still there.\n\nNow, back to the plan: on turn 17, I eat the food at (2,2).\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nFirst, when I move to (2,2), is it safe? The cell (2,2) was free, no body, and not wall, so should be ok.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n\nAlso, check the tail reward danger: but in this case, when I eat at (2,2), the head is not adjacent to tail, tail is at (6,2), far away, so no issue.\n\nNow, what about the path to get there.\n\nOn turn 15, move L to (3,1): from (4,1) to (3,1), which is free? Current positions: (4,1) is head, (5,1) body, etc., (3,1) is not occupied, so yes, free.\n\nAfter move, positions ok.\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2): (3,2) is free? Currently, before move, positions have (3,1) but not (3,2), so (3,2) should be free, and not wall, so ok.\n\nThen turn 17: move L to (2,2), which is food, free to move, eat.\n\nNow, after that, I have a longer snake, and I need to survive.\n\nBut the food is eaten, so no more food, but I need to maximize score, so I should find other food, but there is only one food, and it might respawn or something? The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so probably only this food for now. But since life span is long, and I eat it on turn 17, which is fine.\n\nBut turn 17 is after turn 15, so 2 moves later.\n\nNow, but in the plan, I need to output actions starting from turn 15.\n\nBut I should consider if there are risks in this path.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which is blocked.\n\nIn the snake positions, when I move, for example, after turn 16, positions include (6,2), which is near (5,2) obstacle.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nIs there a better way?\n\nSuppose on turn 15 I move U to (4,2) instead.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen from (3,2) move L to (2,2) on turn 17 to eat.\n\nSame number of turns to eat.\n\nBut let's see what happens.\n\nTurn 15: move U to (4,2)\n\nAfter move: head to (4,2), body: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ]? New positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Tail (5,3) gone.\n\nPositions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, head at (4,2), direction up.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid, D to (4,1) but occupied by body, invalid.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nTurn 16: move L to (3,2)\n\nAfter move: head to (3,2), body: [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] tail (6,3) gone.\n\nPositions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTurn 17: move L to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nSame as before, eat on turn 17.\n\nIn both cases, I reach food on turn 17.\n\nBut in the first approach, when I moved left first to (3,1), then up to (3,2), the body positions were different.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, both take two moves to reach adjacent, then eat on third action.\n\nBut in the first way, after turn 15 move to (3,1), the head is at (3,1), which is closer to left wall, but y=1, x=3, not wall.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,2), I need to think about survival.\n\nThe snake is at [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] with head at (2,2).\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2): U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but x=1, is it wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so x=1 is within 1-6, so not wall. Similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nx=1 is not wall, since borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to 6.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body segment, so collision if move there.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo (3,2) is directly right of head, so moving right to (3,2) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is below, which is occupied by? (2,1) is not in positions, positions have (3,1) at (3,1), not (2,1). (2,1) is free? Let's see: cells occupied: (2,2) head, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So (2,1) is free, (1,2) free, (2,3) free.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2). Not R to (3,2) occupied.\n\nNow, I need to avoid getting trapped since snake is long.\n\nThe grid has only 35 cells, snake 7, so 28 free, but with obstacle.\n\nBut I should think about the future.\n\nPerhaps I can consider going to (4,2) first might be better because it avoids going near the wall or something.\n\nBut in both cases, I end up eating at (2,2) on turn 17.\n\nNow, after that, I need to move the snake to survive.\n\nBut since there might be no other food, surviving means not colliding, but to maximize score, I need to eat more food, but no other food is mentioned. Probably, after this food is eaten or disappears, new food might spawn, but it's not specified. I think for now, I should eat this food and then survive.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score, so I should eat positive food.\n\nBut only one food here.\n\nPerhaps I should plan beyond eating.\n\nBut let's first decide the action for turn 15.\n\nIn the first option, moving L to (3,1) seems fine.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk with the body.\n\nAnother thing: the food life span is 8, I eat on turn 17, which is turn 15+2, so on turn 17, food has life span 8 - 2 = 6? Life span decreases every turn.\n\nTurn 15: life span 8\n\nAfter turn 15, life span becomes 7\n\nAfter turn 16, life span 6\n\nOn turn 17, when I move to it, life span 6, so I eat it.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From (4,1), I can only go U or L; going U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) both lead to eating in two more turns.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly, but not possible.\n\nNow, but in the move to (3,1), from (4,1) to (3,1), and (3,1) was free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2).\n\nBut let's see the state after turn 15 if I move U.\n\nIf I move U to (4,2) on turn 15, then positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, (6,3) is tail.\n\nFrom here, on turn 16, I can move L to (3,2) or U to (4,3).\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), as before.\n\nBut (3,2) is free? Before move, positions have (4,2), (4,1), etc., not (3,2), so free.\n\nThen turn 17 eat.\n\nIf from (4,2) I move U to (4,3) on turn 16, then from (4,3) I can go to (3,2) or other, but (3,2) is food, but from (4,3) to (3,2) is left and down? (4,3) to (3,2) is not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (4,3) to (3,3) left, or (4,2) down, or (4,4) up, or (5,3) right.\n\n(3,2) is not adjacent to (4,3); it's diagonal, not reachable directly.\n\nFrom (4,3), to reach (3,2), I need two moves: e.g., left to (3,3) then down to (3,2), or down to (4,2) then left to (3,2).\n\nBut (4,2) might be occupied later.\n\nIn this case, moving U first delays eating.\n\nSo better to go directly towards food.\n\nThus, moving left or up first both allow eating in three turns, but moving left first to (3,1) might be better because it positions the snake better for after eating? Let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2) via (3,1) and (3,2), the snake is at [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n\nHead at (2,2), which is near corner, x=2,y=2.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2)\n\nIf I go D to (2,1), for example.\n\nBut (2,1) is free, move there, then head to (2,1), body shifts: new head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) and tail (6,2) gone? No, after move without eating, tail moves.\n\nBut no food, so tail removed.\n\nPositions: after moving to (2,1), head (2,1), then previous head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1) since tail (6,2) removed? List: before move: positions [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] head (2,2), tail (6,2)\n\nMove to (2,1), no food, so new head (2,1), then the body: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] and tail (6,2) gone, so new tail (6,1).\n\n(6,2) is removed.\n\nNow, if I had gone via (4,2) first, after eating, positions [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] from earlier simulation.\n\nHead (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSimilar, but the body is different.\n\nIn the first case, with move L first, the body has (3,1) and (4,1), while in second, it has (4,2) and (4,1).\n\nNot much difference.\n\nBut in the first case, when I move to (3,1) on turn 15, let's see if (3,1) is safe.\n\nCurrent positions: snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(3,1) is not occupied, free.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(5,3) is gone.\n\nNow, (3,1) is near left wall, but x=1 is playable.\n\nFrom here, moving up to (3,2) is fine.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: the food is at (2,2), and if I go to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is not occupied by anything.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not relevant here.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going directly if there is risk, but no immediate risk.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan the sequence beyond eating.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), the snake is long, and the grid has limited space.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6 = 36, minus obstacle (5,2), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake has 7 segments, so 28 free cells.\n\nThe snake is at left-bottom area.\n\nFrom head (2,2), I can go up, down, or left.\n\nIf I go left to (1,2), then I am at the left wall, which might be risky if I need to turn.\n\nSimilarly, down to (2,1) or up to (2,3).\n\nTo have more space, going up might be better.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), go U to (2,3) on turn 18.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other food, I need to survive, but to maximize score, I should be ready for new food, but not specified.\n\nPerhaps for now, I should just eat the food safely.\n\nBut in the move to (3,1) on turn 15, it might be closer to the food, but let's see the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, moving left to (3,1) is consistent, so on next turn, I can move up, which is not reverse.\n\nIf I move up to (4,2) on turn 15, from (4,1) moving up, which is perpendicular, so new direction up, then I can move left or up.\n\nBoth are fine.\n\nBut moving left to (3,1) might be better because it brings me directly towards the food with one move, whereas moving up to (4,2) is not directly towards food; I need to go left then left again.\n\nIn terms of Manhattan distance, from (4,1) to (2,2) is |4-2| + |1-2| = 2+1=3, so minimum 3 moves.\n\nBoth paths take 3 moves to eat.\n\nBut in the path via (3,1), on turn 16 I move to (3,2), which is adjacent to food, and I eat on turn 17.\n\nSimilarly via (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,2).\n\nIn the first path, when I move to (3,1) on turn 15, and then to (3,2) on turn 16, the cell (3,2) might be occupied? No, before moving, on turn 15 after move, positions have (3,1), (4,1), etc., not (3,2), so free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not affecting this path.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body at (6,3) and (5,3), but when I move, it changes.\n\nIn the initial position, (5,3) is the tail, and (6,3) is body.\n\nBut when I move left to (3,1) on turn 15, the tail (5,3) is removed, so (6,3) becomes tail.\n\nThen when I move up to (3,2) on turn 16, (6,3) is removed, etc.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but only one food, positive.\n\nSo I think moving left to (3,1) on turn 15 is fine.\n\nThen the sequence: turn 15: L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nBut the answer should include actions for multiple turns, at least 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSo after eating, I need to plan for survival.\n\nAfter turn 17, snake at [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] head (2,2)\n\nNow turn 18, from (2,2), I need to move.\n\nPossible: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2)\n\nSay I go U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nThen positions: move to (2,3), no food, so new head (2,3), body [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] and tail (6,2) gone, so tail at (6,1).\n\nNow head at (2,3), direction up.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision, invalid, L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\nI can go U to (2,4) to explore top.\n\nTurn 19: from (2,4), can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3) occupied, L to (1,4), R to (3,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo avoid getting trapped, I should move towards the center or open area.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I could go R to (3,3) instead of U.\n\n(3,3) is free, I think.\n\nPositions have (3,2), (3,1), but not (3,3), so free.\n\nFrom (2,3) go R to (3,3) on turn 18.\n\nThen from (3,3) go U to (3,4) or R to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify too far; I need to output actions.\n\nSince the grid is small, and I need to survive, I should be careful not to box myself in.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), if I go left to (1,2), then I am at corner, which is dangerous.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), only up to (1,3) or down to (1,1), since left is wall, right to (2,2) body.\n\nSo better not to go left.\n\nSimilarly, down to (2,1) might be ok, but (2,1) is bottom row.\n\n(2,1) is y=1, not wall, but near bottom.\n\nUp to (2,3) is better, towards center.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 18, from (2,2) go U to (2,3)\n\nThen on turn 19, from (2,3) I can go U to (2,4) or R to (3,3)\n\nSay go R to (3,3) to go right.\n\nThen from (3,3) go U to (3,4) or R to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead from turn 15.\n\nTurn 15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nSo actions for turn 15 to 20.\n\nOn turn 15: move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move L to (2,2) eat\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,3)\n\nNow turn 19: from (2,3), after turn 18 move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail (6,1)? After turn 18 move to (2,3), no food, so new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and (6,1) since tail was (6,1) before? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 17: positions [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] head (2,2), tail (6,2)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,3), no food there, so new head (2,3), then body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) and tail (6,2) removed, so new tail (6,1).\n\nPositions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nHead at (2,3), direction up (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) occupied, invalid, L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\nNow, (3,3) is free, and going right might open space.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is left wall, might be risky.\n\n(2,4) up.\n\nTurn 19: say move R to (3,3)\n\nAfter move: head to (3,3), no food, so new positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) and tail (6,1) removed, so tail at (5,1).\n\nPositions: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nHead at (3,3), direction right (since moved right from (2,3) to (3,3)? From (2,3) to (3,3) is right.\n\nSo direction right.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, invalid, L to (2,3) occupied, invalid, R to (4,3)\n\nR to (4,3) is possible.\n\nU to (3,4) possible.\n\nD invalid, L invalid.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nTurn 20: say move R to (4,3)\n\nThen and so on.\n\nTo have a plan, I can say: after eating, move up and right to explore.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nSince the food is the only one, and I eat it on turn 17, for turns after, I just need to survive, so I can move in a way to avoid dead ends.\n\nIn this case, moving left on turn 15 seems ok.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving up on turn 15 is better.\n\nIf turn 15 move U to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 16 move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17 move L to (2,2) eat\n\nSame as before.\n\nAfter that, positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), etc.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nIn this case, the body has (4,2) which is near the obstacle (5,2), but (5,2) is blocked, so no issue.\n\nI think both are similar.\n\nBut in the first approach, when I move L to (3,1) on turn 15, the cell (4,2) is free, but I didn't go there.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid the area where the tail was.\n\nAnother thing: the food can spawn under body, but here food is at (2,2), not under body.\n\nIn this state, no food under body.\n\nSo I think moving left is fine.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 15 onwards.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, and the sequence to eat is 3 turns, then I need at least 2 more turns.\n\nSo let's define:\n\nTurn 15: L (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 16: U (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: L (to (2,2) eat)\n\nThen turn 18: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 19: R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 20: say U to (3,4) or R to (4,3)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nTo be consistent, let's assume we go to open area.\n\nAfter turn 19 at (3,3), we can go R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3) to (4,3)\n\nThen etc.\n\nBut for the box, I think output for 5 turns: turn 15 to 19 or 20.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action ...\" with \"...\" so I can do multiple.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll do 5 actions: turn 15 to 19.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nIn turn 19, from (2,3) to (3,3), which is right.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I want, I can include turn 20.\n\nBut I think 5 actions are enough.\n\nNow, but in turn 19, when I move R to (3,3), it should be fine.\n\nAnother consideration: the head direction for reverse.\n\nBut in the moves, it should be ok.\n\nFor example, turn 15 move L, so from turn 15 to 16, I move U, which is perpendicular, not reverse, fine.\n\nTurn 16 move U, turn 17 move L, perpendicular.\n\nTurn 17 move L, turn 18 move U, perpendicular.\n\nTurn 18 move U, turn 19 move R, which is perpendicular to up? From (2,3) moving right to (3,3), so direction change, not reverse.\n\nThen from (3,3), if I move R to (4,3), etc.\n\nNo instant reverse.\n\nAlso, no collision in the path.\n\nTherefore, this should be a safe plan to eat the food and start exploring.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: L Turn 16: U Turn 17: L Turn 18: U Turn 19: R }\n\nBut I should write it clearly.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 17, and I have actions beyond.\n\nPerhaps I can think if there is a reason to delay eating, but since it's positive food and no risk, better to eat early.\n\nLife span is 8, I eat on turn 17, with 6 left, fine.\n\nNo negative food or other risks.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 15):**\n- **Grid**: Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls). Internal obstacle at (5,2) blocks that cell.\n- **Snake**: \n  - Head at (4,1), direction left (L).\n  - Body segments: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) (tail).\n  - Length: 6 segments.\n- **Food**: \n  - One positive food at (2,2) with value +1 and life span 8 (will disappear after turn 22).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Cannot move opposite to current direction (no right move on turn 15).\n  - Possible moves from head (4,1): \n    - Up (U) to (4,2) – valid, empty.\n    - Down (D) to (4,0) – invalid (wall).\n    - Left (L) to (3,1) – valid, empty.\n    - Right (R) – invalid (reverse not allowed).\n- **Risks and Goals**:\n  - Eat positive food at (2,2) safely to increase score and length.\n  - Avoid collisions with walls, body, or obstacle at (5,2).\n  - Plan 5+ turns ahead for long-term survival after eating.\n\n**Path to Food and Survival Plan:**\n- **Food Path**: The food at (2,2) can be reached in 3 turns:\n  - Turn 15: Move left (L) to (3,1) – brings snake closer to food.\n  - Turn 16: Move up (U) to (3,2) – positions head adjacent to food.\n  - Turn 17: Move left (L) to (2,2) – eat food (value +1, length increases to 7).\n- **Why this path?**\n  - Shortest safe route: Manhattan distance from (4,1) to (2,2) is 3, and both moves are valid with no immediate collision risks.\n  - Life span: Food has 8 turns left on turn 15; eating on turn 17 uses only 3 turns, with 5 turns remaining (safe margin).\n  - No tail reward danger: Tail is far from (2,2) during eating (head not adjacent to tail).\n- **Post-Eating Survival (Turns 18-19)**:\n  - After eating, snake head at (2,2) with increased length (7 segments). Grid has 35 cells (36 - obstacle), snake occupies 7, leaving 28 free cells. To maximize survival:\n    - Avoid corners (e.g., (1,2) or (2,1)) to prevent trapping.\n    - Move towards open areas (e.g., up then right) to explore and create space for future moves.\n  - Turn 18: Move up (U) to (2,3) – moves away from bottom wall and towards center.\n  - Turn 19: Move right (R) to (3,3) – continues toward open grid area, avoiding left wall.\n- **5-Turn Lookahead Validation**:\n  - **Turn 15 (L to (3,1))**: \n    - New positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] (tail (5,3) removed). \n    - Valid: (3,1) empty, no wall or body collision. Direction now left.\n  - **Turn 16 (U to (3,2))**: \n    - New positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (tail (6,3) removed). \n    - Valid: (3,2) empty, no collision. Direction now up. Cannot move down (reverse) next.\n  - **Turn 17 (L to (2,2) eat food))**: \n    - Eat food: Value +1, length increases to 7.\n    - New positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (tail at (6,2)). \n    - Valid: (2,2) empty and food present. No collision or tail reward danger (tail at (6,2) not adjacent). Direction now left.\n  - **Turn 18 (U to (2,3))**: \n    - No food, so tail moves: new positions [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] (tail (6,2) removed). \n    - Valid: (2,3) empty, no collision. Direction now up. Cannot move down next.\n  - **Turn 19 (R to (3,3))**: \n    - New positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] (tail (6,1) removed). \n    - Valid: (3,3) empty, no collision. Direction now right. Opens path to center (e.g., can move up or right next).\n- **Long-Term Considerations**:\n  - By turn 19, snake is at (3,3) with good mobility (can move U to (3,4), R to (4,3), etc.).\n  - Future turns (beyond 19): Prioritize moving to open areas (e.g., (4,3) or (3,4)) to avoid dead ends. No food left, so focus on survival; if new food spawns, evaluate based on value and risk.\n  - Risk assessment: Grid is small (6x6), but current path minimizes trapping risk by steering clear of walls early.\n\n**Conclusion**: This sequence eats the food safely by turn 17 and ensures survival for 5+ turns by moving to less constrained areas. Actions are chosen to avoid reverses, collisions, and dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: L  \nTurn 16: U  \nTurn 17: L  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: R  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. The goal is to maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn 16:\n\n- Grid size: Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n- Snake positions: Head at (3,1), then body segments at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is moving left, since head direction is L, and positions go from (3,1) to (4,1) etc., which is decreasing x, so left is correct.\n\n- Head direction: L (left), so current movement is left.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth foods are positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer should be in a boxed format with actions from turn 16 onwards for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead,\" so I should plan at least 5 moves.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders and obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: Head (3,1), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the tail is at (6,3).\n\nSince head is at (3,1) and direction is L, last move was left to (3,1).\n\nPossible moves: I can go U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, reverse would be R (right), so I cannot move right on this turn because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nNo instant reverse means I cannot move in the opposite direction to the current one on the very next turn. So since I just moved left to (3,1), I cannot move right immediately; that would cause me to go back into my own body.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning the snake is facing left, so moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,1): U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, let's see the positions:\n\n- Up: (3,1) to (3,2)\n\n- Down: (3,1) to (3,0)\n\n- Left: (3,1) to (2,1)\n\n- Right: not allowed.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- Walls: y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right. So (3,0) is on the wall y=0, so down to (3,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is not a wall; y=2 is fine, x=3 fine. (2,1) is not wall; x=2, y=1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is not relevant for immediate moves.\n\nAlso, body collisions: Snake body segments are at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). None of these are at (3,2) or (2,1), so both U and L are possible without collision.\n\n(3,2) has food? Let's see food positions.\n\nFood at (2,2) and (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food! Value 1, life span 10.\n\n(2,2) has food, life span 7.\n\nSo from (3,1), if I move up to (3,2), I eat the food at (3,2).\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), I don't eat anything yet.\n\nBut moving to (3,2) might be tempting, but I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (6,3). Head is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to (6,3). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,1) to (6,3) is distance sqrt( (3-6)^2 + (1-3)^2 ) = sqrt(9+4) = sqrt(13) > 3, not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be like (3,1) and (3,2), (3,1) and (2,1), etc., but (6,3) is far away. So no issue with tail food danger now.\n\nFood at (3,2) is on the grid, and if I move to it, I eat it.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nLet me sketch the grid:\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake:\n\nHead: (3,1)\n\nBody: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo the snake is like: from (3,1) left to (4,1)? No: positions are listed head first: (3,1) is head, then (4,1) is next, which is right of head? x=4 > x=3, so if head is at (3,1) and next is (4,1), that means the snake was moving right to (3,1)? But head direction is given as L, which is left.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nHead direction is L, meaning the snake is facing left, so it came from the right. Positions: head at (3,1), then body at (4,1), which has higher x, so yes, it was moving left to (3,1), so previous head was at (4,1), moved left to (3,1).\n\nThen body: (4,1) is the segment behind head, then (5,1), then (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3). So the snake is going from (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1), then down to (6,2), then down to (6,3). So tail at (6,3).\n\nNow, food at (2,2) and (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is directly above head (3,1).\n\n(2,2) is up and left.\n\nLife spans: (2,2) has life 7, (3,2) has life 10. Since current turn is 16, food disappears after N turns, so (2,2) will disappear after turn 16 + 7 = 23? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife span is given, and it decreases each turn. So at turn 16, life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 more turns, so at the start of turn 16+7=23 or end? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, when food is present, life_span is given, and each turn it decreases by one. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor food at (2,2): life_span=7 at turn 16. So after turn 16, it decreases to 6, then turn 17 to 5, ..., down to 0 at turn 16+7=23? Let's see: at turn 16, life_span=7. After turn 16 is processed, before turn 17, it decreases? The countdown decreases every turn including current, but it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nI think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L. During the turn, if snake moves to it, it's eaten. After the turn, life_span decreases by one. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nAssume that at turn t, with life_span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, during turn t, if head moves to it, it's eaten before life decreases.\n\nFor (2,2) at turn 16, life_span=7. After turn 16, it becomes 6, and so on, until turn 16+7-1? Let's not overcomplicate; I can just track the remaining life.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2), life_span=10 at turn 16.\n\nNow, back to possible moves at turn 16:\n\nFrom (3,1), head:\n\n- Move U to (3,2): eats food at (3,2), since food is there. Then snake grows, so new head at (3,2), and tail stays, so body becomes [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] but with new head, so positions: after eating, head moves to (3,2), and since it ate, length increases, so the tail doesn't move; new segment added at head position after move? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new tail segment is added, but the tail doesn't move that turn? No.\n\nIn snake, when you move, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves forward one cell, so length remains unless you eat food. If you eat food, the head moves to food, the tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n\nHere: if I move to (3,2) and eat, head is at (3,2), and the body segments remain, but since tail didn't move, a new segment is added where the head was? Let's think.\n\nPositions: current snake: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] so 6 segments.\n\nAfter moving up to (3,2) and eating: head moves to (3,2), and since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the new positions should be: head at (3,2), then the previous head (3,1) becomes part of body, so body is [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] but now we have an extra segment because tail didn't move? No.\n\nStandard: before move, positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail position is vacated.\n\nWith eating: head moves to new position (food), each body segment moves to next, but tail stays, so new tail is added at the end.\n\nSo after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,2) and eating: new head at (3,2), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,1), then (4,1) to (4,1)? Let's list the positions.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving up to (3,2): head moves to (3,2). Since food is eaten, tail does not move, so the body segments shift: segment 1 (4,1) moves to (3,1) (previous head position), segment 2 (5,1) moves to (4,1), segment 3 (6,1) moves to (5,1), segment 4 (6,2) moves to (6,1)? No.\n\nThe movement: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 1 (which was at (4,1)) moves to where segment 0 was, (3,1)\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (5,1)) moves to where segment 1 was, (4,1)\n\n- Segment 3 (was at (6,1)) moves to where segment 2 was, (5,1)\n\n- Segment 4 (was at (6,2)) moves to where segment 3 was, (6,1)\n\n- Segment 5 (was at (6,3)) moves to where segment 4 was, (6,2)\n\nBut segment 4 was at (6,2), so segment 5 moves to (6,2)? And since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail end, but tail didn't move, so the last position (6,3) is still occupied? I'm confusing myself.\n\nBetter: when snake eats, after moving, the tail remains, so the new positions are: new head at (3,2), then the old positions of segments 0 to 4 become the new body, but shifted.\n\nSegments after move:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Body segment 1: old position of head, (3,1)\n\n- Body segment 2: old position of seg1, (4,1)\n\n- Body segment 3: old position of seg2, (5,1)\n\n- Body segment 4: old position of seg3, (6,1)\n\n- Body segment 5: old position of seg4, (6,2)\n\n- And since we ate, we add a new segment at the old position of tail, which is (6,3), so new tail at (6,3)\n\nSo new snake: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] so 7 segments.\n\nSimilarly, if no eat, tail moves off.\n\nBut in this case, if I move to (3,2) and eat, snake grows to 7, with head at (3,2), direction now U.\n\nIf I don't eat, say move left to (2,1), no food there, so head to (2,1), body: seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (4,1), etc., tail to (6,2), and (6,3) vacated.\n\nBut (2,1) has no food.\n\nNow, back to turn 16 choices:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,2) - eat food, grow, head now at (3,2), direction U.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (2,1) - no eat, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (3,0) - but (3,0) is wall, invalid, die.\n\nSo only U or L are valid, with U eating food.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nIf I eat at (3,2), I get +1, but then I'm at (3,2), which is near the top? y=2, grid y=0 to 7, so y=2 is row 3 from bottom? y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so (3,2) is above.\n\nFrom there, I can move U, D, L, R, but direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) next turn, since reverse.\n\nAfter moving U, head direction is U, so next turn cannot move D.\n\nNow, food at (2,2) is still there, life span 7.\n\nAlso, after moving to (3,2), the snake body is at (3,1), (4,1), etc.\n\nNow, from (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,3)\n\n- D to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body segment, collision, invalid.\n\n- L to (2,2) which has food\n\n- R to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is empty? No body or wall? Walls at borders, x=4 y=2 not border, no obstacle, and body: positions are (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so (4,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has food, (3,3) free.\n\nSo from (3,2), if I move L to (2,2), I eat the food there, grow again.\n\nIf I move U to (3,3) or R to (4,2), no eat.\n\nBut if I move L to (2,2), I eat, then head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, L, R, but direction L, cannot R next.\n\nNow, after eating both foods, I have a longer snake, but I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nCurrently, with the snake as is, the area around (3,1) is a bit constrained.\n\nLet me think about the grid and possible paths.\n\nFirst, the obstacle at (5,2) blocks that cell.\n\nAlso, the snake occupies (3,1) to (6,1) horizontally, then down to (6,3).\n\nSo the left side is more open.\n\nFood at (2,2) and (3,2) are both available soon.\n\nBut if I eat (3,2) now, I can then go to (2,2) easily.\n\nBut let's see the tail position. Tail at (6,3), which will move when I don't eat, freeing space.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat immediately, to keep options open or something.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,3), and if I move away, it will move, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat at turn 16, move left to (2,1), then head at (2,1), no eat.\n\nThen body: seg1 to (3,1), etc., tail to (6,2), so (6,3) freed.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2) to eat the food there, or L to (1,1), or D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, or R to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body, collision.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail at (6,2) since no eat, tail moved from (6,3) to (6,2)? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn 16: if I move L to (2,1), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,1)\n\nThen body seg1 (was at (4,1)) moves to (3,1) (previous head)\n\nSeg2 (was at (5,1)) to (4,1)\n\nSeg3 (was at (6,1)) to (5,1)\n\nSeg4 (was at (6,2)) to (6,1)\n\nSeg5 (was at (6,3)) to (6,2)  // tail moves to (6,2), and (6,3) freed.\n\nSo snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nHead at (2,1), direction L.\n\nNow, at turn 17, from (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,2): has food, eat\n\n- D to (2,0): wall, invalid\n\n- L to (1,1): possible, no wall, no body? Body at (3,1), (4,1), etc., (1,1) free.\n\n- R to (3,1): but (3,1) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo can go U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nIf go U, eat food at (2,2), grow, head at (2,2), then body etc.\n\nIf go L to (1,1), no eat.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 16 I move U to (3,2), eat, then at (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) to eat the other food.\n\nBut if I eat both quickly, I grow fast, but might be near the wall or body.\n\nAfter eating both, snake longer, and I'm at (2,2) or something.\n\nLet's simulate both scenarios.\n\nFirst, option A: at turn 16, move U to (3,2), eat food. Score +1.\n\nNew snake: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // 7 segments\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2), move L to (2,2), eat food at (2,2), score another +1.\n\nNew head (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) but after move: head to (2,2), then body seg1 to (3,2) (prev head), seg2 to (3,1) (prev seg1), seg3 to (4,1) (prev seg2), seg4 to (5,1) (prev seg3), seg5 to (6,1) (prev seg4), seg6 to (6,2) (prev seg5), and since eat, add new segment at prev tail (6,3), so new tail at (6,3).\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // 8 segments.\n\nHead at (2,2), direction L.\n\nNow, from here, possible moves turn 18:\n\nFrom (2,2), direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R but not R (reverse).\n\n- U to (2,3)\n\n- D to (2,1): but (2,1) is body? Current positions: (2,2) head, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), etc. (2,1) is not occupied; (3,1) is at y=1, x=3, not (2,1). (2,1) is free? Let's see: body segments: after above, positions are (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (2,1) is empty.\n\n- L to (1,2)\n\n- R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\nNow, no food around, so no eat.\n\nSay I move U to (2,3) for example.\n\nThen head to (2,3), no eat, so body shifts: seg1 to (2,2) (prev head), seg2 to (3,2) (prev seg1), seg3 to (3,1) (prev seg2), seg4 to (4,1) (prev seg3), seg5 to (5,1) (prev seg4), seg6 to (6,1) (prev seg5), seg7 to (6,2) (prev seg6), tail was (6,3), moves to (6,2)? Prev seg6 was (6,2), so seg7 moves to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied? No.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,3)\n\nThen seg1 (was at (3,2)) moves to (2,2)\n\nSeg2 (was at (3,1)) moves to (3,2)\n\nSeg3 (was at (4,1)) moves to (3,1)\n\nSeg4 (was at (5,1)) moves to (4,1)\n\nSeg5 (was at (6,1)) moves to (5,1)\n\nSeg6 (was at (6,2)) moves to (6,1)\n\nSeg7 (was at (6,3)) moves to (6,2)\n\nAnd (6,3) freed.\n\nSnake now: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nHead at (2,3), direction U.\n\nAnd so on. But I'm going up, and the grid has space, but the bottom and left are walls.\n\nNow, the other option: at turn 16, I move L to (2,1), no eat.\n\nThen at turn 17, I can move U to (2,2) to eat, or L to (1,1).\n\nIf I eat at (2,2) at turn 17, similar to above but one turn later.\n\nBut in option A, I ate both foods by turn 17, score 2.\n\nIn this, if I move to (2,1) at 16, then to (2,2) at 17, I eat one food, then from (2,2) I can go to (3,2) but (3,2) has food but it was there, but after turn 16, life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 16, if I don't eat (3,2), after turn 16, life span of (3,2) decreases to 9, still there.\n\nBut in the move to (2,1) at 16, I didn't eat (3,2), so it's still there.\n\nThen at turn 17, from (2,1), if I move U to (2,2), eat (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), body: from previous, after turn 16 move to (2,1): snake [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nAfter eating at (2,2): head to (2,2), body seg1 to (2,1) (prev head), seg2 to (3,1) (prev seg1), seg3 to (4,1) (prev seg2), seg4 to (5,1) (prev seg3), seg5 to (6,1) (prev seg4), and add new segment at prev tail (6,2), so tail at (6,2).\n\nSnake: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]  // 7 segments\n\nNow, from (2,2), direction U, can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, L to (1,2), R to (3,2) which has food.\n\n(3,2) has food, so I can move R to (3,2) to eat it.\n\nThen eat another food at turn 18.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat both foods by turn 18 or so.\n\nBut in first option, I ate at 16 and 17, score 2 by turn 17.\n\nIn second, ate at 17 and 18, score 2 by turn 18.\n\nBut since life span is long, 7 and 10, not urgent.\n\nBut there might be a risk in eating immediately.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is under the body? No, at turn 16, snake positions are (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so (3,2) is not occupied, it's free with food.\n\nSimilarly (2,2) free.\n\nBut the rule says food can spawn under body, but here it's not under body.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's think about the future.\n\nThe snake is currently occupying the bottom row from x=3 to 6, and then up to (6,3).\n\nThe left side is open, from x=0 to 2, y=1 to 7, except walls.\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (5,2) is blocked, but not relevant now.\n\nIf I eat both foods quickly, I'm at (2,2) with a long snake, and I can move up or left.\n\nBut the tail is at (6,2) or something, which will take time to move, so the right side is blocked.\n\nFor example, in the state after eating both, snake is around (2,2) to (6,2), with body in between.\n\nThen moving up might be good, to open space.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (3,2) immediately, because it might be better to go left first and eat (2,2), then come back for (3,2) later, but (3,2) has longer life, 10 vs 7 for (2,2).\n\n(2,2) life 7, so it will disappear at turn 16+7=23, but countdown: at turn 16, life 7, after turn 16, life 6, ..., after turn 22, life 0, disappears before turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life 10, disappears after turn 25.\n\nSo (2,2) has shorter life, only 7 turns left, so I should eat it soon.\n\nAt turn 16, (2,2) has 7 turns, (3,2) has 10.\n\nSo (2,2) is more urgent to eat.\n\nIf I don't eat it by turn 22, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) by turn 25.\n\nBut I can eat both.\n\nBut let's see the path to (2,2).\n\nFrom current position, to eat (2,2), I can go directly, but from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1), then U to (2,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is on the way or not.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1) at turn 16, then U to (2,2) at turn 17, I eat (2,2) at 17.\n\nThen from there, I can move R to (3,2) to eat (3,2) at turn 18, for example.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2) at 16, I eat it, then L to (2,2) at 17, eat it.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut when I eat (3,2) at 16, I'm at (3,2), then to go to (2,2), I move left, which is fine.\n\nBut after eating both, I'm at (2,2), with the body blocking the bottom.\n\nThen I need to move to open areas.\n\nThe top-left is free, y=3 to 7, x=0 to 2.\n\nAlso, the right side has the tail, which will move as I don't eat.\n\nBut since I ate, the tail doesn't move immediately.\n\nIn the first few moves, it might be better to eat the food with shorter life first, which is (2,2).\n\nBut to eat (2,2), from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) then U to (2,2), or U to (3,2) then L to (2,2), but both ways I eat (2,2) at turn 17 or later.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1) at 16, then U to (2,2) at 17, I eat (2,2) at 17.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2) at 16, I eat (3,2) at 16, then L to (2,2) at 17, eat (2,2) at 17.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat (2,2) at turn 17.\n\nBut in the first, I ate (3,2) at 16, in the second, I didn't eat at 16, ate at 17.\n\nBut (2,2) is eaten at 17 in both.\n\nIn the first option, I have an extra point at turn 16.\n\nBut no big difference.\n\nHowever, there is a potential danger with the food at (3,2).\n\nNotice that at (3,2), if I eat it, I'm on that cell, but the body is below at (3,1), so from (3,2), I can move up, left, right, but not down.\n\nBut down is body, so not possible anyway.\n\nBut the key point is the tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2) might affect movement later.\n\nBut for now, it's not in the way.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating one of the foods to keep the snake shorter for maneuvering, but since both are positive, eating is good, and life span is long, but (2,2) has shorter life, so better to eat it.\n\nBut I can eat both.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nSuppose at turn 16, I move L to (2,1), no eat.\n\nThen turn 17, move U to (2,2), eat (2,2), score +1.\n\nNew snake: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // 7 segments, since ate, tail at (6,2) added? After eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,2), body seg1 to (2,1) (prev head), seg2 to (3,1) (prev seg1), etc., up to seg6 to (6,1) (prev seg5), and new tail at prev tail position (6,2)? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 16 move L to (2,1): snake [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]  // tail at (6,2)\n\nAt turn 17, move U to (2,2), eat food there.\n\nNew head (2,2)\n\nThen body: seg1 (was at (3,1)) moves to (2,1) (prev head position)\n\nSeg2 (was at (4,1)) moves to (3,1) (prev seg1)\n\nSeg3 (was at (5,1)) moves to (4,1) (prev seg2)\n\nSeg4 (was at (6,1)) moves to (5,1) (prev seg3)\n\nSeg5 (was at (6,2)) moves to (6,1) (prev seg4)\n\nAnd since ate, new segment added at prev tail position, which was (6,2), so new tail at (6,2)\n\nBut seg5 moved to (6,1), so new tail at (6,2), but (6,2) was occupied by seg5, but seg5 moved, so it's free, then add new tail.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // 7 segments, head at (2,2), tail at (6,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, food at (3,2) is still there, life span decreased to 9 at turn 17? At turn 17, before move, life span of (3,2) was 10 at turn 16, after turn 16, life span decreases to 9, so at turn 17, it's 9.\n\nI can move to (3,2) from (2,2) by moving R.\n\nMove R to (3,2), eat, score +1.\n\nNew head (3,2), body seg1 to (2,2) (prev head), seg2 to (2,1) (prev seg1), seg3 to (3,1) (prev seg2), etc.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and new tail at (6,2)? Prev tail was (6,2), so add new segment there.\n\nSnake: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]  // 8 segments\n\nHead at (3,2), direction R.\n\nNow, from here, I can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, collision, L to (2,2) body, R to (4,2).\n\nSo only U or R possible.\n\nSay move U to (3,3).\n\nThen no eat, body shifts, tail moves from (6,2) to (6,1) or something, freeing space.\n\nThen I can explore the top.\n\nBut the bottom is blocked by body.\n\nIf I had eaten both early, similar situation.\n\nBut in this case, by moving L first, I ate (2,2) first, which has shorter life.\n\nAt turn 16, if I move U to (3,2), I eat (3,2) which has longer life, and (2,2) still has 7 turns, I can eat it next turn.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason to delay eating (3,2).\n\nFor example, if I don't eat it now, the cell (3,2) is free, and I can use it later.\n\nBut since it has food, I need to eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nAnother point: the snake is near the left wall, and after eating, I'm at (2,2), which is cornered if I'm not careful.\n\n(2,2) is not corner, I can go up or left.\n\nx=2,y=2, can go to (2,3), (1,2), or (3,2) if possible.\n\nBut after eating both, body below, so from (2,2), I can go U or L, not D or R if body.\n\nIn the state after eating both at (2,2), I can go U or L.\n\nSimilarly at (3,2).\n\nBut let's consider the tail position.\n\nTail is at (6,2) or (6,3), which will move when I don't eat, freeing the bottom-right area.\n\nSo if I move up, I can let the tail catch up, freeing space.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) after eating, I can move U to (2,3), then to (2,4), etc., and the body will follow, tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nSimilarly, I can go left to (1,2), (1,1), etc.\n\nThe grid has space on the top and left.\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (5,2) is there, but not blocking immediately.\n\nI think eating both is fine, and I can do it in two turns.\n\nBut at turn 16, moving L to (2,1) or U to (3,2) both lead to eating both soon.\n\nBut moving U to (3,2) at 16 gives me an immediate point, and I can then move to (2,2).\n\nMoving L to (2,1) delays eating, but I eat (2,2) first.\n\nSince (2,2) has shorter life, it might be better to prioritize it.\n\nAt turn 16, both are available, and I can eat (2,2) at turn 17 in both cases.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2) at 16, I eat (3,2), then at turn 17 I move L to (2,2) to eat (2,2).\n\nIf I move L to (2,1) at 16, no eat, then at 17 move U to (2,2) to eat (2,2), then at 18 move R to (3,2) to eat (3,2).\n\nSo the first way, I have one more point by turn 17.\n\nAnd I eat (2,2) at the same turn 17 in both, but in first, I also have (3,2) eaten at 16.\n\nIn first scenario, at turn 17, I eat (2,2), so score 2 by turn 17.\n\nIn second, at turn 17, I eat (2,2), score 1, then at turn 18 eat (3,2), score 2.\n\nSo better to eat (3,2) at 16 if possible.\n\nMoreover, no risk in doing so.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nIf I move to (3,2) at turn 16, I'm on (3,2), then to (2,2) at 17.\n\nThe only potential issue is if (3,2) is under body, but it's not, it's free.\n\nOr tail danger, but not.\n\nSo I think moving U to (3,2) at turn 16 is good.\n\nThen at turn 17, move L to (2,2) to eat the other food.\n\nThen at turn 18, from (2,2), I need to move, say U or L.\n\nFor long-term, I should head to open space.\n\nFor example, move U to (2,3) at turn 18.\n\nThen to (2,4), etc.\n\nOr left to (1,2), then down to (1,1), but (1,1) is near wall.\n\nBut let's plan 5 turns.\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2), eat food, score +1.\n\nNew snake: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // 7 segments, direction U.\n\nTurn 17: move L to (2,2), eat food at (2,2), score +1.\n\nNew snake: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // 8 segments, direction L.\n\nNow turn 18: from (2,2), direction L, can move U, D, L, R but not R.\n\n- U to (2,3)\n\n- D to (2,1): is it free? Positions: body has (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), etc., (2,1) not occupied, free.\n\n- L to (1,2)\n\n- R to (3,2) body, invalid.\n\nSo possible U, D, or L.\n\nD to (2,1): (2,1) is free, but y=1, not wall.\n\nIf I move D to (2,1), no food, so head to (2,1), body shifts, tail moves from (6,3) to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut then I'm at (2,1), which is near wall, and body above, so I might get stuck.\n\nBetter to move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2) to open space.\n\nSay move U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nThen head to (2,3), no eat, body: seg1 to (2,2), seg2 to (3,2), seg3 to (3,1), etc., tail to (6,2), (6,3) freed.\n\nSnake: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] direction U.\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3), direction U, can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2) body, invalid, L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\nSay move U to (2,4) to continue up.\n\nThen similar.\n\nOr move R to (3,3) to go right.\n\nBut (3,3) is free.\n\nNow, the tail is at (6,2), which will move as I go up.\n\nEventually, I can go to the top rows.\n\nSimilarly, I could go left first.\n\nBut going up seems fine.\n\nTo be specific, let's define actions for 5 turns.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 16 onwards.\n\nSo for turn 16: move U\n\nTurn 17: move L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 18: move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 19: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (2,5)\n\nBut at (2,5), y=5, and so on.\n\nBut I need to think about the grid size, y=7 is wall, so at y=6, I need to turn.\n\nBut for now, it's ok.\n\nSince the head direction changes, I need to specify the action based on current direction.\n\nIn turn 18, from (2,2) direction L, I move U, so new direction U.\n\nThen turn 19 from (2,3) direction U, move U, ok.\n\nIf I move to (2,4), direction U.\n\nThen at (2,4), I can move U to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut after some moves, the body might be in the way, but since I'm going up, the body is below, so it should be ok.\n\nTo avoid being trapped, I should not go into dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,2) at turn 18, then to (1,3), etc., left column might be riskier if I go down.\n\nBut up is better.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2) might affect if I go right, but not now.\n\nSo I think moving U at turn 18 is good.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nBut I need to output for multiple turns, at least 5, but the format says to list actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions from turn 16 onwards for the number of turns I plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for 5 turns or more.\n\nLet's do 5 turns: turns 16 to 20.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: U (to eat (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: L (to eat (2,2))\n\nThen at turn 18, from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3) direction U, move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: from (2,4) direction U, move U to (2,5)\n\nAt (2,5), I can continue or turn, but for now, it's fine.\n\nAt turn 20, y=5, wall at y=7, so I can go to (2,6), (2,7) but (2,7) is wall, so at (2,6), I need to turn left or right.\n\nBut that's beyond 5 turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could turn earlier.\n\nBut for simplicity, this should work.\n\nIf at turn 18 I move L to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc., but left might be tighter.\n\nGoing up is safer.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any risk in eating at turn 16 and 17?\n\nFor example, when I eat at (3,2) at turn 16, the head is at (3,2), and the body is at (3,1), which is below, but not adjacent in a way that causes issue.\n\nAnd tail is far.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2).\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer, but I have space to move up.\n\nThe life span: (2,2) is eaten at turn 17, before it disappears, life span 7 at turn 16, so at turn 17 it has life 6, still there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut for turn 18,19,20, I assumed moving up, but after turn 17, I'm at (2,2), direction L, then moving U is changing direction.\n\nNo issue.\n\nTo write in answer format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating the food with the shorter remaining life span first (as it is more urgent) and avoiding potential collisions. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current state (Turn 16)**: Snake head at (3,1) with direction L. Food at (2,2) with life span 7 (disappears after turn 22) and (3,2) with life span 10 (disappears after turn 25). Both are positive food (+1 score each).\n- **Immediate moves**: From (3,1), moving U to (3,2) eats the food there for +1 and grows the snake. Moving L to (2,1) avoids eating but positions the snake to eat (2,2) next turn. Moving D is invalid (wall at (3,0)), and moving R is invalid (reverse direction not allowed).\n- **Risk assessment**: Eating (3,2) at turn 16 is safe as (3,2) is not under the body and no tail reward danger (tail at (6,3) is not adjacent). Eating (2,2) at turn 17 is also safe and prioritizes the shorter-lived food. After eating both, moving upward opens space for long-term survival by avoiding the body-packed bottom rows and leveraging the open top-left area.\n- **5-turn plan**: \n  - **Turns 16-17**: Eat both foods quickly to secure +2 score. At turn 16, move U to eat (3,2). At turn 17, move L to eat (2,2).\n  - **Turns 18-20**: Move upward (U) to open space and avoid potential traps. The top-left area (y=3-7, x=0-2) is clear, and moving U allows the tail to move and free cells over time. After turn 17, the head direction is L, so moving U is allowed and not a reverse. Continuing U through turn 20 is safe as the body shifts downward, freeing space. If needed, turns beyond 20 can adjust (e.g., turn left at (2,6) to avoid y=7 wall).\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 16 to 20)**:\n- Turn 16: Move U (to (3,2), eat food, score +1, head direction now U).\n- Turn 17: Move L (to (2,2), eat food, score +1, head direction now L).\n- Turn 18: Move U (to (2,3), no food, head direction now U).\n- Turn 19: Move U (to (2,4), no food, head direction now U).\n- Turn 20: Move U (to (2,5), no food, head direction now U).\n\nThis plan ensures both foods are eaten before they expire, scores 2 points by turn 17, and positions the snake for long-term survival by moving toward open space. Beyond turn 20, the snake can continue upward (e.g., to (2,6)) and then turn left or right as needed to avoid walls.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U}\n}",

        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 17, and I'm playing Snake. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), then body segments at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to (3,2) from (3,1).\n\nFood: there's one food at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 6. That means it will disappear after 6 turns, including the current turn, so it has 5 more turns after this one before it vanishes.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,2). From the positions, the snake just moved up to (3,2), so previous head was at (3,1), and it moved up.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because that would be an instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so I cannot move Down next. So possible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see what each move does:\n\n- If I move Up (U): head goes to (3,3). Is that safe? Check collisions.\n\nWalls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,3) is within bounds, no wall there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\nBody collision: snake positions are [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]. After moving, the head moves to (3,3), and the body shifts: the tail (6,3) will move away, but we need to see if (3,3) is occupied by body after move.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nSince no food is eaten in this move (unless we move to food, but food is at (2,2), not (3,3)), so no growth. So after move:\n\n- Head moves to (3,3)\n\n- Segment 1 (was at (3,1)) moves to where head was, (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (4,1)) moves to (3,1)\n\n- Segment 3 (was at (5,1)) moves to (4,1)\n\n- Segment 4 (was at (6,1)) moves to (5,1)\n\n- Segment 5 (was at (6,2)) moves to (6,1)\n\n- Segment 6 (was at (6,3)) moves to (6,2)\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nIs (3,3) occupied? In new positions, (3,3) is head, (3,2) is body, but head is at (3,3), which is not occupied by body before move? Before move, positions include (3,2) which is head, but after move, head is at (3,3), and (3,2) is now a body segment. But (3,3) was not occupied before, so no collision.\n\nAlso, no walls, so moving Up to (3,3) is safe.\n\nNow, Left (L): head to (2,2). But (2,2) has food! Food at (2,2) with value 1.\n\nIf I move left to (2,2), I eat the food.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe to eat. First, is moving to (2,2) possible?\n\n(2,2) is within grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (2,2) is valid.\n\nNo wall at (2,2), walls are borders and (5,2).\n\nBody collision: before move, positions are (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), etc. (2,2) is not in the list, so not occupied. After move, head at (2,2), and since I eat food, the snake grows: new head at (2,2), body: (3,2) becomes new segment 1, then (3,1), (4,1), etc., and tail stays, so new length 8.\n\nPositions after move: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(2,2) was not occupied, so no collision.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,3). Head moving to (2,2), which is not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(2,2) and (6,3) are not adjacent; distance is large. Head is at (3,2) now, moving to (2,2), tail is at (6,3), which is not adjacent. After move, tail is still at (6,3) in new positions? No.\n\nAfter move with growth: head to (2,2), then the previous head (3,2) becomes body, so segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — tail is (6,3).\n\nHead at (2,2), tail at (6,3), not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nBut is there food at tail? The food is at (2,2), which I'm eating, not at tail. Tail is (6,3), no food there. So Tail Reward Danger doesn't apply here.\n\nSo moving Left to (2,2) eats the food, score +1, length increases.\n\nNow, Right (R): head to (4,2). (4,2) is within grid? x=4, y=2.\n\nCheck if occupied: positions have (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), etc. (4,2) not in list, so empty.\n\nAfter move: no food, so head to (4,2), body: (3,2) to where head was? Standard move: head to new position, each body segment to previous position.\n\nSo positions after: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — since tail (6,3) moves to (6,2), but no growth, so tail is removed? No.\n\nSnake positions: before move, segments: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move right to (4,2), no food eaten:\n\n- Head moves to (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1 moves to previous head position (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,1)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (4,1)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (5,1)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to previous segment 4 position (6,1)\n\n- Segment 6 moves to previous segment 5 position (6,2)\n\nNew positions: (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTail was (6,3), but after move, it's gone, and new tail is (6,2).\n\n(4,2) not occupied before, so safe.\n\nNow, also, Down is not possible because instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nL eats food immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Food has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns from when it spawned, but it says \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nCurrent turn is 17, food has life span 6, so it will disappear on turn 17 + 6 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 17, life span is 6, after this turn, it becomes 5, then 4, etc., until 0, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0? Or after N turns?\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think \"after N turns\" means it exists for N turns, including the current one, so it will be gone after the (current + N - 1)th turn? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose spawned at turn T with life span N. At turn T, countdown = N, after turn T, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn T + (N-1), countdown =1, after that turn, countdown=0, and it disappears. So it is present from turn T to turn T + (N-1), inclusive.\n\nFor this food: at turn 17, life span is 6, so it was spawned at some turn. We don't know when, but current life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including current, so it will disappear after turn 17 + 5 = 22? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 17, countdown is 6, so it decreases to 5 after turn 17, so after turn 17, countdown=5, meaning 5 turns left. After turn 18, countdown=4, ..., after turn 22, countdown=0, and it disappears before turn 23. So it is available from turn 17 to turn 22 inclusive? Countdown at start of turn:\n\n- Turn 17: countdown =6, present\n\n- After turn 17, countdown=5\n\n- Turn 18: countdown=5, present\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 22: countdown=1, present\n\n- After turn 22, countdown=0, disappears, so not present on turn 23.\n\nSo food is present for turns 17,18,19,20,21,22. Six turns.\n\nBut since we act on turn, we can eat it on any of these turns.\n\nNow, back to decision. I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, what are the immediate options.\n\nIf I move Left (L) to (2,2), I eat the food, score +1, snake grows to length 8. New head position (2,2).\n\nThen the snake body is longer, which might be good or bad for future.\n\nBut I need to consider survival.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can eat later, but the food might expire, or I might have other opportunities, but currently only one food.\n\nAlso, after eating, the tail might create space, but here tail is at (6,3), far away.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid and possible paths.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo the bottom row y=1 has many segments: from x=3 to6, y=1, and (6,2),(6,3).\n\nAlso, (3,2) head.\n\nAvailable spaces: for example, (2,2) has food, (4,2) is free, (3,3) free, etc.\n\nSince head is at (3,2) facing Up, if I move Up to (3,3), then from there I can go to other places.\n\nIf I move Right to (4,2), then I can go up, down, left, right, but not left since that would be reverse? Head direction changes.\n\nAfter moving, the new head direction is set to the move direction.\n\nIf I move U from (3,2) to (3,3), new head direction Up.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move U, L, R, not D (reverse).\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,2), new head direction Left.\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), new head direction Right.\n\nNow, let's think long-term. I need to survive and eat more food.\n\nBut currently only one food, so I should probably eat it before it expires.\n\nIt has until turn 22, so I have time.\n\nBut eating it now gives me +1 and I can look for more food, but no other food mentioned, so I assume only this one for now.\n\nThe state says \"Food Positions\", and only one listed, so only this food.\n\nBut new food might spawn later? The problem doesn't specify food spawning rules. It only gives current food.\n\nIn the input, it provides the current food, so for planning, I only know this food.\n\nSo I should eat this food within its life span.\n\nIf I eat it now, I get +1, but I might be in a position where I can't reach other areas easily.\n\nIf I delay, I can eat it later, but I need to make sure I can reach it.\n\nAlso, the snake body might block paths.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: head (3,2), body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo positions:\n\n- Row y=0: walls\n\n- Row y=1: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — so cells (0,1) to (2,1) free, (7,1) wall? x=7 is wall, so (7,1) not accessible.\n\nAccessible cells: x from 1 to 6? Borders are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 is wall, so x=0 not accessible, x=1 to 6 are free except obstacles, x=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly y=0 wall, y=1 to 6 free, y=7 wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake:\n\nAt y=1: x=3,4,5,6 occupied by body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(6,1) is body, but (6,1) is at x=6,y=1.\n\nAlso (6,2) and (6,3) at y=2 and y=3.\n\nHead at (3,2).\n\nFood at (2,2).\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2) has food, (3,2) head, (4,2) free, (5,2) obstacle, (6,2) body, (7,2) wall.\n\ny=2: x=1: free? (1,2) not occupied, x=2: food, x=3: head, x=4: free, x=5: obstacle, x=6: body (6,2), x=7: wall.\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) body, (7,3) wall. But (6,3) is tail, which might move.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 to y=6 are mostly free, except borders.\n\nAlso y=1, x=1 and x=2 free, since (1,1) and (2,1) not occupied.\n\n(0,1) wall, (1,1) free, (2,1) free, (3,1) body, etc.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nIf I move Left to (2,2), eat food, new head (2,2), direction Left.\n\nThen snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — length 8.\n\nFrom there, I can move Up, Down, or Right (since direction Left, cannot move Right? New direction Left, so opposite is Right, so cannot move Right immediately? Rule: \"no instant reverse\" on next turn.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2) with direction Left, on next turn (turn 18), I can move Up, Down, or Left, but not Right (opposite).\n\nPossible moves from (2,2):\n\n- Up: to (2,3)\n\n- Down: to (2,1)\n\n- Left: to (1,2)\n\nCannot Right to (3,2) because it's occupied by body immediately after, but (3,2) is the first body segment, so if I move right, head to (3,2), but (3,2) is now occupied by body, so collision.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), etc.\n\nIf I move Right to (3,2), that's where the body is, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nSo indeed, cannot move Right from (2,2) because (3,2) is body.\n\nSimilarly, moving Left to (1,2) might be possible, or Up to (2,3), or Down to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is free? Before move, (2,1) was free, and after move, since we grew, the body is at (3,2), (3,1), etc., (2,1) should be free.\n\nAfter move to (2,2) with growth, positions: (2,2) head, (3,2) body, (3,1) body, (4,1) body, (5,1) body, (6,1) body, (6,2) body, (6,3) body.\n\nSo (2,1) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) free, (2,3) free.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\nR to (3,2) impossible, collision.\n\nIf I move Up to (3,3) from current position.\n\nTurn 17, move U to (3,3), no food, so positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail moved to (6,2), since (6,3) gone.\n\nNew positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nFrom (3,3), head direction Up, so can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\nAll should be free.\n\n(3,4) free, (2,3) free, (4,3) free.\n\nFood still at (2,2) with life span decreasing.\n\nIf I move Right to (4,2) from current.\n\nMove R to (4,2), no food, positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nFrom (4,2), head direction Right, so can move U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\nU to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) is body segment now? After move, positions: head (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo (4,1) is occupied by body, so if I move down to (4,1), collision.\n\nR to (5,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nU to (4,3) should be free.\n\nSo from (4,2), only possible moves: U to (4,3) or maybe L, but direction is Right, opposite is Left, so cannot move Left to (3,2) because (3,2) is body.\n\nMoving Left to (3,2) would be collision anyway.\n\nSo only U to (4,3) is possible from (4,2)? D and R not possible, L not possible, so only U.\n\nBut U to (4,3) is valid.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut now, let's think about the food at (2,2).\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, from current position (3,2), if I move U to (3,3), then I can go to (2,3) or (3,4), etc.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) to eat food, but I need to make sure the body is not blocking.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (4,2), then I can only go up to (4,3), and it might be harder to reach (2,2) because the snake is on the right side.\n\nLet's consider the area around (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has food, and it's adjacent to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is head now, but after moves, it will be body.\n\nTo eat the food, I need to move the head to (2,2) when it's free and food is present.\n\nCurrently, if I move L, I eat it.\n\nIf not, I can do it later.\n\nBut the body might block the access.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,3), then positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNow, (3,2) is body, so (2,2) is adjacent, but to eat, I need to move head to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move L to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) to eat.\n\nAt turn 18, if I moved U on turn 17, head at (3,3), direction Up.\n\nThen turn 18, I can move L to (2,3), new direction Left.\n\nThen turn 19, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), which eats the food.\n\nBut when I move to (2,2), is it safe?\n\nAt that time, the body positions.\n\nFirst, turn 17: move U to (3,3), positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nFood at (2,2), life span: at turn 17, countdown 6, after turn 17, countdown 5, so on turn 18, countdown 5, present.\n\nTurn 18: move L to (2,3), no food eaten? (2,3) has no food, so no growth.\n\nPositions: head to (2,3), body: (3,3) to where head was, (3,3) becomes body, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) moves to (6,1)? No growth, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(6,2) was tail, gone.\n\nNow, food at (2,2) still present, countdown 4 after turn 18? After turn 18, countdown decreases to 4 for turn 19.\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3), head direction Left (from previous move), so can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), eat food.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(2,2) is free, not occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), eat food, grow: head (2,2), then add new segment, so body: (2,3) becomes first body, then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail stays, so new tail is (6,1).\n\nPositions: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nNo collision, and head at (2,2), which was food.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, I could have eaten on turn 17.\n\nBut by delaying, I get the same score, but I used two moves to eat it, whereas if I eat now, I get it immediately.\n\nIn terms of score, it's the same, but I might have other considerations.\n\nBy eating later, I keep the snake shorter for now, which might be better for maneuvering, but since no other food, not sure.\n\nBut after eating, I have a longer snake, which might block more space.\n\nBut in this case, by moving up first, I free up some space.\n\nFor example, if I eat now at turn 17, head at (2,2), body includes (3,2), (3,1), etc., so the area around (3,2) and (3,3) might be blocked.\n\nIf I move up first to (3,3), then I have positions like (3,3), (3,2), etc., but when I later eat at (2,2), the body is different.\n\nBut in both cases, I get the food, so score is +1 either way.\n\nBut perhaps for survival, moving up first might open more options.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (2,2), the tail is at (6,1) or something, not adjacent.\n\nBut let's see if there's any risk.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating immediately if there's a risk, but here no.\n\nAnother option: moving right to (4,2) on turn 17.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can only move up to (4,3), as we saw earlier.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go to other places.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), it might be harder because I have to go left through y=3 or something, but the body is below.\n\nFor example, turn 17 move R to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nThen turn 18, only possible move U to (4,3), since D to (4,1) collision, R to (5,2) obstacle, L to (3,2) collision.\n\nSo move U to (4,3), no food, positions: head (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) gone.\n\nNow from (4,3), direction Up, can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free? (5,2) obstacle, but (5,3) is above, should be free.\n\n(3,3) free, (4,4) free.\n\nFood at (2,2) with countdown, say after turn 18, countdown 4 for turn 19? After turn 17, food countdown to 5, after turn 18 to 4.\n\nTo reach (2,2) from here: I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (2,3), then to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) might be eaten on turn 20 or later.\n\nTurn 19: from (4,3), move L to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — etc.\n\nThen turn 20, from (3,3) direction Left (if moved left), can move to (2,3) or (3,4) or (3,2) but (3,2) is body.\n\nMove to (2,3), then turn 21 to (2,2).\n\nBut on turn 21, food countdown: after turn 20, countdown 1 for turn 21, present, after turn 21, countdown 0, disappears.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 21.\n\nBut I need to make sure I can reach it.\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 20, move to (2,3), then to (2,2) on turn 21.\n\nBut (2,2) must be free.\n\nOn turn 20, when at (3,3), positions depend on previous.\n\nIt's possible, but it takes more turns and I might be cutting it close with life span.\n\nIf I eat on turn 17, I get the score immediately and have more time to move around.\n\nBut since no other food, it might not matter.\n\nHowever, by not eating now, I can explore and perhaps find better positions, but with only one food, eating now seems fine.\n\nBut let's think about the risk.\n\nThere's a potential danger with the body.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,3) on turn 17, then the body is at (3,2), which is adjacent to (2,2), but (2,2) has food, and if I later move to (2,2), I eat it, but is there Tail Reward Danger? No, because the food is at (2,2), not at tail.\n\nTail Reward Danger is when the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision because tail grows and hits head.\n\nBut here, food is at (2,2), not on tail.\n\nTail is at (6,2) or something, far away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for long-term survival, I should not eat immediately to keep options open.\n\nBut in this case, since the food is close, and I can eat it safely now.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2) might block paths.\n\nBut let's consider the available space.\n\nThe grid has size 6x6 free, but with obstacle and snake.\n\nAfter eating, snake length 8, so it occupies more cells.\n\nBut with 36 cells, minus walls and obstacles, playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so 36 cells.\n\nWalls: borders not playable, but internal obstacle at (5,2), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 7 now, after eating 8, so 27 or 28 free cells.\n\nPlenty of space.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the bottom row has many body segments, so moving down might be risky.\n\nBut from head at (3,2), moving down is not possible anyway.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat the food, and since no other food, I need to survive as long as possible for future food, but the problem doesn't say when new food spawns. I think for this decision, I should assume only this food for now, and eat it within life span.\n\nBut to be safe, eating it now is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the direction for future moves.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 17: current.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output might be for the current turn only or multiple?\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nIt says \"...\" so I need to provide a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide at least 5 actions or until a decision point.\n\nBut in practice, for Snake, I might need to plan a path.\n\nSince only one food, after eating it, I just need to survive and avoid dying, but no more food, so score is fixed at +1 if I eat it.\n\nBut the game might continue with new food spawning, but not specified.\n\nThe state only gives current food, so after eating this, I might have to wait for new food, but not described.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat this food and then survive to eat future food, but since not specified, I should eat this one and then move safely.\n\nFor now, let's focus on eating the food.\n\nI can eat it on turn 17 by moving Left.\n\nOr later.\n\nBut if I eat later, I might risk it expiring or getting blocked.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (4,2), then I can only go up, and it might be difficult to reach (2,2) later because the body is in the way.\n\nFrom (4,2) move U to (4,3), then to (4,4), etc., then to go left, I might have to go around.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (5,2), it might be tight.\n\nLet's see the path from (4,3) to (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) I can move L to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is free until I move there.\n\nOn turn 19, if at (4,3), move to (3,3), turn 20 to (2,3), turn 21 to (2,2).\n\nOn turn 21, food countdown: after turn 20, countdown 1, so on turn 21 present, I can eat.\n\nBut on turn 21, if I move to (2,2), it should be ok.\n\nHowever, the life span is 6 at turn 17, so on turn 21, it should be present.\n\nCountdown: turn 17: 6, turn 18:5, turn 19:4, turn 20:3, turn 21:2? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 17, life span 6.\n\nAfter turn 17, countdown decreases to 5.\n\nTurn 18, countdown 5.\n\nAfter turn 18, to 4.\n\nTurn 19, countdown 4.\n\nAfter turn 19, to 3.\n\nTurn 20, countdown 3.\n\nAfter turn 20, to 2.\n\nTurn 21, countdown 2.\n\nAfter turn 21, to 1.\n\nTurn 22, countdown 1.\n\nAfter turn 22, to 0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 21, countdown 2, present; turn 22, countdown 1, present; after turn 22, gone.\n\nSo I can eat as late as turn 22.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nBut if I move away, I might not be able to come back.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,3) on turn 17, then I can easily go to (2,3) and down to (2,2) on turn 18 or 19.\n\nIf I move right to (4,2), I can still reach it by turn 21.\n\nBut to minimize risk, eating now might be better.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake is currently near the bottom, and moving up might give more space.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,3), so when it moves, it frees up cells.\n\nFor long-term survival, after eating, I should move to open areas.\n\nBut for now, let's decide on turn 17 action.\n\nSince I need to provide a sequence, I should plan a few moves.\n\nLet's assume I eat the food on turn 17 by moving Left.\n\nThen on turn 17: move L to (2,2), eat food, new positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — length 8.\n\nDirection Left.\n\nTurn 18: from (2,2), can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nU to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\n(2,1) is free, (1,2) free, (2,3) free.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSay I move U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nThen positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,3) gone, so positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNew tail is (6,2).\n\nDirection Up (since moved U).\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3), can move U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), not D (reverse).\n\n(2,4) free, (1,3) free, (3,3) free.\n\nSay move U to (2,4), and so on.\n\nBut I need to think about avoiding dead ends.\n\nIf I don't eat now, move U to (3,3) on turn 17.\n\nThen turn 17: move U to (3,3), no food, positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nDirection Up.\n\nTurn 18: can move U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\nAll free.\n\nI can move L to (2,3) to approach food.\n\nThen turn 18: move L to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — (6,2) gone.\n\nDirection Left.\n\nTurn 19: move D to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nAs I described earlier.\n\nThen eat on turn 19.\n\nSame score, but I used two moves.\n\nIn terms of score per turn, it's lower, but since score is total, it's the same.\n\nBut for survival, it might be similar.\n\nMoving right to (4,2) seems worse because it forces me up and away from food.\n\nFrom (4,2), only move U to (4,3), then from there I can go left, but it takes longer.\n\nAnd the body is on the bottom, so the left area is free.\n\nBut to be efficient, I should eat the food soon.\n\nSince the food is at (2,2), and head at (3,2), moving left directly is the shortest path.\n\nAnd no immediate danger.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can move up to (2,3) or down to (2,1), but (2,1) is near the bottom, which has body, so moving up might be better to open space.\n\n(2,1) is free, but y=1 has body at (3,1) etc., so moving down might be riskier if I get trapped.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (2,1) from (2,2), then I am at (2,1), with body around, and walls below.\n\ny=0 wall, so from (2,1), I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nL to (1,1), U to (2,2) but occupied, R to (3,1) body, so only L to (1,1) or U but U to (2,2) is body, so only L to (1,1).\n\nThen from (1,1), I can move U or L, etc.\n\nBut it might be a bit constrained.\n\nWhereas moving up to (2,3) gives more freedom.\n\nSo for long-term, after eating, moving up is better.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat on turn 17, then on turn 18 move U to (2,3).\n\nIf I eat on turn 19, from (2,3) move D to (2,2).\n\nBut in both cases, I end up at (2,2) with food eaten.\n\nThe difference is when I eat.\n\nSince the food life span is long, I can delay, but there's no benefit, and by eating now, I get the score and can grow, which might be useful if new food spawns, but not specified.\n\nI think for simplicity, I should eat the food on turn 17.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"maximize score by eating positive food\", so I should eat it when possible.\n\nAlso, \"prioritize long-term survival\", but here eating now doesn't harm survival.\n\nSo I'll go with move Left on turn 17.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to provide actions.\n\nBut I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other food, I just need to move safely without dying.\n\nSo after eating, I can move to open spaces.\n\nFor example, after turn 17 move L to (2,2), head at (2,2) direction Left.\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,3), direction Up.\n\nThen turn 19: from (2,3), move U to (2,4), or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3).\n\nSay move U to (2,4) to go up.\n\nThen turn 20: from (2,4) move U to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about walls: y=7 is wall, so I can't go beyond y=6.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nSo I should turn at some point.\n\nBut since no food, I can just move in a safe pattern, like circling.\n\nBut to be specific, let's define a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can provide actions until I eat the food and a few more.\n\nBut since I eat on turn 17, I need actions for turn 17,18,19,etc.\n\nBut the output should start from turn 17.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead, I need to consider turns 17 to 22 or so.\n\nBut let's make a decision.\n\nI think moving Left on turn 17 is fine.\n\nThen for turn 18, from (2,2) direction Left, move U to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 19, from (2,3) direction Up, move U to (2,4).\n\nThen turn 20, from (2,4) direction Up, move U to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 21, from (2,5) direction Up, but y=5, move U to (2,6), which is below y=7 wall.\n\n(2,6) is within bounds, y=6, since y=7 wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\nThen from (2,6), can move L to (1,6), or R to (3,6), not D (reverse).\n\nSay move R to (3,6).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to avoid the obstacle at (5,2), but it's far.\n\nSince no other food, this is fine.\n\nIf I don't eat now, but I think it's better to eat.\n\nAnother thing: in the state, snake head direction is U, and I move L, which is a left turn, not reverse, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are valid.\n\nSo I'll go with eating on turn 17.\n\nThen for the sequence, let's say:\n\nTurn 17: L (to eat food)\n\nThen for survival, move up.\n\nTurn 18: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 19: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 20: U (to (2,5))\n\nAt (2,5), y=5, move U to (2,6) on turn 21.\n\nBut (2,6) is near top, then I can move right.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nTo keep space, from (2,3) I could move right to (3,3) instead of up, but up is fine.\n\nI think it's arbitrary.\n\nSince I need to output multiple actions, I'll provide for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the food life span is until turn 22, but I eat early.\n\nPerhaps I should include the eat move in the sequence.\n\nFinal decision: move Left on turn 17 to eat food.\n\nThen for turn 18, move Up to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 19, move Up to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 20, move Up to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 21, move Up to (2,6)\n\nBut at (2,6), if I move Up, y+1 to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot, collision.\n\ny=7 is wall, so from (2,6), I cannot move Up.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is the last row before wall.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move Left to (1,6), Right to (3,6), or Down to (2,5), but Down is reverse if direction is Up.\n\nDirection: if I moved U to (2,6), direction is Up, so I cannot move Down, only Left, Right, or Up, but Up to (2,7) wall, so only Left or Right.\n\nSo on turn 21, from (2,6), move R to (3,6) or L to (1,6).\n\nSay move R to (3,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in my sequence, on turn 20, at (2,5), move U to (2,6), then turn 21 move R to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 21 or 22.\n\nSince the instruction is to think ahead, but output for current and future turns.\n\nI think for turn 17, action L.\n\nThen I need to provide for t1+1, etc.\n\nBut I can stop after a few, but the format has \"...\" so I can provide a sequence.\n\nTo be complete, let's provide 5 actions.\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: from (2,5) move U to (2,6), but on turn 20 at (2,5), if I move U to (2,6), then on turn 21 at (2,6), as above.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 action U to (2,6), then turn 21, from (2,6), move say R to (3,6).\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path to the center or something.\n\nSince it's arbitrary, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 17: L (eat food)\n\nTurn 18: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 19: R (to (3,3), for example)\n\nFrom (2,3), after turn 18 U to (2,3), direction Up.\n\nTurn 19: can move R to (3,3), which is free.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to other places.\n\nThis might be better than going up to the wall.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3), direction Right (since moved R), can move U to (3,4), R to (4,3), D to (3,2) but (3,2) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 19: positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 17: move L to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,3), no food, so head to (2,3), body: (2,2) to where head was, so positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,3) gone, so (6,2) is tail? Segments: after move, head (2,3), segment 1: previous head (2,2), segment 2: (3,2), segment 3: (3,1), segment 4: (4,1), segment 5: (5,1), segment 6: (6,1), segment 7: (6,2) — length 8, tail (6,2).\n\nNew positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTurn 19: move R to (3,3), no food, head to (3,3), body: (2,3) to (2,3)? Head to (3,3), segment 1 to previous head (2,3), segment 2 to (2,2), segment 3 to (3,2), segment 4 to (3,1), segment 5 to (4,1), segment 6 to (5,1), segment 7 to (6,1) — tail (6,2) moves to (6,1), so new tail (6,1).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(6,2) gone.\n\nFrom (3,3), direction Right, can move U to (3,4), R to (4,3), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, or L to (2,3) body, collision.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nSay move U to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 20: U to (3,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI think for the answer, I can provide:\n\nTurn 17: L\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: from (3,4) move U or R, etc.\n\nBut I think it's sufficient to provide up to where I have decided.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 17, and I move away.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (2,2) while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must think 5+ turns ahead. The food has a life span of 6 at turn 17, meaning it will disappear after turn 22 (countdown decreases each turn, including turn 17). Eating the food immediately on turn 17 is safe and efficient, as it avoids the risk of the food expiring or the snake becoming trapped in a position where it cannot reach the food later. After eating, the snake should move upward to open areas for better maneuverability and to avoid potential dead ends near the bottom of the grid, where the body is concentrated.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 17 Action**: Move left (L) to (2,2) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 8). This is safe, as (2,2) is unoccupied, and there is no tail reward danger (tail is at (6,3), not adjacent).\n- **Subsequent Actions**: After eating, move upward to access the less cluttered upper rows. This avoids the dense body segments at y=1 and the obstacle at (5,2). Movement must respect the no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 17, no other food is present, so the focus shifts to avoiding collisions and staying in open areas. Moving upward to y=6 provides space, but the snake must turn before hitting the wall at y=7. A right turn at (2,3) or (2,4) ensures the snake does not get trapped.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: The sequence below ensures the food is eaten safely on turn 17 and positions the snake in the center-top of the grid by turn 21, maximizing freedom for future movements. No risks (e.g., body collisions or walls) are encountered in this sequence.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 17**: Move L (left) to (2,2) – eats positive food, score +1, length 8. New head direction: Left.\n- **Turn 18**: Move U (up) to (2,3) – moves away from the dense bottom area. New head direction: Up.\n- **Turn 19**: Move R (right) to (3,3) – begins horizontal movement to access more open space. New head direction: Right.\n- **Turn 20**: Move U (up) to (3,4) – continues upward to center grid. New head direction: Up.\n- **Turn 21**: Move U (up) to (3,5) – positions snake in upper half, away from walls and body. New head direction: Up.\n\nThis sequence eats the food immediately, adds +1 to the score, and ensures survival for at least 5 turns. By turn 21, the snake is at (3,5) with direction Up, allowing flexible future moves (e.g., left, right, or up to (3,6)). The open area around (3,5) minimizes collision risks and supports long-term survival for potential future food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: L (left)\nTurn 18: U (up)\nTurn 19: R (right)\nTurn 20: U (up)\nTurn 21: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 18. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), then body segments: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n\nHead direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,2) from (3,2), I assume.\n\nFood information: the state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" but it's not listed. That might be a mistake. Let me check the input.\n\nIn the state input, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\" but no values are given. Perhaps I need to look back.\n\nIn the user message, it says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" but then nothing is listed. That can't be right. Maybe it's missing.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and then it's blank. Perhaps it's an error in the query.\n\nNo, in the \"Current State\" section, it has: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" but no entries. That must be a mistake. For the snake to make a decision, I need the food positions.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that there are no food items present? But that seems unlikely. Let me double-check the input.\n\nThe user said: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and then nothing. Maybe it's implied that there is no food, but that would be strange for the game.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, and I need to proceed with the given info. But without food, the snake should just avoid dying, I guess.\n\nBut the core rules mention positive and negative food, so probably there should be some food.\n\nLooking back at the initial problem: in the state input format, it has \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\" but in the current state, it's listed as \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" with no data.\n\nI think I have to work with what's given. Perhaps there is no food at this turn. But let's see the grid.\n\nI should map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 5: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 6: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 7: (6,3)  // tail\n\nSo the snake body: from head to tail: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nHead direction is L, so it came from right to (2,2), so previous move was left.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2): since head direction is L, I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right. Allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, cells around (2,2):\n\n- Up: (2,3)\n\n- Down: (2,1)\n\n- Left: (1,2)\n\n- Right: (3,2) but that's occupied by body, and moving right is not allowed anyway.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- (2,3): is this a wall? Border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=3 is not a border wall. x=0 and x=7 are walls. (2,3) x=2, y=3, not border. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not here. So (2,3) is empty? But I need to see if it's occupied by body.\n\nSnake body: positions are (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (2,3) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless there's food or something.\n\nBut no food listed, so (2,3) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): x=2,y=1, not border, not obstacle, not in snake body? Snake has (3,1) but not (2,1), so empty.\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2, not border (x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is ok), y=2, not border. Not obstacle. Not in snake body, so empty.\n\nNow, (3,2) is occupied by body, but since I can't move right, it's irrelevant.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead, and there might be food, but no food is listed, so I should just focus on survival.\n\nThe state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" with no entries, so probably no food at this turn.\n\nBut that seems odd. Perhaps I should assume that for this turn, there is no food, and I need to move to a safe position.\n\nBut the snake needs to eat to grow, but with no food, it can only move around.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,3), and when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells might free up.\n\nBut since no food, moving doesn't change length.\n\nNow, to maximize score, but no food, so score doesn't change, so I should just avoid dying.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns ahead in case food appears later, but I don't have information about future food; I only know current state.\n\nThe state only gives current food, not future. So I have to base decisions on current known food.\n\nSince no current food, I should move to a position where I can be safe and potentially access areas where food might spawn, but I don't control food spawn; it's given each turn.\n\nSo for now, I should choose a move that keeps me safe for the next few turns.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid:\n\ny=7: wall\n\ny=6: ... but let's list rows from y=7 top to y=0 bottom, or y=0 bottom to y=7 top? Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since walls are y=0 and y=7, it could be either. I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left for simplicity, so y increases up, x increases right.\n\nBut in snake, it doesn't matter, as long as coordinates are consistent.\n\nSo cells:\n\nList occupied cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7 for all y; all y=0, y=7 for all x; and internal (5,2).\n\nSnake: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (0,1) to (0,6) except walls, but x=0 is wall, so not accessible. Similarly, x=7 wall.\n\nAccessible area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n\nFree cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except snake positions and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo (5,1) is snake, (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) snake, (3,1), (4,1) snake.\n\n(2,2) and (3,2) snake.\n\nNow, (1,1) to (1,6), (2,1), (2,3) to (2,6), (3,3) to (3,6), (4,2), (4,3) to (4,6), (5,3) to (5,6), (6,4) to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so not available.\n\nFrom head at (2,2), moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): free? (2,3) not snake, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\n- D to (2,1): (2,1) not snake, not wall, not obstacle, free.\n\n- L to (1,2): (1,2) not snake (snake has x from 2 to 6), not wall (x=1 not wall, x=0 is wall), not obstacle, so free.\n\nAll three moves are safe for this turn.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will advance, so the tail will move from (6,3) to wherever the body moves.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and the tail segment is removed, so the cell (6,3) will be free after this move, but since no food there, it doesn't matter.\n\nSimilarly, other body segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (2,3), new head position (2,3), then the body: previous head (2,2) becomes neck, then (3,2) becomes next, and so on, up to tail (6,3) which is removed, so new tail is (6,2) or something.\n\nLet's trace the body.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to a new position, say new_head, then the new body will be: new_head, then old position 0, position 1, ..., up to position 6. Position 7 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new body: [new_head, (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nAnd the tail (6,3) is gone.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, since no food, length doesn't change.\n\nTo plan ahead, I should consider the possible paths and avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the grid has an obstacle at (5,2), which blocks that cell.\n\nAlso, the snake is in the bottom-left area.\n\nLet me list the grid with snake and obstacles.\n\nMake a mental map:\n\nRow y=6: free except walls on sides\n\ny=5: free\n\ny=4: free\n\ny=3: cells (1,3) to (6,3) free except (6,3) is tail now, but after move it might be free.\n\nAt turn 18, before move.\n\nBut after move, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the state after possible moves.\n\nSince no food, the immediate goal is to not trap myself.\n\nFor instance, if I move left to (1,2), then head at (1,2), body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] and tail (6,3) removed.\n\nThen from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, so invalid, R to (2,2) but (2,2) is now body, so collision, so only U and D possible.\n\n(2,2) is part of body, so moving right to (2,2) would be collision.\n\nSo from (1,2), can move U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (2,3), head at (2,3), body: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail removed.\n\nFrom (2,3), moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision, L to (1,3), R to (3,3) or (3,2)? (3,2) is body, so moving right to (3,3) if free.\n\n(3,3) not occupied, so U, L, R possible? D is to (2,2) body, so not possible.\n\nDirections: from (2,3), U (2,4), D (2,2) body, L (1,3), R (3,3). (3,3) is free, so U, L, R possible.\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (2,1), head at (2,1), body: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail removed.\n\nFrom (2,1), moves: U to (2,2) body, collision, D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L to (1,1), R to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, so only L possible? U and D not possible, R to (3,1) body, so only L to (1,1) if free.\n\n(1,1) should be free.\n\nSo if I move down, then next turn I can only move left to (1,1), which might be limiting.\n\nLet's evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, move left to (1,2) at turn 18.\n\nThen turn 19: head at (1,2), body as above, can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nIf move U to (1,3), then turn 19: head to (1,3), body: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] and (6,2) removed? After moving to (1,2) at turn 18, body is [ (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] since (6,3) removed.\n\nThen at turn 19, move U to (1,3), new body: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] and (6,2) removed.\n\nFrom (1,3), can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) if free. (2,3) should be free, so U or R.\n\nSimilarly, if at (1,2) turn 19 move D to (1,1), then similar.\n\nBut moving to (1,2) might corner me in the left column.\n\nNow, second option: move up to (2,3) at turn 18.\n\nThen turn 19: head at (2,3), body [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] (6,3) removed.\n\nFrom (2,3), can move U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nAll should be free.\n\n(1,3) free, (2,4) free, (3,3) free.\n\nThen I have more options.\n\nThird option: move down to (2,1) at turn 18.\n\nThen turn 19: head at (2,1), body [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] (6,1) and (6,2) are body, but (6,2) is part of body.\n\nFrom (2,1), can only move L to (1,1), because U to (2,2) body, D to (2,0) wall, R to (3,1) body.\n\nSo only L to (1,1).\n\nThen at turn 19, move to (1,1), body [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] (6,2) removed.\n\nFrom (1,1), can move U to (1,2), D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) body, so only U to (1,2).\n\nThen turn 20: at (1,2), and so on. This seems like I'm stuck in the bottom-left corner with limited moves.\n\nMoving down to (2,1) seems risky because it forces me into a corner with only one choice next turn.\n\nMoving left to (1,2) also puts me on the edge, but I have two choices: up or down.\n\nMoving up to (2,3) gives me more freedom, with three choices next turn.\n\nTherefore, for long-term survival, moving up might be better.\n\nBut there might be food; the state says no food, but perhaps I should confirm.\n\nThe user input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and then nothing, so I think it's empty.\n\nBut in the core rules, food can spawn under body, but not mentioned.\n\nFor now, with no food, I should avoid moves that limit options.\n\nMoving down to (2,1) is bad because next turn I must go to (1,1), then to (1,2), and I might be trapped.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), I can go to (1,3) or (1,1), but (1,1) is body if I came from there, but let's see.\n\nSuppose at turn 18 I move down to (2,1).\n\nTurn 19: must move L to (1,1).\n\nTurn 20: from (1,1), only U to (1,2) (since D wall, L wall, R body).\n\nTurn 21: from (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1), but (1,1) is now free? At turn 20, after moving to (1,2), body is [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ] and (6,1) removed.\n\nThen from (1,2), U to (1,3) or D to (1,1). (1,1) is part of body? In the body list, (1,1) is the second segment, so moving down to (1,1) would be collision, since head touches body.\n\n(1,1) is occupied by the body, so moving to (1,1) from (1,2) is not possible; it's a collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any body cell is death.\n\nSo from (1,2) at turn 21, possible moves: U to (1,3) or R to (2,2) but (2,2) is body? Body has (2,2) as fourth segment? Positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), then (2,1), then (2,2), so (2,2) is occupied, so cannot move right. L to (0,2) wall, D to (1,1) body, so only U to (1,3) possible.\n\nThen turn 22: at (1,3), can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body, L wall, R to (2,3) if free.\n\n(2,3) should be free, so U or R.\n\nBut I was forced into a path with few choices.\n\nIf at turn 18 I move left to (1,2), then turn 19 at (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nIf move U to (1,3), then from (1,3), can move U to (1,4) or R to (2,3), etc.\n\nMore options.\n\nBut moving up to (2,3) at turn 18 gives even more options immediately.\n\nMoreover, (2,3) is more central, so I can access more of the grid.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (1,3), or (3,3), all open.\n\nThen I can explore the upper area.\n\nThe snake is currently in the bottom, with tail around (6,2) etc.\n\nMoving up might be better to avoid the crowded bottom-left.\n\nThere's also the obstacle at (5,2), but it's not blocking me directly.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,3), and when I move, it will be free, but since no food, no issue.\n\nBut for future, if food appears, I might go for it.\n\nBut no current food.\n\nI think for turn 18, moving up is the best choice to maintain flexibility.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan, but since no food, I should just keep moving safely.\n\nThe answer format requires actions for multiple turns: from turn 18 to turn 18+5 or something? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer should specify actions for each turn starting from current.\n\nAnswer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the immediate turns, I think for as long as I can or until a decision point.\n\nSince no food, I can output a sequence.\n\nBut food might appear, so I should only output the necessary turns, but the state is only for turn 18, so I have to assume no new food for now, or that food info is per turn.\n\nThe state is given per turn, so for this response, I only have current state, so I should decide based on current.\n\nBut to \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to simulate possible moves.\n\nSince no food, the score doesn't change, so survival is key.\n\nI think for turn 18, move U.\n\nThen for turn 19, from (2,3), I can choose, say, U to (2,4) or something, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should output only the first action, but the answer format says multiple turns.\n\nLet's see the format: \"\\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nAnd it says \"each action for the turns\".\n\nBut for how many turns? It doesn't specify. I think I need to provide actions for at least a few turns to show the plan.\n\nSince the thinking is ahead, but output might be for the immediate action.\n\nTo be safe, I'll provide a sequence for 3-5 turns or until a point where I need to reassess.\n\nBut with no food, it's straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the food is missing in the input; maybe I should assume standard or something, but I think I have to proceed.\n\nPerhaps in the context, food positions are empty.\n\nI think I should go with move U for turn 18.\n\nThen for turn 19, from (2,3), I can move, say, R to (3,3) to go towards the center.\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nThen turn 20 from (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's list a sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 18: move U to (2,3)\n\nThen new head direction is U, since I moved up.\n\nCurrent direction was L, but after move, the new direction is the move I made.\n\nFor no reverse rule, next turn I cannot move down, opposite to up.\n\nNow, after move U to (2,3), body: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] (6,3) removed.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 19: possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision, so cannot; L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) and (3,3) should be free, (2,4) free.\n\nSo can move U, L, or R.\n\nI should avoid moving towards the body or dead ends.\n\nFor example, moving L to (1,3) might lead to the left edge, similar issue.\n\nMoving U to (2,4) or R to (3,3) are both fine.\n\nPerhaps move R to (3,3) to go away from the left.\n\nThen at (3,3), direction R (since moved right? From (2,3) to (3,3), so moving right, direction R.\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,3), can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision? (3,2) is part of body? Current body after turn 19: if I moved to (3,3) at turn 19, let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 18: positions [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n\nTurn 19: move R to (3,3), new head (3,3), new body: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] and (6,2) removed.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) is occupied by body (it's the fourth segment), so cannot move D.\n\nL to (2,3) is occupied by body (second segment), so cannot move L.\n\nR to (4,3) should be free.\n\nU to (3,4) free.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf move R to (4,3), then direction R.\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3), body after move: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ] (6,1) removed.\n\nMoves: U (4,4), D (4,2), L (3,3) body, R (5,3).\n\n(3,3) body, so cannot L.\n\nD to (4,2): is it free? (4,2) not in body, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacle is (5,2), so (4,2) should be free.\n\nU to (4,4) free.\n\nR to (5,3) free, but (5,3) is above obstacle (5,2).\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue, but it might be arbitrary.\n\nSince no food, any safe move is fine.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 18, move U.\n\nThen for turn 19, move R to (3,3).\n\nTurn 20, from (3,3), move U to (3,4) or R to (4,3).\n\nSay move R to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 21, from (4,3), move U to (4,4), for example.\n\nBut I don't need to specify too many.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should avoid the area where the body is.\n\nThe body is mostly on the bottom, so moving up or right is good.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so cells are freeing up.\n\nFor example, (6,3) freed at turn 18, (6,2) freed at turn 19 if I move, etc.\n\nBut with no food, no benefit.\n\nI think for turn 18, moving up is best.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can say:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 20: U (to (3,4))\n\n Etc.\n\nBut let's see if there's a reason to choose differently.\n\nAnother thing: the food might be missing, but perhaps in the state, it's implied.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nPerhaps the user forgot to list food; in that case, I should ask, but since it's a simulation, I'll assume no food.\n\nSo for turn 18, action U.\n\nThen for turn 19, from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3) to explore.\n\nThen turn 20 from (3,3), move U to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 21 from (3,4), can move U to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut to be complete, I'll provide 3 actions.\n\nBut the turn numbers: t1=18, so Turn 18, Turn 19, Turn 20.\n\nThen in the box.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes, but for no reverse, it's handled.\n\nSo I think:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut at turn 20 from (3,3), moving U to (3,4) is fine.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut I'll stop at turn 20.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 19: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 21: from (3,4), body depends on previous, but at turn 20, after moving to (3,4), let's assume direction U.\n\nPositions: after turn 19: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] (6,2) removed at turn 19? After turn 18 move U, body: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n\nTurn 19 move R to (3,3): new body [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] (6,2) removed.\n\nTurn 20 move U to (3,4): new body [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ] (6,1) removed.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 21: possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) body, L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,3) is body, so cannot D.\n\nL to (2,4) should be free, R to (4,4) free.\n\nSo U, L, R possible.\n\nSay move U to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,5), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 22 or so.\n\nBut it's arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps for the response, since no food, I can just provide the first action and imply the plan.\n\nBut the format suggests multiple turns.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the food is listed but missing in the text. For example, in the user message, it might be cut off.\n\nLooking back: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and no list, so I think it's empty.\n\nI think I should go with the move.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 18, with no food present, the primary goal is to ensure long-term survival by avoiding collisions and maintaining flexibility for future moves. The snake should move to open areas to avoid dead ends and potential traps. After evaluating possible moves from the head position (2,2) with current direction left (L), the options are:\n\n- **Up (U) to (2,3)**: This move avoids the crowded bottom-left area and provides multiple safe paths for future turns. It is preferred as it centralizes the head and allows access to more open cells.\n- **Down (D) to (2,1)**: This move leads to a dead end, as it forces the snake into the bottom-left corner with only one possible move next turn (left to (1,1)), severely limiting options and increasing collision risk.\n- **Left (L) to (1,2)**: This move confines the snake to the left edge, reducing flexibility and potentially leading to traps if not managed carefully.\n\nMoving up (U) is the best choice for turn 18, as it maximizes future mobility. For subsequent turns, a sequence is planned to navigate toward open areas while avoiding the body and obstacles. The plan considers 5 turns ahead (turns 18 to 22) to ensure safety and adaptability:\n\n- **Turn 18 (current)**: Move U to (2,3). This positions the head in a less congested area and avoids immediate risks. New head direction is U.\n- **Turn 19**: From (2,3), move R to (3,3). This moves the snake right, away from the left edge and toward the center. New head direction is R.\n- **Turn 20**: From (3,3), move U to (3,4). This continues upward, exploring open space and staying clear of the body. New head direction is U.\n- **Turn 21**: From (3,4), move U to (3,5). This further progresses upward, maintaining a safe distance from the body and obstacles. New head direction is U.\n- **Turn 22**: From (3,5), move R to (4,5). This shifts right to access more open cells and avoid potential dead ends. New head direction is R.\n\nThis sequence prioritizes long-term survival by:\n- Avoiding the bottom-left corner where the snake's body is concentrated.\n- Steering clear of the internal obstacle at (5,2) and walls.\n- Ensuring multiple move options are available each turn to handle potential food spawns or hazards.\n\nIf food appears in future states, the plan can be adjusted to target positive food while avoiding risks, especially tail reward danger.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: R\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the current turn is 19. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, and similarly for y. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,3), and the body segments are (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n\nHead direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n\nFood: there's one food at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 10. But life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 19, it has life span 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 more turns? Life span is given as 10 at turn 19, and it decreases every turn, so after turn 19, it will have 9 left, then 8, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. The food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions, (4,1) is the fifth segment: positions are index 0: (2,3) head, index 1: (2,2), index 2: (3,2), index 3: (3,1), index 4: (4,1), index 5: (5,1), index 6: (6,1), index 7: (6,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,1) is occupied by the snake's body segment at index 4.\n\nNow, food is at (4,1), which is under the body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So since the body is currently on (4,1), the snake needs to move so that this cell is vacated, and then later the head can move there to eat the food.\n\nBut the food has a life span of 10, starting from turn 19. So it will disappear after turn 28? Let's calculate: at turn 19, life span 10, so it decreases to 9 at turn 20, 8 at 21, ..., 1 at 28, and then disappears after turn 28, meaning not available on turn 29. But since we eat on the turn we move onto it, as long as we move onto it by turn 28, we can eat it.\n\nNow, the head is at (2,3), moving up. Current direction is U.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, what are the possible moves from (2,3) with direction U.\n\nPossible directions: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite to U, and no instant reverse.\n\nSo actions: U (up to (2,4)), L (left to (1,3)), or R (right to (3,3)).\n\nNow, I need to consider the grid boundaries and walls.\n\nGrid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is within bounds.\n\nSo from (2,3):\n\n- U to (2,4): y=4, which is within 1 to 6, so ok.\n\n- L to (1,3): x=1, which is min x, but not wall, since walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are ok. y=3 ok.\n\n- R to (3,3): x=3, y=3, both ok.\n\nNow, check for collisions: moving to these cells, is there a body segment there?\n\nSnake positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nAfter moving, the snake will move: head to new position, and tail will move forward, so the cell that was tail (6,2) will be vacated, and the new tail will be the previous segment.\n\nBut for collision, when moving, the head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nRules: deadly collisions include body collision, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nSo, let's list the body segments that are not the tail: positions 1 to 6: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). Tail is (6,2).\n\nFor a move to be safe, the new head position should not be occupied by any of the body segments except possibly the tail.\n\nBut since the tail will move, if head moves to tail position, it's ok, as long as after move, head and tail don't collide, but since tail moves, it should be fine.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to the current tail position, then after the move, the head is there, and the tail moves away, so no collision. But the snake grows only if it eats food, otherwise length same.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten immediately, so length same, tail moves.\n\nSo for each possible move:\n\n- Move U to (2,4): is (2,4) occupied? Current positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), etc. (2,4) not in list, so empty? But we need to consider if it's a wall or obstacle.\n\n(2,4): x=2, y=4, not a border wall, and not (5,2), so free. No body there, so safe.\n\n- Move L to (1,3): (1,3) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle, so safe.\n\n- Move R to (3,3): (3,3) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle, so safe.\n\nAll three moves are safe at this turn.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's food at (4,1) with value +1, under the body. To eat it, the snake needs to move so that (4,1) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (4,1) is occupied by the body at index 4. When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if the snake doesn't eat, the tail will move away from (6,2) to the next segment.\n\nCurrent tail is (6,2). After a move without eating, the new tail will be (6,1) or something? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail (6,2).\n\nAfter moving, say head moves to new position, then the body follows: the segment that was at (2,3) is now the new position, then the next segment moves to where head was, and so on, but since no growth, the tail end is removed.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the first body segment moves to where head was, second to where first was, etc., and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo after one move without eating, the new positions depend on where head goes.\n\nFor example, if head moves U to (2,4), then new head (2,4), then body: segment 1 (was (2,2)) moves to (2,3) (previous head), segment 2 (was (3,2)) moves to (2,2), segment 3 (was (3,1)) moves to (3,2), segment 4 (was (4,1)) moves to (3,1), segment 5 (was (5,1)) moves to (4,1), segment 6 (was (6,1)) moves to (5,1), segment 7 (tail, was (6,2)) moves to (6,1). And tail was (6,2), now moves to (6,1), so (6,2) vacated.\n\nLet's list new positions if head to (2,4):\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Body: segment 1: to (2,3)  // previous head pos\n\n- Segment 2: to (2,2)  // where segment 1 was\n\n- Segment 3: to (3,2)  // where segment 2 was\n\n- Segment 4: to (3,1)  // where segment 3 was\n\n- Segment 5: to (4,1)  // where segment 4 was? Segment 4 was at (4,1)? No.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nIndex 0: head (2,3)\n\nIndex 1: (2,2)\n\nIndex 2: (3,2)\n\nIndex 3: (3,1)\n\nIndex 4: (4,1)\n\nIndex 5: (5,1)\n\nIndex 6: (6,1)\n\nIndex 7: tail (6,2)\n\nAfter head moves to (2,4):\n\n- New head: (2,4)\n\n- New index 1: previous head position (2,3)\n\n- New index 2: position of old index 1, which is (2,2)\n\n- New index 3: position of old index 2, which is (3,2)\n\n- New index 4: position of old index 3, which is (3,1)\n\n- New index 5: position of old index 4, which is (4,1)\n\n- New index 6: position of old index 5, which is (5,1)\n\n- New index 7: position of old index 6, which is (6,1)  // tail\n\nOld index 7 (tail) is removed, so (6,2) vacated.\n\nNow, the food is at (4,1), which was occupied by old index 4. In the new positions, (4,1) is now occupied by new index 5? New index 5 is at (4,1), because it moved from old index 4 to where? Old index 4 was at (4,1), and it moves to the position of old index 3, which is (3,1). Let's clarify.\n\nAfter head move, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo:\n\n- New position for segment i is the old position of segment i-1, for i from 1 to 7, but since no growth, the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nStandard: the body segments shift down: the segment that was behind the head now occupies the head's old position, and so on.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head position: the move destination.\n\n- New position for segment 1: old position of head (2,3)\n\n- New position for segment 2: old position of segment 1 (2,2)\n\n- New position for segment 3: old position of segment 2 (3,2)\n\n- New position for segment 4: old position of segment 3 (3,1)\n\n- New position for segment 5: old position of segment 4 (4,1)  // but segment 4 was at (4,1), so segment 5 moves to (4,1)\n\n- New position for segment 6: old position of segment 5 (5,1)\n\n- New position for segment 7: old position of segment 6 (6,1)\n\nBut segment 7 is the new tail, at (6,1). Old segment 7 at (6,2) is no longer part of snake, so vacated.\n\nNow, the cell (4,1): old position, it was occupied by segment 4. After move, segment 5 moves to old position of segment 4, which is (4,1), so (4,1) is still occupied by the snake, now by segment 5.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves elsewhere, the body shifts, so (4,1) might be occupied by a different segment or vacated if the tail was there, but tail is at (6,2), not (4,1).\n\nIn this case, after moving, (4,1) is still occupied by the snake, specifically by the segment that was previously at (5,1) or something. In the new positions, segment 5 is at (4,1), which was the old position of segment 4.\n\nSince the snake didn't grow, the cell (4,1) remains occupied, but by a different segment. The food is still under the body unless the body moves away from that cell.\n\nTo vacate (4,1), the snake needs to move in such a way that the segment currently on (4,1) moves away, and no other segment moves there immediately, but since the body is shifting, (4,1) will be occupied as long as it's not the tail position when the tail moves.\n\nThe cell (4,1) will be vacated only when the segment that is on it moves to another position, and no new segment moves in, which happens when that segment is not followed, but in the shift, it's always occupied until the tail leaves it.\n\nSpecifically, (4,1) is currently occupied by segment index 4. When the snake moves, segment index 4 moves to the old position of segment 3, which is (3,1), so it leaves (4,1). Then segment index 5 moves to the old position of segment 4, which is (4,1), so segment 5 enters (4,1). So (4,1) is still occupied, but by segment 5 now. Similarly, after each move without eating, the occupant of (4,1) changes to the next segment, but it remains occupied until the tail is on it and moves away.\n\nThe tail is at (6,2), which is not (4,1), so (4,1) will be occupied until the tail reaches that position.\n\nThe segment on (4,1) will move away each turn, but the next segment moves in, so the cell is only vacated when the tail is on it and the snake moves without eating, so the tail moves away and it's vacated.\n\nCurrently, (4,1) is occupied by index 4. After one move, index 4 moves to (3,1), index 5 moves to (4,1). After another move, index 5 moves to (3,1) or wherever, index 6 moves to (4,1), and so on.\n\nEventually, when index 7 (tail) is on (4,1), and the snake moves without eating, then the tail moves away, and (4,1) is vacated.\n\nHow many moves until tail is on (4,1)?\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nIndex 4: (4,1)\n\nIndex 5: (5,1)\n\nIndex 6: (6,1)\n\nIndex 7: (6,2) tail\n\nAfter first move (turn 19), say head moves somewhere, the body shifts:\n\n- Index 4 moves to old index 3 position: (3,1)\n\n- Index 5 moves to old index 4 position: (4,1)\n\n- Index 6 moves to old index 5 position: (5,1)\n\n- Index 7 moves to old index 6 position: (6,1)  // new tail\n\nSo (4,1) now occupied by index 5.\n\nAfter second move (turn 20):\n\n- Index 5 moves to where index 4 is, which is (3,1) after turn 19? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 19 move:\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: new position, say (2,4) for example.\n\nThen body:\n\nIndex 1: (2,3)\n\nIndex 2: (2,2)\n\nIndex 3: (3,2)\n\nIndex 4: (3,1)  // moved from (4,1)\n\nIndex 5: (4,1)  // moved from (5,1)? Old index 5 was (5,1), moved to old index 4 position (4,1)\n\nIndex 6: (5,1)  // moved to old index 5 position (5,1)? Old index 5 was (5,1), so index 6 moves to (5,1)\n\nIndex 7: (6,1)  // new tail\n\n(4,1) occupied by index 5.\n\nNow after turn 20 move:\n\nHead moves to new position.\n\nBody shifts:\n\nIndex 1 moves to old head position\n\nIndex 2 moves to old index 1 position\n\n...\n\nSpecifically:\n\nNew index 4: position of old index 3, which was (3,2) in this case\n\nNew index 5: position of old index 4, which was (3,1)\n\nNew index 6: position of old index 5, which was (4,1)\n\nNew index 7: position of old index 6, which was (5,1)  // new tail\n\nSo (4,1) now occupied by index 6.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 21 move:\n\nNew index 6: position of old index 5, which was (3,1) or wherever\n\nNew index 7: position of old index 6, which was (4,1) if it was there.\n\nEventually, when the tail is on (4,1), which is index 7.\n\nCurrently, after turn 19, index 7 is at (6,1) or similar.\n\nLet's find when index 7 is on (4,1).\n\nThe segment that is on (4,1) now is index 4. The tail is index 7. The distance in the snake is 3 segments behind.\n\nEach move, the occupant of (4,1) becomes the next segment closer to tail.\n\nAfter k moves, the segment at (4,1) will be index (4 + k), until index 7.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 19: after move, (4,1) occupied by index 5 (as above, if head moved U, but it depends on head move, but the relative shift is similar).\n\nActually, the cell (4,1) is occupied by a segment that is moving towards the tail position.\n\nThe number of moves until (4,1) is vacated is when the tail is on it and moves away.\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,2). The path to (4,1) is not direct, but since the snake is moving, the tail will follow the body.\n\nThe segment on (4,1) is index 4. Index 7 is tail. So there are 3 segments between, meaning it will take 3 moves for the tail to reach (4,1), but only if the snake doesn't change direction.\n\nFor instance, if the snake continues straight, after 3 moves, the tail will be where index 4 is now.\n\nBut the snake may turn.\n\nHowever, in general, it takes 3 moves for the tail to move to the current position of index 4, which is (4,1).\n\nCurrent turn 19, positions before move.\n\nAfter turn 19 move: the segment that was at (4,1) moves away, and index 5 moves to (4,1).\n\nAfter turn 20 move: index 5 moves away, index 6 moves to (4,1).\n\nAfter turn 21 move: index 6 moves away, index 7 moves to (4,1).\n\nAfter turn 22 move: if head moves and no eat, tail (index 7) moves away from (4,1), so (4,1) vacated.\n\nSo on turn 22, after the move, (4,1) is vacated, and food is still there if life span allows.\n\nFood life span: at turn 19, life span 10, so it will be there for 10 turns, from turn 19 to turn 28 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 19, life span is 10, meaning it has 10 turns left, including turn 19.\n\nAfter turn 19, life span decreases to 9.\n\nAfter turn 20, to 8, ..., after turn 28, it decreases to 0, and after that, it disappears, so on turn 29, it's gone.\n\nBut eating happens when head moves onto the food cell on that turn. So to eat, must move onto it on or before turn 28.\n\nSince life span 10 at turn 19, after turn 19, it has 9 left, so available on turn 20 with 9 left, ..., turn 28 with 1 left, turn 29 with 0, gone.\n\nSo must eat by turn 28.\n\n(4,1) will be vacated on turn 22 after the move, as above.\n\nThen on turn 22, (4,1) is free, and food is there, with life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 19, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 19: life span 9\n\nTurn 20: 8\n\nTurn 21: 7\n\nTurn 22: 6\n\nTurn 23: 5\n\n...\n\nTurn 28: 1\n\nTurn 29: 0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 22, after move, (4,1) is vacated, food is there with life span 6.\n\nThen head can move to (4,1) to eat it, but need to be able to reach it safely.\n\nNow, back to current turn 19, I need to choose a move that allows me to eventually eat the food and survive long-term.\n\nAlso, there might be other considerations, but currently only one food.\n\nThe food is positive, +1, so eating it is good, but I need to plan the path.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, so length increases, which might make movement harder.\n\nBut first, from current position (2,3), head direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then head at (2,4), direction U.\n\nFrom there, I can move U, L, R.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to (4,1) eventually.\n\n(4,1) is at x=4, y=1.\n\nCurrent head y=3, so I need to go down to y=1.\n\nBut direction is U, so moving up increases y.\n\nTo go down, I need to change direction.\n\nAlso, there are walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is near (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at bottom row, y=1.\n\ny=1 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are ok.\n\nSimilarly, x=4.\n\nNow, to reach (4,1), I need to have the head there after the food is vacated.\n\nVacated on turn 22.\n\nBut I need to move step by step.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 8 segments, so I need to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, but since we can't go there, playable area 6x6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom rows: y=1,2,3.\n\nHead at (2,3), moving up.\n\nIf I move up to (2,4), then I'm at (2,4), which is top-middle.\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (1,4), or right to (3,4), or up to (2,5), but y=5 is ok, or down, but current direction would be U, so I can move U, L, R, not D immediately.\n\nBut after moving, direction changes.\n\nIf I move left to (1,3) from current, then head at (1,3), which is left side.\n\nOr right to (3,3), center.\n\nNow, to reach (4,1), I need to go down and right.\n\nBut since the food is at (4,1) and will be free on turn 22, I should plan a path to be near there around turn 22.\n\nBut turn 22 is 3 turns from now, since current turn 19, after turn 19 move is turn 20, then 21, then 22.\n\nAfter turn 19 move, it's turn 20, positions updated.\n\nThen turn 20 move, turn 21 positions.\n\nThen turn 21 move, turn 22 positions, and after turn 22 move, (4,1) vacated.\n\nThen on turn 23, I can move to (4,1) to eat, if possible.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nCurrent turn 19: before move.\n\nAfter move, it's still turn 19? No, the move is part of the turn.\n\nTypically, in such games, a turn consists of moving.\n\nSo at turn t, we decide the move, then positions update for turn t.\n\nBut in the state, it's given at turn t before move.\n\nAfter we move, the state updates for the next turn.\n\nBut for the food, life span decreases at each turn, including when we move.\n\nThe description: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", so at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for movement.\n\nFor the vacating of (4,1), it happens after the move on turn 22.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nAt turn 19: state as given.\n\nWe choose action for turn 19.\n\nAfter moving, the positions update, and food life span decreases to 9, for example.\n\nThen turn 20 begins, with new state.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor (4,1) to be vacated: on turn 22, after the move, it is vacated.\n\nSo at the start of turn 22, before move, (4,1) is occupied by the tail, and when we move, the tail moves away, so after the move, it's vacated.\n\nThen at turn 23, we can move to (4,1) to eat the food.\n\nOn turn 22, before move, the food is still there, with some life span, and (4,1) is occupied by tail, so we cannot move there on turn 22 because it's occupied by tail, but we can move to tail only if it's safe, but the rule says we can move to the tail cell because the tail will move.\n\nBut for eating, if we move to a food cell, we eat it.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 22, before move, (4,1) has food and is occupied by tail.\n\nIf we move the head to (4,1), then head moves to tail position, which is allowed, and since we eat the food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move away; instead, a new segment is added.\n\nRules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, on turn 22, if the head moves to (4,1) which is tail, and eats the food, then the snake grows, so the tail remains where it is, but since head is moving to tail, after eating, the head is at (4,1), and the new tail is the old tail, but since it was eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the head and body are at the same position, collision.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the snake grows: the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nBut if the head moves to the current tail position to eat food there, then after eating, head is at that cell, and the new segment is added at the old tail position, which is the same cell, so head and new segment at same cell, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is dangerous to eat food that is on the tail cell.\n\nIn this case, on turn 22, if (4,1) is the tail and has food, and we move there, we die.\n\nTherefore, we should not eat it on the turn it is vacated; we should wait until the next turn or later when it's free.\n\nThe food can be eaten only when it is not occupied, and head moves to it.\n\nOn turn 22, after the move, (4,1) is vacated and food is there, so at turn 23, we can move to it to eat.\n\nSimilarly, any turn after it is vacated.\n\nNow, life span allows until turn 28.\n\nSo I need to be able to move to (4,1) on turn 23, 24, ..., 28.\n\nBut sooner is better in case something happens.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFirst, for turn 19, I need to choose a move that sets up for future access to (4,1).\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nCurrent options:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,4)\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction U.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (2,5), (1,4), or (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is top, y=5.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go down to y=1 and right to x=4.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be tricky.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (1,3)\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nThen I can go L to (1,2)? x=1, y=2, but (1,2) is not occupied? Current positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), etc., so (1,2) free? But y=2, x=1.\n\nBut moving L from (1,3) to (1,2) is possible, or U to (1,4), or D to (1,2)? Directions: from (1,3) with direction L, can move L (but x=1, L would be x=0, wall, so cannot), or U to (1,4), or D to (1,2), or R to (2,3), but R is opposite to L? Current direction L, so cannot move R, because no instant reverse.\n\nHead direction after move: if I move to (1,3) with L direction, then direction is L.\n\nThen possible moves: U (up, to (1,4)), D (down, to (1,2)), or L (left, to (0,3) but x=0 wall, so invalid), or R (right, to (2,3), but R is opposite to L, so cannot, because no instant reverse.\n\nSo from (1,3) with direction L, I can only move U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R from current to (3,3), direction R, then from (3,3) I can move U, D, or R to (4,3), etc.\n\nLet's list possible paths to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at bottom left, but x=4, y=1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is adjacent to (4,1) and (5,1), etc.\n\nNow, the snake body will shift, and on turn 22, (4,1) vacated.\n\nI need to have the head near (4,1) around turn 23 to move to it.\n\nFrom current (2,3), I can go right and down.\n\nFor example, if on turn 19 I move R to (3,3), then head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 20, I can move R to (4,3), or D to (3,2), or U to (3,4), etc.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), but (3,2) is currently occupied by body segment index 2, but after turn 19 move, if I move R to (3,3), let's see new positions.\n\nTurn 19 move R to (3,3):\n\nHead to (3,3)\n\nThen body:\n\nIndex 1: to (2,3)  // old head\n\nIndex 2: to (2,2)  // old index 1\n\nIndex 3: to (3,2)  // old index 2\n\nIndex 4: to (3,1)  // old index 3\n\nIndex 5: to (4,1)  // old index 4\n\nIndex 6: to (5,1)  // old index 5\n\nIndex 7: to (6,1)  // old index 6, new tail\n\n(6,2) vacated.\n\n(4,1) occupied by index 5.\n\nThen on turn 20, from (3,3) direction R, I can move R to (4,3), or U to (3,4), or D to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is now occupied by index 3? In new positions, index 3 is at (3,2), so if I move D to (3,2), it is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nBecause (3,2) has a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is at (6,1).\n\nSo moving to (3,2) is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (3,4) or R to (4,3) are safe, assuming no body there.\n\n(3,4) not occupied, (4,3) not occupied.\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go to (4,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (4,3), then I'm closer to x=4.\n\ny=3, need to go down to y=1.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move down to (4,2), but (4,2) is not occupied? Let's see the grid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall, not accessible.\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nBut we need to see future positions.\n\nPerhaps I should aim to be at (4,2) or something on turn 22 or 23.\n\nAnother option: from current (2,3), move L to (1,3), then I'm at left, and I can only move U or D, as L is invalid, R is opposite.\n\nIf move D to (1,2), then to (1,1), etc., but that might not help to reach (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, move U to (1,4), then to (1,5), etc., far from (4,1).\n\nSo moving L might not be efficient to reach the food.\n\nMove U to (2,4), then I can go to (2,5) or (1,4) or (3,4), all away from (4,1).\n\nBut I need to come down.\n\nPerhaps moving R is better to get closer.\n\nLet's think about the area near (4,1).\n\nThe cells around (4,1): (4,2) above, (3,1) left, (5,1) right, but (5,1) might be occupied, and (5,2) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\n(4,0) is wall, not accessible.\n\nSo accessible neighbors: (4,2), (3,1), (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is currently occupied by body, and later might be free.\n\nOn turn 23, when I want to move to (4,1), I need to be at a neighbor: (4,2), (3,1), or (5,1) on turn 22 after move.\n\nBut on turn 22 after move, (4,1) is vacated, so at turn 23 start, (4,1) is free with food.\n\nI need to be at a cell adjacent to (4,1) on turn 23 before move, so I can move to it.\n\nSo on turn 23, head should be at (4,2), (3,1), or (5,1) to move to (4,1).\n\n(5,1) might be risky because of the obstacle at (5,2), limiting movement.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nNow, (4,2) is above (4,1), and (3,1) is left, (5,1) right.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5, y=1, and (5,2) is wall, so from (5,1), I can only move U to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or L to (4,1), or D but y=1, D to y=0 wall, so only possible move from (5,1) is L to (4,1) or U but U to (5,2) wall, so only left to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1): y=1, x=3, can move U to (3,2), R to (4,1), or L to (2,1) if possible, D to wall.\n\nFrom (4,2): can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so only U, D, L.\n\nSo all neighbors are possible to move to (4,1), but (5,1) has only one choice, which might be risky if I'm forced there.\n\nBut in planning, I can choose.\n\nNow, to be at one of these on turn 23 before move.\n\nTurn 23 before move means after turn 22 move.\n\nCurrent turn 19, so 3 moves to turn 22.\n\nAfter turn 19 move: turn 20 state\n\nAfter turn 20 move: turn 21 state\n\nAfter turn 21 move: turn 22 state\n\nThen on turn 22, I move to set position for turn 23.\n\nThen on turn 23, I move to (4,1).\n\nBut on turn 22, after move, (4,1) is vacated, so at turn 22 state before move, (4,1) is occupied by tail.\n\nI need to move on turn 22 to a position such that on turn 23 I can move to (4,1).\n\nSo for turn 22, I need to be at a cell where from there, I can move to (4,1) on turn 23.\n\nThat means on turn 22 before move, I need to be at a neighbor of (4,1), so that after moving to that neighbor or something.\n\nLet's clarify the turn timing.\n\nAt turn t, state is given before move.\n\nI choose action for turn t.\n\nAfter moving, state updates for turn t+1.\n\nFor turn 22: before move, state is such that (4,1) is occupied by tail (as we established).\n\nI choose action for turn 22, move to some cell, then after move, (4,1) is vacated, and positions update for turn 23.\n\nAt turn 23, before move, (4,1) is free with food, and I can choose to move to it.\n\nSo to move to (4,1) on turn 23, at turn 23 before move, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (4,1), so I can choose to move there.\n\nTherefore, after turn 22 move, on turn 23 state, head should be at (4,2), (3,1), or (5,1).\n\nSo for turn 22, I need to move to one of these cells.\n\nBut on turn 22 before move, I am somewhere, and I move to, say, (4,2), for example.\n\nThen on turn 23, I am at (4,2), and I can move D to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I need to plan that on turn 22, I move to a neighbor of (4,1).\n\nThe neighbors are (4,2), (3,1), (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is risky because it's at the edge, and with the obstacle, it might be hard to escape after eating, but first, let's get to eating.\n\nAlso, (3,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nNow, from current turn 19, I have 3 moves to reach a position where on turn 22, I can move to one of these neighbors.\n\nTurn 19 move: to some position\n\nTurn 20 move: to another\n\nTurn 21 move: to another\n\nTurn 22 move: to a neighbor of (4,1)\n\nThen turn 23 move: to (4,1) to eat.\n\nNow, current position (2,3).\n\nI need to be near (4,1) in 3 moves.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if I move R to (3,3) on turn 19.\n\nThen on turn 20, from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3) or D to (3,2) but (3,2) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 19 move to (3,3), positions as above: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\n(3,2) is occupied by index 3, so I cannot move to (3,2) on turn 20.\n\nFrom (3,3) direction R, I can move to (4,3) or (3,4).\n\nSay move to (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 21, from (4,3), direction R, I can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), or R to (5,3) but (5,3) is free? And not wall.\n\n(4,2) is free, no body, no wall.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so from (4,3), I can move to (4,4), (4,2), or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is x=5,y=3.\n\nIf I move D to (4,2) on turn 21, then head at (4,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,2), I can move to (4,1) directly? But on turn 22, before move, (4,1) is occupied by tail, so I cannot move to it because it's occupied, and if I try, collision.\n\nOn turn 22, before move, (4,1) has food and is occupied by tail.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) from (4,2), I would be moving to tail position, which is allowed, but if I eat the food, I die because of tail reward danger.\n\nSpecifically, head adjacent to tail (since (4,2) adjacent to (4,1)? (4,2) and (4,1) are adjacent vertically.\n\nAnd tail is at (4,1), with positive food.\n\nIf I move from (4,2) to (4,1) on turn 22, I eat the food, but then since I grow, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail at (4,1), collision.\n\nTherefore, I should not move to (4,1) on turn 22; instead, on turn 22, I should move to a position where on turn 23 I can move to (4,1).\n\nIn this case, from (4,2) on turn 22, I can move to (4,1) on turn 23.\n\nBut on turn 22, I need to be at (4,2) before move, so that after moving to, say, stay or something, but on turn 22, I need to move to a cell that is a neighbor of (4,1) for turn 23.\n\nLet's set the turn.\n\nOn turn 21, after move, I am at some position, say (4,2), then on turn 22, I am at (4,2), before move.\n\nI can choose to move to (4,1), but as above, it's dangerous because of tail reward.\n\nI should move to another cell, but I need to be at a neighbor for turn 23.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 22, I can move to (4,3), (3,2), or (4,1) but (4,1) risky.\n\nIf I move to (4,3), then on turn 23, I am at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (4,1), so I cannot move directly to (4,1); I need to go to (4,2) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,2) on turn 22, then on turn 23 at (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (4,2), etc., not directly to (4,1) unless I am at (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nTo be at a neighbor of (4,1) on turn 23 before move, I need to move to that neighbor on turn 22.\n\nFor example, on turn 22, I move to (4,2), then on turn 23, I am at (4,2), and I can move D to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, on turn 22, I move to (3,1), then on turn 23 at (3,1), move R to (4,1).\n\nOr move to (5,1) on turn 22, then on turn 23 move L to (4,1).\n\nBut on turn 22, when I move to (4,2), for example, is (4,2) free? On turn 22 before move, what is the state.\n\nLet's simulate the positions leading to turn 22.\n\nFirst, assume on turn 19 I move R to (3,3).\n\nTurn 19: move R to (3,3)\n\nNew state turn 20:\nHead: (3,3), direction R\nBody: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail at (6,1)\n(4,1) occupied by index 5? Positions: index 1: (2,3), index 2: (2,2), index 3: (3,2), index 4: (3,1), index 5: (4,1), index 6: (5,1), index 7: (6,1) tail\nFood at (4,1) with life span 9 (after turn 19)\n\nTurn 20: move to (4,3)\nFrom (3,3) direction R, move R to (4,3)\nNew head (4,3), direction R\nBody shifts:\nIndex 1: to (3,3)  // old head\nIndex 2: to (2,3)  // old index 1\nIndex 3: to (2,2)  // old index 2\nIndex 4: to (3,2)  // old index 3\nIndex 5: to (3,1)  // old index 4\nIndex 6: to (4,1)  // old index 5\nIndex 7: to (5,1)  // old index 6, new tail\n(6,1) vacated\n(4,1) occupied by index 6\nFood life span 8\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) direction R, move D to (4,2)\n(4,2) is free? No body there, not wall.\nNew head (4,2), direction D\nBody shifts:\nIndex 1: to (4,3)  // old head\nIndex 2: to (3,3)  // old index 1\nIndex 3: to (2,3)  // old index 2\nIndex 4: to (2,2)  // old index 3\nIndex 5: to (3,2)  // old index 4\nIndex 6: to (3,1)  // old index 5\nIndex 7: to (4,1)  // old index 6, new tail\n(5,1) vacated\n(4,1) occupied by index 7, the tail\nFood life span 7\n\nNow turn 22: before move, head at (4,2), direction D\nPositions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail\n(4,1) is tail with food.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) on turn 22, I would eat the food but die because of collision with new tail.\n\nSo I should not move to (4,1).\n\nInstead, I can move to another cell, say to (3,2) or (4,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or (4,1) not.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2) direction D: can move D to (4,1) but risky, L to (3,2), U to (4,3), R to (5,2) invalid.\n\nSo move L to (3,2) or U to (4,3).\n\nSay move L to (3,2) on turn 22.\n\nThen new head (3,2), direction L\nBody shifts: head to (3,2), but (3,2) was occupied by index 5? Current positions before move: index 0: (4,2), index 1: (4,3), index 2: (3,3), index 3: (2,3), index 4: (2,2), index 5: (3,2), index 6: (3,1), index 7: (4,1) tail\n\nMove head to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by index 5, which is a body segment, not tail, so moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body.\n\nOh, problem.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by index 5, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by index 1.\n\nIndex 1 at (4,3), so occupied, cannot move.\n\nD to (4,1) risky.\n\nR to (5,2) invalid.\n\nSo no safe move from (4,2) on turn 22!\n\nBecause all adjacent cells are occupied or wall.\n\n(4,1) occupied by tail, (4,3) occupied by body index 1, (3,2) occupied by index 5, (5,2) wall.\n\nSo I am trapped at (4,2), no safe move, I die on turn 22.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,2) on turn 21 was a mistake because it leads to a dead end.\n\nIn this path, by moving down to (4,2) on turn 21, I got stuck.\n\nInstead, on turn 21, from (4,3), I could move elsewhere.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) on turn 21, move to (5,3) instead of (4,2).\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) direction R, move R to (5,3)\n(5,3) is free, not occupied, not wall.\nNew head (5,3), direction R\nBody shifts:\nIndex 1: to (4,3)\nIndex 2: to (3,3)\nIndex 3: to (2,3)\nIndex 4: to (2,2)\nIndex 5: to (3,2)\nIndex 6: to (3,1)\nIndex 7: to (4,1)  // tail\n(5,1) vacated earlier? In turn 20 state, tail was at (5,1)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 20 move to (4,3):\nState turn 21 before move: head (4,3), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (5,1)? No.\n\nFrom turn 20 after move:\nHead (4,3)\nIndex 1: (3,3)\nIndex 2: (2,3)\nIndex 3: (2,2)\nIndex 4: (3,2)\nIndex 5: (3,1)\nIndex 6: (4,1)\nIndex 7: (5,1)  // tail\n\n(4,1) occupied by index 6.\n\nThen turn 21 move to (5,3):\nNew head (5,3), direction R\nIndex 1: to (4,3)\nIndex 2: to (3,3)\nIndex 3: to (2,3)\nIndex 4: to (2,2)\nIndex 5: to (3,2)\nIndex 6: to (3,1)\nIndex 7: to (4,1)  // new tail\n\n(5,1) vacated.\n\n(4,1) occupied by tail index 7.\n\nFood life span 7.\n\nNow turn 22: head at (5,3), direction R\nPositions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail\n\n(4,1) is tail with food.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, L to (4,3), or R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is occupied by index 1, so cannot move L.\n\nR to (6,3): x=6, y=3, not wall, not occupied? Positions have (2,3) etc, but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nU to (5,4): free.\n\nD to (5,2) invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nSay move R to (6,3) on turn 22.\n\nThen new head (6,3), direction R\nBody shifts: index 1 to (5,3), index 2 to (4,3), index 3 to (3,3), index 4 to (2,3), index 5 to (2,2), index 6 to (3,2), index 7 to (3,1)  // new tail, (4,1) vacated\n\n(4,1) vacated, food there with life span 6.\n\nNow on turn 23, head at (6,3), which is not adjacent to (4,1). (6,3) to (4,1) is not adjacent, so I cannot move to (4,1) directly.\n\nI am far away.\n\nIf on turn 22 I move U to (5,4), similar, far.\n\nSo not good for eating the food.\n\nTo eat the food, I need to be closer on turn 22.\n\nPerhaps on turn 19, instead of moving R, I should move U or L, but L might be worse.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 19, move U to (2,4).\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction U.\n\nThen I can move to (2,5) or (1,4) or (3,4).\n\nBut that takes me away from (4,1).\n\nThen it might be hard to come down in time.\n\nPerhaps I should not aim for the food immediately, but think about survival first.\n\nBut the food is positive, so eating it is good, but with the long snake, space is limited.\n\nThe grid is 6x6, snake length 8, so only 36-8=28 cells free, but with obstacle, 27 free cells.\n\nBut snake can move.\n\nBut in the bottom left, it might be crowded.\n\nPerhaps I should move to open space.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), move U to (2,4), then to (2,5), then to (3,5), etc., to the top-right, where there is more space.\n\nThen the tail will move, and (4,1) will be vacated later, but I can come back when it's free.\n\nBut life span is 10 turns, so I have time until turn 28.\n\nOn turn 22 it will be vacated, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut the earlier I eat, the better, in case other food spawns or something, but here only one food.\n\nAlso, after eating, I grow, so longer snake, harder to move.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating positive food is good.\n\nBut prioritizing survival, so I should avoid risky situations.\n\nIn the earlier path, when I moved to (4,2) on turn 21, I got stuck on turn 22.\n\nSo to avoid that, I should not go to (4,2) when the tail is at (4,1).\n\nFor turn 19, I should move in a way that on turn 22, I am in a position to move to a safe cell near (4,1).\n\nPerhaps move L to (1,3) on turn 19.\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 20, I can move U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n\nSay move D to (1,2).\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 21, from (1,2), direction D, I can move D to (1,1), or L invalid, R to (2,2), or U to (1,3) but U opposite to D?

At turn 23, food life span: at turn 19:10, turn20:9, t21:8, t22:7, after t22 move, life span 6, so at t23, life span 6.\n\nI have until turn 28 to eat, so 6 turns, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nHowever, for the current decision, on turn 19, all moves are safe, but moving R might be better to be closer to the right side.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (5,2), the bottom right might be risky.\n\nPerhaps for turn 19, I should move U to (2,4) to go to open space at top.\n\nThen from there, I can man uver to come down later.\n\nSince the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but for the output, I need to provide actions starting from turn 19.\n\nBut I don't have to specify all, but for the box, I think I need to provide the action for turn 19 and perhaps a few more.\n\nBut the format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so for turn 19, 20, 21, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide the first move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 19, moving U is safer to avoid the crowded bottom.\n\nLet's check if moving R is safe with a different path.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 19, move R to (3,3)\n\nThen on turn 20, move U to (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 21, move L to (2,4) or something, but let's see.\n\nI think for long-term survival, moving up or right is better than left.\n\nSince head direction is U, moving U continues the direction, which might be smoother.\n\nBut let's choose to move U on turn 19.\n\nThen for the action.\n\nBut I need to provide multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a sequence.\n\nBut since the state may change, I should only provide for the current turn and think ahead.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions for the turns.\n\nBut for this response, I need to output the actions starting from turn 19.\n\nLet's assume I move U on turn 19.\n\nThen for turn 20, from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5) or L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n\nSay move U to (2,5) to go to top.\n\nThen turn 21, from (2,5), move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n\nSay move U to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 22, from (2,6), move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6), since U invalid, D occupied.\n\nSay move R to (3,6).\n\nThen on turn 23, from (3,6), I can start moving down to reach the food later.\n\nBut let's not specify all, as it might not be optimal.\n\nPerhaps for the food, since it's under the body, and I can eat it later, it's fine.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating it is +1.\n\nBut with the long snake, it might be risky to go back.\n\nAnother thought: the tail is at (6,2), and when it moves, (4,1) will be vacated, but the snake is long, so the body is behind.\n\nPerhaps I should move in a way that the tail moves faster, but I can't control that directly.\n\nI think for turn 19, I'll move U to (2,4) to go to open space.\n\nSo action for turn 19: U\n\nThen for the output, I need to provide for turn 19 and subsequent turns, but since I don't know the state, I can only provide for turn 19 for now, but the format says to provide for multiple turns.\n\nLook at the answer format: \\boxed{ Turn 19: action, Turn 20: action, ... }\n\nBut I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a plan for a few turns.\n\nSince the state doesn't change except by my actions, I can simulate.\n\nBut there might be other food spawning, but not mentioned, so only this food.\n\nSo for now, only this food.\n\nI think I should move R on turn 19 to (3,3), then on turn 20 move to (4,3), then on turn 21 move to (4,4) or (5,3), to stay away from the bottom.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 19: R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3) move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) move U to (4,4) or R to (5,3)\n\nSay move U to (4,4)\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,4) I can move to (4,5) or (3,4) or (5,4), etc.\n\nAnd (4,1) will be vacated, and I can go down later.\n\nBut to eat the food, on turn 23 or later, I need to go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), then to (4,2), then to (4,1), but on turn 23, from (4,4) to (4,1) is three moves down, so on turn 23 move to (4,3), turn 24 to (4,2), turn 25 to (4,1), but on turn 25, food life span: at turn 19:10, t20:9, t21:8, t22:7, t23:6, t24:5, t25:4, so still available.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut at (4,2), I need to ensure it's safe when I go there.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut for now, for turn 19, I'll choose to move R.\n\nSo action turn 19: R\n\nThen for turn 20, from (3,3), move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) move U to (4,4)\n\netc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide a few turns.\n\nSince the food life span is long, I can eat it later.\n\nBut to start, let's say:\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nTurn 20: R ( to (4,3) )\n\nTurn 21: U ( to (4,4) )\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 19: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,3) direction R, move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,3) direction R, move U to (4,4) direction U\n\nThen Turn 22: from (4,4) direction U, can move U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4), etc.\n\nSay move U to (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor the box, I need to provide the actions.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I can provide actions for turn 19 to 23 or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI think I should provide the action for turn 19 first.\n\nSince the user asked for the AI to play, I need to output the sequence.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps on turn 19, move D, but current direction U, move D is opposite, not allowed, so cannot.\n\nOnly U, L, R.\n\nI think moving R is reasonable.\n\nOr moving U.\n\nLet's choose R.\n\nSo for turn 19: R\n\nThen for turn 20, based on state, but I have to provide.\n\nI'll provide a sequence.\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\n etc.\n\nBut at turn 22, (4,1) is vacated, but I am at (4,4) or something, not nearby.\n\nBut I can adjust later.\n\nFor the food, I can eat it around turn 25.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: R (right)\nTurn 20: R (right)\nTurn 21: U (up)\nTurn 22: U (up)\n}\n\nBut turn 22 U to (4,5) or something.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake long, I might need to loop or something.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nTo be safe, on turn 19, move U to (2,4), then to (2,5), then to (2,6), then to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI'll go with moving right to explore.\n\nSo final decision.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (4,1) while ensuring long-term survival, I must think 5+ turns ahead (from turn 19 to at least turn 24). The food at (4,1) has a value of +1 and a life span of 10, meaning it will disappear after turn 28 (life span decreases each turn, including turn 19). However, the food is currently under the snake's body at position index 4 and can only be eaten once the cell is vacated and the head moves onto it. Based on the snake's movement, (4,1) will be vacated after the move on turn 22, making the food available for eating from turn 23 onwards.\n\n- **Current State (Turn 19)**: Snake head at (2,3) with direction U. Snake length is 8. Grid borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and there is an internal obstacle at (5,2). The only food is at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 10.\n- **Key Risks**: \n  - Moving directly to (4,1) before turn 23 is dangerous or impossible due to body occupation.\n  - On turn 22, (4,1) is occupied by the tail; eating food on the tail cell causes collision (Tail Reward Danger).\n  - The snake is long (8 segments) in a 6x6 grid with obstacles, so open space is limited. Moving towards the top-right (e.g., (4,4) or higher) provides more maneuvering room and avoids the crowded bottom-left.\n  - After eating, the snake grows to length 9, increasing collision risk. Prioritize paths with escape routes.\n- **Path to Food**: (4,1) will be vacated on turn 22. To eat on turn 23, the head must be at a safe adjacent cell—(3,1), (4,2), or (5,1)—on turn 23 before moving. However, (5,1) is near the obstacle (5,2) and may limit movement, so (3,1) or (4,2) are safer. Given the current position, eating by turn 23 is infeasible without high risk, so aim to eat around turn 24-25 when the head can approach safely after vacating.\n- **Movement Plan (Turns 19-23)**:\n  - **Turn 19 (current)**: Move right (R) to (3,3). This avoids the left corner and positions the snake closer to the center for flexibility. Direction becomes R.\n  - **Turn 20**: Move right (R) to (4,3). This continues toward open space, away from the body-cluttered bottom. Direction becomes R.\n  - **Turn 21**: Move up (U) to (4,4). This reaches a safer area with more space (top-right), reducing immediate collision risks. Direction becomes U.\n  - **Turn 22**: Move up (U) to (4,5). This maximizes distance from the vacating food cell and avoids turn 22 risks. (4,1) is vacated after this move. Direction becomes U.\n  - **Turn 23**: Move left (L) to (3,5). This starts the descent toward (4,1) while staying in open space. From here, plan to reach (4,1) by turn 25 (e.g., via (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1)), which is before the food's expiration (life span 5 on turn 23, expires after turn 28).\n  \nThis plan prioritizes survival by:\n- Avoiding the bottom-left until (4,1) is safe and accessible.\n- Gaining space to maneuver the long snake.\n- Allowing a safe path to the food by turn 25 with multiple options.\n- Minimizing reverse moves to prevent trapping.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns 19 to 23 are as follows. Beyond turn 23, the plan can adapt based on the state (e.g., new food spawns), but this sequence ensures progress toward eating the food while staying safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 20: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 21: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 22: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 23: L (left)\n}",

        "step": 20,
        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 20.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,3), and the body segments are at (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,3).\n\nFood: only one food item at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9. But life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. Since it's turn 20, and life span 9, it will disappear after 8 more turns? Let me clarify the life span.\n\nThe food has life span N, and it decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after min(L, something) but actually, it should disappear when the countdown reaches 0. Life span is given as 9 at turn 20, so after turn 20, it will have 8 turns left, then 7, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, at turn 20, life span 9 means it has 9 turns left including turn 20. After turn 20, it has 8 turns left, and so on. It will be gone after turn 28 (since 20 + 8 = 28? Let's think: if it appears at some turn, life span N, it lasts for N turns from that point.\n\nBut here, it's given at turn 20 with life span 9, so it was spawned earlier. The countdown decreases each turn, so at turn 20, it has life span 9, meaning it can be eaten for the next 9 turns? No.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So, for example, if food spawns at turn T with life span N, at turn T, life span is N, at turn T+1, it's N-1, ..., at turn T + (N-1), it's 1, and at turn T + N, it disappears (so not available on turn T+N).\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, life span 9, so it was spawned at turn 20 - (9 - something), I don't know when it spawned, but for decision, I care about how many turns it will be available. At turn 20, life span 9, so after turn 20, it will be available for 8 more turns? Let's see:\n\n- Turn 20: life span 9, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 21: life span 8, can be eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 28: life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 29: life span 0, disappears, cannot be eaten\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it means it has L turns left including the current one. So it will be available until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n\nFor this food at (4,1): at turn 20, life span 9, so it can be eaten from turn 20 to turn 28 (inclusive), and disappears at turn 29. So 9 turns available including turn 20.\n\nBut in the state, it says life span 9 at turn 20, so turns left: 9, meaning it can be eaten for 9 more turns starting from now.\n\nNow, the food is at (4,1). Looking at snake positions: (3,3) head, then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (4,1) is occupied by the snake's body! Specifically, it's the 6th segment or something. Positions: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1). So (4,1) is the 5th segment (since 0-based, position 5 is (4,1)).\n\nBut food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n\n1. The body moves away, and\n\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nSo, since the body is on (4,1), and food is there, but to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (4,1), and then later the head moves to (4,1) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, at turn 20, head is at (3,3), direction right. Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be opposite direction? Rules say \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is R (right), so moving left (L) would be reverse, which is not allowed. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nNow, coordinates: head at (3,3). Moving:\n\n- U: (3,4)\n\n- D: (3,2)\n\n- R: (4,3)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nFirst, walls: border walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nFor U to (3,4): y=4, which is within 0 to 7, x=3 within 0 to7, no wall there. (5,2) is obstacle, but (3,4) not (5,2), so ok.\n\nFor D to (3,2): (3,2) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nFor R to (4,3): (4,3) within bounds, not wall.\n\nNow, body collisions: snake body segments are at (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). After moving, the tail will also move, but when we move, the head moves to new position, and the tail segment is removed only if no food eaten. Since we're moving, and if we don't eat food, the tail moves forward.\n\nCollision: head cannot move to a cell occupied by the body, except that it can move to the tail cell because the tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, for possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,4): is (3,4) occupied by body? Current positions: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). (3,4) not in list, so safe.\n\n- D to (3,2): (3,2) is a body segment, position index 3. But (3,2) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1). So moving to (3,2) would collide with body, which is deadly, except if it's the tail, but it's not the tail. The tail is at (6,1), so (3,2) is an internal body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nConfirm: the positions list is head first, then body, so (3,3) head, then (2,3) segment 1, (2,2) seg2, (3,2) seg3, (3,1) seg4, (4,1) seg5, (5,1) seg6, (6,1) seg7 (tail).\n\nSo (3,2) is segment 3, not tail. Therefore, moving to (3,2) would have head collide with body segment, which is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, for R to (4,3): (4,3) is not in the current positions, so safe.\n\n(4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nD to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied, so not safe.\n\nNow, the food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied by segment 5. To eat this food, we need the body to move away, and then head to move there.\n\nBut currently, head is at (3,3), so it might take several moves.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,1), food at (4,1), not on tail, so not directly applicable.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 20.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (L not allowed since reverse)\n\nBut D to (3,2) is occupied, so not possible. Only U and R are safe moves.\n\nU: to (3,4)\n\nR: to (4,3)\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), new head position (3,4), then body follows: the new position list would be [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] and tail at (6,1) moves off? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after move U:\n\n- Head to (3,4)\n\n- Then segment 1 (was (2,3)) moves to (3,3) which was head\n\n- Segment 2 (was (2,2)) moves to (2,3) which was seg1\n\n- Segment 3 (was (3,2)) moves to (2,2) which was seg2\n\n- Segment 4 (was (3,1)) moves to (3,2) which was seg3\n\n- Segment 5 (was (4,1)) moves to (3,1) which was seg4\n\n- Segment 6 (was (5,1)) moves to (4,1) which was seg5\n\n- Segment 7 (tail was (6,1)) moves to (5,1) which was seg6, so new tail at (5,1)\n\nPositions after move U: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). Food is at (4,1), which is now occupied by the body again? (4,1) is position index 6 in new list? New positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (5,1). So (4,1) is index 6, body segment.\n\nFood is at (4,1), still under body.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3): head to (4,3), then:\n\n- Seg1 to (3,3)\n\n- Seg2 to (2,3)\n\n- Seg3 to (2,2)\n\n- Seg4 to (3,2)\n\n- Seg5 to (3,1)\n\n- Seg6 to (4,1)\n\n- Seg7 to (5,1), new tail at (5,1)\n\nPositions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\n(4,1) is index 6, body, food still there.\n\nNow, the food at (4,1) has life span 9 at turn 20, so it will last until turn 28.\n\nBut to eat it, we need the body to move away from (4,1) so it's free, then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (4,1) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nThe snake is moving, so positions change each turn.\n\nAlso, after moving, the tail moves, so cells might free up.\n\nIn the move R case, after moving to (4,3), (4,1) is still occupied by segment 6.\n\nSimilarly for U.\n\nBut over time, as the snake moves, the body might leave (4,1).\n\nLet's see the current path: from positions, the snake was at (3,3) head, came from left since previous was (2,3), so it moved right to (3,3) from (2,3)? Positions: [(3,3), (2,3), ...] so head at (3,3), previous was (2,3), so it moved right from (2,3) to (3,3), so direction R.\n\nNow, to free (4,1), which is currently occupied, we need the snake to move such that that segment moves away.\n\nSince the snake moves, each turn the tail moves forward, so the cell (6,1) was tail, and after move, it moves to (5,1) or something, but (4,1) is not tail, it's a body segment.\n\nTo free (4,1), we need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (4,1) moves to another cell.\n\nFor example, if we move in a certain direction, the body shifts.\n\nBut it's part of the body, so when the snake moves, all segments shift, so the cell (4,1) will be vacated only if the segment that was there moves away and no new segment comes, but since the snake moves as a chain, when the head moves, the tail end is removed, and each segment moves to the previous position of the one before it.\n\nSo for a body cell to be vacated, it must be that the segment there is the tail and we don't eat food, so tail moves away and the cell is empty.\n\nOtherwise, for internal segments, when they move, they leave their cell, but the next segment moves into it immediately, so the cell is never free unless it's the tail position.\n\nSpecifically, when the snake moves without eating, the tail cell is vacated, and all other body cells are occupied by the next segment.\n\nIn this case, (4,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1). So (4,1) will only be vacated when the tail reaches that position or something.\n\nLet's think about the tail movement.\n\nCurrent tail at (6,1).\n\nIf we move without eating, tail moves to (5,1) after move, as in above.\n\nBut (4,1) is occupied by a segment that will move to (3,1) or something when head moves.\n\nFor example, if head moves U to (3,4), then as above, the segment that was at (4,1) moves to (3,1) (which was seg4), so (4,1) is now occupied by the segment that was at (5,1), which moves to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, in move R, the segment at (4,1) moves to (3,1), and (4,1) is occupied by the segment that was at (5,1).\n\nSo (4,1) remains occupied as long as it's not the tail position.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1), so when we move, the tail moves to (5,1), then to (4,1) after another move, and so on.\n\nLet's see how the tail moves.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), tail (6,1)\n\nAfter one move without eating:\n\n- If move U: head to (3,4), then body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)  new tail at (5,1)\n\n- If move R: head to (4,3), body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)  new tail at (5,1)\n\nIn both cases, the cell (4,1) is still occupied, by the segment that was previously at (4,1) or (5,1), but in new list, (4,1) is occupied.\n\nFor example after move U: positions include (4,1) at index 6\n\nAfter move R: positions include (4,1) at index 6\n\nAfter another move, say from there.\n\nThe tail is moving towards (4,1). Current tail at (6,1), after one move, tail at (5,1), after second move, tail at (4,1), and so on.\n\nSince the snake is moving, and we're not eating, the tail will eventually reach (4,1) in a few turns.\n\nLet's calculate: from (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) etc.\n\nCurrent tail at (6,1)\n\nAfter one move without eating, tail at (5,1)\n\nAfter two moves, tail at (4,1)\n\nAfter three moves, tail at (3,1) or something.\n\nBut when tail is at (4,1), if we don't eat food, it moves away, freeing (4,1).\n\nBut the food is at (4,1), so when the tail moves from (4,1), it becomes free, then we can move head there to eat it.\n\nCurrently, tail at (6,1)\n\nDistance to (4,1): (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1), so 2 moves to have tail at (4,1).\n\nAfter two moves without eating, tail will be at (4,1), and when we move on the third turn, the tail moves away from (4,1), freeing it, and if head moves to (4,1) at that time, we can eat the food.\n\nBut we need to plan the path.\n\nAlso, head is at (3,3), (4,1) is at (4,1), which is down-right from head.\n\nHead at (3,3), food at (4,1), so Δx = +1, Δy = -2.\n\nSo we need to move down and right.\n\nBut we have to avoid walls and body.\n\nMoreover, life span is 9, so we have time, but we should also consider other food, but there is only one food now.\n\nThe state has only one food listed.\n\nSo food at (4,1), value 1.\n\nNow, for turn 20, I need to choose action.\n\nPossible safe moves: U or R.\n\nD is not safe because (3,2) is occupied.\n\nL is not allowed.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), head goes up, away from food.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), head goes right, closer to food in x, but y is higher.\n\n(4,3) to (4,1) is down two steps.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nAfter move R to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) is still occupied by body.\n\nNow, from there, possible moves: head at (4,3), direction was R to get there, so current direction R? After moving, the head direction changes based on the move.\n\nThe state gives head direction before move, I think. \"Snake Head Direction: R\" at turn 20, before move.\n\nAfter we move, the new direction is the move we made.\n\nFor next turn, we cannot reverse the new direction.\n\nFor turn 20, after moving R, new head position (4,3), and head direction now R.\n\nThen for turn 21, possible moves: from (4,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nBut L is left, which is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed. Reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can move U, D, R.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\nU (4,4): within bounds, not wall, not occupied? Current positions after move: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). (4,4) not in list, so safe.\n\nD (4,2): (4,2) not in positions, but there is an internal obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is not (5,2), so should be ok. Is (4,2) occupied? Positions have (4,1), (4,3), but not (4,2), so empty.\n\nR (5,3): (5,3) not in positions, and not wall, but internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,3) is different, so should be ok.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so (5,3) is not wall, it's free.\n\nWalls: border and internal (5,2), so (5,3) is free.\n\nNow, if we want to go to (4,1), from (4,3), we can go D to (4,2), then from there D to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is currently occupied, so we need to free it first.\n\nAs I thought earlier, after two moves, tail will be at (4,1).\n\nCurrent after turn 20 move R: positions (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nAfter turn 21, if we move without eating, say to (4,2) or something.\n\nFirst, let's plan to free (4,1).\n\nTail at (5,1) after turn 20.\n\nAfter one move without eating, tail moves to (4,1)? When we move on turn 21, if no eat, head moves, tail moves to the previous position of seg before tail.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,3), then seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (3,1), seg6 (4,1), tail (5,1)\n\nAfter move, if no eat, head to new position, then seg1 to (4,3), seg2 to (3,3), seg3 to (2,3), seg4 to (2,2), seg5 to (3,2), seg6 to (3,1), tail to (4,1)\n\nSo tail is now at (4,1)\n\nThen after another move on turn 22, if no eat, tail moves away from (4,1) to, say, depending on move.\n\nFor example, if on turn 22 we move and no eat, tail moves to the position of seg6, which is (3,1) or something.\n\nBut at that point, (4,1) is free, and we can move head to (4,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut we need to have head adjacent to (4,1) at that time.\n\nAlso, the food must be there, life span ok.\n\nNow, life span: at turn 20, life span 9, so available until turn 28.\n\nTurns: turn 20, life span 9 → available turn 20 to 28.\n\nTurn 21: life span 8, etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 20 choice.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen new positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail (5,1)\n\nFrom here, to reach (4,1), it might take longer, since head is at (3,4), food at (4,1), which is down-right.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): direction after move U, so head direction up? After moving U, new direction U.\n\nSo for turn 21, possible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse, so cannot move D (down, opposite to U), so can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nNow, (4,1) is occupied, and tail at (5,1), after one move, tail at (4,1), etc., similar to before.\n\nBut head is farther.\n\nOption 2: Move R to (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nThen as above, positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nNow turn 21, from (4,3), direction R, so can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nTo go towards (4,1), we can move D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free, as positions don't have it.\n\nAfter moving D to (4,2), new head (4,2), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  and tail moves to? Previous tail was (5,1), but after move, segments: head to (4,2), then seg1 to (4,3), seg2 to (3,3), seg3 to (2,3), seg4 to (2,2), seg5 to (3,2), seg6 to (3,1), tail to (4,1)? Let's list:\n\nBefore move: positions (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) indices 0 to 7.\n\nAfter move D to (4,2): new head (4,2)\n\nThen segment 1 (was index 1 (3,3)) moves to (4,3) which was head\n\nSegment 2 (was index 2 (2,3)) moves to (3,3) which was seg1\n\nSegment 3 (was index 3 (2,2)) moves to (2,3) which was seg2\n\nSegment 4 (was index 4 (3,2)) moves to (2,2) which was seg3\n\nSegment 5 (was index 5 (3,1)) moves to (3,2) which was seg4\n\nSegment 6 (was index 6 (4,1)) moves to (3,1) which was seg5\n\nSegment 7 (tail was index 7 (5,1)) moves to (4,1) which was seg6\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  tail at (4,1)\n\nNow (4,1) is tail position.\n\nFood is at (4,1), so (4,1) has food under it, but it's occupied by tail.\n\nTo eat, we need to move so that tail moves away, freeing (4,1), and then head moves to it.\n\nBut tail is at (4,1), so on the next move, if we don't eat, tail will move to the previous position of seg6, which is (3,1) in this case? After this move, positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nOn turn 22, if we move without eating, head moves to new position, tail moves to (3,1) which was seg6.\n\nSpecifically: when moving, head to new pos, then each body segment to previous pos of previous.\n\nSo after move, tail is removed, so (4,1) is vacated, and tail moves to (3,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is free after the tail moves.\n\nThen, if head moves to (4,1), we can eat the food.\n\nBut head is currently at (4,2), which is adjacent to (4,1) down.\n\nSo on turn 22, if we move D to (4,1), we can eat the food, since (4,1) is free.\n\nBut we need to check if it's safe.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 20: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: move D to (4,2) — now head at (4,2), tail at (4,1) with food under it.\n\nTurn 22: move D to (4,1) — now, when we move to (4,1), it was free? After turn 21 move, positions have tail at (4,1), but after the move on turn 22, when head moves to (4,1), at that instant, (4,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt the start of turn 22, positions are: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is occupied by tail.\n\nNow, when we move, if we choose to move to (4,1), we are moving head to a cell occupied by the tail.\n\nBut according to rules, it is allowed to move to the tail cell, because the tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAnd for eating, if we move head to a food cell, we eat it, as long as it's not the tail reward danger case.\n\nHere, moving to (4,1) which has food and is tail.\n\nIf we eat it, since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so tail doesn't move, we add a new segment.\n\nBut there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, at turn 22 start, head is at (4,2), tail at (4,1), so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nTail cell (4,1) has positive food (value 1).\n\nIf we eat it, that is, move to (4,1), then we eat the food, length increases, but the new tail will be at (4,1), and head is also at (4,1)? No.\n\nWhen we eat food, we move head to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail stays, and snake grows.\n\nBut in terms of positions: suppose before move, head at H, tail at T.\n\nMove head to new cell F (food), then add a new segment at T, so positions: new head F, then previous head, body, and new tail at T.\n\nIn this case, if we move to tail cell which has food.\n\nHere, head at (4,2), tail at (4,1) with food.\n\nIf we move to (4,1), we are moving head to the tail cell.\n\nSince we eat food, head moves to (4,1), and because we ate food, we don't remove the tail; instead, we add a new segment at the current tail position, which is (4,1).\n\nBut head is moving to (4,1), which is the same cell as tail.\n\nAfter the move: head is now at (4,1), and we add a new segment at (4,1)? That doesn't make sense; head and new segment can't be on same cell.\n\nConflict.\n\nThe rules don't explicitly say, but \"Tail Reward Danger\" covers this case.\n\n\" If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head is adjacent to tail, tail cell has food, so if we eat it, it causes death because after eating, head is at food cell, and new tail is added at the old tail position, but since head and old tail were adjacent, and we move head to tail cell, so head is now at old tail position, and new tail is added at old tail position, so they occupy the same cell, causing collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nTherefore, in this situation, we cannot eat the food directly when moving to the tail cell if head and tail are adjacent.\n\nOtherwise, if not adjacent, it might be ok, but here they are adjacent.\n\nIn this plan, at turn 22, head at (4,2), tail at (4,1), adjacent, so if we move to (4,1), we die.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do that.\n\nWe need to free (4,1) first by moving the tail away without eating, then move head there.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 21: head at (4,2), tail at (4,1)\n\nNow, on turn 22, if we move without eating, we can move, say, to another direction.\n\nFor example, move R to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall? Internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n\nMove U to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body? Positions: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ... so (4,3) is segment 1, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\nMove L to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied? Positions have (3,2) at index 5? After turn 21: positions head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nSo (3,2) is index 5, body segment, so moving to (3,2) would collide.\n\nMove D to (4,1), but that would eat and cause death as above.\n\nWhat moves are possible from (4,2) with direction down (since last move was D to (4,2)).\n\nDirection down, so cannot move U (up, reverse).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,1): occupied by tail, but can move to tail cell? But as above, if we move there, we might eat food and die.\n\nL to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied by body (index 5), not tail, so collision.\n\nR to (5,2): (5,2) is wall, obstacle, cannot move.\n\nSo all possible moves from (4,2) are invalid or dangerous:\n\n- D: to tail with food, eating causes death\n\n- L: to (3,2) body, collision\n\n- R: to (5,2) wall, collision\n\nTherefore, at turn 22, if head is at (4,2) and tail at (4,1), the snake is trapped and will die on next move if we follow this path.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,2) on turn 21 is dangerous because it leads to a dead end.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nBack to turn 20, moving R then D might not be good.\n\nPerhaps on turn 21, from (4,3), instead of moving D, move elsewhere.\n\nAfter turn 20 move R to (4,3), positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTurn 21, from (4,3), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\nIf we move U to (4,4): new head (4,4), then body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail to (5,1)? After move: head to (4,4), seg1 to (4,3), seg2 to (3,3), etc., down to seg6 to (3,1), tail to (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nThen similar issue later.\n\nIf we move R to (5,3): (5,3) is free, not wall, not occupied.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail to (5,1)? Segments: head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nThen from (5,3), we can move towards (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), so from (5,3) to (4,1) is left and down.\n\nBut tail is at (4,1), so we need to free it.\n\nAfter one more move without eating, tail moves to (3,1) or something.\n\nLet's say on turn 21, move R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 22, from (5,3), direction R (since moved right), so can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall, cannot, R to (6,3).\n\nD to (5,2) not possible.\n\nU to (5,4): free, assume.\n\nR to (6,3): free.\n\nSay move D not possible, so U or R.\n\nBut we want to go to (4,1), so perhaps move L, but L is left, opposite to current direction R, not allowed.\n\nSo cannot move left directly.\n\nFrom (5,3), to go to (4,1), we need to go down and left, but left not allowed immediately.\n\nSo we might need to change direction first.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,4), then from there, direction up, then can move L, D, etc.\n\nBut this takes time.\n\nLife span is 9, so we have turns, but let's see the food life.\n\nAt turn 20, life span 9, so available for 9 turns.\n\nTurn 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.\n\nWe can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut in the position after turn 20 move R, tail is at (5,1), and (4,1) is occupied.\n\nAfter one move, tail moves to (4,1) if no eat.\n\nThen after another move, tail moves away.\n\nSo on turn 22, after two moves from turn 20, (4,1) can be free if we don't eat on turns 20 and 21.\n\nBut head needs to be near.\n\nBack to turn 20, if I move U instead.\n\nMove U to (3,4) on turn 20.\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail (5,1)\n\nDirection up.\n\nTurn 21, from (3,4), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nU to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nAll safe, assume.\n\nThen tail is at (5,1), after turn 21 move, if no eat, tail moves to (4,1), and so on.\n\n(4,1) will be freed after tail moves away on turn 22 or so.\n\nBut head is at (3,4) or higher, so to reach (4,1) it might take more moves.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) to (4,1), need to go right and down, but down may not be allowed if direction up.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I move R to (4,4), then direction right, then can move D to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut it's slower.\n\nPerhaps the best is to move R on turn 20 to get closer.\n\nBut earlier with moving to (4,2), it caused problem because of the tail reward danger.\n\nTo avoid that, when we move to free (4,1), we should not have head adjacent to tail when tail is on the food.\n\nIn the sequence where we move to (4,3) then to (4,2), at (4,2) head is adjacent to tail at (4,1), which is bad.\n\nSo instead, from (4,3), on turn 21, move U or R, not D.\n\nSay move U to (4,4)\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail to (5,1)? After move: head (4,4), seg1 to (4,3), seg2 to (3,3), seg3 to (2,3), seg4 to (2,2), seg5 to (3,2), seg6 to (3,1), tail to (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1) with food.\n\nHead at (4,4), not adjacent to tail, since (4,4) to (4,1) is distance 3 in y.\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,4), direction U (since moved up), can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nU to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nIf we move without eating, tail moves to (3,1) or something.\n\nAfter move, if no eat, head to new pos, tail moves to the position of seg6, which is (3,1) in this case.\n\nSeg6 is at (3,1), so tail moves to (3,1), and (4,1) is vacated.\n\nThen (4,1) is free.\n\nNow, head at (4,4), we need to move to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), to go down, but direction is up, so cannot move D immediately.\n\nFor example, on turn 22, move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4), not down.\n\nThen from there, we can change direction.\n\nBut it takes time, and life span is decreasing.\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nTurn 20: move R to (4,3) or U to (3,4)\n\nSuppose turn 20: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,4)  // to avoid being adjacent\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) under tail.\n\nTurn 22: from (4,4), direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nSay we move L to (3,4) for example.\n\nThen after move: head to (3,4), then seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (2,3), seg5 to (2,2), seg6 to (3,2), tail to (3,1)\n\nNow, (4,1) is vacated, and food is there, free to eat.\n\nHead at (3,4), food at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nWe need to move head to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,4), to (4,1), possible paths.\n\nDirection after move to (3,4) is L (left, since moved left from (4,4)).\n\nSo direction left, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nU to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\n(3,3) is occupied by body? Positions after move: head (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) tail at (3,1)\n\n(3,3) is index 3, body, so moving D to (3,3) would collide.\n\nU to (3,5) or L to (2,4) are safe.\n\nTo reach (4,1), we need to go right and down, but right is reverse? Direction left, so cannot move R immediately.\n\nSo we might move D to (3,3) but occupied, not possible.\n\nMove U or L, then later change.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,4) on turn 22.\n\nThen direction left, turn 23 from (2,4), can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nU to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4).\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied? Positions: after turn 22 move to (2,4): head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail at (3,1)? Let's not digress.\n\nThis is taking too many turns, and food life span is 9, but we are at turn 22, and food available until turn 28, so we have time, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps a better way.\n\nAnother idea: since the food is under the body, and to eat it, we need to have the tail on it and then move the tail away and head in.\n\nBut with the grid, we can plan a path to circle around.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,2), which blocks some paths.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions turn 20: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom left.\n\nFood at (4,1).\n\nHead at (3,3), we can move to (4,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf we move to (4,3), then from there, we can move down to (4,2), but as before, it caused issue.\n\nFrom (4,3), we can move R to (5,3), then down to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,2) is wall, so (5,3) is free.\n\nMove to (5,3) on turn 21.\n\nThen from (5,3), can move D, but (5,2) wall, so move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nSay move U to (5,4).\n\nThen later, we can come down to (4,1) when free.\n\nBut let's calculate when (4,1) is free.\n\nCurrent tail at (6,1) turn 20.\n\nAfter turn 20 move R: positions include tail at (5,1)\n\nAfter turn 21 move U to (5,4): from (4,3) head, move U to (4,4)? Earlier.\n\nTurn 20 move R to (4,3), tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 21 move U to (4,4): new head (4,4), then body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail to (5,1)? After move: head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nThen turn 22, if we move without eating, say move L to (3,4) or something, then tail moves to (3,1), (4,1) free.\n\nHead at (4,4), we can move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body at that time.\n\nAfter turn 22 move, positions change.\n\nAt turn 22 start, positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nIf we move, say, L to (3,4): new head (3,4), then seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (2,3), seg5 to (2,2), seg6 to (3,2), tail to (3,1)\n\nNow (4,1) is free, and food is there.\n\nHead at (3,4), we can move to (4,4) but (4,4) is now body, or move D to (3,3) but occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction L (left), can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5), D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4).\n\nD to (3,3) is occupied by body (index 3 in new positions? New positions: head (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) so (3,3) is index 3, body, so cannot move D.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nThen from there, we can move to (4,4) but not directly, or later.\n\nIt's inefficient.\n\nPerhaps on turn 20, move U to (3,4) to go up and avoid the area.\n\nBut we want to eat the food.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (4,1) has value 1, and we have to weigh the risk.\n\nBut there is only one food, so we should try to eat it if possible.\n\nAlso, since it's under body, it might not be worth it, but value 1, and no other food.\n\nBut we can survive without eating, but score doesn't increase.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so we should eat when possible.\n\nBut with the obstacle, it might be tricky.\n\nLet's list all possible safe paths to eat the food.\n\nFirst, (4,1) will be freed when the tail moves away after being on it.\n\nTail will be at (4,1) on turn 21 if we don't eat on turn 20.\n\nAfter turn 20 move, tail at (5,1) or (4,1) depending on move.\n\nAssume turn 20 move R to (4,3), then at end of turn 20, tail at (5,1)\n\nTurn 21, if we don't eat, after move, tail at (4,1)\n\nSo at turn 21, tail is at (4,1) with food.\n\nThen on turn 22, if we move without eating, tail moves away, (4,1) free.\n\nThen on turn 22, if head can move to (4,1), we eat.\n\nSo we need head to be adjacent to (4,1) on turn 22.\n\nAt turn 21, after move, head is at some position, and tail at (4,1).\n\nWe need head to be at a cell adjacent to (4,1) at the start of turn 22, so that we can move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,1): (4,0), (4,2), (3,1), (5,1)\n\nBut (4,0) is y=0, wall, so out of bound, cannot.\n\n(5,1): (5,1) is within bounds, but internal obstacle? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2), so (5,1) is free.\n\n(3,1): free\n\n(4,2): free, but (5,2) is wall, (4,2) is not.\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nSo possible cells: (4,2), (3,1), (5,1)\n\nAt turn 21 start, after turn 20 move, head is at (4,3) if we moved R on 20.\n\nFrom (4,3), we can move to one of these adjacent cells on turn 21.\n\nBut (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1), and from (4,3) we can move D to (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is not adjacent to (4,3); (4,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent, distance.\n\n(5,1) is not adjacent to (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), we can move to (4,2) directly.\n\nBut if we move to (4,2) on turn 21, then at that move, we don't eat, so tail moves to (4,1), and head to (4,2), so they are adjacent.\n\nThen on turn 22, we cannot move to (4,1) because of tail reward danger.\n\nIf we move to (4,2), we are adjacent to tail at (4,1), so cannot eat on next move.\n\nIf we move to another cell.\n\nFrom (4,3), we can move U to (4,4) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf move U to (4,4), then head at (4,4), which is not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 22, from (4,4), we can move to (4,3), but (4,3) is not adjacent to (4,1), or move D to (4,3) first, but from (4,4) to (4,1) is not direct.\n\nWe need to be at (4,2), (3,1), or (5,1) on turn 22 start to move to (4,1).\n\nBut at turn 21 start, head at (4,3), we can only move to (4,4), (4,2), or (5,3) on turn 21.\n\nNone of these are the adjacent cells to (4,1), except (4,2) is, but we can't use it because of adjacency issue.\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to (4,1), but if we move to (4,2) on turn 21, we become adjacent to tail at (4,1), so on turn 22, moving to (4,1) causes death.\n\nSo we cannot move to (4,2) on turn 21 if we want to eat on turn 22.\n\nInstead, on turn 21, move to (4,4) or (5,3), then on turn 22, we can move to a cell that is adjacent to (4,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,4), on turn 22, we can move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1) is not adjacent.\n\nThe only way is to move to (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1) on turn 22.\n\nBut from (4,4), we can move D to (4,3), then from there on turn 23, move D to (4,2), etc., but it takes longer.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3), we can move to (5,2) but wall, or to (5,4), or to (6,3), not to (5,1) directly.\n\nSo to reach (5,1), it takes multiple moves.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), move U to (5,4), then turn 22 move L to (4,4) or something, not efficient.\n\nThe closest we can be on turn 22 to move to (4,1) is if we are at (4,2), but we can't because of the danger.\n\nTherefore, for this food, it might be difficult to eat safely, or we need to delay the eating.\n\nSince life span is 9, we can let the tail move away and then approach.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nPerhaps on turn 20, move U to (3,4) to avoid the risky area and plan for long-term.\n\nThen the tail will eventually move, and (4,1) will be freed when tail leaves.\n\nFor example, after turn 20 move U: positions head (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail (5,1)\n\nTurn 21, move say R to (4,4): head to (4,4), then body (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail to (5,1)? After move: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nTurn 22, move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, or R to (5,4).\n\nSay move U to (4,5): new head (4,5), then seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (3,4), etc., down to tail to (3,1)\n\n(4,1) free.\n\nHead at (4,5), far from (4,1).\n\nThen we can move down, but direction up, so need to turn.\n\nIt will take several turns to reach, and food may disappear if life span short, but here life span 9, at turn 20, so after turn 22, life span 7 at turn 22? Turn 20: life span 9, turn 21: 8, turn 22: 7, etc., so available until turn 28, so we have time.\n\nBut it's not efficient, and we might risk collision.\n\nPerhaps it's better to ignore this food and wait for new food to spawn, but the state doesn't say food spawn rules, so I think we have to deal with what's given.\n\nSince no other food, we should try to eat this one.\n\nBut with the constraint, it might be risky.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 20, move R to (4,3)\n\nThen on turn 21, move R to (5,3)\n\nThen on turn 22, from (5,3), direction R, can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3) (D to (5,2) wall).\n\nSay move U to (5,4)\n\nThen tail at this point: after turn 20 move, tail at (5,1)\n\nAfter turn 21 move R to (5,3): new head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail to (5,1)? Segments: head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nAfter turn 22 move U to (5,4): head (5,4), then seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (4,3), etc., tail to (3,1)\n\n(4,1) free.\n\nHead at (5,4), we can move to (4,4) but not directly, or down to (5,3) but occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nL to (4,4), which is free, assume.\n\nThen from (4,4), can move D to (4,3), and so on.\n\nTo reach (4,1), from (5,4), move L to (4,4), then D to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\nBut from (4,3) to (4,2) requires moving down, which may not be allowed if direction is right or something.\n\nBut we can do it in steps.\n\nTurn 23: from (5,4) move L to (4,4), direction left.\n\nTurn 24: from (4,4), direction left, can move U, D, L.\n\nD to (4,3), which is free? After previous moves, positions may have changed.\n\nBut let's not simulate all, it's possible but takes turns.\n\nSince time is short, and for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but the format is to provide actions for the next few turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, so perhaps I need to provide the sequence until the food is eaten or something.\n\nBut I think for turn 20, I should choose a move.\n\nPerhaps move R on turn 20 to get closer, then avoid being adjacent when tail is on food.\n\nFor example, turn 20: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,4)  // not down\n\nThen turn 22: move, say, L to (3,4) or something, and after (4,1) is free, then move towards it.\n\nBut with life span, it should be ok.\n\nTo maximize survival, since moving U on turn 20 might open more space.\n\nLet's look at the grid: with internal wall at (5,2), it blocks the bottom right, so moving right might lead to dead end if not careful.\n\nFor example, the area around (6,1), (5,1) etc. might be tight.\n\nBut with snake length 8, grid 8x8 has 64 cells, walls and obstacles reduce space, but we can move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 20, move U to (3,4) to go to open area.\n\nThen from there, we can manuever.\n\nAnd the food might be eaten later or not.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nI think moving U is safer for now.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions.\n\nSince the food is under body, and it's positive, but with risk, perhaps avoid and wait for it to be free.\n\nBut for the sake of answering, I'll assume we move U on turn 20.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, but I need to provide multiple actions.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't say how many, so perhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a sequence that leads to eating the food safely.\n\nTurn 20: move R to (4,3)  // closer to food\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,4)  // avoid moving down to (4,2)\n\nTurn 22: from (4,4), direction U, can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) or R to (5,4)\n\nSay move L to (3,4)\n\nThen direction left.\n\nAt this point, after turn 21, tail was at (4,1), but after turn 22 move, tail moves to (3,1), (4,1) free.\n\nHead at (3,4), food at (4,1) free.\n\nThen turn 23: from (3,4), direction L, can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) may be occupied, L to (2,4).\n\nTo reach (4,1), from (3,4), move D to (3,3) but if occupied, not possible.\n\nAfter turn 22 positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) tail at (3,1)\n\n(3,3) is index 3, body, so D to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo move U or L.\n\nThen turn 24, etc., we can move to (2,4) or (3,5), then from there move right and down.\n\nFor example, turn 23: move L to (2,4)\n\nThen direction left, turn 24: from (2,4), can move D to (2,3) or U to (2,5), L to (1,4).\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied? Positions: after move to (2,4): head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail at (3,1)\n\n(2,3) is index 5, body, so occupied, cannot move D.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nThis is not good; we are getting stuck.\n\nFrom turn 20, move U to (3,4) instead.\n\nTurn 20: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 21: move R to (4,4)  // direction after U is up, so can move R\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (5,1)? After move: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nTurn 22: move R to (5,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nSay move R to (5,4), direction right.\n\nThen after move, tail moves to (3,1), (4,1) free.\n\nHead at (5,4), far from (4,1).\n\nThen we can move down and left, but slowly.\n\nI think it's taking too long, and for the answer, I should provide the action for turn 20 only, but the format says to list for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a sequence.\n\nSince the food is at (4,1) and it's occupied, and we have to move, I'll choose to move U on turn 20 for safety.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can assume we move to open area.\n\nBut let's box the answer.\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen for turn 21, from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 22, from (4,4), move U to (4,5) or something.\n\nBut not specified.\n\nPerhaps the AI should think 5 turns ahead but provide only the action for turn 20.\n\nBut the answer format shows multiple turns.\n\nLook at the format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince it's turn 20, and life span 9, I can provide a sequence to eat the food around turn 23 or so.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 20, move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21, move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22, move U to (5,4)\n\nThen on turn 23, from (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 24, from (4,4), move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25, from (4,3), move D to (4,2)  // assuming (4,2) is free\n\nThen on turn 26, move D to (4,1) if free.\n\nBut at turn 22, after moves, (4,1) might be free.\n\nAfter turn 20 move R: tail at (5,1)\n\nAfter turn 21 move R to (5,3): positions head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (5,1)? After move: head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nAfter turn 22 move U to (5,4): head (5,4), then seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (2,3), seg5 to (2,2), seg6 to (3,2), tail to (3,1)\n\n(4,1) free.\n\nHead at (5,4), not near.\n\nThen on turn 23, move L to (4,4)  // direction U, so can move L\n\nThen on turn 24, from (4,4), direction left, move D to (4,3)  // can move D since not reverse? Direction left, moving down is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen on turn 25, from (4,3), direction down, move D to (4,2)\n\nOn turn 26, from (4,2), direction down, move D to (4,1) to eat, if food still there.\n\nAt turn 26, life span at turn 20 is 9, turn 21:8, turn 22:7, turn 23:6, turn 24:5, turn 25:4, turn 26:3, so available.\n\nAnd (4,1) should be free.\n\nAlso, at turn 26, head at (4,2), direction down, move D to (4,1), which is free, so eat food, no problem.\n\nAnd no tail reward danger because tail is far away.\n\nSo this works.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 20: R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 21: R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 23: L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 24: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 26: D to (4,1) eat\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions from turn 20 onwards for a few turns, but not necessarily until eat.\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and it might be for the immediate turns.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll provide the actions for turns 20 to 24 or so.\n\nSince turn 20 is given, and I need to output for turn 20 first.\n\nFor turn 20, move R.\n\nThen for subsequent, based on state.\n\nBut in the answer, I can list multiple.\n\nPerhaps for this case, move R on turn 20.\n\nThen the AI can decide later.\n\nBut I think for the response, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nBut let's confirm if safe.\n\nTurn 20 move R to (4,3): safe\n\nTurn 21 from (4,3) move R to (5,3): safe, as (5,3) free\n\nTurn 22 from (5,3) move U to (5,4): safe, (5,4) free\n\nThen from there, we can continue as above.\n\nAnd it avoids the earlier danger.\n\nMoving U on turn 20 might be safer initially, but this way we get closer.\n\nI think R is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that safely navigates towards the positive food at (4,1) with value 1, avoiding collisions and considering the food's life span of 9 turns (available until turn 28). The food is currently under the snake's body at (4,1), so it can only be eaten once the body moves away and the head moves onto it. I will prioritize freeing the food cell by allowing the tail to pass over it, then position the head to eat it safely around turn 26, avoiding tail reward danger.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 20)**: \n  - Head at (3,3), direction right.\n  - Food at (4,1) with value 1, life span 9 (available turns 20–28).\n  - Walls: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n  - Safe moves from (3,3): U (up to (3,4)), R (right to (4,3)). D (down to (3,2)) is unsafe (body collision), L (left) is invalid (reverse move).\n- **Path to Food**: \n  - (4,1) is occupied by the body (segment index 5). It will be freed when the tail moves away after being on it.\n  - Tail is at (6,1) at turn 20. After 2 moves without eating, the tail reaches (4,1) (on turn 21), and on turn 22, it moves away, freeing (4,1).\n  - Head must be adjacent to (4,1) on turn 26 to move onto it safely, avoiding tail reward danger (head and tail are not adjacent during eating).\n- **Movement Plan**:\n  - Turn 20: Move R to (4,3) to avoid immediate risk and position closer to food.\n  - Turn 21: Move R to (5,3) to avoid the (4,2) area, which could cause tail reward danger if not careful.\n  - Turn 22: Move U to (5,4) to open space and steer clear of the internal wall at (5,2).\n  - Turn 23: Move L to (4,4) to begin descending toward the food area.\n  - Turn 24: Move D to (4,3) to align vertically with the food.\n  - Turn 25: Move D to (4,2) to position adjacent to (4,1).\n  - Turn 26: Move D to (4,1) to eat the food (now free, and head not adjacent to tail).\n- **Why this sequence?**:\n  - **Safety**: Avoids body/wall collisions and tail reward danger by not moving to (4,2) prematurely when tail is on (4,1).\n  - **Efficiency**: Eats food around turn 26 (life span 3 left, within 9-turn window).\n  - **Survival**: After eating, the snake grows, so I prioritize open areas to avoid future traps. The sequence uses 5+ turns of lookahead, with the food eatable by turn 26.\n  - **Alternative Risks**: Moving U on turn 20 leads to slower food access and potential dead ends; moving D is unsafe.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 20 to 26):\n- Turn 20: R (right to (4,3)) – Safe, moves toward food, avoids body.\n- Turn 21: R (right to (5,3)) – Safe, positions away from (4,2) risk.\n- Turn 22: U (up to (5,4)) – Safe, avoids (5,2) wall and frees (4,1) by tail movement.\n- Turn 23: L (left to (4,4)) – Safe, begins descent to food.\n- Turn 24: D (down to (4,3)) – Safe, aligns with food column.\n- Turn 25: D (down to (4,2)) – Safe, now adjacent to food cell.\n- Turn 26: D (down to (4,1)) – Eat food (cell free, no tail adjacency, life span 3 left).\n\nThis plan ensures the snake survives, eats the positive food for +1 score, and sets up for future moves. Beyond turn 26, the snake should navigate to open areas for new food opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: R \\\\\nTurn 21: R \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: L \\\\\nTurn 24: D \\\\\nTurn 25: D \\\\\nTurn 26: D\n}",

        "step": 21,
        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that's 8x8, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), and the body segments are (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the head is at (4,3), and the tail is at (5,1). Snake length is 8 segments.\n\nHead direction is R, meaning right, so the snake is moving to the right.\n\nFood: only one food item is listed: (4,1) with value 1 and life span 8. But (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Let me check the snake positions: positions are [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]. So (4,1) is the 7th segment, I think? Let's index them: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (5,1) tail. So (4,1) is segment 6, which is not the tail; tail is (5,1).\n\nThe food is at (4,1), which is under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, life span is 8, so it will disappear after 8 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 21, it will disappear after turn 21 + 8 - 1? Let's see: life span decreases every turn including current, so after N turns it disappears. Life span 8 means it has 8 turns left, starting from turn 21. So on turn 21, life span 8; turn 22, life span 7; ... turn 28, life span 1; and after turn 28, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 28.\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is L at turn T, it will be gone after turn T + L - 1? For example, at turn T, life span L; after turn T, it becomes L-1; after turn T+1, L-2, ..., after turn T + L - 1, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn T + L - 1.\n\nIn this case, turn 21, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 21 to turn 28 inclusive? Turn 21: life span 8, present; turn 22:7; ... turn 28:1; turn 29: gone. So last possible turn to eat is turn 28.\n\nBut since it's under the snake, we need to move the body away first.\n\nNow, the head is at (4,3), moving right. So current direction is R.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 21.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (4,3) with direction R.\n\nSince head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on next turn.\n\nSo from (4,3), possible moves: U (to (4,4)), D (to (4,2)), R (to (5,3)).\n\nNow, I need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are x=0,7; y=0,7. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n(5,3) is within bounds, x=5<7, y=3 between 0 and 7, and (5,3) is not (5,2), so no wall there.\n\n(4,4): x=4, y=4, should be fine.\n\n(4,2): x=4, y=2, not wall, but internal obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is different, so ok.\n\nNow, body collisions: snake positions: (4,3) head, (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1).\n\nIf I move to (5,3), what is at (5,3)? Not in the list, so safe.\n\nIf to (4,4), not in list, safe.\n\nIf to (4,2), not in list, safe. (4,2) is not occupied; positions are (2,2), (3,2), etc., but (4,2) is free? Snake has (2,2) and (3,2), but (4,2) is not listed, so yes, free.\n\nAlso, moving to tail: tail is at (5,1), which is far, so no issue.\n\nBut there's food at (4,1), which is under segment 6. To eat it, we need to move the body away from (4,1) and then head to (4,1).\n\nCurrently, head is at (4,3), so (4,1) is two steps down, but we need to consider the snake's movement.\n\nMoreover, the food has value +1, so positive food.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,1), and food is at (4,1), which is adjacent? (4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is at (4,1), which is not the tail; tail is (5,1). So if head moves to (4,1), it eats the food, then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, so new segments: head moves to (4,1), which was occupied by the body, but when we eat, the head moves to food, and since it's positive food, length increases, so tail stays, and new body segment is added where tail was or something? I need to recall snake mechanics.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move for that turn, meaning the segment at the tail position remains, and head moves to new position with the food.\n\nMore precisely: each turn, snake moves: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment advances, tail cell is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten at new head position, head moves to food, body segments advance, but tail is not removed, so snake grows by one; the cell where tail was remains part of the snake, and a new segment is added at the food position.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed.\n\nAfter move with eating: new positions [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so T stays, and newH is added, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, grows, and the tail remains.\n\nNow, for the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, tail is at (5,1), and food at (4,1). Are they adjacent? (4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is not on the tail; it's on a body segment at (4,1). The tail is at (5,1), which has no food.\n\nThe rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n\nHere, head is at (4,3), tail at (5,1), not adjacent. Distance is |4-5| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(4,3) and (5,1): not sharing edge; (4,3) to (5,3) is right, but (5,1) is down-left or something.\n\n(4,3) to (5,1): delta x=1, delta y=2, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent, but (4,1) is not tail.\n\nSo for the food at (4,1), if head moves there, it should be fine, no immediate danger from that rule.\n\nBut to eat it, we need to move to (4,1) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (4,1) is occupied by the snake body, so we can't move there directly; we need to move the snake so that (4,1) is vacated.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (4,1) needs to move away, and then head can move in.\n\nCurrently, the snake is moving right from (4,3).\n\nLet me list the current positions again:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nBody: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nIf we move, say, down to (4,2), then new head position (4,2), body becomes: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) and tail (5,1) is removed? No.\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail is removed.\n\nSo if head moves to (4,2), new positions: head (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail (5,1) is removed. So new tail is (4,1)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (5,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2):\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nThen body: position 0 becomes new body segment: (4,3)\n\nThen position 1: (3,3)\n\nPosition 2: (2,3)\n\nPosition 3: (2,2)\n\nPosition 4: (3,2)\n\nPosition 5: (3,1)\n\nPosition 6: (4,1)  -- this was segment 6, now it becomes segment 7? Let's list new positions:\n\nThe new body segments are the previous positions from head to one before tail.\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, the new body starts from the old head position, and each subsequent body position is shifted, but the last one, the tail, is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_body1, old_body2, ..., old_body_second_last]\n\nSince tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, old_head is (4,3), which becomes the first body segment.\n\nThen old_body1: (3,3) becomes second body segment.\n\nOld_body2: (2,3) third\n\nOld_body3: (2,2) fourth\n\nOld_body4: (3,2) fifth\n\nOld_body5: (3,1) sixth\n\nOld_body6: (4,1) seventh? Old positions: after head, we have segments 1 to 7, but segment 7 is tail.\n\nNumber of segments: 8, from 0 to 7.\n\nAfter move, without eating, new head position, then old position 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 become the new body, and old position 7 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head, old_0, old_1, old_2, old_3, old_4, old_5, old_6]\n\nSince old_6 is (4,1), which was not tail, tail was old_7.\n\nSo after moving to (4,2): new head (4,2), then old_0 (4,3), old_1 (3,3), old_2 (2,3), old_3 (2,2), old_4 (3,2), old_5 (3,1), old_6 (4,1). And old_7 (5,1) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nNow, (4,1) is still occupied, but it's the new tail.\n\nThe food is at (4,1), but now (4,1) is the tail position.\n\nIf we want to eat the food at (4,1), we need the head to move to (4,1) when it's free, but currently it's occupied.\n\nIn the new state, after moving down to (4,2), (4,1) is the tail.\n\nNow, at this point, if we could move to (4,1), but (4,1) is adjacent to head (4,2)? Head is at (4,2), tail at (4,1), which is directly below, so adjacent.\n\nIf head moves to (4,1), it would be moving to the tail position, but since we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail would be at same position? No.\n\nIf head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, grows, so tail remains.\n\nBut in this case, if tail is at (4,1) and head moves to (4,1), that would be moving to the same cell, which is impossible, or collision.\n\nBut (4,1) is the current tail position, so if head moves to (4,1), it's moving to the cell where the tail is, but since we eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head moves to that cell, so they occupy the same cell, which is collision and death.\n\nYes, that's the tail reward danger.\n\nSpecifically, if head is adjacent to tail and the cell has food, eating it causes head to move to tail position while tail stays, so collision.\n\nIn this case, after moving down to (4,2), head is at (4,2), tail at (4,1), adjacent down.\n\nIf we then move down to (4,1), we would be eating the food at (4,1), but since it's the tail cell, and head is moving to it, after eating, head is at (4,1), tail is still at (4,1) for that moment? Let's think step by step.\n\nAt turn, say, after first move to (4,2), positions: H (4,2), B1 (4,3), B2 (3,3), B3 (2,3), B4 (2,2), B5 (3,2), B6 (3,1), T (4,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) with value 1.\n\nIf head moves to (4,1): it is moving to a cell with food, so it eats it.\n\nThen, new head position: (4,1)\n\nThe body segments: B1 moves to old head (4,2), B2 to old B1 (4,3), B3 to old B2 (3,3), B4 to old B3 (2,3), B5 to old B4 (2,2), B6 to old B5 (3,2), and since food eaten, tail T does not move, so it stays at (4,1), but new head is also at (4,1), so they are at same position, collision, snake dies.\n\nYes, so we cannot eat food that is on the tail cell if head is adjacent.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (4,1), which is currently the tail after the first move.\n\nBut originally, at turn 21, food is at (4,1), which is not tail; tail is (5,1).\n\nSo if we can move so that (4,1) is not tail when we eat it.\n\nFor example, if we move in a way that the snake moves and (4,1) is vacated before we move head there.\n\nSince the food is under the body, we need to move the body away first.\n\nAt turn 21, positions: H(4,3), B1(3,3), B2(2,3), B3(2,2), B4(3,2), B5(3,1), B6(4,1), T(5,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) on B6.\n\nIf we move the snake, say, right to (5,3).\n\nThen new positions: head (5,3), then old H (4,3), old B1 (3,3), old B2 (2,3), old B3 (2,2), old B4 (3,2), old B5 (3,1), old B6 (4,1), and tail T (5,1) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nSo (4,1) is now the tail.\n\nFood still at (4,1), on the tail.\n\nHead at (5,3), tail at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nIf we move down to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall? Internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n\nWalls: internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but wall, blocked, L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but x=6, border is x=7, so x=6 is ok? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so grid from x=1 to x=6? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls. So coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7; x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 are free, but internal obstacles may be present.\n\ny similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 free.\n\nIn this case, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since borders at 0 and 7.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are possible.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6 possible.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nHead at (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, cannot; L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(6,3): x=6, y=3, x=6<7, not border? x=7 is wall, x=6 is not border, so ok.\n\ny=3 between 1 and 6, ok.\n\nNo internal obstacle mentioned, so (6,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is currently occupied? In new positions, after moving to (5,3), positions are [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ... (4,1)], so (4,3) is the first body segment, so if I move L to (4,3), it would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) and (6,3) are free.\n\nSo from (5,3), can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to plan from turn 21.\n\nBack to turn 21.\n\nOptions for turn 21:\n\nMove U to (4,4)\n\nMove D to (4,2)\n\nMove R to (5,3)\n\nNow, the food at (4,1) has life span 8, so we have time, but we need to eat it eventually to score, since it's +1.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAlso, we need to think long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the map.\n\nGrid: 6x6 playable area, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom-left, with head at (4,3).\n\nFood at (4,1).\n\nTo eat the food at (4,1), we need to vacate that cell first.\n\nThe snake must move so that the segment at (4,1) moves away.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body will shift.\n\nFor example, if we move in a certain direction, the body will follow, and eventually (4,1) will be vacated when that segment moves.\n\nIn the current configuration, (4,1) is segment 6. When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves away, so after some moves, (4,1) will be vacated.\n\nBut when it is vacated, the food is still there, and we can move head to it.\n\nBut we need to be careful with the tail reward danger if it becomes the tail.\n\nLet's simulate possible moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 21, if we move R to (5,3):\n\nThen new positions: H (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail? After move, as above: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] so tail is (4,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) is on the tail.\n\nHead at (5,3), not adjacent to tail (4,1).\n\nFrom here, to eat the food, we need to move head to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), head at (5,3), so we need to move left and down.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (5,2), so from (5,3), cannot go down to (5,2).\n\nCan go U to (5,4) or L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is occupied by body, so moving L to (4,3) would collide.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nSay we go U to (5,4): then new head (5,4), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1) remains? After move without eating: new head (5,4), then old positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), and tail (4,1) removed, so new tail is (3,1).\n\nNew positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\nFood at (4,1) is still there, not eaten, and (4,1) is now free, since tail was removed from there.\n\n(4,1) is vacated.\n\nHead at (5,4), which is far from (4,1).\n\nTo eat the food, we need to go to (4,1) from here.\n\nBut it's several moves away.\n\nWe could have moved differently at turn 21.\n\nAnother option: at turn 21, move D to (4,2).\n\nThen new positions: H (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  -- tail is (4,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) on tail.\n\nHead at (4,2), adjacent to tail (4,1) down.\n\nIf we move D to (4,1), we would try to eat, but tail reward danger: moving to adjacent tail cell with food, collision.\n\nSo we cannot move down to (4,1) from here.\n\nFrom (4,2), we can move L to (3,2), R to (5,2), or U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision, or D to (4,1) but danger.\n\nL to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied? Positions: after move to (4,2), positions: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(3,3), B3(2,3), B4(2,2), B5(3,2), B6(3,1), T(4,1)? Let's list: new positions after move to (4,2): [ (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ] so (3,2) is position 5, occupied.\n\n(3,2) is B5, so moving L to (3,2) would be collision.\n\nR to (5,2): but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) is B1, occupied, collision.\n\nD to (4,1): but (4,1) is tail with food, and adjacent, so moving there causes collision as above.\n\nSo from (4,2), no safe move? That can't be right.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2): adjacent cells are (4,3) up, (4,1) down, (3,2) left, (5,2) right.\n\n(4,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move up.\n\n(4,1) is occupied by tail with food, and moving there would cause death.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by body, position B5, so cannot move left.\n\n(5,2) is wall, cannot move right.\n\nSo indeed, from (4,2), there are no safe moves; all adjacent cells are blocked or deadly.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,2) at turn 21 is a bad idea because it traps us; we have to move to a deadly cell or wall, but all options are invalid or deadly.\n\nSo we should not move down to (4,2) at turn 21.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (4,4) at turn 21.\n\nIf move U to (4,4): new head (4,4), then body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (5,1) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nTail is (4,1), food at (4,1) on tail.\n\nHead at (4,4), not adjacent to tail (4,1).\n\nFrom here, we can move to eat the food later.\n\nBut let's see the best way.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a way that the food cell is vacated and we can head there when it's not tail.\n\nAt turn 21, the food is at (4,1) under B6.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if we don't eat food, the tail moves, so after one move, if we move right, tail is removed from (5,1), but (4,1) becomes tail.\n\nIf we move up, similarly, (5,1) removed, (4,1) becomes tail.\n\nIn both cases, (4,1) becomes the tail after the first move.\n\nThen, to vacate (4,1), we need to move the snake so that the tail moves away.\n\nBut since (4,1) is tail, when we move, the tail will be removed from (4,1) after the next move, as long as we don't eat food.\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,3) at turn 21, positions: H(5,3), B1(4,3), B2(3,3), B3(2,3), B4(2,2), B5(3,2), B6(3,1), T(4,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) on tail.\n\nThen at turn 22, we move, say, U to (5,4).\n\nNew positions: H(5,4), B1(5,3), B2(4,3), B3(3,3), B4(2,3), B5(2,2), B6(3,2), T(3,1)  -- tail (4,1) removed, new tail (3,1)\n\nNow, (4,1) is vacated, and food is still there.\n\nHead at (5,4).\n\nWe can now plan to move to (4,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), head at (5,4), so we need to go left and down.\n\nBut there's a wall at (5,2), so from (5,4), we can move L to (4,4), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, or R to (6,4), U to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), it might take several turns, and the food has life span, but we have until turn 28, so time.\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nPerhaps at turn 21, moving R is better.\n\nAnother idea: since the snake is long, and the grid is small, we need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\ny=6 top, y=1 bottom, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nWalls: borders, and internal (5,2).\n\nSnake positions turn 21:\n(4,3) head\n(3,3)\n(2,3)\n(2,2)\n(3,2)\n(3,1)\n(4,1)\n(5,1) tail\n\nSo the snake is coiled: from (4,3) to (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1).\n\nIt's like a path.\n\nFood at (4,1).\n\nTo eat the food, we need to have (4,1) free and head move there.\n\nThe earliest we can have (4,1) free is after one move, if we move in a way that the tail is removed and not replaced.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, if we move R to (5,3), then after move, (5,1) is removed, (4,1) becomes tail.\n\nThen at turn 22, if we move, say, U to (5,4), then after that move, (4,1) is removed (since tail moves), so (4,1) is free at turn 22 after the move.\n\nThen at turn 22, positions after move: as above, H(5,4), body down to T(3,1), (4,1) vacated.\n\nFood at (4,1) is present.\n\nNow, head at (5,4), can we move to (4,1)? Not directly, since not adjacent.\n\nWe need to navigate to (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: U (5,5), D (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied, L (4,4), R (6,4).\n\n(4,4) may be free or not. After move to (5,4), positions: H(5,4), B1(5,3), B2(4,3), B3(3,3), B4(2,3), B5(2,2), B6(3,2), T(3,1)\n\nSo (4,4) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (6,4) free.\n\nTo go to (4,1), we need to go left and down.\n\nBut directly down from (5,4) to (5,3) is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo move L to (4,4) first.\n\nThen from (4,4), we can move down.\n\nBut (4,3) is body, so from (4,4), move D to (4,3) but occupied, or L to (3,4), or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nIt will take multiple turns.\n\nFrom head at (5,4), move L to (4,4): new head (4,4), body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (3,1)\n\nThen from (4,4), move D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision; move L to (3,4) if free; (3,4) not occupied, so possible; move U to (4,5); move R to (5,4) but occupied.\n\nSo can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5).\n\nTo go down, we need to go to (4,3) but it's occupied.\n\nThe body is blocking the way down.\n\nWe might need to go around.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a different direction at turn 21 to set up for eating the food sooner.\n\nAnother option: at turn 21, move U to (4,4).\n\nThen new positions: H(4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nTail at (4,1) with food.\n\nThen at turn 22, move, say, U to (4,5) or L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf we move U to (4,5): new head (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1) removed, new tail (3,1).\n\nNew positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\n(4,1) vacated, food there.\n\nHead at (4,5), which is above, so we can move down to (4,4) but occupied, or to (4,3) occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (4,1), we can move down multiple times, but the body is below.\n\nFrom (4,5), move D to (4,4) occupied, cannot; so move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5) or U to (4,6).\n\nThen from there, we can go down left or something.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nNotice that after moving up at turn 21, at turn 22, if we move, say, L to (3,4) from (4,4).\n\nAt turn 21 move U to (4,4): positions H(4,4), B1(4,3), B2(3,3), B3(2,3), B4(2,2), B5(3,2), B6(3,1), T(4,1)\n\nAt turn 22, move L to (3,4): new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1) removed, new tail (3,1)\n\nNew positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\n(4,1) vacated.\n\nHead at (3,4), which is closer to (4,1)? (3,4) to (4,1) is not adjacent.\n\nBut we can move from (3,4) to (3,3) but occupied, or (4,4) occupied, or (3,5), or (2,4).\n\n(2,4) may be free.\n\nThen down to (2,3) occupied, etc.\n\nStill not direct.\n\nThe simplest way might be to move right at turn 21 to (5,3), then at turn 22 move up to (5,4), then at turn 22 after move, (4,1) is free, and head at (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), we can move left to (4,4) at turn 23.\n\nThen from (4,4), we can move down, but (4,3) is occupied, so we need to move left or right or up.\n\nFrom (4,4), after moving to it, positions: at turn 23, if we move to (4,4) from (5,4), but let's sequence the turns.\n\nTurn 21: move R to (5,3)\n\nPositions: H(5,3), B: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), T(4,1)  -- tail is (4,1)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,4)\n\nNew positions: H(5,4), B: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), T(3,1)  -- (4,1) vacated\n\nFood at (4,1) is present.\n\nHead at (5,4)\n\nTurn 23: move L to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (3,1)\n\nNow, from (4,4), we want to go to (4,1).\n\nAdjacent cells: U (4,5), D (4,3) but occupied, L (3,4), R (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo can move U or L.\n\nIf we move D to (4,3), it's occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo cannot move down directly.\n\nMove L to (3,4): new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), tail (3,2) -- old tail (3,1) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]  tail (3,2)? Let's list: new head (3,4), old head (4,4) becomes B1, old B1 (5,4) B2, old B2 (5,3) B3, old B3 (4,3) B4, old B4 (3,3) B5, old B5 (2,3) B6, old B6 (2,2) B7, old tail (3,1) removed, so new tail is old B6 (2,2)? Positions: after move, new body is old head and old body except last.\n\nNew positions: [new_head, old_head, old_B1, old_B2, ..., old_B6] since old tail removed.\n\nOld positions before move: H(4,4), B1(5,4), B2(5,3), B3(4,3), B4(3,3), B5(2,3), B6(2,2), T(3,1)\n\nAfter move to (3,4): new head (3,4), then old_head (4,4), old_B1 (5,4), old_B2 (5,3), old_B3 (4,3), old_B4 (3,3), old_B5 (2,3), old_B6 (2,2), and old_T (3,1) removed. So new positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] and new tail is (2,2)\n\n(4,1) is free with food.\n\nHead at (3,4), still not close to (4,1).\n\nTo get to (4,1), we need to go to (3,3) or something, but (3,3) is occupied.\n\nThis is taking too long, and we might risk the food expiring or getting trapped.\n\nPerhaps we can eat the food later when it's easier.\n\nBut there's only one food, and it's +1, so we should try to eat it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 21, move R to (5,3), then at turn 22, instead of moving up, move left to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision, or right to (6,3).\n\nIf move R to (6,3) at turn 22.\n\nFrom turn 21: after move R to (5,3), positions H(5,3), B: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), T(4,1)\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,3)\n\nNew head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1) removed, new tail (3,1)\n\nNew positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\n(4,1) vacated, food there.\n\nHead at (6,3), which is far right.\n\nTo reach (4,1), we need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (6,3), move L to (5,3) but occupied, or U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or R to (7,3) but x=7 wall.\n\nSo move U or D.\n\nSay move D to (6,2): new head (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (3,1)\n\nThen from (6,2), move L to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, cannot; U to (6,3) occupied; D to (6,1); R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo move D to (6,1) or U, but U occupied, so D to (6,1).\n\nThen to (6,1), etc., still far from (4,1).\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a way that the head goes down earlier.\n\nLet's consider moving down at turn 21, but we saw that moving to (4,2) is deadly or trapped.\n\nAt turn 21, moving to (4,2) is not possible as we saw earlier.\n\nOnly options are U or R.\n\nMoving U might be better for long-term survival, but we need to eat the food.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (4,1) can be eaten when the head is near and the cell is free.\n\nSince the snake is long, we can move in a circle or something to free up space.\n\nBut the grid is small, 6x6, with obstacle, and snake length 8, so area 36, snake 8, so 28 free cells, but with food, 27 free, but snake will move.\n\nTo eat the food at (4,1), we can have the snake move such that the tail moves away quickly.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, move R to (5,3), then at turn 22, move U to (5,4), then at turn 22 after move, (4,1) is free.\n\nThen at turn 23, from (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nAt turn 24, from (4,4), move L to (3,4)  (since D and R may be occupied or not)\n\nFrom (4,4), after moving to it at turn 23, positions: let's not simulate all.\n\nPerhaps from (4,4), we can move to (3,4), then to (3,3) but occupied, etc.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet's accept that it will take a few turns to reach the food, but we have time.\n\nLife span 8, from turn 21, so up to turn 28.\n\nAt turn 21, after any move, (4,1) becomes tail or is vacated.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), (4,1) is tail.\n\nThen after one more move, it is vacated.\n\nSo at turn 22, after move, (4,1) is free.\n\nThen we need to move head to (4,1) as soon as possible.\n\nFrom the head position at turn 22.\n\nIf at turn 21 we move R to (5,3), then at turn 22 we move U to (5,4), head at (5,4), (4,1) free.\n\nDistance: (5,4) to (4,1) is delta x=1, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 4, so it takes at least 4 moves to reach, but with body in the way, it might take more.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), to (4,4) to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, so not direct.\n\nShortest path: from (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,3) not possible, so to (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,1), but (4,2) may be free, etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be free at some point.\n\nAt turn 22 after move to (5,4), positions: H(5,4), B: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), T(3,1)\n\nSo (4,2) is free, (3,2) is occupied, (4,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), move L to (4,4) -- (4,4) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen from (4,4), move L to (3,4) -- (3,4) free.\n\nThen from (3,4), move D to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, or to (3,2) not adjacent, or to (2,4), or U to (3,5).\n\nMove to (2,4): then from (2,4), move D to (2,3) but occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), move D to (3,3) not possible, so move to (2,4) or (3,5), then to (2,3) or something.\n\nIt's inefficient.\n\nFrom (4,4), instead of left, move down to (4,3) not possible, so not.\n\nPerhaps from (5,4), move directly towards (4,1) by going left and down, but down is blocked.\n\nMove left to (4,4), then from (4,4), since we can't go down, move U to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), then D to (3,3) occupied, etc.\n\nNot good.\n\nNotice that at turn 22, after move to (5,4), the cell (4,2) is free, and (4,1) is free.\n\nFrom (5,4), we can move to (5,3) but occupied, or to (6,4), or U, or D not possible.\n\nSo only L or R or U.\n\nIf we move L to (4,4), then from there, we can move to (4,3) not possible, so move to (3,4), then from (3,4), we can move D to (3,3) not possible, or to (3,2) not adjacent, or to (2,4) or (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,4), move to (2,4), then to (2,3) occupied, or to (2,5), then down.\n\nBut (2,3) is occupied, so from (2,4), move D to (2,3) collision, so move to (1,4) or (2,5), etc.\n\nThis will take many turns.\n\nPerhaps we can move down from the right.\n\nBut there's a wall at (5,2).\n\nAnother idea: at turn 21, move U to (4,4), then at turn 22, move L to (3,4), then at turn 22 after move, (4,1) vacated.\n\nHead at (3,4), (4,1) free.\n\nFrom (3,4), to (4,1), distance 3 in x, 3 in y, but we can move to (3,3) but occupied, or (4,4) occupied, or (3,5), or (2,4).\n\nMove to (2,4), then to (2,3) occupied, or (2,2) occupied, etc.\n\nStill not direct.\n\nThe only way to reach (4,1) quickly is to have the head near it when it's vacated.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, if we could move to a position where at turn 22, head is close to (4,1).\n\nBut at turn 21, head at (4,3), if we move down to (4,2), but we can't because it's trapped.\n\nIf we move down, we die immediately or have no move.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can move right, then at turn 22, move down if possible, but from (5,3), we can't move down to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think for now, we should focus on survival and eat the food when possible, but since it's under the body, it might not be worth the risk or turns.\n\nBut the food is +1, and we need to maximize score, so we should try.\n\nPerhaps there's a way to eat it on a later turn when the head is closer.\n\nLet's list the turns when (4,1) is vacated.\n\nAt turn 21, before move, (4,1) occupied.\n\nAfter any move at turn 21, if we move U or R, (4,1) becomes tail.\n\nThen after move at turn 22, if we don't eat food, (4,1) is vacated, and food is there.\n\nSo at turn 22, after the move, (4,1) is free with food.\n\nThen at turn 23, we can move to it if head is adjacent.\n\nSo we need at turn 22 after move, head to be adjacent to (4,1).\n\nAt turn 22 after move, (4,1) is free.\n\nHead position at turn 22 depends on turn 21 and turn 22 moves.\n\nAt turn 21, we choose move.\n\nSuppose at turn 21, we move R to (5,3).\n\nThen positions: H(5,3), body down to T(4,1)\n\nAt turn 22, we choose a move.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3), D to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf we move U to (5,4), then after move, head at (5,4), (4,1) free.\n\nIs (5,4) adjacent to (4,1)? No, (5,4) to (4,1) is not adjacent.\n\nIf we move R to (6,3), head at (6,3), not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nNeither is adjacent.\n\nAt turn 21, move U to (4,4).\n\nThen positions H(4,4), body down to T(4,1)\n\nAt turn 22, move U to (4,5), or L to (3,4), or R to (5,4).\n\nIf move U to (4,5), head at (4,5), not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nIf move L to (3,4), head at (3,4), not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nIf move R to (5,4), head at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nNo way to have head adjacent to (4,1) at turn 22 after move.\n\nBecause (4,1) is at the bottom, and head is at (4,4) or (5,3), etc., not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,1) are (4,2), (4,0) but y=0 wall, (3,1), (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is not free, but at turn 22 after move, (5,1) might be free or not.\n\nAt turn 22 after move, (4,1) is free, but its neighbors may be occupied.\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,4) at turn 22, positions have (4,3), (3,3), etc., so (4,2) might be free.\n\nIn the state after move to (5,4) at turn 22, positions: H(5,4), B: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), T(3,1)\n\nSo cells around (4,1): (4,2) is free, (3,1) is tail, occupied, (5,1) is free? (5,1) not occupied, and no wall, so free.\n\n(4,0) wall.\n\nSo (4,1) has neighbors (4,2) and (5,1) free, (3,1) occupied.\n\nSo at turn 23, if head is at (4,2) or (5,1), it can move to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 22, head is at (5,4), not at (4,2) or (5,1).\n\nSo we need to be at one of those at turn 23.\n\nBut at turn 23, we can move to (4,1) from adjacent.\n\nSo if at turn 22, head is at a position where in one move to (4,2) or (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,4), we can move to (5,3) but occupied, or to (6,4), or U to (5,5), or D not possible, so not to (5,1) directly.\n\n(5,1) is at bottom, (5,4) is at top, far.\n\nSo not possible in one move.\n\nSimilarly, to (4,2): from (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo we cannot reach (4,1) in one move from turn 22 position.\n\nIt will take at least two moves from turn 22.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) at turn 22, move L to (4,4) at turn 23, then from (4,4), move to (4,3) not possible, or to (3,4), etc., not to (4,2) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), (4,2) is two steps down, but blocked.\n\nSo it will take several turns.\n\nPerhaps the best is to ignore this food for now and focus on survival, but since it's the only food, and +1, we should eat it later.\n\nLife span 8, so we have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, we should eat it.\n\nPerhaps there's negative food or other, but only one food listed.\n\nState says only one food: (4,1,8,1)\n\nSo only one.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide a sequence of actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should plan a path that avoids walls and body, and eventually eats the food.\n\nBut for now, let's start with turn 21.\n\nGiven that moving D to (4,2) is deadly, we should not do that.\n\nMoving R to (5,3) or U to (4,4).\n\nMoving R might be better because it opens space.\n\nAlso, with head at (5,3), we can go up or right.\n\nLet's choose to move R at turn 21.\n\nThen for turn 22, from (5,3), move U to (5,4) to avoid the wall.\n\nThen at turn 23, from (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nThen at turn 24, from (4,4), move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4), say L to (3,4) to go left.\n\nThen at turn 25, from (3,4), move U to (3,5) or L to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut this doesn't eat the food.\n\nTo eat the food, at some point, when (4,1) is free, we can move towards it.\n\nFor example, after turn 22, (4,1) is free, so from turn 23 onwards, move towards (4,1).\n\nBut from (4,4) or (5,4), we can move down if possible.\n\nAt turn 23, after moving to (4,4), positions depend.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 21: move R to (5,3)\n\nAfter this, positions: H(5,3), B: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), T(4,1)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,4)\n\nPositions after: H(5,4), B: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), T(3,1)  -- (4,1) free\n\nFood at (4,1)\n\nHead at (5,4)\n\nTurn 23: move L to (4,4)\n\nPositions after: H(4,4), B: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), T(3,2)  -- (3,1) removed\n\nHead at (4,4)\n\nNow, we can move to (4,3) not possible, so move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) or R to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSay move L to (3,4) at turn 24.\n\nPositions after: H(3,4), B: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), T(2,2)  -- (3,2) removed\n\nHead at (3,4)\n\nFrom here, we can move D to (3,3) but occupied, or L to (2,4), or U to (3,5), or R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nMove L to (2,4) at turn 25.\n\nPositions: H(2,4), B: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), T(2,3)  -- (2,2) removed\n\nHead at (2,4)\n\nThen move D to (2,3) but occupied, or L to (1,4), or U to (2,5), or R to (3,4) occupied.\n\nMove L to (1,4) at turn 26, etc.\n\nBut we are moving away from the food.\n\nTo eat the food, from (3,4) at turn 24, instead of left, move down, but can't.\n\nMove to (3,5) at turn 24, then to (3,6), but y=6 is border? y=6 is within 1 to 6, but y=7 wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\nBut not towards food.\n\nPerhaps after turn 22, from (5,4), instead of left, move right to (6,4) at turn 23.\n\nThen from (6,4), move D to (6,3) or U to (6,5), etc.\n\nStill not.\n\nI think for the purpose of this response, I'll provide a sequence for 5 turns, and assume we eat the food later.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nSo for turn 21, move R to avoid the trap.\n\nThen move U to open space.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: L  ( to (4,4) )\n\nThen from (4,4), at turn 24, move U to (4,5) to go up.\n\nTurn 25: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) or L to (3,5), say U to (4,6)\n\netc.\n\nBut to include eating food, it might not be within 5 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can eat the food at turn 28.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 21, move U to (4,4)\n\nThen at turn 22, move L to (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 23, move L to (2,4)\n\nThen at turn 24, move D to (2,3) but occupied, so move U to (2,5) or L to (1,4)\n\nNot good.\n\nI think I have to accept that eating the food will take more than 5 turns, so for the sequence, I'll provide the first few moves for survival.\n\nSo for turn 21, move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22, move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 23, move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 24, from (4,4), move L to (3,4) (since D and R occupied or not desirable)\n\nFrom (4,4), after move to it at turn 23, positions: as above, H(4,4), B: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), T(3,2) -- let's not.\n\nAssume we move L to (3,4) at turn 24.\n\nTurn 25, from (3,4), move U to (3,5)\n\n Etc.\n\nBut to make it 5 turns, up to turn 25.\n\nTurn 21 to turn 25.\n\nAlso, the head direction: at turn 21, after move R, head direction R.\n\nThen turn 22 move U, so new direction U.\n\nTurn 23 move L, new direction L.\n\nTurn 24 move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 25 move U, direction U.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nBut we have the food to consider, but not eaten yet.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way.\n\nNotice that the snake has a segment at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), but (5,1) is tail.\n\nIf we move in a way that the head goes to (4,2) at some point.\n\nBut (4,2) is free.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22, move R to (6,3)  -- from (5,3), move R to (6,3)\n\nThen positions after: H(6,3), B: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), T(3,1)  -- (4,1) free\n\nHead at (6,3)\n\nTurn 23, move D to (6,2)  -- (6,2) free? Yes.\n\nPositions: H(6,2), B: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), T(3,2)  -- (3,1) removed\n\nHead at (6,2)\n\nTurn 24, move L to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, cannot.\n\nMove U to (6,3) occupied, or D to (6,1), or R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo move D to (6,1)\n\nPositions: H(6,1), B: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), T(2,2)  -- (3,2) removed\n\nHead at (6,1)\n\nThen turn 25, move L to (5,1) or U to (6,2) occupied, or D to (6,0) wall, or R to (7,1) wall.\n\nSo move L to (5,1) if free.\n\n(5,1) not occupied, so move L to (5,1)\n\nThen at (5,1), which is adjacent to (4,1) with food.\n\nAt turn 25, positions after move: H(5,1), B: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), T(2,3)  -- (2,2) removed\n\nFood at (4,1) is present.\n\nHead at (5,1), adjacent to (4,1) left.\n\nIf we move L to (4,1) at turn 26, we can eat the food, since (4,1) is free, and not tail, so no danger.\n\nThen it would be eaten at turn 26.\n\nLife span 8 from turn 21, so at turn 26, life span 8 - (26-21) = 3? Turn 21: life span 8, turn 22:7, turn 23:6, turn 24:5, turn 25:4, turn 26:3, so still present.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in this sequence, at turn 26, we can eat the food by moving left from (5,1).\n\nBut for the answer, we need actions from turn 21 to some turns.\n\nLet's list the actions:\n\nTurn 21: move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 24: move D to (6,1)  (since no other choice)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (5,1)\n\nThen at turn 26: move L to (4,1) to eat food.\n\nBut for the sequence, we can provide up to turn 25 or more.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 21 and go for several turns.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and \"prioritize long-term survival\", this sequence seems safe so far.\n\nAt turn 24, from (6,2), move D to (6,1), which is safe.\n\nThen turn 25 move L to (5,1), safe.\n\nThen turn 26 move L to (4,1), eat food, and since (4,1) is free, and head moves there, eats, grows, new tail added.\n\nPositions before move turn 26: head at (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), tail (2,3)\n\nMove to (4,1): new head (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (2,3) not removed, so new positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] length 9.\n\nNo collision, and food eaten.\n\nGood.\n\nFor the first 5 turns, we can output up to turn 25.\n\nt1=21, so turns 21 to 25.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nThen turn 26: L to eat, but not in the sequence.\n\nSince the answer format is to box the sequence.\n\nAlso, for turn 23, move D to (6,2), which is ok.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 22, move R to (6,3), from (5,3) with direction? After turn 21 move R, head direction R, so turn 22 move R is not reverse, ok.\n\nSimilarly, turn 23 move D, new direction D.\n\nTurn 24 move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 25 move L, from (6,1), move L to (5,1), not reverse since direction D, opposite U, so L is allowed.\n\nOk.\n\nTo make it 5 turns, we can stop at turn 25.\n\nBut turn 25 is t1+4, since t1=21, turn 25 is t1+4.\n\nt1=21, turn 21: t1, turn 22: t1+1, turn 23: t1+2, turn 24: t1+3, turn 25: t1+4.\n\nSo 5 actions: turn t1 to t1+4.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we want to include eating, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (4,1) while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that considers the grid constraints, snake positions, and food mechanics. The key priorities are:\n- **Avoid immediate risks**: Moving down to (4,2) on turn 21 is deadly due to no safe moves afterward, so it is avoided.\n- **Eat the food safely**: The food at (4,1) is under the snake's body and will become accessible after the tail moves away. By moving the snake to position the head near (4,1) when it is free, the food can be eaten around turn 26 without triggering tail reward danger.\n- **Long-term survival**: The sequence navigates open spaces to avoid walls and self-collision, with the food eaten by turn 26 (within its 8-turn lifespan). Moves are chosen to prevent trapping the snake.\n\n### Plan Summary:\n- **Turns 21-22**: Move right to (6,3) to open space and vacate (4,1) by turn 22.\n- **Turns 23-24**: Move down to (6,1) to approach the bottom row, avoiding the wall at (5,2).\n- **Turn 25**: Move left to (5,1), adjacent to the food at (4,1).\n- **Beyond (not in sequence)**: On turn 26, move left to (4,1) to eat the food safely, as (4,1) is free and not the tail.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake survives and eats the food by turn 26. The actions for turns 21-25 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 22: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 23: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 24: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 25: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 22, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x is 1 to 6, similarly y=1 to 6. But let's see the snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), etc., and food at (4,1) and (4,4). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So the tail is at (4,1).\n\nCurrent head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- At (4,1) with value 1 and life span 7. But (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's tail, as per positions. The food is at (4,1), but the snake is also at (4,1) for the tail segment.\n\nAccording to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So here, food is at (4,1), which is the tail position.\n\nAlso, there's another food at (4,4) with value 1 and life span 10.\n\nLife span: for (4,1) it's 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn, so it has 7 turns left including turn 22. Similarly, (4,4) has 10 turns left.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. That's 6x6, but positions include (3,1), (4,1), etc., so y=1 is valid, not wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,3) direction R\n\n- Body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1)\n\nSo the snake is 8 segments long.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,1): value +1, life span 7, but currently under tail.\n\n- (4,4): value +1, life span 10\n\nSince food at (4,1) is under the tail, to eat it, the tail must move away, and then head must move to (4,1). But the tail will move when the snake moves, so if the snake moves, the tail will leave (4,1) on the next turn.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nOn turn 22, snake head is at (5,3), moving right, so possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from current head direction R, possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right). L is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are around head (5,3):\n\n- Up: (5,4)\n\n- Down: (5,2)\n\n- Right: (6,3)\n\n- Left: (4,3) but (4,3) is the body, and also left is opposite direction, so not allowed anyway.\n\nLeft is (4,3), which is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision, unless it's the tail, but it's not, it's the neck.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nSo, for (5,3), neighbors:\n\n- North: (5,4) - is this free? Let's see occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nAlso walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacle (5,2)\n\nSo for (5,3):\n\n- Up: (5,4) - not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. y=4 is within 1-6, so free.\n\n- Down: (5,2) - this is the internal obstacle? (5,2) is the obstacle position? Internal obstacles: [(5,2)], so (5,2) is blocked, cannot move there.\n\n- Right: (6,3) - x=6, y=3. x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is valid, not wall. Not in snake positions? Snake has (5,3) but not (6,3), so free? But let's list all occupied.\n\nSnake: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nSo (6,3) not occupied.\n\nBut is (6,3) within bounds? x=6, y=3, walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=6 is ok, since x=7 is wall, x=6 is playable. Similarly y=3 ok.\n\n- Left: (4,3) - but this is the body segment, and also left is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move left anyway.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), R to (6,3). D to (5,2) is blocked by obstacle.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nNow, food is at (4,1) and (4,4).\n\n(4,1) is currently occupied by tail. When the snake moves, the tail will leave (4,1) only if the head moves to a new cell and the tail follows. Since the snake moves, the tail moves to the next position only if the head grows; otherwise, the tail moves away when not growing.\n\nBasic snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the previous second segment, so tail position is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, food at (4,1) is under tail. On the next turn, when snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail will move away from (4,1), so (4,1) becomes free, but the food is there, so it can be eaten later if head moves to it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is free now.\n\nLife span: food at (4,1) has life span 7, meaning it will disappear after turn 22 + 6? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 22, life span 7 means it has 7 turns left, including turn 22, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn t: life span N, so after N turns, it disappears. Since it decreases each turn including current, after k turns, life span becomes N - k.\n\nWhen life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (4,1): life span 7 at turn 22, so at turn 23, life span 6, ..., down to turn 28, life span 1? Turn 22: 7, turn 23:6, turn 24:5, turn 25:4, turn 26:3, turn 27:2, turn 28:1, turn 29:0, so it disappears after turn 28? When life span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn, or end?\n\nThe rule says: \"life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it decreases at the end of the turn or something. To be precise.\n\nAssume that at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span L, and after the turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during the turn, it eats it before disappearance if L=1.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify, but I think we can assume that during turn t, if life span >0, it can be eaten, and after eating, it's gone. If not eaten, at end of turn, life span decreases, and if becomes 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for disappearance.\n\nBut in this case, for (4,1): at turn 22, life span 7, so it will be present for turns 22 to 28, disappearing after turn 28 or during turn 29? Let's not overcomplicate; it has at least 7 turns from now.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life span 10, so many turns.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nFrom head (5,3), I can go U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is close to food at (4,4)? (4,4) is food, but (5,4) is adjacent.\n\n(6,3) is away.\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), then I'm at (5,4), and food is at (4,4), which is left from there, but I might not be able to go directly.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's the food under tail at (4,1).\n\nSince tail is at (4,1), and food there, if I can move the head to (4,1) after the tail leaves, I can eat it, but I need to time it.\n\nFirst, on this turn, turn 22, I need to choose action.\n\nOptions: U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3), what happens?\n\nNew head position: (6,3)\n\nThen snake moves: head to (6,3), so the body: since no food eaten, tail moves away, so new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, so (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), and tail was (4,1), but tail moves to the next, which is (4,1) was part of body, but since tail moves, the new tail is (3,1)? Let's list the positions after move.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ] head first.\n\nAfter moving right to (6,3), head moves to (6,3), and since no food eaten (assuming), the tail is removed, so new positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)\n\nThe last segment (4,1) is removed, so tail is now at (3,1).\n\nFood at (4,1) is now free, since tail moved away, so (4,1) has food with life span 6 now? After turn 22, life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 22 start, life span 7.\n\nAfter action, if not eaten, at end of turn, life span decreases to 6 for next turn.\n\nSimilarly, head direction: moved right, so now direction R.\n\nNow, if I go U to (5,4), new head (5,4), tail moves away, so new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) is now free, life span 6.\n\nFood at (4,4) still there.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating the food.\n\nAlso, there's a danger with the tail food.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, eating it would cause the snake to grow, so the tail doesn't move, and head moves to tail position, but then the new tail is the old tail position, but since head is there, it collides.\n\nSpecifically: when you eat food, head moves to food cell, and tail does not move, so snake grows. If the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it, then the new head is where tail was, and since tail doesn't move, the segment that was tail is now body, and head is there, but it's the same cell, so immediate collision? Or since head moves to that cell, and the tail segment is still there, but when you eat, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail remains, so if food was on tail, head moves to tail cell, but tail is still there, so head and tail are on same cell, collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nIn this case, food at (4,1) is on tail, so if head moves directly to (4,1) when tail is still there, it would eat and collide.\n\nBut if tail moves away first, then head can move to (4,1) safely.\n\nIn the move above, when I move away, tail leaves (4,1), so on next turns, (4,1) is free with food, and I can move head to it without danger, since tail is not adjacent or something.\n\nThe danger is only if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, then eating it causes collision.\n\nBut if tail has moved away, the food is on an empty cell, no problem.\n\nIn this case, after turn 22, if I move, tail leaves (4,1), so (4,1) is free with food, and head is not adjacent to it necessarily.\n\nFor example, after moving to (6,3), head at (6,3), food at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), head at (5,4), food at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nSo I can later move to (4,1) to eat it.\n\nBut (4,1) has life span 7 at turn 22, decreasing each turn, so I have time.\n\nNow, the other food at (4,4) is also positive.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells outside are walls, but we don't go there.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2) blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nSo the snake is coiled: from (5,3) right to left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), then down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then up to (3,1)? (3,2) to (3,1) is down, since y decreases.\n\ny=1 is bottom? Usually y=0 bottom or top, but here walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6, I assume y=1 bottom, y=6 top, or? Not specified, but in positions, (3,1) is given, and (4,1), so y=1 is the bottom row.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,1) and (4,4).\n\n(4,1) is bottom row, x=4.\n\n(4,4) is middle.\n\nNow, available moves: U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3): head to (6,3), which is the rightmost column, x=6.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or L to (5,3), but L to (5,3) is where the neck is, but after move, positions are head (6,3), body (5,3), etc., so (5,3) is body, not tail.\n\nTail is at (3,1) after move.\n\nFrom (6,3), directions: current direction after move is R, so cannot move L (left) opposite.\n\nPossible: U, D, R? R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (6,4), D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is free? x=6,y=2, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (5,2)), not snake? After move, snake at (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), so (6,2) free.\n\nSimilarly (6,4) free.\n\nBut (6,2) is down, y=2.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), I'm on the right edge, which might be risky because I have fewer options.\n\nIf I go U to (5,4): head to (5,4), which is above current, y=4.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: since moved up, direction U, so cannot move D (down) opposite.\n\nPossible: U to (5,5), D? cannot, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) has food, so I could go L to (4,4) and eat it on next turn, but not this turn.\n\nOn turn 22, if I go U to (5,4), I'm at (5,4), not eating (4,4) yet.\n\nThen on turn 23, from (5,4), I can go L to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (6,3), I'm farther.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,1) is below, and I might want to eat it later.\n\nBut there's a risk with the tail food, but as we said, after tail moves, it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body might block paths.\n\nLet me list all occupied cells after turn 22 move for both cases.\n\nFirst, option: move R on turn 22 to (6,3)\n\nAfter turn 22:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)\n\nFood: (4,1) is now free with food, life span 6 (after decrease).\n\n(4,4) with food, life span 9 (since at turn 22 start 10, after turn 22 decrease to 9? Let's define the life span at start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn t, food has life span L.\n\nDuring turn, if head moves to it, eat, and food gone.\n\nIf not eaten, at end of turn, L decreases by 1; if L=0, food disappears.\n\nFor turn 22, at start, (4,1) life span 7, (4,4) life span 10.\n\nIf I move to (6,3), not eating either, so after turn, (4,1) life span 6, (4,4) life span 9.\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nOn turn 23, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), cannot go L or R (R is wall, L opposite).\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf U to (6,4), then head to (6,4), direction U.\n\nThen body: head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), etc., tail at (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, if D to (6,2), head to (6,2), direction D.\n\nBut (6,2) is above obstacle (5,2), but (6,2) is free.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go U to (6,5), L to (5,4), or D to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, so cannot, or R wall.\n\nSince direction U, cannot move D down.\n\nPossible: U, L, R? R wall, so U or L.\n\nU to (6,5), L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) might be free, but after move to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)? After moving to (6,4), the body is previous positions minus tail, so from previous: after turn 22, positions [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)\n\nAfter moving U to (6,4) on turn 23, head to (6,4), and if not eating, tail moves, so new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\n(3,1) is removed.\n\nFood at (4,1) still there, life span now 5? After turn 23 decrease.\n\nBut (4,1) is free.\n\nNow, from (6,4), I can go L to (5,4) or U to (6,5).\n\n(5,4) is free, and (4,4) has food, so I can go to (5,4), then to (4,4) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the other option first.\n\nIf on turn 22 I go U to (5,4).\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,4)\n\nAfter move: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)\n\nFood at (4,1) free, life span 6.\n\nFood at (4,4) present, life span 9.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nOn turn 23, from (5,4), possible moves: since direction U, cannot move D down.\n\nPossible: U to (5,5), D? no, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) has food, so I can move L to (4,4) and eat it.\n\nIf I do that, on turn 23, move L to (4,4), eat food, so snake grows: new head at (4,4), and tail does not move, so positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // and tail at (3,1), but since eaten, tail stays, so the new tail is (3,1), and the segment before is (3,2), etc.\n\nAfter eating, the tail remains, so snake has 9 segments.\n\nThen life span of (4,4) decreases, but eaten, so gone.\n\nFood at (4,1) still there.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (4,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen on turn 24, from (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction L, so cannot move R right opposite.\n\nPossible: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4).\n\n(4,3) is body, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\n(3,4) is free? Not in positions.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nSo (4,3) occupied, (3,4) not, (4,5) not.\n\nSo from (4,4), can go U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but occupied, not possible, L to (3,4), or R to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied, and also R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction after moving L is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nD and R not possible or not allowed.\n\nNow, if I didn't eat on turn 23, I could go other places, but eating is good for score.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,1).\n\nIt has life span decreasing, and it's at (4,1), which is the bottom row.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the head to (4,1) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, after turn 22, it's free.\n\nBut from the snake position, after going to (5,4) and then to (4,4), head is at (4,4), which is above.\n\nFrom there, I can go down to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body.\n\nIn the position after eating at (4,4), (4,3) is occupied, so I cannot go down directly.\n\nI have to go to (4,5) or (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), then to (3,5) or (2,4) or down to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied.\n\nPositions: (3,3) is body.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nThen I might get stuck in the top-left area.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (4,5) from (4,4), then to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut the food at (4,1) is at bottom, with limited time.\n\nLife span at turn 22 start: 7, so after turn 22, 6, turn 23, 5, etc., so it disappears after turn 28 or when life span 0.\n\nTurn 22: L=7, after turn L=6 for turn 23, turn 23: L=6, after decrease L=5 for turn 24, ..., so at turn 28: L=1 for that turn, after decrease to 0, disappears, so can be eaten up to turn 28.\n\nTurn 28: L=1, if eaten, gone; if not, after turn L=0, gone.\n\nSo I have until turn 28 to eat it, 7 turns from turn 22.\n\nTurn 22 to turn 28 is 7 turns? Turn 22,23,24,25,26,27,28: 7 turns including 22.\n\nAt turn 22, L=7, it can be eaten during turns 22 to 28.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), L=10 at turn 22, so until turn 31.\n\nNow, back to the initial choice.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3) on turn 22, I might be cornered.\n\nFor example, at (6,3), I can go U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), then from there U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free, and (4,4) has food.\n\nSo on turn 24, from (6,4) I can go L to (5,4), then on turn 25 to (4,4) to eat, but that's later.\n\nLet's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider going U on turn 22 to (5,4).\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) tail (3,1)\n\nFood: (4,1) free, L=6 after turn; (4,4) L=9 after turn.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 23: from (5,4), I can:\n\n- Move L to (4,4) to eat food. Then positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)  // grown to 9 segments, tail at (3,1)\n\nDirection L.\n\nFood (4,4) eaten, gone. (4,1) still there L=5 for turn 24? After turn 23 decrease.\n\nTurn 23 start: (4,1) L=6 (after turn 22 decrease), after turn 23 not eaten, L=5 for turn 24.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFrom (4,4), turn 24: possible moves U to (4,5) or L to (3,4) (since D and R not possible or occupied).\n\nSay I go U to (4,5).\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), etc., tail at (3,1)? After move, if not eat, tail moves.\n\nFrom previous, positions before move: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nMove U to (4,5), not eating, so new head (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\n(3,1) removed.\n\nFood at (4,1) L=5 for turn 24.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 25: from (4,5), possible U to (4,6), D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nCannot D down opposite or occupied.\n\nSo U, L, R possible.\n\nU to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nAll free probably.\n\nBut I need to go down to eat (4,1), but it's far, and the body is blocking the way.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,4) but occupied, or (3,4), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), then L to (2,4) or D to (3,3) occupied, etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is occupied, so from (3,4) I can go U to (3,5) or L to (2,4) or D to (3,3) occupied not possible, R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf I go L to (2,4), then to (2,5) or (1,4) but x=1, or down to (2,3) occupied.\n\n(2,3) is body.\n\nSo I can go to (1,4), but x=1 is not wall, x=0 is wall, so x=1 ok.\n\nBut then I'm in top-left, and (4,1) is bottom, with decreasing life span.\n\nI might not make it in time to eat (4,1).\n\nIf I go R to (5,5) from (4,5), then to (5,6) or (6,5), etc., even farther.\n\nSo after eating (4,4), I might be unable to reach (4,1) before it disappears, and also the area might be tight.\n\nIf on turn 23 I don't eat (4,4), but go other way.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 23, instead of L to (4,4), I can go U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf U to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen I can go to (5,6) or (4,5) or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut still, to reach (4,1) is difficult.\n\nR to (6,4) from (5,4), then to (6,5) or (5,4) occupied, etc.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo going U on turn 22 might lead to eating (4,4) but then struggling to reach (4,1), and I might miss it.\n\nNow, the other option: on turn 22, go R to (6,3).\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,3)\n\nPositions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) tail (3,1)\n\nFood (4,1) free L=6 for turn 23; (4,4) L=9 for turn 23.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 23: from (6,3), move U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\nSuppose I go U to (6,4).\n\nPositions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail (3,2)  // (3,1) removed\n\nFood (4,1) L=5 for turn 24.\n\nHead at (6,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 24: from (6,4), move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nSay go L to (5,4).\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail (2,2)  // (3,2) removed?

Turn 24 start L=5, after not eaten, L=4 for turn 25.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 25: from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) occupied.\n\nD to (5,3) is body, occupied, and moving down, but current direction L, so moving down is allowed? Directions: current direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, but not R opposite.\n\nU, D, L possible, but D to (5,3) occupied, so only U or L.\n\nL to (4,4) or U to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) has food, so I can go L to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen eat on turn 25.\n\nBut (4,1) is still there, L=4 for turn 25, so can be eaten.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail (2,2) but since eaten, tail stays, so positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)  // 9 segments\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 26: from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4), R to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(4,3) occupied, so U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go down, but (4,3) occupied, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, go L to (3,4), then D to (3,3) occupied, so not possible, or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nAgain, stuck.\n\nIf from (5,4) on turn 25, I go U to (5,5) instead of eating, but that delays eating.\n\nNot better.\n\nBut I have the food at (4,1) to eat.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating the food at (4,1) first, since it has shorter life span and is closer in a way.\n\nAfter turn 22, if I go R to (6,3), head at (6,3), food at (4,1) is free.\n\nBut (6,3) to (4,1) is not direct, and body in between.\n\nFrom (6,3), on turn 23, I could go D to (6,2) instead of U.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (6,2)\n\nPositions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail (3,2)  // (3,1) removed\n\n(6,2) is free, no obstacle, since obstacle is at (5,2), not (6,2).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nFood (4,1) L=5 for turn 24.\n\nNow, from (6,2), turn 24: possible moves D to (6,1), U to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot move, R wall.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U up opposite.\n\nPossible: D, L, R? R wall, L to (5,2) obstacle, so only D to (6,1).\n\nMust move D to (6,1).\n\nThen head to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail (2,2)  // (3,2) removed\n\nDirection D.\n\nFood (4,1) L=4 for turn 25.\n\nNow at (6,1), turn 25: possible moves D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, cannot; U to (6,2) occupied; L to (5,1), R wall.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U up opposite.\n\nPossible: D, L, R? D to wall not possible, R wall, so only L to (5,1) if possible.\n\n(5,1) is free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (5,2)), so (5,1) free.\n\nSo move L to (5,1).\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail (2,3)  // (2,2) removed?

U to (5,2) obstacle, D to wall, L to (4,1).\n\nSo only possible move L to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) has food, so I can move to (4,1) and eat it.\n\nNow, is there danger? Head is at (5,1), tail is at (2,3), not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nMove to (4,1), eat food, so snake grows: new head at (4,1), tail does not move, so positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)  // and since eaten, tail at (2,3) stays, so 9 segments.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I have eaten the food at (4,1) on turn 26.\n\nLife span was L=4 at turn 25 start, eaten on turn 26, so before decrease.\n\nTurn 26 start, food (4,1) L=3, eaten, gone.\n\nNow, the other food at (4,4) is still there, L=10 at turn 22, so after decreases, at turn 26 start, L=10 - (26-22) = 10 - 4 = 6? Let's track.\n\nTurn 22 start: L=10 for (4,4)\n\nAfter turn 22 decrease, L=9 for turn 23\n\nTurn 23 decrease, L=8 for turn 24\n\nTurn 24 decrease, L=7 for turn 25\n\nTurn 25 decrease, L=6 for turn 26\n\nTurn 26 decrease, but eaten? Not yet.\n\nAt turn 26 start, L=6 for (4,4).\n\nAfter eating (4,1), head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nNow, I can plan to go to (4,4).\n\nBut the body is blocking the way.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2), but (4,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\ny=2, x=4.\n\nObstacle at (5,2), so (4,2) free.\n\nOr D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) or (4,0) wall, x=4,y=1, left is (3,1), right is (5,1) occupied.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R right opposite.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, not possible.\n\nU to (4,2), L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) free? Not in positions.\n\nPositions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) so (3,1) not occupied.\n\n(4,2) not occupied.\n\nSo U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), then to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, not possible.\n\n(4,3) is body, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (4,1), U to (4,2) is possible, but then from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3) occupied, or L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) obstacle.\n\n(3,2) might be free.\n\nBut let's not get into details yet.\n\nSince I need to go up to (4,4), but (4,3) is blocked, I have to go around, e.g., left to (3,1) or (3,2), then up.\n\nBut (4,4) has life span decreasing, but still several turns.\n\nIn this path, by going R then D then L then L, I was able to eat (4,1) on turn 26.\n\nIf I had gone U on turn 22, I might not reach (4,1) in time.\n\nMoreover, in that case, I could also eat (4,4) later, though it might be tight.\n\nBut let's see the first move.\n\nAnother thing: in the R path, when I went to (6,2) and then to (6,1), I was forced to move left to (5,1), then to (4,1), which worked.\n\nBut I could have gone U from (6,3) instead, but that led to eating (4,4) later but missing (4,1).\n\nBy going D on turn 23, I could reach (4,1) to eat.\n\nNow, for the initial choice, going R on turn 22 seems better to access the bottom food.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 22 going U, I can reach (4,1).\n\nSuppose turn 22: move U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 23: instead of eating (4,4), go down or something.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go R to (6,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nSay go R to (6,4).\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,3), etc., tail at (3,1)\n\nThen from (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) occupied, or U to (6,5), or L to (5,4) occupied.\n\nCurrent direction after moving R? Turn 22 moved U to (5,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 23 move R to (6,4), so direction now R.\n\nThen turn 24: from (6,4), direction R, cannot move L left opposite.\n\nPossible U to (6,5), D to (6,3) occupied, R wall.\n\nSo only U to (6,5).\n\nThen to (6,6), etc., far from (4,1).\n\nIf from (5,4) turn 23 go D, but cannot, direction U, cannot D.\n\nOnly U, L, R, but R to (6,4), L to (4,4) eat, U to (5,5).\n\nNo down option.\n\nSo from (5,4), I cannot go down at all because (5,3) is occupied and direction constraint.\n\nTherefore, after going U on turn 22, I am stuck in the upper part and cannot easily reach (4,1) before it disappears.\n\nWhereas by going R on turn 22, I can go down and reach (4,1) around turn 26.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,1), I can try to reach (4,4), though it might be challenging with the body, but (4,4) has more life span.\n\nLife span at turn 26: as above, L=6 for (4,4), so until turn 31.\n\nFrom head at (4,1), I can move to (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (3,1), then to (3,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied, so to reach (4,4), I need to go left and up, then right, but the grid is small.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) go L to (3,1), then U to (3,2)? (3,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating (4,1) on turn 26, positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo (3,2) not occupied, free.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\nSo turn 27: from (4,1), move to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nSay go L to (3,1).\n\nThen positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), etc., tail at (2,3)?

From above, after move to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) so (3,3) not present, (4,3) is body.\n\nFrom (3,2), turn 29: can move U to (3,3), but (3,3) not occupied? In positions, (3,3) is not there, last is (4,3).\n\n(3,3) is free? Let's list occupied: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) so cells: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) so (3,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly (4,2) free, etc.\n\nFrom (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) occupied, L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nCurrent direction after moving U? Turn 28 moved U to (3,2), direction U.\n\nTurn 29: direction U, cannot move D down opposite.\n\nPossible U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nAll possible.\n\nIf go U to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,4), from (3,3) go R to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, not possible.\n\n(4,3) is body.\n\nFrom (3,3), can go U to (3,4), then to (4,4).\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nSo possible to reach (4,4) via (3,3), (3,4), then (4,4).\n\nFor example, from (3,2) on turn 29, go U to (3,3), then turn 30 go U to (3,4), turn 31 go R to (4,4) to eat.\n\n(4,4) L=6 at turn 26, turn 27 L=5, turn 28 L=4, turn 29 L=3, turn 30 L=2, turn 31 L=1, can eat on turn 31.\n\nSo possible.\n\nIf I go directly from (4,2) earlier, but in this sequence it works.\n\nTherefore, by going R on turn 22, I can eat both foods: (4,1) around turn 26 and (4,4) around turn 31.\n\nIf I go U on turn 22, I eat (4,4) earlier but miss (4,1), and might have space issues.\n\nMoreover, since both foods are +1, eating both is better.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: after eating both, the snake is longer, but the grid has space, I can navigate.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,4), head at (4,4), and the body is spread, I can move to top or right.\n\nBut not necessary to plan that far.\n\nNow, for turn 22, action should be R.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to specify multiple turns, but the question is to think ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 22.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, just the immediate and think ahead.\n\nBut for this, I can output turn 22: R\n\nThen the subsequent moves can be as above.\n\nBut to be complete, I should provide a sequence.\n\nSince the future depends, but for now, turn 22 move R.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 23, I moved D to (6,2), which was necessary to reach down.\n\nIf I moved U, I might not reach (4,1).\n\nSo for the plan, I should commit to going down to eat (4,1).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: D to (6,2)  // to go down\n\nTurn 24: D to (6,1)  // forced, only choice\n\nTurn 25: L to (5,1)  // only choice, to left\n\nTurn 26: L to (4,1) and eat\n\nThen later to (4,4).\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 22.\n\nAnd since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions.\n\nFor turn 22, action is R.\n\nThen for turn 23, depending on state, but I can plan.\n\nIn this case, after turn 22 move R, the state allows to go D or U, but to reach (4,1), I should go D.\n\nSimilarly, subsequent moves.\n\nSo I can output:\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D  // to (6,1)\n\nTurn 25: L  // to (5,1)\n\nTurn 26: L  // to (4,1) and eat\n\nBut on turn 26, moving to (4,1) is L from (5,1).\n\nNow, after that, to go to (4,4), but that might be for later turns.\n\nThe answer can be up to where I decide.\n\nSince the question says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nI think for now, I can output these.\n\nTo maximize, I should consider if there is negative food, but here both positive.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) was under tail, but after turn 22, it's free.\n\nIn the sequence, I eat it safely.\n\nIf I go U on turn 22, I might eat (4,4) but lose (4,1).\n\nSo R is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 22, action is R.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the snake's current position, direction, food locations, life spans, and potential risks. The grid is 6x6 (cells from (1,1) to (6,6)) with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake starts at turn 22 with head at (5,3) moving right (direction R), body segments trailing, and two positive food items: one at (4,1) with life span 7 and one at (4,4) with life span 10. Both foods have a value of +1, but the food at (4,1) is currently under the tail segment at (4,1) and can only be eaten after the tail moves away.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 22)**: From (5,3) with direction R, possible moves are U (up to (5,4)), D (down to (5,2)), or R (right to (6,3)). However, D is blocked by the obstacle at (5,2), and L (left) is invalid due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule and collision with the body at (4,3). Thus, only U and R are valid.\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - Food at (4,1) has a shorter life span (7 turns starting from turn 22) and must be eaten by turn 28. After the snake moves on turn 22, the tail leaves (4,1), making the food accessible. Eating this food requires the head to reach (4,1) safely.\n  - Food at (4,4) has a longer life span (10 turns) and can be eaten later (by turn 31). However, the snake's body blocks direct access from some positions.\n- **Risks**: \n  - Moving to the right edge (e.g., (6,3)) risks reduced mobility, as only U or D moves are possible from there, potentially leading to dead ends.\n  - \"Tail Reward Danger\" is not an immediate concern for (4,1) after turn 22, as the tail moves away, making it safe to eat once the head reaches it.\n  - Long-term survival requires avoiding areas where the body might trap the snake, especially after eating.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - **Path to (4,1)**: To eat (4,1) before it expires, the head should move right to (6,3) on turn 22, then down to access the bottom row. This path allows reaching (4,1) by turn 26.\n  - **Path to (4,4)**: After eating (4,1), the head can navigate left and up to reach (4,4) by turn 31, leveraging the longer life span. The body will shift, creating space.\n  - **Alternative Path (U on Turn 22)**: Moving up to (5,4) allows faster access to (4,4) (e.g., by turn 23) but makes reaching (4,1) difficult due to body blocks and direction constraints. This risks missing (4,1), reducing the potential score from 2 to 1. Thus, prioritizing (4,1) first is better for maximizing score.\n- **Sequence Feasibility**: \n  - Moving right on turn 22 avoids immediate traps and sets up a safe descent. \n  - From (6,3), moving down on turn 23 is critical to reach the bottom. \n  - Subsequent moves are constrained but lead directly to (4,1) by turn 26. \n  - After eating (4,1), moving left and up via (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4) reaches (4,4) by turn 31, avoiding collisions.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 22 to 26):\n- **Turn 22**: Move R to (6,3) – Positions head near the right edge, allowing downward movement to access (4,1). Avoids the risk of being trapped in the upper rows if U was chosen.\n- **Turn 23**: Move D to (6,2) – Heads downward; only D is possible after moving to (6,3) due to direction constraints and occupied cells.\n- **Turn 24**: Move D to (6,1) – Continues descent; only D is possible from (6,2) due to walls and obstacles.\n- **Turn 25**: Move L to (5,1) – Moves left toward (4,1); only L is possible from (6,1) due to direction and occupied cells.\n- **Turn 26**: Move L to (4,1) and eat – Safely consumes the food at (4,1) now that the tail has moved away. Snake grows to 9 segments.\n\n### Beyond Turn 26 (for Completeness):\n- **Turns 27-31**: From (4,1), move L to (3,1) on turn 27, U to (3,2) on turn 28, U to (3,3) on turn 29, U to (3,4) on turn 30, and R to (4,4) to eat on turn 31. This path avoids body collisions and uses the remaining life span of (4,4).\n\nThis plan eats both foods, increasing the snake's length by 2, and ensures survival by avoiding dead ends. The initial right move on turn 22 is optimal for long-term access to both rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 23: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 24: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 25: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 26: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nCurrent snake positions: head at (6,3), then body segments at (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is R (right), meaning it just moved to the right to (6,3).\n\nFood available:\n\n- At (4,1) with life_span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (4,4) with life_span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. X from 0 to 7, Y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: border cells, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly horizontal on row 3, from x=2 to x=6, but then it turns down at (2,3) to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then up to (3,1). Let's list the positions in order:\n\nIndex 0: (6,3) head\n\nIndex 1: (5,3)\n\nIndex 2: (4,3)\n\nIndex 3: (3,3)\n\nIndex 4: (2,3)\n\nIndex 5: (2,2)\n\nIndex 6: (3,2)\n\nIndex 7: (3,1) tail\n\nFrom head to tail: (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> down to (2,2) -> right to (3,2) -> up to (3,1).\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so it was moving right to (6,3).\n\nNow possible moves from (6,3): since direction is R, I can go U, D, R. Can't go L because that would be opposite to R, and no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so next move cannot be L (left), because that's opposite. So possible: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to.\n\nIf I go R (right) to (7,3): but x=7 is a wall, so I die. Can't go there.\n\nIf I go U (up) to (6,4): is that valid? y=4, x=6. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is fine. But need to check if it collides with body or obstacle.\n\nObstacle at (5,2), not here. Body positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). None at (6,4), so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, D (down) to (6,2): y=2, x=6. Not a wall. Obstacle at (5,2), but (6,2) is different. Body positions: (5,3) is at y=3, not y=2. (2,2) is at x=2, not x=6. (3,2) is at x=3. So (6,2) is empty. But (5,2) is obstacle, but that's not (6,2). So (6,2) should be safe.\n\n(6,2) is not occupied by snake or wall, so yes.\n\nNow, food: one at (4,1), one at (4,4).\n\n(4,1) has life_span 6, current turn t1=23, so it disappears after 6 turns? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so after N turns it disappears.\n\nLife_span N means it will disappear after N turns from now, including this turn. So if life_span is 6, after 6 turns it will be gone. Similarly for 9.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to the food.\n\nFirst, from current position (6,3), I can go U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or R but R is wall, so only U or D.\n\nNow, if I go U to (6,4), then from there, possible moves depend on direction.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nBut I need to consider the tail situation because of the tail reward danger.\n\nTail is at (3,1). If I eat food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move for that turn.\n\nBut in this case, no food eaten yet.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,1). Is there food at (3,1)? Food is at (4,1) and (4,4), not at (3,1). So no issue now.\n\nBut if I move, tail might move, etc.\n\nI should simulate a few moves.\n\nAlso, the snake will move, so positions change.\n\nLet me denote the grid.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. But since it's border, x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nFood: (4,1) and (4,4)\n\nNow, current turn t1=23.\n\nI need to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many turns? The answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to plan a sequence, but since the state changes, I should plan for the immediate action and perhaps a few more, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead for decision making, but the output might be for several turns.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how many, so I need to provide a sequence of actions. But since the state evolves, I should probably provide actions until I eat food or something, but that might be variable. I think for this, I should provide at least 5 actions or so, but let's see.\n\nPerhaps I should decide the first move based on long-term thinking.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, I'll evaluate the options.\n\nFirst, from (6,3), possible moves: U, D, R (but R is wall, so invalid). So only U or D.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (6,4) at turn 23.\n\nThen snake head moves to (6,4), and since no food eaten, tail moves away from (3,1) to the next segment, so tail is now at (3,2)? Let's see.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail moves away.\n\nSo positions: new head at (6,4)\n\nThen body: segment 1 (was at (5,3)) moves to where head was, (6,3)\n\nSegment 2 (was at (4,3)) moves to (5,3)\n\nSegment 3 (was at (3,3)) moves to (4,3)\n\nSegment 4 (was at (2,3)) moves to (3,3)\n\nSegment 5 (was at (2,2)) moves to (2,3)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions:\n\n0: (6,3) head\n\n1: (5,3)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (3,3)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\n5: (2,2)\n\n6: (3,2)\n\n7: (3,1) tail\n\nAfter move U:\n\nHead moves to (6,4)  // new position\n\nThen segment 1 moves to previous head position (6,3)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (5,3)\n\nSegment 3 moves to (4,3)\n\nSegment 4 moves to (3,3)\n\nSegment 5 moves to (2,3)  // since segment 4 was at (2,3)? No.\n\nSegment indices: after head move, each body segment takes the position of the previous one.\n\nSo new positions:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nIndex 1: position of old index 0: (6,3)\n\nIndex 2: position of old index 1: (5,3)\n\nIndex 3: position of old index 2: (4,3)\n\nIndex 4: position of old index 3: (3,3)\n\nIndex 5: position of old index 4: (2,3)\n\nIndex 6: position of old index 5: (2,2)\n\nIndex 7: position of old index 6: (3,2)\n\nAnd tail was index 7, now index 7 is at (3,2), and the old tail (3,1) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nTail is now at (3,2).\n\nDirection: since I moved U, new head direction is U.\n\nNow, food: (4,1) and (4,4) still there, life_span decreases by 1? Turn 23, so after this turn, life_span of both decreases to 5 and 8 respectively? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t1=23, before action, life_span is 6 and 9.\n\nAfter turn 23, when we process the turn, life_span decreases.\n\nTypically, in such games, at the start of turn, we have state, then we choose action, then we update.\n\nBut for life_span, it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, before action, life_span is given, then after action, it decreases.\n\nI think for planning, we consider the current state.\n\nAt turn 23, before action, food at (4,1) has life_span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so it will be gone at turn 29? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life_span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nAt turn t, life_span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N-1 =0 after N-1 turns from t? Let's think.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, life_span is L.\n\nAfter the turn is processed (action taken, etc.), at the end of turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n\nSo if L=1 at start of turn, after the turn, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten only on that turn if head moves to it.\n\nSimilarly, if L=6 at turn 23 start, after turn 23, it becomes 5, and so on, until after turn 28, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 23 to 28 inclusive.\n\nTurn 23: life_span 6, can be eaten, after eat or not, at end of turn, life_span decreases to 5.\n\nTurn 24: life_span 5, can be eaten, decreases to 4, etc.\n\nTurn 28: life_span 1, can be eaten, after turn, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo food at (4,1) can be eaten on turns 23 to 28.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life_span 9, can be eaten from turn 23 to 31.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4) at turn 23.\n\nNew head at (6,4), no food there, so no growth. Snake moves as above.\n\nNow, from (6,4), head direction U, so possible moves: U, L, R (since not down, opposite).\n\nCannot move D, opposite to U.\n\nSo U (up to (6,5)), L (left to (5,4)), R (right to (7,4)) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible U or L.\n\nIf U to (6,5), then head at (6,5), etc.\n\nOr L to (5,4).\n\nNow, similarly, if I had gone D from (6,3) at turn 23.\n\nMove D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is not wall, not body, not obstacle. Obstacle at (5,2), but (6,2) is different.\n\nSo new head at (6,2), direction D.\n\nNo food at (6,2), so no growth.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2)\n\nThen body: index 1: old head (6,3)\n\nIndex 2: old index 1 (5,3)\n\nIndex 3: old index 2 (4,3)\n\nIndex 4: old index 3 (3,3)\n\nIndex 5: old index 4 (2,3)\n\nIndex 6: old index 5 (2,2)\n\nIndex 7: old index 6 (3,2)\n\nOld tail (3,1) vacated.\n\nSo snake: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nNow, from (6,2), direction D, so possible moves: D, L, R (not U, opposite).\n\nD to (6,1), L to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle! Invalid.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,2) is obstacle, so only possible D to (6,1)? Let's see.\n\nMoves: from (6,2), direction down, so I can go D (down to (6,1)), L (left to (5,2)), R (right to (7,2)).\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\n(7,2) is wall, cannot go.\n\n(6,1) is not wall? y=1, not y=0, so it should be ok, as long as not body or obstacle.\n\nBody: new positions have (6,3), (5,3), etc., not (6,1). Obstacle only at (5,2), not (6,1). So (6,1) is empty.\n\nSo only possible move from (6,2) is D to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), direction D, possible D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; L to (5,1); R to (7,1) wall invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1), if possible.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to choose the first move.\n\nGoing D from (6,3) leads to (6,2), then only to (6,1), then to (5,1) or something, but it might be dead end or risky.\n\nWhereas going U to (6,4) allows more flexibility.\n\nAlso, food at (4,4) is above, at y=4, and (4,1) below at y=1.\n\n(4,4) has longer life_span, 9 vs 6 for (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is closer to the tail area.\n\nLet me think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, to (4,4): from current head (6,3), I can go U to (6,4), then L to (5,4), then L to (4,4), but (5,4) to (4,4) is left.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (5,4), then to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is food, so if I go directly, I can eat it in two moves: turn 23 U to (6,4), turn 24 L to (5,4), turn 25 L to (4,4)? Let's see.\n\nTurn 23: from (6,3) move U to (6,4) - not food.\n\nThen turn 24: from (6,4) move L to (5,4) - not food.\n\nThen turn 25: move L to (4,4) - eat food there.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nSimilarly, to (4,1): from (6,3) move D to (6,2), then D to (6,1), then L to (5,1), then L to (4,1), or something.\n\nBut from (6,3) to (4,1) is not direct.\n\nCurrent position (6,3), (4,1) is left and down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,2), which might block paths.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around.\n\nNow, if I go D to (6,2), then I have to go D to (6,1), then from (6,1), I can go L to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) has life_span 6, so I have time.\n\nBut going down might be riskier because of the obstacle and walls.\n\nMoreover, after going D, I'm forced to go D again to (6,1), then from there, I can go L to (5,1).\n\nNow, (5,1) is adjacent to obstacle (5,2), but not same cell.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) but obstacle, invalid; D to (5,0) wall invalid; L to (4,1); R to (6,1) but that's where I came from, but might be body now.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt turn 23, move D to (6,2)\n\nSnake: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow turn 24, from (6,2), only possible move D to (6,1) as L and R invalid.\n\nMove D to (6,1)\n\nNew head (6,1), no food, so body moves: index 1: (6,2), index 2: (6,3), index 3: (5,3), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (3,3), index 6: (2,3), index 7: (2,2)  // old index 7 was (3,2), so new index 7 is old index 6 (2,2)? Positions:\n\nAfter move to (6,1):\n\nHead: (6,1)\n\nIndex 1: old head (6,2)\n\nIndex 2: old index 1 (6,3)\n\nIndex 3: old index 2 (5,3)\n\nIndex 4: old index 3 (4,3)\n\nIndex 5: old index 4 (3,3)\n\nIndex 6: old index 5 (2,3)\n\nIndex 7: old index 6 (2,2)  // and old tail (3,2) vacated, but since no eat, tail moves.\n\nTail is now at (2,2).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow turn 25, from (6,1), direction down, possible moves: D to (6,0) wall invalid; L to (5,1); R to (7,1) wall invalid. So only L to (5,1).\n\nMove L to (5,1)\n\n(5,1) not food, no growth.\n\nNew head (5,1)\n\nDirection L (since left from down? Direction is now left.\n\nPrevious direction was down, I move left, so new direction left.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,1), direction L, so U, D, L (not R, opposite).\n\nU to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (5,0) wall invalid.\n\nL to (4,1)\n\nR to (6,1) but that might be body.\n\nR is opposite to L? Direction is L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,2) obstacle invalid.\n\nD to (5,0) invalid.\n\nL to (4,1) which is food.\n\nSo must move L to (4,1) at turn 25? Turn 25: move to (4,1), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows, so new head at (4,1), and tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, and new segment added? When eat, head moves to food, new segment added at tail, so tail position remains.\n\nIn this case, at turn 25, before move, snake positions: head at (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail at (2,2)\n\nAfter move L to (4,1)? From (6,1) to (5,1) first? No.\n\nTurn 25: from (6,1) move L to (5,1) -- not food, so no growth, head to (5,1), body moves: index 1: (6,1) old head? After move to (5,1):\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nIndex 1: old head (6,1)? No.\n\nPrevious positions: head (6,1), index 1: (6,2), index 2: (6,3), index 3: (5,3), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (3,3), index 6: (2,3), index 7: (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (5,1):\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nIndex 1: old head position (6,1)\n\nIndex 2: old index 1 (6,2)\n\nIndex 3: old index 2 (6,3)\n\nIndex 4: old index 3 (5,3)\n\nIndex 5: old index 4 (4,3)\n\nIndex 6: old index 5 (3,3)\n\nIndex 7: old index 6 (2,3)  // and old index 7 (2,2) vacated.\n\nTail at (2,3)\n\nNow at (5,1), no food, so on turn 26, from (5,1) move to (4,1), which is food.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (4,1), eat food.\n\nThen head moves to (4,1), and since eat, new segment added, so tail doesn't move, meaning the body segments stay, but new head position.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail remains in place for that turn.\n\nSo positions: head to (4,1), then the body segments move to previous positions except the tail stays.\n\nSpecifically: new head at food cell (4,1), then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but since we add a segment, the tail position is duplicated or something.\n\nStandard snake: when eating, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't advance; it stays, and we have an extra segment.\n\nSo in this case, before move, positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3)? Indices:\n\nAfter turn 25 move to (5,1), positions are: 0: (5,1), 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3)\n\nNow turn 26: move to (4,1) and eat food.\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nThen, since eat, new segment added, so body: segment 1: position of old head (5,1)\n\nSegment 2: position of old index 1 (6,1)\n\nSegment 3: position of old index 2 (6,2)\n\nSegment 4: position of old index 3 (6,3)\n\nSegment 5: position of old index 4 (5,3)\n\nSegment 6: position of old index 5 (4,3)\n\nSegment 7: position of old index 6 (3,3)\n\nSegment 8: position of old index 7 (2,3)  // this is the new segment, so tail still at (2,3)\n\nOld tail was at (2,3), now new segment at (2,3), and the previous segments moved.\n\nSo snake has 9 segments now: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3)\n\nAnd direction from (5,1) to (4,1) is left, so head direction L.\n\nNow, from here, I can move, but there might be risks.\n\nBut back to choice.\n\nIf I go down at turn 23, I can reach (4,1) by turn 26, eating it.\n\nBut I have to go through (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), then (4,1).\n\nNow, the problem is that when I go to (6,2), then to (6,1), I'm close to wall y=0.\n\nAlso, after eating, I'm at (4,1), which is near the obstacle and walls.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free? Not body, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nOr L to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut the area is a bit cramped.\n\nMoreover, the other food at (4,4) is still there.\n\nNow, if I go up at turn 23 to (6,4), I can reach (4,4) faster.\n\nTurn 23: U to (6,4) not food.\n\nTurn 24: from (6,4) I can go L to (5,4) not food.\n\nTurn 25: L to (4,4) eat food.\n\nSo eat at turn 25.\n\nAfter turn 23 move U to (6,4), snake: as before, [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 24: move L to (5,4) — not food.\n\nNew head (5,4), body: index 1: (6,4), index 2: (6,3), index 3: (5,3), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (3,3), index 6: (2,3), index 7: (2,2)  // old index 7 (3,2) vacated? Positions:\n\nAfter move to (5,4):\n\nHead: (5,4)\n\nIndex 1: old head (6,4)\n\nIndex 2: old index 1 (6,3)\n\nIndex 3: old index 2 (5,3)\n\nIndex 4: old index 3 (4,3)\n\nIndex 5: old index 4 (3,3)\n\nIndex 6: old index 5 (2,3)\n\nIndex 7: old index 6 (2,2)  // tail at (2,2)\n\nDirection L (left from up).\n\nTurn 25: move L to (4,4) eat food.\n\nNew head (4,4), and grow, so body: segment 1: old head (5,4)\n\nSegment 2: old index 1 (6,4)\n\nSegment 3: old index 2 (6,3)\n\nSegment 4: old index 3 (5,3)\n\nSegment 5: old index 4 (4,3)\n\nSegment 6: old index 5 (3,3)\n\nSegment 7: old index 6 (2,3)\n\nSegment 8: old index 7 (2,2)  // new segment, tail at (2,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail at (2,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow from here, I have more space to move, for example, I can go U to (4,5), or D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, cannot, or L to (3,4), etc.\n\n(4,3) is body, so I cannot go there.\n\nPossible moves from (4,4): direction L, so U, D, L (not R opposite).\n\nU to (4,5), D to (4,3) but occupied, invalid, L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but occupied and opposite? R is right, direction is left, so cannot move R.\n\nSo possible U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nBoth should be free.\n\n(4,5) not occupied, (3,4) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to other areas.\n\nNow, comparing the two options:\n\n- Going U at turn 23 leads to eating (4,4) at turn 25, with 9 life_span, plenty of time, and after eating, I'm in a more open area with y=4, away from walls.\n\n- Going D at turn 23 leads to eating (4,1) at turn 26, with life_span 6, just in time, and after eating, I'm near the bottom wall and obstacle, which might be risky for future moves.\n\nMoreover, when going down, at turn 24 I have to go to (6,1), which is close to y=0, and only one way out to (5,1), which is a bit dangerous.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: after eating (4,1), the tail is at (2,3), and head at (4,1), not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut in the long run, the bottom area has less space.\n\nAdditionally, there is the food at (4,1) which has shorter life, but since I can eat it later, but going down forces me to eat it or I might lose it.\n\nBut with going up, I eat (4,4) quickly, then I can consider going to (4,1) later if possible.\n\n(4,1) life_span 6, from turn 23 to 28.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) at turn 25, I can then go down to (4,3) but occupied, or from (4,4) I can go U to (4,5), or L to (3,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,1) from there.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), go D, but (4,3) is body, cannot. Go L to (3,4), then D to (3,3) but (3,3) might be body? After eating at (4,4), positions include (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nAfter eating (4,4) at turn 25, snake: head (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied, (3,3) occupied, etc.\n\nFrom head (4,4), I can only go U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nSay I go L to (3,4) at turn 26.\n\nThen head to (3,4), no food, so body moves: head (3,4), index1: (4,4), index2: (5,4), index3: (6,4), index4: (6,3), index5: (5,3), index6: (4,3), index7: (3,3), index8: (2,3)  // tail at (2,3), old tail (2,2) vacated.\n\nDirection from (4,4) to (3,4) is left, so direction L.\n\nNow at (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but occupied, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) occupied and opposite? Direction L, so cannot R.\n\nPossible U to (3,5), D to (3,3) invalid, L to (2,4), R invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(2,4) might be free, or (3,5).\n\nBut to go down to (4,1), I need to go through (3,3) but it's occupied.\n\nI have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) go U to (3,5), then right to (4,5), then down to (4,4) but occupied, not good.\n\nGo L to (2,4), then down to (2,3) but occupied, etc.\n\nIt might take many turns to reach (4,1), and by turn 28, it disappears, so I might not make it.\n\nTurn 26: at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: say go U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 28: go R to (4,5)\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) but occupied, or R to (5,5), etc., not directly to (4,1).\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go to (3, something) then down, but (3,3) is occupied until the snake moves.\n\nThe body will move as I go.\n\nBut it might be inefficient.\n\nSince (4,3) is occupied, and I'm at (4,4), I cannot go directly down.\n\nThe only way is to go left or up and circle around, which could take 4-5 turns, and (4,1) expires after turn 28, so if I start from turn 25, I have turns 26,27,28 to reach it, which might not be enough depending on path.\n\nFor example, shortest path: from (4,4) to (4,1) is 3 steps down, but blocked by body.\n\nI have to go to (3,4), then (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied, so cannot. On turn 26, if I go to (3,4), (3,3) is still occupied.\n\n(3,3) is index7 in the list after turn 25, but as I move, it changes.\n\nAfter turn 25: positions: 0:(4,4), 1:(5,4), 2:(6,4), 3:(6,3), 4:(5,3), 5:(4,3), 6:(3,3), 7:(2,3), 8:(2,2)\n\nTurn 26: move to (3,4) — not food, so head to (3,4), body moves: index1: (4,4), index2: (5,4), index3: (6,4), index4: (6,3), index5: (5,3), index6: (4,3), index7: (3,3), index8: (2,3)  // tail at (2,3), old (2,2) vacated.\n\nNow (3,3) is still occupied by index7.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go D to (3,3) but occupied, invalid.\n\nGo L to (2,4), which might be free.\n\n(2,4) not occupied.\n\nThen turn 27: at (2,4), direction from (3,4) to (2,4) is left, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,5), D to (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied (index8), invalid, L to (1,4), R to (3,4) occupied and opposite.\n\nSo U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n\nSay go U to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 28: from (2,5) to (2,6) or (1,5) or (3,5), etc., still not to (4,1).\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go down, but (2,3) is occupied until the tail moves.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), and as I move, it will move, but slowly.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,5), then I'm far.\n\nFrom (2,4) I could go L to (1,4), then down, but (1,3) might be free, but (4,1) is at bottom.\n\nIt would take many turns, and (4,1) expires at end of turn 28, so I need to be on (4,1) by turn 28 to eat it.\n\nFrom turn 26 at (3,4), on turn 27 I can go to (2,4), then on turn 28 to (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied until I move away.\n\nOn turn 28, if I move to (2,3), but it might be free by then.\n\nLet's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 26: snake at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 27: suppose I move from (3,4) to (2,4)\n\nHead to (2,4), body moves: index1: (3,4), index2: (4,4), index3: (5,4), index4: (6,4), index5: (6,3), index6: (5,3), index7: (4,3), index8: (3,3)  // and index9: (2,3)? No, no growth, so 9 segments.\n\nAfter move, head (2,4), then segment1: old head (3,4), segment2: old index1 (4,4), segment3: old index2 (5,4), segment4: old index3 (6,4), segment5: old index4 (6,3), segment6: old index5 (5,3), segment7: old index6 (4,3), segment8: old index7 (3,3), segment9: old index8 (2,3)  // tail at (2,3)\n\nNow (2,3) is still occupied by tail.\n\nTurn 28: from (2,4), I can go D to (2,3) but occupied by tail? (2,3) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nGo U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n\nCannot go to (2,3).\n\nEven if I could, (2,3) to (4,1) is not direct.\n\nI cannot reach (4,1) by turn 28 if I go the up path first.\n\nTherefore, if I want to eat both foods, I should eat (4,1) first since it has shorter life, then (4,4) later.\n\nBut (4,4) has longer life, so I can eat it after.\n\nIn the down path, I eat (4,1) at turn 26.\n\nThen from there, I can go to eat (4,4).\n\nAfter eating (4,1) at turn 26, snake at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nDirection left, so U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (4,2), D invalid, L to (3,1), R invalid.\n\n(4,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall, obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) ok.\n\n(3,1) might be free.\n\nSay go U to (4,2).\n\nThen head to (4,2), no food, body moves, etc.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) but occupied, so need to go around.\n\nTo reach (4,4), from (4,2) go to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied, so cannot.\n\nGo to (3,2) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle.\n\n(3,2) might be free.\n\nIt will take turns.\n\nBut since (4,4) has life to turn 31, I have time.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) go U to (4,2) turn 27.\n\nThen from (4,2) go U to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nGo L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSo L to (3,2) if free.\n\n(3,2) not occupied.\n\nThen turn 28: at (3,2), go U to (3,3) but occupied, or other moves.\n\nComplicated.\n\nBut the point is, with the up path, I eat (4,4) quickly and safely, and I might not get (4,1), but (4,1) is only +1, and it's risky to get, while (4,4) is easier and safer.\n\nMoreover, in the down path, when I go to (6,1), I'm close to the wall, and if I make a wrong move, I could die.\n\nFor example, if after (6,1) I go to (5,1), then to (4,1), but if for some reason I can't, I'm stuck.\n\nWhereas the up path has more space.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: at some point, but not immediate.\n\nTherefore, for long-term survival, it's better to go up to the more open area and eat (4,4).\n\nI can ignore (4,1) since it's only one point and risky.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,4), I can explore other areas for more food.\n\nThe grid might have more food later, but currently only these two.\n\nBut I need to survive to find more.\n\nSo I think going U at turn 23 is better.\n\nThen, after that, I can plan the next moves.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output a sequence of actions.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns ahead, I should provide actions for a few turns.\n\nLet me outline a plan.\n\nTurn 23: move U to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 24: from (6,4) move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (4,4) eat food\n\nNow after that, at (4,4), I can go U to (4,5) or L to (3,4)\n\nTo avoid getting stuck, I should go to a direction with more space.\n\nFor example, go U to (4,5) to go up.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (4,5)\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (4,6), or L to (3,5), etc.\n\nSince I need to output actions, I can do for 5 turns: turn 23 to 27.\n\nBut turn 23 to 25 are fixed to eat food, then turn 26 and 27.\n\nAfter turn 25: head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nMove U to (4,5) at turn 26.\n\nThen new head (4,5), direction U (since up from left? Direction: from (4,4) to (4,5) is up, so direction U.\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nAll except D should be free, I assume.\n\nU, L, R.\n\nSay I go U to (4,6) to continue up.\n\nBut y=6, close to wall y=7.\n\nOr go to (3,5) to left.\n\nBut for now, I can choose.\n\nSince the answer might not need all, but I think for the sequence, I'll provide until turn 27 or so.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) might be eaten if I go, but as I thought, it's difficult.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to (4,4) and then not worry about (4,1).\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo decision: turn 23 move U.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 25: L (to (4,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 26: U (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 27: say U to (4,6) or something, but I need to specify.\n\nTo be safe, after (4,4), go to (4,5), then to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nBut since I have to think ahead, for turn 27, I can choose U.\n\nBut let's see if there is risk.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2) is not in the way.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: when I eat at (4,4), the tail is at (2,2), head at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, later positions.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think going up is better.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nThen for turn 26 and 27, I can add.\n\nBut the sequence might be part of the plan.\n\nSince the state changes, perhaps output only the necessary, but I think I should provide a sequence.\n\nLooking at the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list several.\n\nPerhaps for 5 actions: turn 23 to 27.\n\nTurn 27: from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), for example.\n\nBut (4,6) is close to wall, but ok.\n\nI could go L to (3,5) to explore left.\n\nBut for simplicity.\n\nI think U at turn 23 is the key decision.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- Avoid the risky bottom area near walls and the obstacle at (5,2), which could lead to traps or collisions.\n- Eat the positive food at (4,4) quickly, as it has a longer life span (9 turns) and is safer to reach from the current position.\n- Sacrifice the food at (4,1) if necessary, as it has a shorter life span (6 turns) and reaching it would require navigating a cramped area with higher collision risk.\n- After eating, move to open areas to maintain flexibility for future food and avoid dead ends.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 23)\n- **Snake head**: (6,3), direction right.\n- **Possible moves from (6,3)**:\n  - **U (up) to (6,4)**: Safe, no wall/body/obstacle. Leads toward (4,4) food.\n  - **D (down) to (6,2)**: Safe immediately but forces movement toward bottom wall (y=0), increasing risk. Path to (4,1) is inefficient and may not be reachable before it expires.\n  - **R (right) to (7,3)**: Invalid (wall at x=7).\n  - **L (left) to (5,3)**: Invalid (instant reverse from current right direction).\n- **Food prioritization**:\n  - (4,4) is reachable in 2 moves (eaten on turn 25) with minimal risk.\n  - (4,1) requires 3+ moves and navigating near walls/obstacle; may not be reachable by turn 28 (expiry) if (4,4) is eaten first. Eating it offers no significant gain over long-term survival risks.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Going down creates a dead end near y=0 and (5,2) obstacle.\n  - Tail reward danger is not immediate (tail at (3,1) not adjacent to head or food).\n\n### Plan for Turns 23-27 (5+ Turns Ahead)\n1. **Turn 23: Move U (up) to (6,4)**  \n   - Why: Moves toward (4,4) food and open area. Avoids down path risks. No food eaten; snake length unchanged. Food life spans decrease to 5 (for (4,1)) and 8 (for (4,4)).\n\n2. **Turn 24: Move L (left) to (5,4)**  \n   - Why: Continues path to (4,4). Safe, no immediate threats. No food eaten; life spans decrease to 4 and 7.\n\n3. **Turn 25: Move L (left) to (4,4)**  \n   - Why: Eats positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 9). Head direction now left. Life spans decrease to 3 and 6; (4,1) expires in 3 more turns.\n\n4. **Turn 26: Move U (up) to (4,5)**  \n   - Why: After eating, moves up to open space (away from body and walls). Avoids moving down (blocked by body at (4,3)) or right (opposite direction). No food; life spans decrease to 2 and 5.\n\n5. **Turn 27: Move U (up) to (4,6)**  \n   - Why: Continues upward to center of grid for better mobility. From (4,5), moving up is safe (no walls/body nearby). Prepares for future food spawns or exploration. No food; life spans decrease to 1 and 4 ( (4,1) expires after this turn).\n\n### Long-Term Outlook\n- By turn 27, the snake is at (4,6) with direction up, in a flexible position far from walls and body segments.\n- (4,1) expires after turn 27 (life span 0), so it is no longer a factor.\n- (4,4) was eaten, so only one food remains; new food may spawn.\n- Survival is prioritized: this path avoids the high-risk bottom area and maintains options for future turns (e.g., moving left/right from (4,6) to explore).\n- Score increased by +1 from (4,4), with potential for more as the snake survives longer.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one positive food safely while positioning for long-term survival and score maximization. If new food appears or state changes, re-evaluate from the new position.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: L \\\\\nTurn 25: L \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 24. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (6,4) from (6,3)? Let's list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (6,3)  // directly below head\n\n- Segment 2: (5,3)  // left of (6,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,3)  // left of (5,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,3)  // left of (4,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (2,3)  // left of (3,3)\n\n- Segment 6: (2,2)  // down from (2,3)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,2)  // right of (2,2), which is the tail\n\nTail is at (3,2). From (2,3) to (2,2) is down, then to (3,2) is right. So the snake is shaped like it went left, then down, then right a bit.\n\nHead direction is U, meaning it was moving up when it arrived at (6,4). Since it came from (6,3) to (6,4), that is up, so direction U makes sense.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (4,1), it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn, so it has 5 turns left including turn 24. Similarly, (4,4) has 8 turns left.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a 8x8 grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, let's define: let's say (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right. But in the positions, snake has (6,4), which might be near top if y=7 is top.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) might be playable? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free? Similarly y.\n\nBorder cells are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So interior cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is within 1-6.\n\nSo playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (5,2) blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail\n\n(3,2) is tail.\n\nFood at (4,1) and (4,4).\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is on the bottom row? y=1 is the bottom row since y=0 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is at x=4,y=4.\n\nNow, head at (6,4), direction U (up).\n\nPossible moves: since head is facing up, I can move U, L, R, but not D because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse means I cannot move in the opposite direction of current head direction on the next turn.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on this turn because that would be opposite to U.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo for turn t, I choose an action, but the direction I move cannot be opposite to the current head direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move D. I can move U, L, or R.\n\nNow, let's see the surroundings of head at (6,4):\n\n- Up: (6,5) - what is this? y=5, x=6. Is this within bounds? x=6 is within 1-6, y=5 is within 1-6. No wall or obstacle? (5,2) is obstacle, but (6,5) should be free.\n\n- Down: (6,3) - but this is the body segment, and also moving down is not allowed because opposite to current direction U. So D is invalid anyway.\n\n- Left: (5,4) - x=5,y=4. Should be free, no wall or obstacle mentioned.\n\n- Right: (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n\nx=7 is wall, so moving right from (6,4) to (7,4) is wall collision, death.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,4) with direction U:\n\n- U: to (6,5)\n\n- D: invalid, opposite direction and also occupied by body\n\n- L: to (5,4)\n\n- R: to (7,4) wall, invalid\n\nSo only U or L are possible without immediate death.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFood at (4,1) and (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is at x=4,y=4. From head (6,4), it's left two cells, same y.\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is down and left, but y=1 is bottom.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,2), and there might be food under body or something.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo occupied: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nFood at (4,1) and (4,4). Are these under snake? (4,4) is at x=4,y=4. Snake has (4,3) but not (4,4), so (4,4) is free. Similarly, (4,1) is free, not occupied by snake.\n\n(4,4) is empty now, food is there.\n\nBut food can be under body? In this case, neither food is under snake body; both are on empty cells.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), snake has (4,3) at (4,3), which is below it, but (4,4) is separate cell.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is separate.\n\nNow, life span: (4,1) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 24+5-1=28? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (4,1), life_span=5, on turn 24, it has 5 turns left including turn 24. So it will disappear after turn 28? Countdown: on turn 24, life_span=5; turn 25, 4; turn 26,3; turn 27,2; turn 28,1; so after turn 28, it disappears, meaning before turn 29 it is gone. Similarly for (4,4), life_span=8, disappears after turn 31.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns, but the answer should be for turn 24, then 25, etc., up to some point? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably I need to decide for the next few turns, but since it's a sequence, I might need to show the immediate actions.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 24.\n\nPerhaps I need to output a sequence of actions for the next few turns, but it might be variable.\n\nSince it's a game, I need to choose one action per turn, but for planning, I simulate.\n\nBut for answer, I think I need to provide the actions for turn 24, then 25, etc., as per the state.\n\nBut in the state, only turn 24 is given, so I need to decide for turn 24 first.\n\nBut to think ahead, I must consider future turns.\n\nLet me first consider the options for turn 24.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move U to (6,5):\n\n- New head position: (6,5)\n\n- Direction becomes U (since I moved up)\n\n- Snake body: tail end moves away? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail end is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, snake moves forward, so new positions: head to (6,5), then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (6,4) becomes new body, so new body starts from (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), etc., but the tail (3,2) is removed.\n\nSnake movement: when moving, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo after move U:\n\n- Head to (6,5)\n\n- Then body: segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n\nPositions: current: [ (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]\n\nAfter moving U, head to (6,5), then the first body segment moves to (6,4) (previous head), second body segment to (6,3) (previous first body), and so on, up to the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (2,3)? Let's index.\n\nLet S0 = head (6,4)\n\nS1 = (6,3)\n\nS2 = (5,3)\n\nS3 = (4,3)\n\nS4 = (3,3)\n\nS5 = (2,3)\n\nS6 = (2,2)\n\nS7 = tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move, new head at (6,5), then S1 new position: old S0 position (6,4)\n\nS2 new: old S1 position (6,3)\n\nS3 new: old S2 position (5,3)\n\nS4 new: old S3 position (4,3)\n\nS5 new: old S4 position (3,3)\n\nS6 new: old S5 position (2,3)\n\nS7 new: old S6 position (2,2)\n\nBut old S6 was (2,2), so S7 moves to (2,2), but that's the same position? No: the tail S7 was at (3,2), and it moves to where the previous segment was, which is S6's old position (2,2).\n\nSo new positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — and the old tail (3,2) is gone, so the new tail is at (2,2).\n\nOld tail was at (3,2), which is now empty.\n\nNew snake: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nLength still 8, no food eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (5,4):\n\nHead to (5,4), then body: S1 to (6,4), S2 to (6,3), S3 to (5,3), S4 to (4,3), S5 to (3,3), S6 to (2,3), S7 to (2,2)\n\nNew positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nNew tail at (2,2), old tail (3,2) gone.\n\nNow, food at (4,4) and (4,1). (4,4) is at (4,4), which is not occupied now.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), I am closer to (4,4).\n\n(5,4) to (4,4) is adjacent left.\n\nBut I need to see if I can eat it safely.\n\nFirst, let's think about the food at (4,4).\n\nIt has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nFood at (4,1) has life span 5, so it might disappear sooner.\n\nNow, head at (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), then from there, I can go to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (6,4), tail at (3,2), distance is |6-3| + |4-2| = 3+2=5, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so positions change.\n\nFirst, for turn 24, I need to choose between U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), I go up, away from both foods.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), I get closer to (4,4).\n\nNow, let's think long term.\n\nI should aim to eat the food, but prioritize survival.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space, and snake is long, 8 segments.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, minus (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSo 6x6=36 cells minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells. Snake occupies 8, so 27 free cells.\n\nBut with food, etc.\n\nNow, food at (4,1) is near the bottom, y=1.\n\nHead at (6,4), to reach (4,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut moving down from (6,4) is not possible now because direction U.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go L to (5,4), then from there, I can go down or left, etc.\n\nLet's simulate both options.\n\nFirst, option 1: move U to (6,5) on turn 24.\n\nNew head position: (6,5), direction U.\n\nSnake: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nFood: (4,1) and (4,4) still there.\n\nLife span: after turn 24, (4,1) has 4 turns left (since countdown decreases each turn, on turn 25 it will be 4).\n\nTurn 24: life_span=5, after turn, it decreases, so on turn 25, it has 4 left.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), on turn 25, 7 left.\n\nNow from (6,5), possible moves: direction U (since I moved up), so I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\n- U to (6,6): y=6, which is below y=7 wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is top row, not wall. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, similarly x.\n\nSo (6,6) is within bounds.\n\n- D to (6,4): but (6,4) is now occupied by body, and also D is opposite to current direction U, so invalid.\n\n- L to (5,5)\n\n- R to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,5), can go U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I go U to (6,6), I am at top row.\n\nThen from there, I can only go down or left/right, but right is wall, so down or left.\n\nBut I might get stuck.\n\nIf I go L to (5,5), then to (5,4) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I am moving away from the foods.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,1) are at y=4 and y=1.\n\nBy going up, I am not progressing towards food.\n\n(4,1) has only 4 turns left after this, so if I don't go down soon, I might miss it.\n\nTurn 24: (4,1) life=5, after turn 24, on turn 25, life=4.\n\nIf I don't eat by turn 28, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has more time.\n\nSo perhaps I should go for (4,1) first since it has shorter life.\n\nBut to reach (4,1) from (6,4), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (6,4), I cannot go down directly because of direction and body.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3) or left to (4,4), etc.\n\nLet's consider option 2: on turn 24, move L to (5,4).\n\nNew head: (5,4), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nSnake: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nFood at (4,4) is at (4,4), which is adjacent to (5,4)? (5,4) to (4,4) is left, adjacent.\n\nSo on next turn, I could move to (4,4) and eat the food.\n\nBut let's see turn 25.\n\nFirst, on turn 24, I moved to (5,4).\n\nNow turn 25, from (5,4), direction L, so I can move L, U, D, not R (opposite).\n\n- L to (4,4): which has food, so I can eat it.\n\n- U to (5,5)\n\n- D to (5,3)\n\n- R to (6,4): but (6,4) is occupied by body, and R is opposite to L, invalid.\n\nSo possible: L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), I eat the food at (4,4).\n\nValue +1, snake grows.\n\nWhen I eat, the head moves to (4,4), and since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the snake gains a segment.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,4), then the body: the previous segments remain, so new body includes all old positions plus the new head, tail stays.\n\nOld positions: before move, snake is at [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), head to (4,4), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the new body is: (5,4) becomes first body, then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail at (2,2) remains, but a new segment is added at head, so the tail is still (2,2), but the segment that was tail is now part of body.\n\nNew snake: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — so 9 segments, tail at (2,2).\n\nLength increased to 9.\n\nFood (4,4) is removed.\n\nNow, life span of (4,1) is decreasing.\n\nAfter turn 24, (4,1) had life=4 on turn 25? Let's keep track.\n\nTurn 24: (4,1) life=5, (4,4) life=8\n\nAfter turn 24 action, both decrease by 1, so on turn 25, (4,1) life=4, (4,4) life=7\n\nIf I eat (4,4) on turn 25, it is consumed.\n\n(4,1) still there with life=4.\n\nNow, head at (4,4), direction L (since I moved left to get there).\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: direction L, so can move L, U, D, not R.\n\n- L to (3,4): what is there? Snake has (4,3) below, but (3,4) should be free? Snake positions: (4,4) head, (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\n(3,4) is not occupied, and no wall, so free.\n\n- U to (4,5)\n\n- D to (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied by body, snake has (4,3) as a body segment.\n\n- R to (5,4): occupied by body, and R is opposite to L, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,4) or U to (4,5).\n\nD to (4,3) is occupied, invalid.\n\nNow, (4,1) is at (4,1), which is down from here, but I need to go down.\n\nBut from (4,4), I can go U or L.\n\nIf I go D, it's invalid and occupied.\n\nSo I cannot go down directly.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go left or up first, then down later.\n\nBut (4,1) has only 4 turns left after turn 24, so on turn 25, life=4, must be eaten by turn 28.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 25, if I go L to (3,4), then I am at (3,4).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\nOr left to (2,4), etc., not directly towards (4,1).\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), even worse.\n\nSo from (4,4), I cannot easily go down to (4,3) because it's occupied.\n\nThe body is at (4,3), so I have to wait for it to move.\n\nCurrently, the snake has a segment at (4,3), which is directly below (4,4).\n\nAs the snake moves, that segment will move away.\n\nFor example, if I move from (4,4) to (3,4) on turn 25, then the body moves: head to (3,4), then (5,4) moves to (4,4)? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter eating (4,4) on turn 25, snake is at [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nOn turn 25, if I move to (3,4), no food there, so snake moves: head to (3,4), then (5,4) moves to (4,4)? No.\n\nPositions: S0: (4,4), S1: (5,4), S2: (6,4), S3: (6,3), S4: (5,3), S5: (4,3), S6: (3,3), S7: (2,3), S8: (2,2)\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), head to (3,4), no food, so tail moves: S1 moves to S0 position (4,4), S2 to S1 position (5,4), S3 to S2 position (6,4), S4 to S3 position (6,3), S5 to S4 position (5,3), S6 to S5 position (4,3), S7 to S6 position (3,3), S8 to S7 position (2,3), and tail was S8 at (2,2), which moves to (2,3), but S7 was (2,3), so S8 moves to (2,3), and the old tail position (2,2) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail at (2,3).\n\n(4,3) is still occupied, but now by a different segment.\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so I still cannot move down to (4,3) from (4,4) if I were there, but I moved away.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,3) or (4,2), but (4,3) is occupied.\n\n(4,2) might be free, but there is obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2).\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nBut to get to (4,1), I need to be at (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1), but (5,1) might be near obstacle.\n\nBut from current, it's messy.\n\nPerhaps going to eat (4,4) first is not ideal because it blocks the path to (4,1).\n\nLet's go back to turn 24.\n\nInstead of going left to (5,4), I could go up to (6,5) on turn 24.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), I am cornered.\n\nBetter to go L to (5,5) on turn 25.\n\nTurn 24: move U to (6,5)\n\nSnake: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 25, from (6,5), move L to (5,5)\n\nNew head: (5,5), direction L.\n\nSnake: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail at (2,2)\n\nFood: (4,1) life=4 (on turn 25), (4,4) life=7\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (4,5) or (5,4) or (5,6), etc.\n\nDirection L, so can move L, U, D, not R.\n\n- L to (4,5)\n\n- U to (5,6)\n\n- D to (5,4)\n\n- R to (6,5): occupied, invalid\n\n(5,4) is free? Currently, snake has (6,4) but not (5,4), so (5,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) free.\n\n(5,6) free.\n\nI can go to (5,4) to get closer to (4,4) or to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,4) is at (4,4), from (5,5), if I go D to (5,4), then I am at (5,4), and (4,4) is adjacent.\n\nThen on turn 26, I can eat (4,4).\n\nBut let's see (4,1) life.\n\nOn turn 25, (4,1) life=4, so after turn 25, life=3, etc.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) on turn 25, then on turn 26 eat (4,4), but that uses turns, and (4,1) is not being approached.\n\nFrom (5,5), I could go L to (4,5), then from there down to (4,4) or something.\n\n(4,4) is at y=4, (4,5) is above.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go down.\n\nBut the body is at (4,3), blocking the way.\n\nI need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (4,3).\n\nCurrently, the body at (4,3) will move as the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the head around, the body will follow.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nLet's think about the food at (4,1).\n\nIt is at (4,1), and the tail is at (2,2), which is nearby.\n\nBut tail will move.\n\nTo eat (4,1), I need to have the head at (4,1) when it is free.\n\nBut (4,1) is free now, but head is at (6,4), far.\n\nShortest path: from (6,4) to (4,1), Manhattan distance |6-4| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5 cells, so at least 5 moves, but with body, it might be more.\n\nBut I have only 5 turns to eat it, including turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: I can make a move, then turn 25,26,27,28; on turn 28, if I eat before or on turn 28, it is there.\n\nLife span: on turn 24, life=5, so it exists on turns 24,25,26,27,28; after turn 28, it disappears, so must eat on or before turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 24, I can eat if I move to it, but I am not adjacent.\n\nFrom (6,4), not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nSo minimum, I need to move towards it.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut I cannot go down directly.\n\nSo I must go left first to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3) or left to (4,4), etc.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) on turn 24, then on turn 25, I can go down to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is occupied by body? Current body has (5,3), but after move.\n\nOn turn 24, move L to (5,4), snake: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\n(5,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 25, from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n\nCannot move there.\n\nU to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nL to (4,4) I can eat, as before.\n\nOr U to (5,5).\n\nBut not down.\n\nSo I cannot go directly down from (5,4) because (5,3) is occupied.\n\nThe only way down is to go left or right first, but right is not possible.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can go L to (4,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go to the left side.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), go L to (4,4) on turn 25, eat food, then as before, I am at (4,4) with body at (4,3) below, so I cannot go down.\n\nThen I have to go left or up.\n\nIf I go left to (3,4), as before.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied.\n\nOr to (2,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nNot down.\n\nEventually, as the snake moves, the body at (4,3) will move.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,4) on turn 25, snake at [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nOn turn 25, move to (3,4), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,4), then (5,4) to (4,4), (6,4) to (5,4), (6,3) to (6,4), (5,3) to (6,3), (4,3) to (5,3), (3,3) to (4,3), (2,3) to (3,3), (2,2) to (2,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nNew positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] tail at (2,3).\n\n(4,3) is still occupied, but by (4,3) in the list, which is now the 7th segment or something.\n\n(4,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 26, from (3,4), direction L (since moved left), so can move L, U, D, not R.\n\n- L to (2,4)\n\n- U to (3,5)\n\n- D to (3,3): occupied\n\n- R to (4,4): occupied, invalid\n\nSo can go L or U.\n\nIf I go L to (2,4), then I am at (2,4).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (2,3) or left to (1,4), etc.\n\n(2,3) is occupied by tail or body.\n\nIn new positions, (2,3) is occupied.\n\nSo similar problem.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go to (4,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\n(4,2) might be free.\n\nBut how to get there.\n\nPerhaps from the current position on turn 24, instead of going to (5,4), I should go up to (6,5) and then try to go around.\n\nBut that takes more turns, and (4,1) has short life.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum moves to reach (4,1) from (6,4).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (4,1): I need to decrease x by 2, decrease y by 3.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nPath: for example, (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) but (5,3) occupied, so not possible.\n\n(6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) but (4,3) occupied.\n\n(6,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) etc, not down.\n\nThe only way is to go to a cell like (4,2) or (5,1), but (5,1) is near obstacle.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so (5,1) is playable?

S2 was (5,5), moves to S1 position (4,5), etc.\n\nNew: head (3,4), then S1 to (4,4), S2 to (4,5), S3 to (5,5), S4 to (5,4), S5 to (6,4), S6 to (6,3), S7 to (5,3), S8 to (4,3), and tail was (3,3), moves to S8 position (4,3), so new tail at (4,3).\n\nPositions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,3) occupied, and (4,1) is at (4,1), I am at (3,4), not adjacent, and (4,1) disappears after this turn, so I cannot eat it.\n\nSo I missed (4,1) again.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to eat (4,1) with the current position and body blocking the way. I should abandon (4,1) and focus on (4,4) and long-term survival.\n\n(4,4) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nOn turn 24, I can go U to (6,5) to have more space, or L to (5,4) to eat (4,4) soon.\n\nBut eating (4,4) soon might not be bad, but after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but since there's space, it might be ok.\n\nPrioritize survival.\n\nLet's look at the tail position.\n\nTail is at (3,2), which is near the bottom left.\n\nHead at (6,4), top right.\n\nIf I go to (5,4), then eat (4,4), I am at (4,4), with body below.\n\nThen I can go left to (3,4), then down to (3,3) but occupied, or to (2,4), etc.\n\nI can go up to (4,5), then left, etc.\n\nBut to avoid getting stuck, I should move towards open areas.\n\nThe grid has obstacle at (5,2), so bottom right is partially blocked.\n\nPlayable area: x=1-6, y=1-6, (5,2) blocked.\n\nFree cells: all except snake and obstacle.\n\nSnake occupies 8 cells, obstacle 1, so 36-8-1=27 free, plus two food, but food are on free cells.\n\nAfter eating, length increases.\n\nFor long-term, I should eat (4,4) and then explore other areas.\n\nSince (4,1) is likely to expire, I can ignore it.\n\nOn turn 24, move L to (5,4) to get closer to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 25, move L to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4) or (4,5).\n\nTo have more space, I can go to (4,5) first.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to provide actions for turn 24 and possibly next turns.\n\nBut the state is turn 24, so I need to output for turn 24 first.\n\nPerhaps I can output a sequence.\n\nBut I think for now, for turn 24, I choose to move L to (5,4) to position for eating (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 25, eat it.\n\nThen on turn 26, move to (3,4) or (4,5).\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, I need to plan.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can simulate.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (3,2), and it will move as the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the tail moves, so cells become free.\n\nIn particular, (3,2) will be vacated soon if I move.\n\nOn turn 24, if I move L to (5,4), then snake moves, tail (3,2) moves to (2,2)? After move, new tail at (2,2), old (3,2) free.\n\nBut (3,2) is not food.\n\nFood at (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is still there.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (4,2) or something.\n\nBut I think it's too late for (4,1), so I should focus on (4,4).\n\nSo for turn 24, action: L to (5,4)\n\nThen for turn 25, action: L to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nThen for turn 26, from (4,4), direction L, so move to (3,4) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is above, or (3,4) left.\n\nTo go to open area, say (4,5).\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nI think for the answer, I can provide the first few actions.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps 3-5 turns.\n\nBut since the state changes, I can provide for turn 24 and 25.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body: but no food under body now.\n\nSo for turn 24, I think L is better.\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), then I can go to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (4,4) to eat later, but that might be safer.\n\nBut (4,4) has time, so no rush.\n\nBut by eating it, I get the score, and snake grows, which might be good for future, but also harder to move.\n\nSince both foods are positive, eating is good.\n\nBut (4,1) will expire, so I might as well eat (4,4) soon.\n\nSo I think move L on turn 24.\n\nThen on turn 25, move L to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 26, from (4,4), direction L, I can move U to (4,5) for example, to go up.\n\nOr L to (3,4).\n\nLet's say move U to (4,5) to explore top.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can write:\n\nTurn 24: L\n\nTurn 25: L  (to eat (4,4))\n\nThen for turn 26, it depends.\n\nBut since the state changes, I can stop there or plan more.\n\nTo think ahead, after eating, from (4,4) I go to (4,5) on turn 26.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,6) or (3,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think for turn 24, move L is the best to approach food.\n\nSo action for turn 24: L (left)\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 25 or 26.\n\nBut the format says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I need to specify how many.\n\nPerhaps I can output for the next few turns based on plan.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from current.\n\nI think I'll provide for turn 24 and 25.\n\nBut let's include turn 26.\n\nTurn 24: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (4,4) and eat food\n\nTurn 26: from (4,4), move U to (4,5) to avoid the body and go to open space.\n\nDirection after turn 25 is L, so from (4,4), moving U is allowed.\n\nThen on turn 26, move U to (4,5)\n\nNo food, snake moves accordingly.\n\nBut I think that's fine.\n\nTo maximize score, there might be more food later, but not given, so only these two for now.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned the next 5 turns (turns 24 to 28) by evaluating possible moves, food life spans, and collision risks. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Prioritization**: The positive food at (4,1) has a life span of 5 (disappears after turn 28), and the food at (4,4) has a life span of 8 (disappears after turn 31). Given the short life of (4,1), it should be prioritized, but the snake's position and body segments block direct paths. After simulating paths, it is determined that reaching (4,1) within 5 turns is impossible due to body obstructions and movement constraints. Therefore, focus shifts to eating (4,4) and ensuring long-term survival by navigating to open areas.\n  \n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake's head is at (6,4) with direction \"U\" (up). On turn 24, valid moves are U (up to (6,5)) or L (left to (5,4)), as D (down) is opposite to current direction and R (right) leads to a wall. Moving L to (5,4) positions the snake closer to (4,4) and avoids dead ends.\n\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The body segment at (5,3) blocks downward movement from (5,4), so eating (4,4) must be done carefully. After eating (4,4), the snake grows, so movements must avoid the body and walls. The internal obstacle at (5,2) is avoided by not moving downward near it.\n\n- **5-Turn Plan**: \n  - **Turn 24**: Move L to (5,4) to approach (4,4) and avoid the top-right corner, which could lead to trapping.\n  - **Turn 25**: Move L to (4,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 9).\n  - **Turn 26**: Move U to (4,5) to navigate away from the body and toward open space, as downward movement is blocked.\n  - **Turn 27**: Move U to (4,6) to continue upward, maximizing distance from the body and walls.\n  - **Turn 28**: Move L to (3,6) to explore the top-left area, avoiding potential dead ends and keeping future options open.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one positive food, avoids risks, and positions itself for future opportunities. After turn 28, the snake should continue exploring the grid for new food while avoiding collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: L (left)  \nTurn 25: L (left)  \nTurn 26: U (up)  \nTurn 27: U (up)  \nTurn 28: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 25, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2), which I must avoid.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,4), then body segments: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,1) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so by turn 28.\n\n- (4,4) with value 1 and life span 7. Disappears after 7 turns, so by turn 31.\n\n- (3,6) with value 1 and life span 10. Disappears after 10 turns, so by turn 34.\n\nAll food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Body: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nSo let's list all snake cells:\n\n- (5,4) head\n\n- (6,4) body\n\n- (6,3) body\n\n- (5,3) body\n\n- (4,3) body\n\n- (3,3) body\n\n- (2,3) body\n\n- (2,2) tail\n\nNow, head is at (5,4), direction left, so last move was left to (5,4) from, say, (6,4)? Positions show (5,4) then (6,4), so head moved to (5,4) from (6,4), direction left.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to get to current position.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (5,4):\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (5,5)\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) = (5,3)\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) = (4,4)\n\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) = (6,4)\n\nBut I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L (left), so opposite is right (R). So I cannot move right to (6,4).\n\nAlso, need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, (5,5): is this occupied? Snake positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). None at (5,5), so free? But need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: border walls, so (5,5) is within bounds, x=5 between 0 and 7, y=5 between 0 and 7. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (5,5). So (5,5) should be free.\n\n(5,3): this is a body segment. Snake has (5,3) as a body part. So if I move down to (5,3), that would be a collision, since head touches body.\n\n(4,4): not in snake positions, so might be free.\n\n(6,4): is occupied by body? Snake positions: (6,4) is the second segment, so it's a body part. But when I move, the tail moves, so let's think carefully.\n\nGeneral rule: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail moves away from current position.\n\nSo, if I move to a cell, it's deadly if it's occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok, because after move, tail leaves that cell.\n\nBut if head moves to a cell occupied by non-tail body, it collides.\n\nAlso, walls are deadly.\n\nIn this case, possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,5) - not occupied, not wall, so safe?\n\n- D: (5,3) - occupied by body at (5,3), which is not tail. Tail is at (2,2). (5,3) is a middle segment. So moving to (5,3) would cause collision.\n\n- L: (4,4) - not in snake positions? Snake has (4,3) but not (4,4). So (4,4) should be free.\n\n- R: (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied by the first body segment. Also, moving right is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, or D? But D is to (5,3) which is body.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- U: (5,5) - not occupied, not wall\n\n- D: (5,3) - occupied by body, so deadly\n\n- L: (4,4) - not occupied\n\n- R: (6,4) - occupied and opposite direction, not allowed\n\nSo only U and L are possible moves from here without immediate death.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (4,1) at (4,1), value 1, life 4\n\n- (4,4) at (4,4), value 1, life 7\n\n- (3,6) at (3,6), value 1, life 10\n\n(4,4) is a food location. If I move left to (4,4), I would eat that food, since head moves there.\n\nBut let's see what happens.\n\nFirst, I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there's a note about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,2), head is at (5,4), not adjacent. Adjacent would be one move away, like (2,2) to (3,2) or (2,3) etc. Head is at (5,4), tail at (2,2), not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nNow, for move to (4,4): that's where food is, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to length 9, and the food disappears.\n\nBut I need to see the life span: food at (4,4) has life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns including this one, so if I don't eat it now, it might be gone later, but since life span is 7, from turn 25, it will be there until turn 31? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 25, life span 7 means it has 7 turns left, including turn 25. So after turn 25, it has 6 left, ..., after turn 31, it has 0, so it disappears before turn 32? Let's see.\n\nTurn t, life span L: it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t+L, it's gone? Or at the start of turn t+L?\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nTypically, food is present as long as countdown > 0.\n\nSo for food at (4,4), life span 7 at turn 25: it will be present on turns 25,26,27,28,29,30,31. After turn 31, countdown is 0, so gone on turn 32.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1): life span 4 at turn 25, present on 25,26,27,28, gone on 29.\n\n(3,6): life span 10, present on 25 to 34, gone on 35.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), I eat the food there immediately, snake grows to length 9.\n\nThen the new tail will be... after eating, the tail doesn't move? When snake eats, it grows, so when head moves to food, the body follows, but tail stays in place, so new segment added.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. New position: head at new cell, body segments follow, but since it grows, the last segment (tail) remains, so tail position doesn't change.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,4), which has food, head moves to (4,4), then the body: previous head (5,4) becomes body, then (6,4) to (5,4)? Let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,4), then body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nAfter move left to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Then the body: first segment moves to previous head position (5,4)\n\n- Second segment moves to previous first body position (6,4)? No.\n\nSequence: when snake moves, head goes to new cell. Each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo, if head moves to new cell, say C.\n\nThen segment 1 (first body) moves to where head was.\n\nSegment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n\n...\n\nTail moves to where the second last segment was.\n\nBut if food is eaten, the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, since (4,4) has food, after moving:\n\n- Head at (4,4)\n\n- New body segment at previous head position (5,4)\n\n- Then (6,4) moves to (6,4)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move left to (4,4) and eat food:\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 1 (new) at (5,4)  // previous head\n\n- Segment 2 at (6,4)  // where segment 1 was\n\n- But segment 1 was at (6,4), which is now occupied by segment 2 moving there? I think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think: the positions shift.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Then, since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the new body includes all previous positions plus the head position is new.\n\nAfter eating, the snake length increases by one. So the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at the head movement.\n\nStandard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail leaves its position.\n\nWhen eat, head moves to new cell (food), body segments follow, but tail stays, so new segment at old tail position? No.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nTypically: when snake moves to a cell without food, head to new, body follows, tail leaves.\n\nWhen snake moves to food, head to food, body follows, but tail does not leave, so snake grows by one, with the tail remaining and a new segment added at the head.\n\nIn terms of positions: after eating, the new positions are: new head at food cell, then the entire previous snake body.\n\nFor example, previous snake: positions S0, S1, S2, ..., Stail\n\nAfter moving to food cell F:\n\nNew snake: head at F, then S0, S1, S2, ..., Stail. So length increases by one, with head at F and the rest as before including tail.\n\nIn this case: previous: S0=(5,4), S1=(6,4), S2=(6,3), S3=(5,3), S4=(4,3), S5=(3,3), S6=(2,3), S7=(2,2)\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) with eat:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen S0 becomes body: (5,4)\n\nS1: (6,4)\n\nS2: (6,3)\n\nS3: (5,3)\n\nS4: (4,3)\n\nS5: (3,3)\n\nS6: (2,3)\n\nS7: (2,2) still tail\n\nSo new positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nLength 9.\n\nTail is at (2,2), same as before.\n\nIf no eat, tail would move to (2,3) or something, but here tail stays.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,3) in body, it remains.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I move to (4,4), I eat food, grow to 9.\n\nIf I move to (5,5), no food there, so no eat, snake moves: head to (5,5), then body to (5,4), (6,4) to (6,4)? Positions:\n\nAfter move U to (5,5) no food:\n\nNew head: (5,5)\n\nThen S0 to (5,4)  // body\n\nS1 to (6,4)  // but S1 was at (6,4), now moves to where? S1 moves to position of S0, which was (5,4), but (5,4) is now occupied by new body.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body1: previous head (5,4)\n\n- Body2: previous body1 (6,4)\n\n- Body3: previous body2 (6,3)\n\n- Body4: previous body3 (5,3)\n\n- Body5: previous body4 (4,3)\n\n- Body6: previous body5 (3,3)\n\n- Body7: previous body6 (2,3)\n\n- Tail: previous body7 (2,2) moves to where body6 was, which is (2,3)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious: idx0: (5,4) head, idx1: (6,4), idx2: (6,3), idx3: (5,3), idx4: (4,3), idx5: (3,3), idx6: (2,3), idx7: (2,2) tail\n\nAfter move U to (5,5) no food:\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- New body1: idx0 position, (5,4)\n\n- New body2: idx1 position, (6,4)\n\n- New body3: idx2 position, (6,3)\n\n- New body4: idx3 position, (5,3)\n\n- New body5: idx4 position, (4,3)\n\n- New body6: idx5 position, (3,3)\n\n- New body7: idx6 position, (2,3)\n\n- Tail: since no grow, tail moves to where idx7 was? No, idx7 was tail, but in movement, the tail segment moves to the position of the previous segment before it, which is idx6.\n\nStandard: the segment that was idx7 (tail) is not included; instead, the new tail is the position that was idx6, but since no grow, the tail moves off.\n\nNew positions: head to new, then each subsequent segment to previous position of the segment one before it.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- New position 0: (5,5)\n\n- New position 1: old position 0 = (5,4)\n\n- New position 2: old position 1 = (6,4)\n\n- New position 3: old position 2 = (6,3)\n\n- New position 4: old position 3 = (5,3)\n\n- New position 5: old position 4 = (4,3)\n\n- New position 6: old position 5 = (3,3)\n\n- New position 7: old position 6 = (2,3)\n\nOld position 7 (2,2) is left, so tail is at (2,3), and (2,2) is empty now.\n\nLength remains 8.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut for now, at turn 25, I need to choose action for turn 25.\n\nOptions: U or L.\n\nL to (4,4) eats food immediately.\n\nU to (5,5) no food.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,1) which is below, with short life span 4, so it will be gone soon.\n\nAnd (3,6) far away with long life.\n\nBut (4,4) is right there.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) now, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but also, I get the point.\n\nBut prioritize survival.\n\nNow, let's see the board.\n\nGrid: let's sketch y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (5,2)\n\nSnake: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nSo snake is mostly on row 3 and 4, column 2 to 6.\n\nFood at (4,1) - that's row 1, column 4, near bottom but y=1, since y=0 is wall.\n\ny=0 is bottom wall, so (4,1) is one above bottom.\n\n(4,4) is at column 4, row 4.\n\n(3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nNow, from head (5,4), if I move L to (4,4), I eat food, and head is at (4,4).\n\nThen, from there, possible moves.\n\nBut after eating, snake is longer, so more body to avoid.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), head at (5,5), then I can consider going to other food.\n\nBut (4,1) has only 4 turns left, so I need to get there soon if I want to eat it.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 25, so it will be gone after turn 28, meaning I have until turn 28 to eat it, so turns 25,26,27,28 I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, others have more time.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which is below.\n\nLet's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (4,4) now.\n\nTurn 25: move L to (4,4), eat food, score +1, snake grows to 9 segments.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nHead direction now would be L, since moved left.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves:\n\nU: (4,5)\n\nD: (4,3) - but (4,3) is body segment, not tail. Tail is at (2,2), so (4,3) is occupied, so deadly to move there.\n\nL: (3,4)\n\nR: (5,4) - but (5,4) is body segment, occupied.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite? Current direction is L, so opposite is R, which is not allowed anyway since (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,5) or L to (3,4)\n\n(4,5) and (3,4) are not occupied, I think.\n\nCurrent snake: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nSo (4,5) not in list, (3,4) not in list.\n\nWalls: (4,5) is within bounds, (3,4) within.\n\nObstacle at (5,2), not relevant.\n\nSo from (4,4), can move U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (4,5), no food there.\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body to (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) and tail at (2,2)? After move, since no eat, tail moves.\n\nAfter move U from (4,4) no food at (4,5):\n\n- Head to (4,5)\n\n- Body1 to (4,4)\n\n- Body2 to (5,4)\n\n- Body3 to (6,4)\n\n- Body4 to (6,3)\n\n- Body5 to (5,3)\n\n- Body6 to (4,3)\n\n- Body7 to (3,3)\n\n- Tail to (2,3)  // old body6, since body7 was (2,3) but now it moves to where body6 was? Old positions: after turn 25, snake is at positions: let's list indices for turn 25 after eat.\n\nAt turn 25 after move L to (4,4) with eat:\n\nSnake positions for turn 25: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n\nFor turn 26, if I move U to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)  // U from (4,4)\n\n- Since no food, snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Body1: old head (4,4)\n\n- Body2: old body1 (5,4)\n\n- Body3: old body2 (6,4)\n\n- Body4: old body3 (6,3)\n\n- Body5: old body4 (5,3)\n\n- Body6: old body5 (4,3)\n\n- Body7: old body6 (3,3)\n\n- Tail: old body7 (2,3)  // and (2,2) is empty\n\nOld tail was (2,2), but since no grow, it is not included; new tail is at (2,3), which was body7.\n\nLength 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,4) from (4,4), with or without food, but (3,4) has no food, so similar.\n\nBut (3,4) is empty.\n\nNow, back to turn 25 choice.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) instead of L.\n\nTurn 25: move U to (5,5), no food.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,5), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail at (2,3)? After move U no eat:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body1: old head (5,4)\n\n- Body2: old body1 (6,4)\n\n- Body3: old body2 (6,3)\n\n- Body4: old body3 (5,3)\n\n- Body5: old body4 (4,3)\n\n- Body6: old body5 (3,3)\n\n- Body7: old body6 (2,3)\n\n- Tail: old body7 (2,2) moves to where? Old body7 was (2,3), but new body7 is at old body6 position (2,3), and tail at old body7 position (2,2)? No.\n\nOld positions turn 25 initial: before move, head at (5,4), etc.\n\nAfter move U to (5,5) no eat:\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- New body1: old head (5,4)\n\n- New body2: old body1 (6,4)\n\n- New body3: old body2 (6,3)\n\n- New body4: old body3 (5,3)\n\n- New body5: old body4 (4,3)\n\n- New body6: old body5 (3,3)\n\n- New body7: old body6 (2,3)\n\n- New tail: old body7 (2,2)  // since no grow, tail is at old tail position? No.\n\nThe tail segment moves to the position of the previous second last segment.\n\nOld snake: positions P0=(5,4), P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(5,3), P4=(4,3), P5=(3,3), P6=(2,3), P7=(2,2)\n\nAfter move, new head at (5,5)\n\nThen new position 1: P0 = (5,4)\n\nNew position 2: P1 = (6,4)\n\nNew position 3: P2 = (6,3)\n\nNew position 4: P3 = (5,3)\n\nNew position 5: P4 = (4,3)\n\nNew position 6: P5 = (3,3)\n\nNew position 7: P6 = (2,3)\n\nAnd P7 (2,2) is left, so tail is at (2,3), and (2,2) empty.\n\nPositions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] length 8.\n\nNow head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so cannot move D.\n\nAlso, check cells:\n\nU: (5,6) - within bounds, not occupied? Snake has (5,5), (5,4), etc, no (5,6), so free.\n\nD: (5,4) - but (5,4) is body segment, occupied, and also opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nL: (4,5) - not occupied, free.\n\nR: (6,5) - not occupied, free? Walls, x=6 is not wall, x=7 is, so (6,5) is ok. Obstacle at (5,2), not.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, I need to plan to get food, especially (4,1) which is time-sensitive.\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, y=1.\n\nHead at (5,5), so I need to go down.\n\nBut from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or R to (6,5), or U to (5,6).\n\nU to (5,6) is away from (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is at (4,1), so moving left to (4,5) then down might be way.\n\nBut there is body at (4,3), etc.\n\nLet's think about the area.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2) blocks the path at row 2, column 5.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to go to row 1, column 4.\n\nCurrently, the snake has segments at (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), so row 3 is partially blocked.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move L to (4,5), then from there I can move down.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, for turn 25, I have to choose.\n\nIf I eat the food at (4,4) now, I grow, which might make it harder to reach (4,1) because the snake is longer and there might be less space.\n\nIf I don't eat, I can try to go down to (4,1).\n\nBut from (5,4), moving U to (5,5) doesn't directly help, but it gets me to (5,5), from where I can go left or down.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving L to (4,4) eats food, but then from (4,4), I can only move U or L, both not down, so I can't go directly to (4,1) from there immediately.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move U to (4,5), I'm at (4,5), then I can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to go down, I need to move down from somewhere.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is occupied, so I can't move down.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5), moving down to (4,4) is body, so I can't move down from there either.\n\nSo if I eat the food at (4,4), I might be stuck in the upper area for a while, and miss the food at (4,1) which has short life.\n\nWhereas if I don't eat at (4,4), I can go from (5,4) to (5,5) or something, then down.\n\nBut from (5,4), moving U to (5,5) is one option.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can move down? (4,4) might be free if I didn't eat, but in this case, if I didn't move to (4,4), (4,4) has food, so it's occupied by food, not body.\n\nIn the state, food positions are separate, so cells with food are not occupied by snake, but if head moves there, it eats.\n\nSo from (5,4), if I move U to (5,5), then (4,4) still has food.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), for example.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), which has food, so I eat it then.\n\nBut that would be on turn 26 or later.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (4,1), I need to go to lower rows.\n\nAnother idea: from current position (5,4), if I move L to (4,4), I eat and grow, then I'm at (4,4), and I can only move U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (4,5), then I can move, say, L to (3,5) or U to (4,6), etc, but not down.\n\nThe only way down is to go left or right and then down from another column.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) after eating, if I move L to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body segment.\n\nAt turn 25 after eating at (4,4), snake positions include (3,3), which is body.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving D to (3,3) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (2,4) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut to go to row 1, I need to find a path.\n\nThe body is at rows 3 and 4, columns 2-6, so to go down to row 1, I need to go to a column where row 2 and 1 are clear.\n\nFor example, column 4 has (4,3) and (4,4) occupied after eating, so I can't go down column 4.\n\nColumn 3 has (3,3) occupied, so can't go down there.\n\nColumn 5 has (5,3) occupied, etc.\n\nSo after eating at (4,4), the snake blocks the direct path down, so it might be difficult to reach (4,1) quickly.\n\nIf I don't eat at (4,4), I can go to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (4,4) to eat later, or directly down from other points.\n\nLet's plan a path to (4,1).\n\nFrom current head (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) to eat food there, or move to other directions.\n\nFrom (4,5), to reach (4,1), I need to go down, but (4,4) has food, so if I move D to (4,4), I eat it, but then I'm at (4,4), and (4,3) is body, so I can't move down further.\n\nIf I don't move to (4,4), I can move from (4,5) to (3,5), for example, then to (3,4), etc, but (3,3) is body, so I can't go down column 3.\n\nSimilarly, column 5 has (5,3) body.\n\nThe only columns where row 3 is free are, for example, column 1,2,6,7 but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so not.\n\nRow 3: snake has (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), so columns 2,3,4 have body at row 3.\n\nColumns 1,5,6,7 at row 3: (1,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3)\n\n(6,3) is body, (5,3) body, (7,3) is x=7, which is wall, since x=7 is border wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is x=1, y=3, which is not wall, since walls are only borders and (5,2), so (1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is occupied, (6,3) occupied, (7,3) wall.\n\nSo at row 3, only (1,3) is free, and (0,3) wall.\n\nRow 2: snake has (2,2) tail, and (2,3) body, but (2,2) is at row 2, column 2.\n\nAlso obstacle at (5,2).\n\nRow 2: possible cells, but y=2.\n\nCells: (0,2) wall, (1,2), (2,2) snake, (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) obstacle, (6,2), (7,2) wall.\n\nSo free: (1,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2)\n\nSimilarly row 1: (0,1) wall, (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) food, (5,1), (6,1), (7,1) wall.\n\nFree except food at (4,1).\n\nTo reach (4,1), I need to approach from above or sides.\n\nSince row 3 is blocked in columns 2,3,4, I need to go to column 1 or 5 or 6, then down to row 2, then to (4,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), but (3,4) is free? Snake at (3,3) but not (3,4), so (3,4) free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3)? But (3,3) is body, occupied, can't.\n\nMove L to (2,4) or U to (3,5) etc, but not down.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move L to (2,4), then from (2,4), I can move D to (2,3), but (2,3) is body, occupied.\n\nMove to (2,5) or something.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps go to column 1.\n\nFor example, from current position, if I move U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), then D to (2,3)? But (2,3) is body, occupied.\n\nAt turn 25, after move U to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3)? Positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is the last, so it's body, but when I move, it might change.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move D to (2,4), then from (2,4), move D to (2,3) is occupied, so not possible.\n\nMove to (1,5) or something.\n\nLet's give up on that and think about the food life span.\n\nFood at (4,1) has life span 4 at turn 25, so it will be there for turns 25,26,27,28. I must eat it by turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has life 7, so until turn 31.\n\n(3,6) has life 10, until turn 34.\n\nSo (4,1) is urgent.\n\nTo eat (4,1), I need to have the head at (4,1) by turn 28.\n\nFrom current position (5,4), the shortest path to (4,1) is down and left, but directly down is blocked.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,1): the cells are (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) but (4,4) has food, so not blocked, but (4,3) is body.\n\nSo I can move to (4,4) first, but if I do, I eat food, then I'm at (4,4), and (4,3) is body, so I can't go down.\n\nI can move to (5,3) but it's body, deadly.\n\nOr move right, but not allowed.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), then I can go to (5,4) but occupied, or (4,5), then from (4,5) to (4,4) to eat, or to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut from (4,4) after eating, I can't go down.\n\nThe only way to (4,1) is to go around, for example, to column 3 or 5, down to row 2, then to (4,1).\n\nFor instance, from (5,4), move U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then D to (2,3)? Occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move D to (3,3) no, occupied.\n\nMove to (3,6) but that's food, far.\n\nAnother path: from (5,4), move U to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then D to (6,4) but occupied, or D to (6,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) occupied, or to (6,3) occupied, or L to (5,5) occupied, or R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, not allowed.\n\nSo from (6,5), only U or D, but D to (6,4) occupied, U to (6,6), etc.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps from (5,5) move L to (4,5), then from (4,5) move U to (4,6), then L to (3,6) to eat the food there, but (3,6) is food, but not (4,1).\n\nI need to get to (4,1).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,1): |5-4| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 cells away.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, one path: (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (4,6) to (3,6) but that's to (3,6), not to (4,1).\n\nTo (4,1): from (5,4) to (6,4) but occupied or not allowed.\n\nSince I can't go down directly, I need to go left or right.\n\nFor example, to (4,4) then to (3,4) then to (3,3) occupied, not possible.\n\nTo (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo the only way is to go to a different column.\n\nFor example, to (4,5) then to (3,5) then to (3,4) then to (3,3) occupied, dead end.\n\nTo (3,5) to (2,5) then to (2,4) then to (2,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,3) is occupied, but if I wait, the tail might move.\n\nAt turn 25, tail is at (2,2), and when I move, the tail moves.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the tail moves away from (2,3), then (2,3) might become free.\n\nBut (2,3) is body, not tail.\n\nTail is at (2,2).\n\nAfter moves, the tail position changes.\n\nFor instance, if at turn 25 I move U to (5,5), then positions become head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) and tail gone? Positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) so (2,3) is now the tail.\n\nPreviously (2,2) was tail, but after move, tail moved to (2,3), so (2,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is now tail.\n\nSo at turn 25 after move U, tail is at (2,3).\n\nThen at turn 26, if I move, tail will move from (2,3) to where the previous segment was, etc.\n\nBut for (2,3), it is now tail, so if head moves there, it's ok, because tail will move away.\n\nBut in this case, head is at (5,5), far.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I can go to (3,1) or (5,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) is free, no wall, no snake.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (4,1) to eat.\n\nSo I need to reach (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1), then to (4,1).\n\n(5,1) is free, (3,1) free, (4,2) free.\n\nFor example, from current (5,4), if I can go to (5,3) but occupied, or to (4,4) then to (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo let's plan a path.\n\nSuppose at turn 25, I move U to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 26, from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 27, from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) to eat food there, since (4,4) has food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), snake grows to 9, positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail at (2,3)? Let's not worry about tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), after eating, I can move U to (4,5) but (4,5) is now body? After move to (4,4) with eat, positions include (4,5) if it was body, but in turn 26, before move to (4,4), positions are from turn 25 move U.\n\nAt turn 25 after move U: positions (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nAt turn 26, if I move from (5,5) to (4,5), no food at (4,5), so no eat.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) and tail at (2,3)? After move, tail moves: new head (4,5), body1 (5,5), body2 (5,4), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,3), body5 (5,3), body6 (4,3), body7 (3,3), tail (2,3) but old tail was at (2,3), new tail at old body7 position, which is (3,3)? Old positions: P0=(5,5), P1=(5,4), P2=(6,4), P3= (6,3), P4=(5,3), P5=(4,3), P6=(3,3), P7=(2,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body1: old P0 (5,5)\n\nNew body2: old P1 (5,4)\n\nNew body3: old P2 (6,4)\n\nNew body4: old P3 (6,3)\n\nNew body5: old P4 (5,3)\n\nNew body6: old P5 (4,3)\n\nNew body7: old P6 (3,3)\n\nNew tail: old P7 (2,3)  // and (2,3) is now tail\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] and tail at (2,3)? New tail at old P7 (2,3), so positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and (2,3) is tail, so all positions include (2,3).\n\nList: head (4,5), body1 (5,5), body2 (5,4), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,3), body5 (5,3), body6 (4,3), body7 (3,3), tail (2,3)\n\nLength 9? No, 9 positions: indices 0 to 8.\n\n0: (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nAt turn 27, from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nThen new head at (4,4), and since eat, snake grows, so positions: head (4,4), then body at old positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo new snake: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) length 10.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction D (down).\n\nFrom here, to go to (4,1), I need to move down, but (4,3) is body, occupied, so I can't move D to (4,3).\n\nCan move U to (4,5) occupied, or L to (3,4) or R to (5,4) occupied.\n\n(3,4) might be free.\n\n(3,4) not in positions, so free.\n\nSo can move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4) but occupied, so only L to (3,4).\n\nThen from there, same problem.\n\nBut I need to get to (4,1) within 2 turns (turns 27,28), but at turn 27 I'm at (4,4), and (4,1) is 3 cells away, but blocked, so impossible to reach by turn 28.\n\nTurn 28 is the last turn to eat (4,1).\n\nAt turn 27, if I'm at (4,4), I can move to (3,4), then at turn 28, from (3,4), I can move to (3,3) but occupied, or (3,5), or (2,4), or (4,4) occupied, not to (4,1).\n\nSo I cannot reach (4,1) from here in time.\n\nIf at turn 25 I don't move to (4,4) immediately, but go another way.\n\nSuppose at turn 25, I move U to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 26, from (5,5), I can move D? Not allowed, direction U, so cannot D.\n\nCan move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nTo reach (4,1), I should move L to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 27, from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) to eat, or move L to (3,5), or U to (4,6), etc.\n\nIf I move D to (4,4) to eat, same as above, then at turn 27 I'm at (4,4), cannot reach (4,1) by turn 28.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), then at turn 28, from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4), then at turn 29, but turn 28 is last for (4,1), so on turn 28, I need to be at (4,1) to eat it.\n\nAt turn 28, if I'm at (3,5), I can move to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), not to (4,1).\n\nDistance is too far.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 27, I can move directly towards (4,1), but I can't move down because (4,4) is there, but I can move to (4,4) and eat, but then stuck.\n\nPerhaps don't eat (4,4) yet.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 27, move L to (3,5), then from (3,5) at turn 28, move D to (3,4), then at turn 29 move to (3,3) but occupied, not possible.\n\nMove to (2,5) etc.\n\nNo way to reach (4,1) by turn 28 from here.\n\nSo perhaps it's impossible to eat (4,1) because of the snake body blocking the path, and the short time.\n\nLet's check if there is a path from current position to (4,1) in 4 turns or less.\n\nTurn 25: from (5,4), move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf move L to (4,4), eat, then at (4,4), turn 26 move U to (4,5), turn 27 move U to (4,6) or L to (3,5), etc, all away from (4,1).\n\nIf move U to (5,5), turn 25.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\nTurn 27: from (4,5), move L to (3,5).\n\nTurn 28: from (3,5), move D to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is not (4,1), and I can't reach (4,1) in one move.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 27, if I could move D to (4,4) but that's eating, or to (4,3) but occupied.\n\nNo, (4,3) is occupied.\n\nSo it seems I cannot reach (4,1) by turn 28.\n\nTherefore, I should give up on eating (4,1) and focus on other food and survival.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has longer life, and (3,6) has even longer.\n\nSo for turn 25, I can choose to eat (4,4) now by moving L, or move U to (5,5) and eat later or go to (3,6).\n\nBut if I move U to (5,5), I can later go to (3,6) which has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's see the board after eating (4,4).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) at turn 25, eat food, head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen at turn 26, from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nSay I move U to (4,5), no food.\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), tail at (2,2)? After move U no eat from (4,4):\n\nPrevious positions turn 25: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nAfter move U to (4,5) no eat:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body1: old head (4,4)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (5,4)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (6,4)\n\nNew body4: old body3 (6,3)\n\nNew body5: old body4 (5,3)\n\nNew body6: old body5 (4,3)\n\nNew body7: old body6 (3,3)\n\nNew body8: old body7 (2,3)\n\nNew tail: old body8 (2,2)  // old tail\n\nPositions: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail at (2,2)? New tail at old body8 position, which is (2,3), so positions include (2,3), and (2,2) empty.\n\nList: head (4,5), body1 (4,4), body2 (5,4), body3 (6,4), body4 (6,3), body5 (5,3), body6 (4,3), body7 (3,3), body8 (2,3), tail at (2,3)? No, new tail is at old body8 position, which is (2,3), so it's body8 or tail? In the list, the last segment is tail.\n\nPositions: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) and the tail is at (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied, and the previous (2,2) is empty.\n\nFor simplicity, the tail is at (2,3).\n\nAt turn 26, head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nFrom here, I can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nCannot move D, occupied and opposite? Current direction U, so opposite D not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) may be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) free.\n\nNow, food at (3,6) is at (3,6), which is close.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), then from (3,5) move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nSo I can get to (3,6) in two turns.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 27: move U to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen I have eaten two food: (4,4) and (3,6).\n\nAnd (4,1) will disappear, but I can't reach it anyway.\n\nIf at turn 25 I move U to (5,5), then I can also go to (3,6) later.\n\nBut let's compare.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) at turn 25, then I can eat (3,6) at turn 27.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 25, move U to (5,5), then at turn 26 move L to (4,5), then at turn 27 move L to (3,5), then at turn 28 move U to (3,6) eat.\n\nSo same turn 28 to eat (3,6), but I missed eating (4,4) earlier.\n\nAt turn 26, from (4,5), if I move U to (4,6) or something, but I can eat (4,4) from (4,5) by moving down, but at turn 26, from (4,5), if I move D to (4,4), but (4,4) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nIn the case where I didn't eat at turn 25, at turn 26 from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 26 I eat (4,4), then at turn 27 from (4,4), I can move to (3,4) or (4,5) etc, then to (3,6).\n\nBut similar.\n\nBut in terms of score, eating earlier is fine.\n\nBut for survival, growing longer might increase risk.\n\nBut in this case, the grid has space.\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (5,2) might be an issue.\n\nBut let's decide for turn 25.\n\nSince I can't eat (4,1), I should eat the available food.\n\nAt turn 25, moving L to (4,4) allows me to eat immediately and then I can head towards (3,6).\n\nMoving U to (5,5) lets me eat (4,4) later or go directly to (3,6).\n\nBut eating (4,4) at turn 25 is efficient.\n\nMoreover, after eating at (4,4), I can go up to (3,6).\n\nSo I think moving L at turn 25 is good.\n\nThen for the next turns.\n\nLet's outline the moves.\n\nTurn 25: move L to (4,4), eat food, head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 26: from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nTo go to (3,6), better to move U to (4,5) first.\n\nMove U to (4,5), no food, head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 27: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), no food, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,5), move U to (3,6), eat food, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen I have eaten two food.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but the state only has three food, and one is expiring soon.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive and find other food, but no other food mentioned, so perhaps only these three.\n\nThe food positions are given, so only these for now.\n\nBut new food might spawn, but the problem doesn't say, so I think for this, I need to work with given food.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can explore or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=25.\n\nSo for turn 25: action\n\nTurn 26: action\n\n...\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but at least for the immediate turns.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, I can plan the next few turns.\n\nAlso, for survival, after eating (3,6), the snake is long, 10 segments, on an 8x8 grid with walls, so space is tight.\n\nGrid has 64 cells, walls and obstacles, so free cells less.\n\nBut walls are borders, so playable area 6x6=36 cells, minus obstacle at (5,2), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length after eating two food: initial 8, eat one to 9, eat another to 10, so 10 segments, so 25 free cells left, but with food possibly spawning, but not specified.\n\nFor now, after turn 28, I can move around carefully.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's define.\n\nSo turn 25: move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 26: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 27: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 28: move U to (3,6)\n\nThen at turn 29, from (3,6), head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, not allowed.\n\nD to (3,5) but (3,5) is body? After turn 28, positions need to be calculated.\n\nBut I don't need to go further, but I should think.\n\nFrom (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) or D to (3,5), but D might be occupied or not.\n\nSince I moved U to (3,6), direction U, so cannot move D opposite.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or since U not possible, only L or R.\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) should be free.\n\nSay move R to (4,6), then continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I can stop after a few moves.\n\nSince the food at (4,1) is not reachable, I should ignore it.\n\nAnother option: at turn 25, move U to (5,5), then turn 26 move L to (4,5), turn 27 move D to (4,4) eat, turn 28 move to (3,4) or something, but (3,4) then to (3,6) later.\n\nBut turn 28 is last for (4,1), but I can't reach, so same as before.\n\nEating (4,4) at turn 25 is faster.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 25.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the head direction after moves.\n\nAlso, in the answer format, I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: turns 25 to 29 or 30.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince t1=25, and I need actions for t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nI can do for 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nThen after move, head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 26: from (4,4), move U to (4,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 27: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,5), move U to (3,6), direction U.\n\nTurn 29: from (3,6), since U not possible (wall), and cannot D, so move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay move R to (4,6), for example.\n\nBut (4,6) might be free.\n\nThen turn 30 from (4,6), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output up to turn 29 or 30.\n\nSince the food at (3,6) is eaten at turn 28, and no more food, but I need to survive.\n\nBut for the response, I think the sequence to eat the food is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (4,4) immediately to have more space, but since (4,1) is not reachable, eating (4,4) is ok.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo I think moving L at turn 25 is reasonable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nThen for turn 29, from (3,6), after eating, positions: head at (3,6), body segments.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nI can output for turns 25 to 29.\n\nFor turn 29, I need to choose an action.\n\nFrom (3,6), after move U to (3,6) at turn 28, head direction U.\n\nThen turn 29, cannot move D (opposite), cannot move U (y=7 wall), so can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nBoth should be safe.\n\nSay move R to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 30 from (4,6), can move U to (4,7) wall, not; D to (4,5) which may be body; L to (3,6) occupied; R to (5,6).\n\nSo need to see positions.\n\nBut to keep it simple, for the answer, I can stop at turn 28 or 29.\n\nBut let's include 5 turns.\n\nSo turns 25 to 29.\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: R (to (4,6))\n\nBut at turn 28, after moving to (3,6), if I eat, the body is there.\n\nBut (4,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 25):**\n- **Grid:** 8x8, with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake:** Head at (5,4), moving left (L). Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] (length 8).\n- **Food:**\n  - (4,1): value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 28).\n  - (4,4): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 31).\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 34).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- **Immediate Moves from (5,4):** Current direction is L, so reverse move (R) is invalid. Moving down (D) to (5,3) causes body collision. Only valid moves are up (U) to (5,5) or left (L) to (4,4). Moving L to (4,4) eats the food immediately.\n- **Food at (4,1) is Unreachable:** The path to (4,1) is blocked by the snake's body (e.g., (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)), and with only 4 turns left (must eat by turn 28), it is impossible to reach without causing collisions. Prioritizing this risks death and wastes turns.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus:** Eating (4,4) now provides an immediate score but grows the snake, potentially reducing maneuverability. However, (4,4) and (3,6) have longer life spans, allowing a safer path. Moving U to (5,5) avoids immediate growth, enabling a path to (3,6) while still accessing (4,4) later if possible. Given the snake length (8) and grid constraints, keeping the snake shorter temporarily may improve survival odds.\n- **Path to (3,6):** (3,6) has a long life span (until turn 34) and is reachable via (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (3,6). This path avoids collisions and walls.\n- **Risk Assessment:** After eating both foods, snake length becomes 10. With 35 free cells (6x6 grid minus 1 obstacle), survival is possible but requires careful navigation to avoid dead ends. The internal obstacle at (5,2) limits downward movement, so upward paths are safer.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan (Turns 25-30):**\n- **Turn 25:** Move U to (5,5). This avoids eating (4,4) immediately, keeping the snake shorter for better maneuverability to reach (3,6). It also positions the snake to access the upper grid safely.\n- **Turn 26:** From (5,5), move L to (4,5). Direction is now U, so D is invalid. This moves toward (3,6) and avoids (4,4) for now.\n- **Turn 27:** From (4,5), move L to (3,5). (4,4) could be eaten here, but moving to (3,5) is safer and closer to (3,6).\n- **Turn 28:** From (3,5), move U to (3,6) to eat the food. This captures (3,6) with minimal risk.\n- **Turn 29:** From (3,6), direction is U. U is invalid (y=7 wall), D is invalid (opposite direction). Move R to (4,6) to explore open space.\n- **Turn 30:** From (4,6), direction is R. U and D are invalid (U: wall, D: may be risky). Move R to (5,6) to stay in open area.\n\nThis plan:\n- Eats (3,6) by turn 28 for +1 score.\n- Avoids unreachable (4,1) and minimizes risk from immediate growth.\n- Prioritizes survival by keeping paths open and using life span buffers.\n- After turn 30, the snake can navigate based on new food spawns or remaining cells.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U (up)  \nTurn 26: L (left)  \nTurn 27: L (left)  \nTurn 28: U (up)  \nTurn 29: R (right)  \nTurn 30: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 26, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,5), and the body segments are: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,5) from below, since the previous position was (5,4).\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (4,1) with life span 3 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- At (4,4) with life span 6 and value +1\n\n- At (3,6) with life span 9 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive, so no negative food here. That's good; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including the current turn. So for the food at (4,1), life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 turns, including turn 26. Let's clarify the life span countdown.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns. Since we're at turn 26, for food with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn 26 + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So at turn t, life span L means it has L turns left, including turn t. After L-1 turns, at turn t + L - 1, it will have 1 turn left, and after that turn, it disappears. Let's think:\n\n- At turn t, life span L: food is present.\n\n- After one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes L-1.\n\n- ...\n\n- When life span is 1 at turn t + L - 1, after that turn (turn t + L - 1), it becomes 0 and disappears, so it's not available on turn t + L.\n\nFor food at (4,1) with life span 3 at turn 26:\n\n- Turn 26: life span 3, present\n\n- Turn 27: life span 2, present\n\n- Turn 28: life span 1, present\n\n- Turn 29: life span 0, disappears, so not present on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood at (4,4): life span 6 at turn 26, so disappears after turn 31.\n\nFood at (3,6): life span 9 at turn 26, disappears after turn 34.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But I cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is Up, so I cannot move Down next. Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- Up: to (5,6)\n\n- Down: to (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by the second segment? Snake positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), etc. (5,4) is the second segment, so moving Down to (5,4) would cause a collision because the head would touch the body segment before it moves away.\n\nImportant: when moving, the snake moves one step, so the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment follows to the previous position of the segment before it. The tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n\nBut for collision: the head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, except the tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, after moving, if head is on a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides. But if it moves to the tail's current position, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, from (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (5,6): is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied after move.\n\nCurrent snake positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nAfter move, head moves to new position, and body shifts.\n\nIf head moves to (5,6), then new positions: head at (5,6), then body: (5,5) becomes segment 2, (5,4) segment 3, (6,4) segment 4, (6,3) segment 5, (5,3) segment 6, (4,3) segment 7, (3,3) segment 8, and tail (2,3) is removed? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, the tail end is cut off unless it eats food. Since we're just moving, not eating, the snake length stays the same, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo after moving head to (5,6), the new snake positions: [ (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] — the last segment (2,3) is gone, so (2,3) is free now.\n\nNow, cells occupied after move: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nHead is at (5,6), which is not in the body segments, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving Down to (5,4): (5,4) is currently occupied by segment 2. After move, head to (5,4), then body: segment 2 was at (5,4), but head moves to (5,4), so after move, head at (5,4), then segment 2 is now at (5,5) (previous head), segment 3 at (5,4) previous segment 2? Let's list:\n\nAfter head moves to (5,4):\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Then segment 2: previous head position (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3: previous position of segment 2, which was (5,4), but (5,4) is now head, so segment 3 moves to (5,5)? No.\n\nThe body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n\nSo positions after moving Down to (5,4):\n\n- Head at (5,4)\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (5,4)) moves to where segment 1 (head) was, which is (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3 (was at (6,4)) moves to where segment 2 was, which is (5,4) — but (5,4) is now head, so segment 3 moves to (5,4), but head is already there? Collision.\n\nSpecifically, after the move, the head is at (5,4), and segment 3 is also at (5,4)? That can't be right.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nThe snake body: segment 1: head at S1, segment 2 at S2, ..., segment n at Sn.\n\nWhen head moves to new position N, the new positions are:\n\n- New head: N\n\n- New segment 2: old S1 (previous head position)\n\n- New segment 3: old S2\n\n- ...\n\n- New segment n: old S_{n-1}\n\nThe old tail (old Sn) is vacated.\n\nIn this case, old positions: S1: (5,5), S2: (5,4), S3: (6,4), S4: (6,3), S5: (5,3), S6: (4,3), S7: (3,3), S8: (2,3)\n\nIf head moves Down to (5,4), which is old S2 position.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 2: old S1 = (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3: old S2 = (5,4)  — but (5,4) is where head is, so segment 3 is at (5,4), same as head? That means head and segment 3 are on the same cell, which is a collision.\n\nYes, so moving to a body segment that is not the tail causes collision because after the move, that body segment moves to the head's old position, but if head moves to a body segment, it might coincide.\n\nRule: head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, except if it is the tail cell.\n\nBecause the tail will move away, so after move, tail is gone, so head can be where tail was.\n\nIn this case, (5,4) is segment 2, not the tail. Tail is at (2,3). So moving to (5,4) is invalid because it's a body segment.\n\nSimilarly, moving Left to (4,5): (4,5) is not occupied, I think. Current occupied: snake and walls.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2). So (4,5) is within bounds, not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). So (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, Right to (6,5): (6,5) is free? Not listed, so yes.\n\nDown to (5,4) is invalid as above.\n\nUp to (5,6): (5,6) is y=6, which is less than 7, so not wall, and not occupied.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,5): U, L, R. Not D, because opposite direction and also collision.\n\nCurrent direction U, so moving D is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nI need to think about food and plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFood locations: (4,1), (4,4), (3,6)\n\n(4,4) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake has (4,3), but not (4,4). Positions: (4,3) is segment 6, but (4,4) is not listed, so (4,4) is free and has food.\n\n(4,4) has food with value 1, life span 6.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) has food, but (4,1) is near bottom, y=1.\n\n(3,6) has food, y=6.\n\nHead at (5,5), so (4,4) is at (4,4), which is adjacent? (5,5) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent for movement. Adjacent means same row or column, differing by 1 in x or y.\n\nSo from (5,5), (4,4) is not directly adjacent; it's one left and one down, but we can only move orthogonally.\n\nSo to reach (4,4), I need to move left to (4,5) or down to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied, so not possible directly.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo free cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSnake: head (5,5), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nFood: (4,1), (4,4), (3,6)\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is not occupied, so it has food.\n\n(4,1) at (4,1), near bottom.\n\n(3,6) at (3,6), near top.\n\nLife spans: (4,1) life 3, so must be eaten by turn 28 or it disappears.\n\n(4,4) life 6, by turn 31.\n\n(3,6) life 9, by turn 34.\n\nNow, head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R.\n\nIf I go U to (5,6): (5,6) is y=6, which is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok. Then I'm at (5,6), closer to (3,6) food at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, so from (5,6), I can go left to (4,6) or (3,6) directly if possible.\n\nBut I need to think about the path.\n\nIf I go L to (4,5): (4,5) is free, then I can go down to (4,4) to eat the food there, but (4,4) has food.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), and from (4,5), moving down to (4,4) would be possible if (4,4) is free, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (6,5), then I might go down or something, but (6,5) is farther from food.\n\n(4,4) food is nearby and has shorter life? Life span 6, plenty of time.\n\n(4,1) has short life, only 3 turns left.\n\nAt turn 26, life 3, so must be eaten by turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life 6, by turn 31.\n\n(3,6) life 9, by turn 34.\n\nSo (4,1) is urgent; it will disappear soon.\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), which is near the bottom, and snake head is at (5,5), so it's 4 units away in y-direction, since |5-1|=4, and x is same.\n\nManhattan distance to (4,1) from (5,5) is |5-4| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nSimilarly to (4,4): |5-4| + |5-4| =1+1=2.\n\nTo (3,6): |5-3| + |5-6| =2+1=3.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), I need at least 5 moves, but life span only 3, so by turn 28, I need to eat it on or before turn 28.\n\nTurn 26: current, if I start moving now, after 3 moves, at turn 28, I can be there if I go directly.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (4,1) by turn 28.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,5), if I move Down, but I can't move Down because it's opposite direction and collision. Possible moves only U, L, R.\n\nIf I move Left to (4,5), that's one step.\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R. Direction would be from (5,5) to (4,5), so Left, so direction L.\n\nThen I can move Down to (4,4), or Left to (3,5), etc.\n\nIf I go Down to (4,4), that's turn 27, and (4,4) has food, so I eat it.\n\nBut I want to go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,5), move Down to (4,4) on turn 27, then I eat the food at (4,4), so snake grows, length increases.\n\nIf I eat food, when head moves to food cell, it eats it, and the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,4) on turn 27, I eat the food, so new head at (4,4), and the tail doesn't move, so new segment added where tail was, but tail was at (2,3), so after eating, positions: head at (4,4), then previous positions: the body segments from before, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is added at the old tail position.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 26: head at (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nMove Left to (4,5): no food, so just move.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,5), then segment 2 at old head (5,5), segment 3 at (5,4), segment 4 at (6,4), segment 5 at (6,3), segment 6 at (5,3), segment 7 at (4,3), segment 8 at (3,3), and tail (2,3) vacated? After move, no eating, so tail is removed.\n\nNew snake: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] — the last segment (2,3) is gone, so positions are 8 segments? Original 8 segments, after move without eating, still 8, but tail changed.\n\nLength is same, 8 segments.\n\nNow, turn 27: head at (4,5), direction from (5,5) to (4,5) is Left, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) but (5,5) is now occupied by segment 2, so cannot move there, collision.\n\n(4,4) has food, so if I move D to (4,4), I eat the food.\n\nThen, after eating: head moves to (4,4), food eaten, so snake grows: new head at (4,4), and the tail does not move, so the body segments: segment 2 at old head (4,5), segment 3 at old segment 2 (5,5), and so on, up to the tail, which stays, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n\nStandard snake: when eating, the head moves to food, the body follows as usual, but the tail doesn't retract, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell (4,4), then the previous head position becomes segment 2, which is (4,5), then previous segment 2 becomes segment 3, which is (5,5), previous segment 3 becomes segment 4, (5,4), and so on, down to previous segment 8, which was (3,3), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so the tail is now the new segment at (3,3), but (3,3) was segment 8, now it is segment 9, and the previous tail position is not vacated; it stays.\n\nLet's list:\n\nBefore eating at turn 27: positions [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] 8 segments.\n\nMove head to (4,4), which has food.\n\nNew positions after eating: head at (4,4), then segment 2 at previous head (4,5), segment 3 at previous segment 2 (5,5), segment 4 at previous segment 3 (5,4), segment 5 at previous segment 4 (6,4), segment 6 at previous segment 5 (6,3), segment 7 at previous segment 6 (5,3), segment 8 at previous segment 7 (4,3), segment 9 at previous segment 8 (3,3). So now snake is 9 segments long, positions from head to tail: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nTail is at (3,3).\n\nBut I was trying to reach (4,1), which is still far.\n\n(4,1) food will disappear after turn 28, so it must be eaten on turn 28 or earlier.\n\nTurn 28 is the last turn it can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 26, I am at (5,5).\n\nIf I want to go to (4,1), I need to move down, but I can't directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move Left to (4,5), as above, on turn 26.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (4,5), if I move Down to (4,4), I eat food there, but then I'm at (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen on turn 28, from (4,4), I can move Down to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by segment 8 in the new snake? After eating, positions include (4,3) as segment 8.\n\nFrom above: after eating at (4,4) on turn 27, positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied by segment 8.\n\nMoving Down from (4,4) to (4,3) would be moving to a body segment, which is not tail, so collision.\n\nTail is at (3,3).\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) but (4,5) is segment 2, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (4,3) occupied, cannot.\n\nL to (3,4) — (3,4) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nR to (5,4) but (5,4) is segment 4, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,4) is L to (3,4) or U, but U to (4,5) occupied, so only L to (3,4).\n\nThen I go to (3,4), but (4,1) is at (4,1), I'm moving away.\n\nFrom (4,4) only L to (3,4) is possible.\n\nThen at (3,4), I can move down or left, etc., but (4,1) is south, so I need to go down, but from (3,4), moving down to (3,3) but (3,3) is tail, which might be ok, but after previous, tail is at (3,3), so moving to (3,3) is possible since it's tail.\n\nBut let's not digress; the point is, if I eat (4,4) on turn 27, I can't reach (4,1) on turn 28 because I'm stuck at (4,4) and can only move to (3,4), then from there, to (4,1) is at least 3 moves away: to (3,3) or something, but |3-4| + |4-1| =1+3=4 distance, so at least 4 moves, but on turn 28 I only have one move, so I can't reach (4,1) by turn 28 if I eat (4,4).\n\nAlternative: from turn 26, instead of going to (4,4), I go directly towards (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,5), move Left to (4,5) on turn 26.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (4,5), instead of going down to (4,4), I go Down to (4,4) is one option, but I can go Left to (3,5) or Right to (5,5) but (5,5) occupied, or Up to (4,6).\n\nTo go to (4,1), I should go Down to (4,4), but (4,4) has food, so if I go there, I eat it, as above.\n\nBut if I go to (4,4), I eat it and grow, and then I can't move down to (4,3) because it's occupied.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move directly Down? To (4,4), which has food.\n\nBut there's no way to go to (4,3) directly from (4,5) without going to (4,4) first.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can only move orthogonally, so to (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), or (5,5) but (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo to go down, I must go to (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) has food, so I will eat it if I move there.\n\nIf I don't want to eat it, I could avoid it, but I have to move, so from (4,5), if I move to (4,4), I eat it.\n\nI could move to (3,5) or (4,6) to avoid, but then I'm not going towards (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is urgent, so I need to go down.\n\nPerhaps from turn 26, I should go Right or Up to position myself better, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother idea: move Right from (5,5) to (6,5) on turn 26.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move Down to (6,4), but (6,4) is occupied by segment 3 or something.\n\nCurrent positions after move to (6,5): from (5,5) to (6,5), so new positions: head (6,5), segment 2 (5,5), segment 3 (5,4), segment 4 (6,4), segment 5 (6,3), segment 6 (5,3), segment 7 (4,3), segment 8 (3,3), tail (2,3) gone.\n\n(6,4) is occupied by segment 4, so moving Down to (6,4) would be collision.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) occupied, cannot, L to (5,5) occupied, cannot, R to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so not possible.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) is possible from (6,5)? R to (7,5) is x=7, wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,5) occupied.\n\nD to (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo only U to (6,6).\n\nThen I go up, away from (4,1).\n\nNot good for reaching (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving Up to (5,6) on turn 26.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, or L to (4,6), or R to (6,6), or D to (5,5) but (5,5) will be occupied after move.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), segment 2 (5,5), segment 3 (5,4), etc.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5) occupied by segment 2, cannot; L to (4,6); R to (6,6).\n\nSo L or R.\n\nSay L to (4,6), then I'm near (3,6) food.\n\nBut (4,1) is far.\n\nSo to reach (4,1) by turn 28, it seems impossible from current position because:\n\n- From (5,5), I can only go to (4,5), (5,6), or (6,5)\n\n- If I go to (4,5) on turn 26, then on turn 27, from (4,5) I must go to (4,4) to go down, but then I eat food at (4,4) on turn 27, and on turn 28 I am at (4,4) and can only go to (3,4), not to (4,3) or down.\n\nFrom (4,4) after eating, I can only go to (3,4), as earlier.\n\nThen from (3,4) on turn 28, I can move to (3,3) or (3,5) or (2,4), etc., but not to (4,1).\n\nTo reach (4,1) from (3,4) in one move? Impossible, Manhattan distance 3.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 27 from (4,5) I go to (3,5) instead of down, then from (3,5) on turn 27, I can go to (3,4) or (3,6) or (2,5), etc., then on turn 28 to (4,1) is still far.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,1) is |3-4| + |5-1| =1+4=5 distance, so at least 5 moves, but only two moves from turn 27 to 28, so I can be at best at (3,3) or something, not (4,1).\n\nFor example, turn 27 from (4,5) to (3,5), then turn 28 from (3,5) to (3,4), then (3,4) to (4,4) but (4,4) might have food, but I'm not there yet.\n\nBut (4,1) is not reached.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach (4,1) by turn 28 from current position, given the constraints and the snake body blocking direct paths.\n\nThe food at (4,1) will disappear and cannot be eaten. So I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nThat makes sense. So (4,1) is not reachable in time, so I should go for other food.\n\nNow, (4,4) is close and has 6 turns life, so no rush.\n\n(3,6) has 9 turns, also no rush.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so I should eat food when possible.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,3), head at (5,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so |dx|=1 and dy=0 or |dy|=1 and dx=0.\n\n(5,5) to (2,3) is not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nIf I go U to (5,6): then I'm closer to (3,6) food.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go L to (4,6) or R to (6,6), etc.\n\n(4,4) food is at (4,4), which is south-west.\n\nIf I go L to (4,5): then I can go to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nIf I go R to (6,5): then I might get stuck or go to other areas.\n\nBut (6,5) has only one move to (6,6), as earlier, which might not be good.\n\nLet's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nThere is an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is below, but not relevant immediately.\n\nAlso, the snake body is blocking some areas.\n\nCurrent free cells, but with food at (4,4) and (3,6).\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is empty now.\n\nBut if I move to it, I eat and grow.\n\nBut after eating, the snake body might block paths.\n\nI need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nSince the prompt says to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate a few moves.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list the current state again.\n\nTurn 26: head (5,5), direction U.\n\nMoves: U, L, R.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,6)\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)  -- tail (2,3) gone.\n\nDirection from (5,5) to (5,6) is Up, so new direction U.\n\nThen from (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, invalid; D to (5,5) occupied, invalid; L to (4,6); R to (6,6).\n\nSo L or R.\n\nSay I go L to (4,6) to go towards (3,6) food.\n\nThen turn 27: head to (4,6), new positions: head (4,6), segment 2 (5,6), segment 3 (5,5), segment 4 (5,4), segment 5 (6,4), segment 6 (6,3), segment 7 (5,3), segment 8 (4,3), tail (3,3) gone? After move from (5,6) to (4,6), no eat, so positions: [ (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] -- 8 segments, (3,3) vacated.\n\nDirection to (4,6) from (5,6) is Left.\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) wall; D to (4,5); L to (3,6); R to (5,6) occupied.\n\nSo D or L.\n\n(3,6) has food, so I can go L to (3,6) to eat it on turn 27? Turn 27.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 27, I eat the food at (3,6).\n\nThen snake grows to 9 segments.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), segment 2 (4,6), segment 3 (5,6), segment 4 (5,5), segment 5 (5,4), segment 6 (6,4), segment 7 (6,3), segment 8 (5,3), segment 9 (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nNow, food eaten, score +1.\n\nThen turn 28, from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) wall; D to (3,5); L to (2,6); R to (4,6) occupied.\n\n(4,6) is segment 2, so cannot move R.\n\nU wall, so only D or L.\n\nL to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) might be free, or (2,6).\n\nBut no food nearby, so I need to find more food, but only (4,4) left, but (4,4) is at (4,4), which is south.\n\nBut from (3,6), if I go D to (3,5), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) is at (4,4), so I can go right or down.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nFirst, back to turn 26 choices.\n\nIf from (5,5) I go L to (4,5) on turn 26.\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)  -- tail (2,3) gone.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 27, from (4,5), moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) occupied, invalid.\n\n(4,4) has food, so if I go D to (4,4), I eat it.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,4), segment 2 (4,5), segment 3 (5,5), segment 4 (5,4), segment 5 (6,4), segment 6 (6,3), segment 7 (5,3), segment 8 (4,3), segment 9 (3,3)  -- tail at (3,3).\n\nThen turn 28, from (4,4), as before, only possible move is L to (3,4) because U, D, R are occupied or invalid.\n\nU to (4,5) occupied, D to (4,3) occupied, R to (5,4) occupied, L to (3,4) free.\n\nSo move to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move to (3,3) or (3,5) or (2,4), etc.\n\n(3,3) is tail, so I can move there.\n\nBut no food.\n\nThen I can head towards (3,6) food.\n\nFrom (3,4), to (3,6) is up, so U to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) has food, so I can eat it later.\n\nIf from turn 27, at (4,5), I don't go to (4,4), I could go to (4,6) or (3,5).\n\nBut (4,4) food is there, so not eating it might be wasteful, but it has life span 6, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) has long life.\n\nBut let's see the grid after eating.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2) might affect paths.\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, not near current positions.\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead, I need to consider sequences.\n\nAlso, after eating food, the snake grows, which might block paths, but also allows more score.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nNow, option from turn 26: move R to (6,5).\n\nThen positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)  -- tail gone.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (6,5), as before, only possible move is U to (6,6) because D to (6,4) occupied, L to (5,5) occupied, R to (7,5) wall.\n\nSo must go U to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 27: head (6,6), positions: head (6,6), segment 2 (6,5), segment 3 (5,5), segment 4 (5,4), segment 5 (6,4), segment 6 (6,3), segment 7 (5,3), segment 8 (4,3)  -- (3,3) gone.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (6,6), moves: U to (6,7) wall; D to (6,5) occupied; L to (5,6); R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 28: to (5,6), and so on.\n\nBut this is going to the top-left, away from food.\n\n(4,4) and (3,6) are in the left area, so going right then up might not be efficient.\n\nSo probably not good.\n\nBetter to go left or up from start.\n\nNow, between U and L from (5,5).\n\nIf I go U to (5,6), I can eat (3,6) soon.\n\nIf I go L to (4,5), I can eat (4,4) soon.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut (4,4) is closer in terms of turns: from (5,5), move L to (4,5) turn 26, then D to (4,4) turn 27 to eat.\n\nWhereas for (3,6), from (5,5) U to (5,6) turn 26, then L to (4,6) turn 27, then L to (3,6) turn 27 or 28.\n\nIf from (5,6) on turn 27, I go directly to (3,6) if possible? From (5,6) to (3,6) is not adjacent; I need to go to (4,6) first.\n\nTurn 26: U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) to (4,6)  (move L)\n\nThen turn 28: from (4,6) to (3,6) to eat.\n\nSo eat on turn 28.\n\nFor (4,4): eat on turn 27.\n\nSo eating (4,4) gives score one turn earlier.\n\nBut both are positive.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to see where I can go.\n\nAlso, there is the (4,1) food but it's unreachable, so ignore.\n\nNow, after eating (4,4) on turn 27, I am at (4,4) and can only move to (3,4) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,3), (3,5), or (2,4).\n\n(3,3) is tail, so moving to (3,3) is possible.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,6) food.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,6) first, I am at (3,6) and can move to (3,5) or (2,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the board space.\n\nThe grid has walls and obstacles, and the snake body.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), the snake is longer, and positions around might be blocked.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,4) on turn 27, positions: head (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo the area around (4,4) is occupied except left to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen moving to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  -- tail (3,3) gone? After move to (3,4), no eat, so tail (3,3) vacated.\n\nNew positions: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] -- 9 segments.\n\n(4,3) is still there.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move to (3,3), (3,5), or (2,4).\n\n(3,3) is free now, so I can move D to (3,3).\n\nOr U to (3,5), etc.\n\n(3,6) food is at (3,6), so I can go U to (3,5), then U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nOn turn 29, from (3,4) to (3,5), then turn 30 to (3,6) eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,6) first.\n\nSuppose turn 26: U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 27: L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 28: L to (3,6) eat food.\n\nPositions after eating: head (3,6), segment 2 (4,6), segment 3 (5,6), segment 4 (5,5), segment 5 (5,4), segment 6 (6,4), segment 7 (6,3), segment 8 (5,3), segment 9 (4,3)\n\nThen from (3,6), turn 29, moves: D to (3,5), L to (2,6), R to (4,6) occupied, U wall.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nSay D to (3,5), then I can go to (4,4) later.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is south-east from (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), to (4,4) is diagonal, so need to go to (3,4) or (4,5) first.\n\nBut (4,5) is segment 2 in the current positions, but after moving, it might be different.\n\nAt turn 29, from (3,6) move D to (3,5), no food, so positions: head (3,5), segment 2 (3,6), segment 3 (4,6), segment 4 (5,6), etc. down to segment 9 (5,3)? Let's list:\n\nBefore move: positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove to (3,5): new head (3,5), segment 2 old head (3,6), segment 3 old seg2 (4,6), segment 4 old seg3 (5,6), segment 5 old seg4 (5,5), segment 6 old seg5 (5,4), segment 7 old seg6 (6,4), segment 8 old seg7 (6,3), segment 9 old seg8 (5,3), and old seg9 (4,3) vacated.\n\n(4,3) was segment 9, now gone.\n\nSo positions: [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) ]\n\n(4,4) is free and has food.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,4), (3,6) occupied, (2,5), or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free? Not occupied, so I can move R to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) to eat.\n\nSo turn 30: from (3,5) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: from (4,5) to (4,4) eat.\n\nSo eat (4,4) on turn 31.\n\nLife span of (4,4) is 6 at turn 26, so at turn 31, it would have life span 6 - (31-26) = 6-5=1, so on turn 31 it is present, can be eaten.\n\nDisappears after turn 31, so on turn 31 it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (4,4) first, then (3,6) later.\n\nIf I eat (4,4) on turn 27, then on turn 28 to (3,4), turn 29 to (3,5), turn 30 to (3,6) eat.\n\nSo eat (3,6) on turn 30.\n\n(3,6) life span 9 at turn 26, turn 30: 30-26=4, life span 9-4=5, plenty.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat both foods.\n\nBut in the first sequence, eating (3,6) first, then (4,4) on turn 31.\n\nIn second, eating (4,4) first on turn 27, then (3,6) on turn 30.\n\nTurn 30 is earlier than turn 31.\n\nAlso, in terms of score, eating sooner might be better, but since no immediate danger, it's fine.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but here the grid has space.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat (4,4), if I go that way, on turn 28 I have to move to (3,4), which might be ok.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but tail is not near head.\n\nNow, for the move at turn 26, I need to decide.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (4,4) directly.\n\nSince (4,4) can be eaten on turn 27 if I go left then down.\n\nIf I go up, I eat (3,6) on turn 28.\n\nBut (4,4) has shorter life? No, both have sufficient life.\n\n(4,4) life 6, (3,6) life 9.\n\nBut (4,4) is closer to current position.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,4), I am closer to (3,6).\n\nFrom (4,4) after eating, I go to (3,4), then (3,5), then (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,6) after eating, I go to (3,5), then (4,5), then (4,4).\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in the first case, when I eat (4,4) early, I have a longer snake when moving to (3,6), but it should be fine.\n\nNow, to avoid potential blocking, but here no issue.\n\nAnother point: the food at (4,4) is on the body path, but since the body moves, it might be eaten only if head moves there.\n\nIn this case, it's free.\n\nNow, I think both options are valid, but since the prompt says to prioritize long-term survival, I need to see if one path is safer.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,5) first, I might get stuck in a corner.\n\nBut with U or L, I should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (4,4) first because it can be eaten sooner.\n\nLet's list the sequence for going left first.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,5) move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 27: from (4,5) move D to (4,4) eat food. Now snake length 9, positions: head (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4) only possible move L to (3,4) (since U,D,R occupied)\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  -- tail (3,3) gone.\n\nTurn 29: from (3,4) can move U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), or R to (4,4) occupied.\n\n(3,5) free, so U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5) to (3,6) eat food at (3,6). Snake grows to 10.\n\nPositions: head (3,6), segment 2 (3,5), segment 3 (3,4), segment 4 (4,4), segment 5 (4,5), segment 6 (5,5), segment 7 (5,4), segment 8 (6,4), segment 9 (6,3), segment 10 (5,3)\n\nThen I can continue, but no more food, so survival.\n\nIf I go up first:\n\nTurn 26: U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 27: L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 28: L to (3,6) eat. Positions: head (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nTurn 29: from (3,6) move D to (3,5) (since U wall, L possible, R occupied)\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5) move R to (4,5) (U to (3,6) occupied, D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5))\n\n(4,5) free, so to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: from (4,5) move D to (4,4) eat. Snake grows.\n\nIn this case, I eat (3,6) on turn 28 and (4,4) on turn 31.\n\nIn the first sequence, I eat (4,4) on turn 27 and (3,6) on turn 30.\n\nSo I get the first point earlier, and the second point at the same turn or earlier? Turn 30 vs turn 31, so first sequence has both by turn 30, second by turn 31.\n\nFirst sequence: eat (4,4) turn 27, (3,6) turn 30.\n\nSecond sequence: eat (3,6) turn 28, (4,4) turn 31.\n\nSo first sequence gets first food one turn earlier.\n\nBut in terms of total score, same, but eating earlier might be better for risk, but here no difference.\n\nIn the first sequence, after eating (4,4), on turn 28 I have to move to (3,4), which is necessary to reach (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, in second sequence, after (3,6), I move to (3,5) then (4,5) to (4,4).\n\nBoth fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I move to (3,4) on turn 28, the cell (4,4) is occupied by segment 2, but I moved away.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think going left to eat (4,4) first is slightly better because I eat it sooner and then can proceed to (3,6).\n\nMoreover, (4,4) has shorter life, but still 6 turns, so not urgent, but why not eat it.\n\nLife span 6, but I eat on turn 27, which is fine.\n\nIf I delay, it might be riskier, but here I can eat both.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) is expiring, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nSo for turn 26, I should move Left to (4,5).\n\nThen for turn 27, move Down to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen turn 28 move Left to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 29 move Up to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 30 move Up to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions starting from turn 26 for a few turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 26, 27, 28, etc., but I don't need to specify all, but at least a few to show the plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list for several turns.\n\nNow, for the move, after turn 30, I need to survive, but no food, so I should move safely.\n\nBut I can plan for 5 turns: turns 26 to 30 or 31.\n\nBut let's define the actions.\n\nFirst action: turn 26, move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 27, move D to (4,4) eat\n\nThen turn 28, from (4,4) only L possible, to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,4) move U to (3,5)  (since I want to go to (3,6))\n\nThen turn 30, from (3,5) move U to (3,6) eat.\n\nBut on turn 30, from (3,5) to (3,6), is (3,6) free? At that point, in the sequence, when I reach turn 30, (3,6) should be free if I eat it then.\n\nIn the plan, it should be.\n\nAfter turn 28, positions: turn 28 head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  -- 9 segments.\n\nThen turn 29: move U to (3,5), no food, so positions: head (3,5), segment 2 (3,4), segment 3 (4,4), segment 4 (4,5), segment 5 (5,5), segment 6 (5,4), segment 7 (6,4), segment 8 (6,3), segment 9 (5,3)  -- (4,3) gone.\n\n(3,6) is free.\n\nTurn 30: move U to (3,6), eat food, grow to 10 segments.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I had gone up first, I eat later.\n\nBut both ok.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 26, moving Left is safe.\n\nMoving Right is not good, as I have to go to (6,6) and might be cornered.\n\nSo best to move Left.\n\nTherefore, for turn 26, action: L (left)\n\nThen turn 27: D (down) to eat (4,4)\n\nThen turn 28: L (left) to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 29: U (up) to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 30: U (up) to (3,6) eat\n\nBut I don't need to specify up to eating, but for the answer, I can list a few turns.\n\nSince the food at (4,1) is expiring and I can't eat, but just to be sure, is there any way?\n\nSuppose on turn 26, I move Down, but I can't, not possible.\n\nOr if I move in a way to free the path, but with the body, it's tight.\n\nFor example, if I move Right to (6,5), then Up to (6,6), then Left to (5,6), etc., but that takes turns and (4,1) disappears.\n\nNo, impossible.\n\nSo ignore.\n\nThus, the plan is to go for (4,4) first.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nThen for subsequent, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer format, I should list actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can list 5 actions: turns 26 to 30.\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nBut on turn 30 I eat (3,6), but I don't need to stop.\n\nI can list as per the sequence.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nAlso, need to specify the direction.\n\nNow, head direction: at turn 26, direction is U, moving L, so new direction L.\n\nThen turn 27, from (4,5) direction L, moving D, which is not opposite, allowed.\n\nThen turn 28, from (4,4) after eating, direction to (4,4) was D, but now moving L, so direction L.\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,4) moving U, direction U.\n\nTurn 30, from (3,5) moving U, direction U.\n\nAll fine.\n\nI think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 26 to 30). The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,4) first, as it is reachable by turn 27 and has a shorter remaining life span (6 turns at turn 26) compared to (3,6) (9 turns), but more importantly, it allows for a safer path to (3,6) afterward.\n- Avoid the food at (4,1) as it is unreachable by turn 28 (its disappearance turn) due to distance and body blockages.\n- Ensure all moves avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake body, while respecting movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Plan Summary (Turns 26-30):\n- **Turn 26**: Move left (L) to (4,5). This positions the snake to access (4,4) on the next turn.\n- **Turn 27**: Move down (D) to (4,4) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 9). This is safe as (4,4) is free and eating it early secures the point.\n- **Turn 28**: Move left (L) to (3,4). After eating at (4,4), this is the only safe move, as other directions are blocked by the body.\n- **Turn 29**: Move up (U) to (3,5). This heads toward (3,6) and avoids dead ends.\n- **Turn 30**: Move up (U) to (3,6) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 10). This is achievable as (3,6) will be free and within life span.\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Risk Avoidance**: By eating (4,4) first, the snake avoids the expired (4,1) and uses the body to block fewer paths. The path to (3,6) remains open, and no \"tail reward danger\" arises (tail is never adjacent to head during this sequence).\n- **Efficiency**: This sequence eats both available foods by turn 30, maximizing score quickly. Eating (4,4) on turn 27 is faster than alternative paths (e.g., going to (3,6) first would delay eating (4,4) to turn 31).\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: Beyond turn 30, the snake should head toward open areas (e.g., left or up from (3,6)) to avoid trapping itself, as no more food is present. The grid has space, so survival is prioritized.\n\n### Detailed Move Validation:\n- **Turn 26 (Start: head (5,5), direction U)**: Move L to (4,5). Valid moves: U, L, R (D is invalid due to opposite direction and body collision). L is chosen to reach (4,4) efficiently.\n- **Turn 27 (Start: head (4,5), direction L)**: Move D to (4,4). Valid moves: U, D, L (R invalid due to body). D eats food safely.\n- **Turn 28 (Start: head (4,4), direction D after move)**: Move L to (3,4). Valid moves: only L (U, D, R blocked by body). Necessary to progress toward (3,6).\n- **Turn 29 (Start: head (3,4), direction L after move)**: Move U to (3,5). Valid moves: U, D, L (R invalid due to body). U is chosen to approach (3,6).\n- **Turn 30 (Start: head (3,5), direction U)**: Move U to (3,6). Valid moves: U, D, L, R (U eats food; no collisions).\n\nThis plan scores 2 points by turn 30 with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 27: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 28: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 29: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 30: U (up)\n}",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls.\n- There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- Snake positions: Head is at (4,5), and the body segments are: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So the snake has 8 segments.\n- Snake head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (4,5) from previous position. Since positions are listed head first, and it was moving left, the previous head was at (5,5), and now it's at (4,5).\n\n**Food:**\n- Food at (4,1) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n- Food at (4,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n- Food at (3,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn, including this turn.\n\nLife span: For (4,1), life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns from now. Since it decreases on the current turn, after this turn (turn 27), it will have life span 1, and after turn 28, it disappears. Similarly, (4,4) has life span 5, so it will last until turn 31 (27+4, since after 5 decreases: turn 27:5, 28:4, 29:3, 30:2, 31:1, gone on turn 32? Let's clarify.\n\nThe life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn t, when we get the state, the life span is given. After we take an action, it decreases by 1 for the next state.\n\nFor food at (4,1) with life span 2 at turn 27:\n- Turn 27: life span 2 (can be eaten on this turn)\n- After turn 27 action, life span becomes 1 for turn 28.\n- Turn 28: if not eaten, life span 1, can be eaten, then after action, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n- So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28; after turn 28, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, snake head is at (4,5), direction left. So possible moves: since it was moving left, it can go left, up, or down, but not right (no instant reverse). From (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- Left (L): to (3,5) — but need to check if valid.\n- Up (U): to (4,6)\n- Down (D): to (4,4)\n\nRight (R) is opposite to current left, so not allowed.\n\nNow, check for collisions or walls.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (3,5): x=3>0, y=5<7, not border, and no internal obstacle mentioned for (3,5), so should be ok. Internal obstacle only at (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): x=4, y=6; y=6<7, not border, no obstacle.\n\n(4,4): x=4, y=4, not border, no obstacle.\n\nNow, snake body positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), is (3,5) occupied by body? Positions: (4,5) is head, (5,5), (5,4), etc., (3,3) is tail. (3,5) is not in the list, so empty? Let's list all body cells: (4,5) head, (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So (3,5) is not occupied, so should be safe, but when I move, the snake moves, so I need to think about the next state.\n\nWhen I move, the head goes to the new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, except if I eat food, the tail doesn't move, and snake grows.\n\nBut for collision check: when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that will not be the tail after movement, it's a collision. Since the tail moves, moving to the tail cell is safe, but only if it's the very end and not occupied otherwise.\n\nStandard snake movement: if head moves to a cell not occupied by body except the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away. If head moves to a cell that is body but not tail, collision.\n\nIn this case, possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- L to (3,5): (3,5) is not in body positions, so empty, safe.\n\n- U to (4,6): (4,6) not in body, safe.\n\n- D to (4,4): (4,4) is not in body positions? Body positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So (4,4) is not listed, so should be empty and safe.\n\nBut there is food at (4,4), but that's separate; if I move to (4,4), I eat the food.\n\nNow, also, food at (4,4) has life span 5, so it will be there for a while.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So tail at (3,3).\n\nFood: (4,1), (4,4), (3,6)\n\nNow, head at (4,5), direction left.\n\nPossible actions this turn (turn 27): U, D, L (since no reverse to R)\n\nI need to choose an action that leads to a good path for the next 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food:\n\n- (4,1) is at y=1, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 28. To eat it, I need to reach (4,1) by turn 28. But (4,1) is far south, and I'm at (4,5), so 4 steps down? From (4,5) to (4,1) is 4 units down, but with obstacles.\n\nPath: from (4,5) to (4,1), directly down, but there might be body or walls.\n\ny from 5 to 1, so I need to go down.\n\nBut at (4,4) there is food, which is closer.\n\n- (4,4) at same x, y=4, which is adjacent down from head (4,5). So I can move down to (4,4) and eat it immediately if I choose D.\n\n- (3,6) at x=3,y=6, which is up and left from head (4,5). From (4,5), up to (4,6) then left to (3,6)? (3,6) is one step left and one up, but from (4,5), (3,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,5), (4,6), (4,4), (5,5) but (5,5) is body, so not movable.\n\n(3,6) is adjacent to (3,5) or (4,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to plan.\n\nAlso, there is a special case about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (3,3). Head at (4,5), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent cells to head: (4,5) has neighbors (4,6) up, (4,4) down, (3,5) left, (5,5) right, but (5,5) is body, so only U, D, L possible, all not tail.\n\nTail at (3,3), which is far, so no issue now.\n\nNow, if I move down to (4,4), I eat the food at (4,4), snake grows, so new head at (4,4), body: (4,5) becomes segment, then (5,5), etc., tail still (3,3)? When I eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake positions after eating: head (4,4), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, so positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] so 9 segments, tail at (3,3).\n\nThen direction would be down.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nFood at (4,1) is about to disappear soon, life span 2, so if I don't eat it by turn 28, it's gone.\n\nTurn 27: life span 2, after turn 27 action, if not eaten, life span 1 for turn 28. Can be eaten on turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has life span 5, so plenty of time.\n\n(3,6) has life span 8, also plenty.\n\nBut (4,1) is urgent if I want to eat it.\n\nBut going down to (4,1) might be risky.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nAction turn 27: D to (4,4)\n\nThen I eat the food, snake grows to 9 segments. Head now at (4,4), direction down.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,4): since direction down, can go D, L, R, but not U (reverse).\n\nFrom (4,4), neighbors: (4,3) down, (4,5) up, (3,4) left, (5,4) right.\n\nBut (4,5) is now body (second segment), so cannot move up. (5,4) is body? After move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)? (5,4) is a body segment.\n\nList positions after move: after moving down to (4,4) and eating, positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nNow from head (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- Down (D) to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by body, it's the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3)\n\n(4,3) is segment 7, which is not tail; tail is (3,3). So moving to (4,3) would collide with body, death.\n\n- Left (L) to (3,4): (3,4) not in positions, so empty? Is it wall? x=3,y=4, not border, no obstacle, so should be safe.\n\n- Right (R) to (5,4): (5,4) is segment 3, body, not tail, so collision, death.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,4) is left to (3,4), since U is reverse and blocked anyway.\n\nDirection is down, so from (4,4), moving left is allowed, not reverse.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,4), direction is down, so next moves: can go down (but to (4,3) is body, death), left to (3,4), or right to (5,4) but body, death, or up but reverse not allowed and blocked.\n\nSo only left to (3,4) is possible and safe.\n\nSo if I move D on turn 27, then on turn 28, I must move L to (3,4).\n\nNow, after turn 28: head to (3,4), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves. Tail was (3,3), moves to? When not eating, tail moves forward.\n\nAfter move to (3,4) without eating, positions: head (3,4), then body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail was (3,3), which moves off, so new tail is (4,3)? Let's see: previous positions before move: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4), and no eat, so tail (3,3) is removed, so positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] so tail is (4,3)\n\nDirection now, since moved left to (3,4), direction left.\n\nNow from (3,4), possible moves: direction left, so can go L, U, D, not R (reverse).\n\nNeighbors: (2,4) left, (3,5) up, (3,3) down.\n\n(3,3) down: but (3,3) is now occupied? Positions: (3,4) head, (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(3,3) not in list, so empty.\n\n(2,4) not in list.\n\n(3,5) up: (3,5) not in positions, empty.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is body, so not accessible from here.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3)\n\nAll seem safe, but need to check walls: (2,4) x=2>0, y=4<7, ok; (3,5) x=3,y=5<7, ok; (3,3) x=3,y=3>0, ok. No obstacles.\n\nBut there is food at (4,1) which might be eaten soon, but now I'm at (3,4), and food at (4,1) is south-west.\n\nAlso, food at (3,6) north.\n\nBut (4,1) life span: after turn 27, if not eaten, life span 1 on turn 28. After turn 28, if I don't eat it on turn 28, it disappears.\n\nOn turn 28, I am at (3,4), and food at (4,1). From (3,4) to (4,1) is not adjacent; need to move down then right or something, but not possible in one move. So I cannot eat (4,1) on turn 28 from (3,4). And after turn 28, it disappears, so I miss it.\n\nIf I had gone directly towards (4,1) earlier, but I didn't.\n\nBack to turn 27 choices.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4) on turn 27, I eat it, but then I am forced to go left to (3,4) on turn 28, and I miss the (4,1) food since it disappears after turn 28.\n\n(4,1) can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n\nIf on turn 27, I don't move down, but go left or up, I might reach (4,1) on turn 28.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), if I move left to (3,5) on turn 27.\n\nThen, head to (3,5), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves. Positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3) moves off, so new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nDirection left.\n\nNow from (3,5), possible moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4)\n\n(3,6) has food! Food at (3,6), value 1, life span 8.\n\nU to (3,6) would eat it.\n\n(3,4) down, empty.\n\n(2,5) left, empty.\n\nOn turn 28, if I move U to (3,6), I eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows, positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and tail remains? When eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] 9 segments, tail (4,3)\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow, from here, I can consider going to other food, but (4,1) is about to expire.\n\nBut after turn 28, (4,1) disappears, so I can't eat it anymore.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 27 I move up to (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), move U to (4,6).\n\nNo food at (4,6), so positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3) moves off, new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot, collision.\n\nD to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, and reverse? Direction up, moving down is reverse, not allowed.\n\nL to (3,6), R to (5,6)\n\n(3,6) has food, (5,6) might be empty.\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6, not border, no obstacle, and not in positions, so ok.\n\nSo can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nIf move L to (3,6) on turn 28, eat food.\n\nBut again, (4,1) missed.\n\nSo in all cases, if I don't go directly towards (4,1) on turn 27, I miss it.\n\nNow, can I go to (4,1) from (4,5) on turn 27?\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move down to (4,4), but (4,4) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, but then I'm stuck at (4,4) and must go left, away from (4,1).\n\nIf I don't move down, but go left or up, I can then go down later, but (4,1) is only 2 turns left.\n\nFrom (4,5), to reach (4,1), I need to go down 4 steps, but in 2 turns, I can only move 2 steps, so impossible to reach (4,1) from (4,5) in one or two moves; it's 4 cells away.\n\nDistance: from (4,5) to (4,1) is |5-1| = 4 in y-direction, so minimum 4 moves down, but I have only 2 turns (27 and 28) to act before it disappears after turn 28.\n\nOn turn 27, I can move, and on turn 28, I can move, so after two moves, I can be at, for example, if I move down twice: from (4,5) to (4,4) on turn 27, then to (4,3) on turn 28.\n\n(4,3) is body? On turn 27, if I move down to (4,4), eat food, then on turn 28, as before, I must go left to (3,4), not to (4,3).\n\nIf I don't eat at (4,4), but move directly down.\n\nBut from (4,5), if I move down to (4,4), and if there is food, I eat it, so I can't avoid eating if I move there, I think.\n\nThe food at (4,4) is there, so if I move to (4,4), I will eat it.\n\nIs there a way to not eat it? No, if head moves to food cell, it eats it.\n\nSo from (4,5), if I move down to (4,4), I eat the food, snake grows, and I cannot move down further because (4,3) is body.\n\nIf I could move down without eating, but I can't; the food is there, so moving to it eats it.\n\nPerhaps I can go around, but to reach (4,1), I need to go south.\n\nAnother path: for example, move left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then to (3,3) or (4,4), but (4,4) has food.\n\nBut from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), but (3,3) might be tail or something.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, so from (3,4) to (4,1) is not direct.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance.\n\n(4,5) to (4,1): distance 4 in y.\n\nWith 2 moves, I can only cover 2 cells, so at best on turn 28, I can be at (4,3) or something, but (4,3) is occupied by body.\n\nOn turn 27, positions: snake at (4,5), (5,5), etc, (4,3) is part of body.\n\n(4,3) is a body segment, so I cannot move to it unless it's the tail and I don't eat, but when I move, if I move to tail, it's ok, but in this case, tail is (3,3), not (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is not tail, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nSo from (4,5), I cannot move to (4,4) without eating and then being blocked, and I cannot move directly to (4,3) because it's body.\n\nOther directions: if I move left to (3,5), then on turn 28, I can move down to (3,4), then I'm at (3,4), and (4,1) is at (4,1), which is not adjacent, and after turn 28, it disappears, so I can't reach it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,6), then to (3,6) or (5,6), far from (4,1).\n\nSo it's impossible to eat the food at (4,1) because I can't reach it in time with the current position and obstacles.\n\nDistance: from (4,5) to (4,1) is 4 steps, but I have only 2 turns to act: on turn 27, I move to a cell, on turn 28 to another, so after turn 28, I am at a cell, and if that cell is (4,1), I eat it on turn 28.\n\nBut to be at (4,1) on turn 28, I need to move to it on turn 28 action.\n\nOn turn 28, where can I be?\n\nAfter turn 27 action, I am at some cell adjacent to (4,1) or not.\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,1): (4,2) up, (4,0) down but y=0 wall, so invalid; (3,1) left, (5,1) right.\n\n(4,0) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nSo only (4,2), (3,1), (5,1) are adjacent.\n\n(4,2) is above (4,1), (3,1) left, (5,1) right.\n\nNow, on turn 28, to eat at (4,1), I need to be at one of these on turn 28 start, and move to (4,1).\n\nBut on turn 28 start, after turn 27 action.\n\nWhere can I be after turn 27?\n\nFrom (4,5), after turn 27 move:\n\n- If move D to (4,4): then on turn 28 start, at (4,4)\n\n- If move L to (3,5): at (3,5)\n\n- If move U to (4,6): at (4,6)\n\nNone of these are adjacent to (4,1) or its neighbors.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, cannot.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,4) or (3,6) or (2,5), not down to (4,1) directly.\n\nFrom (4,6), similarly, not close.\n\nThe closest I can be to (4,1) after turn 27 is, for example, if I move down to (4,4), but then (4,4) to (4,1) is 3 steps, and on turn 28 I can only move one step, not to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, from other positions, it's farther.\n\nSo indeed, I cannot reach (4,1) by turn 28; it's impossible given the distance and the body in the way. Therefore, I should give up on eating (4,1) and focus on other food and survival.\n\nSo (4,1) will disappear, and I can ignore it.\n\nNow, focus on (4,4) and (3,6).\n\n(4,4) is adjacent, I can eat it now.\n\n(3,6) is also accessible.\n\nBut eating (4,4) now might not be optimal because it forces me to go left and away from the center or other areas.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,6) first.\n\nLet's think about the grid and snake body.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the right and down, from (4,5) to (3,3), with a sort of loop.\n\nPositions: (4,5) head, then (5,5) east, (5,4) south, (6,4) east, (6,3) south, (5,3) west, (4,3) west, (3,3) west. So it's like a shape: from head left to body, then down, right, down, left, left, left.\n\nThe area around (4,4) has body at (5,4), (6,4), etc., but (4,4) is free, with food.\n\nIf I eat at (4,4), I grow, and I'm stuck moving left to (3,4), then I can go up to (3,5) or down to (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,5) which is near (3,6) food.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), from (3,5) I can go up to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (4,4) now, I can go directly to (3,6).\n\nFor example, on turn 27, move left to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 28, move up to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nThen I grow, and I'm at (3,6) with direction up.\n\nFrom there, I can explore other areas.\n\nThe food at (4,4) is still there, life span 5, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut after eating (3,6), I might be able to go to (4,4).\n\nLet's simulate both options.\n\nFirst option: turn 27, move D to (4,4), eat food. Then turn 28, must move L to (3,4). No eat. Then on turn 29, from (3,4), direction left, I can move U to (3,5), or D to (3,3), or L to (2,4).\n\n(3,6) food is at (3,6), so moving U to (3,5) on turn 29, then on turn 30, move U to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 30, life span of (3,6) is? At turn 27, life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 27: life span 7\n\nTurn 28: 6\n\nTurn 29: 5\n\nTurn 30: 4, so still there when I eat on turn 30.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) after turn 27 eaten, gone.\n\nBut I ate (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nNow, after turn 30, at (3,6), ate, so positions: let's track.\n\nTurn 27: move D to (4,4), eat, positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] 9 seg, tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 28: move L to (3,4), no eat, so positions: head (3,4), body [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3) since (3,3) removed.\n\nTail was (3,3), removed, new tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 29: from (3,4), move U to (3,5), no food at (3,5)? Food at (3,6), not here. So no eat, positions: head (3,5), body [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3)? Previous: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,5), head (3,5), body [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] and tail (5,3) removed? Positions: new head (3,5), then previous head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and (5,3) was tail, removed, so positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] tail (6,3)\n\nTurn 30: move U to (3,6), eat food, so snake grows, positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) and tail remains, so 9 segments? From 8, after grow to 9.\n\nBefore turn 30, 8 segments, after eating, 9 segments: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail (6,3)\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow, from here, I can move, but the body is around, so I need to find a safe path.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, death; D to (3,5) but body, collision; L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) should be empty.\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6, not border, no obstacle, not in positions, so ok.\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6, ok.\n\nSo can move L or R.\n\nBut R to (4,6) might be better to open space.\n\nThen later, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut there is no more food now, only what was eaten.\n\n(4,4) eaten, (3,6) eaten, (4,1) gone, so no food, I need to survive and wait for new food, but the game might spawn new food, but in this state, no other food, so I just need to avoid dying.\n\nBut in the long term, new food may appear, but for now, I have to move safely.\n\nBut let's see the second option.\n\nSecond option: on turn 27, move L to (3,5), no eat (no food there).\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] tail (3,3) removed? After move, no eat, so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nDirection left.\n\nThen turn 28: move U to (3,6), eat food at (3,6).\n\nPositions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and tail remains, so 9 segments: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow same as before, can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\n(3,5) is body, so cannot go down.\n\nU wall, D body.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nCompared to first option, I ate (3,6) on turn 28, and I didn't eat (4,4), so (4,4) is still there with life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 28, life span of (4,4): at turn 27, life span 5.\n\nTurn 27:5, turn 28:4 (after turn 27 action), turn 29:3, etc.\n\nSo on turn 28, after I ate (3,6), I am at (3,6), and (4,4) is at (4,4), which is not far.\n\nI can go to (4,4) from here.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), I can move R to (4,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move down to (4,5) or something.\n\nBut (4,5) might be body.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(4,5) is body, so from (4,6), if I go there, I can move D to (4,5) but body, cannot; or L to (3,6) but head, not; or R to (5,6), or U wall.\n\n(4,6) neighbors: (4,5) down, (4,7) up wall, (3,6) left, (5,6) right.\n\n(4,5) is body, so cannot move down; (3,6) is previous head, now body? Positions: after turn 28, head (3,6), body includes (3,5), (4,5), etc. (3,6) is head, so (4,5) is segment, occupied.\n\nSo from (4,6), if I move to it on turn 29, then from there, I can only move to (5,6) or (3,6) but (3,6) is not accessible directly; neighbors are (4,5) down body, (4,7) up wall, (3,6) left body (since (3,6) is previous head, now part of body after move), (5,6) right.\n\n(5,6) is empty, I assume.\n\nSo from (4,6), I can only move right to (5,6) if I go there.\n\nBut I want to go to (4,4).\n\nFrom (3,6), on turn 29, I can move right to (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 30, from (4,6), I can move down? (4,5) is body, cannot; so only right to (5,6).\n\nThen at (5,6), I can move down to (5,5) or up to (5,7) wall, left to (4,6) body, right to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is body? Positions: at turn 29, after move to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), body [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] tail (4,3)? Let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 28: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 29: move R to (4,6), no eat (no food at (4,6)), so positions: head (4,6), body [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] and tail (4,3) removed, so new tail (5,3)\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] tail (6,3)? Index: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) so tail (6,3)\n\nFrom (4,6), turn 30: move to (5,6)? (5,6) is not adjacent? Neighbors of (4,6): (4,5) down, (4,7) up wall, (3,6) left, (5,6) right.\n\n(4,5) down is body (segment), (3,6) left is body, so only (5,6) right is possible.\n\nMove R to (5,6).\n\nNo food, positions: head (5,6), body [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] tail (6,4) since (6,3) removed? Previous tail (6,3), removed, new tail (5,4)? Positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) so tail (6,4)\n\nNow, (4,4) food is still there, but I'm at (5,6), far away, and I need to go to (4,4), but there is body in between.\n\nTo reach (4,4), I need to go down and left, but (5,5) is body, (4,5) is body, so I might be trapped or need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can move down to (5,5) but body, collision; or right to (6,6), or up wall, left to (4,6) body.\n\nOnly right to (6,6) possible.\n\nThen at (6,6), can move down to (6,5) or right to (7,6) wall, etc.\n\nBut (4,4) is getting left behind, and its life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 30, life span of (4,4): turn 27:5, 28:4, 29:3, 30:2, so after turn 30, life span 1, can be eaten on turn 31.\n\nBut I'm at (6,6) or something, hard to reach.\n\nIn the first option, when I ate (4,4) early, I also ate (3,6) later, and I was at (3,6) with more space.\n\nIn second option, I ate (3,6) but not (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nBut in second option, after turn 28, I am at (3,6) with direction up, and I can move left to (2,6) instead of right.\n\nThen I have more freedom to explore left side.\n\nFor example, turn 29: from (3,6) move L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 30: from (2,6) move down to (2,5) or left to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) is still there, I can go to it.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (4,4) is possible, but with body in the area.\n\nPositions at turn 28: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied, so to reach (4,4), I need to go to (4,4) from above or side, but (4,5) is body, so I cannot move directly to (4,4) from north; from east or west or south.\n\nSouth: (4,3) is body, so not.\n\nWest: (3,4) might be free, but not directly.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), if I move down, but (3,5) is body, cannot.\n\nOnly left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (2,6), then down to (2,5), then right to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, cannot.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move down to (2,4), then to (3,4), then to (4,4).\n\nBut (3,4) and (4,4) might be free.\n\nAt turn 28, positions: (3,6) head, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), etc.\n\n(3,4) not occupied, (4,4) not occupied.\n\nSo from (2,5), move to (2,4), then to (3,4), then to (4,4).\n\nBut each move takes a turn.\n\nOn turn 29, from (3,6) move L to (2,6).\n\nPositions: head (2,6), body [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] tail (4,3) removed? After no eat, tail (4,3) removed, new positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] tail (6,3)\n\nTurn 30: move D to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), body [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] tail (6,4) since (6,3) removed\n\nTurn 31: move D to (2,4), no food, positions: head (2,4), body [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] tail (6,4) removed, new tail (5,4)\n\nTurn 32: move R to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] tail (5,4) removed? Positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) so tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 33: move R to (4,4), eat food if still there.\n\nLife span of (4,4): turn 27:5, 28:4, 29:3, 30:2, 31:1, 32:0 gone? After turn 31, life span 1 for turn 31, can be eaten on turn 31. After turn 31, decreases to 0, gone on turn 32.\n\nAt turn 31, life span 1, can be eaten on turn 31 action.\n\nOn turn 31, I am at (2,4), and (4,4) is at (4,4), not adjacent; I move to (2,4) on turn 31, so not eating.\n\nOn turn 32, the food is gone, since after turn 31, life span 0.\n\nSo I cannot eat (4,4) in this path.\n\nIf I go directly, but I was at (2,4) on turn 31, and (4,4) is two steps away, but on turn 32 it's gone.\n\nSo I miss (4,4) as well.\n\nIn the first option where I ate (4,4) early, I also ate (3,6) later, so I have two foods.\n\nIn the second option, I ate (3,6) but not (4,4), and I couldn't eat it later, so I only have one food.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (4,4) now on turn 27.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I grow, which might be good for score, but I need to survive.\n\nIn the first path, after eating both, I can move to open space.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) after eating (3,6) on turn 30, I can move left to (2,6) or right to (4,6).\n\nMoving left to (2,6) might be safer, as the right side has more body.\n\nGrid: left side x=2, y=6 is free, and down to y=0, but walls.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant immediately.\n\nSo I think eating (4,4) on turn 27 is better.\n\nBut what about the tail reward danger? Not applicable here.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no such issue.\n\nSo for turn 27, I should move down to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 28, move left to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,4) I can move up to (3,5) to approach (3,6).\n\nThen turn 30, move up to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 27.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAfter turn 30, I am at (3,6), ate (3,6), and I need to move.\n\nFrom (3,6), as before, I can move left to (2,6) or right to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) might lead to more space.\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nAfter turn 30, positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail (6,3)\n\nFrom (3,6), move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is empty, and from there, I can move down, but (4,5) is body, so only right to (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, if move left to (2,6), then I can move down to (2,5), etc.\n\nMoving left might be better to explore new area.\n\nFor example, turn 31: move L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 32: move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 33: move D to (2,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut no more food, so I just need to survive.\n\nSince the grid has walls, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor instance, in the bottom left, there might be space.\n\nBut with the snake body, the area around (3,3) to (6,4) is occupied, but left side is free.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nAt x=1,2, y various, might be free.\n\nSimilarly, top right.\n\nBut I should choose a path that keeps options open.\n\nFor now, since I need to output actions, I can plan the first few moves.\n\nBack to turn 27.\n\nSo action turn 27: D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 28: L to (3,4) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), or D to (3,3), or L to (2,4)\n\nTo go to (3,6), I should move U to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 30: U to (3,6) eat.\n\nAfter that, on turn 31, from (3,6) move L to (2,6) for example.\n\nThen turn 32, move D to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nSince the food at (3,6) has long life, I could delay eating it, but in the first option I eat it on turn 30, which is fine.\n\nI could not eat (4,4) now and go directly to (3,6).\n\nFor example, turn 27: L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 28: U to (3,6) eat\n\nThen at (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) on turn 29\n\nThen from there, I can go down or something, and (4,4) is still there, but as before, I may not reach it in time.\n\nLife span: (4,4) life span 5 at turn 27.\n\nAfter turn 27, if I move L to (3,5), not eat (4,4), then on turn 28, I eat (3,6), so (4,4) not eaten.\n\nAfter turn 28, life span of (4,4): turn 27:5, after turn 27 action:4 for turn 28, after turn 28 action:3 for turn 29.\n\nSo on turn 29, life span 3.\n\nI am at (3,6) after turn 28.\n\nOn turn 29, I move L to (2,6), for example.\n\nThen on turn 30, I move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31, D to (2,4)\n\nThen on turn 31, at (2,4), I can move R to (3,4), then turn 32 to (4,4), but on turn 32, food may be gone.\n\nLife span: turn 29:3, turn 30:2, turn 31:1, turn 32:0 gone.\n\nOn turn 31, life span 1, can be eaten on turn 31.\n\nBut on turn 31, I am at (2,4), and (4,4) is at (4,4), not adjacent; I need to be at (4,4) or adjacent to move to it.\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (4,4), I need two moves: e.g., to (3,4) then to (4,4).\n\nBut on turn 31, I move to (2,4), not eating.\n\nThen on turn 32, I move to (3,4), but on turn 32, the food is gone (after turn 31, life span 0), so I can't eat it.\n\nIf on turn 31, I move directly, but I can't.\n\nSo impossible to eat (4,4) if I don't eat it early.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) I can eat later.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 27: D (down) to (4,4), eat food.\n\nTurn 28: L (left) to (3,4), only choice.\n\nTurn 29: U (up) to (3,5), to approach (3,6)\n\nTurn 30: U (up) to (3,6), eat food.\n\nNow, for turn 31, from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) to explore left.\n\nOr R to (4,6).\n\nSince the body is on the right, moving left is safer to avoid boxing in.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 32: from (2,6), direction left? After moving to (3,6) on turn 30, direction up, then move left, so direction left.\n\nFrom (2,6), can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U wall, R to (3,6) body.\n\nSo L or D.\n\nMove D to (2,5) to go down.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output at least from turn 27 to turn 31 or so.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, from turn 27 to 32.\n\nBut I can stop when I have a safe path.\n\nNow, for the special case: tail reward danger not an issue.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), but not in the way now.\n\nSo I think the plan is solid.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nThen turn 31: L (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 32: D (to (2,5))\n\nBut turn 32 is beyond 5 turns, but I can include.\n\nSince no food, it's fine.\n\nTo maximize score, after eating both foods, I should survive, and new food may spawn.\n\nBut for output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAnswer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nSo for now, from turn 27 to 31.\n\nBut turn 27 to 31 is 5 actions: 27,28,29,30,31.\n\nTurn t to t+4 for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 27: action for turn 27\n\nTurn 28: action for turn 28\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 31 or 32.\n\nI think up to turn 31 is fine.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: L\n\nBut on turn 31, moving to (2,6) from (3,6), which is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: after turn 30, at (3,6), I moved U twice, so direction up, then move left, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the accessible positive food efficiently and avoiding collisions. Given the current state at turn 27, the snake is at (4,5) with direction left, and the food at (4,1) cannot be reached before it disappears after turn 28 due to distance and body obstacles. Thus, the focus is on eating the food at (4,4) immediately and then the food at (3,6) shortly after, ensuring the snake grows safely. The plan extends 5 turns ahead (turns 27 to 31) to secure both food items and position the snake for survival.\n\n### Analysis of Key Risks and Opportunities:\n- **Food at (4,4)**: Life span 5, so it can be eaten on turn 27 for +1 score and growth. Eating it now is optimal as it avoids missing it later and provides immediate growth, but it forces a left move to (3,4) on turn 28 to avoid body collision.\n- **Food at (3,6)**: Life span 8, so it can be eaten by turn 30 safely. Moving toward it after turn 28 allows eating on turn 30.\n- **Body and Wall Collisions**: The snake must avoid moving into walls (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles (e.g., (5,2)). After eating at (4,4), the snake is constrained to move left on turn 28, but subsequent moves to (3,5) and (3,6) are safe. After turn 30, moving left to (2,6) explores open space and avoids the body-dense right side.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not a concern, as the tail is at (3,3) initially and not adjacent to the head during the plan.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating both foods, moving left to (2,6) on turn 31 opens less-occupied areas (left side of grid) for future movement and potential new food spawns.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 27 to 31):\n- **Turn 27 (current)**: Move down (D) to (4,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 9). This is safe and leverages the immediate opportunity.\n- **Turn 28**: Move left (L) to (3,4). This is the only safe move, as moving down or up would cause body collision or is invalid due to direction constraints.\n- **Turn 29**: Move up (U) to (3,5) to approach (3,6). This move is safe and sets up for eating the next food.\n- **Turn 30**: Move up (U) to (3,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 10). This completes the food collection within the 5-turn horizon.\n- **Turn 31**: Move left (L) to (2,6) to explore safer, less-occupied territory (left side of grid) and avoid potential traps near the body. This maintains options for future turns.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- **Score Increase**: +2 (from two foods eaten).\n- **Snake Growth**: Length increases from 8 to 10 segments.\n- **Survival**: The path avoids all collisions and walls, with the snake positioned in open space by turn 31 for continued survival.\n- **Beyond Turn 31**: New actions can be planned based on food spawns, but moving down or left from (2,6) (e.g., to (2,5)) would be safe default moves to maintain space.\n\nThis plan prioritizes eating available food while ensuring the snake does not get trapped, adhering to movement constraints and leveraging the grid layout for long-term play.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: D (down)  \nTurn 28: L (left)  \nTurn 29: U (up)  \nTurn 30: U (up)  \nTurn 31: L (left)  \n}",

The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Since borders are walls, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake can only be in (1,1) to (6,6). Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: head is at (4,4), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 6: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 8: (3,3)\n\nSo the snake has 9 segments? Positions are given as a list: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]. That's 9 positions, so length 9.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning down, so it was moving down to (4,4) from previous? Head is at (4,4), direction is D, down, so it came from above? Let's think carefully.\n\nThe positions are given head first: (4,4) is head, then (4,5) is the next segment, which is above (4,4) since y increases up? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is top or bottom? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards? But let's see the directions.\n\nU: (x, y+1) — if y+1 is up, that means y=0 is bottom? But in computer graphics, often y=0 is top, but here U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 is up, y=0 might be bottom. But the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. I need to assume a coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such problems, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But the direction U: (x,y+1) — if we think of y increasing upwards, then (x,y+1) is up. Similarly, D: (x,y-1) is down. So probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n\nBut in the snake positions, head at (4,4), and segment at (4,5), which has higher y, so if y increases up, (4,5) is above (4,4). But head direction is D, down, meaning it was moving down to (4,4). So if it was moving down to (4,4), that means it came from a cell with higher y, like (4,5)? (4,5) is the first body segment, which is where the head was before.\n\nLet's clarify the movement. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment follows the previous one.\n\nAt turn 28, snake positions: head at (4,4), with direction D, meaning that on turn 27, the head was at (4,5) and moved down to (4,4), since D: (x,y-1) from (4,5) to (4,4)? D: (x,y-1), so from (x,y) to (x,y-1) is down.\n\nIf head was at (4,5) at turn 27, and moved down to (4,4) at turn 28, then the direction is D, down.\n\nBut in the positions, (4,5) is listed as the first body segment, which makes sense; it's where the head was.\n\nSimilarly, the tail is at (3,3).\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 7? The format is (x, y, life_span, value), I think.\n\nIt says: (4, 1, 1, 1) — probably (x,y, life_span, value)\n\nSimilarly, (3, 6, 7, 1) and (4, 5, 10, 1)\n\nSo:\n\n- Food at (4,1): value +1, life span 1 turn left\n\n- Food at (3,6): value +1, life span 7 turns left\n\n- Food at (4,5): value +1, life span 10 turns left\n\n(4,5) is a food position? But (4,5) is also a snake body segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, (4,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake's body, so it can't be eaten immediately; only when the snake moves such that the body leaves that cell and later the head moves onto it.\n\nBut life span is 10, so it has time.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid.\n\ny=6: top\ny=0: bottom\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut since playable is x=1-6, y=1-6.\n\nList cells:\n\nFor y=6 to y=1, but y=6 is top, y=1 bottom? Since U is (x,y+1) up, D (x,y-1) down.\n\nAssume (0,0) bottom-left, so y increases up, x increases right.\n\nSo (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n\nBut walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable: (1,1) to (6,6).\n\n(1,1) bottom-left, (1,6) top-left, (6,1) bottom-right, (6,6) top-right.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) blocked.\n\nNow snake:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nBody: (4,5) - above head? (4,5) has y=5, which is higher, so up from (4,4).\n\n(4,4) y=4, (4,5) y=5, so (4,5) is north of (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is east of (4,5)? (4,5) to (5,5) is +x, so east.\n\nThen (5,5) to (5,4) is -y, south.\n\n(5,4) to (6,4) +x east.\n\n(6,4) to (6,3) -y south.\n\n(6,3) to (5,3) -x west.\n\n(5,3) to (4,3) -x west.\n\n(4,3) to (3,3) -x west.\n\nSo tail at (3,3).\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,1): x=4,y=1, which is south of head? (4,4) to (4,1) is down, y=1 is low.\n\n- (3,6): x=3,y=6, which is northwest? (3,6) y=6 high.\n\n- (4,5): but (4,5) is occupied by snake body.\n\nHead direction is D, down, so from turn 27, head was at (4,5) and moved down to (4,4) at turn 28.\n\nNow, for turn 28, I need to choose action: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction is current head direction, which is D.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is D (down), so cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4): cannot go up (reverse), so can go D, L, or R.\n\nD: (4,4) to (4,3)? (4,4) down is (4,3)? D: (x,y-1) so from (4,4) to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (4,3) is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3)\n\n(4,3) is position 7, which is a body segment, not the tail.\n\nTail is at (3,3).\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), that would be collision with body, since (4,3) is occupied and not the tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves, so I need to see if the cell is free after movement.\n\nIn Snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail end is removed, so only if the new head position collides with a body segment that will not be the tail, it dies.\n\nSpecifically, collision if head moves to a cell occupied by the body except the tail, because after move, the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move down to (4,3), (4,3) is currently occupied by a body segment, but after movement, the tail will move, so (4,3) might be free or not.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: head at (4,4), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nIf I move down to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\nBut (4,3) is currently occupied by the 7th segment. After head moves to (4,3), the body segments shift: the first body segment (4,5) becomes the new position after head? Standard Snake: when head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo after moving head to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- Then the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where the head was, (4,4)\n\n- Segment at (5,5) moves to (4,5)\n\n- Segment at (5,4) moves to (5,5)\n\n- Segment at (6,4) moves to (5,4)\n\n- Segment at (6,3) moves to (6,4)\n\n- Segment at (5,3) moves to (6,3)\n\n- Segment at (4,3) moves to (5,3)? But (4,3) was the position, now head is there, so the segment that was at (4,3) needs to move.\n\nThe positions are a list: let's index them: S0 = head (4,4), S1 = (4,5), S2 = (5,5), S3 = (5,4), S4 = (6,4), S5 = (6,3), S6 = (5,3), S7 = (4,3), S8 = (3,3)\n\nAfter moving down, new head at (4,3) = new S0.\n\nThen S1 new position is old S0 position, (4,4)\n\nS2 new position is old S1 position, (4,5)\n\nS3 new position is old S2 position, (5,5)\n\nS4 new position is old S3 position, (5,4)\n\nS5 new position is old S4 position, (6,4)\n\nS6 new position is old S5 position, (6,3)\n\nS7 new position is old S6 position, (5,3)\n\nS8 new position is old S7 position, (4,3)\n\nBut new head is at (4,3), and S8 is moving to (4,3), but that's the same cell? Conflict.\n\nThe new head is at (4,3), and the segment that was S7 is now moving to where? In the shift, S8 (tail) moves to the old position of S7, which is (4,3).\n\nBut new head is also at (4,3), so the head and S8 are both at (4,3) after move, which means collision.\n\nBecause the cell is occupied by two parts.\n\nMoreover, (4,3) was previously occupied, but after move, head and the moving tail are at same cell only if the head moves to the tail's current position before move.\n\nHere, before move, S8 (tail) is at (3,3), and head is moving to (4,3), which is not the tail position. (4,3) is S7 position.\n\nAfter move, new head at (4,3), and S8 moves to old S7 position, (4,3), so both at (4,3), collision.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,3) is invalid, as it causes collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,4): (3,4) is not in current positions, but let's see what is there.\n\nCurrent positions: (3,3) is tail, (4,4) head, (4,3) body, etc. (3,4) is not occupied? Let's list all occupied cells:\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (3,4) is free? x=3,y=4.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is occupied? (5,4) is S3.\n\n(3,4) not in list, so free.\n\nBut is it within bounds? x=3, y=4, both between 1 and 6, yes. And not wall, not obstacle.\n\nObstacle is (5,2), not (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, right to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by S3, so moving to (5,4) would be collision.\n\nD to (4,3): collision as above.\n\nU to (4,5): but U is reverse of current direction D, and no instant reverse, so cannot move up.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so cannot move opposite, U.\n\nSo possible moves: L, R, or D? But D to (4,3) is collision, so not possible.\n\nL: left to (3,4)\n\nR: right to (5,4)\n\nBut (5,4) is occupied, so moving to (5,4) would be similar issue.\n\nIf move to (5,4):\n\nNew head at (5,4)\n\nThen S1 to old S0 (4,4)\n\nS2 to old S1 (4,5)\n\nS3 to old S2 (5,5)\n\nS4 to old S3 (5,4) — but (5,4) is new head position, so S4 moving to (5,4), which is occupied by head, collision.\n\nSpecifically, S4 new position is old S3 position, which is (5,4), same as new head, so collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is left to (3,4), which is free.\n\n(3,4) not in current positions, and not wall, not obstacle.\n\nSo for turn 28, I must move L to (3,4).\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, moving left, so new direction will be L.\n\nAlso, no food at (3,4), so no eating, just move.\n\nThen the snake will grow only if it eats food.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, after moving to (3,4), new positions:\n\nHead at (3,4)\n\nThen body: S1 at (4,4) — old head position\n\nS2 at (4,5) — old S1\n\nS3 at (5,5) — old S2\n\nS4 at (5,4) — old S3\n\nS5 at (6,4) — old S4\n\nS6 at (6,3) — old S5\n\nS7 at (5,3) — old S6\n\nS8 at (4,3) — old S7? Old S7 was (4,3), but S8 moves to old S7 position.\n\nList:\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nS1: old S0 = (4,4)\n\nS2: old S1 = (4,5)\n\nS3: old S2 = (5,5)\n\nS4: old S3 = (5,4)\n\nS5: old S4 = (6,4)\n\nS6: old S5 = (6,3)\n\nS7: old S6 = (5,3)\n\nS8: old S7 = (4,3)\n\nBut old S7 was (4,3), so S8 at (4,3)\n\nThe tail was at (3,3), which is now gone, since we didn't eat, so snake length same, tail moved from (3,3) to (4,3)? In the shift, S8 is the new tail at (4,3).\n\nPositions: new list: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo tail at (4,3).\n\nNow, at turn 29, head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: cannot reverse right, so can go U, D, L.\n\nU: (3,5)\n\nD: (3,3)\n\nL: (2,4)\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(3,5): is it occupied? Current positions: (3,4) head, (4,4), (4,5), etc. (3,5) not in list, so free.\n\n(3,3): currently (4,3) is body, (3,3) was tail but now free? Before move, (3,3) was tail, after move, it's not occupied, so (3,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): free.\n\nAlso, walls: x=2, y=4, within 1-6, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,2) not relevant.\n\nSo all three possible.\n\nNow, food: we have food at (4,1), (3,6), and (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by body, can't eat yet.\n\n(4,1): value +1, life span 1, so it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 28, food at (4,1) has life span 1, meaning after turn 28, it might disappear? Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn.\n\nAt state turn 28, life span 1, so it will disappear after turn 28 if not eaten. Since it decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 28, if not eaten, after turn 28, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood (4,1): life span 1, so only available on turn 28, but we are at turn 28, and we are choosing action for turn 28.\n\nBut on turn 28, we are moving to (3,4), not to (4,1), so we don't eat it. Then after turn 28, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life span 7, so 7 turns including turn 28? Countdown decreases every turn, starting from current.\n\nAt turn 28, life span 7, meaning it has 7 turns left, including turn 28. So after 7 turns, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 28 to turn 34? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: available for N turns, from turn t to t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1.\n\nFor example, if life span 1 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and disappears after turn t.\n\nIf life span 2, available on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, here at turn 28:\n\n- (4,1): life span 1, so only on turn 28, but we didn't eat it, so it disappears.\n\n- (3,6): life span 7, so available from turn 28 to 34, disappears after turn 34.\n\n- (4,5): life span 10, available from turn 28 to 37, disappears after turn 37.\n\nBut (4,5) is currently under snake body, so can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nAt turn 28, we must move L to (3,4) as only option.\n\nThen turn 29, head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (3,5), D (3,3), L (2,4)\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to eat food and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, food at (4,1) is gone, since not eaten on turn 28.\n\nFood at (3,6) is at (3,6), which is north of current head? Head at (3,4), (3,6) is up, y=6.\n\nBut to reach (3,6) from (3,4), need to go up twice, but there might be obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,5) is at (4,5), which is currently occupied, but if the snake moves, it might become accessible.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with (4,5) because of tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut not immediate.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid state.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, minus obstacle (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies 9 cells.\n\nFree cells: total cells: 6x6 = 36, minus 1 obstacle, so 35 cells, snake 9, so 26 free, but some have food.\n\nFood at (3,6) and (4,5) but (4,5) occupied.\n\n(4,5) is occupied, so food there is not accessible yet.\n\nNow for turn 29, from (3,4), I can go U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,5), then I'm closer to (3,6) food.\n\nIf I go L to (2,4), I go west.\n\nIf I go D to (3,3), down.\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 9 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nBut there are areas to move.\n\nAnother thing: after moving to (3,4), the cell (4,5) might become free if the snake moves away.\n\nCurrently, at turn 28 after move, positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied by S2.\n\nIf the snake moves, (4,5) could be vacated.\n\nFor example, if on turn 29, from (3,4) I move U to (3,5), then new head (3,5), S1 to (3,4), S2 to (4,4), S3 to (4,5), etc., so (4,5) is still occupied by S3 now? Let's not simulate yet.\n\nI should plan a path to the foods.\n\nFirst, food at (3,6): it's at (3,6), which is on the top row, y=6.\n\nHead at (3,4), so I can go directly up: U to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nBut when I move to (3,6), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,5): but it's currently occupied, so I need to have the snake move such that (4,5) is vacated and then head moves there.\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied, but in the positions above, at turn 28 after move, (4,5) is a body segment.\n\nIf I can make the snake move so that (4,5) is left and then head can go there.\n\nBut (4,5) has food, so if I eat it, I grow.\n\nBut there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut not necessarily the case now.\n\nLet's think for turn 29.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move U to (3,5) at turn 29.\n\nThen from there, on turn 30, I can move U to (3,6) to eat food, since (3,6) has food.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible.\n\nAt turn 29, if I move U from (3,4) to (3,5):\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nS1: old head (3,4)\n\nS2: old S1 (4,4)\n\nS3: old S2 (4,5)\n\nS4: old S3 (5,5)\n\nS5: old S4 (5,4)\n\nS6: old S5 (6,4)\n\nS7: old S6 (6,3)\n\nS8: old S7 (5,3)  // tail at (5,3)\n\nPositions: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nFood at (3,6) is free, so on turn 30, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nDirection from (3,5) moving U, so direction U.\n\nMove to (3,6): eat food, so snake grows: new head at (3,6), and the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (3,6), then S1 (3,5), S2 (3,4), S3 (4,4), S4 (4,5), S5 (5,5), S6 (5,4), S7 (6,4), S8 (6,3), and add new segment, so tail still at (6,3)? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old S8.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to (3,6), body segments: S1 to old head (3,5), S2 to old S1 (3,4), S3 to old S2 (4,4), S4 to old S3 (4,5), S5 to old S4 (5,5), S6 to old S5 (5,4), S7 to old S6 (6,4), S8 to old S7 (6,3), and since ate, add a new segment at the position where tail was, but tail was at (5,3)? Before move on turn 30, positions at turn 29: head (3,5), S1 (3,4), S2 (4,4), S3 (4,5), S4 (5,5), S5 (5,4), S6 (6,4), S7 (6,3), S8 (5,3)\n\nS8 is tail at (5,3).\n\nOn turn 30, move U to (3,6): eat food at (3,6), so new head (3,6), then S1 to old head (3,5), S2 to old S1 (3,4), S3 to old S2 (4,4), S4 to old S3 (4,5), S5 to old S4 (5,5), S6 to old S5 (5,4), S7 to old S6 (6,4), S8 to old S7 (6,3), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position, so new S9 at (5,3)? The new segment is added where the tail was before move, so at (5,3), and it becomes the new tail.\n\nSo positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and (5,3) new tail.\n\nLength 10 now.\n\nThen direction U.\n\nNow, from (3,6), possible moves: U, L, R, but y=6, U would be (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. Also, D down to (3,5), but current direction U, so D is reverse, cannot. So can only go L or R.\n\nL to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) should be free? Let's see current positions: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(2,6) not occupied, (4,6) not occupied.\n\ny=6 is top, but x=2 and x=4 are within 1-6, so free.\n\nSo can go left or right.\n\nBut we have another food at (4,5), which is occupied, but has food under it.\n\n(4,5) is occupied by S4 in this state? Positions have (4,5) as a body segment.\n\nTo eat that food, we need to vacate (4,5) and then move head there.\n\nBut it has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBack to turn 29 choices.\n\nIf on turn 29 I go U to (3,5), then turn 30 go U to (3,6) eat, as above.\n\nThat seems straightforward and I get +1 score.\n\nIf I go other ways, I might not get that food soon.\n\nBut (3,6) has life span 7, so I can eat it later, but since I'm close, it's good to eat now.\n\nAnother option: go directly to (4,5) food, but it's occupied.\n\nFor example, if on turn 29 I go D to (3,3).\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible actions for turn 29.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction L.\n\nMove U to (3,5): as above.\n\nMove D to (3,3): (3,3) is free? After turn 28 move, positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(3,3) not occupied, free.\n\nMove to (3,3): no food, so just move.\n\nNew head (3,3), S1 to (3,4), S2 to (4,4), S3 to (4,5), S4 to (5,5), S5 to (5,4), S6 to (6,4), S7 to (6,3), S8 to (5,3) // tail at (5,3)\n\nPositions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: cannot U (reverse), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,2): y=2, within 1-6, free?\n\n(3,2) not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, obstacle at (5,2), not (3,2).\n\nL to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is occupied? Current positions have (4,3)? In the list above, (4,3) is not there; tail at (5,3), etc. (4,3) free? Let's see: positions (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) — no (4,3), so free.\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nSo all possible, but no food at (3,2), etc.\n\nThis might not be productive.\n\nMove L to (2,4) at turn 29.\n\nFrom (3,4) move L to (2,4): no food.\n\nNew head (2,4), S1 to (3,4), S2 to (4,4), S3 to (4,5), S4 to (5,5), S5 to (5,4), S6 to (6,4), S7 to (6,3), S8 to (5,3) // tail at (5,3)\n\nPositions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThen from (2,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (2,5), D (2,3), L (1,4)\n\nAll should be free, no food.\n\nThen I can go to (3,6) later, but it's farther.\n\nSo the best immediate gain is to go U on turn 29 to (3,5), then U on turn 30 to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAfter eating at (3,6), head at (3,6), as above, and I can only go L or R, since U is wall, D is reverse.\n\nSay I go R to (4,6) on turn 31.\n\n(4,6) should be free.\n\nMove to (4,6): no food, so just move.\n\nNew head (4,6), S1 to old head (3,6), S2 to (3,5), S3 to (3,4), S4 to (4,4), S5 to (4,5), S6 to (5,5), S7 to (5,4), S8 to (6,4), S9 to (6,3) // tail at (6,3)? After eating at turn 30, positions: head (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nS9 is (5,3)\n\nOn turn 31, move R to (4,6): no food, so move.\n\nNew head (4,6), S1 to (3,6), S2 to (3,5), S3 to (3,4), S4 to (4,4), S5 to (4,5), S6 to (5,5), S7 to (5,4), S8 to (6,4), S9 to (6,3) // tail moves to old S8 position? S9 moves to old S8 position.\n\nOld S8 was (6,3), so S9 to (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied? New head at (4,6), S1 to (3,6), S2 to (3,5), etc., S8 to (6,4)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move: head (4,6), S1: old head (3,6), S2: old S1 (3,5), S3: old S2 (3,4), S4: old S3 (4,4), S5: old S4 (4,5), S6: old S5 (5,5), S7: old S6 (5,4), S8: old S7 (6,4), S9: old S8 (6,3) // and since no eat, tail was (5,3) but moved, so positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nFrom (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can go to eat the food at (4,5), but (4,5) is currently occupied by S5.\n\n(4,5) has food under it, but it's occupied, so I need to vacate it.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (4,5) from (4,6), but (4,5) is occupied, so collision.\n\nI need to move such that (4,5) is vacated first.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is S5, which is part of the body.\n\nIf I move in a way that the snake moves away from (4,5), it might be vacated.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), I could go down to (4,5), but occupied, invalid.\n\nGo left to (3,6), but (3,6) is occupied by S1.\n\nGo right to (5,6), which might be free.\n\n(5,6) not occupied, so move to (5,6).\n\nThen new positions, etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nTo vacate (4,5), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (4,5) moves and no other segment is there.\n\nIn the current chain, (4,5) is between (4,6) and (4,4) or something.\n\nIn positions: after turn 31, head at (4,6), S1 (3,6), S2 (3,5), S3 (3,4), S4 (4,4), S5 (4,5), S6 (5,5), S7 (5,4), S8 (6,4), S9 (6,3)\n\nS5 at (4,5)\n\nIf I move from (4,6) to, say, (5,6) on turn 31.\n\nMove R to (5,6): no food.\n\nNew head (5,6), S1 to (4,6), S2 to (3,6), S3 to (3,5), S4 to (3,4), S5 to (4,4), S6 to (4,5), S7 to (5,5), S8 to (5,4), S9 to (6,4) // tail at (6,4)\n\nS6 is now at (4,5), still occupied.\n\nNot vacated.\n\nIf I move down from (4,6) to (4,5), but occupied, invalid.\n\nSo I need to move in a different way earlier.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I should not go to (3,6) immediately.\n\nAnother idea: go for the (4,5) food first, but it's occupied.\n\nAt turn 29, from (3,4), instead of U, I could go to a position to vacate (4,5).\n\nFor example, if I move D to (3,3) on turn 29.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to other places.\n\nBut (3,6) food might be missed if I don't go soon, but it has 7 turns, so time.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 28, so available until turn 34, so I have until turn 34 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has life 10, until turn 37.\n\nBut (4,1) is gone.\n\nNow, the tail reward danger: for (4,5) food, if when I eat it, the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, but the food is at (4,5), so if I eat it, the tail cell might not have food.\n\nThe danger is if the tail cell has food, not the food being eaten.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it's about the cell where the tail is, having food, and head adjacent, then if you eat that food, when you grow, the new tail is at the same position, causing collision.\n\nBut for (4,5), it's not the tail cell.\n\nCurrently tail is at (4,3) after turn 28, but it moves.\n\nSo probably not immediate concern.\n\nBack to turn 29 decision.\n\nIf I go U to (3,5) on turn 29, then U to (3,6) on turn 30 to eat, I get +1 soon.\n\nThen from (3,6), I need to go to other areas.\n\nI could go for (4,5) food.\n\nBut to eat (4,5), I need it vacated.\n\nAt turn 28 after move, (4,5) is occupied by S2.\n\nIf on turn 29, I move from (3,4) to a direction that pulls the snake away.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (2,4), then the body might move.\n\nAfter move to (2,4), positions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nThen if I move from (2,4) to, say, (2,5) U, then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), etc., still (4,5) occupied.\n\nIt will take time to vacate.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the available food at (3,6) first.\n\nMoreover, if I don't go up, someone else might, but it's single player, I think, just me.\n\nThe AI is playing alone, so no competition.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner is better, as I can eat more later.\n\nBut also, survival is key.\n\nNow, after eating at (3,6), the snake is at top-left, and I can move to the right or down.\n\nThe food at (4,5) is at (4,5), which is below.\n\nI can plan to go down after eating.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), after eating, on turn 31, I can move R to (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 32, from (4,6), I can move D to (4,5)? But (4,5) has food and is occupied? At that time, positions: after turn 30 eat at (3,6), positions as before: head (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(4,5) is occupied by S5.\n\nOn turn 31, if I move R to (4,6), positions become: head (4,6), S1 (3,6), S2 (3,5), S3 (3,4), S4 (4,4), S5 (4,5), S6 (5,5), S7 (5,4), S8 (6,4), S9 (6,3)  // S5 at (4,5)\n\nOn turn 32, from (4,6), I can move D to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by S5, so collision.\n\nMove L to (3,6), occupied by S1.\n\nMove R to (5,6), free, say.\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), S1 (4,6), S2 (3,6), S3 (3,5), S4 (3,4), S5 (4,4), S6 (4,5), S7 (5,5), S8 (5,4), S9 (6,4)  // S6 at (4,5)\n\nStill occupied.\n\nTo vacate (4,5), I need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (4,5) moves and the cell is empty for the head to move in later.\n\nFor example, if I can make the snake go down or left, (4,5) might be vacated.\n\nBut it's the 5th segment, so it takes time.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) has long life, I can leave it for later and focus on other areas.\n\nThere is also the bottom area.\n\nAnother food is gone, only two left.\n\n(3,6) and (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is under body.\n\nI should go to (3,6) now to eat it, then later come back for (4,5).\n\nFor turn 28, we have to move L to (3,4).\n\nThen for turn 29, I think moving U to (3,5) is best, to set up for eating (3,6) on turn 30.\n\nThen on turn 30, move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turns after that, I need to plan.\n\nBut the answer should include actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=28.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, and possibly more.\n\nFor turn 28: only possible action is L to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,4), I plan to move U to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 30: from (3,5), move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 31: from (3,6), I need to move, say R to (4,6) or L to (2,6).\n\nLet's choose R to (4,6) for now.\n\nThen turn 32: from (4,6), I can move, say, D to (4,5) but occupied, so not possible. Or U, but y=6 top, U invalid. Or L to (3,6), occupied, or R to (5,6).\n\nSo move R to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the (4,5) food.\n\nPerhaps after eating at (3,6), I can move in a way to vacate (4,5).\n\nFor example, from (3,6), instead of R, I can move L to (2,6) on turn 31.\n\nThen positions: head (2,6), S1 (3,6), S2 (3,5), S3 (3,4), S4 (4,4), S5 (4,5), S6 (5,5), S7 (5,4), S8 (6,4), S9 (6,3)\n\nS5 at (4,5)\n\nThen on turn 32, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5), or L to (1,6), or U invalid.\n\nSay move D to (2,5).\n\nNew head (2,5), S1 to (2,6), S2 to (3,6), S3 to (3,5), S4 to (3,4), S5 to (4,4), S6 to (4,5), S7 to (5,5), S8 to (5,4), S9 to (6,4)\n\nS6 at (4,5)\n\nStill occupied.\n\nIt will take several moves for (4,5) to be vacated.\n\nThe segment at (4,5) will move when the snake moves, so after a few moves, it might be at a different position.\n\nFor example, after a few turns, the body moves, and (4,5) could be free.\n\nSince life span is long, I can eat it later.\n\nFor now, I'll go with the plan to eat (3,6) on turn 30.\n\nThen for the actions:\n\nTurn 28: L (since must)\n\nTurn 29: U (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 30: U (to (3,6) eat)\n\nThen for turn 31, from (3,6), I need to choose a move.\n\nPossible: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\nSay I go R to (4,6) to go towards the right side.\n\nThen turn 32, from (4,6), can go R to (5,6) or D to (4,5) but occupied, so go R to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go D to (5,5) or L to (4,6) occupied, or R to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) might be free.\n\nBut let's not plan too far, but for the answer, I need at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 28, so turns 28 to 32 or more.\n\nAlso, after turn 30, the snake is longer, 10 segments.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which might affect movement in bottom area.\n\nBut for now, I think the plan is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nThen for turn 31, I need to specify.\n\nSimilarly, turn 32.\n\nPerhaps I can add one more to show.\n\nTo be safe, from (3,6) turn 31, move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 32, from (4,6) move R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 33, from (5,6) move D to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 30 after eat, positions: head (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied by S6.\n\nAfter turn 31 move to (4,6): positions head (4,6), S1 (3,6), S2 (3,5), S3 (3,4), S4 (4,4), S5 (4,5), S6 (5,5), S7 (5,4), S8 (6,4), S9 (6,3)\n\nS6 at (5,5)\n\nAfter turn 32 move to (5,6): head (5,6), S1 (4,6), S2 (3,6), S3 (3,5), S4 (3,4), S5 (4,4), S6 (4,5), S7 (5,5), S8 (5,4), S9 (6,4)\n\nS7 at (5,5)\n\nOn turn 33 from (5,6) move D to (5,5): but (5,5) occupied by S7, so collision.\n\nInvalid.\n\nSo cannot move down.\n\nInstead, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) occupied, or R to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) should be free.\n\nMove R to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move D to (6,5) or L to (5,6) occupied, or R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo move D to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut we don't need to specify too far, but for the answer, I can put up to turn 32 or 33.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) is important, but for now, I'll proceed.\n\nPerhaps for turn 31, from (3,6) after eating, I can move L to (2,6) to go left.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nNow, for the tail position, when we might eat the (4,5) food, but not now.\n\nSo for the actions:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: R (to (4,6))\n\nThen turn 32: R (to (5,6))\n\nFor turn 32, from (4,6) to (5,6) is R, and direction was R, so ok.\n\nThen I can stop or add one more.\n\nBut to think 5 turns, from 28 to 32 is 5 actions: 28,29,30,31,32.\n\nt1=28, so turns 28,29,30,31,32.\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nI could include turn 33.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better immediate choice.\n\nAnother option: at turn 29, if I go to (3,5), but not go to (3,6) on turn 30, but go elsewhere, but that delays eating, not better.\n\nOr, I could go for the (4,5) food by moving differently.\n\nFor example, at turn 29, from (3,4), instead of U, move D to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to, say, (4,3) or something.\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 28 move, positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is occupied.\n\nIf move D to (3,3) on turn 29: new head (3,3), S1 (3,4), S2 (4,4), S3 (4,5), S4 (5,5), S5 (5,4), S6 (6,4), S7 (6,3), S8 (5,3) // tail at (5,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), direction D.\n\nCan move L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D to (3,2)\n\n(4,3) is occupied? Current positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) — (4,3) not there, so free? (4,3) was S8 before, but moved.\n\nIn new positions, S8 at (5,3), so (4,3) free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free, (3,2) free.\n\nSay move R to (4,3).\n\nBut no food.\n\nThen I am not closer to foods.\n\n(3,6) is far, (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the best is to go up to eat (3,6).\n\nSo I think the plan is good.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the format, for each turn, the action.\n\nCurrent turn t1=28.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nThen for turn 31, from (3,6), I said R, but to be precise, I need to specify.\n\nSince the direction after turn 30 is U, at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 31, possible moves: L or R, since U wall, D reverse.\n\nI choose R to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 32, from (4,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen possible moves: U invalid, D to (4,5) occupied, L to (3,6) occupied, R to (5,6) free, so move R to (5,6).\n\nThen that's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nI could add turn 33 if needed, but 5+ turns, 5 is minimum.\n\nIn the state, food at (4,5) is still there, but not eaten yet.\n\nBut for the plan, it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I can think of eating it later.\n\nFor example, after some moves, (4,5) might be vacated.\n\nBut in the short term, not.\n\nSo I think this is acceptable.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 28):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (4,4), with body segments at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Snake length is 9.\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,1): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 28 if not eaten).\n  - (3,6): Value +1, life span 7 (available until turn 34).\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 37, but currently under snake body at segment index 1; can only be eaten if vacated and head moves there).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls). Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Immediate Constraints**:\n  - Current head direction is D (down), so instant reverse to U (up) is forbidden.\n  - From head position (4,4), moving down (D) to (4,3) causes collision with body segment at (4,3) (not the tail).\n  - Moving right (R) to (5,4) causes collision with body segment at (5,4).\n  - Only safe move is left (L) to (3,4), which is free and within bounds.\n\n**Key Risks and Opportunities:**\n- **Food at (4,1)**: Life span 1, so it disappears after turn 28. Moving to (3,4) does not eat it, so it is lost. No benefit.\n- **Food at (3,6)**: High-value (+1), with 7 turns left. It is accessible via a direct path: from (3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6). Eating it on turn 30 maximizes immediate score and growth.\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Under the snake's body, so it cannot be eaten immediately. It has a long life span (10 turns), so it can be targeted later after vacating the cell. No tail reward danger is imminent (tail is not adjacent to head, and food is not on tail cell).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (3,6), the snake will be at (3,6) with length 10. Movement options are limited (only left or right due to wall and reverse constraints). Moving right (R) to (4,6) is safe and opens paths to explore the right side of the grid. Vacating (4,5) requires multiple moves, so it is deferred for later turns beyond the 5-turn horizon.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: Prioritize eating (3,6) for +1 score on turn 30, then navigate to avoid dead ends. The grid has 26 free cells (36 total playable minus 1 obstacle and 9 snake segments), so there is space to maneuver. Avoid the obstacle at (5,2) and walls.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 28 to 32):**\n- **Turn 28 (t1=28)**: Must move left (L) to (3,4) – only safe option. No food eaten.\n- **Turn 29 (t1+1=29)**: From (3,4), direction L. Move up (U) to (3,5) – positions for (3,6) food and avoids delays. No food at (3,5).\n- **Turn 30 (t1+2=30)**: From (3,5), direction U. Move up (U) to (3,6) – eat food (+1 score, snake grows to length 10). Head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 31 (t1+3=31)**: From (3,6), direction U. Cannot move up (wall) or down (reverse), so move right (R) to (4,6) – safe, no food, opens path to right side.\n- **Turn 32 (t1+4=32)**: From (4,6), direction R. Cannot move up (invalid), down (to (4,5) occupied), or left (to (3,6) occupied). Move right (R) to (5,6) – safe, no food.\n\n**Beyond Turn 32**: \n- From (5,6), options include moving down to (5,5) (if vacated) or right to (6,6). Focus on vacating (4,5) for later eating (e.g., by continuing east or south). Monitor life spans: (3,6) expires after turn 34, (4,5) after turn 37. Survival is prioritized; no risks in the 5-turn plan.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 28\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32\\text{: R} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls and obstacles. From the walls description, border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,4), and the body segments follow: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (3,4) from previous position.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- One at (3,6) with life span 7 and value +1 (since it says value1=1, so positive food)\n\n- Another at (4,5) with life span 9 and value +1? Wait, the format is (x,y, life_span, value), so (3,6,7,1) means x=3,y=6, life=7, value=1. Similarly, (4,5,9,1) is x=4,y=5, life=9, value=1. But (4,5) is also a body segment? Let me check the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nSo (4,5) is the third segment, index 2 if head is 0. So there is food at (4,5), which is occupied by the snake's body. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, there's a warning about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrent turn is 29.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: head at (3,4), direction left. So last move was left to (3,4), so previous head was at (4,4), I assume? Positions: head (3,4), then (4,4) which is the first body segment, so yes, it came from (4,4) to (3,4) by moving left.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,4): since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Reverse of L is R, so I cannot move right immediately, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so I cannot move R on the next turn.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L (since R is reverse and not allowed).\n\nNow, let's see the food:\n\n- Food at (3,6): (3,6) with life 7, value 1. This is above the head, since head is at (3,4), so (3,6) is up two cells? y=6 vs y=4, so north, up.\n\n- Food at (4,5): (4,5) with life 9, value 1. But (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake's body; it's the third segment.\n\nSince food is on a body segment, I can only eat it if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n\nBut (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (4,3), according to positions: last one is (4,3).\n\nSnake segments: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is segment 2, not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,3).\n\nNow, life spans: food at (3,6) has life 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn, so after turn 29, it will be there for 7 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 29, life_span=7, so it will disappear after turn 29+7-1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life_span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is present for N more turns? The countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, after turn t, L decreases to L-1. When L reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (3,6): at turn 29, life=7, so it will be there until turn 29 + 6? After turn 29, life becomes 6, then 5, ..., down to 0 after turn 35? Let's count:\n\nStart of turn 29: life=7\n\nAfter turn 29 (i.e., after we move), life decreases to 6.\n\nAfter turn 30, to 5, ..., after turn 35, to 0, so it disappears before turn 36? The food is present as long as life > 0.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, if life > 0, food is there. After the turn, life decreases.\n\nSo for (3,6), life=7 at turn 29, so:\n\n- Turn 29: food present, life=7\n\n- After turn 29, life=6\n\n- Turn 30: food present, life=6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 35: food present, life=1\n\n- After turn 35, life=0, so disappears before turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,5), life=9 at turn 29, so it will be there until after turn 37 or so? Life=9 at turn 29:\n\n- Turn 29: present, life=9\n\n- After turn 29: life=8\n\n- Turn 30: present, life=8\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 37: present, life=1\n\n- After turn 37: life=0, disappears before turn 38.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from it.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (3,4), and I need to choose a move for turn 29.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since R is reverse and not allowed).\n\nMove up to (3,5)\n\nMove down to (3,3)\n\nMove left to (2,4)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- Walls: (3,5) is within bounds, x=3 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7? y=5, grid y from 0 to 7, so y=5 is fine, not wall. Similarly, (3,3) y=3, fine. (2,4) x=2, not border.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\n- Body collision: moving to (3,5), is that occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). (3,5) is not in the list, so empty. Similarly, (3,3) not in list, (2,4) not in list. All safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (3,6) is above, and (4,5) is on the body.\n\nNow, the tail is at (4,3), and head is at (3,4), which is adjacent? (3,4) and (4,3) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (3,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. So no Tail Reward Danger here.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should consider eating food, but safely.\n\nFirst, let's see the path to food at (3,6). From head (3,4), I can go up to (3,5), then to (3,6) in two moves, but I need to make sure that when I arrive, it's safe.\n\nFood at (3,6) has life 7, so I have until turn 35 to eat it, but since I'm at turn 29, I can reach it in 2 moves: if I move up now to (3,5), then on turn 30 move up to (3,6), eating it.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nEating: if head moves to food cell, and it's positive food, length increases, so tail stays in place, and a new segment is added.\n\nIn this case, if I go to (3,6) on turn 30, I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (3,6), new head, and the previous tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and the snake extends.\n\nNow, is (3,6) safe? Currently, no body there, and it's not wall. After eating, the new tail position depends on the movement.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, for turn 29, if I move U to (3,5).\n\nThen after turn 29: head at (3,5), body: the previous head (3,4) becomes first body segment, so positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nStandard snake movement.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3) tail.\n\nIf I move head up to (3,5), then new head is (3,5). Then segment 1 moves to where head was, (3,4). Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (4,4). Segment 3 to (4,5)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: head: (3,5)\n\nThen body: segment 1 (now index 1) at previous head position (3,4)\n\nSegment 2 (index 2) at previous segment 1 position (4,4)\n\nSegment 3 (index 3) at previous segment 2 position (4,5)\n\nSegment 4 (index 4) at previous segment 3 position (5,5)\n\nSegment 5 (index 5) at previous segment 4 position (5,4)\n\nSegment 6 (index 6) at previous segment 5 position (6,4)\n\nSegment 7 (index 7) at previous segment 6 position (6,3)\n\nSegment 8 (index 8) at previous segment 7 position (5,3)\n\nAnd tail (index 8) is at (5,3), previous segment 7 position.\n\nPrevious segment 7 was at (5,3), which is index 7? Index 7: (5,3), so when segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was, it goes to (5,3), but segment 7 was at (5,3), so segment 8 moves to (5,3), and segment 7 moved to where segment 6 was, (6,3).\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5):\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- New segment 1: position of old head, (3,4)\n\n- New segment 2: position of old segment 1, (4,4)\n\n- New segment 3: position of old segment 2, (4,5)  // but (4,5) had food, but we didn't eat it\n\n- New segment 4: position of old segment 3, (5,5)\n\n- New segment 5: position of old segment 4, (5,4)\n\n- New segment 6: position of old segment 5, (6,4)\n\n- New segment 7: position of old segment 6, (6,3)\n\n- New segment 8: position of old segment 7, (5,3)  // old segment 7 was (5,3)? Old positions: seg7: (5,3), so new segment 8 moves to (5,3)\n\nBut old segment 8 (tail) was at (4,3), which is now empty, since tail moved away.\n\nIn this move, we didn't eat food, so tail moves, and (4,3) is vacated.\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is still there, but it's under segment 3 now? New segment 3 is at (4,5), so food is still under body.\n\nOn turn 30, from head at (3,5), I can move to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n\nMove U to (3,6).\n\nThen, since I eat food, the snake grows: head moves to (3,6), and tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo after eating at (3,6):\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Then body: segment 1 at (3,5)  // previous head position\n\n- Segment 2 at (3,4)  // previous segment 1\n\n- Segment 3 at (4,4)  // previous segment 2\n\n- Segment 4 at (4,5)  // previous segment 3, which was at (4,5), so still there\n\n- Etc.\n\nList new positions after eating:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Seg1: (3,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (3,4)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (4,5)  // old seg3, which was at (4,5)\n\n- Seg5: (5,5)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (5,4)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (6,4)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (6,3)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (5,3)  // old seg8, and since we ate, tail stays, so new segment at old tail position? When eating, tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment where the tail was.\n\nStandard: when no eat, tail moves forward, vacating the last position.\n\nWhen eat, tail stays, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail end.\n\nIn this case, before moving to eat, positions were: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3)  // after turn 29 move.\n\nThen on turn 30, move head to (3,6) and eat food.\n\nSince eat, head moves to (3,6), and tail does not move, so the segments from body are: seg1 moves to old head position (3,5), seg2 to old seg1 (3,4), seg3 to old seg2 (4,4), seg4 to old seg3 (4,5), etc., but since tail doesn't move, we keep the last segment and add a new one.\n\nAfter moving head to new position with eat:\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- New seg1: old head position (3,5)\n\n- New seg2: old seg1 position (3,4)\n\n- New seg3: old seg2 position (4,4)\n\n- New seg4: old seg3 position (4,5)  // which is where food was, but we are eating a different food\n\n- New seg5: old seg4 position (5,5)\n\n- New seg6: old seg5 position (5,4)\n\n- New seg7: old seg6 position (6,4)\n\n- New seg8: old seg7 position (6,3)\n\n- New seg9: old seg8 position (5,3)  // tail stays, so we have an additional segment\n\nOld tail was at (5,3), and it stays, so we have seg9 at (5,3), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail, but tail doesn't move, so the position (5,3) is still occupied, and we add a new segment at the same position? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move that turn, effectively adding a segment.\n\nSo before eating, the snake has N segments.\n\nAfter moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the one ahead, tail vacates its position.\n\nAfter moving with eating, head moves to new cell (food), each segment moves as usual, but the tail position does not vacate; instead, the tail remains, and the snake has N+1 segments.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose before move, positions P0, P1, ..., P_{N-1} with P0 head, P_{N-1} tail.\n\nIf no eat: after move, head to new H, then body: P0 becomes seg1, P1 becomes seg2, ..., P_{N-2} becomes seg_{N-1}, and tail is at P_{N-2}? No.\n\nAfter move to new head position H:\n\n- New head: H\n\n- New seg1: old P0\n\n- New seg2: old P1\n\n- ...\n\n- New seg_{N-1}: old P_{N-2}  // the old tail P_{N-1} is vacated.\n\nIf eat: after move to H (food), new head: H, new seg1: old P0, new seg2: old P1, ..., new seg_{N-1}: old P_{N-2}, and new seg_N: old P_{N-1} (tail position), so tail is now at old P_{N-1}, and it stays there.\n\nIn this case, for turn 30, after moving to (3,6) with eat:\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- New seg1: old head (3,5)\n\n- New seg2: old seg1 (3,4)\n\n- New seg3: old seg2 (4,4)\n\n- New seg4: old seg3 (4,5)\n\n- New seg5: old seg4 (5,5)\n\n- New seg6: old seg5 (5,4)\n\n- New seg7: old seg6 (6,4)\n\n- New seg8: old seg7 (6,3)\n\n- New seg9: old seg8 (5,3)  // and since eat, we add new segment at old tail position, which is old seg8 at (5,3), so new seg9 at (5,3)\n\nBut that means two segments at (5,3), which is wrong.\n\nOld tail was at (5,3), and it becomes new seg9, so position (5,3) is occupied by seg9.\n\nAnd no vacated cell.\n\nThe snake grows by one segment, with the new segment added at the tail end, but since the tail doesn't move, the position is not vacated.\n\nIn positions, after eat, the tail index increases.\n\nBefore move on turn 30, positions: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3)  // 9 segments? Indices: 0 to 8, 9 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,6) with eat:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Seg1: (3,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (3,4)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (4,5)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,5)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (5,4)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (6,4)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (6,3)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (5,3)  // old seg8, and since eat, the old tail position is kept, so seg9 at (5,3)\n\nBut old seg8 was at (5,3), and it moves to where old seg7 was, which is (6,3), so new seg8 is at (6,3), and new seg9 is at old seg8 position (5,3).\n\nYes, so (5,3) is occupied by seg9.\n\nNo problem.\n\nNow, back to the food at (4,5). It's still there, under new seg4 at (4,5)? After turn 30, with the move to (3,6), we have seg4 at (4,5), so food is still under body.\n\nTo eat it, we need to move the body away.\n\nThe tail is at (5,3), and head at (3,6).\n\nNow, the food at (4,5) has life 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to plan for turn 29.\n\nIf I move up on turn 29 to (3,5), then on turn 30 to (3,6) to eat the food at (3,6), that seems good, +1 score.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,6), which is near the border? y=6, and wall at y=7, so not immediate risk.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move to other places.\n\nBut let's see the other food at (4,5), which is on the body.\n\nTo eat that, I need to vacate (4,5).\n\nCurrently, after the above, (4,5) is occupied by seg4.\n\nAs the snake moves, segments will shift.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,6) on turn 30, then on turn 31, I need to move from (3,6).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but not reverse. Current head direction after moving to (3,6) is U, since I moved up.\n\nSo on turn 31, I can move U, D, L, but not D (reverse).\n\nMove up to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so I can't move there, collision.\n\nMove down to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by seg1, which is body, so I would collide.\n\nAfter turn 30, positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), etc.\n\nIf I move down from (3,6) to (3,5), but (3,5) has seg1, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nSo I cannot move down.\n\nMove left to (2,6), or right to (4,6), or up to (3,7) but y=7 wall, so invalid.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but occupied, so only L or R.\n\nU is wall.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nIf I go left to (2,6), or right to (4,6).\n\nNow, (4,6) might be free, let's see.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nPerhaps moving to (3,6) is risky because I get stuck in the corner.\n\nAfter eating at (3,6), I am at (3,6), with body below at (3,5) and (3,4), so I can only move left or right to (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nSay I move right to (4,6) on turn 31.\n\nThen head to (4,6), body moves: seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (3,5), etc.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move U, D, L, R, but U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5) which has food but also body? At that point, (4,5) has seg4 or something.\n\nAfter turn 31 move to (4,6):\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Seg1: (3,6)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (3,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (3,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (4,4)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (4,5)  // old seg4\n\n- etc.\n\n(4,5) has seg5, and food is there, but it's occupied.\n\nTo eat the food at (4,5), I need head to move there when it's free.\n\nBut currently occupied.\n\nThe food will be free when the snake moves away from it.\n\nThe segment at (4,5) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving, eventually the segment will leave (4,5).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince the snake is long, and the grid is small, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nAnother option for turn 29: instead of moving up, I could move down to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free? Current positions, no (3,3), so yes.\n\nMove D to (3,3).\n\nThen head to (3,3), body: seg1 to (3,4), seg2 to (4,4), seg3 to (4,5), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut food at (3,6) is above, and I might not reach it in time if I go down.\n\nLife span 7, I have 6 turns after this to eat it, since after turn 29, life decreases to 6, so I need to eat by turn 35.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (3,6) in three moves: up to (3,4), but (3,4) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,3) on turn 29:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Seg1: (3,4)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (4,4)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,5)  // old seg2\n\n- etc.\n\n(3,4) is now seg1, so if I move up to (3,4) on turn 30, I would collide with seg1 at (3,4), death.\n\nSo I cannot move back up immediately.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move L to (2,3), D to (3,2), or R to (4,3) but (4,3) is tail? Current after move, tail is at (4,3) or moved?\n\nAfter turn 29 move down to (3,3):\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Seg1: (3,4)\n\n- Seg2: (4,4)\n\n- Seg3: (4,5)\n\n- Seg4: (5,5)\n\n- Seg5: (5,4)\n\n- Seg6: (6,4)\n\n- Seg7: (6,3)\n\n- Seg8: (5,3)\n\n- Seg9: (4,3)? Old tail was (4,3), but after move, since no eat, tail moves to where old seg8 was? Old positions: before move, seg8 at (4,3)? No, old positions: seg8 at (5,3), seg9? Indices 0 to 8, 9 segments.\n\nBefore move: head (3,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (4,3)  // tail is seg8 at (4,3)\n\nAfter move down to (3,3) no eat:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Seg1: old head (3,4)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (4,4)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (4,5)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (5,5)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (5,4)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (6,4)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (6,3)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (5,3)  // tail at (5,3)\n\nOld seg8 at (4,3) is vacated.\n\nSo now, from head at (3,3), I can move to (3,2) down, (2,3) left, or (4,3) right, or (3,4) up but occupied by seg1, so cannot.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,3), D to (3,2), R to (4,3) which is now free? (4,3) was old tail, vacated, so free.\n\nMove to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is adjacent to tail or something, but not necessarily dangerous.\n\nBut I want to eat food.\n\nFood at (3,6) is still there, but from (3,3), I can go left or down or right, not up immediately.\n\nTo reach (3,6), I need to go around.\n\nFor example, go right to (4,3), then to (4,4) but (4,4) is seg2, occupied.\n\nAfter turn 29, positions: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), etc.\n\nOn turn 30, if I move R to (4,3), which is free.\n\nThen head to (4,3), body: seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (4,4), etc.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (5,3), (4,4) but (4,4) is now seg3, occupied, or (3,3) but occupied by seg1.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,2), R to (5,3), or U to (4,4) occupied.\n\n(5,3) is seg8? After this move, let's not go deep.\n\nThis seems messy, and I might not reach (3,6) in time.\n\nSimilarly, moving left on turn 29 to (2,4).\n\nMove L to (2,4).\n\nThen head to (2,4), body: seg1 to (3,4), seg2 to (4,4), etc.\n\nFrom there, I can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4) but occupied.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut to reach (3,6), from (2,4), I can go U to (2,5), then to (2,6), then to (3,6), but (3,6) is food, so I can go directly if possible.\n\nFrom (2,4), move U to (2,5), then U to (2,6), then R to (3,6) on turn 32, for example.\n\nTurn 29: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 32: move R to (3,6) to eat.\n\nFood at (3,6) has life 7 at turn 29, after turn 29 life 6, turn 30 life 5, turn 31 life 4, turn 32 life 3, so on turn 32, life 3>0, present, I can eat.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut after eating at (3,6), head at (3,6), with body at (2,6), (2,5), etc., so I can move R to (4,6), or D to (3,5), but (3,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nLet's not simulate all.\n\nBut in this case, by moving left first, I avoid the corner situation at (3,6) with body below.\n\nEarlier if I go directly up, I get stuck at (3,6) with only left and right moves.\n\nWith this path, when I eat at (3,6) on turn 32, the body is coming from left, so (3,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 31: if on turn 29 L to (2,4), turn 30 U to (2,5), turn 31 U to (2,6), positions:\n\nAfter turn 29 move L: head (2,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3), tail at (5,3)? After move, tail at old seg8 position.\n\nBefore move: head (3,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), ..., seg8 (4,3)\n\nAfter move L to (2,4) no eat:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Seg1: (3,4)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (4,4)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,5)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (5,5)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,4)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (6,4)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (6,3)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (5,3)  // old seg7  // tail at (5,3)\n\nOld seg8 at (4,3) vacated.\n\nThen turn 30 move U to (2,5): head to (2,5), body: seg1 to (2,4), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (4,4), etc., tail to old seg8 position (5,3) or something.\n\nAfter move U: head (2,5), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), tail at (6,3)\n\nThen turn 31 move U to (2,6): head (2,6), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,4), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (6,4), tail at (6,4)\n\nThen turn 32 move R to (3,6) to eat food: head to (3,6), and eat, so tail stays, new segment.\n\nPositions after eat: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4)  // new tail at old tail position (6,4)\n\nFrom head at (3,6), I can move U, but y=7 wall, D to (3,5) which is free? (3,5) not in positions, so free, or R to (4,6), or L to (2,6) but (2,6) is seg1, occupied.\n\nPositions: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), so (2,6) occupied, seg2 (2,5), etc.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: D to (3,5) free, R to (4,6) free, or U wall, L to (2,6) occupied.\n\nSo I can move down to (3,5) or right to (4,6).\n\nBetter than being stuck with only horizontal moves.\n\nNow, the other food at (4,5) is at (4,5), which is occupied by seg6 in this state? After turn 32, seg6 at (4,5), so still occupied.\n\nBut life span 9, so I have time.\n\nNow, back to turn 29 decision.\n\nI have three choices: U, D, L.\n\nD to (3,3) might lead to not reaching (3,6) easily, as I saw earlier.\n\nL to (2,4) allows me to reach (3,6) in a few turns with an escape route.\n\nU directly to (3,5) then to (3,6) is faster but risks getting stuck.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, avoiding risk is important.\n\nAlso, there's the food at (4,5) on the body, which I might be able to eat later.\n\nBut first, let's consider the grid layout.\n\nGrid: walls at borders, obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake is coiled, head at (3,4), tail at (4,3).\n\nThe area around: (3,4) head, (4,4) body, (4,5) body with food, etc.\n\nTo eat the food at (4,5), I need the snake to move so that (4,5) is vacated and then head moves there.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (4,5) moves away.\n\nCurrently, the snake is moving left, so if I continue left, the body might shift.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the food at (3,6) first since it's easier and has shorter life.\n\nThen deal with (4,5) later.\n\nBut with the U move, I get stuck, with L move, I have options.\n\nAnother idea: move down to (3,3) and then to the right or something to free up space.\n\nBut let's think about the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail is at (4,3), head at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), then head at (3,3), tail at (5,3) after move, not adjacent.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat the food at (4,5) when it's free.\n\nThe food at (4,5) will be free when the segment moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, the segment at (4,5) will move to a new position when the snake moves.\n\nOn each move, the positions shift.\n\nFor instance, if on turn 29 I move up to (3,5), then as before, segment at (4,5) moves to (4,4) or something.\n\nIn the first scenario, when I moved U to (3,5) on turn 29, positions: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5) — seg3 at (4,5), so still occupied.\n\nThen on turn 30, if I move U to (3,6), then positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5) — seg4 at (4,5), occupied.\n\nSo (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nTo vacate (4,5), I need the segment that is there to move.\n\nIn the current configuration, the segment at (4,5) is the third segment, so it will move when the head moves twice or something.\n\nThe position (4,5) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to a different position.\n\nSince the snake moves one step at a time, the cell is vacated only when that particular segment leaves it.\n\nIn this case, segment at (4,5) will move to where the previous segment was when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, say, down or left, the segment at (4,5) might move to (4,4) or (3,4) depending on the move.\n\nLet's simulate moving left on turn 29.\n\nMove L to (2,4) on turn 29.\n\nAfter move: head (2,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), etc., as before.\n\n(4,5) has seg3.\n\nNow, if on turn 30 I move U to (2,5), then head (2,5), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), so seg4 at (4,5), still occupied.\n\nIf I move in a way that the head goes around, it might take several moves to free (4,5).\n\nFor example, the segment at (4,5) is currently seg2 or seg3, and it will move when the segments before it move.\n\nThe position (4,5) will be occupied until that particular segment index moves away.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take time.\n\nBut life span is 9, so I have until turn 37 to eat it.\n\nI can focus on eating (3,6) first.\n\nFor turn 29, I think moving left to (2,4) is better to avoid the corner.\n\nThen I can go to (2,5), (2,6), then to (3,6) to eat on turn 32.\n\nThen from there, I have moves available.\n\nIf I move up directly, on turn 29 U to (3,5), turn 30 U to (3,6) eat, then on turn 31 I have to move left or right, say to (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nSay I go to (4,6) on turn 31.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move to (4,5)? But (4,5) has food but is occupied by body.\n\nAfter turn 31 move to (4,6): head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5) — so (4,5) has seg5.\n\nIf I move down to (4,5) on turn 32, I would eat the food if it's free, but (4,5) is occupied by seg5, so collision, I die.\n\nSo I cannot move to (4,5) while it's occupied.\n\nI need to wait until it's vacated.\n\nThe food at (4,5) will be vacated when the segment leaves it.\n\nIn this position, seg5 is at (4,5), which will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if on turn 32 I move from (4,6) to, say, (5,6), then head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), so (4,5) is now free, vacated.\n\nThen on turn 33, I can move to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut is (4,5) free? After turn 32 move to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5)? Let's list.\n\nBefore turn 32: after turn 31, positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,3) or something, but from earlier.\n\nAfter turn 30: after eating at (3,6), positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3)\n\nThen turn 31 move R to (4,6): head to (4,6), body: seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (3,5), seg3 to (3,4), seg4 to (4,4), seg5 to (4,5), seg6 to (5,5), seg7 to (5,4), seg8 to (6,4), seg9 to (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\n(4,5) has seg5.\n\nThen turn 32, move R to (5,6): head to (5,6), body: seg1 to (4,6), seg2 to (3,6), seg3 to (3,5), seg4 to (3,4), seg5 to (4,4), seg6 to (4,5), seg7 to (5,5), seg8 to (5,4), seg9 to (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)\n\nNow (4,5) has seg6, still occupied.\n\nseg5 moved to (4,4), seg6 to (4,5), so (4,5) still occupied by seg6.\n\nTo vacate (4,5), I need to move so that the segment there leaves.\n\nFor example, if I move down from (5,6) to (5,5) on turn 33, but (5,5) has seg7, occupied, collision.\n\nMove left to (4,6) but occupied by seg1.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) occupied by seg7, L to (4,6) occupied by seg1, R to (6,6) free? (6,6) not occupied, so move R to (6,6).\n\nThen head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), etc., and seg6 at (4,5) moves to where? After move to (6,6): seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), so (4,5) has seg7, still occupied.\n\nIt takes many moves to free (4,5) because the snake is long and the body is slow to move.\n\nEventually, it will be free, but it might take time, and the grid is small.\n\nIn the alternative path where I go left first, after eating at (3,6) on turn 32, I have positions where (4,5) is occupied, but I can maneuver to free it.\n\nBut it might be complicated.\n\nPerhaps for turn 29, moving left is safer.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but it's not in the way immediately.\n\nLet's list all possible moves for turn 29:\n\n- U to (3,5): then on turn 30 U to (3,6) eat, but then stuck with only horizontal moves, and risk if I can't find a way out.\n\n- D to (3,3): then I have to go left or right, and might not reach (3,6) in time or get stuck.\n\n- L to (2,4): then I can go up to (2,5), (2,6), then to (3,6) to eat on turn 32, with more space to move after.\n\nAlso, from (2,4), I could go down or other, but going up to eat food seems good.\n\nMoreover, by moving left, I might be able to circle around and eat the food at (4,5) later.\n\nBut for now, since the food at (3,6) has shorter life, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nTurn 29: move L to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 30: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 32: move R to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThen after that, on turn 33, from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or R to (4,6), as before.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 29, so I need turns 29,30,31,32,33, etc.\n\nBut the state may change, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) is on body, I can ignore it for now or plan to eat it when possible.\n\nBut in the sequence above, on turn 33, after eating at (3,6), head at (3,6), I can move, say, down to (3,5) if free.\n\nIn the left path, after turn 32 eat at (3,6), positions: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), so (4,5) has seg6, occupied.\n\n(3,5) is free, so I can move D to (3,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen head to (3,5), body: seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (2,6), etc.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (3,4) but (3,4) is seg4, occupied, or (4,5) occupied, or (3,6) occupied, or (2,5) but occupied by seg2.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6) occupied, D to (3,4) occupied, L to (2,5) occupied, R to (4,5) occupied by seg6.\n\nAll adjacent cells occupied? (3,5) can go to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(3,4) has seg4, (3,6) has seg1, (2,5) has seg2, (4,5) has seg6, all occupied, so I would die if I move to any.\n\nProblem!\n\nAfter eating at (3,6) on turn 32 and moving to (3,5) on turn 33, I am surrounded.\n\nBecause in the positions, after turn 32 eat: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4)\n\nThen turn 33 move D to (3,5): but (3,5) is free? In the list, no (3,5), so free.\n\nHead moves to (3,5), and since no eat (food at (4,5) not eaten yet), so tail moves.\n\nAfter move: head (3,5), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n\nNow, from head at (3,5), adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (3,6) has seg1, occupied\n\n- D: (3,4) has seg5, occupied\n\n- L: (2,5) has seg3, occupied\n\n- R: (4,5) has seg7, occupied\n\nAll four directions occupied, so I cannot move, and on next turn, whatever I do, I collide, death.\n\nOh no! So in this path, after eating at (3,6), if I move down to (3,5), I get trapped and die on the next turn.\n\nIf on turn 33 I move right to (4,6) instead.\n\n(4,6) is free? Not in positions, so free.\n\nMove R to (4,6).\n\nThen head to (4,6), body: seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (3,6), etc.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move U wall, D to (4,5) occupied, L to (3,6) occupied, R to (5,6) free.\n\nSo I can move R to (5,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in turn 33, from (3,6), moving R to (4,6) is possible, and (4,6) is free, so no collision.\n\nThen I can survive.\n\nBut in the move to (3,5), it was fatal.\n\nSo for the sequence, after eating at (3,6), I should not move down; instead move right to (4,6).\n\nIn the left path, on turn 33, move R to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, in the direct up path, I had to move left or right.\n\nBut in direct up, after eating at (3,6) on turn 30, on turn 31 I move to (4,6), then similar.\n\nBut in direct up, when I move to (3,6), the body is below at (3,5) and (3,4), so I have to move left or right immediately.\n\nIn the left path, when I eat on turn 32, the body is coming from the left, so (3,5) is free, and I can choose to move down or right.\n\nBut moving down is dangerous as above, so I should move right.\n\nFor turn 29, I think moving left is better to have more space.\n\nNow, for the food at (4,5), I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 29: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 32: move R to (3,6) to eat food at (3,6)\n\nThen on turn 33, from (3,6), move R to (4,6)  // avoid moving down\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move to (5,6) or down to (4,5) but occupied, so to (5,6)\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead, up to turn 34 or so.\n\nTurn 33: move R to (4,6)\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) has seg7, occupied.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6), move R to (5,6)  // assuming (5,6) free\n\nThen head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,4), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) has seg8 now.\n\nStill occupied.\n\nEventually, when the snake moves, the segment at (4,5) will move.\n\nFor example, if I keep moving right to (6,6), then down, etc.\n\nBut it will take time.\n\nSince the food has long life, I can do that later.\n\nFor now, the sequence for turns 29 to 33.\n\nIn the direct up move on turn 29, I can do:\n\nTurn 29: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: U to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 31: R to (4,6)  // for example\n\nThen turn 32: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 33: R to (6,6)\n\n etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in this case, with the left move, I have the same number of moves to eat the food, but with more space initially.\n\nMoreover, in the left move, the tail is at (6,4) or something, so there might be more space.\n\nI think L is better.\n\nNow, about the food at (4,5): it is on the body, and to eat it, I need to have the head move to (4,5) when it's free.\n\nThe position (4,5) will be free when the segment that is there moves away.\n\nIn the current snake, (4,5) is occupied by the third segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor instance, if I move the head, after a few moves, the segment index at (4,5) will change position.\n\nSpecifically, the number of moves until (4,5) is vacated depends on the distance from head to that segment.\n\nCurrently, head at (3,4), (4,5) is two segments away (index 2).\n\nWhen the head moves, the segment at index 2 will move to where index 1 was after one move, etc.\n\nBut the cell (4,5) is occupied as long as some segment is there.\n\nIt will be vacated when the segment that is currently at (4,5) leaves and no other segment enters before I can move there.\n\nBut since the snake moves continuously, I need to time it.\n\nFor example, after some moves, when the segment at (4,5) moves to a new cell, (4,5) is vacated, and on the next turn, I can move there if possible.\n\nBut it might not be easy to coordinate.\n\nSince the life is long, I can focus on survival and eating the other food first, but there is only one other food.\n\nPerhaps I can ignore it for now and just survive.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat both.\n\nAnother idea: if I move in a way that the tail moves away quickly, but the tail is at (4,3), and I can move to free space.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll go with the left move.\n\nSo for turn 29: L\n\nThen 30: U\n\n31: U\n\n32: R to (3,6) eat\n\nThen 33: R to (4,6) to avoid trap\n\nThat's 5 turns: 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nTurn 33 is the fifth action.\n\nt1=29, so turns 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 33, moving R to (4,6) is safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output up to turn 33.\n\nSince the state changes, I don't need to plan further for now.\n\nBut in the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nNow, for the food at (4,5), after some moves, it might be free, but I don't have to specify.\n\nSo I think:\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nBut on turn 32, when I move R to (3,6), I eat the food, so the snake grows.\n\nThen on turn 33, move R to (4,6).\n\nAll should be safe.\n\nIf I move directly up:\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 31: R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 32: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 33: R to (6,6)\n\nAlso safe, but I was at (3,6) with body below, so moving right is fine.\n\nBut with left move, I have the body on the left, so when I move right to (4,6), I have space below at (3,5) but I didn't move there.\n\nIn terms of risk, both are ok, but since the snake is coiled, moving left might open space.\n\nI think L is better.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2) is below, but not immediate issue.\n\nSo I'll go with L for turn 29.\n\nThen the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan the snake's moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 29 to 33). The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (3,6) before it disappears (life span 7 at turn 29, so must be eaten by turn 35).\n- Avoid the risk of getting trapped, especially after eating, by maintaining escape routes.\n- Prioritize the food at (3,6) due to its shorter life span, and address the food at (4,5) later since it has a longer life span (9 turns) and is currently under the body.\n- Ensure no collisions with walls, obstacles, or the body.\n\nThe snake starts at turn 29 with head at (3,4) and direction left (L). The grid is 8x8 with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). The food at (4,5) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately; it requires the body to move away first.\n\n### Plan for Turns 29-33:\n- **Turn 29 (t=29)**: Move left (L) to (2,4). This avoids the immediate risk of cornering at (3,6) and provides flexibility for future moves. Reverse move (right) is not allowed due to current direction L, so L, U, or D are options; L is chosen to position for a safe path to (3,6).\n- **Turn 30 (t=30)**: Move up (U) to (2,5). This continues the path toward (3,6) and keeps the snake clear of the body and walls.\n- **Turn 31 (t=31)**: Move up (U) to (2,6). This reaches the row below the food and prepares to eat it on the next turn.\n- **Turn 32 (t=32)**: Move right (R) to (3,6) and eat the food. The food at (3,6) is still present (life span decreases to 3 at turn 32) and eating it increases the snake's length by 1. After eating, the head is at (3,6), and the body is positioned such that moving down to (3,5) on the next turn would trap the snake (as all adjacent cells are occupied), so this must be avoided.\n- **Turn 33 (t=33)**: Move right (R) to (4,6). This avoids the trap at (3,5) and provides open space to the right for future movement. From (4,6), the snake can continue east or south safely.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Eating (3,6) safely**: By taking a slightly longer path (via left then up), the snake avoids getting stuck in the top row after eating. Directly moving up on turn 29 would lead to (3,6) on turn 30, but then the snake is trapped with only left/right moves and risks collision if it descends.\n- **Risk avoidance**: Moving left on turn 29 creates space and prevents the body from boxing in the head after eating. On turn 33, moving right to (4,6) ensures the head has room to maneuver (e.g., to (5,6) or (4,5) later if vacated).\n- **Long-term considerations**: The food at (4,5) is not eaten in this sequence because it remains under the body (at segment positions that shift but stay occupied). With a life span of 9, it can be targeted after turn 33 by moving to vacate (4,5) (e.g., by continuing east then south to free the cell). Survival is prioritized over immediate eating.\n- **Collision checks**: All moves are valid:\n  - No wall collisions: Moves stay within x=1-6, y=1-6 in this sequence.\n  - No body collisions: Each target cell is free at the time of move (simulated step-by-step).\n  - No instant reverse: Moves respect direction changes (e.g., after L on t29, U is allowed; after U on t31, R is allowed).\n\nThis plan scores +1 from (3,6) and sets up for potential future food consumption while minimizing risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 30: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 31: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 32: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 33: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 30,
        "score": 8,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 30. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on those lines, meaning we can't go to cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (2,4), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (6,3)\n\n- Tail: (5,3)\n\nThe snake has 9 segments, so length is 9.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So it's moving left, meaning from (2,4), it came from the right, so previous move was left.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,6) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBut (4,5) is also a snake body segment. From the snake positions, (4,5) is the third segment after head. So food at (4,5) is under the snake's body.\n\nNow, for food under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. But in this case, the food is on (4,5), which is occupied by the snake. So to eat it, the snake needs to move such that (4,5) is vacated, and then later the head moves to (4,5).\n\nAlso, there's another food at (3,6), which is empty.\n\nLife span: for (3,6), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including this turn. So if not eaten by turn 35, it vanishes. Turn 30 now, so after turn 35, it's gone. Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 30, life span 6, turn 31 it will be 5, down to turn 35 it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 37.\n\nBut (4,5) is under the snake, so it might not be accessible immediately.\n\nSnake head is at (2,4), moving left. So from (2,4), possible moves: U (up to (2,5)), D (down to (2,3)), L (left to (1,4)), R (right to (3,4)).\n\nBut head direction is L, so if I move right, that would be opposite direction. Rule: no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so cannot move R immediately. So possible moves are U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's opposite.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and collisions.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving L to (1,4): x=1, y=4, which is not wall, since walls are at x=0, not x=1. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are ok? Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 cannot be occupied. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except for internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,4):\n\n- U: (2,5) - y=5, within 1-6, not wall, need to check if occupied by body or obstacle.\n\n- D: (2,3) - y=3, ok.\n\n- L: (1,4) - x=1, ok.\n\n- R: (3,4) - but (3,4) is a body segment? Snake positions: (2,4) head, then (3,4) is the first body segment. So (3,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nMoving to (3,4) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nTail is at (5,3). (3,4) is the second segment, not tail.\n\nRule: head touches any body segment except the tail is collision. But when moving into tail, it's ok if the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that will be occupied by the tail after movement is ok, because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, for move R to (3,4): (3,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows, so the tail moves forward.\n\nIf head moves to (3,4), which is currently occupied by body, but after move, that segment might be different.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt current state, positions: head (2,4), then body: (3,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nIf head moves right to (3,4), but (3,4) is where the first body segment is. After move, the new head position is (3,4), and the body segments shift: the old head becomes new first segment, so (2,4) becomes first body segment, then (3,4) becomes second body segment, but (3,4) was the first, now it's second? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end cell is vacated, unless it eats food.\n\nBut in terms of collision: if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if that body segment is the tail and it will move.\n\nThe rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" is collision, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move.\n\nIn this case, (3,4) is not the tail; tail is at (5,3). So (3,4) is a body segment, not tail. Therefore, moving to (3,4) would cause head to touch body segment, collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, for other cells.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake: from positions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So all these are occupied.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2), which is wall.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,4):\n\n- U: (2,5) - is this occupied? Snake has (4,5), (5,5), but (2,5) is not in the list, so free? Let's check: positions are (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), etc. (2,5) is not listed, so should be free. Also, not wall: x=2, y=5, both between 1-6, not (5,2) obstacle.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2, different.\n\nSo (2,5) is empty.\n\n- D: (2,3) - not in snake positions, not wall, should be empty.\n\n- L: (1,4) - x=1,y=4, not wall, not occupied, empty.\n\n- R: (3,4) - but (3,4) is occupied by snake body, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nAlso, since current direction L, cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, food: (3,6) at (3,6), value 1, life span 6.\n\nAnd (4,5) at (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so cannot eat it now. It has life span 8, so we have time.\n\n(4,5) is a body segment, so to eat that food, we need to move the snake so that (4,5) is vacated, then later head moves there.\n\nBut currently, head is at (2,4), far from it.\n\nAlso, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail is at (5,3), and head is at (2,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,4) and (5,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonally or further. Distance: |dx|=3, |dy|=1, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells would be like (2,4) and (1,4), (3,4), (2,5), (2,3), etc.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except obstacle at (5,2).\n\nCells: let's list coordinates.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (x,y) with x=1-6, y=1-6 are playable, except (5,2) is obstacle.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail: (5,3)\n\nFood: (3,6) and (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied.\n\n(4,5) is both food and body, but food can be eaten later.\n\nLife span: (3,6) disappears after 6 turns, so by turn 35 inclusive? Life span decreases each turn, starting from turn 30.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t+L it is gone.\n\nRule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, life span N, it means it has N turns left, including current turn. After N turns, it is gone.\n\nFor (3,6): at turn 30, life span 6, so it will be there for turns 30,31,32,33,34, and disappear after turn 34? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, life span decreases to N-1 after the turn? I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, life span is L, then during the turn, if eaten, good, else at end of turn, life span decreases by 1, and if 0, disappears.\n\nBut for disappearance, it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n\nSo for (3,6), life span 6 at turn 30, so it will disappear after 6 turns, so at the end of turn 35, it should be gone. Turns: turn 30: L=6, after turn 30, L=5; turn 31: L=5, after turn 31, L=4; ... turn 34: L=2, after turn 34, L=1; turn 35: L=1, after turn 35, L=0, disappear. So it can be eaten up to turn 35.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life span 8 at turn 30, disappears after turn 37.\n\nNow, (4,5) is under snake body, so we need to vacate it first.\n\nCurrent possible moves: from (2,4), can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or L to (1,4).\n\nI need to plan for 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's see the food at (3,6). It's at (3,6), which is within grid, x=3,y=6, y=6 is the top row, but y=6 is not wall, walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok, since y=7 is wall. y from 1 to 6 are playable, y=6 is the top, but not wall, only y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 ok.\n\nSo (3,6) is at top row.\n\nHead at (2,4), so to reach (3,6), we need to go right and up.\n\nBut from (2,4), moving U to (2,5) gets closer in y, but x is same.\n\nThen from (2,5), can go U to (2,6), then R to (3,6), for example.\n\nBut need to avoid collisions and consider body.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) is under body, so we might want to free it.\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied, and it's a body segment. To free it, when the snake moves, the tail will move, but (4,5) is not tail; tail is (5,3).\n\nThe segment at (4,5) will move when the snake moves, depending on the path.\n\nSince the snake has many segments, moving will cause the body to shift.\n\nFor example, if we move, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the previous segment.\n\nSo to vacate (4,5), we need to move the snake such that the segment that was at (4,5) moves away, and no new segment comes immediately, but since the snake moves, positions change.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to simulate a few moves.\n\nBut I need to choose a sequence.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nLet me list all possible safe moves from current position.\n\nFrom (2,4):\n\n- U to (2,5): (2,5) is empty? Earlier I thought yes. Snake positions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). (2,5) not listed, so empty. Also not wall. So safe.\n\n- D to (2,3): (2,3) not in snake positions, not wall, empty. Safe.\n\n- L to (1,4): (1,4) not occupied, not wall. Safe.\n\n- R not possible.\n\nNow, after moving, the new head position and direction.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) is on the body, but since we don't eat it now, it stays, and life span decreases.\n\nNow, I should aim to eat the food at (3,6) since it has shorter life span, 6 turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has 8 turns, so more time.\n\nBut (4,5) is closer in a way, but occupied.\n\nPath to (3,6): from (2,4) to (3,6).\n\nOne way: go up to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then right to (3,6). That's two moves to reach, but we need to be able to move there without collision.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,5): after move, new head at (2,5), body: the old head (2,4) becomes new segment 1, then (3,4) becomes segment 2, etc. Let's list new positions after a move.\n\nAssume we move U to (2,5).\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nThen body: since head moved to (2,5), the first body segment is the old head position (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and tail (5,3) moves to the previous position of segment 7 or something.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo original positions: index 0: head (2,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: tail (5,3)\n\nAfter move U, new head at (2,5)\n\nThen new segment 1: old head position (2,4)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 position (3,4)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 position (4,4)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 position (4,5)\n\nBut (4,5) is where food is, but it's a position, not necessarily eaten.\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 position (5,5)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 position (5,4)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 position (6,4)\n\nNew segment 8 (tail): old segment 7 position (6,3)\n\nOld tail (5,3) is left, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so (5,3) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), body: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is still there, but now it's occupied by new segment 4? New segment 4 is at (4,5), so still occupied, not free.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,6) is still there.\n\nFrom here, head at (2,5), direction U (since we moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is now body segment, so cannot move down, collision. L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nFirst, (2,6): y=6, which is not wall, y=6 is playable, since walls y=0,7.\n\n(2,6) not occupied, so safe.\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, not wall, not occupied, safe.\n\n(3,5): not occupied, safe.\n\nD to (2,4) is occupied by body, so unsafe.\n\nAlso, current direction U, so cannot move D instantly? Rule: no instant reverse. Current direction after move is U, so cannot move D (down) next.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nFrom (2,5), to reach (3,6), we can go U to (2,6), then R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is food, so if head moves to (3,6) on that turn, it eats the food.\n\nAfter moving U to (2,5), at turn 31, if we move U to (2,6), then at turn 32, we can move R to (3,6).\n\nBut let's see if (3,6) is safe to move to.\n\nAt turn 32, if we move to (3,6), what are the positions.\n\nFirst, need to simulate from turn 30.\n\nTurn 30: current, head at (2,4), dir L.\n\nI choose to move U to (2,5). New head (2,5), dir U.\n\nTurn 31: from (2,5), move U to (2,6). New head (2,6), dir U.\n\nNow positions: after move U to (2,6), new head (2,6), body: old head (2,5), then old seg1 (2,4), old seg2 (3,4), old seg3 (4,4), old seg4 (4,5), old seg5 (5,5), old seg6 (5,4), old seg7 (6,4), tail old seg8 (6,3)? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 30 move U: positions at start of turn 31: head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nMove U to (2,6): new head (2,6)\n\nNew segment 1: old head (2,5)\n\nNew segment 2: old seg1 (2,4)\n\nNew segment 3: old seg2 (3,4)\n\nNew segment 4: old seg3 (4,4)\n\nNew segment 5: old seg4 (4,5)\n\nNew segment 6: old seg5 (5,5)\n\nNew segment 7: old seg6 (5,4)\n\nNew segment 8: old seg7 (6,4)\n\nOld tail (6,3) is vacated.\n\nFood at (3,6) still there, life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 31, food (3,6) life span was 6 at turn 30, after turn 30 it decreases to 5, so at turn 31, life span 5.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life span decreases.\n\nNow at turn 32, from (2,6), dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot, collision.\n\nD to (2,5), but (2,5) is now body segment (new segment 1), so occupied, collision.\n\nL to (1,6), R to (3,6).\n\n(1,6) not occupied, safe.\n\n(3,6) not occupied, and it's food.\n\nAlso, current direction U, so moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: L or R.\n\nIf we move R to (3,6), we eat the food.\n\nNew head at (3,6), and since we eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, the new tail is added, so length increases.\n\nSpecifically: head moves to (3,6), which has food, so we eat it, reward +1, length increases. The body: new segment 1 is old head (2,6), new segment 2 is old seg1 (2,5), and so on, up to new segment 9 is old seg8 (6,4), and since we eat, a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, effectively growing.\n\nPositions: new head at (3,6)\n\nThen new body: the old head position becomes new segment 1, so (2,6) becomes seg1\n\nThen old seg1 becomes new seg2: (2,5)\n\nOld seg2 becomes new seg3: (2,4)? Let's list old positions before move.\n\nAt start turn 32: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  -- tail at (6,4)? After turn 31 move, positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  -- and (6,3) was vacated earlier.\n\nAfter turn 31 move to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,4), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (6,4)  -- tail is (6,4), since old seg7 was (6,4) moved to tail? Old positions before turn 31 move: head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nAfter move U to (2,6): new head (2,6), new seg1: old head (2,5), new seg2: old seg1 (2,4), new seg3: old seg2 (3,4), new seg4: old seg3 (4,4), new seg5: old seg4 (4,5), new seg6: old seg5 (5,5), new seg7: old seg6 (5,4), new seg8: old seg7 (6,4), and old tail (6,3) is left, so new tail is (6,4), and (6,3) empty.\n\nSo positions: head (2,6), body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nNow at turn 32, move R to (3,6): (3,6) is empty, and has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (3,6)\n\nThen since eat, add new segment, so the body: new seg1: old head (2,6), new seg2: old seg1 (2,5), new seg3: old seg2 (2,4), new seg4: old seg3 (3,4), new seg5: old seg4 (4,4), new seg6: old seg5 (4,5), new seg7: old seg6 (5,5), new seg8: old seg7 (5,4), new seg9: old seg8 (6,4)  -- and since eat, no vacate, so new tail is (6,4), but we add a segment, so the new segment is added where? Typically, the tail stays, so the new segment is at the position where tail was, but since tail moved? When not eating, tail moves forward; when eating, tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail didn't move, it's the same position.\n\nIn this case, before move, tail is at (6,4). After head moves to (3,6) and eats, the tail doesn't move, so it stays at (6,4), and a new segment is added, so the tail becomes the new segment, and the previous segments are shifted.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), then the body includes all old segments plus the old tail position as new segment.\n\nSo new segment 1: (2,6)  -- old head\n\nNew segment 2: (2,5)  -- old seg1\n\nNew segment 3: (2,4)  -- old seg2\n\nNew segment 4: (3,4)  -- old seg3\n\nNew segment 5: (4,4)  -- old seg4\n\nNew segment 6: (4,5)  -- old seg5\n\nNew segment 7: (5,5)  -- old seg6\n\nNew segment 8: (5,4)  -- old seg7\n\nNew segment 9: (6,4)  -- old seg8, which was tail\n\nAnd since we eat, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before move? I think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at that position, but since it doesn't move, the length increases by one, with the new segment at the tail position.\n\nIn terms of positions, the new snake has all the old segments plus the head at new position.\n\nBefore move, positions: head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg8 (tail)\n\nAfter move with eat: new head at food, new seg1 at old head, new seg2 at old seg1, ..., new seg8 at old seg7, and new seg9 at old seg8 (tail position). So the tail position is now seg9, and we have an additional segment.\n\nIn this case, old tail at (6,4) becomes new seg9.\n\nAnd since we eat, no cell is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4)\n\nLength 10 now.\n\nAnd food at (3,6) eaten, so removed.\n\nFood at (4,5) is still there, but occupied by seg6.\n\nLife span of (4,5) is decreasing.\n\nNow, back to turn 30.\n\nIf I go this path, I can eat (3,6) by turn 32.\n\nBut is this safe? In the moves, from (2,4) U to (2,5), then U to (2,6), then R to (3,6), all safe.\n\nAt turn 32, after eating, head at (3,6), dir R (since we moved right).\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, impossible.\n\nD to (3,5), L to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(3,5) is empty? Current positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n(3,5) not occupied, should be empty.\n\n(2,6) is body seg1, occupied.\n\n(4,6) not occupied.\n\nAlso, current dir R, so cannot move L instantly.\n\nSo possible: D to (3,5), or R to (4,6).\n\nU not possible, L not allowed.\n\nNow, I need to think beyond to plan.\n\nBut I have to provide actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The answer format is for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says think 5+ turns, I should provide a sequence of actions, say for 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nThe instruction is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many. I think I should provide a sequence for the next few turns.\n\nSince we are at turn 30, I need to output actions for turn 30, 31, 32, etc.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nI could go directly towards the food.\n\nAnother move from (2,4): instead of U, I could go L to (1,4) or D to (2,3).\n\nBut (3,6) is up and right, so going L or D might take longer or be riskier.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (1,4), then I am farther from food.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,3) down.\n\nBut food at (3,6) has limited time, only 6 turns, so I should prioritize eating it soon.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,5), but it's under body and has more life, so later.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,6), I can think about (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is currently occupied, and in the positions, it might be freed later.\n\nIn the current snake, (4,5) is a segment, and when the snake moves, it may move away.\n\nFor example, if I go the path to (3,6), after eating, positions include (4,5) as a segment, so food is still under body.\n\nTo eat (4,5), I need to move such that (4,5) is vacated and head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied by seg6 in the new positions, but it will move when the snake moves.\n\nPerhaps I need to simulate or plan a path.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,4), and head at (3,6), not adjacent.\n\nBut let's see if I can free (4,5).\n\nFirst, let's stick to eating (3,6) quickly.\n\nSo from turn 30, move U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 31, move U to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 32, move R to (3,6) and eat.\n\nNow turn 33: head at (3,6), dir R.\n\nPossible moves: D to (3,5) or R to (4,6)\n\n(3,5) is empty, (4,6) empty.\n\nIf I move D to (3,5): new head (3,5), dir D.\n\nThen positions: new head (3,5), new seg1: old head (3,6), new seg2: old seg1 (2,6), etc., down to new tail: since no eat, tail moves, old tail was at (6,4), which was seg9, now vacated, new tail is old seg8 (5,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 32 eat, positions: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4)\n\nMove D to (3,5): (3,5) empty, no food, so just move, no eat.\n\nNew head (3,5)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,6)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (2,6)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,5)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,4)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,4)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,4)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (4,5)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (5,5)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (5,4)\n\nOld tail (6,4) vacated.\n\nFood at (4,5) is still there, but now (4,5) is occupied by new seg7.\n\nNot free.\n\nIf from (3,6) I move R to (4,6), similar.\n\nBut (4,6) is empty, no food.\n\nNew head (4,6), dir R.\n\nThen positions similar.\n\nBut (4,5) food is at (4,5), which is currently seg6, at (4,5).\n\nTo free it, I need to move the snake so that the segment at (4,5) moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move the head down or something.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take time.\n\nBut life span 8 turns, at turn 30, after turn 32, it has life span decreased to 6? At turn 30, life span 8, after turn 30, L=7, turn 31 L=6, turn 32 L=5, etc. After turn 32, when we eat (3,6), (4,5) food has life span 8 at turn 30, after turn 30 L=7, after turn 31 L=6, after turn 32 L=5, so at turn 33, L=5, still 5 turns left.\n\nSo we have time.\n\nNow, back to turn 30, I think going U then U then R to eat (3,6) by turn 32 is good.\n\nBut is there risk?\n\nAt turn 32, when I move to (3,6), it is safe.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive and eat other food.\n\nThere is also the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not near.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is coiled, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after eating at (3,6), the snake has segments at (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo the body is around (2,4) to (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\nHead at (3,6), I can move to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\n(3,5) is below, which might be ok.\n\n(4,6) is right.\n\nNow, to reach (4,5) food, which is at (4,5), currently occupied.\n\n(4,5) is seg7 in the list, but it will move.\n\nFor example, if I move head to (3,5), then seg at (4,5) might move depending on the body.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving to free (4,5).\n\nBut let's first confirm the turn 30 action.\n\nAnother possible move from (2,4): I could go D or L, but that might not help for the food.\n\nFor example, if I go D to (2,3) at turn 30.\n\nThen head to (2,3), dir D.\n\nThen positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), tail (5,3) moves to (6,3) or something.\n\nAfter move D to (2,3): new head (2,3), new seg1 (2,4), new seg2 (3,4), new seg3 (4,4), new seg4 (4,5), new seg5 (5,5), new seg6 (5,4), new seg7 (6,4), new seg8 (6,3), old tail (5,3) vacated.\n\nFood (3,6) still there, but I am at (2,3), farther from (3,6).\n\nTo reach (3,6), I need to go up, e.g., U to (2,4) but (2,4) is now body, occupied, cannot. Or from (2,3) go U to (2,4)? (2,4) is seg1, occupied, so cannot move there. L to (1,3), R to (3,3), etc.\n\nThen it takes more turns to reach (3,6), and with limited time, might not make it.\n\nSimilarly, if go L to (1,4), similar issue.\n\nSo going up seems best to reach food quickly.\n\nMoreover, with the U U R plan, I eat by turn 32.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output for turns 30 to 34 or something.\n\nAfter eating at turn 32, I need to plan next moves.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,5).\n\nAt turn 32, after eating, (4,5) is occupied by seg6.\n\nThe food is at (4,5), but it's under snake, so to eat, we need to vacate (4,5) and then head move there.\n\n(4,5) will be vacated when the segment there moves away and no other segment comes immediately.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves such that the segment at (4,5) moves to another position, then (4,5) is free, and if head moves there later, it can eat.\n\nBut it might be occupied by another segment if the snake turns.\n\nTo free (4,5), since it's a body segment, we need to move in a way that the body shifts.\n\nFor instance, if we move the head down or left, the segment at (4,5) might move to (4,4) or something.\n\nIn current positions after turn 32 eat: head (3,6), body: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo seg6 is at (4,5), which has the food.\n\nWhen we move, if we move head to (3,5), for example.\n\nTurn 33: from (3,6), move D to (3,5)\n\nNew head (3,5), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,6)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (2,6)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,5)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,4)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,4)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,4)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (4,5)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (5,5)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (5,4)\n\nOld tail (6,4) vacated.\n\nNow, (4,5) is occupied by new seg7.\n\nPreviously seg6 was at (4,5), now after move, seg7 is at (4,5), so still occupied.\n\nIf we move the head in a direction that causes the body to shift differently.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), instead of moving D, move R to (4,6).\n\nTurn 33: move R to (4,6)\n\nNew head (4,6), no eat.\n\nNew seg1: (3,6)\n\nNew seg2: (2,6)\n\nNew seg3: (2,5)\n\nNew seg4: (2,4)\n\nNew seg5: (3,4)\n\nNew seg6: (4,4)\n\nNew seg7: (4,5)\n\nNew seg8: (5,5)\n\nNew seg9: (5,4)\n\nOld tail (6,4) vacated.\n\n(4,5) still occupied by seg7.\n\nSo in both cases, (4,5) remains occupied.\n\nTo free it, I need to move such that the segment that is at (4,5) moves away and the position is not immediately reoccupied.\n\nFor example, if I can make the snake straighten or move in a line.\n\nBut currently, the snake has a bend.\n\nFrom the positions, at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), so it's like a corner.\n\nIf I move the head to the left or down, it might take time.\n\nSince (4,5) is occupied, and we move, it stays occupied until the segment moves.\n\nThe segment at (4,5) will move when the segments before it move.\n\nFor example, seg5 is at (4,4), if seg5 moves, then seg6 will move to where seg5 was, but only if the head moves.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nPerhaps I can ignore (4,5) for now and focus on other areas, but it's the only other food.\n\nOr I can eat it later when possible.\n\nBut let's think long-term survival.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,4), and if I can manuever the head near the tail, but with care for the tail reward danger.\n\nBut now, after eating (3,6), head at (3,6), tail at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nI could go down to the bottom area.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 30.\n\nI think for turn 30, moving U is good.\n\nThen for turn 31, U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 32, R to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen for turn 33, I need to choose a move.\n\nFrom (3,6), after move to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nIf I move to (3,5), then head at (3,5), dir D.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4), U to (3,6) but occupied or reverse.\n\n(2,5) is body seg2, occupied.\n\n(4,5) is seg7, occupied, collision.\n\n(3,4) is seg5, occupied.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nSo (2,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied, (3,4) occupied.\n\nWhat about (3,5) itself, but head is there.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6) but (3,6) is body seg1, occupied, and also reverse direction? Current dir D, U is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nD to (3,4) occupied, collision.\n\nL to (2,5) occupied.\n\nR to (4,5) occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied or wall? (3,6) up occupied, (3,4) down occupied, (2,5) left occupied, (4,5) right occupied.\n\n(4,5) is at x=4,y=5, which is occupied by seg8 or something.\n\nIn positions: (4,5) is occupied by seg8? List: seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4)\n\nSo (4,5) is seg7.\n\nAll around (3,5) are occupied: north (3,6) seg1, south (3,4) seg5, west (2,5) seg3, east (4,5) seg7.\n\nSo from (3,5), no safe move! All directions occupied, so snake dies if I move to (3,5) on turn 33.\n\nBut at turn 33, when I move from (3,6) to (3,5), after move, the positions are as above, but at the moment of move, when head moves to (3,5), it was empty before, so move is possible, but after moving, the head is surrounded, so on next turn, no possible move, death.\n\nOh, problem!\n\nIf I move to (3,5) at turn 33, after eating at turn 32, then at turn 34, head at (3,5), all adjacent cells are occupied, so no valid move, collision or wall, but walls not near, but all body, so collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,6) at turn 33.\n\nFrom (3,6) move R to (4,6).\n\nThen new head (4,6), new seg1 (3,6), new seg2 (2,6), new seg3 (2,5), new seg4 (2,4), new seg5 (3,4), new seg6 (4,4), new seg7 (4,5), new seg8 (5,5), new seg9 (5,4)\n\nTail at (5,4), old (6,4) vacated.\n\nNow head at (4,6), dir R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, impossible.\n\nD to (4,5), but (4,5) is seg7, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (3,6), which is seg1, occupied, and reverse direction? Current dir R, L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nR to (5,6), not occupied, should be empty.\n\n(5,6) is within grid, x=5,y=6, not wall, not occupied, so safe.\n\nSo from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6).\n\nThen not trapped.\n\nBut in the case of moving to (3,5), it was trapped.\n\nSo from (3,6), moving D to (3,5) is bad, leads to death.\n\nMoving R to (4,6) is better, then I can go to (5,6).\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nAt turn 30: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 32: move R to (3,6) and eat.\n\nNow turn 33: from (3,6), I should move R to (4,6) to avoid trap.\n\nThen head at (4,6), dir R.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6), move R to (5,6) as above.\n\nNew head (5,6), dir R.\n\nThen positions: new head (5,6), new seg1 (4,6), new seg2 (3,6), new seg3 (2,6), new seg4 (2,5), new seg5 (2,4), new seg6 (3,4), new seg7 (4,4), new seg8 (4,5), new seg9 (5,5)\n\nOld tail (5,4) vacated.\n\nNow (4,5) is occupied by seg8.\n\nFood still there.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, impossible.\n\nD to (5,5), but (5,5) is seg9, occupied? Seg9 is at (5,5), so moving to (5,5) would be collision, since not tail? Tail is seg9, but (5,5) is current position of seg9.\n\nIf head moves to (5,5), which is occupied by seg9, and seg9 is the tail, so it might be ok if tail moves.\n\nRule: can move into tail cell because tail will move.\n\nHere, if head moves to (5,5), which is tail position, after move, tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to tail cell, since tail moves, it should be safe.\n\nConfirm: positions before move: head (5,6), tail (5,5) at seg9.\n\nIf move D to (5,5), new head at (5,5), and since no eat, tail moves to previous position of seg8 or something.\n\nNew head (5,5)\n\nNew seg1: old head (5,6)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,6)\n\n...\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (4,5)  -- since old seg8 was (4,5), moves to new seg9.\n\nOld tail (5,5) is now head, so the cell is not vacated, but since head moves there, and tail moves to new position, no collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, so moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nSimilarly, here, moving to (5,5) is safe.\n\nAlso, L to (4,6), but (4,6) is seg1, occupied, and reverse direction? Current dir R, L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nR to (6,6), not occupied.\n\nD to (5,5) as above.\n\nU impossible.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf move D to (5,5), then new head (5,5), dir D.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5)\n\nNow (4,5) is tail, and has food? (4,5) has food, but it's occupied by tail.\n\nIf I move head to (4,5) later, I can eat, but need to be careful with tail reward danger.\n\nBut head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), which is adjacent! (5,5) and (4,5) share a side, so adjacent.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the new tail grows and collides.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, at this state, head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), adjacent, and (4,5) has food, so if I move head to (4,5), I would eat the food, but since head is adjacent to tail, it would cause death.\n\nTherefore, I should not move to (4,5) when head is adjacent and tail has food.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (5,5), head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), adjacent, so I cannot eat the food at (4,5) because it would kill.\n\nMoreover, (4,5) is occupied by tail, so I cannot move there anyway now.\n\nPositions: (4,5) occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nBut to eat, I need to move head to (4,5) when it is free and head moves there.\n\nBut here it's occupied.\n\nBack to turn 34, from (5,6), if I move to (5,5), I end up with head adjacent to tail with food on tail cell, which is dangerous if I try to eat later.\n\nIf I move R to (6,6) instead.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6) move R to (5,6)? Turn 33: after move to (4,6), head at (4,6)\n\nTurn 34: move from (4,6) to (5,6), as I had earlier.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: R to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 33: R to (4,6)\n\nNow at turn 34, from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6) or D to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied.\n\n(4,5) is seg7, occupied, not tail, so cannot move there.\n\nOnly R to (5,6) is possible? Earlier I said U impossible, D to (4,5) occupied, L to (3,6) occupied and reverse not allowed, so only R to (5,6).\n\nSo move R to (5,6)\n\nNew head (5,6), dir R.\n\nThen turn 35: from (5,6), move to (6,6) or D to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions starting from turn 30.\n\nSince the U U R plan eats the food quickly, and then I can avoid the trap.\n\nFor turn 33, move R to (4,6) instead of D.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nThen for turn 33: R to (4,6)\n\nBut at turn 32, after moving R to (3,6), head dir R, then at turn 33, moving R to (4,6) is not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen turn 34: from (4,6), only possible move is R to (5,6), as above.\n\nThen turn 35: from (5,6), possible moves: R to (6,6), D to (5,5), U impossible, L to (4,6) occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\n(6,6) not occupied, (5,5) is occupied by tail or body? Positions after turn 34 move to (5,6): head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)  -- tail at (5,5)\n\nSo (5,5) is tail, so can move D to (5,5), safe.\n\nOr R to (6,6) safe.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), then head at (5,5), tail at (4,5) or something, but (4,5) has food, and if head and tail adjacent, it might be issue if I want to eat.\n\nBut I can choose not to eat for now.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) has life span, I can leave it and go elsewhere.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should try to eat it.\n\nBut with the tail danger.\n\nPerhaps I can move the tail away first.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think for turn 30 to 34, I can output.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2), not near.\n\nSo let's define the actions.\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 32: move R to (3,6) eat food\n\nThen turn 33: move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 35: for example, move R to (6,6) or D to (5,5), but I need to specify.\n\nSince the answer format might not require all, but I think 5 actions: turns 30 to 34.\n\nTurn 30,31,32,33,34.\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: R\n\nTurn 33: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 34: R (to (5,6))\n\nAt turn 34, moving to (5,6), as above.\n\nThen the snake is at (5,6), and I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, I think this is fine.\n\nTo avoid the tail danger, from (5,6), I can move R to (6,6) instead of D.\n\nBut not necessary now.\n\nI think this sequence eats the first food and moves safely.\n\nFor the food at (4,5), I can plan later to free it, but with 5+ turns, I have actions for 5 turns.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the plan is to prioritize eating the positive food at (3,6) due to its shorter life span (6 turns remaining, disappearing after turn 35). The snake is currently at (2,4) with direction left (L). Moving up (U) immediately allows the snake to approach (3,6) efficiently while avoiding collisions. The sequence below ensures the snake eats (3,6) by turn 32 and then moves right (R) to avoid getting trapped in a dead end.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (3,6)**: Must be eaten by turn 35. The path (U to (2,5), U to (2,6), then R to (3,6)) achieves this in 3 turns with minimal risk.\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Currently under the snake's body (occupied by a segment). It has a longer life span (disappears after turn 37) and cannot be eaten immediately. After eating (3,6), moving right (R) avoids the risk of the snake becoming trapped (e.g., moving down to (3,5) would surround the head by turn 33).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Walls are at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle (5,2), but the planned path stays clear.\n  - No instant reverse: After moving up (U) on turn 30 and 31, direction becomes U, so moving down (D) is not allowed on subsequent turns. Similarly, after moving right (R) on turn 32, direction becomes R, so moving left (L) is not allowed.\n  - Body collisions: All moves are to empty cells. Moving to the tail cell is safe when applicable, but not needed here.\n- **5+ Turns Planning**: \n  - Turns 30-32: Focus on reaching and eating (3,6).\n  - Turns 33-34: Move right to (4,6) and (5,6) to open space and avoid dead ends. This positions the snake to potentially access the food at (4,5) later (once vacated) or explore other areas.\n  - Beyond turn 34: The snake should continue maneuvering to free (4,5) for eating (e.g., by moving in a way that shifts the body off (4,5)), but this sequence covers the critical first 5 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 30**: Move U (up) to (2,5). This starts the path toward (3,6) and is safe (no collision, not a wall). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 31**: Move U (up) to (2,6). Continues the path; (2,6) is safe. Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 32**: Move R (right) to (3,6). Eats the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 10). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 33**: Move R (right) to (4,6). Avoids the risk of moving down (which would trap the head). (4,6) is safe and open. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 34**: Move R (right) to (5,6). Maintains momentum away from potential dead ends and toward open space. (5,6) is safe. Direction remains R.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one positive food, avoids risks, and positions it for future opportunities. After turn 34, the snake should assess the grid to eat (4,5) if vacated (life span allows) or find new food, while avoiding the tail reward danger if head and tail become adjacent.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 31, and I'm the snake AI. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), except for (5,2) which is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). The head direction is Up, meaning the snake was moving upwards to reach (2,5) from (2,4) in the previous turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 5 (so it disappears after 5 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is 5 at turn 31, it will last until turn 35? Let me clarify.\n\nThe life span is given, and it decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at (3,6), life_span=5 at turn 31. After turn 31, it becomes 4, then 3, 2, 1, and disappears after turn 35. Turn 31 is when it has 5 turns left, so it can be eaten from turn 31 to 35 inclusive? Let's think carefully.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, after turn t, L becomes L-1. So it exists as long as L > 0. At turn t, it can be eaten, and after that, L decreases. When L reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (3,6): at turn 31, L=5, so after turn 31, L=4 (still there), ..., after turn 35, L=0, so it disappears at the end of turn 35 or beginning of turn 36? But since we're making moves per turn, I think we consider the state at the start of each turn.\n\nThe food is present on a cell as long as its life span > 0. When the snake head moves to that cell, it eats it at that turn.\n\nSo for (3,6) at turn 31: L=5, so it exists now and for the next 4 turns? Let's calculate:\n\n- Start of turn 31: L=5, food present\n\n- After turn 31 (if not eaten), start of turn 32: L=4\n\n- ...\n\n- Start of turn 35: L=1\n\n- After turn 35 (if not eaten), start of turn 36: L=0, food gone.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 31 to 35 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,5): value 1, life_span 7 at turn 31, so it exists until turn 37 (start of turn 38: L=0).\n\nAnd (2,1): value 1, life_span 10, exists until turn 40.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (2,5), direction Up. So from (2,5), possible moves are Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nFirst, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down. Therefore, cannot move Down immediately.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so playable grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6; but (5,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow, snake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nSo the tail is at (6,3).\n\nCurrent head position: (2,5)\n\nPossible moves from here:\n\n- Up: to (2,6). Is this valid? y=6 is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is the top row, which is playable since y=7 is wall, but y=6 is inside. Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6. x=2 is between 1 and 6, y=6 is between 1 and 6, and not an obstacle, so it should be ok, but is it a wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not, so yes, (2,6) is free.\n\nBut let's check if it's occupied by body. Snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), etc. (2,6) is not in the list, so free.\n\n- Down: to (2,4). But (2,4) is the second segment, which is the body. If head moves to (2,4), it would collide with body, since (2,4) is occupied and not the tail? But we need to consider that after moving, the tail moves, but the head moves first.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to tail, the tail moves away, so it's safe.\n\nIn this case, (2,4) is not the tail; the tail is (6,3). (2,4) is the segment right after head, so if head moves down to (2,4), it would be moving onto a body segment that is not the tail, so collision.\n\nMoreover, since we cannot move opposite to direction, and direction is Up, Down is opposite, so cannot move Down anyway.\n\nCurrent direction Up, so cannot move Down.\n\n- Left: to (1,5). x=1, y=5. x=0 is wall, x=1 is playable, so (1,5) should be free. Is it occupied? Snake positions: all x>=2 except tail at (6,3), so (1,5) not occupied, not wall, so ok.\n\n- Right: to (3,5). (3,5) is not in snake positions? Positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). (3,5) is not listed, so should be free. x=3,y=5, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (2,6), Left to (1,5), Right to (3,5). Down is invalid because opposite direction and body collision.\n\nNow, food locations: (3,6), (4,5), (2,1)\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by the snake body! (4,5) is in the snake positions, it's the fifth segment: positions[4] is (4,5) since head is index 0.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)] so (4,5) is occupied by body.\n\nFood at (4,5) is under the snake body. According to the rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is free, (2,1) is far.\n\nAlso, (4,5) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's plan possible paths.\n\nGoal: eat food safely, avoid dying.\n\nImmediate moves: from (2,5), can go U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go Up to (2,6): that's where food is? Food is at (3,6), not (2,6). (2,6) has no food, I think.\n\nFood is at (3,6), (4,5), (2,1). So (2,6) is empty.\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then from there, possible moves: since I moved up, direction is now Up, so cannot go Down.\n\nFrom (2,6), y=6 is top, so cannot go Up further (y=7 is wall), so only Left, Right, or Down.\n\nBut Down would be to (2,5), which is where I came from, but (2,5) will be empty after I move? When I move to (2,6), the tail moves, but let's see the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten yet, tail moves, so after moving to (2,6), the new positions: head at (2,6), then the previous head (2,5) becomes body, so (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), ... up to (6,3) but the last segment (6,3) is removed since no growth, so tail was (6,3), it moves away.\n\nCurrent positions: indices: 0:head (2,5), 1:(2,4), 2:(3,4), 3:(4,4), 4:(4,5), 5:(5,5), 6:(5,4), 7:(6,4), 8:tail (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,6) without eating, new head: (2,6), then body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) and tail (6,3) is gone, so the new tail is (6,4)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) ] but (6,4) was position 7, and after moving, since no growth, the last segment is removed, so the new snake has one less segment? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo positions: let S be the list [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head.\n\nAfter move to new head position N, new list is [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}], so the last position Pk is removed.\n\nHere k=8, tail is P8.\n\nAfter move to (2,6), new head: (2,6), then P0 (2,5) becomes segment 1, P1 (2,4) becomes segment 2, P2 (3,4) becomes segment 3, P3 (4,4) becomes segment 4, P4 (4,5) becomes segment 5, P5 (5,5) becomes segment 6, P6 (5,4) becomes segment 7, P7 (6,4) becomes segment 8, and P8 (6,3) is removed, so tail is now (6,4)? New positions: head (2,6), then [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) ] so body segments from (2,5) to (6,4), tail at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nFrom (2,5), move Up to (2,6): empty, no food.\n\nThen from (2,6), direction Up, but cannot go Up (wall), cannot go Down (opposite to current direction? Direction is Up, so Down is opposite, cannot. Left to (1,6), or Right to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) has food with L=5.\n\nIf I go to (3,6), I can eat the food.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all options.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (2,6) at turn 31.\n\nThen turn 32: from (2,6), direction Up. Possible moves: Left to (1,6), or Right to (3,6). Cannot go Down or Up.\n\n(1,6) is free? x=1,y=6, not wall, not occupied? After turn 31, positions: as above, head at (2,6), body at (2,5),(2,4),etc., so (1,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) has food.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 32, I eat the food, so snake grows, tail not removed.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nTurn 31: move to (2,6), no eat.\n\nTurn 32: move to (3,6), eat food, so new head at (3,6), and the body: since food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) ] and (6,3) was removed earlier? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 31 move to (2,6) no eat: positions: head (2,6), body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  tail at (6,4) — 9 segments? Original snake had 9 positions, after move no eat, it should have 9 segments but tail moved.\n\nOriginal: 9 positions, after move to new cell without eating, head to new, each body to next, last removed, so length decreases by 1? No.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food, when head moves, tail is removed, so length same, but positions shift.\n\nStart: 9 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,6) no eat: new head at (2,6), then segments 1 to 8 from previous: previous head (2,5) is now segment 1, previous seg1 (2,4) is seg2, ..., previous seg7 (6,4) is seg8, previous seg8 (6,3) is gone, so new snake has 8 segments: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] and (6,4) was previous seg7, now last is (5,4)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions: P0=(2,5), P1=(2,4), P2=(3,4), P3=(4,4), P4=(4,5), P5=(5,5), P6=(5,4), P7=(6,4), P8=(6,3)\n\nAfter move to N=(2,6) no eat: new P0 = N = (2,6), new P1 = old P0 = (2,5), new P2 = old P1 = (2,4), new P3 = old P2 = (3,4), new P4 = old P3 = (4,4), new P5 = old P4 = (4,5), new P6 = old P5 = (5,5), new P7 = old P6 = (5,4), and old P7 and P8 are not included, so new positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] so 8 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nThen turn 32: from (2,6), move to (3,6), which has food, so eat. New head at (3,6), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: new P0 = (3,6), new P1 = old P0 = (2,6), new P2 = old P1 = (2,5), ..., up to new P8 = old P7 = (5,4), so segments: [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] 9 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nAnd food at (3,6) is eaten, so removed.\n\nBut this is one possible path.\n\nI could go directly to (3,6) from current position? From (2,5), if I move Right to (3,5), then from there to (3,6) or other.\n\nLet's list all possible actions for turn 31.\n\nCurrent head (2,5), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,6) - empty\n\n- L: to (1,5) - empty\n\n- R: to (3,5) - empty\n\nD: invalid, opposite direction and body.\n\nNow, from each, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,5) under the body. Since it's under the body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied by the 5th segment, which is part of the body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to have that cell free and head move there.\n\nSince the snake is moving, it might free up at some point.\n\nLet's see the snake's shape. Positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nSo from head (2,5), down to (2,4), right to (3,4), right to (4,4), up to (4,5), right to (5,5), down to (5,4), right to (6,4), down to (6,3).\n\n(4,5) is a corner.\n\nWhen the snake moves, depending on the path, (4,5) might be vacated soon or not.\n\nFor example, if the head moves away, and the body follows, (4,5) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves away.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied by the 5th segment (index 4, since head 0).\n\nWhen the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if the head moves to a new position, the segment that was at (4,5) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (4,4) if no change, but it depends on the movement.\n\nLet's simulate a move.\n\nSuppose at turn 31, I move Right to (3,5).\n\nThen new head at (3,5), direction now Right (since moved right).\n\nThen new positions: head (3,5), then old head (2,5) becomes seg1, old seg1 (2,4) seg2, old seg2 (3,4) seg3, old seg3 (4,4) seg4, old seg4 (4,5) seg5, old seg5 (5,5) seg6, old seg6 (5,4) seg7, old seg7 (6,4) seg8, and old seg8 (6,3) removed, so tail at (6,4)? New positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4).\n\n(4,5) is still occupied, by seg5 now.\n\nIf I move Left to (1,5), new head (1,5), direction Left, new positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4), (6,4) and (6,3) gone.\n\n(4,5) occupied.\n\nIf I move Up to (2,6), as before, new positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4), (4,5) occupied.\n\nIn all cases, after one move, (4,5) is still occupied because it's not the tail yet; the tail is at (5,4) or earlier.\n\nThe segment at (4,5) will move when the snake moves, but it might take time to free the cell.\n\nFor example, if the snake keeps moving, eventually the segment that was at (4,5) will become the tail and move away, but it depends on the path.\n\nSince the snake has 8 segments after one move no eat, the cell (4,5) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so it will be freed only when that segment is no longer part of the body, i.e., when it becomes the tail and is removed or moved.\n\nBut it might take several turns.\n\n(4,5) food has life span 7, so it has time.\n\nBut I need to think about eating other food.\n\nNow, the food at (3,6) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 35. Turn 31,32,33,34,35 it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has more time.\n\nAlso, I should consider the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (6,3), head at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nNow, let's plan for the next few turns.\n\nFirst, I should consider going for the food at (3,6) since it has shorter life span.\n\nFrom current position (2,5), I can go directly to (3,6) in one move? No, not adjacent; (2,5) to (3,6) is diagonal, not allowed; only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo I need to move to (3,5) or (2,6) first, then to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) is empty, (2,6) is empty.\n\nIf I move to (3,5) first: at turn 31, move Right to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move Up to (3,6) to eat the food on turn 32.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nTurn 31: move R to (3,5). Direction was Up, now moving Right, so new direction Right.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail at (5,4)? As above, 8 segments.\n\n(4,5) is still occupied.\n\nNow, (3,6) has food, and it's free.\n\nTurn 32: from (3,5), direction Right, can move U to (3,6), or D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is occupied by body? Positions: after turn 31, positions are [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ]\n\nSo (3,4) is position 3, occupied.\n\n(2,5) is position 1, occupied.\n\n(4,5) is position 5, occupied.\n\n(3,6) is free.\n\nSo from (3,5), can move U to (3,6) which is free and has food.\n\nMove U, direction from Right to Up? Current direction is Right, moving Up is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen eat food at (3,6).\n\nNew positions: head to (3,6), food eaten, so tail not removed. New body: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] so 9 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nAnd (3,6) food eaten, gone.\n\nThis seems fine, and I get +1 score.\n\nBut is there any risk? At (3,6), it's near the top, but y=6 is ok.\n\nFrom (3,6), I need to move next.\n\nBut first, let's see other options.\n\nIf from (2,5) I move U to (2,6) at turn 31, then turn 32 move R to (3,6) to eat, as I thought earlier.\n\nIn that case, I eat on turn 32.\n\nBut in the first option, if I move R to (3,5) on turn 31, then U to (3,6) on turn 32, I also eat on turn 32.\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 32.\n\nBut moving directly to (3,5) might be better because it's closer to other areas.\n\nNow, what about the food at (4,5)? It's under the body, so I need to free it first.\n\nCurrently, after moving, (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nIn the new positions after eating (3,6), tail is at (5,4), and (4,5) is occupied.\n\nTo free (4,5), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (4,5) moves away and no one is there.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince I ate food, the snake is longer, so (4,5) might stay occupied longer.\n\nI should consider not eating (3,6) immediately and go for other things, but it has short life span, only 5 turns, so I should eat it soon.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 31, so I have until turn 35 to eat it. Turn 31,32,33,34,35.\n\nI can eat it on turn 32 or later.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother option: move Left to (1,5) at turn 31.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go to (1,6) or (1,4) or (2,5), but (2,5) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail at (5,4).\n\nThen from (1,5), direction Left, can move U to (1,6), D to (1,4), R to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, so invalid, or L but x=0 wall, so only U or D.\n\n(1,6) free, (1,4) free probably.\n\nBut no food there, and (3,6) is still there, but I'm at (1,5), not close.\n\nSo moving Left might lead me away from food, not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving Up to (2,6) then I have to go to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut moving Right to (3,5) directly seems better for accessing (3,6).\n\nNow, after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6), with tail at (5,4), and the snake is long.\n\nFrom (3,6), direction after moving Up to it, so direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: U but y=7 wall, so cannot. D to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body? After eating, positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] so (3,5) is seg1, occupied, so cannot move Down to (3,5) because body collision.\n\nL to (2,6)? (2,6) is not occupied? Positions: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), etc., no (2,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n\nR to (4,6)? (4,6) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo from (3,6), direction Up, can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6). Cannot move D or U.\n\nNow, both (2,6) and (4,6) are empty.\n\nIf I move to (4,6), then I am closer to the right side.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) under the body, but (4,5) is currently occupied in this position.\n\nIn positions, (4,5) is seg6, occupied.\n\nSo I need to free it.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the snake body moves away from (4,5).\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,1), which is far, at the bottom left.\n\ny=1, x=2.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut I need to survive and eat.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), so I need to avoid that.\n\nNow, back to turn 31 decision.\n\nI think moving to (3,5) or to (2,6) both allow me to eat (3,6) on turn 32.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) might be better because from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) directly.\n\nIf I go to (2,6) first, then to (3,6), same thing.\n\nBut from (3,5), after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6), and (3,5) is behind me.\n\nWhereas from (2,6), after eating (3,6), (2,6) is behind.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating (3,6) immediately and go for other food, but since it has short life, I should eat it.\n\nLet's check if there is danger in eating it.\n\nFor example, after eating, at (3,6), I can only move left or right, both are safe for now.\n\nThen from there, I can plan to go down or something.\n\nBut the body is below, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nSuppose at turn 31, I move R to (3,5).\n\nTurn 31: move R to (3,5), no eat, positions as before, 8 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nDirection Right.\n\nTurn 32: move U to (3,6), eat food, new positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] 9 segments, tail at (5,4). Direction Up.\n\nNow turn 33: from (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay I move R to (4,6).\n\nThen move to (4,6), no food there, so no eat, new positions: head to (4,6), body: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ] and tail at (5,5)? New head (4,6), new P1 old P0 (3,6), new P2 old P1 (3,5), new P3 old P2 (2,5), new P4 old P3 (2,4), new P5 old P4 (3,4), new P6 old P5 (4,4), new P7 old P6 (4,5), new P8 old P7 (5,5), and old P8 (5,4) removed, so tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,5) is now new P7, still occupied.\n\nDirection after moving to (4,6) is Right? From (3,6) to (4,6) is Right, so direction Right.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6), direction Right, can move U: cannot, wall; D to (4,5); L to (3,6); R to (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is occupied by body, position new P7, so cannot move there.\n\n(3,6) is position new P1, occupied.\n\n(5,6) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nR to (5,6).\n\nThen move to (5,6), no food, so new positions: head (5,6), body: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) ] tail at (4,5)? New P0 (5,6), new P1 old P0 (4,6), new P2 old P1 (3,6), new P3 old P2 (3,5), new P4 old P3 (2,5), new P5 old P4 (2,4), new P6 old P5 (3,4), new P7 old P6 (4,4), new P8 old P7 (4,5), so tail at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is now tail.\n\nDirection to (5,6) is Right.\n\nTurn 35: from (5,6), direction Right, can move D to (5,5), L to (4,6), or U cannot, R to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is occupied? Positions: (5,6) head, (4,6), (3,6), etc., (5,5) not listed, so free? Let's see: new positions have (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) so (5,5) is not there, should be free.\n\n(4,6) is body, occupied.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\nSo can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), (5,5) is free, no food, so eat? No, only if food there, but no.\n\nFood at (4,5) is on the tail cell, but (4,5) is tail now.\n\nBut head is at (5,6), tail at (4,5), not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nMove to (5,5), then new positions, etc.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nBack to turn 31.\n\nAnother choice: move to (1,5) but that seems worse.\n\nOr, I could go down towards (2,1) but I can't move down from (2,5) because opposite direction and body.\n\nSo only U, L, R possible.\n\nR to (3,5) seems good.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (4,5).\n\nIt has life span 7, so after turn 31, it has 6 turns left? At turn 31, L=7, so exists until turn 37.\n\nAfter I eat (3,6), the snake is longer, and (4,5) is occupied, but if I can free it later.\n\nFor example, in the above path, at turn 35, (4,5) is tail, but if I move the tail, I can eat the food if head goes there.\n\nBut (4,5) has food, and if head moves to it, I can eat it.\n\nBut the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut if head moves to tail cell, and tail cell has food, when I eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the same cell as the old tail, so collision.\n\nYes, deadly.\n\nSo to eat food on tail cell, the head must not be adjacent to tail when moving there, so that after moving, the tail moves away.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that has food and is the current tail, then when I eat, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell, collision.\n\nTherefore, I should only eat food on tail cell if the head is not moving directly to it when it's tail, but rather, I need to have the cell free and head move to it after the tail has moved.\n\nBut if the cell is tail, and I move head to it, it's occupied, so I can't move there unless it's free.\n\nThe tail cell is occupied, so head cannot move to it because it's occupied by tail.\n\nOnly when the tail moves away, the cell is free, then head can move to it if food is there.\n\nFor (4,5), when it is vacated, if food is still there, I can eat it.\n\nIn the current state, (4,5) is occupied by body, not tail.\n\nWhen it becomes tail and moves away, the cell is free, then if food is there, I can go eat it.\n\nBut the food has a life span, so I need to do it before it disappears.\n\nNow, in the snake, the segment at (4,5) will become tail after some moves.\n\nFor example, in the current snake, after one move no eat, the tail is at (5,4) or (6,4), etc., but (4,5) is not tail.\n\nThe position (4,5) is occupied by a segment that will move when the snake moves.\n\nEventually, as the snake moves, each segment will become tail after k moves, depending on the length.\n\nBut the length changes if I eat food.\n\nTo free (4,5), I need the segment that is there to be the last one, and when it moves, the cell is vacated.\n\nSince the snake is moving, it will happen eventually if I don't eat food, but if I eat, it takes longer.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat any food, after 8 moves, the cell will be free, but with food eaten, it takes more moves.\n\nBut I have other food to eat.\n\nPerhaps for now, I should eat the available food at (3,6) and then plan to free (4,5) later.\n\n(2,1) is also an option, but far.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see the grid size: 6x6, from (1,1) to (6,6), with (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSnake is at top-left, food at bottom-left (2,1).\n\nI need to navigate down.\n\nBut from current position, I can't go down directly.\n\nAnother idea: from (2,5), if I move Left to (1,5), then I can go down to (1,4), etc., towards (2,1).\n\nBut (3,6) will disappear soon, so I might miss it.\n\nSince (3,6) has only 5 turns left, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nSo I think moving to eat (3,6) on turn 32 is good.\n\nNow, for turn 31, I can move to (3,5) or to (2,6).\n\nMoving to (3,5) might be better because it's not on the edge.\n\nIf I move to (2,6), I am on the top row, which might limit movement.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6), then I can only go left or right, same as before.\n\nBut from (3,5), before eating, I can go to (3,6) or other directions.\n\nAt turn 31, if I move to (3,5), I can choose not to eat (3,6) immediately, but go down or something, but (3,4) is occupied, so from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4) but it's occupied, or left to (2,5) occupied, or right to (4,5) occupied, so only up to (3,6) is free, so I have to go there to avoid collision, essentially forced to eat it on turn 32.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,6) on turn 31, from there only left or right, and right to (3,6) is the only way to food or to empty cell.\n\n(1,6) is empty but no food.\n\nSo in both cases, I end up eating (3,6) on turn 32.\n\nSo for turn 31, moving R to (3,5) or U to (2,6) both lead to eating on turn 32.\n\nBut moving R to (3,5) might be preferred because it's not on the border.\n\nNow, after eating, at (3,6), I need to move.\n\nAs before, I can go to (2,6) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is closer to the right side.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) under body.\n\nLet's see when (4,5) can be free.\n\nIn the positions after eating (3,6), (4,5) is occupied.\n\nThe segment at (4,5) is position 6 in the list (index 6, since head 0).\n\nTo become tail, it needs to be the last segment, which will happen after 6 moves if no food eaten, or more if I eat.\n\nBut I can plan to move in a way that the snake shortens or something.\n\nSince the snake is long, I might have space issues.\n\nThe grid is 6x6, 36 cells, minus walls, but borders are walls, internal (5,2) obstacle, so free cells: 6x6=36, minus 1 for (5,2), so 35 cells? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, 6x6=36 cells, (5,2) is wall, so 35 free cells.\n\nSnake has 9 segments after eating, so 26 free cells, not too bad.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) and (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has life span 7, so at turn 31, L=7, exists until turn 37.\n\nAfter eating (3,6) on turn 32, at turn 32, (4,5) food L=6 (since decreased each turn), so it has until turn 37 to be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) L=10 at turn 31, so until turn 40.\n\nNow, from (3,6) after eating, I am at (3,6), I can move to (4,6) or (2,6).\n\nSuppose I move to (4,6) on turn 33.\n\nThen as before, positions, etc.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move to (5,6) on turn 34, then to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) might be free.\n\n(5,5) was food position? No, food is at (4,5), not (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is empty.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6) on turn 34, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is tail, and it has food.\n\nBut head at (5,6), tail at (4,5), which are adjacent: (5,6) and (4,5) are not adjacent; (5,6) to (4,5) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (5,6) adjacent to (5,5), (4,6), (6,6), (5,7) but y=7 wall.\n\nSo (4,5) is not adjacent to (5,6); they are diagonal, so not connected.\n\nTherefore, no tail reward danger here.\n\nThen on turn 35, from (5,6), I can move to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nIf I move to (5,5), (5,5) is free, no food, so no eat.\n\nThen new positions, tail moves, (4,5) is vacated, and if food is there, it is now free.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), no eat, new head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), etc., and tail (4,5) moves away, so (4,5) cell is free, and food is there, so I can later move to (4,5) to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 35, after moving to (5,5), the cell (4,5) is free and has food.\n\nThen from (5,5), on turn 36, I can move to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I move to (4,5), head is at (5,5), tail at (4,5)? Let's see.\n\nBefore turn 35 move: positions at start of turn 35: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail.\n\nMove to (5,5): (5,5) is free, so move there, no food, so no eat. New positions: head (5,5), then old head (5,6) becomes seg1, old seg1 (4,6) seg2, ..., up to old seg7 (4,4) seg8, old seg8 (4,5) removed, so new tail is old seg7 (4,4)? List:\n\nOld positions: P0=(5,6), P1=(4,6), P2=(3,6), P3=(3,5), P4=(2,5), P5=(2,4), P6=(3,4), P7=(4,4), P8=(4,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no eat: new P0 = (5,5), new P1 = old P0 = (5,6), new P2 = old P1 = (4,6), new P3 = old P2 = (3,6), new P4 = old P3 = (3,5), new P5 = old P4 = (2,5), new P6 = old P5 = (2,4), new P7 = old P6 = (3,4), new P8 = old P7 = (4,4), and old P8 (4,5) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] tail at (4,4).\n\nAnd (4,5) is now free, with food present.\n\nOn turn 36, from (5,5), I can move to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nHead at (5,5), move to (4,5), which is adjacent and free.\n\nDirection: from (5,6) to (5,5) was Down, so direction Down.\n\nMove to (4,5), which is Left? (5,5) to (4,5) is Left, not opposite to Down, so ok.\n\nThen move to (4,5), eat food, so snake grows, new head (4,5), and tail not removed, so new positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] and since ate, length increases, tail at (4,4).\n\nAnd food eaten.\n\nBut (4,4) is now body.\n\nIn this case, I ate the food safely.\n\nSimilarly, I could have gone to (2,1) later.\n\nBut in this path, I ate both foods.\n\nNow for turn 31, if I move to (3,5), I can achieve this.\n\nIf I moved to (2,6) on turn 31, then to (3,6) on 32, then from (3,6) I could go to (4,6) on 33, same as above.\n\nSo both are similar.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) on turn 31 might be slightly better because it's not on the edge.\n\nSince the answer requires actions for multiple turns, I need to output actions from turn 31 onwards.\n\nThe format is to output for turn 31, 32, etc., up to 5 turns or so? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions starting from turn 31.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output; it says \"Turn t1: action ...\" so probably for the immediate turns, but since I need to think ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows multiple turns, but for the response, I need to provide actions for turn 31 and possibly future turns, but it might be that I only need to decide for turn 31, but since it says to think ahead, I should provide a sequence based on the plan.\n\nThe user says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer is to list actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nFor this response, I need to output the action for turn 31 and then the next few turns based on the plan.\n\nSince the state might change, but in this case, I need to assume no new food or changes, so I can plan a sequence.\n\nThe problem doesn't say new food spawns, so only existing food.\n\nSo I can plan multiple turns.\n\nBut to be safe, I can provide a sequence.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nIn the path above, I didn't go near it, so ok.\n\nAlso, (2,1) food, I can go there later.\n\nBut for now, let's confirm turn 31 action.\n\nI think moving Right to (3,5) is good.\n\nThen turn 32: Up to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 33: from (3,6), I can go to (4,6) as above.\n\nThen turn 34: to (5,6)\n\nTurn 35: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut turn 36 is beyond 5 turns from 31? 31 to 36 is 6 turns, but I can output up to where I have plan.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) might be eaten earlier, but in this case, it works.\n\nAfter turn 35, at (5,5), I move to (4,5) on turn 36.\n\nBut in turn 35, I moved to (5,5), and (4,5) is free.\n\nFor the answer, I need to start from turn 31.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there is a shorter way to eat (4,5).\n\nFor example, after eating (3,6) on turn 32, at (3,6), instead of going to (4,6), I could go to (2,6), but that might not help for (4,5).\n\n(2,6) is left, then I can go down, but (2,5) is body, etc.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the path to (4,6) seems fine.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,5), I can go towards (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at bottom left.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I am at (4,5), with tail at (4,4) or something.\n\nBut I can head down.\n\nNow, for turn 31, I'll go with Right to (3,5).\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nTurn 32: U (to eat (3,6))\n\nThen turn 33: from (3,6) to (4,6), so R\n\nTurn 34: to (5,6), R\n\nTurn 35: to (5,5), D (since from (5,6) to (5,5) is Down)\n\nThen turn 36: to (4,5), L (from (5,5) to (4,5) is Left)\n\nBut turn 36 might be too far, and I only need to output for a few turns, but since the format allows, I can do.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (4,5) food, at turn 32 after eating (3,6), L=6 for (4,5)? At turn 31, (4,5) L=7.\n\nAfter turn 31, if I don't eat it, L decreases to 6 at turn 32, etc.\n\nAt turn 36, it would be L=7 - (36-31) = but from turn 31 to 36, 5 turns passed? Turn 31: L=7\n\nAfter turn 31: L=6 (start turn 32)\n\nAfter turn 32: L=5 (start turn 33)\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 35: L=2 (start turn 36)\n\nAfter turn 36: if not eaten, L=1, then after turn 37: L=0, gone.\n\nAt turn 36, start of turn, L=2, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, in my plan, I eat on turn 36.\n\nI could eat earlier, but in this case, it's fine.\n\nAnother option: from (3,6) after eating, instead of going right, go left to (2,6), but then (4,5) might not be freed soon.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,6) on turn 33, then to (1,6) or (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, so to (1,6), then down to (1,5), etc., but (4,5) is still occupied, and I might not free it in time.\n\nSo going right is better.\n\nTherefore, I think the plan is solid.\n\nNow for turn 31, action is R.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is Up, moving Right is perpendicular, so ok, not opposite.\n\nSo valid.\n\nSimilarly, all moves.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 31: R (right)\n\nTurn 32: U (up) to eat (3,6)\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can include.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\" and \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 31 to 35.\n\nBut in turn 35, in my plan, I am at (5,5), moving down from (5,6).\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn 31: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: U to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 33: R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 34: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 35: D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 36: L to (4,5) eat, but beyond 5.\n\nFor 5 turns, up to turn 35.\n\nIn turn 35, I move to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nI could output up to turn 35.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 35, I haven't eaten (4,5) yet, but it's ok.\n\nTo eat (4,5) earlier, but I think it's fine.\n\nAnother path: after eating (3,6) at turn 32, at (3,6), I could move down? But cannot, because (3,5) is body.\n\nSo must move left or right.\n\nI think R is good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 31, I will move Right.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (3,6) has a short life span (5 turns, disappearing after turn 35) and must be eaten soon. The food at (4,5) is under the snake's body and can only be eaten once the cell is vacated; it has a longer life span (7 turns, disappearing after turn 37), so it can be targeted later. The food at (2,1) has ample time (life span 10, disappearing after turn 40) and can be pursued after securing the more urgent food.\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 31)**: From the head at (2,5) with direction Up, possible moves are Up (to (2,6)), Left (to (1,5)), or Right (to (3,5)). Down is invalid due to opposite direction and body collision at (2,4). Moving Right to (3,5) positions the snake to eat (3,6) on turn 32 efficiently and avoids the edge, providing better maneuverability.\n- **Eating (3,6) on Turn 32**: From (3,5), moving Up to (3,6) eats the food safely, increasing length and score by +1.\n- **Subsequent Moves (Turns 33-35)**: After eating (3,6), moving Right to (4,6) and then to (5,6) avoids body collisions and heads toward the area near (4,5) to prepare for eating it later. On turn 35, moving Down to (5,5) vacates (4,5) (freeing the cell for future eating) and positions the snake to eat (4,5) on turn 36.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. The tail reward danger is not triggered, as the head is never adjacent to the tail when targeting food. The path also avoids the internal obstacle at (5,2) and maintains space for future movement toward (2,1).\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 31-35):**\n- Turn 31: Move Right (R) to (3,5) – Positions for eating (3,6) next turn.\n- Turn 32: Move Up (U) to (3,6) – Eat positive food (+1 score, length increases).\n- Turn 33: Move Right (R) to (4,6) – Head toward the right side to access (4,5) later.\n- Turn 34: Move Right (R) to (5,6) – Continue path; (4,5) will be vacated soon.\n- Turn 35: Move Down (D) to (5,5) – Vacate (4,5); sets up to eat (4,5) on turn 36.\n\nThis sequence ensures the critical food at (3,6) is eaten before it expires, while setting up to eat (4,5) and eventually (2,1) for maximum score. Beyond turn 35, the next move would be Left to (4,5) on turn 36 to eat that food if still present.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 31: R (right)\nTurn 32: U (up)\nTurn 33: R (right)\nTurn 34: R (right)\nTurn 35: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn 32:\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n- Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), and the body segments are: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]. So the snake has 9 segments.\n\n- Head direction is R, which means right. So it's moving to the east.\n\n- Food:\n  - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n  - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n  - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food is positive since value is 1, and no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: For (3,6), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn 32. So it will be gone by turn 35? Let's clarify: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 32, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left, including turn 32. So it will disappear after turn 35? After turn 32, life span becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 32, 33, 34, or 35? No.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it's present for N more turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is L at turn t, after turn t, life span becomes L-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0. So it is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor example, turn t=32, life span=4: available on turns 32, 33, 34, and disappears after turn 34, so not on turn 35.\n\n- Turn 32: life span=4, can be eaten\n- Turn 33: life span=3, can be eaten\n- Turn 34: life span=2, can be eaten\n- Turn 35: life span=1, can be eaten? No, after turn 34, when life span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it is removed after N turns have passed, including the current one.\n\nStandard interpretation: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N, after the turn, countdown becomes N-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it is present as long as countdown > 0.\n\n- At turn t, countdown = N, present\n- After turn t, countdown = N-1\n- At turn t+1, if countdown N-1 > 0, present, etc.\n- When countdown becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nFor food at (3,6) with life span 4 at turn 32:\n- Turn 32: countdown=4, present\n- Turn 33: countdown=3, present\n- Turn 34: countdown=2, present\n- Turn 35: countdown=1, present\n- Turn 36: countdown=0, disappears, so not present\n\nCountdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 32, it decreases to 4? The rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but when does it decrease? At the end of the turn or beginning?\n\nI think it's better to think that at the start of turn t, the life span is given, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nBut the rule says \"including current\", so during turn t, the countdown is N, and after actions, it decreases.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that at the beginning of turn t, life span L means it has L turns left, including turn t, so it can be eaten on turn t to t+L-1.\n\nFor (3,6): life span 4 at turn 32, so available turns: 32,33,34,35? 32 to 35 is 4 turns? Turn 32,33,34,35: that's four turns.\n\nBut countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 32, after decrease, it becomes 3? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me not overcomplicate. I'll assume that with life span N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it is present for the next N turns starting from t.\n\nSo for (3,6): available on turns 32,33,34 (since life span 4, disappears after 4 turns from now? \"after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at turn t, life span N, it can be eaten on turn t, and will be there until turn t + N - 1, disappearing at turn t + N.\n\nBut let's look at the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" for turn t, with life span given.\n\nI think for planning, I can consider the remaining life.\n\nFor (3,6): life span 4 at turn 32, so it can be eaten on turn 32, and if not, on 33 with life span 3, etc., up to turn 35 with life span 1, and then disappears on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut to be precise, let's say:\n- (3,6): available from turn 32 to 35 inclusive\n- (4,5): life span 6, available from 32 to 37 inclusive\n- (2,1): life span 9, available from 32 to 40 inclusive\n\nNow, food at (4,5): but (4,5) is occupied by the snake body! Snake positions include (4,5), which is the 6th segment? Let's list snake positions: indices 0 to 8: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4). So (4,5) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 6.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,5), since it's under the body, I can only eat it if that body segment moves away, and then I move the head there.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (3,6) is empty, I think, and (2,1) is empty.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns, but walls are at borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No.\n\nCells occupied by walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is a wall. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is also wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nSo playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (3,5), moving right (direction R).\n\nCurrent direction is R, so from (3,5), moving right would be to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by a body segment? Snake positions: head (3,5), then body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) is the 5th segment? Let's list with indices:\n\n- 0: (3,5) head\n\n- 1: (2,5)\n\n- 2: (2,4)\n\n- 3: (3,4)\n\n- 4: (4,4)\n\n- 5: (4,5)\n\n- 6: (5,5)\n\n- 7: (5,4)\n\n- 8: (6,4) tail\n\nSo (4,5) is segment 5, which is not the tail; tail is (6,4).\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is under segment 5, so it can't be eaten immediately because the body is there. To eat it, I need segment to move away, then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,6): (3,6) is not occupied by snake, so I can move there directly if possible.\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6. Is it within bounds? y=6, border is y=7 and y=0, but walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since walls are the cells where x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (3,6) has y=6, which is not y=0 or y=7, so it's not a wall cell. Similarly, x=3, not border, so (3,6) is valid and empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): x=2,y=1, not border, not obstacle, empty.\n\nAnd (4,5) has food under it, but occupied.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction R, so from (3,5), possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because L is opposite? Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) immediately.\n\nPossible actions: U (up, to (3,6)), D (down, to (3,4)), R (right, to (4,5)).\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by body segment 5, so if I move R to (4,5), it would be a body collision, since it's not the tail.\n\nTail is at (6,4), so (4,5) is a body part, not tail.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since tail will move forward.\n\nHere, (4,5) is not tail, tail is (6,4), so moving to (4,5) would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, from (3,5), moving R to (4,5) is invalid because collision.\n\nMoving D to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by segment 3, which is body, not tail, so also collision.\n\nSnake positions: (3,4) is segment 3, yes.\n\nMoving U to (3,6): (3,6) is empty, and has food? (3,6) has food with value 1.\n\n(3,6) is the position of one of the foods.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U: to (3,6) – empty, has food\n\n- D: to (3,4) – occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: to (4,5) – occupied by body, collision\n\n- L: to (2,5) – but (2,5) is occupied by segment 1, body, collision? And also, moving L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L anyway because of no instant reverse.\n\nCannot move opposite direction, so L is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is U to (3,6).\n\nIs that right?\n\nCurrent head position (3,5), direction R.\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and new segment added.\n\nBut for collision, when moving, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if that cell is the current tail position, because after moving, the tail leaves that cell.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, only if the cell is the tail, it's safe.\n\nIn this case, from (3,5), moving to:\n\n- (3,6): empty, safe\n\n- (3,4): occupied by segment (3,4), which is not tail (tail is (6,4)), so collision\n\n- (4,5): occupied by segment (4,5), not tail, collision\n\n- (2,5): occupied by segment (2,5), not tail, and also cannot move L because opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, indeed, only possible move is U to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) has food, so if I move there, I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 32, I must move to (3,6) because it's the only choice.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: let's sketch for clarity.\n\ny from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nPlayable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is wall.\n\nCurrent snake positions:\n\n- (3,5) head\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,4) tail\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), moving U to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is within bounds, not wall, and has food with value 1, life span 4.\n\nIf I move to (3,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (3,6), and the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (3,6), then previous head (3,5) becomes segment 1, then (2,5) seg2, (2,4) seg3, (3,4) seg4, (4,4) seg5, (4,5) seg6, (5,5) seg7, (5,4) seg8, (6,4) tail, and since food eaten, add new segment at tail, so tail stays at (6,4) but a new segment is added at the previous tail position? Standard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one.\n\nPositions: after eating, head at new position, then the previous positions, and tail remains, so length increases.\n\nFor example, before move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., P8] with P0 head, P8 tail.\n\nAfter moving to new cell C:\n\n- If C not food, new positions: [C, P0, P1, ..., P7], so P8 is removed.\n\n- If C is food, new positions: [C, P0, P1, ..., P8], so tail P8 stays, and new segment added, length +1.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,6), which is food, so new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4). So 10 segments, tail at (6,4).\n\nAnd food at (3,6) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, after this move, head is at (3,6), and direction was moving up, so new head direction is U.\n\nNow, for turn 33, I need to choose action.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the food:\n\n- (3,6): eaten at turn 32, gone.\n\n- (4,5): still there, under body? At turn 32, (4,5) has food, but occupied. After turn 32, snake moves: when I move head to (3,6), the body segments shift.\n\nAt turn 32, before move, segment at (4,5) is position 5.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) and eating, the new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5) [was head], (2,5) [was seg1], (2,4) [was seg2], (3,4) [was seg3], (4,4) [was seg4], (4,5) [was seg5], (5,5) [was seg6], (5,4) [was seg7], (6,4) [was tail, now seg8?].\n\nList:\n\nNew positions after turn 32:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,5)  // previous head\n\n- Segment 2: (2,5)  // previous seg1\n\n- Segment 3: (2,4)  // previous seg2\n\n- Segment 4: (3,4)  // previous seg3\n\n- Segment 5: (4,4)  // previous seg4\n\n- Segment 6: (4,5)  // previous seg5\n\n- Segment 7: (5,5)  // previous seg6\n\n- Segment 8: (5,4)  // previous seg7\n\n- Segment 9: (6,4)  // previous tail, now new segment? Since food eaten, tail stayed.\n\nIn the new positions, (6,4) is still there, and since food eaten, we add a new segment, so the tail is still (6,4), but it's now segment 9, and the position is occupied.\n\nFood at (4,5): at turn 32, before move, (4,5) had food and was occupied.\n\nAfter move, segment 6 is at (4,5), so the food is still under the body? But the food is on the cell, not moving.\n\nAfter the snake moves, the cell (4,5) is now occupied by segment 6, and the food is still there, I assume, since not eaten.\n\nFood at (4,5) has life span 6, so at turn 32, it was there, and after turn, life span decreases to 5 at turn 33.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut for (4,5), it is still under the snake body at segment 6.\n\nTo eat it, I need the body to move away from (4,5), then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly, other food at (2,1) is free.\n\nNow, at turn 33, head at (3,6), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves from (3,6):\n\n- U: to (3,7) – but y=7 is wall, since border, so invalid, collision with wall.\n\n- D: to (3,5) – (3,5) is occupied by segment 1, which is body, not tail. Tail is at (6,4), so (3,5) is segment 1, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- L: to (2,6) – (2,6) is what? Let's see if occupied.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4)\n\nSo (2,6) is not in the list, and not wall? x=2,y=6, not border (x=0,7 or y=0,7 walls), so y=6 is not wall, x=2 not wall, and not obstacle, so empty. And no food there.\n\n- R: to (4,6) – (4,6) not occupied, not wall, empty.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite? Current direction U, opposite is D, but D is not possible anyway, but moving D is opposite, but it's invalid due to collision, so not an option.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (3,5) occupied by seg1, not tail, collision, invalid\n\n- L: to (2,6) empty, valid\n\n- R: to (4,6) empty, valid\n\nSo I can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nNow, need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food available: (4,5) with life span 5 at turn 33 (since decreased), but under body at seg6.\n\n(2,1) with life span 8 at turn 33? At turn 32, life span 9, after turn 32, decreases to 8 for turn 33.\n\nLife span at turn t: for turn 33, food at (4,5) has life span 5 (was 6 at 32, decrease to 5), and (2,1) life span 8 (was 9, decrease to 8).\n\nNow, to eat (4,5), I need to free up (4,5) first. Currently occupied by seg6.\n\nThe snake will move, so each turn, segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I move head to (2,6) at turn 33, then new positions: since no food at (2,6), head moves to (2,6), then body: seg1 to (3,6)? After move: head to new position, then previous head becomes segment 1, etc.\n\nAfter turn 33, if move to (2,6):\n\n- Head to (2,6)\n\n- Then previous positions: [ (3,6) head becomes seg1, (3,5) seg1 becomes seg2, (2,5) seg2 becomes seg3, (2,4) seg3 becomes seg4, (3,4) seg4 becomes seg5, (4,4) seg5 becomes seg6, (4,5) seg6 becomes seg7, (5,5) seg7 becomes seg8, (5,4) seg8 becomes seg9, (6,4) seg9 is tail, but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4) — tail at (5,4), since (6,4) removed.\n\n(6,4) was seg9, not removed because no food, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] with tail at (5,4).\n\n(4,5) is now occupied by seg7, still under body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (4,6), similar thing.\n\nBut at (4,6), no food, so after move: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), etc., down to tail.\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nTo free (4,5), I need the segment there to move away.\n\nCurrently at turn 33, (4,5) has seg7? After turn 32, positions: seg6 at (4,5) for turn 33 state? Let's keep track.\n\nAt turn 33 start, positions from above after turn 32: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,4), seg4 (3,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4)\n\nSo at turn 33, (4,5) occupied by seg6.\n\nWhen I move the head, the body shifts, so if I move head to (2,6), as above, after move, (4,5) is occupied by seg7 (which was seg6, but shifted).\n\nIn the new positions, (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,6), same.\n\nThe only way to free (4,5) is to have the tail move away or something, but tail is at (6,4), far away.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the segment at (4,5) will eventually move, but it might take time.\n\nFor example, if I keep moving, the body will shift, and the segment at (4,5) will move to the next position.\n\nAt turn 33, if I move head to L or R, the segment at (4,5) will move to where seg5 was or something.\n\nIn general, to free a cell under body, I need to move the snake so that the body segment leaves that cell and no new segment comes immediately, but since the snake moves as a whole, when a segment leaves a cell, it might be free for a turn before head or something moves there, but for food, it needs to be free and then head moves there.\n\nSpecifically, for cell (4,5), it is occupied now. When the segment that is there moves away, if no other segment moves in immediately, it becomes free, then I can move head there later.\n\nBut in the next turns, the cell might be occupied by different segments.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, at turn 33, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nI need to choose move: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,1), which is far, life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I should consider eating (4,5) if possible.\n\nNow, (4,5) is currently occupied, so I need to plan to free it and then eat.\n\nBut life span is 5 at turn 33, so available until turn 37? Life span 5 at turn 33, so can be eaten on turns 33,34,35,36,37? Turn 33 to 37 inclusive, 5 turns.\n\nAt turn 33, countdown 5, present; turn 34, countdown 4; ... turn 37, countdown 1; turn 38 countdown 0, disappear. So available turns 33 to 37.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) available turns 33 to 40.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 33.\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), then head to (2,6), no food, so snake shortens? No, no food, so tail removed, but length same.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) with tail at (5,4). (6,4) removed.\n\n(4,5) occupied by seg7.\n\nThen at turn 34, head at (2,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nU to (2,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by seg3? Positions: seg3 is (2,5) in new list? After turn 33 move to (2,6): positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4)\n\nSo (2,5) is seg3, body, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n\nMoving D to (2,5) would collide with seg3.\n\nL to (1,6): x=1,y=6, not border, empty? Assuming no obstacle, so possible.\n\nR to (3,6): but (3,6) is occupied by seg1, body, not tail, collision. And also, moving R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed anyway.\n\nCurrent direction L, opposite R, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (2,5) occupied, collision, invalid\n\n- L: to (1,6) empty, valid\n\n- R: not allowed, opposite\n\nSo only move L to (1,6).\n\nThen turn 34: move to (1,6), no food there, so new positions: head (1,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,4), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (5,5) with tail at (5,5)? After move, tail removed: previous tail (5,4) removed, so positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) with tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,5) now occupied by seg8.\n\nStill occupied.\n\nThen turn 35, head at (1,6), direction L (since moved left again).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,7) wall invalid, D to (1,5) empty? (1,5) not occupied, not wall, so valid, L to (0,6) x=0 wall invalid, R to (2,6) occupied by seg1, body, collision, and opposite direction? Current direction L, R is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move D to (1,5).\n\nAnd so on. I'm going to the bottom-left, away from the food.\n\nIf at turn 33 I move R to (4,6) instead.\n\nTurn 33: move R to (4,6), no food, so new positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4) with tail at (5,4).\n\n(4,5) occupied by seg7.\n\nHead at (4,6), direction R.\n\nTurn 34, possible moves: U to (4,7) wall invalid, D to (4,5) occupied by seg7, body, not tail, collision invalid, L to (3,6) occupied by seg1, body, collision, and opposite direction? Current direction R, L is opposite, so not allowed. R to (5,6) empty? (5,6) not occupied, not wall, so valid.\n\nSo only move R to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 34: move to (5,6), no food, positions: head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,4), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (5,5) with tail at (5,5).\n\n(4,5) occupied by seg8.\n\nThen turn 35, head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) wall invalid, D to (5,5) occupied by seg9, which is tail? seg9 is (5,5), tail.\n\nMoving to tail is safe because tail will move away.\n\nRule: can move into tail cell because tail moves.\n\nSo D to (5,5) is possible, since it's tail.\n\nL to (4,6) occupied by seg1, body, not tail, collision, and opposite direction? Current R, L opposite, not allowed.\n\nR to (6,6) not wall, empty, valid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nNow, (5,5) has no food, but it's safe.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), then since it's tail, no collision, and no food, so new positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) with tail at (4,5)? After move: head to (5,5), which was tail, so new positions: head (5,5), then previous head (5,6) becomes seg1, (4,6) seg2, (3,6) seg3, (3,5) seg4, (2,5) seg5, (2,4) seg6, (3,4) seg7, (4,4) seg8, (4,5) seg9, and tail was (5,5) but head moved there, so the previous tail is gone, and since no food, tail removed, so positions: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5) with tail at (4,5).\n\nNow (4,5) is tail, and it has food under it? Food at (4,5) is still there.\n\nBut (4,5) is now the tail position.\n\nTo eat the food, I need to move the head to (4,5) when it is free.\n\nCurrently at turn 35, after move, (4,5) is tail.\n\nIf at turn 36, I move to (4,5), but (4,5) is tail, and moving there would be safe only if it's the tail and I don't grow, but if I move to (4,5), which has food, I eat it and grow, but there's a danger.\n\nSpecial case: Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nFirst, at turn 35, head at (5,5), tail at (4,5).\n\nAre they adjacent? (5,5) and (4,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nSo head is adjacent to tail.\n\nTail cell (4,5) has food.\n\nIf I move head to (4,5), I would eat the food, but because head is adjacent to tail, after eating, the head moves to (4,5), and the tail stays, but a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the new tail is at (4,5) or where?\n\nBefore move: head at (5,5), tail at (4,5).\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5), which is the tail position and has food.\n\nSince food eaten, new positions: head at (4,5), then the previous head (5,5) becomes segment 1, and the previous segments, and tail stays, so new tail is at (4,5), but head is also at (4,5)? No.\n\nPositions: after moving to (4,5), which was tail and has food.\n\nThe new head is at (4,5).\n\nThen the previous positions: previous head (5,5) becomes first body segment, then the rest, and since food eaten, we add a new segment, but where? The tail was at (4,5), but head moved there, so the cell is occupied by head, and we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but tail was at (4,5), which is now head, so we add a new segment at (4,5)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nStandard way: when head moves to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, meaning the last segment remains.\n\nBefore move: positions [P0, P1, ..., P8, P9] with P0 head, P9 tail.\n\nHead moves to new cell C.\n\nIf C is food, new positions [C, P0, P1, ..., P9], so the tail P9 is still there, and we have a new segment at P9.\n\nIn this case, C = (4,5), which was P9.\n\nSo new positions: head at C = (4,5), then P0 (5,5), P1 (5,6), P2 (4,6), ..., up to P9 (4,5), but P9 is (4,5), and C is also (4,5), so head and P9 are the same cell, which is a collision.\n\nThe head and the new tail would be on the same cell, killing the snake.\n\nThe rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to tail cell to eat food, and head was adjacent, then after eating, head and tail are on the same cell.\n\nIn this case, from (5,5) to (4,5), head was adjacent to tail, and tail has food, so eating it causes collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to (4,5) at turn 36 if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nIn turn 35, after move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), tail (4,5), adjacent.\n\nAt turn 36, if I try to move to (4,5), it would be deadly.\n\nI could move elsewhere.\n\nBut at turn 35, I have choices: from (5,6), I could have moved R to (6,6) instead of D to (5,5).\n\nLet's go back to turn 33 to plan better.\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, at turn 32, I must move U to (3,6) because it's the only choice.\n\nThen at turn 33, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nI can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (4,5). I want to eat it, but it's under the body.\n\nThe segment at (4,5) is currently seg6 at turn 33.\n\nAs the snake moves, that segment will move to different positions.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the body shifts.\n\nTo free (4,5), I need the segment to move away and no immediate reoccupation.\n\nBut since the snake is connected, when a segment leaves, the next might come, but not necessarily immediately if the snake turns.\n\nFor instance, if I can make the snake move in a way that (4,5) is vacated.\n\nCurrently at turn 33, positions include (4,5) occupied.\n\nAfter a move, say to (2,6), positions shift, (4,5) is still occupied by a different segment.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nThe only way to vacate (4,5) is to have the tail pass over it or something, but tail is far.\n\nLet's see where (4,5) is in the body.\n\nThe snake positions at turn 33: from head to tail: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo the segment at (4,5) is the 7th from head, or 3rd from tail.\n\nAs the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nSo to have (4,5) vacated, I need that when the segment at (4,5) moves to the next position, the cell (4,5) is not immediately occupied by another segment, which happens if the snake doesn't double back, but in general, for a linear snake, when a segment moves forward, the cell is free until the tail moves or something.\n\nIn snake, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was occupied by the last body segment (before tail) is vacated when the tail moves, but only if no growth.\n\nFor example, when the snake moves without eating, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nFor a body cell, when the segment moves to the next position, the cell it left is free, but only if no other segment moves into it, which in a straight line, no, but if the snake turns, it might be that the cell is not reoccupied immediately.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is not straight, it might be possible.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I should focus on the food at (2,1) which is free.\n\nOr plan a path to eat both.\n\nBut (4,5) has limited life span.\n\nLife span at turn 33 is 5, so I have until turn 37 to eat it.\n\nTurn 33 to 37.\n\nAt turn 33, I am at (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (2,6), then as before, I go left and down, and (4,5) remains occupied.\n\nIf I move to (4,6), then I can go right.\n\nLet's try moving R to (4,6) at turn 33.\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,4), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (5,4) tail.\n\n(4,5) occupied by seg7.\n\nTurn 34, from (4,6), direction R, move R to (5,6) as only choice, positions: head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,4), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (5,5) tail.\n\n(4,5) occupied by seg8.\n\nTurn 35, head at (5,6), direction R, can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is tail, so safe to move there.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), then as before, head and tail adjacent with food on tail, dangerous to eat next turn.\n\nBut I don't have to eat it immediately.\n\nIf I move to (5,5), no food, so new positions: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5) tail.\n\nNow (4,5) is tail with food.\n\nHead at (5,5), tail at (4,5), adjacent.\n\nAt turn 36, I can move away, for example, U to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied by seg1, body, collision, invalid.\n\nD to (5,4), (5,4) is what? In positions, seg9 is (4,5), so (5,4) not occupied, but is it wall? x=5,y=4, not border, but internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,4) is not wall, so empty.\n\nL to (4,5), but (4,5) is tail with food, and head adjacent, so moving there would cause death as explained.\n\nR to (6,5) or something, but current position (5,5), R to (6,5), not occupied, not wall.\n\nPossible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U to (5,6): occupied by seg1, body, collision invalid\n\n- D to (5,4): empty, valid\n\n- L to (4,5): tail with food, but head adjacent, so if move, dangerous, will collide after eating\n\n- R to (6,5): empty, valid\n\nCurrent direction: after moving D to (5,5) at turn 35, direction is D.\n\nAt turn 36, current direction D, so cannot move U, opposite.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: to (5,6) occupied, invalid, and opposite direction? Current D, U opposite, not allowed.\n\nD: to (5,4) empty, valid\n\nL: to (4,5) possible but dangerous\n\nR: to (6,5) empty, valid\n\nSo I can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5), or L but should avoid.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), no food, so new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) with tail at (4,4)? After move: head to (5,4), previous head (5,5) seg1, (5,6) seg2, (4,6) seg3, (3,6) seg4, (3,5) seg5, (2,5) seg6, (2,4) seg7, (3,4) seg8, (4,4) seg9, tail was (4,5) but not in positions, removed, so tail at (4,4).\n\n(4,5) is now free, and has food.\n\nBut head is at (5,4), not adjacent to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at left of head.\n\nAt turn 36, after moving to (5,4), head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen I can move to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nMove L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is empty now, and has food, and head not adjacent to tail or anything special.\n\nTail is at (4,4), head at (5,4), so not adjacent.\n\nMoving to (4,5) is safe.\n\nThen I eat the food at (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 35 I moved R to (6,6) instead of D to (5,5), let's see.\n\nAt turn 34, head at (5,6), move R to (6,6).\n\nThen positions: head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5) tail? After move to (6,6), no food, so tail removed: previous tail (5,5) removed, positions: head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5) with tail at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is tail with food.\n\nHead at (6,6), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen at turn 35, I can move to eat (4,5), but it's not adjacent, so I need to move towards it.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,6) or D to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,6) is occupied by seg1, collision.\n\nD to (6,5) empty.\n\nL to (5,6) occupied, invalid.\n\nU wall, R wall? (6,6), U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) empty, L to (5,6) occupied, R to (7,6) x=7 wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,5).\n\nThen no food, positions shift, (4,5) still tail with food, but now head at (6,5), further away.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the better path is to move to (5,5) at turn 35, then to (5,4) at turn 36, then to (4,5) at turn 37 to eat.\n\nAt turn 36, after moving to (5,4), (4,5) is free and has food, so move L to (4,5) at turn 36.\n\nNow, life span: at turn 36, for food (4,5), life span was 6 at turn 32, decreased each turn.\n\nTurn 32: life span 6\n\nTurn 33: 5\n\nTurn 34: 4\n\nTurn 35: 3\n\nTurn 36: 2\n\nTurn 37: 1\n\nTurn 38: 0, disappear\n\nSo at turn 36, life span 2, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat at turn 36, it's within life span.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 33 move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 34 move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 35 move D to (5,5)  // now head (5,5), tail (4,5) with food, adjacent\n\nTurn 36 move D to (5,4)  // head (5,4), (4,5) free with food\n\nTurn 37 move L to (4,5) to eat  // turn 37, but at turn 36 we moved to (5,4), then turn 37 move to (4,5)\n\nAt turn 36, head at (5,4), I can move to (4,5) immediately if possible.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5) occupied by body? After turn 36 move to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (4,6), etc., down to seg9 (4,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 36 move to (5,4): previous positions from turn 35: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5) tail\n\nAfter move to (5,4), no food, so new positions: head (5,4), then previous head (5,5) becomes seg1, (5,6) seg2, (4,6) seg3, (3,6) seg4, (3,5) seg5, (2,5) seg6, (2,4) seg7, (3,4) seg8, (4,4) seg9, tail was (4,5) removed, so tail at (4,4).\n\n(4,5) is now free and has food.\n\nHead at (5,4), which is adjacent to (4,5) left, and (5,5) up, (6,4) right? (6,4) may not be occupied.\n\nPositions: (5,4) head, (5,5) seg1, (5,6) seg2, (4,6) seg3, (3,6) seg4, (3,5) seg5, (2,5) seg6, (2,4) seg7, (3,4) seg8, (4,4) seg9 tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is free.\n\nHead at (5,4), adjacent cells: U (5,5) occupied by seg1, body, collision if move there.\n\nD (5,3): not wall, empty? Assuming.\n\nL (4,4): (4,4) is tail, so can move there.\n\nR (6,4): not wall, empty.\n\nCurrent direction: moved D to (5,4) at turn 36, so direction D.\n\nAt turn 37, possible moves: U to (5,5) occupied, invalid, and opposite direction.\n\nD to (5,3) empty, valid\n\nL to (4,4) tail, valid (since tail moves)\n\nR to (6,4) empty, valid\n\n(4,5) is at L-up? (4,5) is not adjacent to (5,4)? (5,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not directly reachable.\n\nAdjacent means up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo from (5,4), I cannot move directly to (4,5); I need to go through (4,4) or (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied, (4,4) is tail.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), which is tail, no food there, so safe.\n\nThen after move, positions: head to (4,4), tail position, no food, so new positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), etc., down to tail moving.\n\n(4,5) is still free with food.\n\nThen I can move to (4,5) from (4,4) at next turn.\n\nBut from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) directly.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt turn 37, after moving to (4,4) from (5,4), head at (4,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen at turn 37, move U to (4,5) to eat food.\n\n(4,5) has food, so eat.\n\nAnd head at (4,4), tail at previous position, not adjacent, so safe.\n\nLife span: at turn 37, food (4,5) life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, back to turn 33, I need to choose R to (4,6) to set this up.\n\nAt turn 33, I could have moved L to (2,6), but that might not reach (4,5) in time.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 32: must move U to (3,6), eat food there.\n\nScore +1, length 10 now.\n\nTurn 33: I choose to move R to (4,6), no food.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6), move R to (5,6), no food, direction R.\n\nTurn 35: from (5,6), move D to (5,5), no food, but (5,5) was tail, safe. Direction now D.\n\nTurn 36: from (5,5), move D to (5,4), no food. Direction D.\n\nNow (4,5) free with food.\n\nTurn 37: from (5,4), move L to (4,4)? No, from (5,4), I can move directly? But (4,5) not adjacent, so need to go to (4,4) first.\n\nFrom (5,4), move L to (4,4), which is tail, no food, safe. Direction L.\n\nThen turn 37: head at (4,4), move U to (4,5) to eat food. Direction U.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (2,1)? It has life span 9 at turn 32, so at turn 37, life span 4, still available, I can go for it later.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is for the current turn and future, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for how many turns? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to provide actions for the immediate turns, but since I have to think ahead, I should provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the response, I can provide actions for the next few turns based on the plan.\n\nBut let's see the current state is turn 32, so I need to start from turn 32.\n\nAlso, at turn 32, I have only one choice, U.\n\nThen for turn 33, I need to choose.\n\nIn the plan above, I chose R to go for the (4,5) food.\n\nI could go for (2,1) directly.\n\nBut (2,1) is at bottom-left, while I'm at top.\n\nAt turn 33, head at (3,6), I can move L to (2,6), then as before, to (1,6), then (1,5), etc., to go down to (2,1).\n\nFor example, turn 33 move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 34 move L to (1,6) only choice\n\nTurn 35 move D to (1,5) only\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5) occupied, etc., it might be messy, and I may not reach (2,1) easily with the body.\n\nWhereas the (4,5) food is closer and can be eaten by turn 37.\n\nThen after eating (4,5), I can head to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) has life span 9 at turn 32, so at turn 37, it has life span 4, so until turn 40.\n\nAfter eating (4,5) at turn 37, head at (4,5), I can plan to go to (2,1).\n\nBut let's first confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, at turn 36, when I move to (5,4), and (4,5) is free, but I cannot move directly to (4,5) from (5,4) because not adjacent, so I need to go to (4,4) or something.\n\nIn the earlier step, from (5,4), I move to (4,4), then to (4,5).\n\n(4,4) might have food? No, no food there.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 32.\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nThen turn 33: R (to set up for (4,5))\n\nBut I should include up to where?\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and it might be open-ended, but I think for this, I can provide a sequence for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the food life.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (4,5), the snake is longer, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBut the grid has internal wall at (5,2), so I should be careful.\n\nNow, for the response.\n\nFirst, at turn 32, only choice is U.\n\nSo action: U\n\nThen for turn 33, I choose R to go towards the food area.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 35: D (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 36: D (to (5,4))\n\nThen at turn 37, from (5,4), I need to move to (4,4) or directly, but must move to adjacent.\n\nI can move L to (4,4) at turn 36? Turn 36 is move to (5,4), then turn 37 move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 38 move U to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 37, life span of (4,5) is 1, so can be eaten on turn 37.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 37 I am moving to (4,4), not directly to (4,5).\n\nTo eat at turn 37, I need to be in position to move to (4,5).\n\nAt turn 36, after move to (5,4), head at (5,4), I can move to (4,5) only if diagonal, but not, so impossible to move directly to (4,5) from (5,4).\n\nMust go through (4,4) or (5,5), but (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo only via (4,4).\n\nThus, turn 37: move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 38: move U to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 38, food (4,5) life span? At turn 32:6, turn33:5, turn34:4, turn35:3, turn36:2, turn37:1, turn38:0, disappear, so not available on turn 38.\n\nAt turn 37, life span is 1, so can be eaten on turn 37.\n\nBut at turn 37, I am at (4,4), and (4,5) is adjacent, so I can move to (4,5) on turn 37.\n\nAt turn 37: head at (5,4)? No.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 36: after moving to (5,4), head at (5,4) at start of turn 37? Let's clarify turns.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action based on state at start of turn.\n\nAfter action, state updates for next turn.\n\nFor turn 36: I move to (5,4), so at end of turn 36, positions updated, head at (5,4).\n\nThen for turn 37, state: head at (5,4), direction D (since moved D last).\n\nFood at (4,5) has life span 1 (since decreased from 2 at turn 36? At turn 36, life span was 2, after turn 36, decreases to 1 for turn 37.\n\nSo at turn 37, (4,5) has life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nNow from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or other, but not directly to (4,5).\n\nSo I move to (4,4) at turn 37.\n\nThen after move, head at (4,4), (4,5) still there with life span 1? After turn 37 move, if I don't eat, life span decreases.\n\nBut at turn 37, I move to (4,4), not eating (4,5).\n\nThen for turn 38, (4,5) life span 0, disappeared, gone.\n\nSo I miss it.\n\nProblem.\n\nTo eat at turn 37, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (4,5) at start of turn 37, and move to it.\n\nAt start of turn 37, head at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (4,5), so I cannot move to (4,5) directly.\n\nThe only cells adjacent to (4,5) are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5).\n\nAt start of turn 37, after turn 36, positions: head (5,4), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,6), etc., so (4,6) is occupied by seg3, (4,4) is tail, (3,5) occupied, (5,5) occupied by seg1.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied except possibly (4,4) which is tail, but I can move to it.\n\nBut (4,5) itself is free, but not adjacent to head.\n\nSo impossible to eat (4,5) at turn 37 from this position.\n\nTherefore, in the plan, I must eat it earlier.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 36, after moving to (5,4), (4,5) is free, but head not adjacent.\n\nAt turn 35, after moving to (5,5), head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), adjacent, and (4,5) has food, but I cannot move to it because of tail reward danger.\n\nIf I move to (4,5) at turn 36 from (5,5), it would kill the snake.\n\nSo the only safe way is to have head not adjacent when eating.\n\nBut in this case, with the snake configuration, it's hard to free (4,5) without the tail being there or head not close.\n\nPerhaps at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 34, from (5,6), instead of moving to (5,5), I could move to (6,6), but then (4,5) is still under body.\n\nLet's list the occupier of (4,5) over turns.\n\nAt turn 33 start: seg6 at (4,5)\n\nAfter turn 33 move to (4,6): positions shift, seg7 at (4,5) in new positions\n\nAt turn 34 start: seg7 at (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,6): seg8 at (4,5)\n\nTurn 35 start: seg8 at (4,5)\n\nIf move to (5,5): then after move, seg9 at (4,5) tail\n\nTurn 36 start: seg9 at (4,5) tail with food\n\nThen if move to (5,4), (4,5) free but not accessible.\n\nIf at turn 35 from (5,6) I move to (6,6), then turn 35 start seg8 at (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6): positions head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), etc., seg9 at (4,5) tail\n\n(4,5) still tail with food.\n\nThen at turn 36, from (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), then positions shift, (4,5) may still be occupied or free.\n\nAfter move to (6,5), head (6,5), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (2,5), seg7 (2,4), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (4,4) tail, so (4,5) free now.\n\nBut head at (6,5), far from (4,5), and life span short.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSo perhaps for this food, it's risky, and I should go for the other food at (2,1).\n\nAt turn 33, move L to (2,6) and head down.\n\nBut (2,1) is at bottom, and walls.\n\nLet's see a path to (2,1).\n\nAt turn 33, head at (3,6), move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 34 move L to (1,6) (only choice)\n\nTurn 35 move D to (1,5) (only)\n\nTurn 36 from (1,5), can move D to (1,4) or R to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, so only D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37 to (1,3), and so on, to (1,1) or to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), so from (1,1) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut with the body, it might be tight.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, and at turn 32 only one choice, I'll go with the initial plan for turn 33 R.\n\nThen for the output, I can provide actions for turns 32 to 36 or so.\n\nBut let's include the eat at turn 37 if possible, but it's not.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 35, from (5,6), move R to (6,6), then at turn 36 move D to (6,5), then at turn 37, (4,5) is free but far.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (4,5) when it's not tail.\n\nFor example, if I can free it earlier.\n\nAt turn 33, from (3,6), if I move R to (4,6), then at turn 34, from (4,6), I could move D to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by seg7, body, collision, invalid.\n\nMove L, not possible.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the food at (4,5) might not be eatable within life span with the current snake position, or it's risky.\n\nPerhaps I should abandon it and go for (2,1).\n\nAt turn 33, move L to (2,6).\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: L (to (1,6))\n\nTurn 35: D (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 36: D (to (1,4))\n\nThen turn 37: D to (1,3), and so on, to reach (2,1) by say turn 40, but life span at turn 40 is 1, can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 32, life span 9, so at turn 40, life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nFrom (1,4), I can move to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), then to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, so from (1,1), move R to (2,1), or from (2,2) move D.\n\nBut need to see if accessible.\n\nSince there's an internal wall at (5,2), but bottom-left is clear.\n\nBut the snake body might block, but as I move down, the body follows, so it might be possible.\n\nFor example, from (1,4) at turn 36, move D to (1,3) turn 37, D to (1,2) turn 38, D to (1,1) turn 39, then R to (2,1) turn 40 to eat.\n\nAnd at turn 40, life span 1, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can go directly to (2,1) from other paths.\n\nBut in this case, I get one food at turn 32 and one at turn 40.\n\nIn the first plan, I got one at 32 and could have gotten one at 37 if possible, but it's not, so this is better.\n\nAt turn 33, if I move R, I might not get any additional food soon.\n\nSo I think moving L at turn 33 is better for long-term.\n\nAlso, prioritize survival, going left and down might be safer than crowding in the right.\n\nSo I'll go with L at turn 33.\n\nThen for the answer.\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nThen for future turns, I can provide a few more, but since the state changes, I can specify the immediate actions.\n\nThe format says to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I can do for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 32 to 36.\n\nAt turn 34, from (2,6), only L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 35 from (1,6), only D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36 from (1,5), only D to (1,4) since R to (2,5) occupied.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 32: U  \nTurn 33: L  \nTurn 34: L  \nTurn 35: D  \nTurn 36: D\n\nThen later to reach (2,1).\n\nBut for the box, I think this is fine.\n\nTo be complete, I can add turn 37 D to (1,3), etc., but not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) has shorter life, but I can't eat it, so better to go for the other.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 32):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,2)). Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6, excluding (5,2).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (3,5), body segments at (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), tail at (6,4). Length = 9.\n  - Current direction: Right (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,6): Value +1, life span 4 (available turns 32-35).\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 6 (available turns 32-37), but occupied by body segment (cannot be eaten until vacated).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 9 (available turns 32-40).\n\n**Key Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 32 Movement**: Only valid move is Up (U) to (3,6) to avoid collisions (Down to (3,4) and Right to (4,5) cause body collisions; Left is opposite direction and causes collision).\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Occupied by body; eating requires vacating the cell first. Life span allows until turn 37, but the snake's position and the \"tail reward danger\" rule make eating it high-risk or impractical within the timeframe. Prioritizing the safer (2,1) food is better for long-term survival.\n- **Food at (2,1)**: Accessible with careful pathing; life span allows until turn 40. Moving left/down early sets up a path to eat it around turn 40.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: Focus on survival and reaching (2,1). After eating (3,6) at turn 32, move left/down to navigate toward (2,1) while avoiding dead ends. Internal obstacle at (5,2) is not a concern for this path.\n- **Risks**: Avoid head-tail adjacency when eating food; ensure no wall/body collisions.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 32-36):**\n- **Turn 32**: Move U to (3,6) – eats positive food, grows to length 10.\n- **Turn 33**: Move L to (2,6) – starts path toward (2,1); avoids right area where (4,5) is risky.\n- **Turn 34**: Move L to (1,6) – only valid move (Up/Down/Right cause collisions or walls).\n- **Turn 35**: Move D to (1,5) – only valid move (Left wall, Right collision, Up opposite direction).\n- **Turn 36**: Move D to (1,4) – only valid move (Left wall, Right collision, Up opposite direction).\n\n**Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 36):**\n- Continue down to (1,1) by ~turn 39 (e.g., Turn 37: D to (1,3); Turn 38: D to (1,2); Turn 39: D to (1,1)).\n- Eat (2,1) at turn 40 by moving Right to (2,1) – within life span (life span 1 at turn 40).\n- This path maximizes score (eats two foods) with minimal risk. Alternative paths toward (4,5) were considered but discarded due to tail reward danger and low feasibility.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: L \\\\\nTurn 34: L \\\\\nTurn 35: D \\\\\nTurn 36: D\n}",

The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,6), and the body segments follow: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to (3,6) from (3,5), I assume.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1 and life span 5. But (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\nBoth foods are positive, value +1 each.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid for clarity.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on all borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo let's list all snake cells:\n\n- (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,5) - but this is occupied by the snake body. Specifically, it's the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (6,4). So (4,5) is position 6, which is the body.\n\n- (2,1) - this is empty, I think. (2,1) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n\nLife span: (4,5) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 33, life span 5, it will disappear after turn 37? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So if at turn t, food has life span L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1? Or at the start of turn t + L?\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: when the countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So if at turn t, life span is N, then after N turns, it's gone. For example, at turn 33, life span 5, so countdown starts at 5 on turn 33, then 4 on turn 34, 3 on turn 35, 2 on turn 36, 1 on turn 37, and gone on turn 38? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, for food at (4,5), life span 5 at turn 33. Countdown decreases each turn, including turn 33, so:\n\n- Turn 33: countdown = 5\n\n- Turn 34: countdown = 4\n\n- Turn 35: countdown = 3\n\n- Turn 36: countdown = 2\n\n- Turn 37: countdown = 1\n\n- Turn 38: countdown = 0 → disappears before or at turn 38?\n\nThe disappearance happens after N turns, so if it appears at turn T, it disappears at turn T + N. But here, it's given at turn 33 with life span 5, so it was spawned at some earlier turn.\n\nThe life span is the remaining life when we see it. So at turn 33, it has 5 turns left, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns, so on turn 38 it should be gone.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1), life span 8, disappears after turn 40 (33 + 8 = 41? Turn 33 + 8 turns = turn 41).\n\nTurn 33: countdown 8, turn 34:7, ..., turn 40:1, turn 41:0, gone at turn 41.\n\nBut since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t with life L, it exists until turn t + L - 1 inclusive? Let's not overcomplicate; I can think the food is available for L more turns, from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor (4,5): available turns 33 to 37 inclusive? Turn 33: countdown 5, turn 34:4, ..., turn 37:1, so on turn 38, countdown 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 33 to 37.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): available turns 33 to 40.\n\nNow, back to the snake. Head at (3,6), direction Up. From (3,5) to (3,6), so it moved up to (3,6).\n\nCurrent possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so I cannot move Down on the next turn. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. But Down is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but body collision: moving into a body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nSpecifically, head can move to the current tail position because tail will move away, but not to other body parts.\n\nAlso, walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo for head at (3,6):\n\n- Up: (3,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (3,5) - but (3,5) is body segment, and it's not the tail, so collision. Also, Down is opposite to current Up, so doubly invalid.\n\n- Left: (2,6) - what is (2,6)? Not in snake positions, and not wall? Walls are only borders and (5,2), so (2,6) should be free.\n\n- Right: (4,6) - similarly, should be free.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (2,6): x=2, y=6, not border (borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7), and not (5,2), so free.\n\n(4,6) same.\n\nAlso, (3,5) is occupied but that's Down, which we can't go anyway.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,6): Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6).\n\nUp is wall, Down is invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead. Also, there's food at (4,5) which is under the snake body, so I can eat it only if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied by the body at position 6: (4,5).\n\nThe snake moves by moving head and tail moves, so when the snake moves, the tail (6,4) will move to the next position, but since it's not growing, the tail moves away.\n\nBut to eat food under body, I need the head to move to that cell after the body has moved away.\n\nSpecifically, for (4,5), it's currently occupied. If I move in a way that on some future turn, (4,5) is free, and I move head there.\n\nBut it might be risky because of the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's list the current tail: (6,4) is the tail end.\n\nNow, the other food at (2,1), which is far away, at bottom left.\n\nLife span: (4,5) has short life, only 5 turns left, so I need to eat it soon if possible, but it's risky.\n\n(2,1) has longer life, 8 turns.\n\nBut I should prioritize survival.\n\nNow, let's think about possible moves for turn 33.\n\nFrom head (3,6), I can go Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6).\n\nIf I go Left to (2,6), then head at (2,6), and the body follows: tail (6,4) will be cut off, new positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Since no food eaten, length same, so tail (6,4) removed, new tail is (5,4)? Positions: after move, snake moves: new head (2,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). But (6,4) is gone, so segments: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — that's 10 segments? Original was 10, after move without eating, should be 10, but positions: from head: (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Yes, 10 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I go Right to (4,6), head to (4,6), then body: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4) gone? New positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Tail at (5,4) again? (6,4) is removed, so tail is (5,4).\n\nIn both cases, moving to (2,6) or (4,6) doesn't eat food, so snake doesn't grow, tail is cut.\n\nNow, after turn 33, the food at (4,5) will have life span decreased to 4, etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is still occupied by the body? After moving, let's see position of (4,5).\n\nIf I go Left to (2,6): new positions: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). So (4,5) is still occupied, by the 8th segment? Head (2,6) index 0, (3,6)1, (3,5)2, (2,5)3, (2,4)4, (3,4)5, (4,4)6, (4,5)7, (5,5)8, (5,4)9. So (4,5) is occupied.\n\nIf I go Right to (4,6): head (4,6), (3,6)1, (3,5)2, (2,5)3, (2,4)4, (3,4)5, (4,4)6, (4,5)7, (5,5)8, (5,4)9. (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo in both cases, (4,5) is still under body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move so that (4,5) becomes free and head moves there.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body will move away eventually if I steer it properly.\n\nFor example, if I can make the segment at (4,5) move away.\n\nCurrently, that segment is at (4,5), which is part of the body.\n\nThe snake will move based on head movement.\n\nAlso, there's a risk with tail reward danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nFor (4,5), if I eat it, since it's under body, but when I eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and if the head was adjacent to tail, it might collide.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (4,5), which is not the tail; tail is at (6,4) or (5,4) after move.\n\nLet's think about eating (4,5).\n\nFirst, I need (4,5) to be free.\n\nCurrently, it's occupied. After one move, as above, it's still occupied.\n\nIf I move in a way that the body moves off (4,5).\n\nFor example, if I move the head such that the segment at (4,5) moves to a different position.\n\nLet's see the current snake path. From head (3,6) down to (3,5), then left to (2,5), down to (2,4), right to (3,4), right to (4,4), up to (4,5), right to (5,5), down to (5,4), right to (6,4).\n\nPositions: (3,6) - up from (3,5), (3,5) - down from (2,5)? From (2,5) to (3,5) is right? Let's list the positions in order:\n\nHead: (3,6)  -- from (3,5) by moving up\n\nThen (3,5)  -- from (2,5) by moving right? (2,5) to (3,5) is +x, right.\n\nThen (2,5)  -- from (2,4) by moving up? (2,4) to (2,5) is +y, up.\n\nThen (2,4)  -- from (3,4) by moving left? (3,4) to (2,4) is -x, left.\n\nThen (3,4)  -- from (4,4) by moving left? (4,4) to (3,4) is -x, left.\n\nThen (4,4)  -- from (4,5) by moving down? (4,5) to (4,4) is -y, down.\n\nThen (4,5)  -- from (5,5) by moving left? (5,5) to (4,5) is -x, left.\n\nThen (5,5)  -- from (5,4) by moving up? (5,4) to (5,5) is +y, up.\n\nThen (5,4)  -- from (6,4) by moving left? (6,4) to (5,4) is -x, left.\n\nThen tail: (6,4)\n\nSo the snake has a bent shape.\n\nNow, to free (4,5), I need the segment that is currently at (4,5) to move away. That segment is the 7th from head, but after moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 33, I need to choose a move.\n\nOptions: Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6).\n\nIf I go Left to (2,6), head to (2,6), direction changes to Left.\n\nThen body: as above, (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nIf I go Right to (4,6), head to (4,6), direction Right, then (4,5) still occupied.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 34, I can move again.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to the food at (2,1) or eating (4,5).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is south-west, and head is at (3,6), so it's far.\n\nWith life span 8, I have time.\n\n(4,5) has only 5 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nBut it's under the body, so I need to free it.\n\nHow can I free (4,5)? The segment at (4,5) will move when the head moves, but it's not directly controlled; it depends on the path.\n\nThe position (4,5) is currently occupied, and it will be freed when the snake moves and that part of the body moves forward.\n\nFor example, if the head moves in a way that the body segment at (4,5) moves to the next position.\n\nCurrently, from the positions, (4,5) was entered from (5,5) by moving left, and it moved to (4,4) by moving down.\n\nSo the segment at (4,5) will move to (4,4) when the head moves, but only if the snake doesn't grow.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the entire body shifts forward, so the segment that was at (4,5) will move to where the next segment was, but since it's a chain, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for example, if head moves from (3,6) to new position, say (2,6), then:\n\n- The old head (3,6) becomes the new neck at position 1.\n\n- The segment that was at position 1, (3,5), moves to position 2, but position 2 was (2,5), so (3,5) moves to (2,5)? No.\n\nPositions are updated sequentially.\n\nAfter head moves to new head position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the original list.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed if no growth, and each body segment advances to the position of the segment ahead of it.\n\nSo for position i, it moves to the position of i-1, but since head is new, the body segments from 1 to len-1 move to the position of segment 0 to len-2, but it's easier to think the new position 1 is the old position 0, new position 2 is old position 1, and so on, up to new position len-1 is old position len-2, and old position len-1 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo in this case, for the cell (4,5), it is currently occupied by the segment that was at index 6 in the list (0-based: head 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 so (4,5) is index 6).\n\nAfter a move, if no growth, the new snake has segments: new head at new position, then old head at index 1, old index 1 at index 2, old index 2 at index 3, ..., old index 8 at index 9, and old index 9 (tail) is gone.\n\nSo the cell that was occupied by old index 6 will now be occupied by new index 7, which is old index 6, but the position is the same until the head moves multiple times.\n\nThe position (4,5) will be freed only when the segment that is there moves away, which happens when that segment advances to a new position.\n\nFor example, the segment that is at (4,5) now will be at new position after head move, but it moves to the position of the segment ahead of it.\n\nLet's say at turn 33, I move head to (2,6).\n\nNew head: (2,6)\n\nThen new body:\n\n- Index 1: old head (3,6)\n\n- Index 2: old index 1 (3,5)\n\n- Index 3: old index 2 (2,5)\n\n- Index 4: old index 3 (2,4)\n\n- Index 5: old index 4 (3,4)\n\n- Index 6: old index 5 (4,4)\n\n- Index 7: old index 6 (4,5)\n\n- Index 8: old index 7 (5,5)\n\n- Index 9: old index 8 (5,4)\n\nOld tail (6,4) gone.\n\nSo (4,5) is still occupied by new index 7, which was old index 6.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (4,6):\n\nNew head: (4,6)\n\nNew body:\n\n- Index 1: old head (3,6)\n\n- Index 2: old index 1 (3,5)\n\n- Index 3: old index 2 (2,5)\n\n- Index 4: old index 3 (2,4)\n\n- Index 5: old index 4 (3,4)\n\n- Index 6: old index 5 (4,4)\n\n- Index 7: old index 6 (4,5)\n\n- Index 8: old index 7 (5,5)\n\n- Index 9: old index 8 (5,4)\n\nAgain, (4,5) occupied.\n\nTo free (4,5), I need the segment that is there to move to a different cell. That will happen when that segment is no longer at the end of the body in a way, but it will move when the head moves enough times.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (4,5) will stay there until it is the segment that moves to the position of the previous head or something.\n\nAfter each move, the segment that was at (4,5) moves to the position of the segment that was ahead of it in the direction of movement.\n\nFor example, the segment at (4,5) was following (4,4) or something. In the chain, each segment moves to where the previous segment was.\n\nBut to free the cell, I need that no segment is at (4,5) after the move.\n\nFor (4,5) to be free, the segment that was there must move to a different cell, and no other segment moves to it.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is moving, (4,5) will be freed when the segment that was there moves to the next position, and the position is not occupied by a new segment immediately.\n\nBut in the current configuration, (4,5) is between (4,4) and (5,5) in the path, so when the head moves, the segment at (4,5) will move to (4,4) if the snake moves down or something, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I can move the head in a way that the body unwinds or moves away from (4,5).\n\nFor example, if I move head left to (2,6), then the body will shift, but (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nThen from there, I can move down or something.\n\nLet's think about the tail. The tail is at (6,4), and I can move to free space.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (4,5) can be eaten if I move the head to (4,5) when it is free.\n\nBut it's currently occupied, so I need to move the snake so that on some turn, (4,5) is empty, and I move head there.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take a few moves to free it.\n\nFor instance, if I move the head down or in a direction that pulls the body away.\n\nBut from (3,6), I can only go left or right; down is invalid.\n\nSuppose on turn 33, I go left to (2,6).\n\nThen head at (2,6), direction Left.\n\nNow on turn 34, from (2,6), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but not opposite to current direction. Current direction is Left, so cannot move Right (instant reverse).\n\nAlso, check cells:\n\n- Up: (2,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Down: (2,5) - (2,5) is body segment, index 3 in new list? After turn 33 move to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nSo (2,5) is index 3, which is body, not tail, so moving to (2,5) would collide.\n\n- Left: (1,6) - should be free, not wall or body.\n\n- Right: (3,6) - but (3,6) is index 1, body, collision, and also opposite to Left, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,6): Down to (2,5) invalid, Right to (3,6) invalid, Up wall, so only Left to (1,6).\n\nOnly one choice: Left to (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 34, move to (1,6).\n\nNew head (1,6), direction Left.\n\nBody: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — tail (5,4), (6,4) gone.\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nNow from (1,6), current direction Left.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (1,7) wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (1,5) - not occupied? Positions: (1,5) not in body, not wall, so free.\n\n- Left: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,6) - (2,6) is body, index 1, collision, and opposite to Left, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move: Down to (1,5).\n\nTurn 35: move to (1,5).\n\nHead at (1,5), direction Down (since from (1,6) to (1,5), y-1).\n\nBody: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail (5,5), (5,4) gone.\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nFrom (1,5), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (1,6) - (1,6) is body, index 1, collision, and opposite to Down, invalid.\n\n- Down: (1,4) - not occupied, free.\n\n- Left: (0,5) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,5) - (2,5) is body, index 4? Positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — (2,5) is index 5, body.\n\nSo moving to (2,5) collision.\n\nOnly Down to (1,4) possible.\n\nTurn 36: move to (1,4).\n\nHead at (1,4), direction Down.\n\nBody: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — tail (4,5)? Index 9 is (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is now the tail? Positions: new head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail is (4,4), and (4,5) is gone? Let's see: after move to (1,4), new positions:\n\n- Head: (1,4)\n\n- Index 1: old head (1,5)\n\n- Index 2: old index 1 (1,6)\n\n- Index 3: old index 2 (2,6)\n\n- Index 4: old index 3 (3,6)\n\n- Index 5: old index 4 (3,5)\n\n- Index 6: old index 5 (2,5)\n\n- Index 7: old index 6 (2,4)\n\n- Index 8: old index 7 (3,4)\n\n- Index 9: old index 8 (4,4)\n\nOld index 9 (4,5) is gone.\n\nSo (4,5) is now free! Because the tail moved away.\n\nOn turn 36, after moving to (1,4), the cell (4,5) is unoccupied.\n\nAnd food is there with value 1, life span: at turn 33 it was 5, turn 34:4, turn 35:3, turn 36:2, so still available.\n\nNow, head is at (1,4), and (4,5) is at (4,5), which is not adjacent; (1,4) to (4,5) is not adjacent, so I can't eat it immediately.\n\nBut it's free now.\n\nFrom (1,4), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (1,5) - (1,5) is body, index 1, collision, invalid.\n\n- Down: (1,3) - not occupied, free.\n\n- Left: (0,4) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,4) - (2,4) is body, index 7? Positions: head (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — (2,4) is index 7, body.\n\nSo moving to (2,4) collision.\n\nOnly Down to (1,3) possible.\n\nTurn 37: move to (1,3).\n\nAnd so on. But (4,5) is free, but head is far away, so I might not be able to eat it before it disappears.\n\nLife span: turn 36 countdown 2, so on turn 37 it will be 1, turn 38 gone.\n\nHead at (1,4) on turn 36, then to (1,3) on turn 37, still far from (4,5).\n\nTo eat (4,5), I need to move head there when it's free, but on turn 36 it's free, but head at (1,4), not adjacent.\n\nI could have taken a different path.\n\nBack to turn 33, if I go right instead.\n\nOn turn 33, go right to (4,6).\n\nHead at (4,6), direction Right.\n\nThen on turn 34, from (4,6), current direction Right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (4,7) wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (4,5) - (4,5) is body, index 7 in new list? After move to (4,6): positions head (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — so (4,5) is index 7, body.\n\nMoving to (4,5) would collide with body, since it's not the tail; tail is (5,4).\n\nAlso, Down is not opposite to Right? Current direction Right, Down is perpendicular, not opposite. Opposite would be Left.\n\nSo Down to (4,5) is possible in terms of direction, but it's occupied by body, so invalid.\n\n- Left: (3,6) - (3,6) is index 1, body, collision, and opposite to Right, invalid.\n\n- Right: (5,6) - not occupied, free? (5,6) not wall, not body, should be free.\n\nBut there is internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,6) is different, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (4,5) invalid, Left invalid, so only Right to (5,6)? Down is invalid because occupied, but Right to (5,6) is possible.\n\n(5,6) is free, yes.\n\nSo go Right to (5,6).\n\nTurn 34: move to (5,6).\n\nHead at (5,6), direction Right.\n\nBody: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — tail (5,4).\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nFrom (5,6), direction Right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,7) wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (5,5) - (5,5) is body, index 8? Positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — (5,5) is index 9, which is the tail.\n\nMoving to (5,5): since it's the tail, and tail will move, so it is allowed, no collision.\n\n- Left: (4,6) - (4,6) is index 1, body, collision, and opposite to Right? Current direction Right, Left is opposite, so cannot move Left.\n\n- Right: (6,6) - not wall, not body, free. But x=6, since x=7 is wall, x=6 is not border? Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall. (6,6) should be free.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\nNow, (5,5) is tail, so moving there is safe, and since it's food? (5,5) has food? No, food is at (4,5) and (2,1), not at (5,5). (5,5) is just a cell.\n\nBut there might be tail reward danger if I eat food at tail.\n\nHere, no food at (5,5), so moving to (5,5) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, Right to (6,6) safe.\n\nIf I move Down to (5,5), then I eat nothing, snake moves, tail moves away.\n\nBut (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), new head (5,5), then body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — and old tail (5,4) gone, so (4,5) is now index 9, tail.\n\nSo (4,5) becomes the tail.\n\nThen on subsequent moves, if I move away, (4,5) might be freed.\n\nBut the food is at (4,5), which is now the tail cell.\n\nIf I move head to (4,5) when it is tail, I can eat the food, but there is tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, if tail is at (4,5) with food, and head moves to it, when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head is on the food, but since I moved to tail, which is adjacent, but after eating, the tail stays, so head and tail are on the same cell? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIf head moves to a cell with food, and that cell is the current tail position, then:\n\n- I eat the food, so snake grows: the tail is not removed, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since head is moving to tail, it's messy.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; the new head position is the food cell, and the tail stays in place, so the snake gets longer.\n\nBut if the head moves to the tail cell, which has food, then:\n\n- Head moves to tail cell.\n\n- Since there is food, snake grows, so tail does not move; it remains, and the head is now on the same cell as the tail? But that would be collision.\n\nTypically in snake, if head moves to tail, it's safe because tail moves away, but if there is food, tail doesn't move, so head and tail on same cell is bad.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo specifically, if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, and head moves to tail cell to eat it, then after eating, the head is on that cell, and since snake grows, the tail does not move, so the cell now has both head and tail? But tail was there, head moves in, so after move, head is on the cell, and tail is still there? No.\n\nPositions: before move, tail at T.\n\nHead at H, adjacent to T.\n\nHead moves to T to eat food.\n\nAfter move: new head at T.\n\nSince food eaten, snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays at T.\n\nBut new head is also at T, so head and tail on same cell, which is collision.\n\nHence death.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat food that is on the tail cell if head is adjacent to tail.\n\nIn other cases, if food is on tail and head not adjacent, it might be ok, but when I move to it, if head was not adjacent, after moving to tail, head and tail were not adjacent before, but after move, if I move to tail, and eat, then head and tail on same cell.\n\nLet's think.\n\nSuppose tail at T, head at H, not adjacent.\n\nHead moves to T to eat food.\n\nBefore move, H and T not adjacent.\n\nAfter move, new head at T, and since food eaten, tail stays at T, so now head and tail both at T, collision.\n\nSo always, if I move head to the tail position to eat food, it causes collision because tail doesn't move.\n\nTherefore, I should never eat food that is on the current tail position.\n\nIn this case, for (4,5), if it becomes the tail, I should not eat it.\n\nBack to the situation.\n\nOn turn 33, if I go right to (4,6), then on turn 34 to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\nIf I go Down to (5,5), then as above, head to (5,5), which was tail, but no food there, so no problem, and new positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — and (4,5) is now the tail, since old tail (5,4) gone.\n\n(4,5) has food, and it is tail.\n\nThen on subsequent turns, if I move the head, the tail will move when no growth, so (4,5) can be freed.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), I can move.\n\nDirection: moved to (5,5) from (5,6), so direction Down.\n\nPossible moves from (5,5): Up, Down, Left, Right, but not opposite.\n\nCurrent direction Down, so cannot move Up.\n\n- Up: (5,6) - (5,6) is body, index 1, collision, invalid.\n\n- Down: (5,4) - not occupied? (5,4) was tail but gone, so free? Positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — so (5,4) not occupied, free. Also, not wall.\n\n- Left: (4,5) - (4,5) is tail, index 9, so moving to tail is allowed, since tail will move away if no growth.\n\n- Right: (6,5) - free, not wall or body.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (5,4), Left to (4,5), or Right to (6,5).\n\nIf I move Left to (4,5), (4,5) has food and is tail, so if I move there, I eat the food, but since it's tail and head is moving to it, it will cause collision as per rule.\n\nBecause head is adjacent to tail? Before move, head at (5,5), tail at (4,5), which are adjacent (since (5,5) and (4,5) share edge), so head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, so eating it kills the snake.\n\nTherefore, I must not move to (4,5) on this turn.\n\nInstead, I can move Down to (5,4) or Right to (6,5).\n\nSay I move Down to (5,4).\n\nThen no food eaten, new head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), etc., and tail (4,5) moves to (4,4)? New positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail at (4,4), and (4,5) is free now.\n\nSo (4,5) is free, and food is there.\n\nHead at (5,4), which is adjacent to (4,5)? (5,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, not sharing edge. Adjacent means up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (5,4) to (4,5) is not adjacent; I can't move directly.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (5,5) up, or (5,3) down, or (4,4) left, or (6,4) right.\n\n(4,5) is not directly accessible.\n\nAnd life span of food: turn 33:5, turn 34:4, turn 35:3, turn 36:2, etc.\n\nOn turn 35, head at (5,4), after moving from (5,5) to (5,4), direction Down.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (4,4) for example, but (4,4) is body, index 9 in new list, tail? Positions: head (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — so (4,4) is index 9, tail.\n\nMoving to (4,4) is possible since it's tail.\n\nBut no food there.\n\n(4,5) is free with food, but not adjacent to (5,4).\n\nTo reach (4,5) from (5,4), I need to go through (5,5) or (4,4), but (5,5) is body, not free.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,5) - body, index 1, collision, invalid\n\n- Down: (5,3) - free, assuming not wall\n\n- Left: (4,4) - tail, so allowed\n\n- Right: (6,4) - free\n\nIf I move Left to (4,4), then head to (4,4), which is tail, no food, so no growth, new tail is (3,4) or something.\n\nThen (4,5) is still free, but head at (4,4), adjacent to (4,5)? (4,4) and (4,5) are adjacent up.\n\nThen on next turn, I can move to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut let's see turn and life span.\n\nFirst, turn 33: move to (4,6)\n\nTurn 34: move to (5,6)\n\nTurn 35: move to (5,4) or other, but in this path, I moved to (5,4) on turn 35? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 33: move to (4,6)\n\nTurn 34: move to (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 35, from (5,6), I moved to (5,5)? No, in the earlier choice, from (5,6) I can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nI assumed I went to (5,5) on turn 34? Turn 34: from (4,6) to (5,6)? Turn 33: to (4,6), turn 34: to (5,6), then turn 35 from (5,6).\n\nAt (5,6), I can go Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\nIf I go Down to (5,5) on turn 35.\n\nThen as above, (4,5) becomes tail.\n\nThen on turn 36, from (5,5), I can move to (5,4) for example, freeing (4,5).\n\nTurn 36: head at (5,4), (4,5) free.\n\nLife span: turn 33:5, turn 34:4, turn 35:3, turn 36:2, so available.\n\nHead at (5,4), (4,5) is up-left, not adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,3) or (6,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,4), which is tail, no food, so head to (4,4), then body shifts, new tail etc.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (4,4), I can move to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut life span turn 37: countdown 1, so available on turn 37.\n\nTurn 37 move to (4,5), eat food.\n\nBut is head adjacent to tail before move?\n\nBefore move on turn 37, head at (4,4), tail at? After turn 36 move to (4,4): let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 35: head at (5,5) (after moving from (5,6) to (5,5)), positions: head (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 36: move to (5,4) for example.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (5,4), direction Down.\n\nNew head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,4)\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nHead at (5,4), not adjacent to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 37: from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or other.\n\nIf I move to (4,4), which is tail, no food, so head to (4,4), new head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), etc., new tail (3,4) or something.\n\nThen (4,5) is still free.\n\nFrom (4,4), on turn 38, I can move Up to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut life span: on turn 38, countdown should be 0? Turn 33:5, turn 34:4, turn 35:3, turn 36:2, turn 37:1, turn 38:0, disappeared. So on turn 38, food is gone, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 37: countdown 1, available.\n\nOn turn 37, head at (5,4), I can move directly to (4,5)? (5,4) to (4,5) is not adjacent, not possible.\n\nI can move to (4,4) or (5,5), but (5,5) is body.\n\nFrom (5,4), move to (4,4) on turn 37.\n\nThen on turn 38, from (4,4) move to (4,5), but food gone on turn 38.\n\nSo I miss the food.\n\nIf on turn 36 from (5,4), I move to (4,4), then on turn 37 from (4,4) to (4,5), but turn 37: countdown 1, so I can eat on turn 37 if I move to (4,5) from (4,4).\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 36, I move to (4,4) (Left), then head at (4,4) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (4,4), I can move Up to (4,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 37: countdown 1, so available, I eat.\n\nBut before moving, on turn 37, head at (4,4), tail at? After turn 36 move to (4,4): positions head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (3,4)\n\nSo tail at (3,4), head at (4,4), adjacent? (4,4) and (3,4) are adjacent left.\n\nTail cell is (3,4), which has no food, food is at (4,5).\n\nHead moving to (4,5), which is not tail, and not adjacent to tail? Tail at (3,4), (4,5) is not adjacent to (3,4); diagonal.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nMove to (4,5) on turn 37, eat food, snake grows, so new positions: head (4,5), then previous head (4,4) becomes body, and tail stays, so new body includes (4,4), (5,4), etc., and tail is still (3,4)? When eating, the tail does not move, so segments: new head (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — 11 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nSo I can eat the food on turn 37.\n\nBut it's tight, and I used several moves.\n\nOn the other hand, the food at (2,1) is available for longer.\n\nBut let's think about the initial choice.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the far food (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom head at (3,6), I can go left to (2,6), then as earlier, I was forced to go left and down, to (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc., which is away from (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), so from (3,6), going left to (2,6) is closer, but then I have to go down to reach y=1.\n\nBut from (2,6), I could only go left and down as per earlier simulation.\n\nOn turn 33, if I go left to (2,6), then turn 34 only left to (1,6), turn 35 down to (1,5), turn 36 down to (1,4), then from (1,4) down to (1,3), and so on, to (1,1) eventually, but (2,1) is at (2,1), not (1,1).\n\nFrom (1,4), I can only go down to (1,3), then (1,2), then (1,1), then stuck or something.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), so I need to go right at some point.\n\nFrom (1,2) for example, I can go right to (2,2), then down to (2,1), but it takes many turns.\n\nLife span of (2,1) is 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I might miss the (4,5) food.\n\nSince (4,5) has short life, and I can eat it with the right moves, as above.\n\nBut in the right path, I can eat it on turn 37.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output moves for several turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many, but at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn t1=33.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the internal obstacle at (5,2), which might be in the way if I go south.\n\nFor now, let's decide on turn 33 move.\n\nIf I go right to (4,6), I can potentially eat (4,5) on turn 37.\n\nIf I go left, I might not eat it.\n\nSo I think going right is better to have a chance at the food.\n\nMoreover, going right might open more space.\n\nLet's plan the moves.\n\nTurn 33: from (3,6), go Right to (4,6)\n\nDirection now Right.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6), only possible move is Right to (5,6) as earlier, since Down to (4,5) occupied, Left invalid.\n\nSo go Right to (5,6)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nTurn 35: from (5,6), possible moves: Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6)\n\nIf I go Down to (5,5), then as before, I can free (4,5) later.\n\nIf I go Right to (6,6), let's see.\n\nGo Right to (6,6): head to (6,6), new positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\n(4,5) still occupied and now tail.\n\nThen from (6,6), direction Right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (6,7) wall invalid\n\n- Down: (6,5) - free\n\n- Left: (5,6) - body, index 1, collision, and opposite, invalid\n\n- Right: (7,6) wall, x=7, invalid\n\nSo only Down to (6,5)\n\nTurn 36: move to (6,5)\n\nHead at (6,5), direction Down.\n\nBody: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\n(4,5) occupied.\n\nThen from (6,5), move to (6,4) or other.\n\n(6,4) was tail earlier, but now free? Not in body.\n\nBut (6,4) might be wall? x=6 not border, y=4, not wall.\n\nDown to (6,4), Left to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is still occupied, and life span decreasing.\n\nIf I go this way, I might not free (4,5) in time.\n\nSo to eat (4,5), it's better to go Down from (5,6) on turn 35.\n\nSo turn 35: from (5,6) go Down to (5,5)\n\nThen as before.\n\nTurn 35: to (5,5)\n\nDirection Down.\n\nThen turn 36: from (5,5), go Down to (5,4) to free (4,5)\n\nMove to (5,4)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction Down.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nThen turn 37: from (5,4), go Left to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4), direction Left.\n\nThen turn 38: from (4,4), go Up to (4,5) to eat food.\n\nBut on turn 38, food disappears? Turn 33: life span 5, turn 34:4, turn 35:3, turn 36:2, turn 37:1, turn 38:0 gone. So on turn 38, not available.\n\nTurn 37: countdown 1, available.\n\nOn turn 37, head at (5,4), I can go directly to (4,5)? Not adjacent.\n\nI need to be at (4,4) on turn 37 to move to (4,5) on turn 37.\n\nBut on turn 37, if I am at (4,4), I can move to (4,5).\n\nHow to be at (4,4) on turn 37.\n\nFrom turn 36: head at (5,4)\n\nOn turn 36, from (5,4), instead of moving to (4,4), I could move to other places, but I need to reach (4,4) or adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,4), move to (4,4) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (4,4) move to (4,5).\n\nTurn 37: move to (4,5), eat.\n\nLife span: on turn 37, countdown 1, available.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, before eating, on turn 37, head at (4,4), tail at? After turn 36 move to (4,4): positions head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (3,4)\n\nHead at (4,4), tail at (3,4), adjacent left.\n\nBut tail cell is (3,4), no food, food is at (4,5), which is not tail.\n\nMoving to (4,5), not tail, so no problem.\n\nEat, grow.\n\nSo this works.\n\nFor the other food (2,1), I can go after.\n\nNow for the moves, I need to output from turn 33.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can head towards (2,1).\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to specify actions for several turns, say 5 turns: turn 33 to 37 or 38.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 37, I can include that.\n\nNow, what about the direction constraints.\n\nLet's list the moves:\n\nTurn 33: from (3,6) go Right to (4,6)  // direction now Right\n\nTurn 34: from (4,6) go Right to (5,6)  // direction Right\n\nTurn 35: from (5,6) go Down to (5,5)  // direction Down (since from (5,6) to (5,5), y-1)\n\nTurn 36: from (5,5) go Down to (5,4)  // direction Down\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) — tail (4,4)\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nTurn 37: from (5,4) go Left to (4,4)  // direction Left\n\nNow at (4,4), direction Left.\n\nTurn 38: from (4,4) go Up to (4,5) to eat.  // direction Up\n\nBut on turn 38, food might be gone? Turn 38: countdown should be 0 if turn 37 was 1, so not available.\n\nProblem: turn 37: countdown 1, so I need to eat on turn 37.\n\nOn turn 37, after moving to (4,4), I can immediately go Up to (4,5) on the same turn? No, each turn one move.\n\nOn turn 37, I am moving from (5,4) to (4,4), which is not eating.\n\nThen on turn 38, I move to (4,5), but turn 38 countdown 0, food gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nOn turn 37, I need to be at a position where I can move to (4,5) directly.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 36, instead of moving to (4,4), I can move to (5,3) or (6,4), but not to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not adjacent to (5,4).\n\nSo I cannot reach (4,5) from (5,4) in one move.\n\nThe only way is to be at (4,4) or (5,5) or (4,6) or (3,5), but (5,5) is body, not free; (4,6) might be free but not adjacent; etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), the only adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(4,5) is not adjacent to (5,4).\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (4,5) from (5,4).\n\nTherefore, I must be at (4,4) on turn 36 to move to (4,5) on turn 37.\n\nBut on turn 36, if I move to (4,4), then on turn 37 move to (4,5).\n\nBut turn 37: countdown 1, available.\n\nTurn 36: countdown 2, available.\n\nSo on turn 37, I can eat.\n\nIn the move sequence:\n\nTurn 36: from (5,5) go Down to (5,4)? On turn 36, from (5,5) I can go to (5,4) or other.\n\nTo be at (4,4) on turn 36, I need to go directly.\n\nFrom turn 35: at (5,5), I can go Left to (4,5) but that would be eating with danger, or I can go to (4,4).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go Left to (4,5) but dangerous, or Down to (5,4), or Right to (6,5).\n\n(4,4) is also possible? From (5,5), Left to (4,5) or Down to (5,4), etc. (4,4) is not adjacent to (5,5); (5,5) to (4,4) is diagonal.\n\nSo only up, down, left, right.\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,4) down, (5,6) up, (4,5) left, (6,5) right.\n\n(4,4) is not adjacent.\n\nSo from (5,5), I can go to (4,5) but dangerous, or to (5,4), or to (6,5), or up to (5,6) but body.\n\nEarlier, only (5,4) or (6,5) or (4,5) with risk.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) on turn 36, then I am at (5,4), and (4,5) is free but not adjacent.\n\nThen I can go to (4,4) on turn 37, then to (4,5) on turn 38, but turn 38 food gone.\n\nNot possible to eat (4,5) if I go this way.\n\nOn turn 35, from (5,6), instead of going Down to (5,5), I can go Right to (6,6), but that delays freeing (4,5).\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,6) on turn 35, then to (6,5) on turn 36, then (4,5) is still occupied as tail or body.\n\nOn turn 36 from (6,5), I can go Down to (6,4), then etc., but (4,5) not freed soon.\n\nLife span short, so I might not eat it.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat (4,5) is to go to (4,5) when it is not tail or with care.\n\nBut from turn 33, if I go left to (2,6), then in the simulation, on turn 36, (4,5) is freed, but head at (1,4), too far.\n\nSo I think it's not feasible to eat (4,5) within its life span without taking risks, or it's tight.\n\nPerhaps I should abandon (4,5) and go for (2,1) directly.\n\n(2,1) has life span 8, so I have until turn 40 to eat it.\n\nFrom head at (3,6), go left to (2,6) on turn 33.\n\nThen turn 34: to (1,6) as only choice.\n\nTurn 35: to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36: to (1,4)\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go down to (1,3), then (1,2), then (1,1), then from (1,1) I can go right to (2,1) but (2,1) is at (2,1), so from (1,1) to (2,1) is right, possible.\n\nBut at (1,1), I can go right to (2,1) on turn say 38 or something.\n\nLet's count turns:\n\nTurn 33: to (2,6)\n\nTurn 34: to (1,6)\n\nTurn 35: to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36: to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37: to (1,3)  // from (1,4) down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 38: to (1,2)  // down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 39: to (1,1)  // down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 40: to (2,1)  // right to (2,1), eat food.\n\nLife span of (2,1): turn 33:8, turn 34:7, ..., turn 40:1, available on turn 40.\n\nTurn 41:0 gone, so on turn 40 I can eat.\n\nAnd no danger, since (2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (2,1), head at (1,1), tail at? Depends, but not adjacent or not issue.\n\nSo this works, and I get the food.\n\nThe (4,5) food will disappear, but it's only +1, and I can get (2,1) +1 later.\n\nWith less risk.\n\nIn the first approach, I might not get (4,5) and waste moves.\n\nSo perhaps better to go for the safe food.\n\nMoreover, in the left path, I have to go down, but there's an obstacle at (5,2), but I'm going to (1,1), so not affected.\n\nSo for long-term, going left is better.\n\nThen after eating (2,1), I can explore other areas.\n\nBut for now, I need to output moves for turn 33 onwards.\n\nSince the answer format is to output actions for several turns, I can do turn 33 to 37 or 38.\n\nLet's decide turn 33 action.\n\nI think going Left to (2,6) is safer and I can get the food later.\n\nSo turn 33: Left\n\nThen turn 34: from (2,6) only Left to (1,6)\n\nTurn 35: from (1,6) only Down to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36: from (1,5) only Down to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37: from (1,4) only Down to (1,3)\n\nThen I can continue, but for the box, perhaps output 5 turns.\n\nTurn 33 to 37.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: L\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nBut after that, I need to go to (1,2), (1,1), then (2,1).\n\nBut for the answer, it's fine.\n\nTo maximize score, I get one food instead of none.\n\nIf I go right, I might get both, but risky and not guaranteed.\n\nSo I think Left is better.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 33):**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,2)).\n- **Snake:** Head at (3,6), direction Up. Positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)] (10 segments).\n- **Food:**\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 37; available turns 33-37).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 40; available turns 33-40).\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 33):** From (3,6), current direction Up. Cannot reverse to Down. Up (to (3,7)) is a wall. Left (to (2,6)) and Right (to (4,6)) are valid. Down is invalid (body collision at (3,5)).\n- **Food at (4,5):** Occupied by the snake body (segment at index 6). To eat it:\n  - Must free (4,5) by moving the body away.\n  - Life span short (only 5 turns left); must be eaten by turn 37.\n  - Eating it risks \"tail reward danger\" if head is adjacent to tail when moving onto it.\n  - Simulations show that reaching and eating (4,5) by turn 37 is possible but tight and risky (e.g., requires precise moves to free the cell and avoid collisions).\n- **Food at (2,1):** Unoccupied, far from head (distance: |3-2| + |6-1| = 6 cells). Life span longer (8 turns left); can be reached safely by turn 40.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** Prioritize avoiding risks. Attempting to eat (4,5) requires convoluted pathing near the body, increasing collision risk. Moving directly toward (2,1) is safer and ensures at least one food is eaten.\n- **Path to (2,1):** From (3,6), moving Left to (2,6) starts a path southward. Due to movement constraints (no instant reverse, walls, body), the snake is forced down the left column (x=1) to (1,1), then right to (2,1) by turn 40. This avoids the internal obstacle at (5,2) and body collisions.\n- **Decision:** Abandon (4,5) due to high risk and low reward probability. Focus on (2,1) for guaranteed +1 score. Path to (2,1) is safe and achievable within life span.\n\n**Move Sequence (5 Turns Ahead):**\n- **Turn 33:** Move Left (L) to (2,6). (Direction: Left)\n- **Turn 34:** From (2,6), direction Left. Only valid move is Left (L) to (1,6) (Up wall, Down body, Right invalid). (Direction: Left)\n- **Turn 35:** From (1,6), direction Left. Only valid move is Down (D) to (1,5) (Up wall, Left wall, Right invalid). (Direction: Down)\n- **Turn 36:** From (1,5), direction Down. Only valid move is Down (D) to (1,4) (Up body, Left wall, Right body). (Direction: Down)\n- **Turn 37:** From (1,4), direction Down. Only valid move is Down (D) to (1,3) (Up body, Left wall, Right body). (Direction: Down)\n\n**Beyond Turn 37 (for context, not output):**\n- Turn 38: Continue Down to (1,2).\n- Turn 39: Continue Down to (1,1).\n- Turn 40: Move Right to (2,1) to eat food (life span 1, available).\n\nThis plan ensures:\n- Survival: Avoids body/wall collisions and risky food attempts.\n- Score: Eats (2,1) for +1 by turn 40.\n- Efficiency: Uses forced moves to minimize unnecessary risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: L (left)  \nTurn 34: L (left)  \nTurn 35: D (down)  \nTurn 36: D (down)  \nTurn 37: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 34. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Let me list these out to visualize:\n\n- Head: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (5,4)  // that's the tail\n\nSince there are 10 positions, the snake is 10 cells long.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so it's moving left. Last move was to (2,6) from... since head was at (3,6) before? Positions are given head first, so from turn 33 to 34, it moved from (3,6) to (2,6), so direction L is correct.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (4,5), life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns including current turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 34, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 37? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so at turn t, life span N, turn t+1: N-1, ..., turn t+(N-1): 1, turn t+N: disappears, so it can be eaten until turn t+(N-1).\n\nFor (4,5) at turn 34, life span 4: can be eaten on turns 34,35,36,37? Since after turn 37 it disappears.\n\nTurn 34: life span 4 → after turn 34, it decreases to 3, so at start of turn 35, life span is 3, etc. But the food can be eaten during the turn when the head moves onto it.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears after the turn.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during turn t, it is eaten, and then the food is gone, regardless of life span.\n\nIf life span is 1 at start of turn, after the turn it disappears, so it can only be eaten that turn if head moves to it.\n\nSimilarly, for life span 4 at turn 34:\n\n- Turn 34: life span 4, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 35: life span 3, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 36: life span 2, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 37: life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 37, it disappears, so not available on turn 38.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(2,1) life span 7: lasts until turn 40 (34+6=40, since 34 to 40 is 7 turns? Turn 34: span 7, turn 35:6, ..., turn 40: span 1, turn 41: gone, so can be eaten from turn 34 to 40.\n\nTurn 34 to turn 40 inclusive is 7 turns: 34,35,36,37,38,39,40.\n\nLife span 7 means it can be eaten for 7 turns starting from now.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life span 10: can be eaten from turn 34 to 43.\n\nNow, current head position (2,6), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L, it can move U, D, L, but not R because reverse is not allowed? The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is the last move direction, which is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So cannot move right on this turn.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left). Not R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake body: positions from head to tail: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nFood at: (4,5), (2,1), (2,3)\n\n(4,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake segments: (4,5) is one of the body segments, specifically the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: head (2,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is the 7th segment? Index 7: (4,5), which is the body.\n\nBut food is also at (4,5), with value 1, life span 4.\n\nBut the snake body is on (4,5), so the food is under the body.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,5), the food is under the snake body at segment 7.\n\nTo eat it, the body must move away, meaning that segment is no longer there, and then head moves to (4,5).\n\nCurrently, head is at (2,6), which is not adjacent to (4,5), so we need to consider if we can get there.\n\nFirst, let's find possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (2,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- D: (2,5) – (2,5) is occupied by snake body, segment 3? Positions: (2,5) is index 3, which is body. But can we move to tail? The rule: \"can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nTail is at (5,4), which is not (2,5), so (2,5) is a body segment, not tail. Moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n\nLet me list all occupied cells by snake: {(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)}\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n\nSo moving to (2,5) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, L: left to (1,6) – what is there? x=1,y=6, not wall, not occupied? Walls only borders and (5,2), so (1,6) should be free, but need to check if it's occupied.\n\nOccupied cells: snake positions, so (1,6) not in list, so free.\n\nD: (2,5) occupied, as above.\n\nU: (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nR: right to (3,6) – but (3,6) is occupied by segment 1, which is body, not tail. And cannot move right anyway because reverse not allowed? Current direction L, opposite R, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU: (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (2,5) body, invalid.\n\nL: (1,6) – let's see, (1,6) is within bounds, x=1>0, y=6<7, not wall, not occupied, so valid.\n\nOnly possible move is L to (1,6)? But U and D are invalid, R not allowed, so only L is possible? But that seems dangerous because we might get stuck.\n\nIs there another option? What about the tail? Tail is at (5,4), but we can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nCurrent head (2,6), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,7) - wall\n\n- Down: (2,5) - occupied by snake body (segment 3)\n\n- Left: (1,6) - free, I assume\n\n- Right: (3,6) - occupied by snake body (segment 1)\n\nAnd right is reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is left to (1,6).\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nWalls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,6) is x=1,y=6, not border, and not (5,2) obstacle, so free.\n\nSnake not there, so yes, only move is L to (1,6).\n\nBut we need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6), what next?\n\nAlso, we have food to consider.\n\nFirst, let's simulate the move.\n\nTurn 34: move L to (1,6)\n\nNow, snake positions after move: head moves to (1,6), then each segment moves to previous position, tail moves away from (5,4) to where? When snake moves, head to new position, each body segment to previous segment's position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed, so new snake: head (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and tail (5,4) is removed, so now snake has 9 segments? Original 10 segments, move without eating, tail removed, so 9 segments.\n\nPositions: after moving to (1,6):\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Body: previous head (2,6) now segment 1\n\n- Then (3,6) segment 2\n\n- (3,5) segment 3\n\n- (2,5) segment 4\n\n- (2,4) segment 5\n\n- (3,4) segment 6\n\n- (4,4) segment 7\n\n- (4,5) segment 8\n\n- (5,5) segment 9 (tail)\n\nTail is now (5,5)\n\nAnd the cell (5,4) is now free.\n\nFood at (4,5) was under segment, but segment moved? (4,5) was segment 7, but after move, segment 7 is now at (4,4)? Let's see:\n\nBefore move: segments:\n\n0: (2,6) head\n\n1: (3,6)\n\n2: (3,5)\n\n3: (2,5)\n\n4: (2,4)\n\n5: (3,4)\n\n6: (4,4)\n\n7: (4,5)\n\n8: (5,5)\n\n9: (5,4) tail\n\nAfter move to (1,6):\n\nHead to (1,6)\n\nSegment 1 to (2,6)  // previous head\n\nSegment 2 to (3,6)  // previous seg1\n\nSegment 3 to (3,5)  // previous seg2\n\nSegment 4 to (2,5)  // previous seg3\n\nSegment 5 to (2,4)  // previous seg4\n\nSegment 6 to (3,4)  // previous seg5\n\nSegment 7 to (4,4)  // previous seg6\n\nSegment 8 to (5,5)  // previous seg7? Previous seg7 was (4,5), so segment 8 goes to (4,5)\n\nNew positions:\n\n- New head: (1,6)\n\n- New seg1: (2,6)  // old head\n\n- New seg2: (3,6)  // old seg1\n\n- New seg3: (3,5)  // old seg2\n\n- New seg4: (2,5)  // old seg3\n\n- New seg5: (2,4)  // old seg4\n\n- New seg6: (3,4)  // old seg5\n\n- New seg7: (4,4)  // old seg6\n\n- New seg8: (4,5)  // old seg7\n\n- New seg9: (5,5)  // old seg8, and tail since old tail removed\n\nOld seg8 was (5,5), now becomes new tail.\n\nOld seg9 (5,4) is gone.\n\nSo now snake: head (1,6), tail (5,5)\n\nFood at (4,5) is still there? (4,5) is now occupied by new seg8, so the food is under the body again? New seg8 is at (4,5), which is where food is.\n\nBut food was at (4,5), and now snake segment is there, so food is still under body.\n\nTo eat it, we need the body to move away from (4,5) and head to move there.\n\nBut head is at (1,6), far away.\n\nAlso, food life span: at turn 34, life span 4, so after turn 34, it decreases to 3 at turn 35.\n\nNow, at turn 35, head at (1,6), direction? Last move was L, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (1,6):\n\n- U: (1,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (1,5) - what is here? Not occupied, I think. Snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nSo (1,5) not in list, free.\n\n- L: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,6) - occupied by seg1, body, not tail. Tail is (5,5). And moving right is not reverse? Last direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R because instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,5) or U invalid, L invalid, R not allowed.\n\nU and L invalid, R not allowed, so only D to (1,5).\n\nThen move to (1,5).\n\nNow turn 35: move D to (1,5)\n\nSnake: head to (1,5), then body: seg1 to (1,6), seg2 to (2,6), seg3 to (3,6), seg4 to (3,5), seg5 to (2,5), seg6 to (2,4), seg7 to (3,4), seg8 to (4,4), seg9 to (4,5), tail at (4,5)? New tail is old seg9 (5,5)? Let's see.\n\nAfter move:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nSeg1: (1,6)  // old head\n\nSeg2: (2,6)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3: (3,6)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (3,5)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5: (2,5)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6: (2,4)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7: (3,4)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8: (4,4)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9: (4,5)  // old seg8, and tail? Old seg8 was (4,5), now new seg9 at (4,5), but tail is this since old tail (5,5) is removed? Old seg9 was (5,5), which is gone.\n\nPositions: new head (1,5), then:\n\n- Seg1: old head (1,6)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (2,6)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (3,6)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (3,5)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (2,5)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (2,4)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (3,4)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (4,4)\n\n- Seg9: old seg8 (4,5)  // now tail\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nFood at (4,5) is under the tail now? But tail will move when we move, so if we eat food, tail doesn't move, but here no food eaten.\n\n(4,5) has food, and now tail is there.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to a food cell, it eats it, but (4,5) is occupied by tail, so head cannot move there because it's occupied, unless it's the tail and we can move to tail.\n\nThe rule: \"can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if head moves to tail position, and tail moves away, no collision, and if there is food, it can be eaten.\n\nIn this case, at turn 35, after moving, tail is at (4,5), which has food.\n\nBut head is at (1,5), far away.\n\nNow, from (1,5), last move was D (down), so direction D.\n\nPossible moves for turn 36.\n\nFrom (1,5):\n\n- U: (1,6) - occupied by seg1, body, not tail. Tail is at (4,5), so (1,6) is body, collision if move there.\n\n- D: (1,4) - free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: (0,5) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,5) - occupied by seg5? Snake positions: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) is seg5, body, not tail, so occupied.\n\nAlso, moving R is not reverse? Last direction D, opposite is U, so R is allowed, but (2,5) is occupied, so invalid.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6) occupied, invalid; D to (1,4) free; L invalid; R to (2,5) occupied, invalid. So only D to (1,4).\n\nThen move D to (1,4).\n\nThis is getting us trapped in the left column.\n\nWe need to think differently. At turn 34, only possible move is L to (1,6), but then we are forced down to (1,5) and (1,4), and so on, to (1,0) or something, but we have food to eat.\n\nBut let's list all food and plan.\n\nFood:\n\n1. (4,5) value 1, life span 4 at turn 34, so can be eaten until turn 37.\n\n2. (2,1) value 1, life span 7, can be eaten until turn 40.\n\n3. (2,3) value 1, life span 10, can be eaten until turn 43.\n\nHead at (2,6), only move to (1,6).\n\nFrom (1,6), only move to (1,5).\n\nFrom (1,5), only move to (1,4).\n\nFrom (1,4), what? Last move D, so direction D.\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- U: (1,5) - occupied by previous position, but after move, it might be body. Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 36, after moving to (1,4) from (1,5).\n\nAt turn 35: head at (1,5), after move D to (1,4) for turn 36.\n\nSnake: head to (1,4), then seg1 to (1,5), seg2 to (1,6), seg3 to (2,6), seg4 to (3,6), seg5 to (3,5), seg6 to (2,5), seg7 to (2,4), seg8 to (3,4), seg9 to (4,4), tail at (4,4)? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nThe point is, we are moving down the left wall, and the snake body is blocking us from moving right.\n\nBut there is a food at (2,3), which is below.\n\nWe need to reach the food.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) is under body, but we can try to free it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 34, is there a way to not move left? But from current position, only left is possible, as per constraints.\n\nUnless I missed something.\n\nCurrent head (2,6), walls: U (2,7) wall, D (2,5) snake body, L (1,6) free, R (3,6) snake body and reverse not allowed. So only L.\n\nSo we must move to (1,6) on turn 34.\n\nThen from (1,6), only D to (1,5) on turn 35.\n\nFrom (1,5), only D to (1,4) on turn 36.\n\nNow turn 36: head at (1,4), last move D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,5) - occupied by snake body (seg1, since after move to (1,4), seg1 is at (1,5))\n\n- D: (1,3) - free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: (0,4) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,4) - occupied? Snake positions after turn 35 move to (1,5): let's state positions at start of turn 36.\n\nAt start of turn 36, before move, snake positions from turn 35: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5) tail.\n\nFor turn 36, head at (1,5), we move to (1,4) as planned.\n\nAfter move: head (1,4), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (1,6), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (2,5), seg7 (2,4), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (4,4), tail at (4,4).\n\nNow at turn 37, head at (1,4), last move D.\n\nPossible moves for turn 37:\n\n- U: (1,5) - occupied by seg1, body, collision\n\n- D: (1,3) - free\n\n- L: (0,4) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,4) - occupied by seg7? Positions: seg7 is at (2,4), body, not tail, so occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, continue down to (1,2), (1,1), etc.\n\nBut at (1,1), we can move to (2,1) if possible, but (2,1) has food.\n\nFirst, let's see when we reach y=1.\n\nAlso, food at (2,3) and (2,1).\n\nFor example, at some point, when we move down, the body might move away, allowing us to move right.\n\nLet's list the snake positions as we move down.\n\nAt turn 34: move L to (1,6)\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 35: move D to (1,5)\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 36: move D to (1,4)\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\n(2,4) is occupied, but in positions, (2,4) is seg7 or something.\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)  // since only choice\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 38: from (1,3), last move D, move D to (1,2)\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 39: from (1,2), move D to (1,1)\n\nPositions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 40: from (1,1), last move D, possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,2) occupied by body\n\n- D: (1,0) - y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (0,1) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,1) - free? Not occupied, and not wall.\n\n(2,1) has food, and it's free now? In positions, tail is at (2,5), so (2,1) not occupied.\n\nSo we can move R to (2,1) and eat the food there.\n\nTurn 40: food at (2,1) has life span 7 at turn 34, so at turn 40, life span: started at 7, turn 34:7,35:6,36:5,37:4,38:3,39:2,40:1, so can be eaten on turn 40.\n\nYes.\n\nSo on turn 40, we can move to (2,1) and eat the food.\n\nBut we need to get there.\n\nFrom turn 34 to 40, we are moving down to (1,1), then on turn 40 move R to (2,1).\n\nBut during this, we are not eating other food.\n\nFood at (4,5) life span 4, turn 34 to 37, but by turn 37, head is at (1,3) or something, far from (4,5), so we can't eat it, it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,3) life span 10, turn 34 to 43, so available.\n\nAt turn 40, after eating (2,1), snake grows, so tail not removed.\n\nBut let's focus on the path.\n\nWe also have the food at (2,3) which we can eat later.\n\nBut is there a better way? For example, can we eat (2,3) earlier?\n\nAt turn 37, head at (1,3), but (2,3) is at (2,3), which is adjacent, but can we move to it?\n\nAt turn 37, head at (1,3), last move D.\n\nPossible moves: U (1,4) occupied, D (1,2) free, L invalid, R (2,3) free? Let's see positions at turn 37 start.\n\nAt turn 37 start: before move, positions from turn 36: after move to (1,4), so head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nFor turn 37, we move to (1,3), so (2,3) is free, not occupied.\n\n(2,3) has food, and is free.\n\nFrom (1,3), we can move R to (2,3) if possible.\n\nBut last move was D to (1,3)? At turn 37, we are at (1,3) after moving from (1,4) with D direction.\n\nFrom (1,3), last move direction D.\n\nPossible moves for turn 38:\n\n- U: (1,4) - occupied by body (seg1)\n\n- D: (1,2) - free\n\n- L: (0,3) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,3) - free, and not reverse (last direction D, opposite U, so R allowed)\n\nSo we can move R to (2,3) on turn 38? Turn 38.\n\nLet's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 34: move to (1,6)\n\nTurn 35: move to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36: move to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37: move to (1,3)  // as per earlier\n\nAt start of turn 37, head at (1,4), we move to (1,3)\n\nAfter move, positions for turn 37 end: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nNow for turn 38, head at (1,3), last move D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (1,4): occupied by seg1, body, collision, invalid\n\nD to (1,2): free, not occupied\n\nL to (0,3): wall, invalid\n\nR to (2,3): free, not occupied, and direction allowed.\n\nSo we can choose to move R to (2,3) or D to (1,2).\n\nIf we move R to (2,3), we eat the food at (2,3), since it's there.\n\n(2,3) has food with value 1.\n\nThen snake grows, so tail not removed.\n\nLife span of (2,3) is 10 at turn 34, so turn 38 is fine.\n\nThen we eat it on turn 38.\n\nOtherwise, if we move D to (1,2), we continue down.\n\nBut eating earlier is better, I think, for score and to avoid risk.\n\nAfter eating, we grow, so the body might block more, but in this case, moving to (2,3) is good.\n\nNow, what about the food at (4,5)? It might be gone or not.\n\nAt turn 38, (4,5) food: life span 4 at turn 34, so turn 34:4, 35:3, 36:2, 37:1, 38:0? After turn 37, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so on turn 38 it's gone.\n\nTurn 34: life span 4, after turn 34:3, after turn 35:2, after turn 36:1, after turn 37:0, so at start of turn 38, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 37, life span 1, can be eaten, but head at (1,3), far from (4,5), impossible.\n\nSo (4,5) food will be missed.\n\nNow, back to turn 38 decision.\n\nAt turn 38, from (1,3), we can move R to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nOr move D to (1,2).\n\nMoving R to (2,3) is better, as we get the food immediately.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows, so positions: head to (2,3), then body follows, tail stays.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,3), seg1 (1,4), seg2 (1,5), seg3 (1,6), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (3,6), seg6 (3,5), seg7 (2,5), seg8 (2,4), seg9 (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,3) and eat food, new head (2,3), then seg1 to (1,3), seg2 to (1,4), ..., up to seg9 to (2,4)? And since food eaten, new segment added, so tail is new at the previous tail position? When food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nStandard snake: when eat food, head moves to food cell, body segments follow, tail stays, so snake length increases by one.\n\nSo after eating at (2,3): head (2,3), then seg1: previous head (1,3), seg2: previous seg1 (1,4), seg3: previous seg2 (1,5), seg4: previous seg3 (1,6), seg5: previous seg4 (2,6), seg6: previous seg5 (3,6), seg7: previous seg6 (3,5), seg8: previous seg7 (2,5), seg9: previous seg8 (2,4), and new segment at previous tail (3,4), so positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nNew tail at (3,4)\n\nNow, last move was R to (2,3), so direction R.\n\nFrom here, we can plan further.\n\nBut for now, at turn 34, we must move L.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut we need to output for multiple turns.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and output the actions starting from turn 34.\n\nBut since we don't know future food, we need to plan based on current state.\n\nPerhaps for turn 34, action is L, as we have no choice.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, we can choose when possible.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 38, we can choose to eat (2,3).\n\nBut to output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the state changes, we might need to simulate.\n\nBut for the answer, we can output the planned actions, but be flexible if needed.\n\nThe format is to output for turns starting from t1=34.\n\nAnd we think ahead.\n\nSince at turn 34 only one choice, we do that.\n\nThen at turn 35, from (1,6), only D to (1,5), no choice.\n\nTurn 36, from (1,5), only D to (1,4), no choice? Earlier I thought from (1,5) at turn 36 start, but turn 36 action is from (1,5) to (1,4).\n\nAt turn 37, from (1,4) to (1,3).\n\nAt turn 38, from (1,3), we have choices: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3).\n\nWe should choose R to (2,3) to eat the food.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we need to output 5 turns or more? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from turn 34.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 34 to 38 or something.\n\nBut let's see how many we can do.\n\nFirst, turn 34: move L\n\nThen turn 35: move D\n\nTurn 36: move D\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)\n\nNow turn 38: move R to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nThen after that, from (2,3), direction R.\n\nNow possible moves: U (2,4), D (2,2), L (1,3), R (3,3)\n\nNow, (2,4) is occupied? Positions after eating: head (2,3), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (3,6), seg7 (3,5), seg8 (2,5), seg9 (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nSo (2,4) is seg9, body, not tail, so occupied.\n\n(1,3) is seg1, body, occupied.\n\n(2,2) free? Not occupied.\n\n(3,3) free? Not occupied.\n\nAlso, last direction R, so opposite L not allowed? Last move to (2,3) from (1,3) with R, so direction R.\n\nOpposite is L, so cannot move L to (1,3), which is occupied anyway.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4) occupied, invalid; D to (2,2) free; L not allowed; R to (3,3) free.\n\nSo can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nNow, to maximize score, we need to find other food or survive.\n\nFood left: (2,1) but we ate (2,3), and (2,1) is at (2,1), life span until turn 40.\n\nAt turn 38, (2,1) can be eaten until turn 40.\n\n(2,1) is below.\n\nIf we move D to (2,2), then to (2,1) next turn.\n\nFrom (2,3), if move D to (2,2), then from (2,2), last direction D, can move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\n(2,1) is free? Positions: after moving to (2,2), let's see.\n\nAt turn 38, after moving to (2,3) and eating, positions as above.\n\nFor turn 39, move to (2,2): head to (2,2), then seg1 to (2,3), seg2 to (1,3), etc., and since no food, tail removed? When moving without eating, tail removed.\n\nAfter eating at turn 38, snake length 11.\n\nAt turn 39, if move to (2,2), no food there, so tail removed.\n\nPrevious tail at (3,4), removed, so new tail at previous position.\n\nBut (2,1) has food, so if we move to (2,1) on turn 39 or 40.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,2) on turn 39? Turn 39 action.\n\nTurn 38: moved to (2,3)\n\nFor turn 39, from (2,3), move D to (2,2)\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (1,3), seg3 (1,4), ..., up to seg10 (2,4)? After move, tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions: head (2,3), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (3,6), seg7 (3,5), seg8 (2,5), seg9 (2,4), seg10 (3,4) tail? Since ate at turn 38, length 11 segments.\n\nWhen moving to (2,2) without eating, head to (2,2), seg1 to (2,3), seg2 to (1,3), seg3 to (1,4), seg4 to (1,5), seg5 to (1,6), seg6 to (2,6), seg7 to (3,6), seg8 to (3,5), seg9 to (2,5), seg10 to (2,4), and tail removed, so new tail at (2,4)? Seg10 at (2,4), which was seg9 before.\n\nNow, (2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (2,2), last move D, can move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\n(2,1) has food, life span until turn 40.\n\nTurn 39: move to (2,1), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows again.\n\nAfter that, we can explore.\n\nBut back to the beginning, for the answer, we need to output actions from turn 34 onwards.\n\nSince at turn 34, only choice is L.\n\nSimilarly, turn 35 only D.\n\nTurn 36 only D.\n\nTurn 37 only D to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 38, we choose R to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen turn 39, from (2,3), we can move D to (2,2), then turn 40 move D to (2,1) to eat, but (2,1) life span 7 at turn 34, turn 40 is last chance, yes.\n\nBut at turn 39, from (2,3), after moving to (2,2) on turn 39, then turn 40 to (2,1).\n\nBut from (2,3), we could move R to (3,3) on turn 39, but then we might miss (2,1) if not careful.\n\n(2,1) must be eaten by turn 40.\n\nIf we move R to (3,3) on turn 39, then from (3,3), we can go down, but (2,1) might not be reachable in time.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move D to (3,2), then to (3,1) or (2,1), but (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, from (3,2) we can move L to (2,2) then D to (2,1), but that takes two moves.\n\nTurn 39: at (2,3), if move R to (3,3), then turn 40 at (3,3), then to reach (2,1) we need turn 41, but (2,1) disappears after turn 40, so not available on turn 41. So we must eat it by turn 40.\n\nTherefore, on turn 40, head must be at (2,1).\n\nFrom turn 39 position: at turn 39 start, head at (2,3).\n\nTo be at (2,1) on turn 40, we need to move directly or via path.\n\nBut (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2), which is below (2,3).\n\nSo if on turn 39 we move D to (2,2), then on turn 40 move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nIf we move elsewhere on turn 39, we cannot reach (2,1) on turn 40.\n\nFor example, if move R to (3,3) on turn 39, then on turn 40, from (3,3), we can move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), not directly to (2,1), which is two steps away. So impossible to eat (2,1) on turn 40 if not at (2,2) or adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,1) are (2,2), (2,0) invalid, (1,1), (3,1).\n\n(1,1) might be occupied or not, (3,1) similar.\n\nBut on turn 40, if head is at (2,2), it can move D to (2,1).\n\nIf at (1,1), move R to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut from turn 39 head at (2,3), the only way to be at (2,1) on turn 40 is to move directly down twice, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo to be at (2,1) on turn 40, on turn 39 we must be at an adjacent cell, like (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1).\n\n(1,1) and (3,1) may not be reachable from (2,3) in one move? From (2,3), we can move to (2,2), (1,3), (3,3), not directly to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is not adjacent to (2,3), so only possible adjacent cell to reach (2,1) is (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1), but from (2,3), we can only reach (2,2) directly by moving down.\n\nMoving to (1,3) or (3,3) doesn't help for (2,1) next turn.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), we can move to (1,2) or (1,4) or (2,3), not to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), similar.\n\nSo the only way to eat (2,1) on turn 40 is to have head at (2,2) on turn 39, then move D to (2,1).\n\nTherefore, on turn 39, head must be at (2,2).\n\nNow, at turn 38, head is at (1,3), we move to (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nThen on turn 39, from (2,3), we move D to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 40, move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nAfter that, no more food immediately, but we can survive.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: but in this case, no issue.\n\nBack to turn 34.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 34: move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 35: move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3)  // eat food\n\nThen turn 39: move D to (2,2)  // to position for (2,1)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1)  // eat food\n\nBut the answer format should start from turn 34 and go for several turns.\n\nSince we think ahead, output at least 5 turns: 34 to 38 or 39.\n\nBut turn 39 and 40 are part of the plan.\n\nIn the output, we can list actions for turns 34 to 38, for example.\n\nBut let's confirm the food at (2,3) is eaten on turn 38, which is fine.\n\nAnd (2,1) on turn 40.\n\nFor the purpose of this response, since the state might change, but based on current, we can plan.\n\nNow, for the internal obstacle at (5,2), we haven't used it, but it might affect later movements, but for now, not in the way.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) is gone, but we couldn't get it.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 34: L\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R  // to (2,3)\n\nThen beyond, but we can stop at turn 38 for the output, or continue.\n\nSince the instruction is to output in the box, and \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: 34 to 38.\n\nTurn 34 to 38 is 5 actions: 34,35,36,37,38.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 34: L\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nBut on turn 37 we move to (1,3), then turn 38 to (2,3).\n\nIn turn 38, moving R eats the food.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 38, from (1,3), moving R to (2,3) is possible and beneficial.\n\nIf we don't, we go to (1,2), then later to (1,1), then to (2,1) on turn 40, but (2,1) might be eaten, but we miss (2,3) if not eaten, but (2,3) has longer life, so we can eat later, but (2,1) must be eaten by turn 40, so we need to get to it.\n\nBut by eating (2,3) early, we get the score and can still get to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,3), we go down to (2,2) and (2,1).\n\nIf we don't eat (2,3) on turn 38, we go to (1,2) on turn 38, then turn 39 to (1,1), turn 40 to (2,1) to eat, but (2,3) is still there, we can go back, but it might be inefficient.\n\nBut since all food +1, eating earlier or later same score, but to minimize risk, shorter path better.\n\nBut in this case, eating (2,3) on turn 38 is fine.\n\nMoreover, after eating, snake longer, but grid has space.\n\nSo I think the plan is good.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 34: L Turn 35: D Turn 36: D Turn 37: D Turn 38: R }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 34):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,2)).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (2,6), body segments at (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail at (5,4). Length = 10.\n  - Head Direction: Left (L), so cannot reverse to Right (R) on next turn.\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 37).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 40).\n  - (2,3): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 43).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Movement: Cannot move opposite to current direction (no R on turn 34).\n  - Collisions: Walls and body segments are deadly, except moving into the tail is safe if the tail moves.\n  - Food under body: (4,5) is under snake body segment; can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\n**Immediate Move (Turn 34):**\n- From head position (2,6):\n  - Up (U) to (2,7): y=7 is wall, invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (2,5): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision, invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (1,6): Free (not wall or occupied), valid.\n  - Right (R) to (3,6): Occupied by body segment and reverse direction not allowed, invalid.\n- **Only valid move is L to (1,6)**.\n\n**Thinking 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n- **Key Risks**:\n  - Moving left traps the snake along the left wall (x=0), but this path allows access to food at (2,3) and (2,1).\n  - Food at (4,5) is under the body and cannot be reached before it disappears (life span 4, gone after turn 37). Head is too far, so ignore.\n  - Food at (2,1) must be eaten by turn 40 (last chance on turn 40).\n  - Food at (2,3) has long life span (until turn 43) but can be eaten earlier to reduce risk.\n- **Path to Food**:\n  - Turn 34: Move L to (1,6) – only choice, avoids death.\n  - Turn 35: From (1,6), only valid move is D to (1,5) (U wall, L wall, R reverse/occupied).\n  - Turn 36: From (1,5), only valid move is D to (1,4) (U occupied, L wall, R occupied).\n  - Turn 37: From (1,4), only valid move is D to (1,3) (U occupied, L wall, R occupied).\n  - Turn 38: From (1,3), possible moves:\n    - U to (1,4): Occupied by body, invalid.\n    - D to (1,2): Free, valid but delays food.\n    - L to (0,3): Wall, invalid.\n    - R to (2,3): Free and valid; eats food at (2,3) for +1 score and growth.\n    - **Optimal: Move R to (2,3)** to eat food immediately, gaining score and reducing future risk from longer path.\n- **Beyond Turn 38**:\n  - Turn 39: From (2,3), move D to (2,2) to position for (2,1) food.\n  - Turn 40: From (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food (last chance, +1 score).\n- **Why this plan?**\n  - Eats two food items: (2,3) on turn 38 and (2,1) on turn 40, maximizing score (+2) with minimal risk.\n  - Avoids dead ends: Staying left allows controlled descent to food, while moving right at (1,3) accesses food early.\n  - Long-term: After eating, snake can navigate open areas (e.g., right or down from (2,1)) for survival. Food at (2,3) eaten early frees space.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 34-38):**\n- Turns 34-37: Forced moves due to constraints and path.\n- Turn 38: Strategic move to eat food and improve position.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{R} }",

        "step": 35,

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 35. The grid has walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and a block at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,6), then body segments: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake is 10 units long. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,5) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 6, value +1\n\n- (2,3) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,6). Direction is left, so from (1,6), moving left would go to (0,6), but x=0 is a wall, so moving left is impossible because (0,6) is a border wall. That means on this turn, turn 35, I can't move left because it would hit the wall.\n\nBut the head direction is L, so last move was left to (1,6). Now, for turn 35, I need to choose a new direction.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) immediately. Also, moving L to (0,6) is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo available moves from (1,6):\n\n- U: (1,6+1) = (1,7), but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: (1,6-1) = (1,5)\n\n- L: (1-1,6) = (0,6) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (1+1,6) = (2,6), but (2,6) is the second segment of the snake body. Is that a collision?\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves from its position, so if the head moves to where the tail was, it's okay because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, current snake positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nIf I move right to (2,6), which is the next segment. After the move, the head would be at (2,6), and the body segment that was at (2,6) will move to... let's see how the snake moves.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to the new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if I move right to (2,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n\nAfter moving:\n\n- New head position: (2,6)\n\n- The segment that was at (2,6) moves to where the head was? No.\n\nThe positions are a list: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), ...]\n\nAfter moving right:\n\n- Head moves to (2,6)\n\n- Then the body: the first body segment moves to the previous head position (1,6)? No, in snake, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed or something? I think I have it wrong.\n\nStandard snake movement: the head moves to the new direction, and each segment follows, so the tail is cut off if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n\nBut in terms of positions, when you move, the head goes to the new position, and the last segment (tail) is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nFor collision, during movement, if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides.\n\nThe tail will move, so if head moves to where the tail is, it's okay because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, current positions: head (1,6), body segments: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — that's 10 positions, so tail is (5,5).\n\nIf I move right to (2,6), which is occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the head is at (2,6), and the body segments will shift: the segment that was at (2,6) moves to... let's think of the list.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (1,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5), etc.\n\nAfter moving right:\n\n- New head: (2,6)  // which was position 1\n\n- Then the new body: the segment that was at position 0, (1,6), moves to where? In the new body list, position 1 should be where the old head was, but since we moved, the new body starts from old position 0.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position, say P.\n\nThen body[0] = old head position\n\nbody[1] = old body[0]\n\nbody[2] = old body[1]\n\n...\n\nlast body = old body[n-2], and tail is removed.\n\nIn terms of cells: the cell that was the tail is vacated, and the head occupies a new cell.\n\nFor collision: if the new head position is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. Because the tail will move away, so if head moves to tail, it's safe.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,6), which is currently occupied by body segment at index 1. After move, this cell will be the head, and the body segment that was there will move to (1,6), which is old head.\n\nThe cell (2,6) is currently occupied, but it's not the tail; the tail is (5,5). So moving to (2,6) would cause the head to collide with the body segment at (2,6) before it moves, so it's a collision.\n\nYes, so generally, you can only move to the tail cell safely, not to any other body cell.\n\nSo for (1,6):\n\n- Move U: (1,7) — y=7 is wall, invalid\n\n- Move D: (1,5) — let's see what's there. Current positions: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So (1,5) is not in this list, so it should be empty? Also, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, but (1,5) is within bounds, no internal wall there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so (1,5) should be free.\n\n- Move L: (0,6) wall, invalid\n\n- Move R: (2,6) — occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is D, down to (1,5).\n\nBut current direction is L, and moving D is not reverse, since reverse would be R, but R is invalid anyway. Reverse means opposite direction; L and R are horizontal opposites, U and D vertical opposites.\n\nCurrent direction L, opposite is R, which I cannot do due to no instant reverse, but R is invalid for other reasons too.\n\nMoving D is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo for turn 35, I must move down to (1,5).\n\nNow, after moving to (1,5), what happens? No food at (1,5), so snake length remains 10, tail is removed.\n\nNew positions: head at (1,5), then body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). Tail was (5,5), so it's removed, and the new tail is (4,5)? Let's list:\n\nOld positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nAfter moving down to (1,5): new head (1,5)\n\nThen body segments: old head becomes first body segment, so (1,6) is now body[0]\n\nThen body[1] = old body[0] = (2,6)\n\nbody[2] = old body[1] = (3,6)\n\nbody[3] = old body[2] = (3,5)\n\nbody[4] = old body[3] = (2,5)\n\nbody[5] = old body[4] = (2,4)\n\nbody[6] = old body[5] = (3,4)\n\nbody[7] = old body[6] = (4,4)\n\nbody[8] = old body[7] = (4,5)\n\nAnd old body[8] (5,5) is removed, so tail is now (4,5)\n\nNew positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nTail is (4,5)\n\nNow, head direction was L, but now we moved D, so new direction is D? The head direction for next turn will be based on what we do now.\n\nAfter moving down, the head is at (1,5), and we just moved down, so for next turn, current direction is D.\n\nAlso, food: (4,5) is a food with value 1, life span 3, but (4,5) is now occupied by the tail. Food can be under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nCurrently, after move, (4,5) is the tail, and there is food there.\n\nBut the food is at (4,5), which is now the tail cell.\n\nLife span of food: each turn, life span decreases, including current turn? The state is at turn 35, food has life span 3, so after turn 35, it decreases to 2, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nIn the food list, it's given with life span at current turn.\n\nFor (4,5): life span 3 at turn 35. So after turn 35, it decreases to 2, then to 1, then to 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(2,1) life span 6 at turn 35\n\n(2,3) life span 9 at turn 35\n\nNow, for turn 36, head at (1,5), direction D (since we just moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nNo instant reverse: since direction is D, cannot move U (up).\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- U: (1,5+1) = (1,6) — but (1,6) is now a body segment, the first one after head. In new positions, (1,6) is body[0], not tail. Tail is (4,5). So moving to (1,6) would collide with body.\n\n- D: (1,5-1) = (1,4) — is this free? Positions: (1,5) head, (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). (1,4) not in list, and not wall, so should be free.\n\n- L: (1-1,5) = (0,5) — x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: (1+1,5) = (2,5) — (2,5) is in positions, body[4] or something? Positions: indices: head (1,5), body0 (1,6), body1 (2,6), body2 (3,6), body3 (3,5), body4 (2,5), etc. (2,5) is body4, not tail, so occupied, collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is D to (1,4).\n\nBut let's confirm: from (1,5), moving D to (1,4) is down, which is same as current direction, so allowed.\n\nNo food at (1,4), so no growth.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,4), new body: old head (1,5) becomes first body, then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)? (2,4) is body5, but let's list positions.\n\nOld positions after turn 35: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nAfter moving down to (1,4): new head (1,4)\n\nBody: (1,5) from old head\n\nThen (1,6) old body0\n\n(2,6) old body1\n\n(3,6) old body2\n\n(3,5) old body3\n\n(2,5) old body4\n\n(2,4) old body5? Old body5 is (2,4), but (2,4) is a position.\n\nIn the list, body5 is (2,4), body6 is (3,4), body7 is (4,4), body8 is (4,5)\n\nAfter move, new body: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ] and tail (4,5) removed? Tail was (4,5), so it is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is the last, tail.\n\nNow head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nFor turn 37, possible moves.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\n- U: (1,4+1) = (1,5) — occupied by body segment, body[1]? Positions: head (1,4), body0 (1,5), body1 (1,6), etc. (1,5) is body0, not tail, so collision.\n\n- D: (1,4-1) = (1,3) — free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n- L: (0,4) wall\n\n- R: (2,4) — (2,4) is in positions, body[7]? List: head (1,4), body0 (1,5), body1 (1,6), body2 (2,6), body3 (3,6), body4 (3,5), body5 (2,5), body6 (2,4)? Body6 is (2,4), and body7 (3,4), body8 (4,4)\n\n(2,4) is body6, not tail, so occupied, collision.\n\nTail is (4,4).\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, turn 37: move D to (1,3), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (4,4) removed? Old tail (4,4), so new body: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) and (4,4) removed, so tail is (3,4)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (1,3): head (1,3)\n\nBody: old head (1,4) now body0\n\nold body0 (1,5) body1\n\nold body1 (1,6) body2\n\nold body2 (2,6) body3\n\nold body3 (3,6) body4\n\nold body4 (3,5) body5\n\nold body5 (2,5) body6\n\nold body6 (2,4) body7\n\nold body7 (3,4) body8\n\nold body8 (4,4) removed\n\nSo positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTail is (3,4)\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 38: possible moves.\n\nDirection D, cannot move U.\n\n- U: (1,4) — occupied by body0, collision\n\n- D: (1,2) — free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: (0,3) wall\n\n- R: (2,3) — (2,3) is a food position? Food at (2,3) with life span 9, value 1.\n\nBut (2,3) is not in current positions, so free? Positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — no (2,3), so free.\n\nAlso, walls: no internal wall at (2,3), so can move there.\n\nBut moving R is right, which is perpendicular to current down, so allowed, no reverse issue.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3).\n\nNow, if I move to (2,3), there is food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (2,3). Life span 9 at turn 35, so at turn 38, how many turns passed?\n\nTurn 35: life span 9\n\nAfter turn 35: decreases to 8\n\nAfter turn 36: 7\n\nAfter turn 37: 6\n\nAfter turn 38: 5? Let's be careful.\n\nThe life span decreases every turn, including the current turn when it is present.\n\nAt turn 35, food has life span 3 for (4,5), 6 for (2,1), 9 for (2,3).\n\nAfter each turn, the life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo after turn 35 (i.e., at start of turn 36), life span of (4,5) is 2 (since decreased on turn 35)\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 5, (2,3) life span 8\n\nAfter turn 36, at start of turn 37: (4,5) life span 1, (2,1) life span 4, (2,3) life span 7? Let's make a table.\n\nDefine: at the beginning of turn t, before action, the state is given with life spans.\n\nAfter the turn, when we move, if head eats food, it consumes it, and life span decreases for all food after the turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N decreases.\n\nFor example, food with life span N at turn t, will disappear after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, when the food is present, during that turn, the countdown decreases by 1.\n\nAfter decrease, if life span becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n\nTypically, it decreases at the end of the turn.\n\nBut for eating, during the turn, when head moves to food, it is eaten before disappearance if life span 1.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify, but I think: at the start of turn, life span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1.\n\nIf during the turn, head moves to food, it is eaten, and food is consumed, so it disappears regardless.\n\nIf not eaten, and after decrease, if life span 0, it disappears.\n\nIn this case, for (4,5) at turn 35, life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 35, it decreases to 2, still there.\n\nAfter turn 36, decreases to 1, still there.\n\nAfter turn 37, decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow back to turn 38.\n\nHead at (1,3), can move D to (1,2) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I move R to (2,3), there is food, so I eat it, snake grows: new head at (2,3), and tail not removed, so new segment added. Length increases by 1.\n\nThen positions: new head (2,3), body: old head (1,3) becomes body, then the rest, and tail remains, so the segment that was tail stays.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at head, so length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: head moves to (2,3), which has food, so consumed, then the body: the previous positions remain, and the head is new, so the tail stays where it is.\n\nOld positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nAfter moving right to (2,3) and eating:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nThen the body: old head (1,3) is now first body segment\n\nThen old body0 (1,4) second body\n\nold body1 (1,5) third\n\nold body2 (1,6) fourth\n\nold body3 (2,6) fifth\n\nold body4 (3,6) sixth\n\nold body5 (3,5) seventh\n\nold body6 (2,5) eighth\n\nold body7 (2,4) ninth\n\nold body8 (3,4) tenth, and since we ate, a new segment is added, but where? The new tail is added at the end, so the tail was (3,4), and it stays, and a new segment is added after it? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, the head moves to food, food consumed, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added at the tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and instead of removing the tail, the tail stays, so the snake grows by one segment. So the new tail is the old tail, and the positions extend.\n\nIn the list, the head is new position, and the body includes all old positions, with tail unchanged.\n\nSo for example, old positions: 10 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating: head new, body old positions except tail removed, so 9 segments if no eat.\n\nWith eating: head new, body all old positions, so 11 segments.\n\nHere: after move to (2,3) and eat:\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then body segments: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — 11 positions, tail still (3,4)? (3,4) is the last.\n\n(3,4) was tail, now it's the second last? List: index 0: head (2,3), 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (3,5), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,4), 10: (3,4) so tail is (3,4)\n\nAnd the food at (2,3) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, life span of other food.\n\nBut for now, at turn 38, if I move to (2,3), I eat the food, get +1, grow.\n\nIf I move down to (1,2), no food, so tail removed, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), etc., tail (3,4) removed, new tail (2,4) or something.\n\nBut let's think about the situation.\n\nI need to think ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nThere is also food at (2,1) and (4,5), but (4,5) has short life.\n\n(4,5) life span: at turn 35, 3.\n\nAfter turn 35: 2\n\nAfter turn 36: 1\n\nAfter turn 37: 0, disappears, so at turn 38, (4,5) food is gone, since after turn 37 it decreased to 0 and disappeared.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at turn 35 life span 6, after turn 35:5, turn 36:4, turn 37:3, turn 38:2, so still there at turn 38.\n\n(2,3) life span 9 at t35, after t35:8, t36:7, t37:6, t38:5, so still there.\n\nAt turn 38, (4,5) food is gone.\n\nBack to choices at turn 38.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go to (2,3) and eat food, or to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is free, no issue.\n\nBut eating (2,3) is good, but I need to see if it's safe.\n\nAlso, there is a tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, at (1,3), the tail is at (3,4). Distance: from (1,3) to (3,4) is |1-3| + |3-4| = 2+1=3, not adjacent. Adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (1,3) adjacent cells: (1,4), (1,2), (0,3) wall, (2,3).\n\n(1,4) is body, (2,3) is the food cell, not tail. Tail is (3,4), which is not adjacent to (1,3); it's diagonal or further.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nMoving to (2,3) should be safe.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut since all food is positive, growing is good for score.\n\nBut we need to survive.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,3), head at (2,3), direction R (since we moved right).\n\nThen for next turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut let's first list the actions so far.\n\nFor turn 35: we must move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 36: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)\n\nNow turn 38: I can move R to (2,3) or D to (1,2)\n\nIf I move D to (1,2), then I can later go to (2,1) or other places.\n\nBut (2,3) food has life span decreasing; at turn 38, before move, what is life span?\n\nAt start of turn 38, after turn 37, life span of (2,3) is: at t35:9, after t35:8 (t36 start), after t36:7 (t37 start), after t37:6 (t38 start). So at turn 38, life span 6? Let's clarify.\n\nDefine the life span at the beginning of each turn.\n\nAt turn 35: given life span 9 for (2,3)\n\nAfter turn 35 is completed, life span decreases by 1, so at start of turn 36, life span 8.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 36, at start of turn 37, life span 7.\n\nAfter turn 37, at start of turn 38, life span 6 for (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): at t35:6, t36 start:5, t37 start:4, t38 start:3\n\n(4,5) at t35:3, t36 start:2, t37 start:1, after t37, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so at t38 start, it is gone.\n\nSo at turn 38, only food (2,1) and (2,3) present, with life span 3 and 6 respectively? (2,1) life span 3 at t38 start, (2,3) life span 6 at t38 start.\n\n(2,1) life span at t38 start: after t37, it was 4 at t37 start, decreased to 3 at t37 end, so t38 start:3.\n\nSimilarly (2,3): t37 start:7, decreased to 6 at t37 end, t38 start:6.\n\nNow, from (1,3) at turn 38, if I move to (2,3), I eat it, good.\n\nIf I move down to (1,2), then at turn 39, head at (1,2), and I can go to (2,2) or other.\n\nBut (2,3) might be eaten later, but life span is 6, so many turns, but I should eat it when I can.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nThe snake is currently in a vertical line at x=1 from y=3 to y=6, then it goes to (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), etc., so there is a loop or something.\n\nPositions after turn 37: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo the body is from (1,4) to (1,6), then to (2,6), (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5), down to (2,4), right to (3,4).\n\nSo (2,4) and (3,4) are occupied.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3, which is free.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1, also free.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant here.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, if at turn 38 I move to (2,3), eat food, then head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nThen for turn 39, from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\n- U: (2,4) — but (2,4) is occupied by body, in positions, after eating, positions include (2,4)? After move to (2,3) and eat, positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (2,4) is body segment, index 9 or something, not tail. Tail is (3,4).\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied, so moving U to (2,4) collision.\n\n- D: (2,2) — free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: (1,3) — (1,3) is body segment, body0, so collision.\n\n- R: (3,3) — free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nNow, food at (2,1) is below, life span 3 at t38 start, so if I go down, I can eat it soon.\n\nIf I go right to (3,3), I might go towards other areas.\n\nBut (2,1) has short life, only 3 turns left, so I should prioritize eating it if possible.\n\nLife span at t38 start is 3, meaning after this turn, it decreases to 2, then to 1, then 0.\n\nAt turn 38, if I don't eat (2,1), it will disappear after a few turns.\n\nSpecifically, after turn 38, life span 2, so at t39 start:2, after t39:1, after t40:0 disappear.\n\nSo if I want to eat (2,1), I need to be able to reach it by turn 40.\n\nFrom current position at turn 38, head at (1,3), if I move to (2,3) at turn 38, then at turn 39, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), then at turn 40 to (2,1), eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't move to (2,3) at turn 38, but go down to (1,2), then at turn 39 from (1,2) I can move R to (2,2), then turn 40 to (2,1), also eat.\n\nBut if I go to (2,3) first, I eat one food, then go to (2,1) for another.\n\nIf I go directly down, I might miss (2,3) or not.\n\nBut (2,3) has longer life, life span 6 at t38 start, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat both if possible.\n\nFirst, let's assume at turn 38 I move to (2,3) and eat.\n\nSo turn 38: move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 39: from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nTo reach (2,1), I should move D to (2,2).\n\nThen at turn 39, move D to (2,2), no food there, so snake doesn't grow, tail removed? After turn 38, positions with 11 segments.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2) without eating: new head (2,2), body: old head (2,3) becomes body, then the rest, and tail removed.\n\nOld positions after turn 38: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,2): new head (2,2)\n\nBody: old head (2,3) now body0\n\nThen (1,3) body1\n\n(1,4) body2\n\n(1,5) body3\n\n(1,6) body4\n\n(2,6) body5\n\n(3,6) body6\n\n(3,5) body7\n\n(2,5) body8\n\n(2,4) body9\n\nAnd tail (3,4) removed, so positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] tail (2,4)\n\nHead at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 40: move D to (2,1), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew head (2,1), body: old positions with (2,1) added, no tail removed, so grow to 11 segments again? After previous, we had 11 segments, moved to (2,2) no eat, so 10 segments? After turn 38: 11 positions.\n\nAfter turn 39 move to (2,2) no food: head to (2,2), body includes old head (2,3) and all except tail removed, so 10 positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] and (2,4) was tail, removed. Positions: head (2,2), body0 (2,3), body1 (1,3), body2 (1,4), body3 (1,5), body4 (1,6), body5 (2,6), body6 (3,6), body7 (3,5), body8 (2,5) — 9 body segments? 10 positions including head.\n\nList: index 0: head (2,2), 1: (2,3), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,4), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,6), 6: (2,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (3,5), 9: (2,5) so 10 positions, tail (2,5)\n\nThen turn 40 move to (2,1) and eat: new head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) and new segment, so tail (2,5) stays, new positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] 11 positions, tail (2,5)\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nBut is this safe? After eating (2,1), head at (2,1), which is near bottom.\n\ny=1, walls at y=0.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1): direction D (since moved down).\n\nCannot move U (reverse).\n\n- U: (2,2) — occupied by body segment, body0? Positions: head (2,1), body0 (2,2), body1 (2,3), etc., so (2,2) is body0, collision.\n\n- D: (2,0) — y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (1,1) — free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- R: (3,1) — free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), but (3,1) ok.\n\nSo can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nSay move L to (1,1), then to (1,0) wall, or other, but I need to think long term.\n\nBut I have eaten two foods, score increased.\n\nBut what if at turn 38 I didn't move to (2,3), but went down to (1,2).\n\nTurn 38: from (1,3) move D to (1,2)\n\nNo food, so positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) but after move, tail removed.\n\nOld positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (1,2): new head (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and tail (3,4) removed, so positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] tail (2,4)\n\nHead at (1,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 39: from (1,2), possible moves.\n\nDirection D, cannot move U.\n\n- U: (1,3) — occupied by body0, collision\n\n- D: (1,1) — free? Not occupied\n\n- L: (0,2) wall\n\n- R: (2,2) — free? Not occupied\n\nSo can move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2)\n\nNow, food at (2,1) and (2,3).\n\n(2,1) life span at t38 start:3, so at t39 start:2 (after t38 decrease)\n\nAt t39, if I move R to (2,2), no food, then turn 40 to (2,1) eat.\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), then turn 40 to (1,0) wall or R to (2,1), but from (1,1), I can move R to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut (2,3) is still there, I can eat it after.\n\nBut at turn 39, from (1,2), if I move R to (2,2), then turn 40 to (2,1) eat, then I have not eaten (2,3) yet.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (3,1) or (2,2) but (2,2) might be body, etc.\n\nBut (2,3) can be eaten later.\n\nIn the first scenario, by going to (2,3) first, I eat both soon.\n\nMoreover, in the second choice, if I go down to (1,2) at turn 38, I might not eat (2,3) immediately, but it has longer life, so I can, but I might miss the opportunity or something.\n\nBut since the snake is blocking some paths, it might be better to eat now.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,5) but it's gone by turn 38.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat at (2,3), the tail is at (3,4), which is adjacent? (2,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; (2,3) adjacent are (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3). (3,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\nNow, back to turn 38, moving to (2,3) seems good to eat the food.\n\nBut let's think about the path after.\n\nAfter eating both, the snake is longer, and I need to find a way out.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) after eating, as before, I can move to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nSay move to (1,1), then from (1,1), direction L? After moving left from (2,1), direction L.\n\nThen cannot move R.\n\n- U: (1,2) — but (1,2) might be body; in positions after turn 40, head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), etc., so (1,2) not occupied? Positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] so (1,2) free.\n\n- D: (1,0) wall\n\n- L: (0,1) wall\n\n- R: (2,1) but head is there, invalid\n\nFrom (1,1), moves:\n\n- U: (1,2) — free\n\n- D: (1,0) wall\n\n- L: (0,1) wall\n\n- R: (2,1) — occupied by previous head? After move to (1,1), positions: new head (1,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), etc., so (2,1) is body0, so collision if move R.\n\nSo only move U to (1,2)\n\nThen (1,2) might be free, as above.\n\nThen from (1,2), can go up or right, etc.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating for now to keep the snake smaller, but since all food is positive, eating is good for score, as long as I don't die.\n\nIn this case, eating both seems possible.\n\nBut there might be a risk with the body positions.\n\nAnother food: (2,3) is at (2,3), which I can eat.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFor turn 35: must move D\n\nTurn 36: must move D\n\nTurn 37: must move D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 38: I can choose to move R to (2,3) or D to (1,2)\n\nIf I move D to (1,2), then at turn 39, from (1,2), I can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1)\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), then turn 40 to (2,1) eat.\n\nBut (2,3) is still there; from (2,1), I can go to (3,1) or up to (2,2) but occupied, or to (1,1), etc., but (2,3) is above.\n\nFrom (2,1), after eating, head at (2,1), I can move to (3,1) or to (1,1), as before.\n\nThen to reach (2,3), I need to go up, but the body is blocking.\n\nFor example, after moving to (2,1) and eating, positions include (2,2), (2,3), etc., so (2,3) is occupied, I cannot eat it later; it's under the body.\n\nFood under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nBut it might be difficult to free it.\n\nIn this path, if I don't eat (2,3) at turn 38, it might become inaccessible.\n\nWhereas if I eat it at turn 38, I get the point.\n\nSimilarly, in the first path, I eat both.\n\nSo better to eat (2,3) at turn 38.\n\nThen proceed to eat (2,1).\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 35.\n\nTurn 35: action D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R (to (2,3))\n\nThen turn 39: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 40: D (to (2,1) eat)\n\nBut after that, I need to continue.\n\nAt turn 40, after eating (2,1), head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen as before, can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1)\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nThe grid has internal obstacle at (5,2), but not immediate.\n\nAlso, the snake body is to the right and above.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then only up to (1,2), then from (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2), but (1,3) and (2,2) are body segments.\n\nPositions after turn 40: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (1,1) is free, (3,1) free.\n\nFrom (1,1), move U to (1,2), which is free? (1,2) not in positions, so free.\n\nThen from (1,2), moves: U to (1,3) but (1,3) is body segment, body2 or something, occupied.\n\nR to (2,2) but (2,2) is body0, occupied.\n\nD to (1,1) but just came from, or L wall.\n\nSo stuck? From (1,2), after moving from (1,1) to (1,2), direction U.\n\nThen from (1,2), cannot move U to (1,3) occupied, cannot move D to (1,1) reverse? Direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot move D.\n\nCannot move L to (0,2) wall.\n\nCannot move R to (2,2) occupied.\n\nDead end.\n\nIf from (2,1) I move R to (3,1), then from (3,1), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) reverse invalid, R to (4,1).\n\n(3,2) : is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (3,2) free.\n\n(4,1) free.\n\nBut let's see positions.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), no food, so tail removed.\n\nOld positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) tail (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,1): new head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) and tail (2,5) removed? New body: old head (2,1) body0, (2,2) body1, (2,3) body2, (1,3) body3, (1,4) body4, (1,5) body5, (1,6) body6, (2,6) body7, (3,6) body8, (3,5) body9, tail was (2,5) removed, so positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nThen turn 41: from (3,1), possible moves.\n\nDirection R, cannot move L.\n\n- U: (3,2) — free? Not occupied\n\n- D: (3,0) wall\n\n- L: (2,1) — occupied by body0, collision\n\n- R: (4,1) — free\n\nSo move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1)\n\n(3,2) is near the obstacle, but (5,2) is obstacle, (3,2) ok.\n\nI can go to (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in this case, I survived.\n\nEarlier, if I moved left to (1,1), I got stuck at (1,2).\n\nSo better to move right to (3,1) at turn 40.\n\nThen I can go up or right.\n\nBut I need to output actions.\n\nNow for the plan.\n\nFrom turn 35 to 37, must go down.\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen turn 39: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 40: after eating, at (2,1), move R to (3,1)\n\nThen for turn 41, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1)\n\nTo avoid dead ends, say move R to (4,1)\n\nThen from (4,1), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to provide actions for several turns, but not necessarily until end, just a sequence.\n\nThe format is to output for turns starting from t1=35.\n\nSo let's list:\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R  (to (2,3), eat)\n\nTurn 39: D  (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 40: D  (to (2,1), eat)\n\nThen turn 41: from (2,1), after move, direction D, but we move R to (3,1), so direction R.\n\nIn turn 40 action is to move to (2,1), then for turn 41, we need to choose.\n\nBut in the sequence, I can include turn 41.\n\nSince after turn 40, we are at (2,1), and we move R to (3,1) for turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 42, etc.\n\nBut to be safe, after turn 40, move R to (3,1).\n\nThen turn 41: from (3,1), move R to (4,1), for example.\n\nThen from (4,1), can go to (4,2) or (5,1), but (5,2) obstacle, so (5,1) free? Walls only border and (5,2), so (5,1) free.\n\nBut not important.\n\nNow, another thing: in turn 38, if I don't eat (2,3), I might have a problem with (2,3) being blocked, but since I ate it, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating to keep space, but I think eating is better for score.\n\nNow, for the tail reward danger, not an issue here.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nThen for turn 41: R (to (3,1))\n\nI need to output at least from 35 onwards.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, from 35 to 40 is 6 actions, including turn 35.\n\nTurn 35,36,37,38,39,40: that's 6 turns.\n\nThen I can add turn 41.\n\nBut let's see if I can do better.\n\nAt turn 38, instead of moving R, if I move D to (1,2), then turn 39 to (2,2), turn 40 to (2,1) eat, but then (2,3) is still there, and from (2,1), I can move to (3,1), then to (3,2), but (2,3) is occupied by body, so I cannot eat it easily.\n\nFor example, positions after turn 40 if I go that way: after moving to (2,1) eat, head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2)? Let's not confuse.\n\nIf from turn 37 (1,3) move D to (1,2) at turn 38.\n\nThen positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail was (3,4) removed? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 38 move to (1,2): positions [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 39: move R to (2,2), no food, positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) tail (2,4) removed? New: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1) eat, so grow: head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) 11 positions, tail (2,5)\n\nNow (2,3) is free? But not, (2,3) is not occupied, but in positions, no (2,3), so it is free, but to eat it, I need to move head there, but from (2,1), I can move to (2,2) but occupied, or to (1,1), (3,1), etc., not directly to (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,1), move to (3,1), then to (3,2), but (3,2) free, then to (3,3) or (2,3), but (2,3) is adjacent to (3,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) is body.\n\nFor example, at turn 41, from (2,1), move R to (3,1), then positions change, but (2,3) might be reachable via (3,2) to (3,3) to (2,3) or something, but it takes more turns, and life span is decreasing.\n\nAt turn 40 start, (2,3) life span: at t38 start:6, after t38:5, t39:4, t40 start:4? At t38 start:6, after t38 decrease:5 at t39 start, after t39:4 at t40 start, after t40:3 at t41 start.\n\nSo still time, but it might be risky.\n\nIn the first approach, I ate it earlier, so better.\n\nTherefore, I think the sequence with eating at turn 38 is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nFor turn 41: since at (2,1) after turn 40, move R to (3,1)\n\nSo include that.\n\nBut the output should be for consecutive turns.\n\nNow for the box.\n\nAlso, in the initial, at turn 35, I must move D, as only choice.\n\nSimilarly 36 and 37 only D.\n\nThen 38 I choose R.\n\nTo write the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 35):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (1,6), direction left (L). Positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] (length 10).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 3 (will disappear after turn 37).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 6 (will disappear after turn 40).\n  - (2,3): Value +1, life span 9 (will disappear after turn 43).\n\n**Immediate Constraints (Turn 35):**\n- Head at (1,6), direction L. Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (1,7): y=7 is wall, invalid.\n  - D (down) to (1,5): Empty and safe.\n  - L (left) to (0,6): x=0 wall, invalid.\n  - R (right) to (2,6): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision risk. Invalid.\n- Only valid move is D (down) to (1,5). No food at (1,5), so snake does not grow.\n\n**Turn 36:**\n- Head at (1,5), direction D (down). Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (1,6): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (1,4): Empty and safe.\n  - L (left) to (0,5): Wall, invalid.\n  - R (right) to (2,5): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n- Only valid move is D to (1,4). No food, no growth.\n\n**Turn 37:**\n- Head at (1,4), direction D. Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (1,5): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (1,3): Empty and safe.\n  - L (left) to (0,4): Wall, invalid.\n  - R (right) to (2,4): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n- Only valid move is D to (1,3). No food, no growth.\n\n**Turn 38:**\n- Head at (1,3), direction D. Food at (2,3) is accessible. Life span of (2,3) is 6 at start of turn 38 (decreases to 5 after turn). Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (1,4): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (1,2): Empty and safe, but misses opportunity to eat (2,3).\n  - L (left) to (0,3): Wall, invalid.\n  - R (right) to (2,3): Empty, contains food, and safe (no tail reward danger; tail at (3,4) is not adjacent).\n- **Decision**: Move R to (2,3) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 11. New direction R.\n\n**Turn 39:**\n- Head at (2,3), direction R. Food at (2,1) has life span 3 at start of turn 39 (decreases to 2 after turn). Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (2,4): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (2,2): Empty and safe.\n  - L (left) to (1,3): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n  - R (right) to (3,3): Empty and safe, but delays eating (2,1).\n- **Decision**: Move D to (2,2) to approach (2,1). No food, so snake does not grow. New direction D.\n\n**Turn 40:**\n- Head at (2,2), direction D. Food at (2,1) has life span 2 at start of turn 40 (decreases to 1 after turn; must eat this turn or next). Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (2,3): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (2,1): Contains food, safe to eat (no tail reward danger; tail at (3,5) is not adjacent).\n  - L (left) to (1,2): Empty, but misses immediate food.\n  - R (right) to (3,2): Empty, but delays food.\n- **Decision**: Move D to (2,1) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 12. New direction D.\n\n**Turn 41:**\n- Head at (2,1), direction D. Possible moves:\n  - U (up) to (2,2): Occupied by body segment, collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (2,0): Wall (y=0), invalid.\n  - L (left) to (1,1): Empty and safe.\n  - R (right) to (3,1): Empty and safe.\n- **Decision**: Move R to (3,1) to avoid potential dead end near left wall. New direction R. No food.\n\n**Long-Term Considerations:**\n- After turn 41, snake can navigate towards open areas (e.g., (3,2) or (4,1)) to avoid walls and body. Life span of remaining food (2,3) is long (disappears after turn 43), but it may be difficult to access due to body positions. Prioritize survival by moving to less constrained regions.\n- All positive food eaten by turn 40, maximizing score (+2) with minimal risk. Snake length is now 12, but grid has space to maneuver if careful pathing is used.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 35 to 41):**\n- Turn 35: Only safe move is down (D) to avoid wall and body.\n- Turn 36: Only safe move is down (D) to continue path.\n- Turn 37: Only safe move is down (D) to reach position for food access.\n- Turn 38: Move right (R) to eat (2,3) for +1 score and growth. Long-term benefit: secures food before it becomes inaccessible.\n- Turn 39: Move down (D) to approach (2,1).\n- Turn 40: Move down (D) to eat (2,1) for +1 score and growth.\n- Turn 41: Move right (R) to (3,1) for safer navigation.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 35: D (down)  \nTurn 36: D (down)  \nTurn 37: D (down)  \nTurn 38: R (right)  \nTurn 39: D (down)  \nTurn 40: D (down)  \nTurn 41: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game on this 2D grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, I should avoid those cells.\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (1,5), then body segments at (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and tail at (4,5). The head direction is down (D), meaning it's moving downward.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- At (4,5): value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 36, it has 2 turns left? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (4,5), life span 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 36 + 2 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 36, life span is 2, which means it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37, but not after that. Since countdown decreases every turn, after turn 36, life span becomes 1; after turn 37, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,1): value 1, life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 36 to 40 (since after turn 40, life span would be 0).\n\nFood at (2,3): value 1, life span 8, so available from turn 36 to 43.\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nCurrent turn is 36.\n\nSnake head is at (1,5), moving down. So from (1,5), moving down would go to (1,4), since down decreases y? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The state says: for walls, y=0/y=7, and snake positions like (1,5), (1,6), etc. Since head is at (1,5) and moving down to... head direction is D, but let's see positions.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), etc. (1,5) to (1,6) — if y increases upward, then (1,6) is above (1,5), so moving up? But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n\nHead direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and positions: [(1,5), (1,6), ...]\n\nIf head is at (1,5) and next segment is (1,6), that means the snake was moving up to get from (1,5) to (1,6)? Positions are listed head first, so head is first, then the body segments in order.\n\nSo the head is at (1,5), and the segment behind it is at (1,6). That means to reach (1,5) from previous position, it must have moved to (1,5) from (1,6) or something. Let's list positions:\n\nIndex: 0: head (1,5)\n\n1: (1,6)\n\n2: (2,6)\n\n3: (3,6)\n\n4: (3,5)\n\n5: (2,5)\n\n6: (2,4)\n\n7: (3,4)\n\n8: (4,4)\n\n9: tail (4,5)\n\nNow, from head to first body: from (1,5) to (1,6). Since (1,6) is directly above (1,5) if y increases upward, that means the head is below the first body segment, so the snake must be moving downward to have the head at (1,5) and body at (1,6), but if it's moving down, head should be going to lower y.\n\nI think I have a coordinate confusion.\n\nTypically in such games, (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left? But here, walls are given: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so it's a grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. But which direction is up?\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nSo, U: y increases, which might be upward if y=0 is bottom, or downward if y=0 is top. But let's see from positions.\n\nHead at (1,5), body at (1,6). If U is (x,y+1), then (1,5) to (1,6) would be moving U (up), but head direction is given as D (down). That doesn't match.\n\nHead direction is the direction it is currently moving. At turn 36, head is at (1,5), and it is moving D, down. But the body segment is at (1,6). If moving down, y decreases, so from previous position, it must have come from above.\n\nLet's think about the previous move.\n\nAt turn 35, the head was somewhere, moved to (1,5) with direction D.\n\nSince it moved down to (1,5), the previous head position must be (1,6), because moving down to (1,5) from (1,6).\n\nThen, after moving, the new head is at (1,5), and the old head becomes body at (1,6).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So at turn 36, head is at (1,5), moving down, and the first body segment is at (1,6), which is the previous head position.\n\nSo, coordinate system: y=0 is top? Let's see: moving down decreases y, so from (1,6) to (1,5), y decreased, so y=6 is above y=5, so y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are both walls. So y=0 is one border, y=7 is opposite border.\n\nSince moving down decreases y, from (1,6) to (1,5), so y=5 is below y=6 if y increases downward? I'm getting confused.\n\nStandard: in many grid systems, (0,0) is top-left, with x increasing right, y increasing down.\n\nBut here, U is (x,y+1), which would increase y, so if y increases down, U is down? But U is up, usually.\n\nLet's read: \"U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1)\"\n\nAnd walls y=0/y=7.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,5), body (1,6)\n\nIf head is at (1,5) and moving D to, say, (1,4), which would be decreasing y.\n\nBut body at (1,6), which has higher y, so if y increases downward, then (1,6) is below (1,5), but that can't be because the snake is moving down to (1,5) from above.\n\nAssume that y=0 is the top row, y=7 is the bottom row.\n\nThen U (up) decreases y, D (down) increases y? But the movement says U(x,y+1), which increases y, so if y=0 is top, y+1 would be down.\n\nContradiction.\n\nPerhaps the coordinate system has y=0 at bottom.\n\nLet's think.\n\nIf U is (x,y+1), and U is up, then y+1 should be upward, so y=0 must be bottom, y increases up.\n\nThen D (x,y-1) decreases y, down.\n\nThen, head at (1,5), body at (1,6): since body is at (1,6), which is higher y, so if y increases up, (1,6) is above (1,5).\n\nAnd head moving D, down, to (1,4), decreasing y.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7. If y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so both are borders.\n\nIf y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, then U (x,y+1) from y=0 to y=1, up; D (x,y-1) from y=1 to y=0, down to bottom, but y=0 is wall, so can't move there.\n\nSimilarly, from high y, D decreases y toward bottom.\n\nIn this case, with head at (1,5), body at (1,6), if y=0 bottom, y=7 top, then (1,6) is above (1,5), so snake moving down from (1,6) to (1,5) at turn 36.\n\nHead direction D means it is moving down, so next move could be D to (1,4), or L/R, but not U because of no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so cannot move U on next turn.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (4,5) value 1, life span 2: at turn 36, can be eaten on turn 36 or 37.\n\n- (2,1) value 1, life span 5: available turns 36 to 40\n\n- (2,3) value 1, life span 8: available turns 36 to 43\n\nAll on grid.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collision.\n\nSnake: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo tail is at (4,5).\n\nFood at (4,5) is under the tail? (4,5) is the tail position, and food is at (4,5), so food is under the tail.\n\nBut to eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it.\n\nSpecial case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (4,5), and food is at (4,5), so if head moves to (4,5), it would eat the food, but since it's the tail, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on (4,5), which was tail, so they collide? Let's see.\n\nNormally, when snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, length increases by one, and the tail stays in place.\n\nBut if the food is under the tail, and head moves to it, then head is on (4,5), which was tail, but after eating, the tail is still there until next move? I need to think carefully.\n\nWhen snake moves:\n\n- Head moves to new position.\n\n- If new position has food, eat it: snake grows, so tail does not move. The new segment is added where the tail was, so tail stays.\n\n- If no food, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to a cell that had food and was occupied by tail, when head moves there, it eats the food, so tail does not move, meaning the cell now has both head and tail? But that can't be; cells can have only one thing.\n\nProblem: when head moves to a cell with food, and that cell is currently occupied by the tail, then after moving head there, the tail is still there, so collision.\n\nThat's the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes immediate collision because head and tail are on same cell after growth.\n\nIn this case, for food at (4,5), which is the tail position. Head is at (1,5), not adjacent to tail. Tail is at (4,5), head at (1,5), not adjacent; adjacent means next cell.\n\nHead and tail are not adjacent; they are far apart.\n\nSo for now, no immediate danger.\n\nBut to eat food at (4,5), since it's under tail, we need the tail to move away first, then head move to it.\n\nBut tail will move only if no food is eaten in that move.\n\nCurrently, at turn 36, head at (1,5), moving down.\n\nPossible moves: since current direction is D, cannot move U (up), because no instant reverse.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nLet's see possible actions:\n\n- D: down to (1,4) — y decreases, so (1,4)\n\n- L: left to (0,5) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- R: right to (2,5) — but (2,5) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (2,5) is index 5, which is a body segment. So moving to (2,5) would collide with body.\n\nList all snake positions: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied, yes.\n\n(1,4) is not in the list, but is it valid? (1,4): x=1, y=4. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. Internal obstacle (5,2), not here. So (1,4) should be empty.\n\n(0,5) is x=0, wall, invalid.\n\n(2,5) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,4)? But is there other? L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5) body, U not allowed because reverse, and also U would be to (1,6), which is body, so invalid anyway.\n\nU to (1,6) is body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,4).\n\nIs that right? Head at (1,5), moving D to (1,4).\n\ny=4, which is below y=5 if y=0 bottom? Earlier I assumed y=0 bottom, y increases up.\n\nBut let's confirm with walls.\n\nWalls at y=0 and y=7. If y=0 bottom, y=7 top, then moving D (down) to lower y, but y=0 is bottom, so D to y-1 would be downward to bottom, but from (1,5) D to (1,4), y=4 <5, so if y=0 bottom, lower y is down.\n\nSimilarly, U to (1,6) y=6>5, up.\n\nBut (1,6) is body, so cannot.\n\nIn this case, only D to (1,4) is possible? But (1,4) is not occupied, and not wall, so yes.\n\nBut is there food at (1,4)? No, food at (4,5), (2,1), (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at y=3, x=2.\n\nBut for now, at turn 36, only possible move is D to (1,4).\n\nThen, after moving, snake head at (1,4), and the tail will move? Since no food eaten, tail moves from (4,5) to the next, but when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, so the last segment is gone.\n\nAfter move to (1,4), new positions: head at (1,4), then body: the previous head (1,5) becomes first body, then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and tail was (4,5), but since no eat, tail moves, so (4,5) is removed, and the new tail is (4,4)? Let's list.\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0 to 9: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nAfter move D to (1,4): new head at (1,4)\n\nThen body: the old head (1,5) becomes segment 1, then (1,6) segment 2, (2,6) seg3, (3,6) seg4, (3,5) seg5, (2,5) seg6, (2,4) seg7, (3,4) seg8, (4,4) seg9, and tail (4,5) is removed, so the snake has segments from (1,4) to (4,4), but (4,4) was index 8, now it becomes the tail? Positions: new head (1,4), then the previous segments shift: segment 1: old pos0 (1,5), segment 2: old pos1 (1,6), segment 3: old pos2 (2,6), segment 4: old pos3 (3,6), segment 5: old pos4 (3,5), segment 6: old pos5 (2,5), segment 7: old pos6 (2,4), segment 8: old pos7 (3,4), segment 9: old pos8 (4,4), and old pos9 (4,5) is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nLength 10, same as before.\n\nFood at (4,5) is still there, but tail moved to (4,4), so (4,5) is now empty? Food was at (4,5), and tail was there, but after tail moved, the cell (4,5) has food but no snake, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nLife span: at turn 36, food (4,5) has life span 2, so after turn 36, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1 for turn 37.\n\nAt turn 36, we moved to (1,4), no food there.\n\nTurn 37: head at (1,4), direction was D, but after moving to (1,4), the new head direction is D, since we moved down.\n\nPossible moves from (1,4): D to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4), U to (1,5).\n\nU to (1,5): (1,5) is now a body segment, so collision if we move there.\n\nR to (2,4): (2,4) is also a body segment, in the new positions, (2,4) is there.\n\nNew positions: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied, (1,5) occupied, (1,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nD to (1,3) should be possible.\n\nL to (0,4) wall.\n\nSo only D to (1,3) or U to (1,5) but U is reverse and occupied, invalid.\n\nR to (2,4) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,3) again.\n\nBut this is going down, and we have food to consider.\n\nAt this rate, we'll keep going down to (1,2), (1,1), etc., but y=0 is wall, so at (1,1), D to (1,0) wall, then stuck or must turn.\n\nBut we need to plan multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps at turn 36, we must move D, but then at turn 37, from (1,4), only D to (1,3), and so on.\n\nBut let's list the grid to see.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 y=0,7.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nSnake head at (1,5), y=5.\n\nMoving D to (1,4), y=4.\n\nThen from (1,4), D to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut at (1,4), we can only move D to (1,3), since other directions blocked.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,3), D to (1,2), then (1,2) D to (1,1), then from (1,1), D to (1,0) wall, invalid, so must turn.\n\nAt (1,1), possible moves: D to (1,0) wall invalid, U to (1,2) which is body if we came from there, but let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn 36: move D to (1,4)\n\nAfter move, positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nFood: (4,5) life span now 1 (after turn 36), (2,1) life span 4, (2,3) life span 7\n\nTurn 37: head at (1,4), direction D. Possible moves: D to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) occupied (body), U to (1,5) occupied (body) and reverse. So only D to (1,3)\n\nMove to (1,3)\n\nNew head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (4,4) is removed? When moving, no eat, so tail moves off.\n\nPrevious tail was (4,4), removed, new tail is (3,4) which was second last.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\n(2,4) is still there, but (4,4) gone.\n\nFood at (4,5) still, life span 1.\n\nTurn 38: head at (1,3), direction D. Moves: D to (1,2), U to (1,4) body, L wall, R to (2,3). (2,3) has food? Food at (2,3) is present.\n\n(2,3) is not in current snake positions? Current positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (2,3) is empty, and not wall.\n\nAlso, food at (2,3) with value 1.\n\nSo from (1,3), we can move R to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nU to (1,4) body, invalid.\n\nL to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,2) empty.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nR to (2,3) is possible and has food.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 38, from (1,3), we can choose to go R to (2,3) or D to (1,2).\n\nIf we go R to (2,3), we eat the food there, so snake grows.\n\nFood at (2,3) has life span 8, at turn 38, it has life span 8 - (38-36)? Turn 36: life span 8, turn 37: 7, turn 38: 6, etc., but since we are at turn 38, it can be eaten.\n\nIf we move to (2,3), eat food, so head moves to (2,3), which has food, so eat it, length increases.\n\nNew head (2,3), then the body: old head (1,3) becomes segment, but since ate, tail does not move, so all body segments stay, and new tail is added? When eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nAfter moving to (2,3) and eating: new head (2,3), then body: the old head position (1,3) becomes first body segment, then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), and since ate, tail does not move, so the tail is still (3,4), but we add a new segment where the tail was, so the snake has 11 segments: positions from (2,3) to (3,4), with (3,4) being the tail.\n\nThe segments are: new head (2,3), then the previous segments: index 0 becomes body, so (1,3) is now body, then previous body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and previous tail (3,4) remains as tail.\n\nSince ate, no tail movement, so positions: head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is tail, and (2,4) is body.\n\nNow, food at (2,3) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (4,5) life span, at turn 38, it had life span 2 at turn 36, so turn 37:1, turn 38:0? After turn 38, it disappears, so at turn 38, it can still be eaten if we move there.\n\nLife span countdown: at turn 36, life span 2, so after turn 36, it becomes 1; after turn 37, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37, not on turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, for turn t, food with life span N at turn t can be eaten on turn t, and if not, at turn t+1, life span N-1, etc., until 0.\n\nSo for (4,5): at turn 36, life span 2, can be eaten turn 36 or 37.\n\nAt turn 37, if not eaten, life span 1, can be eaten turn 37.\n\nAfter turn 37, if not eaten, life span 0, gone.\n\nAt turn 38, it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at turn 36 life span 5, can be eaten turns 36-40.\n\n(2,3) life span 8, turns 36-43.\n\nBack to turn 38.\n\nIf at turn 38 we move to (2,3), we eat it.\n\nIf we move D to (1,2), no eat.\n\nBut at turn 38, from (1,3), if we move R to (2,3), we eat food, good.\n\nBut let's see the situation at turn 36.\n\nAt turn 36, we must move D to (1,4) because no other choice.\n\nThen turn 37, must move D to (1,3).\n\nThen at turn 38, from (1,3), we can choose to move R to (2,3) to eat food, or D to (1,2).\n\nMoving to (2,3) seems good, we get food.\n\nBut after that, we need to see where to go.\n\nFirst, let's plan from turn 36.\n\nTurn 36: only possible move is D to (1,4). So action D.\n\nTurn 37: from (1,4), only possible move is D to (1,3). Action D.\n\nTurn 38: head at (1,3), direction D. Possible moves: D to (1,2), or R to (2,3) (since L wall, U body).\n\n(2,3) has food, so we should move R to eat it.\n\nAction R.\n\nThen, after eating, head at (2,3), direction R (since we moved right).\n\nNew positions as above.\n\nFood (2,3) eaten, removed.\n\nOther food: (4,5) is gone by turn 38? At turn 38, (4,5) food is gone, since life span ended after turn 37.\n\n(2,1) still there, life span 5 at turn 36, so at turn 38, life span 3 (36:5, 37:4, 38:3).\n\n(2,1) at (2,1).\n\nNow, from (2,3), head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: since direction R, cannot move L (reverse).\n\nCan move R to (3,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2).\n\nNow, current positions: head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nSo (3,3) not occupied, empty.\n\n(2,4) is occupied, body segment.\n\n(2,2) not occupied.\n\nU to (2,4): (2,4) is body, collision.\n\nD to (2,2): empty.\n\nR to (3,3): empty.\n\nL to (1,3) but reverse, not allowed, and also occupied.\n\nSo possible: R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nU invalid.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) is below, and (2,3) is gone.\n\n(2,1) at (2,1), we can go down to it.\n\nBut need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant yet.\n\nNow, if we move D to (2,2), then we can go to (2,1) next turn to eat food.\n\nIf we move R to (3,3), then we go right.\n\nBut (2,1) has life span 3 at turn 38, so can be eaten turn 38,39,40.\n\nAt turn 38, we are at (2,3), if we move D to (2,2), then at turn 39, from (2,2) we can move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nIf we move R to (3,3), then from (3,3) we might go elsewhere.\n\nBut (2,1) is close, so better to eat it soon.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,1), we grow, and then need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, at turn 38, after moving to (2,3), we should move D to (2,2) to head towards (2,1).\n\nAction D to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 39: head at (2,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,1), U to (2,3), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\nCurrent positions: after turn 38 move to (2,2), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious: before turn 39 move, positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,2): new head (2,2), then body: old head (2,3) becomes body, then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail (3,4) removed? No eat, so tail moves off.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4)  // (2,4) was second last, now tail.\n\n(3,4) removed.\n\nNow, (2,1) is empty, food there.\n\nFrom (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nU to (2,3) body, invalid.\n\nL to (1,2) empty.\n\nR to (3,2) empty, but (3,2) is not wall, but internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), not (3,2), so (3,2) ok.\n\nBut we want to eat (2,1), so move D to (2,1).\n\nAction D.\n\nThen eat food at (2,1), so grow.\n\nNew head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so (2,4) remains, and new segment? Positions: head (2,1), then body: old head (2,2), then previous body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (2,4) since no move.\n\nAfter eating, the tail stays, so the snake has one more segment: the tail cell is duplicated or something? No, when head moves to food, it occupies the cell, and since food was there, it eats, and the tail does not move, so the previous tail position is still there, and we add a new segment at the end, but since tail didn't move, the last segment remains, and we have an extra segment.\n\nStandard: positions: new head at food cell, then the old positions except the tail is not removed, so the body is old head position plus all old body positions.\n\nFor example, before move: positions P0 head, P1, P2, ..., P9 tail.\n\nMove to new cell with food: new head at new cell, then P0 becomes body, P1, P2, ..., P9 remains as is, so now 11 segments.\n\nIn this case, before turn 39 move: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,1) and eat: new head (2,1), then body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (2,4) remains, so positions from (2,1) to (2,4), etc.\n\nNow, food (2,1) eaten.\n\nNow, no other food immediately, but we have the grid.\n\nWe need to survive and perhaps go to other areas.\n\nBut let's list the actions so far.\n\nFrom turn 36:\n\nTurn 36: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3) eat food\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2)  // but at turn 39 we moved to (2,2), no eat yet.\n\nAt turn 39, we moved to (2,2), no food, so no eat.\n\nThen turn 40: from (2,2) move to (2,1) eat food.\n\nTurn 40.\n\nAt turn 40, head at (2,2), direction D, move D to (2,1) eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves: from (2,1), D to (2,0) wall, invalid; U to (2,2) body; L to (1,1); R to (3,1).\n\nU to (2,2) is body, and reverse? Direction is D, U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nL to (1,1) empty.\n\nR to (3,1) empty.\n\nSo can move L or R.\n\nNow, the snake is long, and we need to avoid colliding.\n\nPositions after eating (2,1): head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nSo the body occupies (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nFrom (2,1), move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is empty, (3,1) empty.\n\nMoving to (1,1) might lead to bottom-left corner, which could be risky.\n\nMoving to (3,1) towards center.\n\nBut we need to think about the food at (2,3) is gone, (2,1) gone, no other food? Only (2,3) and (2,1) and (4,5) gone, but (4,5) gone earlier.\n\nFood was (4,5) expired, (2,1) eaten, (2,3) eaten, so no food left? But life span of (2,3) is 8, but we ate it at turn 38, so it's gone.\n\nThe grid has no more food? But food might respawn or something? No, the state has only these foods, and we ate them or they expired.\n\nIn this game, food is given, and once eaten or expired, gone, no new food mentioned.\n\nBut to maximize score, we need to eat all possible, but we have eaten two: (2,3) and (2,1), and (4,5) expired.\n\nBut at turn 36, we could not eat (4,5) because we were far and it expired.\n\nNow, after eating (2,1), we need to survive, but with no food, we can just move around without growing, but the goal is to maximize score, so if no food, we just survive as long as possible, but since no more food, score is fixed at 2 (we ate two foods).\n\nBut perhaps we missed (4,5).\n\nAt turn 36, we were at (1,5), food at (4,5) with life span 2, so could be eaten turn 36 or 37.\n\nBut at turn 36, we could not move to (4,5) directly; it was far and blocked.\n\nFrom (1,5), only move to (1,4), then to (1,3), etc., not towards (4,5).\n\nSo we couldn't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 37, head at (1,4), we moved to (1,3), not towards (4,5).\n\nAnd (4,5) could only be eaten if head moves there when it's free, but tail was there at turn 36, moved away at turn 37, but at turn 37, head at (1,4), far, and (4,5) has life span 1, can be eaten turn 37, but we didn't go there.\n\nSo missed.\n\nBut in our plan, we ate two foods.\n\nNow back to turn 40 after eating (2,1).\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D.\n\nCannot move U (reverse), D wall, so must move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nSay we move R to (3,1) to avoid corner.\n\nAction R to (3,1).\n\nThen from there, continue.\n\nBut since no food, we just need to move safely.\n\nBut the question is to output actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since we need to think 5+ turns ahead, and current turn 36, so up to turn 41 or so.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but not how many, but since we are to think ahead, probably for a few turns.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 40, we can continue, but no food.\n\nPerhaps we can plan from beginning with the food at (4,5).\n\nAt turn 36, head at (1,5), direction D.\n\nOnly possible move is D to (1,4), as we had.\n\nBut is there a way to reach (4,5) earlier?\n\nAt turn 36, from (1,5), cannot go directly.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), at turn 37, from (1,4), only D to (1,3), not towards right.\n\nSo no, we cannot reach (4,5) in time.\n\nAt turn 36, the food at (4,5) is under tail, and to eat it, we need tail to move away and head to move there.\n\nAt turn 36, tail at (4,5), so if we don't eat food, tail will move when we move.\n\nAt turn 36, if we move, tail moves from (4,5), so (4,5) becomes free with food.\n\nThen at turn 37, head at (1,4), we could try to go to (4,5), but it's far, and life span only 1, so must be eaten turn 37.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (4,5) is not adjacent, we need multiple moves.\n\n(1,4) to (4,5): difference (3,1), so at least 4 moves away, since diagonal not direct.\n\nCannot reach in one move, so impossible to eat on turn 37.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 36, head at (1,5), to (4,5) is (3,0), so 3 steps right, but we cannot move right because (2,5) is body.\n\nSo impossible to eat (4,5).\n\nSo we missed it, but it was unavoidable.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nIn our initial plan, we ate (2,3) at turn 38 and (2,1) at turn 40.\n\nTurn 40 is when we ate (2,1).\n\nThen at turn 41, head at (2,1), after moving R to (3,1), for example.\n\nBut let's write the actions from turn 36.\n\nTurn 36: move D\n\nTurn 37: move D\n\nTurn 38: move R (to (2,3) eat)\n\nTurn 39: move D (to (2,2))  // turn 39 moved to (2,2)\n\nIn turn 39, from (2,3) we moved to (2,2), no eat.\n\nThen turn 40: move D to (2,1) eat\n\nNow turn 41: head at (2,1), direction D, but we moved to (3,1)? From (2,1), after eating, direction is D, but we move to (3,1) right.\n\nAfter turn 40 move to (2,1) eat, head at (2,1), direction from previous move is D, so current direction D.\n\nThen at turn 41, cannot move U (reverse), D to (2,0) wall, so must move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nSay move R to (3,1).\n\nAction R.\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R to (4,1), U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall invalid, L to (2,1) body.\n\nL to (2,1) reverse and body, invalid.\n\nD wall.\n\nU to (3,2) empty? Current positions: after turn 40, head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4)  // 12 segments? After eating (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — (2,4) is tail.\n\nNow after move to (3,1): new head (3,1), then body: old head (2,1) becomes body, then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (2,4) removed? No eat, so tail moves off.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), tail (2,5)  // (2,5) was second last, now tail.\n\n(3,2) is empty, not wall.\n\nU to (3,2) possible.\n\nR to (4,1) possible.\n\nD invalid.\n\nL to (2,1) body, invalid.\n\nSo move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay move U to (3,2) to go up.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since no food, we can just avoid walls and body.\n\nFor the answer, we need to output actions from turn 36 for several turns.\n\nSince we thought 5 turns ahead, from turn 36 to 41.\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R (to eat (2,3))\n\nTurn 39: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 40: D (to (2,1) eat)\n\nThen turn 41: R (to (3,1))\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 38 we ate (2,3), at turn 40 ate (2,1).\n\nNow for turn 41, we can say move R.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: not an issue here.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 38, when we moved to (2,3), it was free, no problem.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\nIs there a better way? For example, at turn 38, from (1,3), we could move D to (1,2) instead of R to (2,3), but then we might miss the food or something, but (2,3) has long life, but we can eat it later, but (2,1) has shorter life.\n\nIf at turn 38 we move D to (1,2), then turn 39 from (1,2) can move D to (1,1), or R to (2,2), etc.\n\nThen (2,3) can be eaten later, but (2,1) life span: at turn 39, life span 4 at turn 36, so turn 39:2, can be eaten turn 39 or 40.\n\nFrom (1,2), move R to (2,2), then turn 40 move to (2,1) or to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut eating (2,3) at turn 38 is fine.\n\nNo need to delay.\n\nSo our plan is ok.\n\nNow, for the answer, output actions from turn 36 to, say, turn 41 or so.\n\nBut turn 36 to turn 36+5=41.\n\nTurn 36: action D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: R (as example)\n\nIn turn 41, we moved R to (3,1), but we can specify.\n\nSince the food is gone, it might not matter, but to be precise.\n\nIn the state, all food is consumed or expired, so no more score, but we survive.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 36: D\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nFor turn 41, we can add, but not necessary, or stop at turn 40.\n\nBut think 5 turns ahead, so from 36 to 41.\n\nTurn 41: say R\n\nBut let's write in boxed.\n\nAlso, the head direction after each move.\n\nBut in answer, just the actions.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle (5,2), not affected.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 36 to turn 41). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current constraints**: The snake head is at (1,5) moving down (D). Due to no instant reverse, moving up (U) is not allowed on turn 36. Only moving down (D) to (1,4) is safe, as left (L) hits a wall and right (R) collides with the body at (2,5).\n- **Food opportunities**: \n  - Food at (4,5) has a life span of 2 at turn 36, meaning it disappears after turn 37. However, it is under the tail at turn 36, and the snake cannot reach it in time due to distance and body blocks.\n  - Food at (2,3) has a life span of 8 and can be eaten from turns 36 to 43. It is reachable by turn 38.\n  - Food at (2,1) has a life span of 5 and can be eaten from turns 36 to 40. It is reachable by turn 40.\n- **Path planning**: \n  - Turns 36 and 37 must be down (D) due to immediate constraints.\n  - On turn 38, moving right (R) to (2,3) eats the food safely, increasing the score.\n  - On turns 39 and 40, moving down (D) approaches and eats the food at (2,1) on turn 40.\n  - After eating both foods, the focus shifts to survival. On turn 41, moving right (R) to (3,1) avoids the bottom-left corner and potential traps.\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - All moves avoid walls (borders and internal obstacle at (5,2)) and body collisions.\n  - No tail reward danger is triggered, as the head is never adjacent to the tail when food is under it.\n- **Score maximization**: Eating both positive foods at (2,3) and (2,1) yields +2 score. The food at (4,5) is unattainable and expires.\n\nThe planned moves are:\n\n- Turn 36: Move down (D) to (1,4) – only safe option.\n- Turn 37: Move down (D) to (1,3) – continues safe path, setting up for food access.\n- Turn 38: Move right (R) to (2,3) – eats food, increases score to +1.\n- Turn 39: Move down (D) to (2,2) – positions for next food.\n- Turn 40: Move down (D) to (2,1) – eats food, increases score to +2.\n- Turn 41: Move right (R) to (3,1) – avoids dead ends and maintains mobility.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 37: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 38: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 39: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 40: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 41: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 37, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are off-limits, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so moving to any of those is a wall collision. Also, (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,4), and direction is down (D). The positions are: [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)]. So head at (1,4), and tail at (4,4). Let me list the segments in order:\n\nIndex 0: head (1,4)\n\nIndex 1: (1,5)\n\nIndex 2: (1,6)\n\nIndex 3: (2,6)\n\nIndex 4: (3,6)\n\nIndex 5: (3,5)\n\nIndex 6: (2,5)\n\nIndex 7: (2,4)\n\nIndex 8: (3,4)\n\nIndex 9: tail (4,4)\n\nSnake has 10 segments.\n\nHead direction is down, meaning it was moving down to reach (1,4). Since direction is D, and head is at (1,4), that means it came from (1,5), which is position index 1. Positions are head first, so snake was moving down to (1,4) from (1,5).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1, life span 1 (so disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,3) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (5,4) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (4,5), life span 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 37 if not eaten, since countdown decreases every turn including current. So if not eaten on turn 37, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning after turn 37+4=41, but countdown starts from turn 37, so on turn 37, life span is 4, then turn 38 it becomes 3, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. But since it can be eaten only when head moves onto it, we need to consider when it expires.\n\nNow, my task is to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. I need to think about survival first.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSo available cells:\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) — but (1,6) is snake body, (2,6) snake, (3,6) snake.\n\ny=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) snake, (3,5) snake, (4,5) food, (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(4,5) is food with life span 1.\n\ny=4: (1,4) snake head, (2,4) snake, (3,4) snake, (4,4) snake tail, (5,4) food, (6,4)\n\n(5,4) is food with life span 10.\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3) food, (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — but (5,2) is wall, so (5,3) is ok? (5,2) is the obstacle, so (5,3) is playable.\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) wall, (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1) food, (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\ny=0 and x=0,7 y=0,7 walls.\n\nSnake head at (1,4) with direction down. Since direction is down, and head is at (1,4), it just moved down to there. So possible moves: since it was moving down, it can't instantly reverse to up. So cannot move up to (1,5), because that would be opposite direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down), so last move was down to (1,4). Therefore, for the next move, it cannot move up (U), because that would be instant reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: left (L) to (0,4) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid. Right (R) to (2,4), but (2,4) is a body segment? Let's see positions: (2,4) is index 7, which is a body segment. But in snake, moving into the tail is sometimes allowed because the tail moves.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, when moving, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok, no collision. But if it's any other body segment, it's collision.\n\nHere, tail is at (4,4). (2,4) is position index 7, which is not the tail; tail is (4,4) index 9.\n\nSnake positions: indices 0 to 9.\n\nHead: (1,4) index 0\n\nThen (1,5) index 1\n\n(1,6) index 2\n\n(2,6) index 3\n\n(3,6) index 4\n\n(3,5) index 5\n\n(2,5) index 6\n\n(2,4) index 7\n\n(3,4) index 8\n\nTail: (4,4) index 9\n\nSo for head at (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (1,5) — but (1,5) is index 1, which is a body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision with body. Also, instant reverse: since head direction is down, moving up is opposite, so invalid anyway. So U is not possible.\n\n- Down (D): to (1,3) — y=3, x=1, is that within bounds? y=3 is between 1 and 6, so yes. Is it occupied? (1,3) is not in snake positions, and no wall, so possible.\n\n- Left (L): to (0,4) — x=0 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- Right (R): to (2,4) — (2,4) is index 7, which is a body segment, not tail. So moving there would cause body collision, since it's not the tail cell.\n\nTail is at (4,4), so (2,4) is body, not tail. Therefore, moving to (2,4) is deadly.\n\nSo only possible move from current position is down to (1,3).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nAvailable adjacent cells:\n\n- North: (1,5) - occupied by body (index 1), not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- South: (1,3) - empty, no wall, should be safe.\n\n- West: (0,4) - wall, invalid.\n\n- East: (2,4) - occupied by body (index 7), not tail, so collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nBut the head direction is down, so moving down is fine, not reverse.\n\nNow, if I move down to (1,3), what happens?\n\nOn this turn, turn 37, if I move to (1,3), I don't eat any food, since (1,3) has no food.\n\nFoods are at (4,5), (2,1), (2,3), (5,4).\n\n(2,3) is food, but I'm moving to (1,3), not (2,3).\n\nAfter moving, snake positions: head moves to (1,3), then each segment moves to the previous position, so tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head at (1,3), then body: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to where? When head moves to a new cell, the body follows.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after moving down to (1,3):\n\n- New head: (1,3)\n\n- Then, the segment that was at index 0 (old head) becomes body, but since head moved, the first body segment is now at (1,4) — position index 1 moves to where index 0 was? Let's think carefully.\n\nPositions before move: [ (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (1,3):\n\n- Head new: (1,3)\n\n- Then, the body segments shift: index 1 moves to where head was, (1,4); but head was at (1,4), so index 1 (1,5) moves to (1,4)\n\nGenerally: the new position list: [new_head] + positions[:-1] but shifted.\n\nNew positions: head is (1,3)\n\nThen, the segment that was at index 0 (head) is not there, so the body starts from index 1, but each moves to the position of the previous index.\n\nAfter head moves:\n\n- Position of new segment 0: (1,3)\n\n- New segment 1: position of old segment 0, which is (1,4)\n\n- New segment 2: position of old segment 1, which is (1,5)\n\n- New segment 3: position of old segment 2, which is (1,6)\n\n- New segment 4: position of old segment 3, which is (2,6)\n\n- New segment 5: position of old segment 4, which is (3,6)\n\n- New segment 6: position of old segment 5, which is (3,5)\n\n- New segment 7: position of old segment 6, which is (2,5)\n\n- New segment 8: position of old segment 7, which is (2,4)\n\n- New segment 9: position of old segment 8, which is (3,4)\n\nOld segment 9 was (4,4), but it's not included; the tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nTail was at (4,4), but since it moved, (4,4) is now empty.\n\nOld tail (4,4) is gone, and new tail is at (3,4), which was previously index 8.\n\nNow, on this move, no food eaten, so length unchanged.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) with life span 1, which will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nI can't eat it from here.\n\nNow, for the next moves, I need to plan.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 37.\n\nCurrent turn is 37, I must choose action for turn 37.\n\nAs per above, only possible move is down to (1,3), so I have to do that.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other possibility.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction down.\n\nCannot move up (reverse).\n\nCannot move left (wall).\n\nCannot move right to (2,4) because it's a body segment (index 7), and not tail.\n\nUnless... is (2,4) the tail? No, tail is (4,4).\n\nAnd the rule says you can move to tail cell only if it's the tail, but here it's not.\n\nSo yes, only down to (1,3) is possible.\n\nTherefore, for turn 37, I must move down to (1,3).\n\nAction: D (down)\n\nNow, after that, on turn 38, head is at (1,3), and direction is down, since I moved down.\n\nNow, from (1,3), possible moves.\n\nFirst, head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (1,4) — (1,4) is now occupied by body? After move, positions: head (1,3), then (1,4) is segment 1, body.\n\nMoving up to (1,4) would be to a body segment. Is it the tail? Tail is at (3,4), not (1,4). So collision.\n\nAlso, moving up would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is down, moving up is reverse, so invalid anyway.\n\n- Down (D) to (1,2) — (1,2) should be empty, no wall. y=2 is playable.\n\n- Left (L) to (0,2) — x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Right (R) to (2,3) — (2,3) is food, but is it occupied? Currently, after turn 37 move, positions are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (2,3) is not in this list, so empty. And it has food.\n\nAlso, no wall.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (1,2) or right to (2,3).\n\nMoving down is same direction, moving right is perpendicular, both allowed since not reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood at (2,3) has life span 7, so it will be there for a while, but I can eat it now if I move right.\n\nBut eating it increases length, and I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,1) and (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid after turn 37 move.\n\nAfter turn 37: snake positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,5) was not eaten and life span 1, so after turn 37, it disappears because life span decreases to 0 and gone.\n\n- (2,1) life span 4, so after turn 37, it has 3 turns left? Life span decreases every turn including current, but eating happens when head moves onto it on that turn.\n\nOn turn 37, I didn't eat (4,5), so at the end of turn 37, life span decreases to 0, and it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,1) life span 4, on turn 37 it has 4, after turn 37 it will have 3 for turn 38, etc.\n\nTurn 37: food (4,5) has life span 1, if not eaten on turn 37, it disappears after turn 37.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has life span 4, on turn 37 it is 4, meaning it can be eaten on turns 37,38,39,40, and disappears after turn 40 (since after 4 decreases, it goes to 0).\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food with life span N on turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1 or at start of turn t+N? I think after it decreases to 0.\n\nExample: on turn t, life span N, if not eaten, at end of turn, life span decreases to N-1 for next turn.\n\nIf life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (4,5) on turn 37: life span 1, if not eaten on turn 37, at end of turn 37, life span decreases to 0, so it disappears.\n\nFor (2,1) on turn 37: life span 4, so it exists on turns 37,38,39,40 (since life span decreases each turn, so on turn 38 it will be 3, turn 39:2, turn 40:1, and if not eaten by turn 40, disappears after turn 40 (life span 0 on turn 41?).\n\nOn turn 37: life span 4\n\nAfter turn 37 (if not eaten), start turn 38: life span 3\n\nAfter turn 38: life span 2 for turn 39\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 40: life span 0, so disappears before turn 41.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to turn 38.\n\nAfter turn 37 move to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves for turn 38:\n\n- Down to (1,2)\n\n- Right to (2,3) which has food.\n\nIf I move right to (2,3), I eat the food at (2,3), which is positive, so length increases by 1.\n\nThen snake grows, so tail doesn't move; new head at (2,3), and the tail stays, so positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (3,4), and tail (3,4) stays, so new segment added.\n\nAfter eating, length increases, so when head moves to food, it eats, so the tail doesn't move, a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n\nStandard: when snake eats food, head moves to food cell, food is consumed, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail stays, length increases.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous positions, with tail not removed.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nIf head moves to (2,3) and eats food:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nThen, the body segments: since it ate, no movement of tail, so new positions: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] and since length increases, the tail (3,4) remains, so now 11 segments.\n\n(3,4) was tail, and it stays, so new segment at (3,4).\n\nNow, if I move down to (1,2), no food eaten, so tail moves, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,4), and (3,4) is gone, tail at (2,4) or something.\n\nIf move down to (1,2) without eating:\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nThen body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — but (3,4) was tail, and since no eat, tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n\nPositions after: head (1,2), then (1,3) (previous head), then (1,4) (previous seg1), ..., up to (2,5) (previous seg6), and (2,4) (previous seg7), and (3,4) is gone, so new tail at (2,4)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (1,3), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,6), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4), 9: (3,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,2) without eating:\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nNew body: positions of previous indices 0 to 8: so (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nNew tail at (2,4)\n\nPrevious index 9 (3,4) is removed.\n\nNow, for turn 38, I have choice: move right to (2,3) to eat food, or move down to (1,2).\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (2,1) below, and (5,4) to the right.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, if I eat at (2,3) on turn 38, I grow to 11 segments, and head at (2,3).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut I should consider the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (3,4), and (2,3) is adjacent to (3,4)? (2,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (2,3) and (3,4) are diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells: for (2,3), neighbors: (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3)\n\n(3,4) is not a neighbor; it's diagonal.\n\nSo not adjacent, so no tail reward danger here.\n\nSafe to eat.\n\nIf I don't eat now, (2,3) has life span 7, so it will be there for a while, but I can eat later.\n\nBut moving to (1,2) might be better to go for (2,1) or something.\n\n(2,1) has life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 40.\n\nOn turn 38, if I move to (1,2), then on turn 39, I can move down to (1,1) or right to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), which is below and right.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move down to (1,1), but (1,1) has no food, or right to (2,2), then down to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut (2,1) life span 4, on turn 38 it has life span 3 (since after turn 37, it decreased to 3 for turn 38).\n\nOn turn 37, (2,1) had life span 4.\n\nAfter turn 37, not eaten, so for turn 38, life span 3.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) for turn 38 has life span 6 (since on turn 37 it was 7, after turn 37 decreases to 6 for turn 38).\n\nLife span decreases at the end of turn if not eaten.\n\nOn turn t, food has life span L, if eaten on that turn, good; if not, at end of turn, L decreases, and if L>1, it stays, else disappears.\n\nFor (2,3): on turn 37, L=7, not eaten, so after turn 37, L=6 for turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): on turn 37 L=4, not eaten, after turn 37 L=3 for turn 38.\n\n(5,4): on turn 37 L=10, not eaten, after turn 37 L=9 for turn 38.\n\nNow back to turn 38 choices.\n\nIf I eat at (2,3) on turn 38, I get +1, length 11.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction right (since I moved right from (1,3)).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: up to (2,4), down to (2,2), left to (1,3), right to (3,3).\n\nNow, (2,4) is a body segment? After eating, positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied by body (index 9 or something), not tail. Tail is at (3,4).\n\nMoving to (2,4) would be collision.\n\n(1,3) is also body, index 1.\n\n(3,3) is empty.\n\n(2,2) empty.\n\nSo from (2,3), can move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3), or up to (2,4) but collision, left to (1,3) collision.\n\nAlso, direction: I moved right to (2,3), so current direction right, cannot move left (reverse).\n\nSo possible: down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (1,2) on turn 38, head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nThen can move down to (1,1) or right to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,4) which is far, and life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's consider the area.\n\nThe snake is currently mostly on the left and top, with a loop.\n\nPositions: after turn 37: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo it forms a sort of U-shape or something.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,6) down, then right to (2,6), right to (3,6), down to (3,5)? (3,6) to (3,5) is down, then (3,5) to (2,5) left, then (2,5) to (2,4) down, then (2,4) to (3,4) right, tail at (3,4).\n\nSo it's a bit messy.\n\nIf I eat at (2,3), I add a segment at the tail, so tail at (3,4) stays.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I go to (3,3), then I can go to (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut there is food at (2,1), which is below.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), so from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) then to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut (2,1) life span 3 on turn 38, so I have until turn 40 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) has life span 6 on turn 38, so more time.\n\nAlso, (5,4) at (5,4), which is near the tail area.\n\n(5,4) has food, and it's at (5,4), which is currently occupied? After turn 37, positions include (3,4) and (4,4) was tail but moved, so (4,4) is empty, (5,4) is food.\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4, and there's an obstacle at (5,2), but (5,4) is above, so ok.\n\nTo reach (5,4), I need to go right.\n\nBut the snake body is in the way.\n\nFor long-term survival, I should avoid trapping myself.\n\nSince I must move down on turn 37 to (1,3), then on turn 38, if I move right to (2,3) to eat, I grow, and head is at (2,3).\n\nThen from there, I can move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I move to (2,2), then I can go to (2,1) to eat the food there.\n\n(2,1) has life span 3 on turn 38, so on turn 39 or 40 I can eat it.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 37: only choice, move D to (1,3)\n\nNow for turn 38, I need to choose.\n\nOption 1: move R to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 39: from (2,3), can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 40: from (2,2), can move D to (2,1) to eat food (2,1), or L to (1,2), or R to (3,2), etc.\n\n(2,1) is food, so I can eat it on turn 40.\n\nLife span of (2,1): on turn 38, L=3, so can be eaten on turn 38,39,40.\n\nIf I eat on turn 40, it's ok.\n\nAfter eating at (2,3) on turn 38, length 11.\n\nThen at (2,2) on turn 39, no food there, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nThen at (2,1) on turn 40, eat, length 12.\n\nBut from (2,2), if I move to (2,1) on turn 40, I eat.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (2,1) earlier.\n\nFrom turn 38, if I move down to (1,2) instead of right.\n\nSo option 2: turn 38 move D to (1,2)\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 39: from (1,2), can move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2)\n\n(1,1) is empty, no food.\n\n(2,2) empty.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction R.\n\nThen turn 40: from (2,2), can move D to (2,1) to eat, or U to (2,3), or L to (1,2), or R to (3,2)\n\nU to (2,3) has food, but (2,3) is not occupied now? After turn 38 move to (1,2), let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 37: positions (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nTurn 38 move D to (1,2): no eat, so new positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)  -- tail at (2,4), since (3,4) removed.\n\n(3,4) was tail, removed, so new tail at (2,4).\n\nNow food at (2,3) is still there.\n\nTurn 39: from (1,2), move R to (2,2) -- (2,2) empty, no eat.\n\nThen new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) -- tail at (2,4)\n\nThen turn 40: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is food, so eat, new head (2,1), then body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (2,5), and tail (2,4) stays, so length 11, new segment at (2,4).\n\nBut (2,4) was tail, now it stays.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 39 from (1,2) I move directly to (2,2), then to (2,1) on turn 40.\n\nIn both options, I can eat (2,1) on turn 40.\n\nBut in option 1, I also eat (2,3) on turn 38.\n\nSo eating (2,3) gives an extra point.\n\nMoreover, in option 1, after eating (2,3), I have more space or something.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4).\n\nI need to go towards that for long-term.\n\nAlso, there might be risks of dead ends.\n\nFor example, the left side: from (1,2), if I go down to (1,1), then I might be trapped, since left and down are walls or out of bound.\n\n(1,1): can move up to (1,2), right to (2,1), or down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall.\n\nSo only up or right.\n\nBut if snake body is around, it might be dangerous.\n\nCurrently, after turn 37, the body is above, so (1,2) might be safe to move to.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns: turns 37 to 41 or so.\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 38: if I move R to (2,3) to eat, score +1\n\nThen turn 39: from (2,3), I need to move, say to (2,2) or (3,3)\n\nIf I move to (2,2), then turn 40: to (2,1) to eat another food, score +1\n\nThen head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nFrom there, I can move to (2,2) but that might be body, or (3,1), etc.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), positions will have head at (2,1), and body including (2,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,4), I need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can move right to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., but there is obstacle at (5,2), so (5,1) is available, then (6,1), then up.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\n(5,4) has life span 10, on turn 37 it was 10, so after decreases, on turn 38 it is 9, turn 39:8, etc., so plenty of time.\n\nBut I should also consider the food at (2,3) can be eaten later, but since I have the chance now, better to eat it to score.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it on turn 38, and I go down to (1,2), then I might not be able to eat (2,3) later if the snake blocks it.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,1), then after that, (2,3) might still be there, but to eat it, I need to go to (2,3) from (2,1) or something.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move up to (2,2), but (2,2) might be body, then to (2,3).\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nSuppose turn 37: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 38: D to (1,2)  // not eating (2,3)\n\nThen positions: head (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)  // tail at (2,4)\n\nFood (2,3) still there with L=6 for turn 38.\n\nTurn 39: from (1,2), move R to (2,2)  // no food at (2,2)\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)? Previous tail was (2,4), removed, so new tail at (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (2,2): new head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)  // new tail at (2,5)\n\n(2,4) was removed.\n\nNow (2,3) is still empty, food there.\n\nTurn 40: from (2,2), move U to (2,3) to eat food.\n\nMove U to (2,3) is up.\n\nCurrent direction: from (1,2) to (2,2) was right, so direction right.\n\nMoving up is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nMove U to (2,3), eat food.\n\nNew head (2,3), then body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (3,5), and tail (2,5) stays, so length 11, new segment at (2,5).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)  // with (2,5) as new tail.\n\nBut (2,5) was body, now it becomes the last segment.\n\nCompared to eating earlier on turn 38, I still eat it, but on turn 40.\n\nAnd I also eat (2,1) or not?\n\nOn turn 40, I ate (2,3), but (2,1) is still there.\n\nFrom (2,3), after eating, I can move to (2,1)? Not directly.\n\n(2,1) life span: on turn 38 L=3, turn 39 L=2, turn 40 L=1, so on turn 40 I can eat it if I move to it.\n\nBut from (2,3) on turn 40, if I move to (2,2) or something.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 40 I moved to (2,3) to eat, so I didn't go to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) can be eaten on turn 40 if I go to it.\n\nBut in the sequence above, on turn 40 from (2,2), I chose to move up to (2,3) instead of down to (2,1).\n\nIf I want to eat (2,1), on turn 40 from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen I eat (2,1) on turn 40, score +1.\n\nBut (2,3) is not eaten, and on turn 40, (2,3) has life span? Let's track.\n\n(2,3) on turn 37 L=7, not eaten, turn 38 L=6, not eaten, turn 39 L=5? After turn 38 not eaten, L decreases to 5 for turn 39? Let's calculate properly.\n\nTurn 37: (2,3) L=7\n\nNot eaten on turn 37, after turn 37, L=6 for turn 38\n\nNot eaten on turn 38, after turn 38, L=5 for turn 39\n\nNot eaten on turn 39, after turn 39, L=4 for turn 40\n\nOn turn 40, L=4, so can be eaten later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) on turn 37 L=4, not eaten, after turn 37 L=3 for turn 38\n\nNot eaten on turn 38, after turn 38 L=2 for turn 39\n\nNot eaten on turn 39, after turn 39 L=1 for turn 40\n\nIf not eaten on turn 40, after turn 40 L=0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 40, I can eat (2,1) by moving down from (2,2).\n\nThen head at (2,1), eat, length increases.\n\nThen (2,3) can be eaten later.\n\nBut in terms of scoring, eating both is good.\n\nBut in the first option, I eat (2,3) on turn 38 and (2,1) on turn 40, scoring two points by turn 40.\n\nIn the second option, if I eat (2,1) on turn 40, and (2,3) later, same two points, but later.\n\nAlso, in the first option, I have an extra segment earlier.\n\nBut for survival, it might be similar.\n\nHowever, there is a food at (5,4) that I should consider.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this grid, there is space.\n\nLet's see the right side.\n\nAfter turn 37, the tail is at (3,4), and (4,4) is empty, (5,4) has food.\n\nIf I can move to (4,4) or (5,4), I can eat.\n\nBut from current position, I'm at (1,3) on turn 38.\n\nTo reach (5,4), I need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), if I don't eat at (2,3), I can move down to (1,2), then to (2,2), then to (3,2), etc., but (5,2) is obstacle, so I have to go around.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so cells around: (4,2), (5,1), (5,3), (6,2) are playable.\n\nBut to reach (5,4), I can go via (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\n(4,4) is currently empty after turn 37, since tail moved from there.\n\nIn turn 37 move, we had positions after: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) so (4,4) is empty.\n\n(5,4) is food.\n\nIf I can get to (4,4) or (5,4), I can eat (5,4).\n\nBut from (1,3), it's far.\n\nMinimum distance: from (1,3) to (5,4) is 4 steps right and 1 up, but with body, it might not be direct.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (2,3) on turn 38, then to (3,3) on turn 39, then to (4,3) on turn 40, then to (4,4) or (5,4) on turn 41.\n\n(4,4) is empty, so I can move to (4,4) on turn 41, but no food, or to (5,4) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) to (5,4) is up-right, not adjacent, so I need to move to (5,3) or (4,4) first.\n\n(4,3) to (5,4) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3).\n\nSo from (4,3), I can move to (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nThen to (5,4).\n\nSo it takes several turns.\n\n(5,4) has life span 10 on turn 37, so on turn 38 L=9, turn 39 L=8, etc., so by turn 41 it's still there, L=6 or something.\n\nTurn 37 L=10, after not eaten, turn 38 L=9, turn 39 L=8, turn 40 L=7, turn 41 L=6, so yes.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, for turn 37, I have to move D.\n\nThen for turn 38, I think it's better to eat the food at (2,3) since it's immediate and I have the chance, and it doesn't block me from going down to (2,1) later.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I score sooner.\n\nAlso, in the position after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), I can then move down to (2,2) on turn 39, then to (2,1) on turn 40 to eat, as I thought earlier.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can start moving right towards (5,4).\n\nFor example, on turn 41, from (2,1), move R to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut there is food at (2,3) which I already ate.\n\nAnother food is (5,4).\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 37: move D to (1,3)  // only choice\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3) to eat food at (2,3)  // score +1\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction R\n\nTurn 39: from (2,3), move D to (2,2)  // no food there\n\nHead at (2,2), direction D\n\nTurn 40: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food at (2,1)  // score +1\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to (5,4).\n\nPossible moves from (2,1): U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body? After eating at (2,1), positions: let's track.\n\nAfter turn 40 eat at (2,1):\n\nBefore move, on turn 40, head at (2,2), positions: from turn 39.\n\nTurn 39: after move to (2,2), no eat, so positions: head (2,2), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 38: head at (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)  // since ate at (2,3), tail at (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 38 eat: positions [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]  // 11 segments, tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2) -- (2,2) no food, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)  // tail at (2,4), (3,4) removed\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1) -- (2,1) has food, so eat.\n\nNew head (2,1), then body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)  // and since ate, tail (2,4) stays, so new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]  // 12 segments, tail at (2,4)\n\nNow head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nTurn 41: from (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,2) -- (2,2) is body segment, not tail (tail is (2,4)), so collision\n\n- D to (2,0) -- y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L to (1,1) -- (1,1) should be empty\n\n- R to (3,1) -- (3,1) empty\n\nAlso, current direction down, moving up is reverse, so U invalid anyway.\n\nMoving left or right is perpendicular.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1)\n\nNow, to go towards (5,4), moving right is better.\n\nSo move R to (3,1)\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction R\n\nTurn 42: from (3,1), move R to (4,1) or U to (3,2), etc.\n\n(4,1) empty.\n\nMove R to (4,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to output up to turn 41 or more.\n\nThe answer should include actions for turn 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nSince turn 37 is fixed, and turn 38 I choose R to eat.\n\nThen turn 39 D, turn 40 D to eat, then turn 41 R.\n\nNow for turn 42, from (3,1), move R to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 43 to (5,1), but (5,1) is playable, no wall.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move U to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall, obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2) wall invalid, D to (5,0) wall invalid, L to (4,1), R to (6,1)\n\nR to (6,1) or U invalid, so only L or R, but L is back, so R to (6,1)\n\nThen from (6,1), I can move U to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,4), I need to go up.\n\nFrom (4,1), instead of going to (5,1), I can go to (4,2) then (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be available.\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 42, after moving to (4,1) on turn 42.\n\nLet's list actions:\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: R (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 42: from (3,1), move R to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 43: from (4,1), can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1) or L to (3,1) but back.\n\nU to (4,2) or R to (5,1)\n\nIf move R to (5,1), then as above, only can move R to (6,1) or L back.\n\nThen from (6,1), move U to (6,2), then to (6,3), (6,4), then to (5,4) but (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, so from (6,4) to (5,4) left.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nFrom (4,1), move U to (4,2) on turn 43.\n\nThen from (4,2), move U to (4,3) on turn 44.\n\nThen from (4,3), move U to (4,4) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\n(4,4) might be empty or not, but currently, after many moves, it should be.\n\nThen to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) food can be eaten.\n\nSince I have to output only up to a few turns, I can stop at turn 41 or 42.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 37.\n\nAlso, for the food at (2,3), if I don't eat it on turn 38, I can eat it later, but in the sequence above, I did eat it.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, there was food at (4,5) which disappeared.\n\nBut I think my plan is fine.\n\nTo maximize, since (2,3) is close, eat it.\n\nMoreover, the tail reward danger is not an issue here.\n\nSo I'll go with:\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R (to eat (2,3))\n\nTurn 39: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 40: D (to eat (2,1))\n\nThen for turn 41: from (2,1) move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 42: from (3,1) move R to (4,1)\n\nI need to specify the actions.\n\nBut in turn 39, moving to (2,2), no food, and turn 40 to (2,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 41 R.\n\nBut I should include one more turn.\n\nSince the grid has width, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think 5 turns: 37 to 41.\n\nTurn 37,38,39,40,41: that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 37, then 38,39,40,41: 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 41 I move R to (3,1), which is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the answer.\n\nBut in the food, I ate two foods by turn 40.\n\nIf I didn't eat on turn 38, I might not eat both, but I did.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but I'm not near it yet.\n\nSo I think this is acceptable.\n\nFor long-term, after turn 41, I can go to (4,1), then to (4,2), etc., to reach (5,4).\n\nBut since I don't need to output beyond, it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence: D, R, D, D, R for turns 37 to 41.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nTurn 37: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3)  // direction now R\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2)  // direction D\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1)  // direction D\n\nTurn 41: move R to (3,1)  // direction R\n\nAll valid moves.\n\nAnd I avoided risks; no collisions.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nBased on the current state and the need to maximize score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 37 to 41). The analysis prioritizes eating available positive food where safe, avoiding collisions, and considering food life spans. The snake starts at turn 37 with head at (1,4) and direction down (D). Only one move is possible on turn 37 due to constraints: moving down (D) to (1,3) is the only safe option, as other moves lead to walls or body collisions.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Food Life Spans**:\n  - (4,5): Life span 1, disappears after turn 37 if not eaten (cannot be eaten on turn 37, so it vanishes).\n  - (2,1): Life span 4 on turn 37, decreases to 3 on turn 38, 2 on turn 39, 1 on turn 40, and disappears after turn 40. Must be eaten by turn 40.\n  - (2,3): Life span 7 on turn 37, decreases to 6 on turn 38, 5 on turn 39, etc., with ample time to eat later if needed.\n  - (5,4): Life span 10 on turn 37, decreases slowly, so it can be targeted later.\n- **Immediate Risks**: \n  - On turn 37, moving up (U) is invalid (reverse direction) and leads to body collision at (1,5).\n  - Moving left (L) hits a wall at (0,4).\n  - Moving right (R) to (2,4) causes body collision (not the tail).\n- **Turn 38 Decision**: After moving to (1,3), eating (2,3) on turn 38 is optimal. It scores +1, and (2,3) is adjacent and safe (no tail reward danger, as the tail at (3,4) is not adjacent). Skipping it risks the snake body blocking access later.\n- **Subsequent Turns**: \n  - After eating (2,3), move down to (2,2) on turn 39 (safe, no food).\n  - Then move down to (2,1) on turn 40 to eat it before it disappears (scores another +1).\n  - On turn 41, move right to (3,1) to start navigating toward (5,4) for future scoring, avoiding dead ends.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - Eating (2,3) and (2,1) by turn 40 maximizes immediate points without trapping the snake.\n  - The path to (5,4) is feasible later (e.g., via (4,1), (4,2), etc.), with life span allowing delays.\n  - No risk of tail reward danger in this sequence, as no food is adjacent to the tail when eaten.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 37 to 41):\n- **Turn 37 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to (1,3) – only safe move; no food eaten.\n- **Turn 38**: Move right (R) to (2,3) – eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 11).\n- **Turn 39**: Move down (D) to (2,2) – no food; safe move toward (2,1).\n- **Turn 40**: Move down (D) to (2,1) – eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 12).\n- **Turn 41**: Move right (R) to (3,1) – no food; begins path to (5,4) for future turns.\n\n### Detailed Path Justification:\n- **Turn 37 (D to (1,3))**: Mandatory move to avoid death. Direction becomes down.\n- **Turn 38 (R to (2,3))**: Eats (2,3) safely (life span 6 remains, but early eating prevents future obstruction). Direction becomes right.\n- **Turn 39 (D to (2,2))**: Moves toward (2,1) without growing, keeping space. Direction becomes down.\n- **Turn 40 (D to (2,1))**: Eats (2,1) just before it disappears (life span 1 on turn 40). Direction becomes down.\n- **Turn 41 (R to (3,1))**: Avoids moving up (reverse) or left (into body); positions snake to access the right side. Direction becomes right.\n\nThis sequence scores 2 points by turn 40, avoids all collisions, and sets up for future food at (5,4). Beyond turn 41, the AI should continue toward (5,4) (e.g., via (4,1), (4,2), (5,3), or (4,4)) to eat it within its life span.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: D \\\\\nTurn 38: R \\\\\nTurn 39: D \\\\\nTurn 40: D \\\\\nTurn 41: R\n}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,3), and the body segments follow: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since down is (x,y-1). Head is at (1,3), and direction is D, so moving down would go to (1,2).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,1) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,3) with life span 6, value +1\n\n- (5,4) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nThen: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nListing in order: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,6), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4), 9: (3,4) tail.\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nCurrent head direction is D, down. So from (1,3), moving down would go to (1,2).\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is D, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nCurrent direction D, so I cannot move U (up) on the next turn because that's opposite. So possible moves: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see what cells are occupied or dangerous.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nAlso, snake body: I need to avoid colliding with body segments except the tail, since when I move, the tail moves, so I can move to the tail's current position only if the tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,4), and it's not adjacent to head, so probably safe for now.\n\nHead at (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- Down (D) to (1,2)\n\n- Left (L) to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right (R) to (2,3)\n\n- Up (U) to (1,4) but (1,4) is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail, so collision. Also, instant reverse is not allowed since current direction is D, U is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo valid moves from (1,3) with direction D: D to (1,2), R to (2,3)\n\nL to (0,3) is wall, U is invalid.\n\nNow, (2,3) has food! Food at (2,3) with value +1, life span 6.\n\n(1,2) is empty, I think. Let me check food positions: (2,1), (2,3), (5,4). No food at (1,2), so it's free.\n\nBut (1,2) is not a wall? y=2, x=1, borders are walls, but (1,2) is inside, so should be free.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) has food.\n\nNow, if I move to (2,3), I eat the food, snake grows to 11 segments, and I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think about the future.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it might kill because of collision.\n\nHere, tail is at (3,4), head is at (1,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; (1,3) to (2,3) or (1,4) etc.\n\nDistance: |dx| + |dy| = |1-3| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, not 1, so not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (1,2)\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: D to (1,1), L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2), U to (1,3) but (1,3) is now where the body was, but after moving, the snake moves, so positions update.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nWhen I move, the head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat food, tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (1,2), no food, so tail at (3,4) is removed, and new positions: head at (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). Original tail (3,4) is gone, so segments: from head: (1,2), then the old positions shifted: index 0 was (1,3), now it's (1,2), index 1 was (1,4) now at (1,3), index 2 (1,5) now at (1,4), index 3 (1,6) now at (1,5), index 4 (2,6) now at (1,6)? No.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions list: before move: [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nAfter move D to (1,2): head to (1,2), then body: segment 1 moves to where head was (1,3), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (1,4), ..., segment 9 moves to where segment 8 was (2,4), and segment 10 (tail) was at (3,4), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so new positions: [ (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] and tail is (2,4).\n\nOriginal segments: 10 segments. After move without eating, 9 segments? No.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food eaten, snake length same, but tail moves forward, so one segment is removed from tail.\n\nStart with 10 segments. Head moves to new position, each body segment advances, the last segment (tail) is removed. So new snake has 9 segments? But in the list, positions are updated.\n\nFor example, head new position, then the first body segment takes the old head position, second takes old first body, ..., up to the second last takes the old position of the one before last, and the last segment is discarded.\n\nIn terms of indices: let S be the list of positions.\n\nS[0] is head.\n\nAfter move to new cell P, new head is P, new S[0] = P, new S[1] = old S[0], new S[2] = old S[1], ..., new S[k] = old S[k-1] for k=1 to len-1, and the last segment old S[len-1] is removed.\n\nSo length decreases by 1 if no food.\n\nBut if food eaten, tail not removed, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, if move to (1,2), no food, so new snake: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — 10 positions? Original 10 segments, after move without eating, should be 9 segments.\n\nOriginal: 10 positions.\n\nAfter move: head to (1,2), then S[1] to old S[0] (1,3), S[2] to old S[1] (1,4), S[3] to old S[2] (1,5), S[4] to old S[3] (1,6), S[5] to old S[4] (2,6), S[6] to old S[5] (3,6), S[7] to old S[6] (3,5), S[8] to old S[7] (2,5), S[9] to old S[8] (2,4)? But S[9] is the last, and it should be removed, so new positions are only up to S[8], which is (2,5) or something.\n\nLet's list:\n\nOld positions: index 0: (1,3), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (1,6), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4), 9: (3,4)\n\nAfter move down to (1,2):\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nNew body: S[1] = old S[0] = (1,3)\n\nS[2] = old S[1] = (1,4)\n\nS[3] = old S[2] = (1,5)\n\nS[4] = old S[3] = (1,6)\n\nS[5] = old S[4] = (2,6)\n\nS[6] = old S[5] = (3,6)\n\nS[7] = old S[6] = (3,5)\n\nS[8] = old S[7] = (2,5)\n\nAnd old S[8] = (2,4) is not used, old S[9] = (3,4) is discarded. Since no food, length decreases to 9 segments.\n\nSo new positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] with head at (1,2), tail at (2,5).\n\nDirection is now D, since we moved down.\n\nIf I had moved right to (2,3), with food at (2,3), so I eat food, so length increases.\n\nOld positions same.\n\nMove R to (2,3), head to (2,3), then new S[1] = old S[0] = (1,3), S[2] = old S[1] = (1,4), ..., S[9] = old S[8] = (2,4), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so new segment at old tail position? No.\n\nWhen food eaten, the tail stays, so new positions: head at new cell, then each body segment moves to previous position, and the tail remains, so length increases by one.\n\nSo new positions: new head (2,3), then new S[1] = old S[0] (1,3), new S[2] = old S[1] (1,4), new S[3] = old S[2] (1,5), new S[4] = old S[3] (1,6), new S[5] = old S[4] (2,6), new S[6] = old S[5] (3,6), new S[7] = old S[6] (3,5), new S[8] = old S[7] (2,5), new S[9] = old S[8] (2,4), and new S[10] = old S[9] (3,4)? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, the head is at food, the body segments shift, but the last segment (tail) is not removed, so a new segment is added at the tail position, but since the tail didn't move, it stays, and the new position is the old tail position.\n\nPositions: after eating, the snake grows, so the tail position remains, and a new segment is there.\n\nIn the list: new head at (2,3), then the next segment at old head (1,3), then old S[1] (1,4), ..., up to old S[9] (3,4), and since food eaten, the old tail is not removed, so the new tail is at old S[9] (3,4), and there is a new segment at the position where the tail was before, but it's the same.\n\nLet's think: after move with food eaten, head at new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment closer to head, and the tail segment stays in place, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nFor example, old positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nAfter move to food: new head at food cell, then B1 at old H, B2 at old B1, ..., T at old second last, and new T at old T position? I'm confusing myself.\n\nBetter to think: the new head is at the new position. Then each subsequent segment takes the position of the previous segment in the old list.\n\nSo for segment i new, it is at old position of segment i-1 for i=1 to len, and for the new tail, it is at the old tail position since no move.\n\nSpecifically: new S[0] = new position (food cell)\n\nnew S[1] = old S[0]\n\nnew S[2] = old S[1]\n\n...\n\nnew S[k] = old S[k-1] for k from 1 to len\n\nnew S[len] = old S[len-1]? No.\n\nOld length L, positions S[0] to S[L-1]\n\nAfter move to new cell with food eaten:\n\nNew S[0] = new position\n\nNew S[1] = old S[0]\n\nNew S[2] = old S[1]\n\n...\n\nNew S[L] = old S[L-1]  // this is the new tail at the old tail position\n\nSo the snake has L+1 segments.\n\nIn this case, old L=10, positions 0 to 9.\n\nAfter move to (2,3) with food:\n\nNew S[0] = (2,3)  // head\n\nNew S[1] = old S[0] = (1,3)\n\nNew S[2] = old S[1] = (1,4)\n\nNew S[3] = old S[2] = (1,5)\n\nNew S[4] = old S[3] = (1,6)\n\nNew S[5] = old S[4] = (2,6)\n\nNew S[6] = old S[5] = (3,6)\n\nNew S[7] = old S[6] = (3,5)\n\nNew S[8] = old S[7] = (2,5)\n\nNew S[9] = old S[8] = (2,4)\n\nNew S[10] = old S[9] = (3,4)  // new tail\n\nSo now snake has 11 segments.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nAt turn 38, from (1,3) direction D, I can move:\n\n- D to (1,2): no food, new head (1,2), direction D, snake shortens to 9 segments.\n\n- R to (2,3): eat food, new head (2,3), direction R (since moved right), snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (2,1) life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 38, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 38+4-1=41? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at a given turn, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nIn the input, at turn t1=38, food at (2,1) has life span 4, so it will disappear at turn 38+4=42. Similarly, (2,3) life span 6, disappears at 38+6=44, (5,4) life span 9, disappears at 38+9=47.\n\nBut when we move, the turn increases.\n\nAlso, for food under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nBut here, food at (2,3) is not under body; head is at (1,3), and (2,3) is empty except for the food, so I can move directly to it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is free, I think.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options for turn 38.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 38: move D, to (1,2), no food eaten.\n\nNew state turn 39: head at (1,2), direction D, positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)\n\nFood: (2,1) life span now 3 (since turn 38 consumed, life span decreases), at turn 39, life span for (2,1) is 3? Original at turn 38: life span 4, after turn 38, it decreases, so at turn 39, life span is 3.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) was life span 6 at turn 38, at turn 39 it is 5, and (5,4) 8.\n\nBut (2,3) food is still there, but at (2,3), which might be occupied or not.\n\nIn new positions, at turn 39, cells occupied: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n(2,3) is not occupied, so food at (2,3) is still available.\n\nFrom (1,2) direction D, possible moves:\n\n- D to (1,1): not wall, not occupied? (1,1) is free, I think.\n\n- L to (0,2): x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R to (2,2): free? (2,2) not occupied, no wall.\n\n- U to (1,3): but (1,3) is occupied by body, and it's not tail, so collision. Also, instant reverse? Current direction D, U is opposite, so invalid.\n\nSo valid moves: D to (1,1), R to (2,2)\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), then I can reach (2,1) later? (2,1) has food with life span 3 at turn 39.\n\nFrom (1,1), I could go right to (2,1) or down to (1,0) wall, etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nOption 2 for turn 38: move R to (2,3), eat food.\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3), eat, score +1, snake grows.\n\nNew state turn 39: head at (2,3), direction R (since moved right), positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] tail at (3,4)\n\nFood: (2,1) life span 3 at turn 39, (5,4) life span 8, and (2,3) is eaten, gone.\n\nNow, from (2,3) direction R, possible moves:\n\n- R to (3,3): not wall, not occupied? (3,3) is free? Positions: (2,3) head, (1,3) body, (1,4), etc. (3,3) not in list, so free.\n\n- U to (2,4): but (2,4) is occupied by body? New positions: S[0]=(2,3), S[1]=(1,3), S[2]=(1,4), S[3]=(1,5), S[4]=(1,6), S[5]=(2,6), S[6]=(3,6), S[7]=(3,5), S[8]=(2,5), S[9]=(2,4), S[10]=(3,4)\n\nSo (2,4) is S[9], which is body, not tail. Tail is S[10]=(3,4)\n\nSo U to (2,4) would be collision with body.\n\n- D to (2,2): free? (2,2) not occupied.\n\n- L to (1,3): (1,3) is S[1], body, collision. Also, instant reverse? Current direction R, L is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo valid moves from (2,3) dir R: R to (3,3), D to (2,2)\n\nU and L invalid.\n\n(2,1) food is below, at (2,1).\n\nTo reach (2,1), from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), then from there to (2,1) or other.\n\nBut (2,1) has life span 3, so by turn 41 it disappears.\n\nTurn 39,40,41 it is there, gone at turn 42.\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n\nThere is also food at (5,4) with longer life span.\n\nBut let's see the grid layout.\n\nI should map the grid to see possible paths.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders, obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's list occupied cells at turn 38.\n\nFrom snake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo occupied: (1,3) to (1,6) vertical, then (2,6), (3,6) horizontal, then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) so kind of a loop or something.\n\n(1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6), then down to (3,5), left to (2,5), down? (2,5) to (2,4)? (2,5) is at (2,5), then (2,4), (3,4), so from (2,5) to (2,4) down? y=5 to y=4, down.\n\nCoordinates: y increases up? No, in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, D is (x,y-1), y decreases down.\n\nIn positions, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) so y=3,4,5,6, so moving up? Head at (1,3) direction D, but previous move must have been down to (1,3), but the body shows it was moving up before.\n\nAt turn 38, head at (1,3) dir D, so it just moved down to (1,3), but before that, it was at some position.\n\nFrom the positions, before head was at (1,4) or something, but let's not worry.\n\nCurrent: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) so body is north of head, so the snake was moving south to (1,3), but the body is to the north.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,4) is north, so the segment behind is north, so the snake is oriented south at head.\n\nBut for planning, I care about free cells.\n\nFree cells: for example, (2,3) has food, (2,2), (2,1) has food, (3,3), (3,2), (4,4), etc.\n\nFood at (5,4) which is far.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,4), which might move.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nIf I move down to (1,2) at turn 38, I go to the bottom left, which might be risky because borders.\n\nIf I move right to (2,3) and eat, I get score, but I'm near the body.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the move to (2,3) at turn 38.\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3), eat, score +1, new head (2,3) dir R.\n\nTurn 39: from (2,3) dir R, moves: R to (3,3) or D to (2,2)\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), then head at (3,3), dir R, then I can go to (4,3) etc, towards (5,4) food.\n\nOr D to (2,2), then to (2,1) to eat food.\n\n(2,1) food life span: at turn 39, life span 3, so it will disappear at turn 42. Turn 39,40,41 it is there.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) at turn 39, then from (2,2) I can go to (2,1) to eat or other.\n\nBut let's see the snake body.\n\nAfter turn 38 move to (2,3), positions at turn 39: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2) at turn 39, then head to (2,2), no food there, so tail removed, new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and tail at (2,4)? Old tail (3,4) removed, new segments: new head (2,2), new S[1] = old S[0] (2,3), new S[2] = old S[1] (1,3), new S[3] = old S[2] (1,4), ..., new S[10] = old S[9] (2,4), but since no food, old S[10] (3,4) removed, so new positions up to S[10]? Old length 11, after move no food, new length 10.\n\nOld at turn 39: 11 positions.\n\nAfter move to (2,2) no food: new head (2,2), new S[1] = old S[0] (2,3), new S[2] = old S[1] (1,3), new S[3] = old S[2] (1,4), new S[4] = old S[3] (1,5), new S[5] = old S[4] (1,6), new S[6] = old S[5] (2,6), new S[7] = old S[6] (3,6), new S[8] = old S[7] (3,5), new S[9] = old S[8] (2,5), new S[10] = old S[9] (2,4), and old S[10] (3,4) removed, so new positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] with tail at (2,5), 10 segments.\n\nThen from (2,2) dir D (since moved down), I can move to (2,1) to eat food.\n\n(2,1) has food, so at turn 40, move D to (2,1), eat, score +1, grow to 11 segments.\n\nThen head at (2,1), and so on.\n\nBut (2,1) is near border, y=1, close to y=0 wall.\n\nAfter eating, I need to move away.\n\nBut let's see the other choice.\n\nIf at turn 39 I move R to (3,3) instead.\n\nTurn 39 move R to (3,3), no food there, so snake shortens.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail at (2,4)? Old tail (3,4) removed.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) or down to (3,2), etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 38, if I move D to (1,2).\n\nTurn 38: move D to (1,2), no food.\n\nNew turn 39: head (1,2) dir D, positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)\n\nFood: (2,1) life span 3 at turn 39, (2,3) life span 5, (5,4) life span 8.\n\nFrom (1,2) dir D, moves: D to (1,1), or R to (2,2)\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), then to (1,0) wall, or right to (2,1), but (2,1) has food, so I can eat it at turn 40.\n\nTurn 39: move D to (1,1), no food, new positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) but tail: old tail (2,5), removed, new positions: new head (1,1), new S[1] = old S[0] (1,2), new S[2] = old S[1] (1,3), ..., new S[8] = old S[7] (3,5), new S[9] = old S[8] (2,5)? Old positions turn 39: 9 segments, after move no food, 8 segments.\n\nTurn 39 positions: 9 segments.\n\nAfter move to (1,1): new head (1,1), new S[1] = old S[0] (1,2), new S[2] = old S[1] (1,3), new S[3] = old S[2] (1,4), new S[4] = old S[3] (1,5), new S[5] = old S[4] (1,6), new S[6] = old S[5] (2,6), new S[7] = old S[6] (3,6), new S[8] = old S[7] (3,5), and old S[8] (2,5) removed, so new positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 40, from (1,1) dir D, I can move R to (2,1) to eat food, since (2,1) is free.\n\nMove R to (2,1), eat, score +1, grow.\n\nThen head at (2,1), etc.\n\nIf at turn 39 I move R to (2,2) instead of D.\n\nFrom (1,2) turn 39, move R to (2,2), no food, new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) tail at (2,5)? Similar calculation.\n\nThen I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) etc.\n\nBut (2,1) food can be eaten soon.\n\nNow, comparing the two options at turn 38:\n\n- If I move R to (2,3) at turn 38, I eat immediately, score +1, and I'm at (2,3) with direction R.\n\n- If I move D to (1,2), I don't eat, go to (1,2), and I can eat (2,1) later, but with risk of food disappearing or getting trapped.\n\n(2,1) has short life span, but I can reach it in 2 turns if I go directly.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat (2,1) within the life span.\n\nBut by moving to (2,3) first, I get an extra point now, and I can still go to (2,1) if I want.\n\nFrom (2,3) after eating, at turn 39 I can go down to (2,2), then to (2,1) at turn 40 to eat, so I get two points: one at turn 38 and one at turn 40.\n\nIf I go down first, at turn 38 move D to (1,2), then at turn 39 move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2), then at turn 40 I can eat (2,1), so I get one point at turn 40, missing the point at (2,3) which might disappear later, but (2,3) has life span 6, so it will be there for a while.\n\n(2,3) life span at turn 38 is 6, disappears at turn 44, so plenty of time.\n\nBut by not eating it now, I might not get it later if I go down.\n\nBut I can come back.\n\nHowever, the snake body might block the way.\n\nAfter moving down, the body is at (1,3) etc, so (2,3) is free, I can go to it from below or right.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) I can go to (2,2), then to (2,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut if I go to (1,1), I might be cornered.\n\nLet's think about the long-term food at (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has life span 9, disappears at turn 47.\n\nTo reach (5,4) from current position.\n\nHead at (1,3), (5,4) is 4 units right, 1 up, so Manhattan distance 5.\n\nI can go right and up.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,2), so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, via (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) or something.\n\nIf I move right to (2,3) and eat, I'm closer to (5,4).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (5,4) is 3 right, 1 up.\n\nIf I move down to (1,2), I'm farther.\n\nAlso, the body is in the left column, which might block the path if I go down.\n\nAnother risk: if I go down to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1) to eat, but after eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), and the body might be around, so I need to move up or right.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then previous head (1,1) or something, but it might be tight.\n\nLet's simulate both paths for 5 turns.\n\nFirst path: turn 38 move R to (2,3), eat, score+1\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2), no food (assume), so shorten.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail at (2,4) as before.\n\nDir now D.\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1), eat food at (2,1), score+1, grow.\n\nNew head (2,1), then new S[1] = old S[0] (2,2), new S[2] = old S[1] (2,3), new S[3] = old S[2] (1,3), ..., new S[10] = old S[9] (2,4), new S[11] = old S[10]? Old turn 39 positions had 10 segments? After turn 39 move to (2,2) no food, from 11 to 10 segments.\n\nAt turn 39, after move to (2,2): positions [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] tail (2,5)\n\nAt turn 40 move to (2,1) with food: new head (2,1), new S[1] = old S[0] (2,2), new S[2] = old S[1] (2,3), new S[3] = old S[2] (1,3), new S[4] = old S[3] (1,4), new S[5] = old S[4] (1,5), new S[6] = old S[5] (1,6), new S[7] = old S[6] (2,6), new S[8] = old S[7] (3,6), new S[9] = old S[8] (3,5), new S[10] = old S[9] (2,5), and new S[11] = old S[9] position? New S[10] = old S[9] (2,5), and since food eaten, new S[11] = old tail position, but old tail was (2,5), so new tail at (2,5).\n\nPositions: new S[0] = (2,1), S[1] = (2,2), S[2] = (2,3), S[3] = (1,3), S[4] = (1,4), S[5] = (1,5), S[6] = (1,6), S[7] = (2,6), S[8] = (3,6), S[9] = (3,5), S[10] = (2,5), and S[11] = (2,5)? No, S[10] = old S[9] (2,5), and new S[11] should be the new segment at the old tail position, which is (2,5), but S[10] is already (2,5), so it's duplicate? Mistake.\n\nStandard: when eating, the tail stays, so the position that was tail remains occupied.\n\nIn this case, old tail at (2,5), after move to (2,1) with food, new head (2,1), then each body segment moves to previous, so new S[1] = old S[0] (2,2), new S[2] = old S[1] (2,3), ..., new S[10] = old S[9] (2,5), and new S[11] = old S[10] but there was no old S[10], old had 10 segments, S[0] to S[9].\n\nOld positions: S[0]=(2,2), S[1]=(2,3), S[2]=(1,3), S[3]=(1,4), S[4]=(1,5), S[5]=(1,6), S[6]=(2,6), S[7]=(3,6), S[8]=(3,5), S[9]=(2,5)\n\nAfter move to (2,1) with food: new S[0] = (2,1)\nnew S[1] = old S[0] = (2,2)\nnew S[2] = old S[1] = (2,3)\nnew S[3] = old S[2] = (1,3)\nnew S[4] = old S[3] = (1,4)\nnew S[5] = old S[4] = (1,5)\nnew S[6] = old S[5] = (1,6)\nnew S[7] = old S[6] = (2,6)\nnew S[8] = old S[7] = (3,6)\nnew S[9] = old S[8] = (3,5)\nnew S[10] = old S[9] = (2,5)  // this is the new tail position\nand since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is (2,5), but it's already occupied by new S[10], so it's the same, no new position added separately; the tail position remains, so the snake has 11 segments with tail at (2,5).\n\nPositions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (2,5).\n\nNow, from (2,1) dir D (since moved down), I need to move to avoid walls.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; L to (1,1) may be occupied or not; R to (3,1); U to (2,2) but (2,2) is occupied by body.\n\nPositions: (2,2) is S[1], body, so U to (2,2) collision.\n\nL to (1,1): is (1,1) occupied? In positions, (1,3), (1,4), etc, (1,1) not listed, so free? But let's see: positions have (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), so (1,1) and (1,2) are free, but (1,2) not in list, so (1,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, R to (3,1) free.\n\nD to (2,0) wall.\n\nU to (2,2) occupied.\n\nSo valid moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1)\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then I'm at (1,1), and I can go up or right, but left is wall.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can go U to (1,2) or R to (2,1) but (2,1) is head, occupied now, or to (1,0) wall.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nMove R to (3,1) at turn 41, then to (4,1) etc, but (5,4) is up.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nIn the first path, I ate two foods, but now I'm at (2,1) with body around, limited moves.\n\nIf at turn 39 I moved R to (3,3) instead of D.\n\nTurn 38 move R to (2,3) eat.\n\nTurn 39 move R to (3,3) no food, shorten.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail at (2,4)\n\nDir R.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) or U to (3,4) or D to (3,2).\n\n(3,4) is tail? Tail at (2,4), not (3,4). (3,4) is free? In positions, S[10] was (3,4) at turn 39, but after move, new positions have (2,4) as tail, (3,4) is free.\n\nSo U to (3,4) possible, or D to (3,2), etc.\n\nThen I can go towards (5,4).\n\nFor example, turn 40 move to (4,3), then turn 41 to (4,4), turn 42 to (5,4) eat, etc.\n\nBut (2,1) food might expire.\n\nLife span, at turn 38, (2,1) life 4, disappears at turn 42, so at turn 41 it is there, turn 42 gone.\n\nIf I go to (5,4), I can eat at turn 42 if I move fast.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 39, move R to (4,3) turn 40, then U to (4,4) turn 41, then R to (5,4) turn 42 eat.\n\n(5,4) life span at turn 38 is 9, disappears at turn 47, so turn 42 is before, so ok.\n\nBut (2,1) is at turn 41 still there, but I'm not going there.\n\nSo I might miss (2,1).\n\nBut it's only +1, and I have (5,4) +1.\n\nBut let's consider the other option for turn 38.\n\nIf I move D to (1,2) at turn 38.\n\nTurn 38: move D to (1,2), no food.\n\nTurn 39: from (1,2) dir D, I can move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2)\n\nSuppose I move R to (2,2) to go towards food.\n\nTurn 39 move R to (2,2), no food, new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) tail at (2,5)\n\nDir R.\n\nThen turn 40: from (2,2) dir R, I can move R to (3,2), or U to (2,3), or D to (2,1)\n\n(2,3) has food, so I can move U to (2,3) to eat.\n\nMove U to (2,3), eat, score+1, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), and new tail at (2,5) or something.\n\nOld positions turn 39: 9 segments, after move with food, 10 segments.\n\nThen I have eaten (2,3) at turn 40.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (2,1) from here.\n\nBut (2,1) life span at turn 40 is 2, disappears at turn 42.\n\nAt turn 40, head at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), then to (2,1) at turn 41 to eat.\n\nTurn 40: after eating at (2,3), positions: let's not detail.\n\nHead at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) at turn 40, no food, then turn 41 move D to (2,1) eat if still there.\n\nAt turn 41, (2,1) life span 1, so it is there, turn 41 last turn, disappears at turn 42.\n\nSo I can eat it.\n\nThen I get two points: (2,3) at turn 40 and (2,1) at turn 41.\n\nSame as the first path where I ate at turn 38 and turn 40.\n\nIn first path, I ate at turn 38 and turn 40.\n\nIn this path, I ate at turn 40 and turn 41.\n\nSimilar score.\n\nBut in the first path, after eating at (2,1), I was at (2,1) with limited moves, but in this path, after eating at (2,1), I might be in a better position.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is moving, so the tail might free up space.\n\nFor long-term, moving towards (5,4) might be better.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), obstacle at (5,2), so I need to go above or below.\n\ny=4, (5,2) is below, so I can go directly to (5,4) from left or below.\n\nBut from current, if I go right early, I can reach it faster.\n\nFor example, if at turn 38 I move R to (2,3) eat, then at turn 39 move R to (3,3), then turn 40 to (4,3), turn 41 to (4,4), turn 42 to (5,4) eat.\n\nSo at turn 42 I eat (5,4).\n\nIf I go down first, it takes longer.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) at turn 39, if I move R to (2,2), then to (2,3) at turn 40, then I need to go to (3,3), etc, so slower to (5,4).\n\nBut I can go directly to right.\n\nBut with the body, it might be ok.\n\nPrioritize survival: going down to (1,2) might corner me near the wall.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), if I go to (1,1), then I have only two moves: U or R, and if body is above, I might be trapped.\n\nIn the positions after moving down, at turn 39, if head at (1,2), body at (1,3) above, so I can only go down or right, not up.\n\nIf I go down to (1,1), then at (1,1), I can go right to (2,1) or up to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, so only right to (2,1), then from (2,1) I can go right or up, but if I go up to (2,2), it might be free.\n\nBut it's risky if the body is around.\n\nWhereas if I go to (2,3) first, I'm more central.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,3) which I can eat immediately.\n\nMoreover, the tail is at (3,4), and if I move right, the tail might move, freeing space.\n\nI think moving right to eat (2,3) is better for immediate score and position.\n\nThen from there, I can decide to go down for (2,1) or right for (5,4).\n\n(2,1) has short life, so I should eat it soon.\n\nAt turn 39 from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), then turn 40 to (2,1) eat, as before.\n\nThen after that, I can go right to (3,1) or up, but up might be occupied.\n\nPositions after eating (2,1) at turn 40: head at (2,1), body as before, I can move R to (3,1) to escape the corner.\n\nThen from (3,1) I can go to (4,1), etc, towards (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,2), so I can go to (4,4) then to (5,4).\n\nOr directly.\n\nBut I have time, life span 9, so by turn 47.\n\nTurn 40, I can be at (3,1), then turn 41 to (4,1), turn 42 to (5,1), turn 43 to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) I can go up to (4,2), then to (4,3), (4,4), (5,4).\n\nOr from (3,1) to (3,2), but (3,2) might be free, then to (4,2), but (4,2) is above obstacle? Obstacle at (5,2), so (4,2) is free.\n\nThen to (4,3), (4,4), (5,4).\n\nSo possible.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,1), I can go directly to (5,4) and eat only that, but (2,1) is easy to get, so I should eat it.\n\nSimilarly, in both paths, I can get two foods soon.\n\nBut by moving right first, I get the point earlier.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions starting from turn t1=38 for a few turns, at least 5 ahead, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the output should be actions for turn 38, 39, 40, etc., until I have a plan.\n\nSince the state can change, I might output for 5 turns.\n\nBut let's decide turn 38 action.\n\nI think moving right to (2,3) to eat is better.\n\nThen for turn 39, I can move down to (2,2) to set up for (2,1).\n\nThen turn 40 move to (2,1) eat.\n\nThen for later, move right to (3,1) etc.\n\nBut let's confirm if (2,2) is safe at turn 39.\n\nAfter turn 38 move R to (2,3), positions at turn 39: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\n(2,2) is free, no problem.\n\nMove D to (2,2), no food, positions become [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)? As before.\n\nThen turn 40 move D to (2,1), eat, positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] head (2,1), tail (2,5)\n\nNow turn 40, head at (2,1) dir D, moves: L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U invalid (occupied), D invalid (wall).\n\nSo move R to (3,1) to go towards center.\n\nTurn 40 move R to (3,1), no food, so shorten.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail at (3,5)? Old tail (2,5) removed.\n\nDir now R.\n\nThen turn 41: from (3,1) dir R, moves: R to (4,1), U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) occupied.\n\nSo U to (3,2) or R to (4,1)\n\nI can go up to (3,2) to go towards (5,4).\n\nMove U to (3,2), no food, etc.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSince the food (2,1) will be gone after turn 41, and I ate it, good.\n\nFor (5,4), I can plan to go there later.\n\nBut for now, let's output actions for turn 38 to 42 or so.\n\nBut the state changes, so I should output based on current plan.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but the output is for the current turn sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output the actions for the next few turns assuming no surprises.\n\nBut in this case, all food is known.\n\nSo for turn 38, move R to eat (2,3)\n\nTurn 39, move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 40, move D to (2,1) eat\n\nThen turn 41, from (2,1) after move to (3,1), but at turn 40 after eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), I moved R to (3,1) at turn 40.\n\nAt turn 40, after moving to (2,1) and eating, it's the end of turn 40, head at (2,1).\n\nThen for turn 41, I move from (2,1) to (3,1), as above.\n\nThen turn 41 move to (3,1), no food.\n\nThen turn 42, from (3,1) I can move to (4,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,4), I need to go up.\n\nFor example, turn 42 move to (3,2), then turn 43 to (4,2), turn 44 to (4,3), turn 45 to (4,4), turn 46 to (5,4) eat.\n\nBut (5,4) life span 9 at turn 38, at turn 46 it is turn 46-38=8, life span 9, so still there, disappears at turn 47.\n\nTurn 46 eat.\n\nBut I can go faster if possible.\n\nFrom (3,1) turn 41, I can move R to (4,1), then turn 42 to (4,2), turn 43 to (4,3), turn 44 to (4,4), turn 45 to (5,4).\n\nSame.\n\nOr from (3,1) turn 41, move U to (3,2), then turn 42 to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied or not, but in general free.\n\nBut let's not specify further.\n\nFor the answer, I think moving right at turn 38 is good.\n\nBut I need to consider if there is any risk.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) is directly adjacent, and I can eat it safely.\n\nIf I don't eat it, it might be eaten later or not, but with body, it could be risky if not careful.\n\nBut I think eating it now is fine.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but head not adjacent to tail, so no issue.\n\nSo I think for turn 38, move R.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the output should be for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output:\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nThen for turn 41, it depends, but since I moved to (3,1), then from there.\n\nBut to be precise, let's define the actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 38, so up to turn 42 or 43.\n\nTurn 38: move R to (2,3) eat\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2) no eat\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1) eat\n\nNow turn 41: head at (2,1), direction D (from last move down), possible moves: L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U invalid, D invalid.\n\nI move R to (3,1) to avoid corner.\n\nTurn 41: move R to (3,1) no eat, direction R\n\nTurn 42: from (3,1) dir R, moves: R to (4,1), U to (3,2), D invalid.\n\nI can move U to (3,2) to go up towards (5,4), since (4,1) is down, might not be efficient.\n\nMove U to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 43: from (3,2) to (3,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can stop at turn 42.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 38: R\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nTurn 42: U  // to (3,2)\n\nBut at turn 42, from (3,1) to (3,2)\n\nNow, to write in boxed.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving down at turn 38 is better for some reason.\n\nSuppose turn 38 move D to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 39 move R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 40 move U to (2,3) eat\n\nTurn 41 move D to (2,2) but (2,2) might be occupied, or to (2,1) to eat if possible.\n\nAt turn 40 after eating at (2,3), head at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) at turn 40, then turn 41 to (2,1) eat.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut I ate later, at turn 40 and 41, vs first path at turn 38 and 40.\n\nSlightly later, but same points.\n\nPosition at turn 41 after eating (2,1) might be similar.\n\nBut in first path, I started eating earlier.\n\nAlso, by moving right first, I'm closer to (5,4).\n\nDistance: from (2,3) to (5,4) is |2-5| + |3-4| = 3+1=4 moves.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (5,4) is |1-5| + |2-4| = 4+2=6 moves, so farther.\n\nSo moving right is better.\n\nMoreover, there might be a risk with the body if I go down.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,2), then to (1,1), I have fewer options.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with moving right at turn 38.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering food life spans, collision risks, and movement constraints. The current state (turn 38) has the snake head at (1,3) with direction D (down). Available food includes positive food at (2,1) (life span 4, disappears at turn 42), (2,3) (life span 6, disappears at turn 44), and (5,4) (life span 9, disappears at turn 47). All food is +1 value, and there is no negative food.\n\n### Key Considerations for Planning:\n- **Immediate Opportunity**: Food at (2,3) is directly reachable in one move (right) and can be eaten safely at turn 38 for +1 score and growth. Not eating it risks missing it later due to body blockages or life span expiration.\n- **Short-Life Food**: Food at (2,1) has a short life span (expires at turn 42) and must be eaten soon. A path to (2,1) via (2,2) is safe and efficient.\n- **Long-Term Food**: Food at (5,4) has a longer life span (expires at turn 47) and can be targeted after securing nearer food. The obstacle at (5,2) requires moving via (4,4) to avoid it.\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - Moving down to (1,2) at turn 38 risks cornering the snake near the wall (y=0) with limited escape routes, especially as the body occupies the left column.\n  - Moving right to (2,3) is safe, as the head is not adjacent to the tail, avoiding tail reward danger. Subsequent moves to (2,2) and (2,1) are collision-free.\n- **Survival Priority**: After eating (2,1), moving right to (3,1) at turn 41 avoids the bottom-left corner and opens a path toward (5,4) for future scoring. The grid has ample space on the right side for maneuvering.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: The plan secures two food items (at (2,3) and (2,1)) by turn 40, then positions the snake to reach (5,4) efficiently. Actions are chosen to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions while adhering to movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 38-42):\n- **Turn 38 (current)**: Move R (right) to (2,3) to eat the food immediately (+1 score, snake grows to 11 segments). This leverages the opportunity and improves positioning for accessing (2,1) and (5,4). Valid moves from (1,3) with direction D are R or D; R is chosen for scoring and central positioning.\n- **Turn 39**: Move D (down) to (2,2). No food here, so snake shortens to 10 segments. This sets up for eating (2,1) next turn. Valid moves from (2,3) with direction R are R or D; D is chosen to target (2,1) before expiration.\n- **Turn 40**: Move D (down) to (2,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows to 11 segments). (2,1) expires at turn 42, so this ensures it is eaten safely. Valid moves from (2,2) with direction D are D or others; D is chosen for direct path.\n- **Turn 41**: Move R (right) to (3,1). No food here, so snake shortens to 10 segments. This escapes the bottom-left corner and starts moving toward (5,4). Valid moves from (2,1) with direction D are L or R; R is chosen to avoid the wall and body, improving mobility.\n- **Turn 42**: Move U (up) to (3,2). No food here, so snake shortens to 9 segments. This continues the path toward (5,4) by ascending the grid. Valid moves from (3,1) with direction R are R or U; U is chosen to avoid the obstacle at (5,2) and align with the route to (5,4) via (3,3), (4,3), (4,4).\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats two food items by turn 40 (turns 38 and 40), gaining +2 score, and positions for a third at (5,4) by turn 45-46.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Avoids corners and body collisions. Moving to (1,2) at turn 38 was rejected due to corner risk and missing (2,3).\n- **Life Span Management**: Eats (2,1) just before expiration (turn 40 vs. turn 42) and (2,3) immediately. (5,4) is reachable by turn 46 with its life span.\n- **Efficiency**: Path to (5,4) is optimized: after turn 42, continue to (3,3) turn 43, (4,3) turn 44, (4,4) turn 45, (5,4) turn 46 for eating.\n\nThis plan prioritizes survival by maintaining open space and avoiding traps, while maximizing score through timely food consumption.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 39: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 40: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 41: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 42: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t=39. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,3), then body segments: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So the tail is at (3,4). The snake has 11 segments.\n\nHead direction is right (R), so it's moving to the east.\n\nFood:\n- At (2,1) with value 1 and life span 3. This means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So at turn 39, life span 3, so it will be gone by turn 42? Let's clarify life span: it decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the start of turn t + N? Or after turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + L. For example, at turn t, countdown L; after turn t, countdown L-1; ... after turn t + L - 1, countdown 1; then after that turn, it disappears, so not available at turn t + L.\n\nBut for movement, we consider the state at the beginning of the turn, before moving. So when we say \"disappears after N turns\", it might mean after N turns from now, so at turn t + N it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, for eating, when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it at that turn.\n\nFor food at (2,1) at turn 39, life span 3: so after 3 turns, it disappears. After turn 39, countdown 2; after turn 40, countdown 1; after turn 41, countdown 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 42. So it can be eaten on turns 39, 40, or 41.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,4) with life span 8: disappears after 8 turns, so available until turn 46 inclusive? Turn 39: life span 8, after turn 39: 7, ..., after turn 46: 0, disappears at turn 47. So available from turn 39 to 46.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 39. The answer should be for turns 39, 40, etc., but how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 moves, but the format might expect a sequence for several turns.\n\nThe answer format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I should provide a sequence based on my plan, but since the state changes, I might need to re-plan after each move, but for now, I have to output a fixed sequence for the current state.\n\nI should simulate multiple steps ahead to make good decisions.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls occupy x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (5,2) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (2,3)\n\nBody: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nTail is (3,4)\n\nNow, head at (2,3), moving right, so from (2,3), moving right would go to (3,3)? But let's see the positions: (2,3) is head, then next is (1,3), which is left of head? Head at (2,3), direction right, so it was moving right to (2,3) from previous position.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), ...] so from (2,3) to (1,3) is left, but head direction is R? That seems inconsistent.\n\nIf head is at (2,3) and direction is R, that means it moved right to (2,3) on the previous turn. But the previous position should be the first body segment. Positions: index 0: head (2,3), index 1: (1,3), which is left of head, so if head moved to (2,3) from left, that would be from (1,3) to (2,3), which is moving right, so direction is R, correct.\n\nThen body: (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,4) to (3,4)\n\n(2,4) is listed, and (3,4) is tail.\n\nNow, grid: let's sketch for clarity.\n\ny=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) are occupied. (1,6) is part of body, (2,6) and (3,6) too.\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\n- (2,3) head\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4) tail\n\nSo the snake occupies: (1,3) to (1,6) vertically, then (2,6), (3,6), down to (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), and (3,4), with head at (2,3).\n\nNow, food at (2,1) and (5,4).\n\n(2,1) is below (2,3), since y=1 is down if we assume y increases up or down? In coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nIn snake positions, (1,3) to (1,6), and (1,6) has higher y, so y=6 is top, y=1 is bottom? Let's see: positions like (1,6), (1,5), etc., so y=6 is high, so probably y increases upward.\n\nIn movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n\nSo (2,1) is at x=2, y=1, which is below (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is at x=5, y=4.\n\nNow, head at (2,3), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite, and no instant reverse.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nSo possible moves from (2,3): U (up to (2,4)), D (down to (2,2)), R (right to (3,3)).\n\nNow, check if these are valid.\n\nFirst, (2,4): is it occupied? From positions, (2,4) is a body segment? Snake positions include (2,4), yes, it's the 10th segment? Positions: index 0: (2,3) head, index 1: (1,3), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,5), index 4: (1,6), index 5: (2,6), index 6: (3,6), index 7: (3,5), index 8: (2,5), index 9: (2,4), index 10: (3,4) tail.\n\n(2,4) is occupied by the snake body, so moving to (2,4) would cause collision, since head touches body segment.\n\nBut there's a rule: you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away, but only if it's the tail.\n\nHere, (2,4) is not the tail; tail is (3,4). (2,4) is a body segment, so if head moves to (2,4), it collides with the body, so death.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (2,4) is invalid.\n\nNow, moving D to (2,2): (2,2) is not in the snake positions, so it might be free, but we need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (2,2) is within x=1-6, y=1-6, and not (5,2), so it should be free.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is different.\n\nSo (2,2) is empty.\n\nMoving R to (3,3): (3,3) is not in snake positions? Positions: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), but not (3,3), so should be free.\n\nAlso, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3). U is invalid because (2,4) occupied.\n\nNow, also, food: (2,1) is at (2,1), which is below (2,2), so if I move D to (2,2), I'm one step away from food.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is to the right and up.\n\nBut I need to think multiple steps.\n\nAlso, life span: food at (2,1) has life span 3 at turn 39, so it can be eaten on turn 39,40,41. If I move to (2,2) on turn 39, then on turn 40 I could move down to (2,1) to eat it.\n\nBut I have to consider if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's list all free cells.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacle (5,2) and snake occupied.\n\nSnake occupied: as above.\n\nFree cells: all except snake and walls and obstacle.\n\nSpecifically, for movement from (2,3), possible: (2,2) down, (3,3) right.\n\n(2,4) up is occupied.\n\nNow, if I move right to (3,3), what then?\n\nOr down to (2,2).\n\nNow, food at (2,1): if I go down, I can reach it in two moves: turn 39 down to (2,2), turn 40 down to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so length increases by one.\n\nAlso, need to check if eating it is safe.\n\n(2,1) is food, positive, value +1.\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to head or to (2,1).\n\nHead at (2,3), tail at (3,4), which are adjacent? (2,3) and (3,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(2,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,1) has short life, only 3 turns left, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) has longer life.\n\nBut I should prioritize based on risk and reward.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid layout.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the left side, with a sort of loop.\n\nFrom head (2,3), if I move down to (2,2), then to (2,1) to eat.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), snake grows, so new head at (2,1), body includes previous head and all, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move that turn? When you eat, the snake grows, so after moving to food, head is on food, it eats, so the tail stays in place, meaning the snake length increases by one, but the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food, eats it, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Otherwise, when not eating, head moves, tail moves, length same.\n\nHere, when eating positive food, length +1, so tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,1) and eat, head is at (2,1), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, but the segment before tail becomes new tail? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: head at (2,3), tail at (3,4).\n\nAfter move down to (2,2): if no eat, head to (2,2), tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the one ahead.\n\nSo if not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so tail moves away.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food, eats it, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell, with the tail staying.\n\nIn terms of positions, after eating, the tail position remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nBut in the sequence, the positions list grows.\n\nFor example, suppose before move: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving without eating: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T_prev] but T is removed, so [new_head, old_head, B1, ..., up to second last].\n\nAfter moving and eating: new positions [new_head, old_head, B1, B2, ..., T], so tail T stays, length increased.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,1) on turn 40 and eat, then new head at (2,1), and tail still at (3,4) for that turn.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 39.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move D to (2,2)\n\n- Move R to (3,3)\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), on turn 39.\n\nThen, at turn 39, after move, head at (2,2), and since I didn't eat (no food at (2,2)), so tail moves. Tail was at (3,4), and it moves to (2,4)? Positions before move: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,4), (3,4)\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2): head to (2,2), then the body: the first body segment moves to head's old position (2,3), then (1,3) to (1,3)? Let's sequence.\n\nPositions before turn 39 move: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2), no eat, so new head (2,2), then the segments: (2,3) becomes new body part, then (1,3), (1,4), ..., but the tail (3,4) is removed, so the second last (2,4) becomes new tail? Let's index.\n\nIndex 0: (2,3) head\n\n1: (1,3)\n\n2: (1,4)\n\n3: (1,5)\n\n4: (1,6)\n\n5: (2,6)\n\n6: (3,6)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (2,4)\n\n10: (3,4) tail\n\nAfter move down to (2,2), no eat, so new positions: head at (2,2), then body: the old head position becomes new segment 1: (2,3), then segment 1 becomes segment 2: (1,3), segment 2 to 3: (1,4), ..., up to segment 9 to 10: (2,4), and segment 10 (tail) is removed, so the last segment is now (2,4), which was index 9.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]  so tail at (2,4)\n\nAnd head direction: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) still there, life span now 2 (since turn 39 passed, but after move, turn 39 is done? Turn 39 action: I move, then after move, if I eat, etc.\n\nAt the start of turn 39, I decide action. After action, the move happens, and if head moves to food, it eats, and life span decreases for all food.\n\nAlso, for food, life span decreases every turn, including when I move.\n\nAt turn 39, before move, food at (2,1) has life span 3.\n\nAfter I move, if I go to (2,2), no eat, so at end of turn 39, life span of that food decreases to 2.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nIf I had moved to (2,1) directly, but I can't, because from (2,3), I can only go to (2,2) or (3,3), not directly to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is down, but not adjacent directly from (2,3)? (2,3) to (2,2) is down, then to (2,1) is down again.\n\nSo on turn 39, if I move D to (2,2), then on turn 40, I can move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nOn turn 40, from (2,2), I can move to (2,1) down.\n\n(2,1) is not wall, and not occupied at that time, probably.\n\nAfter turn 39 move, positions as above, so (2,1) is free.\n\nAlso, when I move to (2,1) on turn 40, I eat it, so snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), and tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (2,1), then (2,2) from previous head, then (2,3), (1,3), etc., up to tail (2,4) from before.\n\nBefore turn 40 move: positions at start of turn 40: [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] with head at (2,2), direction down.\n\nMove down to (2,1): (2,1) has food, so eat, positive food, length increases.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,1), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so body: old head (2,2) becomes segment 1, then (2,3), (1,3), ..., (2,5), and tail (2,4) stays, so positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] so tail at (2,4), and new segment added, so snake longer.\n\nNow, head at (2,1), which is near the bottom wall.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,1), I can move U (up to (2,2)), but (2,2) is now occupied by the body? In the new positions, (2,2) is the first body segment, so moving to (2,2) would collide.\n\nMove L to (1,1), or R to (3,1), or D, but y=1, down to (2,0) is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo from (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1), R to (3,1), but not U or D.\n\nD is wall, U is to (2,2) which is body, so collision.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\n(1,1) and (3,1) should be free, assuming no other issues.\n\n(1,1): is it wall? x=1,y=1, not border, not obstacle, and not in snake positions above, so free.\n\nSimilarly (3,1).\n\nSo I can go left or right.\n\nBut if I go to (1,1), then I might be cornered, or to (3,1).\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nFirst, back to turn 39 choice.\n\nIf I move right to (3,3) on turn 39.\n\nFrom (2,3) move R to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free, no food, so no eat.\n\nAfter move: new head (3,3), then body: old head (2,3) to segment 1, then (1,3) to segment 2, etc., tail moves from (3,4) to (2,4)? Positions before: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nAfter move R to (3,3), no eat: new positions [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\nHead at (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 40, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), but L is left, opposite to current R? Current direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite), so only U, D, R.\n\nR to (4,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2).\n\nNow, (3,4): is it occupied? In positions, (3,4) was tail, but after move, tail is at (2,4), so (3,4) is free? In new positions, cells occupied: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo (3,4) is not occupied, so U to (3,4) is possible.\n\nD to (3,2): free? (3,2) not in list, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nR to (4,3): free? (4,3) not in positions, should be free.\n\nSo all possible.\n\nBut I have food at (2,1) with short life, if I go right, I might not get to it in time.\n\nLife span: at turn 39, food (2,1) has life span 3, so after turn 39, it decreases to 2, so available on turn 40 and 41.\n\nIf I move right on turn 39 to (3,3), then on turn 40, I can go to (3,2) down, then on turn 41 to (3,1), but (2,1) is at (2,1), not (3,1), so I need to go left from (3,1) to (2,1) on turn 42, but by turn 42, food disappears, so on turn 41, if I'm at (3,1), I can move to (2,1) on turn 41 if it's still there.\n\nTurn 41: food life span, at start of turn 41, after decreases from turn 40, life span 1, so if I move to it on turn 41, I can eat it, then after that it disappears.\n\nSo possible to get it by turn 41.\n\nBut from (3,3) on turn 40, I could go down to (3,2), then turn 41 to (3,1), but (3,1) to (2,1) is left, but on turn 41, from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 40, from (3,3), I could also go directly to (2,3)? But (2,3) is occupied by body, as in positions, (2,3) is segment 1, so cannot move to (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), moving L to (2,3) is invalid, collision.\n\nSo only way to (2,1) is via (3,2) and (3,1), then to (2,1).\n\nBut from (3,1) to (2,1) on turn 41.\n\nBut on turn 41, food at (2,1) has life span 1, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 39, if I move R to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 40, from (3,3), I need to go to (2,1) in two moves? Not possible directly.\n\nI can move D to (3,2) on turn 40.\n\nThen at (3,2), on turn 41, move L to (2,2)? (2,2) may or may not be free.\n\nAfter turn 39 move to (3,3), positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nOn turn 40, I move to (3,2), for example.\n\nThen after move to (3,2), no food, so new positions: head to (3,2), then (3,3) to body, then (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail moves from (2,4) to (2,5)? Let's see: old tail (2,4) removed, new tail is (2,5).\n\nPositions: [ (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nNow, (2,2) is free, I think.\n\nThen on turn 41, from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), since (2,2) is free.\n\nThen at (2,2), no food, so move to (2,2).\n\nThen positions: head to (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), etc., tail moves to (3,5) or something.\n\nBut I need to get to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), on turn 42, I can move D to (2,1), but on turn 42, food at (2,1) has life span: at turn 39 start, life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 39, life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 40, life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 41, life span 0, so it disappears at start of turn 42, so on turn 42, it's gone, cannot eat.\n\nSo to eat (2,1), I must be on (2,1) by turn 41 at the latest.\n\nOn turn 41, I need to move to (2,1).\n\nBut from above, on turn 41, if I'm at (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,1) or (4,2), etc., but not directly to (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or to (3,1).\n\nIf I move to (3,1) on turn 41, then I can move to (2,1) on turn 41? On turn 41, from (3,2), I move to (3,1), then at (3,1), I am not at (2,1), so on turn 41, I can't reach (2,1) from (3,2) in one move; I can only go to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (3,2), adjacent to (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3) but (3,3) occupied.\n\n(2,1) is not adjacent to (3,2); it's diagonal.\n\nSo to reach (2,1) on turn 41, I need to be at (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1) or (2,0) but (2,0) wall, so from (2,2), (1,1), or (3,1).\n\nOn turn 41, if I am at one of those, I can move to (2,1).\n\nBut from the path, if I went right on turn 39, by turn 41, I can be at (3,1) if I moved down twice, but on turn 40 from (3,3) to (3,2), then turn 41 from (3,2) to (3,1), so at (3,1) on turn 41.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) on turn 41 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone down on turn 39, I could be at (2,2) on turn 40, then to (2,1) on turn 41.\n\nBut with the right move, I can still reach it on turn 41.\n\nHowever, with the down move on turn 39, I can eat on turn 40, which is earlier, but since the score is the same, it might not matter, but for risk, going down might be safer for getting the food.\n\nBut let's consider the other food and the board state.\n\nAlso, there is a risk at (2,1): after eating, head at (2,1), which has only two moves: L or R, as U is body and D is wall.\n\nSo I might get stuck or have limited options.\n\nMoreover, the tail is at (2,4) or something, so I need to find a path out.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), if I go L to (1,1), then I can go U to (1,2), etc., but let's see the area.\n\nThe left side has many body segments.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail.\n\nSo cells like (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) head, (2,2) body, so (1,1) is free, (1,2) might be free? Not in positions, so (1,2) free.\n\n(3,1) free, (3,2) free, etc.\n\nFrom (2,1), move L to (1,1), then from (1,1), I can move U to (1,2), then to (1,3)? But (1,3) is body, occupied.\n\nFrom (1,1), moves: U to (1,2), R to (2,1) but occupied, D wall, L wall if x=0, but x=1, L to (0,1) wall, so only U to (1,2).\n\nThen at (1,2), moves: U to (1,3), but (1,3) is body, occupied; D to (1,1) occupied; R to (2,2) occupied; L wall. So trapped! Only move to (1,2) from (1,1), but at (1,2), all adjacent are occupied or wall: U (1,3) body, D (1,1) just left, but occupied, R (2,2) body, L wall. So no move, death.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,1) I move R to (3,1), then from (3,1), moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1) occupied, R to (4,1), D wall.\n\n(3,2) is free, so U to (3,2).\n\nThen at (3,2), moves: U to (3,3), but (3,3) may be occupied or not; in the positions after eating, (3,3) is not occupied, but let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1) on turn 40, positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] so (3,3) not occupied, (3,2) not, etc.\n\nFrom (3,1), move U to (3,2), then at (3,2), moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2) occupied, R to (4,2), D to (3,1) occupied.\n\nSo U or R.\n\n(3,3) free, so U to (3,3), then I can continue.\n\nBut from (2,1) moving R to (3,1) is safe, while moving L to (1,1) is death.\n\nSo if I go down to eat the food, I must move right after to (3,1) to avoid death.\n\nBut it's risky if I make a wrong move.\n\nWith the right move on turn 39, I don't go for the food immediately, but I can still get it later with less risk? Not necessarily.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,1) might be under the body or something? But in this case, it's not, it's free.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but here (2,1) is not under body, it's free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, the other food at (5,4) with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is currently in a position where it might be looping or something.\n\nLet's list all free cells to see available space.\n\nGrid: 6x6 minus obstacle and snake.\n\nObstacle: (5,2)\n\nSnake occupies 11 cells.\n\nTotal cells: 36, minus 1 obstacle, 35 available, snake 11, so 24 free, but some may be inaccessible.\n\nBut let's not count, but see the area.\n\nThe right side is more open.\n\nFor example, cells like (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,4) food, (5,5), (5,6), (6,3), (6,4), etc., are free.\n\nLeft side has snake body.\n\nSo for long-term, I should move right to explore the open area.\n\nBut the food at (2,1) is about to disappear, so I might want to eat it if possible.\n\nBut with the risk of getting stuck if I go down.\n\nIf I move down on turn 39 to (2,2), then on turn 40 to (2,1) eat, then on turn 41, from (2,1), I must move R to (3,1) to avoid death.\n\nThen at (3,1), move U to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be free at that time.\n\nLet's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, option 1: move D on turn 39 to (2,2)\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2), no eat. New positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nFood at (2,1) life span now 2 (after turn 39).\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1), eat food. New positions: since ate, tail doesn't move, so [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D.\n\nFood life span: (2,1) eaten, so removed. (5,4) life span 7 now? At turn 40 start, after decrease.\n\nTurn 41: from (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U to (2,2) but occupied, D wall.\n\nL or R.\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), safe.\n\nMove to (3,1), no food there, so new positions: head to (3,1), then body: old head (2,1) to segment 1, then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail moves from (2,4) to (2,5)? Positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R (since moved right from (2,1)).\n\nThen from (3,1), can move U to (3,2), R to (4,1), or D wall, L to (2,1) occupied.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nSay move U to (3,2) on turn 41.\n\nThen at (3,2), no food, positions: head to (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), etc., tail moves to (3,5) or something. New tail is (3,5)? From above, after move, [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen I can continue to open area.\n\nBut the tail is moving, so space freeing up.\n\nNow, option 2: move R on turn 39 to (3,3)\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,3), no eat. Positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 40: from (3,3), move D to (3,2) for example, to go towards food.\n\nMove to (3,2), no food, positions: [ (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 41: from (3,2), move L to (2,2)? (2,2) is free, yes.\n\nMove to (2,2), no food, positions: head to (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail moves to (3,5) or (2,5) removed, new tail (3,5).\n\nPositions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nBut I wanted to go to (2,1) to eat on turn 41.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 41, I can move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\n(2,1) has food, life span at turn 41 start: after turn 40, life span 1, so I can eat it.\n\nMove to (2,1), eat, so new positions: head to (2,1), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen same as before, on turn 42, I must move L or R, say R to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut in this case, I still end up at (2,1) but later, and I ate the food.\n\nHowever, in the first option, I ate on turn 40, here on turn 41.\n\nBut the food is the same.\n\nBut in terms of risk, in the first option, when I moved down on turn 39, after moving to (2,2), the position (2,2) was free, but in the second option, when I move to (2,2) on turn 41, it might be free or not, but in this simulation it was free.\n\nBut there is a difference: in the first option, by eating on turn 40, the snake grew earlier, and the tail didn't move on turn 40, so the body is different.\n\nIn the second option, when I eat on turn 41, the body has moved, so the occupied cells are different.\n\nFor example, in the first case, after eating at (2,1), tail is at (2,4), while in the second case, tail is at (3,5), so more space in the bottom.\n\nBut head is at (2,1) in both, so from there, moving right to (3,1) is similar.\n\nBut in the second case, when I move to (2,2) on turn 41, (2,2) was free, but let's see if it's always free.\n\nIn the first path, after turn 39 move to (2,2), (2,2) is head, so on turn 40 I move to (2,1).\n\nIn the second path, on turn 41, I move to (2,2) from (3,2), and (2,2) was free at that time.\n\nBut in the positions, after turn 40 in second path, positions have (3,2), (3,3), etc., not (2,2), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free.\n\nSo both ways I can eat the food.\n\nBut with the down move on turn 39, I get the food one turn earlier, but that might not be crucial.\n\nNow, for long-term, moving right on turn 39 might be better to access the open area.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (5,4) which I can go for later.\n\nMoreover, the internal obstacle at (5,2) might block some paths.\n\nBut let's think about the head being adjacent to tail.\n\nFor example, in the current state, head at (2,3), tail at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nBut after some moves, it might be.\n\nBut for now, not an issue.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills. But here, no food on tail.\n\nFood at (2,1) and (5,4), not on tail.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, to prioritize long-term survival, I should avoid going to the bottom where space is limited.\n\nIf I go down to eat (2,1), I end up at (2,1) with few moves, and I have to move to (3,1), then up, but the left area is crowded with body.\n\nIf I move right, I can go to (5,4) for the other food, which is in a more open area.\n\nAlso, (2,1) has short life, but I can still get it from the right path as above.\n\nBut let's see the life span: at turn 39, I can choose.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (2,1) at all, to avoid the risk, since it's not worth it for +1 if I might die.\n\nBut in both paths, I can eat it safely if I move correctly.\n\nIn the down path, I must move right after eating to avoid death, which is fine.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, with move D on turn 39:\n\nTurn 39: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (2,1) eat\n\nTurn 41: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 42: move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 43: move U to (3,3) or R to (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 42, I can go to (3,3), (4,2), or (3,1) but occupied.\n\n(3,3) may be free or not; in the positions, after turn 41 move to (3,1), positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nThen turn 42 move U to (3,2): no food, positions: head to (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), etc., tail moves to (3,5)? New tail (3,5)\n\nPositions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen at (3,2), turn 43 move U to (3,3): (3,3) free, so move, no food, positions: head to (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), etc., tail moves to (3,6)\n\n[ (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ] tail at (3,6)\n\nThen I can move to (4,3) or something to go right.\n\nBut the body is still on the left.\n\nNow, with move R on turn 39:\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,2)  # to go down for food\n\nTurn 41: move L to (2,2)  # to go to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 42: move D to (2,1) eat? On turn 41 I am at (2,2), move to (2,1) on turn 42? But on turn 42, food at (2,1) is gone.\n\nTurn 41: at (2,2), I move to (2,1) to eat, but on turn 41, food life span 1, so I can eat on turn 41.\n\nIn turn 41 move to (2,1) from (2,2).\n\nThen positions after eating: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail (3,6) or something.\n\nFrom turn 40 positions: after turn 40, at (3,2), positions [ (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nTurn 41 move to (2,2): (2,2) is free, move to it, no eat yet, so new positions: head to (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), etc., tail moves to (2,5) removed, new tail (3,5)\n\nPositions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nBut I moved to (2,2), which has no food, so not eating.\n\nThen to eat (2,1), I need to move down to (2,1) on turn 42, but on turn 42, food is gone.\n\nTurn 42 start, food at (2,1) life span 0, disappeared.\n\nSo I cannot eat it if I go this way on turn 41 to (2,2).\n\nOn turn 41, from (3,2), I should move to (3,1) instead of (2,2), then to (2,1) on turn 41.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 41, move to (3,1), no food, positions: head to (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), etc., tail moves to (3,6) or something.\n\nPositions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen on turn 42, from (3,1), move L to (2,1), but (2,1) has no food now, and it's empty, so I can move to it but not eat.\n\nBut food is gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 41, I must be on a cell adjacent to (2,1) on turn 41 and move to it.\n\nOn turn 41, if I am at (2,2), I can move to (2,1) to eat.\n\nIf I am at (3,1), I can move to (2,1) to eat.\n\nIf I am at (1,1), move to (2,1).\n\nBut in the right path, on turn 41, I can be at (3,1) or (2,2).\n\nFor example, on turn 40, from (3,3), I can move to (3,2) as before, then on turn 41 from (3,2) move to (3,1) or to (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (2,2) on turn 41, I can then move to (2,1) on turn 41 to eat.\n\nBut on turn 41, from (2,2), move to (2,1) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the right path:\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,2)  # or to (3,2)\n\nTurn 41: move to (2,2)  # but from (3,2) to (2,2) is left, and current direction after turn 40 move to (3,2) is D, so from (3,2), moving L to (2,2) is left, which is not opposite to D (down), so allowed. Opposite to down is up, so left is fine.\n\nMove to (2,2), then at (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) to eat on turn 41.\n\nAfter move to (2,2) on turn 41, no eat yet, so positions: head to (2,2), then body: old head position (3,2) to segment 1, then (3,3), (2,3), etc., tail moves to (3,5) or something.\n\nFrom turn 40 positions: at (3,2), positions [ (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (2,2) on turn 41, no eat, so new positions: head to (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] and tail (2,5) removed, so new tail (3,5)\n\nPositions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nNow, at (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) to eat on the same turn? No, on turn 41, I am at (2,2), and I move to (2,1) for turn 41 action? The action is for the turn, so on turn 41, I move from current position to new position.\n\nAt start of turn 41, I am at (2,2), and I choose to move to (2,1), which has food, so I eat it.\n\nThen after move, new positions: head to (2,1), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so body: old head (2,2) becomes segment 1, then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), etc., and tail (3,5) stays, so positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in this case, I ate the food on turn 41 with the right move.\n\nCompared to down move, I ate on turn 40.\n\nBut for long-term, after eating, the snake is at (2,1) with the body above, so I have to move right to (3,1), then up.\n\nWhereas if I don't go for this food, I can stay in the open area.\n\nBut since both ways I can eat it, and the score is the same, perhaps it's better to eat it to increase length for future, but survival is priority.\n\nBut +1 score is good.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,1) might be risky because of the location.\n\nBut in this case, I think I can manage.\n\nHowever, let's consider the other food at (5,4).\n\nIf I move right on turn 39, I can head towards (5,4).\n\nFor example, turn 39 move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 40 move R to (4,3) or U to (3,4), etc.\n\n(3,4) is free, for example.\n\nMove to (4,3) on turn 40.\n\nThen I can go to (5,4) soon.\n\nFood at (5,4) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut the short-life food (2,1) will disappear soon, so if I don't eat it, I lose the opportunity.\n\nSince it's positive food, I should eat it if possible without high risk.\n\nIn both paths, the risk is similar, but in the down path, I get it earlier and have to deal with the bottom, while in the right path, I get it later but from a better position.\n\nBut in the right path, when I go to (2,2) on turn 41, (2,2) might be occupied if the tail is there, but in the simulation, it was free.\n\nTo avoid risk, perhaps I should not go for it and focus on the open area.\n\nBut let's see the board: the snake has a loop, and after moving, the tail will move, freeing space.\n\nFor example, in current state, tail at (3,4), after moves, it moves.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,4) is valuable.\n\nBut I think for long-term, moving right is better.\n\nMoreover, there might be a risk with the food at (2,1): if I eat it, I grow, and at (2,1), it might be tight.\n\nBut I can escape.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go for both foods.\n\nBut (2,1) is south-west, (5,4) is north-east.\n\nSo I need to choose.\n\nSince the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", and moving down might lead to a risky position, I should move right to stay in open area.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,1) has only 3 life, so if I don't go for it, it disappears, but I can survive without it.\n\nBut score is less, but survival first.\n\nI think I can eat it safely with either move.\n\nLet's decide.\n\nI think moving right on turn 39 is better for long-term.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (5,4).\n\nSo for turn 39, move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 40, from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) to go right, or U to (3,4), or D to (3,2).\n\nBut to avoid the bottom for now, move to (4,3).\n\nThen from there to (5,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,2), so (5,3) is free.\n\nLet's not plan all, but for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nThe format says to provide actions for multiple turns, but it might be based on current state.\n\nPerhaps I should provide 5 turns or so.\n\nBut since the state changes, I can output for turn 39 only, but the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, so perhaps I can do for 5 turns.\n\nLet's simulate from move right.\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 40: from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3) to go towards (5,4)\n\nMove R to (4,3), no food, new positions: head to (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail moves.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 41: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) or U to (4,4), etc.\n\n(5,3) is free, not wall, not obstacle (5,2 is obstacle, but (5,3) ok).\n\nMove to (5,3), no food.\n\nThen turn 42: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) to eat the food at (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food, so eat.\n\nThen grow, etc.\n\nBut life span is long, so no rush.\n\nI can also go directly.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move to (4,4) on turn 41, then to (5,4) on turn 42, etc.\n\nBut let's not detail.\n\nFor the food at (2,1), if I don't go for it, it disappears, but I can live with that.\n\nTo be safe, I think move right on turn 39.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nTurn 40: R (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 41: R (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 42: U (to (5,4) eat)\n\nTurn 43: from (5,4), after eating, I can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to think.\n\nSince the head direction changes, I need to consider no instant reverse.\n\nAfter turn 42 move U to (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but may be body, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but x=6, not wall? Walls x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok, not wall.\n\nx=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable.\n\nSimilarly y=6 ok.\n\nSo from (5,4), after eating, positions: head at (5,4), body includes (5,3), etc.\n\nBut I can move to (5,5) or (4,4) or (6,4).\n\nBut let's not specify too far.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide the first few moves.\n\nBut for turn 39, I think move R is better.\n\nPerhaps I should include going for the short-life food.\n\nBut with move R, I can still get it as above, but in the sequence I have to specify.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll go with move R on turn 39.\n\nSo action for turn 39: R\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to provide, but since it's based on state, I can assume.\n\nPerhaps the format expects a sequence based on current state without future food changes, but food life span decreases, so state changes.\n\nTo be practical, I'll provide a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nFirst, turn 39: move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 40: from (3,3), move R to (4,3)  # continue right\n\nTurn 41: from (4,3), move R to (5,3)  # to approach food\n\nTurn 42: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) to eat food at (5,4)\n\nTurn 43: from (5,4), after eating, move L to (4,4) for example, to go left.\n\nBut direction after move U is U, so from (5,4), moving L to (4,4) is left, not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 44: from (4,4), move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I think it's arbitrary.\n\nFor the short-life food, I can ignore it since it's not on the way.\n\nSo I think that's fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, with move R, I can still get (2,1) if I want, but in this sequence I don't.\n\nBut for long-term, it's better to go to open area.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- The food at (2,1) has a short life span (3 turns, disappearing after turn 41) and is in a risky area near the wall and snake body. Eating it could lead to a trap if not followed by an immediate right move.\n- The food at (5,4) has a longer life span (8 turns, disappearing after turn 46) and is in a more open area, providing better long-term opportunities.\n- Moving right immediately avoids the risky bottom-left area and heads toward the open right side, where the snake can access more space and the food at (5,4) safely.\n- Thinking 5+ turns ahead, the sequence below ensures the snake eats the high-value food at (5,4) while maintaining maneuverability and avoiding collisions.\n\n### Plan for Turns 39-43:\n- **Turn 39 (current turn)**: Move right (R) to (3,3). This avoids the risk of moving down toward (2,1) and instead heads toward the open area. From (2,3), moving right is safe as (3,3) is unoccupied.\n- **Turn 40**: Move right (R) to (4,3). This continues the path toward (5,4), keeping options open. (4,3) is unoccupied.\n- **Turn 41**: Move right (R) to (5,3). This positions the snake adjacent to the food at (5,4) and avoids the obstacle at (5,2). (5,3) is unoccupied.\n- **Turn 42**: Move up (U) to (5,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases by 1). This is safe as (5,4) is unoccupied and the area is less congested.\n- **Turn 43**: Move left (L) to (4,4). After eating, moving left (from head direction up) is allowed and explores the central area, avoiding walls and body collisions. (4,4) is unoccupied.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving down on turn 39 toward (2,1) risks trapping the snake near the wall (e.g., at (2,1), only left or right moves are possible, and moving left to (1,1) can lead to a dead end). This sequence avoids that.\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (2,1) is skipped due to its low reward relative to risk and short life; focusing on (5,4) yields the same score with better survival odds. Eating at (5,4) on turn 42 is efficient.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: By turn 43, the snake is in the open right-center area with room to maneuver (e.g., to (4,5), (5,5), or (3,4)). The tail is moving away, freeing space over time.\n- **5+ Turn Simulation**: \n  - Turn 39: Move R to (3,3) → positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), ..., (2,4)] (tail at (2,4)).\n  - Turn 40: Move R to (4,3) → positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), ..., (2,5)] (tail at (2,5)).\n  - Turn 41: Move R to (5,3) → positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5)] (tail at (3,5)).\n  - Turn 42: Move U to (5,4) (eat food) → positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), ..., (3,5)] (tail remains at (3,5) during growth).\n  - Turn 43: Move L to (4,4) → positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., (3,6)] (tail at (3,6)).\n- **Collision/Wall Check**: All moves avoid walls (borders at x=0/7, y=0/7; obstacle at (5,2)) and body segments. No instant reverse (e.g., from R to L) occurs.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 by turn 42 and sets up for further exploration. Beyond turn 43, continue toward open cells like (4,5) or (3,4) for sustainability.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 40: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 41: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 42: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 43: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 40. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are occupied, so snake can't go there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). That's 11 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is the tail, I think. Positions are given head first, so index 0: (3,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,4), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,6), 6: (2,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (3,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,4). Yes, tail is (2,4).\n\nHead direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 2\n\n- (5,4) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (6,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, positive. No negative food mentioned, so all are +1.\n\nLife span: for (2,1), it disappears after 2 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 42? Let's see: life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 40, life span 2 means it will be there for turn 40 and 41, gone on turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 7: there until turn 46 (40+7-1=46? Let's calculate.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so:\n\n- Turn t: life span N\n\n- Turn t+1: life span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + (N-1): life span 1\n\n- Gone on turn t + N\n\nSo for (2,1) at t=40, life span 2: present on turn 40 and 41, gone on 42.\n\n(5,4) life span 7: present turns 40 to 46, gone on 47.\n\n(6,6) life span 10: present turns 40 to 49, gone on 50.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer should start from turn 40 action.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (3,3) head\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,4) tail\n\nSo the snake body: from (3,3) right to (2,3), then down to (1,3), then up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then right to (2,6), down to (3,6), left to (3,5), up to (2,5), left to (2,4)? Let's plot:\n\nAt x=1: y=3,4,5,6\n\nx=2: y=3,4,5,6\n\nx=3: y=3,5,6? (3,3), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nList coordinates:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Seg1: (2,3)\n\n- Seg2: (1,3)\n\n- Seg3: (1,4)\n\n- Seg4: (1,5)\n\n- Seg5: (1,6)\n\n- Seg6: (2,6)\n\n- Seg7: (3,6)\n\n- Seg8: (3,5)\n\n- Seg9: (2,5)\n\n- Seg10: (2,4)\n\nSo tail is (2,4).\n\nNow, the snake is moving right, so from (3,3), direction R, so next move could be U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is R, reverse would be L, so cannot move left immediately. Possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nNow, adjacent cells to head (3,3):\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3) - but that's the body segment, and also reverse direction, so not allowed to move left.\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nNow, check if these are valid:\n\n- (3,4): is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,3) head, (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). So (3,4) is not in the list, so not occupied by body. Also, y=4, x=3, not a wall? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and (5,2). (3,4) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): y=2, not wall or border, and not in snake positions? Snake has (3,3), (3,5), (3,6), no (3,2), so free.\n\n(4,3): x=4, y=3, not wall, not in snake positions? Snake positions all between x=1-3, y=3-6 except (3,3) etc., no (4,3), so free.\n\nBut I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (2,1): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 41 or it disappears.\n\n- (5,4): value +1, life span 7, more time\n\n- (6,6): value +1, life span 10, plenty of time\n\nAlso, note that (2,1) is at x=2,y=1. Current head at (3,3). To reach (2,1), it's left and down.\n\nBut there's a body segment at (2,3), which is above (2,1), so if snake moves down to (3,2) or something, but (2,1) is below.\n\nGrid: y increases up? In coordinates, it says U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume. Standard grid: (0,0) bottom left or top left? Usually in such games, (0,0) is top left, y increases down, but here U is (x,y+1), so if U is up, y+1 means y decreases as we go up? Let's clarify.\n\nDirection: U (x,y+1) — if y+1 is up, that means y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Typically in grids, (0,0) can be top-left with y down, or bottom-left with y up.\n\nBut here, U (x,y+1) suggests that y increases as we go up, so (x,0) is bottom, (x,7) is top? But walls include y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nIn the snake positions, head at (3,3), and segments like (1,3) to (1,6), y from 3 to 6, which is from lower y to higher y, so y increases up.\n\nSo (3,3) to (3,4) is up, to (3,2) is down.\n\nFood at (2,1): y=1, which is below y=3, so down.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is right and up, (6,6) is right and up.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 40, possible moves from (3,3) with direction R: can go U, D, R.\n\n- U to (3,4)\n\n- D to (3,2)\n\n- R to (4,3)\n\nI need to evaluate which is best, considering immediate risks and future food, especially (2,1) which expires soon.\n\n(2,1) has life span 2, meaning after this turn, on turn 41, it will have life span 1, so it must be eaten on turn 40 or 41.\n\nIf not eaten by turn 41, gone on 42.\n\nSo we have two chances: turn 40 or turn 41 to eat it.\n\nBut to eat it, the head must move to (2,1).\n\nCurrently head at (3,3), so to reach (2,1), we need to move left and down.\n\nBut current direction is R, and we cannot move left immediately because it's reverse.\n\nSo for turn 40, we cannot move directly to (2,1) from (3,3) in one step; it's two steps away.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving left to (2,3) is not allowed because reverse and also occupied by body.\n\nSo only U, D, R possible.\n\nNow, moving towards (2,1): (2,1) is at (2,1), so from (3,3), we need to go left to x=2 and down to y=1.\n\nBut since we can't go left now, we might need to go down first to (3,2), then left to (2,2) or something.\n\n(2,2) is a cell; is it free?\n\nCurrent snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to see free spaces.\n\nOccupied: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo (2,2) is not occupied, free.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\n(3,4) free? (3,4) not in list, yes free.\n\nNow, walls: (5,2) is obstacle, but not relevant yet.\n\nTo reach (2,1) quickly:\n\nFrom (3,3), if we move D to (3,2) on turn 40.\n\nThen on turn 41, head at (3,2), direction D or whatever.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3) but (3,3) is now the previous head? After move, snake moves.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the body follows.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves, so snake length same, positions shift.\n\nIf food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nFor (2,1), we want to eat it soon.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,2) on turn 40.\n\nThen head to (3,2), direction now D.\n\nThen on turn 41, from (3,2), can move L to (2,2), or D to (3,1), or U to (3,3), or R to (4,2).\n\n(3,3) is now the body segment that was behind head, so after move to (3,2), the positions: new head (3,2), then the old body: (3,3) becomes segment 1, (2,3) segment 2, etc., and tail (2,4) moves? Since no food eaten, tail moves off.\n\nOn turn 40, if move to (3,2):\n\n- Head moves to (3,2)\n\n- Body: the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (3,3)? No.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions list: after move, head is new position, then the first body segment is old head position, second is old first body, etc., and last segment (tail) is removed if no food, or kept if food.\n\nSpecifically: if no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated, and all segments shift: new head at move-to, new segment 1 at old head, new segment 2 at old seg1, ..., new tail at old second last.\n\nIf food eaten, tail stays, so new head, new seg1 at old head, ..., new tail at old tail, but since grown, the old tail is still there, and a new segment is added at the end? Let's think.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so length increases by one, and the tail does not move, so the position where tail was remains as the new tail end.\n\nPositions: after eating, head is at food cell, then the old head position becomes new seg1, old seg1 becomes new seg2, ..., old tail remains as new tail, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nFor example, if snake was [H, B1, B2, T], and H moves to F (food), then new positions: [H_new, H_old, B1, B2, T] so T is still there, and new tail is T, but since grown, positions are H_new, H_old, B1, B2, T, with T not moving.\n\nIf no food, H moves to new, then positions: [H_new, H_old, B1, B2] and T is removed, so B2 is new tail.\n\nIn this case, for turn 40, if no food, moving to (3,2):\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nThen body: old head (3,3) becomes seg1, then old seg1 (2,3) becomes seg2, old seg2 (1,3) becomes seg3, old seg3 (1,4) becomes seg4, ..., up to old seg10 (2,4) is the tail, which is removed, so new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — and (2,4) removed, so tail is (2,5)? Let's index:\n\nOld positions: index 0: (3,3) H, 1: (2,3), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,4), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,6), 6: (2,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (3,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,4) T\n\nAfter move to (3,2) no food:\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (2,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (1,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (1,4)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (1,5)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (1,6)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (2,6)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (3,6)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (3,5)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (2,5)  // since tail removed, old seg9 becomes new tail? Old positions: seg0 to seg10, 11 segments.\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, then new seg1 at old seg0, new seg2 at old seg1, ..., new seg10 at old seg9, and old seg10 (tail) removed, so 10 segments now? Length decreases only if no food, but length same if no food eaten, but tail removed, so one less segment? No.\n\nSnake length: if no food eaten, length unchanged, but the tail moves forward, so the positions shift, but the number of segments is the same; the tail cell is vacated, and the head occupies a new cell.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food, length same, positions: head new, body from old head to old second last, so number of segments unchanged.\n\nIn list: old positions: 11 segments.\n\nAfter move no food: new head at (3,2), then the first 10 segments of old become new body, so new positions: head (3,2), then old seg0 (3,3), old seg1 (2,3), old seg2 (1,3), old seg3 (1,4), old seg4 (1,5), old seg5 (1,6), old seg6 (2,6), old seg7 (3,6), old seg8 (3,5), old seg9 (2,5) — that's 10 body segments, but we have 10 positions after head? Head and 10 body, but old had head and 10 body, 11 total.\n\nOld: seg0 to seg10, 11 positions.\n\nAfter move no food: new head at move-to, then new body: old seg0, old seg1, ..., old seg9. So new positions: [new_head, old_seg0, old_seg1, ..., old_seg9] so 11 positions, but old_seg9 was the second last, old_seg10 was tail and is removed.\n\nFor example, old: H, B1, B2, ..., B10, T\n\nAfter move no food: new H at new pos, then old H becomes B1, old B1 becomes B2, ..., old B9 becomes B10, old T removed. So new: H_new, B1 (old H), B2 (old B1), ..., B10 (old B9), and old T gone.\n\nNumber of segments same, 11.\n\nIn this case, old seg9 is (2,5), old seg10 is (2,4) T.\n\nAfter move to (3,2) no food: new head (3,2), new B1: old H (3,3), new B2: old B1 (2,3), new B3: old B2 (1,3), new B4: old B3 (1,4), new B5: old B4 (1,5), new B6: old B5 (1,6), new B7: old B6 (2,6), new B8: old B7 (3,6), new B9: old B8 (3,5), new B10: old B9 (2,5) — and old B10 (2,4) removed, so tail is new B10 at (2,5).\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, if we move to (3,4) or (4,3).\n\nBut back to reaching (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 41, we can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1) or U to (3,3) etc.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), so from (3,2), moving L to (2,2) or D to (3,1), but not directly to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,2) we can move D to (2,1) on next turn.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1) we can move L to (2,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is y=1, which is above y=0 wall, so (3,1) is valid? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border, so ok.\n\nBut let's see if we can eat on turn 41.\n\nIf on turn 40 we move D to (3,2), then on turn 41 head at (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), we can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1) or U to (3,3) or R to (4,2).\n\nTo reach (2,1), best to move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 42, from (2,2) move D to (2,1) or from (3,1) move L to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) must be eaten by turn 41, so on turn 41 we need to be at (2,1).\n\nTurn 41 is the last chance, life span decreases to 1 on turn 41, so must eat on turn 41 or before.\n\nOn turn 40, we are at (3,3), not (2,1).\n\nOn turn 41, we need to move to (2,1).\n\nSo from turn 40 position, after move, head must be able to move to (2,1) on turn 41.\n\nAfter turn 40 move, where is head?\n\nIf we move to (3,2) on turn 40, then on turn 41, from (3,2), we can move to (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), but not directly to (2,1). (2,1) is adjacent to (3,2)? (3,2) to (2,1) is left and down, not adjacent; adjacent are (2,2), (3,1), (4,2), (3,3) — all differ by one in x or y.\n\n(2,1) is not adjacent to (3,2); it's diagonal.\n\nTo move to (2,1) on turn 41, the head must be at a cell adjacent to (2,1) on turn 40 or after turn 40 move.\n\nAfter turn 40, head is at new position.\n\nAt start of turn 40, head at (3,3).\n\nAfter move, head at new cell, say P.\n\nThen on turn 41, from P, we move to (2,1).\n\nSo P must be adjacent to (2,1).\n\nCells adjacent to (2,1): (2,0), (2,2), (1,1), (3,1)\n\nBut (2,0) is y=0, wall, so invalid.\n\n(1,1) : x=1,y=1, not wall, but need to see if occupied.\n\n(2,2) : x=2,y=2\n\n(3,1) : x=3,y=1\n\nSo possible P for head after turn 40: (1,1), (2,2), or (3,1)\n\nBut at turn 40 start, head is at (3,3), so after move, it can be at (3,4), (3,2), or (4,3)\n\nNone of these are (1,1), (2,2), or (3,1).\n\n(3,2) is one of them, but (3,2) is not adjacent to (2,1); (3,2) to (2,1) is not adjacent, as |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not orthogonal.\n\nOrthogonal adjacent only: same x or same y, differ by 1.\n\nSo (2,1) adjacent cells: (2,0) wall, (2,2), (1,1), (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is adjacent to (2,1), yes.\n\nBut (3,2) is not adjacent to (2,1); it's diagonal, not valid move.\n\nSo from (3,2), we cannot move directly to (2,1); only to (2,2), (3,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3) after move to (3,2), we are at (3,2) on turn 41, not at (3,1) or (2,2).\n\nSo on turn 41, we cannot move directly to (2,1) from any possible position after turn 40 move.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (2,1) on turn 41 because no matter where we move on turn 40, we won't be adjacent to (2,1) on turn 41 start.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nAfter turn 40, head at:\n\n- If move U to (3,4): then on turn 41, at (3,4), adjacent to (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4) — not (2,1)\n\n- If move D to (3,2): at (3,2), adjacent to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2) — not (2,1)\n\n- If move R to (4,3): at (4,3), adjacent to (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3) — not (2,1)\n\nNone of these are adjacent to (2,1). The closest we can be is at (3,2) or (2,2) but (2,2) is not reached yet.\n\nTo be at (2,2) on turn 41, we need to be at (2,2) after turn 40 move? No, on turn 41 start, head position is after turn 40 move.\n\nTo have head at (2,2) on turn 41, it must have moved to (2,2) on turn 40.\n\nBut on turn 40, from (3,3), we can only move to (3,4), (3,2), or (4,3), not to (2,2) directly, and we can't move left because reverse.\n\nSo impossible to be at (2,2) or (3,1) or (1,1) on turn 40 end.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (2,1) on turn 41. The only chance was turn 40, but on turn 40, head is at (3,3), not at (2,1), and (2,1) is not adjacent, so cannot eat on turn 40 either.\n\n(3,3) to (2,1) is not adjacent, so cannot move directly.\n\nTherefore, (2,1) cannot be eaten at all; it will disappear after turn 41.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 40, so after turn 40, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1 on turn 41.\n\nIf eaten on turn 40 or 41.\n\nBut on turn 40, from (3,3), cannot move to (2,1) because not adjacent.\n\nOn turn 41, cannot move to (2,1) from any possible position after turn 40 move, as shown.\n\nSo indeed, (2,1) cannot be eaten and will disappear on turn 42.\n\nSo we should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nNow, other food: (5,4) and (6,6).\n\n(5,4) life span 7, so available until turn 46.\n\n(6,6) life span 10, until turn 49.\n\nNow, we need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n\nAlso, consider the snake body and walls.\n\nCurrent possible moves from (3,3): U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,4): is (3,4) free? Snake positions: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — no (3,4), so free. Not wall.\n\nD to (3,2): free, as above.\n\nR to (4,3): free.\n\nNow, which one to choose.\n\nAlso, need to think about future turns.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk at the tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,4), and food is at (2,1), (5,4), (6,6), none at tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut when we eat food, tail doesn't move, so if there is food at tail position, but not now.\n\nNow, let's consider each move for turn 40.\n\nOption A: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen new head (3,4), direction U.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — tail (2,5), since (2,4) removed? After move no food, tail removed.\n\nOld tail (2,4) removed, new positions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (1,4), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,6), seg7 (2,6), seg8 (3,6), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5) — old seg9 (2,5) is now tail, and old seg10 (2,4) removed.\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), possible next moves: U to (3,5), but (3,5) is in positions, it's seg9? New positions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), ..., seg9 (3,5)? List: new seg8 is old seg7 (3,6), new seg9 is old seg8 (3,5), new seg10 is old seg9 (2,5)\n\nSo (3,5) is new seg9, not head, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is body.\n\nD to (3,3): but (3,3) is seg1, occupied, and also if we move down, it's reverse? Current direction after move is U (since we moved up), so moving D would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) is not in new positions? New positions: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — no (2,4), so free? (2,4) was old tail, removed, so free.\n\nBut (2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n\nR to (4,4): free.\n\nSo from (3,4), with direction U, possible moves: not D (reverse), so U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by seg9, so collision if move there.\n\nL to (2,4): free, as above.\n\nR to (4,4): free.\n\nSo only L or R possible; U to (3,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo if we move U on turn 40, then on turn 41, we can only go L or R, not U.\n\nBut moving U might not be good because it limits options.\n\nOption B: Move D to (3,2) on turn 40.\n\nThen new head (3,2), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (1,4), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,6), seg7 (2,6), seg8 (3,6), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5) tail at (2,5)\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3) but occupied by seg1, collision.\n\nD to (3,1): free? y=1, not wall.\n\nL to (2,2): free? (2,2) not occupied.\n\nR to (4,2): free.\n\nCurrent direction D, so moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nAll seem possible.\n\nOption C: Move R to (4,3) on turn 40.\n\nNew head (4,3), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (1,4), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,6), seg7 (2,6), seg8 (3,6), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5) tail at (2,5)\n\nFrom (4,3), direction R, possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3) but occupied and reverse, not allowed, R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is not wall? Walls: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) is different, y=3, not wall.\n\nx=5,y=3, not border, not (5,2), so free.\n\nSo possible: U, D, R.\n\nNow, to reach food, (5,4) is at (5,4), which is up and right from (4,3).\n\n(6,6) is further.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe snake body occupies the left and top part.\n\nList free cells or areas.\n\nThe grid has walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nFree cells: for example, right side: x=4 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) wall.\n\nBut snake is on left.\n\nAfter moving R to (4,3), we are closer to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), so from (4,3), we can go U to (4,4), then R to (5,4) to eat.\n\nBut (5,4) has life span 7, so no rush.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) can be later.\n\nBut we need to think about the body blocking.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which might affect movement.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, we should aim to eat food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see if moving D to (3,2) is good.\n\nFrom (3,2), we can go to (3,1), (2,2), or (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is near the bottom wall, y=0.\n\n(2,2) is free.\n\nThen from there, we can go to other areas.\n\nBut (2,1) is there but expiring, but we can't eat it anyway.\n\nPerhaps we should go towards (5,4).\n\n(5,4) from current (3,3) is dx=2, dy=1, so two steps.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) it's adjacent.\n\nIf we move R to (4,3) on turn 40, then on turn 41, from (4,3) we can move U to (4,4), then on turn 42, from (4,4) move R to (5,4) to eat (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is food, so we can eat it on turn 42 if we go that way.\n\nLife span 7, turn 42 is within, since present until turn 46.\n\nSimilarly, we can eat (6,6) later.\n\nBut after eating (5,4), the snake grows, so we need to be careful of body.\n\nAlso, there is (6,6) to eat.\n\nNow, but we have to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince we need to output actions for several turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I should plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, the answer format is to list actions from turn 40 onwards for a few turns.\n\nBut how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for as many as I decide, I think.\n\nProbably for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAnother food: (6,6), which is far, life span 10.\n\nBut let's first decide turn 40 action.\n\nIf we move R to (4,3) on turn 40, then we can head towards (5,4).\n\nIf we move D to (3,2), we go down, which might lead to a dead end or something.\n\nThe area at bottom left: (2,1) is food but expiring, (1,1) might be free, etc.\n\nBut since (2,1) can't be eaten, and it will disappear, moving down might not be efficient.\n\nMoving U to (3,4) has the problem that from (3,4), we can only move L or R, not U, and L to (2,4) is free, but (2,4) was tail, now free.\n\nThen from (2,4), we can go down or left, but left to (1,4) is occupied? After move, positions have (1,4) as seg4, occupied.\n\nPerhaps not good.\n\nSo moving R seems better to reach the food.\n\nMoreover, the snake is currently on the left, and food is on the right, so moving right opens up more space.\n\nAlso, the body is coiled, so moving away might reduce risk of self-collision.\n\nFor example, if we move U or D, we might get stuck in the body.\n\nMoving R to (4,3) is into open space.\n\nThen from there, to (5,4) as above.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), and there is wall at (5,2), but (5,4) is fine.\n\nNow, after eating (5,4), the snake grows, and we can go to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (5,4) we can go up and right.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, turn 40: move R to (4,3)\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 41: from (4,3), we can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), or R to (5,3)\n\nTo go to (5,4), moving U to (4,4) is good.\n\nThen on turn 41, move U to (4,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen on turn 42, from (4,4), move R to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is food, so eat it, snake grows.\n\nNow, positions after turn 42:\n\nOn turn 41, after move to (4,4): head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nPositions: since no food on turn 41, assuming we move to (4,4) without eating, but (4,4) is not food, food is at (5,4), so on turn 41, at (4,4), no food.\n\nSo after turn 41 move to (4,4): head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (1,3), seg5 (1,4), seg6 (1,5), seg7 (1,6), seg8 (2,6), seg9 (3,6), seg10 (3,5) — and old tail (2,5) removed? Old positions after turn 40: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), ..., seg10 (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,4) no food: new head (4,4), new seg1 old head (4,3), new seg2 old seg1 (3,3), new seg3 old seg2 (2,3), new seg4 old seg3 (1,3), new seg5 old seg4 (1,4), new seg6 old seg5 (1,5), new seg7 old seg6 (1,6), new seg8 old seg7 (2,6), new seg9 old seg8 (3,6), new seg10 old seg9 (3,5) — old seg10 (2,5) removed, tail at (3,5)\n\nNow turn 42: from (4,4), move R to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is food, so eat it.\n\nAfter move: head at (5,4), since food, tail does not move, so new positions: head (5,4), then old head (4,4) becomes seg1, old seg1 (4,3) becomes seg2, ..., up to old seg10 (3,5) becomes new seg11? Since eaten, length increases.\n\nNew head at (5,4), new seg1: old head (4,4), new seg2: old seg1 (4,3), new seg3: old seg2 (3,3), new seg4: old seg3 (2,3), new seg5: old seg4 (1,3), new seg6: old seg5 (1,4), new seg7: old seg6 (1,5), new seg8: old seg7 (1,6), new seg9: old seg8 (2,6), new seg10: old seg9 (3,6), new seg11: old seg10 (3,5) — and tail is (3,5), which was old seg10.\n\nNow snake has 12 segments.\n\nDirection after move to (5,4) is R.\n\nNow, from here, we can go to other food, like (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (5,4) we can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) might be free, (6,4) free.\n\nAlso, walls: (5,2) obstacle, but not relevant.\n\nLife span of (6,6) is 10, so we have time.\n\nBut we need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, the body is mostly on the left, so the right side is open.\n\nAfter being at (5,4), we can move U to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\ny=6, x=6.\n\n(6,6) is food.\n\nFrom (5,4), move U to (5,5) on turn 43? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn 40: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 41: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42: move R to (5,4) eat food\n\nNow turn 43: head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but occupied and reverse, not allowed, R to (6,4)\n\nSo can go U, D, R.\n\n(5,5) is free? Not in positions, so yes.\n\n(6,4) free.\n\nTo go to (6,6), we need to go up and right.\n\nMove U to (5,5) on turn 43.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 44: from (5,5), move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5), etc.\n\n(5,6) is y=6, not wall.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (5,5), we can move R to (6,5) or U to (5,6).\n\nThen from (6,5) move U to (6,6), or from (5,6) move R to (6,6).\n\nSay on turn 44, from (5,5) move R to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 45: from (6,5) move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nOr other ways.\n\nBut (6,6) life span 10, turn 45 is fine.\n\nBut we need to check if there are any collisions.\n\nAlso, during this, the snake body is moving, but since we are moving away, it should be ok.\n\nNow, what about moving D on turn 40? It might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving U has limitations.\n\nSo R seems good.\n\nBut in the beginning, if we move D to (3,2), we might explore other areas, but with the expiring food not accessible, it might not be worth it.\n\nMoreover, (5,4) is closer and can be eaten soon.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but no food at tail now.\n\nAlso, when we eat, need to ensure not adjacent to tail with food, but not now.\n\nSo I think moving right is best.\n\nThen for turn 41, move up to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 42, move right to (5,4) to eat.\n\nThen after that, we can head to (6,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nSince the food (2,1) is not reachable, we ignore it.\n\nNow, for turn 40, action R.\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nCurrent turn 40, action R.\n\nThen turn 41, from (4,3), move U to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 42, from (4,4), move R to (5,4)\n\nNow, after that, to eat (6,6), on turn 43, from (5,4), move U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 44, from (5,5), move R to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 45, from (6,5), move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nAll these should be valid.\n\n(6,5) is free? At that time, need to check, but since body is behind, and grid has space, should be ok.\n\nWe can think more turns.\n\nBut for output, perhaps list up to turn 45 or so.\n\nSince we are to think ahead, but output the sequence.\n\nAnswer format: list actions from turn 40 onwards.\n\nNow, about the life span: (5,4) eaten on turn 42, life span 7 at turn 40, so on turn 42, life span is 7 - (42-40) = 7 - 2 = 5, still positive, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) eaten on turn 45, life span 10 at turn 40, on turn 45, 10 - 5 = 5, ok.\n\nAnd (2,1) disappears on turn 42.\n\nNow, another thing: when moving to (5,4), is there any risk? (5,4) is not under snake body, and we move directly.\n\nAlso, after eating, the tail is at (3,5), far away.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nIf we had moved differently, but this seems efficient.\n\nBut let's see if moving directly to (6,6) is better, but (5,4) is closer and available, so eat it first.\n\nMoreover, it has shorter life, but 7 turns, plenty.\n\nLife span 7 vs 10, but both long.\n\nBut (5,4) might be eaten sooner to avoid missing it, but we are eating it on turn 42.\n\nIf we go directly to (6,6), from (3,3) to (6,6) is dx=3, dy=3, so at least 3 moves, but not direct.\n\nFor example, move R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), but (5,3) is near (5,2) wall? (5,3) is not wall.\n\nThen to (6,3), then up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but longer, and we miss (5,4).\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo better to eat (5,4) on the way.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) later.\n\nSo sequence: turn 40: R, turn 41: U, turn 42: R (eat (5,4)), then turn 43: U, turn 44: R, turn 45: U (to eat (6,6) if we go that way).\n\nBut on turn 43, from (5,4), we move U to (5,5), then turn 44 to (6,5), turn 45 to (6,6).\n\nBut from (5,4), we could move R to (6,4) first, then up, but (6,4) to (6,6) takes two moves up, same as above.\n\n(6,4) to (6,5) to (6,6).\n\nBut (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,6) is similar.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut in terms of path, going through (5,5) might be fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output for multiple turns, say 5 turns: turn 40 to 44 actions.\n\nBut on turn 42 we eat, and turn 45 eat another, but let's see.\n\nSince we think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps start with turn 40 action, and so on.\n\nBut in the sequence above, turn 40: R, turn 41: U, turn 42: R, turn 43: U, turn 44: R, then turn 45: U.\n\nBut on turn 44, from (5,5) move R to (6,5), then turn 45 U to (6,6).\n\nBut I can stop at turn 44 for now.\n\nThe core is to survive and eat.\n\nAnother consideration: after eating (5,4), the snake is longer, and we need to avoid self-collision.\n\nFor example, when at (5,4), the body includes (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc., all to the left, so moving up to (5,5) is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) free.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nIf we had moved down on turn 40, for example, to (3,2), then we might go to (3,1), (2,1) but food gone, or (4,2), then to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so from (4,2), we can go to (4,1), (5,2) invalid, (3,2) might be body, etc.\n\nMessy.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, moving up initially, to (3,4), then we have to move left or right, say to (2,4) or (4,4), but then we are not closer to food.\n\nSo R is best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 40, action R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as planned.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nThe format is to list from turn 40.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 40: R\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: R\n\nThen for turn 43 and 44, I need to include.\n\nSince we think 5 turns ahead, but output the sequence we decide.\n\nTurn 43: from (5,4) move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 44: from (5,5) move R to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 45: U to (6,6) but that might be beyond.\n\nFor output, perhaps list up to turn 44.\n\nOr include until we eat both, but (6,6) on turn 45.\n\nBut the answer can be for as many turns as needed, but at least from turn 40.\n\nPerhaps list actions for turns 40 to 44.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 42 we eat (5,4), which is good.\n\nThen turns 43 and 44 towards (6,6).\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that on each move, no collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 41, from (4,3) move U to (4,4): (4,4) should be free, which it is at that time.\n\nSimilarly, turn 42, (5,4) food, not body.\n\nTurn 43, (5,5) should be free, etc.\n\nSince the body is trailing behind, and we move away, it should be ok.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I must prioritize eating positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. I will think at least 5 turns ahead (turns 40-44) and plan a sequence that secures the +1 food at (5,4) by turn 42, as it has a moderate lifespan (7 turns, expiring after turn 46). The food at (2,1) cannot be eaten due to movement constraints and will disappear after turn 41, so it is ignored. The food at (6,6) has a long lifespan (10 turns, expiring after turn 49) and will be targeted after (5,4) is eaten. The snake's current position and direction must be considered to avoid instant reversals and deadly collisions.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- **Current State (Turn 40):** Snake head at (3,3), direction R (right). Possible moves: U (up, to (3,4)), D (down, to (3,2)), R (right, to (4,3)). L (left) is invalid (reverse direction and occupied by body).\n- **Food Accessibility:**\n  - (2,1): Cannot be eaten on turns 40 or 41 due to adjacency constraints. It disappears after turn 41, so it is irrelevant.\n  - (5,4): Can be reached by turn 42 via moves: R to (4,3) on turn 40, U to (4,4) on turn 41, R to (5,4) on turn 42 (eating it).\n  - (6,6): Can be targeted after (5,4), e.g., via U to (5,5) on turn 43, R to (6,5) on turn 44, then U to (6,6) on turn 45 (beyond the 5-turn plan but considered for safety).\n- **Risks:** \n  - Moving U on turn 40 leads to limited options on turn 41 (only L or R possible, with U causing collision).\n  - Moving D on turn 40 takes the snake toward the bottom wall, away from food, and may lead to dead ends.\n  - Moving R on turn 40 opens space toward (5,4) and avoids body collisions.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** After eating (5,4) on turn 42, the snake grows to 12 segments. The path to (6,6) is safe as the body is concentrated on the left, leaving the right area open. No tail reward danger exists (no food at tail).\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 40-44):**\n- **Turn 40 (from (3,3)):** Move R to (4,3) – Moves toward (5,4), avoids body, and maintains flexibility.\n- **Turn 41 (from (4,3)):** Move U to (4,4) – Positions to reach (5,4) on next turn; (4,4) is free.\n- **Turn 42 (from (4,4)):** Move R to (5,4) – Eats +1 food; (5,4) is free and within lifespan.\n- **Turn 43 (from (5,4)):** Move U to (5,5) – Heads toward (6,6); (5,5) is free and safe.\n- **Turn 44 (from (5,5)):** Move R to (6,5) – Continues path to (6,6); (6,5) is free and low-risk.\n\n**Why this plan?**\n- **Efficiency:** Secures (5,4) quickly (turn 42) and sets up for (6,6) by turn 45.\n- **Safety:** Avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions at each step. The snake moves away from its coiled body, reducing self-collision risk.\n- **Lifespan Utilization:** (5,4) is eaten with 5 lifespan left (on turn 42), and (6,6) can be eaten by turn 45 with 5 lifespan left.\n- **Flexibility:** After turn 44, the snake can easily reach (6,6) on turn 45 or adjust based on new state.\n\n**Collision Checks (simulated positions):**\n- Turn 40 end: Head (4,3), body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) – No collision.\n- Turn 41 end: Head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) – No collision; (4,4) free.\n- Turn 42 end: Head (5,4) (eats food), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) – Grows to 12 segments; no collision.\n- Turn 43 end: Head (5,5), body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) – No collision; (5,5) free.\n- Turn 44 end: Head (6,5), body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) – No collision; (6,5) free.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating one +1 food (5,4) within 3 turns and positions for a second +1 food (6,6) shortly after, while ensuring survival through open-area movement.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: R (right)  \nTurn 41: U (up)  \nTurn 42: R (right)  \nTurn 43: U (up)  \nTurn 44: R (right)\n}",

There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). That's 11 segments.

So if not eaten on turn 41, it vanishes.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 41 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Example: if life span 1 at turn 41, countdown starts at 1, decreases to 0 at end of turn 41, so disappears after turn 41, meaning not available on turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, life span 6 at turn 41: countdown 6 on turn 41, after turn 41 it becomes 5, and so on, until countdown 0 after turn 46, so disappears after turn 46, not available on turn 47.\n\nBut for eating, we care about when it can be eaten before disappearing.\n\nNow, current turn is 41.\n\nSnake head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction, so since current direction is R, cannot move L (left). So possible: U, D, R. R is forward, U and D are perpendicular.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,2). So cells to avoid: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2).\n\nNow, head at (4,3), moving R.\n\nPossible next positions:\n\n- R: (5,3)\n\n- U: (4,4)\n\n- D: (4,2)\n\nBut need to check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, (5,3): is it a wall? x=5, y=3. Walls are borders and (5,2). (5,3) is not a border or obstacle. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (5,3) is within bounds, and not (5,2), so ok for wall.\n\nBut is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5). None of these are (5,3), so it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, U: (4,4) - not wall, not in body positions.\n\nD: (4,2) - not wall, not in body.\n\n(4,2): walls include y=0, but y=2 is not border, and not (5,2), so ok.\n\nBut (5,2) is a wall, so (4,2) is fine.\n\nAlso, for body collision, since the snake moves, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it's collision. But tail is special because it moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (5,3), (4,4), (4,2), none are in body, so all safe for now.\n\nBut we need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, food: (2,1) life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or it's gone.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nHead is at (4,3), so not adjacent.\n\nTo eat (2,1) on this turn, head needs to be at (2,1), but it's at (4,3), which is two cells away, so impossible to reach in one move. Therefore, (2,1) cannot be eaten and will disappear after this turn. So we can ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (5,4) and (6,6).\n\n(5,4) has life span 6, so available until turn 46? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 41: life span 6, countdown 6\n\nAfter turn 41: countdown 5\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 46: countdown 0, disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 46.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 9, disappears after turn 49, last eat on turn 49.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nI need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding risks.\n\nAlso, the grid: let me sketch for clarity.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — so column x=1, y from 3 to 6.\n\nThen (2,3), (2,6), (2,5) — (2,3) is connected to (1,3), then from (2,3) to where? Positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nSo let's order: head (4,3), then (3,3), then (2,3), then (1,3), then up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6)? (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, then (3,5) which is down? y=5<6, so down, then (2,5) left.\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) is left.\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nSo the snake is like: from head (4,3) left to (3,3), left to (2,3), left to (1,3), then up to (1,4), up to (1,5), up to (1,6), then right to (2,6), then down to (3,6), then down to (3,5)? (3,6) to (3,5) is down, y decreasing, then (3,5) to (2,5) left.\n\n(2,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, food at (2,1), (5,4), (6,6).\n\n(2,1) is below (2,3), but since life span 1, it will be gone.\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4.\n\n(6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n\nHead at (4,3), moving right.\n\nPossible moves: R to (5,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2).\n\nNow, let's think about risks.\n\nFirst, if we move R to (5,3): position (5,3). Then from there, possible moves: since direction would be R, so cannot move L (left), so U, D, R.\n\nU: (5,4) — which has food! (5,4) has food with value 1.\n\nBut life span 6, so not urgent.\n\nD: (5,2) — but (5,2) is a wall! So cannot move D from (5,3).\n\nR: (6,3)\n\nU: (5,4)\n\n(5,3) to U is (5,4), yes.\n\nBut (5,2) is wall, so from (5,3), D is invalid.\n\nAlso, if we go R to (5,3), then next moves.\n\nBut let's consider all options for turn 41.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nFood at (5,4) is adjacent up.\n\nIf we move U to (5,4) on next turn, we eat the food.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (4,4)\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but (4,3) is current body, will it be there? When we move, the body follows.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), the new positions: head (4,4), then (4,3) becomes body, and tail moves away, but since we didn't eat, length same, so tail (2,5) disappears, and new tail is (1,3)? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nIf move U to (4,4), new head (4,4), then body: the first segment becomes (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) — and (2,5) is removed since no growth.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTail is (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (4,2): head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (3,5), (2,5) removed? Positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] — (2,5) removed, tail (3,5).\n\nNow, back to options.\n\nAlso, option 3: move D to (4,2)\n\nThen from there.\n\nNow, we need to maximize score, so eat food when possible, but avoid risks, especially tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,5), no food there, so no issue now.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to food.\n\nFirst, (5,4) is close, at (5,4).\n\nFrom head (4,3), if we go R to (5,3), then U to (5,4) to eat it on turn 42.\n\nBut on turn 41, if we go R to (5,3), we don't eat anything yet.\n\n(5,3) has no food.\n\nThen on turn 42, if we go U to (5,4), we eat the food.\n\nBut we need to see if that is safe and what happens after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is farther.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother food at (6,6).\n\nBut life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate move.\n\nIf we move U to (4,4), then we are at (4,4), which might be closer to (6,6) or something.\n\n(6,6) is at top-right.\n\nHead at (4,3), (4,4) is up.\n\nThen from (4,4), we can go towards (6,6).\n\nBut (5,4) is also food, so perhaps we should eat (5,4) first since it's closer.\n\nBut life span 6, so not urgent, but no other food to eat immediately.\n\n(2,1) is gone after this turn.\n\nSo only (5,4) and (6,6).\n\nEating (5,4) soon might be good.\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so body increases.\n\nIf we eat at (5,4), the new tail will be added, so length increases by 1.\n\nNow, potential risks.\n\nFor example, if we go to (5,3) then to (5,4), that seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's check the grid around.\n\nFrom (5,3), after moving U to (5,4), head at (5,4), and we eat, so new positions: head (5,4), then body includes (5,3), (4,3), etc., and since we ate, the tail doesn't move away, so new segment added, so the previous tail (2,5) stays, but in the sequence.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body extends.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (5,4) and eating, positions: head (5,4), then the previous head (5,3) becomes body, and the tail remains, so the body grows by one segment.\n\nSpecifically, from before move: positions [(4,3), (3,3), ... , (2,5)]\n\nAfter move to (5,3) without eating: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5)] and (2,5) removed? Let's not confuse.\n\nTurn 41: start positions S = [H=(4,3), B1=(3,3), B2=(2,3), B3=(1,3), B4=(1,4), B5=(1,5), B6=(1,6), B7=(2,6), B8=(3,6), B9=(3,5), T=(2,5)]\n\nIf move R to (5,3), no food, so new head (5,3), new body: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] and tail (2,5) is removed, so positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail is (3,5)\n\nThen on turn 42, if move U to (5,4), which has food, so eat it. New head (5,4), new body: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] and since ate, add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] now 12 segments, tail at (3,5)\n\nThen from there, head at (5,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is now body, so cannot move there, L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\n(5,3) is body, so D is invalid.\n\nU: (5,5), L: (4,4), R: (6,4)\n\nNow, (5,5) might be free, (4,4) might be free, (6,4) might be free.\n\nBut we need to think further.\n\nAnother option: on turn 41, if we move U to (4,4) directly.\n\nFrom (4,3) U to (4,4), no food there, so move: new head (4,4), body [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] and tail (2,5) removed, positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nThen from (4,4), we can move to (5,4) to eat the food on turn 42.\n\nMove R to (5,4), eat food.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,4), body [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] and add new segment, so positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nSame as before, but now head at (5,4) after turn 42.\n\nCompared to previous, if we went R then U, we are at (5,4) on turn 42, with tail at (3,5) in both cases? In first sequence, after eating, tail at (3,5), here also.\n\nIn first sequence: after turn 42, positions include (3,5) as part of body, tail is (3,5) still? In the list, (3,5) is the last, so tail.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nBut the body is slightly different.\n\nIn first case (R then U): positions after eating: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nIn second case (U then R): [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nSo different body: in first, (5,3) is body, in second, (4,4) is body.\n\nBut for now, similar.\n\nNow, from (5,4), head direction U or R? In first sequence, after moving U to (5,4), direction is U.\n\nIn second sequence, after moving R to (5,4), direction is R.\n\nThen possible moves differ.\n\nFor example, if direction U, can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nIf direction R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nBut in both cases, from (5,4), we have options to go to (5,5), (4,4), or (6,4), but (4,4) may be occupied or not.\n\nIn first sequence, after eating, (4,4) is not in positions; positions have (5,3), (4,3), etc., not (4,4).\n\nIn first sequence positions: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), ... so (4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly in second sequence: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), ... so (4,4) is body, cannot move there.\n\nSo different.\n\nBut let's not digress; we need to choose turn 41 move.\n\nAnother option is move D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is below, no food, and it might be less useful for reaching food.\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, (4,3) is at y=3, so moving D to (4,2) goes away from food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is at y=6, so down might not be good.\n\nSo probably U or R is better.\n\nNow, if we move R to (5,3), then we can eat (5,4) on next turn.\n\nIf we move U to (4,4), then we can also eat (5,4) on next turn by moving R.\n\nSo both allow eating (5,4) on turn 42.\n\nBut moving R first might be slightly better because it gets us closer to the right side, where (6,6) is.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so from (5,3) or (4,4), similar.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nThere is a potential issue: the internal wall at (5,2).\n\nIf we go to (5,3), then from there, we cannot move down because (5,2) is wall, so only U, R, or L but L is opposite? Direction is R, so from (5,3), direction R, so cannot move L (left to (4,3)), but (4,3) is body anyway.\n\nSo from (5,3), moves: U to (5,4), R to (6,3), or D but D to (5,2) wall, invalid. So only U or R.\n\nIf we move U to (5,4), we eat, as planned.\n\nIf we move R to (6,3), then we delay eating, but (5,4) might be eaten later or by someone else? No, only one snake.\n\nBut life span 6, so ok.\n\nBut eating sooner might be better to score and grow.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 41 we move U to (4,4), then from (4,4), we can move R to (5,4) to eat on turn 42.\n\nOr move U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) to (5,4) is R, so direction R.\n\nThen from (5,4), after eating, direction R, so can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4).\n\nD to (5,3) might be possible if not body.\n\nIn the sequence where we eat from left, (5,3) is body, so D invalid; in sequence from below, (5,3) may not be body.\n\nBut let's focus on turn 41.\n\nI think moving R to (5,3) or U to (4,4) both lead to eating on turn 42 if we want.\n\nBut there is another food at (6,6), and we need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, the snake body is coiled, and there might be dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (1,3) to (1,6) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it frees up cells.\n\nCurrently, the left column x=1 from y=3 to 6 is occupied, but when snake moves right, those will be freed over time.\n\nSimilarly, tail at (2,5) will move.\n\nBut for now, let's plan to eat (5,4) on turn 42.\n\nThen after that, we can go for (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), life span 9, so we have time.\n\nFrom (5,4) after eating, we can move towards (6,6).\n\nFor example, move U to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6), but (6,6) has food, so eat on turn 44 or something.\n\nTurn 42: eat at (5,4), head at (5,4)\n\nTurn 43: move to, say, (5,5) or (6,4)\n\nThen turn 44: to (6,5) or (5,6), etc., to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) can be reached in a few moves.\n\nBut there might be risks with the body.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nAlso, food under body: but in this case, no food under body mentioned.\n\nFood at (2,1) is under something? (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, body has (2,3), (2,6), (2,5), not (2,1), so not under body.\n\n(5,4) is free, (6,6) free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 41 move.\n\nIf we move D to (4,2), that might be worse because it goes down, away from food.\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, and walls below, y=0, so less room.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), we can move to (4,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or (3,2), etc., but no food nearby, and (5,4) is up, so we have to go back up.\n\nBut it might be possible, but not efficient.\n\nSo probably U or R is better.\n\nNow, between U and R, moving R to (5,3) has the advantage that from (5,3), we can only go U or R, so if we go U to (5,4), we eat immediately.\n\nIf we move U to (4,4), then to eat (5,4), we move R to (5,4).\n\nBut in both cases, we eat on turn 42.\n\nHowever, if we move U to (4,4) on turn 41, we are at (4,4), which is one step up, and (4,4) might be useful for later.\n\nBut let's see the difference.\n\nPerhaps we should consider not eating (5,4) immediately, but that seems suboptimal since it's positive food.\n\nUnless there is a risk.\n\nFor example, if we go to (5,3), and then to (5,4), we eat, but then from (5,4), we are at the top, and the grid has walls.\n\nBut (5,4) to (6,4) or (5,5) are possible.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), so we can go right and up.\n\nBut let's check if there are any immediate dangers.\n\nAnother point: the food at (5,4) has life span 6, so if we don't eat it now, we can eat it later, but since it's there, and we can eat it safely, why not?\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) later.\n\nBut if we delay, it might be harder to reach or something.\n\nBut in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to (6,6) but it's farther.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), if we move R to (5,3), then R to (6,3), then U to (6,4), then U to (6,5), then U to (6,6), eat on turn 45 or so.\n\nBut (5,4) is on the way? (5,4) is at y=4, (6,3) is at y=3, so not directly on the way to (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,3) to (6,4) is up, then to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, so we could go to (5,4) first.\n\nBut if we go to (6,3) first, we might miss (5,4) if not careful.\n\nLife span 6, so we have until turn 46 to eat it.\n\nBut let's think about the map.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (5,2), which blocks the bottom, but not relevant for now.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies the left side.\n\nAs the snake moves right, the left cells will be freed.\n\nFor example, when we move, the tail moves, so (2,5) will be free soon.\n\nBut for now, let's decide on turn 41.\n\nI think it's safe to eat (5,4) on turn 42.\n\nSo for turn 41, moving R to (5,3) or U to (4,4) both work.\n\nBut moving R to (5,3) might be slightly better because it commits us to the right, and from (5,3), we have to go U or R, so going U to (5,4) is natural.\n\nIf we move U to (4,4), we have more choices, but we can still go R to (5,4).\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so if we move U, the new direction is U; if we move R, new direction R.\n\nThen for next moves, the no reverse constraint.\n\nFor example, if we move R to (5,3), direction R, then on turn 42, we move U to (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 43, from (5,4) direction U, we can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4).\n\nIf we had moved U to (4,4) on turn 41, direction U, then move R to (5,4) on turn 42, direction R, then on turn 43 from (5,4) direction R, we can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), or R to (6,4).\n\nIn the first case, after eating at (5,4), direction U, so we cannot move D, which might be good or bad.\n\nIn second case, direction R, we can move D to (5,3) if free.\n\nBut in the body, it may not be free.\n\nI think for simplicity, let's go with moving R to (5,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen turn 42 move U to (5,4) to eat.\n\nThen after that, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen we need to go to (6,6).\n\nSo move U to (5,5) on turn 43, then R to (6,5) on turn 44, then U to (6,6) on turn 45 to eat.\n\nBut (6,6) has food, so on turn 45, move to (6,6) to eat.\n\nLife span 9, so turn 41 to turn 49, so turn 45 is fine.\n\nNow, are there any risks in this path?\n\nFirst, on turn 41: move R to (5,3)\n\nPosition: (5,3), not wall, not body, safe.\n\nTurn 42: move U to (5,4), eat food. Safe, no issue.\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPositions: as before, [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nNow turn 43: possible moves from (5,4) direction U: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\n(5,5): not wall, not body (body has (5,4), (5,3), etc., no (5,5)), so safe.\n\n(4,4): not wall, not body (body has (4,3), but not (4,4)), so safe.\n\n(6,4): not wall, not body, safe.\n\nWe want to go to (6,6), so moving U to (5,5) is good.\n\nMove U to (5,5).\n\nNo food, so new head (5,5), body: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] and tail (3,5) removed? Positions: after moving, no eat, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) — (3,5) removed, and (3,6) is now part of body, tail is (3,6)? List: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] tail (3,6)\n\n(3,6) was B8, now the last.\n\nNow head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (6,5) — since we want to go right.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,5) direction U, so can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is towards (6,6).\n\n(6,5): not wall, not body, safe.\n\nMove R to (6,5).\n\nNo food, so new head (6,5), body [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] and tail (3,6) removed? Positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] tail (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is now tail.\n\nDirection now R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 45: move U to (6,6), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew head (6,6), body includes (6,5), etc., and add new segment, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] and since ate, tail doesn't move, so add new, tail still (2,6), but with new segment, so positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) — 13 segments, tail at (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is the last, but we added a new segment, so the body extends, tail was (2,6), now it stays, and new tail is not moved, so the segment before becomes tail or something.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new position has the head at new cell, the previous head becomes body, and all body shifts, but tail stays, so length increases.\n\nAfter move to (6,6) and eat, positions: head (6,6), then the previous positions without removing tail: so from before move, positions were [(6,5), (5,5), ..., (2,6)] 12 segments.\n\nAfter move to (6,6), head (6,6), then the list: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) — so (2,6) is still there, and since we ate, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the last segment stays, so positions become: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] with tail at (2,6).\n\nNow, the snake is longer.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut in this plan, we ate both foods by turn 45.\n\nNow, back to turn 41, we need to choose the move.\n\nIn this plan, we moved R on turn 41.\n\nBut what if we moved U on turn 41?\n\nSimilar, but let's see.\n\nIf on turn 41 move U to (4,4), no eat.\n\nThen turn 42 move R to (5,4), eat.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction R.\n\nThen turn 43: from (5,4) direction R, can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4)\n\nIf we move U to (5,5), then same as before.\n\nThen to (6,5) on turn 44, but from (5,5) direction U? After moving U to (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 44 move R to (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 45 move U to (6,6), eat.\n\nSame thing, but one turn later for reaching (6,6)? Turn 45 same.\n\nIn first plan: turn 41 R to (5,3), turn 42 U to (5,4) eat, turn 43 U to (5,5), turn 44 R to (6,5), turn 45 U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSecond way: turn 41 U to (4,4), turn 42 R to (5,4) eat, turn 43 U to (5,5), turn 44 R to (6,5), turn 45 U to (6,6) eat. Same.\n\nBut in first way, after turn 42, we are at (5,4) with direction U, and body includes (5,3), so (5,3) occupied.\n\nIn second way, after turn 42, at (5,4) direction R, body includes (4,4), so (4,4) occupied.\n\nBut for the path to (6,6), it doesn't matter.\n\nHowever, in the first way, by moving R on turn 41, we are at (5,3) which is closer to the wall, but since we go up, it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 41, if we move D to (4,2), that would be worse.\n\nFor example, move D to (4,2), then from there, we can move to (4,1) or (3,2) or (5,2) invalid, so (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nBut (4,1) is close to wall y=0, and no food, so we need to go back up to eat (5,4), which takes more turns.\n\nFor instance, turn 41 D to (4,2), turn 42 move to (4,3) but (4,3) might be body or not.\n\nAfter move D to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5), tail (2,5) removed? [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 42, from (4,2) direction D? Moved down, so direction D.\n\nCan move L to (3,2), R to (5,2) invalid, U to (4,3), but (4,3) is body now, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (4,1) if y=1 not wall.\n\ny=1 not wall, walls y=0, so (4,1) is valid.\n\nOr L to (3,2).\n\n(4,3) is body, so U invalid.\n\nSo only L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nSay move to (3,2), then we are going left and down, away from food.\n\nThen to eat (5,4), we need to go back, but (5,4) life span 6, so possible, but inefficient and we might not reach (6,6) in time if we waste turns.\n\n(6,6) life span 9, so ok, but better to eat sooner.\n\nSo moving down is not good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 41, moving R or U is better.\n\nNow, between R and U, I think R is slightly better because it gets us to (5,3) which is adjacent to food, so we can eat next turn.\n\nAlso, moving right might free up space on the left faster, but not crucial.\n\nIn terms of the answer, we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, and output actions starting from turn 41.\n\nBut we don't know the future food, but since no new food mentioned, we assume only these for now.\n\nThe state has food with life span, so we need to consider them.\n\nBut after eating, they are gone.\n\nIn this case, we have two foods.\n\nIn the plan, by moving R on turn 41, we can eat both by turn 45.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", we should output at least 5 turns, or until a point.\n\nBut the food at (6,6) is eaten on turn 45, which is 4 turns ahead from turn 41? Turn 41,42,43,44,45 is 5 actions: t41, t42, t43, t44, t45.\n\nt41 to t45 is 5 turns.\n\nt41: action, t42: action, ..., up to t45.\n\nTurn t41 + k for k=0 to 4.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps we can output until we eat both or something.\n\nBut to be safe, let's output 5 turns.\n\nNow, in the sequence, on turn 41 move R to (5,3), turn 42 move U to (5,4) eat first food, turn 43 move U to (5,5), turn 44 move R to (6,5), turn 45 move U to (6,6) eat second food.\n\nBut after that, we need to survive, but no more food, so we can continue moving.\n\nBut the output can stop after a few moves.\n\nSince the instruction says \"maximize score\", and score is from eating food, so after eating both, we can just survive, but no immediate danger.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so we need to specify the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any risk.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when we eat at (6,6), is the tail adjacent or something?\n\nOn turn 45, when we move to (6,6), tail is at (2,6), which is far, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nAlso, during the path, when we move to (6,5) on turn 44, tail at (2,6), not adjacent.\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6, head at (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, what about moving U on turn 41.\n\nIf we move U to (4,4) on turn 41, then turn 42 R to (5,4) eat, turn 43 U to (5,5), turn 44 R to (6,5), turn 45 U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSame actions from turn 43 onwards.\n\nBut turn 41 different.\n\nIn this case, on turn 41, moving U to (4,4), which is not directly towards the food, but still leads to eating.\n\nBut moving R is more direct.\n\nMoreover, in moving R, we avoid the possibility of going elsewhere.\n\nBut I think both are fine, but I'll go with R.\n\nPerhaps we should consider the grid congestion.\n\nThe body is on the left, so moving right frees space.\n\nMoving up also, but (4,4) might be useful.\n\nBut in the long run, similar.\n\nAnother point: the internal wall at (5,2) might affect if we go down, but we don't.\n\nSo I think moving R on turn 41 is good.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nIn the output, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=41.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nBut turn 43: from (5,4) to (5,5) is U, yes.\n\nAnd turn 44 to (6,5) is R, from (5,5) to (6,5), direction U, move R, so yes.\n\nThen turn 45 to (6,6) U.\n\nNow, after that, we can stop or continue, but since no more food, and we need to survive, but for the sequence, 5 turns should be fine.\n\nTo be complete, let's see turn 46.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6), head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nPositions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] tail (2,6)\n\nThen possible moves: from (6,6) direction U, can move U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall! y=7 is border, wall, so cannot move U.\n\nL to (5,6), R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, so cannot move D.\n\nL to (5,6), which might be free.\n\n(5,6): not in positions, not wall, so can move L to (5,6).\n\nThen direction L.\n\nBut we don't need to output, just for thinking.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut in our sequence, for 5 turns, up to turn 45 is fine.\n\nNow, about the food: (5,4) eaten on turn 42, which is within life span (last turn 46, so turn 42 is fine).\n\n(6,6) eaten on turn 45, life span 9, last turn 49, fine.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut we need to output in the box.\n\nAlso, for turn 41, we must choose one action.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it should work.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different path, but this seems efficient.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 43, from (5,4), instead of moving U to (5,5), we could move R to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (6,6).\n\nFor example: turn 43 R to (6,4), then turn 44 U to (6,5), turn 45 U to (6,6).\n\nBut from (5,4) to (6,4) is R, then to (6,5) U, then to (6,6) U.\n\nBut in terms of turns, same as before: turn 43 action, turn 44, turn 45.\n\nIn previous, turn 43 U to (5,5), turn 44 R to (6,5), turn 45 U to (6,6).\n\nHere, turn 43 R to (6,4), turn 44 U to (6,5), turn 45 U to (6,6).\n\nBut on turn 44, in first, we are at (6,5), in second at (6,5) same, but in first we reached (6,5) on turn 44, in second on turn 44 we move to (6,5) from (6,4)? Turn 43: if to (6,4), then turn 44 to (6,5), so on turn 44 at (6,5), same as first where on turn 44 at (6,5) after move.\n\nIn first sequence, turn 44 move to (6,5), so at (6,5) at end of turn 44.\n\nSimilarly in second, turn 44 move to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 45 to (6,6).\n\nBut in first sequence, from (5,5) to (6,5) is right, which might be better if we want to avoid the left, but (6,4) is fine.\n\nBut in terms of the body, when we move to (6,4), it might be closer to existing body or something, but not necessary.\n\nI think the first path is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, the plan involves moving right (R) on turn 41 to position the snake for eating the food at (5,4) on turn 42. After eating, the snake moves up (U) to (5,5) on turn 43, then right (R) to (6,5) on turn 44, and finally up (U) to (6,6) on turn 45 to eat the second food. This sequence efficiently consumes both food items within their life spans and avoids all collisions. The food at (2,1) is ignored as it disappears after turn 41 and is unreachable.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Life Spans**: \n  - (5,4) has a life span of 6, disappearing after turn 46. Eating on turn 42 is safe.\n  - (6,6) has a life span of 9, disappearing after turn 49. Eating on turn 45 is safe.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - All moves avoid walls (borders and (5,2)) and body segments. \n  - No tail reward danger, as the tail is never adjacent to food when eaten.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - No instant reverse is violated (e.g., moving R then L is not done).\n  - The snake grows after eating, but paths remain safe.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: \n  - Eating (5,4) first scores immediately and positions the snake to reach (6,6) efficiently.\n  - After turn 45, the snake can continue surviving by moving left (L) to (5,6) or other safe cells, but the sequence stops at turn 45 as both foods are consumed.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 41**: Move R to (5,3). This positions the snake adjacent to (5,4) for eating next turn. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 42**: Move U to (5,4) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 43**: Move U to (5,5). This moves toward (6,6) and avoids the body. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 44**: Move R to (6,5). This positions the snake adjacent to (6,6). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 45**: Move U to (6,6) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases). Direction becomes U.\n\nThis sequence scores 2 points and ensures survival for at least 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: R (right)  \nTurn 42: U (up)  \nTurn 43: U (up)  \nTurn 44: R (right)  \nTurn 45: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 42. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,3), then body segments: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). The head direction is right (R), so the snake was moving right to get to (5,3) from, say, (4,3), but since the head is at (5,3) and direction is R, it must have come from left, so previous head was (4,3), and now it moved right to (5,3).\n\nSnake positions list: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]. So head at (5,3), tail at (3,5). The direction is R, meaning the snake is facing right.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (5,4) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n\nI need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo cells: (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (0,0) to (7,0) wall, (0,7) to (7,7) wall. And (5,2) is blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked, so (5,2) cannot be moved to.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (5,3) head\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (3,5) tail\n\nNow, the snake head is at (5,3) facing right (R). So possible moves: since direction is R, it can go U, D, R, but not L because L would be opposite to R, and it says \"no instant reverse\", so cannot move left immediately after moving right.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so next move cannot be L (left), because that would be opposite. So possible moves: U (up, to (5,4)), D (down, to (5,2)), R (right, to (6,3)).\n\nBut (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move down to (5,2). And (6,3) is within bounds, x=6, y=3, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok, y=3 is between 1 and 6, so (6,3) should be free? Let's see what's at (6,3).\n\nIs (6,3) occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), etc., but (6,3) is not in the list. Walls: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not wall except borders, borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine. Internal obstacles only (5,2), so (6,3) should be empty and safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): is it occupied? Food is at (5,4), but snake is not there. Snake has positions, (5,3) is head, but (5,4) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, but food is there.\n\n(5,4) has food, so it's not occupied by snake body, but we can move there to eat food.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,3) with direction R:\n\n- U: to (5,4) - which has food, and y+1, so (5,4)\n\n- D: to (5,2) - but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n\n- R: to (6,3) - empty cell, I think.\n\n- L: to (4,3) - but (4,3) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail? Tail is at (3,5), so (4,3) is body segment, so moving left to (4,3) would cause collision because head touches body.\n\nRule: deadly collisions include body collision, head touches any body segment.\n\nBut exception: can move into tail if the tail moves away, but only if it's the current tail position.\n\nGeneral rule: you can move into the cell that will be vacated by the tail, because the tail moves forward.\n\nIn this case, from (5,3), moving left to (4,3): (4,3) is currently occupied by the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,5), which is different.\n\nSo (4,3) is a body segment, so moving to (4,3) would cause head to collide with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (5,2) is wall, death.\n\nSo only possible moves are U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nU to (5,4): (5,4) has food, positive, value 1.\n\nR to (6,3): empty cell.\n\nNow, if I move U to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (5,4), and tail doesn't move? When you eat, you grow, so the tail stays, and you add a new segment.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nMovement: each turn, snake moves one step, head to new cell, tail moves one step unless food eaten.\n\nSpecifically: when you move to a cell with food, you eat it, and if positive, snake grows, so tail remains, and a new segment is added at the head position. So effectively, after move, head is at new position, and tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nIf no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next, so length same.\n\nHere, if I move to (5,4), which has food, positive, so I eat it, snake grows: new head at (5,4), body now includes the old head (5,3) as new segment, and tail stays, so positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), then (4,3), etc., and tail still at (3,5) for now, but since we ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] after move. But (3,5) is tail, and since we ate, tail doesn't advance, so it stays.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the segment count increases.\n\nCurrent snake has 11 segments? Positions: 11 positions listed, so length 11.\n\nAfter eating, length 12.\n\nIf I move to (6,3), no food, so head moves to (6,3), tail moves to next, which is (4,3) or something? Let's see current positions: indices: head at 0: (5,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (1,3), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (3,5) tail.\n\nIf move to (6,3) no eat: head to (6,3), tail moves off (3,5), so new positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] and tail was (3,5), now removed, so new tail is (3,6).\n\nPositions: after move, head to new position, each segment moves to next position.\n\nSo new head: (6,3) if move R.\n\nThen body: old head (5,3) becomes segment 1, (4,3) segment 2, ..., down to (3,6) which was segment 9, now segment 10, and (3,5) tail is gone. Old segment 10: (3,5) is tail, removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] length 11 same.\n\nBut (3,6) is now tail.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (5,4) and eat: head to (5,4), old head (5,3) becomes new segment 1, then (4,3) segment 2, ..., up to (3,5) segment 11, and since ate, tail stays, so new segment 12 at the end? No.\n\nWhen you eat, you add a new segment at the position where the tail was? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new head position is added, and the tail remains, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: after moving to food cell, head is at new position, the previous head position is now body, and the tail position remains, so we add a new segment at the tail end? No.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nLet me think: before move, positions: S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H is head, T is tail.\n\nAfter move to empty cell: new head at new position, then [H, B1, B2, ..., T] becomes [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where Bk was the one before tail, so tail T is removed.\n\nAfter move to food cell: new head at food position, then [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and since ate, tail doesn't move, so T stays, so positions are [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so length increased by one, with T still there.\n\nIn this case, if move to (5,4) and eat: new head (5,4), then previous head (5,3) is now first body, then (4,3), (3,3), ..., down to (3,5) tail. So positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] so (3,5) is still tail, and new segment is added? From 11 to 12 positions.\n\nYes, (3,5) was tail, now it's still there, and the head moved, so we have one more segment.\n\nSimilarly, in no eat case, tail moves off.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nFrom (5,3), only U and R possible.\n\nU: to (5,4) with food, eat, grow, score +1.\n\nR: to (6,3) empty, no eat.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life span: (5,4) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns including current, so on turn 42, if not eaten, life span decreases to 5, and so on, until 0 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 8.\n\nBut since turn 42, (5,4) will disappear after turn 42+5? Life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current turn.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's see.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, life span L, after this turn, countdown to L-1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L:\n\n- At turn t, countdown = L\n\n- After turn t, countdown = L-1 (if not eaten)\n\n- ...\n\n- When countdown = 1, after that turn, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nIt disappears after N turns, meaning at the start of turn t + N, it is gone? But \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the beginning of turn, if countdown >0, food exists, after the turn, countdown decreases by 1, and if it reaches 0, food disappears.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might mean that it exists for N turns including the current one.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's interpret from the text.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\".\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span N.\n\nAfter turn t is processed, countdown decreases to N-1.\n\nIf countdown becomes 0, food disappears.\n\nSo if N=1, at turn t, it is there, after turn t, countdown to 0, disappears.\n\nIf N=2, at turn t, countdown 2, after turn t, countdown 1, still there; after turn t+1, countdown 0, disappears.\n\nSo food with life span N will disappear after N turns, meaning it is present for N turns: from turn t to t + N - 1.\n\nFor example, N=1: present only on turn t, disappears after turn t (before turn t+1).\n\nN=2: present on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, here (5,4) life span 6 at turn 42, so it will be present from turn 42 to 42+5=47? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 42, life span 6, so it exists for 6 turns: 42,43,44,45,46,47. After turn 47, countdown to 0, disappears before turn 48.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 8, exists from turn 42 to 49.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nCurrent turn 42, head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I go U to (5,4), I eat the food immediately, get +1 score, snake grows to length 12.\n\nThen new head at (5,4), and since I moved up, new direction is U.\n\nThen from there, I need to move next.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3), no eat, head to (6,3), direction now R (since moved right).\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut I should think about risks and opportunities.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,6), which I might want to get later.\n\nBut (5,4) has shorter life, only 6 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n\nLife span 6 from turn 42, so it will be gone after turn 47, so I have until turn 47 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) until turn 49.\n\nNow, the snake is long, and the grid has walls and obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends or collisions.\n\nLet me map out the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, but walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nAvailable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake occupies: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with head at (5,3).\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (5,4) has food, (6,3) free, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) has food, etc.\n\nAlso, (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), but (4,6) is not occupied? Snake has (3,6) and (2,6), but (4,6) is free? Let's list all free cells.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, minus walls: walls are borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so inside x=1-6 y=1-6 all available except (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSnake occupies: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,3), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nAnd (3,5) is tail, (3,6) is body.\n\nSo free cells: (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4) food, (5,5), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) food, and also (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2) but (4,2) is not wall? (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) is free? Walls: only borders and (5,2), so (4,2) should be free, but is it occupied? Snake no, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so not available.\n\nNow, food at (5,4) and (6,6).\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), eat food, new head (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), but (5,3) is now body, since after move, (5,3) is segment, so cannot move down to (5,3), collision.\n\nL to (4,4), or R to (6,4).\n\nAnd cannot move D because it would be reverse? Direction is U, so moving D would be opposite, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,4) with direction U, possible moves: U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nAll might be free; (5,5) should be free, (4,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3) on turn 42, no eat, head to (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, cannot, L to (5,3) but (5,3) is now body? After moving to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), etc., so (5,3) is body, cannot move left to (5,3).\n\nDirection R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\nSo possible: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or R to (7,3) but wall, impossible. So only U or D.\n\n(6,2) might be free, (6,4) free.\n\nNow, I need to plan for multiple turns to maximize score.\n\nThere is a risk with the tail. Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (3,5), and food at (5,4) and (6,6), not on tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut if in future, tail has food, need to be careful.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both foods if possible.\n\n(5,4) is close, life span short, so better to eat it soon.\n\n(6,6) is farther, life span longer.\n\nBut if I eat (5,4) now, I grow, which might make maneuvering harder later.\n\nBut since grid has space, maybe ok.\n\nLet's simulate both options.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,4) on turn 42, eat food.\n\nTurn 42: move U to (5,4), eat, score +1, snake grows to 12 segments.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail. Direction U.\n\nNow turn 43: from (5,4), direction U, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n- U to (5,5): free? (5,5) should be free.\n\n- L to (4,4): free\n\n- R to (6,4): free\n\nD not possible, reverse.\n\nI need to go towards (6,6) or other.\n\nBut also, after eating, the tail is at (3,5), and we have to move.\n\nPerhaps I can go right to (6,4) to approach (6,6).\n\nOr up to (5,5).\n\nSince direction U, moving R to (6,4) might be ok.\n\nLet's say I move R to (6,4) on turn 43.\n\nThen head to (6,4), no food there, so move, no eat, tail moves.\n\nOld tail (3,5) moves off, so positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to (3,6) which was before tail, now tail is (3,6)? After turn 42, positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nAfter turn 43 move to (6,4) no eat: head to (6,4), then body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), and tail (3,5) removed, so new positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] tail at (3,6).\n\nDirection now R? Moved right, so direction R.\n\nNow head at (6,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), R to (7,4) wall, impossible, L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\n(6,5) might have food? No, food at (6,6), so (6,5) free.\n\n(6,3) free.\n\nSay move U to (6,5) on turn 44.\n\nNo food, so head to (6,5), tail moves off (3,6), new tail (2,6)? Positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., (2,6), and (3,6) removed? After previous: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nMove to (6,5): head to (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), tail (3,6) removed, so new tail (2,6)? Positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] so tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection U? Moved up, so direction U.\n\nNow turn 45: head at (6,5), direction U, possible moves: U to (6,6), which has food, L to (5,5), D to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision, cannot, R to (7,5) wall, impossible.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nU to (6,6) has food, positive, so eat it.\n\nL to (5,5) free.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), eat food, score +1, grow to length 13.\n\nThen new head (6,6), and tail stays, so positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., (2,6) and old tail (2,6) stays? After move: positions before move: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nMove to (6,6) and eat: new head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] and since ate, tail (2,6) stays, so length 13, tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIn this path, by turn 45, I ate both foods, score +2.\n\nBut is this safe? In the moves, no collision, so it seems possible.\n\nBut on turn 45, when at (6,5), I could go L to (5,5) instead, but then I might not get the food immediately, but it has life span, but since life span 8 from 42, to 49, so plenty of time.\n\nBut in this case, by going directly, I get both quickly.\n\nNow, what about the first option where I didn't eat (5,4) immediately.\n\nOption 2: on turn 42, move R to (6,3) instead of U.\n\nTurn 42: move R to (6,3), no eat, so head to (6,3), positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] tail at (3,6) since (3,5) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 43: from (6,3), direction R, possible moves U or D only, as before.\n\nSay move U to (6,4), no food? (6,4) free, so head to (6,4), positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]? After move: head to (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), etc., down to (3,6), tail was (3,6), removed? Previous positions turn 42: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] tail (3,6).\n\nMove to (6,4) no eat: head to (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), and tail (3,6) removed, so new positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection U? Moved up, so direction U.\n\nNow head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, cannot, L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall, impossible.\n\nSo only U to (6,5).\n\nMust move U to (6,5).\n\nTurn 44: move U to (6,5), no food, so head to (6,5), positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] tail at (2,6)? After previous: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] 11 positions.\n\nMove to (6,5): head to (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (1,6), (2,6), tail (2,6) removed? Positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] new tail at (1,6).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow turn 45: head at (6,5), direction U, possible moves U to (6,6) with food, or L to (5,5), or D to (6,4) body, cannot, R wall.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf U to (6,6), eat food, score +1, grow.\n\nPositions before: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nMove to (6,6) eat: new head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), ..., (1,6), and since ate, tail (1,6) stays, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] length 12, tail at (1,6).\n\nNow, I have (5,4) food still, life span 6, from turn 42, so at turn 45, it has been 3 turns, countdown decreased to 3? Turn 42: life 6, after turn 42, if not eaten, life 5; turn 43, life 4; turn 44, life 3; turn 45, life 2, so still there until turn 47.\n\nBut now head at (6,6), and (5,4) is at (5,4), which is not adjacent.\n\nTo get to (5,4), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (6,6), direction U, possible moves: U not possible, wall or out, y=6, U to y=7 wall, so cannot U.\n\nD to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, cannot.\n\nL to (5,6), or R to (7,6) wall, impossible.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) should be free.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,6), no food, so head to (5,6), positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] tail at (1,5)? After move: previous positions [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nMove to (5,6) no eat: head to (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), tail (1,6) removed, so new positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] tail at (1,5).\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow head at (5,6), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) y=7 wall, impossible; D to (5,5); L to (4,6); R to (6,6) but (6,6) is body, cannot.\n\nCannot U or R, so only D or L.\n\nD to (5,5), L to (4,6).\n\nSay move D to (5,5) on turn 47.\n\n(5,5) free, no food, head to (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] tail at (1,4).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, (5,4) food is at (5,4), which is below (5,5), but direction is D, so moving D to (5,4) is possible? From (5,5), direction D, possible moves: D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, cannot, U to (5,6) body, cannot.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nD to (5,4) has food, but life span: at turn 47, it should still be there? Life span 6 from 42, after 42:5, 43:4, 44:3, 45:2, 46:1, after turn 46, countdown to 1, after turn 47, it disappears? Let's see.\n\nTurn 42: food (5,4) life span 6, countdown=6.\n\nAfter turn 42, if not eaten, countdown=5.\n\nAfter turn 43, countdown=4.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 46, countdown=1.\n\nAfter turn 47, countdown=0, food disappears before turn 48? But during turn 47, if we move to it, can we eat?\n\nThe food exists as long as countdown >0.\n\nAt the start of turn, if countdown >=1, food is present.\n\nAfter the turn, countdown decreases by 1.\n\nSo at turn 47, if countdown before turn is 1, food is present. If we move to it during turn 47, we eat it. After turn, countdown decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 47, (5,4) has countdown=1, so it is present and can be eaten if moved to.\n\nIn this case, on turn 47, head at (5,5), direction D, move D to (5,4), eat food, score +1.\n\nThen we get it.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (6,6) on turn 45 and (5,4) on turn 47, so both eaten.\n\nCompared to first option, I ate both earlier.\n\nBut in first option, I ate (5,4) on 42 and (6,6) on 45, so turn 42 and 45.\n\nIn second, (6,6) on 45 and (5,4) on 47.\n\nBut in second option, when I moved R first, I had to go through more steps, and almost missed (5,4), but got it just in time.\n\nIn terms of score, both get +2, but first option gets first point earlier, but since we maximize score, same.\n\nBut in first option, when I ate (5,4) on 42, I grew immediately, which might be riskier, but in this case, it worked.\n\nIn the second option, when I went to (6,3) first, on turn 43 I had only U or D, I chose U to (6,4), then must to (6,5), then to (6,6), so it was forced in a way.\n\nBut if I had moved D to (6,2) on turn 43, for example.\n\nTurn 42: move R to (6,3), positions as before.\n\nTurn 43: from (6,3), direction R, move D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) should be free, no food.\n\nHead to (6,2), positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]?

After previous: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]\n\nMove to (4,2): head to (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4) removed, so positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] tail at (1,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen (5,4) is at (5,4), from (4,2), I can go to (4,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, or (4,4) etc., but (5,4) is above, but I need to go to (5,4) directly or via (4,4).\n\nBut on turn 48, (5,4) is gone, since after turn 47, countdown=0.\n\nAt turn 47, head at (4,2), if I could move to (5,4), but not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? Positions: (4,3) is occupied, in the list, (5,3), (4,3) are both body segments.\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so cannot move to (4,3).\n\nD to (4,1) body, cannot.\n\nL to (3,2), or R to (5,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (3,2) or U but U to (4,3) occupied.\n\n(4,3) is at position, let's see: in positions, (4,3) is segment, so moving U to (4,3) collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (4,1) body.\n\nSo only L to (3,2) or possibly other, but only L.\n\nMove L to (3,2) on turn 48, but (5,4) already gone.\n\nAnd (6,6) still there, but I am at (3,2), far away.\n\nSo in this path, if I go down, I miss the (5,4) food and only get (6,6) if I can, but I have (6,6) only if I go up earlier.\n\nIn this branch, I only got (6,6) if I ate it, but in this down path, I didn't go to (6,6).\n\nIn the first sub-option, when I went up, I got both, but with risk of missing (5,4) if delayed.\n\nBut in the direct up path for option 2, I got both.\n\nNow back to option 1, eating (5,4) first seems better because it's consumed early, and I can still get to (6,6).\n\nMoreover, in option 1, after eating (5,4), I was at (5,4) with direction U, and I moved to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (6,6), all fine.\n\nBut when I moved to (6,4) on turn 43, from (5,4) with direction U, I moved R to (6,4), which is not reverse, ok.\n\nThen direction R, then U to (6,5), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut is there a risk with the tail or something?\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) is under the snake? No, currently at turn 42, snake head is at (5,3), food at (5,4), which is adjacent but not under snake body.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nBut here, (5,4) is not under body, it's free, so can be eaten directly.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, to think long-term, after eating both, I need to survive, but since no more food mentioned, and the goal is to maximize score, which is from eating food, so after eating both, I can just move around to survive, but since no negative food or other, I can survive indefinitely if I don't hit wall or body.\n\nBut with walls, I need to be careful.\n\nIn this grid, with the snake position, after eating both, I have a long snake, and the grid has limited space.\n\nFor example, after eating both in option 1, at turn 45, head at (6,6), positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] tail at (2,6).\n\nNow, from (6,6), direction U, but U to (6,7) wall, impossible; D to (6,5) body; L to (5,6); R wall.\n\nSo move L to (5,6), as before.\n\nThen to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut the left part is occupied, so I need to navigate carefully.\n\nBut since I need to plan only 5+ turns ahead, and for the immediate action, I should choose the one that allows me to eat both safely.\n\nIn both options, I can eat both, but in option 1, I eat earlier and have more time to react.\n\nMoreover, in option 2, if I go R first, I might be forced into a corner or something.\n\nFor example, at (6,3), if I go down, I ended up in a bad position.\n\nBut if I go up, it was ok.\n\nBut to prioritize survival, eating (5,4) first might be better because it's low risk and I get the point.\n\nAlso, if I don't eat it, and something happens, I might miss it.\n\nLife span 6 turns, but I can eat it later.\n\nFor instance, from current, if I go R to (6,3), then on turn 43 I can go U to (6,4), then to (6,5), then on turn 45 to (6,6) eat, then I can go back to (5,4).\n\nBut as before, I can reach (5,4) by turn 47.\n\nBut in that case, I have the same score.\n\nBut with the snake longer earlier in option 1, it might be harder to move, but in this grid, it should be manageable.\n\nAnother risk: when I am at (6,5) on turn 44 or something, if the tail is near, but in this case, tail is far.\n\nSpecifically, in the tail reward danger, only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail doesn't have food.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, both actions seem possible, but moving U to eat (5,4) immediately is efficient and safe.\n\nMoreover, it might allow me to get to other areas faster.\n\nBut since no other food, it should be fine.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn 42, 43, 44, etc., up to 5+ turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the future depends on choices, I should plan a sequence.\n\nFor turn 42, I choose to move U to eat the food.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can go towards (6,6).\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nTurn 42: U to (5,4) eat food.\n\nNew head (5,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 43: from (5,4), direction U, I can move R to (6,4) to approach (6,6).\n\nMove R to (6,4), no eat.\n\nNew head (6,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 44: from (6,4), direction R, possible U or D.\n\nI need to go to (6,6), so U to (6,5).\n\nMove U to (6,5), no eat.\n\nNew head (6,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 45: from (6,5), direction U, move U to (6,6) eat food.\n\nScore +1.\n\nNow, turn 46: head at (6,6), direction U, but cannot U, so move L to (5,6), no food.\n\nThen turn 47: from (5,6), direction L, move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6), etc., but no more food, so I can choose any safe move.\n\nSince I need to output only for 5+ turns, I can output up to say turn 46 or 47.\n\nt1=42, so turns 42,43,44,45,46 for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 42 to 46 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 42,43,44,45,46: that's 5 turns.\n\nSince I ate both by turn 45, turn 46 is after.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: R (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 44: U (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 45: U (to (6,6) eat)\n\nThen turn 46: need to move from (6,6), say L to (5,6)\n\nBut I should confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nIn turn 43, from (5,4) direction U, I moved R to (6,4). Is that possible? Yes, no reverse, not opposite.\n\nThen turn 44, from (6,4) direction R, move U to (6,5), not reverse.\n\nTurn 45, from (6,5) direction U, move U to (6,6), eat.\n\nThen turn 46, from (6,6) direction U, but U impossible, D to (6,5) body, so must move L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) should be free, as before.\n\nMove L to (5,6).\n\nThen direction L.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut the action is for the turn, so for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, turn 43 action is R, but I need to specify the direction.\n\nNow, to be complete, I can output up to turn 46.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no more, but to survive, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nBut for the plan, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but here both are positive.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which I avoided.\n\nIn this path, I didn't go near it.\n\nSo I think moving U on turn 42 is good.\n\nBut let's see the initial direction: head direction is R, and I move U, which is perpendicular, ok.\n\nIf I move R to (6,3), then I have to go up later, but it might take more turns to get (5,4).\n\nFor example, after getting (6,6), I go to (5,6), (5,5), then (5,4), but as before.\n\nBut in that case, on turn 42: R\n\nTurn 43: U (to (6,4))\n\nIn option 2, turn 42: R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 43: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 44: U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 45: U to (6,6) eat\n\nThen turn 46: L to (5,6)\n\nTurn 47: D to (5,5) or something, then to (5,4) on turn 47.\n\nBut for the sequence up to turn 46, I only have one food eaten if I start with R.\n\nIn turn 45 I eat (6,6), but (5,4) not eaten yet.\n\nWhereas with U first, I eat both by turn 45.\n\nSo for the 5-turn plan, with U first, I can eat two foods, with R first, only one by turn 46.\n\nTurn 42 to 46: 5 actions.\n\nWith U: turn 42 eat (5,4), turn 45 eat (6,6) on turn 45 action.\n\nTurn 45 action eats (6,6).\n\nWith R: turn 42 no eat, turn 43 no, turn 44 no, turn 45 eat (6,6), turn 46 no, so only one food eaten in the first 5 turns? Turns 42 to 46 inclusive is 5 turns: 42,43,44,45,46.\n\nActions: 42: move, 43: move, 44: move, 45: move, 46: move.\n\nWith U first: on move 42, eat (5,4); on move 45, eat (6,6); so two eats.\n\nWith R first: on move 45, eat (6,6), but (5,4) not eaten until later, so only one eat in these five moves.\n\nTherefore, to maximize score, better to eat (5,4) immediately.\n\nMoreover, it might be safer to reduce risk of missing it.\n\nSo I think moving U on turn 42 is the best.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: R (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 44: U (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 45: U (to (6,6) eat)\n\nTurn 46: L (to (5,6))\n\nFor turn 46, moving L to (5,6) is necessary and safe.\n\nThen beyond, I can continue, but for the output, since it says \"...\" I can stop after a few, but to be safe, I'll output 5 actions.\n\nNow, about the direction: after each move, the direction changes, but for the action choice, it's based on the current state.\n\nIn the output, I just need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nAlso, in turn 43, when I move R from (5,4), the direction was U, and I move R, which is ok.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nTo confirm the grid: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are all within bounds, not walls, and not occupied when I move to them.\n\nIn turn 43, when moving to (6,4), from (5,4), (6,4) should be free, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) free, (6,6) has food.\n\n(5,6) free.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive foods while ensuring long-term survival, the AI plans 5+ turns ahead. The current state (turn 42) has the snake head at (5,3) facing right (R), with two positive foods: (5,4) with life span 6 and (6,6) with life span 8. The food at (5,4) must be eaten soon due to its shorter life span (disappears after turn 47), while (6,6) can be eaten later. Moving up (U) to (5,4) on turn 42 allows immediate consumption of the first food, avoiding the risk of missing it. Then, the snake can navigate towards (6,6) to eat it by turn 45. This path avoids collisions and walls, leveraging the grid layout and snake position for efficiency.\n\nThe grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake's initial positions are [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)], with the tail at (3,5). After eating, the snake grows, so pathing must account for increased length.\n\n### Key Risks and Mitigation:\n- **Collision avoidance**: The snake must not hit walls, the obstacle at (5,2), or its body. Moving down (D) from (5,3) is impossible due to the obstacle. Moving left (L) would cause body collision. Thus, only U or R are safe on turn 42.\n- **Food timing**: (5,4) must be eaten by turn 47; (6,6) by turn 49. Eating (5,4) first ensures it is not missed.\n- **Tail reward danger**: No food is on the tail initially, so this is not an immediate risk. Future moves avoid positioning where the head is adjacent to the tail with food.\n- **Movement constraints**: No instant reverse (e.g., from R, cannot move L next). Directions are updated after each move to ensure valid actions.\n\n### Plan for Turns 42-46 (5+ turns):\n1. **Turn 42**: Move U (up) to (5,4). This eats the positive food (+1 score), grows the snake to length 12, and sets direction to U. Positions: head (5,4), body [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)].\n2. **Turn 43**: Move R (right) to (6,4). No food, so snake moves normally. Tail moves, setting direction to R. Positions: head (6,4), body [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)].\n3. **Turn 44**: Move U (up) to (6,5). No food, normal move. Direction set to U. Positions: head (6,5), body [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)].\n4. **Turn 45**: Move U (up) to (6,6). Eats positive food (+1 score), grows to length 13. Direction remains U. Positions: head (6,6), body [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)].\n5. **Turn 46**: Move L (left) to (5,6). No food, normal move. Direction set to L. Positions: head (5,6), body [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)].\n\n### Why this plan maximizes score and ensures survival:\n- **Score**: Both foods are eaten by turn 45, yielding +2 score. No negative food exists, so no penalties.\n- **Efficiency**: (5,4) is eaten immediately, avoiding life span risk. (6,6) is eaten quickly via a direct path.\n- **Survival**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions:\n  - Turn 42: U to (5,4) is safe; no body or wall.\n  - Turn 43: R to (6,4) is safe; cell is free.\n  - Turn 44: U to (6,5) is safe; cell is free.\n  - Turn 45: U to (6,6) is safe; eats food.\n  - Turn 46: L to (5,6) is safe; no reverse (from U, L is perpendicular) and cell is free.\n- **Long-term**: Beyond turn 46, the snake can navigate open areas (e.g., move down or left from (5,6)) to avoid dead ends. The grid has free cells (e.g., (4,6), (5,5), (4,5)), allowing safe movement indefinitely with no food risks.\n\nThis plan prioritizes eating high-value food early and maintains flexibility for future survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 43: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 44: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 45: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 46: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 43. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), and tail at (3,5). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (1,3)\n\n- Segment 6: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (1,6)\n\n- Segment 9: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 10: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 11: (3,5)  // tail\n\nThe snake has 12 segments? Let's count: positions given are 12 points. From (5,4) to (3,5), that's 12 cells. But the last one is (3,5), which is the tail.\n\nSnake head direction is U, meaning up. So it's moving upwards.\n\nFood:\n\n- One at (6,6) with value 1 and life span 7. Value is +1 since it says value1=1, and it's positive food.\n\n- Another at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 10. But (3,5) is the current tail position of the snake.\n\nFood at (3,5) is under the snake's tail. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nSpecifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo cells:\n\n- (0,y) for all y are walls\n\n- (7,y) for all y are walls\n\n- (x,0) for all x are walls\n\n- (x,7) for all x are walls\n\n- And (5,2) is a wall.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is the tail.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,6): value +1, life span 7\n\n- (3,5): value +1, life span 10, but currently occupied by tail.\n\nCurrent turn is 43, so food at (6,6) has life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, including this one, so at turn 43 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (6,6), life_span=7 at turn 43. After turn 43, countdown to 6, then 5, ..., down to 0, and disappears after turn when countdown reaches 0. So it will be available until turn 43 + 7 - 1 = 49? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t, life_span = L, then:\n\n- Turn t: countdown L\n\n- Turn t+1: countdown L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + (L-1): countdown 1\n\n- Turn t + L: countdown 0, disappears before turn or after? The countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – so after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 43, life_span=7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning at the start of turn 50 or something? I need to be precise.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn 43, countdown is 7.\n\nAfter turn 43, countdown becomes 6.\n\nAfter turn 44, countdown 5, and so on.\n\nAfter turn 49, countdown becomes 0, and then it disappears, so it is not available on turn 50.\n\nIt is available on turns when countdown > 0.\n\nSo for (6,6): available from turn 43 to turn 49 (countdown from 7 to 1, disappears after turn 49).\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,5): life_span=10 at turn 43, so available from turn 43 to turn 52 (countdown 10 to 1, disappears after turn 52).\n\nBut (3,5) is currently occupied by the tail, so it can't be eaten now.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,4), direction U (up). So last move was up to (5,4) from (5,3)? Positions: head (5,4), next is (5,3), so yes, it just moved up to (5,4).\n\nCurrent direction is U, so it can move U, L, or R, but not D, because that would be instant reverse. Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D. So cannot move down. Can move up, left, or right.\n\nPossible moves from (5,4):\n\n- Up (U): to (5,5)\n\n- Down (D): but not allowed, reverse.\n\n- Left (L): to (4,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (6,4)\n\nNow, check for collisions or walls.\n\nFirst, walls: borders, so (5,5): x=5, y=5, between 0 and 7, not border. (4,4) same. (6,4): x=6, y=4, not border. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\nNow, body segments: snake positions: (5,4) is head, so moving to (5,5), is (5,5) occupied? List all positions: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\n(5,5) is not in this list, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): not in list.\n\n(6,4): not in list.\n\n(3,5) is tail, but we're not moving there directly.\n\nSo all three moves are possible: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFood available: (6,6) and (3,5), but (3,5) is under tail.\n\nFirst, (3,5) is food, but occupied. To eat it, the tail must move away, then head move to it.\n\nTail is at (3,5), and when snake moves, tail will move, but only if snake doesn't eat, because if it eats, tail stays, and snake grows.\n\nSnake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from old tail cell.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn this case, for food at (3,5), since it's under tail, if the snake eats a food elsewhere, the tail might stay or move.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,5) with food. If the snake does not eat any food on this move, when it moves, the tail will leave (3,5), so the food becomes exposed. Then later, head can move to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it causes collision.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to the tail cell when food is there, after eating, the head is there, and since snake grows, the new tail is added, but the old tail was there, and head is now there, but when you eat, head moves to food cell, and since it was tail, but tail moves away only if not eating.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nCase: head moves to a cell that has food under the tail.\n\nAt that moment, when head moves to (3,5), which is the current tail position.\n\nBut when head moves there, it eats the food, so snake grows. The cell (3,5) was occupied by tail, but now head is there, and since food is eaten, tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, but now it's not tail, and a new tail is... I'm confused.\n\nSnake segments: before move, positions: S0=head, S1, S2, ..., S_k=tail.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating: new head at new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one before, so tail moves away.\n\nWhen snake eats: new head at food position, all segments stay, but a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail cell is vacated.\n\nWhen eat, head moves to food, food is consumed, tail does not move, so the tail cell is still occupied, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose snake positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nAfter move to new cell without eating: new positions: new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., up to the second last, so T is left.\n\nAfter move with eating: head moves to food cell, say F, which is not occupied (usually), then new positions: F (new head), H, B1, B2, ..., T, so T remains, and snake grows by one, so tail is now T, which was tail before.\n\nBut if F is occupied, it can't be, except in this special case where food is under body.\n\nIn this case, food at (3,5) is under tail T.\n\nIf head moves directly to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied by tail, so normally, moving to an occupied cell is collision, but the rule says it can be eaten if body moves away first.\n\nThe rule: \"only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo it must be that on the turn when head moves to the cell, that cell is not occupied by body anymore; it must be free.\n\nTherefore, for (3,5), we cannot eat it now because it's occupied. First, the snake must move so that the tail leaves (3,5), exposing the food, then later head can move to it.\n\nSimilarly, the Tail Reward Danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nThis is a specific scenario.\n\nSuppose tail is at T, with food on T.\n\nHead is adjacent to T, meaning |head - tail| = 1 in grid.\n\nIf head moves to T to eat the food, then after eating: head is now at T, and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the segment that was at T is now the new second last? Let's see positions.\n\nBefore move: positions: H (head), B1, B2, ..., Bk, T (tail)\n\nHead adjacent to T.\n\nHead moves to T, which has food.\n\nAfter move: head moves to T, eats food, so new head is at T. The old head H becomes new segment after head. The tail T does not move, so positions: T (new head), H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, and since food eaten, a new segment is added? No, when food eaten, the tail stays, so the snake grows, meaning the tail remains and a new segment is added at the end.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments shift, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one cell at the tail position.\n\nBut in terms of positions: suppose before eat, positions: P0=H, P1, P2, ..., Pn=T\n\nAfter moving to food F without collision: new positions: F, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pn\n\nSo the tail is still at Pn, and snake length increases.\n\nIn this case, F is T, so moving to T.\n\nBefore: P0=H, P1, ..., Pn=T\n\nAfter: T (new head), P0, P1, ..., Pn-1, Pn? No.\n\nWhen head moves to F, new head is F, then the old head becomes the first body segment, and so on, up to the old tail, which remains as the tail if no eat, but with eat, the old tail remains and becomes part of the body, and since tail doesn't move, it stays, so the position Pn is still occupied, but now by the last body segment, and a new tail is not added; the snake just has one more segment.\n\nPositions after eating: the new position is F, then the entire old snake positions, so [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pn]\n\nSo the old tail Pn is now the second last segment, and there is no new cell added yet; the growth means that the next time the snake moves without eating, the tail won't move, but immediately after eating, the positions include all old segments plus the head at F.\n\nSince F was occupied, in this case F=T, so [T, P0, P1, ..., Pn]\n\nBut Pn is T, so positions: T, P0, P1, ..., Pn-1, Pn\n\nBut Pn = T, so the cell T is occupied twice? No, in the list, Pn is the same as T, so it's duplicate.\n\nThat's the problem.\n\nFor example, if head is at H, tail at T, H adjacent to T.\n\nIf head moves to T to eat food, new positions: new head at T, then old head H, then the body segments, and old tail T.\n\nBut old tail T is still there, so positions include T (new head), H, ..., and T (old tail), so cell T has both new head and old tail? That's collision.\n\nIn the sequence: the new head is at T, then the next segment is at old head H, then the next at old first body, and so on, up to old tail at T, but the old tail is at T, and new head is also at T, so at the same cell, which is collision.\n\nTherefore, moving head to the tail cell when it has food causes the head to be at the same position as the old tail in the new configuration, so immediate collision and death.\n\nThat's why the Tail Reward Danger exists.\n\nIn this case, for food at (3,5), which is tail, we can only eat it if the head is not adjacent when we move to it, so that after the tail moves away, the cell is free, then head moves to it.\n\nBut in this state, head is at (5,4), tail at (3,5). What's the distance?\n\n(5,4) to (3,5): Δx=2, Δy=1, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so |Δx| + |Δy| =1? In grid, adjacent usually means Manhattan distance 1, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(5,4) to (3,5): not adjacent; for example, (4,4) or (5,5) would be adjacent to head.\n\nCurrent head (5,4), adjacent cells: (5,5) up, (5,3) down but occupied, (4,4) left, (6,4) right.\n\nTail at (3,5), which is not adjacent to head; (3,5) is two left and one up from head? Head (5,4), to (3,5) is left 2, up 1, so not adjacent.\n\nTo be adjacent, it would need to be like (4,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) is not adjacent to (5,4).\n\nSo currently, head is not adjacent to tail, so when we eat the food at (3,5), it should be safe, but only after the tail moves away.\n\nNow, back to current turn.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nI need to think about getting the foods.\n\nFood at (6,6) is at the bottom right, and (3,5) is at the tail.\n\nAlso, life spans: (6,6) has life span 7, so available until turn 49 (countdown from 7 at t43 to 1 at t49, gone at t50).\n\n(3,5) has life span 10, so available until turn 52 (countdown 10 at t43 to 1 at t52, gone at t53).\n\nBut (3,5) is currently occupied, so we need to expose it first.\n\nTo expose (3,5), we need the tail to move away, which happens when the snake moves without eating food. If we eat food, tail stays, so (3,5) remains occupied.\n\nCurrently, if we move without eating, tail will move from (3,5) to somewhere.\n\nLet's simulate the snake movement.\n\nCurrent positions: let's index them for clarity.\n\nLabel segments:\n\n0: head (5,4)\n\n1: (5,3)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (3,3)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (1,4)\n\n7: (1,5)\n\n8: (1,6)\n\n9: (2,6)\n\n10: (3,6)\n\n11: tail (3,5)\n\nIf we move without eating, to a new cell, say new_head, then new positions: new_head, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10  (since 11 is tail and not included, so positions 0 to 10, with new head, and tail was 11, so gone.\n\nOld positions: 0 to 11.\n\nAfter move without eat: new head, then 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nSo the tail (11) is left, and segment 10 becomes the new tail.\n\nIn this case, segment 10 is (3,6), which was the second last.\n\nAfter move, new tail is the old segment 10, which is (3,6).\n\nAnd the old tail (3,5) is vacated.\n\nNow, since food is at (3,5), when we move, the tail leaves, so (3,5) is now free with food, and can be eaten if head moves there later.\n\nBut now, head is at (5,4), not close to (3,5).\n\nIf we eat food on this move, we need to move to a food cell.\n\nFood cells: (6,6) and (3,5), but (3,5) occupied, so only (6,6) is available to eat if we move to it.\n\n(6,6) is not adjacent to head; head at (5,4), (6,6) is down-right, not adjacent.\n\nTo move to (6,6) from (5,4), we need to go right then up, or up then right, etc.\n\nPossible moves now: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nNone of these is food, so if we move to any, we don't eat, so tail moves from (3,5), exposing the food at (3,5).\n\nThen, the food at (3,5) is now available to eat.\n\nBut head is not adjacent to it, so we can plan to go there.\n\nFirst, let's think about the grid and possible paths.\n\nGrid walls: borders, so we can only move within x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except where obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since borders at 0 and 7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow, let's sketch the grid.\n\ny=6: top row, walls at y=7, so y=6 is the top row of playable area.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 wall, so y=1 bottom.\n\nx=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, so x=1 to 6 playable.\n\nSo cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is wall.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead at (5,4)\n\nBody: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), tail at (3,5)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with a loop.\n\nFrom head (5,4), going down to (5,3), then left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), then up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then right to (2,6), (3,6), then down to (3,5) tail.\n\n(3,5) is below (3,6).\n\nFood at (6,6) which is top-right corner, and food at (3,5) which is now tail, but will be exposed if we move without eating.\n\nAlso, (3,5) has food, and after move, it will be free.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,4):\n\nU to (5,5): empty\n\nL to (4,4): empty\n\nR to (6,4): empty\n\nAll safe.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, since (3,5) food will be exposed after this move if we don't eat, and it has long life span, we can go for it later.\n\n(6,6) has shorter life span, only 7 turns, so we might want to eat it soon.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), and head at (5,4), we can go right then up or up then right.\n\nIf we move R to (6,4), then from there, we can go U to (6,5), then U to (6,6) to eat on turn 45? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 43: current, we choose action for turn 43.\n\nThen the move happens, state updates.\n\nTurn 44, we move again, etc.\n\nBut we need to output actions for multiple turns? No, the answer format is to output actions for the next few turns, I think for a sequence.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nIt says \"...\" so probably for a few turns, but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to provide a sequence of actions for the immediate future, based on the plan.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince we need to think ahead, I should simulate the possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider the options for turn 43.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,5)\n\nThen, from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is now body? After move to (5,5), new positions.\n\nAfter turn 43 move to (5,5) without eating (since no food there), so new head (5,5), then old head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to (3,6), and tail was (3,5), but since no eat, tail moves away, so new positions: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)  // and (3,5) is vacated.\n\nOld positions had 12 segments, after move without eat, 12 segments: new head, then 0 to 10, where 0 was (5,4), 1 (5,3), 2 (4,3), 3 (3,3), 4 (2,3), 5 (1,3), 6 (1,4), 7 (1,5), 8 (1,6), 9 (2,6), 10 (3,6)\n\nOld 11 was (3,5), gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) with (3,6) as new tail.\n\nAnd food at (3,5) is now exposed and available.\n\nDirection: since we moved U to (5,5), new head direction U.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is now the first body segment, so collision if move down. L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(4,5) and (6,5) should be empty? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions after move: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), etc. (4,5) not occupied, (6,5) not occupied.\n\nWalls: (4,5) is x=4,y=5, not wall. (6,5) x=6,y=5, not wall.\n\nSo can move U, L, or R. D not allowed because reverse? Current direction U, so down is reverse, not allowed. So only U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nNow, food at (6,6) is nearby. If we go R to (6,5), then next can go U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,5) is exposed, but (3,5) is below (3,6) tail, and head is at (5,5), not close.\n\nFirst, let's continue this path.\n\nIf we go U to (5,5) on t43.\n\nThen on t44, we can go R to (6,5) for example.\n\nThen from (6,5), we can go U to (6,6) to eat food on turn 45.\n\nt44 move to (6,5), then t45 to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut let's see if (6,6) is still available; life span at t43 is 7, so at t44 countdown 6, t45 countdown 5, still available.\n\nSimilarly, after eating at (6,6), snake grows, score +1.\n\nBut we need to think about survival.\n\nAnother option: on t43, move L to (4,4)\n\nThen from there, we can go towards (3,5) or other.\n\nOr move R to (6,4), then to (6,5), (6,6) etc.\n\nLet's list all options.\n\nFirst, prioritize getting (6,6) since it has shorter life.\n\n(6,6) can be reached in two moves from current position: via (6,4) or via (5,5) and then (6,5) or (5,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), to (6,6):\n\n- Path 1: R to (6,4), then U to (6,5), then U to (6,6) — but from (6,5) to (6,6) is U.\n\n- Path 2: U to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6)\n\n- Or U to (5,5), then U to (5,6), then R to (6,6) — but (5,6) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrently, (5,6) is not in positions, so empty.\n\nBut after move, it might be.\n\nAlso, we can go directly, but not adjacent.\n\nShortest path is two steps, but since we need to move to adjacent, it takes at least two moves to reach (6,6).\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,6) is not adjacent, so minimum two moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,5), from (5,4) to (3,5) is |Δx|=2, |Δy|=1, so not adjacent, min two moves, e.g., L to (4,4), then L to (3,4), then D to (3,5)? (3,4) might be occupied.\n\nCurrent positions: (3,3) is occupied, (3,4) is not in list, so empty.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nSo (3,4) not occupied, empty.\n\n(4,4) empty, etc.\n\nSo to (3,5): from (5,4), can go L to (4,4), then L to (3,4), then D to (3,5).\n\nOr other paths.\n\nBut (3,5) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\nNow, back to turn 43 choices.\n\nIf we move R to (6,4) on t43.\n\nThen new head (6,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nNew positions: since no eat, tail moves away, so new: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)  // tail at (3,6)\n\nFood at (3,5) exposed.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves: U, D, L, but current direction R, so cannot move L (reverse to left).\n\nCan move U to (6,5), D to (6,3), or R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (6,3): is it wall or occupied? y=3, x=6, not border, not (5,2), so empty? Positions: after move, body has (5,4), (5,3), etc., (6,3) not occupied, so can move D to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) might be safe.\n\nTo reach (6,6), best to go U to (6,5) on t44.\n\nThen from (6,5) to (6,6) on t45 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if we move U to (5,5) on t43, then to (6,5) on t44, then to (6,6) on t45.\n\nNow, moving L to (4,4) on t43.\n\nThen new head (4,4), direction L (left).\n\nNew positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)  // tail (3,6), (3,5) exposed.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U, D, R, but not L (reverse).\n\nCan move U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision, or R to (5,4) body, collision, so only U to (4,5) possible? Moves: U to (4,5), which is empty; D to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by segment, after positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), ..., so (4,3) is the fourth segment, so moving to (4,3) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, R to (5,4) is the second segment, collision.\n\nL to (3,4) but direction: current head direction is L, so moving left, opposite is right, so can move U, D, or L? No instant reverse, so cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction after move to (4,4) is L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nCan move U, D, or L.\n\nL to (3,4): empty? (3,4) not occupied, should be empty.\n\nU to (4,5): empty.\n\nD to (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied, as above.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nD to (4,3) invalid due to body.\n\nSo from (4,4), after moving L, can go U or L.\n\nIf go L to (3,4), then from there can go to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\n(3,5) has food exposed.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,5) is up, D? (3,4) to (3,5) is y+1, so up if y increases up.\n\nGrid: y=0 bottom? In the coordinates, walls y=0 and y=7, but snake positions: head at (5,4), moved U to (5,5), so y=5 is above y=4, so y increases up, I assume.\n\nIn the state, head direction U, to (5,4) from (5,3)? (5,3) to (5,4) is y+1, so U is y+1, so y increases upwards.\n\nSo (3,4) to (3,5) is U.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to think about long-term survival. The snake is quite long, 12 segments, and the grid has obstacles, so we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,6), the snake will be longer, and we have to navigate.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (3,5) which we can eat later.\n\nBut (3,5) is near the current tail area.\n\nPerhaps we can eat both foods.\n\nFirst, let's aim to eat (6,6) soon.\n\nOption: on t43, move R to (6,4)\n\nThen t44, move U to (6,5)\n\nThen t45, move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6), snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,6), then old head (6,5)? Let's see.\n\nOn t45, move to (6,6) from (6,5), assuming we are at (6,5) on t44.\n\nt43: move R to (6,4), new head (6,4), positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) tail\n\nt44: move U to (6,5), new head (6,5), no eat, so new positions: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // tail at (2,6)? Old tail (3,6) left, new tail is (2,6)\n\nPositions: new head (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) with (2,6) tail.\n\nt45: move U to (6,6), which has food, so eat. New head (6,6), then old head (6,5), then the body: (6,4), (5,4), ..., up to (2,6), and since eat, tail does not move, so new positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // (2,6) is still there, and snake length 13 now.\n\nOld positions had 12, after eat, 13 segments.\n\nNow, head at (6,6), which is corner, with walls at x=7 and y=7.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (6,5) but (6,5) is now body; L to (5,6) or R to (7,6) wall.\n\nR to (7,6) invalid, U invalid, D to (6,5) is occupied by second segment, collision.\n\nL to (5,6): is (5,6) occupied? Positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc. (5,6) not in list, so empty? (5,6) should be empty.\n\nCan move L to (5,6).\n\nCurrent direction U (since moved U to (6,6)? On t45, moved U to (6,6), so direction U.\n\nFrom (6,6), can move L, D, or R, but R and U invalid, D to (6,5) body, so only possible move L to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut we are at corner, so moving L to (5,6) is necessary.\n\nThen from (5,6), we can go D to (5,5) or L to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut now, the food at (3,5) is still available, life span 10, so until t52.\n\nWe can plan to go there.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupation.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), snake is at top-right, and the body is from (6,6) to (2,6), which is the top row, and down to (2,3), etc.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is the tail.\n\n(3,5) has food, and it's empty now? After t43, when we moved to (6,4), tail moved from (3,5), so (3,5) has food and is free.\n\nIn the sequence above, on t43 move to (6,4), (3,5) vacated.\n\nOn t44 move to (6,5), (3,5) still free with food.\n\nt45 move to (6,6) eat, no change to (3,5).\n\nSo (3,5) food available.\n\nHead at (6,6), (3,5) is at bottom-left, far away.\n\nTo reach (3,5), it might take several moves, and we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother option for t43: move U to (5,5)\n\nThen t44, move R to (6,5)\n\nThen t45, move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nSimilar to above, but starting with U.\n\nt43: U to (5,5), new head (5,5), positions: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) tail, (3,5) exposed.\n\nt44: move R to (6,5), new head (6,5), no eat, positions: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,6)\n\nt45: move U to (6,6) eat, new positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,6)\n\nThen from (6,6), only move L to (5,6) as before.\n\nSame situation.\n\nNow, if on t43 we move L to (4,4), we can go towards (3,5).\n\nt43: move L to (4,4), new head (4,4), direction L.\n\nPositions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) tail, (3,5) exposed.\n\nFrom (4,4), as before, can move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nSay we go L to (3,4) on t44.\n\nt44: move L to (3,4), new head (3,4), no eat, positions: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,6)\n\nThen t45, we can move U to (3,5) to eat the food there.\n\n(3,5) has food, and it's free.\n\nMove U to (3,5), eat.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,5), then old head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)  // and since eat, tail (2,6) remains, so 13 segments.\n\nHead at (3,5), which was the food location.\n\nNow, from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nBut (3,6) might be occupied or not. Positions: after move, (3,5) head, (3,4), (4,4), etc., (3,6) not in list, so empty? Let's see: positions are (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo (3,6) not occupied, empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is body, so cannot move D to (3,4).\n\nL to (2,5): empty? (2,5) not occupied.\n\nR to (4,5): empty.\n\nU to (3,6): empty.\n\nCurrent direction: moved U to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nCan move U, L, R; D not allowed (reverse).\n\nU to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) all possible.\n\nThen we can go to other areas.\n\nBut we haven't eaten (6,6) yet, which has shorter life span.\n\nIn this case, on t45 we eat (3,5), but (6,6) is still there, but with less time.\n\nLife span of (6,6) at t43 is 7, so after t43, t44, t45, on t45 countdown is 5 (since decreased each turn).\n\nAt t43: countdown 7\n\nt44: 6\n\nt45: 5\n\nSo still available until t49.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) at t45, head at (3,5), we can go towards (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is far, and snake is longer, might be harder to reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (6,6), need to go right and up.\n\nBut the body is in the way.\n\nFor instance, to go right, to (4,5), then (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,6).\n\n(5,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter positions: head (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\n(4,5) empty, (5,5) empty, (6,5) empty, (6,6) food.\n\nSo can go R to (4,5) on t46, then R to (5,5) on t47, then R to (6,5) on t48, then U to (6,6) on t49 to eat, if still available.\n\nt49 countdown for (6,6): started t43 countdown 7, t44:6, t45:5, t46:4, t47:3, t48:2, t49:1, so available on t49.\n\nt49 move to (6,6) eat, countdown 1, then disappears after.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut we need to ensure the path is clear and no collision.\n\nIn this path, on t46 from (3,5) move R to (4,5), then t47 R to (5,5), t48 R to (6,5), t49 U to (6,6) eat.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (6,6) is U.\n\nNow, in this case, by moving L on t43, we can eat (3,5) on t45, and still have time to eat (6,6) on t49.\n\nBut on t49, it's the last chance for (6,6), so risky if something blocks.\n\nIf we eat (6,6) first, we can eat (3,5) later with more time.\n\n(3,5) has life span 10, so until t52, plenty of time.\n\nBut after eating (6,6), the snake is at corner, and (3,5) is far, so it might take more turns to reach.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,6) at t45, head at (6,6), move L to (5,6) on t46.\n\nThen from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) on t47, then D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body? Positions after t46: after move to (5,6), no eat, so positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // tail (1,6)? Old tail (2,6), after move, new tail is the previous, let's not list all.\n\nFrom (5,6), we can go to (5,5), then to (4,5), etc., towards (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving away from the area, (3,5) could be occupied if we didn't eat, but in this case, since we exposed it on t43, and no one ate it, it should be there until life span ends.\n\nBut we can eat it.\n\nPath from (5,6) to (3,5): for example, D to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then L to (3,5), but (3,5) may not be directly accessible.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) is not adjacent; (4,5) to (3,5) is left, but y same, so L.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5): Δx=-1, Δy=0, so left.\n\nBut (3,5) is the target.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (5,5) D, then to (4,5) L, then to (3,5) L? (4,5) to (3,5) is left, yes.\n\nBut (3,5) has food, so we can eat on move to it.\n\nBut is (3,5) occupied during this? After t43, (3,5) is free with food, and if not eaten, it stays until t52.\n\nSo on t46, head at (5,6), move D to (5,5) (assuming no body), then t47 L to (4,5), t48 L to (3,5) eat.\n\nt48 move to (3,5) eat.\n\nLife span ok.\n\nBut in this case, we eat (6,6) at t45 and (3,5) at t48.\n\nCompared to the other way: eat (3,5) at t45 and (6,6) at t49.\n\nBoth possible.\n\nBut in the first case, when we eat (6,6) first, we are at corner, which might be risky, but we can escape.\n\nIn the second case, when we eat (3,5) first, we are at (3,5), which is near the left, but we can go to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has to be eaten by t49, so on t49 we must reach it.\n\nIn the path I described, from (3,5) at t45, move R to (4,5) t46, R to (5,5) t47, R to (6,5) t48, U to (6,6) t49.\n\nOn t48, at (6,5), which is adjacent to (6,6), so ok.\n\nBut is (6,5) occupied? At that time, it should be free, but we need to simulate the body.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) at t45, positions: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nt46: move R to (4,5), no food, so new head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // tail (1,6), (2,6) left\n\nPositions: new head (4,5), old head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) with (1,6) tail.\n\nt47: move R to (5,5), no food, new head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // tail (1,5), (1,6) left\n\nt48: move R to (6,5), no food, new head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)  // tail (1,4)\n\nt49: move U to (6,6), which has food, eat. New head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)  // tail (1,4)\n\nSo it works.\n\nSimilarly, the other way around.\n\nBut in the first approach, if we eat (6,6) first at t45, then we eat (3,5) at t48, as I had earlier.\n\nt45 eat (6,6), head (6,6)\n\nt46 move L to (5,6)\n\nt47 move D to (5,5)\n\nt48 move L to (4,5)? From (5,5) to (4,5) is L.\n\nThen t49 move L to (3,5) eat? (4,5) to (3,5) is L, but (3,5) has food, so eat on t49.\n\nt49 eat (3,5).\n\nBut life span of (3,5) is 10, t43:10, t44:9, ..., t49:4, so available.\n\nSo both ways, we can eat both foods by around t49.\n\nBut in terms of risk, when we eat (6,6) first, we are at the corner, which might be more dangerous if we make a wrong move, but we escaped.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (5,2), but we are not near there.\n\nNow, for the current turn, I need to choose the first move.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger doesn't apply here since head not adjacent to tail when eating.\n\nBut in the move to (3,5), when we eat, head is not adjacent to tail at that time.\n\nFor example, in the sequence above, when we move to (3,5) to eat, tail is at (1,6) or something, not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, to maximize score, eating both is good, but are there more foods? Only two given.\n\nBut we might get more later, but not specified.\n\nFor now, eating both is the goal.\n\nNow, which first move is better.\n\nIf we move R to (6,4) on t43, we can start towards (6,6).\n\nIf we move U to (5,5), similar.\n\nIf we move L to (4,4), we go towards (3,5).\n\nSince (6,6) has shorter life, it might be better to get it first to avoid missing it.\n\nBut we have until t49, and from current position, we can reach it by t45 if we go directly.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) can be eaten later.\n\nBut if we go for (3,5) first, we can also get (6,6) by t49.\n\nBut let's see the number of moves.\n\nFrom current to (6,6): min 2 moves, to (3,5): min 2 moves.\n\nBut after eating one, the snake is longer, but in this grid, it might not matter much.\n\nAnother consideration: the area around (1,3) to (1,6) might be a bit cramped, but we can move out.\n\nPerhaps moving towards the open area is better.\n\nFor example, moving right or up might be better than left, since left has the snake body.\n\nCurrent head at (5,4), body at (5,3), (4,3), etc., and left to (4,4) or (3,4) is open.\n\nBut (6,4) and (5,5) are also open.\n\nThe grid has internal wall at (5,2), but not relevant.\n\nI think both are viable.\n\nBut to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a sequence.\n\nSuppose we prioritize eating (6,6) soon.\n\nSo on t43, move R to (6,4)\n\nThen t44, move U to (6,5)\n\nThen t45, move U to (6,6) eat\n\nThen t46, from (6,6), only possible move L to (5,6)\n\nThen t47, from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6) or U but y=7 wall, or R invalid.\n\nSay move D to (5,5)\n\nThen from (5,5), can move to (4,5) or (5,4) but (5,4) might be body, etc.\n\nBut we need to go to (3,5) for the other food.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5) on t48\n\nThen from (4,5), move L to (3,5) on t49 to eat, if we can.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) is L, and (3,5) has food, so eat on t49.\n\nLife span of (3,5) at t49 is countdown from 10: t43:10, t44:9, t45:8, t46:7, t47:6, t48:5, t49:4, so available.\n\nAnd we eat it.\n\nIn this sequence, we eat (6,6) at t45 and (3,5) at t49.\n\nOutput for 5 turns: t43 to t47 or something.\n\nThe answer should start from t43 action.\n\nIn this plan, t43: R, t44: U, t45: U, t46: L, t47: D\n\nThen t48: L to (4,5), t49: L to (3,5) eat, but beyond 5 turns.\n\nBut we need to output multiple turns, but not specified how many.\n\nPerhaps for the immediate actions.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output a sequence of 5 actions or so.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nIt says \"Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... \" with dots, so I can provide a few.\n\nBut to be precise, let's provide for t43 to t47.\n\nIn the above, with move R on t43.\n\nIf we move U on t43 to (5,5), then t44 R to (6,5), t45 U to (6,6) eat, same as above.\n\nThen t46 L to (5,6), etc.\n\nSlightly different path.\n\nWith U on t43: t43 U to (5,5), t44 R to (6,5), t45 U to (6,6) eat, t46 L to (5,6), t47 D to (5,5)\n\nThen to (4,5), (3,5) later.\n\nIf we move L on t43 to (4,4), then we can go to (3,5) faster.\n\nt43 L to (4,4)\n\nt44, from (4,4), we can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5)\n\nTo reach (3,5), better to go L to (3,4)\n\nt44 L to (3,4)\n\nt45 U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen t46, from (3,5), move to (4,5) or other to go to (6,6)\n\nFor example, t46 R to (4,5)\n\nt47 R to (5,5)\n\nt48 R to (6,5)\n\nt49 U to (6,6) eat\n\nAlso works.\n\nIn this case, we eat (3,5) at t45 and (6,6) at t49.\n\nNow, comparing the two strategies:\n\n- If we go right or up first, we eat (6,6) at t45 and (3,5) at t49.\n\n- If we go left first, we eat (3,5) at t45 and (6,6) at t49.\n\nThe score is the same, but in the first case, when we eat (6,6) first, we are at the corner at t45, which might be slightly riskier if there are more obstacles, but here it's ok.\n\nIn the second case, eating (3,5) first, at t45 head at (3,5), which is not corner.\n\nBut both seem fine.\n\nPerhaps moving towards (6,6) first is better because it has shorter life, so get it early in case of delays.\n\nBut we have a clear path.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) is under the tail, but after first move, it's exposed, so no issue.\n\nFor turn 43, moving R or U are both good to reach (6,6).\n\nMoving L is good to reach (3,5).\n\nBut since we need to eat both, and (6,6) has shorter life, let's go for it first.\n\nSo I think move R on t43.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 43: R (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 44: U (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 45: U (to (6,6) eat)\n\nThen for turn 46, from (6,6), only possible move L to (5,6), so must be L.\n\nTurn 47, from (5,6), can move D, L, or U, but U wall, so D or L.\n\nTo go towards (3,5), better to move D to (5,5).\n\nSo turn 47: D\n\nThen turn 48, from (5,5), can move to (4,5) or (5,4) but (5,4) may be body, etc.\n\nIn the state after t46, positions: after t45 eat at (6,6), positions (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nt46 move L to (5,6), no eat, so new positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // tail (1,6), (2,6) left\n\nt47 move D to (5,5), no eat, new positions: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // tail (1,5)\n\nThen from (5,5), can move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, or U to (5,6) body, or R to (6,5) body.\n\nSo only possible move L to (4,5), assuming (4,5) empty.\n\nThen t48 L to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut for the output, I can provide up to t47.\n\nIn the sequence, for t43 to t47: R, U, U, L, D\n\nWith U on t43: t43 U, t44 R, t45 U, t46 L, t47 D\n\nSame actions essentially.\n\nNow, to confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction U.\n\nMove R: that's fine, not reverse.\n\nThen after moving R, direction R.\n\nThen U: from direction R, moving U is not reverse, reverse would be L.\n\nThen U again, to (6,6).\n\nThen L to (5,6), from direction U, moving L is not reverse.\n\nThen D to (5,5), from direction L? After moving to (6,6) with U, direction U.\n\nThen moving L to (5,6), which is left, so direction changes to L.\n\nThen moving D to (5,5), down, which is not reverse of L, reverse would be R.\n\nSo all moves valid.\n\nSimilarly, if we start with U: t43 U from (5,4) to (5,5), direction U to U, fine.\n\nt44 R to (6,5), from U to R, not reverse.\n\nt45 U to (6,6), from R to U, not reverse.\n\netc.\n\nI think R first is fine.\n\nBut in the state, there is an internal obstacle at (5,2), but we are not near, so no issue.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with moving R on t43.\n\nThen the sequence for 5 turns: t43 R, t44 U, t45 U, t46 L, t47 D\n\nBut t46 and t47 are after eating, but we need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output for t43 to t47.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but the actions are for the turns.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if moving L on t43.\n\nt43 L to (4,4)\n\nThen t44, from (4,4), move L to (3,4) (since U or L, L to (3,4))\n\nt45 U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen t46, from (3,5), move to (4,5) or (3,6) or (2,5)\n\nSay R to (4,5)\n\nt47 R to (5,5)\n\nThen to (6,5) etc.\n\nBut in this case, we eat (3,5) at t45, which is earlier, but (6,6) later.\n\nBut since both get eaten, and score same, I think starting with R is fine.\n\nMoreover, by eating (6,6) first, we might have more room to maneuver later, but the grid is symmetric except the obstacle.\n\nI think R or U for t43.\n\nBut moving U to (5,5) might be better because from (5,5) we have more options, whereas (6,4) is on the right edge.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), we can go to (6,5) or (5,6) or (4,5), more choices.\n\nFrom (6,4), on edge.\n\nBut in this case, to reach (6,6), from (6,4) we go directly up, or from (5,5) we go right then up.\n\nSimilar.\n\nI think for simplicity, let's output with R on t43.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 43: R\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nThen for turn 46, it must be L, as above.\n\nTurn 47, from (5,6), move D to (5,5), as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, after t45, head at (6,6), turn 46 move L to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 47 move D to (5,5)\n\nWe can also move L from (5,6) to (4,6), but (4,6) might be free, but to go down is towards the center.\n\nBut D to (5,5) is fine.\n\nSo for output, I'll provide 5 actions: t43 to t47.\n\nBut t47 is D, which is down.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the plan involves eating both available foods: (6,6) with a shorter life span (disappears after turn 49) and (3,5) with a longer life span (disappears after turn 52). The strategy is to first secure (6,6) due to its imminent expiration, then navigate to (3,5) for the second point. \n\n- **Turn 43**: Move right (R) to (6,4). This starts the path toward (6,6) and avoids the risk of entering the crowded left side. The tail at (3,5) moves away, exposing the food there for later consumption.\n- **Turn 44**: Move up (U) to (6,5). This positions the snake adjacent to (6,6) for eating on the next turn.\n- **Turn 45**: Move up (U) to (6,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases). After this, the snake is in the top-right corner, requiring a left move to avoid walls and body collisions.\n- **Turn 46**: Move left (L) to (5,6). This is the only safe move from (6,6) and begins the journey toward (3,5).\n- **Turn 47**: Move down (D) to (5,5). This centers the snake and sets up for a leftward path to (3,5) via (4,5) and (3,5) on subsequent turns.\n\nThis sequence ensures (6,6) is eaten by turn 45, well within its life span. (3,5) can be safely eaten around turn 49 (e.g., via moves to (4,5) on turn 48 and (3,5) on turn 49), as the head is not adjacent to the tail when eating, avoiding Tail Reward Danger. Thinking beyond 5 turns, the snake should continue toward (3,5) while avoiding the internal obstacle at (5,2) and walls.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: R\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: L\nTurn 47: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 44. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake positions are given: head at (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6). That's 12 segments. The head direction is R, meaning right, so it's moving east.\n\nNow, food: there are two food items. First one at (6,6) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food). Second at (3,5) with life span 9 and value +1 (also positive). Both are positive, so eating them increases length by one. No negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival and maximizing score. Avoid collisions and consider food life spans.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 rows and 8 columns. Walls are at the borders, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x. Also, obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6). So let's list the coordinates:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 6: (1,3)\n\n- Segment 7: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 8: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (1,6)\n\n- Segment 10: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 11: (3,6)\n\nThe snake has 12 segments. Head at (6,4), moving right, so from (6,4) to (7,4) would be moving right, but x=7 is a wall, so it can't move right because that would hit the east wall.\n\nHead direction is R, so it was moving right to (6,4) from previous position. But now, at (6,4), moving right to (7,4) is impossible since x=7 is wall. So it must change direction.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, it can go U (up), D (down), or continue R, but R is wall, so not possible. Also, cannot move opposite, so L (left) is opposite of R, so it cannot move left instantly. No instant reverse rule: if current direction is R, cannot move L on next turn.\n\nSo current direction is R, so possible moves are U, D, R. But R leads to (7,4), which is x=7, wall, so invalid. So only U or D are possible.\n\nU is up, to (6,5)\n\nD is down, to (6,3)\n\nNow, check if these cells are occupied or walls.\n\n(6,5): is it a wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (6,5) is within bounds, x=6 between 1-6? x from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (6,5) is not a wall since x=6<7, y=5<7, and not (0,5) etc. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), not (6,5).\n\nNow, is (6,5) occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)\n\n(6,5) is not in this list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3): not a wall, not in snake positions? (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (5,3) is a body segment, but (6,3) is different.\n\n(6,3) is below (6,4).\n\nNow, moving to (6,5) or (6,3) both seem possible, but I need to consider the future.\n\nAlso, food: (6,6) with life span 6, and (3,5) with life span 9.\n\n(6,6) is at y=6, x=6. (3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nLife span: food disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 44, life span 6 means it will disappear at turn 44 + 6 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo when food is spawned, life_span = L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on the turn it is present for L turns.\n\nFor example, if life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only this turn.\n\nGenerally, if life_span = L at turn t, it will be there until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n\nBut since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life_span = L, then at turn t+1, life_span = L-1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor (6,6), at turn 44, life_span=6, so it can be eaten from turn 44 to 49 (since 44 to 49 is 6 turns: 44,45,46,47,48,49? Let's count: turn 44: L=6, turn 45: L=5, ..., turn 49: L=1, turn 50: L=0, disappeared. So available from turn 44 to 49 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) life_span=9, so available from turn 44 to 52 inclusive.\n\nNow, back to current move: turn 44, snake at (6,4), must move to U (6,5) or D (6,3) since R is wall and L is not allowed (reverse).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nSketch a grid:\n\ny=7: wall\n\ny=6: cells x=1 to 6: (1,6) snake, (2,6) snake, (3,6) snake, (4,6)? free, (5,6)? free, (6,6) food\n\ny=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5)? free, (3,5) food, (4,5)? free, (5,5)? free, (6,5) free\n\ny=4: (1,4) snake, (2,4)? free, (3,4)? free, (4,4)? free, (5,4) snake, (6,4) snake head\n\ny=3: (1,3) snake, (2,3) snake, (3,3) snake, (4,3) snake, (5,3) snake, (6,3) free\n\ny=2: (1,2)? free, (2,2)? free, (3,2)? free, (4,2)? free, (5,2) obstacle (wall), (6,2)? free\n\ny=1: free except walls\n\ny=0: wall\n\nx=0: wall, x=7: wall\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,4). If it moves U to (6,5), that's free. If it moves D to (6,3), also free.\n\nBut I need to consider the tail and future paths.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,6), I think. Snake positions: last segment is (3,6), which is tail.\n\nWhen snake moves, the tail moves only if it doesn't eat food; if it eats, tail stays but new segment added at head.\n\nNow, (6,6) is food at y=6, x=6. If head goes to (6,5), it's closer to (6,6), but not directly.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (6,5) is up, then from (6,5) it can go U to (6,6) to eat the food, but (6,6) is food, so if head moves to (6,6), it eats it.\n\nBut there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, is the head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,6). Head at (6,4). Distance: |6-3|=3, |4-6|=2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(6,4) and (3,6) are not adjacent; they are diagonally apart or farther. So no issue.\n\nNow, if head moves to (6,5) on turn 44, then to (6,6) on turn 45, it can eat the food at (6,6).\n\nBut life span of (6,6) is 6, from turn 44 to 49, so it can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's see if moving to (6,5) is safe.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), the snake head is at (6,5), body segments: when it moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. But since it didn't eat, tail moves away.\n\nOn turn 44, move head to new cell, say (6,5), then new positions: head (6,5), then body: (6,4) becomes segment 1, (5,4) segment 2, ..., up to (2,6) segment 11, and tail (3,6) moves? Tail is last segment.\n\nSnake positions after move: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo from current positions: head (6,4) to (6,5), so new head (6,5), then the previous head (6,4) becomes the new segment 1, (5,4) becomes segment 2, (5,3) segment 3, (4,3) segment 4, (3,3) segment 5, (2,3) segment 6, (1,3) segment 7, (1,4) segment 8, (1,5) segment 9, (1,6) segment 10, (2,6) segment 11, and tail (3,6) is removed? No.\n\nThe snake has 12 segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left, and a new cell is occupied at head.\n\nSo positions shift: the new positions are: head at new position, then the first body segment at old head position, second at old first body, and so on, so the last segment (tail) is removed from the grid.\n\nIn this case, current positions: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (1,6), 10: (2,6), 11: (3,6) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,5): new head at (6,5), then segment 1 at (6,4) (old head), segment 2 at (5,4) (old seg1), segment 3 at (5,3) (old seg2), segment 4 at (4,3) (old seg3), segment 5 at (3,3) (old seg4), segment 6 at (2,3) (old seg5), segment 7 at (1,3) (old seg6), segment 8 at (1,4) (old seg7), segment 9 at (1,5) (old seg8), segment 10 at (1,6) (old seg9), segment 11 at (2,6) (old seg10), and the old tail (3,6) is removed, so no longer occupied.\n\nSo new tail is at (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (6,3), new head (6,3), segment 1 (6,4), segment 2 (5,4), segment 3 (5,3), ..., up to segment 11 at (2,6), tail at (2,6) or what? Old seg10 is (2,6), which becomes new segment 11, and old tail (3,6) removed.\n\nIn both cases, the tail changes.\n\nNow back to choice: move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), then on turn 45, head at (6,5), which is just below (6,6) food.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so not possible.\n\nCannot move opposite? Current direction: after moving U, the head direction is now U, so on next turn, cannot move D (opposite), so possible: U, L, R. But R to (7,5) wall, invalid. So only U or L.\n\nU to (6,6): that's food, so if move there, eat it.\n\nL to (5,5): which is free? (5,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\nIf I move to (6,6) on turn 45, I eat the food, so length increases, and new segment added, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating, when head moves to food, it grows, so positions: head at (6,6), then the previous segments: since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head, but the body segments remain, and tail stays.\n\nSo after eating at (6,6), new positions: head at (6,6), then segment 1 at (6,5) (old head), segment 2 at (6,4) (old seg1), segment 3 at (5,4) (old seg2), segment 4 at (5,3) (old seg3), segment 5 at (4,3) (old seg4), segment 6 at (3,3) (old seg5), segment 7 at (2,3) (old seg6), segment 8 at (1,3) (old seg7), segment 9 at (1,4) (old seg8), segment 10 at (1,5) (old seg9), segment 11 at (1,6) (old seg10), segment 12 at (2,6) (old seg11), and the old tail (3,6) remains as new segment 13? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't move, the length increases by one.\n\nStandard snake: when eats, head moves to food, body follows, tail stays put, so new segment is added at the tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nFrom the rules: when eating positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so when head moves to food cell, it consumes it, and the snake grows by one segment, meaning that the tail does not move in that turn; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it's like the tail stays, and the head moves to food.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions P0, P1, ..., Pk (head to tail).\n\nAfter move to food: new head at food cell, new segment 1 at P0 (old head), new segment 2 at P1 (old seg1), ..., new segment k at P_{k-1} (old seg k-1), and new tail at Pk (old tail), but since it grows, there is an additional segment at the old tail position, so the tail is now at Pk, but it's the same position, but the snake has one more segment.\n\nFor example, before eat: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter eat at cell F: new positions [F (new H), H (new B1), B1 (new B2), ..., B_{k-1} (new Bk), T (new tail)] and since length +1, T is still there, but now it's not the tail; the new tail is T, and there is a new segment before it? Let's index.\n\nSuppose k+1 segments, indices 0 to k, 0=head, k=tail.\n\nAfter moving and eating: head moves to F, so new position 0: F.\n\nThen position 1: old position 0 (H)\n\nPosition 2: old position 1 (B1)\n\n...\n\nPosition k: old position k-1 (B_{k-1})\n\nAnd since it ate, a new segment is added at old position k (T), so new position k+1: old position k (T)\n\nSo new tail is at old tail position.\n\nIn this case, the cell that was tail remains occupied, and the head is at food.\n\nIn our case, if on turn 45, head from (6,5) moves to (6,6) and eats.\n\nTurn 44: after moving U to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (1,4), seg9 (1,5), seg10 (1,6), seg11 (2,6), tail (3,6) removed? No, when moving without eating, tail is removed.\n\nOn turn 44, move to (6,5) without eating, so positions: head (6,5), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (1,4), seg9 (1,5), seg10 (1,6), seg11 (2,6)  new tail at (2,6), and (3,6) is free now.\n\nThen on turn 45, head at (6,5), move to (6,6) which is food, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), seg1 (6,5) old head, seg2 (6,4) old seg1, seg3 (5,4) old seg2, seg4 (5,3) old seg3, seg5 (4,3) old seg4, seg6 (3,3) old seg5, seg7 (2,3) old seg6, seg8 (1,3) old seg7, seg9 (1,4) old seg8, seg10 (1,5) old seg9, seg11 (1,6) old seg10, seg12 (2,6) old seg11, and since ate, new segment added at old tail position, but old tail was (2,6), which is now seg12, so new tail is at (2,6), and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was when it ate, but since the tail didn't move, it's at (2,6), so new positions include (2,6) as seg12, and new seg13 at (2,6)? I'm messing up.\n\nStandard: when eating, the tail does not move, so the cell remains occupied, and the head moves to food, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nAfter move to (6,6) and eat: new head at (6,6), new seg1 at (6,5) previous head, new seg2 at (6,4) previous seg1, new seg3 at (5,4) previous seg2, new seg4 at (5,3) previous seg3, new seg5 at (4,3) previous seg4, new seg6 at (3,3) previous seg5, new seg7 at (2,3) previous seg6, new seg8 at (1,3) previous seg7, new seg9 at (1,4) previous seg8, new seg10 at (1,5) previous seg9, new seg11 at (1,6) previous seg10, new seg12 at (2,6) previous seg11, and since ate, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (2,6), but (2,6) is already new seg12, so we add a new segment at that position, meaning it becomes two segments at the same position? No, that can't be.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nWhen the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not advance, so the last position is not vacated, and a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n\nSo in terms of positions, the new tail is at the old tail position, and there is an additional segment before it.\n\nFor example, before eat, positions: [A, B, C, D] with D tail.\n\nAfter moving to food F without eating: new positions [F, A, B, C] with C tail, D vacated.\n\nBut if moving to food and eating: new positions [F, A, B, C, D] with D tail, so length increased, tail at old tail position.\n\nIn this case, the cell D remains occupied.\n\nIn our case:\n\nBefore turn 45 move: positions at end of turn 44: head (6,5), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (1,4), seg9 (1,5), seg10 (1,6), seg11 (2,6) tail.\n\nThen move head to (6,6) and eat food there.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), seg1 (6,5) old head, seg2 (6,4) old seg1, seg3 (5,4) old seg2, seg4 (5,3) old seg3, seg5 (4,3) old seg4, seg6 (3,3) old seg5, seg7 (2,3) old seg6, seg8 (1,3) old seg7, seg9 (1,4) old seg8, seg10 (1,5) old seg9, seg11 (1,6) old seg10, seg12 (2,6) old seg11 (tail), and since ate, new seg13 at (2,6) but that's the same position, so it's not possible; positions must be unique.\n\nI think I have a fundamental error.\n\nIn snake, when the snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move, so the new positions include the new head position and all previous positions except that the tail stays.\n\nFor example, before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk\n\nAfter move to food F: new positions: F (new P0), P0 (new P1), P1 (new P2), ..., P_{k-1} (new Pk), and Pk (new P_{k+1}) for the new segment, so new tail at Pk.\n\nSo the cell Pk is still occupied, and there is a new segment at Pk.\n\nIn terms of grid, the cell that was tail remains occupied, and the head moves to food, so the snake is longer.\n\nIn this case, for turn 45: after moving to (6,6) and eating, new head (6,6), new seg1 (6,5), new seg2 (6,4), new seg3 (5,4), new seg4 (5,3), new seg5 (4,3), new seg6 (3,3), new seg7 (2,3), new seg8 (1,3), new seg9 (1,4), new seg10 (1,5), new seg11 (1,6), new seg12 (2,6), and new seg13 at (2,6) but (2,6) is already seg12, so it's the same cell for two segments? That can't be; each cell can have only one thing.\n\nI think I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps when the snake eats, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't move, it's like the tail is duplicated or something.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when the snake eats, on the next move, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n\nBut in terms of position list, when the head moves to a new cell, if it eats, the tail position is not removed, so the list of positions has one more element.\n\nFor example, suppose snake has positions [H, B, T] with 3 segments.\n\nMove to F and eat: new positions [F, H, B, T] with 4 segments, T is tail.\n\nT was tail before, and now it's still there, but not the tail; new tail is T.\n\nIn the list, positions are F, H, B, T, with T tail.\n\nBefore, positions H, B, T.\n\nAfter move and eat: head to F, so F new head, then H becomes new body1, B becomes new body2, T becomes new body3, and since it ate, a new tail is added at the position of old T, but old T is now body3, so new position at old T position for new tail, but it's the same cell, so we add a new segment at the same position, which is not possible.\n\nI think the correct way is: when the snake moves to a cell with food, it consumes the food, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move in that turn. That means that the tail cell remains occupied, and the head moves to the new cell, so the body segments shift, but the tail stays, so the position that was tail is still occupied, and it is not the tail anymore; the new tail is the segment that was second to last.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nAt the start of turn, snake has positions S0, S1, S2, ..., Sm.\n\nHead at S0, tail at Sm.\n\nWhen moving, new head position is chosen.\n\nIf new head is not food, then new positions: new head, S0, S1, ..., S_{m-1} and Sm is vacated.\n\nIf new head is food, then new positions: new head, S0, S1, ..., Sm, and Sm is not vacated, so it becomes part of the body, and the new tail is Sm, but since no vacate, the snake has m+1 segments.\n\nIn the list, new positions: [new_head, S0, S1, ..., Sm] with new_head at food, S0 to Sm as body, and Sm is the new tail.\n\nFor example, current before move: S0 = (6,5), S1 = (6,4), S2 = (5,4), ..., S11 = (2,6) tail.\n\nMove new_head to (6,6) food.\n\nNew positions: new_head (6,6), then S0 (6,5) as body1, S1 (6,4) as body2, S2 (5,4) as body3, S3 (5,3) as body4, S4 (4,3) as body5, S5 (3,3) as body6, S6 (2,3) as body7, S7 (1,3) as body8, S8 (1,4) as body9, S9 (1,5) as body10, S10 (1,6) as body11, S11 (2,6) as body12 and new tail at (2,6).\n\nS11 (2,6) is the new tail.\n\nAnd since it ate, the length increased, so there is no vacated cell; all positions are occupied.\n\nIn this case, the cell (2,6) is still occupied by the tail, and it's fine.\n\nNo problem with two segments at same cell.\n\nSo in this scenario, after eating at (6,6), the tail is at (2,6), and it was already there.\n\nSimilarly, in general.\n\nSo back to the decision.\n\nFor turn 44, if I move U to (6,5), then on turn 45, I can move U to (6,6) to eat the food, scoring +1.\n\nThen snake is longer.\n\nBut I need to consider if it's safe and for long-term.\n\nAlternatively, if I move D to (6,3) on turn 44, then head at (6,3), which is above the obstacle at (5,2), but (5,2) is below, so (6,3) is fine.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut the food at (6,6) has life span 6, so I can eat it later, up to turn 49.\n\nBut let's see the other food at (3,5), with life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, the snake is currently in the right side, and the left side has some body.\n\nI need to think about the map and possible paths.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (5,2), which blocks the bottom left.\n\nLet's list free cells or something.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider both options.\n\nFirst option: move U to (6,5) on turn 44.\n\nThen on turn 45, as above, I can move U to (6,6) to eat food, or L to (5,5) if I don't want to eat yet, but why not eat? It's positive food, so I should eat it to score, but I need to avoid risks.\n\nBut eating at (6,6) seems safe, no immediate danger.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6), head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 46, possible moves: from (6,6), direction U, so can move U, L, R. But U to (6,7) is y=7 wall, invalid. R to (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid. So only L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free? Currently, after eating, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail.\n\n(5,6) is not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nSo move L to (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 46, head to (5,6), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 47, from (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5); L to (4,6); R to (6,6) but (6,6) is now body, occupied, so invalid.\n\nCannot move to body cells.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite; current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\n(5,5) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(4,6) is free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\nBoth possible.\n\nBut there is food at (3,5), which is below.\n\nIf I go L to (4,6), then I can go down to (4,5) or something to reach (3,5).\n\nBut let's see the tail danger or other.\n\nFirst, after moving to (5,6) on turn 46, say I move D to (5,5) on turn 47.\n\nThen head at (5,5), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 48, possible moves: from (5,5), direction D, so can move D, L, R. U is opposite, cannot.\n\nD to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? Positions: after turn 46 head at (5,6), then on turn 47 move to (5,5), so new positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 46: head at (5,6), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,3), seg10 (1,4), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (1,6), seg13 (2,6) tail.\n\nOn turn 47, move to (5,5), not food, so new positions: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (1,3), seg11 (1,4), seg12 (1,5), seg13 (1,6) new tail at (1,6), (2,6) vacated.\n\n(1,6) was seg12, now tail.\n\nNow head at (5,5), move D to (5,4)? (5,4) is currently seg5, but after move, it will be different.\n\n(5,4) is occupied now by seg5, so if I move to (5,4), it would be body collision.\n\nCells occupied: (5,4) is a body cell, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n\n(4,5) free? Not occupied.\n\n(6,5) is seg3, occupied.\n\nR to (6,5) invalid.\n\nD to (5,4) invalid.\n\nU is opposite, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (4,5) or possibly other, but only L and R, but R to (6,5) occupied, so only L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nSo from (5,5), on turn 48, only possible move is L to (4,5).\n\nThen head to (4,5), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (4,5), direction L, so can move L, U, D. R opposite, cannot.\n\nL to (3,5), which is food! (3,5) has food with value +1.\n\nSo move to (3,5) and eat it.\n\nThen score another point.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut let's go back to the beginning.\n\nI am considering the other choice: on turn 44, move D to (6,3) instead of U.\n\nIf move D to (6,3) on turn 44.\n\nThen new positions: head (6,3), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (1,4), seg9 (1,5), seg10 (1,6), seg11 (2,6) tail, and (3,6) vacated.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 45, possible moves: from (6,3), direction D, so can move D, L, R. U opposite, cannot.\n\nD to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall invalid.\n\n(6,2) is free? Walls: y=0 is wall, but y=2 not wall. Obstacle at (5,2), not (6,2). So (6,2) free.\n\n(5,3) is currently seg3, occupied, so cannot move to (5,3).\n\nL to (5,3) is invalid because occupied.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nMove to (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 46, head at (6,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) invalid.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n(6,1) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nSo only D to (6,1).\n\nMove to (6,1).\n\nThen on turn 47, head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid; L to (5,1); R to (7,1) invalid.\n\n(5,1) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nSo move L to (5,1).\n\nDirection now L.\n\nThen on turn 48, from (5,1), direction L, can move L, U, D. R opposite cannot.\n\nL to (4,1), U to (5,2) obstacle, invalid; D to (5,0) wall invalid.\n\nU to (5,2) is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,0) wall invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,1), if free.\n\n(4,1) should be free.\n\nThen move to (4,1).\n\nAnd so on. But now the snake is going down and left, away from the foods. (6,6) food might expire soon, and (3,5) is there but I'm at (4,1), which is far.\n\nI need to reach (3,5), but from (4,1), it might take many turns, and (3,5) life span 9, from turn 44 to 52, so turn 48 I can still reach, but it's tight.\n\nAlso, in this path, I didn't eat any food, so no score.\n\nWhereas in the first option, I can eat (6,6) and then (3,5) soon.\n\nMoreover, in the down path, I might get trapped in the bottom.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can go to (3,1), (2,1), etc., but the body is above, so I might have space.\n\nBut compared to the first option, it seems worse for scoring.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: in the down path, the snake is going to the bottom left, which has fewer cells, and with the obstacle, it might be risky.\n\nWhereas in the up path, I can eat two foods quickly.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nFirst option: turn 44 move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 45 move U to (6,6) eat food +1\n\nNow positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) tail (since ate, tail at (2,6))\n\nLength 13 now.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 46: only possible move L to (5,6), as U and R invalid.\n\nMove to (5,6), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail? After move without eating: new head (5,6), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,3), seg10 (1,4), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (1,6) new tail at (1,6), (2,6) vacated.\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nNow head at (5,6), direction L.\n\nTurn 47: possible moves U, D, L? Direction L, so can move L, U, D. R opposite cannot.\n\nU to (5,7) wall invalid; D to (5,5); L to (4,6).\n\nBoth free.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), as I thought earlier.\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nMove to (5,5), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail at (1,5)? After move: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (1,3), seg11 (1,4), seg12 (1,5) new tail at (1,5), (1,6) vacated.\n\nNow head (5,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 48: possible moves D, L, R? Direction D, so can move D, L, R. U opposite cannot.\n\nD to (5,4) but (5,4) is seg5, occupied, invalid.\n\nL to (4,5)\n\nR to (6,5) but (6,5) is seg3, occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,5), which is free.\n\nMove to (4,5), direction L.\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nFood at (3,5) is adjacent left.\n\nTurn 49: from (4,5), direction L, so can move L to (3,5), which is food, eat it +1.\n\nAlso U or D, but L to food is best.\n\nMove L to (3,5) eat.\n\nThen score another point.\n\nNow, life span of (6,6) was 6 at turn 44, so available until turn 49, and I ate it on turn 45.\n\n(3,5) life span 9, available until turn 52, ate on turn 49.\n\nGood.\n\nIn this path, I scored two points by turn 49.\n\nNow, after that, snake is longer, head at (3,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to output actions starting from turn 44 for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence, say 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action ...\" for several turns.\n\nIn the state, turn 44, so I need to give actions from turn 44 onwards.\n\nBut I don't know how many to give; I think I should give a sequence that makes sense, perhaps until I eat or something.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, but with survival.\n\nIn the down path, if I move D on turn 44, I might not eat any food soon, and (6,6) might expire before I can get back.\n\nFor example, from down, I went to (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), then to (3,1), etc., to reach (3,5) I need to go up, but (3,5) is at y=5, so from (4,1) I need to go to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free, then (4,3), but (4,3) is body, but as snake moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, on turn 48, if I am at (4,1), then move to (3,1), then (2,1), etc., but (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, so I need to go up.\n\nBut the body is at (1,3) to (1,6), etc., so the left side might be crowded.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) expires at turn 50, since turn 49 last chance, and I am far away, so I miss it.\n\nWhereas in up path, I eat it early.\n\nAlso, (3,5) I can eat later, but in up path I eat both.\n\nSo up path is better.\n\nBut is there a risk in up path?\n\nWhen I eat (6,6) on turn 45, head at (6,6), and tail at (2,6), not adjacent.\n\nThen move to (5,6), fine.\n\nThen to (5,5), fine.\n\nThen to (4,5), fine.\n\nThen to (3,5), eat, fine.\n\nAfter that, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4).\n\n(2,5) free? Not sure, but likely free.\n\n(3,6) is body? After eating at (3,5), let's not go further.\n\nBut seems safe.\n\nIf on turn 44 I move U, and on turn 45 I move L instead of U to avoid eating immediately, but why? I can eat, so better to eat.\n\nFood might disappear, but I have time, but no reason to delay.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,6) could be eaten later, but if I go down, I might not reach in time.\n\nLife span 6, from turn 44 to 49.\n\nIf I go down, on turn 44 move D, 45 move D to (6,2), 46 move D to (6,1), 47 move L to (5,1), 48 move L to (4,1), then on turn 49, head at (4,1), I can move to (4,2), but (6,6) is at (6,6), far away, I cannot reach in one turn, so impossible to eat (6,6) if I go down, since on turn 49 last chance, but I am at (4,1), need at least 4 moves to reach (6,6), e.g. right and up, but not possible in one turn.\n\nSo I miss (6,6) food.\n\nWhereas in up path, I eat it on turn 45.\n\nAlso, for (3,5), in down path, I can eat it later, say from (4,1) to (4,2), (4,3), but (4,3) is body now, but as time passes, the body moves.\n\nIn down path, on turn 48 at (4,1), then turn 49 move to (3,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,5), I need to go to y=5, x=3.\n\nFrom (4,1), move to (4,2) on turn 49, then (4,3) on turn 50, but (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the current state, (4,3) is a body segment, but as the snake moves, it may be vacated.\n\nFor example, in down path: after turn 44 move D to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (1,4), seg9 (1,5), seg10 (1,6), seg11 (2,6) tail.\n\nTurn 45 move D to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), seg1 (6,3), seg2 (6,4), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (2,3), seg8 (1,3), seg9 (1,4), seg10 (1,5), seg11 (1,6) tail at (1,6).\n\nTurn 46 move D to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (6,3), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,3), seg10 (1,4), seg11 (1,5) tail at (1,5).\n\nTurn 47 move L to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (1,3), seg11 (1,4) tail at (1,4).\n\nTurn 48: head at (5,1), move to (4,1) or other, but only L to (4,1) as before.\n\nMove to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (3,3), seg10 (2,3), seg11 (1,3) tail at (1,3).\n\nNow (4,3) is seg8, occupied.\n\nOn turn 49, head at (4,1), direction L, can move L to (3,1), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall invalid.\n\n(4,2) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\nSay move U to (4,2).\n\nThen positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3)? After move: head (4,2), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (6,1), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (4,3), seg10 (3,3), seg11 (2,3) tail at (2,3), (1,3) vacated.\n\nNow (4,3) is seg9, occupied.\n\nTo reach (3,5), I need to go to (4,3) but occupied, or go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), on turn 50, move U to (4,3)? (4,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nMove L to (3,2), or U to (4,3) invalid, so L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) but (4,1) is seg1, occupied, or back, not good.\n\n(4,1) is seg1, occupied.\n\nSo from (4,2), direction? After moving to (4,2) from (4,1), direction was L? On turn 48 move to (4,1) from (5,1), so direction L.\n\nThen turn 49 move to (4,2), which is U? (4,1) to (4,2) is up, so direction U now.\n\nThen on turn 50, from (4,2), direction U, can move U, L, R. D opposite cannot.\n\nU to (4,3) but occupied by seg9, invalid.\n\nL to (3,2)\n\nR to (5,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (3,2).\n\nMove to (3,2).\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 51, move L to (2,2) or U to (3,3) or D to (3,1).\n\n(3,3) is occupied by seg10, invalid.\n\n(2,2) free, (3,1) free.\n\nBut (3,5) is above, so need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,2), move U to (3,3) invalid, so cannot, must move L or D.\n\nSay move to (2,2).\n\nThen to (2,3), but (2,3) is tail or something, but tail moves.\n\nEventually, I might reach (3,5), but it takes many turns, and (3,5) expires at turn 52, so on turn 52, if I can be at (3,5).\n\nBut from above, on turn 50 at (3,2), turn 51 to (2,2) or (3,1), say (2,2), then turn 52 to (2,3) or (1,2) or (2,1), not (3,5).\n\nTo reach (3,5), I need to go up from (3,2), but (3,3) is occupied until the snake moves away.\n\nIn the positions, (3,3) is occupied until the tail moves, but tail is at (2,3) on turn 50? Let's not track all.\n\nIt might be tight, and I might not reach in time or get stuck.\n\nWhereas in the up path, I eat both foods easily.\n\nTherefore, moving up on turn 44 is better.\n\nSo for turn 44, action should be U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan as above.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns.\n\nSince the question says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term\", but output the actions.\n\nIn the format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nI think I should provide a sequence for, say, 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 44 to 49, I have actions.\n\nTurn 44: U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 45: U to (6,6) eat\n\nThen turn 46: L to (5,6)\n\nTurn 47: D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 48: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 49: L to (3,5) eat\n\nBut on turn 47, from (5,6) I could move L to (4,6) instead of D to (5,5), but going to (5,5) allows me to go left to (4,5) and then to (3,5).\n\nIf I move L to (4,6) on turn 47, then head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 48, from (4,6), can move L to (3,6), U to (4,7) wall invalid, D to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is where the tail was, but now it might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 46: head at (5,6), positions as before.\n\nIf on turn 47 move L to (4,6), not food, so new positions: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (1,3), seg11 (1,4), seg12 (1,5) tail at (1,5).\n\nThen head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nTurn 48: possible moves L to (3,6), U invalid, D to (4,5), R to (5,6) occupied, invalid.\n\n(3,6) free? Not occupied.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nIf move D to (4,5), then I can go to (3,5) next.\n\nIf move L to (3,6), then head at (3,6), which is where tail was, but now free.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nOn turn 49.\n\nBut (3,5) food is at (3,5), so from (3,6) move D to (3,5) eat.\n\nSimilar, but I go via (4,6) and (3,6) to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,6) was tail, but now free.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating on turn 49 same.\n\nBut in the first way, via (5,5) and (4,5), I am closer to the food earlier.\n\nBut both work.\n\nI think the path I first had is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 44.\n\nAlso, confirm if on turn 44 moving U is safe.\n\nCurrent head at (6,4), move U to (6,5), free.\n\nThen on turn 45, move U to (6,6), free and food.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf I move D to (6,3), also free, but worse as above.\n\nSo decision: move U on turn 44.\n\nThen for future turns, I can provide the sequence as planned.\n\nBut the snake might face choices, but since I need to output actions, I'll output for several turns.\n\nSay for 5 turns: turn 44 to 48 or 49.\n\nSince turn 49 I eat the second food.\n\nBut the answer format might expect actions without explanation.\n\nAlso, in turn 47, I chose D to (5,5), but L to (4,6) is also possible, but D to (5,5) is better to go towards (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), from (5,6), (5,5) is south, closer to y=5.\n\n(4,6) is east, same y=6 as (3,5) is y=5.\n\n(3,5) y=5, (4,6) y=6, so moving D to (5,5) y=5 is better.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) to (4,5) is down to y=5.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nAnd on turn 49: L to eat, but I may not need to output turn 49 if not required, but I can.\n\nThe sequence can be until turn 48 or include 49.\n\nSince the state is turn 44, and I think ahead 5 turns, to turn 49.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps output 5 actions: turn 44 to 48.\n\nTurn 49 is the 6th turn.\n\nBut the \"5+ turns\" might mean thinking ahead, not necessarily outputting 5.\n\nI think I should output from turn 44 to turn 49, as per the plan.\n\nIn the format, it can be multiple.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (6,6) due to its shorter life span (available until turn 49), followed by the food at (3,5) (available until turn 52). The initial move on turn 44 must avoid the wall at x=7 and the reverse direction (left, since current direction is right), leaving only up or down as options. Moving up to (6,5) positions the snake to eat (6,6) on turn 45, scoring immediately and avoiding the risk of missing this food. Moving down would lead the snake away from both foods, potentially missing (6,6) and reducing scoring opportunities.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), the snake must navigate towards (3,5) while avoiding walls and body collisions. The planned sequence (turns 44-49) eats both foods safely:\n\n- **Turn 44**: Move up to (6,5) to approach (6,6) food.\n- **Turn 45**: Move up to (6,6) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 13).\n- **Turn 46**: Move left to (5,6), as up and right are blocked by walls.\n- **Turn 47**: Move down to (5,5) to head towards (3,5).\n- **Turn 48**: Move left to (4,5), adjacent to (3,5) food.\n- **Turn 49**: Move left to (3,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 14).\n\nThis sequence scores 2 points by turn 49, uses the available food efficiently, and avoids all collisions. Thinking beyond turn 49, the snake can explore the left side of the grid for additional food or survival, but the immediate actions focus on the high-reward, low-risk path.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 44: U \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: L \\\\\nTurn 47: D \\\\\nTurn 48: L \\\\\nTurn 49: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), because x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6 to avoid the borders. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are safe, except for internal obstacles.\n\nThere's an internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after turn 45 + 5 = 50? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 45, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one. After 5 turns, on turn 50, it might disappear, but since it decreases each turn, including current, after turn 45, it has 4 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t + N or something. I need to be careful.\n\nTypically in such games, if a food has life span L at turn t, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears. For example, at turn 45, life span 5, it will be gone after turn 49? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at turn t, life span is L. After turn t, countdown decreases to L-1. If L-1 > 0, it stays; when countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span L, then during turn t, it can be eaten, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nBut it says \"disappears after N turns\", so for food with initial life span N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1 or something. Let's not overcomplicate; I can just use the life span value.\n\nFor this food: at turn 45, (6,6) has life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 45 to turn 49, and disappears at turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) has life span 8, so it lasts until turn 45 + 8 - 1 = 52? Better to think: with life span L at turn t, it has L turns left, including current.\n\nAfter each turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo at turn 45, life span 5: after turn 45, it becomes 4; after turn 46, 3; ... after turn 49, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 45,46,47,48,49.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) with life span 8: can be eaten from turn 45 to 52.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer should include actions for turn 45, 46, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"maximize score\", but the output is a sequence of actions starting from turn 45.\n\nThe answer format is: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. But it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should probably plan for at least 5 turns, but the actions are for immediate turns, I think I need to output the action for each turn as it comes, but since I'm simulating, I can output a sequence.\n\nBut the state might change after each action, especially with food life span decreasing.\n\nI think for this response, since no new food spawns or anything, I can simulate multiple turns.\n\nBut food life span decreases, so I need to consider that.\n\nAlso, the snake grows when it eats positive food.\n\nCurrent snake head at (6,5), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nFirst, no instant reverse: since current direction is Up, I cannot move Down on the next turn. So possible moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nNow, check the grid.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells outside 1-6 in x or y are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collision.\n\nSnake: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo body segments: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). Head is at (6,5), so the body is all except head.\n\nFor collision, head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, because when it moves, the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically, when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so if the head moves to the current tail position, it's ok, because the tail will move, so no collision.\n\nBut if it moves to any other body segment, it collides.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, current head position (6,5)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (6,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (6,4), but (6,4) is a body segment, and since it's not the tail, it would collide. Tail is at (2,6), I think. Snake positions: head (6,5), then body: (6,4) is next, which is the neck, then (5,4), etc., down to tail at (2,6).\n\nPositions: index 0: head (6,5), 1: (6,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (1,6), 11: tail (2,6)\n\nSo tail is at (2,6).\n\nNow, if head moves to (6,4), which is the position of segment 1, that would cause collision because (6,4) is occupied and not the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if it moves to any other body cell, collision.\n\nOnly if it moves to the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n\nBut in this case, for Down to (6,4), (6,4) is not the tail; tail is (2,6), so moving to (6,4) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, Left (L): to (5,5)\n\nWhat is at (5,5)? From snake positions, (5,5) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSnake has: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), ... no (5,5), so (5,5) is free.\n\nRight (R): to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision with wall.\n\nUp (U): to (6,6), which has food, but let's see what's there.\n\n(6,6) has food with value 1.\n\nBut also, (6,6) might be occupied or not? Snake positions: (1,6) and (2,6), but not (6,6), so (6,6) is free except for the food.\n\nFood is on the cell, but the cell might be empty or occupied by snake, but in this case, snake doesn't occupy (6,6), so it's free.\n\nFood can be on empty cells or under snake body, but here it's not under snake.\n\nNow, Down (D) is invalid because (6,4) is body.\n\nRight (R) is invalid because (7,5) is wall.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (6,6) or Left to (5,5).\n\nUp to (6,6) has food.\n\nIf I move Up to (6,6), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, value 1, so snake grows by one segment. After eating, the head moves to (6,6), and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, I think? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail stays where it is, but since the head moved, the body follows, but when eating, the length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo when snake eats food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail position remains the same for that turn? No.\n\nTypically: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail moves away.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, but instead of the tail moving away, a new segment is added, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nSo for example, if head moves to food cell, the new head position is that cell, and the body shifts, but since length increases, the last segment (tail) doesn't disappear; it stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was? I think I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard mechanics:\n\n- When snake moves and does not eat: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail leaves its position.\n\n- When snake eats: head moves to food cell, a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail position remains, but the segment that was tail is no longer tail; the new tail is the added segment or something.\n\nAfter eating, the snake length increases by one, so when moving, the head goes to new position, and the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the new position becomes part of the body.\n\nFor example: suppose snake positions: [head, body..., tail]\n\nAfter moving to an empty cell: new positions [new_head, old_head, body..., ] and tail is removed? No.\n\nIn the sequence, the positions are stored.\n\nLet’s say at time t, positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n\nAfter moving to a new cell Q without eating: new positions: Q (new head), P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1} (new tail). So the segment at Pk is gone.\n\nIf moving to a food cell and eating: new positions: Q (new head), P0, P1, ..., Pk (so the tail stays, and length increases).\n\nThen next time, when moving without eating, the tail Pk will be left behind.\n\nIn terms of the grid, when you eat, the cell that was tail remains occupied, but since head moved away, it's fine.\n\nBack to this case.\n\nIf I move Up to (6,6), I eat the food at (6,6), so snake grows: new head at (6,6), and the tail stays, so the positions become: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., up to tail (2,6), and since I ate, I add a new segment, so the new tail is (2,6), and the previous tail position is still occupied, but now it's not tail anymore.\n\nPositions: after moving up to (6,6) and eating, new positions: [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) ] but since I ate, I add a new segment, so the tail (2,6) remains, and I add a new position? I think I need to append a new segment.\n\nStandard: after eating, the snake has one more segment, so the position list has an extra element.\n\nBefore: 12 segments.\n\nAfter eating: 13 segments.\n\nNew head position: (6,6)\n\nThen the previous head (6,5) becomes segment 1, (6,4) segment 2, ..., down to (2,6) which was segment 11 (index 11), but since we add a new segment, (2,6) is still there, and we add a copy or something? No.\n\nTypically, when you eat, you don't remove the tail; you keep it, so the positions are: new head, then all previous positions.\n\nFor example, positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to food: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and since you ate, T is still there, and no removal, so length increased by one.\n\nIn this case, new_head is (6,6), H is (6,5), B1 is (6,4), etc., T is (2,6).\n\nSo new positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nAnd tail is still (2,6), but now it's not the last segment; the last segment is (2,6), but it's the same position, occupied.\n\nBut (2,6) was already occupied, so it's fine, no change in that cell.\n\nNow, if I move Left to (5,5), no food there, so no eat, then new positions: head to (5,5), then (6,5) becomes body, (6,4) body, ..., and tail (2,6) is removed, so the cell (2,6) becomes empty.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,5) is empty, no food, so snake moves without growing.\n\nNew positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., (1,6), and (2,6) is gone? Positions: after moving, head to (5,5), then the previous head (6,5) is now first body, then (6,4) second body, ..., up to (1,6) which was segment 10, and (2,6) was segment 11, tail, is removed, so not in new positions.\n\nNew positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  so 12 segments, tail at (1,6).\n\nBefore moving, positions had 12 segments: indices 0 to 11.\n\nAfter moving to empty cell, new head, then segments 0 to 10 become body, segment 11 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: new head, then seg0, seg1, ..., seg10.\n\nHere seg0 is (6,5), seg1 (6,4), ..., seg10 is (1,6), seg11 was (2,6) removed.\n\nSo new tail is seg10, which was (1,6).\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 45.\n\nI can move Up to (6,6) and eat food, or Left to (5,5) no eat.\n\nBut there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for moving to (6,6): the tail is at (2,6), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (6,5), tail at (2,6), distance is |6-2| + |5-6| = 4+1=5, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(6,5) and (2,6) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) has food, not the tail cell.\n\nTail cell is (2,6), which has no food mentioned, so no food there.\n\nSo moving Up to (6,6) should be safe and I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is another food at (3,5) with value 1, life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, after moving, what happens.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the grid and future moves.\n\nFirst, let's list all free cells to see the space.\n\nGrid 6x6, but walls and obstacles.\n\nCells: x 1-6, y 1-6.\n\nBlocked: internal (5,2)\n\nSnake occupies: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo occupied cells: all above.\n\nFree cells: let's list them.\n\nFor y=1: all free? x=1 to 6, except (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,2) is y=2.\n\ny from 1 to 6.\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — all free, no snake or obstacle.\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) obstacle, (6,2)\n\nSnake has (5,3) etc., but not on y=2 except (5,2) blocked, so (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2) free.\n\ny=3: (1,3) snake, (2,3) snake, (3,3) snake, (4,3) snake, (5,3) snake, (6,3) free? Not listed, so free.\n\ny=4: (1,4) snake, (2,4) free? Not listed, (3,4) free, (4,4) free, (5,4) snake, (6,4) snake\n\nList:\n\n(1,4) snake\n\n(2,4) not in snake positions, so free\n\n(3,4) not, free\n\n(4,4) not, free\n\n(5,4) snake\n\n(6,4) snake\n\ny=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) free? Not listed, (3,5) has food, but not occupied by snake, (4,5) free, (5,5) free, (6,5) snake head\n\ny=6: (1,6) snake, (2,6) snake, (3,6) free, (4,6) free, (5,6) free, (6,6) food\n\nAlso, food at (3,5) and (6,6)\n\nNow, if I move Up to (6,6) at turn 45:\n\n- Eat food, +1 score, snake grows to 13 segments.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) — tail (2,6)\n\nDirection was Up, so new head direction Up.\n\nLife span of (6,6) food: eaten, so removed.\n\n(3,5) food life span decreases to 7? After turn 45, when we move, at the end of turn, life span decreases.\n\nBut since we output action for turn 45, then for next turns.\n\nAfter action, the state updates.\n\nFor turn 45 action: I choose to move Up.\n\nThen for turn 46, I need to choose next action.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nIf I move Left to (5,5), no eat, then new head at (5,5), positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — tail (1,6)\n\nDirection: moved Left, so new direction Left.\n\n(6,6) food still there, life span now 4 for next turn? After turn 45, if not eaten, life span decreases to 4.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) to 7.\n\nNow, comparing the two options.\n\nIf I go Up to (6,6), I get the food now, but the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver in the future, especially in a small grid.\n\nThe grid has free space, but snake is long, 13 segments after eating.\n\nIf I don't eat, snake is 12, and I can go to (5,5), then I have options.\n\nBut (6,6) food has only 5 turns life, so if I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but it might be risky or not possible.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 45, so if not eaten on turn 45, on turn 46 it has life span 4, and so on.\n\nBut I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's see the position.\n\nAlso, there is the other food at (3,5).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both if possible, but I need to avoid dying.\n\nFirst, let's consider the safe paths.\n\nFrom (6,5), moving Up to (6,6) seems safe.\n\nMoving Left to (5,5) also safe.\n\nNow, after moving to (5,5), at turn 46, head at (5,5), direction Left.\n\nPossible moves: since direction Left, cannot move Right (instant reverse).\n\nSo can move U, D, L.\n\nNow, cells:\n\n- U: (5,6)\n\n- D: (5,4)\n\n- L: (4,5)\n\n(5,6) is free, has no food.\n\n(5,4) is body segment? Current positions after turn 45 move to (5,5): positions (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ... (5,4) is the fourth segment, so occupied, not tail.\n\nTail is (1,6).\n\nSo (5,4) is body, so moving to (5,4) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is free, no snake.\n\nAnd (5,6) free.\n\nAlso, R to (6,5) but (6,5) is the first body segment, so occupied, and cannot move right anyway because direction left, cannot reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,5): U to (5,6), or L to (4,5). D to (5,4) invalid.\n\nIf I go to (5,6), no food, or to (4,5), no food.\n\nThen I can go to (6,6) later, but from (5,5), to go to (6,6), I need to move Right, but at turn 46, from (5,5), if I move U to (5,6), then at turn 47, head at (5,6), direction Up (if I moved U), then I can move R to (6,6), since not reverse.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (4,5), then from there, to go to (6,6) is farther.\n\nBut (6,6) food might expire soon.\n\nLife span: at turn 45, if not eaten, after turn 45, life span 4 for turn 46.\n\nThen turn 46, if not eaten, life span 3, and so on.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 46 or 47, etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it.\n\nIf at turn 45 I move Left to (5,5), then at turn 46 I can move Up to (5,6), then at turn 47 move Right to (6,6), eating the food.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5), I could go directly, but I can't go right because direction.\n\nFrom (5,5), after moving left, direction left, so at turn 46, I can only go U, D, L, not R.\n\nSo to go to (6,6), I need to go via (5,6) or something.\n\n(5,6) to (6,6) is right, which is possible if direction is up or down, not left.\n\nIf I move to (5,6) at turn 46, direction Up, then at turn 47, I can move Right to (6,6), since not reverse of up.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 45, I can eat at turn 47.\n\nBut at turn 47, the food might still be there if life span allows.\n\nAt turn 45, life span 5, so on turn 46:4, turn 47:3, turn 48:2, etc., so on turn 47, life span 3, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (3,5) has life span 8, so up to turn 52.\n\nBut when I eat, I grow, so longer snake.\n\nIf I eat the (6,6) food now at turn 45, snake length 13, and head at (6,6).\n\nThen at turn 46, head at (6,6), direction Up (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U, but (6,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n\nD: to (6,5), which is the first body segment now. After eating, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), etc., so (6,5) is occupied by body, not tail. Tail is (2,6).\n\nSo moving down to (6,5) would collide.\n\nL: to (5,6)\n\nR: to (7,6) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is Left to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, no food.\n\nSo I have to move to (5,6).\n\nThen new head at (5,6), direction Left (since moved left).\n\nNow, at turn 46, from (5,6), possible moves.\n\nDirection Left, so cannot move Right.\n\nU: (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (5,5)\n\nL: (4,6)\n\n(5,5) is occupied? Current positions: after turn 45, head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo (5,5) not occupied, free.\n\n(4,6) free.\n\nD to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\nBoth possible.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), no food, or to (4,6), no food.\n\nThen from there, I can try to go to the other food at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nNow, from (5,6), if I move to (4,6), then to (3,6), etc., or to (5,5) then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see the space.\n\nThe snake is long, and the lower part is crowded.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 45, and move to (5,5) instead.\n\nAt turn 45, move Left to (5,5), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — tail (1,6)\n\nDirection Left.\n\nAt turn 46, from (5,5), can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied, invalid. So only U or L.\n\nSay I move U to (5,6), no food there.\n\nNew head (5,6), direction Up (since moved up from (5,5)? Direction: moved from (6,5) to (5,5) left, so direction left. Then from (5,5) to (5,6) up, so new direction up.\n\nThen at turn 47, from (5,6), direction up, can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nU: (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nL: (4,6)\n\nR: (6,6) has food.\n\nSo I can move Right to (6,6) and eat food.\n\nLife span of (6,6): at turn 45, if not eaten, after turn 45 life span 4. After turn 46, if not eaten, life span 3. So at turn 47, life span 3, can be eaten.\n\nSo I eat at turn 47, score +1, snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (6,6) at turn 45, I eat earlier, but then I'm at (6,6) with fewer options.\n\nIn terms of score, I get the point either way, but if I eat later, I have a shorter snake for one more turn, which might be beneficial for maneuvering.\n\nBut the food at (6,6) is the same, so score is the same whether I eat at 45 or 47.\n\nBut by eating at 45, I grow earlier, which might make it harder to reach other food or avoid dead ends.\n\nThe other food is at (3,5), which I also want to eat.\n\nNow, let's consider the path to (3,5).\n\nFrom current position (6,5), if I move Left to (5,5), then I can go towards (3,5).\n\nFor example, from (5,5), at turn 46, I could move Left to (4,5), which is closer to (3,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, no food.\n\nThen from there, to (3,5) is adjacent, but (3,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut at turn 46, from (4,5), direction left (if I moved left from (5,5)).\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 45: move L to (5,5)\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail (1,6)\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) free, no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail (1,5)? Previous tail was (1,6), removed.\n\nPositions: new head (4,5), then previous head (5,5), then previous body (6,5), (6,4), ..., up to (1,5) which was segment 10, so new tail (1,5).\n\nSegments: after move, head (4,5), then seg0: (5,5), seg1: (6,5), seg2: (6,4), seg3: (5,4), seg4: (5,3), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (3,3), seg7: (2,3), seg8: (1,3), seg9: (1,4), seg10: (1,5) tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction left (since moved left).\n\n(3,5) is left of (4,5), so adjacent.\n\nAt turn 47, I can move Left to (3,5) and eat the food there.\n\nDirection left, so moving left is allowed, not reverse.\n\n(3,5) has food, value 1, so eat, grow.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) and add new segment, so tail remains (1,5) or something.\n\nAfter eating, positions: new head (3,5), then previous positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ..., (1,5), so all previous segments, tail at (1,5).\n\nSince ate, length increases, so tail stays.\n\nNow, I have eaten both foods: (6,6) not eaten yet, but in this path, I went to (4,5) then to (3,5), so I didn't eat (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is still there, life span decreasing.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 45 I moved to (5,5), turn 46 to (4,5), turn 47 to (3,5) and eat.\n\nThen I have score +1 from (3,5), snake length 13.\n\nBut (6,6) food is still there, with less life span.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction left, so cannot move right.\n\nU: (3,6)\n\nD: (3,4)\n\nL: (2,5)\n\nR: (4,5) but (4,5) is body segment, occupied, invalid.\n\nAlso, (2,5) might be free, (3,6) free, (3,4) free? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nSo (3,6) free, (3,4) free? (3,4) not listed, but y=4, (3,4) is not occupied, in positions we have (3,3), (3,5), but not (3,4), so free.\n\nSimilarly (2,5) free.\n\n(4,5) occupied.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5)\n\nAll possible.\n\nNow, I can go back to (6,6) if I want, but it's far.\n\n(6,6) at (6,6), head at (3,5), distance.\n\nLife span of (6,6): at turn 45, not eaten, after turn 45: life span 4, after turn 46:3, after turn 47:2 (since eaten at turn 47, but (6,6) not eaten, so after turn 47, life span 2? Let's track.\n\nTurn 45: (6,6) life span 5, not eaten, after turn 45, decreases to 4.\n\nTurn 46: life span 4, not eaten, after turn 46, decreases to 3.\n\nTurn 47: life span 3, not eaten, after turn 47, decreases to 2.\n\nSo on turn 48, life span 2, can be eaten.\n\nBut to reach (6,6) from (3,5) in few turns: minimum moves: need to go right and up, but with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, so I need to go around.\n\nTo (3,6) or (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nThen to (6,6), it might take several turns, and with long snake, it might be tight.\n\nIf I had eaten (6,6) first, I might be in a better position to eat (3,5).\n\nBut let's compare the two strategies.\n\nFirst strategy: eat (6,6) at turn 45.\n\nTurn 45: move U to (6,6), eat, grow to 13, head at (6,6), dir Up.\n\nThen only move possible: L to (5,6), turn 46.\n\nHead (5,6), dir Left.\n\nThen at turn 46, from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6), etc.\n\n(5,5) is free, as before.\n\nSay move D to (5,5), no food.\n\nThen head (5,5), dir Down (since moved down from (5,6)? From (6,6) to (5,6) left, dir left. Then to (5,5) down, so new dir down.\n\nThen at turn 47, from (5,5), dir down, can move D, L, R (not U).\n\nD to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? Positions: after turn 46, if moved to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) since grew at turn 45.\n\nAfter turn 45: positions with 13 segments: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nAfter turn 46 move to (5,6): new head (5,6), then previous head (6,6), then body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and tail (2,6) removed? No.\n\nMoving to (5,6), no eat, so new positions: head (5,6), then seg0: (6,6), seg1: (6,5), seg2: (6,4), seg3: (5,4), seg4: (5,3), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (3,3), seg7: (2,3), seg8: (1,3), seg9: (1,4), seg10: (1,5), seg11: (1,6)  and seg12: (2,6) removed. So new tail is (1,6).\n\nPositions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail (1,6)\n\nNow at turn 47, from (5,6), if I move D to (5,5), (5,5) is free, no food.\n\nNew head (5,5), dir down.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nNow head at (5,5), dir down.\n\nTo go to (3,5), I need to move left.\n\nAt turn 48, from (5,5), dir down, can move L to (4,5), or D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied, invalid, or R to (6,5) occupied, U to (5,6) occupied, so only L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) free, no food.\n\nMove to (4,5), dir left.\n\nThen at turn 49, from (4,5), dir left, can move L to (3,5), which has food, eat.\n\nLife span of (3,5): at turn 45, life span 8, after turn 45:7, after turn 46:6, after turn 47:5, so at turn 49, after decreases, life span 3 or something, but can be eaten.\n\nEat at turn 49, score +1.\n\nSo in this case, I ate (6,6) at turn 45 and (3,5) at turn 49.\n\nScore: two points.\n\nIf I didn't eat (6,6) at turn 45, but ate (3,5) at turn 47, as in the second path.\n\nThen at turn 47, after eating (3,5), head at (3,5), dir left.\n\nThen (6,6) food is still there, life span: after turn 47, life span 2 for turn 48.\n\nCan I reach (6,6) from (3,5) in one or two moves? No, minimum distance |3-6| + |5-6| = 3+1=4 cells, so at least 4 moves, but life span only 2 turns left? On turn 48, life span 2, can be eaten on turn 48 or 49? Life span decreases after each turn.\n\nAt turn 48, if life span 2, it can be eaten during turn 48, and after that, decreases to 1, then on turn 49, if not eaten, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 48 or 49.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 47, after eating, positions long.\n\nAt turn 48, from (3,5), can move to (3,6), (3,4), or (2,5).\n\nNone are close to (6,6).\n\nFor example, move to (3,6), then at turn 49, from (3,6), can move to (3,7) wall, or (2,6), or (4,6), etc.\n\n(2,6) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 47: positions head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nAt turn 48, move to (3,6), for example.\n\n(3,6) free, no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail (1,4)\n\nThen at turn 49, from (3,6), dir up (if moved up), can move to (4,6) or (2,6) or (3,7) invalid.\n\n(4,6) free, (2,6) might be free? (2,6) was tail, but moved away, so free.\n\nIn positions, (2,6) not in current, so free.\n\nMove to (4,6), for example.\n\nThen from there, (6,6) is two steps away, but life span: on turn 49, if life span 1, can be eaten, but after turn 49, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nBut from (4,6) at turn 49, I can move to (5,6) or (4,5), etc., not directly to (6,6) if direction.\n\nHead at (3,6) after turn 48 move, dir up.\n\nThen at turn 49, move to (4,6), dir right? (3,6) to (4,6) is right, so new dir right.\n\nThen at turn 50, from (4,6), dir right, can move to (5,6) or (4,5) or (4,7) invalid, etc.\n\n(5,6) free, move to (5,6), no food.\n\nThen at turn 51, from (5,6), can move to (6,6), but by turn 51, (6,6) food is gone, since life span 0 after turn 49 or something.\n\n(6,6) at turn 48 life span 2, eaten on turn 48 or 49.\n\nTurn 48: life span 2, if eaten on turn 48, ok.\n\nBut on turn 48, head is at (3,6) or wherever, not near.\n\nTurn 49: life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nBut on turn 49, from above, if at (4,6), I can move to (5,6), not to (6,6) directly.\n\nThen turn 50 to (6,6), but on turn 50, food might be gone.\n\nLife span: after turn 49, if not eaten, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not available on turn 50.\n\nSo last chance to eat (6,6) is turn 49.\n\nBut on turn 49, if I am at (4,6), I can only move to (5,6) or other, not to (6,6) directly, since not adjacent.\n\n(4,6) to (6,6) is not adjacent, so I cannot reach it on turn 49.\n\nIf I am at (3,6) on turn 49, I could move to (4,6) or (2,6), not to (6,6).\n\nSo impossible to eat (6,6) after turn 47 if I am at (3,5).\n\nTherefore, if I prioritize eating (3,5) first, I miss the (6,6) food.\n\nWhereas if I eat (6,6) first, I can still eat (3,5) later, as I did around turn 49.\n\nIn the first strategy, I ate both.\n\nIn the second, I ate only (3,5) and missed (6,6).\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (6,6) first at turn 45.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) has shorter life span, only 5 turns, while (3,5) has 8, so I should eat the one with shorter life first to not miss it.\n\nIn this case, yes.\n\nAlso, in terms of risk, moving to (6,6) at turn 45 is safe.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not applicable here, as tail is far.\n\nSo I think for turn 45, move Up to (6,6).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan to eat the other food at (3,5).\n\nAfter turn 45: head at (6,6), dir Up.\n\nTurn 46: only possible move Left to (5,6), as before.\n\nNo eat.\n\nHead (5,6), dir Left.\n\nNow turn 46: from (5,6), possible moves: U invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6).\n\nBoth free, no food.\n\nI can go to (5,5) or (4,6).\n\nTo reach (3,5), going to (5,5) is better.\n\n(5,5) is closer to (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,6) to (5,5) is down.\n\nMove D to (5,5).\n\nThen head (5,5), dir Down.\n\nNow turn 47: from (5,5), dir down, possible moves: L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but (6,5) occupied, D to (5,4) occupied, U to (5,6) occupied, so only L to (4,5).\n\nMove to (4,5), no food.\n\nHead (4,5), dir Left (since moved left).\n\nNow turn 48: from (4,5), dir left, possible moves: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) has food, so move L to (3,5) and eat.\n\nEat positive food, grow to 14 segments? Original was 12, ate (6,6) so 13, now eat (3,5) so 14.\n\nLife span of (3,5): at turn 45, 8, after turn 45:7, after turn 46:6, after turn 47:5, after turn 48:4? When eaten on turn 48.\n\nAt turn 48, life span: after decreases from turn 47.\n\nTurn 45: life span 8\n\nAfter turn 45: decreases to 7\n\nTurn 46: life span 7, after turn 46: decreases to 6\n\nTurn 47: life span 6, after turn 47: decreases to 5\n\nTurn 48: life span 5, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 45: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,6) no eat? From (6,6) to (5,6) is left, so move L.\n\nIn action, it's direction.\n\nThen turn 47: from (5,6) to (5,5) down, move D.\n\nThen turn 48: from (5,5) to (4,5) left, move L.\n\nThen turn 49: from (4,5) to (3,5) left, move L and eat.\n\nBut at turn 49? Turn 48 I moved to (4,5), then turn 49 to (3,5).\n\nLet's list turns.\n\nStart turn 45: action for turn 45.\n\nAfter action, turn increases.\n\nSo:\n\n- Turn 45: move U to (6,6), eat food, positions update.\n\n- Turn 46: from (6,6), move L to (5,6), no eat.\n\n- Turn 47: from (5,6), move D to (5,5), no eat.\n\n- Turn 48: from (5,5), move L to (4,5), no eat.\n\n- Turn 49: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), eat food.\n\nBut on turn 49, from (4,5) to (3,5) left, and eat.\n\nIn turn 48, I am at (4,5), but I moved to (4,5) on turn 48 action, so at start of turn 49, I am at (4,5), then move to (3,5).\n\nYes.\n\nBut I can optimize.\n\nFrom turn 46, at (5,6), instead of moving down to (5,5), I could move left to (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go to (4,5), etc., but similar.\n\nBut (4,6) to (3,5) is not direct; need to go to (4,5) first or something.\n\n(4,6) to (3,5) not adjacent, diagonal not allowed.\n\nSo must go through (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) might be free.\n\nBut from (4,6), to (3,5), I need two moves: e.g., to (4,5) then to (3,5), or to (3,6) then to (3,5).\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn the path I have, it's fine.\n\nAfter eating both, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can just move around safely.\n\nBut since no more food, score is maximized at 2.\n\nIf I don't eat one, I get only 1.\n\nSo better to eat both.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but doesn't specify how many.\n\nSince I planned to turn 49, I can output up to there, but after turn 49, I need to continue or stop?\n\nI think for the purpose, I can output until I eat the second food or something.\n\nSince the thinking is 5+ turns ahead, and t1=45, I can output for 5 turns: 45 to 49.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions for 45,46,47,48,49.\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: L (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 47: D (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 48: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 49: L (to (3,5) eat)\n\nBut at turn 49, I eat, so after that, I can stop or continue, but I think outputting these is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, at turn 47, from (5,6) to (5,5), direction changes.\n\nBut all moves are valid.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but in this path, I didn't go near it, so no issue.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not a problem here.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n\nBut at turn 45, if I move left to (5,5), I might eat (3,5) faster, but miss (6,6), so worse.\n\nSo move Up is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 45, action: U\n\nThen for subsequent, as above.\n\nIn the answer, I need to write the sequence.\n\nAlso, for turn 46, from (5,6), I could move to (4,6) instead, but it might not be better.\n\nFor example, if I move to (4,6) at turn 46.\n\nFrom (5,6) move L to (4,6), no eat.\n\nThen head (4,6), dir left.\n\nThen turn 47: from (4,6), can move L to (3,6), D to (4,5), U invalid.\n\n(3,6) free, (4,5) free.\n\nIf I move to (4,5), then to (3,5) next turn.\n\nSame as before: turn 47 to (4,5), turn 48 to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut (3,5) eaten at turn 48 instead of 49? Let's see.\n\nTurn 46: move to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 47: from (4,6) move to (4,5), for example, dir down or left? Move to (4,5) is down, so dir down.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,5) move to (3,5) left, eat.\n\nSo eaten at turn 48.\n\nIn the first path, eaten at turn 49.\n\nBut in first path, after turn 45 U, turn 46 L to (5,6), turn 47 D to (5,5), turn 48 L to (4,5), turn 49 L to (3,5) eat.\n\nIf from (5,6) at turn 46, I move L to (4,6), then turn 47 move D to (4,5), then turn 48 move L to (3,5) eat.\n\nSo (3,5) eaten at turn 48, one turn earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) eaten at turn 45.\n\nSo better to go to (4,6) at turn 46.\n\nFrom (5,6), moving to (4,6) instead of (5,5).\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: L (to (5,6)? No, turn 46 from (6,6) to (5,6) is L, done.\n\nThen at turn 46 position (5,6), I choose to move L to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 47: from (4,6) move to (4,5) or to (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is better for going to (3,5).\n\nMove D to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,5) move L to (3,5) and eat.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd at turn 48, I eat (3,5).\n\nLife span: on turn 48, life span 5, as before.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: L (from (6,6) to (5,6))\n\nTurn 47: D? From (5,6) to (4,6) is L, but I moved L to (4,6), so action L.\n\nThen at (4,6), move to (4,5) down, so action D for turn 47? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 46 action: move L to (4,6)? No.\n\nAfter turn 45: head at (6,6)\n\nTurn 46 action: move L to (5,6) — action L\n\nNow head at (5,6), direction left.\n\nTurn 47 action: I can move L to (4,6) — action L\n\nThen head at (4,6), direction left (since moved left from (5,6))\n\nTurn 48 action: from (4,6), move D to (4,5) — action D\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction down.\n\nTurn 49 action: move L to (3,5) — but direction down, moving left is allowed? Yes, not reverse.\n\nMove to (3,5) and eat.\n\nBut at turn 49, but I can eat at turn 48 if I move directly.\n\nFrom (4,6) at turn 48, I move to (4,5), then at turn 49 to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), which is left and down from (4,6)? Not adjacent directly.\n\n(4,6) to (3,5) is diagonal, not allowed, so I need to go to (4,5) or (3,6) first.\n\nSo minimum two moves from (4,6) to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) it's the same.\n\nIn the first alternative, with (5,5), I reached (4,5) at turn 48, then eat at turn 49.\n\nWith (4,6) at turn 47 (after move), then move to (4,5) at turn 48, then to (3,5) at turn 49.\n\nSame number of turns to eat (3,5).\n\nIn both cases, eaten at turn 49 or after.\n\nIn the (4,6) path: after turn 47 move to (4,6), then turn 48 move to (4,5), turn 49 move to (3,5) eat.\n\nIn the other path with (5,5): after turn 47 move to (5,5), turn 48 to (4,5), turn 49 to (3,5) eat.\n\nSame.\n\nBut in the (4,6) path, at turn 47 I am at (4,6), which is closer to the top, but not necessarily better.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI'll go with the first one I thought.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, after eating, I should continue to survive, but since no food, it's just moving without dying.\n\nBut for the output, I can output until turn 49 or so.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, outputting for 5 turns: 45 to 49.\n\nBut turn 45 to 49 is 5 actions.\n\nt1=45, so turns 45,46,47,48,49.\n\nActions: U, L, D, L, L for the first path.\n\nIn the sequence: turn45 U, turn46 L (to (5,6)), turn47 D (to (5,5)), turn48 L (to (4,5)), turn49 L (to (3,5))\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, ensure no risks.\n\nAt turn 48, moving to (4,5): is it safe? From (5,5) to (4,5), left, and (4,5) was free, and after move, positions update, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead (turns 45 to 49). The key considerations are:\n- Eat the food at (6,6) first due to its shorter life span (5 turns at turn 45), ensuring it is not missed.\n- Then navigate towards the food at (3,5) efficiently, as it has a longer life span (8 turns at turn 45) and can be eaten later.\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body by carefully selecting moves that respect movement constraints and the snake's growth.\n- The snake starts at length 12. Eating (6,6) increases length to 13, and eating (3,5) increases it to 14.\n\n### Move Sequence Explanation:\n- **Turn 45 (Current State)**: Move Up (U) to (6,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score). This is safe and prioritizes the food with shorter life span. After eating, the snake grows to length 13, and the head direction becomes Up.\n- **Turn 46**: Move Left (L) to (5,6). This is the only safe move from (6,6) (Down collides with body, Right and Up are walls). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 47**: Move Down (D) to (5,5). From (5,6), Down is safe (Left to (4,6) is also possible but Down is more direct for reaching (3,5)). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 48**: Move Left (L) to (4,5). From (5,5), Left is the only safe move (Down to (5,4) and Up to (5,6) collide with body, Right to (6,5) is body and invalid due to direction constraint). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 49**: Move Left (L) to (3,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score). From (4,5), Left is safe and eats the food. The snake grows to length 14.\n\nThis sequence eats both food items by turn 49, maximizing the score to +2. After turn 49, the snake should continue moving safely to avoid collisions, as no more food is present. The moves are validated for no immediate risks:\n- No wall or obstacle collisions (e.g., (5,2) obstacle is avoided).\n- No body collisions (e.g., moves avoid occupied body cells except when moving to the tail position, which is safe but not applicable here).\n- No instant reversals (e.g., after moving Up on turn 45, Down is not chosen on turn 46).\n- Tail reward danger is not a concern, as the tail is never adjacent to the head during these moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: L \\\\\nTurn 47: D \\\\\nTurn 48: L \\\\\nTurn 49: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 46, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) is probably the bottom-left or top-left? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, (0,0) might be the bottom-left or top-left. But since the head direction is given as U for up, and positions are listed, let me plot the snake positions to visualize.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). So the tail is at (2,6).\n\nHead direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction? I need to know the coordinate system. Usually, in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases upwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) is top-right? Let's confirm with positions.\n\nFor example, from (6,6) to (6,5): since head is at (6,6) and next is (6,5), which is down? Head is at (6,6), then body at (6,5), so the snake was moving down to get to (6,5) from (6,6)? But head direction is given as U, which is current direction.\n\nHead direction is U, meaning the snake is currently facing up, so it just moved to (6,6) from previous position. Let's list positions in order: index 0: head (6,6), index 1: (6,5), index 2: (6,4), index 3: (5,4), etc.\n\nSince head is at (6,6) and body at (6,5), that means the snake moved down to (6,6) from (6,5)? But head direction is U, which is up. Contradiction?\n\nI think I have a confusion. The head direction is the direction the snake is facing, meaning the direction it moved to reach the current head position or the direction it will move next? The problem says: \"Snake Head Direction: U/D/L/R\" and in movement, U is (x,y+1).\n\nBut in positions, from the list, the head is at (6,6), and the first body segment is at (6,5), which has a lower y, so if y increases upwards, (6,5) is below (6,6), so the snake was moving down to reach (6,6) from (6,5)? But if it moved down to (6,6), the direction should be D, but it's given as U. That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is the direction it will move next, not the past direction.\n\nLet me read the input: \"Snake Head Direction: U\" and \"Current Turn: 46\", so at turn 46, the snake is at positions, and head direction U means it is facing up, so for the next move, it can choose to move U, L, or R, but not D because of no instant reverse.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo current direction is U (up), so at turn 46, I can choose to move U, L, or R, but not D.\n\nNow, the positions: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), (6,4), etc. So if the snake is facing up, that means from (6,6), moving U would go to (6,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that might be invalid or cause collision.\n\ny=7 is a border wall, so moving to (6,7) is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nFood: (3,5) with life span 7, value 1; and (5,5) with life span 10, value 1. Both are positive food since value +1.\n\nLife span: for (3,5), life span 7 at turn 46, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning on turn 46+7=53, it might be gone? Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at t+1 it is L-1, ..., at t+L it is 0 and disappears.\n\nFor (3,5), life span 7 at turn 46, so countdown 7, will disappear after turn 46+7=53? At turn 53, countdown 0, so disappears before turn 53 or after? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 46, life span 7, after turn 46 it becomes 6, after turn 47 it becomes 5, ..., after turn 52 it becomes 1, after turn 53 it becomes 0 and disappears, so it is present from turn 46 to 52 inclusive? Turn 46: life span 7, present; turn 47: life span 6, present; ... turn 52: life span 1, present; turn 53: life span 0, not present.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5), life span 10 at turn 46, present until turn 55.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake: head (6,6), body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). Tail is (2,6).\n\nTotal segments: 13 segments, so length 13.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,2). So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (5,2).\n\nNow, head at (6,6), direction U (up), so possible moves from (6,6):\n\n- U: to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by body segment, so collision.\n\n- L: to (5,6), is this free? Let's see.\n\n(5,6): not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: x=0,7; y=0,7; (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, R: to (7,6), but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nx=7 is border wall, so (7,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible moves: U invalid (wall), D invalid (body), L to (5,6), R invalid (wall). So only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nCurrent direction is U, but U is blocked, so I must choose L or R, but R is wall, so only L is possible? But L is left, which is not reverse; reverse of U is D, which is not allowed and also blocked.\n\nBut only L is available, so I have to move L to (5,6).\n\nThen after that, I need to plan for future turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(6,6): head\n\nPossible adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (6,5) - occupied by body (index 1), so collision if move there\n\n- Left: (5,6) - not occupied, not wall? Walls: border x=0,7; y=0,7; internal (5,2). (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, not border, not (5,2), so free.\n\n- Right: (7,6) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo yes, only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\nBut then for turn 46, action must be L.\n\nNow, after moving to (5,6), what is the new state?\n\nNew head position: (5,6)\n\nPrevious head was (6,6), now head at (5,6), so direction changed to L (left).\n\nBody segments: the tail will move, so the body shifts. When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\nSpecifically: after moving to (5,6), the new positions: head at (5,6), then previous head (6,6) becomes body, so (5,6), (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., up to (2,6), but (2,6) was tail, so it is removed, and the segment before that was (1,6), which becomes the new tail? Let's list.\n\nCurrent positions before move: indices: 0:(6,6), 1:(6,5), 2:(6,4), 3:(5,4), 4:(5,3), 5:(4,3), 6:(3,3), 7:(2,3), 8:(1,3), 9:(1,4), 10:(1,5), 11:(1,6), 12:(2,6)\n\nAfter move L to (5,6):\n\n- New head: (5,6)\n\n- Then the body: the previous positions from index 0 to 11 become the new body segments, but shifted.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new segment 0: (5,6)  // new head\n\nSegment 1: previous head (6,6)  // now body\n\nSegment 2: previous segment 1 (6,5)\n\nSegment 3: previous segment 2 (6,4)\n\nSegment 4: previous segment 3 (5,4)\n\nSegment 5: previous segment 4 (5,3)\n\nSegment 6: previous segment 5 (4,3)\n\nSegment 7: previous segment 6 (3,3)\n\nSegment 8: previous segment 7 (2,3)\n\nSegment 9: previous segment 8 (1,3)\n\nSegment 10: previous segment 9 (1,4)\n\nSegment 11: previous segment 10 (1,5)\n\nSegment 12: previous segment 11 (1,6)  // now tail\n\nPrevious segment 12 (2,6) is not part of the body anymore; it was the tail and is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nTail is now (1,6).\n\nHead direction: since moved left, current direction is L (left).\n\nNow, food: (3,5) and (5,5) both present.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), which is currently occupied? In the new positions, (5,4) is segment 4, (5,3) is segment 5, etc. (5,5) is not in snake, so it might be free.\n\nBut (5,5) has food, value 1.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) has food.\n\nNow for turn 47, I need to choose move.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (5,5) - is this free? (5,5) has food, but is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,6) head, (6,6), (6,5), etc., not (5,5), so free.\n\n- L: to (4,6) - free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- R: to (6,6) - but (6,6) is now body segment (index 1), so if move right to (6,6), collision with body.\n\nReverse of L is R, but R is to (6,6), which is body, so invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U invalid (wall), D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R invalid (reverse and body).\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nNow, need to think ahead to maximize score.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,5).\n\n(5,5) is directly below, move D.\n\n(3,5) is left and down.\n\nAlso, life spans: (3,5) life span 7 at turn 46, so at turn 47, life span 6, still present.\n\n(5,5) life span 10 at turn 46, turn 47 life span 9.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (5,5) on turn 47 by moving D.\n\nIf move D to (5,5), since it has food, value +1, snake grows, so after eating, new head at (5,5), and the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nWhen eating food, the head moves to food cell, and the snake grows, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo if head moves to food cell, it eats, and the segment is added; tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nIn this case, if move to (5,5) on turn 47:\n\nNew head at (5,5), and since food eaten, the previous tail is not removed, so positions: new head (5,5), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, and all previous body segments, so the tail (1,6) remains.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // and since ate food, add a new segment at previous tail position? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position doesn't change; it stays, and the new head is added.\n\nStandard snake: when moving without eating, head to new, tail removed.\n\nWhen eating, head to new, tail not removed, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, and all previous body segments, and the tail stays.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions at turn 46 after move to (5,6)? No, at turn 47, before move.\n\nAt turn 47, after turn 46 move, positions are: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]  // length 13\n\nIf move D to (5,5) and eat food:\n\nNew head at (5,5), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, and all body segments: (6,6), (6,5), ..., up to (1,6), and since ate, tail (1,6) remains, but a new segment is added? No, the tail is not removed, so the last segment stays.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // same as before but head changed and no tail removed, so length 14.\n\nPositions: index 0: (5,5), index 1: (5,6), index 2: (6,6), index 3: (6,5), index 4: (6,4), index 5: (5,4), index 6: (5,3), index 7: (4,3), index 8: (3,3), index 9: (2,3), index 10: (1,3), index 11: (1,4), index 12: (1,5), index 13: (1,6)  // yes, 14 segments.\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nHead direction after move: since moved down, direction D.\n\nNow, is there any issue? (5,5) was food, eaten.\n\nBut check for Tail Reward Danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, tail is at (1,6), head at (5,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (5,5) and (1,6) are not adjacent; distance is large.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nNow, if I move L to (4,6) instead on turn 47.\n\nMove L to (4,6): no food there, so just move, head to (4,6), tail removed, positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // tail was (1,6) removed, new tail (1,5)\n\nLength 13 still.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 47: from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\nMoving to (5,5) gets immediate food, but I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (3,5), which might be riskier to get.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), currently occupied? Snake has (3,3) at index 8, (4,3) at index 7, etc. (3,5) not occupied.\n\nBut to reach (3,5), from (5,6), if I move L to (4,6), then I can go down to (4,5) or left to (3,6), etc.\n\n(3,5) life span 7 at turn 46, so at turn 47, life 6, turn 48 life 5, etc., so I have time, but not too much.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) has longer life.\n\nBut let's think about the board.\n\nFirst, I need to survive and eat food.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 13 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls on borders.\n\nObstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions at turn 46 after move to (5,6)? At turn 46, after action, positions for turn 47.\n\nPerhaps I should define state at turn 47 after turn 46 action.\n\nTurn 46: I must move L to (5,6), as only choice.\n\nThen turn 47: head at (5,6), direction L, can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), eat food, grow to 14, head at (5,5), direction D.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,6) - but (5,6) is now body segment (index 1 after move), so collision.\n\n- D: to (5,4) - (5,4) is body segment? In positions after eating: head (5,5), body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ... (5,4) is index 5, which is body, so (5,4) occupied, collision if move there.\n\n- L: to (4,5) - is this free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- R: to (6,5) - (6,5) is body segment index 3, occupied.\n\nCurrent direction after move to (5,5) is D (down), so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: invalid, opposite and body\n\nD: to (5,4), but occupied by body, collision\n\nL: to (4,5), free? Let's see: (4,5) not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nR: to (6,5), occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,5).\n\nThen move to (4,5), no food, so head to (4,5), tail removed? After growing, tail is (1,6), but when moving without eating, tail removed.\n\nFrom positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)  // length 14\n\nMove to (4,5): no food, so new head (4,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, and so on, up to (1,5) becomes body, tail (1,6) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // new tail (1,5), length 14? Removed (1,6), added head, so length same, 14? No.\n\nPrevious length 14, move without eating: head to new, tail removed, so length 13? Let's count.\n\nBefore move: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), then segments 1 to 13 from previous: previous index 1 (5,5) to index 13 (1,6), but index 13 is (1,6), which is tail.\n\nNew segment 0: (4,5)\n\nNew segment 1: previous head (5,5)\n\nNew segment 2: previous segment 1 (5,6)\n\nNew segment 3: previous segment 2 (6,6)\n\nNew segment 4: previous segment 3 (6,5)\n\nNew segment 5: previous segment 4 (6,4)\n\nNew segment 6: previous segment 5 (5,4)\n\nNew segment 7: previous segment 6 (5,3)\n\nNew segment 8: previous segment 7 (4,3)\n\nNew segment 9: previous segment 8 (3,3)\n\nNew segment 10: previous segment 9 (2,3)\n\nNew segment 11: previous segment 10 (1,3)\n\nNew segment 12: previous segment 11 (1,4)\n\nNew segment 13: previous segment 12 (1,5)  // tail, since previous segment 13 (1,6) removed.\n\nPrevious segments: 0:(5,5), 1:(5,6), 2:(6,6), 3:(6,5), 4:(6,4), 5:(5,4), 6:(5,3), 7:(4,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(2,3), 10:(1,3), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(1,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat:\n\nNew 0: (4,5)\n\nNew 1: previous 0 (5,5)\n\nNew 2: previous 1 (5,6)\n\nNew 3: previous 2 (6,6)\n\nNew 4: previous 3 (6,5)\n\nNew 5: previous 4 (6,4)\n\nNew 6: previous 5 (5,4)\n\nNew 7: previous 6 (5,3)\n\nNew 8: previous 7 (4,3)\n\nNew 9: previous 8 (3,3)\n\nNew 10: previous 9 (2,3)\n\nNew 11: previous 10 (1,3)\n\nNew 12: previous 11 (1,4)\n\nNew 13: previous 12 (1,5)  // tail, previous 13 (1,6) removed.\n\nSo length 14, tail at (1,5).\n\nHead direction L (since moved left from (5,5) to (4,5)? From (5,5) to (4,5) is left, so direction L.\n\nNow, back to the choice at turn 47.\n\nIf on turn 47 I move D to (5,5), I eat food, then on turn 48 I must move L to (4,5), as above.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to other places.\n\nBut I have food at (3,5), which is at (3,5), adjacent to (4,5) if I go left, but (3,5) is below (3,6), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,6) - free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D: to (4,4) - free? (4,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: to (3,5) - (3,5) has food, so can eat.\n\n- R: to (5,5) - but (5,5) is body segment (index 1), occupied, and also reverse? Current direction L, R is opposite, so cannot move R anyway.\n\nReverse of L is R, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), eat food at (3,5), then grow, head to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,5) has life span, but at turn 48, it should be present.\n\nTurn 46: food (3,5) life 7\n\nTurn 47: life 6\n\nTurn 48: life 5, present.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let's think if this is good.\n\nFirst, at turn 47, if I move L to (4,6) instead of D to (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,6), move L to (4,6): no food, so head to (4,6), tail removed.\n\nPositions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // tail (1,6) removed, new tail (1,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (4,5) - free? (4,5) not occupied, not wall\n\n- L: to (3,6) - free? (3,6) not occupied, not wall\n\n- R: to (5,6) - (5,6) is body segment (index 1), occupied, and reverse of L, so invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf move D to (4,5), no food, then to (4,5), etc.\n\nOr move L to (3,6), no food.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,5) later.\n\nBut (3,5) has shorter life span, so I should eat it soon.\n\nAlso, (5,5) is easier to get.\n\nBut let's consider the risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant yet.\n\nAlso, the snake body might block paths.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both foods if possible.\n\nBut (3,5) disappears after turn 52, so I have until turn 52 to eat it.\n\n(5,5) until turn 55.\n\nNow, from turn 47, if I move D to (5,5), I get one food immediately, then on turn 48 to (4,5), then I can move to (3,5) on turn 49? From (4,5) to (3,5) is L, which is possible.\n\nAt (4,5), after moving from (5,5) to (4,5), direction L, as above.\n\nThen move L to (3,5) on turn 48? But turn 48 is when I move from (4,5).\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,6) — must do.\n\nTurn 47: from (5,6), move D to (5,5) — eat food, grow.\n\nThen turn 47 positions after move: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), etc. as before.\n\nTurn 48: from (5,5), only possible move L to (4,5) — no eat, so move to (4,5), tail removed.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) // tail (1,5), length 14? After eating at turn 47, length 14, then turn 48 move no eat, length 14? No.\n\nAt turn 47 after eating: length 14.\n\nTurn 48 move to (4,5) no eat: head to (4,5), tail removed, so new length 13? Count segments.\n\nPrevious: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head (4,5), new body: previous head (5,5), previous segment 1 (5,6), ..., up to previous segment 12 (1,5), and previous segment 13 (1,6) removed.\n\nPrevious segments: 0:(5,5),1:(5,6),2:(6,6),3:(6,5),4:(6,4),5:(5,4),6:(5,3),7:(4,3),8:(3,3),9:(2,3),10:(1,3),11:(1,4),12:(1,5),13:(1,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat:\n\nNew 0: (4,5)\n\nNew 1: prev 0 (5,5)\n\nNew 2: prev 1 (5,6)\n\nNew 3: prev 2 (6,6)\n\nNew 4: prev 3 (6,5)\n\nNew 5: prev 4 (6,4)\n\nNew 6: prev 5 (5,4)\n\nNew 7: prev 6 (5,3)\n\nNew 8: prev 7 (4,3)\n\nNew 9: prev 8 (3,3)\n\nNew 10: prev 9 (2,3)\n\nNew 11: prev 10 (1,3)\n\nNew 12: prev 11 (1,4)\n\nNew 13: prev 12 (1,5)  // tail, prev 13 removed.\n\nSo length 14, tail at (1,5).\n\nYes, length increased to 14 at turn 47, then stayed 14.\n\nNow at turn 48, head at (4,5), direction L (from moving left).\n\nCan move to (3,5) by moving L, which has food.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), life span at turn 48: original life 7 at turn 46, turn 47 life 6, turn 48 life 5, present.\n\nMove L to (3,5): eat food, grow.\n\nNew head at (3,5), then body: previous head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,6), etc., and tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // and add new segment?

Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D: to (3,4) - free? (3,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L: to (2,5) - (2,5) not occupied? Snake has (2,3) at index 11, (3,3) at index 10, etc. (2,5) not in list, so free.\n\n- R: to (4,5) - but (4,5) is body segment (index 1), occupied, and also reverse? Current direction L, R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nBut L to (2,5) is possible.\n\nI need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (1,5), which might move.\n\nBut this seems fine for now.\n\nIf at turn 47, I had moved L to (4,6) instead.\n\nFrom (5,6), move L to (4,6) no eat, so positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // tail (1,6) removed, length 13.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,6), can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf move D to (4,5), no food, then head to (4,5), tail removed (1,5) removed, new positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)  // new tail (1,4), length 13.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or other.\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), from (4,5) move L to (3,5) on turn 49? Turn 48 I am at (4,5), turn 49 move to (3,5) if I want.\n\nBut (3,5) life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 48, life of (3,5) is 4 (from turn 46:7, turn47:6, turn48:5? Turn46: life7, turn47:6, turn48:5, turn49:4, etc., present until turn52.\n\nTurn52: life1, present; turn53:0, gone.\n\nSo at turn48, life5, still time.\n\nBut if I go this way, I might eat (3,5) later, but (5,5) is still there.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat (5,5) yet.\n\nFrom (4,5), I could move down to (4,4) or left to (3,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), which might be blocked now.\n\nFor example, at turn48 positions after moving to (4,5): head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\n(5,5) is free, but to reach it from (4,5), I need to move R to (5,5), but current direction? After moving to (4,5) from (4,6), I moved down, so direction D.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,5) is down, so direction D.\n\nThen at (4,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,6) - but (4,6) is body segment (index 1), occupied, and reverse of D, not allowed.\n\n- D: to (4,4) - free\n\n- L: to (3,5) - free, has food\n\n- R: to (5,5) - free, has food\n\nBut U invalid, D to (4,4) no food, L to (3,5) food, R to (5,5) food.\n\nCurrent direction D, so can move D, L, or R? Directions: U opposite, not allowed; D, L, R are possible except reverse.\n\nD is same direction, L and R are perpendicular.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), eat food, grow.\n\nOr move L to (3,5), eat food.\n\nBut (3,5) has shorter life, so I might prioritize it.\n\nBut in this case, I can eat either.\n\nHowever, in the first path, I ate both quickly.\n\nNow, back to turn 47 choice.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5) on turn 47, I get one food, and then on turn 48 I move to (4,5), and turn 49 I can move to (3,5) if I want, but from (4,5) after moving from (5,5) to (4,5), at turn 48 head at (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) on turn 48, eating the second food.\n\nIn the first scenario, at turn 48, from (4,5) I can move directly to (3,5).\n\nWhereas if I delay, I might miss (3,5) if not careful.\n\nAlso, by eating (5,5) first, I clear the area a bit.\n\nBut let's check if moving to (3,5) from (4,5) is safe.\n\nAt (4,5), after previous moves, positions include (3,3), (4,3), etc., but (3,5) should be free.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), surrounded by body? For example, (3,6) might be free, (2,5) free, (3,4) free.\n\n(3,6) not occupied, (2,5) not, (3,4) not.\n\n(4,5) is body, but not adjacent except possibly.\n\nFrom (3,5), moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), all possible.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (5,2) might affect, but not immediately.\n\nNow, what if at turn 47 I move L to (4,6) instead.\n\nThen at turn 48, from (4,6), I can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (3,6), then I can go down to (3,5) later.\n\nBut (3,5) might be eaten on turn 49 or so.\n\nBut (5,5) is still there, and I need to go back.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) on turn 49, but then to get to (5,5), I have to go through (4,5), which might be occupied.\n\nBut after moving, positions change.\n\nTo save time, eating both foods quickly seems efficient and safe in the first approach.\n\nMoreover, in the first approach, by turn 48, I have eaten both foods, score +2.\n\nIn the second, I might eat (3,5) around turn 49 and (5,5) later, but (5,5) has longer life.\n\nBut no rush for (5,5).\n\nBut to minimize risk, eating available food is good.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger. But in this case, tail is far, at (1,5) or so, not near head.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 47, moving D to (5,5) is better to get the food immediately.\n\nThen turn 48 move L to (4,5), then turn 48 from (4,5) move L to (3,5) to eat the second food.\n\nAt turn 48, from (4,5), if I move L to (3,5), I eat on turn 48.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,6)  // action for turn 46\n\nTurn 47: move D to (5,5)  // eat first food\n\nThen at turn 48, from (5,5), I move L to (4,5)  // no eat, as above\n\nThen at turn 48 position (4,5), I need to move on turn 48.\n\nTurn 48 action: from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut turn 48 action is for the move from current position.\n\nPerhaps I need to list actions per turn.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 46, then 47, etc., but since turn 46 is given, I start from turn 46 action.\n\nThe output should be for turns starting from t1=46.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 46: action\n\nTurn 47: action\n\n...\n\nIn this case, for turn 46, only choice L.\n\nThen turn 47, I choose D to eat (5,5).\n\nThen turn 48, from (4,5) after moving, I move L to (3,5) to eat (3,5).\n\nAfter that, I need to survive, but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider beyond.\n\nAfter eating both, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5).\n\nAll seem ok.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,6), then from there, I can go right or left, but left might be blocked by walls or body.\n\n(3,6) is near left wall.\n\nx=0 is wall.\n\nFrom (3,6), U to (3,7) wall, invalid; D to (3,5) body; L to (2,6); R to (4,6).\n\nDepending on direction.\n\nBut I can plan to go down to open area.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake long, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nBut for now, eating the foods is priority.\n\nAnother path: at turn 47, if I move L to (4,6), then I can go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nIf I go to (4,5), then to (3,5), I eat (3,5), but (5,5) is still there.\n\nThen from (3,5), I need to go to (5,5), which might require moving right to (4,5), but (4,5) might be body.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5) at turn 49 or so, positions might have (5,5) surrounded.\n\nBut (5,5) has life 10, so I can go later.\n\nBut it might be riskier.\n\nTherefore, the first approach seems better: eat (5,5) immediately on turn 47, then (3,5) on turn 48.\n\nNow for turn 48, from (4,5), moving to (3,5) is eating, so good.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to output actions, but the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output the actions, but I don't need to output all, just for the immediate turns, I think.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions if possible.\n\nBut the state might change, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nSince after turn 48, I have eaten both, I can just move safely.\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 46: only choice L\n\nTurn 47: move D to (5,5)  // eat food\n\nNow, after turn 47 move, head at (5,5), direction D, and only possible move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 48: move L to (4,5)  // no eat, but after move, head at (4,5)\n\nAt turn 48, from (5,5) I move to (4,5), so action L.\n\nThen after move, head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nNow at this point, food at (3,5) is present, and I can move to it.\n\nTurn 49 action: from (4,5), move L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut turn 49? Turn 48 I moved to (4,5), then turn 49 I move to (3,5).\n\nIn terms of turn actions:\n\n- Turn 46: move L (to (5,6))\n\n- Turn 47: move D (to (5,5), eat)\n\n- Turn 48: move L (to (4,5), no eat)\n\n- Turn 49: move L (to (3,5), eat)\n\nBut at turn 48, after moving to (4,5), I can move immediately on turn 48 to (3,5)? No, each turn is separate.\n\nTurn 48 action: from position at start of turn 48.\n\nAt start of turn 48, after turn 47 move, head is at (5,5), direction D.\n\nI move L to (4,5).\n\nThat is the action for turn 48.\n\nThen at start of turn 49, head is at (4,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen I can choose to move L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, turn 50, etc.\n\nBut in this, on turn 49 I eat the second food.\n\nIf I want to eat on turn 48, but from (5,5) I cannot directly to (3,5), only to adjacent.\n\nSo turn 48 I must go to (4,5) first.\n\nNow, to output at least 5 turns: turn 46 to 50 or 51.\n\nBut after turn 49, I need to move from (3,5).\n\nSo let's list actions:\n\nTurn 46: L  // must\n\nTurn 47: D  // to eat (5,5)\n\nTurn 48: L  // to (4,5)\n\nTurn 49: L  // to (3,5) eat (3,5)\n\nNow turn 50: from (3,5), after eating, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but R is opposite direction? Current direction L, R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nAll are possible.\n\nFor example, move D to (3,4), which might be safer to go down.\n\nOr U to (3,6), near top.\n\nSince y=6 is high, and walls, moving down might open space.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nSimilarly, turn 51, etc.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify actions.\n\nThe problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", so after eating, I should move to open areas.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), move D to (3,4), then to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, etc.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5) on turn 49, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  // length 15\n\n(3,3) is body segment, so from (3,5), move D to (3,4) is free, then from (3,4) can move D to (3,3) but occupied, or L to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut I can move L to (2,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nTo avoid body, moving U or D might be better.\n\n(3,6) is free, move U.\n\nThen from (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), etc.\n\nSince I need to output, I can choose a safe move.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can define up to turn 50 or 51.\n\nSince the food are eaten, and no immediate danger, I can stop after a few moves.\n\nBut the answer should include actions for turn 46 and subsequent.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 46,47,48,49,50.\n\nTurn 50 action needed.\n\nAfter turn 49, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nSuppose I move U to (3,6) on turn 50.\n\nThen action U.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut it might not be necessary to specify all, but I think for the output, I should provide a sequence.\n\nSince the grid is small, I need to be careful of cycles or dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant for now.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so paths open.\n\nFor example, tail is at (1,5), moving as snake moves.\n\nIn the positions, when I move, tail changes.\n\nBut in the sequence above, after turn 49, tail at (1,5), but as I move, it will shift.\n\nBut for now, from (3,5), moving U to (3,6) seems fine.\n\nThen turn 51, from (3,6), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output up to turn 50.\n\nNow, back to turn 47 choice.\n\nI think moving D to (5,5) is better.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? For example, if I move to (5,5), and then I must move left, but (4,5) is free, so ok.\n\nIf I move L to (4,6) on turn 47, then I can move D to (4,5) on turn 48, then to (3,5) on turn 49, but I miss (5,5) for now, and later I might need to go back.\n\nBut (5,5) is still there, so I can eat it later, but with the snake long, it might be harder.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5), head at (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), but (4,5) might be body or not.\n\nIn that case, when I move to (4,5), it might be occupied if not careful.\n\nBut in the sequence where I didn't eat (5,5), at turn 48, positions might have (5,5) free, and I can move to it.\n\nBut it adds extra moves.\n\nSo eating (5,5) first is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: L  // to (4,5)\n\nTurn 49: L  // to (3,5) eat\n\nFor turn 50, from (3,5), after eating, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nI need to choose a move.\n\nPossible: U, D, L.\n\nSay, move U to (3,6) for safety, away from body.\n\nThen turn 51, etc.\n\nBut for output, I can include turn 50.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and turn 46 to 50 is 5 turns, that should be fine.\n\nTurn 46,47,48,49,50: that's 5 actions.\n\nNow, for turn 50, I need to specify.\n\nTo be consistent, move U.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving to (3,5) is possible without Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail is at (1,5), head at (3,5), not adjacent, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, after move.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 46):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,2)).\n- **Snake**: Head at (6,6), direction U (up). Positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)] (length 13). Tail at (2,6).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,5): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 52).\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 55).\n- **Immediate Constraints from (6,6)**:\n  - U (to (6,7)): Wall (y=7), invalid.\n  - D (to (6,5)): Body collision (occupied by segment at (6,5)), invalid.\n  - L (to (5,6)): Free (no wall or body).\n  - R (to (7,6)): Wall (x=7), invalid.\n- **Only possible move at turn 46 is L to (5,6)**.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize eating both foods quickly** to maximize score while ensuring survival:\n  - (5,5) is closer and has a longer life span (10 turns), but (3,5) has a shorter life span (7 turns) and must be eaten by turn 52.\n  - Path to (5,5) is direct: After moving L to (5,6) at turn 46, move D to (5,5) at turn 47 to eat it (+1 score, length 14).\n  - Then, from (5,5), move L to (4,5) at turn 48 (no food, but necessary to reach (3,5)).\n  - From (4,5), move L to (3,5) at turn 49 to eat it (+1 score, length 15).\n- **Post-Food Survival**: After eating both foods, focus on open areas to avoid collisions:\n  - From (3,5) at turn 49, move U to (3,6) at turn 50 to head toward less crowded space near the top, avoiding the body cluster near (3,3)-(1,5).\n- **Risks Mitigated**:\n  - Tail Reward Danger: Tail is at (1,5) when eating (3,5) at (3,5)—not adjacent (distance >1), so safe.\n  - Body/Wall Collisions: All moves avoid walls and body segments based on projected positions.\n  - Life Spans: Both foods eaten well before expiration ((3,5) by turn 49, (5,5) by turn 47).\n- **Turn-by-Turn Actions for 5 Turns (turns 46–50)**:\n  - Turn 46: Move L to (5,6) (only choice).\n  - Turn 47: Move D to (5,5) to eat positive food.\n  - Turn 48: Move L to (4,5) (positions shift; head now at (4,5)).\n  - Turn 49: Move L to (3,5) to eat positive food.\n  - Turn 50: Move U to (3,6) for safety, moving away from body segments.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 49, increasing length to 15 and score by +2, while positioning the snake for survival. Beyond turn 50, continue moving toward open cells (e.g., (2,6) or (4,6)) as the tail moves, creating space.\n\n**Projected Positions (for reference):**\n- After turn 46 (L): Positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] (direction L).\n- After turn 47 (D, eat): Positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] (length 14, direction D).\n- After turn 48 (L, no eat): Positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] (length 14, direction L).\n- After turn 49 (L, eat): Positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] (length 15, direction L).\n- After turn 50 (U, no eat): Positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] (length 15, direction U).\n\n**Final Action Sequence:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 47: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 48: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 49: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 50: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 47, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (5,6), and the body segments follow: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the tail is at (1,6). The snake is 13 segments long.\n\nHead direction is L, which means it's moving left. Last move was left, so from (6,6) to (5,6).\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- At (3,5) with value 1 and life span 6. Since life span decreases every turn including current, on turn 47, it has 6 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 52? Life span is given as 6, meaning it has 6 turns including this one, so it will be gone after turn 52? Let's clarify: \"life_span: disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning on turn t + N - 1 it might still be there, but gone on turn t + N? I need to be careful.\n\nIt says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, with life_span N, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + N, meaning it's not there on turn t + N.\n\nFor example, at turn 47, food at (3,5) has life_span 6, so it will be present on turns 47,48,49,50,51,52, and disappear on turn 53. Similarly, food at (5,5) with life_span 9 will be present until turn 55 (47+8=55? 47 to 55 is 9 turns? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 47: life_span 6, so available for 6 turns: 47,48,49,50,51,52. Gone on 53.\n\n- Turn 47: life_span 9 for (5,5), so available for 9 turns: 47 to 55 inclusive? 47 to 55 is 9 turns: 47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55. Gone on 56.\n\nBut since we're at turn 47, for planning, we need to consider when food disappears.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,6)\n\nBody: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\nTail is (1,6)\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (3,5): value +1, life_span 6 (until turn 52)\n\n- (5,5): value +1, life_span 9 (until turn 55)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so from (5,6), moving left would go to (4,6), but is that possible? Let's see possible moves.\n\nSince head is at (5,6) and moving left, last direction was left, so I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since last move was left, I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, L.\n\n- U: up to (5,7), but y=7 is a wall, so (5,7) is out of bounds? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is a wall, cannot go there.\n\nBorder cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (5,7) is a wall, invalid.\n\nD: down to (5,5), but (5,5) has food? Food at (5,5) is present, so moving to (5,5) would eat the food.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves from (5,6):\n\n- U: (5,7) — y=7 is wall, invalid\n\n- D: (5,5) — is this valid? (5,5) is not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: head at (5,6), body at (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc. (5,5) is not in the list, so it's empty, but has food? Food is at (5,5), but moving to a food cell eats it.\n\n(5,5) is not occupied by snake body; it's a food cell. So moving to (5,5) is possible and would eat the food.\n\n- L: left to (4,6) — is (4,6) empty? Snake positions: ... (1,6) is tail, but (4,6) not listed, so should be empty. Walls? No wall at (4,6), borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacle at (5,2), so (4,6) is free.\n\n- R: right to (6,6) — but (6,6) is occupied by the snake body, the first segment after head. Since the snake is moving, when head moves, the tail will move away, but at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nCollision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, (6,6) is the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (1,6). So (6,6) is a body segment, so if head moves to (6,6), it would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, R to (6,6) is invalid because it's occupied by body.\n\nAlso, last direction was L, so moving R is opposite, which is not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,6):\n\n- U: invalid, wall\n\n- D: to (5,5) — valid, and has food\n\n- L: to (4,6) — valid, no food\n\n- R: invalid, both because of body collision and instant reverse not allowed\n\nR is invalid anyway.\n\nSo only D and L are possible.\n\nNow, D to (5,5) would eat the positive food there. Value +1, snake length increases by one.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's food at (3,5) with shorter life span.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving D to (5,5).\n\nIf I move to (5,5), I eat the food, so new head position (5,5), and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, snake grows to 14 segments.\n\nAfter moving, the body will be: head at (5,5), then the previous head (5,6) becomes the new first body segment, and so on, up to tail at (1,6), but since I ate food, tail stays, so new positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] — so tail is still at (1,6), but now there are 14 positions.\n\nOriginal snake: 13 segments, after eating, 14 segments.\n\nNow, head at (5,5), direction was D (since I moved down).\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (opposite of D).\n\nAlso, check surroundings.\n\n(5,5) has coordinates: x=5, y=5.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,6) — but (5,6) is now occupied by the first body segment? After move, positions: head at (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), etc. So (5,6) is the neck, so moving U to (5,6) would collide with body, invalid.\n\n- D: to (5,4) — (5,4) is occupied? In the new positions, (5,4) is the fourth body segment? Let's list: indices: head (5,5), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (5,4), etc. So (5,4) is seg5, occupied, so moving to (5,4) collides, invalid.\n\n- L: to (4,5) — is (4,5) free? Not in snake positions, no wall, so possible.\n\n- R: to (6,5) — (6,5) is seg3, occupied, invalid.\n\nAlso, after moving D, direction is D, so instant reverse to U is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (5,5), only possible move is L to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to other places.\n\nBut this seems restrictive; after eating at (5,5), I can only go left to (4,5).\n\nNow, from (4,5), where can I go?\n\n(4,5) is free now? After moving to (4,5), head at (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), etc.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: to (4,6) — (4,6) not occupied, no wall.\n\n- D: to (4,4) — not occupied.\n\n- L: to (3,5) — (3,5) has food? Yes, food at (3,5).\n\n- R: to (5,5) — but (5,5) is neck, occupied, invalid.\n\nAnd direction: I moved L to (4,5), so direction L.\n\nNo instant reverse, so cannot move R.\n\nSo from (4,5), can move U, D, or L to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; we're at turn 47, deciding action for turn 47.\n\nBack to turn 47: if I move D to (5,5), I eat the food immediately, but then I'm forced to move left to (4,5) on next turn, and from there I can go to (3,5) to eat the other food, but (3,5) might not be available long, life span 6, so by turn 48 or 49 it might be gone? Turn 47, food at (3,5) life span 6, so available until turn 52, so on turn 48 it will have life span 5, still there.\n\nTurn 48, if I'm at (4,5), I can move to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nBut after eating at (5,5), I grow, so the snake is longer, which might cause issues later.\n\nNow, alternative: on turn 47, move L to (4,6).\n\nThen head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nFrom there, possible moves.\n\nFirst, after moving L to (4,6), snake positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — tail at (1,6), length 13, no growth.\n\nNow, from (4,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,7) — y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,5) — not occupied, no food\n\n- L: (3,6) — not occupied\n\n- R: (5,6) — but (5,6) is now the neck, occupied, invalid. Also, instant reverse not allowed since last move was L, so R is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf I go D to (4,5), that might lead to (3,5) for food.\n\nOr L to (3,6), which is away from food.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, consider the food life spans.\n\nFood at (3,5): life span 6, must be eaten by turn 52 or before.\n\nFood at (5,5): life span 9, can be eaten later.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer to current position.\n\nThere might be a risk with the tail or something.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,6), and head at (5,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so distance 1 in grid, same x or y diff by 1.\n\n(5,6) and (1,6) are not adjacent; they are 4 apart in x.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's plan paths.\n\nFirst option: move D to (5,5) on turn 47.\n\nEat food, grow to 14.\n\nThen on turn 48, must move L to (4,5) as only option.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) to eat the other food? Move L to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) has food, so eat it, grow to 15.\n\nBut let's see positions after turn 48: head at (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) on turn 49, head at (3,5), eat food, grow, so tail stays.\n\nThen positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), ..., up to tail (1,6).\n\nBut now, after eating both foods, the snake is longer, and I need to find a way to survive without colliding.\n\nFor example, after head at (3,5), where to go?\n\nPossible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U: (3,6) — not occupied\n\n- D: (3,4) — not occupied? Snake has segments at (4,3), (3,3), etc., but (3,4) not listed, should be free.\n\n- L: (2,5) — not occupied\n\n- R: (4,5) — occupied by neck, invalid\n\nDirection: I moved L to (3,5), so direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nBut the area might be cramped.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nGrid: walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies many cells, especially on the left and bottom.\n\nList free cells mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: from (1,3) to (1,6), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — current.\n\nAfter moving D to (5,5) on 47, positions include (5,5) head, (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think of the free space.\n\nFor example, the top row y=6: cells (0,6) wall, (1,6) snake tail, (2,6)? free, (3,6) free, (4,6) free? On turn 47, before move, (4,6) is free.\n\nAfter turn 47 move D, (4,6) might be free or not.\n\nI should simulate.\n\nTurn 47 start: snake: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nFood: (3,5), (5,5)\n\nOption 1: Move D to (5,5) on turn 47.\n\nEat food, so snake grows: new head (5,5), and tail stays, so positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] — 14 segments.\n\nTurn 48: from (5,5), only possible move L to (4,5) — as we thought, since U, D, R all invalid.\n\nMove to (4,5), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves away from (1,6) to? When no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nOn turn 48, moving from (5,5) to (4,5), no food at (4,5), so no growth, tail moves.\n\nSo head to (4,5), then body: the previous head (5,5) becomes new seg1, then (5,6), (6,6), etc., and tail (1,6) is removed, so new tail is (1,5)? Original tail was (1,6), after move, the last segment (1,6) is removed, and new last is (1,5) or something.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nSo positions after move: head new position, then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nTurn 48: move from (5,5) to (4,5), no food, so new head (4,5), then the body: previous head (5,5) is now seg1, then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — and (1,6) is removed since tail moved.\n\nOriginal positions before move: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5), the body follows: the first body segment is the previous head (5,5), then (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — and the last segment (1,6) is removed, so tail is at (1,5).\n\nSo positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] — 14 segments? No, before growth it was 14, but no food eaten, so should be 13 segments? I think I confused.\n\nAt turn 47 after eating, snake is 14 segments.\n\nOn turn 48, moving to (4,5) no food, so after move, head at (4,5), then 13 body segments, but the body includes the previous 13 positions except the tail is removed.\n\nPrevious positions: 14 cells, head moves to new cell, so new head at (4,5), then the first 13 of the previous body, but since the snake was length 14, the body had 13 segments, so after moving head to new cell, the new body is the old head position to the second last, and tail removed.\n\nStandard snake: positions list, head to tail.\n\nBefore move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., P13] where P0 is head (5,5), P1 (5,6), P2 (6,6), ..., P13 (1,6).\n\nAfter move to new head N, no food eaten, new positions: [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P12] — so the last element P13 is removed, and N is new head.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] — P12 is (1,5), which was second last, and P13 (1,6) removed.\n\nSo now 14 segments? [N, P0 to P12] is 1 + 13 = 14, but P0 to P12 is 13 positions, plus N, 14. But since no food, it should be same length.\n\nBefore move, 14 positions. After move, new head and the first 13 positions of the previous list, but the previous list had 14, so [P0 to P13], after move, [N, P0, P1, ..., P12], which is 14 positions, but P13 is missing, so the cell P13 is freed.\n\nIn terms of length, it remains 14 only if food eaten, but here no food, so length should decrease? No.\n\nLength increases only when food eaten. Otherwise, when moving without eating, length stays the same, but the tail moves, so one cell is freed.\n\nIn terms of positions list, when no food eaten, the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_body_{n-2}, old_body_{n-1} but the last one is removed? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically: suppose snake has positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where H is head, B1 to Bk are body, tail is Bk.\n\nLength L = k+1.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell N:\n\n- If no food, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] — so tail Bk is removed, length same, L.\n\n- If food eaten, new positions: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] — tail not removed, length L+1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 47 after eating, length 14, positions [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), ..., (1,6) ] 14 elements.\n\nTurn 48: move to (4,5), no food, so new positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — and (1,6) is removed. So tail is now at (1,5), length 14? [N, H, B1 to B12] but H to B12 is 13 positions? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions: P0 = (5,5), P1 = (5,6), P2 = (6,6), P3 = (6,5), P4 = (6,4), P5 = (5,4), P6 = (5,3), P7 = (4,3), P8 = (3,3), P9 = (2,3), P10 = (1,3), P11 = (1,4), P12 = (1,5), P13 = (1,6)\n\nAfter move to N = (4,5), no food, new positions: [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P12] = [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — so P13 (1,6) is removed, and new tail is (1,5), but (1,5) was P12, now the last element. Length is 14 positions, but it should be 13 since no food eaten? I think I have a mistake.\n\nInitial at turn 47 before move: 13 positions.\n\nAfter move to (5,5) with food, new positions: [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) ] — 14 positions, length 14.\n\nTurn 48: move to (4,5) no food, so new head (4,5), then the previous head (5,5) becomes body, and the tail (1,6) is removed, so new positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — and (1,6) removed, so now 14 positions? [ new head, old head, old body1 to old body12] but old body12 is (1,5), and old tail (1,6) removed, so new list has 14 elements but the last is (1,5), which was previously second last, so the snake is still length 14, but we removed one cell, so it should be length 13.\n\nI see the confusion. When we add a new head and keep all old positions, that increases length only if we don't remove tail. But when we remove tail, length stays the same.\n\nIn this case: before move, 14 positions.\n\nAfter move to new cell, no food, we add new head and remove tail, so new positions: new head + all old positions except the tail is omitted. So number of positions remains the same, but shifted.\n\nNew positions: [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P12] where P0 to P12 are the first 13 positions of the previous list, and P13 is removed. P0 to P12 is 13 positions, plus N, 14, but the previous list had P0 to P13, 14 positions, so by removing P13 and adding N, the number is the same, 14.\n\nBut since no food, length should not change, so it's correct, length 14, tail is now P12, which was (1,5).\n\nPreviously tail was (1,6), now tail is (1,5), so it moved.\n\nIn terms of the grid, cell (1,6) is freed, (1,5) is still occupied.\n\nBack to turn 48: positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L (since moved left from (5,5)).\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) — not occupied, free\n\n- D: (4,4) — not occupied, free\n\n- L: (3,5) — has food, can eat\n\n- R: (5,5) — occupied by neck, invalid\n\nAlso, instant reverse not allowed, last move L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), eat food, grow to 15.\n\nThen positions: new head (3,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, and tail not removed, so new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] — length 15.\n\nThen from there, I need to move to safe cells.\n\nBut the snake is now large, and the space is limited.\n\nFree cells: for example, (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nAlternative path: on turn 47, move L to (4,6) instead.\n\nThen no food eaten, snake moves, tail moves.\n\nTurn 47: move L to (4,6), no food at (4,6), so new positions: head (4,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, and tail (1,6) removed, so new tail is (1,5)? Previous positions: [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) ] 13 positions.\n\nAfter move to (4,6), no food, new positions: [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] — tail at (1,5), length 13.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,5) still there.\n\nNow head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (4,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,5) — free, no food\n\n- L: (3,6) — free, no food\n\n- R: (5,6) occupied, invalid\n\nSo can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf I move D to (4,5) on turn 48? Turn 47 I moved to (4,6), so turn 48 from (4,6).\n\nTurn 47 action is L to (4,6), so on turn 48, I am at (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,6), move D to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has no food, so move there, new positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), etc., tail removed, so tail now (1,4)? Previous positions: [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,5), no food, new positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) ] — tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (4,5), direction D.\n\nNow, from (4,5), can move to (3,5) to eat food, or other directions.\n\nMove L to (3,5) on turn 49? Turn 48 I moved to (4,5), so turn 49 from (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5), eat food, grow to 14.\n\nPositions: new head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), etc., tail not removed, so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — length 14.\n\nThen I still have food at (5,5) which is closer, but the snake is blocking it.\n\n(5,5) is not occupied, but to reach it, from (3,5), I could go up or down, but (3,6) is free, (3,4) free, etc.\n\nBut to get to (5,5), I need to go through (4,5) but (4,5) is now body, occupied.\n\nSo I cannot go directly; I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), move U to (3,6), then R to (4,6), but (4,6) is body, occupied.\n\nPositions have (4,6) as body.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), etc.\n\nSo (4,6) occupied, (3,6) free, (2,5) free, etc.\n\nMove to (3,6) or (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is there, but it's surrounded or something.\n\n(5,5) has food, but to reach it, I need to approach from above or below, but (5,6) is occupied, (5,4) occupied, (6,5) occupied, so (5,5) is adjacent to occupied cells, so I cannot move to it directly because all adjacent cells might be occupied or not.\n\nAdjacent to (5,5): (5,6) occupied, (5,4) occupied, (6,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied. All four directions are occupied by snake body, so (5,5) is inaccessible; it's trapped.\n\n(5,5) has food, but it's surrounded by snake body, so I cannot reach it to eat it. The only way is if the snake moves away, but currently, from the positions, (5,6), (5,4), (6,5), (4,5) are all occupied, so (5,5) is completely enclosed, no way to enter.\n\nBut in the grid, (4,5) is occupied, (5,6) occupied, (6,5) occupied, (5,4) occupied, yes, so (5,5) is not accessible; it's like a hole.\n\nBut there is food there, so if I don't eat it soon, it might be wasted, but since it's inaccessible, I can't eat it anyway.\n\nIn this state, after moving to (4,6) and then to (4,5), and then to (3,5), the food at (5,5) is surrounded and cannot be eaten.\n\nBut in the first path, when I ate (5,5) first, then I could eat (3,5), and (5,5) is gone.\n\nIn the first option, when I ate (5,5) on turn 47, it's eaten, so no issue.\n\nThen I ate (3,5) on turn 49, and (5,5) is already eaten.\n\nSo in that case, I got both foods.\n\nIn the second option, if I go to (4,6) first, then to (4,5), then to (3,5), I eat (3,5) but (5,5) is trapped and I can't eat it, so it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo better to eat (5,5) first.\n\nMoreover, (5,5) has longer life span, but since it's closer and I can eat it now, I should.\n\nBut in the first path, after eating both, I have a long snake in a tight space.\n\nFor example, after turn 49: head at (3,5), positions [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] for the first case.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), which is free.\n\nOr D to (3,4), free.\n\nOr L to (2,5), free.\n\nBut not R to (4,5) occupied.\n\nSay I move U to (3,6) on turn 50.\n\nThen head (3,6), no food, so move, tail moves.\n\nPositions: new head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail (1,5) removed, new tail (1,4)? Positions: previous [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nAfter move to (3,6) no food, new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — tail at (1,4)\n\nThen from (3,6), can move L to (2,6), or D to (3,5) but (3,5) is neck, invalid, or U to (3,7) wall, or R to (4,6) which is occupied? (4,6) is not in positions; positions have (4,5), (5,6), etc., (4,6) is free? In this list, (4,6) not occupied, so can move R to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free.\n\nAlso direction: moved U to (3,6), so direction U.\n\nCan move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\nSimilarly, I can navigate.\n\nBut there is a wall at (5,2), but it's not in the way immediately.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving, so cells are freeing up.\n\nBut in the area, there are free cells like (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nAlso, the top row y=6: (0,6) wall, (1,6) was tail but now free? In current state, after some moves, (1,6) might be free.\n\nIn the sequence above, after turn 50, tail at (1,4), so (1,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) free, etc.\n\nSo I can move around.\n\nBut let's consider not eating immediately.\n\nBack to turn 47, if I move L to (4,6), then on turn 48 I can move to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (4,5), as before, then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut (5,5) is trapped.\n\nIf on turn 48 from (4,6), I move L to (3,6) instead.\n\nTurn 48: move to (3,6), no food, positions: from previous [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] after turn 47 move.\n\nTurn 48 move to (3,6), no food, new positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,6), can move U to (3,7) wall invalid, D to (3,5) which has food, or L to (2,6), or R to (4,6) occupied invalid.\n\nSo can move D to (3,5) to eat food, or L to (2,6).\n\nIf I move D to (3,5), eat food, grow to 14.\n\nPositions: new head (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), etc., tail not removed, so positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — length 14.\n\nThen I have food at (5,5) still, but (5,5) is adjacent to (5,6) occupied, (5,4) occupied, (6,5) occupied, and (4,5) which is free? (4,5) not occupied in this list, so (4,5) is free.\n\n(5,5) adjacent cells: (5,6) occupied, (5,4) occupied, (6,5) occupied, (4,5) free.\n\nSo I can reach (5,5) from (4,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (4,5) or (3,4) or (2,5), etc.\n\nMove to (4,5) on turn 49, no food at (4,5), so move to (4,5), positions: new head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,6), etc., tail removed, new tail (1,3)? Previous tail (1,4) removed, so positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] — tail at (1,3)\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction R? Moved from (3,5) to (4,5), so direction R.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to (5,5) to eat food, since (5,5) is adjacent and free.\n\nMove R to (5,5), eat food, grow to 15.\n\nThen positions: new head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), etc., tail not removed, so length 15.\n\nSo in this case, by going to (3,6) first, I can eat both foods without trapping (5,5).\n\nIn the first sequence, when I ate (5,5) immediately, I also ate both, but the snake was longer earlier.\n\nBut in both cases, I get both foods.\n\nNow, which is better for long-term survival?\n\nIn the first case, after eating (5,5) on turn 47, I was forced to go left, and then to (3,5), and the snake is long.\n\nIn the second case, by going left to (4,6), then to (3,6), then to (3,5) or directly, I eat (3,5) and then (5,5).\n\nBut in terms of turns, if I eat (5,5) on turn 47, I get the point earlier, but it doesn't matter for score, just the number of foods eaten.\n\nScore is based on eating food, each +1.\n\nBut for survival, having a shorter snake might be easier to maneuver.\n\nCurrently, with 13 segments, after eating both, 15.\n\nBut if I delay eating, I can keep shorter longer.\n\nBut I need to eat (3,5) within 6 turns, by turn 52.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) by turn 55.\n\nNow, from current position, if I move L to (4,6) on turn 47, then I can go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,6), moving to (4,5) gets me closer to (3,5), moving to (3,6) gets me to the top.\n\nBut (3,5) is at y=5, so (4,5) is closer.\n\nAlso, there might be risks with the tail.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (1,6), and I'm at (5,6), moving left to (4,6), which is closer to tail, but not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving, tail is at (1,5), etc.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the available space.\n\nThe grid has free cells: let's list all free cells to estimate space.\n\nGrid 8x8, total cells: 64.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, but borders are lines, so cells like (0,y) for y=0 to7 are walls, similarly (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to7.\n\nAnd internal (5,2).\n\nSo wall cells: all (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7, and (5,2).\n\nBut (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are corners, included.\n\nNumber of wall cells: top and bottom rows y=0 and y=7, each has 8 cells, but corners shared, so 2*8=16.\n\nLeft and right columns x=0 and x=7, but y=0 and y=7 already counted, so for x=0, y=1 to6: 6 cells, similarly x=7, y=1 to6: 6 cells.\n\nSo walls: y=0: 8 cells, y=7: 8 cells, x=0 y=1-6: 6 cells, x=7 y=1-6: 6 cells, and (5,2).\n\nBut (x,0) for x=0-7 is 8 cells, (x,7) for x=0-7 is 8, (0,y) for y=1-6 is 6, (7,y) for y=1-6 is 6, but (0,0) and (0,7) etc. are in both, so total border walls: the four corners are included in rows and columns.\n\nStandard way: for a grid, number of border wall cells: since it's a rectangle, perimeter: 2*(width + height) but for cells.\n\nWidth 8, height 8, number of border cells: top row 8, bottom row 8, left column minus corners 6, right column minus corners 6, so 8+8+6+6=28 cells, plus internal obstacle (5,2), so 29 wall cells.\n\nTotal cells 64, so free cells: 64-29=35.\n\nSnake occupies 13 cells, so free cells now: 35-13=22, but with two food, which are on free cells, so 22 free cells including food.\n\nFood are on cells that are free, but when eaten, they become snake or something, but for now, there are 22 empty cells including the two food positions.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, free cells decrease.\n\nFor survival, I need to have space to move.\n\nWith 22 free cells, and snake 13, it can move.\n\nAfter eating both, snake 15, free cells 35-15=20, still ok.\n\nBut let's see the region.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the bottom left, with body from (1,3) to (1,6), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6).\n\nFree areas: top right, like (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (3,5) food, (4,5) free? (4,5) is free, (5,5) food, (3,4), (4,4), (2,4), (2,5), etc.\n\nAlso, (7,3) to (7,6) but x=7 wall, so not.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with obstacles.\n\nCells: for example, (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5) food, and (3,2) but (5,2) wall, so (3,2) free? Let's list.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls and snake.\n\nWalls: (5,2) is wall, and borders.\n\nBut borders are only at edges, so internal cells are free except (5,2).\n\nSo free cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to6, y=1 to6 except snake positions and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — that's 13.\n\n(5,6) is head, included.\n\nNow, all possible cells: x=1-6, y=1-6, 6x6=36 cells.\n\nMinus walls: (5,2) is wall, so minus 1, so 35 cells for play area, but walls include borders, but borders are outside x=1-6 y=1-6? x=1 to6, y=1 to6 are all internal, not border walls, since borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\nFor example, (1,1) is not border, it's playable.\n\n(1,1): x=1, y=1, not on border, since border is x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): y=6, not 7, so not border.\n\nOnly cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls.\n\nSo for the grid, cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are all playable, except for internal obstacle (5,2).\n\nSo number of playable cells: 6x6 = 36, minus (5,2) wall, so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 13 cells, so 35-13=22 free cells, including two food, so 20 empty and 2 food.\n\nAfter eating food, if I eat both, snake 15, free cells 35-15=20.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nOn turn 47, if I move D to (5,5), I eat food, score +1, but then I'm forced to (4,5) on turn 48, then I can eat (3,5) on turn 49.\n\nBut after that, at (3,5) with long snake, I need to find a path.\n\nIf I move L to (4,6) on turn 47, I don't eat, then I can go to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nFrom (4,6), moving to (3,6) on turn 48, then to (3,5) on turn 49 to eat, then to (4,5) on turn 50, then to (5,5) on turn 51 to eat.\n\nSo I eat both, but later.\n\nOr from (4,6), move to (4,5) on turn 48, then to (3,5) on turn 49 to eat, but then (5,5) is trapped, cannot eat.\n\nSo only by going to (3,6) first can I eat both if I didn't eat (5,5) first.\n\nBut since (5,5) has longer life, I can eat it later.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 47 move L to (4,6), turn 48 move L to (3,6), turn 49 move D to (3,5) eat (3,5), then turn 50 move R to (4,5), turn 51 move R to (5,5) eat (5,5).\n\nAll within life spans.\n\n(3,5) life span 6 at turn 47, so on turn 49 it has life span 4? Turn 47: life span 6, so present on 47,48,49,50,51,52. Turn 49 is fine.\n\n(5,5) life span 9, present until turn 55, turn 51 is fine.\n\nSo I can eat both with this path.\n\nNow, compare to eating (5,5) first: on turn 47 eat, turn 48 move to (4,5), turn 49 eat (3,5).\n\nSo I get the points earlier, but snake grows earlier.\n\nIn the delayed eating, I eat on turn 49 and 51, so snake shorter for a few turns.\n\nBut for survival, having a shorter snake might give more space.\n\nAlso, in the delayed eating path, when I move to (3,6) on turn 48, I am near the top, and the tail is moving down, so more space.\n\nIn the immediate eating, after eating both by turn 49, I am at (3,5) with long snake.\n\nBut I can still move to (3,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\nAnother risk: the food at (3,5) might be under snake body or something, but currently not.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\" but not applicable now.\n\nI think both paths are possible, but let's see which one has less risk.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (5,5) immediately because it forces me to go left, and I might get stuck.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5) on turn 47, then to (4,5) on turn 48, then to (3,5) on turn 49, after that at (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) on turn 50.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay move L to (2,6) on turn 50.\n\nThen positions: after move to (2,6), no food, tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions at turn 49 after eating (3,5): head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nMove to (2,6) on turn 50, no food, so new head (2,6), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail (1,5) removed, new positions: [(2,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] — tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction L (moved left from (3,6)? From (3,6) to (2,6) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (2,6), can move U to (2,7) wall invalid, D to (2,5), or L to (1,6), or R to (3,6) occupied invalid.\n\n(1,6) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nMove to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\nIf I move to (1,6), but x=1, y=6, not wall, but is it safe? (1,6) might be close to body.\n\nPositions have (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., (1,5) was removed, so (1,6) free.\n\nMove to (1,6), no food, then from there, I can go down, etc.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nFrom (2,6), move D to (2,5), which is free.\n\nThen to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut there is the obstacle at (5,2), but not immediate.\n\nIn the other path, if I go to (4,6) then (3,6), then (3,5), then (4,5), then (5,5), after eating (5,5) on turn 51, head at (5,5), then I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), after eating, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) etc., but tail is moving.\n\nBut at (5,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but (5,6) occupied, (5,4) occupied, (6,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied, so all blocked, I would be stuck and die.\n\nOh! Problem.\n\nIf I eat (5,5) on turn 51, from (4,5) move R to (5,5), eat food, so new head (5,5), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so positions: new head (5,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, and the body before that, so [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] or something.\n\nLet's trace.\n\nBefore turn 51 move: at turn 50, after moving to (4,5) no food, positions: let's not go deep.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 50, from (3,5) after eating (3,5) on turn 49? I think I lost track.\n\nStart over for delayed eating:\n\nTurn 47: move L to (4,6)\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] tail (1,5)\n\nTurn 48: move L to (3,6)\n\nNo food, so new positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,5) -- eat food (3,5), so grow, new positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] length 14\n\nHead at (3,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (4,5) -- no food, so move, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] tail (1,3)\n\nHead at (4,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 51: move R to (5,5) -- eat food (5,5), so grow, new positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] length 15\n\nHead at (5,5), direction R.\n\nNow from (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,6): but (5,6) is body, occupied, invalid\n\n- D to (5,4): (5,4) is body, occupied, invalid\n\n- L to (4,5): (4,5) is body, occupied, invalid\n\n- R to (6,5): (6,5) is body, occupied, invalid\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied by body, so no possible moves, snake dies on next turn.\n\nOh, disaster! So if I follow this path, after eating (5,5) on turn 51, I am surrounded and have no escape.\n\nTherefore, this path is fatal.\n\nIf on turn 50 from (4,5), I move to another direction, but from (4,5), after turn 50, head at (4,5), I can only move to (5,5) to eat, or other? From (4,5), after turn 50 move, positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]\n\nHead at (4,5), can move:\n\n- U to (4,6): occupied by body, invalid\n\n- D to (4,4): free? Not occupied, no wall\n\n- L to (3,5): occupied, invalid\n\n- R to (5,5): has food, can eat\n\n- Also, direction R, so cannot move L instant reverse.\n\nSo can move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIf I move D to (4,4) on turn 51, no food, then positions: new head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), etc., tail (1,3) removed, new positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] tail (2,3)\n\nThen I can go to (5,5) later, but (5,5) is still there, and I can approach from (4,4) to (5,4) but (5,4) occupied, or to (4,5) occupied, so (5,5) is still surrounded except from below, but (5,4) occupied, so I cannot reach (5,5) directly; I need to free up space.\n\nBut (5,5) life span 9, so by turn 55, I have time, but it might be tricky.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (3,4) or (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, etc.\n\nBut it's messy, and I might not be able to eat (5,5).\n\nWhereas if I eat (5,5) first on turn 47, I avoid this trap.\n\nIn the first option, when I eat (5,5) on turn 47, then (3,5) on turn 49, then from (3,5) on turn 50 I move U to (3,6), which is free, and I can continue.\n\nFor example, turn 50: move to (3,6), no food, positions as before.\n\nThen from (3,6), move to (2,6) or (4,6), both free.\n\nSo no immediate death.\n\nTherefore, for long-term survival, it's better to eat (5,5) now on turn 47 to avoid the potential trap later.\n\nMoreover, (3,5) has shorter life, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nSo I think moving D to (5,5) on turn 47 is the best action.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nThe answer format is to output a sequence of actions for the next few turns.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"turn t1: action, turn t1+1: action, ...\", I should provide a few.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in this case, I can plan the immediate actions.\n\nSo for turn 47: move D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 48: move L to (4,5) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 49: from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) to eat the other food.\n\nThen from there, I need to continue.\n\nAfter turn 49, head at (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) on turn 50.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), say L to (2,6) to go left.\n\nThen from (2,6), move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut to specify.\n\nSince the food at (3,5) must be eaten by turn 52, and I eat it on turn 49, it's fine.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, I can output up to turn 51 or so.\n\nBut let's define.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 47: D (down)\n\nTurn 48: L (left) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 49: L (left) to (3,5) eat food\n\nThen turn 50: U (up) to (3,6)\n\nTurn 51: L (left) to (2,6)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut after that, it depends.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide a sequence for 5 turns: turn 47 to 51.\n\nTurn 47,48,49,50,51: that's 5 actions.\n\nt1=47, so turns 47,48,49,50,51.\n\nNow, for turn 51, if I go to (2,6), then from there.\n\nBut I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo maximize survival, I could go to the right from (3,6) to (4,6), but (4,6) might be occupied later, but in the sequence, when I move to (3,6) on turn 50, (4,6) is free.\n\nIn the positions after turn 49: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nMove U to (3,6) on turn 50, no food, so new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nThen from (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), both free.\n\nSay I move R to (4,6) to go towards the right.\n\nThen on turn 51, move to (4,6), no food, etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can specify the first few actions.\n\nSo I think moving D on turn 47 is safe and gets the food.\n\nTherefore, for turn 47, action D.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Priorities**: The food at (5,5) has a longer life span (9 turns, disappearing after turn 55), but it is immediately accessible and can be eaten safely on turn 47. The food at (3,5) has a shorter life span (6 turns, disappearing after turn 52) and must be eaten soon. Eating (5,5) first avoids a potential trap where (5,5) becomes inaccessible later due to snake body blocks.\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake head starts at (5,6) with direction L (left). Possible moves from (5,6) are D (down) or L (left), as U (up) is a wall and R (right) is invalid due to body collision and instant reverse prevention. After eating (5,5), the only safe move is L to (4,5), followed by L to (3,5) to eat the second food.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: After eating both foods, the snake length increases to 15, but there is sufficient free space (20 cells initially) to maneuver. Moving to (3,6) and then (4,6) after eating (3,5) keeps the snake in open areas and avoids dead ends.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: By eating (5,5) immediately, the snake gains a point and positions itself to eat (3,5) efficiently. The subsequent path (to (3,6) and (4,6)) ensures the snake can explore the upper-right area, where more free cells exist, reducing collision risk. Planning 5+ turns confirms this path is viable and prioritizes survival over short-term gains (e.g., delaying food to keep the snake shorter risks missing (3,5) or trapping (5,5)).\n\n**Action Sequence for Turns 47 to 51**:\n- **Turn 47 (t1 = 47)**: Move D (down) to (5,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length +1). This is safe and avoids future inaccessibility of (5,5).\n- **Turn 48 (t1 + 1)**: Move L (left) to (4,5). This is the only valid move after eating (5,5), as U, D, and R are blocked by body or walls.\n- **Turn 49 (t1 + 2)**: Move L (left) to (3,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length +1). This consumes (3,5) before it expires.\n- **Turn 50 (t1 + 3)**: Move U (up) to (3,6) to navigate toward open space, avoiding body collisions. The snake is now in a less congested area.\n- **Turn 51 (t1 + 4)**: Move R (right) to (4,6) to continue into the upper-right free cells, ensuring ongoing mobility.\n\n**Why this sequence?**  \n- **Turns 47–49**: Secures both food items efficiently, with (5,5) eaten immediately to prevent entrapment and (3,5) eaten while accessible.  \n- **Turns 50–51**: Moves the snake to (3,6) and (4,6), which are free and provide access to more open cells (e.g., (2,6), (4,6), (3,7) is wall, but (4,4), (2,5) are options for future turns). This path has no deadly collisions and maintains flexibility for further movement.  \n- **Beyond Turn 51**: From (4,6), possible moves include U (to (4,7) but invalid wall), D (to (4,5) but may be occupied), L (to (3,6) but may be occupied), or R (to (5,6) but likely occupied). Safer options would be to move D to (4,5) if free or explore other free cells like (4,4) or (3,4), with the snake able to loop or extend as tail moves free up space.  \n\nThis plan scores 2 points by turn 49 and ensures survival for at least 5+ turns by leveraging free space and avoiding risks.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 47\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51\\text{: R} }",

        "step": 48,
        "score": 13,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 48, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake positions are given as a list from head to tail: head at (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So the snake is 14 segments long. The head direction is down, which means it was moving down to get to (5,5) from the previous position.\n\nFood information: there's one food at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 5. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 5 turns, so at turn 53 it will be gone. Value is positive, so +1 point and snake length increases if eaten.\n\nNow, I need to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The primary goal is long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way. Walls are at the borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and can't be moved to. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) tail.\n\nHead direction is down. Since the head is at (5,5) and direction is down, it must have come from above, so previous position was (5,6)? But (5,6) is listed as the first body segment, so yes, it moved down to (5,5) from (5,6).\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (5,5) with direction down.\n\nSince direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up, because up would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is down, so opposite is up, so I cannot move up next.\n\nSo possible actions: down, left, right.\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to:\n\n- Down: to (5,4)\n\n- Left: to (4,5)\n\n- Right: to (6,5)\n\nBut I need to check if these cells are safe: no wall, no body collision except possibly tail.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so (5,4): x=5, y=4, not border, not obstacle (obstacle is at (5,2), not here), so ok.\n\n(4,5): similarly, not border, not obstacle.\n\n(6,5): not border, obstacle is at (5,2), not here.\n\nNow, body collision: snake positions are given, but when I move, the tail also moves, so I need to consider the snake after movement.\n\nCurrent snake: head (5,5), body segments: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\nIf I move down to (5,4), that cell is currently occupied by the 5th body segment? Let's list positions with indices:\n\nIndex 0: head (5,5)\n\nIndex 1: (5,6)\n\nIndex 2: (6,6)\n\nIndex 3: (6,5)\n\nIndex 4: (6,4)\n\nIndex 5: (5,4)  // this is the 6th segment? Positions list: [ (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ... ] so (5,4) is index 5.\n\nWhen I move the head to a new position, the tail will move forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, and the head occupies new cell, body shifts.\n\nSo if I move down to (5,4), which is currently occupied by index 5: (5,4). After moving, the head is at (5,4), and the tail (index 13: (1,6)) will be removed, so the new snake will be: head (5,4), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), but (6,4) was index 4, and (5,4) was index 5, but (5,4) is now the head? Let's think carefully.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince we're moving without eating food yet, tail is removed.\n\nSo current positions: let's list with indices for clarity.\n\n- 0: (5,5) head\n\n- 1: (5,6)\n\n- 2: (6,6)\n\n- 3: (6,5)\n\n- 4: (6,4)\n\n- 5: (5,4)\n\n- 6: (5,3)\n\n- 7: (4,3)\n\n- 8: (3,3)\n\n- 9: (2,3)\n\n- 10: (1,3)\n\n- 11: (1,4)\n\n- 12: (1,5)\n\n- 13: (1,6) tail\n\nIf head moves to (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- Then body: position 0 becomes new body segment: (5,5)\n\n- Position 1: (5,6) becomes next\n\n- Position 2: (6,6)\n\n- Position 3: (6,5)\n\n- Position 4: (6,4)\n\n- Position 5: (5,4) but (5,4) is now head, so the old position 5 is not part of body anymore? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4), the new body segments are the previous positions from index 0 to 12, but index 0 (old head) becomes the first body segment at (5,5), index 1 becomes second body at (5,6), ..., up to index 12: (1,5), and index 13 (tail) is removed, so tail is gone.\n\nBut (5,4) was index 5, which is now the new head position. In the new snake, the cell (5,4) is occupied by the head, so it's not a body cell anymore. The body cells are the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSpecifically, after moving to (5,4):\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Body segments: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n(6,4) was index 4, and (5,3) was index 6, so after moving, body segments are indices 0 to 12 except the tail index 13 is gone, but indices shift.\n\nNew snake positions:\n\n- Head: new position (5,4)\n\n- Then the first body segment is the old head position (5,5)\n\n- Second body: old index 1 (5,6)\n\n- Third body: old index 2 (6,6)\n\n- Fourth body: old index 3 (6,5)\n\n- Fifth body: old index 4 (6,4)\n\n- Sixth body: old index 5 (5,4) but old index 5 is (5,4), which is where head is moving to, but it's not body anymore. Old index 5 (5,4) is vacated because head is moving there, but in terms of body, the segment that was at index 5 is now at the new position? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard way: when head moves to a new cell, that cell becomes new head. The previous head position becomes the new position for the first body segment, and so on, down to the second-to-last segment, and the tail position is abandoned.\n\nSo for a move to (5,4):\n\n- The new head is at (5,4)\n\n- The new first body segment is at the old head position (5,5)\n\n- New second body segment at old first body position (5,6)\n\n- New third body segment at old second body position (6,6)\n\n- New fourth body segment at old third body position (6,5)\n\n- New fifth body segment at old fourth body position (6,4)\n\n- New sixth body segment at old fifth body position (5,4)? Old fifth body position is (5,4), but that's where head is moving, so it's not body. Old positions: index 0: (5,5), index 1: (5,6), index 2: (6,6), index 3: (6,5), index 4: (6,4), index 5: (5,4), index 6: (5,3), etc.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4), which is old index 5 position:\n\n- New head: (5,4)  (which was old index 5)\n\n- New body segment 1: old index 0 (5,5)\n\n- New body segment 2: old index 1 (5,6)\n\n- New body segment 3: old index 2 (6,6)\n\n- New body segment 4: old index 3 (6,5)\n\n- New body segment 5: old index 4 (6,4)\n\n- New body segment 6: old index 6 (5,3)  because old index 5 is now head, so we skip or something? Let's list the new positions in order.\n\nThe new body segments are the old positions from index 0 to 12 except that the tail index 13 is removed, and the head is new.\n\nSo the new snake has 13 segments: head at (5,4), then body at (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)  tail at (1,5).\n\nOld index 5 was (5,4), which is now head, so it's not in the body list. Old index 6 (5,3) is now the new body segment after (6,4).\n\nFrom above:\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- New body: \n  - seg1: old head (5,5)\n  - seg2: old seg1 (5,6)\n  - seg3: old seg2 (6,6)\n  - seg4: old seg3 (6,5)\n  - seg5: old seg4 (6,4)\n  - seg6: old seg6 (5,3)  because old seg5 (5,4) is now head, so we go to old seg6 for the next body segment\n  - seg7: old seg7 (4,3)\n  - seg8: old seg8 (3,3)\n  - seg9: old seg9 (2,3)\n  - seg10: old seg10 (1,3)\n  - seg11: old seg11 (1,4)\n  - seg12: old seg12 (1,5)\n  - and tail is (1,5), but old tail (1,6) is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,4), body: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) with (1,5) as tail.\n\nNow, for collision: when moving to (5,4), that cell was occupied by old seg5, which is not the tail, so it's a body collision, and since it's not the tail, it's deadly. Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except if it's the tail and we're moving into it, but in this case, (5,4) is not the tail, it's a body segment, so moving there would cause collision with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, for other moves.\n\nFirst, move down to (5,4): as above, (5,4) is currently occupied by index 5, which is not the tail (tail is (1,6)), so it's a body cell, so moving there would kill the snake.\n\nTherefore, moving down is not possible, deadly.\n\nNow, move left to (4,5).\n\n(4,5): is this occupied by any body or wall?\n\nWalls: not border, not obstacle.\n\nBody: look at current positions: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(4,5) is not in this list, so it's empty, safe.\n\nSimilarly, move right to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by index 3: (6,5), which is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nCurrent positions: index 3 is (6,5), and tail is index 13 (1,6), so (6,5) is body, not tail.\n\nTherefore, moving to (6,5) is deadly.\n\nSo possible moves: only left to (4,5) is safe? Down and right are deadly, up is not allowed because instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is down, so moving up is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible safe move is left to (4,5).\n\nBut is that the only one? What about staying or something? No, must move to adjacent cell.\n\nSo for turn 48, I must move left to (4,5).\n\nBut let's confirm the new state.\n\nAfter moving left to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- New body segments: old head (5,5) becomes first body, then old seg1 (5,6), old seg2 (6,6), old seg3 (6,5), old seg4 (6,4), old seg5 (5,4), old seg6 (5,3), old seg7 (4,3), old seg8 (3,3), old seg9 (2,3), old seg10 (1,3), old seg11 (1,4), old seg12 (1,5), and tail is (1,5), but old tail (1,6) is gone.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) with (1,5) as tail.\n\n(1,5) is the last segment.\n\nNow, food is at (3,5) with value 1, life span 5. Current turn 48, so it will disappear after turn 52? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 48, life span is 5, after turn 48 it becomes 4, then turn 49:3, turn 50:2, turn 51:1, turn 52:0, so it disappears at the start of turn 53 or after turn 52? Typically, food is available during the turn it has life span, so at turn t, if life span N, it can be eaten during turn t, then after turn t, life span decreases to N-1 for turn t+1.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. Let me see the input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (3, 5, 5, 1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value) I think, so (3,5) with life_span=5, value=1.\n\nAnd \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t1=48, life_span=5, so it can be eaten on turn 48, and after turn 48, countdown to 4 for turn 49, and so on, until after turn 52, countdown 0, so it disappears, not available on turn 53.\n\nSo we have from turn 48 to 52 to eat it.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nCurrently, after moving to (4,5), head is at (4,5), and food is at (3,5), which is adjacent left.\n\nBut I have to think about survival and risks.\n\nAlso, the head direction: after moving left, the new head direction will be left.\n\nNow, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) to eat the food, but let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, moving to (3,5): that cell has food, so if I move there, I eat it, so snake grows.\n\nBut need to check for Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (1,5) after the move, but (1,5) is not adjacent to (3,5)? (3,5) and (1,5) are two cells apart, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(3,5) and (1,5) have same y, x differs by 2, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be like (3,5) and (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), etc.\n\nSo tail at (1,5) is far, so no issue.\n\nBut when I eat food at (3,5), the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, on turn 48, I move left to (4,5), as that's the only safe move.\n\nThen turn 49, from (4,5), head direction left.\n\nPossible moves: left, up, down, but not right (instant reverse).\n\nLeft to (3,5), which has food.\n\nUp to (4,6), down to (4,4).\n\nNow, move to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: head moves to (3,5), new body segment added at previous tail position? No, when eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move.\n\nStandard: if no eat, tail moves forward, head moves. If eat, head moves to food, tail stays, new segment added.\n\nSo if I move to (3,5) on turn 49:\n\n- Head moves to (3,5), eats food, so value +1, length increases.\n\n- New snake: head (3,5), then body: previous positions from old head to old tail, all remain, and a new tail segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nPositions: new head at (3,5), then old head (4,5) becomes first body, then old body segments follow, and the old tail remains, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, after turn 48 move to (4,5), snake has 13 segments: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5).\n\nEarlier I said tail (1,5), but let's list:\n\nAfter turn 48 move to (4,5):\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Body: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\n- Tail: (1,5)  // 14 segments? Positions: 1 head + 12 body + 1 tail, but tail is last, so 14 segments.\n\nInitial snake had 14 positions, after moving without eating, it should have 13? Earlier mistake.\n\nInitial: 14 positions: indices 0 to 13.\n\nAfter moving to new cell without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so 13 segments.\n\nIn turn 48, before move, 14 segments.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) without eating, new snake: head (4,5), then the first 13 old positions except tail is gone, so body: old head (5,5), old seg1 (5,6), ..., up to old seg12 (1,5), but old seg12 is (1,5), which was the second last, old tail (1,6) gone.\n\nOld positions: 0: (5,5), 1: (5,6), 2: (6,6), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (1,3), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (1,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- New body segments: old 0 to 12, but shifted: new body seg1 at old 0 (5,5), new body seg2 at old 1 (5,6), new body seg3 at old 2 (6,6), new body seg4 at old 3 (6,5), new body seg5 at old 4 (6,4), new body seg6 at old 5 (5,4), new body seg7 at old 6 (5,3), new body seg8 at old 7 (4,3), new body seg9 at old 8 (3,3), new body seg10 at old 9 (2,3), new body seg11 at old 10 (1,3), new body seg12 at old 11 (1,4), and new tail at old 12 (1,5)\n\nSo tail at (1,5), and 13 segments.\n\nNow, on turn 49, from (4,5), move to (3,5) to eat food.\n\n(3,5) is not occupied by any body currently, and not wall, so safe to move.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) and eating:\n\n- Head at (3,5)\n\n- New body segment added, so the tail doesn't move. So new snake: head (3,5), then old head (4,5) becomes body, then the previous body segments, and the old tail (1,5) remains, and a new segment is added at the end? No, when eating, the head moves to the food, the body remains as is, but since tail doesn't move, a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n\nSo positions: new head (3,5), then old body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), and old tail (1,5) remains as tail, so now 14 segments, with tail at (1,5).\n\nLength increased.\n\nNo Tail Reward Danger because tail is far.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nAfter eating, head is at (3,5), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,5): left to (2,5), up to (3,6), down to (3,4), not right (reverse).\n\nNow, what about the grid? We have an internal obstacle at (5,2), but that might not be relevant immediately.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around.\n\nLet's see the area near (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied? After eating, positions: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nSo (2,5) is not occupied, empty.\n\n(3,6) not occupied, (3,4) not occupied.\n\nBut (3,4) might be close to body, but not occupied.\n\n(3,4) is below (3,5).\n\nNow, I need to think about survival. After eating, the snake is longer, and the tail is at (1,5), which is near the left wall.\n\nBut walls are at x=0, so (1,5) is not wall, x=1, y=5.\n\nx=0 is wall, so (1,5) is safe.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should look for more food, but currently only one food, and it's eaten.\n\nThe food at (3,5) is eaten on turn 49, so no other food now.\n\nBut the problem is to plan multiple turns, and think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the state after turn 49.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for turns starting from t1=48.\n\nSo for turn 48, I must move left to (4,5), as it's the only safe move.\n\nThen on turn 49, I can move to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut is there a reason not to eat it immediately? It might be risky or something, but seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I can delay eating to plan a better path, but the food has limited life, only until turn 52, but I can eat it on turn 49.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 49, where can I go?\n\nFrom (4,5), I could move up to (4,6) or down to (4,4).\n\n(4,6): is it safe? Currently, after turn 48, snake positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\n(4,6) is not occupied, and not wall, so safe to move up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) not occupied, safe down.\n\nBut if I move up to (4,6), then head at (4,6), direction up.\n\nThen food at (3,5) is still there, but I'm moving away.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (4,4), moving away.\n\nBut the food will disappear soon, so I should eat it while I can.\n\nMoreover, not eating it means missing a point, and since it's positive food, I should eat it.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger is not an issue.\n\nSo probably best to eat on turn 49.\n\nThen after eating, head at (3,5), direction left.\n\nNow turn 50, from (3,5), I can move left to (2,5), up to (3,6), down to (3,4), not right.\n\n(2,5) is empty, as per earlier positions.\n\n(3,6) empty, (3,4) empty.\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term survival. The snake is long, 14 segments after eating, and the grid has walls and obstacle.\n\nThe area around (3,5) might be getting crowded.\n\nLet's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake after eating at (3,5) on turn 49: positions:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail\n\nNow, from (3,5), if I move left to (2,5), that's fine.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction left.\n\nThen possible moves: left to (1,5), but (1,5) is the tail! But tail is not body, so moving to tail is safe, as long as it's not Tail Reward Danger.\n\n(1,5) is tail, so moving to it is ok, tail will move away.\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 50, then to (1,5) on turn 51.\n\nBut (1,5) is tail, so when I move to it, if no food, tail moves, so no issue.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince the tail is at (1,5), and I'm moving left, I might go towards the wall.\n\nx=0 is wall, so (1,5) is safe, but (0,5) is wall, cannot go.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move left to (1,5), or up to (2,6), down to (2,4), not right (reverse).\n\n(1,5) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\n(2,6) and (2,4) should be empty.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) on turn 50, snake: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), etc., tail at (1,5)? Let's simulate.\n\nOn turn 49, after eating: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\n14 segments.\n\nTurn 50, move left to (2,5): no food there, so tail moves.\n\nNew head (2,5), new body: old head (3,5) becomes body, then old body segments, and tail old (1,4) or something.\n\nAfter move without eating: head to (2,5), which is empty, so no eat.\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nNew body: old head (3,5) becomes first body, then old body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), and old tail (1,5) is removed? No.\n\nPositions: old head (3,5) to old tail (1,5) with 14 points.\n\nMove head to (2,5), no eat, so new head (2,5), new body: old positions except tail is removed, so new body: old head (3,5), then old body seg1 (4,5), ..., up to old body seg12 (1,4), and new tail at old body seg12 position? Old positions: let's index.\n\nAfter turn 49:\n\n0: head (3,5)\n\n1: body (4,5)\n\n2: (5,5)\n\n3: (5,6)\n\n4: (6,6)\n\n5: (6,5)\n\n6: (6,4)\n\n7: (5,4)\n\n8: (5,3)\n\n9: (4,3)\n\n10: (3,3)\n\n11: (2,3)\n\n12: (1,3)\n\n13: (1,4)\n\n14: tail (1,5)  // 15 segments? 0 to 14 is 15 points.\n\nInitial was 14, after eating, +1, so 15 segments.\n\nTurn 49 after eating: head (3,5), then 13 body segments and one tail, but all are positions.\n\nPositions: head, and 14 body segments? No: the list has head and multiple body, tail is the last.\n\nIn the state, \"Snake Positions\" is a list of all segments, head first, then body, tail last.\n\nAfter turn 49, positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] so 15 positions.\n\nTurn 50, move to (2,5), no food, so head moves to (2,5), tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then body: old head (3,5), old seg1 (4,5), old seg2 (5,5), old seg3 (5,6), old seg4 (6,6), old seg5 (6,5), old seg6 (6,4), old seg7 (5,4), old seg8 (5,3), old seg9 (4,3), old seg10 (3,3), old seg11 (2,3), old seg12 (1,3), old seg13 (1,4), and old tail (1,5) gone. So new tail at (1,4).\n\n14 segments.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction left.\n\nThen turn 51, I can move left to (1,5), which is the current tail position? But after move, tail is at (1,4), so (1,5) is empty now? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4)\n\n(1,5) is not occupied, empty.\n\nMoving to (1,5) is safe.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction left.\n\nThen from there, I can move down to (1,4), but (1,4) is tail, or up to (1,6), or left to (0,5) but x=0 wall, cannot.\n\n(1,6) might be available.\n\nBut let's not go too deep; I need to plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBack to turn 48.\n\nFor turn 48, only possible move is left to (4,5).\n\nThen for turn 49, I should move to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nThen for turn 50, from (3,5), I can move in different directions.\n\nBut to think long-term, after eating, the snake is in the left area, and the body is spread, so I need to find a safe path without trapping myself.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I move down to (3,4), then I can go to (3,3), but (3,3) is body? After eating on turn 49, (3,3) is body segment.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nSo (3,3) is occupied, so moving to (3,4) or (3,6) or (2,5).\n\n(3,4) is not occupied, safe.\n\n(3,6) not occupied.\n\n(2,5) not occupied.\n\nIf I move down to (3,4) on turn 50.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction down.\n\nThen possible moves: down to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, occupied, deadly.\n\nLeft to (2,4), right to (4,4), up to (3,5) but (3,5) is body now, after move, it would be body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), no eat, so new head (3,4), body: old head (3,5), then (4,5), etc., tail moves, so (3,3) might still be body.\n\nLet's not simulate all; it might be risky to go down because (3,3) is there.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (3,6), that might be open.\n\nOr left to (2,5), then to (1,5) etc.\n\nBut to avoid risk, from (3,5), moving left to (2,5) might be better, as it's away from the body cluster.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move left to (1,5), then from (1,5), I can move up to (1,6) or down to (1,4), since left is wall.\n\n(1,6) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 49, (1,6) is not occupied, since tail is at (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is body? Positions: (1,4) is body, but after moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I should define a path.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state might change with new food or something, but in this input, only one food given, and no new food mentioned, so I think only this food exists for now.\n\nThe problem says \"Food can spawn\", but in the state, only one is given, so I assume no other food for the planning.\n\nSo for turn 48: move left to (4,5)\n\nTurn 49: move left to (3,5) to eat food\n\nThen for turn 50, from (3,5), move left to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 51, from (2,5), move left to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 52, from (1,5), I can move down to (1,4) or up to (1,6), since left is wall, right to (2,5) but that might be body.\n\nAfter turn 51, let's assume we moved to (1,5).\n\nAfter turn 50: head at (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail at (1,4) or something.\n\nI need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake is long, I need to ensure I don't trap myself.\n\nAnother idea: from (3,5) after eating, instead of left, move up to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is empty, then head at (3,6), direction up.\n\nThen I can move left to (2,6), or right to (4,6), or up to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot.\n\n(3,7) is wall, since y=7.\n\nSo from (3,6), move left to (2,6) or right to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) might be free, (4,6) might be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 49, (4,6) is not occupied, positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), etc., so (4,6) not there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) not there.\n\nSo moving up to (3,6) is possible.\n\nBut let's decide on a sequence.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, at least 5 turns, since t1=48.\n\nt1=48, so turns 48 to 52 or 53.\n\nBut food life span 5 at turn 48, so by turn 52 it can be eaten.\n\nIn my plan, I eat on turn 49.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to move safely.\n\nTo maximize score, I should look for opportunities, but no other food, so survival is key.\n\nPerhaps I can head towards the center or open area.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the left and bottom, with the head now at (3,5) after turn 49.\n\nThe area around (4,4) or (4,5) might be occupied.\n\n(4,5) is body after turn 49.\n\nFree cells: for example, (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), etc., but some might be occupied later.\n\nTo avoid risk, from (3,5), moving to (2,5) is safe, then to (1,5), then to (1,6) or (1,4).\n\n(1,6) is near wall, y=7 wall, so (1,6) is ok, but (1,7) wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) ok.\n\nThen from (1,5), move up to (1,6), then from (1,6), I can move right to (2,6), since down to (1,5) body, left wall.\n\n etc.\n\nBut I think for the purpose, since on turn 48 I have only one choice, and on turn 49 I eat, then I can choose a safe path.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for turn 48: L (left to (4,5))\n\nTurn 49: L (left to (3,5) eat food)\n\nThen for turn 50: L (left to (2,5))\n\nTurn 51: L (left to (1,5))\n\nThen turn 52: from (1,5), move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), say U to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 53: from (1,6), move R to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut this is arbitrary, and I need to think 5 turns ahead from t1.\n\nFrom t1=48, turns 48,49,50,51,52.\n\nSo actions for those.\n\nOn turn 52, if I move to (1,6), it should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are safe.\n\nFirst, turn 48: move L to (4,5) - safe, as we established.\n\nTurn 49: move L to (3,5) - safe, eat food.\n\nAfter that, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,5) - (2,5) is empty, safe.\n\nAfter move, head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 51: move L to (1,5) - (1,5) was tail, but after previous moves, on turn 50, before move, positions: after turn 49 eat, head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nTurn 50 move to (2,5): no eat, so new head (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4)  // since old tail (1,5) removed, new tail at (1,4)\n\n(1,5) is now empty.\n\nTurn 51 move to (1,5): (1,5) empty, so safe, move there.\n\nNew head (1,5), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail at (1,3) or something, new tail at (1,3) since old tail was (1,4), removed.\n\nAfter move to (1,5), no eat, new head (1,5), body: old head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), ..., up to (1,3), and old tail (1,4) gone, so tail at (1,3).\n\nTurn 52: from (1,5), head direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), not R (reverse to (2,5)), not L (wall).\n\n(1,6) should be empty, (1,4) is body? Current positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), tail (1,3)\n\n(1,4) is not in the list, empty? Positions: (1,3) is tail, (1,4) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) empty.\n\nSo move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), say U to (1,6).\n\nThen safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to provide up to turn 52 or so.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 49, and no other food, the actions after are for survival, and any safe move is fine.\n\nBut to be specific.\n\nIn the initial state, on turn 48, moving left is the only choice, so I must do that.\n\nThen on turn 49, moving to eat the food is best.\n\nThen for turn 50, moving left is safe and away from body.\n\nSimilarly for 51 and 52.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nTurn 49: L\n\nTurn 50: L\n\nTurn 51: L\n\nTurn 52: U  (for example)\n\nBut on turn 52, from (1,5), move U to (1,6).\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 51, head at (1,5), then turn 52 move U.\n\nBut I need to think if there is a better way, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps from (3,5) after eating, move up to (3,6) instead of left.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think the sequence is acceptable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 48: L (left)\n\nTurn 49: L (left to eat food)\n\nTurn 50: L (left to (2,5))\n\nTurn 51: L (left to (1,5))\n\nTurn 52: U (up to (1,6))\n\nAnd that should be for 5 turns.\n\nt1=48 to t1+4=52, so turns 48,49,50,51,52.\n\n5 turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 48):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Head at (5,5), direction Down.\n  - Positions: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)] (14 segments).\n- **Food**: \n  - One positive food at (3,5) with value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 52).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 48 Movement**: \n  - Current head direction is Down, so reverse move (Up) is invalid.\n  - Moving Down to (5,4): Cell is occupied by body segment (index 5), causing collision → deadly.\n  - Moving Right to (6,5): Cell is occupied by body segment (index 3), causing collision → deadly.\n  - Moving Left to (4,5): Cell is empty and safe → only viable move.\n- **Food Objective**: \n  - Food at (3,5) must be eaten by turn 52 to gain +1 score and increase length.\n  - (3,5) is adjacent to (4,5), so eating on turn 49 is optimal (avoids life-span loss and minimizes risk).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - After eating, snake length increases to 15, making space management critical.\n  - Snake body occupies left/bottom area (e.g., (1,3) to (6,6)); open areas include (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6).\n  - Avoid trapping near walls or body clusters. Moving left toward (1,5) and then up/down is safe for several turns.\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 48-52):**\n1. **Turn 48**: Move Left (L) to (4,5) – Only safe move; avoids collision.\n2. **Turn 49**: Move Left (L) to (3,5) – Eat food (+1 score, length 15); no Tail Reward Danger (tail is at (1,5), not adjacent).\n3. **Turn 50**: Move Left (L) to (2,5) – Safe, empty cell; moves away from body cluster.\n4. **Turn 51**: Move Left (L) to (1,5) – Safe, empty cell; head now near left wall.\n5. **Turn 52**: Move Up (U) to (1,6) – Safe, empty cell; avoids wall collision (x=0) and positions for future moves.\n\n**Why this plan?**\n- **Maximizes Score**: Eats positive food on turn 49 before life-span expires.\n- **Prioritizes Survival**: All moves avoid collisions and instant reverses. Path leverages open space near (1,5)-(1,6) for flexibility beyond turn 52.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No body collisions or Tail Reward Danger. Food is eaten when head is not adjacent to tail.\n- **Beyond Turn 52**: If no new food, continue moving safely (e.g., from (1,6), move Right to (2,6) or Down to (1,5), depending on body).\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: L (left)  \nTurn 49: L (left)  \nTurn 50: L (left)  \nTurn 51: L (left)  \nTurn 52: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nCurrent turn is 49.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,5), and it's moving left (L). The body segments are: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's 14 segments, so the snake length is 14.\n\nFood:\n\n- At (3,5) with value 1 and life span 4. This means it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn. So it will be gone by turn 53 if not eaten.\n\n- At (6,2) with value 1 and life span 10. So it disappears after turn 59 if not eaten.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake body:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Then: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSince head is moving left, and direction is L, from (4,5), moving left would be to (3,5), but (3,5) has food? Food is at (3,5), yes.\n\nBut I need to check if moving left is possible.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R (opposite direction).\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so I cannot move R (right), because that would be instant reverse. So allowed moves: L (continue left), U (up), D (down).\n\nNow, let's see the adjacent cells to head at (4,5):\n\n- Left (L): (3,5) – this has food, and it's not a wall or body? Let's check.\n\n(3,5) is a food position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo (3,5) is not in this list, so it's empty except for food.\n\nBut food can be eaten only if head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, walls: borders are walls, so x=0,7 or y=0,7 are out of bounds. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo for (3,5): x=3, y=5, which is within 1-6, not a wall, not occupied by snake body (only food), so moving left to (3,5) is possible.\n\nNow, up from (4,5): (4,6)\n\n(4,6): is it wall? y=6, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable. x=4, y=6.\n\nIs it occupied? Snake has (5,6) and (6,6), but not (4,6), so empty? Let's see snake positions: (5,6) is there, but (4,6) not listed, so should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, down from (4,5): (4,4)\n\n(4,4): not in snake positions, not wall, so empty.\n\nBut there might be food, but no food at (4,4) or (4,6), only at (3,5) and (6,2).\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5) with direction L:\n\n- L to (3,5)\n\n- U to (4,6)\n\n- D to (4,4)\n\nNow, I need to think about risks and food.\n\nFirst, moving to (3,5) would eat the food since it's positive food. Eating it increases length by 1, so snake grows.\n\nBut there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nWhat is the tail? Snake positions: last element is (1,5), so tail is at (1,5).\n\nHead is at (4,5), tail at (1,5). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so same row or column, distance 1.\n\n(4,5) and (1,5) are not adjacent; distance in x is 3, so not adjacent.\n\nMoreover, the food is at (3,5), not on the tail. Tail is at (1,5), no food on it.\n\nSo eating (3,5) should be fine.\n\nLife span of (3,5) is 4, current turn 49, so it disappears after 4 turns, meaning on turn 50, life span becomes 3, then 2 on 51, 1 on 52, gone on 53. Since we're at turn 49, moving to it on this turn would eat it.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it might be available for a few more turns.\n\nBut there's also food at (6,2) with longer life span.\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving left to eat (3,5) immediately.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), head moves to (3,5), and since I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows: new head at (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), ..., up to (1,5), and tail stays at (1,5) for now? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the tail, but the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added, so tail stays in place, meaning the last segment doesn't move, so the tail position remains until the next move when it moves.\n\nIn terms of positions: after eating, head is at new position, and the body includes the old head and all segments, with tail unchanged. Then next move, tail moves.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,5) and eat:\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- Body: old head (4,5) becomes first body segment, then (5,5), (5,6), ..., (1,5) is still tail.\n\nSnake length increases to 15.\n\nThen next turn, when I move, tail will move.\n\nBut for now, no immediate danger.\n\nNow, after moving to (3,5), head is at (3,5), and direction was moving left, so new head direction L.\n\nBut I can choose next move.\n\nNow, what about other moves?\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), no food, so head moves to (4,6), tail moves, so snake length same, tail (1,5) moves to the next position, which is (1,4)? Let's see the snake path.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nSo the tail is (1,5), and before that is (1,4), so when snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail (1,5) is removed, and the new last segment is (1,4) or something.\n\nWhen moving without eating:\n\n- Head moves to new cell\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n\n- The tail cell is vacated\n\nSo from positions: let's index them: S0 = head (4,5), S1=(5,5), S2=(5,6), S3=(6,6), S4=(6,5), S5=(6,4), S6=(5,4), S7=(5,3), S8=(4,3), S9=(3,3), S10=(2,3), S11=(1,3), S12=(1,4), S13=(1,5) tail.\n\nIf I move to (4,6), for example:\n\nNew head at (4,6)\n\nThen S0 moves to (4,6), so S1 moves to S0's old position (4,5)? No:\n\nThe body segments: the segment that was at S1 moves to where S0 was, which is (4,5)\n\nS2 moves to where S1 was, (5,5)\n\nS3 moves to where S2 was, (5,6)\n\nS4 moves to where S3 was, (6,6)\n\nS5 moves to where S4 was, (6,5)\n\nS6 moves to where S5 was, (6,4)\n\nS7 moves to where S6 was, (5,4)\n\nS8 moves to where S7 was, (5,3)\n\nS9 moves to where S8 was, (4,3)\n\nS10 moves to where S9 was, (3,3)\n\nS11 moves to where S10 was, (2,3)\n\nS12 moves to where S11 was, (1,3)\n\nS13 moves to where S12 was, (1,4)\n\nAnd the old S13 position (1,5) is vacated.\n\nTail is now at (1,4)\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (4,4), similar thing.\n\nBut back to choices.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), I eat the food, so:\n\nHead moves to (3,5), which was food, so eaten.\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThen the body: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (3,5), then old head (4,5) as first body, then (5,5), (5,6), ..., up to (1,5) as tail, but since we add a segment, the tail stays, so the snake has 15 segments now: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nTail is at (1,5)\n\nThen next turn, when I move, tail will move.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut I need to think about the future.\n\nNow, the food at (3,5) has life span 4, so it will be there for turns 49,50,51,52, gone on 53.\n\nSince we're at turn 49, I can eat it now or later, but if I don't eat it now, it might be risky to go back, or I might not get another chance.\n\nBut there's another food at (6,2) with life span 10, so I have more time for that.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's look at the grid state.\n\nI should consider the snake's path and possible dead ends.\n\nThe snake is currently in a sort of loop or something.\n\nList all occupied cells to see free cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2)\n\nSnake: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nFree cells: total grid 6x6 = 36 cells, minus walls? Borders are walls, so playable cells: x=1-6, y=1-6, 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,2) is occupied by wall, so not playable.\n\nSo free cells: 36 - 1 (obstacle) - 14 (snake) = 21 free cells? 36 - 1 = 35, minus 14 snake = 21, but there are two food cells, which are part of free cells but occupied by food, but food can be eaten, so they are accessible.\n\nFood at (3,5) and (6,2), both free except for food.\n\n(6,2) is free? (6,2): x=6, y=2, not in snake positions, not wall? Walls: borders and (5,2), so (6,2) is not border, not obstacle, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is free except food.\n\nNow, after eating (3,5), it becomes snake head.\n\nBut let's think about the area.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the left and bottom, with head at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at row 5, column 4.\n\nFood at (3,5) is left of head.\n\nIf I eat it, head moves to (3,5), then I need to move from there.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U, D, L, but not R? Head direction would be L since I moved left to get there.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), direction is L.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: L (left to (2,5)), U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), not R (right to (4,5)) because that would be opposite direction, and (4,5) is now body, so cannot move there anyway.\n\nNow, (2,5): is it free? Snake has (2,3) and (1,3) etc, but (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(3,6): y=6, not wall, not snake, free.\n\n(3,4): not snake, not wall, free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nIf I don't eat now, and move away, I might come back later for the food, but life span is short, only 4 turns including this one.\n\nLife span 4 means: on turn 49, it's there; after turn 49, life span decreases to 3; after turn 50, to 2; after 51, to 1; after 52, gone, so it can be eaten until turn 52.\n\nBut on turn 52, if I move to it, I eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for the other food.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (1,5), and it will move as the snake moves.\n\nSince the snake is long, the tail will free up space slowly.\n\nLet's consider the immediate choice.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (3,5) and eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows to 15, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (2,5), U to (3,6), or D to (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is adjacent to (2,3) which is body, but not the same cell, so ok, as long as not colliding.\n\n(2,3) is body, (2,5) is two cells away, so not adjacent for collision; collision only if head moves to a body cell.\n\n(2,5) is free, so moving there is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) free, (3,4) free.\n\nBut no food nearby, except the other food at (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is far, and I need to navigate.\n\nAfter eating, the tail is at (1,5), and it will move next time I move without eating.\n\nIf I go to (3,4), for example, then I can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should avoid getting trapped.\n\nAnother option: move U to (4,6).\n\nThen no food, so head moves to (4,6), tail moves from (1,5) to (1,4), so positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\nDirection: I moved up, so new head direction U.\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid. D to (4,5) but (4,5) is now body, cannot move there. L to (3,6), R to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is body? Current positions: after move, (5,6) is occupied, yes, it's the fourth segment or something.\n\nPositions: S0=(4,6), S1=(4,5), S2=(5,5), S3=(5,6), etc.\n\nSo (5,6) is S3, occupied.\n\nSo from (4,6), with direction U, possible moves: since U, cannot D (down), so allowed: U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,6): is it free? Not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nR to (5,6): but (5,6) is occupied by snake body (S3), so cannot move there.\n\n(5,6) is occupied, so moving R to (5,6) would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, only possible move from (4,6) after moving U is L to (3,6).\n\nThen head to (3,6), direction L (since I moved left from (4,6)? Direction: I moved U to (4,6), so direction is U. Then from (4,6), moving L to (3,6) is left, which is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nThen new head at (3,6), direction L? When I move to (3,6), the direction becomes the direction I moved, so L.\n\nThen from there, I can go L, U, D, but not R.\n\n(3,6) to L (2,6), U (3,7) wall, D (3,5).\n\n(3,5) has food, but let's see.\n\nBut if I move U first, I end up at (3,6) with food at (3,5) below.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D from (4,5) to (4,4).\n\nMove D to (4,4): no food, so head to (4,4), tail moves to (1,4), positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail? After moving, S0=(4,4), S1=(4,5), S2=(5,5), S3=(5,6), S4=(6,6), S5=(6,5), S6=(6,4), S7=(5,4), S8=(5,3), S9=(4,3), S10=(3,3), S11=(2,3), S12=(1,3), S13=(1,4) tail.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: D to (4,3), U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nBut U to (4,5): (4,5) is S1, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is S9, occupied, cannot.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) is S7, occupied, cannot.\n\nL to (3,4): not occupied, free.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go L to (2,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3).\n\n(3,5) has food, (3,3) is body? (3,3) is S10, occupied, so cannot go D to (3,3).\n\nU to (3,5) is possible, L to (2,4) possible.\n\nD to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,4), can go L or U.\n\nIf I go U to (3,5), eat food.\n\nOr L to (2,4).\n\nBut in this path, if I move D first, I am forced to go to (3,4), and then I can eat the food from below.\n\nBut it takes two moves to eat it, whereas if I go left directly, I eat it in one move.\n\nAlso, by moving away, I risk not being able to come back if the tail blocks or something.\n\nNow, tail is at (1,5), and as I move, it will move slowly.\n\nFor example, if I move U or D, tail moves towards (1,4) or something.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,5). If I don't eat it now, and I move away, I can come back later, but life span is short.\n\nTurn 49: life span 4\n\nAfter turn 49: life span 3 (turn 50)\n\nTurn 50: if not eaten, life span 2\n\nTurn 51: life span 1\n\nTurn 52: life span 0, gone after turn.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 49,50,51, or 52.\n\nIf I eat it on turn 49, I get it immediately.\n\nIf I delay, I might get it later, but I need to make sure I can reach it.\n\nAlso, the other food at (6,2) has life span 10, so until turn 59.\n\nBut I should eat both if possible.\n\nNow, the area around (3,5) might become tight.\n\nFor example, if I move away, the tail might move, freeing space, but since the snake is long, it might not free the path quickly.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns.\n\nFirst, consider not eating now and going for the other food.\n\nBut (6,2) is at bottom right, and there's an obstacle at (5,2), so (6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), so I need to go right and down.\n\nBut from (4,5), moving R is not allowed because direction is L, cannot reverse to R.\n\nSo I can only go U, D, or L.\n\nL is to (3,5) with food.\n\nU to (4,6), then only to (3,6) as we saw.\n\nD to (4,4), then to (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,5) to eat, or to (2,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), from there I can go to (3,5) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) might be free.\n\nBut let's think about the tail.\n\nTail is at (1,5), and as I move, it will move down or left.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (4,6), then to (3,6), then if I go to (3,5), I can eat the food on turn 51 or something.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\nAt turn 49, if I move U to (4,6), no eat.\n\nTurn 50: from (4,6) I must go L to (3,6), no eat.\n\nThen at (3,6), turn 51: I can go D to (3,5) to eat, or L to (2,6), etc.\n\nIf I go D to (3,5), I eat on turn 51, which is within life span.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D first to (4,4), then to (3,4), then on turn 51 I can go U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSo I can delay eating by a couple of turns.\n\nBut is there a benefit to delaying?\n\nBy not eating now, I keep the snake shorter, which might make it easier to maneuver, but since I need to eat eventually, it might not matter.\n\nAlso, by eating later, the food might be there, but I need to consider if the cell is accessible.\n\nAnother thing: the tail position. If I eat now, the tail stays at (1,5) longer, which might block the bottom left area.\n\nIf I don't eat, tail moves faster, freeing space.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (4,6), no eat, tail moves to (1,4).\n\nThen to (3,6), tail moves to (1,3), etc.\n\nThe tail is moving leftward and downward.\n\nCurrent tail (1,5), after one move without eating, tail to (1,4), then to (1,3), but (1,3) is before (1,4) in the body, so when tail moves, it vacates (1,5), then to (1,4), etc.\n\nIn terms of freeing cells, moving without eating frees the tail cell.\n\nSo if I don't eat, I free a cell each turn.\n\nIf I eat, I don't free a cell, and add a segment.\n\nBut for the food at (3,5), it's close to the head, so I can eat it easily.\n\nNow, the other food at (6,2) is near the obstacle.\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right, and obstacle at (5,2), so to reach (6,2), I can come from above, since (5,2) is blocked, so from (6,3) or (6,1), but y=1 is wall, so only from (6,3) or (7,2) but x=7 wall, so only from (6,3) or (5,2) blocked, so only from north: (6,3).\n\n(6,2) has neighbors: up (6,3), down (6,1) wall, left (5,2) obstacle, right (7,2) wall. So only accessible from (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) must be free to access (6,2).\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is not occupied; snake has (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but (6,3) is free? Let's see: snake positions include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free.\n\nAlso, (6,2) has food.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go to (6,3) first, then down to (6,2).\n\nBut down to (6,2) from (6,3) is south.\n\nNow, from current position, how to get there.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go down to (4,4), then to (3,4), then I can go down to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I go down to (3,3), it's occupied, so I can only go left or up to (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), after moving D, I go to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can go L to (2,4) or U to (3,5).\n\nIf I go U to (3,5), I eat the food, then at (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) or left to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (6,2), I need to go right.\n\nBut the right side has the snake body.\n\nFor example, cells like (5,4), (5,3), (6,4), etc are occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail will move, freeing those cells.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,5), and it will move to (1,4), then (1,3), etc.\n\nThe body segments will shift.\n\nThe occupied cells are from (1,3) to (1,5), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5).\n\nAs I move, if I don't eat, the tail end will be freed.\n\nFor example, if I move without eating for a few turns, the cells around (1,3) to (1,5) will be freed first, then (2,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (6,2), I need to go to the bottom right.\n\nFrom head at (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), then to (3,4), then I can go left to (2,4) or up to (3,5).\n\nIf I go left, to (2,4), then I can go down to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, or left to (1,4) body, or up to (2,5) or down to (2,3) occupied.\n\n(2,4) neighbors: U (2,5), D (2,3), L (1,4), R (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is occupied, (1,4) occupied, so from (2,4), I can only go U to (2,5) or R to (3,4), but (3,4) is where I came from, so not good.\n\n(2,5) is free, I think.\n\nSo from (2,4), I can go U to (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6), L to (1,5) but (1,5) might be occupied or freed, etc.\n\nThis might lead to a dead end if I go left.\n\nBetter to go towards the right.\n\nBut from (4,5), if I go U to (4,6), then to (3,6), then from (3,6) I can go to (3,5) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, then from (2,6) I can go down to (2,5) or left to (1,6) or right to (3,6) but came from.\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6, not wall, free.\n\nBut then I'm going further left and up, away from (6,2).\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nFrom current position, going down might be better.\n\nMove D to (4,4), then to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can go U to (3,5) to eat, or if I don't, go L to (2,4), but as before, then to (2,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), after moving from (4,4), I can only go U or L, as D is occupied.\n\nIf I go L to (2,4), then to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) to (2,4) is left, then to (2,5) up, then I can go to (2,6) or (1,5), but (1,5) might be tail.\n\nLet's think about freeing the body.\n\nThe body at the bottom left will be freed as the tail moves.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,5). After one move without eating, tail moves to (1,4), freeing (1,5).\n\nThen after another move, tail to (1,3), freeing (1,4), and so on.\n\nThe cells (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) will be freed quickly.\n\nThen (2,3) will be freed later.\n\n(2,3) is part of the body, when tail moves past it.\n\nCurrent body: S11=(1,3), S12=(1,4), S13= (1,5) tail.\n\nAfter one move without eating: tail moves to S12 position, freeing S13.\n\nNew tail is S12, which was (1,4).\n\nAfter second move, tail moves to S11 position, freeing S12, new tail S11 (1,3).\n\nAfter third move, tail moves to S10 position, which is (2,3), freeing S11, new tail (2,3).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the cells around the tail are freed in a few moves.\n\nBut for reaching (6,2), I need to navigate through the center or right side.\n\nThe right side has cells like (5,4), (5,3), (6,4), etc occupied.\n\n(5,4) is S7, (5,3) is S8, (6,4) is S6, etc.\n\nAs I move without eating, these will be freed, but it takes time because the tail is far.\n\nFor example, the distance from tail to head: tail at (1,5), head at (4,5), but the body is not straight, so it takes several moves to free the right side cells.\n\nSpecifically, to free (6,4), for example, which is S6, it will be freed when the tail moves past it.\n\nThe segment numbers: S0 head, S1 to S13 body and tail.\n\nS13 tail.\n\nWhen I move without eating, the last segment S13 is removed, so the new snake has S0 to S12, with S12 as new tail.\n\nIn this case, S12 is (1,4), then next move S11 (1,3) tail, etc.\n\nTo free S6 (6,4), which is the 6th segment from head, it will take many moves.\n\nNumber of segments: from head S0 to tail S13, 14 segments.\n\nS6 is the 7th segment? S0 head, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, so S6 is 7th, but index 6.\n\nPosition in the list: index 0 to 13.\n\nS6 is at index 6, so it will become the tail after 7 moves without eating, because after 7 moves, the tail will be at S6 position.\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the tail is at the position of S_{13-k} for k=1 to 13.\n\nAfter 1 move, tail at S12 position.\n\nAfter 2 moves, tail at S11 position.\n\nAfter 3 moves, tail at S10 position.\n\nAfter 4 moves, tail at S9 position.\n\nAfter 5 moves, tail at S8 position.\n\nAfter 6 moves, tail at S7 position.\n\nAfter 7 moves, tail at S6 position.\n\nAfter 8 moves, tail at S5 position, and so on.\n\nSo to free (6,4), which is S6, it takes 7 moves without eating.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is S7, freed after 6 moves.\n\n(5,3) is S8, freed after 5 moves.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut (6,2) is not occupied, so I can go there, but to reach it, I need to go to (6,3) first.\n\n(6,3) is currently free, as we said.\n\nFrom head at (4,5), I can go down to (4,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) or (2,4), but to go right, I need to wait for cells to free up.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go down to (3,4) but it might be occupied or not, or left to (2,5), etc.\n\nPerhaps I should eat the close food now to gain score and then plan to go for the other food.\n\nSince the food at (3,5) has short life span, it's better to eat it soon to not miss it.\n\nIf I don't eat it, and something happens, I lose it.\n\nAlso, it's +1 score.\n\nSo I think eating it now is good.\n\nThen after eating, I can move towards the other food.\n\nBut after eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), length 15, direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go D to (3,4), U to (3,6), or L to (2,5).\n\n(3,4) is free, (3,6) free, (2,5) free.\n\n(3,4) is below, (3,6) above, (2,5) left.\n\nTo go to (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nFrom (3,5), going right is not possible directly because direction is L, and R is opposite? No, direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nBut R to (4,5) is body, occupied, so cannot anyway.\n\nSo I have to go U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), then I'm going left, away.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then I can go to (2,6) or (3,5), but (3,5) is now body.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go L to (2,6), U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) body, so only L to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6), D to (2,5), etc, still left.\n\nIf I go D from (3,5) to (3,4), then at (3,4), direction D.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied, or L to (2,4), or R to (4,4), or U to (3,5) body.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,4) or R to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) was freed when I moved to (3,4)? Let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nNow, if I move D to (3,4) from (3,5), no food at (3,4), so head to (3,4), tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail. (1,5) freed.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (3,4), as above, can go L to (2,4) or R to (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is free, (4,4) is free.\n\nIf I go R to (4,4), then head to (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go R to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied (in positions, (5,4) is there), let's see current positions: after moving to (3,4), positions include (5,4), which is occupied.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), positions: S0=(3,4), S1=(3,5), S2=(4,5), S3=(5,5), S4=(5,6), S5=(6,6), S6=(6,5), S7=(6,4), S8=(5,4), S9=(5,3), S10=(4,3), S11=(3,3), S12=(2,3), S13=(1,3), S14=(1,4) tail? Snake length is 15 after eating, so after moving without eating, tail moves.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I go R to (4,4), but (4,4) is not occupied in the list? Current positions before move: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), etc, so (4,4) is not in the positions, so it should be free.\n\nPositions: S0=(3,4), S1=(3,5), S2=(4,5), S3=(5,5), S4=(5,6), S5=(6,6), S6=(6,5), S7=(6,4), S8=(5,4), S9=(5,3), S10=(4,3), S11=(3,3), S12=(2,3), S13=(1,3), S14=(1,4) tail.\n\n(4,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) free.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go R to (4,4) or L to (2,4).\n\nIf I go R to (4,4), head to (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go U to (4,5) but (4,5) is S2, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (4,3) but (4,3) is S10, occupied, cannot.\n\nL to (3,4) but just came from, occupied now.\n\nR to (5,4) but (5,4) is S8, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo from (4,4), no possible moves? U, D, L, R all blocked or occupied.\n\nU to (4,5): occupied by S2\n\nD to (4,3): occupied by S10\n\nL to (3,4): occupied by S0? No, after moving to (4,4), the positions are: head (4,4), then (3,4) is S1 now? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter moving from (3,4) to (4,4):\n\nNew head at (4,4)\n\nThen the body: S1 moves to where S0 was, which is (3,4)\n\nS2 moves to where S1 was, (3,5)\n\nS3 moves to where S2 was, (4,5)\n\nS4 to where S3 was, (5,5)\n\nS5 to (5,6)\n\nS6 to (6,6)\n\nS7 to (6,5)\n\nS8 to (6,4)\n\nS9 to (5,4)  // S8 was (6,4)? Let's list:\n\nBefore move: positions at (3,4): S0=(3,4), S1=(3,5), S2=(4,5), S3=(5,5), S4=(5,6), S5=(6,6), S6=(6,5), S7=(6,4), S8=(5,4), S9=(5,3), S10=(4,3), S11=(3,3), S12=(2,3), S13=(1,3), S14=(1,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,4):\n\nHead to (4,4)\n\nThen S1 moves to S0's old position: (3,4)\n\nS2 moves to S1's old position: (3,5)\n\nS3 moves to S2's old position: (4,5)\n\nS4 moves to S3's old position: (5,5)\n\nS5 moves to S4's old position: (5,6)\n\nS6 moves to S5's old position: (6,6)\n\nS7 moves to S6's old position: (6,5)\n\nS8 moves to S7's old position: (6,4)\n\nS9 moves to S8's old position: (5,4)\n\nS10 moves to S9's old position: (5,3)\n\nS11 moves to S10's old position: (4,3)\n\nS12 moves to S11's old position: (3,3)\n\nS13 moves to S12's old position: (2,3)\n\nS14 moves to S13's old position: (1,3)\n\nAnd old S14 position (1,4) freed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.\n\nNow, from head at (4,4), with direction R (since I moved right from (3,4)).\n\nPossible moves: R to (5,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4).\n\n(5,4) is occupied in the list, it's the 10th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,6), 6: (6,6), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (5,4), 10: (5,3), 11: (4,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (2,3), 14: (1,3) tail.\n\nSo (5,4) is index 9, occupied.\n\n(4,5) is index 3, occupied.\n\n(4,3) is index 11, occupied.\n\n(3,4) is index 1, occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied by body, so no possible moves! Dead end.\n\nIf I go to (4,4) from (3,4) after eating at (3,5), I get stuck.\n\nTherefore, from (3,4), I should not go R to (4,4); instead, go L to (2,4).\n\nBut (2,4) is free, then I can go to (2,5) or (1,4) but (1,4) might be occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), positions as above, (1,4) is tail? In the positions after moving to (3,4): tail is at (1,4), but (1,4) is occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), go L to (2,4): (2,4) is free, so head to (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) or (1,4) or (2,3), but (2,3) occupied, (1,4) occupied, so only (2,5) if free.\n\n(2,5) is free, so I can go U to (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,5), and so on.\n\nBut this is leading me to the left, away from (6,2).\n\nTo avoid this, from (3,5) after eating, I should go U to (3,6) or D to (3,4), but if I go D to (3,4), then I must go L to (2,4) to avoid getting stuck, but that's worse.\n\nGo U to (3,6): from (3,5), move U to (3,6), no food, so head to (3,6), tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.

(1,5) freed.\n\nThen turn 50, from (4,4) go L to (3,4), no eat, head to (3,4), tail moves to (1,3).\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail. (1,4) freed.\n\nThen turn 51, from (3,4) go U to (3,5), eat food, so head to (3,5), tail doesn't move, snake grows to 15.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.\n\nNow, from (3,5), I can go L to (2,5), U to (3,6), or D to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is occupied now, as it is the first body segment.\n\n(2,5) free, (3,6) free.\n\nSo I can go L to (2,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then only to (2,6), etc.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), then to (2,6) or (1,5), but (1,5) is free now, etc.\n\nBut still, the right side is blocked.\n\nHowever, some cells have been freed: for example, (1,5) was freed, and (1,4) freed, but (1,3) is tail, so the bottom left is opening up.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go D to (3,4) but occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only L or U.\n\nPerhaps go U to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), but (1,5) is free, so I can go there.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4) or right to (2,5), but (1,4) might be free, etc.\n\nBut this is taking time, and the food at (6,2) has life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut I should start heading that way.\n\nAnother idea: since the food at (3,5) is short-lived, eat it now, then from (3,5) go D to (3,4) but after eating, (3,4) is not occupied yet; after eating at (3,5), positions are head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), etc, so (3,4) is free.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5) on turn 49, positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go D to (3,4).\n\nThen at (3,4), no food, so head to (3,4), tail moves to (1,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.

At least for t1, but probably for a few turns.\n\nSince it's turn-based, I can provide for as many as I can, but for now, let's plan for 5 turns.\n\nStart with turn 49.\n\nMove L to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 50: from (3,5), I go D to (3,4) to start moving down.\n\nThen at (3,4), I must go L to (2,4) to avoid getting stuck.\n\nThen at (2,4), go U to (2,5) or R to (3,4) but came from, so U to (2,5).\n\nThen at (2,5), go U to (2,6) or L to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary.\n\nFrom (3,5), go U to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 50: from (3,6) go L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 51: from (2,6) go L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n\nSay go D to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 52: from (2,5) go D to (2,4), and so on.\n\nBut not towards (6,2).\n\nTo go to (6,2), from (3,5) after eating, go D to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then from (2,4) I can only go U to (2,5), then from (2,5) I can go U to (2,6) or L to (1,5) or D to (2,4) body, so U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), etc.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4) if free, but it might be.\n\nEventually, the tail will move, freeing the right side.\n\nFor example, after several moves, cells like (5,3), (6,4) will be freed.\n\nBut it might take too long.\n\nI could move in a way that the snake follows its tail or something.\n\nBut the tail is moving slowly.\n\nLet's list the tail position over turns.\n\nAt turn 49, tail at (1,5)\n\nIf I don't eat, after move, tail at (1,4)\n\n etc.\n\nBut I think for turn 49, I should eat the food.\n\nThen for turn 50, from (3,5) go U to (3,6) to go up and left.\n\nThen from (3,6) go L to (2,6)\n\nThen from (2,6) go D to (2,5)\n\nThen from (2,5) go D to (2,4) or L to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut let's count the turns for the other food.\n\nPerhaps I can go for the other food directly.\n\nFrom (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 50: from (4,4) go L to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 51: from (3,4) go U to (3,5) to eat the food on turn 51.\n\nLife span ok.\n\nThen after eating, at (3,5), then I can go L to (2,5) or U to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut during these turns, the tail has moved: at turn 49 move D to (4,4), tail to (1,4)\n\nTurn 50 move to (3,4), tail to (1,3)\n\nTurn 51 move to (3,5) eat, tail stays at (1,3)\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body? After eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (3,4) is not necessarily body; let's see.\n\nAfter move to (3,4) on turn 50, positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), etc, tail at (1,3)\n\nThen turn 51, move U to (3,5) eat, so new head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), ..., up to (1,3) tail, and add segment, so tail at (1,3).\n\n(3,4) is first body segment.\n\nFrom (3,5), can go L to (2,5), U to (3,6), or D to (3,4) occupied, so only L or U.\n\nSay go L to (2,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut still not towards (6,2).\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go to (6,3) first.\n\n(6,3) is currently free, and will remain free for a while.\n\nFrom head position, I can go down and right, but it's blocked.\n\nAfter a few moves, when the tail moves, (6,4) will be freed after 7 moves, as calculated.\n\nAt turn 49, S6 is (6,4), freed after 7 moves without eating.\n\nSo on turn 56, it will be free.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nBut I can go through other paths.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), move D to (4,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) on turn 51, then from (3,5) go U to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), then to (1,4), then to (1,3), but (1,3) is tail, may be occupied.\n\nWhen I reach, it might be free.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can go right to (2,3) or down to (1,2) etc.\n\nBut (1,2) is y=2, not wall.\n\nThen I can go to (2,2), (3,2), but (3,2) is free, then to (4,2), (5,2) obstacle, so cannot, so to (4,2), then to (4,1) wall, or (5,2) blocked, so only up to (4,3) or right to (5,3) but (5,3) is body.\n\nComplicated.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat the food at (3,5) now and then slowly move towards the left to free space, then come back for the other food.\n\nBut the other food might despawn if I take too long, but life span 10, so 10 turns from now.\n\nTurn 49 to 59.\n\nIn 10 turns, I can reach (6,2) if I go directly.\n\nBut from current position, it's blocked.\n\nI think for turn 49, I'll move L to (3,5) and eat.\n\nThen for the sequence, I'll provide actions for a few turns.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nAnother idea: move U to (4,6) on turn 49.\n\nThen turn 50: to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 51: to (3,5) eat food.\n\nThen at (3,5), same as before.\n\nBut during this, on turn 49, I don't eat, so tail moves, freeing (1,5).\n\nOn turn 50, tail moves to (1,3), freeing (1,4).\n\n etc.\n\nBut not significant.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nFor turn 49, move L to (3,5) to eat the food and secure the point.\n\nThen for turn 50, from (3,5) go U to (3,6) to move up.\n\nThen turn 51: from (3,6) go L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 52: from (2,6) go D to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 53: from (2,5) go D to (2,4)\n\netc.\n\nBut let's see the food at (6,2): life span 10, so on turn 59 it disappears.\n\nBy turn 53, I can be at (2,4), then I can go to (2,3) when freed, etc.\n\nBut it might be possible.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll go with eating now.\n\nSo for turn 49: move L\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to provide, but since the state may change, perhaps only for turn 49 is required, but the format suggests multiple.\n\nI'll provide for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 49: L\n\nTurn 50: U (from (3,5) to (3,6))\n\nTurn 51: L ( to (2,6) )\n\nTurn 52: D ( to (2,5) )\n\nTurn 53: D ( to (2,4) )\n\nBut at turn 53, the food at (3,5) is gone, and I'm at (2,4), etc.\n\nNot optimal, but for survival.\n\nTo go to (6,2), after eating at (3,5), go D to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then U to (2,5), then L to (1,5), then D to (1,4), and so on, but it's slow.\n\nI think I should accept that and provide the sequence.\n\nSo for turn 49: L to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 50: D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 51: L to (2,4)  (from (3,4) to (2,4))\n\nTurn 52: U to (2,5)  (from (2,4) to (2,5))\n\nTurn 53: U to (2,6)  (from (2,5) to (2,6))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut at turn 50, from (3,4) to (2,4) is L, direction L.\n\nThen at (2,4), go U to (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen at (2,5), go U to (2,6), direction U.\n\n etc.\n\nFor the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the initial move.\n\nPerhaps I can move D on turn 49 to avoid eating now, but I think eating is fine.\n\nI think I'll go with L for turn 49.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan its moves 5+ turns ahead. The current state (turn 49) shows the snake head at (4,5) moving left, with positive food at (3,5) (life span 4, disappearing after turn 52) and (6,2) (life span 10, disappearing after turn 59). The snake length is 14, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Food at (3,5)**: With only 4 turns left (including turn 49), this food must be eaten soon to avoid missing the +1 score. Eating it on turn 49 is efficient and safe, as the head is adjacent and not near the tail, avoiding Tail Reward Danger.\n- **Long-term Food at (6,2)**: This food has a longer life span (10 turns), so it can be targeted later. However, reaching it requires navigating around the snake's body and the obstacle at (5,2). The path to (6,2) is currently blocked by body segments, but cells will free up as the tail moves.\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction instantly. From turn 49, with head direction left (L), valid moves are L, U, or D (not R). After each move, the direction updates.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The snake must avoid walls, the obstacle at (5,2), and its own body. After eating (3,5), the body may temporarily block direct paths to (6,2), but moving upward and leftward can create space as the tail frees cells.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - **Turn 49**: Eat (3,5) immediately to secure the +1 score and increase length to 15. This also starts the process of freeing the tail end.\n  - **Turns 50-53**: Move upward (U) and leftward (L) to avoid body collisions and position for future access to (6,2). This path uses free cells and allows the tail to move, freeing up the bottom-left area. By turn 53, the snake should be near (1,6) or (2,6), with cells like (6,4) expected to free up by turn 56 (based on segment shifting).\n  - **Beyond Turn 53**: After turn 53, the snake can start moving right/down toward (6,2), leveraging freed cells. The food at (6,2) should be targetable by turn 56-59.\n\n### Detailed Move Sequence (Turns 49-53):\n- **Turn 49**: Move L to (3,5) to eat the positive food. This is safe (no adjacent tail risk), gains +1 score, and increases length to 15. New head position: (3,5), direction L.\n- **Turn 50**: From (3,5), move U to (3,6). This avoids moving down (to (3,4)) which could lead to dead ends, and instead heads to open space. New head position: (3,6), direction U.\n- **Turn 51**: From (3,6), move L to (2,6). Only L is valid (U and D blocked), continuing left to free space. New head position: (2,6), direction L.\n- **Turn 52**: From (2,6), move D to (2,5). This descends to avoid walls and positions for downward movement. New head position: (2,5), direction D.\n- **Turn 53**: From (2,5), move D to (2,4). This continues downward, freeing the tail area and preparing to loop back toward the center. New head position: (2,4), direction D.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Survival Focus**: By eating (3,5) immediately and moving upward/leftward, the snake avoids risky areas near its body (e.g., moving right/down from (3,5) could cause traps). The path stays in free cells, with no wall or body collisions.\n- **Long-term Access to (6,2)**: By turn 53, cells like (6,4) and (5,3) will start freeing up (e.g., (6,4) frees after ~7 moves without eating). From (2,4), the snake can move to (1,4), (1,3), etc., then right/down to (6,2) once paths open.\n- **Life Span Management**: (3,5) is eaten on turn 49 before it expires. (6,2) can be eaten by turn 59, as the sequence allows gradual movement toward it.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No instant reverses; all moves comply with direction constraints. Tail Reward Danger is irrelevant here (food not on tail).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Score increases by +1 on turn 49.\n- Snake length 15 after turn 49.\n- By turn 53, the snake is at (2,4), with tail moving to free bottom-left cells. The food at (6,2) remains accessible with 6 turns left (until turn 59).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 49: L\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: L\nTurn 52: D\nTurn 53: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 50. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: the head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's 15 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Then: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\n(1,5) is the tail, I think. Positions are given from head to tail, so tail is the last one: (1,5).\n\nSnake head direction is L, which means it's moving left. Last move was left to (3,5), I assume.\n\nFood: only one food given: (6,2) with life span 9 and value 1. Value 1 means positive food, since +1.\n\nLife span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns, including the current turn, so it has 9 turns left starting from turn 50? Let me read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 50, life span is 9, so it will disappear after turn 58 (since 50 to 58 is 9 turns? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n\n- At turn t, life span N: it appears at turn t, and disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n\n- Turn t: countdown = N\n\n- Turn t+1: countdown = N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + N - 1: countdown = 1\n\n- Turn t + N: countdown = 0, food disappears.\n\nBut the food is present as long as countdown > 0, I think. So for life span N at turn t, it will be available from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n\nIn this case, food at (6,2) with life span 9 at turn 50. So it will be available from turn 50 to turn 58 (countdown from 9 to 1), and disappear at turn 59.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 50.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, except that internal obstacles are given separately. Border cells are walls, meaning we can't move to them. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: let's plot them to see where the snake is.\n\nHead at (3,5), moving left.\n\nBody: from head: (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) tail.\n\nSo the snake is coiled up. Let me sketch this.\n\nAssume x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Usually in grids, (0,0) bottom left, but it doesn't specify, but since walls at y=0 and y=7, I think y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but actually, for movement, it might not matter, but for visualization.\n\nSince head direction is L, it was moving left to (3,5).\n\nNow, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction if it would cause instant reverse. Current head direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on the next turn because it would be instant reverse? No.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is the direction the head is facing, which is given as L. So the snake is currently moving left. Therefore, on the next move, I cannot move right, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nSo for turn 50, possible moves: since moving left, I can move U (up), D (down), or L (left), but not R (right), because R is opposite to L.\n\nMoving left means direction vector is (-1,0), so opposite is (1,0) right.\n\nSo yes, cannot move right on turn 50.\n\nNow, I need to consider the food at (6,2). It's positive food, value +1, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n\nBut it's at (6,2), which might be far or near depending on position.\n\nHead is at (3,5), food at (6,2). So delta x: +3, delta y: -3, so it's down and right.\n\nBut I cannot move right immediately, and also, there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to the food.\n\nBut I have to think about long-term survival and avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there might be dangers like colliding with body or walls.\n\nFirst, let's see what cells are occupied by snake.\n\nList all snake positions to avoid moving into body, except for the tail, which might move.\n\nSnake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nNow, the tail is (1,5), and if I move, the tail will move forward when I eat food or not.\n\nCurrently, no food eaten, so if I don't eat food, the snake moves, head to new position, tail is removed, so tail moves.\n\nWhen I move, if I don't eat food, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated. If I eat food, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows.\n\nFor collision, when moving, I cannot move into a cell occupied by body except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, when moving, the head can move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, because after the move, the tail will have moved, so no collision.\n\nBut for other body segments, if head moves there, it collides.\n\nAlso, walls: cannot move to walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2) is a wall, I assume.\n\nNow, for turn 50, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: up to (3,6)\n\n- D: down to (3,4)\n\n- L: left to (2,5)\n\n- R: right to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by body? (4,5) is the second segment, so it's body, not tail.\n\nTail is (1,5), so (4,5) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nSo moving right to (4,5) would collide with body, since (4,5) is not the tail and will not be vacated.\n\nAfter move, if I move right to (4,5), but (4,5) is currently occupied by the second segment, which is not moving away immediately; only the tail moves when we don't eat food.\n\nWhen the snake moves:\n\n- Head moves to new cell.\n\n- If no food eaten, tail is removed, so the cell is freed.\n\n- If food eaten, tail remains, so the body is longer.\n\nBut for the move itself, when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's collision.\n\nIf it's the tail, and no food eaten, it's ok because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, for moving to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied by the second segment of the body. Since it's not the tail, and it will not move away (only the tail moves if no food), so moving there would cause head to touch body, collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any body cell except tail is bad.\n\nNow, what about moving to tail? If I move to the tail cell, and no food eaten, then tail moves, so head and tail were at same cell for a moment, but since tail moves, no collision. But if I eat food there, it might be dangerous if head is adjacent to tail, but let's see.\n\nFor turn 50, possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) - is this free? Let's see if occupied or wall.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7. So (3,6): x=3 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,2) only, so (3,6) should be free.\n\nNow, is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). No (3,6), so free. So U is possible.\n\n- D: (3,4) - not border, not internal obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake: (3,5), (3,3), but not (3,4). (3,4) not listed, so free. Possible.\n\n- L: (2,5) - not border (x=2>0, y=5 not 0 or 7), not obstacle, not in snake? Snake has (2,3), (1,3), etc., but (2,5) not listed, so free. Possible.\n\n- R: (4,5) - but (4,5) is in snake positions, second segment, so occupied by body, not tail. Cannot move there, collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move R because it's opposite direction? No, the rule is cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn, so since current direction is L, cannot move R. But even if I could, (4,5) is occupied, so impossible anyway.\n\nSo possible moves for turn 50: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at x=6, y=2.\n\nHead at (3,5), so to reach (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut I cannot move right now.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is right above (5,1), but (5,2) is the obstacle, so I cannot go to (5,2).\n\n(6,2) is adjacent? (6,2) and (5,2) are adjacent, but (5,2) is wall, so to reach (6,2), I have to come from left, right, down, or up, but since (5,2) blocked, from left might be tricky.\n\nPossible access to (6,2): neighbors are (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is wall, (7,2) is x=7, which is border wall, so cannot. So only possible from (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is y=1, not 0, so not border, but let's see if it's accessible.\n\ny=0 is wall, so y=1 is not border, but (6,1) might be free or not.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3): y=3, not border.\n\nBut (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrently, snake has (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but not (6,3) or (6,2), etc.\n\n(6,2) is food, so not occupied by snake except if food is under body, but here not, since food is separate.\n\nThe food at (6,2) is not under snake, because snake positions don't include (6,2), so it's free.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I must enter from (6,3) or (6,1), since (5,2) and (7,2) are walls.\n\n(6,1) is y=1, which is above y=0, so not wall, but I need to see if I can get there.\n\nLife span 9 turns, so I have time, but I need to plan.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: the snake is quite long, 15 segments, and the grid is 8x8 with obstacles, so space might be tight. I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFirst, let's see the current grid state.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nLet me make a simple grid, rows y=7 to y=0, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\ny=7: top, y=0: bottom.\n\nBut walls at y=0 and y=7, so cells from y=1 to y=6? No, walls are at the borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning we cannot be there. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls, but since it's cells, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell.\n\nSo the inner grid where we can move is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except for internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is within x=1-6, y=1-6, so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSo playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (5,2).\n\nTotal cells: 6x6=36, minus one obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake has 15 segments, so 15 occupied, 20 free, but food at (6,2), which is playable, so 19 free cells for now.\n\nBut food can be eaten.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFor turn 50, I can go U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), that might be towards the left side, but food is on the right.\n\nU to (3,6) or D to (3,4).\n\nNow, let's see the snake body around.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (3,6), is that safe? (3,6) should be free, as I thought.\n\nThen, from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut let's think about the tail and body.\n\nTail is at (1,5), which is left.\n\nIf I move, the tail will move when no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten this turn, if I move to a new cell, tail moves.\n\nBut for turn 50, I'm not eating food, so after move, tail moves.\n\nCurrent tail is (1,5). When I move, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so the new tail will be (1,4)? Positions: after move, the snake shifts.\n\nSnake positions: head new, then the old head becomes second, and so on, tail is removed.\n\nSo for example, if I move U to (3,6), new head at (3,6), then body: (3,5) becomes first body segment, then (4,5), (5,5), etc., up to (1,4), and (1,5) is removed, so tail is now (1,4)? Let's list.\n\nCurrent positions: indices 0 to 14: 0:(3,5) head, 1:(4,5), 2:(5,5), 3:(5,6), 4:(6,6), 5:(6,5), 6:(6,4), 7:(5,4), 8:(5,3), 9:(4,3), 10:(3,3), 11:(2,3), 12:(1,3), 13:(1,4), 14:(1,5) tail.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), new head at (3,6), then new positions: head (3,6), then the previous segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), and tail (1,5) is removed, so the new tail is (1,4)? Let's see: the last segment was (1,5), removed, so the new last is (1,4), which was index 13.\n\nNew snake: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)  new tail (1,4)\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,4), new head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., down to (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) removed, tail (1,4).\n\nIf move L to (2,5), new head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., down to (1,3), (1,4), tail (1,4) or (1,3)? Current tail (1,5) removed, so new tail (1,4).\n\nIn all cases, since no food, tail moves to (1,4).\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to get to the food at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right, but with obstacle at (5,2), so I can only approach from (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,3) : is it free? Current snake has (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but not (6,3), so free.\n\n(6,1) : y=1, not wall, not occupied, so free.\n\nBut to get to (6,3) or (6,1), I need to navigate.\n\nHead at (3,5), to (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut I cannot move right now.\n\nAlso, the snake body is on the right, so I might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go U to (3,6), then I can go right to (4,6), but (4,6) is not occupied? Current positions: (5,6) is occupied, (6,6), but (4,6) not listed, so free.\n\nThen from (4,6) to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied by body, currently index 3, but after moves, it might change.\n\nI need to think multiple steps.\n\nSince food has life span 9, I have time, but I should start moving towards it.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,2) is positive, but I need to make sure that when I eat it, it's safe, especially regarding tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (6,2), not on tail, so probably not immediate issue.\n\nFirst, let's plan a path to the food.\n\nPossible path from (3,5) to (6,2).\n\nOne way: go down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), but (4,4) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied currently by index 7, but after moves.\n\nI need to simulate.\n\nSince I can go left or down or up, let's see which is better.\n\nIf I go left to (2,5), that might lead to dead end on left, since left is wall at x=0, and snake is there.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6), or D to (2,4), or L to (1,5), but (1,5) is tail, so can move there if no food, but (1,5) is tail, moving to it is ok if no food eaten.\n\nBut (1,5) is tail, so if I move to (1,5) on turn 50, since no food, tail moves, so head moves to (1,5), but that cell was tail, so after move, tail moves away, so it's ok, no collision.\n\nThen new head at (1,5), but (1,5) was tail, and it moves, so new positions.\n\nBut (1,5) is at x=1, y=5, which is not wall, but close to left wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or up, but it might be tight.\n\nBut the food is at (6,2), far away, so going left might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (3,6), then I can go right to (4,6), which is free.\n\n(4,6) is free, then to (5,6), but (5,6) is currently occupied, but after turn 50, if I move U, the body shifts.\n\nLet's simulate after moving U on turn 50.\n\nTurn 50: move U to (3,6)\n\nNew head at (3,6), new direction U.\n\nSnake positions: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)  tail at (1,4)\n\nNow, for turn 51, I can move from (3,6). Current direction U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, so cannot.\n\n- L to (2,6): is it free? Not occupied in new positions, not wall, so possible.\n\n- R to (4,6): free, possible.\n\n- D to (3,5): but (3,5) is now the first body segment, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, cannot move D because it's opposite to current direction U? Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so cannot move D anyway.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nIf I go R to (4,6), then new head (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,6), but (5,6) is now a body segment? In new positions, (5,6) is index 4, which is body.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6) on turn 51, new positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4) removed? No, when head moves to new cell, tail is removed only if no food.\n\nOn turn 51, no food eaten, so tail (1,4) removed, new tail is (1,3)? Let's list: after move to (4,6), new head (4,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, so positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) and (1,4) removed, so tail (1,3).\n\n(1,4) was tail, removed, so new tail is (1,3).\n\nNow, (5,6) is occupied, so if I want to go to (5,6) from (4,6), I can't because it's body.\n\nI can go down to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, currently index 3 in new positions? Positions: index 0: (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), etc. (4,5) is index 3, body, so cannot move to (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,6), I can only move to (4,7) but y=7 wall, or (3,6) body, or (5,6) body, or (4,5) body. (4,5) is at (4,5), which is down from (4,6).\n\n(4,6) neighbors: U (4,7) wall, D (4,5) body, L (3,6) body, R (5,6) body. All occupied or wall! So from (4,6), I have no move? That can't be right.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6) on turn 51, the cells around are all blocked.\n\n(4,6) has:\n\n- Up: (4,7) y=7 wall, cannot\n\n- Down: (4,5) - which is occupied by the body, specifically, in positions, (4,5) is index 3, so it's a body segment, not free, so cannot move there.\n\n- Left: (3,6) - index 1, body, not free\n\n- Right: (5,6) - index 5? Positions: 0:(4,6) head, 1:(3,6), 2:(3,5), 3:(4,5), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,6), etc. (5,6) is index 5, body, so not free.\n\nSo indeed, from (4,6), all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied by body, so I would be stuck and die on next turn if I go there.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,6) is a bad idea; it leads to a trap.\n\nOn turn 50, if I move U to (3,6), then on turn 51, I should not move to (4,6), but move left to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go down or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, for turn 50, moving U might be risky if I accidentally go to a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D on turn 50 to (3,4).\n\nTurn 50: move D to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), direction D.\n\nNew positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail (1,4), and (1,5) removed.\n\n(1,5) removed, so tail is (1,4).\n\nNow, for turn 51, from (3,4), current direction D, so can move D, L, R, not U (up, opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D to (3,3): but (3,3) is in positions, index 10 or something, in new positions: (3,4) head, (3,5) body1, (4,5) body2, ..., (3,3) is index 11? Positions: 0:(3,4), 1:(3,5), 2:(4,5), 3:(5,5), 4:(5,6), 5:(6,6), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,4), 8:(5,4), 9:(5,3), 10:(4,3), 11:(3,3), 12:(2,3), 13:(1,3), 14:(1,4) tail.\n\n(3,3) is index 11, body segment, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\n- L to (2,4): is it free? Not in positions, not wall, so possible.\n\n- R to (4,4): not occupied, not wall, possible.\n\n- U to (3,5): but (3,5) is body, occupied, and also cannot move U because opposite to current direction D.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,4) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I go R to (4,4), then new head (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,4) or other, but (5,4) is occupied currently, index 8.\n\nAfter move, positions shift.\n\nBut let's see if I can go towards food.\n\nFood at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, index 10.\n\nOr right to (5,4), which might be body.\n\nPerhaps moving D on turn 50 is better.\n\nBut let's consider moving L on turn 50 to (2,5).\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,5)\n\nNew head (2,5), direction L.\n\nNew positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail (1,4), (1,5) removed.\n\nTail was (1,5), removed, new tail (1,4).\n\nFor turn 51, from (2,5), current direction L, so can move L, U, D, not R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L to (1,5): but (1,5) is not occupied now? New positions have (1,4) and (1,3), but (1,5) is free? (1,5) was removed, so free. And it's not wall, so can move to (1,5).\n\n- U to (2,6): free, possible.\n\n- D to (2,4): free, possible.\n\n- R to (3,5): but (3,5) is body, occupied, and cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4).\n\nNow, if I go to (1,5), that is left, close to wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), but (1,4) is tail? Current tail is (1,4), so if I move to (1,4), it might be ok if no food.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nI need to get to (6,2) within 9 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 50, food available until turn 58.\n\nI have 8 moves to get there? From turn 50 to turn 58, 9 turns, but I can eat on turn 58 if I arrive then.\n\nTurn 50: food life span 9, so available on turns 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58. Disappear on turn 59.\n\nSo I can eat on any of these turns.\n\nHead at (3,5) on turn 50.\n\n(6,2) is 3 steps right and 3 steps down, but with obstacles.\n\nMinimum Manhattan distance is 6, but with snake body, it might take more turns.\n\nBut I can go via other paths.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go D to (3,4) on turn 50.\n\nThen on turn 51, from (3,4), I can go R to (4,4), as I said.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go D to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, currently.\n\nAfter turn 50 move D to (3,4), positions as above.\n\nTurn 51: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), direction R.\n\nNew positions: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4) removed, so new tail (1,3).\n\nTail was (1,4), removed, new tail (1,3).\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nNow (4,3) is index 11, body.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: current direction R, so can move R, U, D, not L (opposite).\n\n- R to (5,4): (5,4) is index 9 in positions? Index 9: (5,4), which is body, so occupied, cannot.\n\n- U to (4,5): (4,5) is index 3, body, occupied.\n\n- D to (4,3): (4,3) is index 11, body, occupied.\n\n- L to (3,4): (3,4) is index 1, body, occupied, and cannot move L anyway.\n\nAll moves blocked? U, D, L, R all occupied or invalid.\n\nR to (5,4) body, U to (4,5) body, D to (4,3) body, L to (3,4) body. So stuck again.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nOn turn 50, moving D to (3,4) then R to (4,4) leads to stuck on turn 51.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (3,6) then R to (4,6) also stuck.\n\nSo for turn 50, moving U or D might lead to problems if I move towards the body.\n\nThe safe move on turn 50 might be to move L to (2,5).\n\nThen from there, I have options.\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,5)\n\nNew head (2,5), direction L.\n\nPositions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\n(1,5) removed.\n\nFor turn 51, from (2,5), I can move L to (1,5), U to (2,6), or D to (2,4).\n\n(1,5) is free, as it was tail but removed.\n\n(2,6) free, (2,4) free.\n\nIf I move to (1,5), then I'm at left edge.\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), then I can explore top.\n\nBut food is at bottom right, so moving U might not help.\n\nMove D to (2,4) on turn 51.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go down or right, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nAnother idea: the snake body is currently blocking the right side, but as the snake moves, the tail moves, freeing up cells.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,5), and as I move, the tail will move down or something.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,4) after turn 50 move L.\n\nAfter turn 50 move L, positions have tail at (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 51, if I move, tail will move to (1,3) or something.\n\nBut to reach (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nPerhaps I can go down first to avoid the body.\n\nOn turn 50, move D to (3,4), but earlier when I moved R to (4,4), I got stuck, but on turn 51 from (3,4), instead of moving R, I can move L to (2,4).\n\nTurn 50: move D to (3,4)\n\nPositions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\nTurn 51: from (3,4), move L to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNew positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4) removed, new tail (1,3).\n\n(1,4) removed, tail (1,3).\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or R to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, and current direction L, so can move L, U, D, not R.\n\n- L to (1,4): (1,4) is free? Not occupied now, so possible.\n\n- U to (2,5): (2,5) is not in positions, free.\n\n- D to (2,3): (2,3) is in positions, index 12, body, occupied, so cannot.\n\n- R to (3,4): body, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,4) or U to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (2,5), then I'm at (2,5), which is similar to earlier.\n\nBut (2,5) was head position on turn 50, but now it's free.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I go U to (2,5), new head (2,5), then positions etc.\n\nBut I'm not getting closer to food.\n\nPerhaps I need to move in a way that the body uncoils or something.\n\nLet's look at the snake shape. The snake is coiled in the top-right area, with the tail on the left.\n\nFrom head at (3,5), it goes right to (4,5), (5,5), then up to (5,6), right to (6,6), down to (6,5), down to (6,4), left to (5,4), down to (5,3), left to (4,3), down to (3,3), left to (2,3), down to (1,3), right to (1,4), right to (1,5) tail.\n\nSo it's like the snake is filling the bottom-left, but the head is at (3,5), which is middle-top.\n\nTo get to (6,2), I can go down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), but (4,4) is free, but then from (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, but as the snake moves, (4,3) might be freed.\n\nFor example, on turn 50, move D to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 51, from (3,4), move R to (4,4) — but earlier I thought it leads to stuck, but let's see the positions after that.\n\nAfter turn 51 move R to (4,4):\n\nHead at (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,3) since (1,4) removed.\n\n(4,3) is index 11, body.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied, so cannot.\n\nU to (4,5), occupied.\n\nL to (3,4), occupied.\n\nR to (5,4), which is index 9, (5,4), occupied.\n\nAll blocked.\n\nSo that is a dead end.\n\nTherefore, moving D then R is not good.\n\nSimilarly, moving U then R is not good.\n\nSo the only safe initial move is to go L to (2,5) on turn 50.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (2,4) on turn 51.\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,5)\n\nPositions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\nTurn 51: from (2,5), move D to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), direction D.\n\nNew positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), tail (1,4) removed, new tail (1,3).\n\n(1,4) removed, tail (1,3).\n\nFrom (2,4), I can move D to (2,3), but (2,3) is index 12, body, occupied.\n\nU to (2,5), body, occupied.\n\nL to (1,4): (1,4) is free, not occupied.\n\nR to (3,4): free, not occupied.\n\nCurrent direction D, so can move D, L, R, not U.\n\n- D to (2,3): occupied, cannot\n\n- L to (1,4): free, possible\n\n- R to (3,4): free, possible\n\n- U to (2,5): occupied, cannot, and opposite direction.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I move R to (3,4), then I'm back to (3,4), which is similar to earlier position.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, or left to (2,4), body, or right to (4,4), free.\n\nBut let's not go that way.\n\nMove to (1,4) on turn 51.\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go down to (1,3) or up to (1,5), but (1,3) is tail, (1,5) free.\n\nBut I'm at left, far from food.\n\nTo reach food, I need to go right and down.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to free the tail area.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (6,2) has life span 9, so I have time, but the grid is small, and snake is long, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the center or open areas.\n\nLet's list free cells to see where I can go.\n\nFree cells: all cells not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nWall cells: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo occupied: those 15 cells.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,6), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) food, (6,3), and also (3,4), (2,4), etc.\n\nList all possible:\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (5,2)\n\nSo cells:\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) but (5,6) and (6,6) occupied, so free: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5) occupied, (2,5) not occupied? In positions, (2,5) not listed, so free, but head is at (3,5), so (2,5) free, (3,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied, (5,5) occupied, (6,5) occupied, so for y=5, only (2,5) free? (1,5) occupied, (2,5) free, (3,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied, (5,5) occupied, (6,5) occupied, so only (2,5) free at y=5.\n\ny=4: (1,4) occupied, (2,4) free, (3,4) free, (4,4) free, (5,4) occupied, (6,4) occupied, so free: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3) occupied, (2,3) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (6,3) free, so only (6,3) free?

Stuck on turn 52.\n\nSo this path also leads to stuck.\n\nI need to move in a way that the body is not blocking the way.\n\nPerhaps on turn 50, move U to (3,6), then on turn 51, move L to (2,6).\n\nTurn 50: move U to (3,6)\n\nPositions: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\nTurn 51: from (3,6), move L to

before.\n\nThen I can go down to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut still not towards food.\n\nTo reach food, I need to go down and right.\n\nSince the body is on the right, I should move down to the bottom to free space.\n\nFor example, on turn 50, move D to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 51, from (3,4), move L to (2,4).\n\nThen from (2,4), on turn 52, move D to (2,3), but (2,3) is body.\n\nAfter turn 51 move L to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,5), etc., tail (1,3)\n\nThen on turn 52, from (2,4), move D to (2,3) -- but (2,3) is body, occupied, so cannot.\n\nMove L to (1,4) or R to (3,4), but R to (3,4) body.\n\nSo only L to (1,4).\n\nThen from (1,4), move D to (1,3) or U to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) is tail, so moving to (1,3) is possible if no food.\n\nTurn 52: move to (1,4)\n\nNew head (1,4),

(1,3).\n\nThen at (1,3), which is bottom left.\n\nThen I can move right to (2,3) or down to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut the food is at (6,2), so I need to go right across the bottom.\n\nBut there are free cells at bottom.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), I can go to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), etc., to (6,2).\n\nBut it will take many turns, and food life span 9 turns, might be possible.\n\nTurn 50: head at (3,5)\n\nIf I move D to (3,4) on turn 50.\n\nThen on turn 51, move L to (2,4) on turn 51.\n\nThen on turn 52, move L to (1,4) on turn 52.\n\nThen on turn 53, move D to (1,3) on turn 53.\n\nThen on turn 54, move D to (1,2) on turn 54.\n\nThen on turn 55, move R to (2,2) on turn 55.\n\nThen on turn 56, move R to (3,2) on turn 56.\n\nThen on turn 57, move R to (4,2) on turn 57.\n\nThen on turn 58, move U to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so I cannot go to (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go down to (4,1) or up to (4,3), but (4,3) might be body or not.\n\nOr to (3,2), but I came from there.\n\nTo reach (6,2), from (4,2), I need to go to (5,2) but it's wall, so I have to go to (6,2) from (6,3) or (6,1).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), then right to (6,1), then up to (6,2).\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 58: from (4,2), move D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 59: from (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 60: from (5,1), move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 61: from (6,1), move U to (6,2)\n\nBut food life span: at turn 50, life span 9, so available until turn 58, gone at turn 59.\n\nTurn 58 is the last turn to eat.\n\nOn turn 58, if I am at (4,2), I cannot reach (6,2) in one move.\n\nDistance from (4,2) to (6,2) is 2 steps, but with wall at (5,2), I have to go around, which takes more turns.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (6,2) via (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) takes 3 moves, so on turn 59, but food gone.\n\nSo I cannot reach in time if I go this way.\n\nTherefore, going left and down is too slow.\n\nI need a faster route.\n\nPerhaps from (3,5), move L to (2,5) on turn 50, then on turn 51, move D to (2,4), on turn 52, move R to (3,4), on turn 53, move D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body.\n\nAfter some moves, (3,3) might be freed.\n\nLet's assume I do that.\n\nTurn 50: move L

tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), same as before, all moves blocked except possibly down, but (4,3) occupied.\n\nStuck.\n\nSo not good.\n\nPerhaps I can move to the top first.\n\nTurn 50: move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 51: move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 52: from (2,6), move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6)\n\nSay move D to (2,5)\n\nPositions after turn 51: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail (1,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,5) on turn 52: new head (2,5), positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4), free, etc.\n\nBut still not towards food.\n\nI think I have to accept that to reach the food, I need to go through the right side, but the body is there, so I need to move in a way that the body moves away.\n\nPerhaps the best is to move down to (3,4) on turn 50, then on turn 51, move to (2,4), then on turn 52, move to (1,4), then on turn 53, move to (1,3), then on turn 54, move to (1,2), then on turn 55, move to (2,2), turn 56 to (3,2), turn 57 to (4,2), but from (4,2) to (6,2) not direct, and on turn 58, if I am at (4,2), I can go to (4,1), but then to (6,1) on turn 59, food gone.\n\nSo not in time.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 56, I can go to (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) on turn 61, too late.\n\nSo I cannot reach the food in time if I go left and down.\n\nI need a shorter path.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I could move right, but I can't because occupied and opposite direction.\n\nBut after some moves, the cell might free.\n\nFor example, if I move L on turn 50, the body shifts, and (4,5) might be freed later.\n\nLet's assume I move L on turn 50 to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 51, move U to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 52, move R to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 50 move L: positions (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), etc.\n\nTurn 51: move U to (2,6)\n\nPositions: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.\n\nTurn 52: from (2,6), move R to (3,6)\n\nBut (3,6) is not occupied, free, so possible.\n\nNew head (3,6), direction R.\n\nPositions: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move R to (4,6), which is free, possible.\n\nMove to (4,6) on turn 53.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move D to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (4,7) wall.\n\nL to (3,6) body.\n\nR to (5,6) body.\n\nAll blocked again.\n\nSo still stuck.\n\nI think the only way is to move down and then down to the bottom row where there is space.\n\nFor example, on turn 50, move D to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 51, from (3,4), I can only move L to (2,4) or R to (4,4), but R to (4,4) leads to stuck, so move L to (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (2,4), move L to (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 53, from (1,4), move D to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 54, from (1,3), move D to (1,2).\n\nThen on turn 55, from (1,2), move R to (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 56, from (2,2), move R to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 57, from (3,2), move R to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 58, from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) or U to (4,3), but (4,3) is body or not.\n\nOn turn 58, positions depend on previous moves, but likely (4,3) is free by then, but to reach (6,2), I can't in one move.\n\nFrom (4,2), move R to (5,2) but wall, cannot.\n\nSo I have to go down to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (6,2) on turn 61, too late.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach the food in time with the current position.\n\nBut there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to (6,3) or something.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (6,2) can be accessed from (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is free, so if I can reach (6,3) by turn 58.\n\nFrom head (3,5) to (6,3) is 3 steps right and 2 steps down, but with body.\n\nFor example, turn 50: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 51: since from (3,4), I can move to (3,3) but occupied, or to (4,4) but risky.\n\nBut (4,4) is free, and if I move to (4,4) on turn 51, then from (4,4), on turn 52, I can move to (4,3) but occupied, or to (5,4) occupied, etc.\n\nUnless I move down from (4,4) to (4,3) when it's free.\n\nBut (4,3) is currently body, but as the snake moves, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,4) after turn 50 move D.\n\nThen on turn 51, if I move to (4,4), tail moves to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (4,4), I can move to (4,3) if it's free, but (4,3) is still body.\n\nIn positions after turn 51 move to (4,4): head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.\n\n(4,3) is index 11, body.\n\nOn turn 52, if I move D to (4,3), occupied, cannot.\n\nSo still not.\n\nI think I have to conclude that with the current snake position, it's difficult to reach the food in time, and I should focus on survival and avoid risks.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to eat this food; there might be other food later, but currently only one food given.\n\nThe state has only one food, so I should try to eat it if possible.\n\nBut from the above, it seems hard to reach within 8 moves.\n\nManhattan distance from (3,5) to (6,2) is |3-6| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6, so minimum 6 moves, but with obstacles and body, it might be 7 or 8.\n\nTurn 50 to turn 58 is 8 moves ( turns 50 to 57 for moves, turn 58 for eating? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 50: I move from current position to new position.\n\nAfter move, if I am on food, I eat it.\n\nSo on turn 50, I can eat if I move to food cell.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nSo from turn 50 to turn 58, I can eat on any of these 9 turns by moving to (6,2).\n\nNumber of moves from turn 50 to turn 58: on turn 50, I make a move to a new cell; if that cell is food, I eat on turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 51, I move to a cell, if food, eat, and so on, up to turn 58.\n\nSo I have 9 opportunities to eat.\n\nBut the head starts at (3,5) on turn 50 before move.\n\nAfter move on turn 50, I am at a new cell.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at (6,2) is after min 6 moves, so turn 55 or later.\n\nFor example, if I move right when possible, but I can't immediately.\n\nSuppose on turn 50, I move D to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 51, I move R to (4,4) -- but I can't because on turn 51 from (3,4), I can move to (4,4) only if it's free, which it is, but then from there I get stuck, but for reaching food, if I move to (4,4) on turn 51, then on turn 52, I am stuck, so I can't move further.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nMove L on turn 50 to (2,5), then on turn 51, move D to (2,4), turn 52, move R to (3,4), turn 53, move R to (4,4), then stuck, not closer to (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,4), (6,2) is far.\n\nSo I think it's not feasible to reach the food within the life span.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore this food and focus on survival, find a safe path to stay alive for future food.\n\nSo for turn 50, move to a safe cell that allows future movement.\n\nFrom head (3,5), possible safe moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or L to (2,5).\n\nBut U to (3,6) might lead to dead end if I go right, but if I go left, it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nL to (2,5) seems safer.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,6) or (2,4) or (1,5).\n\nLet's choose to move L to (2,5) on turn 50.\n\nThen for turn 51, from (2,5), move D to (2,4).\n\nThen for turn 52, from (2,4), move L to (1,4).\n\nThen for turn 53, from (1,4), move D to (1,3).\n\nThen for turn 54, from (1,3), move D to (1,2).\n\nThen I am in the bottom left, with space to move.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), I can go to (1,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to output a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence starting from turn 50.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I can plan a short sequence.\n\nAlso, the food might not be the only thing; I need to survive.\n\nSo for turn 50: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 51: move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 52: move L to (1,4) -- on turn 52 from (2,4), after move to (2,4) on turn 51, positions have (2,4) head, so on turn 52, from (2,4), I can move L to (1,4) or R to (3,4), etc., but L to (1,4) is safe.\n\nThen turn 53: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 54: from (1,3), move D to (1,2)\n\nThen from (1,2), on turn 55, I can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should be a sequence of actions for the turns.\n\nProbably for a few turns.\n\nSince the food is hard to reach, I'll go for safety.\n\nSo let's say:\n\nTurn 50: move L\n\nTurn 51: move D\n\nTurn 52: move L\n\nTurn 53: move D\n\nTurn 54: move D\n\nBut on turn 54, from (1,3) to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to ensure no collision.\n\nAlso, after these moves, the snake is in the bottom left, with more space.\n\nFor example, after turn 54, head at (1,2), then I can move right or down.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 54 or so.\n\nSince the turn number is given, I can provide for turns 50 to 54 or 55.\n\nBut let's see the head direction for each move.\n\nTurn 50: current direction L, move L, so new direction L.\n\nTurn 51: from (2,5), direction L, move D, so new direction D.\n\nTurn 52: from (2,4), direction D, move L, so new direction L.\n\nTurn 53: from (1,4), direction L, move D, new direction D.\n\nTurn 54: from (1,3), direction D, move D to (1,2), new direction D.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify further for now.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output this sequence.\n\nBut I should consider if there's a way to get the food, but I think it's not possible, so I'll go with safety.\n\nPerhaps on turn 50, move D to (3,4), then turn 51 move L to (2,4), then turn 52 move D to (2,3), but (2,3) may be occupied, but after moves, on turn 52 from (2,4), after move to (2,4) on turn 51, positions have (2,4) head, body (3,4), (3,5), etc., (2,3) is body, so I cannot move to (2,3) on turn 52.\n\nSo only to (1,4) or (3,4), but (3,4) body.\n\nSo must go to (1,4).\n\nSo my sequence is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I must carefully plan the snake's movements over multiple turns. The current state (turn 50) shows the snake in a coiled position with the head at (3,5) moving left. The positive food at (6,2) has a life span of 9 turns (available until turn 58), but reaching it is challenging due to the snake's body blocking direct paths and the internal obstacle at (5,2). After evaluating possible paths, it is determined that reaching the food within the life span is not feasible without high risk of collision or dead ends. The Manhattan distance is 6, but body segments and obstacles force detours, requiring at least 8-9 moves—exceeding the safe window. Therefore, the priority shifts to long-term survival: avoiding risks, freeing space by moving toward open areas (bottom-left), and positioning for future food spawns.\n\n#### Key Constraints and Risks:\n- **Current head direction (L)**: On turn 50, cannot move right (opposite direction).\n- **Collision risks**: Moving into body segments (except the tail) or walls is fatal. The body blocks immediate right/down movements from (3,5).\n- **Food access**: (6,2) can only be approached from (6,3) or (6,1), but both are hard to reach quickly.\n- **Grid size and snake length**: 35 playable cells (6x6 grid minus obstacle), snake occupies 15, leaving 20 free. Moving to open areas (e.g., bottom-left) prevents trapping.\n- **Turn simulation**: Moves are planned for 5+ turns (turns 50–54), ensuring each action is safe and maintains options.\n\n#### Path Chosen:\n- **Turn 50**: Move left (L) to (2,5)—avoids body, no collision, heads toward open left side.\n- **Turn 51**: Move down (D) to (2,4)—continues toward bottom-left free cells.\n- **Turn 52**: Move left (L) to (1,4)—frees space, no immediate threats.\n- **Turn 53**: Move down (D) to (1,3)—enters bottom row with more space.\n- **Turn 54**: Move down (D) to (1,2)—positions in bottom-left corner, maximizing mobility for future turns (e.g., can move to (1,1), (2,2), or right).\n\nThis sequence prioritizes safety:\n- No collisions: All target cells are free (not body or walls) when moved to.\n- Survives beyond 5 turns: By turn 54, the snake is in a less congested area with 10+ free cells nearby.\n- Food not pursued: Attempting (6,2) risks dead ends (e.g., moving right/down from (3,5) leads to body traps by turn 51–52). Survival allows scoring future food.\n\n#### Simulated Positions (for verification):\n- **Turn 50 (start)**: Head at (3,5), direction L.\n  - Move L to (2,5). New head: (2,5). Tail (1,5) removed. New tail: (1,4).\n  - Positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]\n- **Turn 51**: Head at (2,5), direction L (from turn 50 move).\n  - Move D to (2,4). New head: (2,4). Direction: D. Tail (1,4) removed. New tail: (1,3).\n  - Positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]\n- **Turn 52**: Head at (2,4), direction D.\n  - Move L to (1,4). New head: (1,4). Direction: L. Tail (1,3) removed. New tail: (2,3).\n  - Positions: [(1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n- **Turn 53**: Head at (1,4), direction L.\n  - Move D to (1,3). New head: (1,3). Direction: D. Tail (2,3) removed. New tail: (3,3).\n  - Positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n- **Turn 54**: Head at (1,3), direction D.\n  - Move D to (1,2). New head: (1,2). Direction: D. Tail (3,3) removed. New tail: (4,3).\n  - Positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nBy turn 54, the snake is at (1,2) with direction down, surrounded by free cells (e.g., (1,1), (2,2)), enabling safe future moves. The food at (6,2) expires on turn 59, but reaching it is not attempted due to low probability and high risk.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 51: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 52: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 53: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 54: D (down)\n}",

        "score": 14,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 51.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions are given as a list: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]. The head is at (2,5), and the tail is at (1,4). The snake has 15 segments.\n\nThe head direction is \"L\", which means it's moving left. So, from (2,5), moving left would go to (1,5), but I need to check if that's possible.\n\nFood is at (6,2) with a life span of 8 and a value of 1. Since the value is +1, it's positive food. Life span of 8 means it will disappear after 8 turns, including the current turn. So, from turn 51, it will be gone by turn 59 if not eaten.\n\nNow, I need to plan the next 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a simple grid.\n\nThe grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) tail.\n\n(1,4) is the tail? Let's list in order:\n\nIndex 0: (2,5) head\n\nIndex 1: (3,5)\n\nIndex 2: (4,5)\n\nIndex 3: (5,5)\n\nIndex 4: (5,6)\n\nIndex 5: (6,6)\n\nIndex 6: (6,5)\n\nIndex 7: (6,4)\n\nIndex 8: (5,4)\n\nIndex 9: (5,3)\n\nIndex 10: (4,3)\n\nIndex 11: (3,3)\n\nIndex 12: (2,3)\n\nIndex 13: (1,3)\n\nIndex 14: (1,4) tail\n\nSo tail is at (1,4).\n\nCurrent head direction is left, so it was moving left to (2,5) from previous position. Since head is at (2,5) and direction is L, that means it came from the right, so previous head was at (3,5), which matches the body.\n\nNow, possible moves from current head (2,5):\n\n- Up (U): (2,6)\n\n- Down (D): (2,4)\n\n- Left (L): (1,5)\n\n- Right (R): (3,5)\n\nBut current direction is left, so I cannot instantly reverse to right. Instantly reverse means on the next turn, I can't go opposite to current direction. So since I'm moving left, I cannot move right on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L (not R).\n\nNow, I need to check for collisions or walls.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo for (2,6): y=6, which is not y=7 or y=0, x=2 not wall, and not (5,2), so should be ok, but need to check if occupied by snake body.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\n(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nNow, (2,6): is it occupied? From the list, no. (5,6) is occupied, but (2,6) is free? Let's see: positions with y=6: (5,6) and (6,6), no (2,6). So (2,6) is empty.\n\n(2,4): not in list, should be free.\n\n(1,5): not in list. x=1,y=5. Snake has (1,3) and (1,4), but not (1,5), so free.\n\n(3,5) is occupied, but we can't move right anyway.\n\nNow, also, when moving, if I move to a cell, it should not be occupied by body except possibly the tail, because tail moves.\n\nBut in this case, for (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), none are in the body except (3,5) which is not a candidate.\n\n(1,5) is free, etc.\n\nBut I need to consider the food at (6,2).\n\nFirst, let's think about immediate actions.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (1,4). Head is at (2,5), which is adjacent? Let's see distance.\n\n(2,5) to (1,4): Δx=1, Δy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent in terms of up/down/left/right. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so same row or column, adjacent cell.\n\nSo (2,5) and (1,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (2,5) and (1,5) left, (2,6) up, (2,4) down, (3,5) right.\n\nTail is at (1,4), which is down-left from head, but not directly adjacent via a single move.\n\nSo no immediate tail reward danger.\n\nFood is at (6,2), which is far away. Head at (2,5), food at (6,2), so Δx=4, Δy=3, so not close.\n\nLife span 8, so it has 8 turns including current, meaning it will disappear after 8 more turns, so from turn 51, it will be gone at turn 59. Turn 51 is current, so life span decreases each turn, so at turn 51, life_span=8, turn 52:7, ..., turn 58:1, turn 59:0 and disappears.\n\nWe are on turn 51, so if not eaten by turn 58, it's gone.\n\nTo eat it, I need to get to (6,2) within 8 turns.\n\nBut it's not urgent yet; I have time.\n\nNow, let's look at the snake's position. The snake is coiled around.\n\nFrom head (2,5), moving left to (1,5) might be possible, but let's see the grid.\n\nI should map out the grid.\n\nLet me make a simple text grid. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=7: top, y=0 bottom? Usually y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but from the positions, let's assume y=0 is bottom or top? In the snake positions, (2,5) to (1,4), y decreasing, but direction is left, so it's moving horizontally.\n\nPerhaps I should list all occupied cells.\n\nOccupied cells:\n\n- (1,3), (1,4)  // tail area\n\n- (2,3), (2,5)  // (2,4) free? y=3 and y=5 occupied, y=4 not\n\n- (3,3), (3,5)  // (3,4) free?\n\n- (4,3), (4,5)  // (4,4) free?\n\n- (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)  // (5,2) obstacle? (5,2) is obstacle, not snake\n\n(5,2) is wall/obstacle, not snake.\n\n- (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)  // (6,3) free? etc.\n\nAlso (5,4), (5,5), etc.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,5), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (4,4), (3,6) might be free, etc.\n\nBut walls: borders are walls, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, (x,0) and (x,7) for all x are walls, so not movable.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, food at (6,2), which is near the obstacle.\n\n(6,2) is not wall, since x=6 not border, y=2 not border, and not (5,2), so it should be accessible, but I need to reach it.\n\nNow, from head at (2,5), I can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), or L to (1,5).\n\nIf I move L to (1,5), that might be towards the left wall.\n\nx=0 is wall, so (1,5) is safe, but close to border.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6): y=6, not y=7, so ok.\n\n(2,4): ok.\n\nNow, I need to plan a path to the food or other food, but there's only one food now.\n\nOnly one food given: (6,2,8,1)\n\nLife span 8, so I have until turn 58 to eat it.\n\nBut I should consider if there are other foods, but in this state, only one is listed.\n\nThe food positions are given, and here only one.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's think about the snake's body. The snake has many segments, 15, so it's long, which makes it harder to maneuver without colliding.\n\nAlso, the area around (5,3) to (6,6) seems filled, but there are free spaces.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nLabel x from 0 to 7 left to right, y from 0 to 7 bottom to top? In coordinates, (x,y), but in grid, usually (0,0) bottom left or top left? I think it doesn't matter, but for adjacency, it's fine.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom left, x right, y up.\n\nSo:\n\ny=7: top row\n\ny=0: bottom row\n\nx=0: left column\n\nx=7: right column\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)  // which is x=2,y=5\n\nBody: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n\n(1,4) is tail.\n\nNow, food at (6,2)\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (1,5), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (4,4), (3,6), (4,6), (1,2), etc., many are free.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be tight.\n\nNow, from head (2,5), options:\n\n- U: (2,6) - free? Let's check: snake has (5,6) and (6,6), not (2,6). Walls? x=2,y=6, not border, not obstacle, so free. Move to (2,6).\n\n- D: (2,4) - not in snake positions, not wall, free.\n\n- L: (1,5) - not in snake, x=1>0, not wall, free.\n\nR is not possible due to no reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food, which it won't immediately since food is at (6,2).\n\nSo if no food eaten, snake moves forward, tail moves, so length same.\n\nFor example, if I move to (2,6), then new head (2,6), body starts from old head (2,5), then (3,5), etc., and tail (1,4) moves off, so new tail is (1,3)? Let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (2,5) head, index1: (3,5), ..., index13: (1,3), index14: (1,4) tail.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n\nSo if move to new cell, say (2,6), then new positions: head at (2,6), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)  // (1,4) is removed, so tail is (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (2,4), new head (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (1,3), and tail (1,4) removed, so tail at (1,3).\n\nIf move left to (1,5), new head (1,5), body: (2,5), (3,5), ..., (1,3), and tail (1,4) removed, tail at (1,3).\n\nNow, (1,3) is still part of body.\n\nI need to get to the food at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right, with obstacle at (5,2).\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go to x=6,y=2.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down or right, but right is not possible now.\n\nFirst, I should head towards the food.\n\nBut the area around (5,2) to (6,4) has snake body.\n\nFor example, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are occupied, (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) occupied.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so (6,2) is only accessible from left, up, or down, but down is y=1, which might be wall? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (6,2) can be accessed from (6,1), (6,3), (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so only (6,1) or (6,3) or (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so only (6,1) or (6,3).\n\n(6,1) is below, (6,3) is above.\n\n(6,3) is currently free? Snake has (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is free, but y=1, not wall.\n\nSo to reach (6,2), I can come from (6,3) down or (6,1) up.\n\nBut (6,3) is above, (6,1) below.\n\nNow, from current position, I need to navigate there.\n\nBut there might be risks of collision.\n\nAlso, life span 8, so I have time.\n\nBut I should plan a path.\n\nSince the snake is long, I might need to uncoil or something.\n\nLet's see the current shape.\n\nFrom head (2,5), body goes right to (3,5),(4,5),(5,5), then up to (5,6), right to (6,6), down to (6,5), down to (6,4), left to (5,4), down to (5,3)? (5,4) to (5,3) is down, then left to (4,3), left to (3,3), left to (2,3), left to (1,3), then up to (1,4)? (1,3) to (1,4) is up.\n\n(1,3) to (1,4) is +y, so up.\n\nBut tail is (1,4), and before that (1,3).\n\nThe area from (2,3) to (5,3) and (5,4) to (6,4) is occupied, but there is a free space at (3,4), (4,4), etc.\n\n(3,4) is free, (4,4) is free.\n\nAlso, (2,4) is free, (2,6) free, (1,5) free.\n\nI should consider moving to open areas to avoid trapping myself.\n\nBut I need to eat the food eventually.\n\nSince the food is at (6,2) with life 8, I can take a few turns to position myself.\n\nLet's think about the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction is L, left.\n\nIf I move left to (1,5), then I'm at (1,5), which is near the left wall.\n\nThen from there, I can move up, down, or left, but left is x=0, wall, so not possible.\n\nSo from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), or R to (2,5), but (2,5) is now body, so I can't move there except if it's tail, but it's not tail yet.\n\nAfter moving to (1,5), the body is at (2,5), so if I move right back to (2,5), that would be colliding with body, which is deadly.\n\nSo from (1,5), if I move, I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is currently tail, but at that time, when I move, the tail might have moved.\n\nSuppose at turn 51, I move L to (1,5).\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,3), (1,3)  // tail is (1,3), since (1,4) removed.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.\n\nNow, at turn 52, from (1,5), direction is L, since I moved left.\n\nNow possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), or R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, so collision if I go there. L to (0,5) but x=0 wall.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), or D to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is now free? In new positions, (1,4) is not occupied; it was tail but removed. Occupied are (1,5), (2,5), etc., and (1,3), but not (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is empty now.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) might be empty.\n\ny=6, (1,6) not in positions, not wall.\n\nSo from (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I go D to (1,4), then new head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), etc., tail (1,3) removed, so new tail is (2,3)? Positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (1,3) but (1,3) is removed? When head moves to (1,4), the body is (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (3,3), (2,3), and (1,3) is removed, so tail is (2,3).\n\n(1,3) was index 13, removed, so body from index1 to index13 minus the last, but let's not complicate.\n\nAfter move to (1,4), positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail.\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nThen from there, I can move, but I'm near the bottom left.\n\nBut this might not be productive for reaching (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I go up to (1,6), I might go towards top left.\n\nBut food is at bottom right.\n\nSo moving left might not be the best for reaching food.\n\nPerhaps I should move down or up to start heading right.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I move down to (2,4), then new head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), ..., (1,3), tail (1,4) removed, so tail at (1,3).\n\nNow at (2,4), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction after move: I moved down, so direction D.\n\nCannot move up instantly.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,3), but (2,3) is body, currently occupied by snake, so if I go there, collision.\n\nL to (1,4), which is now free? After move, positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail? Tail is (1,3).\n\n(2,3) is occupied, (1,4) is not occupied, (3,4) not occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (2,4), moves:\n\n- U to (2,5): but (2,5) is body, collision, cannot.\n\n- D to (2,3): (2,3) is body, collision.\n\n- L to (1,4): (1,4) is free, not occupied.\n\n- R to (3,4): (3,4) is free, not in snake positions.\n\nAnd since I moved down, I cannot move up, but U is not possible anyway.\n\nSo I can move L to (1,4) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I move R to (3,4), that might be better for heading right.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up from initial position.\n\nInitial position (2,5), move U to (2,6).\n\nNew head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail. (1,4) removed.\n\nAt (2,6), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nDirection after move U, so cannot move down instantly.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, collision.\n\n- D to (2,5): (2,5) is body, collision.\n\n- L to (1,6): (1,6) free, not wall.\n\n- R to (3,6): (3,6) free? Not in positions.\n\n(3,6) not occupied.\n\nSo can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nMoving R to (3,6) might be good for going right.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go east and south.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving down to (2,4) or right to (3,5) but right not possible now, or up to (2,6) then right later.\n\nBut moving down to (2,4) seems better because it's closer to y=2.\n\ny=5 to y=2, so down.\n\nSimilarly, x=2 to x=6, so right.\n\nBut I can't move right now, so I need to change direction.\n\nSo let's consider moving down to (2,4) at turn 51.\n\nThen at turn 52, from (2,4), as above, I can move R to (3,4) or L to (1,4).\n\nMoving R to (3,4) is better for heading east.\n\nSo plan: turn 51: D to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 52: from (2,4), move R to (3,4)\n\nNow at (3,4), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, R, but not L instantly.\n\nNow, (3,4) is free, good.\n\nThen I can move to (4,4), which is also free.\n\nThen to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied? Current snake has (4,3) occupied, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 51: move D to (2,4)\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.\n\n(1,4) removed.\n\nTurn 52: move R to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail. (1,3) removed.\n\nTail is (2,3).\n\nAt (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nD to (3,3), (3,3) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (4,4), which is free.\n\nL to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,4).\n\nNo choice, must move right to (4,4).\n\nTurn 53: move R to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail. (2,3) removed.\n\nTail at (3,3).\n\nAt (4,4), direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,5): (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) is body, occupied? In positions, (5,4) is occupied.\n\nBody has (5,4), yes, index 10 in original? In new positions, (5,4) is there.\n\n(5,4) is occupied, so if I move R to (5,4), collision.\n\nL to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, collision.\n\nAll directions blocked? U, D, R, L all lead to occupied cells or walls?\n\n(4,4) to U (4,5): occupied\n\nD (4,3): occupied\n\nL (3,4): occupied\n\nR (5,4): occupied\n\nOh no! Dead end. If I go to (4,4), I'm surrounded and can't move without colliding.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nAt turn 53, after moving to (4,4), the cells around are all occupied except possibly others, but in this case, (4,4) has neighbors all body.\n\n(4,4) up is (4,5), which is body.\n\nDown is (4,3), body.\n\nLeft (3,4), body.\n\nRight (5,4), body.\n\nYes, all occupied. So if I go there, next turn I die.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,4) at turn 51 leads to death at turn 53.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up first.\n\nTurn 51: move U to (2,6)\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail. (1,4) removed.\n\nTurn 52: from (2,6), as before, can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nU to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5) body, not possible.\n\nSo L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay I move R to (3,6) to go right.\n\nTurn 52: move R to (3,6)\n\nNew head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail. (1,3) removed? Tail was (1,3), removed, so positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail.\n\nAt (3,6), direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (3,7): y=7 wall.\n\nD to (3,5): (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (4,6): (4,6) free? Not in positions, should be free.\n\nL to (2,6): body, collision.\n\nSo only possible R to (4,6).\n\nTurn 53: move R to (4,6)\n\nNew head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail. (2,3) removed.\n\nAt (4,6), direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,7): wall.\n\nD to (4,5): (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR to (5,6): (5,6) is body, occupied.\n\nL to (3,6): body, occupied.\n\nAll directions blocked again! U wall, D body, R body, L body. Death.\n\nMove to (1,6) instead at turn 52.\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 52 move L to (1,6)\n\nNew head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), etc., tail (2,3)\n\nThen at (1,6), can move U, D, R, not L (since moved left? Direction: moved from (2,6) left to (1,6), so direction L, cannot move R instantly.\n\nMoves: U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) free, R to (2,6) body, L to (0,6) wall.\n\nSo only D to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 53 move D to (1,5)\n\nThen from there, similar issue, but I'm stuck in corner.\n\nNot good for reaching food.\n\nTherefore, moving up or down from initial position leads to dead ends because the snake is coiled and I'm heading into the body.\n\nThe only other option is to move left to (1,5) at turn 51.\n\nTurn 51: move L to (1,5)\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail. (1,4) removed.\n\nAt (1,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 52: can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), as before.\n\nSay move D to (1,4) to go down.\n\nTurn 52: move D to (1,4)\n\nNew head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail. (1,3) removed.\n\nAt (1,4), direction D.\n\nCan move D to (1,3), but (1,3) is not occupied? Positions have (1,4) head, (1,5) body, then (2,5), etc., and (2,3), (3,3), so (1,3) is free now? Not in the list, so free.\n\nU to (1,5) body, collision.\n\nL to (0,4) wall.\n\nR to (2,4) free?

Tail was (5,3), removed, so tail at (5,4).\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail.\n\nAt (4,3), direction D.\n\nCan move U to (4,4): body, occupied.\n\nD to (4,2): (4,2) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nL to (3,3): (3,3) free.\n\nR to (5,3): (5,3) is body? In positions, (5,3) is not there; tail is (5,4), so (5,3) free, but (5,2) is obstacle, so (5,3) is accessible.\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, so (5,3) can be moved to.\n\nMoves:\n\nU to (4,4) body, collision.\n\nD to (4,2) free.\n\nL to (3,3) free.\n\nR to (5,3) free.\n\nAnd since moved down, cannot move up, but U not possible anyway.\n\nSo I can move D, L, or R.\n\nNow, (4,2) is down, (3,3) left, (5,3) right.\n\nI need to go to (6,2), so moving right to (5,3) might be good.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, or (5,4) but body.\n\nLet's continue.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (5,3) for example.\n\nBut (5,3) is now free, yes.\n\nMove to (5,3).\n\nNew head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), etc., tail (5,4) removed? Positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) tail. (5,4) removed.\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nAt (5,3), direction R (since moved right from (4,3)? From (4,3) to (5,3) is right, so direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (5,4): (5,4) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,2): but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, collision.\n\nR to (6,3): (6,3) free? Not occupied.\n\nL to (4,3): body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move R to (6,3).\n\nTurn 55: move R to (6,3)\n\nNew head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail. (6,4) removed.\n\nTail at (6,5).\n\nAt (6,3), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (6,4): (6,4) not occupied? In positions, (6,4) is not there, free.\n\nD to (6,2): (6,2) is the food! But let's see.\n\nL to (5,3): body, occupied.\n\nR to (7,3): x=7 wall.\n\nU to (6,4) free.\n\nD to (6,2) free.\n\nAnd since moved right, cannot move left.\n\nSo can move U or D.\n\n(6,2) is the food, so I can eat it by moving down.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nMoving to (6,2) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n\nValue +1, length increases.\n\nBut after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nLife span: on turn 55, food has life span decreasing.\n\nCurrent turn 51, food life span 8.\n\nTurn 51: life 8\n\nTurn 52: 7\n\n...\n\nTurn 55: life 8-4=4? From 51 to 55 is 4 turns later, so at turn 55, food life span is 8-4=4, since each turn decreases.\n\nAt turn t, life span is given, decreases each turn.\n\nTurn 51: life=8\n\nAfter turn 51, if not eaten, life=7 at turn 52 start.\n\nGenerally, at the beginning of turn, food has remaining life.\n\nWhen snake moves to food cell, it eats it.\n\nAt turn 55, if I move to (6,2), I eat it.\n\nBut is (6,2) safe? No body or wall, yes.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so positions: head at (6,2), body includes previous head (6,3), and so on, and tail stays, so length increases.\n\nThen from there, I need to move away.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nIn this scenario, I moved left at turn 51, then down at turn 52? No.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 51: L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 52: D to (1,4)? Earlier I said turn 52 move R to (2,4), but from (1,5), I moved R to (2,4) at turn 52.\n\nThen turn 53: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 54: D to (4,3)? At turn 54, from (4,4) I moved D to (4,3), but in the sequence above, I was at (4,4) turn 53? Let's list the turns properly.\n\nTurn 51: move L to (1,5)  // head to (1,5)\n\nTurn 52: from (1,5), move R to (2,4)? No, from (1,5) to (2,4) is not adjacent; (1,5) to (2,4) is diagonal, not possible. Moves are only U/D/L/R, so to adjacent cells.\n\n(1,5) to (2,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, so invalid move.\n\nI think I made a mistake.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves are only to (1,6) up, (1,4) down, or (2,5) right, but (2,5) is body, so only (1,6) or (1,4).\n\nI cannot move directly to (2,4) from (1,5).\n\nIn turn 52, from (1,5), I have to move to (1,6) or (1,4).\n\nSay I move D to (1,4).\n\nThen at (1,4), I can move to (1,3) or (2,4) or (0,4) wall, or (1,5) body.\n\nSo to (1,3) or (2,4).\n\nMove to (2,4) to go right.\n\nThen from (2,4), as before, I can move to (2,3) or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut earlier when I went to (4,4), I got stuck.\n\nIn the left move path, it took many turns to get to the food area.\n\nTurn 51: L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 52: D to (1,4)  // for example\n\nNew positions after turn 52: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3)?

(6,4) removed.\n\nAt (6,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 59: from (6,3), move D to (6,2) to eat food, or U to (6,4)\n\nFood at (6,2) with life span: at turn 58, food life was 8 at turn 51, turn 52:7, 53:6, 54:5, 55:4, 56:3, 57:2, 58:1, turn 59:0 disappears, so on turn 59, if I move to (6,2), it might be gone or can I eat it?\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including the current turn when it exists.\n\nAt turn 51, life=8, so it exists on turns 51 to 58, and disappears at turn 59.\n\nSo on turn 59, it is gone, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 58 is the last chance to eat.\n\nAt turn 58, I am at (6,3), and I can move to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 58, from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 58, I can eat the food.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 58 eat.\n\nBut in the path, I had to go through (1,4) etc., which is long.\n\nPerhaps there is a shorter path.\n\nBut from initial position, if I could go directly.\n\nAnother idea: from head (2,5), move down to (2,4), but earlier that led to death at (4,4).\n\nUnless at turn 52, from (2,4), I move L to (1,4) instead of R.\n\nTurn 51: D to (2,4)\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail.

(1,3) removed.\n\nAt (1,4), direction L.\n\nCan move U to (1,5), D to (1,3), R to (2,4) body, L to (0,4) wall.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,5) for example.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut it will take more turns to reach food.\n\nPerhaps the best is to go left first and then down and right.\n\nBut in the first left move path, I can reach food at turn 58.\n\nLife span 8, from turn 51 to 58 is 8 turns, turn 51 to 58 is 8 turns, but eating at turn 58 is within life span.\n\nTurn 51: food exists, life=8\n\nTurn 58: life=1, can be eaten.\n\nTurn 59: gone.\n\nSo eating at turn 58 is possible.\n\nBut can I eat earlier?\n\nFor example, from initial, move down to (2,4) is dangerous, but if I move down and then left, it might be ok, but still slow.\n\nAnother option: since there is space at (2,6), move up to (2,6), then to (3,6), but earlier I had a dead end at (4,6).\n\nBut from (4,6), I was stuck, but if I go to (3,6) then to (3,7) not possible, or down.\n\nFrom (3,6), after turn 52 at (3,6), I could move down to (3,5) but (3,5) body, not possible.\n\nOnly right to (4,6), then stuck.\n\nSo not good.\n\nPerhaps I need to move in a way that the tail moves and frees space.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,4), and it will move as the snake moves.\n\nIn the initial position, if I move down to (2,4), then at turn 52, if I move down to (2,3), but (2,3) is body, collision.\n\nFrom (2,4), only possible moves are L to (1,4) or R to (3,4), but R to (3,4) then to (4,4) death.\n\nL to (1,4) is possible.\n\nBut then from (1,4), I can go to (1,3) or (1,5) or (2,4) body.\n\nSay move to (1,3).\n\nTurn 51: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 52: L to (1,4)  // from (2,4) to (1,4) is left\n\nNew head (1,4), body (2,4), (2,5), etc., tail (1,3)? Positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail. (1,3) removed, so tail at (2,3).\n\nAt (1,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 53: move D to (1,3)  // (1,3) free\n\nNew head (1,3), body (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail. (2,3) removed.\n\nAt (1,3), direction D.\n\nCan move D to (1,2), U to (1,4) body, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) free.\n\nSo move R to (2,3) or D to (1,2).\n\nBut (2,3) is now free.\n\nMove R to (2,3).\n\nThen continue, but I'm at bottom left, far from food.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the first path with left then down then right might be the way to go.\n\nTo save turns, from turn 51, move left to (1,5), then at turn 52, move down to (1,4), then at turn 53, move right to (2,4), then at turn 54, move right to (3,4), then at turn 55, move right to (4,4), but at (4,4) I have to move down to (4,3) at turn 56, then to (5,3) at turn 57, to (6,3) at turn 58, then to (6,2) at turn 58 to eat? At turn 58, from (6,3) to (6,2) down.\n\nBut at turn 58, I move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 58 is when I reach (6,3), then move to (6,2) on the same turn? No.\n\nTurn 58: from (6,3) move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) is the food cell.\n\nIn terms of turns: from start turn 51.\n\nAfter move on turn 51, I am at new position for turn 52.\n\nLet's list the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn 51 action: move to new cell for turn 52 start.\n\nIn the state, current turn t1=51, snake positions are at the beginning of turn 51.\n\nWhen I choose action for turn 51, I move to a new cell, and that becomes the head for turn 52.\n\nSimilarly, food life span decreases after the turn.\n\nFor the food, at turn 51, it has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns, so it exists for 8 more turns including current, so from turn 51 to 58 it exists, gone at turn 59.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be at (6,2) on or before turn 58.\n\nIn the path:\n\n- Turn 51: move L to (1,5)  // at end of turn 51, head at (1,5)\n\n- Turn 52: move D to (1,4)  // head at (1,4)\n\n- Turn 53: move R to (2,4)  // head at (2,4)\n\n- Turn 54: move R to (3,4)  // head at (3,4)\n\n- Turn 55: move R to (4,4)  // head at (4,4)\n\n- Turn 56: move D to (4,3)  // head at (4,3)\n\n- Turn 57: move R to (5,3)  // head at (5,3)\n\n- Turn 58: move R to (6,3)  // head at (6,3)\n\nAt turn 58, I am at (6,3), and I can move to (6,2) on turn 58 to eat, but turn 58 action: from (6,3) move D to (6,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut turn 58 is the last turn food exists, so I can eat it on turn 58.\n\nIn the action for turn 58, I move to (6,2), which has food, so I eat it.\n\nThen for turn 59, etc.\n\nBut in this sequence, on turn 58, I eat.\n\nCan I eat earlier?\n\nFor example, if from (4,3) at turn 56, I move directly to (5,3) but that's one step, then to (6,3) turn 57, then to (6,2) turn 58.\n\nSame as above.\n\nFrom (5,3) at turn 57, I can move to (6,3) or, at (5,3), I can only move to (6,3), as before.\n\nNo faster.\n\nFrom initial, if I move down to (2,4) at turn 51, then to (3,4) at turn 52, but from (2,4) to (3,4) is possible only if I move right, but at turn 51, if I move down to (2,4), then at turn 52, I can move to (3,4) if I choose R, but from (2,4), moving R to (3,4) is possible, as in the first dead end path, but then at (3,4), I can move to (4,4), then stuck.\n\nUnless at (3,4), I move down to (3,3) instead.\n\nTurn 51: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 52: R to (3,4)  // from (2,4) to (3,4) right\n\nNew head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail. (1,3) removed? Tail was (1,3), removed, so tail at (2,3).\n\nAt (3,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 53: can move D to (3,3) or R to (4,4) or U to (3,5) body, L to (2,4) body.\n\nU and L body, so D or R.\n\nIf move D to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), body (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) but (3,3) is new head, so body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), ..., (4,3), and tail (2,3)? Positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (2,3) tail. (3,3) was occupied, but now head, so the body is from old positions except tail removed.\n\nAfter move to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), then body (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (2,3)? (2,3) was the tail, but not removed? When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed only if no food eaten.\n\nNo food, so tail (2,3) is removed, so body from (3,4) to (4,3), and (2,3) removed, so tail at (4,3)? List: head (3,3), body (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), and since (2,3) removed, tail is (4,3).\n\nAt (3,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nCan move U to (3,4): body, occupied.\n\nD to (3,2): free.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) free now? Not occupied.\n\nR to (4,3): (4,3) body, occupied.\n\nSo can move D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n\nThen I can go down to (3,2), then to (4,2), etc., but (4,2) is free, then to (5,2) obstacle, not possible, or to (4,1), etc., but not directly to (6,2).\n\nThis might take longer or be risky.\n\nSo the first path seems reasonable.\n\nTo eat the food, I need to be at (6,3) or (6,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is below, might be harder to reach.\n\nSo from (6,3) move down to (6,2).\n\nIn the sequence, with move left at turn 51, I can reach (6,3) at turn 58 and eat at turn 58.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but not necessarily until eating, but at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"maximize score\", but for output, it says \"Answer Format\" with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"...\" I think I need to provide a sequence for several turns.\n\nAlso, for the food, since I can eat it at turn 58, but that is turn 51+7, so for 5 turns, I might not reach it.\n\nBut I need to plan to survive and reach it.\n\nPerhaps for the output, I can provide actions for 5 turns: turn 51 to 55 or something.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,2) might be under the body? Is it under the snake?\n\nCurrent snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are occupied, (6,2) is not occupied, so it's not under the snake. It's free.\n\nSo can be eaten directly.\n\nNow for the action sequence.\n\nI think moving left at turn 51 is a good start to avoid the dead end.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nBut to provide 5 turns, I can do:\n\nTurn 51: L (to (1,5))\n\nThen turn 52: from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4) or U to (1,6). Moving down is better to go towards food.\n\ny=4 is lower than y=6, and food at y=2, so down.\n\nThen turn 53: from (1,4), move R to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 54: from (2,4), move R to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 55: from (3,4), move R to (4,4) or D to (3,3), but to go right, to (4,4)\n\nBut at (4,4), I need to move down next, but for 5 turns, up to turn 55.\n\nThen later to (4,3), etc.\n\nSince at (3,4), I can move to (3,3) down, but that might not be towards food.\n\nStick to the path.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 51: L\n\nThen for turn 52, from (1,5), move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 53: from (1,4), move R to (2,4)  // since (2,4) is adjacent and free\n\n(1,4) to (2,4) is right, yes.\n\nTurn 54: from (2,4), move R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nBut at (4,4), as before, it is surrounded, but in turn 55, I am moving to (4,4), then on turn 56 I must move down to (4,3), but for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 55 or more.\n\nThe output should be for multiple turns, but not specified how many; I think at least 5.\n\nPerhaps provide 5 actions: turn 51 to 55.\n\nThen at turn 55, I am at (4,4), and I need to move down to (4,3) on turn 56, but not in the sequence.\n\nTo avoid the dead end, from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3) instead of right to (4,4).\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4), move D to (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (3,2) or (4,3), etc., but (4,3) might be body or not.\n\nIn earlier state, at that point, it might be free.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nI think for survival, moving left first is safe.\n\nAlso, for the food, with life span 8, I have time.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide the sequence starting with left.\n\nTurn 51: L\n\nThen since at (1,5), I move down to (1,4) on turn 52.\n\nThen right to (2,4) on turn 53.\n\nThen right to (3,4) on turn 54.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move right to (4,4) or down to (3,3).\n\nMoving down to (3,3) might be better to avoid being trapped.\n\nAt (3,3), it could be free.\n\nIn the state after turn 54, when at (3,4), the positions depend.\n\nAssume we go to (3,3) on turn 55.\n\nBut (3,3) might be occupied initially, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nTo be safe, I'll provide the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 51: L\n\nTurn 52: D  // from (1,5) to (1,4)\n\nTurn 53: R  // from (1,4) to (2,4)\n\nTurn 54: R  // from (2,4) to (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: R  // from (3,4) to (4,4)\n\nThen for turn 56, I need to move D to (4,3), but not in the output.\n\nSince the output can have multiple, I can do up to turn 56 or stop at 55.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action ...\" with ..., so I can do as many as I want, but for this, 5 turns should be fine.\n\nTurn 51 to 55.\n\nBut at turn 55, if I am at (4,4), and it is surrounded, but when I arrive at (4,4) on turn 55, the body might have moved, so it might not be surrounded anymore.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (4,4) on turn 55, the tail has moved, so some cells are free.\n\nFor example, in the path to food, when I reach (4,4), it is not surrounded because the tail moved.\n\nIn the first successful path to food, when I was at (4,4), I could move down to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nSo it should be ok.\n\nI think for the output, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 51: L\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: R\n\nThen later to D and so on.\n\nBut to be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (6,2) while ensuring long-term survival, a sequence of moves is planned over 5+ turns. The food has a life span of 8, meaning it must be eaten by turn 58 (since it disappears at turn 59). The initial move avoids dead ends and positions the snake to navigate safely toward the food. The snake is currently moving left, so reverse moves (right) are prohibited on the next turn. The plan prioritizes moving away from the coiled body to open spaces, then heading right and down toward (6,2). Key risks are avoided, such as not entering cells that lead to immediate body collisions.\n\n### Analysis of the Path\n- **Turn 51 (start):** Head at (2,5), direction left. Moving left to (1,5) avoids the risk of heading into a dead end (as moving down or up led to traps in earlier simulations). (1,5) is safe and free.\n- **Turn 52:** Head at (1,5), direction left. Moving down to (1,4) progresses south toward the food (y=2) and avoids the top-left corner.\n- **Turn 53:** Head at (1,4), direction down. Moving right to (2,4) starts the eastward path to (6,2) and enters a free cell.\n- **Turn 54:** Head at (2,4), direction right. Moving right to (3,4) continues toward the food and stays in open space.\n- **Turn 55:** Head at (3,4), direction right. Moving right to (4,4) is safe; although (4,4) may seem surrounded, tail movement frees space (e.g., (4,3) becomes accessible next turn).\n- **Beyond 5 turns:** The sequence continues to (4,3) on turn 56, (5,3) on turn 57, (6,3) on turn 58, and (6,2) on turn 58 to eat the food safely. This path ensures the food is eaten by turn 58 within its life span.\n\n### Action Sequence for Turns 51 to 55\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns and sets up the snake to reach the food by turn 58. Moves are chosen to avoid walls, obstacles, body collisions, and instant reversals.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: L (left)  \nTurn 52: D (down)  \nTurn 53: R (right)  \nTurn 54: R (right)  \nTurn 55: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nCurrent turn is 52. Snake positions: head is at (1,5), direction is L (left). The body segments are listed in order: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]. So the head is at (1,5), and the tail is at (1,3).\n\nFood items:\n- (6,2) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n- (6,5) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n\nSince the head direction is L (left), from (1,5), moving left would go to (0,5), but x=0 is a wall, so I can't move left. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so moving left from (1,5) to (0,5) is invalid because it's a wall.\n\nPossible moves from current position (1,5) with head direction L:\n\n- Left: (0,5) is wall, not allowed.\n- Right: (2,5) but that's the position of the second segment. Since the snake is moving, when I move, the tail will also move, so I can move to a cell that is currently occupied only if it's the tail and the tail moves away. But (2,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment. The tail is at (1,3).\n\nLet me list the snake positions in order:\n\nIndex 0: (1,5) head\n\nIndex 1: (2,5)\n\nIndex 2: (3,5)\n\nIndex 3: (4,5)\n\nIndex 4: (5,5)\n\nIndex 5: (5,6)\n\nIndex 6: (6,6)\n\nIndex 7: (6,5)\n\nIndex 8: (6,4)\n\nIndex 9: (5,4)\n\nIndex 10: (5,3)\n\nIndex 11: (4,3)\n\nIndex 12: (3,3)\n\nIndex 13: (2,3)\n\nIndex 14: (1,3) tail\n\nNow, from head at (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (1,6) - y=6 is within bounds? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable. (1,6) is a possible cell.\n\n- Down: (1,4) - also possible.\n\n- Left: (0,5) - x=0 is wall, not allowed.\n\n- Right: (2,5) - but this is currently occupied by the snake body at index 1. When I move, if I go to (2,5), which is a body segment, it might cause a collision, but since the snake moves, the segment at (2,5) will move to where the head was, I think. Let's think carefully.\n\nStandard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a new position, the segment that was at position 1 moves to where the head was, and so on, down to the tail.\n\nBut if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's a collision unless that cell is the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is index 1, which is not the tail. The tail is at (1,3). So moving to (2,5) would cause a collision because after movement, the head is at (2,5), but the segment that was there is now moving to (1,5), so at that instant, no two parts occupy the same cell except during movement, but typically in snake, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated, it's ok only if it's the tail.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment is only safe if that segment is the tail, because the tail moves away.\n\nHere, (2,5) is occupied by index 1, which is not the tail; it's the second segment. So if I move right to (2,5), it would be a collision because after move, head is at (2,5) and the body segment that was there is now at (1,5), but at the new positions, (2,5) is head, and other segments are elsewhere, but since (2,5) was occupied before and I'm moving there, it might be considered collision before movement or after? I think we need to think of the state after movement.\n\nAfter movement: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position.\n\nSo if I move right to (2,5):\n\n- New head position: (2,5)\n\n- Then segment 1 (was at (2,5)) moves to (1,5) (previous head)\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (3,5)) moves to (2,5)? No.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n\n- Seg1: (2,5)\n\n- Seg2: (3,5)\n\n- ...\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5):\n\n- New head: (2,5)\n\n- Seg1 moves to where head was: (1,5)\n\n- Seg2 moves to where seg1 was: (2,5) but (2,5) is now the head, so seg2 would move to (2,5)? That can't be; positions must be unique.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell, say new_head, then the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second to the old first position, and so on, up to the tail moving to the position of the second-to-last segment.\n\nIn terms of the list, the new positions are: [new_head] + [old_head] + [old positions except the last one]? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nAfter one move, the new snake positions are:\n\n- Head: new_position\n\n- The rest: the previous positions from index 0 to len-2, but shifted.\n\nFor example, if snake was [A, B, C, D] and head moves to X, then new snake is [X, A, B, C] if no food eaten, or [X, A, B, C, D] if food eaten and growth.\n\nBut in this case, since we're moving, no food eaten yet.\n\nSo for current snake: positions P0 to P14, 15 segments.\n\nIf head moves to a new cell Q, then new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P13]\n\nBecause the tail P14 is left behind.\n\nNow, for collision: if Q is in the list [P0, P1, ..., P14], except if Q == P14 (tail) and we move there, it might be ok because P14 will be gone after move.\n\nThe rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this context, \"move forward\" means the tail moves to the new position, so the cell is vacated.\n\nBut when you move to the tail cell, after move, the head is there, and the tail has moved to where the second-to-last was, so no collision.\n\nFor other body cells, if you move to a cell occupied by a non-tail segment, after move, that segment has moved to a different position, but at the time of move, it might be considered collision.\n\nI think it's safer to assume that moving to any cell that is currently occupied by a body segment except the tail is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to a wall is deadly.\n\nBack to (1,5):\n\n- Left to (0,5): wall, invalid.\n\n- Right to (2,5): currently occupied by seg1, which is not tail, so collision. Invalid.\n\n- Up to (1,6): let's check if occupied. Current positions: (1,5) head, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). Is (1,6) in this list? No, and y=6 is not wall, x=1 between 1 and 6, so (1,6) is free.\n\n- Down to (1,4): similarly, not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nAlso, walls: internal obstacle at (5,2), but (1,4) and (1,6) are not that.\n\nSo possible moves from current position: Up or Down.\n\nHead direction is L, but since we can't move left, and right is invalid, only up or down are possible, but we have to consider the no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is L (left). Moving up or down are not opposite to left, since opposite would be right, which we can't do anyway.\n\nNo instant reverse means we cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. But current direction is L, so we cannot move R on this turn, but R is invalid anyway. For up and down, they are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo for turn 52, I can move U or D.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n\nFood available: (6,2) with life span 7, meaning it disappears after turn 52 + 7 = turn 59? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 52, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 58? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it disappears when countdown reaches 0. If at turn t, life span L, then after L turns, it's gone, meaning on turn t+L it is not there.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone on turn t+L.\n\nHere, turn 52, food at (6,2) life span 7, so it is present from turn 52 to 52+6=58? Countdown: at turn 52, countdown=7, after turn 52, countdown=6, ..., after turn 58, countdown=0, so on turn 59 it is gone. Similarly, it can be eaten on turns 52 to 58 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 10, present from turn 52 to 52+9=61, gone on turn 62.\n\nNow, both foods are at x=6, y=2 and y=5.\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (6,5), which is index 7.\n\n(6,5) is a body segment, not the head.\n\nBut food at (6,5) is present, with value 1.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nHere, (6,5) has food, and it's currently occupied by the snake body at index 7.\n\nTo eat it, the snake must move away from that cell, and then later head moves onto it.\n\nBut since it's under the body, it's not accessible immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is free, I think.\n\nNow, current position: head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nI can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nI need to plan multiple moves ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, walls at borders and internal at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody: from (2,5) to (4,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), tail (1,3)\n\nSo the snake is coiled; from (1,5) to (5,5) right, then up to (5,6), right to (6,6), down to (6,5), down to (6,4), left to (5,4), down to (5,3), left to (4,3), etc to (1,3).\n\nNow, food at (6,2) and (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied.\n\n(6,2) is below, near the obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (6,2) is adjacent.\n\nNow, life span: (6,2) must be eaten by turn 58, (6,5) by turn 61.\n\nBut (6,5) is under the body, so we need to vacate it first.\n\nTo eat (6,5), we need to move the segment off it, then head can move in.\n\nCurrently, (6,5) is occupied by index 7.\n\nThe snake is moving, so depending on movement, the segments shift.\n\nBut to free (6,5), we need that when the head moves, the tail moves, but specifically, the cell (6,5) needs to be vacated.\n\nSince the snake is a chain, moving the snake will cause positions to change.\n\nFor example, if we move in a way that the segment at (6,5) moves away, then (6,5) is free, and if head moves there, we can eat the food.\n\nBut we have to be careful not to collide.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,3), head at (1,5), so not adjacent; (1,5) and (1,3) are two cells apart vertically.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(1,5) and (1,4) would be adjacent, but (1,4) is not tail; tail is (1,3), which is two down.\n\n(1,5) to (1,4) down, then (1,3) further down, so not adjacent.\n\nNow, back to turn 52 moves.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (1,6)\n\nThen new head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail was (1,3) but since no food eaten, tail moves to (2,3)? Let's list new positions after move U:\n\n- Head moves to (1,6)\n\n- Then segments: seg1 moves to old head (1,5)\n\n- seg2 moves to old seg1 (2,5)\n\n- seg3 to (3,5)\n\n- seg4 to (4,5)\n\n- seg5 to (5,5)\n\n- seg6 to (5,6)  // (5,6) was index 5\n\n- seg7 to (6,6)  // index 6\n\n- seg8 to (6,5)  // index 7\n\n- seg9 to (6,4)  // index 8\n\n- seg10 to (5,4)  // index 9\n\n- seg11 to (5,3)  // index 10\n\n- seg12 to (4,3)  // index 11\n\n- seg13 to (3,3)  // index 12\n\n- seg14 to (2,3)  // index 13\n\nAnd tail index 14 (1,3) is dropped, so new tail is at (2,3), which was index 13.\n\nNew positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nFrom here, head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) but (1,5) is now the second segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nL to (0,6) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6) - is it free? Current positions: (1,6) head, (1,5), (2,5), etc. (2,6) not in positions, and not wall, so free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 53: move R to (2,6)\n\nNew head (2,6), then positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] tail at (3,3)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5) - (2,5) is now the fourth segment? New positions: index 0 (2,6), 1 (1,6), 2 (1,5), 3 (2,5), etc. So (2,5) is index 3, not tail, so moving to (2,5) would be collision.\n\nL to (1,6) - (1,6) is index 1, not tail, collision.\n\nR to (3,6) - not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSo only R possible to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 54: move R to (3,6)\n\nNew head (3,6), positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] tail at (4,3)\n\nHead at (3,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) - (3,5) is index 5? Positions: 0 (3,6), 1 (2,6), 2 (1,6), 3 (1,5), 4 (2,5), 5 (3,5), so (3,5) is index 5, not tail, collision if move there.\n\nL to (2,6) index 1, collision.\n\nR to (4,6) not in positions, free.\n\nSo move R to (4,6).\n\nTurn 55: move R to (4,6)\n\nNew head (4,6), positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)] tail at (5,3)\n\nHead at (4,6), direction R.\n\nMoves: U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5) - (4,5) is index 7? Positions: 0 (4,6), 1 (3,6), 2 (2,6), 3 (1,6), 4 (1,5), 5 (2,5), 6 (3,5), 7 (4,5), so index 7, not tail, collision.\n\nL to (3,6) index 1, collision.\n\nR to (5,6) - (5,6) is index 9? Positions: 8 (5,5), 9 (5,6), so (5,6) is index 9, not tail, collision? But (5,6) is occupied, and not tail, so moving to (5,6) would be collision.\n\nWhat about (5,5)? But we're at (4,6), moving to (5,6) is right, (5,5) is down.\n\nFrom (4,6), R to (5,6) is possible, but (5,6) is occupied by index 9 in new positions? After move to (4,6), positions include (5,6) at index 9.\n\nBut when moving to (5,6), it is currently occupied, so unless it's tail, it's collision.\n\nHere, tail is at (5,3), so (5,6) is not tail.\n\nMoreover, after moving head to (5,6), the segment that was there would move, but it's not the tail.\n\nSo moving to (5,6) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, D to (4,5) is occupied.\n\nL and U invalid.\n\nBut (4,6) to (5,6) is R, but occupied.\n\nWhat about down to (4,5)? Same issue.\n\nSo from (4,6), no possible moves? That can't be right.\n\nPositions after turn 55: head at (4,6), segments: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nSo cells around (4,6): up (4,7) wall, down (4,5) occupied by index 7, left (3,6) occupied by index 1, right (5,6) occupied by index 9. All occupied or wall, so indeed, if we go this path, we get stuck at turn 55.\n\nBut this is only if we move U on turn 52.\n\nIf we move U on turn 52, we end up trapped at (4,6) on turn 55 with no moves.\n\nThat's bad, so moving U is dangerous; it leads to a dead end quickly.\n\nNow, the other option: on turn 52, move D to (1,4).\n\nCurrent position (1,5), move D to (1,4).\n\nNew head (1,4), direction D.\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) and tail (1,3) dropped, so new tail at (2,3).\n\nPositions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nHead at (1,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,5) - but (1,5) is now index 1, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nD to (1,3) - (1,3) is not in positions? Current positions have (1,4), (1,5), etc, but (1,3) was tail and dropped, so (1,3) is free? Let's see: after move, positions are from (1,4) to (2,3), so (1,3) is not occupied. y=3 is within bounds, not wall. So (1,3) is free.\n\nL to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,4) - not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n\nNow, (1,3) is below, and R to (2,4) is right.\n\nI need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied, but in the new positions, after move D, (6,5) is still occupied by index 8? New positions: index 0 (1,4), 1 (1,5), 2 (2,5), 3 (3,5), 4 (4,5), 5 (5,5), 6 (5,6), 7 (6,6), 8 (6,5), 9 (6,4), 10 (5,4), 11 (5,3), 12 (4,3), 13 (3,3), 14 (2,3)\n\nSo (6,5) is index 8, occupied.\n\n(6,2) is free.\n\nTo get to (6,2), we need to go down and right.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (5,2), so (6,2) is accessible from (6,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so only from (6,3), (6,1) invalid, or (7,2) wall, so only (6,3) above or (5,2) invalid, so (6,2) can only be accessed from (6,3) or (6,1) but y=1 not wall? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6, so (6,1) is bottom row.\n\n(6,2) can be accessed from (6,1), (6,3), (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, so only (6,1) and (6,3).\n\n(5,2) is wall, so no access from left.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) can be accessed from (6,4), (6,6), (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) has food under it, so we need to free it first.\n\nBack to turn 52 after moving D to (1,4).\n\nNow turn 53: from (1,4), I can move D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n\nIf I move D to (1,3):\n\nNew head (1,3), direction D.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) and tail (2,3) dropped, new tail at (3,3).\n\nPositions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nHead at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,4) - (1,4) is index 1, not tail, collision.\n\nD to (1,2) - not in positions, not wall (y=2 ok), so free.\n\nL to (0,3) wall.\n\nR to (2,3) - (2,3) is not in positions? Positions have (1,3), (1,4), ..., (3,3) at end. (3,3) is index 14, tail? Index 14 is (3,3), which is tail.\n\n(2,3) is not in the list; let's list all: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (2,3) is not occupied, free.\n\n(1,2) is also free.\n\nSo moves: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) is free, yes.\n\nIf I move to (1,2), then head at (1,2), which is bottom row.\n\nThen I can go right, but it might be a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (2,3) from (1,3).\n\nBut let's consider the other choice at turn 53.\n\nAt turn 53, from (1,4), I could move R to (2,4) instead of D.\n\nMove R to (2,4):\n\nNew head (2,4), direction R (since moved right from (1,4), but previous direction was D, but no instant reverse issue since not opposite.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)  // tail (2,3) is kept? No, after move, positions: [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] tail at (3,3)\n\nHead at (2,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,5) - (2,5) is index 3, not tail, collision.\n\nD to (2,3) - (2,3) not in positions? Positions have (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc, (3,3), but (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (1,4) index 1, not tail, collision.\n\nR to (3,4) - not in positions, free.\n\nSo moves: D to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is free, (3,4) free.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to go towards the food.\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right, (6,5) at middle right.\n\nAlso, (6,5) food is under the body, so we need to free it.\n\nIn the current state after turn 52 move D, (6,5) is occupied.\n\nThe segment at (6,5) is part of the body.\n\nTo free (6,5), we need the snake to move in a way that this cell is vacated.\n\nSince the snake is long, moving the tail will free cells.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,3) after turn 52 move.\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nSpecifically for (6,5), it will be freed when the segment that is there moves away.\n\nBut it depends on the path we take.\n\nPerhaps I should aim to go to the right side to access the foods.\n\nBut with the internal wall at (5,2), the area around (6,2) is constrained.\n\n(6,2) can be accessed from (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is on the bottom wall, y=1.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) from (6,4), (6,6), (5,5), etc.\n\nNow, life span: (6,2) must be eaten by turn 58, so within 6 turns from now (turn 52 to 58, 6 turns: 53,54,55,56,57,58).\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) by turn 61, more time.\n\nBut (6,5) is under body, so it might take time to free it.\n\nFirst, let's see if moving D on turn 52 is better.\n\nTurn 52: move D to (1,4)\n\nThen at turn 53, I have choices: move D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n\nIf I move D to (1,3), then at turn 54, from (1,3), I can move D to (1,2) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I move to (1,2), then head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nThen I can move R to (1,3)? From (1,2), U to (1,3) but (1,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (1,2) on turn 54 from (1,3):\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (1,3), positions as above.\n\nMove D to (1,2): new head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to (3,3), but tail was (3,3), dropped, new positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] tail at (4,3)\n\nHead at (1,2), direction D.\n\nMoves: U to (1,3) - (1,3) is index 1, not tail, collision.\n\nD to (1,1) - not wall, y=1 ok, not occupied, free.\n\nL to (0,2) wall.\n\nR to (2,2) - not occupied, free.\n\nSo moves D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,1), bottom left, then I can only go right or up, but up to (1,2) occupied.\n\nFrom (1,1), U to (1,2) occupied, L wall, D wall (y=0), so only R to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), etc. But this is going down and left, away from the food at (6,2), which is bottom right.\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2, so to reach it, I need to go right and down.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I move R to (2,2), then I can start moving right.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nAt turn 53 from (1,4), instead of moving D, I can move R to (2,4).\n\nThen from (2,4), I can move D to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is free, (3,4) free.\n\nIf I move R to (3,4), then head at (3,4), direction R.\n\nThen I can continue right.\n\nLet's think about freeing the food at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by a body segment. In the snake positions, it's at index 8 after turn 52 move.\n\nAs the snake moves, this segment will move to a new position when the head moves.\n\nFor example, if we move the head, each segment shifts.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves away.\n\nSince the snake is a chain, the position (6,5) will be occupied until that particular segment moves or the tail moves past it.\n\nBut it's easier to simulate.\n\nNotice that the snake has a loop: from (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6) to (6,5) to (6,4) to (5,4) to (5,3), etc.\n\n(6,5) is part of this.\n\nIf we can \"uncoil\" the snake, we can free that cell.\n\nBut with the food on it, we need to free it to eat.\n\nPerhaps moving down on turn 52 is better to avoid the dead end like in the up move case.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (6,5) has a long life span, 10 turns, so we have time.\n\n(6,2) has only 7 turns, so it's more urgent.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is near the obstacle.\n\nTo reach (6,2), from current position (1,5), moving down to (1,4) then right might be a way.\n\nFrom (1,4), move R to (2,4), then to (3,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut there's the body in the way.\n\nLet's list free cells to move.\n\nThe grid has walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nFree cells: all except snake positions and walls.\n\nBut snake positions change.\n\nInitially, at turn 52, snake occupies 15 cells, grid is 6x6=36 cells, so 21 free cells.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,5), but (6,5) occupied.\n\nI should aim to go to (6,2) first since it has shorter life.\n\nPath to (6,2): from (1,5), moving D to (1,4), then R to (2,4), then R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by snake?

Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 52, life span=7, present.\n\nAfter turn 52, countdown=6, so on turn 53, countdown=6, ..., on turn 58, countdown=1, present, after turn 58, countdown=0, so on turn 59 not present.\n\nSo to eat, must be on or before turn 58.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 59 I move to (6,2), but on turn 59, food is gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nTurn 58: from (6,3) move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 57: at (6,3), move to (6,2) on turn 58? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 57 move to (6,3), it is turn 57.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (6,3), move D to (6,2) to eat.\n\nAt turn 58, countdown for (6,2): started at turn 52 with 7, turn 53:6,54:5,55:4,56:3,57:2,58:1, so on turn 58, countdown=1, still present, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nSo eaten on turn 58.\n\nNow, for the other food at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has life span 10, so from turn 52, countdown=10, present until turn 61.\n\nIn the current state, (6,5) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it might be freed.\n\nAfter eating at (6,2), the snake is at (6,2), head, and positions include (6,5) as a body segment.\n\nSpecifically, after turn 58, positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail? After growth, positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ] so (6,5) is the last segment, tail.\n\nBut (6,5) has food under it? Food is at (6,5), and it's occupied by the tail.\n\nTo eat it, the tail must move away, and head move onto it.\n\nBut if the tail moves away, the food is exposed, then head can eat.\n\nBut in this case, (6,5) is tail, so when the snake moves, the tail will leave (6,5), and if no one moves there, the food is there, then head can move to it.\n\nBut tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nHere, after moving, the tail may not be adjacent.\n\nFor example, from current position after eating (6,2), head at (6,2), tail at (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen when we move, tail moves to (6,6) or something.\n\nBut let's not worry now.\n\nBack to turn 52 decision.\n\nOn turn 52, moving D allows us to reach and eat (6,2) by turn 58.\n\nIf I move U, I get stuck earlier.\n\nSo for turn 52, move D is better.\n\nBut in the move sequence, I assumed moving R consistently, but on turn 56 I moved D to (4,3) to avoid collision.\n\nIn the sequence, it worked.\n\nFor the food at (6,5), we can try to eat it later.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for turn 52.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", and in the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since we need to think ahead, perhaps output a few turns.\n\nThe answer format says: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since we thought ahead, perhaps until we eat or something.\n\nBut for now, on turn 52, move D.\n\nThen on turn 53, from (1,4), I can move R to (2,4) as before.\n\nThen turn 54 R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 55 R to (4,4)\n\nThen on turn 56, from (4,4), I moved D to (4,3), but from (4,4), I could have moved D directly if possible, but earlier I had to move D because U and R were blocked.\n\nIn turn 55, at (4,4), only D to (4,3) was possible.\n\nThen turn 57 R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58 move to (6,2) or from (5,3) to (6,3) then to (6,2).\n\nIn turn 57 I moved to (6,3), then turn 58 to (6,2).\n\nBut from (5,3), on turn 57, I could move directly to (6,2)? From (5,3), to (6,2) is diagonal, not adjacent, must move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2) wall, or U to (5,4), so not directly to (6,2).\n\nSo must go to (6,3) first.\n\nThen from (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output from turn 52.\n\nAlso, for turn 52, move D.\n\nBut is there a way to get to (6,2) faster? From (1,5) to (6,2), the Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8, so minimum 8 moves, but with obstacles and body, it might be more.\n\nIn my sequence, turn 52 to 58 is 6 moves? From turn 52 move to (1,4), not directly closer.\n\nTurn 52: at (1,5), move to (1,4), now at (1,4)\n\nTurn 53: to (2,4)\n\nTurn 54: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 56: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 57: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58: to (6,3)\n\nTurn 59: to (6,2) but on turn 59 food gone.\n\nProblem: turn 58 to (6,3), then on turn 58, I can move to (6,2) if I do it in the move.\n\nTurn 58: from (6,3) move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 57: at (6,3) on turn 57.\n\nTurn 57 action: move to (6,3), so at end of turn 57, head at (6,3).\n\nThen turn 58: move from (6,3) to (6,2), which is down.\n\nAnd (6,2) has food with countdown=1 on turn 58, so eat it.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, turn 56: from (4,4) move to (4,3)? Turn 55: at (4,4), turn 56 move to (4,3)\n\nBut from (4,4), moving to (4,3) is down, then to (5,3) right, etc.\n\nI could from (4,4) move to (4,3) or other, but only D was possible.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 53, from (1,4), I moved R, but I could move D to (1,3), but that might be slower.\n\nFor example, move D to (1,3) on turn 53, then to (1,2) or (2,3), then it takes more turns to go right.\n\nSo moving R is faster.\n\nTherefore, for turn 52, action D.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as per the plan.\n\nBut I need to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the food at (6,5), we can plan to eat it later, but since the answer might not need all, perhaps output until we eat or for 5 turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format shows multiple turns, so I'll output from turn 52 to turn 58 or so.\n\nNow, about the head direction: on turn 52, current direction L, but we move D, so new direction is D.\n\nThen on turn 53, from (1,4), move R, so direction R.\n\nEtc.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: when moving, we cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nFor example, after moving D, direction is D, so on next turn, cannot move U, but in this case, from (1,4), moving R is fine.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 52: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 53: from (1,4), move R to (2,4)  // direction now R\n\nTurn 54: from (2,4), move R to (3,4)  // direction R\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)  // direction R\n\nTurn 56: from (4,4), move D to (4,3)  // direction D (down)\n\nNow, after move to (4,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 57: from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4) occupied, D to (4,2) free, L to (3,3) free, R to (5,3) free.\n\nI moved R to (5,3) to go right.\n\nBut move R to (5,3), direction R (right)\n\nThen turn 58: from (5,3), move R to (6,3)  // direction R\n\nThen turn 59: from (6,3), move D to (6,2) to eat, but on turn 59 food gone, so must move on turn 58.\n\nAt turn 58, from (6,3), move D to (6,2).\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 58, we are at (6,3) after turn 58 action? Let's clarify turn numbering.\n\nAt start of turn 52, we decide action for turn 52.\n\nAfter action, state updates.\n\nThen turn 53, etc.\n\nSo after turn 52 action, head at (1,4)\n\nAfter turn 53 action, head at (2,4)\n\nAfter turn 54, at (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 55, at (4,4)\n\nAfter turn 56, at (4,3)\n\nAfter turn 57, at (5,3) if move R\n\nAfter turn 57 action, head at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 58: from (5,3), I need to move to (6,2), but (6,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are (5,4), (5,2) wall, (6,3), (4,3).\n\nSo I must move to (6,3) first or (5,4), but (5,4) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 57, positions: head at (5,3), positions as earlier when at (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), move R to (6,3) on turn 58.\n\nThen after turn 58 action, head at (6,3)\n\nThen turn 59: from (6,3) move D to (6,2), but on turn 59, (6,2) food gone.\n\nBut on turn 58, from (5,3), I can move to (6,3), which is turn 58 action, then on turn 59 move to (6,2), but too late.\n\nTo eat on turn 58, I need to be at (6,3) on turn 58 to move to (6,2), but I am at (5,3) on turn 58 start.\n\nAt start of turn 58, I am at (5,3), so I move to (6,3) on turn 58, arriving at (6,3) end of turn 58.\n\nThen for (6,2), I need to move on turn 59, but food gone.\n\nMistake in timing.\n\nLife span: at turn 52, (6,2) life span 7, so it can be eaten on turns 52 to 58 inclusive? Countdown: turn 52:7, after turn:6; turn 53:6, after:5; ... turn 58:1, after:0; so on turn 58, before action, countdown=1, present, after eating, it is consumed.\n\nIf I move to (6,2) on turn 58, I can eat it.\n\nBut on turn 58, I am at (5,3), so I can only move to (6,3) or other, not directly to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), I cannot reach (6,2) in one move.\n\nSo I need to be at (6,3) on turn 57 to move to (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 57, I am at (4,3) or where.\n\nTurn 56: at (4,3) after turn 56 action? Turn 56 action is move to (4,3), so after turn 56, head at (4,3).\n\nThen turn 57: from (4,3), move to (5,3) or (6,3)? From (4,3) to (6,3) not adjacent, must go to (5,3) first.\n\nMove to (5,3) on turn 57.\n\nAfter turn 57, at (5,3).\n\nTurn 58: from (5,3) move to (6,3)  // to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 59: move to (6,2) but food gone.\n\nI need to reach (6,3) earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 57, be at (6,3).\n\nBut from turn 56 at (4,3), to (6,3) in one turn? Impossible.\n\nMax one move per turn.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 58 from this path.\n\nTurn 58 is the last chance.\n\nAt turn 58, I need to move to (6,2).\n\nSo I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 58 start, like (6,3) or (6,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is bottom.\n\nFrom the current path, on turn 58 start, I am at (5,3), not adjacent to (6,2).\n\n(5,3) to (6,2) is diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nSo I need a different path.\n\nPerhaps from turn 52, move D to (1,4), then on turn 53 move D to (1,3), then on turn 54 move R to (2,3), then to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied initially, but after moves, it might free.\n\nLet's try a faster route.\n\nTurn 52: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 53: move D to (1,3)  // from (1,4) to (1,3) down\n\nNew positions after turn 53: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)  // tail at (3,3)\n\nTurn 54: from (1,3), move R to (2,3)  // (2,3) free\n\nNew head (2,3), direction R\n\nPositions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]  // tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 55: from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nD to (2,2) free.\n\nL to (1,3) index 1, collision.\n\nR to (3,3) - (3,3) not in positions? Positions have (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc, and (4,3), no (3,3), so free.\n\nSo move R to (3,3) for example.\n\nBut (3,3) is closer to bottom.\n\nMove D to (2,2) to go down.\n\nTurn 55: move D to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), direction D\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]  // tail at (5,3)\n\nTurn 56: from (2,2), moves U to (2,3) index 1, collision\n\nD to (2,1) free\n\nL to (1,2) free\n\nR to (3,2) free\n\nSay move R to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 57: to (4,2) or other.\n\nBut (4,2) is above wall, but (5,2) wall, so (4,2) free.\n\nFrom (3,2) move R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 58: from (4,2), move R to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, invalid, or U to (4,3), or D to (4,1).\n\nNot to (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can only go U to (4,3) or L or D, not directly to (6,2).\n\nSo still not reach by turn 58.\n\nPerhaps from (2,2) on turn 56, move D to (2,1), then turn 57 move R to (3,1), etc, but (6,2) not reached.\n\nSo it seems I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 58 from (1,5) in 6 moves with the body in the way.\n\nMinimum moves: from (1,5) to (6,2), difference (5,-3), so at least 5 right and 3 down, but with obstacles, and need to avoid body, it might take more.\n\nIn the first path, I arrived at (6,3) on turn 58, which is adjacent, but to eat on turn 58, I need to be at (6,3) on turn 57 to move to (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nOn turn 57 I am at (5,3), not (6,3).\n\nSo for turn 58, I am at (6,3), so I can move to (6,2) on turn 59, but food gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,2) in time with this snake position.\n\nPerhaps it's not possible, so I should ignore (6,2) and go for (6,5) or other.\n\nBut (6,5) is occupied and has longer life.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (6,2).\n\nAnother idea: on turn 52, move D to (1,4), then turn 53 move R to (2,4), turn 54 move R to (3,4), then from (3,4), on turn 55, instead of R to (4,4), move D to (3,3) if free.\n\nFrom (3,4), on turn 55, after turn 54 at (3,4), positions: let's not simulate, assume (3,3) is free.\n\nThen move D to (3,3) on turn 55.\n\nThen turn 56 move R to (4,3), turn 57 move R to (5,3), turn 58 move R to (6,3), turn 59 move D to (6,2) too late.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom (3,3) move D to (3,2) on turn 56, then R to (4,2) on 57, but to (6,2) not direct.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to eat (6,2) by turn 58, so I should focus on the other food or survival.\n\nFor turn 52, since moving U leads to trap, moving D is better for survival.\n\nThen I can go towards the center or something.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has life span 10, so until turn 61.\n\nCurrently occupied, so I need to free it.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, the segment at (6,5) will move.\n\nIn the initial move D on turn 52, the position (6,5) is still occupied.\n\nAs I move, it might free.\n\nBut it could take time.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way to uncoil.\n\nBut for now, to maximize survival, on turn 52, move D to (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 53, move R to (2,4).\n\nThen turn 54, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 55, move R to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 56, move D to (4,3) as before.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3) or D to (4,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is not reachable in time, perhaps go up or something.\n\nBut let's output the sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: R\n\nTurn 56: D\n\nThen for turn 57, from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) has longer life, and to free it, I can continue moving.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the sequence as per the first plan, even though I can't eat (6,2), but I can survive.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 52, move D to (1,4), then on turn 53, move D to (1,3), then on turn 54, move R to (2,3), then on turn 55, move U to (2,4) or something.\n\nBut let's stop and provide the actions.\n\nSo for turn 52: move D\n\nThen for turn 53: from (1,4), move R\n\nTurn 54: from (2,4), move R\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4), move R\n\nTurn 56: from (4,4), move D\n\nThen for turn 57: from (4,3), move R to (5,3)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the box, I'll put from turn 52 to turn 56 or 57.\n\nSince think 5 turns ahead, output 5 turns.\n\nTurn 52 to turn 56.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: R\n\nTurn 56: D\n\nAnd for turn 57, it can be R, but not in the 5 turns.\n\nThe answer format shows multiple, but not specified how many.\n\nPerhaps output until a decision point.\n\nBut I think for now, this is fine.\n\nTo be safe, on turn 52, move D.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to potentially eat food while considering the 5+ turn horizon. The current state at turn 52 has the snake head at (1,5) with direction left (L), but moving left is invalid due to the wall at x=0. Moving right to (2,5) is also invalid as it causes a body collision. Thus, only up (U) or down (D) are possible. Moving up leads to a dead end by turn 55 (as simulated), so moving down is safer and allows progression toward the food at (6,2), which has a shorter lifespan (must be eaten by turn 58). However, reaching (6,2) by turn 58 is not feasible from the starting position due to distance and body obstacles, so the focus shifts to survival and preparing for the food at (6,5), which has a longer lifespan (until turn 61).\n\nThe sequence below prioritizes moving right and down to navigate toward the center of the grid, avoiding the known trap from moving up. It ensures no collisions and respects movement constraints (no instant reverse). The snake can later attempt to free and eat the food at (6,5) after this sequence.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 52:** Move down (D) to (1,4) – This avoids the wall and body collision, and starts moving away from the left edge.\n- **Turn 53:** Move right (R) to (2,4) – Continues rightward progression, increasing distance from walls.\n- **Turn 54:** Move right (R) to (3,4) – Further rightward movement into safer, open space.\n- **Turn 55:** Move right (R) to (4,4) – Positions the snake closer to the right side where food is located.\n- **Turn 56:** Move down (D) to (4,3) – Avoids a body collision at (4,5) and heads toward the bottom, where (6,2) is (though unreachable by turn 58).\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns by steering clear of walls, body segments, and the internal obstacle at (5,2). After turn 56, the snake at (4,3) can consider moving right to (5,3) or down to (4,2) to approach the food at (6,5) in subsequent turns, but this requires freeing the cell first (currently occupied by body). Long-term, the snake should aim to uncoil or shift its body to access (6,5) before turn 61.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 52\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56\\text{: D} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 53. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,4), and it's moving down (direction D). The body segments are: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 cells long.\n\nFood:\n\n- One at (6,2) with life span 6 and value +1 (since it says value1=1, and it's positive food)\n\n- Another at (6,5) with life span 9 and value +1? Wait, the food is listed as (6,2,6,1) and (6,5,9,1). I think the format is (x, y, life_span, value). For (6,2,6,1): x=6, y=2, life_span=6, value=1. Similarly, (6,5,9,1): x=6, y=5, life_span=9, value=1. Both are positive food since value=1.\n\nBut (6,5) has food, and looking at snake positions, (6,5) is part of the snake body. Specifically, in the list: positions include (6,5), which is the 9th segment? Let's list snake positions with indices:\n\nIndex 0: head (1,4)\n\n1: (1,5)\n\n2: (2,5)\n\n3: (3,5)\n\n4: (4,5)\n\n5: (5,5)\n\n6: (5,6)\n\n7: (6,6)\n\n8: (6,5)  // here is (6,5)\n\n9: (6,4)\n\n10: (5,4)\n\n11: (5,3)\n\n12: (4,3)\n\n13: (3,3)\n\n14: (2,3)  // tail\n\nSo (6,5) is position index 8, which is a body segment. But food is at (6,5) with life span 9. According to rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, the other food is at (6,2), which is empty now, I think.\n\nNow, head direction is down, so from (1,4), moving down would go to (1,3), but let's see possible moves.\n\nSince head is at (1,4) and direction is D (down), moving down would go to (1,3). But we have to consider no instant reverse. Current direction is down, so I cannot move up on the next turn, because that would be reverse. Reverse of down is up.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,4) with current direction D:\n\n- Down: to (1,3)\n\n- Left: to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Right: to (2,4)\n\n- Up: but up is reverse, not allowed since current direction is down.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so next move cannot be up, because that would be opposite.\n\nAlso, cannot move into walls or body, except tail under certain conditions.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells by snake: from the positions, all those coordinates are occupied by snake body except the head.\n\nHead is at (1,4), so moving to (1,3): is (1,3) occupied? Snake positions: tail is (2,3), and (3,3), etc., not (1,3). Let's list all y-coordinates.\n\nx and y: grid from 0 to 7.\n\nSnake: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nNow, possible moves from head (1,4):\n\n- Up: to (1,5) — but (1,5) is occupied by snake body (index 1), and it's not the tail; tail is (2,3). So moving into body segment, deadly collision. Invalid.\n\n- Down: to (1,3) — now, is (1,3) occupied? From the list, no. Also, is it wall? y=0 to y=7, x=0 and x=7 walls, but (1,3) is within bounds. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,2). (1,3) is not a wall, and not occupied, so possible.\n\n- Left: to (0,4) — x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right: to (2,4) — is (2,4) occupied? Not in snake positions. Walls? No, so possible.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (1,3) or Right to (2,4).\n\nCurrent direction is D, so moving Down is same direction, no issue. Moving Right is a turn, allowed.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n\nFood available:\n\n- Food at (6,2): life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn. So on turn 53, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 58? Let's see.\n\nLife span: decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 53, life span 6, so after turn 53, it becomes 5, then 4, ..., down to 0, and disappears when life span reaches 0? Or after N turns.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n\n- At turn t, life span N, countdown starts at N.\n\n- After turn t, it decreases to N-1.\n\n- After turn t+1, to N-2, ..., after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0, and disappears before or after? The food is present as long as life span >0, I assume.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it will be available on turns t, t+1, ..., up to and including turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor example, N=1 at turn t: available only at turn t, disappears at turn t+1.\n\nN=2: available at t and t+1, disappears at t+2.\n\nSo for food at (6,2) at turn 53, life span 6: available from turn 53 to 58 (since 53 + 5 = 58? Turns: t, t+1, ..., t+N-1.\n\nNumber of turns available: N turns.\n\nTurn available: from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n\nDisappears at turn t + N.\n\nSo for (6,2): turn 53, life span 6, so available on turns 53,54,55,56,57,58. Disappears at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): turn 53, life span 9, available turns 53 to 61, disappears at turn 62.\n\nBut (6,5) has food, but it's currently under the snake body at (6,5), which is position index 8.\n\nTo eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it later.\n\nNow, head is at (1,4), which is far from (6,2) and (6,5).\n\nI need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nLet me list rows y from 7 to 0, top to bottom, or bottom to top? Usually y=0 bottom, but in coordinates, it might not matter, but for visualization.\n\nAssume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is a wall cell.\n\nAlso, borders: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,4) are walls, not accessible.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is wall.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5, y=2, which is within 1-6, but wall.\n\nSo free cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 except (5,2).\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (1,4)  // x=1,y=4\n\nBody: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nTail: (2,3)\n\nNow, food at (6,2) and (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied.\n\n(6,5) has food under it, but snake is on it.\n\nTo eat (6,5), the snake must move so that the body leaves (6,5), and later head comes to (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is free, I think. Is (6,2) occupied? Snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), not (6,2) or (6,3), etc. (6,2) should be free, but (5,2) is wall, so (6,2) is playable.\n\n(6,2): x=6,y=2, within 1-6, and not (5,2), so free.\n\nBut walls: (5,2) is wall, but (6,2) is not, so yes.\n\nNow, possible moves from head (1,4):\n\n- Down to (1,3): free, not occupied.\n\n- Right to (2,4): free, not occupied.\n\nCannot up or left.\n\nIf move down to (1,3), then head at (1,3), and snake moves, tail moves to next, but tail is at (2,3), which will move away when snake advances.\n\nAfter moving down to (1,3), the new positions: head to (1,3), then body: the first body segment (1,5) moves to (1,4)? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nAfter move down to (1,3):\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThen the body: the segment that was at (1,4) is now the new neck, but since head moved, the body follows: the segment at index 1 (1,5) moves to the previous head position (1,4)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n\nSo new positions:\n\nHead: (1,3)  // new position\n\nThen body segment 1: moves to where head was, (1,4)\n\nBody segment 2: moves to where body 1 was, (1,5)\n\nBody segment 3: to (2,5)\n\nBody segment 4: to (3,5)\n\nBody segment 5: to (4,5)\n\nBody segment 6: to (5,5)\n\nBody segment 7: to (5,6)\n\nBody segment 8: to (6,6)\n\nBody segment 9: to (6,5)  // (6,5) was occupied, but now the segment that was at (6,6) moves to (6,5)? Let's list indices.\n\nAfter move, the tail is removed, but if no food eaten, snake length same, so tail cell is vacated.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- New head at (1,3)\n\n- Body: segment 0 (old head) is now at (1,4) for body? Positions: new position 0: (1,3)\n\nNew position 1: old position 0, which is (1,4)\n\nNew position 2: old position 1, (1,5)\n\nNew position 3: old position 2, (2,5)\n\nNew position 4: old position 3, (3,5)\n\nNew position 5: old position 4, (4,5)\n\nNew position 6: old position 5, (5,5)\n\nNew position 7: old position 6, (5,6)\n\nNew position 8: old position 7, (6,6)\n\nNew position 9: old position 8, (6,5)  // but (6,5) was occupied by old position 8, but now new position 9 is at old position 8, which is (6,5)\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nThe segments shift: the head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for body segment i, it moves to the position that was occupied by segment i-1 in the previous state.\n\nPrevious state segments:\n\nIndex: 0: (1,4) head\n\n1: (1,5)\n\n2: (2,5)\n\n3: (3,5)\n\n4: (4,5)\n\n5: (5,5)\n\n6: (5,6)\n\n7: (6,6)\n\n8: (6,5)\n\n9: (6,4)\n\n10: (5,4)\n\n11: (5,3)\n\n12: (4,3)\n\n13: (3,3)\n\n14: (2,3) tail\n\nAfter move down to (1,3):\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nNew segment 1: previous position of segment 0, which is (1,4)\n\nNew segment 2: previous position of segment 1, (1,5)\n\nNew segment 3: previous position of segment 2, (2,5)\n\nNew segment 4: (3,5)\n\nNew segment 5: (4,5)\n\nNew segment 6: (5,5)\n\nNew segment 7: (5,6)\n\nNew segment 8: (6,6)\n\nNew segment 9: previous position of segment 8, which is (6,5)  // segment 8 was at (6,5), so new segment 9 moves to (6,5)\n\nPrevious segment 8 was at (6,5), so new segment 9 is at (6,5)\n\nBut food is at (6,5), so if head were to move there, but not now.\n\nNew segment 10: previous position of segment 9, which was (6,4)  // segment 9 was (6,4)\n\nPrevious: segment 9 was (6,4), segment 10 was (5,4), etc.\n\nNew segment 10: previous position of segment 9, which is (6,4)\n\nNew segment 11: previous position of segment 10, (5,4)\n\nNew segment 12: previous position of segment 11, (5,3)\n\nNew segment 13: previous position of segment 12, (4,3)\n\nNew segment 14: previous position of segment 13, (3,3)\n\nThe tail segment 14 was at (2,3), but it moves to where segment 13 was, which is (3,3)? Previous segment 13 was at (3,3), so new segment 14 moves to (3,3), and the old tail position (2,3) is vacated.\n\nSo the cell (6,5) is still occupied by the snake body, now by new segment 9.\n\nSimilarly, for food at (6,5), it remains under the body until the snake moves away.\n\nBut in this move, we didn't eat any food.\n\nSimilarly, if we move right to (2,4).\n\nBut let's focus on planning.\n\nI need to think about eating the food.\n\nFirst, food at (6,2): available turns 53 to 58, so we have until turn 58 to eat it, 6 turns including now.\n\nTurn 53: now, we can act.\n\nFood at (6,5) available longer, until turn 61.\n\nBut (6,5) is currently occupied, so we need to free it first.\n\nAlso, there's a risk with tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut here, tail is at (2,3), and head is at (1,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,4) and (2,3) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y, differ by 1.\n\n(1,4) and (1,3) if down, or (1,4) and (2,4) if right, etc. But tail is (2,3), so |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not adjacent; adjacent requires |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nTo reach (6,2), from (1,4), it's a path.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is close but occupied.\n\nPerhaps we can go towards the area.\n\nBut there's an internal wall at (5,2), which might block the path to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right, (5,2) is wall, so to reach (6,2), we can go from above or left, but left is x=5, which is wall, so only from above or right, but right is x=7 wall, so only from above, like (6,3) or (6,1), but y=1 is bottom, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 playable.\n\ny=1 is row 1, y=0 wall.\n\nSo (6,2) can be accessed from (6,1), (6,3), (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or (7,2) but x=7 wall, so only from (6,1) or (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrent snake: positions include (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), etc., but not (6,3) or (6,2).\n\n(6,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\nLet's list free cells around.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nSince we need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to the foods.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (1,3) or right to (2,4).\n\nIf move down to (1,3), head to (1,3), then from there, possible moves: current direction would be down, so can move down, left, right, but not up (reverse).\n\nFrom (1,3): down to (1,2), left to (0,3) wall, right to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is the current tail, but when we move, the tail moves, so after move to (1,3), the new tail is at (3,3) or something.\n\nAfter moving down to (1,3), new positions as above, tail is at (3,3).\n\nSo from (1,3), moving to (2,3): but (2,3) was old tail, now vacated, so free.\n\nMoving to (1,2): free, probably.\n\nIf move right from (1,4) to (2,4), then new head (2,4), body follows.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then segment 1: old head (1,4), segment 2: (1,5), etc., similar shift.\n\nTail at (3,3) or something.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,2).\n\nTo reach (6,2) from (1,4), a path could be: go right and down, but there might be obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (1,4) to (2,4), then to (3,4), but (3,4) is not occupied? Current positions: (3,5) is occupied, but (3,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free, (5,4) occupied by snake, (5,4) is in positions, index 10? Previous: (6,4) is position, (5,4) is position.\n\nList of occupied: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo (3,4) not occupied, free.\n\n(4,4) free, (5,4) occupied, etc.\n\nSo from (1,4), if we go right to (2,4), then from there, can go right to (3,4), then to (4,4), then to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, but when we move, it might be free.\n\nBut we need to move step by step.\n\nSimilarly, to go down to (1,3), then to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut (6,2) is at y=2, x=6.\n\nWith wall at (5,2), so to reach (6,2), we must go through (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is currently occupied? Snake has (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), not (6,3), so (6,3) is free.\n\nBut there is food at (6,5) on the body.\n\nPerhaps we can plan to eat the food at (6,5) first, but it's under the body now.\n\nThe snake body at (6,5) is segment, and as the snake moves, it might move away.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the body at (6,5) shifts.\n\nCurrent position of (6,5) is occupied by segment 8.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position.\n\nFor instance, if we move down to (1,3), then as above, new segment 9 is at (6,5), still there.\n\nIf we move right to (2,4), let's see what happens.\n\nMove right to (2,4):\n\nNew head: (2,4)\n\nNew segment 1: old head (1,4)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 (1,5)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 (2,5)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 (3,5)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 (4,5)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 (5,5)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 (5,6)\n\nNew segment 8: old segment 7 (6,6)\n\nNew segment 9: old segment 8 (6,5)  // so (6,5) still occupied\n\nSimilarly, no change for (6,5).\n\nTo free (6,5), the snake needs to move so that the segment that is there moves away and no other segment comes, but since the body is connected, it will be occupied until the tail passes.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the tail moves away from it.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,3), far away.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), and the body goes to (6,5), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (6,5).\n\nFor example, from current, after 1 move, tail at (3,3) if move down, or if move right, tail at (3,3) or similar.\n\nAfter move right to (2,4), new tail is at (3,3), as previous segment 13 was (3,3).\n\nDistance to (6,5): from (3,3) to (6,5), at least 5 moves or so.\n\nBut (6,5) is occupied by segment, which will move as snake moves.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves away, and since segments move one by one, it takes time for the tail to vacate it.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (6,5) is part of the body, and when the snake moves, that segment moves to where the previous segment was, so the cell (6,5) is only vacated when the tail leaves it, but the tail is not at (6,5), it's at (2,3).\n\nThe cell (6,5) is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to a new position, so the cell (6,5) is vacated if no new segment moves to it, but in this case, when the segment at (6,5) moves to where the segment in front was, the cell is left empty, unless the head or something comes, but generally, when a body segment moves, the cell it was in is vacated, and the new position it moves to might have been occupied, but in snake movement, cells are vacated when tail moves or body shifts.\n\nIn standard snake, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated if no food eaten. But for body cells, when a segment moves, the cell it was in is vacated, and it moves to the cell of the previous segment.\n\nBut the cell it moves to might have been occupied by the previous segment, which is now moving or vacated.\n\nIt's better not to overcomplicate.\n\nFor the cell (6,5), it is occupied now. After one move, if the snake moves, the segment that was at (6,5) will move to where the segment in front was. For example, if we move down or right, as above, the segment moves to (6,6) or something, but in both cases, (6,5) is still occupied by a different segment or the same.\n\nIn the move down case, new segment 9 at (6,5)\n\nIn move right case, new segment 9 at (6,5)\n\nSo after one move, (6,5) still occupied.\n\nTo vacate (6,5), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment at (6,5) moves, and no other segment moves to (6,5) immediately, but since the body is connected, it depends on the movement.\n\nFor example, if the head moves and the body follows, the cell (6,5) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves away and the segment behind moves to the new position, but it's messy.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the tail passes through it, but the tail is far.\n\nThe distance from tail to (6,5): tail at (2,3), (6,5) is 4 steps in x and 2 in y, min 6 moves, but since the snake is long, it will take about 15 moves for the tail to move significantly, but the cell (6,5) might be vacated earlier if the snake moves away.\n\nFor instance, if the snake moves up or left, the body at (6,5) might move.\n\nBut currently, from the positions, the snake has a \"kink\" at (6,5).\n\nThe snake goes from (5,5) to (5,6) to (6,6) to (6,5) to (6,4), so it has a turn at (6,5).\n\nIf the head moves, say, down or right, the body will straighten or something.\n\nBut let's not get stuck; perhaps for now, since the food at (6,5) has long life span, we can focus on (6,2) which has shorter life.\n\nFood at (6,2) available turns 53 to 58, so we have 6 turns to eat it, including turn 53.\n\nTurn 53: we can move.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (6,2), the Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |2-4| = 5 + 2 = 7, so at least 7 moves, but we have only 6 turns to eat it, including now.\n\nTurns available: 53,54,55,56,57,58. So on turn 58, we can still eat it.\n\nTurn 53: we are at (1,4), need to reach (6,2) by turn 58, so in 5 moves or less? From turn 53 to turn 58, we have moves on turn 53,54,55,56,57 to position for eating on turn 58.\n\nEating on turn 58 requires head at (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nSo we need to arrive at (6,2) on or before turn 58.\n\nWith 6 moves: turn 53 to 58, 6 actions.\n\nBut from (1,4) to (6,2), min 5 moves if direct path, but there might be obstacles.\n\nFor example, move right 5 times and down 2 times, but we need to go to (6,2), so from (1,4), to go to x=6, y=2, so increase x by 5, decrease y by 2.\n\nBut we have walls and snake body.\n\nPath: one possible path: from (1,4) move right to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by snake? Current positions have (4,3) as segment 12, but when we move, it might be free.\n\nAfter a few moves, positions change.\n\nBut let's simulate roughly.\n\nFirst, on turn 53, if we move right to (2,4).\n\nThen turn 54, from (2,4), current direction right (since moved right, head direction R), so can move right, up, down, not left (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: right to (3,4), up to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied? Current after move to (2,4), new positions: head (2,4), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc., so (2,5) is occupied by body segment 2 or something.\n\nAfter move to (2,4) on turn 53:\n\nNew positions: head (2,4)\n\nSeg1: (1,4)  // old head\n\nSeg2: (1,5)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3: (2,5)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (3,5)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5: (4,5)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6: (5,5)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7: (5,6)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8: (6,6)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9: (6,5)  // old seg8\n\nSeg10: (6,4)  // old seg9\n\nSeg11: (5,4)  // old seg10\n\nSeg12: (5,3)  // old seg11\n\nSeg13: (4,3)  // old seg12\n\nSeg14: (3,3)  // old seg13, tail\n\nOld seg14 (2,3) vacated.\n\nSo from (2,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,5): but (2,5) is occupied by seg3, deadly, invalid.\n\n- Down to (2,3): (2,3) is vacated, free.\n\n- Right to (3,4): (3,4) not occupied, free.\n\n- Left to (1,4): but (1,4) is occupied by seg1, and also left is reverse if current direction right? Current direction after moving right to (2,4) is R, so moving left to (1,4) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: down to (2,3) or right to (3,4).\n\nIf we want to go to (6,2), moving right to (3,4) is better.\n\nThen from (3,4), can continue right to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach (6,2) in time.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (6,2): path (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nAfter moving to (2,4), (5,4) is occupied by seg11.\n\nAs snake moves, it will free up.\n\nFor example, on turn 53, move right to (2,4)\n\nTurn 54, move right to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), body: seg1 (2,4), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (3,5), etc.\n\n(5,4) still occupied.\n\nTurn 55, from (3,4), move right to (4,4)\n\nThen head (4,4), body seg1 (3,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) occupied until the tail moves closer.\n\nThe tail is at (3,3) after turn 53, then after turn 54, if we move to (3,4), new tail at (4,3) or something.\n\nAfter turn 53 move to (2,4): tail at (3,3)\n\nTurn 54 move to (3,4): new head (3,4), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), ..., and tail: new seg14 at old seg13 position, which was (4,3)? Previous state after turn 53: positions include seg13 (4,3), so new tail at (4,3) after move.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is still occupied by some segment.\n\nIt will take several moves for (5,4) to be free.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (6,2), we need to go to (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is currently free, but may be occupied later.\n\nPerhaps a different initial move.\n\nAnother option: move down from (1,4) to (1,3) on turn 53.\n\nThen from (1,3), direction down, so can move down, left, right, not up.\n\nLeft to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (1,2), or right to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) was tail, now vacated.\n\nIf move down to (1,2), then we are going down.\n\nBut (1,2) is close to bottom, y=2, but (6,2) is at x=6.\n\nFrom (1,2), to (6,2), need to move right 5 times, but we have only until turn 58.\n\nTurn 53: move to (1,3)\n\nTurn 54: from (1,3), move down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 55: from (1,2), move right to (2,2)? But (2,2) is free? Walls: (5,2) wall, but (2,2) should be free.\n\nThen to (3,2), but (3,2) free, then to (4,2), (4,2) free, then to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, invalid.\n\nCannot go to (5,2), so from (4,2), cannot go directly to (6,2) because of wall.\n\nMust go up or down.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) to (4,3), then to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied or not.\n\nCurrent (5,3) occupied, but later.\n\nFrom (4,2), move to (4,3), then to (5,3), but (5,3) may be occupied.\n\nThen to (6,3), then down to (6,2).\n\nBut let's count moves.\n\nTurn 53: move down to (1,3)  // at (1,3)\n\nTurn 54: move down to (1,2)  // at (1,2)\n\nTurn 55: move right to (2,2)  // at (2,2)\n\nTurn 56: move right to (3,2)  // at (3,2)\n\nTurn 57: move right to (4,2)  // at (4,2)\n\nTurn 58: from (4,2), can move up to (4,3) or down to (4,1) but y=1, or right to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo move to (4,3) on turn 58, but (6,2) is not reached.\n\nFrom (4,2), move to (4,3), then on turn 59, move to (5,3), but turn 59, food at (6,2) disappears at turn 59? Life span: available until turn 58, disappears at turn 59.\n\nSo on turn 58, we are at (4,2), and (6,2) is at distance, cannot reach in one move.\n\nIf on turn 57 at (4,2), but turn 57: from above, on turn 57 at (4,2), then move to (4,3) on turn 57? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 53: move to (1,3)  // t53 end at (1,3)\n\nTurn 54: move to (1,2)  // t54 at (1,2)\n\nTurn 55: move to (2,2)  // t55 at (2,2)\n\nTurn 56: move to (3,2)  // t56 at (3,2)\n\nTurn 57: move to (4,2)  // t57 at (4,2)\n\nTurn 58: from (4,2), possible moves: up to (4,3), down to (4,1), or right to (5,2) wall, so only (4,3) or (4,1).\n\n(4,3) may be occupied or not, but not (6,2). To reach (6,2) from (4,2), need at least two moves, e.g., to (5,3) then (6,2), but (5,2) wall, so must go to (6,3) then (6,2), or (6,1) then (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (6,2): min 2 moves, but on turn 58, we can only move to adjacent, so from (4,2) on turn 58, we can go to (4,3), (4,1), or (5,2) invalid, so not to (6,2).\n\nIf on turn 57 we are at (3,2), turn 57 move to (4,2), same as above.\n\nOn turn 56 at (3,2), turn 57 move to (4,2) or (3,3) or (2,2) back, not helpful.\n\nSo from the down path, we cannot reach (6,2) by turn 58.\n\nIf we start with right move.\n\nTurn 53: move right to (2,4)\n\nTurn 54: from (2,4), move right to (3,4)  // at (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4), move right to (4,4)  // at (4,4)\n\nTurn 56: from (4,4), can move down to (4,3) or right to (5,4) or up to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, etc.\n\n(4,5) is occupied, but may be free.\n\nAfter turn 53 move to (2,4), tail at (3,3)\n\nTurn 54 move to (3,4), tail at (4,3) or something.\n\nLet's not simulate fully.\n\nFrom (4,4), move down to (4,3) on turn 56.\n\nBut (4,3) may be occupied; in current, it is, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nAssume it becomes free.\n\nTurn 56: at (4,4) move down to (4,3)  // at (4,3)\n\nTurn 57: from (4,3), move down to (4,2) or right to (5,3) or left to (3,3), etc.\n\nMove to (5,3)  // at (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) is currently occupied, but let's see.\n\nTurn 57 at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 58: from (5,3), move to (6,3) or (5,4) or (5,2) wall, or (4,3).\n\nMove to (6,3)  // at (6,3)\n\nThen on turn 58 at (6,3), but we need to be at (6,2) to eat, so not yet.\n\nFrom (6,3) on turn 58, we can move down to (6,2) on turn 59, but turn 59 food disappears, so not available.\n\nIf on turn 57 at (5,3), move down to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, invalid.\n\nOr from (4,3) on turn 57, move down to (4,2), then turn 58 move to (4,3) or (4,1) or (5,2) invalid, not to (6,2).\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (6,2) by turn 58 from (1,4) in 5 moves with the obstacles.\n\nMin Manhattan distance is 5, but with the wall at (5,2), we have to go around, so at least 6 moves: e.g., (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2), 7 moves.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (6,2) directly: but (5,2) wall, so must go via (6,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nShortest path: 5 moves if no obstacles, but with wall, need 6 or 7.\n\nFor example: (1,4) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (6,4) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) 7 moves.\n\nOr (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) 7 moves.\n\nCannot do in 5 or 6 to reach by turn 58.\n\nSince we start at turn 53, move on turn 53 to new position, turn 54 to another, ..., turn 58 move to (6,2) if possible.\n\nBut with 6 moves (t53 to t58 action), we can move 6 steps.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (6,2), delta x=5, delta y= -2, so min 7 steps if we have to go around, but we can do it in 5 if no obstacles, but with wall, not possible.\n\nFor example, to go from x=1 to x=6, need 5 right moves, but y from 4 to 2, down 2, so if we go right and down at the same time.\n\nBut at some point, we need to go down to y=2.\n\nWith wall at (5,2), we can go to (4,2) then to (4,3) or something, but to reach (6,2), from (4,2) we cannot go directly, must go to (6,3) first or (5,3) then (6,2), but (5,2) wall.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (6,2) is possible, |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent, must move horizontally or vertically.\n\nTo move from (5,3) to (6,2), not adjacent, so must go to (6,3) then (6,2), or (5,2) wall, or (4,3) etc.\n\nSo from (5,3) to (6,2) takes two moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,4) to (6,2) min 7 moves with the wall.\n\nWith 6 moves, we can get to (6,3) on turn 58, but not (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 58, at (6,3), we can move down to (6,2) on turn 59, but food not available.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat the food at (6,2) because we cannot reach it in time with the wall.\n\nTherefore, we should not pursue (6,2) and focus on the other food or survival.\n\nFood at (6,5) has longer life, but it's under the body.\n\nAlso, there might be other opportunities, but no other food given.\n\nOnly two food items.\n\nPerhaps we can eat the food at (6,5) once it's free.\n\nBut to free (6,5), the snake needs to move so that the tail comes or something.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), and the body is long, so it will take many turns.\n\nFor example, the segment at (6,5) is part of the body, and when the snake moves, it will eventually move, but the cell will be free when that segment moves away and no one replaces it immediately.\n\nBut in this configuration, since the snake has a loop, it might take time.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a way to shorten the path or something.\n\nBut let's think about the head position.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,5) can be eaten if head moves there after the body moves away.\n\nBut currently, head is at (1,4), far.\n\nPerhaps we should move towards the area to be ready.\n\nBut we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's choose a move for turn 53.\n\nOptions: down to (1,3) or right to (2,4).\n\nIf we move down to (1,3), then from there, we can go down to (1,2) or right to (2,3).\n\nIf go to (1,2), then we are in the bottom left, which might be limiting.\n\nIf go right to (2,3), then to (2,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if move right to (2,4), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nNow, there is a risk of tail reward danger if head near tail with food.\n\nBut tail is at (2,3), and if we move to (2,4), head at (2,4), tail at (3,3) after move, not adjacent.\n\nIf we move down to (1,3), head at (1,3), tail at (3,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nPerhaps for long-term survival, we should keep the snake in open areas.\n\nThe grid has free space at top-right or bottom-left.\n\nFor example, cells like (3,4), (4,4), (4,2), etc., are free.\n\nBut (4,2) might be useful later.\n\nSince we can't eat (6,2), ignore it.\n\nFocus on (6,5) food.\n\n(6,5) is occupied, life span 9, available until turn 61.\n\nOn turn 53, life span 9, so available turns 53 to 61, 9 turns.\n\nDisappears at turn 62.\n\nWe need to have head at (6,5) on or before turn 61.\n\nBut (6,5) is occupied now, so we need to vacate it first.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the snake moves away from it.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves, the segment at (6,5) will move to a new position.\n\nBut as long as the body is on it, it's occupied.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the tail passes through it or when the snake changes direction.\n\nLet's see the current body near (6,5): positions (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc.\n\nIf the head moves down or right, the body may start to unravel.\n\nFor instance, if we move the head down to (1,3), then the body might move, but (6,5) remains occupied.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nTo free (6,5), we need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (6,5) moves and no segment comes back.\n\nFor example, if the head moves south, the body might follow, but the tail is at (2,3), so it will take time.\n\nThe distance from head to tail is 14 segments, so about 14 moves for the tail to move significantly.\n\nBut the cell (6,5) can be freed earlier if the snake straightens.\n\nPerhaps it's not efficient to wait.\n\nAnother idea: we can eat the food at (6,5) by moving the head there when it's free, but we need to be close.\n\nBut for now, on turn 53, we should move in a direction that opens up space or avoids traps.\n\nLet's consider moving right to (2,4) on turn 53.\n\nThen on turn 54, from (2,4), we can move right to (3,4) or down to (2,3).\n\nIf move to (3,4), then we are heading east.\n\nFrom (3,4), we can move to (4,4), then to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, but after a few moves, it might be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is occupied.\n\nThe area around (6,5) has many body segments.\n\nPerhaps we can move the head towards the tail to shorten the snake or something, but eating food increases length.\n\nBut we need to eat positive food to score.\n\nSince (6,2) is not reachable, and (6,5) is difficult, perhaps we should avoid risks and just survive, but we need to maximize score, so eating food is good.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (6,5) is on the body, so when the body moves away, it can be eaten.\n\nBut the body will move away only if the snake moves in a direction that pulls it away.\n\nFor example, if the head moves left or down, the body at (6,5) might move.\n\nBut let's calculate how soon (6,5) can be free.\n\nSuppose we move the head down to (1,3) on turn 53.\n\nThen new positions as before, (6,5) still occupied.\n\nTurn 54, from (1,3), move down to (1,2) or right to (2,3).\n\nSay move down to (1,2).\n\nThen head at (1,2), body follows.\n\nThe segment at (6,5) will move to where the previous was, but it might take many moves to affect.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the segment that is there moves away and no segment moves to it in the same turn.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps for simulation, assume that (6,5) will be occupied for at least 10 turns or so, but life span is 9, so it might disappear before we can eat it.\n\nLife span 9 at turn 53, so available until turn 61.\n\nIf we can reach (6,5) by turn 61, but if it's occupied, we need it free.\n\nThe earliest it can be free is when the tail approaches, which is late.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (2,3), and the path to (6,5) is not direct, but roughly, it will take at least 10 moves for the tail to get close.\n\nBy turn 61, it might be free, but we need to be there.\n\nBut head is at (1,4), to (6,5) is 5 in x, 1 in y, min 6 moves, so possible if we move towards it.\n\nBut with the occupation, it's risky.\n\nPerhaps we can go to (6,4) or something.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 53 move.\n\nSince both moves are possible, and we need to think long-term, perhaps moving right to (2,4) is better because it opens more space to the right.\n\nMoving down to (1,3) might lead to a corner.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), if we go down to (1,2), then we have only right or up, but up might be reverse if direction down.\n\nFrom (1,3) direction down, move to (1,2), then direction down, can move to (1,1) or right to (2,2), or left wall, not up.\n\nThen from (1,2), to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left corner, might be trap.\n\nSo moving down might be riskier.\n\nMoving right to (2,4), then to (3,4), we can go to (4,4), etc., more central.\n\nAlso, from there, we can eventually go to (6,5) when possible.\n\nBut for the food at (6,5), it might not be eatable if the body doesn't move away in time.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,5) has value 1, positive, but if we eat it, snake length increases, but there is tail reward danger if head adjacent to tail with food.\n\nBut tail is far, so no issue now.\n\nPerhaps we should ignore the foods for now and focus on not dying.\n\nBut to maximize score, we need to eat when possible.\n\nSince (6,2) is not reachable, and (6,5) is uncertain, maybe just move to open area.\n\nLet's check if (6,5) can be eaten soon.\n\nFor example, if on turn 53 we move down to (1,3), then the body at (6,5) doesn't change.\n\nIf we move right to (2,4), same.\n\nBut suppose we move in a way that the head goes towards the tail, reducing the loop.\n\nFor example, from (1,4), move down to (1,3), then on turn 54, move right to (2,3), but (2,3) was tail, now free.\n\nThen head at (2,3), tail at (3,3) or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps for turn 53, move right to (2,4) to keep options open.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but the state might change, so I should only provide the action for turn 53, and the rest depends.\n\nThe answer format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but in this case, t1=53, and I need to think ahead, but the output is the sequence.\n\nBut the state will change after each move, so I need to plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nBut since no food eaten, the state changes predictably.\n\nBut to be safe, I can plan a path.\n\nSince (6,2) is not reachable, and (6,5) might be, let's assume we go towards (6,5).\n\nFrom (1,4) to (6,5): delta x=5, delta y=1, so min 6 moves.\n\nWith life span 9, we have time.\n\nBut (6,5) is occupied, so we need to arrive when it's free.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the segment there moves away.\n\nThe segment at (6,5) is part of the body, and it will move when the snake moves.\n\nEach move, it moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, the segment at (6,5) will move to where the segment in front was, which is (6,6) in current, but (6,6) is occupied, so it moves to (6,6), but (6,6) is also occupied.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the segment at (6,5) will move to the position that was occupied by the segment in front, which is (6,6) in current state.\n\nAfter move, it is at (6,6), so the cell (6,5) is vacated if no other segment moves to it.\n\nIn the move, when the segment moves from (6,5) to (6,6), the cell (6,5) is left empty, and (6,6) is now occupied by it.\n\nBut the segment that was at (6,6) moves to where its front was, etc.\n\nSo in general, when the snake moves, the cell that was the tail position is vacated, and head moves to new cell.\n\nFor body cells, they shift, so cells are vacated and occupied.\n\nSpecifically for (6,5), it will be vacated when the segment that was there moves away, which happens every move, but another segment might move in.\n\nIn this case, after a move, the new position at (6,5) might be occupied by a different segment or not.\n\nIn earlier simulation, when we moved, (6,5) was still occupied.\n\nTo have (6,5) free, we need a move where no segment is assigned to (6,5).\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a direction that the body at (6,5) moves and the cell is not reoccupied immediately.\n\nBut it's difficult to control.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, move right to (2,4) as a start.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide:\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nBut I need multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps plan to move right for a few turns.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother idea: the snake has a segment at (5,3), which is near (6,2), but (6,2) food.\n\nBut we can't reach it.\n\nI think I should accept that (6,2) is not eatable and focus on survival and the other food.\n\nFor turn 53, move right to (2,4).\n\nThen for turn 54, from (2,4), move right to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 55, from (3,4), move right to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 56, from (4,4), move down to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut let's stop and provide the action for turn 53 only, but the format requires multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut for t1+1, the state is different, so I need to predict.\n\nSince no food eaten, the snake moves predictably for a few turns.\n\nBut to be simple, for turn 53, I choose R.\n\nThen for turn 54, from new position, but I don't know.\n\nPerhaps assume no food eaten, so positions shift.\n\nBut let's define a sequence.\n\nStart with move right on turn 53 to (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 54, from (2,4), move right to (3,4).\n\nOn turn 55, from (3,4), move right to (4,4).\n\nOn turn 56, from (4,4), we can move down to (4,3) or right to (5,4), but (5,4) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 55 at (4,4), positions: let's simulate roughly.\n\nAfter turn 53: head (2,4), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail\n\nAfter turn 54 move to (3,4): head (3,4), body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail\n\nAfter turn 55 move to (4,4): head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail\n\nNow (5,4) is occupied by body.\n\nOn turn 56, from (4,4), direction right (since moved right to (4,4)? From (3,4) to (4,4), direction R, so can move right, up, down, not left.\n\nRight to (5,4): but (5,4) occupied by body, deadly.\n\nUp to (4,5): (4,5) occupied by body, deadly.\n\nDown to (4,3): (4,3) is tail position? In above, tail is at (5,3), so (4,3) is free? Positions: new body has (5,3) as tail, so (4,3) is not occupied, free.\n\nSo move down to (4,3).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we are not eating food.\n\nFor the food at (6,5), it might become free later.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 53, move down to (1,3) to go towards the bottom.\n\nBut I think either move is ok, but let's choose one.\n\nI think moving right is better to avoid the corner.\n\nSo for turn 53: R (right to (2,4))\n\nThen for turn 54, from (2,4), as earlier, can move right to (3,4) or down to (2,3).\n\nMove right to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 55: from (3,4), move right to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,4), move down to (4,3) as above.\n\nThen turn 57: from (4,3), direction down (since moved down to (4,3)? From (4,4) to (4,3), so direction D, so can move down, left, right, not up.\n\nDown to (4,2), or left to (3,3), or right to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) may be occupied, but in simulation, after turn 56 at (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail? Let's not.\n\nI think for the answer, I can provide the first few moves.\n\nSince the food at (6,2) is not reachable, and we need to avoid risks, perhaps move in a way that the snake doesn't trap itself.\n\nBut for now, I'll go with moving right for turn 53.\n\nAnd for the sequence, provide up to turn 55 or something.\n\nBut the format doesn't specify how many turns, but \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so provide 5 turns of actions.\n\nSo for turn 53 to 57.\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nTurn 54: R ( to (3,4) )\n\nTurn 55: R ( to (4,4) )\n\nThen from (4,4), as above, can move down to (4,3) or other, but (5,4) occupied, so move down to (4,3).\n\nTurn 56: D (down to (4,3))\n\nThen from (4,3), can move down to (4,2) or right to (5,3) or left to (3,3).\n\nSay move down to (4,2) to go towards the food area.\n\nTurn 57: D (down to (4,2))\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut we are not eating food, but surviving.\n\nPerhaps that's fine.\n\nSince (6,5) food is at (6,5), and we are at (4,2), we can go to (5,3), (6,3), etc., but (6,5) might be occupied.\n\nBut life span long, so possible.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide this sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: R\n\nTurn 56: D\n\nTurn 57: D\n\nBut on turn 56, from (4,4) to (4,3), direction down.\n\nThen turn 57 from (4,3) to (4,2), direction down.\n\nThen turn 58, from (4,2), move to (4,3) or (4,1) or (5,2) wall, so (4,1) or (4,3).\n\nBut not specified.\n\nBut for the sequence, up to turn 57 is fine.\n\nSince we need to think ahead, but for output, this should work.\n\nPerhaps for turn 53, move down to (1,3) to be closer to (6,2), but we can't reach it, so not better.\n\nI think R is better.\n\nSo final decision.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 53 Decision\n\n**Current State (Turn 53):**\n- **Snake Head Position**: (1, 4)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Down (D)\n- **Possible Moves from (1, 4)**:\n  - **Up (U) to (1, 5)**: Occupied by snake body (segment at index 1), deadly collision. Invalid.\n  - **Down (D) to (1, 3)**: Free (not occupied, not wall). Valid.\n  - **Left (L) to (0, 4)**: Wall (x=0 border). Invalid.\n  - **Right (R) to (2, 4)**: Free (not occupied, not wall). Valid.\n- **Food Considerations**:\n  - **(6, 2) with life span 6 (value +1)**: Available until turn 58. Manhattan distance from (1, 4) is 7, but with wall at (5, 2) blocking direct paths, minimum path is 7 moves (e.g., via (6, 3)). With only 5 moves available (turns 53-57 to position for eating on turn 58), it is impossible to reach by turn 58. Thus, this food is not achievable and should be ignored.\n  - **(6, 5) with life span 9 (value +1)**: Available until turn 61. Currently occupied by snake body (segment at index 8). To eat, the body must move away first, which will take multiple turns due to the snake's length (15 segments) and current position. Head can reach (6, 5) in ~6 moves, but occupation must resolve. Low priority for immediate action due to risk and uncertainty.\n- **Risk Assessment**:\n  - Moving Down (D) to (1, 3) risks cornering the snake near (1, 2), limiting future mobility.\n  - Moving Right (R) to (2, 4) opens central grid areas, improving long-term mobility and access to future food opportunities.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**: Avoid corners and potential traps. Prioritize moves that maintain flexibility and access to open spaces. Given the unreachable (6, 2) food and uncertain (6, 5) food, the primary goal is to maximize open space for 5+ turns to avoid collisions and position for future food.\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 53-57):**\n- **Turn 53: Move Right (R)** to (2, 4). This avoids the bottom-left corner, heads toward central areas, and aligns with the current direction for smoother turns.\n- **Turn 54: Move Right (R)** to (3, 4). From (2, 4), direction is Right (R). Moving right continues toward open space; up to (2, 5) is occupied, down to (2, 3) is possible but less central.\n- **Turn 55: Move Right (R)** to (4, 4). From (3, 4), direction is Right (R). Right to (4, 4) is free and central; down to (3, 3) or up to (3, 5) are occupied or less optimal.\n- **Turn 56: Move Down (D)** to (4, 3). From (4, 4), direction is Right (R). Down to (4, 3) is free (tail has moved away); right to (5, 4) is occupied, up to (4, 5) is occupied.\n- **Turn 57: Move Down (D)** to (4, 2). From (4, 3), direction is Down (D). Down to (4, 2) is free and explores lower rows; right to (5, 3) may be occupied, left to (3, 3) is less exploratory.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Turn 53 R**: Starts movement away from walls and toward open grid, avoiding immediate corner risk at (1, 3).\n- **Turns 54-55 R**: Progresses east to central columns (x=3,4), maximizing mobility for future food access (e.g., potential path to (6, 5) if freed).\n- **Turns 56-57 D**: Shifts south to row y=2, exploring new areas while avoiding body collisions. By turn 57, the snake is at (4, 2), with options to reach (6, 2) area if new food appears or to head toward (6, 5) after occupation resolves.\n- **Risk Minimization**: All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and reverses. The path keeps the snake in open areas, with no dead ends within 5 turns.\n- **Food Potential**: By turn 57, the snake is better positioned for (6, 5) if it becomes free by turn 61 (life span 9). Monitor (6, 5) occupation in later turns.\n\n**Full Action Sequence:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 53: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 54: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 55: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 56: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 57: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 54, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the snake can only be in cells where x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except for the obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). That's 15 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 6: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 7: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 8: (6,6)\n\n- Segment 9: (6,5)\n\n- Segment 10: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 11: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 12: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 13: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 14: (3,3)  // that's the tail? Positions have 15 elements, so head and 14 body segments, tail is (3,3).\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n\nLife span: (6,2) has life 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 54, it has 5 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 58? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, food has life L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t, so it disappears at the start of turn t+L? Or after turn t+L-1? I need to clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo if at turn t, life_span = N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor example, at turn 54, life_span=5, so it will be there for turns 54,55,56,57,58, and disappear at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life_span=8, so present from turn 54 to 61, disappear at 62.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,4) moving right.\n\nBody: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nLet's plot this.\n\nFirst, y-coordinates: from 1 to 6, bottom to top? Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the position list, (1,4) and (1,5), etc., but walls y=0 and y=7, so I think y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but since walls, playable y=1 to 6. Similarly x=1 to 6.\n\nIn the snake positions, (1,4) and (1,5), (1,5) has higher y, so probably y=1 is bottom, y=6 top? Let's assume y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top for simplicity.\n\nBut in the food, (6,2) and (6,5), y=2 and y=5.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nObstacle: (5,2)\n\nSnake:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nThen: (1,4) -- left of head\n\nThen (1,5) -- up from (1,4)? (1,4) to (1,5) is up, since y increases.\n\nThen (2,5) -- right from (1,5)\n\nThen (3,5) -- right\n\n(4,5) -- right\n\n(5,5) -- right\n\n(5,6) -- up\n\n(6,6) -- right\n\n(6,5) -- down\n\n(6,4) -- down\n\n(5,4) -- left\n\n(5,3) -- down\n\n(4,3) -- left\n\n(3,3) -- left? (4,3) to (3,3) is left.\n\nTail at (3,3)\n\nNow, food at (6,2) and (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is also a body segment? Let's see, (6,5) is in snake positions: after (6,6) is (6,5), which is segment 9.\n\n(6,5) is occupied by the snake body, but there is food at (6,5) with value 1.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is food, not occupied.\n\nCurrent head direction is R (right), so from (2,4), moving right would go to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is not occupied, let's see the positions: snake has (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc. (3,4) is not listed, so it's empty.\n\nPossible moves from head at (2,4): since direction is R, can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be reverse? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L (left). Can move U, D, R.\n\nNow, adjacent cells:\n\nUp: (2,5) - but (2,5) is a body segment? Positions: after head (2,4), next is (1,4), then (1,5), then (2,5). (2,5) is the fourth segment, I think. Let's index:\n\nIndex 0: head (2,4)\n\nIndex 1: (1,4)\n\nIndex 2: (1,5)\n\nIndex 3: (2,5)\n\nIndex 4: (3,5)\n\netc.\n\nSo (2,5) is index 3, body segment. Similarly, (2,4) is head, so (2,5) is directly above head? Head at (2,4), (2,5) is y=5, which is above if y increases up.\n\nSo from (2,4), moving up to (2,5) would collide with body, since (2,5) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (2,3): is it occupied? Positions: tail is (3,3), but (2,3) not listed, so probably empty.\n\nMoving right to (3,4): not listed, empty.\n\nMoving left to (1,4): but (1,4) is index 1, body segment, and also left is reverse? Current direction R, moving L is opposite, so cannot move left anyway.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,5) - but occupied by body, collision, death.\n\n- D: to (2,3) - empty, safe? But need to check if it's wall or something. (2,3): x=2, y=3, between 1-6, not obstacle, so empty.\n\n- R: to (3,4) - empty, safe.\n\nCannot move L.\n\nSo from current position, only possible safe moves are D or R. U is blocked by body, L is not allowed.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFood: (6,2) and (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by snake body, segment 9: (6,5)\n\nFood at (6,5) can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is free.\n\nBut (6,2) is near the obstacle (5,2), and walls.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,3), and so on.\n\nI should consider the path to the foods.\n\nFirst, let's think about the grid map.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake: from positions:\n\n(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo occupied: (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(3,4) is not occupied, (2,3) not, (4,4) not, etc.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,3), (1,6)? y=6 is top? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\ny=1 to 6, so (1,6) is possible? Not occupied, no wall, but obstacle only at (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), (3,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,5), but (6,5) occupied.\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nNow, life span: (6,2) has life 5, so must be eaten by turn 58 or it disappears. Since at turn 54, life=5, present turns 54,55,56,57,58, gone at 59.\n\n(6,5) life=8, present turns 54 to 61.\n\nBut (6,5) is currently under snake body, so to eat it, we need to move the body away first.\n\nThe snake is moving, so positions change.\n\nAt turn 54, head at (2,4), direction R.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 54.\n\nOptions: D or R.\n\nIf I go D to (2,3), or R to (3,4).\n\nNow, let's think about long-term.\n\nI want to eat food, but avoid dying.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (3,3). Who is adjacent to tail? Adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is a body segment, index 13? Positions: tail is (3,3), before that is (4,3), so (4,3) is adjacent but not tail, tail is (3,3).\n\nAdjacent to tail (3,3): (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is occupied by the body, it's the segment before tail.\n\n(3,2) not occupied, (3,4) not occupied, (2,3) not occupied.\n\nCurrently, no food at tail position, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut if we move and tail has food, we need to be careful.\n\nNow, back to turn 54 actions.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (3,4)\n\nThen head at (3,4) at turn 55? Turn 54 action: move to (3,4), so at turn 55, head at (3,4), and body follows, so tail moves, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (2,3), head at (2,3) at turn 55.\n\nNow, from (3,4), where can I go? Direction would be R, since I moved right, so current direction R.\n\nCan move U, D, R, not L.\n\n(3,4) adjacent: U (3,5) - but (3,5) is body segment, occupied.\n\nD (3,3) - (3,3) is tail, but when I move to (3,4), the tail will still be at (3,3) for a moment, but after move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nAt turn 54, if I move to (3,4), new head position (3,4), then the body: segment 1 moves to old head (2,4), segment 2 to (1,4), etc., and tail (3,3) is removed, so new tail is (4,3)? Positions: after move, head at (3,4), then body: [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) ] and tail (3,3) is gone, so new positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) — (4,3) is the new tail? Original positions 15 segments, after move without eating, 15 segments but tail removed, so 14 segments.\n\nOriginal: 15 positions, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so the last segment (tail) is removed. So new snake has 14 segments.\n\nNew head at (3,4) if moved R.\n\nBody: segment 1: old head (2,4)\n\nSegment 2: old segment 1 (1,4)\n\nSegment 3: old segment 2 (1,5)\n\nSegment 4: old segment 3 (2,5)\n\nSegment 5: old segment 4 (3,5)\n\nSegment 6: old segment 5 (4,5)\n\nSegment 7: old segment 6 (5,5)\n\nSegment 8: old segment 7 (5,6)\n\nSegment 9: old segment 8 (6,6)\n\nSegment 10: old segment 9 (6,5)\n\nSegment 11: old segment 10 (6,4)\n\nSegment 12: old segment 11 (5,4)\n\nSegment 13: old segment 12 (5,3)\n\nSegment 14: old segment 13 (4,3)  // new tail\n\nOld segment 14 (3,3) is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nNow, at (3,4), I can move: U to (3,5) - occupied by body? (3,5) is segment 5 in new list? Segments: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (2,4), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,5), index 4: (2,5), index 5: (3,5), so (3,5) is index 5, body segment, occupied. So move U to (3,5) would collide.\n\nD to (3,3) - (3,3) is not occupied now, since tail moved, so empty.\n\nR to (4,4) - (4,4) not occupied, empty.\n\nCannot move L to (2,4), which is body and reverse.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves D or R.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved D at turn 54 to (2,3), then new head at (2,3), body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (4,3) but tail (3,3) gone, new tail (4,3)? Original positions, after move: head (2,3), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\n(4,3) tail.\n\nNow, at (2,3), direction would be D, since I moved down.\n\nCurrent direction after move: since I moved D, direction is D.\n\nCan move L, R, D, not U (up, reverse).\n\nAdjacent: L to (1,3) - empty? (1,3) not occupied, no wall.\n\nR to (3,3) - empty, since tail moved.\n\nD to (2,2) - empty? y=2, not wall, not occupied.\n\nU to (2,4) - body and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,3): L, R, D.\n\nNow, back to turn 54 choice.\n\nI need to get to the food, especially (6,2) which has short life.\n\n(6,2) is at bottom right, near wall and obstacle.\n\nAlso, (6,5) is on the body, so we need to free it.\n\nFirst, let's see the path to (6,2).\n\nFrom head at (2,4), to (6,2).\n\nPossible moves: if I go R to (3,4), then I can go down or right.\n\nIf I go D to (2,3), then I can go left, right, or down.\n\n(2,3) is closer to (6,2) in y-coordinate, but x is far.\n\n(2,3) to (6,2) is dx=4, dy=1.\n\n(3,4) to (6,2) is dx=3, dy=2.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, the snake body is in the way.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving, so some paths might open.\n\nBut I need to think about the food at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied, but if the snake moves, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, if the head moves away, the body will follow, so (6,5) might be vacated.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to come back.\n\nSince (6,5) has longer life, I can focus on (6,2) first.\n\nLife of (6,2) is short, only 5 turns including this one, so I need to eat it within 5 turns.\n\nFrom turn 54 to 58.\n\nAt turn 54, I need to start moving towards it.\n\nNow, from (2,4), if I go down to (2,3), I am closer to y=2.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), (4,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, so I have to go around.\n\n(5,2) obstacle, so to reach (6,2), I need to go to (6,1) or (6,3) first? y=1 is wall? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable, bottom.\n\ny from 1 to 6, y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nSo (6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go to (3,2), (4,2), but (5,2) blocked, so cannot go to (5,2), must go to (4,3) or (5,1) or (5,3), etc.\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid with obstacles and snake.\n\nGrid cells:\n\nx\\y | 1    2    3    4    5    6\n---------------------------------\n1   |      (1,4) (1,5) \n2   |      (2,3)?

(3,5) \n4   | (4,3)            (4,5) \n5   | (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)  and obstacle (5,2)\n6   |      (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,6), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,6), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (3,4) is free, etc.\n\nFood at (6,2) and (6,5), but (6,5) occupied.\n\nTo reach (6,2) from (2,4).\n\nShortest path might be down to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), (4,2), but (4,2) to (6,2): (4,2) to (5,2) blocked, so need to go to (4,1) or (4,3), then to (5,1) or (5,3), then to (6,2).\n\nFor example: (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> but (4,2) to (5,2) impossible, so from (4,2) go down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2).\n\nOr from (4,2) go up to (4,3), but (4,3) is snake body? At turn 54, (4,3) is occupied, but as snake moves, it might free up.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,4) go right to (3,4), then down to (3,3), but (3,3) is tail, but after move, it moves.\n\nLet's simulate both options for a few turns.\n\nFirst, option: at turn 54, move D to (2,3)\n\nThen at turn 55, head at (2,3), direction D.\n\nFrom here, I can move L to (1,3), R to (3,3), or D to (2,2).\n\nI want to go to (6,2), so moving D to (2,2) seems good.\n\nThen at turn 56, from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2), or L to (1,2), or U to (2,3), but U might be reverse? Direction: after moving D to (2,2), direction is D, so can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nU is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (2,2), move R to (3,2) or D to (2,1) or L to (1,2).\n\n(2,1) is y=1, not wall.\n\nBut (6,2) is at y=2, so moving down might not be efficient.\n\nMove R to (3,2).\n\nThen at turn 57, from (3,2), direction R (since moved right), can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2).\n\nNow, (4,2) is free, I assume.\n\nThen to (4,2), then from there, to reach (6,2), need to go to (5,2) but blocked, so must go to (4,1) or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) might be occupied or not, depending on snake position.\n\nLet's track the snake.\n\nAt turn 54, move D to (2,3)\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) is tail.\n\nNow turn 55, from (2,3), move D to (2,2) for example.\n\nThen new head (2,2), body: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail. (4,3) still tail? After move, tail is removed, so new tail is (5,3).\n\nAfter move to (2,2), head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) and tail (4,3) gone, so new tail (5,3).\n\nPositions: 15 segments, after move no food, so 14 segments: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) tail.\n\nTurn 56, from (2,2), move R to (3,2) (assume).\n\nDirection after move D to (2,2), so direction D.\n\nMove R to (3,2), which is right, so new direction R.\n\nNew head (3,2), body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail. (5,3) tail, but after move, tail (5,3) gone, new tail (5,4)? Head to (3,2), then segments: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and (5,3) gone, so tail (5,4).\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail.\n\n(5,4) tail.\n\nNow at (3,2), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,3) - is it occupied? (3,3) not in positions, free.\n\nD to (3,1) - free, y=1 not wall.\n\nR to (4,2) - free.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I can move R to (4,2).\n\nTurn 57, move R to (4,2)\n\nNew head (4,2), body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail.\n\nAfter move, tail (5,4) gone, new tail (6,4)?

So at turn 58, it is still there, but at turn 59, it disappears. So to eat it, I need to be on (6,2) at turn 58 or earlier.\n\nIn this path, at turn 58, I am at (4,1) or (5,1), not at (6,2).\n\nAt turn 57, I am at (4,2), turn 58 move to (4,1) or (4,3), then turn 59 to (5,1) or (5,3), but food gone at turn 59.\n\nTurn 58 is the last turn to eat (6,2).\n\nAt turn 58, I need to be at (6,2).\n\nIn this simulation, at turn 54: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 55: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 56: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 57: at (3,2), move R to (4,2) — at turn 57 head at (4,2)\n\nThen turn 58: from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or D to (4,1), but not to (6,2) directly.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (6,2) in one move impossible, so I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 58 if I go this way.\n\nAt turn 57, I am at (4,2), which is not adjacent to (6,2), so even at turn 58, I can only go to (4,3), (4,1), or (5,2) blocked, so I can never reach (6,2) from here by turn 58.\n\nTurn 58 action would be from (4,2) to say (4,3), then at turn 58 head at (4,3), still not (6,2).\n\nSo too late.\n\nThis path is too slow.\n\nFrom (2,3) at turn 55, instead of going down, I could go right to (3,3).\n\nAt turn 54 move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 55, from (2,3), move R to (3,3)\n\nThen at turn 55, head at (3,3), but (3,3) was tail, but after previous move, it is free.\n\nPositions after turn 54 move D to (2,3): head (2,3), body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 55 move R to (3,3): new head (3,3), body (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail. (5,3) tail.\n\n(3,3) is now head.\n\nDirection after move to (3,3) is R, since moved right.\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,4) - free? Not occupied.\n\nD to (3,2) - free.\n\nR to (4,3) - (4,3) is occupied? In positions, (4,3) is in body?

From (3,4) can move R to (4,4) or D to (3,3).\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nMove R to (4,4).\n\nThen new head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail.\n\nAfter move, tail (5,3) gone, new tail (5,4)? Head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and (5,3) gone, so tail (5,4).\n\nNow at (4,4), direction R, can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,5) - (4,5) is body segment, occupied.\n\nD to (4,3) - free.\n\nR to (5,4) - (5,4) is body? Positions, (5,4) is segment 12 in new list? Head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail.\n\n(5,4) is tail, so it is occupied, but since it's tail, when I move, it might be safe to move there because the tail will move.\n\n\"Deadly collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe, because tail moves away.\n\nSo from (4,4), move R to (5,4) is possible, since (5,4) is tail.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (4,3) or U to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nMove R to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 56, head at (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), and (5,4) was tail but now head moved there, so tail moves to (6,4)? New positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), and old tail (5,4) is now head, so the segment that was at (6,4) becomes new tail? Let's see: the body segments shift, so new tail is the last one, (6,4).\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,4) tail.\n\nAt (5,4), direction R, can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (5,5) - occupied, body segment.\n\nD to (5,3) - (5,3) is not occupied, free? Positions have (5,5) etc, not (5,3), so free.\n\nR to (6,4) - (6,4) is tail, so can move there.\n\nMove D to (5,3) or R to (6,4).\n\nBut I want to go to (6,2), so perhaps move D to (5,3).\n\nTurn 57, from (5,3), can move to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, or (6,3), or (5,4) but body, or (4,3), etc.\n\nNot directly to (6,2).\n\nIt seems difficult to reach (6,2) by turn 58 from current position.\n\nMaybe I should give up on (6,2) and focus on other food or survival.\n\nBut there is (6,5) food, which has longer life.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 15 segments, so the grid is crowded.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (6,5) is on the body, so if the snake moves, it might be freed soon.\n\nFor example, the segment at (6,5) is part of the body, and as the snake moves, it will move away.\n\nIn the current positions, (6,5) is segment 9 or something.\n\nAt turn 54, positions: (6,5) is occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves, so (6,5) will be vacated eventually.\n\nBut when?\n\nFor example, if I move without eating, after 6 moves, the tail might move away from (6,5), but it depends.\n\nLet's see the position of (6,5) in the snake.\n\nSnake positions: index 0: (2,4) head\n\n1: (1,4)\n\n2: (1,5)\n\n3: (2,5)\n\n4: (3,5)\n\n5: (4,5)\n\n6: (5,5)\n\n7: (5,6)\n\n8: (6,6)\n\n9: (6,5)  -- this is the food cell\n\n10: (6,4)\n\n11: (5,4)\n\n12: (5,3)\n\n13: (4,3)\n\n14: (3,3) tail\n\nSo (6,5) is index 9.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no food eaten, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, so index 9 will move to the position of index 8, which is (6,6), so after one move, the cell (6,5) is vacated, because index 9 moves to (6,6), and no one is at (6,5) anymore.\n\nLet's see: after move, new positions: head to new cell, say (3,4) if move R.\n\nThen index 1 to (2,4), index 2 to (1,4), index 3 to (1,5), index 4 to (2,5), index 5 to (3,5), index 6 to (4,5), index 7 to (5,5), index 8 to (5,6), index 9 to (6,6), index 10 to (6,5), etc.\n\nIndex 9 moves to old index 8 position (6,6), so the cell (6,5) is now occupied by index 10, which moves to old index 9 position (6,5), so (6,5) is still occupied by index 10 now.\n\nAfter move, the cell that was (6,5) is now the position of the segment that was behind it.\n\nSpecifically, after one move, the segment that was at index 9 is now at index 8 old position, and the cell (6,5) is now occupied by the segment that was at index 10, which moves to old index 9 position.\n\nSince the positions shift, the cell (6,5) is still occupied unless the tail was there.\n\nIn this case, after one move, index 10 moves to (6,5), so (6,5) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, after two moves, it might change.\n\nTo vacate (6,5), I need the tail to pass through it or something.\n\nThe cell (6,5) will be free when the segment that is currently at (6,5) moves away and no other segment moves there immediately.\n\nBut because of the snake movement, the body segments follow, so it takes time for a cell to be free.\n\nSpecifically, for a body cell to be vacated, it depends on when that segment is at the tail position.\n\nFor example, the segment at index 9 will be at the tail after 6 moves, since there are 15 segments, tail is index 14, so index 9 will be tail after 5 moves? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 54, index 14 is tail.\n\nAfter one move, index 13 becomes tail.\n\nAfter two moves, index 12 becomes tail.\n\nAfter three moves, index 11 becomes tail.\n\nAfter four moves, index 10 becomes tail.\n\nAfter five moves, index 9 becomes tail.\n\nAfter six moves, index 8 becomes tail, etc.\n\nWhen index 9 becomes tail, at that turn, when the snake moves, the tail is removed, so that cell is vacated.\n\nAt turn 54, index 9 is at (6,5).\n\nAfter 5 moves without eating, at turn 59, index 9 will be the tail.\n\nAt turn 59, when the snake moves, the tail (index 9) is removed, so (6,5) is vacated at that point.\n\nBut the food at (6,5) has life span 8, so at turn 54 to 61, so at turn 59 it is still there.\n\nAfter the cell is vacated, head can move there to eat.\n\nBut it will take 5 turns to free the cell.\n\nThen at turn 59, the cell is free, and food is there, so I can eat it at turn 59 or later.\n\nBut I need to have the head near there.\n\nFirst, for (6,2), with short life, I may not reach it in time, so perhaps I should ignore it and plan for (6,5).\n\nAlso, there might be other paths.\n\nAnother thing: I can eat the food at (6,5) before it is vacated, but only if the head moves there after the body moves away, but in this case, since the body is on it, I can't move head there until it's free.\n\nSo I have to wait for it to be free.\n\nSo best to plan to eat (6,5) around turn 59 or so.\n\nBut let's confirm the life: at turn 54, life span 8, so present until turn 61 (turns 54 to 61 inclusive, 8 turns), disappear at turn 62.\n\nSo I can eat it from turn 54 to 61, but it's occupied until turn 59, so only possible to eat at turn 59,60,61.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), life 5, turns 54 to 58, but I may not reach it.\n\nSo perhaps for turn 54, I should move in a way that positions the snake to eat (6,5) later.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nCurrent move: from (2,4), move D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (3,4), I am closer to the right side.\n\nThen I can move down or right to navigate.\n\nIf I move D to (2,3), I am closer to bottom.\n\nBut since (6,5) is at top-right, moving right might be better.\n\nLet's think about the area around (6,5).\n\nThe food at (6,5) is on the body, but will be free later.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of collision.\n\nAnother point: the head is at (2,4), and there is a loop or something.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the tail or something.\n\nLet's list the free cells near the head.\n\nAt (2,4), free cells: (2,3) down, (3,4) right.\n\n(1,4) is body, (2,5) body.\n\nSo only two choices.\n\nI need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps moving right to (3,4) is better because it opens up more space.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3) or right to (4,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,4), then to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied later.\n\nLet's plan a path to be near (6,5) at turn 59.\n\nTurn 59 is 5 turns from now.\n\nCurrent turn 54.\n\nAfter 5 turns, at turn 59.\n\nI need to be at (6,5) or adjacent to move there.\n\nBut at turn 59, the cell is vacated, so I can move to (6,5) at turn 59.\n\nSo I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,5) at turn 58, so that at turn 59 I can move to (6,5).\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,5): (6,6), (6,4), (5,5), (7,5) but x=7 wall, so (6,6), (6,4), (5,5).\n\n(6,6) and (6,4) and (5,5) are currently occupied, but will change.\n\nAt turn 58, I need to be at one of these to move to (6,5) at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at (6,5) at turn 60 or 61.\n\nBut let's aim for turn 59.\n\nFirst, where is the head now at turn 54.\n\nMove to (3,4) at turn 54.\n\nThen turn 55, from (3,4) move to say (4,4) or (3,3).\n\nMove to (4,4).\n\nTurn 55: head at (4,4), as earlier.\n\nThen from (4,4), move to (5,4), which is tail, so safe.\n\nTurn 56: head at (5,4), then from there, can move U to (5,5) but occupied, or D to (5,3), or R to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is body, but will be tail or something.\n\nPositions after turn 55: if at turn 55 head at (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail? Let's not simulate fully.\n\nAssume I go to (5,4) at turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: head at (5,4), direction after move to (5,4) is R (from (4,4) to (5,4) right).\n\nAt (5,4), can move D to (5,3) or R to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is currently body, but may be safe if tail.\n\nIn positions, at that time, (6,4) might not be tail.\n\nBut I can move to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 57 at (5,3), can move to (5,2) blocked, or (6,3), or (5,4) body, or (4,3).\n\nMove to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 58 at (6,3), can move to (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), etc.\n\nAt turn 58, I am at (6,3), then at turn 59, I can move to (6,4) or (6,2) or (5,3), etc.\n\n(6,5) is adjacent to (6,4), so from (6,4) I can move to (6,5) at turn 59.\n\nBut at turn 58, I need to be at (6,4) to move to (6,5) at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,3) at turn 58, I can move to (6,4) at turn 59, then to (6,5) at turn 60.\n\nOr directly if possible.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at (6,4) at turn 58.\n\nFirst, from current position.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: from (3,4) move R to (4,4)  // assume\n\nThen at turn 55, head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nMove R to (5,4)  // (5,4) is tail, safe\n\nTurn 56: head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nNow at (5,4), can move U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) free, R to (6,4) occupied but may be safe.\n\n(6,4) is currently body, not tail, so moving there would collide.\n\nIn positions at turn 56: after move to (5,4), let's find positions.\n\nAt turn 54 move R to (3,4): positions head (3,4), body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 55 move R to (4,4): new head (4,4), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail. (5,3) tail.\n\nTurn 56 move R to (5,4): (5,4) is not tail, it is body, index 13 or something.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail.\n\n(5,4) is index 13, body segment, not tail, so moving to (5,4) would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, from (4,4) at turn 55, cannot move R to (5,4) because it is occupied by body.\n\nCan only move D to (4,3) or U to (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo move D to (4,3).\n\nTurn 56: head at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen from here, can move L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2), U to (4,4) body or reverse.\n\nMove to (5,3).\n\nTurn 57 at (5,3), then to (6,3) or (5,2) blocked, etc.\n\nThen to (6,3) at turn 58, then to (6,4) at turn 59, then to (6,5) at turn 60.\n\nAt turn 60, food still there.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at (5,5) or something.\n\nBut (6,5) can be eaten at turn 60 or 61.\n\nNow for turn 54, I need to choose an action.\n\nSince (6,2) is hard to reach, I might ignore it.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way.\n\nFrom (2,4), move D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 55 move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 56 move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 57 move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58 move U to (5,4) or something, not to (6,2).\n\nStill not.\n\nSo probably cannot reach (6,2) in time, so focus on (6,5).\n\nSo for turn 54, moving R to (3,4) might be better to get closer to the right side.\n\nThen I can navigate to be near (6,5) at turn 59 or 60.\n\nAlso, avoid dying.\n\nAnother risk: the grid has limited space, snake is long, so I need to avoid boxing myself.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (2,3), I might be trapped in the bottom-left.\n\nWhereas right to (3,4), I can go to the center or right.\n\nSo I think moving right is better.\n\nSo for turn 54, move R to (3,4).\n\nThen for future turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 54 to 58 or so.\n\nTurn 54: action\n\nTurn 55: action\n\netc.\n\nBut I don't know the state, so I need to simulate or plan a sequence.\n\nSince the state changes, I can only plan based on current, but for the answer, I need to specify actions for the next turns.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path.\n\nAssume I move R at turn 54 to (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 55, from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3) or R to (4,4) if possible.\n\nFrom (3,4), U is occupied, so only D or R.\n\nMove R to (4,4) if free.\n\n(4,4) is free, so move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 55: move R to (4,4)\n\nThen at turn 56, from (4,4), can move D to (4,3) or U to (4,5) occupied, or R to (5,4) occupied, so only move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 56: move D to (4,3)\n\nThen at (4,3), direction D, can move L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2), or U reverse.\n\nMove R to (5,3) to go right.\n\nTurn 57: move R to (5,3)\n\nAt (5,3), direction R, can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2) blocked, R to (6,3), L to (4,3) body or reverse.\n\nU to (5,4) may be occupied, but let's see.\n\nPositions at turn 57: let's not track all, but (5,4) might be free or not.\n\nFrom (5,3), move R to (6,3) or U to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) is free, so move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 58: at (6,3), can move U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\nSo move U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\nAt turn 58, (6,2) food may be gone, but (6,5) food is there.\n\nMove U to (6,4) to prepare for (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 59, from (6,4), move U to (6,5) to eat the food.\n\nAt turn 59, (6,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 58, I can move to (6,4), then turn 59 to (6,5).\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 54: R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 56: D to (4,3)  // from (4,4) move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 57: R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58: U to (6,4)?

Given the snake's current position (head at (2,4) moving right) and the crowded grid, reaching (6,2) within 5 turns is infeasible without high risk. Instead, the plan focuses on navigating safely to position the head near (6,5) by turn 59, when the cell is expected to be vacated by the body (as the segment occupying it will become the tail and move away by turn 59). The sequence below ensures the snake avoids collisions, walls, and obstacles while preparing to eat (6,5) around turn 60.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (6,5)**: Occupied by the snake body (index 9) at turn 54. It will be vacated by turn 59 after 5 moves without eating, as the segment moves toward the tail. Eating is planned for turn 60 to allow safe approach.\n- **Food at (6,2)**: Life span too short (must be eaten by turn 58); reaching it from (2,4) in 4 moves is impossible due to obstacles (e.g., (5,2) blocked) and body blocks. Ignored to avoid unnecessary risk.\n- **Movement Safety**: \n  - Avoid body collisions: At each step, moves are checked against future body positions.\n  - No instant reverse: Direction changes respect current head direction.\n  - Tail reward danger: No food at tail initially, but monitored.\n- **Path to (6,5)**: \n  - From (2,4), move right toward the center to open space.\n  - Sequentially move to (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) by turn 58.\n  - At turn 59, move to (6,4) (adjacent to (6,5)).\n  - Eat (6,5) at turn 60 (food still present, life span until turn 61).\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 54-58):\nThe actions are based on the current state (turn 54) and simulate 5 turns ahead. Each move is feasible and avoids risks:\n- **Turn 54 (current)**: Move **R (right)** to (3,4).  \n  - *Reason*: From (2,4), moving down (to (2,3)) leads to a dead-end in the bottom-left. Moving right opens the path to the right side, aligning with the long-term goal. U is blocked by body at (2,5), L is reverse (not allowed).\n- **Turn 55**: Move **R (right)** to (4,4).  \n  - *Reason*: From (3,4), U is blocked by body at (3,5), so only D or R possible. Moving right to (4,4) progresses toward (6,5) and avoids bottom areas with fewer options.\n- **Turn 56**: Move **D (down)** to (4,3).  \n  - *Reason*: From (4,4), U is blocked by body at (4,5), R is blocked by body at (5,4), so only D is safe. Moving down to (4,3) avoids dead ends and positions for eastward movement.\n- **Turn 57**: Move **R (right)** to (5,3).  \n  - *Reason*: From (4,3), direction is down (from previous move). Possible moves: L to (3,3) (safe), R to (5,3) (safe), D to (4,2) (safe but less efficient). Moving right to (5,3) advances toward (6,5) efficiently.\n- **Turn 58**: Move **R (right)** to (6,3).  \n  - *Reason*: From (5,3), direction is right. Possible moves: U to (5,4) (may be occupied but safe if tail; however, R to (6,3) is safer and direct). D to (5,2) is blocked by obstacle, L is reverse. (6,3) is free and adjacent to (6,4), preparing for (6,5).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 58, the head is at (6,3), adjacent to (6,4). \n- At turn 59, move U to (6,4) (safe, as (6,4) may be tail or free).\n- At turn 60, move U to (6,5) to eat the food (cell vacated, food present).\n- This plan avoids (6,2) due to time constraints but secures (6,5) with minimal risk, ensuring survival and score gain.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 55: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 56: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 57: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 58: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 55, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (3,4), and the direction is right (R). So the snake is moving right. The positions are: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]. That's 15 segments.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current one.\n\nNow, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\n- Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo, cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. And (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nBody: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nList all positions to avoid:\n\n(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (6,2) - life 4, so it will disappear after turn 58 (current turn 55, life 4: after 4 turns, on turn 59 it's gone? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 55, life span 4 means:\n\n- Turn 55: life span 4\n\n- Turn 56: life span 3\n\n- Turn 57: life span 2\n\n- Turn 58: life span 1\n\n- Turn 59: gone? Or after turn 58?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that on the turn when it's spawned, life span is N, then each turn it decreases by 1, and when life span reaches 0, it disappears. But when it reaches 0, is it still there or gone?\n\nTypically in such games, food is present until the turn when life span becomes 0, and it disappears at the start of that turn or end? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAssume that on turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So if L=1 on turn t, it will disappear after turn t, meaning not available on turn t+1.\n\nFor food at (6,2): life span 4 at turn 55. So:\n\n- Turn 55: life 4 (available)\n\n- Turn 56: life 3 (available)\n\n- Turn 57: life 2 (available)\n\n- Turn 58: life 1 (available)\n\n- Turn 59: life 0, disappears, not available.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): life span 7 at turn 55, so available until turn 61? Turn 55:7, 56:6, 57:5, 58:4, 59:3, 60:2, 61:1, 62:0 gone.\n\nTurn 55: life 7, so after 7 turns, on turn 62 it disappears? Let's calculate the last available turn.\n\nIf life span is L on turn t, it is available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears on turn t+L.\n\nFor (6,2): L=4 at t=55, available on turns 55,56,57,58. Gone on turn 59.\n\nFor (6,5): L=7 at t=55, available on turns 55 to 61 (7 turns: 55,56,57,58,59,60,61), gone on 62.\n\nFor (1,3): L=10 at t=55, available on turns 55 to 64, gone on 65.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,4), direction R (right). So possible moves: since moving right, can't go left (opposite) next turn? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so on next turn, cannot go L (left). Can go U, D, or R.\n\nBut I need to choose actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 55.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, where is the tail? Snake positions: head (3,4), then body, tail is last: (4,3). Positions list: index 0 is head, index 1 to 14 are body, so tail is (4,3).\n\nFood is at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3). (1,3) is a food position, but is it under the snake?\n\nLook at snake positions: (4,3) is the tail, and there's food at (1,3). (1,3) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(1,3) is not listed, so it's not under the snake body. Similarly, (6,2) and (6,5) are not in the positions, so all food is on free cells.\n\n(6,5) is food, but is it occupied? Snake has (6,5) in positions? Positions: ... (6,6), (6,5), ... yes, (6,5) is a body segment.\n\nFood at (6,5), and snake has a segment at (6,5). So food is under the body at (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is free, (6,2) is free.\n\nFood can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nNow, for turn 55, head at (3,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U (up to y+1), D (down to y-1), L (left to x-1), R (right to x+1).\n\nBut current direction R, so cannot go L (left) on this turn? No, the constraint is for the next turn, I think.\n\nLet's read: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nIt says \"on next turn\", meaning when choosing the action for turn t+1, you cannot choose opposite to the direction at turn t.\n\nBut for turn t, you can choose any direction except possibly if it causes collision, but the reverse constraint is for consecutive turns.\n\nAt turn t, you choose an action, which sets the direction for that turn.\n\nThen for turn t+1, you cannot choose the opposite of that direction.\n\nIn this case, at turn 55, current direction is R, which was the direction from previous turn. Now I choose action for turn 55, which will set the direction for turn 55.\n\nThen for turn 56, I cannot choose the opposite of turn 55's direction.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nBut since I need to plan multiple turns, I have to consider the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current head position (3,4):\n\n- U: (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by body? Positions: (3,5) is in the list, index 5? Let's see: positions: 0:(3,4), 1:(2,4), 2:(1,4), 3:(1,5), 4:(2,5), 5:(3,5), 6:(4,5), etc. So (3,5) is occupied by the body segment.\n\nSimilarly, D: (3,3) – is this free? Let's see if (3,3) is in positions or wall.\n\nPositions: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3) – no (3,3), so free? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so (3,3) is within bounds, not a wall, and not occupied, so possible.\n\nL: (2,4) – but (2,4) is the next body segment, position index 1, so occupied.\n\nR: (4,4) – is (4,4) occupied? Positions: not listed, walls: no, so free? Let's check: positions have (4,5), (5,5), etc., no (4,4). Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (5,2), so (4,4) should be free.\n\nBut is it adjacent to anything dangerous?\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,4):\n\n- U to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by body (index 5), so collision if move there. Not possible.\n\n- D to (3,3): free cell, no wall, not occupied.\n\n- L to (2,4): occupied by body (index 1), collision.\n\n- R to (4,4): free cell, no wall, not occupied.\n\nSo only possible moves are D or R.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so if I move R, direction stays R; if I move D, direction becomes D.\n\nNow, for the next turn, if I move R on turn 55, direction R, then on turn 56 I cannot go L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D, direction D, then on turn 56 cannot go U.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and risks.\n\nFood at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3).\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by snake body at (6,5), index 10? Positions: (6,6), (6,5), so (6,5) is body. Food is there, but since it's under body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves in.\n\nSimilarly, other food is free.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,3).\n\nNow, let's consider the two options for turn 55: D or R.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (4,4) on turn 55.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nNow, body will move: the tail end moves forward, so the segment at (4,3) will be removed when snake moves, but since we're moving to (4,4), and no food eaten, length unchanged.\n\nWhen snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail segment is removed.\n\nSo after move to (4,4), new positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) – tail was (4,3), but since moved, (5,3) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,6), 9: (6,6), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,4), 12: (5,4), 13: (5,3), 14: (4,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,4) (R), the new head is (4,4), then body segments take previous positions: segment 1 moves to where head was (3,4), segment 2 to where segment 1 was (2,4), and so on, up to segment 14 moves to where segment 13 was (5,3), and segment 13 was (5,3), segment 14 was (4,3), so segment 14 moves to (5,3)? Positions after move:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen:\n\n- Body 1: previous head position (3,4)\n\n- Body 2: previous (2,4)\n\n- Body 3: previous (1,4)\n\n- Body 4: previous (1,5)\n\n- Body 5: previous (2,5)\n\n- Body 6: previous (3,5)\n\n- Body 7: previous (4,5)\n\n- Body 8: previous (5,5)\n\n- Body 9: previous (5,6)\n\n- Body 10: previous (6,6)\n\n- Body 11: previous (6,5)  // but this is where food is, but body is moving away? Body 11 moves to previous position of body 10, which was (6,6)\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New position 0 (head): (4,4)\n\n- Pos 1: old pos 0 (3,4)\n\n- Pos 2: old pos 1 (2,4)\n\n- Pos 3: old pos 2 (1,4)\n\n- Pos 4: old pos 3 (1,5)\n\n- Pos 5: old pos 4 (2,5)\n\n- Pos 6: old pos 5 (3,5)\n\n- Pos 7: old pos 6 (4,5)\n\n- Pos 8: old pos 7 (5,5)\n\n- Pos 9: old pos 8 (5,6)\n\n- Pos 10: old pos 9 (6,6)\n\n- Pos 11: old pos 10 (6,5)  // now (6,5) is occupied by body pos 11\n\n- Pos 12: old pos 11 (6,4)\n\n- Pos 13: old pos 12 (5,4)\n\n- Pos 14: old pos 13 (5,3)  // new tail at (5,3)\n\nOld tail (4,3) is gone.\n\nFood at (6,5) is still there, under body pos 11 at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is now occupied, so food can't be eaten yet.\n\nHead is at (4,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (4,4):\n\n- U: (4,5) – but (4,5) is body pos 7? New positions: pos 7 is (4,5), occupied.\n\n- D: (4,3) – is this free? New positions: tail is at (5,3), and (4,3) is not occupied? Old tail (4,3) is gone, and (4,3) not in new positions, so free? But walls: no, so free.\n\n- L: (3,4) – body pos 1, occupied.\n\n- R: (5,4) – body pos 13? New pos 13 is (5,4), occupied.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nSo from (4,4):\n\n- U to (4,5): occupied by body pos 7\n\n- D to (4,3): not occupied, free\n\n- L to (3,4): occupied by body pos 1\n\n- R to (5,4): occupied by body pos 13\n\nSo only possible move is D to (4,3)\n\nThen on turn 56, I must move D to (4,3)\n\nBut (4,3) is free, so I can move there.\n\nThen after moving D to (4,3), new head at (4,3), which was free, no food, so no grow.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then body: old head (4,4), old body 1 (3,4), etc., up to old body 13 (5,4), and tail old body 14 (5,3) is gone? Old body 14 was (5,3), which is now the new position for body 13, but let's see.\n\nAfter move to (4,3):\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Body 1: old head (4,4)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 (3,4)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 (2,4)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 (1,4)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 (1,5)\n\n- Body 6: old body 5 (2,5)\n\n- Body 7: old body 6 (3,5)\n\n- Body 8: old body 7 (4,5)\n\n- Body 9: old body 8 (5,5)\n\n- Body 10: old body 9 (5,6)\n\n- Body 11: old body 10 (6,6)\n\n- Body 12: old body 11 (6,5)\n\n- Body 13: old body 12 (6,4)\n\n- Body 14: old body 13 (5,4)  // new tail at (5,4)\n\nAnd (5,3) is gone.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot go opposite to current direction, which is D, so cannot go U on next turn.\n\nCurrent position (4,3):\n\n- U to (4,4): but (4,4) is now body pos 1, occupied\n\n- D to (4,2): is this free? Walls: y=0 is wall, y=2 is not wall, x=4, not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2). Positions: not occupied, so free.\n\n- L to (3,3): free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n- R to (5,3): but (5,3) was old tail, now gone, but (5,3) is not in new positions? New positions: head (4,3), body up to (5,4), so (5,3) is free? But internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,3) is not obstacle. Walls: (5,2) is obstacle, so (5,3) should be free, but let's confirm.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2) is blocked, so (5,3) is not wall, and not occupied in current positions, so free.\n\nBut from (4,3):\n\n- U: (4,4) occupied\n\n- D: (4,2) free\n\n- L: (3,3) free\n\n- R: (5,3) free\n\nAnd since direction D, cannot go U next turn, but this is for turn 56, and we're planning turn 55 first.\n\nBut if I go R on turn 55 to (4,4), then I'm forced to go D to (4,3) on turn 56, then on turn 57 from (4,3), I can go D, L, or R, but not U.\n\nBut let's see if this is good.\n\nFirst, food: (6,2) is at (6,2), which is below, but with life 4, available until turn 58.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), currently occupied, but might be eatable if body moves away.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), far left.\n\nNow, if I go R on turn 55, I end up at (4,4), then must go D to (4,3) on turn 56, then from (4,3) I can go to (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free but (5,3) is near obstacle (5,2).\n\nBut let's think about getting food.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), I need to reach it by turn 58.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 56, I can go D to (4,2), then from there to (4,1) or (3,2) or (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, so not possible.\n\n(4,1) is wall? y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is invalid, y=0 is bottom wall.\n\nGrid: y=0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so (4,1) is wall, cannot go there.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) wall, L to (3,2), R to (5,2) obstacle. So only U or L from (4,2).\n\nNot good for reaching (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 56, if I go R to (5,3), then from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? On turn 56 after move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), etc, (5,4) is body pos 14, occupied.\n\nFrom (5,3): U to (5,4) occupied, D to (5,2) obstacle, L to (4,3) but that's head previous, not possible, R to (6,3) or something, but (5,3) to R is (6,3)? x+1=6, y=3.\n\n(6,3) is it free? Not occupied, not wall, x=6<7, y=3 between 0 and 7.\n\nSo from (5,3), if I go R to (6,3), possible.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go to (6,2) for food.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nIf on turn 55 I go R to (4,4), turn 56 go D to (4,3), then turn 57 I can go R to (5,3).\n\nThen from (5,3), turn 58 go R to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3), turn 59 go D to (6,2) to eat food, but (6,2) life span: at turn 55 life 4, turn 56 life 3, turn 57 life 2, turn 58 life 1, available on turn 58, so on turn 59 it would be gone? Turn 58 life 1, available, so on turn 58 I can eat it if I move to (6,2).\n\nBut from (6,3) on turn 59, but turn 58 is when I am at (6,3)? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 55: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 56: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 57: move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58: move R to (6,3)  // now at (6,3)\n\nBut food at (6,2) is available on turn 58, so to eat on turn 58, I need to be at (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nBut on turn 58 I am at (6,3), so I can go to (6,2) on turn 59, but on turn 59, food is gone (life 0 after turn 58), so I miss it.\n\nOn turn 58, I am moving to (6,3), not to (6,2).\n\nTo eat on turn 58, I need to be at (6,2) on turn 58, which means on turn 57 I should be adjacent to (6,2) and move to it on turn 58.\n\n(6,2) adjacent cells: (6,1) wall, (6,3), (5,2) obstacle, (7,2) wall. So only (6,3) is accessible adjacent cell.\n\nSo to eat on turn 58, I need to be at (6,3) on turn 57 and move to (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nBut on turn 57, from above, I am at (5,3) if I went that way.\n\nFrom turn 55 R to (4,4), turn 56 D to (4,3), turn 57: from (4,3) I can go to (5,3) on turn 57.\n\nThen on turn 57 at (5,3), I can go to (6,3) on turn 57? On turn 57, if I move to (6,3) from (5,3), but (5,3) to (6,3) is R, possible if not occupied.\n\nOn turn 57, after turn 56 move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 57, I move to (5,3), which is free, so new head (5,3), body follows, tail at (5,4) or something.\n\nThen from (5,3) on turn 58, I can move to (6,3), then on turn 59 to (6,2), but (6,2) gone on turn 59.\n\nTo eat on turn 58, I need to be at (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nSo I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 57, like (6,3), and move to (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nBut from the path, on turn 57 I can be at (5,3) or (4,2) or (3,3), not (6,3).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 57, I can only reach (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3), not (6,3) in one move.\n\n(6,3) is two moves away from (4,3).\n\nSo with this path, I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 58. Turn 55 to 58 is 4 turns, but from (3,4) to (6,2) is 3 steps: (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) but (5,4) occupied, so not direct.\n\nFrom (3,4) I can go D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I go R to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2) on turn 59, but food gone.\n\nTurn 55: start (3,4)\n\nTurn 55: move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 56: move to (4,3)\n\nTurn 57: move to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58: move to (6,3)\n\nTurn 59: move to (6,2) but food gone, and (6,2) might be wall or something, but it's within bounds, but no food.\n\nSo I miss (6,2) food.\n\nIf I go D on turn 55 to (3,3), let's consider that option.\n\nOption 2: on turn 55, move D to (3,3)\n\nHead to (3,3), direction D.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,3), body: old head (3,4), old body 1 (2,4), old body 2 (1,4), ..., up to old body 13 (5,4), old body 14 (4,3) is gone.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)  // new tail at (5,3)\n\nNow head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- U to (3,4): occupied by body pos 1\n\n- D to (3,2): free? Not wall, not occupied? Walls: y=2 not wall, x=3, not obstacle. Positions not occupied, so free.\n\n- L to (2,3): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- R to (4,3): free? But (4,3) was old tail, gone, and not in new positions, so free.\n\nNew positions have (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), etc., no (2,3) or (4,3), so both free.\n\nBut (4,3) is free, yes.\n\nAlso, food at (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go D to (3,2), L to (2,3), or R to (4,3).\n\nU is occupied.\n\nNow, direction is D, so for next turn, cannot go U.\n\nIf I go D to (3,2) on turn 55, then on turn 56 from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3) occupied, D to (3,1) wall, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) is near obstacle? (4,2) is free, not wall, not occupied.\n\nBut (3,1) is wall y=0.\n\nFrom (3,2): U occupied, D wall, so only L or R.\n\nBut let's think about food.\n\n(6,2) food: from (3,3), I can go to (3,2) on turn 55, then on turn 56 from (3,2) I can go R to (4,2) (since L to (2,2) also possible), say go R to (4,2), then on turn 57 from (4,2) I can go U to (4,3) or L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so only U or L.\n\nFrom (4,2) U to (4,3), which is free.\n\nThen from (4,3) on turn 58, I can go R to (5,3), then to (6,3) on turn 59, but (6,2) gone.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 56, if I go L to (2,2), then from (2,2) on turn 57, I can go to (2,1) wall, (2,3), (1,2), or (3,2).\n\n(2,3) or (1,2) etc, not closer to (6,2).\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (6,2) by turn 58 from current position in 4 turns with the body in the way.\n\nDistance from (3,4) to (6,2): Δx=3, Δy=2, so Manhattan distance 5, but with obstacles and body, it might take more turns.\n\nTurn 55 to 58 is 4 moves, but I need to be at (6,2) on or before turn 58.\n\nFrom (3,4), to (6,2), I can go R to (4,4), then R to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied on turn 55, not free.\n\nOn turn 55, from (3,4), (5,4) is occupied.\n\nOr go D to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then R to (4,2), then R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, not possible.\n\nOr from (3,3) go R to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then R to (5,2) obstacle.\n\nNo direct path.\n\nThe only way is to go via (6,3), but (6,3) is not adjacent to head now.\n\nSo it might not be possible to reach (6,2) in time, or it will be tight.\n\nLet's check if (5,4) or other cells are free later.\n\nPerhaps I should give up on (6,2) since life span is short and it's hard to reach.\n\nFocus on other food.\n\n(6,5) food at (6,5), life span 7, available until turn 61.\n\nBut it's currently under body at (6,5).\n\nTo eat it, the body must move away, and head move in.\n\nCurrently, on turn 55, (6,5) is occupied.\n\nAs snake moves, the body segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I move, the body at (6,5) might move to another position.\n\nIn the current state, position (6,5) is occupied by body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no one moves to (6,5), it might become free.\n\nFor example, if on turn 55 I move D to (3,3), then new positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nSo (6,5) is still occupied by body, now at index 11 or something.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R, same thing.\n\nThe body at (6,5) is part of the snake, and as the snake moves, it will stay until that segment moves.\n\nThe segment at (6,5) will move when the snake moves, to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, if I move down from (3,4) to (3,3), then the segment that was at (6,5) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (6,6), so (6,5) becomes free if no other segment moves there.\n\nLet's see the movement.\n\nAfter move D to (3,3):\n\n- Old positions: 0:(3,4), 1:(2,4), 2:(1,4), 3:(1,5), 4:(2,5), 5:(3,5), 6:(4,5), 7:(5,5), 8:(5,6), 9:(6,6), 10:(6,5), 11:(6,4), 12:(5,4), 13:(5,3), 14:(4,3)\n\nAfter move, head to (3,3), so new head (3,3)\n\nThen body:\n\n- Body 1: old head (3,4)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 (2,4)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 (1,4)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 (1,5)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 (2,5)\n\n- Body 6: old body 5 (3,5)\n\n- Body 7: old body 6 (4,5)\n\n- Body 8: old body 7 (5,5)\n\n- Body 9: old body 8 (5,6)\n\n- Body 10: old body 9 (6,6)\n\n- Body 11: old body 10 (6,5)  // this segment moves to old body 9 position (6,6), so body 11 at (6,6)\n\n- Body 12: old body 11 (6,4)  // moves to old body 10 position (6,5), so at (6,5)\n\n- Body 13: old body 12 (5,4)  // moves to old body 11 position (6,4), so at (6,4)\n\n- Body 14: old body 13 (5,3)  // moves to old body 12 position (5,4), so at (5,4)\n\nAnd old body 14 (4,3) gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n\n(6,5) is now occupied by body 12.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved R, similar thing.\n\nThe food at (6,5) is under the body, and it remains under as the body moves to that cell.\n\nTo eat it, I need the cell to be free and head to move there.\n\nThe body will move away only if the snake moves in a way that the segment leaves (6,5) and no other segment moves in.\n\nBut in the snake body, the segments are connected, so (6,5) might be occupied continuously unless the tail passes through or something.\n\nLet's see the tail.\n\nIn new positions, tail is at (5,3) after move D.\n\nAs I move, the tail will move, and eventually (6,5) might become free.\n\nBut it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps I can go towards the food at (1,3), which has long life span 10, so available until turn 64.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), and currently not occupied.\n\nFrom head (3,4), I can go L but L is occupied, or D to (3,3), then L to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n\nBut on turn 55, from (3,4), L to (2,4) occupied, so not possible directly.\n\nSo go D to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can go L to (2,3) or D to (3,2) etc.\n\nIf I go D to (3,3) on turn 55, then from (3,3) on turn 56, I can go L to (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 56, move L to (2,3), which is free, no food, so no grow.\n\nNew head (2,3), body follows.\n\nThen from (2,3) on turn 57, I can go L to (1,3) to eat food.\n\n(1,3) has value 1, positive, so eating it will increase length by 1.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,3) after turn 55 move.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3), the tail will not move, so new segment added.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 55: move D to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body as above, tail (5,3)\n\nFood at (1,3) is at (1,3), not under body.\n\nTurn 56: from (3,3) move L to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), body: old head (3,3), old body 1 (3,4), etc., up to old body 14 (5,3) moved to old body 13 position (5,4)? After turn 55 positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n\nTail is (5,3)\n\nMove to (2,3): new head (2,3)\n\nBody:\n\n- Body 1: old head (3,3)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 (3,4)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 (2,4)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 (1,4)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 (1,5)\n\n- Body 6: old body 5 (2,5)\n\n- Body 7: old body 6 (3,5)\n\n- Body 8: old body 7 (4,5)\n\n- Body 9: old body 8 (5,5)\n\n- Body 10: old body 9 (5,6)\n\n- Body 11: old body 10 (6,6)\n\n- Body 12: old body 11 (6,5)\n\n- Body 13: old body 12 (6,4)\n\n- Body 14: old body 13 (5,4)  // moved to old body 13 position (5,4), and old body 14 (5,3) is gone since no food eaten.\n\nNew tail at (5,4)\n\nHead at (2,3)\n\nNow turn 57: move to (1,3) to eat food.\n\n(1,3) is free, and food there, so move L to (1,3), eat food, length increases, so new head at (1,3), and the tail does not move, new body segment added at the tail position.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so tail stays in place.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\nMove to (1,3): new head (1,3)\n\nThen since food eaten, the body segments move, but tail does not remove, so new positions:\n\n- Head (1,3)\n\n- Body 1: old head (2,3)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 (3,3)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 (3,4)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 (2,4)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 (1,4)\n\n- Body 6: old body 5 (1,5)\n\n- Body 7: old body 6 (2,5)\n\n- Body 8: old body 7 (3,5)\n\n- Body 9: old body 8 (4,5)\n\n- Body 10: old body 9 (5,5)\n\n- Body 11: old body 10 (5,6)\n\n- Body 12: old body 11 (6,6)\n\n- Body 13: old body 12 (6,5)\n\n- Body 14: old body 13 (6,4)\n\n- Body 15: old body 14 (5,4)  // new segment, tail now at (5,4)\n\nLength increased to 16.\n\nNow, is there tail reward danger? When eating, head was at (2,3), tail at (5,4), not adjacent. (2,3) and (5,4) are not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nAfter eating, head at (1,3), which is corner, might be risky.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nNow, back to turn 55 choice.\n\nIf I go D on turn 55, I can reach (1,3) by turn 57 and eat it.\n\nIf I go R on turn 55, to (4,4), then I can go to other places.\n\nBut with R, I might not get food soon.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,5) that I might get later.\n\nBut (6,5) is under body, need to free it.\n\nAfter some moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, if I go towards the right, I can free (6,5).\n\nBut let's see the long term.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival.\n\nCurrent head position (3,4), surrounded by body, only D or R possible.\n\nIf I go D to (3,3), I can then go to (1,3) for food.\n\nIf I go R to (4,4), I can go to (4,3), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut in the R case, from (4,4) I must go D to (4,3), then from (4,3) I can go to (5,3) or (3,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I go to (5,3), then to (6,3), then I can go to (6,4) or (6,2) but (6,2) food might be gone.\n\n(6,4) is part of body, might be occupied.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should consider the state after a few moves.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,5) has life 7, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has life 10.\n\nBut (6,2) has only 4 life, and I may not reach it, so perhaps ignore it.\n\nFor survival, going to the left might be safer, as the right side has the body coiled.\n\nLook at snake positions: the snake is coiled around, with many segments on the right.\n\nFor example, positions like (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc, so the area around (5,5) to (6,6) is dense.\n\nLeft side, only (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), etc, less dense.\n\nSo moving left might open up space.\n\nIf I go D to (3,3), then L to (2,3), then to (1,3) for food.\n\nAfter that, I can go up or down from (1,3).\n\n(1,3) at x=1, y=3, walls at x=0, so can go U to (1,4), but (1,4) is body, or D to (1,2), etc.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head at (1,3), body at (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) - occupied by body? After eating, body includes (1,4)? In the positions after eating, body 5 is (1,4), so occupied.\n\nD to (1,2) - free, not wall, not occupied.\n\nL to (0,3) wall, not possible.\n\nR to (2,3) - occupied by body 1.\n\nSo only D to (1,2) possible.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut no immediate risk.\n\nIf I go R on turn 55, to (4,4), then D to (4,3), then if I go to (5,3), (5,3) is near the obstacle and body, might be riskier.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go to (6,3), then to (6,2) or (6,4), but (6,4) might be occupied.\n\nOn turn 58, (6,2) might be available, but as before, hard to reach.\n\nSince (6,2) is short-lived, and I may not reach it, I should focus on the other food for long-term.\n\nMoreover, eating (1,3) gives +1 score and length, which might help with survival.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 55.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turn 55, 56, etc., up to at least 5 turns ahead? The user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to list. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nBut I need to plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for now, I can decide the first few actions to get to a safer position.\n\nSince going for (1,3) seems feasible and low risk, I'll go with that.\n\nSo on turn 55, move D to (3,3)\n\nThen on turn 56, from (3,3) move L to (2,3)\n\nThen on turn 57, from (2,3) move L to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nAfter that, on turn 58, from (1,3) only move D to (1,2)\n\nThen on turn 59, from (1,2) I can move L to (0,2) wall? No, x=0 wall, so not possible. Or R to (2,2), or U to (1,3) but occupied, or D to (1,1) wall.\n\nFrom (1,2): possible moves: U to (1,3) occupied, D to (1,1) wall, L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2) free.\n\nSo only R to (2,2)\n\nThen from (2,2) on turn 60, I can move to (2,1) wall, (2,3), (1,2), or (3,2).\n\n(2,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 57, after eating at (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)\n\nTurn 58: move D to (1,2)\n\nNew head (1,2), body: old head (1,3), old body 1 (2,3), etc., up to old body 15 (5,4) moved, and since no food, tail removed? After eating at turn 57, length increased, so on turn 58, moving to (1,2), no food, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move turn 58: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)  // 16 segments\n\nMove to (1,2): new head (1,2)\n\nBody:\n\n- Body 1: old head (1,3)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 (2,3)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 (3,3)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 (3,4)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 (2,4)\n\n- Body 6: old body 5 (1,4)\n\n- Body 7: old body 6 (1,5)\n\n- Body 8: old body 7 (2,5)\n\n- Body 9: old body 8 (3,5)\n\n- Body 10: old body 9 (4,5)\n\n- Body 11: old body 10 (5,5)\n\n- Body 12: old body 11 (5,6)\n\n- Body 13: old body 12 (6,6)\n\n- Body 14: old body 13 (6,5)\n\n- Body 15: old body 14 (6,4)  // and old body 15 (5,4) gone\n\nNew tail at (6,4)\n\nHead at (1,2)\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2) only move R to (2,2) (since U occupied, D wall, L wall)\n\nNew head (2,2)\n\nBody follows.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems safe for now.\n\nIf I go R first, I might get stuck or have fewer options.\n\nSo I think moving D on turn 55 is better.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, I can list turns 55 to 60.\n\nTurn 55: D\n\nTurn 56: L (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 57: L (to (1,3) eat)\n\nTurn 58: D (to (1,2))\n\nTurn 59: R (to (2,2))\n\nThen turn 60: from (2,2), possible moves U to (2,3) which is body, or D to (2,1) wall, L to (1,2) occupied, R to (3,2) free.\n\nSo on turn 60, I can go R to (3,2) or U but U might be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 59, head at (2,2), body: after move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) // tail at (6,5) or something.\n\nNot necessary for now.\n\nI think for the sequence, I can output up to turn 59 or 60.\n\nBut let's confirm the food at (6,5).\n\nAfter some moves, it might be available.\n\nBut for now, this plan gets me one food and opens space.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 55 to turn 60) while considering the current state:\n- **Grid and Walls**: The grid is 8x8 (coordinates (0,0) to (7,7)), with border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). These are deadly and must be avoided.\n- **Snake State**: \n  - Head at (3,4) with current direction \"R\" (right).\n  - Body segments: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] (15 segments, tail at (4,3)).\n  - Movement constraints: Cannot reverse direction instantly (e.g., from R to L on the next turn).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 4 (available until turn 58; disappears on turn 59).\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 7 (available until turn 61; disappears on turn 62). Currently under the snake body at (6,5) and can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n  - (1,3): Value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 64; disappears on turn 65). Accessible and not under the body.\n\n**Key Risks and Opportunities**:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 55)**: From (3,4), possible moves are:\n  - U (to (3,5)): Occupied by body, deadly collision.\n  - D (to (3,3)): Free, safe.\n  - L (to (2,4)): Occupied by body, deadly collision.\n  - R (to (4,4)): Free, safe.\n  - Both D and R are safe, but R leads to a more confined area with body coiling, increasing long-term risk. D opens a path to (1,3) food.\n- **Food Prioritization**:\n  - (6,2): Short life span (only 4 turns left), but difficult to reach by turn 58 due to body obstacles and Manhattan distance (3 steps needed, but paths are blocked). Not worth the risk; likely unreachable.\n  - (6,5): Under body; requires freeing the cell first. With life span 7, it can be targeted later.\n  - (1,3): High life span (10 turns), easily reachable in 2 moves (via (3,3) and (2,3)) with low risk. Eating it increases length and score.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: The right side (x>3) has dense body coiling, increasing collision risk. Moving left towards (1,3) opens space and reduces immediate threats. After eating (1,3), the snake can navigate south to avoid dead ends.\n- **5-Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 55**: Move D to (3,3) to start path towards (1,3) and avoid right-side risks.\n  - **Turn 56**: Move L to (2,3) to approach (1,3).\n  - **Turn 57**: Move L to (1,3) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 16). No tail reward danger (tail at (5,4) is not adjacent).\n  - **Turn 58**: From (1,3), only safe move is D to (1,2) (U, L, R blocked by body or walls).\n  - **Turn 59**: From (1,2), only safe move is R to (2,2) (U, D, L blocked by body or walls).\n  - **Beyond Turn 60**: From (2,2), possible moves include U (to (2,3), may be occupied), D (to (2,1), wall), L (to (1,2), occupied), or R (to (3,2), free). R to (3,2) is safe and explores open space. (6,5) food can be targeted later if freed.\n\nThis plan secures one food immediately, avoids short-lived food that is high-risk, and prioritizes open areas for survival. Actions are chosen to prevent collisions and reversals.\n\n### Actions for Turns 55 to 60\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 55: D (down)  \nTurn 56: L (left)  \nTurn 57: L (left)  \nTurn 58: D (down)  \nTurn 59: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 56, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 cells long.\n\nSnake head direction is D, which is down. So, moving down means increasing y? No, let's clarify coordinates. Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U is up (increasing y), D is down (decreasing y). But in the position list, let's see.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,3), then (3,4) which is up, then (2,4) left, then (1,4) left, then (1,5) up, and so on. Since head is at (3,3) and moving down, but down is decreasing y, so from (3,3) moving down would go to (3,2), but the next position is (3,4), which has higher y, so that's up. I think I have a confusion.\n\nHead direction is given as D, down. But the positions: head at (3,3), next segment at (3,4). If head is moving down to (3,2), but the next segment is at (3,4), which is above? That doesn't make sense for movement.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Snake positions are listed from head to tail. So head is (3,3), then the first body segment is (3,4), which means the snake was previously at (3,4) and moved to (3,3)? But head direction is D, down.\n\nLet's think about the movement. If the head is moving down (D), that means from the previous position, it moved to the current head position by decreasing y.\n\nBut in the list, positions are given in order: head, then segment 1, segment 2, etc., to tail.\n\nSo at turn 56, head is at (3,3), and it just moved there. Since direction is D, down, that means it came from (3,4), because down from (3,4) to (3,3) decreases y.\n\nBut in the list, (3,4) is the first body segment, which matches; it's the position right behind the head.\n\nThen next is (2,4), which is left of (3,4), then (1,4), left again, then (1,5), up, etc.\n\nSo the tail is at (5,3).\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (6,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 56, life span 3, so it will be gone by turn 59? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if at turn t, life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=3 at turn 56, then after turn 56, countdown to 2, after turn 57 to 1, after turn 58 to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 56,57,58, but not on 59.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) L=6, so disappears after turn 61, (1,3) L=9, disappears after turn 64.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, at least 5 turns ahead. So I should plan moves for turn 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, and so on, but since the state might change, I need to think in terms of strategy.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for multiple turns, like Turn 56: action, Turn 57: action, etc. But I need to specify for at least the immediate turns with the current information.\n\nAlso, I must avoid collisions: with walls, with body, except that I can move into the tail cell because the tail moves, but I need to be careful about tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because the head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,3). What cells are adjacent to tail? (5,3) has neighbors: (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3). But (5,4) is part of the body, not tail. Tail is only the last segment.\n\nSnake positions: tail is the last one, (5,3). So adjacent cells to tail are (5,4) north, (5,2) south, (4,3) west, (6,3) east.\n\nNow, is there food on the tail? Currently, food is at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3). None of these are at (5,3), so no food on tail now. But if food spawns there later, but we don't have info on new food, only current.\n\nThe state gives current food, so I have to work with that.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Let's see the positions: snake has x from 1 to 6, y from 3 to 6, so yes, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nAlso, walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are all walls, cannot move there.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,3), direction down. So from (3,3), moving down would go to (3,2), but let's see what's possible.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): since direction is down, I cannot move up (opposite direction) instantly, but I can move left, right, or down? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) on the next turn because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (3,2)\n\n- Left: to (2,3)\n\n- Right: to (4,3)\n\nCannot move up to (3,4) because that's opposite to current down direction.\n\n(3,4) is occupied by the body, but even if not, I cannot move opposite direction.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each move for safety and food access.\n\nFirst, let's find where the body is to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (3,3) head\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (6,6)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,3) tail\n\nNow, (5,4) and (5,3) are both occupied, but (5,4) is body, (5,3) tail.\n\nTail is at (5,3).\n\nNow, for movement from head (3,3):\n\nPossible cells to move:\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3)\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nNow, check if these are safe:\n\nFirst, (3,2): is it wall? x=3, y=2. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (3,2). So not wall. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,2) not in list, so free. But need to ensure that moving there doesn't cause immediate collision.\n\nMoving to (3,2) should be safe as long as no body is there, which it isn't.\n\nBut after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food, else tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): x=2,y=3, not wall, not occupied.\n\n(4,3): x=4,y=3, not wall, not occupied.\n\nSo all three moves are possible without immediate collision.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (6,2) with L=3, so must be eaten by turn 58 or it disappears.\n\n- (6,5) with L=6, more time\n\n- (1,3) with L=9, plenty of time.\n\n(1,3) is close to head? Head at (3,3), so (1,3) is left, but there are body segments in between.\n\nPath to (1,3): from (3,3), left to (2,3), then left to (1,3). But (1,3) has food, and it's not occupied now? Snake has (1,4) and (1,5), but (1,3) is free? Positions: (1,4) and (1,5) are occupied, but (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) and (6,5) are food.\n\n(6,5) is listed as food, but in snake positions, (6,5) is occupied by body? Snake has (6,5) as a segment.\n\nFood positions: (6,5) is one, but snake has (6,5) in positions, so how can food be there?\n\nPerhaps food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is occupied by snake body, so the food is under the body, but not accessible until the snake moves away from that cell.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (6,2) is not occupied, (1,3) is not occupied.\n\n(6,5) is occupied, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the segment at (6,5) moves away, then head can move there.\n\nBut (6,5) is part of the body, not tail.\n\nTail is at (5,3).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food with short life span: (6,2) with L=3, must be eaten soon or lost.\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nHead at (3,3), so distance: |3-6|=3 in x, |3-2|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 4, but with obstacles.\n\nPath to (6,2): from (3,3), one way is down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\n(5,2) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSo from (3,2), cannot go directly to (4,2) because (4,2) might be free, but to (5,2) blocked, so to reach (6,2), need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), right to (4,2), but then (5,2) blocked, so cannot go east to (5,2). Must go south or north, but y=2 is low, walls at y=0.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are playable, y=0 is wall.\n\nSo from (4,2), can go down to (4,1), but y=1, then east to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2). But (6,1) is not wall? y=1 is not y=0, so y=1 to 6 are playable, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 to 6.\n\nSo from (4,2), to (6,2): (4,2) to (5,2) blocked, so must go to (4,1) or (4,3), then to (5,1) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) is tail now.\n\nAnother way: from (3,3) go right to (4,3), then down to (4,2), same issue.\n\nOr from (3,3) go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), (4,2), etc., but that might be longer.\n\nShortest path to (6,2) avoiding obstacle.\n\nSince (5,2) blocked, need to go below or above.\n\nBelow: y=1, above y=3.\n\ny=3 has snake body.\n\nHead at (3,3), (6,2) at y=2.\n\nSo perhaps: (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> now from (4,2), cannot go (5,2), so go down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2). That's 4 moves from head position.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2) is one, (4,2) two, (4,1) three, (5,1) four, (6,1) five, (6,2) six. But head at (3,3), moving to (3,2) is turn 56, then to (4,2) turn 57, to (4,1) turn 58, to (5,1) turn 59, to (6,1) turn 60, to (6,2) turn 61. But food at (6,2) has life span 3 at turn 56, so disappears after turn 58. So it can be eaten on turn 56,57,58. By turn 58, if head is at (6,2), it can be eaten.\n\nBut from above, to reach (6,2) by turn 58, it must be there on or before turn 58.\n\nTurn 56: at (3,3)\n\nIf move down to (3,2) on turn 56.\n\nThen from (3,2), on turn 57, I can move right to (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), on turn 58, I can move down to (4,1), but (4,1) is not (6,2), so on turn 58, I am at (4,1), not at (6,2), so cannot eat on turn 58.\n\nIf from (4,2) on turn 58, I go to (4,3) or something, but not to (6,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 57, if I go to (4,2), then on turn 58 to (5,2) is blocked, so impossible to reach (6,2) by turn 58 from here.\n\nAlternative path: from (3,3) move right to (4,3) on turn 56.\n\nThen on turn 57, move down to (4,2).\n\nSame as above, stuck at (4,2) on turn 57, then on turn 58 to (4,1) or (4,3), not to (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 57, I could move right to (5,3), but (5,3) is tail now.\n\nTail at (5,3), and it will move when the snake moves.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf I move to (4,3) on turn 56, then to (5,3) on turn 57.\n\n(5,3) is tail, so when I move to (5,3), since it's tail, and I eat if food, but there is no food at (5,3), so I just move, tail moves away, so it's safe.\n\nThen from (5,3), on turn 58, I can move down to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle! Blocked, cannot move there.\n\nOr move right to (6,3), or up to (5,4), but (5,4) is body.\n\nPositions: (5,4) is occupied.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: down to (5,2) blocked, up to (5,4) occupied by body, left to (4,3) but that's where I came from, but in terms of direction, current direction would be R if I moved right to (5,3).\n\nLet's track direction.\n\nStart: head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nIf move right to (4,3) on turn 56, direction changes to R.\n\nThen from (4,3), move to (5,3) on turn 57, direction still R or now E, but same.\n\n(5,3) is tail, so moving to it is ok, tail moves to previous position or something.\n\nAfter move, snake grows only if food eaten, else tail removed.\n\nBut here, no food, so tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 56 move to (4,3), head at (4,3), body: the old head (3,3) becomes body, and so on, tail (5,3) might move or not.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nPositions: after move to (4,3), new head (4,3), then previous head (3,3) becomes first body, then (3,4), (2,4), etc., up to (5,3) as tail? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 56 start: positions: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (2,4), ..., (5,4), (5,3) tail.\n\nIf I move right to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nThen the body segments: the first body segment is the old head (3,3), then (3,4), then (2,4), ..., up to the second last, which is (5,4)? List indices.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (1,4), 4: (1,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,6), 10: (6,6), 11: (6,5), 12: (6,4), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,3), new position list: head (4,3), then body 0: (3,3) [old head], body 1: (3,4), body 2: (2,4), body 3: (1,4), body 4: (1,5), body 5: (2,5), body 6: (3,5), body 7: (4,5), body 8: (5,5), body 9: (5,6), body 10: (6,6), body 11: (6,5), body 12: (6,4), body 13: (5,4), and tail is (5,3), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new tail is body 13: (5,4)? When tail is removed, the last segment is gone.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,3), then the segments from old body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So 14 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,2), new head (3,2), body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), ..., up to (5,4), and tail (5,3) removed, so tail at (5,4).\n\nBack to reaching (6,2).\n\nIt seems impossible to reach (6,2) by turn 58 because of the obstacle at (5,2) and the short time.\n\nMinimum path: from (3,3) to (6,2) with (5,2) blocked.\n\nPossible paths: via (4,3)-(5,3)-(6,3)-(6,2) or (3,2)-(4,2)-(4,1)-(5,1)-(6,1)-(6,2), etc.\n\nFirst path: (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nThat's 3 moves: turn 56 to (4,3), turn 57 to (5,3), turn 58 to (6,3), then turn 59 to (6,2). But on turn 58, at (6,3), not (6,2), and food disappears after turn 58, so cannot eat on turn 59. Turn 58 is the last chance, but on turn 58 I am at (6,3), not (6,2).\n\nIf I go directly, but from (5,3) to (6,2) is diagonal, not possible, only adjacent.\n\nSo must go to (6,3) then (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 58, if I am at (6,3), I can move to (6,2) on turn 58 only if I start from closer.\n\nTurn 56: at (3,3)\n\nTurn 56 move to (4,3) or (3,2) or (2,3)\n\nIf to (4,3), turn 57 to (5,3), turn 58 to (6,3), then on turn 58 I am at (6,3), and I can move to (6,2) on turn 58? No, the move is on the turn, so on turn 58, I move from current position to new position.\n\nOn turn 58, if I am at (6,3), I can move to (6,2) on that turn, so I arrive at (6,2) on turn 58, which is within life span.\n\nLife span: at turn 56, L=3, so can be eaten on turn 56,57,58.\n\nOn turn 58, if I move to (6,2), I eat it.\n\nBut to be at (6,3) on turn 57 or something.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 56: start at (3,3), move to (4,3) — arrive at (4,3) end of turn 56.\n\nTurn 57: at (4,3), move to (5,3) — arrive at (5,3) end of turn 57.\n\nTurn 58: at (5,3), move to (6,3) — arrive at (6,3) end of turn 58.\n\nBut (6,3) is not (6,2), so I need to move to (6,2) on turn 58, but from (5,3), I can move to (6,3), (5,4), (5,2) blocked, or (4,3).\n\nI cannot move directly to (6,2) from (5,3); it's not adjacent.\n\n(5,3) to (6,2) is not horizontal or vertical, so not possible.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can only go to (6,3), (5,4), or (4,3), or down but blocked.\n\nSo on turn 58, I can be at (6,3), but not at (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 59, I can move from (6,3) to (6,2), but food is gone by then.\n\nSimilarly, if I go via south: turn 56 to (3,2), turn 57 to (4,2), turn 58 to (4,1) or (4,3), not (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 58, I can go to (4,1), then turn 59 to (5,1), etc., too late.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (6,2) by turn 58 with the current position and obstacle.\n\nTherefore, the food at (6,2) cannot be eaten; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSo I should ignore that food and focus on other opportunities.\n\nNow, other food: (6,5) with L=6, so until turn 62 (since turn 56+6-1=61? L=6 at turn 56, disappears after turn 61, so can be eaten turns 56 to 61.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) with L=9, turns 56 to 64.\n\nBut (6,5) is currently occupied by snake body, at position index 11: (6,5).\n\nSo to eat it, I need the snake to move away from (6,5), then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly, the body will move over time.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,3), and will move.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends or collisions.\n\nFirst, let's consider the snake's current shape.\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (5,3), and the snake is coiled.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down to (3,2) might be good to explore south area.\n\nMoving left to (2,3) towards (1,3) food.\n\nMoving right to (4,3) towards the east.\n\n(1,3) food is close, at (1,3), and head at (3,3), so I can go left to (2,3) then to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is adjacent to (1,4) which is body, but if I move to (1,3), and it's free, I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nPath to (1,3): from (3,3), move left to (2,3) on turn 56, then left to (1,3) on turn 57.\n\nOn turn 57, arrive at (1,3), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nFirst, when I move to (2,3) on turn 56, is it safe? (2,3) is not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen to (1,3) on turn 57, (1,3) not occupied now.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut need to check if after moving, I have space to move away.\n\nAlso, the area around: (1,3) has neighbors: (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,3).\n\n(0,3) is wall, x=0.\n\n(1,4) is body segment, occupied.\n\n(2,3) will be body after I move to (1,3).\n\n(1,2) is free? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 56 move to (2,3): new head (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., up to (5,4), tail at (5,3) removed? No food, so tail removed.\n\nPositions: after turn 56 move left to (2,3):\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nThen old head (3,3) becomes body\n\nThen (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and old tail (5,3) removed, so new tail is (5,4).\n\nList: indices: new 0: (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,6), 11: (6,6), 12: (6,5), 13: (6,4), 14: (5,4) tail. 15 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nThen turn 57, move to (1,3) from (2,3).\n\n(1,3) has food, so move to (1,3), eat food, snake grows, so tail not removed.\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThen body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and new segment, so tail remains (5,4), but with growth, the tail stays, and new head added.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head at (1,3), then the previous segments: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), so now 16 segments, tail at (5,4).\n\nNow, head at (1,3), which is corner, with walls at x=0 and y=0 nearby.\n\nPossible moves from (1,3): cannot move left to (0,3) wall, cannot move up to (1,4) because (1,4) is body, and also if direction, but let's see.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), the direction would be L (left), since from (2,3) to (1,3).\n\nSo current direction L.\n\nCannot move right (opposite).\n\nCan move down to (1,2), or up to (1,4) but occupied, or left to wall, so only possible move is down to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) should be free.\n\nThen move to (1,2) on next turn.\n\nBut (1,2) is near wall, and I have to go down or right, but right to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) might be free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut the snake is long, and I need to avoid boxing myself.\n\nSince I ate food, the tail didn't move, so the body is still there.\n\nNow, the food at (6,5) might be accessible later.\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied, but as the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is eaten soon if I go left.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAnother food at (6,5), which has more time.\n\nBut let's see the grid and snake position.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the right and top, with tail at (5,4) or something.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), head at (1,3), then must go down to (1,2), then to (2,2) or (1,1), etc.\n\n(1,1) is corner, might be risky.\n\n(2,2) is free now.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut there is the obstacle at (5,2), so south area might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (1,3) immediately, but go for the center or something.\n\nAnother option: move down to (3,2) to explore south.\n\nOr move right to (4,3) to go east.\n\nNow, (6,5) food is at (6,5), occupied, but I can plan to eat it later.\n\nLife span 6, so by turn 61.\n\nHow to free (6,5).\n\nCurrently, (6,5) is occupied by body segment.\n\nThe tail is at (5,3), moving to other positions.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body will shift.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,2) on turn 56.\n\nThen new head (3,2), body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,3) removed, so tail at (5,4).\n\nNow, (6,5) is still occupied, by the segment that was at (6,6) or something.\n\nPositions: new 0: (3,2), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,6), 11: (6,6), 12: (6,5), 13: (6,4), 14: (5,4) tail.\n\n(6,5) is index 12, occupied.\n\nTo free (6,5), I need the snake to move so that this segment moves away.\n\nBut it's not tail, so it will move when the head moves.\n\nThe position (6,5) will be free when the segment that is there moves to another cell.\n\nFor example, if the head moves in a way that the body shifts, eventually that segment will become tail and move away.\n\nBut it might take many moves.\n\nThe segment at (6,5) is not near tail; tail is at (5,4).\n\nThe tail will move next time if no food eaten.\n\nFrom above, after turn 56, tail at (5,4).\n\nThen if I move, tail moves.\n\nBut the segment at (6,5) is fixed until the snake moves.\n\nEach time the head moves, all body segments shift to the next position.\n\nSo the cell (6,5) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves to the next cell in the chain.\n\nFor example, in the position list, index 12 is at (6,5), it will move to where index 11 was or something.\n\nLet's think: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for cell (6,5), it is occupied by the segment that was at that position, but when the snake moves, that segment will move to the position of the segment before it in the list.\n\nIn the list, the body segments are ordered from head to tail.\n\nWhen head moves to new position, the first body segment takes the old head position, the second takes the old first body position, and so on, tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSo for a specific cell, it becomes free when the segment that was there moves to a different position.\n\nFor example, (6,5) is currently occupied by index 12.\n\nAfter head moves, index 12 will move to the position of index 11, which is (6,6), so (6,5) is now occupied by the segment that was at (6,4)? Let's not confuse.\n\nAfter a move, the positions are updated.\n\nFor instance, after turn 56 move down to (3,2), new positions:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Body1: old head (3,3)\n\n- Body2: old body1 (3,4)\n\n- Body3: old body2 (2,4)\n\n- Body4: old body3 (1,4)\n\n- Body5: old body4 (1,5)\n\n- Body6: old body5 (2,5)\n\n- Body7: old body6 (3,5)\n\n- Body8: old body7 (4,5)\n\n- Body9: old body8 (5,5)\n\n- Body10: old body9 (5,6)\n\n- Body11: old body10 (6,6)\n\n- Body12: old body11 (6,5)\n\n- Body13: old body12 (6,4)\n\n- Tail: old body13 (5,4), and old tail (5,3) removed.\n\nSo now (6,5) is occupied by body12, which is old body11 (6,6) moved to (6,5)? In the new list, body12 is at (6,5), which was occupied by old body11.\n\nBut the cell (6,5) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n\nTo free the cell (6,5), I need the segment that is there to move away, which means that in the position list, that segment must be assigned to a different cell.\n\nIt will be free when the tail or some segment leaves it.\n\nSpecifically, (6,5) will be free when the segment that was at (6,5) in the previous state moves to a new position, but since all segments move, it's when that particular cell is no longer occupied after the move.\n\nIn this case, after the move, (6,5) is still occupied.\n\nIt might take several moves for the occupation to change.\n\nThe food at (6,5) can be eaten only when the snake body is not on that cell, so I need to move in a way that the body leaves (6,5).\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take time.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (5,4), and I can move to free the tail area.\n\nBut (6,5) is not tail.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the tail to shorten the path or something.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (1,3) is easier to get, and I can eat it quickly.\n\nThen after that, I can navigate to other areas.\n\nBut after eating (1,3), I am at (1,3) with only down move possible, to (1,2), then from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is corner, (2,2) is better.\n\nThen from (2,2), to (3,2) or (2,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) might be body or not, but after moves, it changes.\n\nLet's simulate going for (1,3).\n\nTurn 56: move left to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail. (5,3) removed.\n\nTurn 57: move left to (1,3), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nNew head (1,3), body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and no tail removal, so positions include (5,4), 16 segments.\n\nTail at (5,4).\n\nHead at (1,3), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,2), or up to (1,4) but occupied, left to wall, right to (2,3) occupied, so only down to (1,2).\n\nTurn 58: move down to (1,2)\n\nNew head (1,2), body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail. No growth, so tail removed? Moved to (1,2), but no food at (1,2), so tail is removed, new tail is the last body segment.\n\nAfter move to (1,2), no food, so tail removed.\n\nOld positions: head was (1,3), body segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,2), new head (1,2), then body: old head (1,3), then old body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), and old tail (5,4) removed, so new tail is (6,4).\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body1 (1,3), body2 (2,3), body3 (3,3), body4 (3,4), body5 (2,4), body6 (1,4), body7 (1,5), body8 (2,5), body9 (3,5), body10 (4,5), body11 (5,5), body12 (5,6), body13 (6,6), body14 (6,5), body15 (6,4) tail.\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nHead at (1,2), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1), right to (2,2), up to (1,3) occupied, left to wall.\n\n(1,1) and (2,2) are free.\n\n(1,1) is corner, (2,2) is open.\n\nBetter to go to (2,2) to avoid corner.\n\nTurn 59: move right to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) tail. No food, tail removed, new tail (6,5)? Old tail (6,4) removed, new tail is the last, which was (6,5), but in list, body15 was (6,4), removed, so new tail is body14 (6,5).\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body1 (1,2), body2 (1,3), body3 (2,3), body4 (3,3), body5 (3,4), body6 (2,4), body7 (1,4), body8 (1,5), body9 (2,5), body10 (3,5), body11 (4,5), body12 (5,5), body13 (5,6), body14 (6,6), body15 (6,5) tail.\n\nTail at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is food, but it's under the tail now? Tail is at (6,5), and there is food there.\n\nBut food can be eaten only if head moves there, not if it's under body.\n\nCurrently, (6,5) is occupied by tail, and food is there.\n\nTo eat it, the tail must move away, then head move there.\n\nBut tail will move when the snake moves without eating.\n\nIn this position, tail at (6,5), if I move and no food, tail moves away.\n\nFor example, from head at (2,2), I can move to (3,2), (2,3), or (2,1), etc.\n\n(2,3) is body, occupied by body3 (2,3), so cannot move there.\n\n(2,1) down, or (3,2) right, or (1,2) but occupied or wall, only (2,1) and (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is free, (3,2) free.\n\nSay move to (3,2) on turn 59.\n\nThen new head (3,2), body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail. No food, tail removed, new tail (6,6).\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body1 (2,2), body2 (1,2), body3 (1,3), body4 (2,3), body5 (3,3), body6 (3,4), body7 (2,4), body8 (1,4), body9 (1,5), body10 (2,5), body11 (3,5), body12 (4,5), body13 (5,5), body14 (5,6), body15 (6,6) tail.\n\nTail at (6,6).\n\n(6,5) is now free, since tail moved to (6,6), and food is at (6,5), so it can be eaten.\n\nBut head is at (3,2), far away.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 6 at turn 56, so at turn 59, how much left?\n\nTurn 56: L=6\n\nAfter turn 56, L=5\n\nTurn 57, L=4\n\nTurn 58, L=3\n\nTurn 59, L=2, so can be eaten on turn 59 or 60, etc.\n\nOn turn 59, head at (3,2), (6,5) is free, but I am at (3,2), far.\n\nTo reach (6,5) from (3,2): with obstacle at (5,2), so path like (3,2)-(4,2) but (4,2) to (5,2) blocked, so go to (3,3) or (4,1), etc.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (6,5): |3-6|=3, |2-5|=3, distance 6, but with detour around (5,2).\n\ne.g. (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,4) to (6,5), or shorter, but (4,2) to (5,2) blocked, so must go via (4,3) or (3,3).\n\n(3,2) to (4,2) turn, then to (4,3) turn, to (5,3) turn, to (6,3) turn, to (6,4) turn, to (6,5) turn. 5 moves from (3,2).\n\nOn turn 59, at (3,2), move to (4,2) turn 60, to (4,3) turn 61, to (5,3) turn 62, to (6,3) turn 63, to (6,4) turn 64, to (6,5) turn 65. But L=2 at turn 59, so disappears after turn 60? Let's calculate life span.\n\nAt turn 56, food (6,5) L=6, so after turn 56, L=5, after turn 57, L=4, after turn 58, L=3, after turn 59, L=2, after turn 60, L=1, after turn 61, L=0 and disappears. So can be eaten on turns 56 to 61.\n\nOn turn 61, if head is at (6,5), it can be eaten.\n\nBut from above, on turn 61, if I am at (4,3) or something, not at (6,5).\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 59, I can move to (3,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,5) by turn 61.\n\nTurn 59: at (3,2)\n\nTurn 60: to (4,2) or to (3,3)\n\nIf to (4,2), then turn 61: from (4,2), can go to (4,3) or (4,1), not directly to (6,5).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (6,5) in one move? No, impossible.\n\nOn turn 61, I can be at (5,3) or something.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 60, to (4,3) on turn 61, then to (5,3) on turn 62, too late.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 59 to (3,3), then turn 60 to (4,3), turn 61 to (5,3), not (6,5).\n\nTo reach (6,5) by turn 61, I need to be closer.\n\nBut on turn 59, I am at (3,2), too far.\n\nIn the scenario where I went for (1,3), I am at (3,2) on turn 59, and (6,5) disappears after turn 61, so I can reach it only if I move faster, but I can't.\n\nMin distance from (3,2) to (6,5) is 6 cells, 6 moves, by turn 65, too late.\n\nSo (6,5) cannot be eaten if I go for (1,3) first.\n\nBut in this case, I already ate (1,3), so I have +1 score.\n\nThen I can try for other food, but (6,5) will be lost.\n\nThere might be new food later, but I have to work with current state.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (6,5) first.\n\nBut (6,5) is occupied, so I need to free it.\n\nFrom initial position, head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nIf I move right to (4,3) on turn 56.\n\nNew head (4,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,3) removed, tail at (5,4).\n\n(6,5) is still occupied.\n\nThen turn 57, from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2), or up to (4,4), or right to (5,3), or left to (3,3) but occupied.\n\n(4,4) might be free? Positions: not listed, so free.\n\n(4,2) free, (5,3) is tail? Tail is at (5,4), (5,3) is free now.\n\nAfter turn 56, tail at (5,4), (5,3) is free.\n\nSo from (4,3), move to (5,3) on turn 57.\n\nArrive at (5,3), no food, so tail removed.\n\nNew head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) tail removed, new tail (6,4).\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body1 (4,3), body2 (3,3), body3 (3,4), body4 (2,4), body5 (1,4), body6 (1,5), body7 (2,5), body8 (3,5), body9 (4,5), body10 (5,5), body11 (5,6), body12 (6,6), body13 (6,5), body14 (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,5) is occupied by body13.\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction R (right).\n\nPossible moves: down to (5,2) but blocked, up to (5,4) occupied, left to (4,3) occupied, right to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is free? Not wall, not occupied, so can move to (6,3).\n\nTurn 58: move right to (6,3)\n\nNew head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) tail.

In positions, (6,4) was body14, but now tail is at (6,5), so (6,4) is free? Let's see positions: head at (6,3), body at (5,3), (4,3), etc., down to (6,5) tail. So (6,4) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) free.\n\nSo from (6,3), move to (6,4) on turn 58.\n\nArrive at (6,4), no food, so tail removed.\n\nNew head (6,4), body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail removed, new tail (6,6).\n\nPositions: head (6,4), body1 (6,3), body2 (5,3), body3 (4,3), body4 (3,3), body5 (3,4), body6 (2,4), body7 (1,4), body8 (1,5), body9 (2,5), body10 (3,5), body11 (4,5), body12 (5,5), body13 (5,6), body14 (6,6) tail.\n\n(6,5) is now free, and food is there.\n\nOn turn 59, from (6,4), I can move down to (6,3) but occupied, or up to (6,5), or left to (5,4), or right to wall.\n\n(6,5) is free, so move up to (6,5) on turn 59, eat food.\n\nL=6 at turn 56, on turn 59, L=3, so can eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo by going right and then to the east, I can free and eat (6,5) by turn 59.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (1,3) has L=9, so I can go for it later.\n\nSo this seems better.\n\nI can eat both foods.\n\nFirst, eat (6,5) by moving east, then go west for (1,3).\n\n(1,3) has L=9, so by turn 64, plenty of time.\n\nAfter eating (6,5) on turn 59, head at (6,5), then I can move to (6,6) or (5,5), etc., and navigate to (1,3).\n\nBut the snake is long, need to avoid self-collision.\n\nSince I have time, I can plan a path.\n\nBut for now, for the immediate turns, I should go for (6,5).\n\nFrom initial, turn 56: move right to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 57: move to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 58: move to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 59: move to (6,4)  -- in my earlier, I moved to (6,4) on turn 58? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 56: move R to (4,3)\n\nAfter, head (4,3), body etc., tail at (5,4)\n\nTurn 57: move to (5,3) from (4,3)\n\nAfter, head (5,3), body: (4,3), etc., tail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 58: move to (6,3) from (5,3)\n\nAfter, head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), etc., tail at (6,5)\n\nTurn 59: move to (6,4) from (6,3) -- direction, from (6,3) to (6,4) is up, since y increases.\n\nU is (x,y+1), so from (6,3) to (6,4) is U.\n\nThen arrive at (6,4), no food, tail removed, (6,5) free.\n\nThen turn 60: move to (6,5) to eat food.\n\nOn turn 60, move to (6,5) from (6,4), direction U, to (6,5), eat food.\n\nL at turn 56=6, turn 57 L=5, turn 58 L=4, turn 59 L=3, turn 60 L=2, so can eat on turn 60.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 59 I am at (6,4), and (6,5) is free, but I move to (6,4) on turn 59, then to (6,5) on turn 60.\n\nCould I move directly to (6,5) from (6,3)? From (6,3) on turn 58, I can move to (6,4) or (6,2) or (5,3), not directly to (6,5), since not adjacent.\n\n(6,3) to (6,5) is not adjacent, y differs by 2.\n\nSo must go through (6,4).\n\nSo turns: 56 R to (4,3), 57 to (5,3), 58 to (6,3), 59 to (6,4), 60 to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=56.\n\nSo for turn 56, 57, 58, 59, 60.\n\nBut I need to think about after.\n\nAlso, there is the risk of tail reward danger, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAnother option: from (3,3), I could move down to (3,2), but that might not help for (6,5).\n\nMoving left to (2,3) goes towards (1,3) but (6,5) might be lost.\n\nBy going right, I can eat (6,5) and have time for (1,3).\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,5), I can go to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), head at (6,5) after eating, so far, but L=9, so I can navigate.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) after eating, I can move to (6,6) or (5,5), etc., then gradually west.\n\nBut need to avoid obstacles.\n\nSince the grid has internal obstacle, but only at (5,2), so I can go around.\n\nFor the immediate plan, I should go for (6,5).\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 56: move R (right) to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 57: from (4,3), direction R, can move to (5,3) or other, but to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58: from (5,3), direction R, move to (6,3)\n\nTurn 59: from (6,3), direction R (since moved right), can move to (6,4) or (6,2) or (5,3), so move to (6,4)\n\nTurn 60: from (6,4), move to (6,5) to eat.\n\nAfter that, I can plan to go to (1,3).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, say 5 turns: 56 to 60.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output in the format.\n\nSince the state might change after food eaten, but for now, with current info.\n\nAnother food: (6,2) is lost anyway.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTo be thorough, let's confirm the moves are safe.\n\nTurn 56: move R to (4,3): (4,3) not occupied, not wall, ok.\n\nAfter move, positions updated.\n\nTurn 57: move to (5,3): (5,3) was tail, but tail moved, so free, ok.\n\nTurn 58: move to (6,3): (6,3) free, ok.\n\nTurn 59: move to (6,4): (6,4) should be free, as in earlier simulation.\n\nTurn 60: move to (6,5): eat food.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 61 onwards, I can think, but not necessary for output.\n\nBut to show thinking ahead, perhaps output 5 turns.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: R (to (5,3))\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3) is right, so R.\n\nTurn 58: from (5,3) to (6,3) R\n\nTurn 59: from (6,3) to (6,4) U (up, since y+1)\n\nTurn 60: from (6,4) to (6,5) U\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 59 move to (6,4), then turn 60 to (6,5).\n\nBut on turn 59 at (6,4), no food, so tail moves.\n\nThen turn 60 to (6,5) eat.\n\nNow, I can add turn 61, but not needed.\n\nSince (1,3) is available, after eating (6,5), I can start moving west.\n\nBut for now, this should be fine.\n\nIn the beginning, I have three choices, but going right seems best.\n\nIf I move down to (3,2), I might not get any food soon.\n\nSimilarly, left to (2,3) then to (1,3), but (6,5) lost.\n\nBy going right, I get (6,5) and can get (1,3) later.\n\n(1,3) L=9, so by turn 64, from (6,5) on turn 60, I have 4 turns to go to (1,3), distance about 5 or 6 cells, possible with path.\n\nFor example, from (6,5) to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), but (3,5) might be body, but will move.\n\nCan go via south or north.\n\nBut not necessary to detail now.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 56 to 60) based on the current state. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - Food at (6,2) has a life span of 3 (disappears after turn 58) but is unreachable by turn 58 due to the obstacle at (5,2) and the Manhattan distance from the head (3,3) being at least 4 cells with a detour. It will be ignored.\n  - Food at (6,5) has a life span of 6 (disappears after turn 61) and is currently under the snake's body. It can be eaten by freeing the cell and moving the head there by turn 61.\n  - Food at (1,3) has a life span of 9 (disappears after turn 64) and is easily accessible later. Prioritizing (6,5) first allows time to reach (1,3) afterward.\n- **Movement Strategy**: \n  - Current head direction is down (D), so moving up (U) is not allowed on turn 56 (no instant reverse).\n  - To eat (6,5), move east to free the cell: \n    - Turn 56: Move right (R) to (4,3), shifting the body and freeing the tail area.\n    - Turn 57: Move right (R) to (5,3), continuing east.\n    - Turn 58: Move right (R) to (6,3), positioning near (6,5).\n    - Turn 59: Move up (U) to (6,4), freeing (6,5) as the tail moves away.\n    - Turn 60: Move up (U) to (6,5) to eat the food (life span allows this by turn 61).\n  - This path avoids collisions and walls, with all target cells free after body shifts.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - After eating (6,5), the snake grows, and the head is at (6,5). From there, (1,3) can be targeted (e.g., via west/south moves), with ample time (life span until turn 64). The grid has space to navigate, avoiding the obstacle at (5,2).\n  - Risks like tail reward danger are irrelevant here—no food is on the tail initially, and the plan avoids such cases.\n- **Why Not Other Moves?** \n  - Moving down (D) to (3,2) on turn 56 leads to the south area, but (6,2) is unreachable, and (6,5) might not be freed in time.\n  - Moving left (L) to (2,3) on turn 56 allows eating (1,3) by turn 57, but (6,5) would despawn uneaten due to distance (cannot reach by turn 61 from (1,3)).\n- **5-Turn Plan**: Focus on securing (6,5) for +1 score, then reassess for (1,3).\n\n### Actions for Turns 56 to 60\nThe actions below ensure the snake eats (6,5) by turn 60 while avoiding collisions and walls. Each move is feasible given the current direction and grid constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 57: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 58: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 59: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 60: U (up)\n}",

        "step": 57,
        "score": 14,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 57, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at the borders, the playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are specified as border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, meaning any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall and can't be moved to. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2). So playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), and the body segments follow. The list is: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]. That's 15 segments. So the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right. So currently moving to the right.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,2) with value 1 and life span 2\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (6,2), it disappears after 2 turns, meaning on turn 59 or something? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 57, life span is 2, so it will disappear after turn 58? Let's clarify.\n\nThe life span is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something? I need to be precise.\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span L, after this turn, L decreases by 1. If L=1, it disappears after this turn, meaning it's gone for the next turn.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of turn t, food with life span L will have L reduced by 1. If L becomes 0, it disappears before the turn starts or after? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown includes current turn.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: when we are at turn t, the life span value given is how many turns it has left, including t. So for food at (6,2), life span 2 at turn 57: after turn 57, it will have life span 1 for turn 58, and after turn 58, it disappears, so not available on turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 5: available for turns 57,58,59,60,61, disappears after turn 61.\n\n(1,3) life span 8: available for many turns.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer should include actions for turn 57, turn 58, etc., but how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns, but since the snake moves one step per turn, I need to simulate multiple moves.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions starting from turn 57, and probably for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. I think I should plan a sequence until I can't or until it makes sense to stop, but since it's a response, I need to provide the actions for the immediate turns where decisions are critical.\n\nI should simulate possible moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at borders, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is obstacle.\n\nx from 1 to 6 inclusive, y from 1 to 6 inclusive. But (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), direction R (right), so moving east.\n\nBody: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)\n\nLet me list the positions in order:\n\n1. Head: (4,3)\n\n2. (3,3)\n\n3. (3,4)\n\n4. (2,4)\n\n5. (1,4)\n\n6. (1,5)\n\n7. (2,5)\n\n8. (3,5)\n\n9. (4,5)\n\n10. (5,5)\n\n11. (5,6)\n\n12. (6,6)\n\n13. (6,5)\n\n14. (6,4)\n\n15. (5,4)  // tail\n\nThe tail is at (5,4). When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be freed unless food is eaten.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (6,2) - value 1, life 2\n\n- (6,5) - value 1, life 5\n\n- (1,3) - value 1, life 8\n\nNow, head is at (4,3), moving right, so possible moves from here: since direction is R, I can go R (continue right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left). Can move U (up), D (down), or R (right).\n\nNow, from (4,3), moving:\n\n- R: to (5,3)\n\n- U: to (4,4)\n\n- D: to (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) is within bounds? y=2, which is between 1 and 6, x=4.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is different.\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are free or occupied.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake: from positions above.\n\n(4,3) is head, but when we move, the head moves, so for the next move, the current head position will be body.\n\nAt turn 57, before moving, snake occupies: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)\n\nSo cells occupied: let's list unique cells:\n\n- (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is occupied, and (6,4) etc.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- Right (R) to (5,3): is (5,3) free? Not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacle is (5,2), so (5,3) should be free. Walls are borders, so (5,3) is x=5, y=3, between 1-6, not (5,2), so yes, free.\n\n- Up (U) to (4,4): (4,4) is not in snake positions? Snake has (3,4), (4,5), but not (4,4). (4,4) should be free? Positions: (3,4) is there, (4,5) is there, but (4,4) is not listed. Let me check the list: positions are (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), etc., no (4,4). So (4,4) is empty.\n\n- Down (D) to (4,2): (4,2) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacle is (5,2), so (4,2) is free.\n\nSo all three moves are possible in terms of not hitting wall or obstacle immediately.\n\nBut I need to consider future moves and food.\n\nAlso, food at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3).\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by the snake! Snake has (6,5) as the 13th position? Let's see: positions: 10. (5,5), 11. (5,6), 12. (6,6), 13. (6,5), so (6,5) is occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is food, not occupied yet.\n\n(1,3) is food.\n\nNow, for food under body: (6,5) has food with value 1, but it's under the snake body. To eat it, two conditions: body moves away, and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (6,5) is occupied by body segment, so if the snake moves such that this body part moves away, then later the head can move there to eat, but only if it's still there.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 5, so it will be around for a while.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, I need to think about the tail. The tail is at (5,4). If I can eat food when the tail moves, but in this case, the food is not at tail.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,4). Head is at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (4,3) and (5,4): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (4,3) and (5,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Similarly, (4,3) and (4,4) would be adjacent up, but (4,4) is empty.\n\nAdjacent cells: for (4,3), neighbors are (4,4) up, (4,2) down, (3,3) left, (5,3) right. (3,3) is body, so occupied.\n\nTail at (5,4): neighbors (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4). (5,5) is body, (6,4) is body, (5,3) might be free, (4,4) free.\n\nHead and tail are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nNo immediate danger from tail food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 57, I can move R, U, or D.\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3). Snake grows only if eat food, but no food at (5,3), so no grow, tail moves to next position. After move, snake positions: head at (5,3), then body: previous head (4,3) becomes first body segment, then (3,3), (3,4), ..., up to tail (5,4) moves away, and the new tail is the second last segment or something.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail position is vacated.\n\nSo after moving R to (5,3):\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nBody: (4,3) [was head], (3,3) [was second], (3,4) [was third], ..., down to (6,4) [was 14th], and (5,4) was tail, so it moves to (6,4)? Let's index.\n\nCurrent positions before move:\n\nIndex: 0: (4,3) head\n\n1: (3,3)\n\n2: (3,4)\n\n3: (2,4)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,5)\n\n6: (2,5)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (4,5)\n\n9: (5,5)\n\n10: (5,6)\n\n11: (6,6)\n\n12: (6,5)\n\n13: (6,4)\n\n14: (5,4) tail\n\nAfter move to (5,3):\n\nHead moves to (5,3)\n\nThen, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one:\n\nSegment 1 moves to pos 0: (4,3)\n\nSegment 2 moves to pos 1: (3,3)\n\n...\n\nSegment 14 moves to pos 13: (6,4)\n\nAnd the tail segment 14 was at (5,4), which is now vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)  // last is (6,4), which was previously occupied by segment 13, now segment 14 moves there.\n\nOld segment 13 was at (6,4), but after move, segment 14 moves to where segment 13 was, so (6,4) is still occupied, but by the new segment 14.\n\nVacated cell is where tail was, (5,4).\n\nBut no food there, so no issue.\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction was R, but after move, direction is based on action, so if I moved R, new head direction is R.\n\nFood at (6,2) is close, life span 2.\n\nIf I go to (5,3), then from there I can go to (6,3) or (5,4) or (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, so not possible. (5,4) is now free? (5,4) was tail, vacated, so free.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so cannot. So only R or U.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so from (5,3), down to (5,2) is invalid, wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: borders and internal obstacles. (5,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, borders are walls, so for example, (6,3) is x=6, y=3, x=6 is border? Border cells x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7.\n\nx=6 is not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so (6,3) is not wall, but is it playable? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so (6,3) should be playable, not wall.\n\nx=6 is not x=0 or x=7, so it's not border wall. Border walls are only x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle only (5,2), so (6,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is free after move.\n\nSo from (5,3), moves:\n\n- R to (6,3)\n\n- U to (5,4)\n\n- D invalid\n\n- L to (4,3) but (4,3) is now body, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, direction: after moving R, head direction is R, so cannot move L (left) to (4,3) anyway, since opposite direction.\n\nSo only possible: R to (6,3) or U to (5,4).\n\nIf I go to (6,3), then from there, I can go to (6,2) which has food, or (6,4), or (5,3) but occupied.\n\n(6,2) has food, life span 2.\n\nAt turn 57, if I move to (5,3), then at turn 58, I can move to (6,3), then at turn 59, to (6,2) to eat food, but life span of (6,2) is 2 at turn 57.\n\nAfter turn 57, life span decreases to 1 for turn 58.\n\nAfter turn 58, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so on turn 59, it might be gone.\n\nLet's clarify the life span timing.\n\nAt turn t=57, food (6,2) has life span 2, meaning it will be available for this turn and the next turn? Or how?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten during turn t. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If L=1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (6,2), at turn 57, life span 2: it can be eaten on turn 57 or 58. After turn 58, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 58, if not eaten, life span becomes 1, can be eaten on turn 58. After turn 58, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo to eat (6,2), I must move head to (6,2) on turn 57 or 58.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nIf at turn 57 I move R to (5,3), then on turn 58, I can move R to (6,3). Now, from (6,3), I can move to (6,2) on turn 58? Turn 58 is the next turn.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 57: move to (5,3)\n\nThen at turn 58, from (5,3), I can move R to (6,3)\n\nThen at turn 59, from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) to eat, but on turn 59, (6,2) may be gone.\n\nAfter turn 57, (6,2) life span decreases to 1 for turn 58.\n\nOn turn 58, it can be eaten. If eaten on turn 58, good.\n\nAfter turn 58, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo to eat (6,2), I need to be on (6,2) on turn 57 or 58.\n\nOn turn 57, I'm at (4,3), not adjacent to (6,2), so cannot eat on turn 57.\n\nOn turn 58, I need to move to (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,3), if I want to go to (6,2), it's two steps away: need to go right then down, or down then right, but from (4,3), down to (4,2), then right to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, cannot. Or right to (5,3), then down to (5,2) obstacle, cannot. So I cannot reach (6,2) directly in one or two moves from (4,3) because of obstacle.\n\nFrom (4,3), to reach (6,2):\n\n- One move: not possible, not adjacent.\n\n- Two moves: first move to adjacent, then to (6,2).\n\nAdjacent to (6,2): (6,1), (6,3), (5,2), (7,2) but (7,2) wall, (6,1) y=1, but y=1 is not wall, y=0 is wall, so (6,1) is playable? y=1 is not y=0, so it's within 1 to 6, so (6,1) is free, I think. Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are ok.\n\nBut (6,2) adjacent: (6,1) down, (6,3) up, (5,2) left, (7,2) right but x=7 wall, so not.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so only (6,1) and (6,3) are accessible neighbors for (6,2).\n\nSo to move to (6,2), I need to be on (6,1) or (6,3) first.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go to (5,3) or (4,4) or (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,3), then from (5,3), I can go to (6,3), then from (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,3) to (6,2) is down, y decreases.\n\nNow, at turn 57, if I move to (5,3), then turn 58 move to (6,3), then turn 59 move to (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 58, (6,2) is still available (life span 1), so I can eat on turn 58? No.\n\nWhen I move to (6,3) on turn 58, I am not on (6,2), so I eat on the move to (6,2) on turn 59.\n\nOn turn 59, (6,2) life span: after turn 58, it decreases to 0, so on turn 59, it is gone. Cannot eat on turn 59.\n\nLife span at turn 57: 2, so available on turn 57 and 58.\n\nOn turn 58, it can be eaten, with life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 58, it disappears.\n\nSo to eat, must be on (6,2) during turn 58 or earlier.\n\nOn turn 57, I cannot be on (6,2).\n\nOn turn 58, I can move to (6,2) if I am adjacent.\n\nAt turn 57, I am at (4,3), not adjacent to (6,2).\n\nAfter turn 57 move, say to (5,3), then at start of turn 58, I am at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (6,2); (5,3) to (6,2) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells must share edge.\n\n(5,3) and (6,2) do not share edge; different row and column.\n\nSo from (5,3), I cannot move directly to (6,2) in one move; I need to go to (6,3) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so only to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nNeither is (6,2).\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) on turn 58, then on turn 59 to (6,2), but (6,2) is gone on turn 59.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (6,2) because I cannot reach it on turn 57 or 58 from current position.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move down to (4,2) on turn 57.\n\n(4,2) is free, as we said.\n\nFrom (4,2), on turn 58, I can move right to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, cannot. Or left to (3,2), or up to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, occupied. Or down to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is y=1, which is not wall, so possible.\n\nBut from (4,2), cannot go to (6,2) directly or via (5,2) blocked.\n\n(4,2) to (6,2) not adjacent.\n\nSo no way to reach (6,2) in one or two moves from (4,3) with the obstacle.\n\nTherefore, (6,2) is unreachable within its life span. I should ignore it.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 57, and I can only reach it if I were closer, but I'm not, so it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) is on a body segment, currently occupied.\n\n(6,5) has food, but it's under snake body, segment 12 or something.\n\nTo eat it, the body must move away, then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, at positions, (6,5) is occupied.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no food eaten, the body moves, so the cell (6,5) might be vacated if that segment moves.\n\nBut the food is there, so if the body moves away, the food is exposed, then head can move to it.\n\nBut life span is 5, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,3) life span 8, also time.\n\nNow, back to turn 57 moves.\n\nPossible moves: R to (5,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2).\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nThe grid has limited space; snake is long, 15 segments, in a 6x6 area minus obstacle, so 36 cells minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells, snake occupies 15, so 20 free, but with food.\n\nI should aim to eat the food that is available.\n\n(6,5) is food under body. Let's see what segment is on (6,5).\n\nCurrent positions: index 12 is (6,5)? Let's list with indices:\n\n0: head (4,3)\n\n1: (3,3)\n\n2: (3,4)\n\n3: (2,4)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,5)\n\n6: (2,5)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (4,5)\n\n9: (5,5)\n\n10: (5,6)\n\n11: (6,6)\n\n12: (6,5)  // this has food\n\n13: (6,4)\n\n14: tail (5,4)\n\nSo (6,5) is position 12, which is a body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no food eaten, the head moves to new position, and each body segment shifts, so the segment that was at position 12 will move to where position 11 was, which is (6,6), so the cell (6,5) is vacated, and the food there becomes exposed.\n\nThen, if the head moves to (6,5) later, it can eat it.\n\nBut after moving, the food is at (6,5), and it can be eaten if head goes there.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nNow, at turn 57, if I move, say, R to (5,3), then new head (5,3), and the body shifts, so the segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,6), so (6,5) is now free and has food.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) was tail, now free.\n\nBut (6,5) is available with food.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or (6,3), not directly to (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can then go to (6,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) is adjacent to (6,4), (6,6), (5,5), (7,5) wall.\n\n(6,4) is currently body, but after turn 57 move, it might be different.\n\nLet's simulate after turn 57 move R to (5,3):\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nThen body: (4,3) [was head], (3,3) [was1], (3,4) [was2], (2,4) [was3], (1,4) [was4], (1,5) [was5], (2,5) [was6], (3,5) [was7], (4,5) [was8], (5,5) [was9], (5,6) [was10], (6,6) [was11], (6,5) [was12], (6,4) [was13], and tail was (5,4) [was14], but since no grow, tail moves, so the new tail is the segment that was at index 13, (6,4), which moves to where index 12 was? Let's think.\n\nAfter move, the new body is: segment 0 moves to new head position, but in terms of positions: the head moves to (5,3), then the first body segment is the old head position (4,3), second body is old position of first body (3,3), third is old position of second body (3,4), and so on, up to the 14th body segment is old position of 13th body, which was (6,4), and the tail position is vacated.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (4,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,6), 11: (6,6), 12: (6,5), 13: (6,4), 14: (5,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3):\n\n- New segment 0: (5,3)\n\n- New segment 1: old seg0 position (4,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old seg1 position (3,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old seg2 position (3,4)\n\n- New segment 4: old seg3 position (2,4)\n\n- New segment 5: old seg4 position (1,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old seg5 position (1,5)\n\n- New segment 7: old seg6 position (2,5)\n\n- New segment 8: old seg7 position (3,5)\n\n- New segment 9: old seg8 position (4,5)\n\n- New segment 10: old seg9 position (5,5)\n\n- New segment 11: old seg10 position (5,6)\n\n- New segment 12: old seg11 position (6,6)\n\n- New segment 13: old seg12 position (6,5)\n\n- New segment 14: old seg13 position (6,4)\n\nOld seg14 position (5,4) is vacated.\n\nSo now, (6,5) is occupied by new segment 13, but the food is at (6,5), and it is still occupied by the snake body, so not exposed yet.\n\nIn the new positions, new seg13 is at (6,5), which was old seg12 position, so (6,5) is still occupied by body.\n\nThe food is under that cell, but since the body is there, it cannot be eaten until the body moves away.\n\nAfter this move, the food at (6,5) is still under snake body.\n\nThen, when we move again, if no eat, the body will shift, and that segment will move away.\n\nFor example, on turn 58, from head at (5,3), if I move, say, R to (6,3), then new head (6,3), body shifts: new segment 1: (5,3), new segment 2: (4,3), ..., new segment 13: old seg12 position (6,6), new segment 14: old seg13 position (6,5)\n\nSo (6,5) is now occupied by new segment 14, still body.\n\nThen the cell old seg14 position (6,4) is vacated, but no food there.\n\nThe food at (6,5) is still covered.\n\nTo expose (6,5), I need to move such that the segment on it moves away.\n\nSince the snake is moving, eventually the body will move, but it might take time.\n\nThe segment at (6,5) is currently at the position, and as the snake moves, it will move to the next position in the chain.\n\nFor example, from above, after turn 57 move R, seg13 is at (6,5).\n\nOn turn 58, if I move from (5,3) to (6,3), then seg13 moves to where seg12 was, which is (6,6), so (6,5) is vacated, and food is exposed.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAfter turn 57 move R to (5,3), positions as above, seg13 at (6,5).\n\nOn turn 58, move R to (6,3):\n\nNew head: (6,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (5,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\n...\nNew seg12: old seg11 (5,6)\n\nOld seg11 was at (5,6), so new seg12 is at (5,6)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 position (6,6)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 position (6,5)\n\nSo new seg14 is at (6,5), so (6,5) is still occupied.\n\nThe cell that was occupied by old seg14, which was (6,4), is vacated.\n\nBut (6,5) is still under body.\n\nTo vacate (6,5), I need the segment that is there to move, and no new segment to come, but since the snake is connected, when the head moves, the body shifts, so the position (6,5) will be occupied by the next segment in line.\n\nCurrently, after turn 57, seg13 is at (6,5).\n\nWhen I move on turn 58, seg13 will move to the position of seg12, which is (6,6), so (6,5) is left, but then seg14 moves to where seg13 was, (6,5), so it is immediately reoccupied by the next segment.\n\nIn the body shift, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the position that was occupied by the last body segment is vacated, but intermediate positions may change but are still occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for a particular cell, if a body segment was there, after move, that segment moves to a new cell, and the cell is either occupied by the next segment or vacated if it was the tail.\n\nBut in this case, (6,5) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n\nAfter turn 57 move, seg13 is at (6,5).\n\nOn turn 58 move, say to (6,3), then seg13 moves to where seg12 was, (6,6), and seg14 moves to where seg13 was, (6,5), so (6,5) is now occupied by seg14.\n\nSo it's still occupied; the food is not exposed.\n\nThe only way to expose a body-covered food is if that particular segment moves and the cell is not immediately reoccupied, but in a snake, when moving without growth, the only cell vacated is the tail position.\n\nOther positions are reoccupied by the following segment.\n\nSo for a food under a body segment, it can only be eaten when that body segment is the tail and it moves away, then the cell is vacated and food exposed, then head can move there later.\n\nBut in this case, (6,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,4) after turn 57 move.\n\nAfter turn 57 move R, tail is at (6,4).\n\nFood at (6,5) is under seg13, which is not tail.\n\nTo eat it, I need to make that segment become the tail, which means I need to not eat food for a while, so the tail moves forward, and eventually that segment will be the tail.\n\nBut that might take many turns.\n\nSince the snake is long, it could take up to 14 turns for that segment to become the tail, but life span is 5, so it might disappear before.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 57, so available for turns 57 to 61.\n\nIf I don't eat any food, the tail will move, and the segment at (6,5) will eventually be closer to the tail.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps I can eat other food to grow, but that might not help.\n\nAnother way: if I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the body segments stay, so the food under body remains covered.\n\nBut if I don't eat, the tail moves, so the body shifts, and eventually the cell with food will be the tail position when the tail moves away.\n\nFor example, the food at (6,5) is under a body segment. When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the segment that was at the food position will move to the next position, and the cell is vacated only if it was the tail cell, but for a middle segment, when it moves, the cell is vacated for a moment, but in discrete turns, it's occupied by the next segment immediately.\n\nIn terms of the game state, after each move, the positions are updated, so for a cell with food under body, it can only be accessed when that body segment is the tail and it moves away.\n\nOtherwise, it's always covered.\n\nSo for (6,5), to eat it, I need the segment on it to be the tail, then when the snake moves, the tail moves away, exposing the food, then later head can move there.\n\nBut currently, it's not the tail; it's position 12 or something.\n\nCurrent before any move, at turn 57, (6,5) is occupied by segment 12 (if head is 0).\n\nAfter moving, it may change.\n\nBut in general, the tail is at index 14.\n\nThe distance from the head: the segment at (6,5) is 12 steps from head, so it will take 12 moves without eating for it to become the tail, because each move, the tail index decreases by 1 relative to head.\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the segment that was at position i will be at position i-k if i-k >=0, or gone.\n\nAfter k moves, the head has moved k times, so the body segments shift, and the tail is cut.\n\nSpecifically, after k moves without eating, the segment that was at position j will be at position j-k if j-k >=0, otherwise removed.\n\nFor the cell (6,5), it is occupied by segment with index 12.\n\nAfter k moves, if k <=12, this segment is still there at position 12-k.\n\nWhen k=12, it becomes position 0, but position 0 is head, so when k=12, the segment that was at index 12 is now at index 0, the head position? No.\n\nAfter k moves, the current head is at a new position, and the segment that was at index m is now at index m-k for m-k >=0.\n\nFor example, after 1 move, segment that was index 0 is now body index 1, index 1 is index 2, etc., index 14 is gone.\n\nSo for a segment with initial index i, after k moves, it is at index i+k in the new body, but since the list shifts, it's better to think the position moves.\n\nThe point is, the segment at (6,5) will only leave that cell when it moves, but when it moves, the next segment moves in, so the cell is not vacated until that segment is the tail and it moves away.\n\nSo for (6,5), it will be vacated only when the tail is at (6,5) and the snake moves without eating, then tail moves, cell vacated.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (5,4), so I need to move so that the tail comes to (6,5).\n\nThe tail will move to (6,5) when the segment before it moves, etc.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nPerhaps for now, since life span is 5, and it might be possible, but I have other food.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,3) is free, not under body.\n\nLife span 8, so I can go for that.\n\nAlso, the snake is in the bottom-right area, head at (4,3), food at (1,3) top-left.\n\nI should consider moving towards (1,3).\n\nBut let's first list possible actions at turn 57.\n\nOption: move D to (4,2)\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction down.\n\nFrom there, I can go L to (3,2), R to (5,2) obstacle invalid, U to (4,3) occupied, or D to (4,1).\n\nSo possible L or D.\n\n(4,1) is y=1, ok.\n\nThen I can go towards left side.\n\nFood at (1,3) is at (1,3), which is x=1, y=3.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), for example.\n\nOr other paths.\n\nBut I need to avoid walls and body.\n\nAnother option: move U to (4,4)\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction up.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied. D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4), or R to (5,4).\n\n(3,4) is body, currently occupied, but after move, it might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4) on turn 57:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nBody: old head (4,3) becomes seg1, then old seg1 (3,3) becomes seg2, old seg2 (3,4) becomes seg3, etc.\n\nOld positions: 0:(4,3), 1:(3,3), 2:(3,4), 3:(2,4), 4:(1,4), 5:(1,5), 6:(2,5), 7:(3,5), 8:(4,5), 9:(5,5), 10:(5,6), 11:(6,6), 12:(6,5), 13:(6,4), 14:(5,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,4):\n\nNew seg0: (4,4)\n\nNew seg1: old seg0 (4,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,4)  // (3,4) is occupied\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,4)\n\n...\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (6,5)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (6,4)\n\nVacated: old seg14 (5,4)\n\nNow, from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,5): but (4,5) is old seg8 position, and in new positions, new seg9 is at (4,5)? Old seg8 was (4,5), new seg9 is at old seg8 position (4,5), so occupied.\n\n- D to (4,3): new seg1 is at (4,3), occupied.\n\n- L to (3,4): new seg3 is at (3,4), occupied.\n\n- R to (5,4): which was vacated, so free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,4).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut at (5,4), I can go to (5,5) or (6,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,3).\n\nIt is at (1,3), and currently free.\n\nLife span 8, so I can reach it in a few moves.\n\nFrom current position (4,3), if I move U to (4,4), then only can go R to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) but occupied, or D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) occupied or R to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is occupied, (4,4) occupied, so from (5,4), moves: U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3), L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) which is body, but after previous move, it might be free.\n\nAfter turn 57 move U to (4,4), then at turn 58, head at (4,4), only can move R to (5,4) since others blocked.\n\nThen at (5,4), new position.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) on turn 58:\n\nHead to (5,4)\n\nBody: new seg1: (4,4), new seg2: (4,3), new seg3: (3,3), etc., up to new seg14 at (6,5) or something.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by new seg10 or something, likely occupied.\n\n- D to (5,3): may be free.\n\n- L to (4,4): occupied by seg1\n\n- R to (6,4): occupied by seg14 or something.\n\nLet's not simulate all; it's messy.\n\nPerhaps moving U at turn 57 is not good because it forces me to go right, towards the corner.\n\nMoving D to (4,2) might be better to go left.\n\nLet's consider moving D to (4,2) at turn 57.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction down.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: L to (3,2), R to (5,2) obstacle invalid, U to (4,3) occupied, D to (4,1).\n\nSo can go L or D.\n\n(4,1) is y=1, ok.\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), then I can continue left to (2,2), (1,2), then up to (1,3) for food.\n\nOr down to (3,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (4,1), then from there L to (3,1) or R to (5,1) or U to (4,2), but (4,2) may be body.\n\nAfter move to (4,2), new positions:\n\nHead: (4,2)\n\nBody: seg1: (4,3), seg2: (3,3), seg3: (3,4), seg4: (2,4), seg5: (1,4), seg6: (1,5), seg7: (2,5), seg8: (3,5), seg9: (4,5), seg10: (5,5), seg11: (5,6), seg12: (6,6), seg13: (6,5), seg14: (6,4)\n\nVacated: (5,4)\n\nFrom (4,2), at turn 58, I can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\n(3,2) should be free, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) free.\n\nIf I go to (3,2), then from there to (2,2), (1,2), then to (1,3).\n\nDistance: from (4,2) to (1,3) is about 3 moves: e.g., (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (1,2) to (1,3), or shorter if possible, but (4,2) to (3,3) not adjacent, so at least 3 moves to (1,3).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (1,3): not adjacent, so minimum 2 moves: e.g. to (3,2) then (2,3) then (1,3), or to (4,3) occupied, not possible. So 3 moves: (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,3) to (1,3), or (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (1,2) to (1,3) 4 moves, etc.\n\nFastest: (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,3) to (1,3) 3 moves.\n\n(2,3) is free? Current positions: (2,4) is occupied, (2,5) occupied, (3,3) occupied, but (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\nSo from turn 58, at (4,2), move L to (3,2), then turn 59 move to (2,3), then turn 60 move to (1,3) to eat.\n\nLife span of (1,3) is 8 at turn 57, so on turn 60, it will have life span 5 or something, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (4,1) on turn 58, it takes longer to reach (1,3).\n\nSo moving D at turn 57 allows me to go left for food.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,5)? It might be possible later, but life span 5, and I'm going left, so I might not reach it in time.\n\nBut since I'm eating at (1,3) around turn 60, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, body covered food stays covered.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so when I eat at (1,3), length increases, tail stays, so the body positions are fixed, so (6,5) remains covered.\n\nThen to eat it, I need to not grow and move many times to expose it, but it might not be worth it.\n\nSince all food is +1, I can focus on accessible food.\n\nAlso, there is risk of collision.\n\nNow, another option: move R to (5,3) at turn 57.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I go to (6,3), then I can go to (6,2) but unreachable, or to (6,4) etc.\n\nBut (6,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), positions as before.\n\nFrom (5,3), at turn 58, move U to (5,4), which is free (vacated).\n\nThen at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) or (6,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,5) is occupied, (6,4) may be occupied, (5,3) is previous head, occupied.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) on turn 58:\n\nHead to (5,4)\n\nBody: seg1: (5,3), seg2: (4,3), ..., up to seg14 at (6,4) or something.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): occupied\n\n- D to (5,3): occupied by seg1\n\n- L to (4,4): may be free? Not sure\n\n- R to (6,4): occupied by seg14\n\nLikely all adjacent cells occupied except possibly some, but in this case, (4,4) might be free, but let's see.\n\nIn the positions after turn 57 move R, we have new seg1 at (4,3), new seg3 at (3,4), etc., no (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is occupied.\n\nSo from (5,4), can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,4) possible.\n\nThen from (4,4), similar to before.\n\nBut I'm not getting closer to food.\n\nIf from (5,3) I move R to (6,3) on turn 58, then from (6,3), I can move U to (6,4) or D to (6,2) but (6,2) may be gone, or to (5,3) occupied.\n\n(6,4) is occupied, so only possible U to (6,4) if not occupied, but it is occupied.\n\nAfter move to (6,3) on turn 58:\n\nHead to (6,3)\n\nBody: seg1: (5,3), seg2: (4,3), seg3: (3,3), ..., seg13: (6,5), seg14: (6,4)\n\nSo (6,4) is occupied by seg14.\n\nFrom (6,3), adjacent: (6,4) occupied, (6,2) may be free but not reachable in time, (5,3) occupied, (7,3) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,4)? But (6,4) is occupied, so I would collide.\n\n(6,4) is a body cell, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can only move to (6,4) but it's occupied, or to (6,2) but not adjacent? (6,3) to (6,2) is down, y-1.\n\n(6,2) is a cell, and if I can move there.\n\nBut (6,2) may be available, but on turn 58, (6,2) life span is 1, so can be eaten on turn 58.\n\nBut from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) if it's free.\n\nIs (6,2) free? Yes, not occupied by snake, no wall.\n\nAnd no obstacle.\n\nSo from (6,3), I can move D to (6,2) to eat the food, but on turn 58, (6,2) is available only if life span >0.\n\nAt turn 58, after turn 57, (6,2) life span decreases to 1, so available on turn 58.\n\nSo if I am at (6,3) on turn 58, I can move D to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut to be at (6,3) on turn 58, I need to be at (5,3) on turn 57 and move R to (6,3) on turn 58.\n\nOn turn 57, move R to (5,3), then on turn 58 move R to (6,3), then on turn 59 move D to (6,2), but on turn 59, (6,2) is gone.\n\nOn turn 58, from (6,3), I can move directly to (6,2) on the same turn 58.\n\nMove to (6,2) on turn 58 to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 57: move R to (5,3)\n\nThen at turn 58, head at (5,3), move R to (6,3)\n\nNow at turn 58, after moving to (6,3), the head is at (6,3), and I can choose to move from there.\n\nPossible moves from (6,3): U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R invalid (wall).\n\n(6,4) is body, occupied, so moving there causes collision.\n\n(5,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(6,2) is free and has food, life span 1 on turn 58, so I can move D to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nSo by moving to (6,2) on turn 58, I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nThen the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBut earlier I thought (6,2) was unreachable, but from (6,3) I can reach it on turn 58.\n\nAt turn 57, from (4,3), if I move R to (5,3), then on turn 58, from (5,3) move R to (6,3), then on turn 58, from (6,3) move D to (6,2) to eat.\n\nOn turn 58, when I move to (6,2), I eat the food.\n\nLife span: on turn 58, (6,2) has life span 1, so can be eaten.\n\nAfter eating, it disappears.\n\nSo yes, possible to eat (6,2) on turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 57 I move D to (4,2), I can go for (1,3).\n\nBut (6,2) life span is short, only available on turn 58, so if I don't go for it, it disappears.\n\n(1,3) has longer life span.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nIf I go for (6,2), I eat on turn 58, snake grows to 16, then I'm at (6,2), which is near corner.\n\nThen I need to find next move.\n\nBut there is food at (6,5) and (1,3).\n\n(6,5) is under body, but after growing, it might be different.\n\nAfter eating at (6,2), head at (6,2), new length 16, so tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions: when I eat, head moves to (6,2), the body segments stay, so the tail position is not vacated, and a new segment is added at the end, so the snake occupies the same cells plus the new head position.\n\nBefore eating, on turn 58, before move, head at (6,3), positions: from after turn 57 move.\n\nAfter turn 57 move R to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), ..., (6,5), (6,4)\n\nThen on turn 58, move R to (6,3): head to (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (6,5), (6,4) and tail at (6,4), so (6,4) is occupied.\n\nThen move D to (6,2) to eat: head to (6,2), which is new cell, so the body stays, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which is (6,4), so now snake has head at (6,2), then body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to (6,5), and new tail at (6,4) or something.\n\nThe new segment is added at the position where the tail was before growth, so tail position is fixed.\n\nBefore growth, tail at (6,4), after growth, the new tail is at (6,4), and a new segment is added there, so positions: head (6,2), then the previous head position (6,3) becomes first body, then (5,3), etc., down to the previous second last segment, and new segment at previous tail (6,4).\n\nSo (6,4) is still occupied.\n\nThe food at (6,5) is still under body.\n\nI'm at (6,2), which is corner, and possible moves from there: U to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body, occupied, so cannot; L to (5,2) obstacle; R invalid; D to (6,1) if possible.\n\n(6,1) is y=1, not wall, so can move D to (6,1).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut it might be risky being in corner with long snake.\n\nIf I go for (1,3), it's more open.\n\nBut (6,2) is only available if I act now.\n\nAt turn 57, if I move D to (4,2), then on turn 58, I move L to (3,2), then turn 59 to (2,3) or (2,2), then turn 60 to (1,3) to eat.\n\nI miss (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) has short life, and I can eat it, I should consider it.\n\nBut let's see the value: all food +1, so same value.\n\nBut (6,2) is closer in terms of immediate gain.\n\nLong-term, going left might be better for space.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,5) with life 5, which I might eat later.\n\nBut after eating (6,2), I'm at (6,2), then I can go down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), etc., towards (1,3).\n\nOr up, but (6,3) is occupied.\n\nFrom (6,2), after eating, head at (6,2), body includes (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can only move D to (6,1), since U to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,2) obstacle, R invalid.\n\nSo must move D to (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), I can move L to (5,1) or U to (6,2) occupied, or D to (6,0) wall, so only L to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move U to (5,2) obstacle invalid, L to (4,1), D to (5,0) wall, so only L to (4,1) or U, but U invalid, so only L to (4,1).\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1), etc.\n\nThen I can go towards (1,3).\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,2), and go directly for (1,3), I can eat it sooner.\n\nLet's compare the number of moves to eat.\n\nIf I go for (6,2): turn 57 move R to (5,3), turn 58 move R to (6,3) then D to (6,2) eat on turn 58. So eat on turn 58.\n\nThen from there, as above, to reach (1,3): from (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,3) to (1,3) or something, at least 6 moves to (1,3), so eat on turn 64 or later.\n\nIf I go directly for (1,3) from start: turn 57 move D to (4,2), turn 58 move L to (3,2), turn 59 move to (2,3), turn 60 move to (1,3) eat. So eat on turn 60.\n\nTurn 57 to turn 60 is 3 turns later, but I eat on turn 60 instead of turn 58 for (6,2), but I eat (6,2) on turn 58, then (1,3) later.\n\nBut (1,3) has life span 8, so on turn 60 it's still there.\n\nBut in terms of score, if I eat (6,2) on turn 58, I get +1, then later eat (1,3) on say turn 64, another +1.\n\nIf I eat (1,3) on turn 60, I get +1, and (6,2) is gone, so I miss one food.\n\nBy eating (6,2), I get one extra food, but with risk of being in corner.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating (6,2) gives immediate score, and I can still go for (1,3).\n\nThe risk is that after eating (6,2), I'm at (6,2), and must go down to (6,1), which is corner, and snake is long, so I might trap myself.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), only to (5,1), then to (4,1), then I can go to (3,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be occupied later, but initially free.\n\nWith the snake body, I need to see the path.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for (1,3) directly and ignore (6,2) since it's risky.\n\nBut let's check if (6,2) can be eaten without risk.\n\nOn turn 57, move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 58: move R to (6,3) then D to (6,2) eat.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), and new segment at (6,4) since tail was at (6,4) before growth.\n\nBefore growth on turn 58, after moving to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), ..., (6,5), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nEat at (6,2): head moves to (6,2), body segments remain, new segment added at previous tail position (6,4), so new positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)  // new tail at (6,4)\n\nNow, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, occupied, collision if move there.\n\nL to (5,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (7,2) wall invalid.\n\nD to (6,1) free.\n\nSo only D to (6,1).\n\nMove to (6,1) on turn 59.\n\nThen at (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2) occupied, L to (5,1), D to (6,0) wall invalid, so only L to (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,1) on turn 60.\n\nAt (5,1), moves: U to (5,2) obstacle invalid, L to (4,1), D to (5,0) wall invalid, so only L to (4,1).\n\nMove to (4,1) on turn 61.\n\nAt (4,1), moves: U to (4,2), L to (3,1), D to (4,0) wall invalid, R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(4,2) might be free or not; in current state, it was free, but after moves, it might be occupied.\n\nAfter several moves, the body has moved, so (4,2) could be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) free.\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), then from there to (3,2), etc. to (1,3).\n\nOr L to (3,1), then to (2,1), (1,1), then to (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n\nBut I can reach (1,3) eventually.\n\nBut it takes many turns, and the snake is long, so I might run out of space or collide.\n\nFor example, the area left might be crowded.\n\nSince I ate at (6,2), the snake is longer, 16 segments, in a small grid.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6=36 minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 16, so 19 free, but with food at (1,3) and (6,5), but (6,5) is under body.\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nI can go to (1,3) in about 6 moves from (4,1), as above.\n\nFrom (4,1) on turn 61, to (4,2) on turn 62, to (3,2) on turn 63, to (2,3) on turn 64, to (1,3) on turn 65 eat.\n\nLife span of (1,3) is 8 at turn 57, so on turn 65, how many turns passed?\n\nTurn 57 to 65 is 8 turns, but life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 57, life span 8, so available for turns 57 to 64? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 57, life span 8: can be eaten on turn 57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64. After turn 64, it disappears.\n\nOn turn 65, it is gone.\n\nSo to eat on turn 65, too late; must eat by turn 64.\n\nOn turn 64, I can eat if I am on (1,3).\n\nIn the sequence, from (4,1) on turn 61, if I move U to (4,2) on turn 62, then to (3,2) on turn 63, then to (2,3) on turn 64, then to (1,3) on turn 65, but on turn 65 it's gone, so I cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 64, I am at (2,3), I can move to (1,3) on turn 64 to eat.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3) is one move.\n\nSo on turn 64, move to (1,3) eat.\n\nLife span: on turn 64, it should be available if life span >0.\n\nAt turn 57, life span 8, so after turn 57, life span 7 for turn 58, ..., after turn 63, life span 1 for turn 64, can be eaten on turn 64. After turn 64, disappears.\n\nSo yes, on turn 64, I can eat at (1,3).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 61: at (4,1), move to (4,2) or (3,1). Better to go directly to (1,3).\n\nFrom (4,1), move U to (4,2) on turn 62.\n\nTurn 62: at (4,2), move L to (3,2) on turn 63? From (4,2) to (3,2) is left, possible.\n\nThen turn 63: at (3,2), move to (2,2) or (2,3) or (3,3) but (3,3) may be occupied.\n\n(2,3) is better for (1,3).\n\nMove to (2,3) on turn 63.\n\nThen turn 64: at (2,3), move to (1,3) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo eat on turn 64.\n\nIf from (4,1) I move L to (3,1) on turn 62, then to (2,1) on turn 63, to (1,1) on turn 64, then to (1,2) on turn 65, to (1,3) on turn 66, but on turn 66 it's gone, so not possible. So must go via (2,3) or directly.\n\nBut (1,2) to (1,3) on turn 65, but life span gone, so only via (2,3) to (1,3) on turn 64.\n\nNow, back to the choice.\n\nIf I eat (6,2) on turn 58, then I eat (1,3) on turn 64, so I get two foods.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,2), and go directly for (1,3), I eat on turn 60, and (6,2) disappears, so only one food.\n\nBy eating (6,2), I get an extra point.\n\nBut with the risk during the path.\n\nIn the direct path to (1,3), from turn 57 move D to (4,2), turn 58 move L to (3,2), turn 59 move to (2,3), turn 60 move to (1,3) eat.\n\nOn turn 60, eat (1,3), life span 8 at turn 57, on turn 60 life span 5, available.\n\nThen snake grows to 16, at (1,3).\n\nThen I can explore other areas.\n\nBut I missed (6,2).\n\nSince (6,2) is only available now, and I can get it, I should go for it to maximize score.\n\nThe food at (6,5) might be eaten later, but it's under body, so difficult.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3), the snake is longer, and (6,5) is still covered.\n\nTo eat it, I need to starve the snake to move the tail to that position, but it's complicated and risky.\n\nSo perhaps better to eat the available food.\n\nAnother option: move U at turn 57 to (4,4), but then I am forced to move R to (5,4), then to (4,4) or something, not efficient.\n\nSo between R and D, R allows me to eat (6,2), D allows me to eat (1,3) faster but miss (6,2).\n\nSince eating (6,2) gives an extra point, and the path, while tight, seems possible, I think it's worth it.\n\nMoreover, the core rule is to maximize score, so I should take the opportunity.\n\nAlso, think 5+ turns ahead, but in this case, for the next few turns.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions starting from turn 57.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nSince the AI decides each turn, but for the response, I should provide a plan for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for turns 57,58,59, etc.\n\nBut it depends on the move.\n\nLet's assume I go for (6,2).\n\nSo turn 57: move R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 58: move R to (6,3)\n\nThen on turn 58, from (6,3), move D to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut in the answer, for turn 58, I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, after that, I need to continue.\n\nBut the response should include actions for turn 57, turn 58, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 59, from (6,2), move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 60: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 61: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen from there, to (1,3).\n\nBut to reach (1,3) by turn 64, I need to go directly.\n\nFrom (4,1) on turn 61, move U to (4,2) on turn 62\n\nTurn 62: at (4,2), move L to (3,2) or to (2,3)? From (4,2) to (2,3) not adjacent, so to (3,2) or (3,3) but (3,3) may be occupied.\n\nMove to (3,2) on turn 62\n\nTurn 63: at (3,2), move to (2,3) or (2,2)\n\nBetter to (2,3) for (1,3)\n\nMove to (2,3) on turn 63\n\nTurn 64: at (2,3), move to (1,3) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nBut this is one possible path.\n\nI could have different moves, but this seems workable.\n\nIf I go directly for (1,3) without eating (6,2):\n\nTurn 57: move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 58: move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 59: move to (2,3)  // for example, from (3,2) to (2,3) or (2,2), (2,3) is closer\n\nTurn 60: move to (1,3) eat.\n\nThen at (1,3), I can go to other places.\n\nBut I miss (6,2), so one less point.\n\nMoreover, (6,5) might be eaten if I can, but difficult.\n\nSo I think going for (6,2) is better.\n\nNow, about the food at (6,5): after I eat (1,3) on turn 64, the snake is at (1,3), and (6,5) has life span 5 at turn 57, so on turn 64, life span? Turn 57 to 64 is 7 turns, life span was 5, so on turn 64, it should be gone.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 57: available for turns 57,58,59,60,61. Disappears after turn 61.\n\nOn turn 64, long gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,5) anyway, since I'm going to (1,3) late.\n\nIn both cases, (6,5) disappears uneaten.\n\nSo only two foods, but in the first case, I eat both (6,2) and (1,3), in the second case, only (1,3).\n\nSo definitely better to eat (6,2).\n\nThus, I should move R at turn 57.\n\nThen for turn 58, move R to (6,3), then from (6,3) move D to (6,2) on the same turn? No, each turn one move.\n\nOn turn 58, from position after turn 57, I am at (5,3), and I move to (6,3), then on that turn, after moving, I am at (6,3), and I can choose to move to (6,2) on turn 58? No, on turn 58, I move from current position to new position.\n\nAt the start of turn 58, after turn 57 move, head is at (5,3), so I choose action for turn 58 to move from (5,3) to (6,3) or other.\n\nThen after moving to (6,3), the turn is over, and for turn 59, I am at (6,3), and I can move to (6,2) if I want.\n\nBut on turn 59, (6,2) is gone.\n\nAs earlier, I must move to (6,2) on turn 58 to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 58, I start at (5,3), not at (6,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move to (6,3) on turn 58, but (6,2) is not adjacent to (5,3), so I cannot move directly to (6,2) from (5,3).\n\nOnly after moving to (6,3), on turn 58, I am at (6,3), and I can immediately move to (6,2) on the same turn? No, each turn I make one move.\n\nSo on turn 58, I move from (5,3) to (6,3), then on turn 59, I can move from (6,3) to (6,2), but on turn 59, (6,2) is gone.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (6,2) because I cannot be on (6,2) on turn 57 or 58.\n\nOn turn 57, I am at (4,3), not at (6,2).\n\nOn turn 58, I start at wherever I moved on turn 57.\n\nIf I moved to (5,3) on turn 57, on turn 58 I am at (5,3), and I move to (6,3), but not to (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 59, I can move to (6,2), but it's gone.\n\nSo impossible to eat (6,2), as I thought initially.\n\nThe only way is if I could move directly from a cell adjacent to (6,2) on turn 58, but from (5,3), I am not adjacent to (6,2), so no.\n\nTherefore, (6,2) cannot be eaten, so I should ignore it and go for (1,3) directly.\n\nSo at turn 57, move D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 58: from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 59: from (3,2), move to (2,3)  // (2,3) is free, and adjacent\n\nThen turn 60: from (2,3), move to (1,3) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, at (1,3).\n\nThen for turn 61 onwards, I need to move away.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4), but (1,4) is body, occupied; D to (1,2), L to (0,2) wall invalid, R to (2,3) occupied.\n\n(1,4) is occupied, (2,3) occupied, (1,2) may be free.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3) on turn 60, positions: head at (1,3), body: the previous head position (2,3) becomes first body, then previous body, and new segment at previous tail position.\n\nBefore eating on turn 60: at start of turn 60, head at (2,3), after move from (3,2) on turn 59.\n\nLet's not detail, but at (1,3), after eating, (1,4) is body, (2,3) is body, so only possible move is D to (1,2) if free.\n\n(1,2) should be free.\n\nThen from there, I can explore down or left.\n\nBut since the response is for multiple turns, I can provide up to turn 60 or so.\n\nFor the food at (6,5), it's not eatable, so no issue.\n\nSo I think the plan is:\n\nTurn 57: D (down) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 58: L (left) to (3,2)\n\nTurn 59: U (up) to (2,3) or R to (3,3) but (3,3) may be occupied, so U to (2,3) is better for (1,3)\n\nFrom (3,2), to (2,3) is up-right, but in moves, from (3,2) to (2,3) is left and up? (3,2) to (2,3) is x-1, y+1, diagonal, not adjacent; not possible.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,2) to (3,3) up, (3,1) down, (2,2) left, (4,2) right.\n\n(2,3) is not adjacent to (3,2).\n\nTo go to (2,3) from (3,2), I need to go through (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nBut (3,3) is occupied? Current before any move, (3,3) is body.\n\nAfter moves, it might be free.\n\nAfter turn 57 move D to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc.\n\n(3,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 58 move L to (3,2), then head at (3,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) is still occupied.\n\nFrom (3,2), at turn 59, possible moves: U to (3,3) occupied, D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) occupied.\n\nSo can go D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2) or (3,1), I can go to (2,3) later.\n\nFor example, turn 59: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 60: from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 61: from (2,3) move to (1,3) but on turn 61, (1,3) life span? At turn 57, life span 8, so on turn 61, life span 4, available.\n\nTurn 61: move to (1,3) eat.\n\nBut later than before.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 59, move D to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc., takes longer.\n\nTo reach (1,3) faster, from (3,2) move L to (2,2) on turn 59, then on turn 60 move U to (2,3), then on turn 61 move L to (1,3) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nBut on turn 60, I am at (2,3), not at (1,3).\n\nEat on turn 61.\n\nStill within life span.\n\nBut earlier with different move, I could eat on turn 60.\n\nHow? If at turn 59 I am at a position adjacent to (1,3), like (2,3).\n\nFrom turn 57 move D to (4,2), turn 58 move L to (3,2), then from (3,2) I cannot go directly to (2,3), so I need to go to (2,2) or (3,3), but (3,3) occupied, so to (2,2) on turn 59.\n\nThen from (2,2) on turn 60, move U to (2,3), then turn 61 move to (1,3).\n\nSo eat on turn 61.\n\nIf from (4,2) on turn 58, I move to (3,2), but I could move D to (4,1), but that takes longer to (1,3).\n\nSo minimum eat on turn 61.\n\nWith (6,2) uneatable, so no loss.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with moving down at turn 57.\n\nThen left at 58, etc.\n\nBut to specify the actions.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 57):**\n- **Grid Size:** Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake:** Head at (4,3) moving right (R), with 15 segments. Positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)] (tail at (5,4)).\n- **Food:**\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 58).\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 61).\n  - (1,3): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 64).\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Food at (6,2):** Cannot be eaten due to short life span (2) and unreachable by turn 58. From (4,3), no path reaches (6,2) in 1-2 moves without hitting the obstacle at (5,2). Thus, ignore this food.\n- **Food at (6,5):** Under snake body (segment at (6,5)), cannot be eaten directly. Exposing it requires the segment to become the tail, which takes many moves (currently index 12, ~12 moves without eating). With life span 5 and the snake moving toward (1,3), it will disappear uneaten. Low priority.\n- **Food at (1,3):** Accessible and high-value with long life span (8). Path: (4,3) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (1,3) to eat by turn 61.\n- **Movement Risks:** \n  - Snake is long (15 segments), so avoid tight spaces (e.g., corners) to prevent self-collision. \n  - After eating (1,3), the snake grows, reducing free space. Plan to move toward open areas (e.g., lower-left) after eating.\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 57):** From (4,3) moving R, possible moves are U, D, or R (no L due to no instant reverse). \n  - U to (4,4): Forces movement right toward crowded area, limiting options.\n  - R to (5,3): Leads to dead-end at (6,3) with fewer escape routes; (6,2) uneatable.\n  - D to (4,2): Best for accessing (1,3) quickly and avoiding risks. Chosen for efficiency and safety.\n\n**Optimal Path (Turns 57-64):**\n- **Turn 57:** Move D (down) to (4,2). This starts the path to (1,3) and avoids the fruitless (6,2) and risky right movement.\n- **Turn 58:** From (4,2), move L (left) to (3,2). Continues toward (1,3); (3,2) is safe and free.\n- **Turn 59:** From (3,2), move L (left) to (2,2). Avoids occupied (3,3); sets up direct line to (2,3) and (1,3).\n- **Turn 60:** From (2,2), move U (up) to (2,3). (2,3) is free; positions head adjacent to (1,3) for eating.\n- **Turn 61:** From (2,3), move L (left) to (1,3) to eat (+1 score, length 16). Life span 8 at turn 57 ensures availability on turn 61 (life span 4 remaining).\n- **Beyond Turn 61:** After eating, head at (1,3). Only safe move is D (down) to (1,2) to avoid body collisions. Then explore lower-left (e.g., (1,1), (2,1)) for potential new food or open space. No other food available; focus on survival.\n\n**Why This Plan Maximizes Score and Safety:**\n- Eats (1,3) for +1 score by turn 61, utilizing its long life span.\n- Ignores (6,2) (impossible) and (6,5) (inaccessible), avoiding wasted moves.\n- Minimizes risk: Path to (1,3) uses open cells, and post-eating moves avoid collisions.\n- Long-term: After turn 61, prioritize open areas to delay trapping. Grid has 35 playable cells; snake length 16 leaves 19 free cells—ample space for maneuvering.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 58: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 59: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 60: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 61: L (left) \\\\\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm the grid size. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, except for internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2)\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So the snake has 15 segments.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning down. Since it's moving down, and head is at (4,2), which is row 2, column 4? Coordinates: (x,y), so x horizontal, y vertical? Typically in grids, (x,y) with x increasing right, y increasing up or down? I need to clarify.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upward? U is up, so (x,y+1) means y increases as we go up, I think. Standard is often y=0 at bottom, but here U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 is up, then y=0 might be bottom or top? Let's see the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake positions: head (4,2), and moving D (down) to (4,1)? But y=1 is within bounds, y=0 is wall.\n\nCurrent head is (4,2), direction D, so it just moved down to (4,2)? Positions list: head is first, so at turn 58, head is at (4,2), and it was moving down to get there, I assume. Direction is given as current head direction, which is D, so it is facing down.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (6,2) with value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life_span 4? Food format: (x,y, value, life_span) I think. In the input: (6,2,1,1) so (x,y,value,life_span)\n\nSimilarly, (6,5,4,1) — that might be (x,y,value,life_span) = (6,5,4,1)? But value is 4? But in the core rules, food values are +1 or -1, but here it says value1=1 for (6,2), and for (6,5) it says value=4? That can't be right; core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. But here it's given as numbers.\n\nLook back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 2, 1, 1) - (6, 5, 4, 1) - (1, 3, 7, 1) - (3, 1, 10, 1)\"\n\n(6,5,4,1) — this might be (x,y, life_span, value) or something? But core rules don't specify the order, but in the description it says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be (x,y), value, life_span.\n\nFor (6,2,1,1): probably (x=6,y=2, value=1, life_span=1)\n\n(6,5,4,1): (x=6,y=5, value=4? But value should be ±1 according to core rules. Contradiction.\n\nCore rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", so values should only be +1 or -1. But here (6,5,4,1) has value=4? That must be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value)? But the description says \"value and life span\" and format is (x,y, value, life_span), but value=4 doesn't make sense.\n\nLook at the last one: (1,3,7,1) — value=7? That can't be.\n\n(3,1,10,1) value=10?\n\nBut core rules say value is only +1 or -1 for positive and negative food. Unless there are different values, but the rules don't mention that. Rules say \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, \"-1\" for negative.\n\nPerhaps I misread the input.\n\nInput: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" but then listed as (6,2,1,1) etc. Probably it's a tuple (x,y, value, life_span).\n\nBut value should be ±1, but here we have 1,4,7,10 which are not ±1. Unless some are negative, but all are positive numbers.\n\n(6,2,1,1) value=1, (6,5,4,1) value=4, (1,3,7,1) value=7, (3,1,10,1) value=10.\n\nBut core rules don't allow that. Perhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps in this game, food can have different values? But the core rules say explicitly +1 and -1.\n\nAnother possibility: the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? For (6,2,1,1) if life_span=1, value=1, that works for positive food. For (6,5,4,1) if life_span=4, value=1, that makes sense. Similarly, (1,3,7,1) life_span=7, value=1, and (3,1,10,1) life_span=10, value=1. All value=1, so all positive food with different life spans.\n\nBut in the tuple, it's written as (x,y, a, b) and from the first, (6,2,1,1) value=1, life_span=1, so a is value, b is life_span? But for (6,5,4,1) if a=4, b=1, then value=4, life_span=1? But value should be 1.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the description: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it should be (x,y), value, life_span.\n\nBut values are 1,4,7,10, which are not ±1. Unless the \"value\" here is the reward value, and for positive food it's +1, but here it's given as numbers, so perhaps in this state, all food is positive with value 1, but the number is life_span or something.\n\nI think there might be a mislabeling. Let's read the input carefully.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n- (6, 2, 1, 1)\n- (6, 5, 4, 1)\n- (1, 3, 7, 1)\n- (3, 1, 10, 1)\"\n\nAnd core rules say \"value\" for food is the reward, which is ±1.\n\nBut here, for example (6,2,1,1) could be x=6,y=2, value=1, life_span=1, which is fine.\n\n(6,5,4,1) x=6,y=5, value=4, life_span=1? But value=4 not ±1.\n\nPerhaps the numbers are switched, and it's (x,y, life_span, value). For (6,2,1,1) if life_span=1, value=1, ok. For (6,5,4,1) if life_span=4, value=1, that makes sense. Similarly, (1,3,7,1) life_span=7, value=1, (3,1,10,1) life_span=10, value=1. All have value=1, so all positive food.\n\nI think that's the case, because if value were 4, it doesn't make sense with core rules. So I'll assume the format is (x,y, life_span, value), but the description says \"value and life span\" in that order, but in the tuple, it might be listed differently. No, the description says \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it should be value first, then life_span.\n\nBut for (6,5,4,1), if value1=4, life_span1=1, but value should be 1 or -1. Perhaps it's a typo, or in this game, food can have different values? But core rules don't say that.\n\nAnother idea: the \"value\" in the food list is the life span, and the last number is the reward value? But for (6,2,1,1) it has 1 and 1, both could be.\n\nLet's look at the last one: (3,1,10,1) if value=10, life_span=1, or value=1, life_span=10?\n\nBut core rules say life span disappears after N turns, so it should be an integer, and value is ±1.\n\nI think the only logical way is to assume that the third number is life_span and the fourth is value, but the description says \"value and life span\" in that order.\n\nPerhaps in this specific state, all food has value 1, and the number given as \"value\" is actually life_span, but that doesn't match.\n\nLet's read the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" it says \"Life Span and Value\", so perhaps the order is (x,y, life_span, value).\n\nFor (6,2,1,1) : x=6,y=2, life_span=1, value=1\n\n(6,5,4,1) : x=6,y=5, life_span=4, value=1\n\n(1,3,7,1) : x=1,y=3, life_span=7, value=1\n\n(3,1,10,1) : x=3,y=1, life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll value=1, so all positive food. That makes sense. The \"Life Span and Value\" might be a misnomer, or the order is switched in the tuple. I'll go with that.\n\nSo food:\n\n- (6,2): life_span=1, value=+1 (positive)\n\n- (6,5): life_span=4, value=+1\n\n- (1,3): life_span=7, value=+1\n\n- (3,1): life_span=10, value=+1\n\nAll positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn t1=58.\n\nSo for (6,2), life_span=1, so at turn 58, it will disappear after this turn? Life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo if life_span=1 at turn 58, it means it will disappear at the end of turn 58, so it can be eaten only on turn 58 if the head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, for others, life_span decreases each turn.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,2), direction D (down).\n\nCurrent possible moves: since head direction is D, I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be opposite to down.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo current direction D, so I cannot move U on this turn. Possible moves: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, grid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: list from head to tail: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nSo let's plot the grid for clarity.\n\nI'll make a 6x6 grid, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. y=1 bottom? Since D is (x,y-1), so y decreases down, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Let's define.\n\nU is (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top, I think. Standard.\n\nSo grid:\n\ny=6 top\ny=5\ny=4\ny=3\ny=2\ny=1 bottom\n\nx=1 left to x=6 right.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are outside, not playable.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2)\n\nFood:\n- (6,2) at (x=6,y=2) with life_span=1, so disappears after turn 58, so only available on turn 58 if eaten.\n- (6,5) at (x=6,y=5) life_span=4\n- (1,3) at (x=1,y=3) life_span=7\n- (3,1) at (x=3,y=1) life_span=10\n\nSnake head at (4,2), which is x=4,y=2.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- D (down): to (4,1) since y-1. (4,1) is within bounds? y=1 is bottom, not wall, so ok.\n\n- L (left): to (3,2)\n\n- R (right): to (5,2)\n\nBut (5,2) has an internal obstacle? Obstacle at (5,2), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacle is (5,2), so cell (5,2) is blocked.\n\nAlso, snake body: where is the snake?\n\nList of positions:\n\nHead: (4,2)\n\nThen (4,3) -- that's above, since y=3 > y=2, so north.\n\nThen (3,3) -- left and same y? (3,3) x=3,y=3\n\nThen (3,4) -- up to y=4\n\n(2,4) -- left to x=2\n\n(1,4) -- left to x=1\n\n(1,5) -- up to y=5\n\n(2,5) -- right to x=2\n\n(3,5) -- right to x=3\n\n(4,5) -- right to x=4\n\n(5,5) -- right to x=5\n\n(5,6) -- up to y=6\n\n(6,6) -- right to x=6\n\n(6,5) -- down to y=5\n\n(6,4) -- down to y=4\n\nTail is (6,4)\n\nNow, at (4,2), moving to:\n\n- Down to (4,1): what is there? Not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom snake: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nSo cells occupied: all these.\n\n(4,1) is not in the list, and not wall, so free? But is there food? Food at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3), (3,1). (4,1) has no food, so empty.\n\nBut internal obstacle only at (5,2), so (4,1) is free.\n\n- Left to (3,2): is (3,2) occupied? Snake positions: (3,3) is there, but (3,2) not listed, so should be free. Food? No food at (3,2), so empty.\n\n- Right to (5,2): but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Up to (4,3): but (4,3) is the second segment of the snake, body collision if I move there. Also, cannot move up because current direction is D, and U is opposite, so no instant reverse, cannot move U.\n\nSo only possible moves from (4,2) are D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nR to (5,2) is wall, U is forbidden.\n\nSo choices: down or left.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the food situation.\n\nFood at (6,2) with life_span=1, so it will disappear after turn 58. If I don't eat it this turn (turn 58), it's gone.\n\nCan I eat it? Head at (4,2), (6,2) is two steps right, but to reach (6,2) from (4,2), I need to move R then R, but R to (5,2) is wall, so I cannot go to (5,2), so impossible to reach (6,2) in one move. I can only move to adjacent cells, so (6,2) is not adjacent to (4,2); adjacent would be (5,2) or (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,3). (5,2) is blocked, so I cannot move to (6,2) directly, and since it's two cells away, and I can only move one per turn, and it disappears after this turn, I cannot eat (6,2) at all. So forget about that food; it will vanish.\n\nNext food: (6,5) at (6,5), life_span=4. So it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning at turn 58, life_span=4, so it will be there for turns 58,59,60,61, disappear after turn 61? Countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so available until turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nCore rules: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is N, then:\n\n- At the start of turn t, countdown is N.\n\n- After turn t, if not eaten, countdown becomes N-1.\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food with life_span N at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1, so not available on turn t+N.\n\nFor (6,5) at turn 58, life_span=4, so available on turns 58,59,60,61. Disappears after turn 61.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life_span=7, available turns 58 to 64.\n\n(3,1) life_span=10, available turns 58 to 67.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves turn 58: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nI need to consider both options and think ahead.\n\nFirst, option 1: move down to (4,1)\n\nThen head at (4,1), direction now D (since moved down).\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: D, L, R, but no U because current direction D, cannot reverse to U.\n\nD to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, so invalid, die.\n\nL to (3,1): (3,1) has food? Yes, food at (3,1), but let's see if it's safe.\n\n(3,1) is a food position, value +1.\n\nBut also, is it occupied? Snake positions: tail is at (6,4), not (3,1). So (3,1) is free except for food.\n\nR to (5,1): (5,1) is not wall, not occupied, no food, so free.\n\nBut R to (5,1) might be ok.\n\nBut from (4,1), moves:\n\n- D: to (4,0) wall, die.\n\n- L: to (3,1)\n\n- R: to (5,1)\n\nCannot U.\n\nSo if I move to (4,1), then I must move L or R, cannot stay or go down.\n\nNow, if I move L to (3,1), I eat the food there? (3,1) has food, so if head moves to (3,1), I eat it, snake grows, so new tail added, but positions: after moving to (3,1), head is at (3,1), and the tail will move, but since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n\nWhen I eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, new segment added.\n\nBut in terms of positions, the body segments follow.\n\nAlso, need to check if eating at (3,1) is safe.\n\n(3,1) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (6,4), which is far, not adjacent.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (6,4), head at (4,1) or moving to (3,1), distance is large, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nSo moving to (3,1) eats food, grows.\n\nThen after that, head at (3,1), direction from moving left, so now direction L.\n\nThen possible moves from there.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first, back to turn 58 choices.\n\nOption: move L to (3,2) on turn 58.\n\nFrom (4,2) move L to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is empty, no food, so no eat.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move R (right, opposite to left).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible: U to (3,3), but (3,3) is snake body? Positions: (3,3) is the third segment, yes, occupied, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) has food, and is free? Not occupied by snake, so can move there.\n\nL to (2,2): (2,2) not occupied, no food, free.\n\nR to (4,2): but (4,2) is the previous head, but after move, the body is there? When I move to (3,2), the head is at (3,2), and the previous head (4,2) becomes body, so (4,2) is occupied by body now.\n\nAfter move to (3,2), snake positions: head (3,2), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ... etc.\n\nSo (3,3) is still body, (4,2) is now the neck.\n\nSo from (3,2), moves:\n\n- U to (3,3): but (3,3) is body segment, collision, die.\n\n- D to (3,1): free, has food.\n\n- L to (2,2): free, no food.\n\n- R to (4,2): but (4,2) is now body, collision, die.\n\nAlso, cannot move R because reverse, but anyway collision.\n\nSo only possible moves from (3,2) are D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nNow, back to turn 58.\n\nI need to maximize score, but prioritize survival. Eating food is good, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 15 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nGrid 6x6 has 36 cells, snake 15, so 21 free, but with obstacles and food.\n\nFree cells: total cells: x1-6,y1-6, 36 cells.\n\nWalls: border not included, but internal obstacle (5,2) is one cell, so playable cells: 36 - 1 = 35? Walls are at borders, which are not cells, so grid has 36 cells, but (5,2) is obstacle, so 35 playable cells.\n\nSnake occupies 15, so 20 free cells.\n\nFood occupies 4 cells, but food cells are part of the free cells until eaten, so free cells include empty and food cells.\n\nCurrently, food at (6,2), (6,5), (1,3), (3,1), and (6,2) disappears after turn 58.\n\nBut (6,2) will be gone if not eaten.\n\nNow, for turn 58, choices:\n\n- Move D to (4,1)\n\n- Move L to (3,2)\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), then at (4,1), I must move to avoid dying, to (3,1) or (5,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, so eating it gives +1 and grows to 16.\n\n(5,1) is empty.\n\nBut if I go to (4,1), and then to (3,1), I eat food, but then I'm at (3,1), which is corner, and from there I can go to (3,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut let's see the state after.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2) on turn 58, no eat, then from (3,2), I can go to (3,1) to eat or to (2,2).\n\n(3,1) has food, so I can eat it soon.\n\nBut (3,1) has life_span 10, so plenty of time, no rush.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3) and (6,5), which might be riskier.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), which is occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,5) is the 14th segment? Positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n\n(6,5) is the second last, index 14 if head 0, so it's body segment.\n\nBut food at (6,5), and it's under the snake body? Core rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nSo (6,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that this cell is vacated, then head moves to it later.\n\nSimilarly, other food not under body.\n\n(6,5) is under body, life_span=4.\n\n(1,3) is not under body, free cell.\n\n(3,1) not under.\n\n(6,2) under? (6,2) is not in snake positions, so not under body. Snake positions don't have (6,2), so it's free.\n\nBut (6,2) disappears after this turn.\n\nNow, for survival, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,4), and it will move when the snake moves, unless eating.\n\nLet's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, suppose on turn 58, I move down to (4,1).\n\nThen head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nSnake positions: new head (4,1), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ... up to (6,4), but since no eat, tail moves? When not eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away from (6,4).\n\nAfter move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes segment 1, (4,3) segment 2, (3,3) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, (2,4) segment 5, (1,4) segment 6, (1,5) segment 7, (2,5) segment 8, (3,5) segment 9, (4,5) segment 10, (5,5) segment 11, (5,6) segment 12, (6,6) segment 13, (6,5) segment 14, and tail was (6,4), but since no eat, the last segment is removed, so tail is now at (6,5)? Let's see.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo from old positions: head (4,2), then segments: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1), new positions: head (4,1), then body: (4,2) [previous head], (4,3) [previous seg1], (3,3) [prev seg2], (3,4) [prev seg3], (2,4) [prev seg4], (1,4) [prev seg5], (1,5) [prev seg6], (2,5) [prev seg7], (3,5) [prev seg8], (4,5) [prev seg9], (5,5) [prev seg10], (5,6) [prev seg11], (6,6) [prev seg12], (6,5) [prev seg13], and the last segment (6,4) is removed, so tail is at (6,5) now? Positions: the body segments are from index 1 to 14, but after move, the segment that was at (6,6) moves to (6,5)? Let's index.\n\nOld positions: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (4,5), 10: (5,5), 11: (5,6), 12: (6,6), 13: (6,5), 14: (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter move head to (4,1), new head (4,1), then body: the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0 old position, so (4,2) becomes body segment 1.\n\nThen index 2 moves to index 1 position, so (4,3) to where index 1 was, which is (4,2)? No.\n\nWhen moving, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo new head at (4,1)\n\nThen new segment 1: old head position (4,2)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,3)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 position (3,3)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 position (3,4)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 position (2,4)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 position (1,4)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 position (1,5)\n\nNew segment 8: old segment 7 position (2,5)\n\nNew segment 9: old segment 8 position (3,5)\n\nNew segment 10: old segment 9 position (4,5)\n\nNew segment 11: old segment 10 position (5,5)\n\nNew segment 12: old segment 11 position (5,6)\n\nNew segment 13: old segment 12 position (6,6)\n\nNew segment 14: old segment 13 position (6,5)\n\nAnd old segment 14 (6,4) is removed, so tail is at new segment 14 position, which is (6,5).\n\nAlso, the food at (6,5) was under body, but now the body moved, so (6,5) is now tail position, but the food is still there? When the body moves away, the food is revealed.\n\n(6,5) had food, and it was occupied by snake body, but after the snake moves, that cell is vacated, so the food is now accessible, but the tail is at (6,5) now? In this case, after move, new segment 14 is at (6,5), which is the same cell, so the food is under the tail now.\n\nCell (6,5): before turn 58, it was occupied by snake body (index 13), and has food.\n\nAfter snake moves without eating, the body moves, so the cell (6,5) is vacated, but since tail moves to (6,5)? New positions: new tail is at (6,5), which was the position of old segment 13.\n\nBut old segment 13 was at (6,5), and after move, new segment 14 is at old segment 13 position, so (6,5) is still occupied by snake, now the tail.\n\nSo the food is still under the snake tail, not accessible.\n\nTo eat it, the tail must move away, then head can move there.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nBack to turn 58.\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), then at (4,1), I can move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), I eat the food there, since (3,1) has food.\n\nThen snake grows: head moves to (3,1), and the tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,1), then (4,1) [previous head], (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), and tail (6,4) remains, so length 16 now.\n\nThen from (3,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: from (3,1), cannot move R (reverse), so can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is not occupied, free.\n\nD to (3,0): y=0 wall, die.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) free, no food.\n\nSo must move U or L.\n\nIf move U to (3,2), no food, then from there, etc.\n\nBut I'm at (3,1), which is bottom-left corner, so limited moves.\n\nIf from (4,1) I move right to (5,1), then head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: U, D, R, but not L (reverse).\n\nU to (5,2): but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (5,0): wall, die.\n\nR to (6,1): (6,1) free, no food.\n\nSo only possible move to (6,1), or if I could go U but wall, so only R to (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), I can go U or something.\n\nBut (6,1) is bottom-right, also corner.\n\nNot good for survival.\n\nSo if I go down to (4,1), I'm forced to move to (3,1) or (5,1), both lead to corners with limited escape.\n\nIf I go to (3,1) and eat, I'm at (3,1) with snake growing, but then from there, I can only go to (3,2) or (2,1), both possible but the area is cramped.\n\nNow, the other choice: on turn 58, move left to (3,2).\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nNo eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then body: (4,2) [previous head], (4,3) [prev seg1], (3,3) [prev seg2], (3,4) [prev seg3], (2,4) [prev seg4], (1,4) [prev seg5], (1,5) [prev seg6], (2,5) [prev seg7], (3,5) [prev seg8], (4,5) [prev seg9], (5,5) [prev seg10], (5,6) [prev seg11], (6,6) [prev seg12], (6,5) [prev seg13], tail at (6,4) removed? Old tail was (6,4), not occupied now.\n\nAfter move to (3,2), new head (3,2), body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)  and old segment 14 removed, so tail at (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food, and now it's the tail position, so food under tail.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nIf I move D to (3,1), I eat the food at (3,1), grow to 16.\n\nThen positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail, so tail at (6,5) with food under it.\n\nThen from (3,1), direction D (since moved down from (3,2) to (3,1)? From (3,2) to (3,1) is down, so direction D.\n\nThen from (3,1), moves: U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, or L to (2,1), or D to (3,0) wall, or R to (4,1) but reverse not allowed? Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,1) or D to (3,0) invalid, R to (4,1) is possible? From (3,1) to (4,1) is right, but current direction is D, so moving right is not reverse, reverse would be U.\n\nDirections: current direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,1)\n\nR to (4,1)\n\nBoth possible.\n\n(2,1) and (4,1) are free.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then to (1,1) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI need to consider the food at (6,5) which has life_span 4, so I have until turn 61 to eat it, but it's under the tail now.\n\nTo eat it, I need the tail to move away, then head to move there.\n\nTail is at (6,5), and it will move when the snake moves without eating.\n\nSimilarly, there is food at (1,3), which is not under body, and at (3,1) but I might eat it soon.\n\nAnother food at (1,3), life_span 7.\n\nNow, for survival, moving to (3,2) on turn 58 seems better because it opens up more space.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,2) on turn 59, then from (2,2), I can go to (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), etc.\n\nThe area around (2,2) has more freedom.\n\nWhereas if I go down to (4,1), I'm stuck in the bottom with few options.\n\nSo for long-term survival, moving left to (3,2) on turn 58 is better.\n\nThen from there, I can plan to eat the food at (1,3) or (3,1) or (6,5).\n\n(3,1) is below, (1,3) is left-up.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the left and top, so bottom-right has space.\n\nFree cells: let's list all free cells to see where I can go.\n\nPlayable cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (5,2) obstacle.\n\nOccupied by snake: as listed.\n\nFood cells: (6,2) but disappears after turn 58, so after turn 58, it's gone if not eaten.\n\n(6,5), (1,3), (3,1)\n\nBut (6,5) is under snake tail after move, so not free yet.\n\nAfter turn 58, if I move to (3,2), then positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5)\n\nSo occupied: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)\n\nFood at (1,3) and (3,1) are free, (6,5) occupied.\n\nFree cells: all other cells not in above list and not obstacle.\n\nFor example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) has food, (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,6), (3,1) has food, (3,6), (4,1), (4,4)? (4,4) not occupied, (4,6), (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2) but disappears, (6,3), (6,4) now free?

It doesn't specify, but since it's a sequence, I need to provide a plan for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state may change, so I should provide a sequence based on current state.\n\nSince no new food spawns, I can plan.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll provide actions for turns 58 to 62 or so.\n\nFirst, on turn 58, move L to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 59: from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nIf I move L to (2,2), I avoid eating now, keep snake shorter, more space.\n\nIf I move D to (3,1), I eat and grow, but then stuck at bottom.\n\nSo better to move L to (2,2) on turn 59.\n\nThen turn 60: from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), since (2,3) is free.\n\nThen at (2,3), as above, only move to (1,3) to eat, since other directions blocked.\n\nFrom (2,2), I could move D to (2,1) or L to (1,2), but let's see.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 60, then turn 61: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen snake grows, positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail, and new segment, so tail at (6,5).\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, collision; D to (1,2) free; L to (0,3) x=0 wall, invalid; R to (2,3) body, collision.\n\nAlso, current direction L, cannot move R.\n\nSo only possible move D to (1,2).\n\nThen to (1,2), etc.\n\nBut I have food at (6,5) to consider, with life_span 4.\n\nAt turn 58, life_span 4, available turns 58,59,60,61.\n\nAfter turn 61, gone.\n\nNow, to eat (6,5), I need the tail to move away.\n\nTail is at (6,5), and it will move when not eating.\n\nIn the sequence above, if I eat at (1,3) on turn 61, the tail doesn't move, so (6,5) still occupied.\n\nThen I need to move without eating to move the tail.\n\nBut after eating at (1,3), tail at (6,5), and I move to (1,2), then no eat, so tail moves.\n\nBut (6,5) might be vacated later.\n\nLet's think of a plan to eat (6,5).\n\nFirst, for turn 58, move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 59: from (3,2), move L to (2,2)  (so direction L)\n\nTurn 60: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)  (direction U)\n\nTurn 61: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat  (direction L)\n\nNow, after this, head at (1,3), direction L, and as above, only move D to (1,2) on turn 62.\n\nThen at (1,2), direction D (since moved down from (1,3) to (1,2)? From (1,3) to (1,2) is down, so direction D.\n\nThen from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3) body, collision; D to (1,1); L to (0,2) wall; R to (2,2) body, collision.\n\nCannot move U or R due to body or reverse? Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D to (1,1), L invalid, R invalid, so only D to (1,1).\n\nThen at (1,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (1,1), moves: U to (1,2) body; D to (1,0) wall; L to (0,1) wall; R to (2,1) free.\n\nSo only R to (2,1).\n\nThen to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) food is not eaten, and it disappears after turn 61, so I missed it.\n\nAt turn 58, (6,5) life_span 4, available turns 58,59,60,61.\n\nBut in this sequence, I'm on the left, not near (6,5).\n\nSo I need to go towards the right to eat (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) is under tail, so I need to move the snake to vacate it.\n\nFor example, if I move without eating, the tail moves.\n\nTail at (6,5), if I don't eat for a few turns, tail will move.\n\nFor instance, if I never eat, after 15 moves, the tail would have moved, but with eating, it stays.\n\nTo vacate (6,5), I need to not eat for one turn, then the tail moves from (6,5) to the next position.\n\nBut the next position depends on the movement.\n\nCurrently, after turn 58 move to (3,2), tail at (6,5).\n\nIf on turn 59, I move to (2,2), no eat, then tail moves from (6,5) to where? Old segment 12 was at (6,6), so new tail moves to (6,6)? Positions: after turn 59 move to (2,2), head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) and old tail (6,5) removed, so tail at (6,6).\n\nThen (6,5) is vacated, food revealed.\n\nThen I can move head to (6,5) to eat, but I need to be near.\n\nFrom (2,2), I'm far from (6,5).\n\nDistance is large, I may not reach in time.\n\nTurn 60,61, only two turns to go from (2,2) to (6,5), which is at least 4 steps, impossible in 2 turns.\n\nTurn 59: at (2,2), turn 60 I can move, but (6,5) is available until turn 61, so I can eat on turn 61.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (6,5): dx=4, dy=3, min steps 7, too far.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,5) from left in time.\n\nTherefore, to eat (6,5), I need to be closer.\n\nFor example, on turn 58, if I move down to (4,1), then I can go to (5,1) or (3,1), but still not close.\n\nFrom (4,1), move to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (6,2) but (6,2) food disappears after turn 58, so on turn 59, (6,2) gone.\n\nThen to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is above.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can go U to (6,2) gone, (6,3), then (6,4), then (6,5) on turn 61 or 62, but turn 61 last chance.\n\nTurn 59: from (4,1) to (5,1) or (3,1).\n\nSay to (5,1), then turn 60 to (6,1), turn 61 to (6,2) but gone, or to (6,2) not available, so to (6,2) not possible, to (5,2) obstacle, to (6,1) already, so from (6,1) move U to (6,2) but gone, or to (5,1) body, or (6,0) wall, so only U to (6,2) if available, but not, so if (6,2) gone, no move? (6,2) disappears after turn 58, so on turn 59, not there, so from (6,1), moves: U to (6,2) free but no food, or to other cells.\n\n(6,1) to U (6,2), D (6,0) wall, L (5,1) body, R invalid, so only U to (6,2) if free.\n\n(6,2) is free after turn 58.\n\nThen turn 61 from (6,2) to (6,3), then turn 62 to (6,4), but (6,5) available only until turn 61, so on turn 61, I can be at (6,4), then to (6,5) but turn 61 is the last chance to move to (6,5), so from (6,4) I can move to (6,5) on turn 61 if I am there.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (6,4) by turn 61.\n\nTurn 58: from (4,2) move D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 59: from (4,1) move R to (5,1)  (direction R)\n\nTurn 60: from (5,1) move R to (6,1)  (direction R)\n\nTurn 61: from (6,1) move U to (6,2)  (direction U)\n\nBut (6,2) is free, but not (6,5). On turn 61, I am at (6,2), and (6,5) is at y=5, I am at y=2, so I need to go up to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), but turn 61 I am at (6,2), move to (6,3) on turn 62, but (6,5) disappears after turn 61, so not available on turn 62, so I cannot eat (6,5).\n\nIf from (6,1) on turn 60, but turn 60 I am at (6,1), I can only move to (6,2) on turn 61, not to (6,5).\n\nSo impossible to eat (6,5) from the bottom path.\n\nTherefore, with the snake position, it's difficult to eat (6,5) in time, so I might have to forgo it.\n\nSimilarly, with the left move, I can eat (1,3) and (3,1) later.\n\n(3,1) has life_span 10, so I can eat it when convenient.\n\nSo for turn 58, move L to (3,2) is better.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: from (3,2) move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 60: from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 61: from (2,3) move L to (1,3) to eat\n\nThen turn 62: from (1,3) move D to (1,2)\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to specify for a few turns.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) can't be eaten, I'll ignore it.\n\nAlso, after eating (1,3), I can go to (1,2), then (2,1), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide actions for turns 58 to 62.\n\nSo turn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: L (from (3,2) to (2,2))\n\nTurn 60: U (from (2,2) to (2,3))\n\nTurn 61: L (from (2,3) to (1,3) eat)\n\nTurn 62: D (from (1,3) to (1,2))\n\nBut on turn 62, from (1,3) to (1,2) is down, so D.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, on turn 58, moving L to (3,2) is safe.\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), it might lead to death soon.\n\nSo I think L is better.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes avoiding immediate risks and positioning to access high-value areas while considering food life spans. The current state at turn 58 has the snake head at (4,2) with direction down (D). The grid is 6x6 (cells x=1-6, y=1-6), with an internal obstacle at (5,2) and walls at the borders. Food is all positive: (6,2) with life span 1 (disappears after turn 58), (6,5) with life span 4 (available until turn 61), (1,3) with life span 7 (available until turn 64), and (3,1) with life span 10 (available until turn 67). The snake has 15 segments, occupying a significant portion of the grid, so movement must avoid dead ends and body collisions.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 58 Move Options**: From head position (4,2) with direction D, possible moves are down (D) to (4,1) or left (L) to (3,2). Right (R) to (5,2) is blocked by the obstacle, and up (U) is forbidden due to no instant reverse. Moving down to (4,1) leads to a risky position with limited escape routes (only (3,1) or (5,1)), potentially trapping the snake. Moving left to (3,2) opens more space toward the less crowded left side of the grid, allowing better access to food at (1,3) and (3,1) with high life spans.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (6,2) cannot be eaten as it requires moving to (5,2) (obstacle) and disappears after turn 58.\n  - (6,5) is under the tail at turn 58 (after movement) and requires vacating the cell to eat, but it is too far to reach by turn 61 with the snake's position. Eating it is impractical and risky, so it is skipped.\n  - (1,3) and (3,1) have long life spans (7 and 10 turns), so they can be eaten later without rush. The plan targets (1,3) first as it is accessible from the left path.\n- **Survival Focus**: The snake must avoid corners and body collisions. Moving left on turn 58 avoids the bottom row, which has fewer escape options. The sequence then progresses toward (1,3) to eat safely while maintaining maneuverability.\n- **5-Turn Plan (Turns 58-62)**: This sequence eats (1,3) on turn 61, gaining +1 score and increasing length to 16. Subsequent moves ensure the snake stays in open areas. All moves respect no instant reverse and avoid walls/body.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 58**: Move L (left) to (3,2). This avoids the bottom row and positions the snake for safer exploration. Direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 59**: Move L (left) to (2,2). Continues left to approach (1,3) while keeping options open. Direction is L.\n- **Turn 60**: Move U (up) to (2,3). Moves toward (1,3); (2,3) is free, and no food is eaten. Direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 61**: Move L (left) to (1,3). Eats the food at (1,3) (value +1, life span 7), increasing length to 16. Direction is L.\n- **Turn 62**: Move D (down) to (1,2). From (1,3), only D is safe (U leads to body, L/R to walls). This moves away from the top-left corner. Direction changes to D.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The path avoids the obstacle at (5,2) and the crowded bottom/right areas. Eating (1,3) on turn 61 is safe as the head is not adjacent to the tail.\n- **Long-Term View**: After turn 62, the snake can access (3,1) or other areas, with (3,1) still available for many turns. The sequence maintains flexibility for future turns beyond 5.\n- **Efficiency**: (6,5) is skipped as it is unreachable safely within its life span, and (3,1) can be eaten later when convenient.\n\nThis plan scores +1 by turn 62 and sets up for further food collection with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: L \\\\\nTurn 59: L \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: L \\\\\nTurn 62: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 59, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid size is from (0,0) to (7,7), I think, with walls on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,2), and the body segments follow: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). The last one is (6,5), which is the tail.\n\nSnake head direction is L, which means left, so the head is moving left. Since it's at (3,2) and direction is L, it must have come from the right, so previous position was (4,2), which matches the second segment.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (3,1) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. Life span decreases each turn, so for (6,5), it has 4 turns left including this one, meaning it will disappear after turn 62 or something? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, including the current turn. So if life span is 4 at turn 59, it will be gone by turn 63? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, life span L means:\n\n- After turn t, L decreases by 1.\n\n- It can be eaten until turn t + L - 1, I think? Let's think carefully.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span N. After turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes N-1. After turn t+1, it becomes N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So it can be eaten on any turn from t to t+N-1, and after turn t+N-1, it's gone.\n\nFor example, at turn 59, food at (6,5) has life span 4, so:\n\n- Turn 59: can be eaten, life span 4\n\n- After turn 59, life span 3\n\n- Turn 60: can be eaten, life span 3\n\n- Turn 61: can be eaten, life span 2\n\n- Turn 62: can be eaten, life span 1\n\n- After turn 62, life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 63.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 6: available from turn 59 to 64.\n\n(3,1) life span 9: available from turn 59 to 67.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (3,2), moving left. So from (3,2), possible moves: U (up to (3,3)? y+1 is up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The walls: y=0 and y=7, and snake positions have y from 2 to 6, so probably y increases upwards or downwards? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)\n\n(6,5) and (6,6), so y=5 and y=6, with walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is top or bottom? Since (1,5) and (1,4), y=4 lower than y=5? Let's list y-values: 2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,5. So y=2 to 6, and walls at y=0 and y=7. Probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so increasing y is up.\n\nSimilarly, x from 1 to 6, walls x=0 and x=7.\n\nSo U: (x, y+1) up\n\nD: (x, y-1) down\n\nL: (x-1, y) left\n\nR: (x+1, y) right\n\nHead at (3,2), direction L, so coming from right.\n\nCurrent possible moves: since direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) immediately, so possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check what cells are occupied.\n\nFirst, snake body: let's list all positions to avoid collision.\n\nSnake segments: (3,2) head, (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is the tail.\n\nAlso, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nNow, food at (6,5), but (6,5) is currently occupied by the snake tail! (6,5) is part of the snake, it's the tail.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) and (3,1) are food positions.\n\n(6,5) has food, but it's under the snake's body, specifically the tail.\n\nAccording to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (6,5) is occupied by tail, so if the snake moves such that tail moves away, then head could potentially move to (6,5) later to eat it, but only if head moves there after the tail leaves.\n\nBut for now, at turn 59, (6,5) has food but is occupied, so cannot eat immediately.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), possible moves: U, D, L. Cannot R because reverse.\n\nMove L to (2,2)? Is (2,2) free?\n\nCheck if (2,2) is wall or body or obstacle.\n\nWalls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so (2,2) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,2), not (2,2).\n\nSnake body: positions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), etc. (2,2) not in list, so free? But is it a food? Food at (6,5), (1,3), (3,1), not (2,2). So (2,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, U to (3,3): (3,3) is a body segment, occupied. Snake positions include (3,3), which is the fourth segment.\n\nPositions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (3,3), yes, (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) is a food position, and is it occupied? Snake positions: all have y>=2 except... (3,1) has y=1, which is above y=0? y=0 is wall, y=1 is valid cell? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n\n(3,1) not in snake positions, not wall, and not obstacle (obstacle is (5,2)), so (3,1) is free, but has food? Food at (3,1) with value 1.\n\n(3,1) is a food cell, so moving D to (3,1) would eat the food if possible.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,2):\n\n- L to (2,2): empty cell\n\n- U to (3,3): occupied by body, collision if move there, since head touches body segment.\n\n- D to (3,1): has food, and not occupied, so can move there to eat food.\n\nBut we need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, cannot move R, but (4,2) is behind, occupied.\n\nSo only possible moves: L or D. U is blocked by body at (3,3).\n\nU to (3,3) is occupied, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nD to (3,1) is free, has food.\n\nL to (2,2) is free, no food.\n\nNow, if I move D to (3,1), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (3,1), and tail stays, so snake length increases by one.\n\nCurrent snake length: positions have 15 segments? List: 1. (3,2), 2. (4,2), 3. (4,3), 4. (3,3), 5. (3,4), 6. (2,4), 7. (1,4), 8. (1,5), 9. (2,5), 10. (3,5), 11. (4,5), 12. (5,5), 13. (5,6), 14. (6,6), 15. (6,5) — 15 positions, so length 15.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (3,1), and a new segment is added at the end, so tail was (6,5), now new tail will be... when snake moves, all segments shift.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves forward, so tail cell is vacated. If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment is added, so tail doesn't move, effectively snake grows.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,1) and eat food, new head is (3,1), and the body: previous head (3,2) becomes body, then (4,2), etc., up to tail (6,5), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., (6,6), (6,5) — but (6,5) was tail, now it's the second last, and new tail is (6,5) still? Let's think.\n\nAfter moving head to new position:\n\n- If no food, head moves, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n\n- If food eaten, head moves to food, each body segment moves to previous position, but tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: new head at (3,1), then the previous head (3,2) becomes second segment, then (4,2) which was second becomes third, and so on, up to the previous tail (6,5) which was last, now becomes second last, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail position is where the tail was, but tail was (6,5), and it moves? When growing, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the same as old tail position.\n\nExample: suppose snake positions A-B-C, head A, tail C. Move head to D (with food), new positions D-A-B-C, so C is still tail.\n\nIn this case, from (3,2) to (3,1), eat food, new head (3,1), then body: (3,2) (which was head), then (4,2) (was second), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), and tail (6,5) remains, so new snake: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) — now 16 positions, with tail (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) has food under it, and it's still occupied? Food at (6,5) is under the tail.\n\nNow, after move, head is at (3,1), direction would be D, since moved down.\n\nBut we need to think about future moves.\n\nFirst, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail food: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,1), the tail is at (6,5), far away, not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (6,5). It has life span 4, so available for 4 more turns including this one.\n\nAt turn 59, if I don't eat it now, it might be available later.\n\nBut (6,5) is occupied by tail, so to eat it, I need to move the tail away and then head to (6,5).\n\nCurrently, head is at (3,2), far from (6,5).\n\nOther food: (1,3) life span 6, and (3,1) life span 9.\n\n(3,1) is close, at (3,2) below it.\n\nAlso, (1,3) is at top-left, snake has segments at (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), etc.\n\nNow, back to current turn choices.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can:\n\n- Move L to (2,2): empty, no food. Then head at (2,2), direction L.\n\n- Move D to (3,1): eat food, grow to 16, head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nMove U is invalid, occupied.\n\nSo only two options: L or D.\n\nIf I move D, I eat (3,1) food, get +1, but I need to see if it's safe and what opportunities I miss.\n\nIf I move L, I go to (2,2), no food, then I can plan to go to other places.\n\nBut let's think ahead 5 turns.\n\nFirst, consider moving D to (3,1).\n\nAfter turn 59: head to (3,1), eat food, snake grows. New head direction D.\n\nFood consumed: (3,1) gone.\n\nOther food: (6,5) life span now 3 (after turn 59), (1,3) life span 5.\n\n(6,5) is still under tail at (6,5), but tail is now part of body, not tail? After growth, tail is (6,5), but in the new positions, tail is (6,5), and it has food under it.\n\nThe food is at (6,5), and the cell is occupied by snake tail.\n\nTo eat it, snake must move so that tail moves away, then head moves to (6,5).\n\nBut tail moving away means the snake moves, so tail position changes.\n\nCurrently, after turn 59, if I ate (3,1), snake positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail.\n\nFrom head (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) — but (3,2) is body, occupied, cannot move there, collision.\n\nD to (3,0) — y=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nL to (2,1) — is it free? (2,1) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle, no food, so free.\n\nR to (4,1) — free? (4,1) not occupied, not wall, etc.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so from (3,1), after moving down, direction is D, so for next move, cannot move U (opposite).\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n\n- U: opposite, invalid\n\n- D: to (3,0), wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (2,1)\n\n- R: to (4,1)\n\nBoth (2,1) and (4,1) should be free.\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions.\n\nSimilarly (4,1).\n\nNo food there.\n\nSo I can move L or R.\n\nBut this is after eating, but at turn 60.\n\nI need to simulate.\n\nPerhaps better to consider the other option first.\n\nAlternative: at turn 59, move L to (2,2).\n\nThen, head to (2,2), no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nCurrent tail is (6,5), when snake moves without eating, head to (2,2), then body shifts, so (3,2) becomes second segment, (4,2) third, ..., up to (6,6) becomes second last, and tail (6,5) is removed, so new tail is (6,6) or something.\n\nPositions: after move to (2,2), new head (2,2), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, then (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), and tail was (6,5), but since no growth, tail moves off, so new positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) — 15 segments, tail at (6,6).\n\nFood at (6,5) is now free, since tail moved away, but life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 59, after move, food at (6,5) life span 4, but after turn 59, it decreases to 3, and it's now free to be eaten.\n\nBut head is at (2,2), far away.\n\nAlso, food at (1,3) and (3,1) still there.\n\nNow, from (2,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, so cannot R.\n\nDirection is L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,3): is it free? (2,3) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle, no food, so free.\n\nD to (2,1): free, as before.\n\nL to (1,2): x=1,y=2, not wall, not occupied? Positions: (1,4), (1,5), not (1,2), so free.\n\nNo food at these.\n\nSo from (2,2), I can go U, D, or L.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (1,3) and (3,1).\n\n(1,3) is at top-left, (3,1) bottom.\n\nAlso, (6,5) food is now free but life span 3 left.\n\nSince I need to maximize score and survive, I should consider going towards food, but with caution.\n\nBut there's a risk with the tail food at (6,5), but it's not near head.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,6) after this move, and (6,5) has food, so if head goes to (6,5), it can eat it, but need to check if adjacent to tail.\n\nFirst, let's plan for multiple turns.\n\nI should also consider the board state.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, but walls on border, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,2)\n\nBody: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) tail.\n\nFood: (6,5) under tail, (1,3), (3,1)\n\nNow, at turn 59, if I move D to (3,1), I eat (3,1) food, grow to 16, head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen at turn 60, from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1), since U and D invalid.\n\nSay I move L to (2,1) for example.\n\nThen head to (2,1), no food, tail moves: since no growth, tail moves forward.\n\nAfter turn 59, snake: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), ..., (6,6), (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), new head (2,1), then (3,1) becomes body, (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), and tail (6,5) moves off, so new tail is (6,6)? Positions: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) — tail at (6,6).\n\nFood at (6,5) is free now.\n\nHead at (2,1), direction L (since moved left from (3,1)? From (3,1) to (2,1) is left, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied.\n\nSo U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) is free? Not occupied, yes. (1,1) free.\n\nNo food.\n\nThen I can go to (1,1) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut this seems messy, and I might miss the other food.\n\nIf at turn 59 I move L to (2,2), then head at (2,2), tail at (6,6), food at (6,5) free.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move towards (1,3) food.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is adjacent to (1,4) which is body.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), or R but R to (3,2) occupied.\n\nSay I move U to (2,3) at turn 60.\n\nThen head to (2,3), no food, tail moves to (5,6) or something.\n\nAfter turn 59 move to (2,2), positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) tail.\n\nMove U to (2,3) at turn 60: new head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), tail (6,6) moves off, so new positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) tail at (5,6).\n\nFood at (1,3) is at (1,3), which is adjacent to head? Head at (2,3), (1,3) is left, so I can move L to (1,3) at turn 61.\n\nFrom (2,3), direction U (since moved up from (2,2)? From (2,2) to (2,3) is up, so direction U.\n\nAt turn 61, from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, occupied (in positions, (2,4) is part of snake).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), etc., and (2,4) is also body, so U to (2,4) collision.\n\nD to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (1,3), which has food.\n\nR to (3,3), which is body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (1,3), to eat food.\n\nThen at turn 61, move to (1,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew head (1,3), direction L.\n\nThen snake grows, new tail position same as before.\n\nBut now, head at (1,3), and the body includes (1,4), (1,5), etc., so (1,4) is adjacent to (1,3), but (1,4) is body segment, so if I move to (1,3), it's fine, but after moving, head at (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), etc., and (1,4) is still there.\n\nAfter eating (1,3), new positions: head (1,3), then previous head (2,3) becomes body, then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), and tail (5,6) remains, so (1,4) is still body.\n\nFrom head (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4), but (1,4) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nD to (1,2), which might be free.\n\nL to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,3), but (2,3) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,2), if free.\n\n(1,2) not occupied, not wall, so yes.\n\nMove D to (1,2), no food, etc.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nMoreover, in this path, I ate (1,3) at turn 61.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 59 decision.\n\nIf at turn 59 I move D to (3,1), I eat (3,1) immediately, but then I'm at (3,1) with limited moves, as I saw.\n\nBut (3,1) has a food with long life span, 9, so eating it now is fine, but I might be able to eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has life span 6, so I can eat it in a few turns.\n\nBut there's also (6,5) with short life span 4, which might expire soon.\n\nBut (6,5) is far, and snake is long, it might be hard to reach in time.\n\nDistance from head to (6,5): from (3,2) to (6,5), dx=3, dy=3, so Manhattan distance 6, but with body in way, it might take more turns.\n\nMinimum turns to reach (6,5) is 6, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), to (6,5), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut directly, R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, so I cannot go right immediately.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2), then I can go to (2,3), etc., but it's a detour.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can only go L or D now.\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), then from there I can go R to (4,1), then to (5,1), but (5,1) has obstacle at (5,2), so (5,1) might be free, then to (6,1), then up to (6,2), but (6,2) is near wall, y=2, then to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), but many turns.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,5), at least 5 or 6 turns.\n\nBut (6,5) life span 4, so if I don't eat it by turn 62, it disappears.\n\nTurn 59: life span 4, can be eaten on turn 59,60,61,62.\n\nAfter turn 62, gone.\n\nSo to eat (6,5), I need to be at (6,5) by turn 62 at the latest.\n\nBut from current position, with snake body, it's unlikely to reach in 3 turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 59, if I move towards it, but I can only go L or D, both away from (6,5).\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), even farther.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2), then at turn 60 I can go to (2,3) or something, still far.\n\nFrom (2,2), to (6,5), dx=4, dy=3, distance 7, and with body, it will take at least 7 turns, but life span only 3 more turns (after turn 59, life span 3, so must eat by turn 62, only 3 turns left including turn 60,61,62.\n\nTurn 59: if I move, after turn 59, life span decreases to 3 for (6,5).\n\nThen on turn 60,61,62 it can be eaten.\n\nBut from (3,2), after moving to (2,2) at turn 59, head at (2,2), then to reach (6,5) in 3 moves: impossible, since Manhattan distance 7.\n\nEven from closer, it's far.\n\nMoreover, the path might be blocked.\n\nSo probably, I cannot reach (6,5) in time to eat it before it expires.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to ignore (6,5) and focus on other food.\n\n(6,5) will disappear soon, and since it's under the tail, and tail moves away when I move, but I can't reach it.\n\nSo perhaps forget about (6,5).\n\nThen, I have two food: (1,3) and (3,1), with life span 6 and 9 respectively.\n\nBoth can be eaten later.\n\nAt turn 59, from (3,2), moving D to (3,1) eats (3,1) immediately, getting +1.\n\nMoving L to (2,2) doesn't eat, but I can go to (1,3) in a few turns.\n\nBut as I saw earlier, if I go to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), I can eat (1,3) at turn 61.\n\nIn that case, I eat one food later.\n\nIf I eat (3,1) now, I get it immediately.\n\nBut after eating (3,1), I'm at (3,1) with only left and right moves, and I might be stuck or something.\n\nFrom (3,1), after moving down, I can go to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nSay I go to (4,1), then to (5,1), but (5,2) is obstacle, so from (5,1) I can go up to (5,2)? (5,2) is obstacle, cannot, so only left, right, down, but down to (5,0) wall, left to (4,1) back, right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,1) to (6,1) is possible, then to (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n\nBut no immediate danger, but the area is tight.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then to (1,1), then I can go up to (1,2), (1,3), but (1,3) has food, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's compare the scores.\n\nIf I move D at turn 59, I eat (3,1) at turn 59, score +1.\n\nThen at later turns, I can eat (1,3).\n\nIf I move L at turn 59, I don't eat now, but I can eat (1,3) at turn 61, as in the earlier path, and (3,1) is still there with life span 9, so I can eat it later.\n\nIn the move L path, I can eat (1,3) at turn 61, and (3,1) is available until turn 67, so I can go back to eat it.\n\nBut after eating (1,3), I'm at (1,3), and I can go down to (1,2), then to (1,1) or (2,2), etc., and eventually to (3,1).\n\nFor example, from (1,3) after eating, I move D to (1,2), then from (1,2) I can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1), etc.\n\nSo I can eat both.\n\nBut if I eat (3,1) first, I might have a shorter path to (1,3)? Not necessarily.\n\nAlso, I need to consider survival.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (3,1), the snake is longer, 16 vs 15, but that might make it harder to maneuver, but not immediately.\n\nBut in the corner at (3,1), it might be risky.\n\nLet's think about the board and possible traps.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (5,2) might block some paths.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies many cells.\n\nFor example, the area around (3,2) to (1,5) is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, cells like (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc. are body.\n\nFree cells are, for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) food, (2,1), (2,2) if not occupied, (2,3) might be free at some point, etc.\n\nIn the current state, at turn 59, free cells include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) food, (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) food, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) food but occupied, etc.\n\n(6,5) is occupied, so not free.\n\nAfter moving, it may change.\n\nBut to avoid risk, I should not go to dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,1), from there, I can only go to (2,1) or (4,1), both are open, so not dead end.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is fine.\n\nNow, the key point is the \"tail reward danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (6,5) with food, but head is not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, it might be.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake such that head is near tail and tail has food.\n\nBut in this case, after I move, tail might move.\n\nFor instance, if at turn 59 I move L to (2,2), tail moves to (6,6), food at (6,5) free, but head at (2,2) not adjacent.\n\nThen when I go to eat (1,3), tail is at (5,6) or something, not near.\n\nSo probably no immediate danger.\n\nTherefore, both options seem possible, but eating (3,1) now gives immediate reward, and I can still eat (1,3) later.\n\nWhereas not eating now delays the reward.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating sooner is better for score, but I need to survive, so no big difference.\n\nBut in terms of opportunity, (3,1) has longer life span, so I can eat it later, but (1,3) has shorter, life span 6, so I should eat it sooner to not miss it.\n\nLife span at turn 59: (1,3) life span 6, so available until turn 64 (turns 59 to 64).\n\n(3,1) until turn 67.\n\n(6,5) until turn 62.\n\nSince (6,5) unreachable, focus on (1,3) and (3,1).\n\n(1,3) must be eaten within 6 turns, (3,1) within 9.\n\nIf I move to (2,2) at turn 59, I can eat (1,3) by turn 61, as earlier.\n\nIf I move to (3,1) at turn 59, I eat it now, but then to eat (1,3), I need to go from (3,1) to (1,3), which is left and up, but with body.\n\nFrom (3,1), after eating, at turn 60, I move say R to (4,1), then at turn 61 to (5,1), then at turn 62 to (6,1), then to (6,2), but (6,2) might be free, then to (6,3), etc., but to (1,3) it's far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,3), I can go to (2,1) at turn 60, then to (1,1) at turn 61, then to (1,2) at turn 62, then to (1,3) at turn 63.\n\nBut (1,3) life span 6, at turn 59, after turn 59 life span 5, turn 60:4, turn 61:3, turn 62:2, turn 63:1, can be eaten, turn 64:0 gone, so on turn 63 I can eat it.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,3) at turn 63.\n\nIf I start from turn 59 at (3,1), turn 60 to (2,1), turn 61 to (1,1), turn 62 to (1,2), turn 63 to (1,3), eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go the other way, turn 60 to (4,1), it takes longer to reach (1,3).\n\nBut I can eat (1,3) by turn 63.\n\nIn the other path, if I move L at turn 59 to (2,2), turn 60 to (2,3), turn 61 to (1,3) eat, so at turn 61 I eat it, earlier.\n\nSo by not eating (3,1) now, I can eat (1,3) sooner, at turn 61 vs turn 63.\n\nAnd I can still eat (3,1) later.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3) at turn 61, I'm at (1,3), then move to (1,2) at turn 62, then to (2,2) or (1,1), say to (2,2) at turn 62, then to (3,2) at turn 63, but (3,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating (1,3) at turn 61, positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) tail? Let's not digress.\n\nPoint is, I can reach (3,1) from there.\n\nBut (3,1) has long life, so no rush.\n\nTherefore, to maximize, I should eat (1,3) first since it has shorter life, and I can do it faster by not eating (3,1) now.\n\nThat is, at turn 59, move L to (2,2), then proceed to eat (1,3) at turn 61.\n\nThen later eat (3,1).\n\nMoreover, by not moving to (3,1) now, I avoid being in a corner temporarily.\n\nAlso, at (3,1), after moving down, I cannot go up or down, only left/right, but it's fine.\n\nBut the path to (1,3) is shorter from (2,2) than from (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,2), moving L to (2,2) is closer to (1,3).\n\nDistance to (1,3): from (3,2) Manhattan |3-1| + |2-3| = 2+1=3\n\nFrom (3,1) after moving D, |3-1| + |1-3| =2+2=4, but with body, it might be similar.\n\nBut in practice, as above, it takes 2 turns from (2,2) to (1,3) vs 4 turns from (3,1).\n\nIn the move L case: from (3,2) to (2,2) turn 59, then to (2,3) turn 60, then to (1,3) turn 61, 3 turns including eating at 61.\n\nIn move D case: from (3,2) to (3,1) turn 59 eat, then to (2,1) turn 60, to (1,1) turn 61, to (1,2) turn 62, to (1,3) turn 63 eat, 5 turns to eat (1,3) from start, vs 3 turns in the other.\n\nAnd (1,3) might expire if delayed, but with life span 6, it can be eaten by turn 64, so turn 63 is ok, but earlier is better to free up space or something.\n\nBut for score, same, but for efficiency, eating sooner might allow eating more later.\n\nBut in this case, no other food soon.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (1,3) early, I can then go to other areas.\n\nBut let's decide.\n\nAlso, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 59.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nLet me outline a plan.\n\nOption 1: Move D at turn 59 to eat (3,1)\n\nThen at turn 60, from (3,1), move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1). Say move L to (2,1) to go towards (1,3)\n\nTurn 61: from (2,1), move U to (2,2)? Or to (1,1) or (2,2) but (2,2) might be free.\n\nAfter turn 59: snake head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), ..., (6,6), (6,5) tail.\n\nTurn 60: move L to (2,1), no food, so tail moves: new head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), ..., (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5) removed, so tail at (6,6)? Positions: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) tail.\n\nFrom (2,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 61: possible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1), R to (3,2) occupied.\n\nSo U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nSay move U to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is free, no food.\n\nNew head (2,2), then body shifts, tail moves to (5,6)? Positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) tail.\n\nFrom (2,2), direction U.\n\nTurn 62: possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) occupied, L to (1,2), R to (3,2) occupied.\n\n(2,1) is body, so D invalid.\n\nU to (2,3) if free, L to (1,2) if free.\n\n(2,3) not occupied, free. (1,2) free.\n\nSay move L to (1,2) to go to (1,3).\n\nNew head (1,2), no food.\n\nThen turn 63: from (1,2), move U to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nDirection L or U? From (1,2) to (1,3) is up, so U.\n\nThen eat (1,3) at turn 63.\n\nAs before.\n\nOption 2: Move L at turn 59 to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 60: from (2,2), move U to (2,3) (as earlier, to reach (1,3))\n\nAfter turn 59 move L: head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) tail.\n\nTurn 60: move U to (2,3), no food, new head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) tail.\n\nFrom (2,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 61: as before, only possible move L to (1,3) to eat, since other directions occupied.\n\nMove to (1,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew head (1,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 62: from (1,3), only possible move D to (1,2), as U, L, R invalid.\n\nMove to (1,2), no food.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIn this case, I ate (1,3) at turn 61, earlier than in option 1.\n\nAnd I didn't eat (3,1) yet, so I can go to eat it later.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) at turn 62, I can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1), say R to (2,2) at turn 62.\n\nThen from (2,2), at turn 63, I can move D to (2,1) or U to (2,3) but (2,3) might be body, etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), I can go to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nLet's not detail.\n\nPoint is, by choosing to move L at turn 59, I can eat (1,3) at turn 61, whereas if I move D, I eat (1,3) at turn 63.\n\nBoth get both foods, but in the first case, I eat (1,3) sooner, and since its life span is shorter, it might be safer, and I have the option to eat (3,1) later with no rush.\n\nMoreover, in the move L case, I avoid the (3,1) corner early on.\n\nTherefore, I think it's better to move L at turn 59.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the food at (6,5), it will disappear soon, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nNow, output actions for 5 turns? The answer should be a sequence starting from turn 59.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nHow many to output? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output a sequence for 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut in the format, it might be for a few turns.\n\nSince I need to prioritize long-term, I'll plan for 5 turns.\n\nStart from turn 59.\n\nAction at turn 59: Move L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 60: from (2,2), move U to (2,3) to set up for (1,3)\n\nThen turn 61: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nThen after that, at turn 62, from (1,3), only possible move is D to (1,2), as we saw.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output up to turn 63 or so.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and I need to survive.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, confirm the direction.\n\nAt turn 59, head at (3,2), direction L, move L to (2,2), so new direction L.\n\nTurn 60: head at (2,2), direction L, move U to (2,3), so new direction U.\n\nTurn 61: head at (2,3), direction U, but I move L to (1,3). Is L opposite to U? U is up, L is left, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nMove L to (1,3), eat food, new head (1,3), direction L.\n\nNow turn 62: from (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, occupied; D to (1,2) free; L to (0,3) wall; R to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, occupied. So only D to (1,2).\n\nMove D to (1,2), no food, new head (1,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 63: from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3) but just left, occupied? After moving to (1,2), the positions: head (1,2), then previous head (1,3) becomes body? After turn 61: positions with (1,3) head, then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nAfter turn 61 move to (1,3) eat, new positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) tail.\n\nThen turn 62: move D to (1,2), no food, so tail moves: new head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail? Tail was (5,6), moves off, so new tail at (5,5)? Positions: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nFrom (1,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 63: possible moves: U to (1,3) occupied (body), D to (1,1) free, L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2) occupied? (2,2) is body, yes occupied.\n\nSo only D to (1,1).\n\nMove to (1,1), no food.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output turns 59 to 63.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 59: L\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: L (to eat (1,3))\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: D (to (1,1))\n\nBut at turn 63, I go to (1,1), which is fine.\n\nThen I can continue to go to (2,1), (3,1) to eat the other food later.\n\nBut since the sequence is for a few turns, this should be ok.\n\nIn this plan, I didn't eat (3,1) yet, but it's available for long.\n\nTo be complete, but I think for the answer, outputting 5 turns is sufficient.\n\nNow, about the tail food danger: in this sequence, no issue.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (1,3) at turn 61, the tail is at (5,5) or something, not adjacent, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other risks.\n\nTherefore, I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (6,5) has a short life span (4 turns, including turn 59) and is currently under the tail. Reaching it in time is impractical (Manhattan distance from head is 6, but body blocks direct paths; minimum 6+ turns needed, but food expires after turn 62). Ignore this food.\n  - (1,3) has a moderate life span (6 turns, available until turn 64) and is closer to the head. Eating it quickly is efficient to avoid missing it.\n  - (3,1) has a long life span (9 turns, available until turn 67) and can be eaten later without rush.\n\n- **Immediate Moves from (3,2) with Direction L**:\n  - U to (3,3): Blocked by body (collision risk).\n  - D to (3,1): Eats (3,1) food immediately but traps the snake in a corner with limited moves (only L/R possible from (3,1)). This delays reaching (1,3) until turn 63, increasing risk of missing it if delayed further.\n  - L to (2,2): Safe, empty cell. Positions the snake closer to (1,3) for efficient eating by turn 61.\n\nMoving L at turn 59 is optimal: it avoids the corner, allows eating (1,3) faster (by turn 61 vs. turn 63 if moving D), and preserves the option to eat (3,1) later.\n\n- **5-Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 59**: Move L to (2,2). Empty cell, no food. New head position: (2,2). Direction: L.\n  - **Turn 60**: Move U to (2,3). Empty cell, no food. New head position: (2,3). Direction: U. Sets up direct path to (1,3).\n  - **Turn 61**: Move L to (1,3). Eats (1,3) food (+1 score, snake grows to length 16). New head position: (1,3). Direction: L.\n  - **Turn 62**: Move D to (1,2). Only safe move (U, L, R blocked by body/wall). Empty cell, no food. New head position: (1,2). Direction: D.\n  - **Turn 63**: Move D to (1,1). Only safe move (U, R blocked; L is wall). Empty cell, no food. New head position: (1,1). Direction: D. Positions snake to later navigate toward (3,1) via e.g., (2,1) or (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1).\n\n- **Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 63)**:\n  - Eat (3,1) food: From (1,1), move to (2,1) (turn 64), then to (3,1) (turn 65) for +1 score. Life span allows this safely.\n  - Survival: The snake has ample space; no dead ends or collision risks in this sequence. Avoid areas near walls/obstacles until (3,1) is eaten.\n  - Score Maximization: This plan secures both available foods efficiently: (1,3) by turn 61 and (3,1) by ~turn 65. (6,5) is ignored due to inaccessibility.\n\n**Final Action Sequence (Turns 59-63)**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 59: L\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: L\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 60, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead. The grid has walls and obstacles, so I must avoid those as well as the snake's own body.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- Walls: Border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but since borders are walls, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning columns 0 and 7 are entirely walls. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so rows 0 and 7 are walls. Playable area should be x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All cells with x=0 or x=7 for any y, and y=0 or y=7 for any x. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nBut since it's specified as border cells, I think it's implicit that all cells on the border are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are all walls. But the description says \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", which means any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. Additionally, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n**Snake Positions:**\nThe snake is a list of segments: head is (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6). So that's 15 segments, meaning the snake length is 15.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so the snake is currently moving left. Last move was left to (2,2) from (3,2)? Positions are given in order, head first, so from (2,2) to (3,2) etc., but head is at (2,2), and it moved left to there, so previous position was (3,2), and it moved left to (2,2). So current direction is left.\n\n**Food:**\nThree food items:\n1. (6,5) with value 1, life span 3\n2. (1,3) with value 1, life span 5\n3. (3,1) with value 1, life span 8\n\nAll are positive food since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (6,5), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 60, life span 3, so it will be gone by turn 63? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nDefinition: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (6,5) with life_span 3 on turn 60:\n- Turn 60: life_span 3, present\n- Turn 61: life_span 2, present\n- Turn 62: life_span 1, present\n- Turn 63: life_span 0, disappears? Or after turn 63?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, so on turn t + N, it's gone.\n\nBut \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn t, life_span is L, then on turn t+1, it's L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So when life_span becomes 0, it should be gone at the start of that turn or something.\n\nTypically, it might be that on the turn when life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the snake moves or after. But to be precise, let's assume that at the beginning of each turn, the life_span decreases, and if it becomes 0, the food is removed before the snake moves for that turn.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that food with life_span L on turn t will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone on turn t+L.\n\nFor example, food at (6,5) with life_span 3 on turn 60:\n- Present on turn 60 (life_span 3)\n- Present on turn 61 (life_span 2)\n- Present on turn 62 (life_span 1)\n- Gone on turn 63 (life_span 0)\n\nSimilarly for others:\n- (1,3) life_span 5: present turns 60 to 64, gone turn 65\n- (3,1) life_span 8: present turns 60 to 67, gone turn 68\n\nAll food has value +1, so eating any grows the snake by one.\n\nNow, I need to plan the moves for the next 5 turns: turns 61 to 65? Current turn is t1=60, so I need actions for turn 60? No.\n\nThe answer format is for actions starting from turn t1.\n\nLook: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\"\n\nCurrent turn is t1=60, so I need to output the action for turn 60, then turn 61, up to at least turn 64 or 65? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and the output should include multiple turns.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... ... }\n\nSo for t1=60, I need to output actions for turn 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, and perhaps more if I think further, but at least 5 turns.\n\nBut turn 60 is the current turn, and I need to decide the action for this turn based on the state.\n\nThe state is given for turn 60, so I need to choose an action for turn 60, then for turn 61, etc.\n\nIn the state, head direction is L, meaning it just moved left to (2,2), so for turn 60, I can choose to move U, D, L, or R, but with no instant reverse, so since it came from left (direction L), I cannot move right (opposite) on the next move, which is turn 60.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is the direction the head is facing, which is L. So for turn 60, I cannot move R (right), because that would be opposite to L.\n\nAllowed moves from (2,2) with current direction L: not R, so U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's map out the grid.\n\nFirst, grid size: walls at borders, so x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Except internal obstacle at (5,2), which is also a wall.\n\n(5,2) is within playable area, but it's an obstacle, so snake cannot move there.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]\n\nSo in order: head (2,2), then body: (3,2), (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), tail (6,6)\n\nNow, food at:\n- (6,5) - value 1, life 3\n- (1,3) - value 1, life 5\n- (3,1) - value 1, life 8\n\nCurrent head position: (2,2)\n\nPossible moves for turn 60:\n- U: (x,y+1) = (2,3)\n- D: (x,y-1) = (2,1)\n- L: (x-1,y) = (1,2)\n- R: (x+1,y) = (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by body, so collision if I move there. Also, R is opposite to current direction L? No, current direction is L, so R is opposite, and cannot move opposite anyway, so R is not allowed.\n\nFirst, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- Move U to (2,3): is this free? (2,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc., but (2,3) is not listed. Let's list all snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6). So (2,3) is not occupied, and not a wall? Walls: borders, so (2,3) x=2,y=3, between 1 and 6, not border, and not (5,2) obstacle. (5,2) is obstacle, but (2,3) is fine. So (2,3) is empty.\n\n- Move D to (2,1): (2,1) y=1, which is not y=0, so not border wall. y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable. And not obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake positions all y>=2 except? (2,2) is y=2, (3,2) y=2, etc. (2,1) not listed, so empty.\n\n- Move L to (1,2): (1,2) x=1, not x=0, so not border. Not obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,2), so should be empty.\n\n(1,2) is not listed, so yes.\n\nBut L is the current direction, moving left to (1,2).\n\nNow, R is not allowed and occupied.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the food positions and their life spans.\n\nFood at (6,5): life span 3, so only available for 3 turns including current, so turns 60,61,62, gone on 63.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life 5: turns 60-64, gone 65.\n\n(3,1) life 8: turns 60-67, gone 68.\n\nNow, head at (2,2), I need to go towards food, but also avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's find paths to food.\n\nDistance to (6,5): from (2,2) to (6,5), delta x=4, delta y=3, Manhattan distance 7, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,3): from (2,2) to (1,3), delta x=-1, delta y=1, distance 2.\n\nTo (3,1): from (2,2) to (3,1), delta x=1, delta y=-1, distance 2.\n\nBut (1,3) and (3,1) are closer in terms of steps.\n\nBut (6,5) has shorter life, so I might need to go for it first if possible.\n\nBut life span 3, from turn 60, so I need to reach it by turn 62.\n\nCurrent turn 60, I can move now.\n\nIf I move directly towards it, but it might not be safe.\n\nAlso, need to consider the snake body.\n\nNow, let's visualize the grid.\n\nI'll sketch a grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but only playable area x=1-6, y=1-6.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSo cells:\n\ny=6: x=1 to 6, but walls at borders, so y=6 is not wall, only y=7 wall. Similarly x=6 not wall, x=7 wall.\n\nPlayable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is wall.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\n- (2,2) head\n- (3,2)\n- (4,2)\n- (4,3)\n- (3,3)\n- (3,4)\n- (2,4)\n- (1,4)\n- (1,5)\n- (2,5)\n- (3,5)\n- (4,5)\n- (5,5)\n- (5,6)\n- (6,6) tail\n\nFood: (6,5), (1,3), (3,1)\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is playable.\n\n(1,3) at x=1,y=3\n\n(3,1) at x=3,y=1\n\nNow, for turn 60, possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): what is (2,3)? Not occupied, not wall, free.\n\n- D to (2,1): (2,1) is free? Not occupied, not wall. y=1 is not wall, only y=0 is wall.\n\n- L to (1,2): (1,2) free.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tail situation. Tail is at (6,6), and there's food at (6,5), which is adjacent to tail? (6,5) and tail (6,6), so (6,5) is one cell below tail.\n\nNow, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, the food is at (6,5), not on the tail. Tail is at (6,6), so (6,5) is not the tail cell.\n\nThe danger is when the food is on the cell where the tail is, and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision.\n\nBut here, food is at (6,5), tail at (6,6), so not on tail, so no immediate danger from that.\n\nBut if head moves to (6,5) and eats, snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn, but since it's not on tail, it should be fine.\n\nGeneral rule: when snake eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place, meaning the new segment is added, so the snake becomes longer, and tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut collision: head moves to a cell with food, eats it, then the body moves except the tail doesn't advance, so the new head position is where food was, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position or something.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the head is on food, then the body moves, but since it ate, a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new tail is created? No.\n\nTypically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but since it ate, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; it grows by one.\n\nSo the cell that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added there.\n\nBut for movement: on a turn, you move the head to a new cell, if it has food, you eat, and the tail does not move (so snake grows), else tail moves forward (snake doesn't grow).\n\nCollision is checked after head moves, before body moves.\n\nBut in terms of positions, after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n\nFor the danger: if food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it, then after eating, the new tail is added, but the head is on the food cell, which was the old tail, and since tail didn't move, the new segment is added at old tail position, but head is now there, so they occupy the same cell? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose tail is at T. Food is at T, on the tail cell.\n\nHead is adjacent to T, say at H.\n\nHead moves to T to eat food.\n\nAfter moving head to T, which had food, so it eats.\n\nNow, since it ate, the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the current tail position, but current tail position is T, and head just moved to T, so now both head and the new segment are at T? That would be collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger: if head moves to a cell that is the current tail and has food, then after eating, head and the new tail segment are at the same cell, causing collision.\n\nBut in this case, for (6,5), tail is at (6,6), so (6,5) is not the tail cell, so no problem.\n\nFood at (6,5) can be eaten safely.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nI need to consider which food to target.\n\n(6,5) has short life, only 3 turns, so I need to get it soon.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (6,5): I need to move right and up.\n\nBut current position (2,2), to (6,5), need to go right 4, up 3.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nPath: for example, right to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there now.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), or D to (2,1), or L to (1,2).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then I am at (2,3), closer to (1,3) or (3,1)? (2,3) to (1,3) is left, adjacent, or to (3,1) is down-right, not direct.\n\n(2,3) to (1,3) is left, distance 1.\n\n(2,3) to (3,1) is down 2, right 1, etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is far.\n\nIf I move D to (2,1), then to (3,1) is down-right, but (3,1) is food, so from (2,1) I can go right to (3,1) if I move D first.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, for turn 60, I have three choices.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid getting trapped or colliding.\n\nLet me list the grid cells for reference.\n\nMake a grid:\n\ny\\x | 1    2    3    4    5    6\n----|----------------------------\n6   |      (5,6) (6,6)   but x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6\n\nBetter to list rows from y=6 down to y=1 for clarity.\n\ny=6: x=1: ? , x=2: ? , x=3: ? , x=4: ? , x=5: (5,6) snake body, x=6: (6,6) tail\n\ny=5: x=1: (1,5) snake, x=2: (2,5) snake, x=3: (3,5) snake, x=4: (4,5) snake, x=5: (5,5) snake, x=6: (6,5) food\n\n(6,5) is food, not snake.\n\nSnake at y=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nAnd (6,5) is food.\n\ny=4: x=1: (1,4) snake, x=2: (2,4) snake, x=3: (3,4) snake, x=4: ? , x=5: ? , x=6: ?\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, x=4.\n\nList all:\n\nFrom snake positions:\n\n- (2,2) head\n- (3,2) body\n- (4,2) body\n- (4,3) body\n- (3,3) body\n- (3,4) body\n- (2,4) body\n- (1,4) body\n- (1,5) body\n- (2,5) body\n- (3,5) body\n- (4,5) body\n- (5,5) body\n- (5,6) body\n- (6,6) tail\n\nSo:\n\ny=6: x=5: (5,6), x=6: (6,6)\n\ny=5: x=1: (1,5), x=2: (2,5), x=3: (3,5), x=4: (4,5), x=5: (5,5), x=6: food (6,5)\n\ny=4: x=1: (1,4), x=2: (2,4), x=3: (3,4), x=4: ? , x=5: ? , x=6: ?\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, x=4\n\ny=3: x=1: ? , x=2: ? , x=3: (3,3), x=4: (4,3), x=5: ? , x=6: ?\n\nBut (3,3) is at y=3,x=3\n\nSnake has (3,3) at y=3,x=3, and (4,3) at y=3,x=4\n\ny=2: x=2: (2,2) head, x=3: (3,2), x=4: (4,2), x=5: ? , but (5,2) is wall, x=6: ?\n\ny=1: x=1: ? , x=2: ? , x=3: ? , x=4: ? , x=5: ? , x=6: ?\n\nFood at (1,3) which is y=3,x=1, and (3,1) y=1,x=3.\n\nSo free cells:\n\ny=6: x=1,2,3,4 free? x=1: not listed, so free; x=2: not listed; x=3: not listed; x=4: not listed; x=5: snake; x=6: snake\n\ny=5: x=1 to 5 snake, x=6 food\n\ny=4: x=1 snake, x=2 snake, x=3 snake, x=4 free, x=5 free, x=6 free\n\ny=3: x=1 food (1,3)? Food at (1,3), but (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, which is a cell.\n\nCells: (1,3) has food, so it's occupied by food, but snake can move there to eat.\n\nBut for movement, if snake moves there, it can eat.\n\nBut for empty cells: at y=3, x=1 has food, x=2 free? Not occupied, so free; x=3 snake (3,3), x=4 snake (4,3), x=5 free? (5,3) not listed, and not wall, so free; x=6 free.\n\nBut (5,2) is wall at y=2,x=5, so (5,3) should be free.\n\ny=2: x=2 snake, x=3 snake, x=4 snake, x=5 wall (obstacle), x=6 free\n\nx=1 free? (1,2) not listed.\n\ny=1: all free except x=3 has food (3,1), but food, so cell is there.\n\n(3,1) food.\n\nSo overall, the snake body occupies many cells, but there are free spaces.\n\nNow, head at (2,2), can move to:\n- U: (2,3) - free\n- D: (2,1) - free\n- L: (1,2) - free\n- R: (3,2) - occupied, and not allowed\n\nSo U, D, L possible.\n\nNow, let's consider each option for turn 60.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,3)\n\nThen head at (2,3) on turn 61.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction would be U? After moving U, the new direction is U, so for next turn, cannot move D.\n\nFrom (2,3), can move U to (2,4), but (2,4) is snake body, occupied, so cannot.\n\nMove D to (2,2), but (2,2) is now the second segment? After moving, the body will shift.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nFor turn 60, if I move U to (2,3):\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Body: the old head (2,2) becomes segment 2, then (3,2) becomes segment 3, etc., up to tail (6,6) moves to previous position of segment before it.\n\nThe segments: current positions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), the new positions:\n- Head: (2,3)\n- Segment 2: old head (2,2)\n- Segment 3: old seg2 (3,2)\n- Segment 4: old seg3 (4,2)\n- Segment 5: old seg4 (4,3)\n- Segment 6: old seg5 (3,3)\n- Segment 7: old seg6 (3,4)\n- Segment 8: old seg7 (2,4)\n- Segment 9: old seg8 (1,4)\n- Segment 10: old seg9 (1,5)\n- Segment 11: old seg10 (2,5)\n- Segment 12: old seg11 (3,5)\n- Segment 13: old seg12 (4,5)\n- Segment 14: old seg13 (5,5)\n- Segment 15: old seg14 (5,6)  // tail moves to (5,6)\n\nOld tail was (6,6), which is not moved to, so it is vacated, but since we didn't eat, tail moves to (5,6), and (6,6) becomes free.\n\nNew tail is at (5,6), which was previously segment 14.\n\nAfter move, positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nTail at (5,6)\n\nFood at (6,5) still there, etc.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves for turn 61:\n- Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n- Move U to (2,4): but (2,4) is now occupied by segment 8 in the new list, which is body, so cannot, collision.\n- Move L to (1,3): (1,3) has food! So can move there to eat.\n- Move R to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by segment 6, body, so cannot.\n- Move D to (2,2): but (2,2) is occupied by segment 2, body, and also D is opposite to current U, so not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,3) is L to (1,3), which has food.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 60, then on turn 61, I must move L to (1,3) to eat the food there.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3) on turn 61, I eat the food at (1,3), value +1, so snake grows, tail does not move.\n\nNew head at (1,3), and a new segment is added at the old tail position, which was (5,6).\n\nSo new snake positions: head (1,3), then the previous segments except tail stays.\n\nAfter turn 60 move to (2,3), positions were: head (2,3), segs: (2,2), (3,2), ..., up to (5,5), (5,6)\n\nThen move to (1,3), eat food, so new head (1,3), and new segment added at old tail (5,6), so the body is: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and new tail at (5,6)? No.\n\nThe segments: after eating, the head is at new position, the body is the previous head position and the previous body positions, but since it ate, the tail doesn't advance, so the last segment remains, and a new segment is added at the end.\n\nStandard: after eating, the snake has one more segment; the head is at food cell, the neck is at previous head position, and the body follows, with the tail staying in place, so the new segment is at the old tail position.\n\nIn this case, before moving to (1,3), positions were: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] with tail at (5,6)\n\nMove head to (1,3), eat food, so new head (1,3), then the body: previous head (2,3) becomes segment 2, then (2,2), (3,2), ..., up to (5,5), and since ate, tail does not move, so segment 15 is still (5,6), and a new segment 16 is added at (5,6)? No, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so it becomes segment 16 at (5,6), but (5,6) is already occupied.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nTypically: when snake eats, the head moves to the new cell, the body moves as usual except the tail does not move; instead, the snake grows, so the new length is old length +1, with the tail remaining and a new segment added there, but since tail doesn't move, the position stays.\n\nFor example, before move, snake has positions S0, S1, S2, ..., S14 for 15 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, if no eat, new positions: new head, S0, S1, ..., S13, with S14 vacated.\n\nIf eat, new positions: new head, S0, S1, ..., S14, so S14 remains, and no vacate.\n\nSo in this case, before turn 61 move, positions: let's index.\n\nAfter turn 60 move U to (2,3), positions: P0: (2,3), P1: (2,2), P2: (3,2), P3: (4,2), P4: (4,3), P5: (3,3), P6: (3,4), P7: (2,4), P8: (1,4), P9: (1,5), P10: (2,5), P11: (3,5), P12: (4,5), P13: (5,5), P14: (5,6)  // P14 is tail\n\nNow for turn 61, move to (1,3), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then P0 becomes body at (2,3), then P1: (2,2), P2: (3,2), ..., up to P13: (5,5), and P14: (5,6) remains as tail, but since ate, the tail does not move, so P14 stays, and a new segment is added at P14, so now tail is at (5,6) with index 15.\n\nSo new snake: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] length 16.\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nAnd (1,3) food is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, head at (1,3), direction from (2,3) to (1,3), so left.\n\nFor next move, cannot move right.\n\nBut we are at turn 61, and I need to plan further.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; we are evaluating options for turn 60.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 60 I move D to (2,1).\n\nMove D to (2,1) on turn 60.\n\nThen new head (2,1), body: old head (2,2) becomes seg2, then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), and tail moves to (5,6)? After move, no eat, so tail moves.\n\nPositions before move: [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ]\n\nMove head to (2,1), no food there, so no eat, tail moves to (5,6), and (6,6) vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), seg2: (2,2), seg3: (3,2), seg4: (4,2), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (3,3), seg7: (3,4), seg8: (2,4), seg9: (1,4), seg10: (1,5), seg11: (2,5), seg12: (3,5), seg13: (4,5), seg14: (5,5), tail seg15: (5,6)  // old seg14 (5,6) moved to? Old seg14 was (5,6), but in list, seg13 was (5,5), seg14 (5,6), seg15 (6,6)\n\nAfter move: head to (2,1), then seg2: old head (2,2), seg3: old seg2 (3,2), ..., seg14: old seg13 (5,5), seg15: old seg14 (5,6)\n\nOld seg15 (6,6) is not in new list, so vacated.\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves for turn 61:\n- Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n- Move D to (2,0): but y=0 is wall, collision, die.\n- Move L to (1,1): free? (1,1) not occupied, not wall.\n- Move R to (3,1): (3,1) has food, so can eat.\n- Move U to (2,2): but (2,2) is occupied by seg2, body, and U opposite to D, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) to eat food.\n\nIf move R to (3,1), eat, then grow.\n\nIf move L to (1,1), no eat.\n\nBut (3,1) food has life 8, so not urgent.\n\nSimilarly, third option for turn 60: move L to (1,2)\n\nMove L to (1,2) on turn 60.\n\n(1,2) no food, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), seg2: (2,2), seg3: (3,2), seg4: (4,2), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (3,3), seg7: (3,4), seg8: (2,4), seg9: (1,4), seg10: (1,5), seg11: (2,5), seg12: (3,5), seg13: (4,5), seg14: (5,5), tail seg15: (5,6)  // old seg14 (5,6), old seg15 (6,6) vacated.\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nFrom (1,2), current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves:\n- U to (1,3): (1,3) has food, so eat.\n- D to (1,1): free, not occupied.\n- L to (0,2): x=0 wall, die.\n- R not allowed.\n\nSo can move U to (1,3) to eat, or D to (1,1).\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\nIf on turn 60 I move U, then on turn 61 I must move L to (1,3) to eat that food, and I get +1.\n\nIf I move D on turn 60, then on turn 61 I can move R to (3,1) to eat that food, or move L to (1,1).\n\nIf I move L on turn 60, then on turn 61 I can move U to (1,3) to eat, or move D to (1,1).\n\nBut I also have the food at (6,5) with short life, which I might miss if I go for the other foods.\n\n(6,5) life span 3, present on turn 60,61,62.\n\nIf I don't go for it soon, it will disappear.\n\nFrom current position (2,2), to reach (6,5) in 2 moves? Turn 60 and 61 to be on (6,5) by turn 62.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), head at (2,2), distance |6-2| + |5-2| = 4+3=7, so at least 7 moves, impossible to reach in 2 turns. Minimum Manhattan distance 7, so I need at least 7 moves, but it disappears after turn 62, so I must be on (6,5) on or before turn 62.\n\nTurn 62 is the last chance, so I need to move to (6,5) on turn 62.\n\nBut from (2,2), in two moves, I can only reach cells within Manhattan distance 2, like (2,4), (2,0) invalid, (0,2) invalid, (4,2) occupied, etc. From (2,2), in one move: (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2) invalid. In two moves, e.g. to (1,3), (1,1), (3,3) occupied, (3,1), (2,4) occupied, etc. None of these are (6,5), which is far away. So impossible to reach (6,5) by turn 62; the earliest I can reach it is in about 7 moves, by turn 67 or so, but it will be gone by turn 63. So I cannot eat (6,5); it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, from any of the immediate positions, it's too far.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) to (6,5): need to go right 4, up 3.\n\nAfter moving U to (2,3), then to (6,5) still right 4, up 2, distance 6.\n\nAfter moving D to (2,1), to (6,5) right 4, up 4, distance 8.\n\nAfter moving L to (1,2), to (6,5) right 5, up 3, distance 8.\n\nAll more than 2, and since only turns 61 and 62 left for it, I can't reach in time. So (6,5) is unreachable; I should ignore it.\n\nIt will disappear on turn 63, but last chance to eat is turn 62, and I can't be there on turn 62.\n\nSo forget about (6,5).\n\nNow, other foods: (1,3) and (3,1), both with longer life.\n\n(1,3) life 5, so available turns 60-64.\n\n(3,1) life 8, available longer.\n\nNow, (1,3) is closer to current position.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can reach (1,3) in one move if I go to (1,2) then to (1,3), but not directly.\n\nFrom (2,2), to (1,3) is not adjacent; (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, (2,2) is x=2,y=2, so not adjacent; adjacent cells are (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n\n(1,3) is one up and one left, so distance 2.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is one down and one right, distance 2.\n\nI can reach both in two moves.\n\nFor (1,3): if I move to (1,2) on turn 60, then to (1,3) on turn 61.\n\nOr move to (2,3) on turn 60, then to (1,3) on turn 61.\n\nFor (3,1): move to (2,1) on turn 60, then to (3,1) on turn 61.\n\nOr move to (3,2) but occupied.\n\nNow, in terms of risk, I need to see which one is safer or better for long-term.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, which might block paths.\n\nBut since all food is positive, growing is good for score, but might make survival harder if space is tight.\n\nNow, the grid has some free space.\n\nFor example, after eating one food, I need to find other food or avoid dead ends.\n\nBut let's think about the area.\n\nCurrently, the snake is mostly on the left and center, with tail at (5,6).\n\nFree areas: around (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc., but let's list free cells.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\ny=6: x=1,2,3,4 free? x=1,2,3,4 not occupied, so free; x=5 snake, x=6 snake\n\ny=5: x=1 to 5 snake, x=6 food\n\ny=4: x=1 snake, x=2 snake, x=3 snake, x=4 free, x=5 free, x=6 free\n\ny=3: x=1 food (1,3), x=2 free, x=3 snake (3,3), x=4 snake (4,3), x=5 free, x=6 free\n\ny=2: x=1 free? (1,2) free if not moved, but after moves; x=2 snake head, x=3 snake, x=4 snake, x=5 wall, x=6 free\n\ny=1: x=1 free, x=2 free, x=3 food (3,1), x=4 free, x=5 free, x=6 free\n\nAlso, (5,2) wall.\n\nSo there is free space on the right and bottom.\n\nNow, back to turn 60 options.\n\nOption A: Move U to (2,3) on turn 60.\n\nThen on turn 61, as before, only move is L to (1,3) to eat food. (Because other moves blocked or invalid)\n\nAfter that, head at (1,3), with direction L.\n\nThen for turn 62, from (1,3), possible moves:\n\nCannot move R (opposite to L).\n\nMove U to (1,4): but (1,4) is body? After eating, positions: as earlier, [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\n(1,4) is occupied by segment 10? Let's index: head (1,3), seg2: (2,3), seg3: (2,2), seg4: (3,2), seg5: (4,2), seg6: (4,3), seg7: (3,3), seg8: (3,4), seg9: (2,4), seg10: (1,4), seg11: (1,5), etc.\n\n(1,4) is seg10, body, so cannot move U to (1,4).\n\nMove D to (1,2): (1,2) is free? In current positions, (1,2) is not occupied; after the growth, positions are as above, (1,2) is not in the list, so free.\n\nMove L to (0,3): x=0 wall, die.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,2).\n\nThen move to (1,2) on turn 62.\n\nNo food there, so no eat.\n\nThen new positions: head to (1,2), body shifts, tail moves to (5,6)? Let's simulate.\n\nBefore turn 62 move, positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] head (1,3)\n\nMove to (1,2), no food, so no grow, tail moves.\n\nNew head (1,2), seg2: old head (1,3), seg3: old seg2 (2,3), seg4: old seg3 (2,2), ..., up to seg15: old seg14 (5,5), tail seg16: old seg15 (5,6)? Length is 16, segments 1 to 16.\n\nPositions: P0: (1,3), P1: (2,3), P2: (2,2), P3: (3,2), P4: (4,2), P5: (4,3), P6: (3,3), P7: (3,4), P8: (2,4), P9: (1,4), P10: (1,5), P11: (2,5), P12: (3,5), P13: (4,5), P14: (5,5), P15: (5,6)\n\nMove head to (1,2), no food, so new positions: head (1,2), P0 becomes seg2: (1,3), P1: (2,3), P2: (2,2), ..., P14: (5,5), and seg16: P15 (5,6)? Since no grow, tail moves, so P15 is not included; new seg15: old P14 (5,5), and old P15 (5,6) vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), seg2: (1,3), seg3: (2,3), seg4: (2,2), seg5: (3,2), seg6: (4,2), seg7: (4,3), seg8: (3,3), seg9: (3,4), seg10: (2,4), seg11: (1,4), seg12: (1,5), seg13: (2,5), seg14: (3,5), seg15: (4,5)  // old P13 (4,5) becomes seg15? Let's see:\n\nAfter move, head to (1,2), then seg2: P0 (1,3), seg3: P1 (2,3), seg4: P2 (2,2), seg5: P3 (3,2), seg6: P4 (4,2), seg7: P5 (4,3), seg8: P6 (3,3), seg9: P7 (3,4), seg10: P8 (2,4), seg11: P9 (1,4), seg12: P10 (1,5), seg13: P11 (2,5), seg14: P12 (3,5), seg15: P13 (4,5)\n\nOld P14 (5,5) and P15 (5,6) are gone; tail at (4,5)\n\nNow head at (1,2), direction from (1,3) to (1,2), so down.\n\nFor turn 63, from (1,2), current direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves:\n- D to (1,1): free\n- L to (0,2): wall, die\n- R to (2,2): (2,2) is now occupied by seg4, body, so cannot\n- U not allowed\n\nSo only move D to (1,1)\n\nThen at (1,1), and so on.

In turn 62 positions, after moving to (4,1), seg2: (3,1), seg3: (2,1), seg4: (2,2), seg5: (3,2), seg6: (4,2), so (4,2) is seg6, occupied, so cannot go up. D to (4,0) wall. L not allowed. So only right.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this sequence is determined.\n\nTherefore, for turn 60, move down.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating positive food and avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. The current state at turn 60 is analyzed, considering the grid layout, snake positions, food availability with life spans, and movement constraints. The snake head is at (2,2) with direction L (left), so reverse moves to R (right) are prohibited on turn 60. The key food items are:\n- (6,5) with value +1 and life span 3 (available until turn 62; disappears on turn 63).\n- (1,3) with value +1 and life span 5 (available until turn 64; disappears on turn 65).\n- (3,1) with value +1 and life span 8 (available until turn 67; disappears on turn 68).\n\nGiven the Manhattan distance from the head (2,2) to (6,5) is 7, it is impossible to reach (6,5) by turn 62, so this food is ignored. The focus is on eating (1,3) or (3,1), with (1,3) expiring sooner (turn 64). However, paths to (1,3) risk dead ends or collisions, while moving toward (3,1) first allows for safer progression and scoring.\n\nAfter simulating moves 5 turns ahead (turns 60-64):\n- Moving U (up) to (2,3) on turn 60 leads to being forced to eat (1,3) on turn 61, but results in a collision on turn 63 due to body blocks.\n- Moving L (left) to (1,2) on turn 60 allows eating (1,3) on turn 61 but also risks a collision by turn 63.\n- Moving D (down) to (2,1) on turn 60 enables eating (3,1) on turn 61, providing a +1 score, and allows safe movement to the right, avoiding immediate risks and accessing open areas for future food opportunities.\n\nThus, moving D on turn 60 is optimal. The sequence ensures survival and scores at least +1 by eating (3,1). The planned actions for turns 60-64 are:\n\n- Turn 60: Move D (down) to (2,1), avoiding reverse move and positioning to eat (3,1).\n- Turn 61: Move R (right) to (3,1), eating the food (+1 score, snake grows to length 16).\n- Turn 62: Move R (right) to (4,1), safe as (4,1) is free.\n- Turn 63: Move R (right) to (5,1), safe as (5,1) is free and not a wall.\n- Turn 64: Move R (right) to (6,1), safe as (6,1) is free and within bounds.\n\nThis path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions, with the snake surviving beyond turn 64. The food at (1,3) expires uneaten on turn 65, but the sequence maximizes safety and score potential by securing (3,1).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 61: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 62: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 63: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 64: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 61, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and one internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (2,1), and the body segments follow: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). The head direction is down (D), which means the snake was moving downward to reach (2,1) from (2,2) I assume, since (2,2) is the next segment.\n\nHead direction is D, and current head is at (2,1). Since it was moving down, previous head was at (2,2), which matches the second position.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,5) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 4 and value 1\n\n- (3,1) with life span 7 and value 1\n\n- (1,5) with life span 10 and value 1\n\nAll food is positive, value 1 each. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n\nNow, snake head is at (2,1), direction down. Possible moves: I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so I cannot instantly reverse to up. So, I cannot move up because that would be opposite to down. Reversing would be moving to the cell I came from, which is (2,2), but since direction is down, moving up would be towards (2,0), which is not where I came from. Let's clarify.\n\nThe snake head is at (2,1), and it was moving down to get there. So, previous position was (2,2), which is above it. Moving up would be to (2,0), which is not reversing; reversing would be moving back to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by the body, so I can't move there anyway.\n\nThe rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. Therefore, I cannot move up on this turn. So possible moves from (2,1) are: down (D) to (2,0), left (L) to (1,1), or right (R) to (3,1).\n\nBut (2,0) is a border wall since y=0 is a wall, so I cannot move there. x=0 and y=0 are walls.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) and (3,1) might be free or not, but let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,1)\n\n- Body: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2)\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), and (0,7) to (7,7). But since it's a grid, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal (5,2).\n\nNow, for move options from (2,1):\n\n- Up (U): to (2,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down (D): to (2,0) wait no, current is (2,1), down would be to (2,0) if we think y increasing up, but let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in such grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think. Let's see.\n\nU: (x,y+1) — so moving up increases y.\n\nD: (x,y-1) — down decreases y.\n\nSo at (2,1), moving:\n\n- U: (2,2) — but (2,2) is occupied by the snake body, so collision, cannot move there.\n\n- D: (2,0) — y=0 is wall, cannot move.\n\n- L: (1,1) — is this free? Let's see if it's occupied.\n\n(1,1) is not in snake positions: snake has (1,4), (1,5), etc., but not (1,1). Also, walls: x=0 or y=0, but (1,1) has x=1>0, y=1>0, not border. Internal obstacles: only (5,2), so (1,1) should be free.\n\n- R: (3,1) — (3,1) has food, but let's see if occupied. Snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), etc., not (3,1). So (3,1) is free except for food, but food doesn't block movement, only when head moves onto it, it's eaten.\n\nFood can be on cells, but snake can move onto food only if it's accessible.\n\nBut (3,1) is a cell with food, but not occupied by snake or wall, so I can move there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) should be free.\n\nBut I cannot move up or down because:\n\n- U to (2,2): occupied by snake body, collision.\n\n- D to (2,0): wall.\n\nSo only possible moves are L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nNow, (3,1) has food with value 1, life span 7.\n\n(1,1) has no food mentioned, so probably empty.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the head direction will affect next moves.\n\nCurrent direction is D, but after I move, the new direction will be set based on what I do.\n\nIf I move L, direction becomes L; if R, direction becomes R.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score and survive long-term.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) bottom-left? Since U increases y, probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nBut not specified, but doesn't matter for positions.\n\nList all snake segments in order: positions from head to tail.\n\nHead: (2,1)\n\nThen: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nTail is at (5,6).\n\nFood at:\n\n- (6,5) - life 2, so disappears after 2 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 61, life span 2, so after turn 61, it has 1 turn left, after turn 62, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 4, so 4 turns including turn 61.\n\n(3,1) life span 7, many turns.\n\n(1,5) life span 10.\n\nAlso, note that (1,5) is a food position, but look at snake: (1,5) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions include (1,5), which is the 10th segment? Let's count: positions index from 0: head (2,1) idx0, (2,2) idx1, (3,2) idx2, (4,2) idx3, (4,3) idx4, (3,3) idx5, (3,4) idx6, (2,4) idx7, (1,4) idx8, (1,5) idx9, (2,5) idx10, (3,5) idx11, (4,5) idx12, (5,5) idx13, (5,6) idx14 tail.\n\nSo (1,5) is occupied by the snake body at index 9.\n\nBut food at (1,5) is listed with life span 10 and value 1.\n\nThe rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo (1,5) has food under the body, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away from that cell.\n\nCurrently, segment at (1,5) is part of the body, so when the snake moves, this segment might move or not, depending on whether it eats food.\n\nIn general, when snake moves without eating, tail moves forward, so the cell is freed.\n\nBut here, since there's food under it, we need to see.\n\nFor (1,5), food is there, but occupied, so to eat it, the body must move away, meaning the snake moves and that cell is no longer occupied, then head can move to it later.\n\nBut for now, it's not accessible.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (6,5) - not occupied, (1,3) not occupied, (3,1) not occupied.\n\n(1,3) might be occupied? Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3), so free.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nNow back to current move: from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, so if I go there, I eat it, snake grows.\n\nIf I go to (1,1), no food, so snake moves, tail shortens? No, when no food eaten, snake moves head to new cell, tail leaves the last cell, so length same.\n\nBut since no food eaten, tail moves, so the last cell is freed.\n\nNow, let's think about risks and opportunities.\n\nFirst, if I go right to (3,1), I eat the food, so snake grows by one segment. New head at (3,1), and tail stays where it is, since eating, tail doesn't move? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So length increases by one.\n\nThen next turn, when moving, if no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nBut here, if I eat at (3,1), then new positions: head now at (3,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes body, so snake becomes: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)] and tail at (5,6), but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so (5,6) still there, and new segment added, so length 16 now? Original positions had 15 segments: from (2,1) to (5,6), 15 positions.\n\nCount: indices 0 to 14, so 15 segments.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (3,1), new segment, so positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] — that's 16 segments, tail at (5,6).\n\nThen next move, if no food, tail moves away from (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is near border, x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, direction after move: if I move R to (3,1), since I was at (2,1) and moved right, new head direction is R.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), new head direction is L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (6,5) with life span 2, meaning after turn 61, it has 1 turn left, so it disappears after turn 62 if not eaten. So I need to eat it by turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, other foods have more time.\n\nBut (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is near the snake tail.\n\nSnake tail is at (5,6), so (6,5) is adjacent, right-down? (5,6) to (6,5) is diagonal, not adjacent for movement. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (5,6), adjacent: (5,5), (5,7) but y=7 wall, (4,6), (6,6) x=6 not wall, but y=6<7, so (6,6) possible, but not occupied? Snake has (5,5) which is body, and (5,6) tail.\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is adjacent to (5,5), (6,4), (6,6), (7,5) but x=7 wall.\n\n(5,5) is occupied by snake body (index 13), so (6,5) is free and has food.\n\nTo eat (6,5), I need to get head there.\n\nBut head is at (2,1), far away.\n\nWith life span 2, meaning at turn 61, it exists, after turn 61 (so after this move), it will have life span 1, so it exists on turn 62, and disappears after turn 62, so must be eaten on turn 62 or before. Since turn 61 is current, I can eat it on turn 61 or 62.\n\nBut on turn 61, I'm at (2,1), (6,5) is at distance |6-2| + |5-1| = 4+4=8 Manhattan, so impossible to reach in one move, so I can only eat it on turn 62 if I move towards it.\n\nBut turn 62 is next turn, so from current position, I need to be able to reach it in two moves? Turn 61 and turn 62 are two actions.\n\nOn turn 61, I move to a cell, then on turn 62, I move to (6,5) if possible.\n\nBut from (2,1) to (6,5) in two moves: min moves is |dx| + |dy| = 4 + 4 = 8, impossible in two moves. So I cannot eat (6,5) on turn 61 or 62; it will disappear after turn 62, so I cannot eat it at all. Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 61, life span 2, so:\n\n- After turn 61 (i.e., after this move), it decreases to 1.\n\n- After turn 62, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 61 or turn 62.\n\nOn turn 61: head at (2,1), (6,5) is at (6,5), distance 4+4=8 >1, cannot reach in one move.\n\nOn turn 62: head will be at some position after turn 61 move.\n\nFrom (2,1), after one move, head could be at (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,1) to (6,5): dx=5, dy=4, min 9 moves, still far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,5): dx=3, dy=4, min 7 moves.\n\nNeither can reach (6,5) in one move on turn 62. So (6,5) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 62. So I should ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, other foods: (1,3) life span 4, so after turn 61, 3 left; after turn 62, 2; turn 63,1; turn 64,0 gone. So must eat by turn 64.\n\n(3,1) life span 7, many turns.\n\n(1,5) life span 10, under snake body, so need to free it first.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (3,1) - eat food, grow to 16 segments.\n\nNew head at (3,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen possible next moves from (3,1): current direction R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: up to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by snake body (index 2 or 3? Positions: after eating, snake is [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), ... ] so (3,2) is the fourth segment, occupied.\n\nDown to (3,0) - y=0 wall.\n\nLeft to (2,1) - but (2,1) is now body, occupied.\n\nRight to (4,1) - is this free? Let's see, x=4,y=1.\n\nNot in snake positions: snake has (4,2), (4,3), etc., not (4,1). Walls: no, internal obstacle (5,2), not (4,1). So (4,1) should be free, no food.\n\nSo from (3,1), with direction R, possible moves: only right to (4,1), since up, down, left all invalid.\n\nUp to (3,2) occupied, down to (3,0) wall, left to (2,1) occupied and opposite? Direction: current direction is R, moving left would be opposite, but (2,1) is also occupied, so invalid anyway.\n\nOnly right to (4,1) is possible.\n\nThen at (4,1), new direction R.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves: direction R, cannot move left.\n\nUp to (4,2) - (4,2) is occupied by snake body (index 3? After positions: [ (4,1)? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 61: head to (3,1), positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ... ]\n\nOn turn 62, if I move to (4,1), but (4,1) is not adjacent to (3,1)? (3,1) to (4,1) is right, yes.\n\nHead at (3,1), move R to (4,1).\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ... and so on, tail at (5,6).\n\n(4,2) is occupied, so from (4,1), moving up to (4,2) is occupied.\n\nDown to (4,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (3,1) occupied and opposite direction.\n\nRight to (5,1) - is it free? (5,1), not snake, not wall (x=5<7, y=1>0), internal obstacle (5,2), but (5,1) is different, so free.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (5,1).\n\nThen at (5,1), direction R.\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: direction R, cannot move left.\n\nUp to (5,2) - but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nDown to (5,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (4,1) occupied.\n\nRight to (6,1) - x=6, y=1, not border (x=6<7? x=7 wall, so x=6 ok, y=1 ok), no snake there, so free.\n\nSo move to (6,1).\n\nAnd so on. But I'm heading right, towards x=7, which is wall, and no food, so I might hit wall or need to turn.\n\nBut in this path, from (2,1) going right to (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then from (6,1), I can go up or down, but y=1, down to (6,0) wall, up to (6,2), which might be free.\n\nBut snake body is at (5,5), (4,5), etc., so not near.\n\nBut this path doesn't get food and I'm moving away from other foods.\n\nMoreover, at (6,1), I might be trapped or something.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nOption 2: move left to (1,1) from (2,1).\n\nNo food eaten, so snake moves: head to (1,1), then body follows, tail at (5,6) moves? When no eat, tail moves.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,1), body to (5,6).\n\nAfter move to (1,1), no eat, so new head (1,1), then the segments: the second position was (2,2), but since head moved, the body shifts: new positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] because tail (5,6) was the last, but since no eat, tail moves off, so (5,6) is freed, and (5,5) becomes the new tail? Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (2,1), 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (4,5), 13: (5,5), 14: (5,6)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,1) without eating, new head (1,1), then the body: the segment that was at index 0 moves to where head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new head at (1,1), then the first body segment is at previous head position (2,1), then next at previous (2,2), then (3,2), and so on, up to the second last segment (5,5) moves to previous (5,6)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (1,1)\n\n- Body segment 1: previous head position (2,1)\n\n- Body segment 2: previous segment 1 position (2,2)\n\n- Body segment 3: previous segment 2 position (3,2)\n\n- Body segment 4: previous segment 3 position (4,2)\n\n- Body segment 5: previous segment 4 position (4,3)\n\n- Body segment 6: previous segment 5 position (3,3)\n\n- Body segment 7: previous segment 6 position (3,4)\n\n- Body segment 8: previous segment 7 position (2,4)\n\n- Body segment 9: previous segment 8 position (1,4)\n\n- Body segment 10: previous segment 9 position (1,5)\n\n- Body segment 11: previous segment 10 position (2,5)\n\n- Body segment 12: previous segment 11 position (3,5)\n\n- Body segment 13: previous segment 12 position (4,5)\n\n- Body segment 14: previous segment 13 position (5,5)  // since segment 13 was (5,5), it moves to where? The tail was segment 14 at (5,6), but since no eat, the tail segment is removed, so the new snake has one less segment? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so the snake shortens temporarily? No.\n\nStandard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment towards head, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo positions: new head at new position, then the first body segment is at the old head position, second body at old first body position, and so on, up to the new tail at the position of the old second last segment.\n\nLet's index: old positions: 0:head (2,1), 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), ..., 13: (5,5), 14:tail (5,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,1) no eat:\n\n- New head: (1,1)\n\n- New body 1: old head (2,1)\n\n- New body 2: old body 1 (2,2)\n\n- New body 3: old body 2 (3,2)\n\n- New body 4: old body 3 (4,2)\n\n- New body 5: old body 4 (4,3)\n\n- New body 6: old body 5 (3,3)\n\n- New body 7: old body 6 (3,4)\n\n- New body 8: old body 7 (2,4)\n\n- New body 9: old body 8 (1,4)\n\n- New body 10: old body 9 (1,5)\n\n- New body 11: old body 10 (2,5)\n\n- New body 12: old body 11 (3,5)\n\n- New body 13: old body 12 (4,5)\n\n- New body 14: old body 13 (5,5)  // because old body 13 was (5,5), which is now the new tail\n\nThe tail was old body 14 at (5,6), which is not part of the snake anymore, so new snake has segments from (1,1) to (5,5), 15 segments? Old had 15 segments, after no eat, should have 14 segments? Let's count old: 0 to 14, 15 segments.\n\nAfter move, head new, and body from old 0 to old 13, but old 0 is now body 1, so positions: new head, then old 0, old 1, ..., old 13.\n\nOld 0 to old 13 is 14 positions, plus new head, 15 positions? No:\n\nNew head: 1 position\n\nThen the body segments: the first body segment is at old head position (old index 0), which is now occupied by the first body segment.\n\nThen the second body segment is at old index 1 position, and so on, up to the last body segment at old index 13 position.\n\nSince there is no new segment, the tail is not added, so the last segment is at old index 13 position, and old index 14 position is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: new head (1,1), then:\n\n- Segment 1: (2,1)  // old head\n\n- Segment 2: (2,2)  // old body 1\n\n- Segment 3: (3,2)  // old body 2\n\n- Segment 4: (4,2)  // old body 3\n\n- Segment 5: (4,3)  // old body 4\n\n- Segment 6: (3,3)  // old body 5\n\n- Segment 7: (3,4)  // old body 6\n\n- Segment 8: (2,4)  // old body 7\n\n- Segment 9: (1,4)  // old body 8\n\n- Segment 10: (1,5)  // old body 9\n\n- Segment 11: (2,5)  // old body 10\n\n- Segment 12: (3,5)  // old body 11\n\n- Segment 13: (4,5)  // old body 12\n\n- Segment 14: (5,5)  // old body 13, new tail\n\nOld body 13 was (5,5), and old body 14 (5,6) is gone.\n\nSo new snake: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] with tail at (5,5).\n\nLength 15, same as before? No, old was 15 segments, after no eat, length should be the same, but positions shifted; tail moved from (5,6) to (5,5), so length same, 15 segments.\n\nOld: 15 segments, new: 15 segments, but the tail cell changed.\n\nIn terms of number, it's the same, but the snake has moved, so the last cell is freed.\n\nBack to the choice.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), no food eaten, new head at (1,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves: direction L, cannot move right (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp to (1,2) - is it free? (1,2) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nDown to (1,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (0,1) - x=0 wall.\n\nRight to (2,1) - but (2,1) is now body (segment 1), occupied, and also opposite direction, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (1,2).\n\nThen at (1,2), new direction U.\n\nThen from (1,2), can move up, down, left, right, but with direction U, cannot move down.\n\nUp to (1,3) - (1,3) has food, and is free? Snake positions: new snake has (1,1) head, (2,1), (2,2), etc., not (1,3), so free, yes.\n\nDown to (1,1) occupied.\n\nLeft to (0,2) wall.\n\nRight to (2,2) - (2,2) is snake body (segment 2), occupied.\n\nSo only up to (1,3) is possible, and I can eat the food there.\n\nFood at (1,3) with value 1.\n\nSo from (1,2), move U to (1,3), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut this is after two moves.\n\nI need to think about the food at (1,5) under body.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) is occupied by body segment 10 in the new snake after moving to (1,1).\n\nIn the state after turn 61 move.\n\nFirst, for turn 61, I have to choose.\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), I eat food, grow, but then I'm forced to move right multiple times towards the wall, with no food, and I might get stuck.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), no eat, then I can go up to (1,2), then to (1,3) eat food, then from there I can go to other places.\n\nBut there's also the food at (1,5) under the body.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), the snake is at [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\n(1,5) is occupied by segment, and food is there, so it can be eaten when the body moves away.\n\nIf I go to (1,3) and eat, then head at (1,3), new segment, so positions: head (1,3), then (1,2)? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 61: if I moved L to (1,1), no eat, positions as above.\n\nThen turn 62: move U to (1,2), no eat yet, so head to (1,2), body shifts: new head (1,2), body 1 at (1,1), body 2 at (2,1), body 3 at (2,2), body 4 at (3,2), body 5 at (4,2), body 6 at (4,3), body 7 at (3,3), body 8 at (3,4), body 9 at (2,4), body 10 at (1,4), body 11 at (1,5), body 12 at (2,5), body 13 at (3,5), body 14 at (4,5), tail at (5,5)? After moving to (1,2) no eat, tail at (5,5) moves off, new tail at (4,5)? Let's not complicate.\n\nSince on turn 62 I move to (1,2), no food, so snake shortens? No, length same.\n\nPositions: head (1,2), then body: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) is tail, but since no eat, the last segment is removed, so body up to (4,5), with (5,5) vacated.\n\nOld positions after turn 61: segments: 0:(1,1), 1:(2,1), 2:(2,2), 3:(3,2), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,3), 6:(3,3), 7:(3,4), 8:(2,4), 9:(1,4), 10:(1,5), 11:(2,5), 12:(3,5), 13:(4,5), 14:(5,5)  // (5,5) is tail\n\nAfter move to (1,2) no eat:\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nNew body 1: old head (1,1)\n\nNew body 2: old body 1 (2,1)\n\nNew body 3: old body 2 (2,2)\n\nNew body 4: old body 3 (3,2)\n\nNew body 5: old body 4 (4,2)\n\nNew body 6: old body 5 (4,3)\n\nNew body 7: old body 6 (3,3)\n\nNew body 8: old body 7 (3,4)\n\nNew body 9: old body 8 (2,4)\n\nNew body 10: old body 9 (1,4)\n\nNew body 11: old body 10 (1,5)\n\nNew body 12: old body 11 (2,5)\n\nNew body 13: old body 12 (3,5)\n\nNew body 14: old body 13 (4,5)  // new tail, old body 14 (5,5) vacated\n\nSo now snake: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\n(1,5) is still occupied by body segment 11.\n\nBut food at (1,5) is there, under body.\n\nThen on turn 62, I move to (1,2), but (1,3) is above, so on turn 63, I can move up to (1,3) from (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), direction U (since moved up), so can move up to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) has food, so move to (1,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew head at (1,3), new segment added, so positions: head (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and new tail? Since ate, tail doesn't move, so (4,5) still there, new segment, so length 16.\n\nPositions: [ (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) ] with tail at (4,5).\n\n(1,5) is still occupied, but it's body segment 12 now? Index: 0:(1,3), 1:(1,2), 2:(1,1), 3:(2,1), 4:(2,2), 5:(3,2), 6:(4,2), 7:(4,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(3,4), 10:(2,4), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(2,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(4,5) tail.\n\n(1,5) is at index 12, body segment.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is under this segment, so to eat it, this segment must move away.\n\nAs the snake moves, when it doesn't eat, the tail moves, so eventually (1,5) will be freed when the snake moves and that segment moves.\n\nFor example, if I move without eating, the body at (1,5) will move to the next position, freeing (1,5).\n\nThen head can move to it later.\n\nBut there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nBut here, the food is not on tail cell yet.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,5), not at (1,5).\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut when the food is on the tail cell, and head is adjacent, eating it would cause collision.\n\nHere, (1,5) is not tail.\n\nNow, back to turn 61 choice.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), I can then go to (1,2) and (1,3) to eat food at (1,3), and I'm in a position to potentially eat the food at (1,5) later when it's freed.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1) which I didn't eat, but it has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nIf I move right to (3,1), I eat that food, but then I'm forced to move right multiple times, and I might not have access to the left side easily.\n\nMoreover, the food at (1,3) might be eaten by me if I go left, but if I go right, it might expire or be hard to reach.\n\n(1,3) life span 4, after turn 61, 3 left, so after turn 62, 2 left, turn 63,1, turn 64,0 gone. So must eat by turn 64.\n\nIf I go right to (3,1), on turn 61 I eat, then turn 62 move to (4,1), turn 63 to (5,1), turn 64 to (6,1), etc.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can move up, but to reach (1,3) from (6,1) in one move? Impossible, so I cannot eat (1,3) if I go right; it will expire.\n\nWhereas if I go left, I can eat (1,3) on turn 63 as above.\n\nSimilarly, for the food at (1,5) under body, it has life span 10, so many turns, can be eaten later.\n\nAlso, (3,1) is not eaten if I go left, but it has life span 7, so I can come back for it.\n\nBut if I go left, I don't eat (3,1), it stays.\n\nBut let's see the grid: after moving left, I'm at (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3) eat, then from (1,3), I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), direction U (since moved up), so can move up, down, left, right, but cannot move down (opposite).\n\nUp to (1,4) - (1,4) is occupied by body segment 11 in the current state after eating at (1,3).\n\nAfter eating at (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\n(1,4) is body segment 11, occupied.\n\nDown to (1,2) occupied.\n\nLeft to (0,3) wall.\n\nRight to (2,3) - is it free? (2,3) not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSo from (1,3), I can move right to (2,3).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nNow, the food at (1,5) is at (1,5), which is body segment 12.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no eat, that segment will move, freeing (1,5).\n\nFor example, if from (1,3) I move right to (2,3) no eat, then head to (2,3), body shifts, so the segment that was at (1,4) moves to (1,3)? Let's not detail.\n\nEventually, (1,5) will be freed when the body moves away.\n\nThen I can eat it later.\n\nBut there might be a risk if the tail is there.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is long, and the grid has walls, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, if I go right to (3,1), eat, then to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then from (6,1), I can go up to (6,2), then (6,3), etc., but there might be space.\n\nBut the internal wall at (5,2) blocks some area.\n\nLet's sketch the grid roughly.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head (2,1), then body: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nFree cells: for example, bottom-left: (0,1) to (0,6) walls, (1,0) to (1,6) except occupied, (1,1) free, (1,2) free, (1,3) free with food, etc.\n\nBut I think moving left is better because I can eat the food at (1,3) soon and have access to the food at (1,5) later.\n\nAlso, by not eating (3,1), I leave it for later, but it might be risky if I can't reach it.\n\nBut life span 7, so after turn 61, 6 left, so until turn 67.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nMoreover, if I go left, I avoid the dead-end on the right.\n\nOn the right, from (5,1), I have wall at (5,2), so I can only go to (6,1), then to (6,2), but (6,2) might be free, then to (6,3), etc., but the snake is long, and I might not have food, so I need to find a path to loop back.\n\nBut with the internal wall, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), I can go up to (6,2), then left to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so cannot, or up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), which is free, but snake body is at (5,5), etc.\n\nIt might be possible, but it's riskier because I'm going to the edge with no food immediately.\n\nWhereas on the left, I have food to eat soon.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,5) under body: currently occupied, but as the snake moves, it will be freed.\n\nFor instance, after I eat at (1,3), the snake is longer, and (1,5) is still occupied, but when I move without eating, the body moves, and eventually the segment at (1,5) will move to (1,4) or something, freeing (1,5).\n\nThen I can eat it.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move head to (1,5) when it's free.\n\nBut when it's free, if head is adjacent, I can eat it, but need to be careful of tail reward danger if tail is there.\n\nCurrently tail is at (4,5) or something.\n\nBut it might be fine.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nAnother point: if I move left to (1,1), I can survive and eat (1,3) soon.\n\nIf I move right to (3,1), I eat one food, but then I might not eat another soon, and I could be in danger.\n\nMoreover, in the right path, when I go to (6,1), then (6,2), then I can go to (6,3), (6,4), etc., but (6,5) has food but it disappears soon, so not available.\n\nThen I can go to (5,5) but it's snake body.\n\nEventually, I need to turn up or down.\n\nBut let's see the space.\n\nThe area around (6,y) for y=3 to 6 might be free, but snake has (5,5), (5,6), so (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) could be free except walls.\n\n(6,5) has food but expiring.\n\n(6,6) is free, etc.\n\nBut I think it's safer to go left.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1) that I can eat later if I go left, by coming down.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), after eating, I can go right to (2,3), then down to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, or to (3,3), but occupied, etc.\n\nIt might be messy.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate a few turns.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 61 and beyond, but the instruction is to output actions starting from turn 61, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I think I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nLet's see the answer format: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" and so on.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, so probably I need to provide the action for the current turn and perhaps a few more, but since it's a sequence, and the state changes, I should provide only for turn 61, or for multiple?\n\nThe user says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but in the answer, it might be just for the current turn, but the format shows multiple turns.\n\nLet's read: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nSo it implies I need to provide a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nBut since the state changes with each action, I need to plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I should decide the first move and then subsequent based on that.\n\nBut to think ahead, I need to evaluate the choices.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan a route.\n\nAnother idea: the snake is currently in a position where the head is at (2,1), and I can go to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (3,1), I eat, grow, but then I'm at (3,1) with direction R, and only can go to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1), I can go up to (6,2) (since down wall, left occupied, right wall if x=7, but x=6, right to (7,1) wall, so only up.\n\nTo (6,2), then from (6,2), direction U, can go up to (6,3), or down to (6,1) occupied, left to (5,2) wall, right to (7,2) wall, so only up to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly to (6,4), then to (6,5), but (6,5) has food but life span 2, by turn 62 it might be gone.\n\nTurn 61: if I go to (3,1), turn 62 to (4,1), turn 63 to (5,1), turn 64 to (6,1), turn 65 to (6,2), turn 66 to (6,3), turn 67 to (6,4), turn 68 to (6,5), but (6,5) food disappeared after turn 62, so not there.\n\nAnd no food eaten for many turns, so snake is moving but not growing, but since no eat, length same, no problem, but no score increase.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can go to (6,5) if free, or to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) might be free; snake has (5,5), so (5,4) free.\n\nBut I can go to (5,4), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut it might be possible to survive, but I missed the food at (1,3) which expires soon.\n\nIf I go left to (1,1) on turn 61, then turn 62 to (1,2), turn 63 to (1,3) eat food, so I eat on turn 63.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can go right to (2,3) on turn 64, for example.\n\n(2,3) should be free.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go down to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, or up to (2,4) but (2,4) body, or left to (1,3) occupied, or right to (3,3) occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (1,3) on turn 63, positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nFrom (1,3), move to (2,3) on turn 64: (2,3) is free, so move right, no eat, so head to (2,3), body shifts: new head (2,3), body 1 (1,3), body 2 (1,2), body 3 (1,1), body 4 (2,1), body 5 (2,2), body 6 (3,2), body 7 (4,2), body 8 (4,3), body 9 (3,3), body 10 (3,4), body 11 (2,4), body 12 (1,4), body 13 (1,5), body 14 (2,5), body 15 (3,5), tail at (4,5)? Since no eat, tail moves off.\n\nOld positions after turn 63: 0:(1,3), 1:(1,2), 2:(1,1), 3:(2,1), 4:(2,2), 5:(3,2), 6:(4,2), 7:(4,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(3,4), 10:(2,4), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(2,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(4,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,3) no eat:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nNew body 1: old head (1,3)\n\nNew body 2: old body 1 (1,2)\n\nNew body 3: old body 2 (1,1)\n\nNew body 4: old body 3 (2,1)\n\nNew body 5: old body 4 (2,2)\n\nNew body 6: old body 5 (3,2)\n\nNew body 7: old body 6 (4,2)\n\nNew body 8: old body 7 (4,3)\n\nNew body 9: old body 8 (3,3)\n\nNew body 10: old body 9 (3,4)\n\nNew body 11: old body 10 (2,4)\n\nNew body 12: old body 11 (1,4)\n\nNew body 13: old body 12 (1,5)\n\nNew body 14: old body 13 (2,5)\n\nNew body 15: old body 14 (3,5)  // new tail, old tail (4,5) vacated\n\nSo (1,5) is now at body segment 13, still occupied.\n\nBut when the snake moves, it will be freed eventually.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving, on turn 65, from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) but occupied, or up to (2,4) occupied, or left to (1,3) occupied, or right to (3,3) occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied except possibly (3,3) is body, occupied.\n\nFrom (2,3), adjacent: (2,2) body, (2,4) body, (1,3) body, (3,3) body, all occupied? (3,3) is body segment 9 in new positions, yes occupied.\n\nSo from (2,3), I cannot move anywhere; all directions blocked. That's a problem!\n\nAfter moving to (2,3) on turn 64, the head is at (2,3), and all adjacent cells are occupied by body, so on turn 65, I have no valid move; I would collide if I move anywhere.\n\nThis is a dead end.\n\nIf I go to (1,1) on turn 61, then to (1,2) on turn 62, then to (1,3) on turn 63 eat, then to (2,3) on turn 64, but then stuck on turn 65.\n\nSo this path leads to death.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (1,1) is dangerous because after eating at (1,3), I go to (2,3) and get stuck.\n\nI need to go somewhere else from (1,3).\n\nFrom (1,3), after eating, I have to move to an adjacent free cell.\n\nAt (1,3), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (1,4) - occupied by body\n\n- Down: (1,2) - occupied by body\n\n- Left: (0,3) - wall\n\n- Right: (2,3) - free, as we said\n\nOnly (2,3) is free, so I have to move there on turn 64, no choice.\n\nThen at (2,3), as above, all adjacent cells are occupied, so I die on turn 65.\n\nTherefore, if I choose to go left on turn 61, I will die on turn 65.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nAfter eating at (1,3) on turn 63, positions: head (1,3), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nAdjacent to head (1,3): (1,4) up: body segment 11, occupied; (1,2) down: body segment 1, occupied; (0,3) left: wall; (2,3) right: free.\n\nSo only move to (2,3).\n\nThen after moving to (2,3), new positions: head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) and tail at (4,5) but since no eat, tail moved, new tail at (3,5).\n\nIn new positions, adjacent to (2,3): up (2,4) - which is body segment 11, occupied; down (2,2) - body segment 5, occupied; left (1,3) - body segment 1, occupied; right (3,3) - body segment 9, occupied. All occupied, no move possible, collision inevitable.\n\nSo yes, death on turn 65 if I go left.\n\nTherefore, I must not go left to (1,1) on turn 61.\n\nThe only other choice is to go right to (3,1) on turn 61.\n\nThen I eat the food, grow, new head at (3,1), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 62, only move possible is right to (4,1), no eat, so head to (4,1), body shifts, tail moves off (5,6), new positions: head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and tail at (5,5)? After eating on turn 61, positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\nOn turn 62, move to (4,1) no eat: head to (4,1), body 1 at (3,1), body 2 at (2,1), body 3 at (2,2), body 4 at (3,2), body 5 at (4,2), body 6 at (4,3), body 7 at (3,3), body 8 at (3,4), body 9 at (2,4), body 10 at (1,4), body 11 at (1,5), body 12 at (2,5), body 13 at (3,5), body 14 at (4,5), body 15 at (5,5), tail at (5,6) but no eat, so tail moves off, new tail at (5,5), positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] with tail at (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is tail.\n\nNow head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nOn turn 63, from (4,1), possible moves: direction R, cannot move left.\n\nUp to (4,2) - occupied by body segment 5, occupied.\n\nDown to (4,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (3,1) occupied and opposite.\n\nRight to (5,1) - free, as before.\n\nSo move to (5,1), no eat.\n\nHead to (5,1), new direction R.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail at (5,5)? After move, new head (5,1), body 1 (4,1), body 2 (3,1), body 3 (2,1), body 4 (2,2), body 5 (3,2), body 6 (4,2), body 7 (4,3), body 8 (3,3), body 9 (3,4), body 10 (2,4), body 11 (1,4), body 12 (1,5), body 13 (2,5), body 14 (3,5), body 15 (4,5), tail at (5,5) but no eat, so tail moves off, new tail at (4,5), positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) ] tail at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is tail.\n\nNow head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nOn turn 64, from (5,1), moves: direction R, cannot move left.\n\nUp to (5,2) - but (5,2) is internal wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (5,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (4,1) occupied.\n\nRight to (6,1) - free.\n\nSo move to (6,1), no eat.\n\nHead to (6,1), direction R.\n\nPositions: similar shift, tail moves to (3,5) or something, but not important.\n\nThen from (6,1), on turn 65, direction R, but right to (7,1) wall, so cannot.\n\nCannot move right.\n\nCan move up, down, left, but direction R, cannot move left?

Assume free.\n\nDown to (6,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (5,1) occupied.\n\nRight to (7,1) wall.\n\nSo only up to (6,2), if free.\n\n(6,2) should be free, no snake, no wall.\n\nSo move up to (6,2), new direction U.\n\nThen from (6,2), on turn 66, direction U, cannot move down.\n\nUp to (6,3) - free.\n\nDown to (6,1) occupied.\n\nLeft to (5,2) wall.\n\nRight to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only up to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly to (6,4), (6,5), but (6,5) food gone.\n\nThen to (6,6), but y=6, up to (6,7) wall or something.\n\nBut I can turn left when possible.\n\nFor example, at (6,4), I can move left to (5,4) if free.\n\n(5,4) not occupied, so free.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to other areas.\n\nBut the food at (1,3) is expired by turn 64, so gone.\n\nBut I have the food at (3,1) still, but I ate it on turn 61.\n\n(3,1) was eaten on turn 61.\n\nOther food: (1,5) under body, life span 10, so I can try to eat it later.\n\nFor example, the body at (1,5) will move when the snake moves.\n\nIn the current path, after several moves, the segment at (1,5) will move to (1,4) or other, freeing (1,5), then I can go back to eat it.\n\nBut it might be far.\n\nSince I need to survive, going right seems possible, and I can avoid the trap.\n\nSo for turn 61, I should move right to (3,1).\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince the state changes, I can provide the action for turn 61, and perhaps the next few if obvious.\n\nBut in the right path, from (6,1) I go up to (6,2), etc., but I can choose to go to other directions if possible, but in the sequence above, only one choice each time until (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,1), I had to go up.\n\nThen from (6,2), go up to (6,3), and so on.\n\nAt (6,4), I can go left to (5,4) or up to (6,5).\n\nBut to maximize score, I should head towards areas with food.\n\nFor example, (1,5) food under body, but it might be freed soon.\n\nIn the snake positions after turn 64, for example, (1,5) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it will be freed.\n\nFor instance, when I move without eating, the body moves, so the cell (1,5) will be vacated when that segment moves.\n\nThen I can eat it.\n\nBut to do that, I need to have the head near.\n\nCurrently head is at (6,1) on turn 64, far from (1,5).\n\nSo it might take many turns.\n\nPerhaps I can turn earlier.\n\nFrom (4,1), after turn 62, I am at (4,1), but only choice is to (5,1), no other.\n\nSimilarly to (6,1).\n\nSo I think for now, moving right is the only safe choice, as moving left leads to death.\n\nSo on turn 61, I should move R to (3,1).\n\nThen for turn 62, move R to (4,1).\n\nTurn 63, move R to (5,1).\n\nTurn 64, move R to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 65, from (6,1) move U to (6,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, since it's a sequence, I can provide these.\n\nBut I need to think about the food at (1,5).\n\nSince life span 10, after turn 61, 9 left, so after turn 62,8, ..., after turn 70,0, so must eat by turn 70.\n\nI have time.\n\nSimilarly, I can plan to go to the left after reaching the top.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), move left to (5,4), then to (4,4), etc., towards (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) might be freed by then.\n\nSo it should be possible.\n\nTherefore, for turn 61, action is R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can define.\n\nBut the answer format might expect only the current turn, but it shows multiple, so I'll provide a few.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I should output the sequence I plan.\n\nBut let's box the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 61 Decision\nTo maximize long-term survival and score, I must think 5+ turns ahead, considering food availability, snake movement constraints, and collision risks. The current state (turn 61) has the snake head at (2,1) with direction down (D). Possible moves are left (L) to (1,1) or right (R) to (3,1), as up (U) leads to a body collision at (2,2) and down (D) leads to a wall at (2,0).\n\n- **Moving left to (1,1)**: This avoids immediate food at (3,1) but allows access to (1,3) food (life span 4, must eat by turn 64). However, simulation shows that after eating at (1,3) on turn 63, the snake is forced to (2,3) on turn 64, where all adjacent cells are occupied by the body on turn 65, leading to certain death. This path is fatal and must be avoided.\n  \n- **Moving right to (3,1)**: This eats the +1 food at (3,1), growing the snake. The path then forces movement rightward due to constraints, but it avoids immediate death and keeps the snake alive. Although the food at (1,3) expires (life span 4, gone after turn 64), the food at (1,5) under the body (life span 10, must eat by turn 70) can be targeted later once freed. Moving right also positions the snake to navigate toward the top-right area, where it can loop back to eat (1,5) after it is freed.\n\n**Long-term plan (5+ turns):**\n- **Turn 61**: Move R to (3,1) to eat food and avoid the deadly left path.\n- **Turn 62**: Move R to (4,1) – only safe move (other directions blocked).\n- **Turn 63**: Move R to (5,1) – only safe move.\n- **Turn 64**: Move R to (6,1) – only safe move.\n- **Turn 65**: From (6,1), move U to (6,2) to avoid walls and body.\n- **Beyond**: Head toward (6,4) or (5,4) to navigate toward the left side, targeting the (1,5) food once freed. The (1,5) food will be freed as the snake moves (body segment moves away), and with life span 10, there is time (must eat by turn 70). Avoid the internal obstacle at (5,2) and walls.\n\nThis path prioritizes survival by avoiding the fatal trap in the left path and sets up opportunities to eat (1,5) later. It sacrifices the expiring (1,3) food but ensures the snake lives to eat other foods.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: R (right)  \nTurn 62: R (right)  \nTurn 63: R (right)  \nTurn 64: R (right)  \nTurn 65: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 62, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,1), and the body segments follow: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). The head direction is right (R), so the snake was moving to the right when it arrived at (3,1).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 62, it has life span 1, meaning it will be gone by turn 63 if not eaten now.\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So, it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning it will be available until turn 64 (since life span decreases each turn, including current turn 62, so after turn 62, life span 2; turn 63, life span 1; turn 64, gone).\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 9. Value is 1 for all, so all are positive food? The value is given as 1 for each, so all are positive food, I think. In the input, it says \"Value and Life Span\", and for (1,5) it's 9,1? No, let's read carefully.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\":\n- (6,5,1,1) — probably (x,y, life_span, value)? But value is listed after, I think it's (x,y, value, life_span). In the core rules, it says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (6,5), it's value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3,3,1) — (x,y, value, life_span)? It says ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (1,3), value=3? No, let's see the input:\n\n\" - (6, 5, 1, 1)\" — this might be ambiguous. Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6,5,1,1) - (1,3,3,1) - (1,5,9,1)\"\n\nI think it's (x,y, value, life_span). So:\n\n- (6,5): value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (1,3): value=3, life_span=1? But life_span=1, and value=3? That doesn't make sense because earlier it says positive food value +1, but here it might be different.\n\nIn the core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", but in the state, for (1,3,3,1), it might be value=3? But it says \"Value and Life Span\", and for (1,3,3,1), if it's (x,y, value, life_span), then value=3, life_span=1? But the core rules say positive food has value +1, so perhaps this is a mistake or I misread.\n\nLet's read the core rules again: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nAnd in the input: \" - (6,5,1,1) \" — I think it's shorthand for ( (6,5), 1, 1 ), so value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, \" - (1,3,3,1)\" — ( (1,3), 3, 1 )? But that would be value=3, life_span=1.\n\nBut core rules say positive food has value +1, so perhaps this is an exception or I misremember.\n\nCore rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", but in this state, all values are positive? (6,5,1,1) value=1, (1,3,3,1) value=3, (1,5,9,1) value=9? Life_span for (1,3) is 1, for (1,5) is 1, but (1,3) has value=3? That seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? But the description says \"Value and Life Span\", and in the list, it's given as numbers, so I think for (6,5,1,1) it's ambiguous.\n\nLook at the input: \" - (6, 5, 1, 1) \" and \" - (1, 3, 3, 1) \" — I think it's (x,y, value, life_span) because for (6,5) it's 1,1 which could be value=1, life_span=1, and for (1,3) it's 3,1, which might be value=3, life_span=1, but core rules say positive food is +1, so perhaps there are different values.\n\nI think I should go by the input. In the state, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), so:\n\n- Food at (6,5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n\n- Food at (1,3): value = 3, life_span = 1?  (1,3,3,1) — if it's (x,y, value, life_span), then value=3, life_span=1\n\n- Food at (1,5): value = 9, life_span = 1? (1,5,9,1) value=9, life_span=1\n\nBut life_span=1 for all? For (1,5) it's 9,1, so value=9, life_span=1.\n\nBut in the list, for (1,3) it's \"3,1\" and for (1,5) \"9,1\", so yes, value is not always 1.\n\nCore rules say \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", but here values are 1,3,9, all positive, so it's fine, I guess the value can be higher for some food.\n\nSimilarly, life_span: all have life_span 1? (6,5,1,1) life_span=1, (1,3,3,1) life_span=1, (1,5,9,1) life_span=1. So all food will disappear after this turn if not eaten, since life_span=1 and we're on turn 62.\n\nLife_span decreases every turn including current, so with life_span=1, it will be gone after turn 62, meaning on turn 63 it won't be there.\n\nFor example, food at (6,5) with life_span=1: on turn 62, it is present; if not eaten, after turn 62, it disappears, so not available on turn 63.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut (1,3) has life_span=3? No, according to input, (1,3,3,1) — if (x,y, value, life_span), then for (1,3), value=3, life_span=1? That can't be right because it says \"life_span and value\", and in the text it's \" (1,3,3,1) \" but earlier for (6,5) it's \"1,1\" which is value=1, life_span=1, so similarly (1,3,3,1) value=3, life_span=1.\n\nBut let's read the input carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6,5,1,1) - (1,3,3,1) - (1,5,9,1)\"\n\nIt says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the tuple it's listed as (x,y, ?, ?). The description says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \", so I think it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n\nFor (6,5,1,1): value=1, life_span=1\n\n(1,3,3,1): value=3, life_span=1\n\n(1,5,9,1): value=9, life_span=1\n\nAll have life_span=1, so all food will disappear after this turn if not eaten. That means on turn 62, I must eat them or they are gone forever.\n\nBut there are three food items, all with short life.\n\nAlso, snake head is at (3,1), direction R.\n\nFirst, let's list all positions.\n\nGrid is from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go there. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's list them in order:\n\nHead: (3,1)\n\nThen body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nTail is (5,6)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (6,5) value 1, life 1\n\n- (1,3) value 3, life 1\n\n- (1,5) value 9, life 1\n\nAll life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\nBut (1,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (1,5), which is the 11th segment: positions are (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nSo (1,5) is occupied by the snake body. Specifically, it's the segment at index 10 if head is 0: let's index: head (3,1) idx 0, (2,1) idx 1, (2,2) idx 2, (3,2) idx 3, (4,2) idx 4, (4,3) idx 5, (3,3) idx 6, (3,4) idx 7, (2,4) idx 8, (1,4) idx 9, (1,5) idx 10, (2,5) idx 11, etc.\n\nSo (1,5) has a body segment, and there is food at (1,5) with value 9.\n\nBut according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) has a body segment, so the food is under the snake, but to eat it, the body must move away first, then head moves in.\n\nSince we're on turn 62, and the snake moves, the body will move when the head moves.\n\nAlso, head direction is R, so from (3,1), moving right would go to (4,1), but let's see possible moves.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the move for turn 62.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1) with direction R: since direction is R, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so I cannot move left (L) because that would be opposite to current direction R. Current direction is the direction the head was moving when it arrived at (3,1), so from previous position.\n\nThe snake was moving right to reach (3,1), so current head direction is R.\n\nTherefore, for next move, I can go U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite to R.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from (3,1), with dir R, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,2)\n\n- D: to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so not possible\n\n- L: to (2,1) but L is opposite to R, so not allowed\n\n- R: to (4,1)\n\nSo only possible moves are U or R. D to (3,0) is wall, L not allowed.\n\nNow, (3,2) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (3,1) head, (2,1) is next, then (2,2), (3,2) is position of idx 3? Let's list coordinates:\n\nIdx 0: (3,1) head\n\nIdx 1: (2,1)\n\nIdx 2: (2,2)\n\nIdx 3: (3,2)\n\nIdx 4: (4,2)\n\netc.\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied by idx 3, which is part of the body.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), that would be moving onto a body segment, which is collision, deadly, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (4,1): what is at (4,1)? Not listed in snake positions, so should be empty.\n\nSnake positions: from (3,1), R to (4,1), which is not in the list, so free.\n\nAlso, walls: x=4, y=1 is within bounds, x=4 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, and no internal obstacle, so (4,1) is free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,1), since U to (3,2) is body collision.\n\nD to (3,0) is wall, L not allowed.\n\nSo for turn 62, I must move R to (4,1).\n\nBut there are food to eat, all with life span 1, so I need to eat them this turn or lose them.\n\nBut with move to (4,1), I'm not eating any food.\n\nFood at (6,5), (1,3), (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is occupied by snake body, so I can't eat it directly; I need to move the head there after the body moves away.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is free, I think, not occupied.\n\nList all cells: snake occupies: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFood at (6,5), (1,3), (1,5)\n\n(1,5) has both food and snake body.\n\n(1,3) is not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(6,5) is not in snake positions, so free.\n\nBut I'm at (3,1), moving to (4,1), which is away from all food.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), the snake will have new head at (4,1), and tail moves, so the segment at (5,6) will be removed if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n\nBut all food disappears after this turn, so I miss all food on this turn.\n\nBut I have no choice; only move is to (4,1).\n\nPerhaps I can plan for future turns, but for turn 62, I must move to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 63, head at (4,1), direction from moving right, so dir R.\n\nPossible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1), R to (5,1)\n\nL is opposite to current dir R? Current dir is R, so L would be opposite, not allowed? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is the direction the head was moving when it arrived at the current position.\n\nAt turn 62, head was at (3,1) with dir R, then moved R to (4,1), so on arriving at (4,1), the direction is R.\n\nSo for turn 63, from (4,1), with dir R, possible moves: U, D, R, but not L.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, so U or R.\n\nU to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions after move: after moving to (4,1), the new positions: head at (4,1), then the body: previous head was (3,1) now body, so body: (3,1), (2,1)? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 62 start: snake: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]\n\nMove head R to (4,1), so new head (4,1), then the body: first segment moves to previous head position? No, in snake, when head moves, the body follows, so the segment that was at idx 0 moves to new position, idx 1 moves to idx 0 old position, and so on, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and if no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo after moving to (4,1):\n\n- New head: (4,1)\n\n- Then body: idx 1: (2,1) moves to previous head position (3,1)? No.\n\nThe positions shift: the segment that was at idx 0 is now at (4,1), but the body segments: the segment that was at idx 1 moves to where idx 0 was, which is (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, idx 2 moves to where idx 1 was, (2,1), and so on.\n\nLet's list:\n\nAfter move, new positions:\n\nHead: new position (4,1)\n\nThen, the first body segment is at the previous head position (3,1)\n\nThen, the second body segment is at the previous first body position, which was (2,1)\n\nThen, third body at previous second body position (2,2)\n\nFourth at (3,2)\n\nFifth at (4,2)\n\nSixth at (4,3)\n\nSeventh at (3,3)\n\nEighth at (3,4)\n\nNinth at (2,4)\n\nTenth at (1,4)\n\nEleventh at (1,5)\n\nTwelfth at (2,5)\n\nThirteenth at (3,5)\n\nFourteenth at (4,5)\n\nFifteenth at (5,5)\n\nAnd the tail was (5,6), but since no food eaten, it is removed, so snake has 15 segments now? Original 16 segments, no food, so length decreases? No, snake length: positions have 16 cells, after move, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so new snake has 16 - 1 = 15 segments? But usually, when no food, snake length stays the same, but the tail moves.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn snake game, when the head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed, so the snake length remains the same, but the tail cell is freed.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food eaten, number of segments remains the same, but the tail position changes.\n\nStart with N segments.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position, so we have a new head, and the body from idx 1 to N-1 move to the positions of idx 0 to N-2, and the tail (idx N-1) is removed if no food.\n\nSo the new snake has N segments: new head, and body from old idx 0 to old idx N-2.\n\nFor example, N=16 segments: idx 0 to 15.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, new head is the new position.\n\nNew body segment 1 is old head position (old idx 0)\n\nNew body segment 2 is old body segment 1 position (old idx 1)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment 15 is old body segment 14 position (old idx 14)\n\nAnd old tail (old idx 15) is removed.\n\nSo new snake has the same number of segments, 16, but the positions are shifted, and the old tail cell is free.\n\nIn this case, with 16 segments.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1):\n\n- New head: (4,1)\n\n- New body1: old head (3,1)\n\n- New body2: old body1 (2,1)\n\n- New body3: old body2 (2,2)\n\n- New body4: old body3 (3,2)\n\n- New body5: old body4 (4,2)\n\n- New body6: old body5 (4,3)\n\n- New body7: old body6 (3,3)\n\n- New body8: old body7 (3,4)\n\n- New body9: old body8 (2,4)\n\n- New body10: old body9 (1,4)\n\n- New body11: old body10 (1,5)\n\n- New body12: old body11 (2,5)\n\n- New body13: old body12 (3,5)\n\n- New body14: old body13 (4,5)\n\n- New body15: old body14 (5,5)\n\nAnd old body15 (5,6) is removed.\n\nSo new tail is at (5,5).\n\nNow, the food at (1,5) was under the body, but after move, the body that was at (1,5) is now at new body11 position, which is (1,5)? Old body10 was at (1,4), old body11 at (1,5), but after move, new body10 is at old body9 (1,4), new body11 is at old body10 (1,5), so (1,5) is still occupied by new body11.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (1,5) is still under the snake body.\n\nFood at (1,3) is free.\n\nBut all food disappears after turn 62, so on turn 63, no food left, since life_span=1 for all, and not eaten on turn 62.\n\nSo for turn 62, I can only move to (4,1), and no food eaten.\n\nThen on turn 63, head at (4,1), dir R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,2), which is occupied by new body5 at (4,2)? New positions: head (4,1), body1 (3,1), body2 (2,1), body3 (2,2), body4 (3,2), body5 (4,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) is body5, so moving U to (4,2) would collide.\n\nR to (5,1): what is (5,1)? Not occupied, not wall, x=5,y=1, walls x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (5,2) but (5,1) is different, so free.\n\nD to (4,0) wall.\n\nL to (3,1) but L is opposite to dir R, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nThen similarly, no food, so snake moves, tail shortens? No, length same.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for survival and future food, but currently no food, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,5) with value 9 is under the body, but it disappeared since not eaten on turn 62.\n\nAll food gone.\n\nSo now, I have to just survive and find a path.\n\nBut the snake is long, 16 segments, in a crowded space.\n\nLet's map the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, but borders walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 y=0,7 walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions after turn 62: head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nTail at (5,5)\n\nCells occupied: (4,1) head, (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6)? y=6 not wall, y=7 wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(1,1): not occupied, free.\n\n(1,2): not in list, free.\n\n(1,3): free, but no food.\n\n(1,6): free.\n\n(2,3): not occupied, free.\n\n(2,6): free.\n\n(3,6): free.\n\n(4,6): free.\n\n(5,1): free, we are moving to (5,1) on turn 63.\n\n(5,3): not occupied.\n\n(5,4): not occupied.\n\n(5,6): free, but was tail, removed.\n\n(6,1) to (6,6) free except where occupied.\n\n(6,5) was food but gone.\n\nNow, on turn 63, moving to (5,1), so head to (5,1), dir R.\n\nThen possible moves from (5,1): U to (5,2), but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so not possible.\n\nD to (5,0) wall.\n\nL to (4,1), but L is opposite to dir R? Current dir is R, so L not allowed.\n\nR to (6,1)\n\n(6,1) is not wall, x=6<7, y=1>0, so free.\n\nSo only move R to (6,1).\n\nThen on turn 64, head at (6,1), dir R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,2), D to (6,0) wall, L to (5,1), but L opposite to R, not allowed, R to (7,1) but x=7 wall.\n\nSo only U or D, but D wall, so only U to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is free, I think.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1) on turn 63, let's update positions.\n\nAt turn 63 start: head (4,1), body (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nMove head R to (5,1), so new head (5,1)\n\nNew body1: old head (4,1)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (3,1)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (2,1)\n\nNew body4: old body3 (2,2)\n\nNew body5: old body4 (3,2)\n\nNew body6: old body5 (4,2)\n\nNew body7: old body6 (4,3)\n\nNew body8: old body7 (3,3)\n\nNew body9: old body8 (3,4)\n\nNew body10: old body9 (2,4)\n\nNew body11: old body10 (1,4)\n\nNew body12: old body11 (1,5)\n\nNew body13: old body12 (2,5)\n\nNew body14: old body13 (3,5)\n\nNew body15: old body14 (4,5)\n\nOld body15 (5,5) removed.\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nNow (6,2) is free.\n\nMove U to (6,2) on turn 64.\n\nHead to (6,2), dir U (since moved up).\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall.\n\nL to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, obstacle.\n\nD to (6,1) is body? New positions after move to (6,2): but we are at turn 64.\n\nFirst, after turn 63 move, head at (5,1), dir R.\n\nOn turn 64, move U to (6,2)? From (6,1) to (6,2) is U.\n\nAfter move to (6,2), new head (6,2), dir U.\n\nThen body: new body1: old head (6,1) -- but at turn 63 end, head at (5,1), so after move to (6,2), new head (6,2), new body1: old head position (5,1), new body2: old body1 (4,1), and so on.\n\nBut (6,1) is now body1.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2): U to (6,3), D to (6,1), but (6,1) is now body, so collision if move there.\n\nL to (5,2) wall.\n\nR to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only U to (6,3), which is free.\n\nMove to (6,3).\n\nThen similarly, I can keep moving up along x=6.\n\nBut the space is tight.\n\nI need to think about long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but not specified, so for now, no food, just survive.\n\nThe snake is in a position where it might be trapped.\n\nLet's list the free areas.\n\nThe grid has walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies many cells: from (1,4) to (5,5), etc.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(5,1) is occupied after turn 63, but let's see the current state.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on turn 62 first.\n\nBut for turn 62, I have no choice but to move R to (4,1), as established.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, in the state, there is food at (1,5) with value 9 under the body, but to eat it, I need to move the head there after the body moves away.\n\nBut with life span 1, I must eat it on turn 62, but I can't because the body is there, and I can't move to (1,5) directly.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I can only move to (4,1), not to (1,5).\n\nSo impossible to eat (1,5) on this turn.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is far, I can't reach in one move.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), also far.\n\nSo for turn 62, I must move to (4,1), and all food is lost.\n\nThen on turn 63, move to (5,1), turn 64 to (6,1), turn 65 to (6,2), turn 66 to (6,3), and so on.\n\nBut at (6,3), I can go to (6,4), then (6,5), but (6,5) was food but gone.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go U to (6,6), or L to (5,5), but (5,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns.\n\nTurn 62: move R to (4,1)\n\nSnake after: head (4,1), body (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)  -- 16 segments, tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 63: from (4,1) dir R, move R to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), body1 (4,1), body2 (3,1), body3 (2,1), body4 (2,2), body5 (3,2), body6 (4,2), body7 (4,3), body8 (3,3), body9 (3,4), body10 (2,4), body11 (1,4), body12 (1,5), body13 (2,5), body14 (3,5), body15 (4,5)  tail (4,5) -- old (5,5) removed\n\nTurn 64: from (5,1) dir R, only move U to (5,2) but wall, or R to (6,1), so move R to (6,1)\n\nNew head (6,1), body1 (5,1), body2 (4,1), body3 (3,1), body4 (2,1), body5 (2,2), body6 (3,2), body7 (4,2), body8 (4,3), body9 (3,3), body10 (3,4), body11 (2,4), body12 (1,4), body13 (1,5), body14 (2,5), body15 (3,5)  tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 65: from (6,1) dir R (since moved right), possible moves U to (6,2), D to (6,0) wall, L to (5,1) but L opposite to R, not allowed, R to (7,1) wall. So only U to (6,2)\n\nMove U to (6,2)\n\nNew head (6,2), body1 (6,1), body2 (5,1), body3 (4,1), body4 (3,1), body5 (2,1), body6 (2,2), body7 (3,2), body8 (4,2), body9 (4,3), body10 (3,3), body11 (3,4), body12 (2,4), body13 (1,4), body14 (1,5), body15 (2,5)  tail (2,5)\n\nDirection after move: moved up, so dir U.\n\nTurn 66: from (6,2) dir U, possible moves U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2) wall, R to (7,2) wall. D to (6,1) is body1, collision. So only U to (6,3)\n\nMove U to (6,3)\n\nNew head (6,3), body1 (6,2), body2 (6,1), body3 (5,1), body4 (4,1), body5 (3,1), body6 (2,1), body7 (2,2), body8 (3,2), body9 (4,2), body10 (4,3), body11 (3,3), body12 (3,4), body13 (2,4), body14 (1,4), body15 (1,5)  tail (1,5)\n\nDir U.\n\nTurn 67: from (6,3) dir U, possible U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\nD to (6,2) is body1, collision.\n\nR wall.\n\nL to (5,3): free? (5,3) not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\nU to (6,4) free.\n\nSo I can choose U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), then to (6,5), (6,6), but (6,6) is corner, may dead end.\n\nIf L to (5,3), then I can explore the center.\n\nBut the body is trailing.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (1,5), so some space is freeing up.\n\nBut for long-term, I need to find a path to loop or something.\n\nSince no food, the snake length won't increase, so I can manage.\n\nBut the grid has limited space.\n\nCells occupied: from above, after turn 66, snake at (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (3,6) etc.\n\n(5,3) is free, (5,4) free, (5,5) free, etc.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), then from there U to (6,5), then U to (6,6), then from (6,6), only L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) but (6,5) body, so only L to (5,6).\n\nThen from (5,6), can go L to (4,6) or D to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nIf from (6,3) I go L to (5,3), then to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 62 and subsequent turns.\n\nBut the output format is for the current turn and future turns, but I think for turn 62, I must move R.\n\nThen for turn 63, move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 64, move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 65, move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 66, move U to (6,3)\n\nThen at turn 67, I have choice, but I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if there is a way to eat the food, but on turn 62, it's impossible.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,5) is under the body, but with value 9, high reward, but life span 1, so I can't eat it this turn.\n\nUnless the body moves away and head moves in, but on the same turn, when I move, the body moves with the head, so if I move such that the body at (1,5) moves, but it's not the tail; the tail is at (5,6), so when I move, the body at (1,5) will move to where the previous segment was, but the head is far away, so I can't reach (1,5) in one move.\n\nFor example, to eat food at (1,5), I need to have the head move to (1,5) after the body there moves away.\n\nBut the body at (1,5) is part of the chain; when I move the head, the body at (1,5) will move to (1,4) if the segment before moves, but it's not direct.\n\nSpecifically, the cell (1,5) will be freed only if the tail moves away, but the tail is at (5,6), so when I move, the tail moves, but the body at (1,5) will be occupied by a different segment.\n\nIn general, for food under body, it can only be eaten when the snake moves such that the body vacates that cell and the head moves into it on the same turn or something? The rules say: \"the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nBut \"moves away\" means that on this turn, when the snake moves, the segment that was on that cell moves to another cell, and simultaneously, the head moves to that cell.\n\nBut in snake movement, all segments move at the same time.\n\nSo if a body segment is on a food cell, and on this turn, that body segment moves to a different position, and the head moves to that food cell, then it can be eaten.\n\nFor that, the head must be adjacent to the food cell, and the body segment on it must be moving away.\n\nBut in this case, for (1,5), the body segment is at idx 10 or something.\n\nAt turn 62, head at (3,1), food at (1,5) under body.\n\nThe body segment at (1,5) is not adjacent to head; head is at (3,1), adjacent cells are (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), (3,0) wall, so (1,5) is not adjacent, so I can't move to (1,5) in one move.\n\nSimilarly, the body at (1,5) will move to (1,4) when the snake moves, but (1,4) is also occupied, so the cell (1,5) will be freed only if no segment moves to it, but in this move, since the head moves to (4,1), the body shifts, so the segment that was at (1,4) moves to (1,5)? Let's see.\n\nWhen head moves from (3,1) to (4,1), the body segment at (2,1) moves to (3,1), (2,2) moves to (2,1), (3,2) moves to (2,2), (4,2) moves to (3,2), (4,3) moves to (4,2), etc., down to (1,4) moves to (1,4)? Old positions: idx 9: (1,4), idx 10: (1,5), idx 11: (2,5), etc.\n\nAfter move, new body10: old body9 (1,4), so at (1,4)\n\nNew body11: old body10 (1,5), so at (1,5)\n\nSo (1,5) is still occupied by new body11.\n\nThe food is still under the body at (1,5).\n\nAnd it wasn't eaten, so it disappears.\n\nNo way to eat it on this turn.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nSo for turn 62, only choice is to move R to (4,1).\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for a few turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 62, move R.\n\nThen turn 63, from (4,1) dir R, move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 64, from (5,1) dir R, move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 65, from (6,1) dir R, move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 66, from (6,2) dir U, move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 67, from (6,3) dir U, I can move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3)\n\nTo maximize survival, moving L to (5,3) might be better to go to the center, whereas U to (6,4) leads to corner.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter much.\n\nBut for the sake of output, I need to choose.\n\nAlso, there might be new food later, but not specified.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with L to (5,3) on turn 67.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 62: move R\n\nThen the snake is at (4,1) with dir R.\n\nTurn 63: from (4,1) dir R, only R possible, so move R\n\nTurn 64: from (5,1) dir R, only R possible, move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 65: from (6,1) dir R, only U possible, move U\n\nTurn 66: from (6,2) dir U, only U possible, move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 67: from (6,3) dir U, I have choices: U to (6,4) or L to (5,3)\n\nBoth are free, no immediate danger.\n\nMoving L to (5,3) might be better as it avoids the top-right corner.\n\nSo move L.\n\nThen turn 68, from (5,3) dir? After moving L from (6,3) to (5,3), direction is L.\n\nThen possible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4), D to (5,2) wall, L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but (6,3) is body now.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), new head (5,3), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,2), etc.\n\nSo R to (6,3) is body, collision.\n\nD wall.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nU to (5,4), L to (4,3)\n\nBoth free.\n\nI can choose U or L.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor the output, I can stop at turn 67 or so.\n\nSince the food is all gone, the main goal is to survive, so any move is fine as long as not collision.\n\nBut for turn 62, it's fixed.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 62: R\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L  (to (5,3))\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, in the output format, it's \"Turn t1: action\", etc.\n\nAnd action in {U, D, L, R}\n\nSo for turn 62: R\n\nBut let's confirm the state.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,5) is under the body, and it's the tail? No, tail is at (5,6), not (1,5).\n\nAlso, there is a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, not relevant.\n\nFor turn 62, no other option.\n\nSo I think for turn 62, move R.\n\nThen for future turns, as above.\n\nBut to be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 62)\n\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: Head at (3,1) with direction Right (R). The snake body occupies multiple cells, creating a congested area.\n- **Food Items**: All food has a life span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Specifically:\n  - (6,5): Value 1 (positive)\n  - (1,3): Value 3 (positive)\n  - (1,5): Value 9 (positive) — but under the snake body at position (1,5), so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it this turn.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - From (3,1) with direction R, possible moves are Up (U) to (3,2), Down (D) to (3,0) (wall, invalid), Left (L) (reverse, not allowed), or Right (R) to (4,1).\n  - (3,2) is occupied by the snake body (segment at index 3), so moving U causes collision. Only valid move is R to (4,1), which is empty and safe.\n- **Food Accessibility**:\n  - (1,5) food is under the body and not adjacent to the head (head at (3,1), food at (1,5)), so it cannot be eaten this turn. The body segment at (1,5) will not vacate the cell in a way that allows head access this turn.\n  - (1,3) and (6,5) are too far to reach in one move.\n  - All food disappears after turn 62, so no food can be eaten on this turn. Survival is the priority.\n- **Long-Term Survival Planning (5+ Turns Ahead)**:\n  - After moving to (4,1) on turn 62, the snake must navigate to avoid dead ends and collisions. The grid has limited free space due to walls (borders and (5,2)) and the long snake body.\n  - Path chosen: Move right to (6,1) by turns 62-64, then up to (6,3) by turn 66. This avoids immediate collisions and opens options to explore the right side of the grid.\n  - On turn 67, move left to (5,3) to access the center area, preventing trapping in the corner and allowing future flexibility. This path prioritizes open space and minimizes risk.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 62 to 67)\n- **Turn 62**: Move R to (4,1) — Only safe move; avoids collision and wall.\n- **Turn 63**: Move R to (5,1) — From (4,1) with dir R, only R is valid (U to (4,2) is body collision; D and L invalid).\n- **Turn 64**: Move R to (6,1) — From (5,1) with dir R, only R is valid (U to (5,2) is wall; D and L invalid).\n- **Turn 65**: Move U to (6,2) — From (6,1) with dir R, only U is valid (D to (6,0) wall; L and R invalid or collision).\n- **Turn 66**: Move U to (6,3) — From (6,2) with dir U, only U is valid (D to (6,1) is body collision; L and R invalid).\n- **Turn 67**: Move L to (5,3) — From (6,3) with dir U, L to (5,3) is safe and moves toward center for better survival. U to (6,4) is possible but risks corner trapping; L is preferred for long-term pathing.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 63: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 64: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 65: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 66: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 67: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 63. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (5,2) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,1), and the body segments follow. The direction is R (right), meaning the snake was moving right to get to (4,1). Since it's at (4,1) and direction is R, it must have come from the left, so previous position was (3,1), which matches the list: positions are [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), ...].\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. Since it's turn 63, this food will disappear after 3 turns, so on turn 66.\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 8, so it disappears on turn 71.\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 63.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls are at the borders, so cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions: let's list all positions to understand the shape.\n\nSnake: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nSo, head at (4,1), tail at (5,5). Length is 16 segments.\n\nNow, head direction is R, so from turn 62 to 63, it moved right to (4,1). So on turn 63, it can move U, D, L, or R, but not L because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Since it was moving R, it cannot move L (left) on the next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2), D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid. L to (3,1), but that's the body segment, and it's not the tail? Let's see.\n\n(3,1) is the second segment, which is part of the body. But the snake can move into the cell that will be vacated by the tail, but only if it's the tail segment.\n\nGeneral rule: moving into a body segment causes collision, except if it's the tail segment, because the tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, from (4,1), moving L to (3,1): (3,1) is occupied by the second segment, not the tail. The tail is at (5,5). So (3,1) is a body segment that will not move immediately; when the head moves, the body follows, so (3,1) will become the new head position or something? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if the head moves to a new cell, the segment at (4,1) becomes the neck, and so on, the tail moves forward.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves from (4,1) to, say, (5,1), then (4,1) is now where the neck is, but the positions shift: new head at (5,1), then the old head (4,1) becomes part of body, and so on, until the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n\nBut for collision: if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail segment, it collides and dies. Because the tail will move, so the tail cell is safe to enter only if it's the only one.\n\nIn this case, from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2)\n\n- D: to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (3,1)\n\n- R: to (5,1)\n\nNow, (3,1) is currently occupied by the second segment. When the head moves, if it goes to (3,1), that cell has a body segment, and it's not the tail, so collision occurs immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) might be empty or not.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake positions: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nSo cells occupied: (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nNow, (4,2) is occupied, (3,1) occupied, (5,1): what is (5,1)? Let's see the grid.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) wall.\n\n(5,1): is it occupied? Snake has (5,5) but not (5,1), and no wall, so (5,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is occupied by snake, as per positions.\n\nFrom (4,1):\n\n- Move U to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by snake body (it's the 6th segment in the list, indices: head (4,1) index 0, (3,1) index 1, (2,1) index 2, (2,2) index 3, (3,2) index 4? Let's index properly.\n\nPositions list: index 0: (4,1) head, index 1: (3,1), index 2: (2,1), index 3: (2,2), index 4: (3,2), index 5: (4,2), index 6: (4,3), index 7: (3,3), index 8: (3,4), index 9: (2,4), index 10: (1,4), index 11: (1,5), index 12: (2,5), index 13: (3,5), index 14: (4,5), index 15: (5,5) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is index 5, which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is index 15 (5,5).\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,2) would collide with body.\n\nMoving to (3,1): index 1, body segment, collide.\n\nMoving to (5,1): (5,1) is not in snake positions, and not wall (since walls are borders and (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,1) is separate).\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (5,1) is within 1-6,1-6, and not (5,2), so (5,1) is empty and free.\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so cannot move there, but (5,1) is different cell.\n\nAlso, moving D to (4,0) is y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,1), with head direction R, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) but occupied, invalid\n\n- D: to (4,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (3,1) occupied, invalid\n\n- R: to (5,1) free, valid\n\nOnly possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nIs that right? Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to (4,1), so it cannot move left immediately, but left is invalid anyway.\n\nBut up and down are also invalid, so only right is possible.\n\nConfirm: (4,2) is occupied, yes, by the snake body at (4,2).\n\n(3,1) occupied.\n\n(4,0) wall.\n\n(5,1) free? Let's list all free cells.\n\nGrid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except walls and obstacles.\n\nObstacles: border walls and (5,2).\n\nSo cells: all (x,y) for x=1-6, y=1-6 except (5,2) blocked.\n\nSnake occupies: (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is tail, but occupied now.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,6), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,1), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(1,3) has food, but we'll see.\n\nFrom (4,1), only (5,1) is adjacent and free.\n\nAdjacent cells: up (4,2) - occupied, down (4,0) - wall, left (3,1) - occupied, right (5,1) - free.\n\nYes, so only possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nBut the problem is to think multiple turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake has (1,5) at index 11, which is a body segment.\n\nFood at (1,5) with value 1, life span 8.\n\nBut (1,5) is currently occupied by the snake, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and then head moves back, but with the rules.\n\nSpecial cases: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) has food and is occupied by snake body, so it's not accessible now.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has food and is free, I think.\n\n(1,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free and has food.\n\nNow, life span: for (1,3), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 63, so for food at (1,3), life span 3: it will disappear on turn 66. That means it exists on turns 63,64,65, and gone on 66.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 8, exists until turn 70, gone on 71.\n\nTurn 63: present, turn 64: present, ..., until turn 70, gone on 71. Life span N, disappears after N turns, so if life span is L, it lasts for L turns, from turn t to t+L-1, disappears on turn t+L.\n\nIn this case, for (1,3): life span 3, turn 63, so it is available on turn 63,64,65, gone on 66.\n\nFor (1,5): life span 8, available turn 63 to 70, gone on 71.\n\nBut (1,5) is occupied by snake body, so cannot be eaten until the snake moves off it.\n\nNow, back to turn 63: head at (4,1), only move is R to (5,1).\n\nSo for turn 63, action must be R.\n\nThen new head position: (5,1)\n\nAfter move, the snake: new head at (5,1), then the body: the segment that was at (4,1) is now at position 1, (3,1) at 2, etc., and the tail (5,5) will be removed if no food eaten, but since we moved to (5,1) which has no food (food is at (1,3) and (1,5)), so no food eaten, so tail is removed.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, tail is removed, so the new positions: head at (5,1), then previous positions except the tail is cut off.\n\nOld positions: indices 0 to 15: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,1), and since no food, tail (5,5) is removed, so new positions: head at (5,1), then the segment that was index 0 (4,1) becomes new index 1, index 1 (3,1) becomes index 2, ..., up to index 14 (4,5) becomes index 15? Let's see.\n\nThe body segments shift: the segment at old index 0 moves to the new head position? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo new head at (5,1), which is new position.\n\nThen, the segment that was at index 0 (4,1) is now the position for index 1 (neck).\n\nSimilarly, index 1 (3,1) moves to where index 0 was, but not exactly.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Then the body: the first body segment is at old head position (4,1)\n\n- Then old index 1: (3,1)\n\n- Old index 2: (2,1)\n\n- Old index 3: (2,2)\n\n- And so on, up to old index 14: (4,5)\n\n- The tail old index 15 (5,5) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nOld positions had 16 segments, after move, no food, so 15 segments: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and tail at (4,5)? New list: positions from above: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nThat's 15 positions, yes. Tail at (3,5).\n\n(4,5) was old index 14, which is now part of body, and (3,5) is the last, tail.\n\nIn the new list, index 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (2,4), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (3,5) tail.\n\nNow, head direction: since we moved R to (5,1), new direction is R.\n\nNow turn 64.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,0) y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1), which is now occupied by the neck segment? (4,1) is index 1, body segment.\n\nWhen we move, can we move to the neck?\n\nGenerally, moving to the immediate neck is not allowed because it's a body segment and not tail.\n\n(4,1) is the first body segment, so moving to it would cause collision.\n\nR to (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is within bounds? x=6, y=1, borders: x=7 is wall, so x=6 is not border, y=1 not border, and no internal obstacle, so (6,1) should be free.\n\nIs it occupied? Not in snake positions, and not wall, so free.\n\nAlso, no reverse: current direction R, so L is reverse, but L is invalid anyway.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (5,2) obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (5,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (4,1) occupied by body, invalid\n\n- R: (6,1) free, valid\n\nSo only move is R to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 64 action R.\n\nNew head at (6,1), no food there, so tail removed: old tail was (3,5), so new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), tail at (3,5) removed? Let's list.\n\nOld positions: after turn 63, we had [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nAfter moving to (6,1), no food, so new positions: head (6,1), then the rest: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 65.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (6,2)\n\nD to (6,0) wall, invalid\n\nL to (5,1) which is the neck, occupied, invalid\n\nR to (7,1) x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only U to (6,2) might be possible.\n\n(6,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nYes, so move U to (6,2).\n\nAction U for turn 65.\n\nNew head at (6,2), no food, tail removed: old tail (2,5), so new positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nTail at (1,5)? Positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nTail at (1,5), but (1,5) has food? (1,5) has food with value 1.\n\nBut we didn't eat it because head moved to (6,2), not to (1,5).\n\nNow, the food at (1,5) is still there, under the tail or what?\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,5), and there is food at (1,5), but since the tail is there, it can be eaten only if the tail moves away and head comes later.\n\nBut for now, no eating.\n\nDirection: moved U, so new direction U.\n\nTurn 66.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (6,3)\n\nD to (6,1) which is the neck, occupied, invalid\n\nL to (5,2) obstacle, invalid\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid\n\nSo only U to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) free? Yes, should be free.\n\nMove U to (6,3).\n\nAction U for turn 66.\n\nNo food at (6,3), so tail removed: old tail (1,5), so new positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, food: (1,3) was available until turn 65, but now turn 66, it should be gone. Life span: from turn 63, life span 3, so present on 63,64,65, gone on 66. Yes, so on turn 66, (1,3) food is gone.\n\n(1,5) food is still there, life span 8, until turn 70.\n\nBut (1,5) is now free? After we moved, tail was at (1,5) on turn 65, but on turn 66, we moved tail to (1,4)? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 65 move to (6,2), positions had tail at (1,5).\n\nThen turn 66, move to (6,3), no food, so tail removed, which was (1,5), so (1,5) is now free, and food is there.\n\nFood was at (1,5), and now snake has moved off it, so the food is exposed and can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is now tail.\n\nNow turn 67.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (6,4)\n\nD to (6,2) neck, invalid\n\nL to (5,3)\n\nR to (7,3) wall, invalid\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(6,4) free? Not occupied, should be free.\n\n(5,3) free? Yes.\n\nAlso, no reverse issue, direction U, so D is reverse but invalid anyway.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nFood at (1,5) is available until turn 70, and it's positive.\n\nBut head is at (6,3), far away.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 14 segments now? Started with 16, we moved three times without eating, so length decreased to 13? Let's track length.\n\nInitial: 16 segments.\n\nTurn 63: move to (5,1), no eat, length 15\n\nTurn 64: move to (6,1), no eat, length 14\n\nTurn 65: move to (6,2), no eat, length 13\n\nTurn 66: move to (6,3), no eat, length 12\n\nAfter turn 66: positions have 12 segments? From above: after turn 66 move, positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) — that's 15 positions? I think I miscounted.\n\nAfter turn 63: 15 positions\n\nTurn 64: move to (6,1), no eat, so 14 positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), ..., down to (2,5) — from earlier: after turn 64, positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) — 14 positions, tail at (1,5)\n\nTurn 65: move to (6,2), no eat, new positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) — 14 positions?

Let's list: indices 0: (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (2,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (4,2), 9: (4,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (3,4), 12: (2,4) tail. 13 segments.\n\nAfter turn 66 move to (6,3), no eat, new positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) — tail at (3,4). 13 positions? Head and 12 body, 13 segments.\n\nLength 13.\n\nFood at (1,5) is available, but we need to reach it.\n\nBack to turn 67: head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), L to (5,3), or D to (6,2) but neck, invalid, R to (7,3) wall invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(6,4) is free, (5,3) free.\n\nIf we go U to (6,4), then we can continue up or left, but we might get stuck or something.\n\nSince we want to eat the food at (1,5), we need to head left and down.\n\nBut it's turn 67, food at (1,5) available until turn 70, so 4 turns including 67,68,69,70.\n\nHead at (6,3), (1,5) is at distance |6-1| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7, so Manhattan distance 7, but with snake body, it might not be direct.\n\nWe need to move towards it.\n\nBut we have to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because new tail grows and collides.\n\nBut tail is at (3,4) now, not near head.\n\nHead at (6,3), tail at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nFor turn 67, let's choose to move towards the food.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (1,5), we need to decrease x and increase y.\n\nSo L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\nU to (6,4) increases y, but x same, not closer.\n\nL to (5,3) decreases x, y same, closer in x.\n\nManhattan distance to (1,5): from (6,3) dx=5, dy=2, total 7.\n\nTo (5,3): dx=4, dy=2, total 6.\n\nTo (6,4): dx=5, dy=1, total 6.\n\nBoth reduce by 1, so similar.\n\nBut we should prefer to decrease x since dx is larger.\n\nAlso, after (5,3), we can go to (5,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nNow, (5,3) is free, as per earlier free cells.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) free.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and possible paths.\n\nSince the snake is long, we need to be careful not to trap ourselves.\n\nFor example, if we go up to (6,4), then to (6,5), but (6,5) might be free, then (6,6), but y=7 wall, so (6,6) is border? y=7 wall, so (6,6) is playable, x=6,y=6.\n\nThen from there, we can go left, but the body is below.\n\nBut it might be inefficient to reach (1,5).\n\nIf we go left to (5,3), then we can go to (5,4), (4,4), etc., towards left.\n\n(4,4) is free?

Not occupied, yes.\n\n(4,3) is occupied? Current positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) not occupied, free.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nAll possible.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) is available this turn (turn 70), since life span 8 from turn 63, so turn 70 is last turn, gone on 71.\n\nSo we can eat it if we reach (1,5) by turn 70.\n\nBut head is at (4,4), (1,5) is at distance |4-1| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4, so we can't reach in one move.\n\nWe need to be at (1,5) on turn 70.\n\nBut from (4,4), we can move to (3,4) or (4,5) or (4,3).\n\n(4,5) is closer in y, but x same.\n\nTo (1,5), we need to decrease x.\n\nSo move L to (3,4).\n\nThen from there, on turn 71, but turn 70 is the last chance, turn 71 food gone.\n\nSo we cannot reach (1,5) by turn 70 from here. It's too far.\n\nTurn 70, head at (4,4), (1,5) is 3 steps away in Manhattan, but with body, it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,5), we need to go to (3,4), then (2,4), then (1,5), but (2,4) and (3,4) may be free or not.\n\nCurrently, (3,4) is free, (2,4) free? After positions, (2,4) is not occupied, free.\n\nBut we need to be at (1,5) on turn 70, but it's turn 70 now, we are at (4,4), so we can move to (3,4) or (4,5), but not directly to (1,5).\n\nSo impossible to eat (1,5) on turn 70.\n\nSimilarly, we missed the opportunity.\n\nBut earlier, if we had moved differently, we might have reached it.\n\nFor example, on turn 67, we were at (6,3), we moved L to (5,3), but if we had moved U to (6,4), it might not be better.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (1,5) is far, and with decreasing length, it's harder to reach in time.\n\nTurn 67: head at (6,3), food at (1,5) available until turn 70, so 4 turns: 67,68,69,70.\n\nDistance 7, need to cover in 4 moves, possible but tight.\n\nBut we moved to (5,3) on 67, then to (5,4) on 68, then to (4,4) on 69, now on 70 at (4,4), we can move to (3,4) or (4,5), but (1,5) is still 2 steps away, not reachable in this turn.\n\nIf on turn 68 from (5,3), we could have moved L, but it was not possible, only U.\n\nOn turn 68, head at (5,3), we could only move U to (5,4).\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 67, from (6,3), we moved L, but U was also possible, but U to (6,4) doesn't help.\n\nIf on turn 67 we moved U to (6,4), then turn 68 from (6,4) direction U, can move U to (6,5), L to (5,4), or R invalid, D neck invalid.\n\n(6,5) free, (5,4) free.\n\nThen to reach (1,5), still far.\n\nFor example, to (5,4) on turn 68, then to (4,4) on 69, to (3,4) on 70, still not (1,5).\n\nWorse.\n\nSo we cannot eat the food; it's too far and time is short.\n\nNow, on turn 70, head at (4,4), we can move to (3,4), (4,5), or (4,3).\n\nSince we need to survive, and no food to eat, we should avoid risks.\n\nBut all moves are possible.\n\n(4,5) is free, (3,4) free, (4,3) free.\n\n(4,3) might be risky if body is there, but currently free.\n\nAfter positions, (4,3) is not occupied.\n\nLet's list current occupied after turn 69 move.\n\nAfter turn 69: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) free, (4,5) free, (3,4) free.\n\nMove to (3,4) for example.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut the point is to maximize score, so we should eat food if possible, but here no food available now.\n\n(1,5) food gone after this turn.\n\nAre there other food? No, only those two, and (1,3) gone.\n\nSo we need to survive and maybe find new food, but the state doesn't say new food spawns, so we have to work with current.\n\nThe food positions are given, and no new food mentioned, so only these two.\n\nSince we didn't eat any, score is zero so far.\n\nBut we need to survive as long as possible to maybe eat in future, but no more food, so the game might end when no food or something, but the rules don't specify, so we should just avoid dying.\n\nBut to maximize score, we need to eat.\n\nBut here, no food left after turn 70.\n\n(1,5) gone on turn 71.\n\nTurn 70 is last chance, but we can't eat it.\n\nSo for the sequence, we have to output actions from turn 63 onwards.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence for multiple turns, at least 5.\n\nFrom turn 63 to, say, 67 or more.\n\nIn the initial turns, we had to move R, R, U, U, then on 67 L, etc.\n\nBut let's list the actions we have:\n\nTurn 63: R (to 5,1)\n\nTurn 64: R (to 6,1)\n\nTurn 65: U (to 6,2)\n\nTurn 66: U (to 6,3)\n\nTurn 67: L (to 5,3)\n\nTurn 68: U (to 5,4)\n\nTurn 69: L (to 4,4)\n\nFor turn 70, we can choose, say, L to (3,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut since we need to output for turn 63 and beyond, and think ahead, but in this case, we have no choice in the first few moves.\n\nFrom turn 63, only R possible.\n\nTurn 64 only R possible.\n\nTurn 65 only U possible.\n\nTurn 66 only U possible.\n\nTurn 67: at (6,3), we had choice between U and L, we chose L to (5,3), but U was also possible.\n\nIn terms of survival, both are fine, but to reach food, L was better but didn't help.\n\nFor the sequence, I think we can output up to turn 67 or 68.\n\nThe answer format is to box the sequence for multiple turns.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) was available on turns 63,64,65, but on turn 63, we were forced to move away, and on 64,65 we were at (6,1) and (6,2), far away, so couldn't eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (1,5).\n\nSo no score gained.\n\nBut for the sequence, let's provide the actions.\n\nPerhaps on turn 67, we could have chosen differently, but it doesn't matter.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo for the answer, I think:\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nThen for turn 67, since we need to think ahead, but from there, we have choices.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead from current.\n\nCurrent turn 63, so plan at least to turn 68.\n\nFrom turn 63:\n\nTurn 63: R (only choice)\n\nTurn 64: R (only choice)\n\nTurn 65: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 66: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 67: at (6,3), can go U or L. Both are safe for now. Since we want to go towards where the food was, but it's gone, or to center, but L to (5,3) is fine.\n\nThen turn 68: from (5,3), only U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: from (5,4), can go U, L, or R.\n\nU to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nAll free.\n\nBut to be safe, say L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 70: from (4,4), to (3,4) or (4,5) or (4,3)\n\nSay (3,4)\n\nBut we can stop the sequence at turn 67 or 68 for the output.\n\nSince the state is given for turn 63, and we need to output actions starting from turn 63.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions for consecutive turns.\n\nBut how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be the actions.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 63 to 67.\n\nOr more.\n\nI think 5 turns is fine.\n\nSo for turn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L (or U, but we chose L)\n\nIn turn 67, both U and L are valid, but L is towards the left, which might be better for exploring.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence, I'll put L.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L\n\nThen if we want more, turn 68: U (from (5,3))\n\nBut for the box, perhaps up to turn 67.\n\nSince turn 67 is the 5th turn ahead? Turn 63,64,65,66,67: that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 63 is current, so actions for t63 to t67.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 67, moving L to (5,3) is valid, as we did.\n\nIf we moved U to (6,4), also valid, but we chose L.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe current state at turn 63 requires planning multiple turns ahead to maximize survival and score, considering the food positions and life spans. The snake must avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body, except for the tail cell under specific conditions. Food at (1,3) has a life span of 3, disappearing after turn 65, and food at (1,5) has a life span of 8, disappearing after turn 70. Both foods are positive (+1 score), but (1,5) is currently under the snake's body and can only be eaten if the snake moves away and the head returns later.\n\nAt turn 63, the snake head is at (4,1) with direction right (R). The only safe move is right (R) to (5,1), as other directions are blocked by walls or the snake's body. Subsequent turns are constrained by the snake's position and movement rules. After analysis, the food at (1,3) cannot be reached before it expires due to distance and the snake's initial forced moves away from it. The food at (1,5) is also unreachable by turn 70 due to the snake's path and decreasing length from not eating, making it impossible to score points in the near term. Thus, the priority is long-term survival by navigating safely and avoiding risks.\n\nThe planned sequence for turns 63 to 67 (5 turns ahead) is derived as follows:\n- **Turn 63**: Only possible move is R to (5,1) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 64**: From (5,1), only possible move is R to (6,1) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 65**: From (6,1), only possible move is U to (6,2) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 66**: From (6,2), only possible move is U to (6,3) to avoid collision.\n- **Turn 67**: From (6,3), possible moves are U to (6,4) or L to (5,3). Moving L to (5,3) is chosen to position the snake toward the center of the grid for better maneuverability and potential future food access, though no food is reachable in this sequence.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns, with no immediate risks or opportunities for scoring. Beyond turn 67, the snake should continue moving to open areas to avoid self-trapping.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 63: R (right)\nTurn 64: R (right)\nTurn 65: U (up)\nTurn 66: U (up)\nTurn 67: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nCurrent turn: t=64\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,1), and it's moving right (direction R). The full snake body is: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]. So the snake has 16 segments.\n\nFood items:\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 64, life span 2 means it will be gone after turn 65? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,3) with life span 2 at turn 64:\n- Turn 64: life span 2\n- Turn 65: life span 1\n- Turn 66: life span 0, so it disappears before turn 66 or after? The countdown decreases every turn, so at the start of turn 64, life span is 2. After the turn, it decreases to 1. After turn 65, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 64 or 65, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,5) with life span 7: available for 7 turns starting from turn 64.\nFood at (4,6) with life span 10: available for 10 turns.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, snake head direction is R, meaning it's moving right. So from (5,1), moving right would go to (6,1). But I need to check possible moves and think ahead.\n\nPossible moves from current position (5,1) with direction R:\n- Up (U): (5,2)\n- Down (D): (5,0) – but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n- Left (L): (4,1) – but that's the snake's body, segment 1, but since it's the neck, moving left would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is R, so left is opposite.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nSo from direction R, I cannot move L (left) because that's opposite. So only possible moves are U (up), D (down), or continue R (right). But D is to (5,0), which is wall, so invalid. So only U or R are possible? R to (6,1), U to (5,2).\n\n(6,1): is that valid? x=6, y=1. Walls are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=7 is wall, but x=6 should be fine since playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm grid size.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), inclusive. So (6,1) is within bounds.\n\nNow, (5,2): what is there? Snake body positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nSo:\n- (5,2) is not in this list? Positions: (4,2) is there, but (5,2) is not listed. Let's see: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), etc. So (5,2) is free? But there might be food or obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle is at (5,2)! Oh, yes, internal obstacles: [(5,2)]. So (5,2) is an obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves:\n- R (right) to (6,1): is this wall? x=6, y=1, x=6 is not wall, walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine, y=1 fine. But is it occupied? Snake positions: (6,1) not in list, so empty? But we need to check if it's a valid move.\n\n(6,1) should be empty, no snake or wall there. But let's confirm: snake has (5,1) and (4,1), but not (6,1). Walls: border walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, internal at (5,2). So (6,1) should be free.\n\nBut moving to (6,1): after moving, the snake head goes there, and tail moves, so no immediate collision.\n\n- U (up) to (5,2): but (5,2) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\n- D (down) to (5,0): y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- L (left) to (4,1): but (4,1) is the second segment of the snake, and it's occupied. Also, moving left is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (6,1)? But that can't be right because I need to think about future turns.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the move.\n\nBut let's list all possible actions for this turn.\n\nAvailable actions: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nD to (5,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nU to (5,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only R to (6,1) is possible? But (6,1) is within bounds and empty, so it should be safe for this turn.\n\nBut then what? After moving to (6,1), the snake head is at (6,1), direction becomes R (since we moved right).\n\nThen on next turn, from (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2), D to (6,0) invalid, L to (5,1), which is now the second segment? After moving, the snake positions change.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (5,1), body segments: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) – that's 15 body segments, total 16 cells including head.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten this turn if we move to (6,1), since no food there.\n\nSo after move to (6,1), new positions: head (6,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes segment 1, (4,1) segment 2, and so on, up to (4,5) which was tail? Let's list the new positions.\n\nOrder: after moving right to (6,1):\n- New head: (6,1)\n- Then the body: (5,1) (previous head), (4,1) (was segment 1), (3,1) (was seg2), (2,1) (seg3), (2,2) (seg4), (3,2) (seg5), (4,2) (seg6), (4,3) (seg7), (3,3) (seg8), (3,4) (seg9), (2,4) (seg10), (1,4) (seg11), (1,5) (seg12), (2,5) (seg13), (3,5) (seg14), and tail was (4,5) which is now seg15, but since no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is what was the second last segment.\n\nSnake length remains the same unless food eaten.\n\nPositions: after move, head to (6,1), then the first body segment is the old head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), and the last segment (4,5) is removed since no growth. So new positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)] – that's 16 positions? No, removed one, so should be 15 segments? Original 16 cells, after move without eating, new snake has head at new position, and the tail cell is removed, so length same, 16 segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal: 16 positions.\n\nAfter move: head to (6,1), and the body from index 1 to 15 become the new body segments, so positions 1 to 15 are shifted, but the last one is removed? Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated unless food eaten.\n\nSo for a snake with segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n\nAfter moving to new head position, new segments: new_head, S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{k-1}  (so Sk is removed).\n\nIn this case, S0 = (5,1), S1 = (4,1), S2 = (3,1), ..., up to S15 = (4,5) I think; let's index.\n\nPositions list: index 0: head (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (2,4), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (3,5), 15: (4,5)  so 16 segments, tail is index 15: (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,1) without eating:\n- New head: (6,1)\n- New body: the first body segment is old head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)  -- that's 15 segments, and the old tail (4,5) is removed.\n\nNew positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]  -- (3,5) is now the tail? From above, the new body has segments from old S0 to S14, so S0 to S14 are 15 segments, plus new head, 16 positions, but S14 is (3,5), and S15 was removed, so tail is (3,5).\n\nList: new head (6,1), then S0: (5,1), S1: (4,1), S2: (3,1), S3: (2,1), S4: (2,2), S5: (3,2), S6: (4,2), S7: (4,3), S8: (3,3), S9: (3,4), S10: (2,4), S11: (1,4), S12: (1,5), S13: (2,5), S14: (3,5) -- so 15 body segments after head? No: the list has 16 elements: head and 15 body, but since no growth, length should be 16, but the tail was removed, so it should be 15 segments? I'm confused.\n\nStandard: if no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail position is removed, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the cells shift.\n\nInitial: 16 cells.\nAfter move: new head at (6,1), and the segments from index 0 to 14 become the new body from index 1 to 15, but index 15 is removed.\n\nNew positions: index 0: (6,1)  new head\nIndex 1: old head (5,1)\nIndex 2: old S1 (4,1)\nIndex 3: old S2 (3,1)\nIndex 4: old S3 (2,1)\nIndex 5: old S4 (2,2)\nIndex 6: old S5 (3,2)\nIndex 7: old S6 (4,2)\nIndex 8: old S7 (4,3)\nIndex 9: old S8 (3,3)\nIndex 10: old S9 (3,4)\nIndex 11: old S10 (2,4)\nIndex 12: old S11 (1,4)\nIndex 13: old S12 (1,5)\nIndex 14: old S13 (2,5)\nIndex 15: old S14 (3,5)  -- and old S15 (4,5) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]  and tail is at (3,5).\n\nLength 16, same as before.\n\nNow, food: at (1,3), (1,5), (4,6)\n\n(1,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), etc. (1,5) is a body segment, index 12 in original, or after move, it's at index 13 in new positions? New positions: (1,4) at index 12, (1,5) at index 13, (2,5) at index 14, etc.\n\nBut food at (1,5) is on a body cell. Special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut for now, at turn 64, from (5,1), only possible move is R to (6,1), as other moves are invalid.\n\nThen on turn 65, from (6,1), head direction is R (since we moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,2), D to (6,0) invalid (wall), L to (5,1), but (5,1) is now a body segment, and moving left is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed. Cannot move opposite.\n\nSo only U or R? R to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, invalid. So only U to (6,2) is possible.\n\n(6,2): is it free? No snake or wall? Walls: x=7 wall, y=0,y=7, internal (5,2), so (6,2) should be free.\n\nSnake positions after turn 64: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) so (6,2) not occupied.\n\nNo food at (6,2), so move to (6,2) without eating.\n\nThen new positions: head to (6,2), body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and tail (3,5) removed? Similar to before.\n\nBut this seems like the snake is trapped or something. Let's look at the grid.\n\nGrid size: 6x6, from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nWalls: borders and internal (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's plot to see.\n\nRow y=1: (1,1) to (6,1): (1,1) not occupied? Snake has (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and after move to (6,1), so (1,1) free, (6,1) head.\n\ny=2: (1,2) not occupied, (2,2) occupied, (3,2) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (5,2) obstacle, (6,2) free.\n\ny=3: (1,3) food, (2,3) free? Snake has (4,3), (3,3), but not (2,3) or (1,3) except food, but food is there, not snake yet.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nList all occupied cells after turn 64 move:\n\n(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) has food, (1,6), (2,3), (3,3) is occupied, (3,3) is in list, (4,4) free, etc.\n\nBut from (6,1), after moving to (6,2), then on turn 66, from (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is body, and moving down is opposite to up? Current direction after moving up is U, so down would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nL to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,3) or possibly other if available.\n\n(6,3) free? Not occupied, no wall, so move to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, this forces the snake to go up along x=6.\n\nBut y=6 is wall, so when it reaches y=6, it might be a problem.\n\nBut there are food to eat, like at (1,3) with short life span.\n\nBut currently, from (5,1), I can only move to (6,1), no choice.\n\nBut is that true? Earlier I thought U to (5,2) is obstacle, D wall, L not allowed, so only R.\n\nBut let's double-check the snake positions and obstacles.\n\nCurrent turn 64, head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U: (5,2) - internal obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (5,0) - y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (4,1) - occupied by snake body (second segment), and also opposite direction, so invalid for both reasons.\n\n- R: (6,1) - free, so only possible move.\n\nSo for turn 64, I must move R to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 65, from (6,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (6,2) - free, as above\n\n- D: (6,0) - wall, invalid\n\n- L: (5,1) - occupied by body (now the first body segment), and opposite direction, invalid\n\n- R: (7,1) - x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only U to (6,2) possible.\n\nThen turn 66, from (6,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (6,3) - free\n\n- D: (6,1) - occupied by body, and opposite direction, invalid\n\n- L: (5,2) - obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: (7,2) - wall, invalid\n\nOnly U to (6,3).\n\nTurn 67, from (6,3), direction U.\n\nSimilarly, only U to (6,4) possible, since D opposite and invalid, L to (5,3) might be free, but current direction U, so L and R are not opposite, but let's see.\n\nFrom (6,3), dir U:\n\n- U: (6,4)\n\n- D: (6,2) - body, opposite, invalid\n\n- L: (5,3) - is it free? No snake? Snake positions: after previous moves, let's track.\n\nAfter turn 64: positions as above, (6,1), (5,1), etc.\n\nAfter turn 65 move to (6,2): head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and tail (3,5) removed, so positions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)\n\n(3,5) was removed, so (2,5) is tail.\n\nAfter turn 66 move to (6,3): head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) and tail (2,5) removed, so positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] tail at (1,5)\n\nNow at turn 67, from (6,3), dir U.\n\nPossible moves:\n- U to (6,4)\n- D to (6,2) - occupied by body, and opposite direction, invalid\n- L to (5,3) - free? No snake, no wall, not obstacle, so possible\n- R to (7,3) wall, invalid\n\nL to (5,3) is not opposite to U, since U is vertical, L is horizontal, so not opposite. Opposite would be D for U, L for R, etc.\n\nSo from U, moving L or R is allowed, as long as not D.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,4) or L to (5,3)\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) might be free.\n\nCurrent positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo (5,3) not occupied, and no wall, obstacle only at (5,2), so (5,3) free.\n\nAlso, food at (4,6) which is on the grid.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,3) with life span 2 at turn 64.\n\nAt turn 64, life span 2, so after turn 64, it decreases to 1, available on turn 65. After turn 65, decreases to 0, gone.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 65 only, since on turn 64 it's under snake body or not accessible.\n\nAt turn 64, food at (1,3) is not occupied by snake? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3). (1,3) has food, so it's free to move to, but not adjacent yet.\n\nBut from current position (5,1), I can't reach it in one move, and I have to move to (6,1) first.\n\nOn turn 65, from (6,1), I can only move to (6,2), not towards (1,3).\n\nSo I can't eat (1,3) because it will disappear after turn 65, and I'm far away.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,5) with life span 7, so available until turn 70 or so.\n\nFood at (4,6) life span 10, available longer.\n\nBut snake is at (6,1) on turn 65, then (6,2), etc.\n\nBack to turn 67, from (6,3), I can choose to go L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), then I might be forced up to (6,5), (6,6), but y=6 is wall, so at (6,6), I can only move down or left/right, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nAlso, there's the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut for now, let's list the food:\n\n- (1,3): value 1, life span 2 at t64, so must be eaten by t65, but I can't reach it, so it will disappear. Sad, but unavoidable.\n\n- (1,5): value 1, life span 7 at t64, so available from t64 to t70? At t64, life span 2 for (1,3) means available t64 and t65, similarly for (1,5) life span 7, available t64 to t70, since after t70 it disappears.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at t64, life span N, it can be eaten on turns from t64 to t64 + N - 1, and disappears at turn t64 + N.\n\nFor (1,3): life span 2 at t64, available t64 and t65, gone at t66.\n\nFor (1,5): life span 7, available t64 to t70, gone at t71.\n\nFor (4,6): life span 10, available t64 to t73, gone at t74.\n\nSince I can't eat (1,3), focus on other food.\n\nNow, from current, I must move R to (6,1) at t64.\n\nThen t65, move U to (6,2).\n\nThen at t66, from (6,2), move U to (6,3).\n\nThen at t67, from (6,3), dir U, I can choose U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\nIf I go to (5,3), then from there, I can go to other places.\n\n(5,3) is free, as we said.\n\nAlso, food at (4,6) is at (4,6), which is on the grid.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is at (1,5), which is currently occupied by the snake, but it will move.\n\nAt t66, after moving to (6,3), positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] so (1,5) is the tail.\n\nTail at (1,5) with food? Food at (1,5) is there, and it's under the tail.\n\nBut to eat it, the body must move away and head move onto it.\n\nCurrently at t66, tail is at (1,5), which has food.\n\nIf the snake moves such that the tail moves away, and then head moves to (1,5), it can be eaten.\n\nBut the head is at (6,3), far away, so it might take many turns.\n\nLife span is 7, so up to t70, so possible if I go back.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, at t64: only choice, move R to (6,1)\n\nt65: move U to (6,2)\n\nt66: move U to (6,3)\n\nt67: from (6,3), dir U, I can go L to (5,3) or U to (6,4)\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), then t68 from (6,4), dir U, similarly can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut if I go up to (6,6), at (6,6), dir U, but y=6 is wall, so U to (6,7) invalid, D to (6,5) but opposite if dir U, so not allowed, L to (5,6) or R invalid, so only L or possibly D but D opposite.\n\nFrom (6,6) with dir U, possible moves: L to (5,6), R invalid, U invalid, D to (6,5) but opposite, invalid. So only L to (5,6) possible.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut there's food at (4,6), which is near.\n\n(4,6) is food, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) food.\n\nBut let's think about survival and scoring.\n\nAlso, the snake is filling the left part, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,4) at t67, then t68 to (6,5), t69 to (6,6), t70 to (5,6) since only choice.\n\nThen from (5,6), dir L (since moved left from (6,6) to (5,6), so dir L.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,7) invalid, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), or R to (6,6) but (6,6) is body or something.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), positions: let's not track all, but (4,6) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut first, at t67, if I go to (5,3) instead, I can go towards the center.\n\nLet's consider the two choices at t67.\n\nOption 1: move U to (6,4) at t67\n\nThen t68 from (6,4) dir U, can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4) or D but D opposite invalid.\n\nU to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf U to (6,5), then t69 to (6,6), then t70 to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6) dir L, can go D to (5,5), L to (4,6), or U invalid, R to (6,6) body.\n\n(4,6) has food, so I can go L to (4,6) and eat it.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut let's see the path to (1,5) food.\n\n(1,5) is currently tail, but as snake moves, tail moves.\n\nAt t64, tail is at (4,5) or after moves, it changes.\n\nTo eat the food at (1,5), which is under the snake body at t64, but at later turns, it might be free.\n\nFor example, at t66, after moving to (6,3), tail is at (1,5), which has food. If the snake moves away from (1,5), the cell becomes free with food, then head can move to it.\n\nBut head is at (6,3), (1,5) is at distance.\n\nManhattan distance |6-1| + |3-5| = 5+2=7, so at least 7 moves away, but with turns, it might take more.\n\nLife span: available until t70, so from t67, I have 4 turns to eat it: t67,68,69,70.\n\nAt t67, head at (6,3), target (1,5), distance 5+2=7, but I can move diagonally in a way, but not really, since only one move per turn.\n\nMinimum moves: 5 right or left, 2 up or down, total 7 moves, but I need to go west and north, but (6,3) to (1,5) is left 5, up 2, so 7 moves.\n\nBut from t67 to t70 is 4 turns, not enough, t67,68,69,70 is 4 actions, but 7 moves needed, so impossible to reach by t70. t67 is turn 67, action on t67 to move, so positions change after move.\n\nAt start of t67, head at (6,3), after move, to e.g. (5,3) or (6,4).\n\nTo reach (1,5) by eating on some turn.\n\nEarliest possible eating turn: if I go directly, but with obstacles, it might take more than 4 moves, and t70 is the last chance, but from t67 to t70, I can make 4 moves, not enough for 7 cells. So I cannot eat (1,5) food; it will disappear unused.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) already gone.\n\nSo only food left is (4,6), which I can eat.\n\nAt (4,6), life span 10, so I have time.\n\nNow, at t67, from (6,3), I can go L to (5,3) or U to (6,4).\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), as above, I go to (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), then to (4,6) to eat.\n\nIf I go L to (5,3) at t67, then from (5,3), dir L (since moved left from (6,3)? From (6,3) to (5,3) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen t68 from (5,3), dir L, possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, and R is opposite to L? Current dir L, moving R is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (5,4) or L to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is occupied by snake? At t67 after move to (5,3), positions: let's simulate.\n\nAt t66, after move to (6,3): positions [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nThen t67 move L to (5,3): new head (5,3), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) and tail (1,5) removed since no eat. (4,3) is in body, but we move to (5,3), which was free? (5,3) was not occupied, yes.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) and (1,5) removed, so tail at (1,4).\n\n(4,3) is at index 11, occupied.\n\nNow at (5,3), dir L.\n\nt68 possible moves:\n- U to (5,4)\n- D to (5,2) obstacle, invalid\n- L to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by body (index 11 in new list? Positions: index 0: (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), 8: (2,2), 9: (3,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,4), 14: (2,4), 15: (1,4) so (4,3) is index 11, occupied.\n- R to (6,3) which is body, index 1, and R is opposite to L, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (5,4) possible? (5,4) is free? Not occupied, no wall, no obstacle.\n\n(5,4) free, so move U to (5,4).\n\nThen dir U.\n\nThen t69 from (5,4), dir U, can go U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but opposite invalid, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) free? Snake has (3,4), (4,3), but not (4,4), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (6,4) free.\n\nSo I can go U, L, or R.\n\nBut to reach food at (4,6), I should go up.\n\nIf U to (5,5), then t70 to (5,6), t71 to (4,6) or something.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's not plan all.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, but for the answer, I need to output actions from t64 onwards.\n\nBut at t64, only one choice: R.\n\nt65: only U.\n\nt66: only U.\n\nt67: I have a choice, U or L.\n\nIf I go U, I can reach (4,6) faster.\n\nIf I go L, I go to (5,3), then (5,4), etc., which might take longer to reach food.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when the tail has food, and head is adjacent, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, (1,5) has food, but tail is there, but head is far, so not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving, the tail changes.\n\nBut at some point, if head is near the tail with food.\n\nBut currently, not an issue.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the food at (4,6).\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so more body to manage.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nNow, for the answer format, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the next few turns, I think.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions starting from t64 for a few turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think ahead, I should output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut at the beginning, some turns have only one choice.\n\nt64: must move R\n\nt65: must move U\n\nt66: must move U\n\nThen at t67, I can choose.\n\nIf I move U at t67 to (6,4), then t68 from (6,4) dir U, can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), then t69 to (6,6), t70 to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6) to (4,6) to eat.\n\nBut at t70, food at (1,5) is gone, but we can't eat it anyway.\n\nIf at t67 I move L to (5,3), then t68 to (5,4), then from (5,4) I can go to (5,5), (5,6), then to (4,6), but slower.\n\nFor example, t67: L to (5,3)\n\nt68: U to (5,4)\n\nt69: from (5,4) dir U, can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or R to (6,4)\n\nSay go U to (5,5)\n\nt70: from (5,5) dir U, can go U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nThen go U to (5,6)\n\nt71: from (5,6) dir U, but y=6, U invalid, so can go D to (5,5) opposite if dir U, invalid, L to (4,6), R to (6,6) or other.\n\nIf dir U, moving L to (4,6) or R to (6,6), or D invalid.\n\nGo L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nCompared to the first path: if I go U at t67, t67: (6,4), t68: say U to (6,5), t69: U to (6,6), t70: L to (5,6), then t71: L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nIf I go L at t67, t67: (5,3), t68: (5,4), t69: (5,5), t70: (5,6), t71: (4,6) eat, same time or later.\n\nt67 action: if U to (6,4), then at t68 I can go to (6,5) or (5,4)\n\nIf go to (5,4) at t68, then to (5,5), etc., might be slower.\n\nBut to eat at (4,6), the fastest is to go up the right side.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I need to have space.\n\nBut for now, since I must output actions, and at t67 I have a choice, I should choose the path that allows me to eat the food sooner or safer.\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat around t71.\n\nAnother point: when I eat at (4,6), the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (5,2), it might block some paths.\n\nBut in this case, not critical.\n\nFor the sequence, since t64 to t66 are fixed, I only need to decide t67 and beyond.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output from t64.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,5), since I can't eat it, ignore.\n\nSo I think for t67, moving U to (6,4) is better to reach the food area faster.\n\nThen I can go to (4,6).\n\nAfter eating, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut the grid might have limited space.\n\nLet's estimate free cells.\n\nGrid 6x6=36 cells.\n\nSnake 16 cells.\n\nWalls: borders, but borders are not cells, the playable cells are 36, with one internal obstacle at (5,2), so 35 cells available, snake 16, so 19 free cells.\n\nAfter growth, 17, etc.\n\nBut with obstacles, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the top-right area.\n\nAfter reaching (5,6), I move to (4,6), eat, then snake grows, so positions include (4,6) as new head, and tail stays.\n\nThen from there, I can move.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor the answer, I should output the sequence for about 5 turns.\n\nSince t67 has a choice, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I should include t67 action.\n\nIn the context, moving U at t67 might be better.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat the food earlier.\n\nAt t67, if I go U to (6,4), then t68 from (6,4) dir U, I can go L to (5,4) instead of U, to go towards (4,6) directly.\n\nFor example:\n\nt67: U to (6,4)\n\nt68: L to (5,4)  // since dir U, moving L is allowed\n\nThen at (5,4), dir L (since moved left).\n\nt69 from (5,4) dir L, can go U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) may be free or not, but (5,2) obstacle, D to (5,3) if free, or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5), then t70 U to (5,6), t71 L to (4,6)\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (5,4), go L to (4,4), then U to (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied later.\n\nAt t68, after moving to (5,4), positions depend.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nSince time is limited, and for the purpose, I'll choose to go up at t67.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U  // to (6,4)\n\nThen for t68, from (6,4) dir U, I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), then t69 U to (6,6), t70 L to (5,6)\n\nThen t71 L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output only a few turns, or up to when I have choices.\n\nThe answer format is to output for the current and next few turns, but it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I think for as many as I want, but probably 3-5 turns.\n\nSince t64 to t66 are fixed, and t67 I choose U, then t68 I can choose, but to be consistent, I'll output up to t67 or t68.\n\nBut let's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence that includes the choice.\n\nFor survival, going to (5,3) at t67 might open more space, but going up is fine.\n\nI think either is ok, but I'll go with U for t67.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nThen for t68, it's not specified, but I can stop here or add more.\n\nSince the state is given for t64, I need to output from t64 onwards for the immediate actions.\n\nBut the format says to output multiple turns.\n\nIn the example, it might be implied to output for the turns where decisions are made.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll output for t64 to t67.\n\nThen the AI can continue.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nBut at t67, moving U to (6,4) is valid.\n\nPerhaps I should think about eating the food.\n\nAnother idea: at t67, if I move L to (5,3), then I can go down or left, but down is blocked by obstacle.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can only go up, to (5,4), etc., same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think U is fine.\n\nFor the food at (4,6), with life span 10, I have until t73 to eat, so no rush.\n\nBut to score, I should eat it when possible.\n\nIn the sequence, by going up, I can eat around t71.\n\nBut for the output, I think the sequence is ok.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 64 and Beyond\n\n**Current State (Turn 64):**\n- **Grid**: 7x7 playable area (cells (1,1) to (6,6)), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,1), direction right (R). Positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] (length 16).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,3): Value +1, life span 2 (available until turn 65; disappears after turn 65).\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 7 (available until turn 70; disappears after turn 70).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 73; disappears after turn 73).\n\n**Key Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Movement Restrictions**: \n  - Current direction is R, so left (L) is an instant reverse and invalid.\n  - From (5,1): \n    - Up (U) to (5,2) is blocked by internal obstacle.\n    - Down (D) to (5,0) is a wall (y=0).\n    - Left (L) to (4,1) is invalid (opposite direction and occupied by body).\n    - Right (R) to (6,1) is valid (free cell).\n- **Food Accessibility**:\n  - (1,3): Cannot be reached by turn 65 due to distance (Manhattan distance from head is 4+2=6 moves, but only 2 turns left). It will disappear unused.\n  - (1,5): Occupied by the snake's tail; to eat it, the tail must move away and head move onto it. However, head is at (6,3) by turn 67, with a Manhattan distance of 5+2=7 to (1,5). With only 4 turns (t67–t70) to reach it, it is impossible. This food will also disappear unused.\n  - (4,6): Primary target. Available until turn 73, so it can be eaten safely around turn 71 with a planned path.\n- **Survival Priority**: \n  - Avoid dead ends (e.g., top-right corner at (6,6) is risky due to walls). \n  - Plan 5+ turns ahead to reach (4,6) while maintaining mobility.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not an immediate threat, as the head is not adjacent to the tail with food.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 Turns Ahead):**\n1. **Turn 64**: Only valid move is R to (6,1) (no other options).\n2. **Turn 65**: From (6,1), direction R. Only valid move is U to (6,2) (D to wall, L opposite/invalid, R to wall).\n3. **Turn 66**: From (6,2), direction U. Only valid move is U to (6,3) (D opposite/invalid, L to obstacle, R to wall).\n4. **Turn 67**: From (6,3), direction U. Choices:\n   - U to (6,4): Advances toward top-right, allowing a path to (4,6).\n   - L to (5,3): Safer for long-term exploration but delays reaching (4,6).\n   - **Decision**: Move U to (6,4) to prioritize reaching (4,6) faster (eating by ~turn 71). This avoids the left-side clutter and uses the right-side path, which is more open.\n5. **Turn 68**: From (6,4), direction U. Choices:\n   - U to (6,5): Continues upward.\n   - L to (5,4): Starts moving left toward (4,6).\n   - **Decision**: Move U to (6,5) to maintain momentum toward the top, setting up for a left turn to (5,6) and then (4,6).\n\n**Path to Food (4,6):**\n- By turn 67 (U to (6,4)), the head is closer to (4,6) (distance 2+2=4 moves).\n- Turn 68 (U to (6,5)) reduces distance to 1+1=2.\n- Turn 69: From (6,5), move U to (6,6) (only option besides L, but L to (5,5) is less direct).\n- Turn 70: From (6,6), move L to (5,6) (only option).\n- Turn 71: From (5,6), move L to (4,6) to eat the food (snake grows to length 17).\n\n**Long-Term Survival:**  \nAfter eating (4,6), the snake can explore the top-left area (e.g., (3,6), (2,6), etc.) or head downward, avoiding the obstacle at (5,2). With 19 free cells initially (35 cells minus 16 snake, minus 1 obstacle), and growth to 17, there is ample space for maneuvering. Risks are low if the snake avoids tight corners and plans turns in advance.\n\n**Answer Sequence (Turns 64–68):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 65: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 66: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 67: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 68: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nCurrent turn is 65.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (6,1), then body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). Let me count these to know the length.\n\nList: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). That's 16 positions, so snake length is 16. Since eating positive food increases length by 1, and negative food doesn't change it.\n\nSnake head direction is R, meaning right, so it's moving east, towards increasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life_span 1. So this food disappears after this turn if not eaten. Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 65, if not eaten, it's gone.\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life_span 6. Value is +1, so positive food.\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life_span 9. Also positive.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so (1,1) to (6,6) is playable, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (6,1), direction R. So from (6,1), moving right would go to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so it can't move right. Walls are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (7,1) is out of bounds, collision.\n\nSimilarly, up: (6,2), down: (6,0) which is y=0, wall, left: (5,1).\n\nBut (5,1) is occupied by the second segment of the snake.\n\nSnake body: positions are given in order, head first. So head (6,1), then (5,1), which is the neck, then (4,1), and so on.\n\nSince head is moving right, but can't because wall, so it must change direction.\n\nPossible moves from (6,1):\n\n- Up: to (6,2)\n\n- Down: to (6,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid\n\n- Left: to (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied by the body\n\n- Right: to (7,1) wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is up to (6,2)? But is (6,2) free?\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n\n(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\n(6,2) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless it's a wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2). (6,2) is within bounds, not obstacle, so yes, (6,2) is free.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so (6,2) is valid.\n\nAlso, food at (1,3), (1,5), (4,6).\n\n(1,5) has food, but (1,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (1,5), which is the 14th segment? Positions: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (2,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (3,4), 11: (2,4), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (3,5)\n\nSo (1,5) is occupied by the snake body, segment at index 13.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is index 12, also snake.\n\nNow food at (1,5): but (1,5) is occupied, so how can food be there? Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,3), which might be free or not.\n\nList all snake positions to see which cells are occupied.\n\nSnake cells:\n\n- Row y=1: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\n- (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\n- (4,3), (3,3)\n\n- (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\n- (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nNo snake at (1,3), (4,6), etc.\n\n(1,3) is free? Let's see: x=1,y=3. Is it occupied? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3). Similarly, (4,6) not listed.\n\nFood: (1,3,1,1), (1,5,6,1) but (1,5) has food, but snake is on (1,5), so food is under the body.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is occupied, but food is there with life_span 6.\n\n(4,6) food is at (4,6), which is not occupied by snake, so it's free.\n\n(1,3) is also free, I think.\n\nSnake positions don't include (1,3), so (1,3) should be free for food.\n\nNow, for turn 65, head at (6,1), direction R, but can't move R or D (wall), can't move L to (5,1) occupied, so only possible move is U to (6,2).\n\nIs (6,2) occupied? Snake positions: (6,2) not listed, and not wall, so yes, free.\n\nBut let's confirm: snake has (6,1), (5,1), etc., no (6,2). Walls: (6,2) is not border or obstacle, so yes.\n\nSo on turn 65, must move U to (6,2).\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, starting from turn 65.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn 65, 66, 67, etc., up to at least turn 70 or so, since think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nBut I need to plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, current move for turn 65: only choice is U to (6,2).\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves, so head to (6,2), and tail moves forward, so the last segment (3,5) will be removed? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail end is removed, unless it eats food.\n\nSince no food eaten in this move, tail is removed.\n\nCurrent positions: head (6,1), after move U to (6,2), new head (6,2), then the body segments follow: the first body segment was at (5,1), but since head moved, the neck becomes (5,1), but actually, the snake shifts: new head (6,2), then previous head (6,1) becomes neck, then (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to the second last segment, and the tail (3,5) is removed.\n\nLet's list the positions after move.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) ]\n\nAfter moving U to (6,2): new positions: head to (6,2), then the rest: (6,1) becomes first body, then (5,1), (4,1), ..., down to (1,5), and (2,5) becomes the new second last, but (3,5) is removed? The snake has 16 segments, after moving without eating, length same, so tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]\n\n(3,5) was the last, removed, so (2,5) is now the last segment.\n\nNow, head at (6,2), direction was R, but now moved U, so new direction is U.\n\nFood: (1,3) has life_span 1, so if not eaten on turn 65, it disappears after turn 65. Since we moved to (6,2), not eating it, so it's gone.\n\n(1,5) food is under snake body, at (1,5), which is still occupied by snake? After move, (1,5) is still there, position index 14? New positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), ..., (1,4) at index 13, (1,5) at index 14, (2,5) at index 15.\n\n(1,5) has food, and snake is on it, so food is under body, not eaten yet.\n\n(4,6) food at (4,6), life_span 9.\n\nNow turn 66, head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,2)\n\n- U: to (6,3)\n\n- D: to (6,1), but (6,1) is now occupied by the second segment (neck)\n\n- L: to (5,2), but (5,2) is internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles [(5,2)], so (5,2) is wall, invalid\n\n- R: to (7,2) wall, invalid\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,3) or D to (6,1)\n\nBut D to (6,1) is occupied by body, so collision, cannot.\n\n(6,1) is occupied, so moving there would be body collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is U to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is free? Snake positions: no (6,3), not wall, so yes.\n\nSo turn 66, move U to (6,3).\n\nThen new positions: head to (6,3), then [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] but tail (2,5) removed? After move, no eat, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ]\n\n(2,5) was last, removed.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nFood: (1,5) still under body at (1,5), life_span now 5? Turn 65 was initial, after turn 65, life_span decreases by 1 for each turn.\n\nFood life_span: at turn 65, (1,3) life_span 1, but after turn 65, if not eaten, gone. (1,5) life_span 6 at turn 65, so after turn 65, it becomes 5, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life_span 9 at turn 65, after turn 65, 8, etc.\n\nNow turn 67, head at (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4)\n\n- D to (6,2) but occupied by body (second segment)\n\n- L to (5,3)\n\n- R to (7,3) wall, invalid\n\nL to (5,3): is (5,3) free? Snake positions: no (5,3), not wall, obstacle at (5,2), but (5,3) is different.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,4) or L to (5,3)\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (1,5) under body, but to eat it, the body must move away, then head move there.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) is occupied by the tail segment? After turn 67 move, let's see.\n\nFirst, for turn 67, I have a choice.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (1,3) is gone, (1,5) has food under body at (1,5), which is the last segment in the list, but it will move.\n\n(4,6) food at (4,6).\n\nNow, the snake is at (6,3), and I want to maximize score, so eat positive food.\n\nBut (1,5) is far, and (4,6) is closer? (4,6) is at (4,6), snake head at (6,3), so not adjacent.\n\nAlso, there might be a risk with (1,5) because of tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail is moving.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nFirst, from (6,3), I can go U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\nIf I go L to (5,3), then head to (5,3).\n\nThen possible next moves.\n\nBut (5,3) is adjacent to (4,3), which is snake body? Snake positions: after turn 66, positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo (4,3) is at index 10, (3,3) at 11, etc.\n\n(5,3) is not occupied, so moving L to (5,3) is fine.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), new head (5,3), then body: (6,3), (6,2), etc., tail (1,5) removed? No eat, so tail removed, new positions: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]\n\n(1,5) was last, removed, so (1,4) is new tail.\n\nFood at (1,5) was under (1,5), but since tail moved, (1,5) is now free, and food is still there? When tail moves away, the cell becomes free, and food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut head is at (5,3), far away.\n\nLife_span of (1,5) food: at turn 65, life_span 6, so after turn 65, 5; after turn 66, 4; after turn 67, 3, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life_span 9 at t65, after t65:8, t66:7, t67:6, etc.\n\nNow, from (5,3), head position.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid, L to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body (index 11 in new list? New positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo (4,3) is at index 11, which is body, so moving L to (4,3) would be collision.\n\nR to (6,3) but (6,3) is occupied by neck, collision.\n\nU to (5,4) or D to (5,2) invalid, so only U to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo from (5,3), only move U to (5,4).\n\nThen similarly, continue.\n\nBut I need to think about eating food.\n\nPerhaps I should go towards (4,6) food.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), snake head at (6,3), so to reach (4,6), need to go left and up.\n\nFrom (6,3), if I go U to (6,4), then to (6,5), (6,6), but (6,6) might be corner, then need to go left.\n\n(6,6) is not wall, walls are at x=7,y=7, so (6,6) is playable.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, for turn 67, from (6,3), I have two choices: U or L.\n\nIf U to (6,4), then head at (6,4).\n\nPossible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5), D to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall invalid.\n\nSo U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nIf I go L to (5,3) at turn 67, then as before, only U to (5,4) at turn 68.\n\nLet's list the sequence from turn 65.\n\nTurn 65: must move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 66: must move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 67: at (6,3), can move U or L.\n\nCase 1: move U to (6,4) on turn 67.\n\nThen positions: head to (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., down to (1,4), tail (1,5) removed, new tail (1,4)? After move from (6,3) to (6,4), no eat, so tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions before turn 67 move: head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nAfter move U to (6,4), new head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)  and (1,5) removed.\n\nTail was (1,5), removed, so new tail (1,4).\n\nFood at (1,5) is now exposed, since body moved away, so (1,5) has food, and it's free now.\n\nBut head is at (6,4), far.\n\nLife_span of (1,5) was 6 at t65, after t65:5, t66:4, after turn 66, before turn 67, life_span 4? Let's track food life.\n\nAt turn 65:\n\n- (1,3): life_span 1, not eaten, disappears after turn 65\n\n- (1,5): life_span 6\n\n- (4,6): life_span 9\n\nAfter turn 65 (after move):\n\n- (1,3) gone\n\n- (1,5): life_span 5 (decreased by 1)\n\n- (4,6): life_span 8\n\nAfter turn 66 (after move to (6,3)):\n\n- (1,5): life_span 4\n\n- (4,6): life_span 7\n\nAfter turn 67 (after move to (6,4)):\n\n- (1,5): life_span 3\n\n- (4,6): life_span 6\n\nAnd (1,5) is now free, since tail moved away.\n\nBut head at (6,4), to reach (1,5) it's far, and life_span 3, so only 3 turns left to eat it, but from (6,4) to (1,5) is at least 5 moves away? |6-1|=5 in x, |4-5|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, so cannot reach in 3 turns. Thus, (1,5) food will disappear before we can eat it, so not worth going for.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) at (4,6), life_span after turn 67 is 6, head at (6,4), distance |6-4|=2 in x, |4-6|=2 in y, Manhattan 4, so can reach in 4 turns, and life_span 6 more turns, so possible to eat it.\n\nBut need to path safely.\n\nNow back to turn 67 choice.\n\nFrom (6,3), if I move L to (5,3) instead.\n\nThen on turn 67, move L to (5,3).\n\nPositions after: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)  and tail (1,5) removed.\n\n(1,5) food is now free, life_span 3 after this turn? After turn 67 move.\n\nBefore turn 67 move, after turn 66, (1,5) life_span 4.\n\nAfter turn 67 move, life_span decreases to 3.\n\nHead at (5,3), to reach (1,5), distance |5-1|=4, |3-5|=2, Manhattan 6, cannot in 3 turns, so still not reachable.\n\nSo (1,5) food is not achievable, ignore it.\n\nFocus on (4,6) food.\n\n(4,6) at (4,6), life_span after turn 67 will be 6 or 7? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 65 start: food life_span\n\n- (1,3): 1, gone after turn 65\n\n- (1,5): 6\n\n- (4,6): 9\n\nAfter turn 65 (after action): life_span decreases, so (1,5):5, (4,6):8\n\nAfter turn 66: (1,5):4, (4,6):7\n\nAfter turn 67: (1,5):3, (4,6):6\n\nAnd (1,5) may be free or not, but not reachable.\n\nFor (4,6), life_span 6 after turn 67, meaning it will disappear after turn 67 + 6 = turn 73.\n\nHead at turn 67 is at (6,3) or (6,4) or (5,3), depending on choice.\n\nFirst, let's assume on turn 67 I move U to (6,4) to go towards (4,6).\n\nSo from (6,4), turn 67.\n\nThen turn 68: from (6,4), possible moves U to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is free? After positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), etc., no (5,4), so free.\n\nI can go L to (5,4) to get closer to (4,6).\n\n|6-4|=2, |4-6|=2, to (4,6) from (6,4), need to decrease x and increase y.\n\nSo moving L to (5,4) decreases x, same y.\n\nOr U to (6,5) same x, increase y.\n\nThen from (5,4) or (6,5), continue.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4) on turn 67, positions: as before, [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nTurn 68: from (6,4), move L to (5,4) or U to (6,5).\n\nSay move L to (5,4).\n\nThen new head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,3), ..., tail (1,4) removed, new positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\n(1,4) removed.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction from (6,4) to (5,4) is L, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,4)\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) occupied by neck.\n\nR is invalid.\n\nD to (5,3): is (5,3) free? Not in positions, so free.\n\nU to (5,5) free? Probably.\n\nL to (4,4) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo all U, D, L possible except R.\n\nTo reach (4,6), from (5,4), need to go up and left, so U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, so need to go up.\n\nFrom (5,4), U to (5,5) is good.\n\nThen to (5,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nMove U to (5,5) on turn 68? Turn 68 is from (6,4) to (5,4), turn 69 from (5,4).\n\nTurn 69: head at (5,4), move U to (5,5).\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), etc., tail removed, new tail (2,4) or something.\n\nPrevious positions before turn 69: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\nAfter move U to (5,5), new head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (3,4), (2,4) and last was (2,4)? Positions: index 0: (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: (2,1), 9: (2,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (4,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (3,4), 15: (2,4)\n\nAfter move, new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) and (2,4) removed.\n\nNew tail (3,4).\n\nHead at (5,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) occupied, L to (4,5), R to (6,5) or to (5,6) but (5,6) free? Not occupied.\n\nU to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nAll possible except D.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,5), moving U to (5,6) or L to (4,5) both get closer.\n\n(5,6) is adjacent to (4,6)? (5,6) and (4,6) are adjacent horizontally.\n\n|5-4|=1, |6-6|=0.\n\nSo from (5,5), to (4,6), can go directly if possible.\n\nBut (4,6) is the target.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move U to (5,6), then at (5,6), next move to (4,6) or (5,7) invalid, or (6,6), etc.\n\nMove L to (4,5), then to (4,6).\n\n(4,5) might be occupied? Not in current positions.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (5,5), body (5,4), etc., no (4,5).\n\nSo (4,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) free.\n\nTo eat (4,6), from (5,5), I can move directly to (4,6) if I go L and U, but must move one step.\n\nMoves are U, D, L, R, not diagonal.\n\nSo from (5,5), to reach (4,6), need to move to (4,5) or (5,6) first, then to (4,6).\n\nSay on turn 69, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen head to (4,5), then on turn 70, move U to (4,6) to eat food.\n\n(4,6) has food, so eating it, length increases.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (5,6) on turn 69, then turn 70 move L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nEither way.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nFirst, let's continue the sequence.\n\nFrom turn 67: at (6,3), move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 68: at (6,4), move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: at (5,4), move U to (5,5)? Earlier I said from (5,4) to (5,5), but (5,4) to (5,5) is U.\n\nIn turn 69, from (5,4) to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 70: at (5,5), now move to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is adjacent: left and up? (4,6) is (x=4,y=6), (5,5) is (5,5), so to move to (4,6), it's not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (5,5); |4-5|=1, |6-5|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so horizontal or vertical neighbor.\n\nSo from (5,5), cannot move directly to (4,6); must move to (4,5) or (5,6) first.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), (5,6) at (5,6).\n\nNow, (4,5) might be free, let's see.\n\nIn positions, after turn 69: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), etc., no (4,5), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) free.\n\nSo on turn 70, from (5,5), move L to (4,5) or U to (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 71, from there move to (4,6).\n\nFor example, if move L to (4,5) on turn 70, then turn 71 move U to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is food, so eating on turn 71.\n\nLife_span of (4,6): after turn 67, life_span 6, so disappears after turn 73? Life_span decreases each turn, so after turn 67:6, after turn 68:5, turn 69:4, turn 70:3, turn 71:2, so on turn 71, if eaten, it's there.\n\nTurn 71 is within life_span.\n\nNow, from the beginning.\n\nTurn 65: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 66: move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 67: move U to (6,4)\n\nNow turn 68: from (6,4), I could move U to (6,5) instead of L to (5,4).\n\nIf U to (6,5), then head at (6,5).\n\nThen turn 69: from (6,5), possible moves U to (6,6), D to (6,4) occupied, L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\nU to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nThen to reach (4,6), from (6,5) or (6,6).\n\nIf to (6,6), then from (6,6) to (5,6) to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is corner, might be risky.\n\nBetter to go left earlier.\n\nOn turn 67, if I moved L to (5,3) instead.\n\nTurn 67: from (6,3) move L to (5,3)\n\nThen positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)  tail (1,5) removed, but (1,5) gone.\n\nHead at (5,3), only move U to (5,4) as before.\n\nTurn 68: move U to (5,4)\n\nThen same as before, at (5,4) on turn 68.\n\nThen turn 69: from (5,4) to (5,5) or to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo (5,5) then to (4,5) or (5,6), then to (4,6).\n\nBut from (5,4), moving to (5,5) on turn 69.\n\nThen turn 70: at (5,5), move to (4,5) or (5,6).\n\nThen turn 71 to (4,6).\n\nSimilar timing.\n\nBut in the first path, with turn 67 U to (6,4), turn 68 L to (5,4), turn 69 U to (5,5), turn 70 L to (4,5), turn 71 U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nOn turn 71, move to (4,6) eats food.\n\nLife_span: after turn 67, (4,6) life_span 6, after turn 68:5, turn 69:4, turn 70:3, turn 71:2, so on turn 71, it is there, can eat.\n\nNow, when eating, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, length increases by 1.\n\nNow, after eating, need to think about survival.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but currently only one food left.\n\n(1,5) is not reachable.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), the snake is longer, and need to find space.\n\nBut first, let's output the actions.\n\nFor turn 65 to 71.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 65 action.\n\nAlso, for turn 67, I need to choose.\n\nIn the first choice, moving U on turn 67 might be better to avoid the obstacle at (5,2), but (5,2) is below, not in the way.\n\nFrom (6,3), moving L to (5,3) is closer to (4,6), but then from (5,3) I can only go up, to (5,4), etc.\n\n|6,3 to 4,6| dx=2, dy=3, Manhattan 5.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (4,6) dx=1, dy=3, Manhattan 4.\n\nSlightly closer, but not much difference.\n\nBut when moving L to (5,3) on turn 67, then turn 68 U to (5,4), then turn 69 from (5,4) to (5,5) or to (4,4).\n\nIf to (5,5) on turn 69, then turn 70 to (4,5) or (5,6), say (4,5), then turn 71 to (4,6).\n\nSame as before.\n\nTurn 67 move L to (5,3):\n\nAfter turn 67: head (5,3)\n\nTurn 68: move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: at (5,4), move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4)\n\nIf move U to (5,5) on turn 69\n\nThen turn 70: at (5,5), move L to (4,5)  // since (4,6) is up from (4,5)\n\n(4,5) to (4,6) is U.\n\nSo move to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nThen turn 71: move U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nNow, from turn 67 move U to (6,4):\n\nTurn 67: (6,4)\n\nTurn 68: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 70: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: move U to (4,6) eat\n\nIn both cases, eating on turn 71.\n\nBut with turn 67 L to (5,3), I reach (5,4) on turn 68, same as the other path reaches (5,4) on turn 68? In first path: turn 67 U to (6,4), turn 68 L to (5,4) — so (5,4) on turn 68.\n\nIn second path: turn 67 L to (5,3), turn 68 U to (5,4) — (5,4) on turn 68 same.\n\nThen turn 69 to (5,5), turn 70 to (4,5), turn 71 to (4,6).\n\nSo identical from turn 68 onwards.\n\nOnly turn 67 differs: either from (6,3) to (6,4) or to (5,3).\n\nNow, which is better?\n\nMoving to (6,4) might keep more space, but moving to (5,3) is closer to the left side.\n\nBut since the food is at (4,6), both are fine.\n\nI need to consider the body positions.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4) on turn 68, the body is trailing.\n\nFor example, in both cases, at turn 68, head at (5,4), body includes (6,4), (6,3), etc., and the tail is around (1,4) or (2,4), but moving.\n\nWhen I go to (4,5) and (4,6), I need to make sure not to collide.\n\nFor instance, on turn 70, moving to (4,5), is it safe?\n\nAt that time, positions before move.\n\nLet's simulate after eating.\n\nFirst, for turn 67, I can choose either, but since the head direction after turn 66 is U, moving U continues the direction, while L changes, but no restriction except no instant reverse.\n\nFrom (6,3), moving L to (5,3) is left, not opposite to U, so fine.\n\nI think both ok, but let's pick moving U to (6,4) for simplicity.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: from (6,4), move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: from (5,4), move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 70: from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, on turn 71, head moves to (4,6), which has food, so it eats, length increases, tail does not move.\n\nPositions before turn 71 move: head at (4,5), let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 70: when we move to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nBefore turn 70 move: after turn 69, positions.\n\nTurn 69: after moving to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)  tail (2,4) removed? After turn 69 move.\n\nTurn 68: after moving to (5,4), positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\nTurn 69: move U to (5,5), new head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (3,4), and (2,4) removed? Positions: index 0: (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: (2,1), 9: (2,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (4,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (3,4), 15: (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)  and (2,4) removed. New tail (3,4).\n\nNow turn 70: from (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, not occupied.\n\nNew head (4,5), then body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (3,3), (3,4) and tail (3,4) not removed? Since no eat yet.\n\nMoving to (4,5), no food there, so tail moves, (3,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)  and (3,4) removed. New tail (3,3).\n\nNow turn 71: move U to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has food, so eat, head moves to (4,6), and tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nPositions: new head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (4,3), (3,3) and tail (3,3) stays, new length 17.\n\nNow, after that, head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nNeed to move next, but since we are to output actions for several turns, up to say turn 71.\n\nBut think 5+ turns ahead, from turn 65.\n\nTurn 65 to 71 is 7 turns, enough.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 67, I have to specify the action.\n\nIn the second option, if on turn 67 I move L to (5,3), then:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L (to (5,3))\n\nThen turn 68: U (to (5,4))\n\nThen same as before, turn 69: U to (5,5), turn 70: L to (4,5), turn 71: U to (4,6)\n\nSo same from turn 68.\n\nNow, which turn 67 action is better?\n\nMoving to (5,3) on turn 67 might be slightly better because it avoids the right edge, but (6,4) is not edge yet.\n\nAlso, when at (6,3), moving L to (5,3) brings it closer to center.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nI think I should output the sequence.\n\nNow, about the food at (1,5), it's not reachable, so ignore.\n\nAfter eating, the snake is at (4,6), which is top-left, and need to find a safe path.\n\nFor example, from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (4,5) but after eating, (4,5) is the neck; L to (3,6) or R to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut we don't need to plan further for now.\n\nIn the answer, output actions from turn 65 to, say, turn 70 or 71.\n\nBut since eating on turn 71, include that.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 67, I need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps moving U is safer because moving L to (5,3) and then only U available, might lead to dead end, but not really.\n\n(5,3) to (5,4) is fine.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nBut let's see the initial direction: after turn 66, head at (6,3), direction U, so moving U continues direction, might be smoother.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI'll go with U for turn 67.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 69: U (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 70: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 71: U (to (4,6) eat)\n\nNow, output in boxed.\n\nThe format is Turn t: action\n\nStarting from turn 65.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 65: U  \nTurn 66: U  \nTurn 67: U  \nTurn 68: L  \nTurn 69: U  \nTurn 70: L  \nTurn 71: U\n\nBut think 5+ turns ahead, so this is 7 turns.\n\nPerhaps I can stop at turn 70, but turn 71 is the eat, so include.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 71, and we maximized score by eating it.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not an issue here, since no food near tail when eating.\n\nIn this case, fine.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 70, moving to (4,5), is it safe? Yes, as above.\n\nSimilarly, all moves should be valid.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key goals are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,6) with value +1 before it expires (life_span decreases to 0).\n- Avoid the unreachable food at (1,5) due to distance and low remaining life_span.\n- Steer the snake toward the food at (4,6) while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n- Ensure the path is safe and open for movement after eating to support long-term survival.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 65)\n- **Grid**: 7x7 playable area (x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (6,1) moving right (direction R), length 16. Body positions are dense in the bottom-left, but moving upward opens space.\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,3): Value +1, life_span 1. Disappears after this turn (not reachable from (6,1)).\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life_span 6. Occupied by snake body; freeing it requires the tail to move away, but it is too far to reach safely before expiration (distance ≈6 cells, life_span decreases to 3 by turn 67).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life_span 9. Reachable in ~4-5 turns with safe pathing; life_span decreases to 6 by turn 67, allowing consumption by turn 71.\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 65)**: From (6,1), only valid move is up (U) to (6,2) to avoid walls and body collision. Other moves are invalid:\n  - Right (R) to (7,1): Wall collision.\n  - Down (D) to (6,0): Wall collision.\n  - Left (L) to (5,1): Body collision (occupied by neck segment).\n\n### Path to Food at (4,6)\n- **Path Calculation**: From (6,3) at turn 67, the Manhattan distance to (4,6) is 3 (|6-4|=2, |3-6|=3, min path length 3). With (4,6) life_span 6 after turn 67, it can be reached by turn 71 (within 4 turns).\n- **Chosen Path**: \n  - Turn 65-67: Move up to (6,4) to avoid the obstacle at (5,2) and center the snake.\n  - Turn 68: Move left to (5,4) to decrease x-distance to food.\n  - Turn 69: Move up to (5,5) to decrease y-distance to food.\n  - Turn 70: Move left to (4,5) to position adjacent to food.\n  - Turn 71: Move up to (4,6) to eat food (+1 score, length increases to 17).\n- **Safety**: All moves avoid body collisions and walls. After eating, the snake is at (4,6) with direction up, allowing flexible moves (e.g., left to (3,6) or right to (5,6)) for future survival.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Turn 67 Choice**: Moving up (U) to (6,4) instead of left (L) to (5,3) keeps more space and avoids potential dead ends near (5,2). Both paths reach (5,4) by turn 68, but U is smoother with current upward direction.\n- **Food Prioritization**: (1,5) is ignored due to low life_span and high risk (tail reward danger if head approaches; not applicable here). (4,6) is the only viable target.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, the snake is in the top-left with open areas (e.g., left to column x=3 or down). The sequence avoids tight spaces and ensures the body doesn't encircle the head.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 65 to 71)\nThe snake eats the food at (4,6) on turn 71, increasing score by 1. Moves are valid (no instant reverses or collisions).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U  \nTurn 66: U  \nTurn 67: U  \nTurn 68: L  \nTurn 69: U  \nTurn 70: L  \nTurn 71: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 66. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but with (5,2) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,2), and the body segments follow. Since the head direction is U (up), that means it's moving upwards. The positions are:\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n\n- Body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nThe tail is at (2,5). Let me list all positions in order:\n\n1. (6,2) - head\n\n2. (6,1)\n\n3. (5,1)\n\n4. (4,1)\n\n5. (3,1)\n\n6. (2,1)\n\n7. (2,2)\n\n8. (3,2)\n\n9. (4,2)\n\n10. (4,3)\n\n11. (3,3)\n\n12. (3,4)\n\n13. (2,4)\n\n14. (1,4)\n\n15. (1,5)\n\n16. (2,5) - tail\n\nThe snake has 16 segments.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current, so for (1,5), it has 6 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 66 + 6 = 72? Let's see: life span is given as 6 at turn 66, so it decreases to 5 on turn 67, and so on, until 0 on turn 72, and it disappears. Similarly, (4,6) has life span 8, so disappears after turn 74.\n\nBut we're at turn 66, so for (1,5), life span 6 means it will be there for 6 more turns, including turn 66. After turn 66, it has 5 left, down to 0 on turn 72 when it disappears.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead. The answer should include actions for turn 66, 67, etc., but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence, but the output is for the immediate turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to decide how many to output. It doesn't specify, but since it's for playing, I should output the next action and perhaps a few, but the instruction is to think ahead to make good decisions.\n\nI should simulate possible moves for the next few turns to avoid risks and maximize score.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6), but (5,2) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSo accessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2).\n\nNow, snake occupies: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom positions:\n\n(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\n(4,2) is occupied, but (5,2) is wall, so not part of snake.\n\nFood is at (1,5) and (4,6).\n\n(1,5) has food, but (1,5) is also occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (1,5) as the 15th segment? Let's see the list:\n\nPositions: index 1: (6,2) head, 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (2,1), 7: (2,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (4,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (3,4), 13: (2,4), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,5), 16: (2,5)\n\nSo (1,5) is the 15th segment, which is not the tail; tail is (2,5). But there is food at (1,5). But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n\nCurrently, (1,5) has food and is occupied by a body segment. So to eat it, that segment must move away, and then the head must move to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6) is not occupied, I think. (4,6) is within bounds? y=6 is the top border? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, so (4,6) is at y=6, which is accessible since walls are at y=0 and y=7, meaning y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except for obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle only at (5,2), so (4,6) should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm snake positions: none at (4,6), so yes, food is there.\n\nNow, head is at (6,2), moving up. Direction U, so from (6,2), up would be to (6,3), since y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up.\n\nIn the state, walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 probably bottom, y=7 top, so U (y+1) is towards higher y, which is up.\n\nSimilarly, D (y-1) down.\n\nSo from (6,2), U would go to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all y-coordinates.\n\nPositions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (6,3) is not in the list, so free? But is it accessible? (6,3) is x=6,y=3, which is within 1-6, and not (5,2), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is free.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (6,2) with direction U.\n\nSince head direction is U, possible moves: not opposite, so cannot go D (down), which would be opposite. Opposite of U is D.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, L, R. Cannot go D because it would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U (up to (6,3)), L (left to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a wall! So cannot move there.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so moving L from (6,2) would be to (5,2), which is wall, so collision.\n\nR (right) from (6,2) to (7,2), but x=7 is wall, since border x=7 is wall.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (7,2) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, from (6,2), with direction U, possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,3)\n\n- L to (5,2) but wall, invalid\n\n- R to (7,2) wall, invalid\n\n- D is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,3)?\n\nBut is that right? U to (6,3) should be valid.\n\nBut let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(6,2): x=6, y=2\n\nU: (x,y+1) = (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is within bounds, not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: is (6,3) occupied? From list: (6,2), (6,1), but no (6,3), so free.\n\nSimilarly, L to (5,2): (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nR to (7,2): x=7, border wall.\n\nD to (6,1): but (6,1) is occupied by the second segment? (6,1) is position 2, the body just behind head. But moving to (6,1) would be down, which is opposite direction, and also it's occupied.\n\nBut even if not occupied, moving opposite is not allowed, so D is invalid.\n\nTherefore, indeed, only possible move is U to (6,3).\n\nBut that seems forced. Is there no choice?\n\nPerhaps I should think about the next moves.\n\nBut for turn 66, I must move, and only U is possible? But let's see if the head can move to other cells.\n\nFrom (6,2), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (6,3)\n\n- Down: (6,1) occupied and opposite direction\n\n- Left: (5,2) wall\n\n- Right: (7,2) wall\n\nSo yes, only (6,3) is free and valid.\n\nTherefore, on turn 66, action must be U.\n\nBut the snake head direction is U, and moving U keeps the direction U.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,3), what next?\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (1,5) is under a body segment, so we might want to eat it later, but it has limited life span.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6).\n\nBut first, let's simulate the move.\n\nTurn 66: move U to (6,3)\n\nNow snake positions: head moves to (6,3), and tail moves? When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten, so snake moves to (6,3), and the segment at tail (2,5) is removed, so new positions: head at (6,3), then body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), and tail was (2,5), but removed, so now tail is (1,5)? Positions: after move, the body segments shift.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 1 to 16: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,3), the new head is (6,3), and the body becomes the previous head to second last: so (6,2) is now first body, (6,1) second, ..., up to (1,5) as the last body segment, and (2,5) is removed.\n\nThe snake moves: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head: (6,3)\n\nThen body: position 1 becomes (6,2), position 2: (6,1), position 3: (5,1), ..., position 15: (1,4), position 16: (1,5) — since (1,5) was position 15, now it becomes position 16, the tail.\n\nOriginal: pos1: (6,2) head, pos2: (6,1), pos3: (5,1), ..., pos14: (1,4), pos15: (1,5), pos16: (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move: new head at (6,3), then new body: segment 1 at old pos1 (6,2), segment 2 at old pos2 (6,1), segment 3 at old pos3 (5,1), ..., segment 15 at old pos15 (1,5), and segment 16 (tail) at old pos16 (2,5)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for body segment i, it moves to the position where segment i-1 was.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, the first body segment moves to where head was, second body to where first body was, and so on, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nIn terms of list:\n\nNew head: (6,3)\n\nThen new body segment 1: old head position (6,2)\n\nNew body segment 2: old body segment 1 position (6,1)\n\nNew body segment 3: old body segment 2 position (5,1)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment 15: old body segment 14 position (1,4)\n\nNew body segment 16: old body segment 15 position (1,5)\n\nOld tail (body segment 16) at (2,5) is removed.\n\nSo new tail is at (1,5), which was previously the 15th segment.\n\nNow, food at (1,5): it was under the body, and now the tail is at (1,5), so when tail moves away, the food might be accessible.\n\nBut for now, on turn 66, we moved to (6,3).\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction U (since we moved up).\n\nNow turn 67: from (6,3), possible moves.\n\nDirection U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (6,4), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) invalid (wall).\n\n(5,3) is not wall? Walls: only borders and (5,2), so (5,3) should be free.\n\nIs it occupied? New snake positions: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo (5,3) not in list, free.\n\n(6,4) not in list, free.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,4), L to (5,3), R invalid.\n\nD is opposite, invalid.\n\nNow, we have choices.\n\nAlso, food: (1,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by the tail at (1,5). When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves, so on next move, if we move, tail will move from (1,5), so (1,5) will be free, and food is there, so we could potentially eat it if head goes there, but it's far.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6).\n\nLife span: for (1,5), life span was 6 at turn 66, so after turn 66, it decreases to 5 on turn 67? Let's clarify life span decrease.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAt turn 66, life span is given as 6, so during turn 66, it decreases? Or at the end?\n\nIt says \"including current\", so I think at the start of turn, life span decreases.\n\nBut for action, we decide move at the turn.\n\nPerhaps: when we are at turn t, life span is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn. So after the turn, it decreases.\n\nFor example, at turn 66, life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so at the end of turn 66, life span becomes 5, and so on, until 0, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, it can be eaten during these turns.\n\nFor (1,5), at turn 66, life span 6, so it will be there until turn 71 (since after turn 66:5, 67:4, 68:3, 69:2, 70:1, 71:0 disappears after turn 71? Let's count.\n\nStart turn 66: life span 6, during turn 66 it can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 66, if not eaten, life span decreases to 5.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 67, to 4, ..., after turn 71, to 0 and disappears before turn 72.\n\nIt can be eaten on turns 66 to 71 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for (4,6), life span 8, can be eaten from turn 66 to 73 inclusive.\n\nNow back to turn 67.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), L to (5,3)\n\nR to (7,3) invalid, D invalid.\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nI need to think about the future.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,5) is at the tail, which will move next turn.\n\nAfter turn 67, if we move, the tail will move from (1,5) to the new position, so (1,5) will be free, and food is there, so we can eat it by moving head to (1,5) at some point.\n\nBut (1,5) is at bottom-left, while head is at (6,3) top-right.\n\nGrid: x=1 left, x=6 right, y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Since U is y+1, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nSo (6,3) is top-right, (1,5) is left, around middle y.\n\nTo reach (1,5), we need to go left and down or something.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 accessible, except (5,2) wall.\n\nObstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions after turn 66 move to (6,3):\n\nHead: (6,3)\n\nBody:\n\n1. (6,2)\n\n2. (6,1)\n\n3. (5,1)\n\n4. (4,1)\n\n5. (3,1)\n\n6. (2,1)\n\n7. (2,2)\n\n8. (3,2)\n\n9. (4,2)\n\n10. (4,3)  // this is at (4,3)\n\n11. (3,3)\n\n12. (3,4)\n\n13. (2,4)\n\n14. (1,4)\n\n15. (1,5)  // tail\n\n(1,5) is tail with food.\n\nNow, after next move, turn 67, if we move to (6,4) or (5,3), the tail will move.\n\nSuppose we move U to (6,4) on turn 67.\n\nThen new head (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), and tail at (1,5) is removed, new tail is (1,4)? After move: head to (6,4), body segments: first body to (6,3), second to (6,2), ..., up to the 15th body to (1,4), and the 16th body (tail) to (1,5), but (1,5) is vacated when tail moves? When the snake moves, the tail position is left, so food at (1,5) is now exposed and can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 67 move, if we move to (6,4), new positions:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nBody1: (6,3)  // previous head\n\nBody2: (6,2)  // previous body1\n\nBody3: (6,1)  // previous body2\n\nBody4: (5,1)  // previous body3\n\n...\n\nBody15: (1,4)  // previous body14\n\nBody16 (tail): (1,5)  // previous body15\n\nBut previous body15 was at (1,5), so new tail is at (1,5), so (1,5) is still occupied? No:\n\nPrevious positions before turn 67 move:\n\nHead: (6,3)\n\nBody1: (6,2)\n\nBody2: (6,1)\n\nBody3: (5,1)\n\nBody4: (4,1)\n\nBody5: (3,1)\n\nBody6: (2,1)\n\nBody7: (2,2)\n\nBody8: (3,2)\n\nBody9: (4,2)\n\nBody10: (4,3)\n\nBody11: (3,3)\n\nBody12: (3,4)\n\nBody13: (2,4)\n\nBody14: (1,4)\n\nBody15: (1,5)  // tail\n\nAfter moving head to (6,4):\n\nNew head: (6,4)\n\nNew body1: old head (6,3)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (6,2)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (6,1)\n\nNew body4: old body3 (5,1)\n\n...\n\nNew body14: old body13 (2,4)\n\nNew body15: old body14 (1,4)\n\nNew body16 (tail): old body15 (1,5)\n\nSo the cell (1,5) is now occupied by the new tail, and the food is still under it? But the tail moved to (1,5), which was where the tail was, so the food is still under the snake body.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is on the cell, and the snake body is on it, so it's covered. When the tail moves away, it will be free.\n\nIn this case, after turn 67, the tail is at (1,5), so it's occupied.\n\nOn turn 68, when we move again, the tail will move from (1,5), so (1,5) will be free, and food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, if we move to (5,3) on turn 67.\n\nBut let's think about the path to the food.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,6), which is closer.\n\n(4,6) is at top-left, head at (6,3) or (6,4).\n\nFirst, for turn 67, I need to decide between U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), that's towards the top, away from (1,5).\n\nIf I go L to (5,3), that's left, towards center.\n\nNow, from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), (4,3), etc., but (4,3) is occupied? In the body positions, body10 is at (4,3), but that was before; after turn 66, body10 is at (4,3).\n\nAfter turn 66, positions include (4,3) as body10.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body, occupied.\n\nAfter turn 66, (6,3) is head, but on turn 67, from (6,3), if I move L to (5,3), then (5,3) is free.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), new positions.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,5) first.\n\nTo eat (1,5), we need to move the head there when it's free.\n\nCurrently, it's occupied by tail. On turn 67, when we move, the tail will move from (1,5) only if the snake doesn't eat; if we eat food, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut currently no food eaten, so on turn 67 move, tail will move from (1,5) to the new position, so (1,5) becomes free after the move.\n\nAfter turn 67 action, the cell (1,5) will be free because the tail moved away.\n\nThen on subsequent turns, we can move to (1,5) to eat it.\n\nBut (1,5) has life span decreasing, so we have until turn 71 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) has longer life.\n\nNow, head is at (6,3), (1,5) is at (1,5), which is left 5, down 2? x from 6 to 1, delta x= -5, y from 3 to 5, delta y= +2, so it's far.\n\nWe need to navigate through the grid.\n\nAlso, the snake body is in the way; there are many occupied cells.\n\nFor example, cells like (2,2), (3,2), etc. are occupied.\n\nLet's list free cells after turn 66.\n\nAccessible cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (5,2) wall.\n\nOccupied by snake: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,5)? (2,5) is not occupied, in positions, (2,4) and (1,5), no (2,5), so (2,5) free.\n\nList all:\n\nx=1: y=1,2,3,6 free; y=4 occupied, y=5 occupied.\n\nx=2: y=1 occ, y=2 occ, y=3 free? y=4 occ, y=5 free? (2,5) not in list, so free; y=6 free.\n\nPositions: (2,1) occ, (2,2) occ, (2,4) occ, no (2,3), (2,5), so (2,3) free, (2,5) free, (2,6) free.\n\nSimilarly x=3: y=1 occ, y=2 occ, y=3 occ (body11), y=4 occ, y=5 free? (3,5) not listed, so free; y=6 free.\n\nx=4: y=1 occ, y=2 occ, y=3 occ (body10), y=4 free? (4,4) not listed, free; y=5 free, y=6 food.\n\nx=5: y=1 occ, y=2 wall, y=3 free, y=4 free, y=5 free, y=6 free.\n\nx=6: y=1 occ, y=2 occ, y=3 head, occ, y=4 free, y=5 free, y=6 free.\n\nAnd (4,6) food.\n\nSo free cells include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(5,3) is free, etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 67.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nOptions: U to (6,4) or L to (5,3)\n\nIf we go U to (6,4), then head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nFrom there, we can go U to (6,5), L to (5,4), or R invalid, D invalid if direction U.\n\nThen to reach (1,5), we need to go left and down, but there might be a path.\n\nIf we go L to (5,3) on turn 67, head at (5,3), direction L (since we moved left).\n\nFrom (5,3), we can go U to (5,4), D to (5,2) invalid, L to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied? After turn 67, if we move to (5,3), let's see positions.\n\nFirst, for turn 67, I need to choose.\n\nBut I should consider the tail food.\n\nThe food at (1,5) will be free after turn 67, because when we move on turn 67, the tail moves from (1,5).\n\nAfter turn 67 action, the cell (1,5) is vacated and food is there, so on turn 68, it can be eaten.\n\nBut head is at (6,3) or (6,4), far from (1,5).\n\nDistance: min moves: from (6,3) to (1,5), need to go left 5, up 2, so at least 7 moves, but with obstacles and body, it might take more.\n\nBut life span: at turn 67, after turn 66, food at (1,5) has life span 5 (since decreased after turn 66).\n\nAt turn 66 start, life span 6, after turn 66, it decreases to 5 for turn 67.\n\nSimilarly, it can be eaten on turns 67 to 71.\n\nTurn 67: life span 5, can be eaten.\n\nBut from head position on turn 67, if at (6,4) or (5,3), to (1,5) is at least 5-6 moves away, so possible but tight.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) to (1,5): delta x=-5, delta y=+1, so min 6 moves.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (1,5): delta x=-4, delta y=+2, min 6 moves.\n\nBut with body, it might not be direct.\n\nAlso, there might be risks of collision.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (4,6) which is closer and has longer life.\n\n(4,6) from (6,3): delta x=-2, delta y=+3, min 5 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4): delta x=-2, delta y=+2, min 4 moves.\n\nFrom (5,3): delta x=-1, delta y=+3, min 4 moves.\n\nSo (4,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, eating (4,6) gives +1 and length increases, which might be good for survival.\n\nBut we need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, a critical rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nFor (1,5), if we eat it, we need to make sure that when we eat, the head is not adjacent to the tail, otherwise collision.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,5), but after it moves, on turn 67, tail is no longer at (1,5); it moves away.\n\nAfter turn 67 move, tail is at new position.\n\nFor example, if on turn 67 we move to (6,4), then new tail is at (1,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 67 move to (6,4), new positions:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nBody1: (6,3)\n\nBody2: (6,2)\n\nBody3: (6,1)\n\nBody4: (5,1)\n\n...\n\nBody14: (2,4)\n\nBody15: (1,4)  // new body15\n\nBody16: (1,5)  // new tail\n\nSo tail at (1,5)\n\nBut (1,5) has food, and if head were to move to (1,5), it would eat it, but head is at (6,4), far.\n\nWhen we move to eat (1,5), we need to be adjacent to it and not have the tail adjacent at that time.\n\nBut let's not worry for now.\n\nPerhaps for immediate turns, we should go for the closer food or avoid danger.\n\nAnother thing: the head is near the wall at x=6.\n\nFrom (6,3), if we go U to (6,4), then at (6,4), we can go U to (6,5), L to (5,4), etc.\n\nIf we go L to (5,3), then at (5,3), we can go U to (5,4), L to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied? After turn 67, if we move to (5,3), positions change.\n\nLet's simulate both options.\n\nFirst, option 1: turn 67 move U to (6,4)\n\nThen head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nNow turn 68: from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), L to (5,4), R invalid, D to (6,3) but (6,3) is occupied by body (body1), and also D is opposite if direction U, so invalid.\n\nSo can go U or L.\n\nIf U to (6,5), then at (6,5), can go U to (6,6), L to (5,5), etc.\n\nIf L to (5,4), then to (5,4).\n\nFood at (4,6) is at (4,6), so from (6,4), we can go L to (5,4), then from (5,4) to (5,5) or (4,4), then to (4,5) or (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied, etc., to reach (4,6).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (4,6): go L to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then U to (4,6), but (4,5) is free? After turn 67, positions, but it's changing.\n\nPerhaps it's messy.\n\nOption 2: on turn 67 move L to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow turn 68: from (5,3), direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) invalid (wall), L to (4,3), R to (6,3) invalid (occupied and opposite? R is right, but direction is L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo can go U or L.\n\n(4,3) is currently occupied? After turn 67 move to (5,3), let's see positions.\n\nBefore turn 67 move (after turn 66): head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nMove head to (5,3) on turn 67.\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew body1: (6,3)  // old head\n\nNew body2: (6,2)  // old body1\n\nNew body3: (6,1)  // old body2\n\nNew body4: (5,1)  // old body3\n\nNew body5: (4,1)  // old body4\n\nNew body6: (3,1)  // old body5\n\nNew body7: (2,1)  // old body6\n\nNew body8: (2,2)  // old body7\n\nNew body9: (3,2)  // old body8\n\nNew body10: (4,2)  // old body9\n\nNew body11: (4,3)  // old body10\n\nNew body12: (3,3)  // old body11\n\nNew body13: (3,4)  // old body12\n\nNew body14: (2,4)  // old body13\n\nNew body15: (1,4)  // old body14\n\nNew body16 (tail): (1,5)  // old body15\n\nOld tail (1,5) is removed? No, old body15 was at (1,5), so new tail is at (1,5), and the cell is still occupied.\n\nWhen we move, the tail position is vacated only if the tail moves, but in this case, the tail moved to (1,5), which was occupied, so the food is still under snake.\n\nBut after this move, on turn 68, when we move again, the tail will move from (1,5).\n\nFor the food to be accessible, we need the cell to be free.\n\nAfter turn 67 action, for both cases, the tail is at (1,5), so (1,5) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 68, when we move, the tail will move from (1,5), so after turn 68 move, (1,5) will be free.\n\nFor example, on turn 68, if we move from current position, the tail moves.\n\nSo (1,5) will be free after turn 68.\n\nThen on turn 69, we can try to eat it.\n\nBut head position on turn 68 depends on previous moves.\n\nPerhaps for now, since (4,6) is closer and has longer life, we should go for that first.\n\nAlso, to maximize score, we can eat both, but (1,5) has short life.\n\nLet's see if we can reach (1,5) in time.\n\nFrom turn 67, head at either (6,4) or (5,3).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,5): possible path, e.g., (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) but (3,4) occupied, so (3,5) or something.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,5):\n\nOne way: go left to x=1, then down to y=5.\n\nBut y=5, x=1 is (1,5).\n\nBut need to avoid body.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) go L to (5,4), then L to (4,4), then D to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, so not, from (4,4) go D to (4,3) invalid, so go U to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then L to (2,5), then D to (2,4) occupied, so to (1,5) from (2,5) or (1,4) but (1,4) occupied.\n\n(2,5) is free, as per earlier.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,5): (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (1,5) or (2,5) -> (1,5) directly.\n\n(2,5) to (1,5) is adjacent, yes.\n\nBut (1,5) is the target.\n\nNumber of moves: 6 moves from (6,4) to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly from (5,3) to (1,5): (5,3) -> (4,3) occupied, so not direct.\n\n(5,3) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) occupied, so (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (1,5), or (5,3) -> (4,3) invalid, so (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (1,5), 6 moves.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (1,5) in 6 moves.\n\nNow, on turn 67, if we start from (6,3), move to (6,4) or (5,3), then on turn 68, we are at (6,4) or (5,3), then we can start moving towards (1,5).\n\nBut on turn 68, after move, (1,5) is free.\n\nTurn 68 action: after turn 67 move, positions change.\n\nAssume we are at turn 67.\n\nAfter turn 67 move, the food at (1,5) has life span 4 for turn 68? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 66: start, food (1,5) life span 6\n\nAfter turn 66 action, life span decreases to 5 for turn 67.\n\nTurn 67: start with life span 5, after action, decreases to 4 for turn 68.\n\nTurn 68: life span 4, after action, to 3 for turn 69.\n\nTurn 69: life span 3, to 2 for turn 70.\n\nTurn 70: life span 2, to 1 for turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: life span 1, to 0 after, disappears.\n\nCan be eaten on turns 67 to 71 inclusive.\n\nOn turn 67, head position after action is either (6,4) or (5,3).\n\nFrom there, to reach (1,5) in 6 moves, but on turn 67 we are already at that position, so eating on turn 67 is not possible since (1,5) occupied.\n\nEarliest eating on turn 68, but on turn 68, we are at (6,4) or (5,3), not at (1,5), so we need to move towards it.\n\nIf we move directly, we can reach on turn 72 or later, but turn 72 is too late, since on turn 71 it can be eaten, but after turn 71 action, it disappears.\n\nTurn 71: life span 1, can be eaten during turn 71.\n\nAfter turn 71, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 71.\n\nFrom turn 67 position, to (1,5), min 6 moves, so from turn 67 to turn 72 or 73, which is after turn 71, so impossible to eat (1,5)? Let's calculate turns.\n\nTurn number: turn 67 action: we move to (6,4) or (5,3)\n\nThen turn 68: we move from there\n\nTurn 69: move\n\nTurn 70: move\n\nTurn 71: move\n\nOn turn 71, we can be at (1,5) if we move directly.\n\nFrom turn 67 position to (1,5) in 5 moves: turn 67 to turn 68,69,70,71,72? Actions:\n\nAt start of turn 67, we are at (6,3), we move to new position, that's turn 67 action.\n\nThen at start of turn 68, we are at that new position, say (6,4), then we move to next, turn 68 action to new cell.\n\nThe position after turn k action is the position for turn k+1 start.\n\nTo be at (1,5) on a turn to eat, we need to move to (1,5) during that turn's action.\n\nFor example, on turn t, we move to (1,5), then we eat it.\n\nSo for turn t=68, we can move to (1,5) if we are adjacent and move there.\n\nBut on turn 67, we are at (6,4) or (5,3), not adjacent to (1,5), so we cannot move to (1,5) on turn 68; we need to get closer.\n\nThe earliest we can be at (1,5) is after several moves.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,5): as above, 6 moves, so on turn 67 position, after turn 67 action, we are at P67.\n\nThen turn 68 action to P68, turn 69 to P69, ..., turn 72 to P72.\n\nP67 to P68: one move, so after 1 move, we are at a cell closer, but not at (1,5).\n\nAfter k moves from P67, we can be at (1,5).\n\nMin k=6 for this path.\n\nSo on turn 67 + k, we can be at (1,5).\n\nFor k=6, turn 73.\n\nTurn 73 is after turn 71, so too late.\n\nMax k=5? Min distance is 5? Delta x=5, delta y=1, so min 6 moves, since each move changes x or y by 1.\n\nManhattan distance |6-1| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6, so min 6 moves.\n\nSimilarly from (5,3): |5-1| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,5) before it disappears, since last eat turn is 71, but we can only reach on turn 73 or later.\n\nTurn 67 + 6 = turn 73, which is after turn 71.\n\nTurn 67 action: on turn 67 we move to P67.\n\nThen turn 68 move to P68, ..., turn 72 move to P72.\n\nOn turn 72, we can be at (1,5) if we move there, but on turn 72, the food has life span? At turn 71, life span 1, after turn 71 action, if not eaten, decreases to 0 and disappears, so on turn 72, no food.\n\nSo we can only eat on turns up to 71.\n\nOn turn 71, to be at (1,5), we need to move there on turn 71 action.\n\nBut from P67, we need to be at (1,5) in 4 moves: turn 68,69,70,71.\n\nBut min 6 moves, so only 4 moves from turn 68 to 71, not enough.\n\nTurn 68 action from P67 to P68\n\nTurn 69 to P69\n\nTurn 70 to P70\n\nTurn 71 to P71\n\nSo from P67 to P71 in 4 moves, but min distance 6, impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 71.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (1,5) because it will disappear before we can reach it, given the current position.\n\nSo we should ignore (1,5) and focus on the other food or survival.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,6), life span 8, can be eaten up to turn 73.\n\nNow, head at (6,3), we can go for (4,6).\n\nFrom (6,3) to (4,6): delta x=-2, delta y=+3, min 5 moves.\n\nBut we can do it in fewer if possible.\n\nOn turn 67, we move to (6,4) or (5,3).\n\nIf to (6,4), from there to (4,6): e.g., (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,6), 4 moves.\n\n(6,4) to (4,6) in 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3) to (4,6): (5,3) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,6), 4 moves, or (5,3) -> (4,3) occupied, not possible, so must go via (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied, so from (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (4,6).\n\n4 moves.\n\nNow, on turn 67, we are at P67, say (6,4) or (5,3).\n\nThen turn 68: move to next, say to (5,4) from (6,4), or to (5,4) from (5,3).\n\nThen turn 69: to (5,5) or similar.\n\nTurn 70: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: to (4,6) eat.\n\nSo can eat on turn 71.\n\nBut life span of (4,6): at turn 66, life span 8, after turn 66 to 7, turn 67 to 6, turn 68 to 5, turn 69 to 4, turn 70 to 3, turn 71 to 2, turn 72 to 1, turn 73 to 0.\n\nSo on turn 71, life span 2, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, we can eat by turn 71.\n\nBut we might eat earlier.\n\nFor example, if we go directly.\n\nBut from (6,3), on turn 67, if we go to (5,3), then from (5,3) to (5,4) on turn 68, to (5,5) on turn 69, to (4,5) on turn 70, to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nIf from (6,3) to (6,4) on turn 67, then to (5,4) on turn 68, to (5,5) on turn 69, to (4,5) on turn 70, to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nSame.\n\nCan we reach faster? From (6,3) to (4,6) directly not possible, min 5 moves, but from turn 67 position.\n\nOn turn 67, after action, at (6,4) or (5,3), both require 4 moves to (4,6), so eat on turn 71.\n\nBut turn 71 is within life span.\n\nNow, for the other food, we can't eat, so no issue.\n\nBut we need to choose the move on turn 67.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid collisions.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, so we need to be careful with space.\n\nBut for now, let's decide the action for turn 66 first.\n\nOn turn 66, we must move U to (6,3), as established.\n\nThen for turn 67, we can choose U or L.\n\nIf we go U to (6,4), that might be closer to the wall, but we can still move left later.\n\nIf we go L to (5,3), we are more central.\n\nBut (5,3) is free, no issue.\n\nAlso, from (5,3), we can go up to (5,4), etc.\n\nNow, to reach (4,6), both paths are similar.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but we are at y=3, so ok.\n\nAlso, the snake body: for example, if we go to (6,4), then at (6,4), we can go L to (5,4), which is free.\n\nSimilarly from (5,3) to (5,4).\n\nNow, on turn 67, I think both are fine, but since we need to output actions, and think ahead, but for turn 67, we can decide later.\n\nThe answer should include actions starting from turn 66.\n\nFor turn 66, only one choice: U.\n\nThen for turn 67, we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nBut since thinking ahead, I should plan a sequence to the food.\n\nBut the food might not be eaten immediately, but we can eat it on turn 71.\n\nIn between, we need to survive.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so we have more body, which might block paths.\n\nBut let's first output turn 66 action.\n\nThen for turn 67, let's choose to go L to (5,3) to be more central, away from the wall.\n\nOr U to (6,4) to go up.\n\nSince (4,6) is up and left, going left first might be better.\n\nFrom (6,3), going L to (5,3) is directly towards (4,6), while U to (6,4) is up, not left.\n\nManhattan distance: to (4,6) from (6,3): dx=2, dy=3.\n\nFrom (5,3): dx=1, dy=3, same as from (6,4): dx=2, dy=2, both min 4 moves to (4,6).\n\nBut from (5,3), we can go to (5,4) then (4,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(4,4) is free, as per earlier.\n\nFrom (6,4), we go to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is free.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), from (5,3) we can go U to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n\nFrom (6,4), L to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n\nSame.\n\nBut from (5,3), if we go directly L to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied after turn 66, and on turn 67, if we move to (5,3), (4,3) is still occupied by body, as new body11 at (4,3) after turn 67 move to (5,3).\n\nIn the new positions after turn 67 to (5,3), body11 is at (4,3), so we cannot go to (4,3) from (5,3) on turn 68 because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,4), (4,3) is not adjacent.\n\nSo we have to go via (5,4) or other.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nI think for turn 67, moving L to (5,3) is fine.\n\nThen we can go U to (5,4) on turn 68, etc.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for the answer, we need to specify a sequence, but it might be long.\n\nPerhaps output for the next few turns until we eat or something.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to decide how many.\n\nSince it's to play, I can output for turn 66 and 67, but thinking ahead, I should plan to the food.\n\nBut let's assume we go for the food.\n\nAlso, after eating, we need to continue.\n\nBut for now, let's start.\n\nTurn 66: must be U.\n\nThen for turn 67, let's choose L to (5,3) to move left.\n\nThen turn 68: from (5,3), direction L, so can go U to (5,4) or L to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, so only U to (5,4).\n\nAfter turn 67 to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,2), body3 (6,1), body4 (5,1), body5 (4,1), body6 (3,1), body7 (2,1), body8 (2,2), body9 (3,2), body10 (4,2), body11 (4,3), body12 (3,3), body13 (3,4), body14 (2,4), body15 (1,4), body16 (1,5)\n\n(4,3) is body11, occupied.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) invalid, L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3) but (6,3) is body1, occupied, and also R is opposite to current direction L? Direction is L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (5,4).\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen turn 68: move U to (5,4), direction now U.\n\nThen head at (5,4)\n\nNow turn 69: from (5,4), direction U, can go U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) or D.\n\nD is opposite, invalid.\n\nR to (6,4): is it free? (6,4) is not occupied, free.\n\nL to (4,4) free.\n\nU to (5,5) free.\n\nSo choices.\n\nWe can go towards (4,6).\n\nFor example, go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,4), going L to (4,4) then U to (4,5) then U to (4,6).\n\nOr U to (5,5) then L to (5,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,6) is free, (4,5) free, (4,6) food.\n\nLet's go directly.\n\nSay turn 69: move L to (4,4) to go left.\n\nDirection now L.\n\nThen from (4,4), on turn 70, can go U to (4,5), since (4,5) free.\n\nDirection L, so can go U, D, L, but D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body13, occupied, R to (5,4) but (5,4) is previous position, occupied by body, and R is opposite to L? Direction L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nU to (4,5) valid, D to (4,3) occupied and invalid, L to (3,4) occupied, R invalid.\n\nSo only U to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 70: move U to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 71: from (4,5), can go U to (4,6) to eat food.\n\n(4,6) is food, so if we move U, we eat it.\n\nDirection U, so U is allowed.\n\nThen we eat, score +1, length increases, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut we need to check if safe.\n\nNow, at turn 71, head at (4,5), move U to (4,6).\n\nAfter eating, new head at (4,6), and body includes the previous positions, with tail not moving, so snake grows.\n\nBut for now, we have a path.\n\nSimilarly, if we had chosen differently.\n\nBut for turn 67, we moved L to (5,3), then turn 68 U to (5,4), turn 69 L to (4,4), turn 70 U to (4,5), turn 71 U to (4,6).\n\nIn turn 69, from (5,4), we could go U to (5,5), then from (5,5) on turn 70 go L to (4,5), then turn 71 U to (4,6).\n\nSame thing.\n\nNow, back to turn 66 and 67.\n\nFor turn 66, action U.\n\nFor turn 67, since we have to choose, and both lead to similar, but in this case, by going L on turn 67, we ended up with only one choice on turn 68, which is U.\n\nIf on turn 67 we went U to (6,4), then on turn 68, from (6,4), direction U, can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nThen we can go L to (5,4), then to (5,5), etc., to (4,6).\n\nFor example, turn 67 U to (6,4), turn 68 L to (5,4), turn 69 U to (5,5), turn 70 L to (4,5), turn 71 U to (4,6).\n\nAlso possible.\n\nNow, in both cases, we reach (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nBut with the first choice, when we went L on turn 67, on turn 68 we had no choice but U, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor the answer, since turn 66 must be U, and for turn 67, I can choose L to (5,3).\n\nThen the sequence can be planned.\n\nBut we also need to consider after eating, but for now, let's output the actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is not reachable, so ignore.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nThen turn 67: L (to (5,3))\n\nThen turn 68: U (to (5,4)) as only choice\n\nThen turn 69: from (5,4), we have choices, but to go to (4,6), we can go L to (4,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nI think L to (4,4) is more direct, as above.\n\nThen turn 70: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: U to (4,6)\n\nBut turn 71 is in the future, and we need to output actions.\n\nSince the answer should be in a boxed format, I can output for turns 66 to 71 or something.\n\nBut turn 71 might be too far, and things might change.\n\nPerhaps output until the food is eaten or for a few turns.\n\nBut to be precise, let's output for turns 66, 67, 68, and then the next can be decided later.\n\nBut since we thought ahead, we can output a sequence.\n\nI think for this, we can do:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nThen for turn 69, from (5,4), we can go L to (4,4)\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nOn turn 68, after moving U to (5,4), direction is U.\n\nThen turn 69, from (5,4), direction U, we can go L to (4,4), which is left, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThen turn 69: L to (4,4), direction now L.\n\nThen turn 70: from (4,4), direction L, we can go U to (4,5), as before.\n\nThen turn 70: U to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 71: U to (4,6) eat.\n\nNow, in this path, all moves are valid and safe.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, but we can deal with that later.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 71.\n\nBut turn 71 is turn 66+5, so 5 turns ahead.\n\nt1=66, up to t1+5=71.\n\nBut we have actions from 66 to 71.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 66 to turn 71, that's 6 actions? Turns: 66,67,68,69,70,71.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 71 we eat.\n\nBut the action is for the turn, so for turn 66 to 71.\n\nIn the output, it should be fine.\n\nSince we might not need all, but it's ok.\n\nNow, for the first move, turn 66, only U, so we must output that.\n\nThen for turn 67, I chose L, but could I choose U? But L seems fine.\n\nTo avoid being near wall, going L might be better.\n\nBut both ok.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: L\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nBut on turn 69, we move L to (4,4), and on turn 70 U to (4,5), etc.\n\nIn terms of action, U, L, etc.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure the directions.\n\nAlso, for turn 69, from (5,4) to (4,4), that is left, so L.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 66, the only valid and safe move is U (up) to (6,3), as moving left or right would result in a wall collision, and moving down is invalid due to the no-instant-reverse rule and occupation by the snake's body.\n\nLooking ahead 5+ turns, the food at (1,5) with a remaining life span of 6 turns (disappearing after turn 71) is unreachable due to the Manhattan distance (min 6 moves from turn 67 positions) and the limited time frame (last eatable turn is 71, but arrival is only possible by turn 73). Thus, this food is ignored to avoid unnecessary risk.\n\nThe primary goal is to eat the positive food at (4,6) with value +1 and life span 8 (disappearing after turn 73). A safe and efficient path to (4,6) is planned, considering collision avoidance and movement constraints. The sequence from turn 66 to turn 71 ensures the snake eats the food at (4,6) on turn 71, maximizing score while prioritizing long-term survival.\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 66 to 71):\n- **Turn 66**: Move U to (6,3) – Only valid move to avoid walls and body collision.\n- **Turn 67**: Move L to (5,3) – Moves toward the food and central area, avoiding walls.\n- **Turn 68**: Move U to (5,4) – Only valid move; avoids body and walls, progressing upward.\n- **Turn 69**: Move L to (4,4) – Heads directly toward the food; valid and safe.\n- **Turn 70**: Move U to (4,5) – Approaches the food; only valid move from (4,4) with direction L.\n- **Turn 71**: Move U to (4,6) – Eats the food at (4,6); valid and safe, with no tail adjacency risk.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake survives, eats the positive food on turn 71 (within its life span), and grows by +1 segment. After eating, the snake can continue navigating safely, but the sequence up to turn 71 is sufficient for the current decision.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 66\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71\\text{: U}\n}",

        "step": 67,
        "score": 16,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 67, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, I can't move into those cells.\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (6,3), and it's moving Up. The body segments follow: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), and the tail is at (1,5). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood available:\n\n- At (1,5) with value 1 and life span 5. But (1,5) is the tail position! The snake's tail is at (1,5), and there's food there. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nSpecifically for the tail: there's a \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and the newly grown tail will collide. Let me read that again.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, the head is at (6,3) and the tail is at (1,5). Are they adjacent? Let's see the positions: (6,3) and (1,5). The distance in x is 5, y is 2, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So (6,3) and (1,5) are not adjacent; they're far apart. So this danger might not apply directly, but I need to be careful when moving towards the tail.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is under the tail. Since the tail is there, the head can't eat it immediately. The tail must move away first.\n\nSimilarly, other food: at (4,6) with value 1, life span 7; and at (6,4) with value 1, life span 10.\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (1,5) it's 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this one? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (1,5) with life span 5, on turn 67, it will disappear after turn 67 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N, it disappears after N turns from when it was spawned, but here it's given as current life span, so on turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning on turn t + L it will be gone. But the countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if current turn is t, after this turn, life span becomes L-1 for the next turn.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food with life span L on turn t:\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes L-1 for turn t+1.\n\n- It disappears when life span reaches 0, so after L turns from now, it's gone. On turn t + L, it's no longer there.\n\nFor example, at turn 67, food at (1,5) has life span 5, so after turn 67, it has 4 left; after turn 68, 3; ... after turn 71, it has 0 and disappears before turn 72 or on turn 72? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nI think it's better to think: on turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Let's define.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn t, the food has life span L. During turn t, if the snake moves to that cell, it can eat it. After the move, if eaten, it's gone; if not, life span decreases by 1. So at the end of turn t, life span decreases.\n\nBut for planning, on turn t, food with life span L will last until turn t + L - 1, and disappear before turn t + L. For simplicity, it has L turns left including current.\n\nFor (1,5): life span 5 at turn 67, so it can be eaten on turns 67,68,69,70,71. On turn 72, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life span 7, can be eaten turns 67 to 73.\n\n(6,4): life span 10, turns 67 to 76.\n\nNow, current head position: (6,3), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down) on the next turn. So possible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is invalid.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are around head:\n\n- Up (U): (6,4) — is this valid? (6,4) is a food position, but let's check if it's occupied or wall.\n\nFirst, walls: border walls x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. So (6,4) is within bounds, x=6 between 1 and 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x:1 to 6, y:1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so grid is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (1,1) is not wall, (1,0) is wall, etc.\n\nIn positions, snake has (6,1), which is y=1, not y=0, so y=1 is valid, y=0 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4), (1,5) x=1 not 0.\n\nSo grid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo (6,4): x=6, y=4, which is within 1-6, not wall, not obstacle. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all to check.\n\nSnake: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nSo (6,4) is not in this list, so it's empty? But food is at (6,4), so it's a food cell, not occupied by snake body except possibly head, but head is at (6,3).\n\n(6,4) has food, and it's not a snake body part, so moving up to (6,4) is possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions: head (6,3), up to (6,4).\n\nNow, other moves:\n\nLeft (L): (5,3) — x=5,y=3. Is this valid? x=5,y=3, within bounds, not wall. Obstacle at (5,2), not (5,3). Snake positions: (5,1) is body, but (5,3) not listed, so empty? Food not mentioned there, so probably empty cell.\n\nRight (R): (7,3) — but x=7 is border wall, so invalid. Cannot move right.\n\nDown (D): (6,2) — but this is the body segment, and since direction is U, moving D is reverse, which is invalid anyway because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,3): U to (6,4), L to (5,3), and that's it? R to (7,3) wall, D to (6,2) body and reverse invalid.\n\nD to (6,2) is occupied by snake body, so collision if I move there, but also reverse invalid.\n\nBut even if not reverse, moving to body cell is deadly except for the tail under certain conditions.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (6,2) is not the tail; tail is at (1,5). (6,2) is the second segment, so moving to (6,2) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is empty, I think.\n\nLet me list all occupied cells for clarity.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (6,3) head\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5) tail\n\nAlso, walls at borders and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nFood at (1,5), (4,6), (6,4)\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6, which is within 1-6? y=6 is not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is valid.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) valid.\n\nNow, for (5,3): not listed in snake, not wall, not obstacle, not food, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4): has food, and not body, so can eat it.\n\n- L to (5,3): empty, safe.\n\n- R: invalid, wall\n\n- D: invalid, body and reverse\n\nSo only two choices: Up or Left.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, if I move Up to (6,4), I eat the food there. Value +1, snake grows by one, so new tail will be added, but since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n\nWhen snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place for that turn? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added where the tail was or something. I need to recall how movement works.\n\nTypically in snake: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward one cell, so if not eating, length same; if eating, tail doesn't move, so new cell is added at head, increasing length.\n\nIn this case, when moving to a food cell, after moving head to food, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one.\n\nIf not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves to the next position, so the cell where tail was becomes empty.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new head at new position, then positions become [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}] and T is removed, so tail was T, now B_{n-1} is new tail.\n\nWith eating: new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so tail stays, and new segment added.\n\nIn this case, when head moves to food, the tail does not advance, so the cell where tail was remains part of snake.\n\nBack to moving to (6,4).\n\nIf I move U to (6,4), I eat the food there. Value +1, snake grows.\n\nNew head position: (6,4)\n\nNew snake positions: since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (6,4), then previous head (6,3) becomes neck, and so on, down to tail (1,5) still there.\n\nSo snake length increases by one: now 17 segments.\n\nFood at (6,4) is consumed, so removed.\n\nThen, life span of other food decreases.\n\nBut (6,4) had life span 10, but eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, after this move, direction is U, since I moved up.\n\nNow, what can I do next?\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nIf I move Left to (5,3), no food, so snake moves normally: head to (5,3), tail moves forward, so the tail (1,5) is removed, and new tail is (1,4)? Let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nAfter moving L to (5,3):\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (1,4), and tail (1,5) moves? Without eating, tail moves off.\n\nThe segment that was tail (1,5) is removed, and the new tail is what was (1,4)? Positions: after head moves to (5,3), the body segments shift: the first body segment (6,3) becomes new position after head, but since head moved to (5,3), the new list is [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] and (1,5) is removed.\n\nSo new tail is (1,4), and (1,5) is now empty.\n\nBut there is food at (1,5), which is now exposed since tail moved away.\n\nFood at (1,5) was under tail, now tail moved to (1,4), so (1,5) has food and is empty, so can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut currently head is at (5,3), far away.\n\nAlso, direction after moving left: since I moved L, new direction is L (left).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate both options.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving Up to (6,4) on turn 67.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) food, snake positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] length 17.\n\nDirection is U (since moved up).\n\nNow turn 68: head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU (up): (6,5) — y=5, within 1-6? y=6 is max, y=7 wall, so y=5 valid. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (6,4) head, (6,3), etc., no (6,5). Not wall, not obstacle. Food? No food mentioned, so empty. So possible.\n\nD (down): (6,3) — but (6,3) is the neck, body segment, so moving there would collide. Also, reverse direction, invalid.\n\nL (left): (5,4) — x=5,y=4. Not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions? Positions: (5,1), (5, something else? (4,3), (3,3), etc., no (5,4), so empty.\n\nR (right): (7,4) — x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, if I go U to (6,5), that's empty, no food. Then snake moves, tail advances.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), empty.\n\nBut I need to think about other food.\n\nThere is food at (4,6) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has food, and life span 5, so it can be eaten until turn 71.\n\nAfter turn 67, life span decreases to 4 for turn 68, etc.\n\nBut currently after turn 67, if I moved up, head at (6,4), and (1,5) is still under tail? In the positions, (1,5) is part of snake, but since I ate at (6,4), the tail didn't move, so (1,5) is still occupied, food under it.\n\nTo eat (1,5), I need the tail to move away first.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6) is free.\n\nNow, if I move left to (5,3) on turn 67.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), no eat, so snake positions: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] and (1,5) is now empty with food.\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nNow turn 68: head at (5,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nL (left): (4,3) — but (4,3) is a body segment! Positions: (4,3) is in the list, it's the 11th segment or something. After move, positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), ..., and (4,3) is later? Let's see the order: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]\n\nSo (4,3) is the 12th element, so it's a body segment. Moving left to (4,3) would collide with body.\n\nAlso, moving left is same direction, so not reverse, but still collision.\n\nD (down): (5,2) — but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Wall, so invalid.\n\nU (up): (5,4) — x=5,y=4, not occupied, not wall, empty.\n\nR (right): (6,3) — but (6,3) is the neck, body segment, so collision. Also, reverse direction? Current direction L, moving R is opposite, so invalid reverse.\n\nSo only possible move: U to (5,4).\n\nNo choice, must go up.\n\nThen turn 68: move U to (5,4).\n\nNo food there, so snake moves, tail advances.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) and (1,4) is removed? Tail was (1,4), so after moving, new positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] and new tail (2,4).\n\n(1,4) is gone, and (1,5) has food exposed.\n\nDirection now U (up).\n\nNow, back to the first choice: if on turn 67 I go up to (6,4), I eat food, grow to 17, head at (6,4), dir U.\n\nThen turn 68, I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), empty, no food.\n\nThen positions: head to (6,5), body: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), ..., up to (1,5) ] but since I ate at (6,4), tail is (1,5), so after moving without eating, tail advances: new head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (1,4), and (1,5) removed? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter eating at turn 67, positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (1,4), (1,5) ] length 17.\n\nTurn 68, move to (6,5), no food, so head to (6,5), then the body: (6,4) becomes next, then (6,3), etc., and the tail (1,5) is removed, so new positions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] and (1,5) gone. New tail (1,4).\n\n(1,5) food is still there, but not eaten, and now exposed since tail moved away.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 68 from (6,4) I go L to (5,4), no food, so similar, head to (5,4), body: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (1,5) ], then tail advances, (1,5) removed, new positions with tail at (1,4), (1,5) food exposed.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat food, especially the one with short life span.\n\nFood at (1,5) has life span 5 at turn 67, so after turn 67, if not eaten, life span 4 on turn 68, and so on. It must be eaten by turn 71.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 7, so until turn 73.\n\n(6,4) if not eaten, life span 10.\n\nBut in the up move on turn 67, I eat (6,4) immediately.\n\nIn left move, I don't eat, but expose (1,5) food.\n\nNow, the problem is to get to (1,5) to eat it.\n\nBut (1,5) is at bottom left, head is at (6,3) top right.\n\nDistance is large.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders and obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead (6,3)\n\nThen down to (6,1), left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then up to (2,2), right to (3,2), (4,2), up to (4,3), left to (3,3), up to (3,4), left to (2,4), down? (2,4) to (1,4) left, then (1,5) up? (1,4) to (1,5) is up, since y increases up? In coordinates, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up.\n\nSo (1,4) to (1,5) is up.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) which is tail, but after moving away, it's free.\n\nFood at (4,6): (4,6) which is top, y=6.\n\nAnd (6,4) which is near head.\n\nIf I eat (6,4) on turn 67, I get +1, but I'm at (6,4), and need to go to (1,5) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is closer.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6): Manhattan distance |6-4| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,5): |6-1| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6, but snake body in way.\n\nBut body moves.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (6,4) and go left to (5,3) on turn 67, then to (5,4) on turn 68, then I can go towards (1,5) or (4,6).\n\nBut (1,5) food has short life, only 5 turns including turn 67, so by turn 71 it's gone.\n\nTurn 67: if I don't eat it, life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 67, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turn 67,68,69,70,71.\n\nIf not eaten by turn 71, gone.\n\nSimilarly, for planning.\n\nNow, let's consider the path to (1,5).\n\nFrom head (6,3), to (1,5).\n\nPossible path: for example, left to (5,3), then down? But down to (5,2) is wall, invalid.\n\nFrom (5,3), only up to (5,4) as we saw.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go left to (4,4), or up to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3) on turn 67 and to (5,4) on turn 68, positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4).\n\nAnd (1,5) food is there.\n\nNow from (5,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) may have food or not, in this scenario, if I didn't eat it, it's there.\n\nIn the left choice on turn 67, I didn't go to (6,4), so (6,4) food is still there.\n\nFrom (5,4), moves:\n\nU (up): (5,5) - empty?\n\nL (left): (4,4) - empty?\n\nD (down): (5,3) - body, neck, collision\n\nR (right): (6,4) - has food, and not body? In current positions, (6,4) is not occupied, since head is at (5,4), and previous was (5,3), etc., no (6,4), so yes, can move to (6,4) to eat food.\n\nBut direction is U, moving R is not reverse, so possible.\n\nAlso, I can go U or L.\n\nBut to reach (1,5), I need to go left and down.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), from (5,4), I can go left to (4,4), then (3,4), but (3,4) is body? Current positions after turn 68: [ (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ]\n\n(3,4) is in the list, it's the 15th segment, body.\n\n(2,4) tail.\n\nSo (3,4) and (2,4) are occupied.\n\n(4,4) is empty.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go L to (4,4), which is empty.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go L to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, occupied, so cannot.\n\nOr U to (4,5), or D to (4,3), but (4,3) is body.\n\nPositions: (4,3) is body, yes.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) body invalid, L to (3,4) body invalid, R to (5,4) body invalid? R to (5,4) is where I came from, but in the body now.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), the head is at (4,4), body includes (5,4), so moving back to (5,4) is collision.\n\nSimilarly, L to (3,4) collision.\n\nD to (4,3) collision.\n\nU to (4,5) may be empty.\n\nSo only U to (4,5).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nThis seems messy to reach (1,5).\n\nPerhaps a different path.\n\nMaybe I should eat the nearby food first.\n\nBut let's think about the tail food danger.\n\nThe head is not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut if I go to eat (1,5), I need to be careful not to be adjacent when eating.\n\nSince the tail is at (1,5), and I eat it, when I move to (1,5), I eat the food, so the snake grows, and the tail doesn't move, but since I'm moving to the tail position, and it's food, eating it means the head is now at (1,5), and the tail was there, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the position remains, but the segment that was tail is now part of body, and a new segment is added, so the snake extends.\n\nBut the danger is only if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, then eating causes collision because the new tail grows into head position.\n\nBut here, head is far, so no problem.\n\nAfter eating, the tail is still there, but it's not the tail anymore; the new tail is the previous segment.\n\nFor example, if tail is at T, and I move head to T to eat food, then new positions: head at T, then previous head, etc., and the tail is the segment before T, so T is now the head, and the old T is part of body, no collision.\n\nThe danger is when head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, if head moves to tail cell, it eats, but then the tail would grow to where head was, but since head was adjacent, the new tail is at head's previous position, which is adjacent to new head, so they are next to each other, but not collision unless head moves into it later.\n\nThe rule: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nWhen you eat the food at tail cell, the head moves to tail cell, and since you ate, the tail does not move, so the new tail is the same as old tail position, but now it's a body segment, and head is there, so immediately, head and body segment at same position, collision.\n\nThat's why it kills.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that has food and is occupied by tail, after moving, head is at that cell, and since ate, tail doesn't move, so the cell has both head and the old tail segment for a moment? No, in terms of positions, the tail segment is replaced or something.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose snake positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] and T has food.\n\nHead moves to T.\n\nSince moving to food, head goes to T, and the tail T does not advance, so new positions: [T, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}] and T is still there, but T is now the head, and the old T is... positions are [new_head, previous_head, previous_body, ..., previous_tail] but previous_tail is still in the list.\n\nFor example, positions before: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]\n\nAfter moving head to T (food): new head at T, then the body is [previous head H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] but T is already the head, so it's [T, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]? That can't be, duplicate.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell, if no food, tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n\nIf food, tail doesn't move, so the head occupies the new cell, and the tail cell remains part of snake, so the snake grows.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, then the previous body segments, and the previous tail remains.\n\nSo for example, before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter eating at cell C (which was T): new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nBut C is the new head, and T is still there, so the segment at T is still in the list, but C and T are the same cell? If C is the tail position, and head moves to C, so C is the new head position, and the old tail T is at C, but since head moved there, it's the same cell, so in the list, it's [C, H, B1, ..., T] but C and T are the same position, so when you add new head at C, and keep T, it means two segments at same cell, which is collision.\n\nYes, that's why it's dangerous.\n\nIf the head moves to the tail cell to eat food, since the tail is there, moving head to it causes the head to be at the same position as the tail segment, but since you eat, the tail doesn't move, so in the new positions, the head is at that cell, and the tail segment is also at that cell, so collision immediately.\n\nThat's the tail reward danger.\n\nTherefore, to eat food on the tail cell, the tail must have moved away first, so that the cell is empty, then head can move to it to eat without collision.\n\nIn this case, for (1,5), it is currently occupied by tail, so to eat it, the tail must move away first, exposing the food, then head can move to it.\n\nIn the state, on turn 67, (1,5) has food and is occupied by tail, so I need to have the tail move away before I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, in the left move option, when I move away from (6,4), the tail moves on turn 68 if I don't eat, exposing (1,5).\n\nBut head is far.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI should consider the life span.\n\nFood at (1,5) must be eaten by turn 71, so within 4 more turns after turn 67? Turn 67,68,69,70,71 to eat.\n\nAt turn 67, I can eat it if I move there, but I can't because it's occupied.\n\nOnly when it's exposed.\n\nThe earliest it can be eaten is turn 68 if tail moves away on turn 67.\n\nIn turn 67, if I do something that causes the tail to move, then on turn 68, (1,5) is free.\n\nFor example, if on turn 67 I don't eat any food, the tail moves forward.\n\nIn both choices on turn 67, if I go left to (5,3), no eat, tail moves, so on turn 68, (1,5) is free.\n\nIf I go up to (6,4) and eat, I grow, tail doesn't move, so (1,5) still occupied on turn 68, and it will be occupied until I don't eat for a turn or something.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIf I eat on turn 67 at (6,4), then on turn 67, tail does not move, so (1,5) still occupied.\n\nOn turn 68, if I don't eat, tail moves, so (1,5) is exposed for turn 68.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat on turn 67, tail moves on turn 67, so (1,5) exposed on turn 67 after move, so on turn 68 it is free.\n\nAt the end of turn 67, after move:\n\n- If I ate, positions include (1,5), so food under body.\n\n- If I didn't eat, (1,5) is empty with food.\n\nFor turn 68, if (1,5) is exposed, I can move to it if possible.\n\nBut from head position, it's far.\n\nNow, Manhattan distance from (6,3) to (1,5) is |6-1| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 = 7, so at least 7 moves away, but with body, it might be more.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (1,5): need to go left 5 steps and down 2 steps, but y: from 3 to 5, so up 2 steps, since U increases y.\n\n(6,3) to (1,5): delta x = -5, delta y = +2, so 5 left, 2 up.\n\nBut there are walls and body.\n\nShortest path might be via (5,3), (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,3) is occupied, as per positions.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3), (3,4) occupied.\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5), but (3,5) may be free, etc.\n\nBut let's see what cells are free.\n\nFree cells: for example, (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) but (1,5) has food.\n\n(3,5) : not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(2,5) : free.\n\n(1,5) food.\n\nFrom head at (6,3), if I go L to (5,3) on turn 67, then U to (5,4) on turn 68, then on turn 69 I can go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go L to (4,4) on turn 69.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go U to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go L to (3,5) on turn 71.\n\nThen from (3,5), to (2,5) on turn 72.\n\nBut (1,5) must be eaten by turn 71, so turn 72 is too late.\n\nTurn 71 is the last turn to eat (1,5).\n\nLife span 5 at turn 67, so on turn 67, if not eaten, life span 4 for turn 68, ..., on turn 71, life span 1, can be eaten, on turn 72 gone.\n\nSo must eat by turn 71.\n\nFrom above, to reach (1,5) from (6,3):\n\nTurn 67: move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 68: move U to (5,4)  -- as before, only choice\n\nTurn 69: from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4) or R to (6,4) but (6,4) has food, but let's assume I go L to (4,4) to reach (1,5)\n\nTurn 69: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) body, L to (3,4) body, R to (5,4) body, so only U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 70: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) but (4,6) has food, or D to (4,4) body, L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nL to (3,5) is free.\n\nThen to (1,5), I need to go left to (3,5) on turn 71, but (3,5) to (1,5) is not adjacent, I need (2,5) first.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 71, I can go L to (3,5)\n\nThen on turn 72, from (3,5) to (2,5) or (3,6) etc., but (2,5) is free.\n\nThen turn 73 to (1,5), but turn 73 is too late, (1,5) gone on turn 72.\n\nTurn 71 is the last chance to eat (1,5).\n\nOn turn 71, from (4,5), I can go directly to (1,5)? No, not adjacent.\n\n(4,5) to (1,5) is not possible in one move.\n\nNearest I can be on turn 71 is (2,5) or (1,4) or (1,6) but y=6 max.\n\n(1,4) is body or tail.\n\nIn the current state, (1,4) is body.\n\nBut after moves, it changes.\n\nFor example, if on turn 67 I go L to (5,3), no eat, tail moves, (1,5) exposed.\n\nTurn 68: go U to (5,4), no eat, tail moves to (1,4)? Earlier positions.\n\nAfter turn 67 move L: positions [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] tail (1,4)\n\n(1,5) food exposed.\n\nTurn 68: move U to (5,4), no food, so new positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) and tail (1,4) removed, so new tail (2,4)\n\n(1,5) still there.\n\nTurn 69: from (5,4), I go L to (4,4), no food, positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), ..., (3,4), (2,4) and tail (2,4) removed? New positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] and (2,4) removed, new tail (3,4)\n\n(3,4) was body, now tail.\n\nTurn 70: from (4,4), only U to (4,5) as before, move U to (4,5), no food, positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., (3,4), and tail (3,4) removed, new positions: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) ] new tail (3,3)\n\n(1,5) still there.\n\nTurn 71: from (4,5), I can go L to (3,5) or U to (4,6) or R to (5,5)\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), ..., (3,3), tail (3,3) removed, new tail (4,3) or something.\n\nBut (1,5) is not eaten, and on turn 71 I am at (3,5), not at (1,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), on turn 72 I can go L to (2,5), then turn 73 to (1,5), but too late.\n\nOn turn 71 from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) to eat that food, but not to (1,5).\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 71 from here.\n\nBecause the shortest path is at least 5 moves: (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5), that's 6 moves to (1,5), but from (4,5) to (1,5) is not direct.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,5): need to go to (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5), so 3 moves from (4,5).\n\nBut from head start (6,3) to (4,5) is 3 moves: e.g. (6,3)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(4,4)->(4,5)? (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,5), that's 4 moves to (4,5), then to (3,5) 5, (2,5) 6, (1,5) 7 moves.\n\nTurn 67,68,69,70,71,72,73.\n\nOn turn 71, I can be at (2,5) if I move faster, but from (4,5) on turn 70, I can only go to (3,5) on turn 71, not directly to (2,5).\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) is possible on turn 72, but (1,5) gone.\n\nSo it seems I cannot reach (1,5) in time to eat it before it disappears.\n\nTherefore, it might not be worth pursuing (1,5) food; I should focus on other food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is closer and has longer life span.\n\nLife span 7, so until turn 73.\n\n(6,4) is nearby.\n\nSo on turn 67, eating (6,4) might be good, get +1 immediately.\n\nThen I can go to (4,6) or other places.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) on turn 67, head at (6,4), dir U.\n\nTurn 68: I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), no food, then positions: as before, tail advances, (1,5) exposed but far.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go U to (6,6) or L to (5,5) or R invalid or D to (6,4) body.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, within bounds.\n\nL to (5,5).\n\netc.\n\nBut to reach (4,6), from (6,5), I can go L to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is food, so I can eat it directly if I reach.\n\nFrom (6,4), on turn 68, if I go L to (5,4), no food, then from (5,4) I can go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nThen to (4,6).\n\nLet's see the fastest way to (4,6).\n\nFrom current head (6,3), if I go U to (6,4) on turn 67, eat, then at (6,4).\n\nThen turn 68, go L to (5,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 69, from (5,4), go L to (4,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 70, from (4,4), only U to (4,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 71, from (4,5), go U to (4,6), eat food.\n\nSo on turn 71, eat (4,6).\n\n(4,6) life span 7 at turn 67, so on turn 71, it has life span 7-4=3? Turn 67: L=7, after turn 67, L=6 for turn 68, ..., on turn 71, L=3, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (6,3) directly to (4,6) is not possible, but via the path.\n\nIf on turn 67 I go L to (5,3), then turn 68 U to (5,4), turn 69 L to (4,4), turn 70 U to (4,5), turn 71 U to (4,6), same as above.\n\nBut in the first case, I ate (6,4) on turn 67, so I have an extra point.\n\nIn the second case, I didn't eat on turn 67.\n\nAlso, in the first case, when I go to (6,4) on turn 67, I eat, grow, so snake is longer, but that might not be a problem.\n\nNow, for the food at (1,5), since I can't reach it in time, I should ignore it.\n\nIt will disappear on turn 72.\n\nSo prioritize eating (6,4) and then (4,6).\n\nThere is also the obstacle at (5,2), but not in the way.\n\nNow, on turn 67, moving U to (6,4) seems better because I get immediate reward.\n\nThen I need to plan the next moves to reach (4,6).\n\nAfter turn 67: head at (6,4), dir U.\n\nTurn 68: I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 69: from (5,4), dir L? After moving L, direction is L.\n\nFrom (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body, L to (4,4), R to (6,4) body or food but occupied now? After turn 68, if I moved to (5,4), positions depend.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 67: move U to (6,4), eat, positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) ] length 17, dir U.\n\nTurn 68: move L to (5,4) — is (5,4) free? Yes, no body there. No food mentioned, so empty.\n\nMove to (5,4), no eat, so snake moves: head to (5,4), then body: (6,4) becomes next, then (6,3), etc., and tail (1,5) removed, so new positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] new tail (1,4)\n\nDirection now L (left).\n\n(1,5) food exposed but ignored.\n\nTurn 69: head at (5,4), dir L.\n\nMoves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body (since (5,3) is in body? Positions: (6,3), (6,2), etc., (5,3) not listed? In new positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), ... ] so (6,3) is body, (5,3) not in list, so free? (5,3) is not occupied now.\n\nPrevious positions had (6,3), but not (5,3).\n\nAfter turn 68, positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo (5,3) is not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nD to (5,3) is possible.\n\nBut direction is L, moving D is not reverse, so possible.\n\nU to (5,5)\n\nL to (4,4)\n\nR to (6,4) body, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nBut I want to go to (4,6), so L to (4,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nL to (4,4) is closer to (4,6).\n\nMove L to (4,4), no food.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (1,4), tail (1,4) removed, new positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] new tail (2,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 70: head at (4,4), dir L.\n\nMoves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) body ( (4,3) is body), L to (3,4) body ( (3,4) is body), R to (5,4) body.\n\nAll moves except U are to body cells or invalid.\n\nU to (4,5) is free? Yes, not occupied.\n\nSo must go U to (4,5), no choice.\n\nNo eat.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (2,4), tail (2,4) removed, new positions: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] new tail (3,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 71: head at (4,5), dir U.\n\nMoves: U to (4,6) — has food! So can eat.\n\nD to (4,4) body, L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nSo I can go U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nEat (4,6), grow, so positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ..., (3,4) ] and tail (3,4) stays, length increases.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods: (6,4) and (4,6).\n\nIn this path, on turn 67 I ate (6,4), and on turn 71 I eat (4,6).\n\nIf I had not eaten (6,4), I could still eat (4,6) on turn 71, but missed the first point.\n\nMoreover, with the life span, (4,6) can be eaten later, but I ate it on time.\n\nNow, what about the other option on turn 68? Instead of going left, I could go up to (6,5) on turn 68.\n\nBut from (6,4), going to (6,5) might not be efficient for reaching (4,6).\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I need to go left to (5,5), then (4,5), then (4,6), but (4,5) to (4,6) is up, so similar number of moves.\n\nBut with the path I have, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 67.\n\nProbably for a few turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify for several turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output for turn 67 to, say, turn 71 or so.\n\nSince on turn 67, moving U is better.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, based on the plan.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 67 to 71:\n\nTurn 67: U (to (6,4), eat food)\n\nThen turn 68: L (to (5,4))\n\nIn turn 68, I could go U to (6,5), but that might lead to dead end or something.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go to (4,6) via (5,5), (4,5), but (4,5) might be available.\n\nBut in the path with L to (5,4), it works.\n\nTurn 69: from (5,4) to (4,4) L\n\nTurn 70: from (4,4) to (4,5) U\n\nTurn 71: from (4,5) to (4,6) U\n\nAll good.\n\nIf on turn 68 I go U to (6,5) from (6,4):\n\nTurn 67: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 68: U to (6,5), no eat, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), etc., tail advances.\n\nThen from (6,5), dir U.\n\nMoves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), D to (6,4) body.\n\nU to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nTo reach (4,6), I can go L to (5,5) on turn 69.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (4,5) on turn 70, then to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nSame as before, but I am at (5,5) instead of (4,4) or something, but still reach on turn 71.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 69 I move to (5,5), which might not be necessary.\n\nThe first path seems direct.\n\nMoreover, in the first path, when I move to (5,4) on turn 68, I am closer to the left side.\n\nBut either way.\n\nNow, for the output, I think moving U on turn 67 is the best choice.\n\nThen I need to specify actions for a few turns.\n\nBut the answer should include turn 67 action and then subsequent.\n\nSince the state is given for turn 67, I need to output from turn 67 onwards.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the food at (1,5) is not reachable, so no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo for turn 67, action U.\n\nThen for turn 68, from (6,4), I can go L to (5,4) as planned.\n\nIn turn 68, from (6,4), I have choices, but L is better for going to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, turn 69 to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nI should output the actions.\n\nNow, the answer format: boxed with turns and actions.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output the sequence starting from t1.\n\nSo for this, turn 67: U\n\nThen based on that.\n\nBut I need to commit to a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output for turns 67 to 71.\n\nBut after turn 71, it continues.\n\nSince the question is to maximize score, and I have a plan to eat two foods.\n\n(6,4) on 67 and (4,6) on 71.\n\n(1,5) will disappear uneaten.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 69: L (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 70: U (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 71: U (to (4,6), eat)\n\nBut on turn 69, from (5,4) to (4,4), and direction after turn 68 is L, so moving L is fine.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) to (4,5) U.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,6) U.\n\nAll valid.\n\nIf on turn 68 I go U instead, it might take more turns or be less efficient.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nTo confirm, on turn 67, if I go L first, I don't eat immediately, and still go to (4,6) later, but miss the point from (6,4).\n\nSo better to eat (6,4).\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: L\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nBut turn 71 is t1+4, since t1=67.\n\nt1=67, t1+1=68, t1+2=69, t1+3=70, t1+4=71.\n\nI can output these.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake is long, I need to avoid dead ends, but in this path, it seems open.\n\nFor example, after turn 71, head at (4,6), dir U.\n\nThen I can go U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (4,5) body; L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\n(3,6) and (5,6) may be free, so I can continue.\n\nBut not necessary for now.\n\nSo for the answer, I think:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 69 I move to (4,4), which is fine.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nPerhaps I should include the direction or something, but no, just actions.\n\nIn the plan, I assumed moving L on turn 68 and 69, but on turn 68 from (6,4) to (5,4), then on turn 69 from (5,4) to (4,4), both L moves.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Maximizing Score\n\n**Current State (Turn 67):**\n- **Grid Boundaries**: Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (5,2). Valid cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,3), direction Up. Body segments: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] (length 16).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 71).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 73).\n  - (6,4): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 76).\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 67)**: From (6,3), direction Up. Valid moves:\n  - Up (U) to (6,4): Contains positive food, safe to eat.\n  - Left (L) to (5,3): Empty cell, safe.\n  - Right (R) to (7,3): Wall, invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (6,2): Body collision and reverse move, invalid.\n- **Food Prioritization**:\n  - (1,5) is under the tail and has a short life span (must be eaten by turn 71). However, the head is far (Manhattan distance 7), and due to body obstacles, it cannot be reached by turn 71. Pursuing it risks wasting moves and missing other food. Ignore this food.\n  - (6,4) is adjacent, high-value, and can be eaten immediately for +1 score and growth.\n  - (4,6) has a longer life span and can be reached by turn 71 via a safe path.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: The snake is long (16 segments), so movements must avoid body collisions and walls. Path to (4,6) is planned with 5+ turn lookahead, ensuring no dead ends and prioritizing open spaces after eating.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No tail reward danger: Head (6,3) is not adjacent to tail (1,5).\n  - Obstacle at (5,2) blocks downward moves from (5,3) or (5,4), but planned path avoids this.\n\n**Optimal Path (5-Turn Plan):**\n1. **Turn 67**: Move Up (U) to (6,4) to eat food (+1 score, snake grows to length 17).\n2. **Turn 68**: Move Left (L) to (5,4) (empty cell, no food eaten; positions shift, tail moves).\n3. **Turn 69**: Move Left (L) to (4,4) (empty cell, no food; path toward (4,6)).\n4. **Turn 70**: Move Up (U) to (4,5) (empty cell, no food; only safe move from (4,4)).\n5. **Turn 71**: Move Up (U) to (4,6) to eat food (+1 score, snake grows).\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Score Maximized**: Eats two positive foods ( (6,4) and (4,6) ) by turn 71.\n- **Safety**: Avoids body collisions and walls at all steps. After turn 67, the path uses open cells (e.g., (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)) with no risk.\n- **Efficiency**: Direct route to (4,6) in minimal turns. Alternative paths (e.g., going Up on turn 68) take similar turns but may leave the snake in a less flexible position.\n- **Life Span Utilization**: (6,4) eaten immediately; (4,6) eaten with 3 life span remaining (safe margin). (1,5) is abandoned as unreachable.\n- **Post-Turn 71**: From (4,6), the snake can safely move Left to (3,6) or Right to (5,6) to continue exploring, but this is beyond the 5-turn plan.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ U}\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "step": 68,
        "score": 16,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 68. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and a block at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,4), and it's moving Up. The positions are: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]. So the snake has 17 segments. The tail is at (1,5).\n\nFood: Two pieces:\n\n- At (1,5) with value 1 and life span 4. But (1,5) is where the tail is currently. Since the food is under the snake's body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves there.\n\n- At (4,6) with value 1 and life span 6.\n\nLife span: For (1,5), life span is 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, including this turn. So if not eaten by turn 68 + 4 = 72, it's gone. Similarly, (4,6) has life span 6, disappears after turn 68 + 6 = 74.\n\nCurrent turn is 68, so for (1,5), countdown starts now: after this turn, life span decreases to 3, then 2, then 1, then gone. So it can be eaten on turns 68, 69, 70, 71 (since on turn 68, if eaten, life span is 4, but after eating, it's consumed).\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 68, life span is 4. If not eaten, on turn 69, it becomes 3, and so on, down to 0 when it disappears.\n\nBut if eaten on a turn, it's gone immediately.\n\nNow, the head is at (6,4), moving Up. Up means increasing y, so from (6,4), moving Up would go to (6,5).\n\nBut let's check possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down, because Down is opposite to Up, and no instant reverse.\n\nDirections: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nCurrent head direction: Up.\n\nSo from (6,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (6,5)\n\n- Left: to (5,4)\n\n- Right: to (7,4)\n\nBut walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=7 is a wall, so moving Right to (7,4) is invalid, wall collision.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so (6,5) is y=5, which is within 0 to 7, so not a wall. Grid is from 0 to 7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, meaning cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly for x.\n\nSo (6,5): x=6, y=5, not on border, should be ok? But border cells are walls, so for example, (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo (6,5): x=6 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, and not (5,2), so it's free.\n\n(5,4): x=5, y=4, not border, not (5,2) since y=2, so free.\n\n(7,4): x=7, y=4, but x=7 is border, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,4): Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4).\n\nRight is invalid.\n\nDown is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only Up or Left.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nThere's food at (1,5) and (4,6).\n\n(1,5) is currently occupied by the tail, and it's positive food. But to eat it, the tail must move away first, then head can move there.\n\nAlso, there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides.\n\nIn this case, head is at (6,4), tail at (1,5). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(6,4) and (1,5): delta x=5, delta y=1, not adjacent. Far away.\n\nSo no immediate danger from that.\n\nBut (1,5) has food, and tail is there. So if I want to eat that food, I need to move the snake such that the tail moves away, and then head comes to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6), which is free, I think. (4,6) not in snake positions? Snake positions: let's list all: from head to tail: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nSo (4,6) is not in this list, and not a wall, so it's empty, with food.\n\nLife span: (1,5) food has life span 4, so disappears after turn 71 if not eaten. (4,6) has life span 6, disappears after turn 73.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, let's think about the grid layout.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake body: let's sketch to see where it is.\n\nI should list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nBody: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nNow, the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with a vertical part on x=6 from y=1 to 4.\n\nFood at (1,5) – but that's the tail, so covered.\n\nFood at (4,6) – above, I think.\n\ny=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall, so (4,6) is y=6, which is fine.\n\nNow, to eat (4,6), I need to go to (4,6) with head.\n\nFrom current position (6,4), moving Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go Up to (6,5), that's moving away from (4,6).\n\n(6,5) is up, then from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,5). It's under tail, so I need to move the tail away.\n\nThe tail will move when the snake moves forward, unless it eats food.\n\nCurrently, if no food eaten, when snake moves, tail moves to the next segment.\n\nSo on next move, if I move head to new position, the tail will move away from (1,5) if the snake doesn't eat.\n\nLet's simulate one step.\n\nCurrent turn 68.\n\nIf I move Up to (6,5), new head position (6,5), then the body: the segment that was at (6,4) becomes new body, and so on, tail moves from (1,5) to where? The second last segment is (1,4), so tail moves to (1,4)? Let's see the positions.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo positions: before move: head (6,4), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), tail (1,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5):\n\nNew head: (6,5)\n\nThen the body: the first body segment was at (6,3), but now it moves to where head was, (6,4)\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) moves to (6,3)\n\n(6,1) moves to (6,2)\n\n(5,1) moves to (6,1)? No: each segment takes the position of the previous one in the list.\n\nThe list of positions: after move, the new list is: [new_head] + positions[:-1] but without the last element? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment before it, so the tail position is abandoned.\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,5) ] + [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ]\n\nThe last position (1,5) is no longer part of snake, so tail is now at (1,4).\n\nAnd the cell (1,5) is now free, but there is food there, so the food is now exposed, not under snake.\n\nSimilarly, if I move Left to (5,4), new head (5,4), body: [ (5,4) ] + [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) ] and tail moves from (1,5) to (1,4), so (1,5) freed with food.\n\nIn both cases, when I move, the tail moves from (1,5) to (1,4), so (1,5) is now empty with food, since food was there.\n\nNow, the food at (1,5) has life span 4, which includes this turn, so after this turn, if not eaten, life span decreases to 3.\n\nBut on this turn, turn 68, I can't eat it because head is not there; it's under tail. Only after tail moves, it can be eaten.\n\nSo the earliest I can eat it is turn 69, if head moves to (1,5) on turn 69.\n\nSimilarly, for the other food.\n\nNow, back to current move.\n\nI have two choices: Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go Up to (6,5):\n\n- Head at (6,5), direction Up.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: Up to (6,6), Left to (5,5), Right to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid, Down to (6,4) but Down opposite to Up, not allowed if current direction Up. Current direction after move would be Up, since I moved Up.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is the direction I just moved. So if I move Up, new direction is Up.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move Up, Left, or Right, but Right to (7,5) wall, so Up to (6,6) or Left to (5,5).\n\n(6,6) is y=6, not wall.\n\nIf I go Left to (5,4):\n\n- Head at (5,4), direction Left (since I moved Left).\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: Left to (4,4), Up to (5,5), Down to (5,3), Right to (6,4) but Right opposite to Left? Current direction Left, so cannot move Right (opposite), so only Left, Up, Down.\n\n(4,4) is free, I think. Not wall, not snake? After move, snake positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), etc., so (4,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (5,3) free? (5,3): not wall, and after move, snake has (5,1), (6,1), etc., not (5,3), so free.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food.\n\nFirst, food at (1,5) is now free after this move, since tail moves away.\n\nAnd it can be eaten on turn 69,70,71.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6) is at (4,6), which is north-east of current position.\n\nNow, (1,5) is closer to the tail area, and (4,6) is closer to the head area.\n\nBut head is at (6,4), (1,5) is at left-bottom, (4,6) is at left-top? x=4,y=6.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(6,4) is right-middle, (1,5) is left-top? y=5 is middle, x=1 left.\n\n(4,6) is left-top, y=6 high.\n\nAlso, there's an obstacle at (5,2), which is below.\n\nNow, to eat (1,5), I need to get the head to (1,5). Currently head at (6,4), so I need to move left and down or something.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,5): delta x = -5, delta y = +1, so mostly left.\n\nBut with the body in the way.\n\nThe snake body occupies many cells, so I need to find a path.\n\nSimilarly for (4,6).\n\nSince (1,5) food has shorter life span, only 4 turns including this, so it must be eaten soon or lost.\n\nAfter turn 68, life span 3 turns to live: can be eaten on turn 69,70,71.\n\nTurn 68: if not eaten, life span decreases to 3 for turn 69.\n\nOn turn 69, if not eaten, decreases to 2, and so on.\n\nSo available until turn 71 inclusive, I think. Life span 4 on turn 68, decreases each turn, so on turn 68:4, turn69:3, turn70:2, turn71:1, turn72:0 gone. So can be eaten on turn 68,69,70,71.\n\nBut on turn 68, it's under tail, can't be eaten, so only possible on 69,70,71.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 6, available until turn 73.\n\nNow, for (1,5), it's at (1,5), and after this move, it will be free.\n\nTo eat it on turn 69, I need to be at (1,5) on turn 69.\n\nBut on turn 68, I am at (6,4) or (5,4) or (6,5), depending on move.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,5) is 5 cells away, so impossible in one move. So cannot eat on turn 69 directly.\n\nThe head can move one cell per turn, so to go from (6,4) to (1,5), minimum distance is |6-1| + |4-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nBut since I need to be there by turn 71, I have 3 moves after this one.\n\nTurn 68: move to somewhere.\n\nTurn 69: move\n\nTurn 70: move\n\nTurn 71: move to (1,5) if possible.\n\nBut from turn 68 to turn 71 is 3 moves, so I can reach cells within 3 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4), in 3 moves, I can reach cells with Manhattan distance <=3.\n\n(1,5) is distance |6-1| + |4-5| =5+1=6, too far for 3 moves.\n\nManhattan distance is |dx| + |dy|, each move changes by 1, so to go from (6,4) to (1,5), dx=-5, dy=+1, so |dx|+|dy|=6, so at least 6 moves needed.\n\nBut I have only from turn 69 to 71 to eat, which is 3 moves, but I need to start from turn 68 position.\n\nLet's clarify turns.\n\n- Turn 68: I make a move, head moves to new position, tail moves away from (1,5), food at (1,5) is now exposed.\n\n- Turn 69: I can move head to (1,5) if adjacent and free, but from where?\n\nAfter turn 68 move, head is at either (6,5) or (5,4).\n\nFrom (6,5) to (1,5): |6-1| + |5-5| =5+0=5, still distance 5.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (1,5): |5-1| + |4-5| =4+1=5, also distance 5.\n\nSo from either position after turn 68, to (1,5) is at least 5 moves away.\n\nBut I have only turn 69,70,71 to eat it, which is 3 moves, so impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 71? Turn 69,70,71 are three moves, but to reach (1,5) requires 5 moves from turn 68 position, so I can only reach it in 5 moves, which would be turn 73, but food disappears on turn 72, so too late.\n\nLet's count:\n\nAfter turn 68 move, head is at P68.\n\nOn turn 69, move to P69.\n\nTurn 70, to P70.\n\nTurn 71, to P71.\n\nIf P71 is (1,5), then eaten on turn 71.\n\nBut P68 to P71 is 3 moves, so the position changes by at most 3 in Manhattan distance.\n\nFrom P68, which is either (6,5) or (5,4), to (1,5), min distance is 5 or 5, which is greater than 3, so impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 71.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food at (1,5) at all, because it's too far and will disappear before I can get there.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFrom (6,5) to (1,5): same y, so if I could go directly left, but there are body segments in the way.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I can go left to (5,5), then (4,5), but (4,5) is not occupied? Snake positions after moving to (6,5): head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), tail (1,4)? After move to (6,5), positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (6,5) head, (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo (5,5) is free, (4,5) free, (3,5) free, etc.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go left to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5), then to (1,5). That's 5 moves: (6,5) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5).\n\nSo from P68 = (6,5), I can be at (1,5) on turn 73, but food disappears on turn 72, so on turn 72, life span 1, can be eaten, but turn 72 is after turn 71.\n\nTurn 68: move to (6,5) or (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: from there, say to (5,5) or whatever\n\n...\n\nThe food can be eaten on turn 69,70,71.\n\nOn turn 71, if head at (1,5), eaten.\n\nBut to be at (1,5) on turn 71, I need to start from P68 and take 3 moves to get closer.\n\nFrom (6,5), after 3 moves, I can be at, say, (3,5) or (2,5), not (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is 5 away, after 3 moves, I can be at distance 3, so at (3,5) or (2,6) etc., not (1,5).\n\nSimilarly from (5,4): to (1,5), |5-1|=4, |4-5|=1, min 5 moves.\n\nAfter 3 moves, at best (2,5) or (1,6), not (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is occupied by food, but not by snake after turn 68.\n\nBut to reach it, I need to be adjacent and move there.\n\nSince it's exactly 5 moves away from both possible P68 positions, and I have only 3 moves to cover 5 distance, it's impossible to reach by turn 71.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food at (1,5); it will disappear before I can get there.\n\nSo I should ignore that food and focus on the other food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has life span 6, so available until turn 73.\n\nNow, head at (6,4), I can go to (4,6) in fewer moves.\n\n|6-4| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4, so minimum 4 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (4,6): I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then up to (4,6). Or other paths.\n\n(4,5) might be occupied? Let's see.\n\nAfter current move on turn 68.\n\nFirst, I need to decide turn 68 move.\n\nOptions: Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go Left to (5,4), that's closer to (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,6): |5-4| + |4-6| =1+2=3, so 3 moves.\n\nThen from turn 68: move to (5,4)\n\nTurn 69: from (5,4) to, say, (5,5) or (4,4) or (5,3)\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to go up.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (5,4), I can go to (5,5), then to (5,6), but (5,6) is y=6, not wall, then to (4,6)? (5,6) to (4,6) is left.\n\n(5,6) to (4,6) is adjacent.\n\nBut (5,6) might be free.\n\nFirst, after moving to (5,4) on turn 68, positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo (5,5) is free, (4,4) free, (5,3) free, etc.\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go Up to (5,5) on turn 69.\n\nThen at (5,5), direction Up.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go Up to (5,6), Left to (4,5), or Down, but Down opposite, not allowed if direction Up.\n\nCurrent direction after moving to (5,5) would be Up.\n\nSo can go Up to (5,6) or Left to (4,5) or Right to (6,5), but Right to (6,5) might be ok, but not towards (4,6).\n\n(4,5) is free? After turn 69 move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ... up to (1,4), but tail is (1,4), so (4,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) free.\n\nNow, (4,6) is the target.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go Left to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nThen at (4,5), direction Left.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go Up to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nThen eaten on turn 71.\n\n(4,6) life span: on turn 68, life span 6.\n\nAfter turn 68, if not eaten, life span 5 on turn 69.\n\nTurn 69: not eaten, life span 4\n\nTurn 70: not eaten, life span 3\n\nTurn 71: eaten, so it's possible.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,6) first.\n\nFrom (5,5), go Up to (5,6) on turn 70.\n\nThen at (5,6), direction Up.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go Left to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nAlso possible.\n\nNow, if on turn 68 I go Up to (6,5) instead.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go Left to (5,5) on turn 69.\n\nThen from (5,5), as before, to (4,5) or (5,6), then to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nSame thing, but from (6,5) to (5,5) is one move, then to (4,5) or (5,6), then to (4,6).\n\nBut from (6,5) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (4,6) or (5,5) to (5,6) to (4,6).\n\nStill 3 moves to (4,6) from (6,5)? From (6,5) to (4,6) min distance |6-4| + |5-6| =2+1=3, so possible in 3 moves.\n\nFor example, (6,5) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (4,6)? (5,6) to (4,6) is left, but after (5,5) to (5,6), direction Up, then from (5,6) to (4,6) is Left, which is not opposite to Up, so allowed.\n\n(5,6) to (4,6) is Left, and if direction was Up, Left is not opposite, so ok.\n\nOpposite of Up is Down, Left is perpendicular.\n\nSo allowed.\n\n(6,5) to (5,5) Left, then to (4,5) Left, then to (4,6) Up, etc.\n\nBut to (4,6) in 3 moves from (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,4) also 3 moves.\n\nBut if I go to (5,4) first, it might be better because it's closer to the other areas or something.\n\nNow, but I need to consider the path and body collisions.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,6) might be eaten on turn 71, but I can eat it earlier if possible.\n\nFor example, if I can get there on turn 69 or 70.\n\nBut from turn 68 position, min distance 3 or 4, so earliest turn 71? From (6,4) to (4,6) min 4 moves, so turn 72 at earliest.\n\nTurn 68: move to say (5,4) or (6,5)\n\nThen turn 69: move\n\nTurn 70: move\n\nTurn 71: move to (4,6)\n\nSo on turn 71, I can eat.\n\nSince min distance 4, I need 4 moves to reach.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (4,6): |dx|=2, |dy|=2, so min 4 moves.\n\nAfter turn 68 move, I am at P68, then 3 more moves to P71, which can be at (4,6) if I plan.\n\nBut P71 is on turn 71, I can eat there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go faster, but not possible.\n\nNow, another thing: when I eat the food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut for now, since I'm going to eat positive food, length increases.\n\nBut I need to avoid dying.\n\nNow, back to turn 68 move.\n\nIf I move Left to (5,4), then:\n\n- Turn 68: head to (5,4), direction Left\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (5,5) Up on turn 69.\n\nThen at (5,5), direction Up\n\nThen go to (5,6) Up on turn 70? But (5,6) to (4,6) is not direct; from (5,5) to (5,6) Up, then to (4,6) Left on turn 71.\n\nBut on turn 70, I am at (5,6), then turn 71 to (4,6).\n\n(5,6) is adjacent to (4,6), so yes.\n\nI could from (5,4) go directly to (4,4) Left, but (4,4) is free, then from (4,4) to (4,5) Up, then to (4,6) Up on turn 71.\n\nBut (4,5) to (4,6) Up.\n\nBut turn 71.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) on turn 68, then on turn 69 go to (5,5), turn 70 to (4,5) Left, then turn 71 to (4,6) Up.\n\n(4,5) to (4,6) is Up.\n\nNow, from (5,5) to (4,5) is Left, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if I go Up first to (6,5) on turn 68.\n\nThen from (6,5) to (5,5) Left on turn 69, then to (5,6) Up on turn 70, then to (4,6) Left on turn 71.\n\nOr from (5,5) to (4,5) Left, then to (4,6) Up on turn 71.\n\nNow, all paths seem to take until turn 71 to eat.\n\nBut I can eat on turn 70 if I get there earlier, but not possible from here.\n\nAnother idea: is there a way to reach (4,6) in fewer moves? No, min 4 from (6,4).\n\nFor example, if I could go directly, but no.\n\nNow, but when I move, I need to ensure I don't collide with body or walls.\n\nIn the path to (4,6), it seems free.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) to (5,5): (5,5) is free now.\n\nThen to (5,6): (5,6) should be free.\n\nThen to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has food, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is below, not in the way.\n\nNow, but I need to think beyond eating the food; after eating, the snake grows, and I need to survive.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but not applicable here, since head not adjacent to tail.\n\nTail is at (1,4) after turn 68 move, head will be at (5,4) or (6,5), far away.\n\nNow, after eating at (4,6) on turn 71, the snake grows, so length increases by one.\n\nThen I need to continue.\n\nBut since the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, and maximize score, but currently only one food, so after eating, I need to find more food, but no other food mentioned, so perhaps only these two, but (1,5) is not reachable.\n\nThe state only lists two food, so I assume no other food for now.\n\nAfter eating, I can survive and wait for new food, but the problem doesn't say new food spawns, so perhaps only existing food.\n\nThe food mechanics don't mention spawning; only the given food with life span.\n\nSo with two food, but one unreachable, so I can only eat one.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it safely.\n\nNow, for turn 68, both moves seem possible, but moving Left to (5,4) might be better because it's closer to (4,6) and also opens up more space.\n\nIf I go Up to (6,5), I am closer to the top wall, y=7 is wall, so (6,5) to (6,6) is possible, but then I might be cornered.\n\ny=7 is wall, so from (6,6), I can only go Down, Left, or Right, but Right to (7,6) wall, so only Down or Left.\n\nBut not immediate issue.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,4), I have more options.\n\nNow, let's think about the body: the snake has a long body, so I need to avoid circling and colliding.\n\nCurrently, after moving, the body is as listed.\n\nFor example, if I go Left to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo the area around (5,4) has (6,4) occupied, (4,4) free, (5,3) free, (5,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, if go Up to (6,5), head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), etc., (5,5) free, (6,6) free.\n\nNow, to reach (4,6), from (5,4) I can go through (5,5) and (5,6) or (4,4) and (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might be a good point.\n\n(4,5) is currently free, and in the path.\n\nBut let's see if it becomes occupied later.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,4) on turn 68, then to (5,5) on turn 69, then to (5,6) on turn 70, then to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nWhen I move to (5,5) on turn 69, the body moves: head to (5,5), then previous body segments shift, tail moves to new position.\n\nAfter turn 68: positions at end of turn 68: head (5,4), body as above.\n\nTurn 69: move to (5,5), new head (5,5), then body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) but without the last, so tail is (2,4) or something.\n\nPositions after turn 69 move: [ (5,5) ] + [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] since last (1,4) is removed.\n\nOriginal after turn 68: 17 segments including head.\n\nAfter move without eating, head moves, tail removed, so 16 segments.\n\nThen turn 69: move to new head, tail removed again, 15 segments, and so on.\n\nBut when I eat, tail doesn't remove, so length increases.\n\nBut for now, when moving to (5,5) on turn 69, no eat, so positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nTail at (2,4).\n\n(5,6) is free.\n\nThen turn 70: move to (5,6), new head (5,6), body: [ (5,6) ] + [ (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] and tail (2,4) removed, so (3,4) is last? Positions: after turn 69, 16 segments: indices from head to tail: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) — (3,4) is tail? After turn 69, positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), ..., up to (3,4), and (2,4) was the last before, but after turn 69 move, (2,4) is not included, tail is (3,4).\n\nList: after turn 69 move: [ (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] so 16 positions, tail at (3,4).\n\nThen turn 70: move to (5,6), new head (5,6), body: [ (5,6) ] + [ (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) ] and tail (3,4) removed, so positions: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n\n(5,6) is head, (3,3) tail.\n\nThen turn 71: move to (4,6), which is eating, so head to (4,6), and since eating, tail does not move, so new positions: [ (4,6) ] + [ (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) ] so length 17 again, tail at (3,3).\n\nNo collision, since (4,6) was free.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nIf I go to (6,5) first on turn 68, then to (5,5) on turn 69, then to (5,6) on turn 70, then to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut going to (5,4) first might be better because it avoids going up to (6,5) which is closer to wall.\n\nFrom (6,5), if I go left to (5,5), same as before.\n\nBut (6,5) is at x=6, which is near right wall, x=7 wall, so limited on right.\n\nWhereas (5,4) is more central.\n\nAlso, after eating at (4,6), I can explore other areas.\n\nBut no other food, so I need to survive.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if moving Left or Up has different risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but it's not in the way.\n\nNow, for the turn 68 move, I think both are ok, but moving Left to (5,4) is directly towards the food, so better.\n\nIf I move Up to (6,5), I might be able to go to other places, but no other food.\n\nSo I think Left is better.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan to go to (5,5), (5,6), (4,6).\n\nBut I need to output the actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions from turn 68 onwards for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide actions for at least 5 turns, but since the food is eaten on turn 71, which is t1+3, and after that, I need to survive.\n\nt1=68, turn 71 is t1+3.\n\nAfter eating on turn 71, I need to move to avoid colliding.\n\nFor example, after head at (4,6) after eating on turn 71, direction was Up (since moved up to (4,6)).\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves: Up to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; Down to (4,5); Left to (3,6); Right to (5,6) but (5,6) is now body, since after eating, positions include (5,6) as body segment.\n\nAfter turn 71: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), etc.\n\nSo (5,6) is occupied, so cannot go Right.\n\nLeft to (3,6): (3,6) should be free, not in positions.\n\nDown to (4,5): (4,5) is also body, since in positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), ... and (4,3) is there, but (4,5)? After turn 71 positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n\n(4,5) is not in list, so free? Let's see: from above, positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is not occupied, free.\n\n(3,6) free.\n\n(4,7) wall.\n\nSo from (4,6), after moving there, direction Up, so possible moves: Down to (4,5), Left to (3,6), or Right to (5,6) but occupied, invalid.\n\nUp to (4,7) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only Down or Left.\n\nDown to (4,5) or Left to (3,6).\n\nIf I go Down to (4,5), that might be towards the body, but (4,5) is free now, but after moving, it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly, Left to (3,6) is open.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nSince I have to provide actions, I can plan up to turn 73 or so.\n\nBut first, for turn 68, I think moving Left to (5,4) is fine.\n\nThen turn 69: to (5,5) Up\n\nTurn 70: to (5,6) Up\n\nTurn 71: to (4,6) Left? From (5,6) to (4,6) is Left, and direction was Up, so Left is allowed.\n\nThen eaten.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 72, head at (4,6), direction Left (since moved Left to (4,6)).\n\nThen possible moves: from (4,6), direction Left.\n\nCannot move Right (opposite), so can move Left to (3,6), Up to (4,7) invalid, Down to (4,5), or Right invalid.\n\nSo Left to (3,6) or Down to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is free, (4,5) free.\n\nIf I go Left to (3,6), then direction Left.\n\nThen from there, I can go Left to (2,6), Down to (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,6) might be free.\n\nTo avoid walls, (3,6) is safe.\n\nIf go Down to (4,5), then to (4,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is near the body, but should be ok.\n\nSince no food, I just need to stay alive.\n\nPerhaps going Left to (3,6) is better, as it's away from the dense body area.\n\nSimilarly, I can plan a safe path.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide the actions.\n\nNow, back to turn 68.\n\nIf I move Up to (6,5), similar, but I might be near the wall.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), go Left to (5,5) on turn 69, then to (5,6) on turn 70, then to (4,6) on turn 71.\n\nThen on turn 72, at (4,6), same as before.\n\nBut from (6,5), it takes the same number of moves, but I started from a position closer to wall.\n\nMoving Left to (5,4) seems better initially.\n\nMoreover, if I move Left, I can potentially go to (4,4) or other cells.\n\nBut for now, I think Left is fine.\n\nThen for the actions:\n\nTurn 68: L (left to (5,4))\n\nTurn 69: U (up to (5,5))\n\nTurn 70: U (up to (5,6))\n\nTurn 71: L (left to (4,6)) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 72, from (4,6) direction Left, I need to move, say to (3,6) or Down.\n\nTo be safe, go Left to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 73, from (3,6) direction Left, can go Left to (2,6), Down to (3,5), or Up to (3,7) invalid, Right to (4,6) body, invalid.\n\nSo Left or Down.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide up to turn 73 or so.\n\nt1=68, so 5 turns: 68 to 72 or 73.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps I can output for turns 68 to 72.\n\nIn the sequence.\n\nFirst, confirm if moving Left on turn 68 is ok.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nFor example, when moving to (5,4), is (5,4) safe? Yes, not wall, not body.\n\nThen to (5,5), safe.\n\nTo (5,6), safe.\n\nTo (4,6), safe.\n\nAfter that, moving to (3,6) on turn 72.\n\n(3,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, turn 73, from (3,6) I can go Down to (3,5), for example.\n\n(3,5) should be free.\n\nAfter turn 71, positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (3,6) free, (3,5) free, etc.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIf I had moved Up on turn 68, it might work but less efficient.\n\nSo I think L on turn 68.\n\nThen U on 69, U on 70, L on 71.\n\nThen for turn 72, say L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 73, D to (3,5) or something.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other, I can just move safely.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nSo for the answer, I can write:\n\nTurn 68: L\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: L\n\nAnd then for turn 72 and 73, I need to provide as well, since thinking ahead.\n\nBut the format might require multiple turns.\n\nI can stop after eating, but better to show survival.\n\nSince after turn 71, I ate, and grid is open, I can move around.\n\nFor example, on turn 72, from (4,6) dir Left, move L to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 73, from (3,6) dir Left, move D to (3,5)\n\nTurn 74, from (3,5) dir Down? Moved Down, so dir Down, then can move D to (3,4), but (3,4) might be body? After turn 73, let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think providing up to turn 72 is fine, or 73.\n\nBut let's see the minimum.\n\nThe state is turn 68, and I need actions from there.\n\nIn the boxed, I should list from turn 68 onwards for several turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: 68 to 72.\n\nSo actions for 68,69,70,71,72.\n\nFor turn 72, after eating at (4,6) on 71, head at (4,6), dir Left, move to (3,6) L.\n\nThen turn 73 not needed, but if I do 5 turns, up to 72.\n\nt1=68, t1 to t1+4: 68,69,70,71,72.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 68: L\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: L\n\nTurn 72: L (to (3,6))\n\nAnd that should be safe.\n\nIf I moved Up on turn 68, it would be:\n\nTurn 68: U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 69: L to (5,5)\n\nTurn 70: U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 71: L to (4,6)\n\nSame on turn 71.\n\nThen turn 72 same.\n\nBut moving Left first is better.\n\nSo I think L on 68.\n\nNow, in the food, (1,5) has value 1, but I can't eat, so only one point from (4,6).\n\nBut that's fine.\n\nSo final decision.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 68):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (6,4) moving Up. Positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)] (length 17).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 71).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 73).\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n- **Food at (1,5)**: Currently under the tail. To eat it, the tail must move away, and the head must reach it. However, the Manhattan distance from the head (6,4) to (1,5) is 6. After the turn 68 move, the head will be at either (6,5) or (5,4), both 5 moves from (1,5). With only 3 turns (69–71) available to eat it before it disappears, it is impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 71. Thus, this food is unreachable and ignored.\n- **Food at (4,6)**: Free and reachable in 4 moves from (6,4). The earliest eating turn is 71. Life span allows eating until turn 73.\n- **Movement Options on Turn 68**: \n  - Current direction: Up. Possible moves: \n    - Up to (6,5): Valid, but closer to top wall (y=7), which may limit future moves.\n    - Left to (5,4): Valid, closer to (4,6) and more central, reducing risk.\n    - Right to (7,4): Invalid (wall).\n    - Down: Invalid (opposite direction).\n  - **Optimal on Turn 68**: Left to (5,4). This move starts the path toward (4,6), avoids walls, and has fewer body constraints.\n- **Path to (4,6)**:\n  - From (5,4) after turn 68:\n    - Turn 69: Move Up to (5,5) (safe, free cell).\n    - Turn 70: Move Up to (5,6) (safe, free cell).\n    - Turn 71: Move Left to (4,6) (eat food, snake grows to length 18).\n- **Post-Eating Survival (Beyond Turn 71)**:\n  - After eating at (4,6) on turn 71, head direction is Left. Possible moves:\n    - Up to (4,7): Invalid (wall).\n    - Down to (4,5): Valid and free.\n    - Left to (3,6): Valid and free, away from body.\n    - Right to (5,6): Invalid (occupied by body).\n  - **Optimal on Turn 72**: Left to (3,6) to avoid dense body areas and explore open space.\n  - On turn 73, from (3,6) direction Left, move Down to (3,5) to continue safe navigation.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan Prioritizing Survival and Scoring:**\n- **Turn 68**: Move Left to (5,4) to initiate path to (4,6) and avoid walls.\n- **Turn 69**: Move Up to (5,5) to continue toward (4,6).\n- **Turn 70**: Move Up to (5,6) to position for eating.\n- **Turn 71**: Move Left to (4,6) to eat positive food (+1 score, length 18).\n- **Turn 72**: Move Left to (3,6) to survive and explore safely.\n- **Turn 73**: Move Down to (3,5) to maintain mobility (beyond immediate 5 turns for completeness).\n\nThis plan eats the +1 food at (4,6) safely, avoids all collisions, and ensures long-term survival by moving to open areas. The unreachable food at (1,5) is correctly ignored.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 69: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 70: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 71: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 72: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 73: D (down)\n}",

        "step": 69,
        "score": 16,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 69, and I'm the snake AI. I must think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (1,1) to (6,6) for playable cells, but walls are at the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is Left, meaning it was moving left to (5,4) from (6,4), I assume? Positions are given head first: [(5,4), (6,4), ...], so from (6,4) it moved left to (5,4), so current head direction is L.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 3. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 69, it has 2 turns left? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn including current, so at turn 69, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, for food at (1,5), life_span=3 on turn 69. That means:\n\n- On turn 69, countdown = 3\n\n- After turn 69, countdown = 2 (so still present on turn 70)\n\n- After turn 70, countdown = 1 (present on turn 71)\n\n- After turn 71, countdown = 0, disappears, not present on turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,6), life_span=5, so it will last until turn 73 (since turn 69 + 5 - 1? Let's see:\n\n- Turn 69: countdown=5\n\n- Turn 70: countdown=4\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 73: countdown=1 (present)\n\n- Turn 74: countdown=0, disappears.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn including current, so N turns means it appears for N turns starting from the turn it's listed.\n\nFor food with life_span N at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1, inclusive. Disappears at turn t + N.\n\nSo for (1,5): life_span 3 at turn 69, so exists on turns 69, 70, 71. Disappears on turn 72.\n\nFor (4,6): life_span 5, exists on turns 69,70,71,72,73. Disappears on turn 74.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer format should be actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I have to think at least 5 turns ahead. Since it's turn 69, I should plan for turns 69,70,71,72,73, and beyond if possible, but the format might expect a sequence of actions.\n\nThe answer format says: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 69.\n\nBut I need to decide how many turns to output. It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output can be for several turns. I should output at least 5 actions or until a decision point.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\nHead: (5,4)\n\nThen: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nSo the snake body occupies: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nAnd head at (5,4), so all these are occupied.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) and (4,6).\n\n(1,5) is one cell above (1,4), which is the tail? Tail is at (1,4), since positions end with (1,4).\n\nSnake positions: head first to tail last. So tail is (1,4).\n\n(1,5) is directly above (1,4), at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n\nNow, head is at (5,4), moving left, so from (6,4) to (5,4).\n\nCurrent possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so I cannot move R (right), but I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down).\n\nNow, let's see what cells are around head (5,4):\n\n- Left: (4,4) — is this free?\n\n(4,4) is not in the snake positions, and not a wall. Walls are borders and (5,2), so (4,4) should be free.\n\n- Up: (5,5) — should be free, not occupied or wall.\n\n- Down: (5,3) — let's see, (5,3) is not in snake positions? Snake has (5,4), (5,1), but not (5,3) or (5,2) since (5,2) is obstacle.\n\n(5,2) is internal obstacle, so (5,3) should be free, unless occupied.\n\nSnake positions: from above, (5,4) is head, then (6,4), (6,3), etc., no (5,3) listed, so (5,3) is free.\n\n- Right: (6,4) but (6,4) is the first body segment, and since head is moving away, it might be possible to move there? But right is opposite direction, and no instant reverse, so I cannot move right to (6,4) because current direction is left, moving right would be opposite.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction, so R is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,4): L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3).\n\nNow, I need to think about the food and risks.\n\nFirst, food at (1,5): value +1, life span 3 at turn 69, so it will disappear after turn 71.\n\n(1,5) is adjacent to tail at (1,4), since (1,4) and (1,5) are one cell apart vertically.\n\nBut tail is at (1,4), and (1,5) is above it.\n\nNow, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nBut here, the food is at (1,5), not on the tail cell. The tail cell is (1,4), which has no food.\n\nThe danger is when the food is on the tail cell itself, and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail occupy the same cell or adjacent in a way that causes collision? Let's read.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nWhen you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added where the tail was, so the head moves to the food cell, and the tail stays put, meaning that after eating, the tail segment remains, and a new segment is added, so the snake length increases by one, but the tail position doesn't change immediately? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail extends; the tail doesn't move that turn, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn snake, normally, each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward one cell, so the snake moves.\n\nIf you eat food, then the head moves to the food cell, but the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, after eating, the new tail is where the old tail was, and the head is at the food cell.\n\nNow, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail, and there is food on the tail cell, then if you eat that food, the head moves to the tail cell (which had food), and since you eat, the tail doesn't move, so now head and tail are on the same cell? But the tail cell had food, you eat it, head moves there, and tail stays, but since head moved to the tail cell, and tail is still there, they collide immediately.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nIn this case, for (1,5), the tail is at (1,4), and (1,5) is not the tail cell; it's a different cell. So if I eat (1,5), it should be fine, as long as I don't collide with body.\n\nBut (1,5) is adjacent to tail at (1,4), but since it's not on the tail cell, eating it won't cause that specific danger. The danger only applies if the food is on the tail cell itself.\n\nHere, food is at (1,5), tail at (1,4), so different cells.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is another food.\n\nNow, I need to get to the food, but safely.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid state.\n\nPlayable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is obstacle.\n\nSnake occupies: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nFree cells: all cells not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSo cells: for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (5,2).\n\nOccupied by snake: the list above, 17 cells including head.\n\nTotal playable cells: 6x6=36 minus one obstacle, so 35 cells.\n\nSnake has 17 segments, so 35-17=18 free cells.\n\nBut I don't need to list all, just relevant areas.\n\nFood at (1,5) and (4,6).\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6\n\nHead at (5,4), moving left.\n\nI need to think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, for (1,5): it's at (1,5), and tail is at (1,4), which is directly below it.\n\nTo eat (1,5), I need to move head to (1,5).\n\nCurrently, head at (5,4), so I need to go left to (4,4), then (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,4) is part of snake, yes, (3,4) is in the list, between (2,4) and (3,3)? Positions: ... (3,4), (2,4), (1,4) — so (3,4) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is occupied, etc.\n\nLet's find a path to (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) should be free, not in snake positions.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by snake body.\n\n(3,4) is occupied, so I cannot go there directly.\n\nFrom (4,4), I could go up to (4,5) or down to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied? Snake has (4,3), yes, in positions: (4,3) is there.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3) is between (4,2) and (3,3)? List: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), so (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but occupied, L to (3,4) occupied, R to (5,4) but that's where head was, occupied now, but when moving, the tail moves, so cells become free.\n\nImportant: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed, and the new head position is occupied.\n\nI need to simulate movement.\n\nSince I'm planning multiple turns, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, for turn 69, I need to choose an action.\n\nOptions: L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3).\n\nLet's evaluate each.\n\nAlso, food (1,5) has only 3 turns life, so it disappears after turn 71, meaning I have to eat it by turn 71.\n\nTurn 69,70,71 it exists, so I can eat on turn 69,70, or 71.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) has longer life.\n\nBut (1,5) is closer in terms of turns if I go directly.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nLet's see the area around (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at top-left, y=5, x=1.\n\nTail at (1,4), so if I go to (1,5), I need to approach from above or sides, but x=1 is left border, so only from right or below, but below is tail.\n\nCells around (1,5): left: x=0 wall, right: (2,5), up: (1,6) but y=6, and y=7 is wall, so (1,6) is playable? y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, x=1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, down: (1,4) which is tail.\n\nSo to reach (1,5), I can come from (2,5) or from (1,6), or from (1,4) but (1,4) is occupied.\n\nSince (1,4) is tail, when I move, it might move, freeing the cell.\n\nBut to eat (1,5), I need head at (1,5).\n\nNow, head at (5,4).\n\nLet me sketch a small grid.\n\nLabel rows y=6 to y=1, columns x=1 to 6.\n\ny=6 top, y=1 bottom, like coordinates.\n\nSo:\n\ny=6: (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6)  -- (4,6) has food\n\ny=5: (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5)  -- (1,5) food\n\ny=4: (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4)  -- head at (5,4), and snake: (1,4) tail, (2,4), (3,4), (5,4) head, (6,4) body\n\ny=3: (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3)  -- snake: (3,3), (4,3), (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2) obstacle (6,2)  -- snake: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1)  -- snake: (1,1)? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(1,1) is not listed, so free.\n\nSnake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then (2,2), so (1,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) not listed, free. (1,3) not listed, free.\n\nList all free cells for clarity.\n\nOccupied snake cells: from positions:\n\n- y=4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)  -- (4,4) free\n\n- y=3: (3,3), (4,3), (6,3)  -- (1,3), (2,3), (5,3) free? (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- y=2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2)  -- (1,2) free, (5,2) obstacle\n\n- y=1: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  -- (1,1) free\n\n- y=5: all free except possibly, no snake on y=5 except food, so (1,5) food, not occupied, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) all free\n\n- y=6: (4,6) food, others free.\n\nAlso (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) free on left.\n\nNow back to head at (5,4), turn 69.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Left to (4,4): free\n\n- Up to (5,5): free\n\n- Down to (5,3): free\n\nCannot right.\n\nNow, I need to get to (1,5) soon since it disappears in 3 turns.\n\nPath to (1,5): from (5,4) to (1,5).\n\nOne way: go left to (4,4), then left to (3,4) but (3,4) occupied, so not possible now.\n\nWhen I move, the snake moves, so cells free up.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (4,4) on turn 69, then head to (4,4), and tail moves from (1,4) to where? Current tail is (1,4), and when head moves, tail moves to the next segment.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4)]\n\nSo the segments are connected: head (5,4) to (6,4) to (6,3) etc., down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then up to (2,2), right to (3,2), (4,2), then up to (4,3)? (4,2) to (4,3) is up, then (4,3) to (3,3) left? (4,3) to (3,3) is left? x from 4 to 3, y same, so left. Then (3,3) to (3,4) up, then (3,4) to (2,4) left, then (2,4) to (1,4) left.\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nFor example, if I move head to (4,4) on turn 69:\n\n- Head moves to (4,4)\n\n- Tail (1,4) is removed, and the new tail is (2,2)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4), the new positions: head is (4,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes body, so body: (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), and tail was (1,4) which is removed, so the new tail is (2,4)? Positions: the second segment was (6,4), which is now the first body segment, and so on, up to (2,4), which was previously the second last, now last, so new tail at (2,4).\n\nThe snake has 17 segments. When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so still 17 segments, but positions shift.\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nTail at (2,4).\n\n(1,4) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (5,5), new head (5,5), body: (5,4), (6,4), ... up to (1,4), but tail removed, so new tail at (2,4) or something.\n\nLet's not simulate all yet.\n\nI want to reach (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5.\n\nFrom current position, I can go left or up.\n\nIf I go up to (5,5) on turn 69, then head at (5,5), which is closer to (4,6) food.\n\nBut (1,5) is time-sensitive.\n\nDistance to (1,5): from (5,4) to (1,5) is |5-1|=4 in x, |4-5|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 5, but with obstacles.\n\nShortest path: for example, go left to (4,4), then to (3,4) but occupied, but after move, (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 69 move.\n\nCase 1: Move L to (4,4) on turn 69.\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nNew body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nTail at (2,4)\n\nFree cells: (1,4) is free now, also (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go to (3,4) but (3,4) is still occupied? In new body, (3,4) is the second last, so occupied. Yes, (3,4) is part of body.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied, L to (3,4) occupied, R to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,4) is U to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 70, move U to (4,5).\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTail at (3,4)? Positions: after head to (4,5), body: (4,4), then (5,4), etc., down to (3,4), and tail was (2,4) removed, new tail at (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is now tail.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (1,5) via left.\n\nCells around (4,5): L to (3,5), R to (5,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4) occupied.\n\n(3,5) is free, (5,5) free, (4,6) has food.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5) on turn 70? Turn 70 action.\n\nAfter turn 69 to (4,4), turn 70 to (4,5), now turn 71, I can move from (4,5).\n\nTurn 70: after moving to (4,5), it's turn 70.\n\nThen for turn 71, head at (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), U to (4,6) which has food, or R to (5,5), or D to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo possible: L, U, R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5) on turn 71, head to (3,5)\n\nThen from there, to (2,5) on turn 72, then to (1,5) on turn 73.\n\nBut (1,5) disappears after turn 71, so on turn 72 and 73 it's gone, I can't eat it.\n\n(1,5) exists on turn 69,70,71, so I must eat by turn 71.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) on turn 71, I can go to (2,5) or (1,5) directly if possible, but from (3,5) to (1,5) is not adjacent, so I need to move to (2,5) first or (1,5) directly only if adjacent, which it's not.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,6) or (4,5) occupied.\n\n(2,5) is free.\n\nThen to (1,5) from (2,5) on next turn.\n\nBut on turn 71, at (3,5), move to (2,5) on turn 71? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 69: move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: move to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (4,6) or (5,5)\n\nIf I move to (3,5) on turn 71, then head at (3,5)\n\nThen on turn 72, I can move to (2,5) or (1,5) but (1,5) not adjacent, so only to (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,6)\n\nBut (1,5) is gone after turn 71, so on turn 72 it's not there, so I cannot eat it.\n\nTherefore, by going to (4,4) first, I cannot reach (1,5) by turn 71.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 71, if I go directly to (1,5)? Not possible, not adjacent.\n\nOr from (4,5) I can go up to (4,6) which is food, but that's different food.\n\nBut for (1,5), it seems I cannot reach it in time if I go left first.\n\nWhat if I go up first?\n\nOn turn 69, move U to (5,5)\n\nThen new head (5,5)\n\nNew body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), and tail (1,4) removed, new tail at (2,4)\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: L to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) occupied, U to (5,6)\n\nAll except D should be free.\n\n(4,5) free, (6,5) free, (5,6) free.\n\nTo reach (1,5), I need to go left.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nHead to (4,5)\n\nThen from (4,5) on turn 71, to (3,5), then to (2,5) on turn 72, to (1,5) on turn 73, but (1,5) gone after turn 71, so too late.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 71, I can only reach (2,5) or (3,5), not (1,5) directly.\n\nSo still cannot reach by turn 71.\n\nWhat if I go down on turn 69?\n\nMove D to (5,3)\n\nNew head (5,3)\n\nNew body: (5,4), (6,4), etc., tail removed, new tail at (2,4)\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: L to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied? In new body, (4,3) is occupied.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(4,3) is occupied, so from (5,3), moves: U to (5,4) occupied, D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3) occupied? (6,3) is body.\n\n(6,3) is body, yes.\n\nSo only possible move? U, D, L, R all blocked or occupied?\n\nU to (5,4) occupied, D to (5,2) obstacle, L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3) occupied.\n\nNo possible move! If I go down to (5,3), I die immediately because no free cell to move to.\n\n(5,3) has neighbors: up (5,4) occupied, down (5,2) wall/obstacle, left (4,3) occupied, right (6,3) occupied. Yes, all blocked, so moving down to (5,3) on turn 69 is suicide, not possible.\n\nTherefore, down is invalid for turn 69.\n\nOnly possible moves are left to (4,4) or up to (5,5).\n\nBut from both, I cannot reach (1,5) by turn 71, as per above.\n\nIs there a way to reach (1,5) faster?\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go left to (4,4), then on turn 70, from (4,4) I can only go up to (4,5), as before.\n\nFrom (5,4) up to (5,5), then on turn 70 to (4,5), then same as before.\n\nBut from (4,5) on turn 71, I can go to (3,5), but (1,5) is still two moves away.\n\nUnless I can go directly from somewhere.\n\n(2,5) is free, but I need to be at (2,5) or (1,6) or (1,4) to eat (1,5).\n\n(1,4) is tail, and if I move to (1,4), I might eat if there's food, but no food there.\n\nAnd (1,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nFor example, if I can get to (2,5) by turn 71, then to (1,5) on turn 71, but from current position, how?\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 69, go up to (5,5), then on turn 70, go left to (4,5), then on turn 71, go left to (3,5), but (3,5) to (1,5) not adjacent.\n\nOn turn 71 at (4,5), I can go to (3,5), but that's not (1,5).\n\nOr from (4,5) I can go to (4,6) or (5,5), not to (2,5) directly.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 71 from here.\n\nPerhaps via other cells.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) go up to (5,5), then on turn 70 go up to (5,6), then on turn 71 go left to (4,6) but (4,6) has food, or to (3,6), etc., but not to (1,5).\n\nOr go to (1,6) then down to (1,5), but (1,6) is far.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 70, I can go left to (4,5), then to (3,5) on turn 71, then to (2,5) on turn 72, too late.\n\nSo indeed, I cannot reach (1,5) in time to eat it, since it requires at least 3 moves: to (4,4) or (5,5), then to (4,5) or similar, then to (3,5), then to (2,5), then to (1,5), 4 moves from now, but only 3 turns left, so impossible.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (1,5): minimum Manhattan distance 5 cells, but since I move one cell per turn, it takes at least 4 turns to go from (5,4) to (1,5)? From (5,4) to (1,5) is delta x=4, delta y=1, so min 5 steps? No, Manhattan distance is 5, but since I start at (5,4), moving to adjacent cell each turn, it takes exactly the Manhattan number of turns to reach, but only if path is clear.\n\nHere, with obstacles, it might be more, but even with clear path, from (5,4) to (1,5) is |5-1| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 cells apart, so it takes 5 moves to reach: move 1 to (4,4) or (5,5), move 2 to (3,4) or (4,5), etc., but to (1,5), after 4 moves, I could be at (1,5) if I go directly left and up.\n\nFor example: turn 69: to (4,4), turn 70: to (3,4), but (3,4) occupied, not free.\n\nIf free, turn 71: to (2,4), turn 72: to (1,4), turn 73: to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) gone by turn 72.\n\nIf I go via (5,5): turn 69 to (5,5), turn 70 to (4,5), turn 71 to (3,5), turn 72 to (2,5), turn 73 to (1,5) — too late.\n\nAnd (3,4) is occupied initially, and when I move, it may free up, but not in time.\n\nFor example, on turn 69, if I move to (4,4), (3,4) is still occupied, as it's part of body.\n\nOn turn 70, if I move to (4,5), (3,4) is still occupied until the tail moves.\n\nIn the sequence, (3,4) is freed only when the tail passes, which is later.\n\nIn the body, (3,4) is not near tail; tail is at (1,4), so (3,4) will be freed only after several moves.\n\nFor example, from turn 69 move to (4,4), tail at (2,4), (3,4) is still body.\n\nOn turn 70 move to (4,5), tail at (3,4), so (3,4) freed only when tail moves from it.\n\nAfter turn 70, tail at (3,4), so (3,4) is occupied by tail.\n\nThen on turn 71, if I move from (4,5) to somewhere, tail moves to next, freeing (3,4), but (3,4) is free on turn 71 after tail moves.\n\nBut to reach (1,5), it's not helpful.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (1,5) in time, so I should ignore it and focus on the other food or survival.\n\n(4,6) food has value +1, life span 5, so it exists until turn 73.\n\nI can eat that.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, possible moves for turn 69: L to (4,4) or U to (5,5)\n\nD is invalid as we saw.\n\nIf I go U to (5,5), I am closer to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), head at (5,5) after move.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (4,6) is adjacent? (5,5) to (4,6) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5).\n\n(4,6) is up-left from (5,5), not adjacent directly.\n\nTo reach (4,6), I need to go to (4,5) or (5,6) or (4,6) directly if possible, but from (5,5), I can go to (4,5) or (5,6) or (6,5).\n\nThen from there to (4,6).\n\nFor example, from (5,5) to (4,5) to (4,6) or to (5,6) to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (4,4) first, then U to (4,5) then to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) can be eaten from (4,5), (3,6), (5,6), or (4,7) but y=7 wall, so only (4,5), (3,6), (5,6).\n\nNow, let's think about the tail danger or other risks.\n\nFirst, the snake is long, 17 segments, so the board is crowded, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nAlso, there might be negative food, but in this state, both foods are positive, value 1.\n\nFood: (1,5,3,1) and (4,6,5,1), both value 1, so positive.\n\nNo negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, for turn 69, action.\n\nIf I go up to (5,5), then on turn 70, I can go to (4,5) or (5,6) or (6,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, (5,6) free, (6,5) free.\n\nIf I go to (4,5), then on turn 71, I can go to (4,6) to eat the food, or to (3,5) or (5,5) or (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I go left to (4,4) on turn 69, then I must go up to (4,5) on turn 70, then on turn 71 to (4,6) to eat.\n\nSo either way, I can reach (4,6) by turn 71.\n\nWith U first: turn 69 U to (5,5), turn 70 to (4,5), turn 71 to (4,6) eat.\n\nWith L first: turn 69 L to (4,4), turn 70 U to (4,5), turn 71 U to (4,6) eat.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut after eating, I grow, so I need to have space.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L.\n\nIf I move U, that's not opposite, so ok.\n\nAfter moving U, new head direction is U.\n\nThen I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L, new direction L.\n\nNow, after eating at (4,6), I will be at (4,6), and snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nNow, another thing: the tail is at (1,4), and it will move as the snake moves.\n\nBut since the snake is long, the tail movement might free cells slowly.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I should avoid areas where I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, the top-left area has some free cells, but I need to see.\n\nSince (1,5) will disappear soon, and I can't eat it, I can ignore it.\n\nSo for turn 69, I can choose to go up or left.\n\nIf I go up to (5,5), I am at y=5, which might be better for accessing other areas.\n\nIf I go left to (4,4), I am at (4,4), which is closer to the center or left.\n\nBut (4,4) has only one free move up, to (4,5), as we saw earlier.\n\nThen from (4,5), I have more options.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5), I have options.\n\nNow, let's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, option A: move U on turn 69 to (5,5)\n\nNew head: (5,5)\n\nNew body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nTail at (2,4)  // (1,4) removed\n\nFree cells: (1,4), (1,5), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,3), (2,5), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) food, (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\nNow turn 70: from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), U to (5,6), or R to (6,5)\n\nD to (5,4) occupied.\n\nNow, to reach (4,6) food, I can go to (4,5) first.\n\nSay I move L to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ... down to (2,4), and tail (2,4) removed? Positions: head to (4,5), body: (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nNew tail at (3,4)\n\nFree cells: (2,4) freed, etc.\n\nNow turn 71: from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) to eat the food, or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5) occupied, or D to (4,4) which is free now? (4,4) was free earlier, and not occupied, so free.\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nSo moves: U, L, D, but R occupied.\n\nIf I move U to (4,6), I eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows, so head at (4,6), new segment added, so tail stays at (3,4), and the new positions: head (4,6), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), ... up to (3,4), and since eaten, tail doesn't move, so (3,4) is still there, and a new segment is added at the tail? No.\n\nWhen you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but the tail doesn't move, so the snake length increases.\n\nSo positions: head to (4,6), then the previous head (4,5) becomes neck, and so on, down to tail (3,4), and since eaten, a new segment is added after the tail, so the new tail is the new segment at (3,4)? Let's think.\n\nStandard: the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position is extended.\n\nFor example, before eating, tail at T.\n\nAfter eating at H, head moves to food, and the tail does not move, so T is now the second last segment, and a new segment is added at T, so the new tail is at T.\n\nThen next turn, when moving, the tail moves from T.\n\nIn this case, before turn 71 move, head at (4,5), tail at (3,4).\n\nI move head to (4,6) and eat, so new head at (4,6), body includes (4,5), and the previous body down to (3,4), and since eaten, a new segment is added at (3,4), so the tail is now at (3,4) with an extra segment, but positions: the segment that was tail (3,4) is now the second last, and new tail at (3,4)? No.\n\nThe snake segments: let's say the positions are P0=head, P1, P2, ..., P_k=tail.\n\nAfter moving without eating, head to new, P0 to new, P1 to old P0, ..., P_k removed.\n\nWith eating, head to new, P1 to old P0, ..., P_k to old P_{k-1}, and new segment added at old P_k position, so new tail at old P_k.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,4) ] with (4,5) head, (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6) and eating: new head (4,6), then the previous head (4,5) becomes first body, then (5,5), etc., all segments shift, but since eaten, the tail (3,4) does not move, so it remains, and a new segment is added at (3,4)? No.\n\nThe tail position is kept, and a new segment is added there.\n\nSo the new positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), then (5,5), then (5,4), ..., up to (3,4), and then a new segment at (3,4), so (3,4) is duplicated? That can't be.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nTypically, when the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, meaning that the tail segment stays in place, so the length increases by one, with the new segment being the old tail position.\n\nBut in terms of cells, the tail cell is occupied, and after eating, it remains occupied, and the new head position is occupied.\n\nFor example, positions: before move, head at A, tail at Z.\n\nMove head to B (food), eat: new head at B, the body includes A, and Z remains, so positions: B, A, ..., Z, and since length increases, Z is still there, but Z was the tail, now it's not tail, new tail is Z? No.\n\nAfter moving to B and eating, the segments are: new head B, then the old head A, then the old neck, ..., down to old tail Z, and since eaten, a new segment is added after Z, so the new tail is at Z? But Z is already occupied.\n\nThe new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't move, the position Z is not freed, and a new segment is placed at Z, which is the same cell, so it's still one cell, but the snake has an extra segment.\n\nI think I'm messing up.\n\nStandard implementation: when snake eats, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, but the tail does not advance, so the cell that would have been freed is not freed, and the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n\nSo the position of the tail remains the same, but it is now followed by a new segment at the same position? No.\n\nAt the end of the turn, after moving head to new position, if food eaten, the tail position does not change, so the snake occupies one more cell.\n\nIn terms of positions, the list has one more element.\n\nBefore move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pn] with P0 head, Pn tail.\n\nAfter move without eating: new positions [new_head, P0, P1, ..., P_{n-1}]\n\nAfter move with eating: new positions [new_head, P0, P1, ..., Pn]  // Pn is still there, not removed.\n\nSo the tail is now Pn, which was the old tail, and the new segment is added at the end.\n\nFor example, before: head at A, tail at Z, positions [A, B, C, ..., Z]\n\nAfter moving head to F (food) and eating: new positions [F, A, B, C, ..., Z] so head F, tail Z.\n\nThen next turn, when moving, tail will move from Z.\n\nIn this case, for our situation:\n\nBefore turn 71 move: head at (4,5), positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] tail (3,4)\n\nMove head to (4,6) and eat: new positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] so head (4,6), tail (3,4), length 18 now.\n\nBack to turn 69 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) on turn 69, then on turn 70 I can move to (4,5), then on turn 71 to (4,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (4,4) on turn 69, then on turn 70 to (4,5), turn 71 to (4,6) eat.\n\nSame outcome.\n\nBut after eating at (4,6), I am at (4,6), with head direction U (since I moved up to (4,6)).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6): U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (4,5) occupied; L to (3,6); R to (5,6)\n\nSo I can go L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\n(3,6) and (5,6) should be free.\n\nNow, the board has free cells, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nIf I go L to (4,4) first, on turn 69, after moving to (4,4), head direction L.\n\nThen turn 70 to (4,5), direction U (since up from (4,4)).\n\nThen turn 71 to (4,6), direction U.\n\nSame as above.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nIn the first case, when I move U first, after turn 69, tail at (2,4)\n\nAfter turn 70 to (4,5), tail at (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 71 eat at (4,6), tail at (3,4) still, as above.\n\nSimilarly with L first.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating at (4,6), I can go to (3,6) or (5,6).\n\nThe area on the left has more free cells, like (1,1) to (1,5), (2,3), etc.\n\nFor example, (3,6) is at left, (5,6) at right.\n\nRight side has the snake body, but it will move.\n\nSince the snake is long, I might want to go towards the free areas.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle at (5,2), which might block paths.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nTurn 69 to 73 or so.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, the snake is longer, 18 segments, on a 35-cell grid, so 17 free cells left? 35-18=17 free, but with food disappearing, etc.\n\n(1,5) disappears on turn 72, so one less cell to worry.\n\nBut I should plan a path to stay alive.\n\nFor turn 69, I can choose either U or L.\n\nBut going U to (5,5) might be better because from (5,5) I have more choices on turn 70.\n\nIf I go L to (4,4), on turn 70 I can only go U to (4,5), no choice.\n\nWhereas if I go U to (5,5), on turn 70 I can go to (4,5) or (5,6) or (6,5), so I can choose to delay going to (4,5) if I want.\n\nFor example, I could go to (5,6) first or something.\n\nBut since (4,6) is the only food, and I want to eat it, going to (4,5) is direct.\n\nI could eat it later, but it has life span, but 5 turns, so I have time.\n\nBut eating sooner might be better to free up space or something, but not necessary.\n\nSince I prioritize survival, I should eat when safe.\n\nBut here, eating (4,6) on turn 71 seems safe.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 69.\n\nI need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nLet's decide for turn 69.\n\nI think going up is fine.\n\nTo be safe, let's go up on turn 69.\n\nThen on turn 70, from (5,5), I go to (4,5) to approach food.\n\nThen turn 71 to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen after that, on turn 72, from (4,6), I can go to (3,6) or (5,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, which is top-left area.\n\n(5,6) is top-right.\n\nThe left area has more free cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) until turn 71, (1,6), (2,3), (2,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nRight area has (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), but (6,4), (6,3), etc. are body, will free up.\n\nBut since the tail is at (3,4), and body is compact, moving towards left might be better to explore free space.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but we don't know, so I have to assume only current food.\n\nThe state has only these two food, no new food mentioned, so I think only these.\n\nBut in general, food may spawn, but not specified, so I should plan based on current.\n\nSo after turn 71, head at (4,6), I can go left to (3,6) or right to (5,6).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then from there I can go down to (3,5) or left to (2,6) or up to (3,7) wall, so to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is free, (3,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,6), to (5,5) occupied or (6,6) or (5,7) wall, so to (6,6) or down to (5,5) occupied, so only (6,6) if free.\n\n(6,6) should be free.\n\nThen from (6,6), to (6,5) or (5,6) occupied or (7,6) wall, so to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) might be free or not.\n\nIn the long run, the left side has a larger open area.\n\nFor example, cells (1,1) to (1,6), (2,1) to (2,6) except some occupied, but many free.\n\nWhereas right side has the snake body along x=6 and below.\n\nSo going left might be better for survival.\n\nTherefore, after eating, I should go to (3,6).\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 69: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 70: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: U to (4,6) eat food\n\nThen turn 72: L to (3,6)\n\nNow, on turn 72, after moving to (3,6), what next.\n\nBut I need to output actions, so I can output up to there or more.\n\nThe food (1,5) is gone, so no issue.\n\nNow, from (3,6) on turn 72, I can move to (2,6) or (3,5) or (4,6) occupied.\n\n(2,6) and (3,5) free.\n\nI can go to (2,6) to explore left.\n\nThen to (1,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but for now, let's output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 69,70,71,72.\n\nBut on turn 69, if I move L to (4,4), it also works, but I have less choice on turn 70.\n\nSo U seems better.\n\nAlso, moving U changes direction to up, which might be useful.\n\nNow, about the tail danger: not relevant here.\n\nAnother risk: if I go to (4,6), and the tail is at (3,4), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for turn 69, action U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nTurn 69 to 73 or so.\n\nAfter turn 72 at (3,6), I can plan turn 73.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nThen turn 70: from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) eat\n\nNow turn 72: from (4,6), move L to (3,6)\n\nNow on turn 72, after move to (3,6), head direction L (since left from (4,6)).\n\nPositions: after eating on turn 71, head at (4,6), tail at (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 72, move to (3,6): head to (3,6), and tail moves.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,4) ] tail (3,4)\n\nMove head to (3,6): since no eat, new head (3,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., and tail (3,4) removed, new tail depends.\n\nThe segment after head: from (4,6) to (4,6), then (4,5), etc., down to the one before tail.\n\nPositions: let's say [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] tail (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,6) without eating: new positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) ] new tail (3,3)\n\nNow head at (3,6)\n\nTurn 73: from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) wall, invalid; D to (3,5); L to (2,6); R to (4,6) occupied.\n\nSo D to (3,5) or L to (2,6)\n\nBoth free.\n\nI can go L to (2,6) to continue left.\n\nThen to (1,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\nSince I need to output, let's say for turn 73: L to (2,6)\n\nBut I should think if there is risk.\n\n(3,5) is free, (2,6) free.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nSimilarly, later I can go down to (2,5) or to (1,6).\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output up to turn 73.\n\nNow, for the initial move, I think U is better.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about (1,5), but I can't eat it, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,6) later, but it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 71: U (to (4,6) eat)\n\nTurn 72: L (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 73: L (to (2,6)) or D, but I said L.\n\nTo be consistent, go left.\n\nAfter (2,6), I can go to (1,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\nBut for now, this should be ok.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 70, when at (5,5), I move L to (4,5), but I could move elsewhere, but I chose to go to food.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I must plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 69 to 73) while considering the grid state, food life spans, and movement constraints. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,6) with value +1 before it disappears after turn 73.\n- Avoid the food at (1,5) as it is impossible to reach by turn 71 (its disappearance turn) due to distance and obstacles, and attempting it risks trapping the snake.\n- Prioritize paths that open up free space for future movement to avoid collisions.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 69)\n- **Snake head**: At (5,4), moving left (L).\n- **Possible moves from (5,4)**:\n  - **Left (L) to (4,4)**: Free cell, but leads to limited options on turn 70 (only up to (4,5) is safe).\n  - **Up (U) to (5,5)**: Free cell, provides more flexibility on turn 70 (can move left, up, or right).\n  - **Down (D) to (5,3)**: Invalid—all adjacent cells are occupied or blocked, causing immediate death.\n- **Food priorities**:\n  - (1,5): Life span 3, disappears after turn 71. Manhattan distance from head is 5, and with body/wall obstacles, it cannot be reached in ≤3 turns without risking death. Ignore this food.\n  - (4,6): Life span 5, disappears after turn 73. Reachable in 3 turns (by turn 71) via a safe path.\n- **Risks**: The snake is long (17 segments), so crowded areas like the right side (x=5-6) must be avoided. Moving left or up toward the open top-left area (e.g., (1,1)-(2,6)) is safer for long-term survival.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 69-73)\n1. **Turn 69: Move Up (U) to (5,5)**  \n   - Why: Avoids the dead end from moving down and provides more options than moving left. Positions the snake closer to (4,6) and the open top-left area. Head direction changes to Up.\n\n2. **Turn 70: Move Left (L) to (4,5)**  \n   - Why: Advances toward (4,6) and avoids the crowded right side. (4,5) is free, and this move sets up the food capture. Head direction is now Left (from (5,5) to (4,5)).\n\n3. **Turn 71: Move Up (U) to (4,6)**  \n   - Why: Eats the positive food at (4,6). Snake grows to 18 segments, and tail remains at (3,4). Head direction is Up.\n\n4. **Turn 72: Move Left (L) to (3,6)**  \n   - Why: After eating, the top-left area has more free space for maneuver. (3,6) is free and avoids potential traps. Head direction is Left.\n\n5. **Turn 73: Move Left (L) to (2,6)**  \n   - Why: Continues into the open top-left area. (2,6) is free, and this path maximizes future options (e.g., moving to (1,6) or (2,5) on later turns). Head direction remains Left.\n\n### Long-Term Survival Considerations\n- **Beyond turn 73**: The path to (2,6) opens access to free cells like (1,6), (2,5), and (1,5) (now gone, but adjacent cells are safe). This avoids the dense body segments near x=6 and the obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Risk mitigation**: No tail reward danger (food not on tail) or negative food. Wall and body collisions are avoided by sticking to free cells and planning moves.\n- **Food timing**: (4,6) is eaten early to secure points, and the snake can then focus on exploration for future food spawns.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats +1 food safely, avoids all risks, and positions itself for sustained survival by leveraging the spacious top-left region.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 69: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 70: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 71: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 72: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 73: L (left)\n}",

        "step": 70,
        "score": 16,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 70. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). Let me list these to understand the shape.\n\nHead: (5,5)\n\nThen: (5,4) – so down from head? Head is at (5,5), and next is (5,4), which is directly below, so the head is moving up? But the head direction is given as U (up). Current head direction is U, meaning it moved up to get to (5,5)? Let's see the positions:\n\nPositions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ...] So from (5,4) to (5,5) is up, so yes, head moved up to (5,5), so direction is U.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life span 2\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll are positive food since value is +1.\n\nLife span: for (1,5), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 70, life span is 2, so it will disappear after turn 71? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, if at turn t, life span is L, it will disappear after t + L - 1 turns? For example, at turn t, countdown starts at L, decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, ..., to 0 at turn t+L, and disappears at turn t+L? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it's visible for N turns, so from turn t to t+N-1.\n\nStandard interpretation: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, countdown is N, turn t+1 it's N-1, ..., turn t+N-1 it's 1, and then at turn t+N it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n\nIn the food list, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), so at current turn t=70, for (1,5): life_span=2, so it will be there at turn 70 and 71, disappear at turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life_span=4, so turns 70,71,72,73, disappear at 74.\n\n(1,2): life_span=10, turns 70 to 79, disappear at 80.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), direction U (up), so it can move U, L, or R? But no instant reverse, so since current direction is U, it cannot move D (down). So possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is death.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n\nSnake body: positions given. I need to list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all coordinates:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 6: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 8: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 9: (2,1)\n\n- Segment 10: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 11: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 12: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 13: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 14: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 15: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 16: (2,4)  // this is the tail? Let's count: positions have 17 elements? Indices from 0 to 16.\n\nList with indices:\n\n0: (5,5) head\n\n1: (5,4)\n\n2: (6,4)\n\n3: (6,3)\n\n4: (6,2)\n\n5: (6,1)\n\n6: (5,1)\n\n7: (4,1)\n\n8: (3,1)\n\n9: (2,1)\n\n10: (2,2)\n\n11: (3,2)\n\n12: (4,2)\n\n13: (4,3)\n\n14: (3,3)\n\n15: (3,4)\n\n16: (2,4)  // yes, tail is (2,4)\n\nSnake length: 17 segments.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,5): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 71 or lost.\n\n- (4,6): value +1, life span 4, eaten by turn 73\n\n- (1,2): value +1, life span 10, eaten by turn 79\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is occupied by the snake? Snake positions: segment 10 is (2,2), segment 9 is (2,1), etc. (1,2) is not in snake positions, so it's free. Similarly, (1,5) is at (1,5), not occupied, and (4,6) at (4,6), not occupied.\n\nBut (1,2) has life span 10, so no rush.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. But since it's borders, any move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake body: let's list all occupied cells:\n\n(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)\n\nNow, food: (1,5), (4,6), (1,2)\n\nHead at (5,5), direction U, so possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (5,6)\n\n- Left (L): to (4,5)\n\n- Right (R): to (6,5)\n\nCannot down, reverse.\n\nNow, check if these are safe:\n\n(5,6): y=6, not 7, so not wall. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,6) not in list, so free. (5,6) is within bounds, x=5, y=6, y=7 is wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5, not wall. Occupied? Not in snake positions.\n\n(6,5): x=6,y=5, not wall (x=7 is wall, so x=6 ok). Occupied? Not in positions.\n\nAll three moves seem safe immediately, but I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (1,5) is close, at (1,5), head at (5,5), so same row, left.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is up-left from head? Head (5,5), (4,6) is left and up.\n\n(1,2) is far, at (1,2).\n\nNow, (1,5) has short life, only 2 turns including current, so if not eaten now or next turn, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 70, life span 2, so can be eaten at turn 70 or 71.\n\nSimilarly, others have more time.\n\nSo I should consider going for (1,5) since it's urgent.\n\nBut is it safe? And I need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving left to (4,5). That might be towards (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, head at (5,5), so to reach (1,5), need to move left multiple times.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5), then from there, possible moves.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nCurrent snake body: let's see the area.\n\nAlso, tail is at (2,4), which is near (1,5)? (1,5) and (2,4) are adjacent? (1,5) to (2,4): Δx=1, Δy=-1, not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, distance 1.\n\n(1,5) adjacent to (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5). Since walls, (0,5) invalid, (1,6) might be valid.\n\n(2,5) is empty? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (2,5) or (1,5), so free.\n\nBut (2,4) is tail.\n\nNow, if I go for (1,5), from (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 71, head at (4,5), direction? If I move L, direction L, then to (3,5)? (3,5) is free? Snake positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), no (3,5), so free.\n\nThen to (2,5), which should be free.\n\nThen to (1,5) at turn 72? But (1,5) disappears after turn 71? Life span.\n\nAt turn 70, life span 2: present at turn 70 and 71, disappear at turn 72.\n\nSo to eat at turn 71, I need to be at (1,5) at turn 71.\n\nCurrent turn 70: head at (5,5)\n\nIf I move directly left, to (4,5) at turn 70.\n\nThen turn 71, from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5), but (1,5) is at (1,5), so I need two more moves: to (3,5) then to (2,5), then to (1,5) at turn 72? But at turn 72, food is gone, since disappear at turn 72.\n\nTurn timeline:\n\n- Turn 70: food (1,5) life span 2, so available at turn 70 and 71.\n\n- Turn 71: life span decreases to 1, still available.\n\n- Turn 72: life span 0, disappears, not available.\n\nSo to eat, must be on (1,5) at turn 70 or turn 71.\n\nAt turn 70, head at (5,5), (1,5) is four cells away (since x-difference 4), so impossible to reach in one move. Minimum distance: from (5,5) to (1,5) is |5-1|=4 in x, same y, so 4 cells away, need at least 4 moves to reach. So cannot eat at turn 70.\n\nCan only eat at turn 71 if I can reach in one move, but it's 4 away, so impossible. Moves are one cell per turn, so from (5,5) to (1,5) is 4 steps, so earliest arrival at turn 73? Turn 70: move to adjacent, say (4,5) or (5,6), etc.\n\nTurn 70: at (5,5)\n\nAfter move, at turn 71, head at new position.\n\nTo reach (1,5), which is at distance |5-1| + |5-5| = 4, so minimum 4 turns from turn 70.\n\nTurn 70: start at (5,5)\n\nTurn 71: after first move, at say (4,5) if L\n\nTurn 72: at (3,5) if L again\n\nTurn 73: at (2,5)\n\nTurn 74: at (1,5)\n\nBut at turn 74, food is long gone; it disappears at turn 72.\n\nAvailable only up to turn 71.\n\nAt turn 71, I can be at a cell adjacent to (1,5), but to eat, I need to be on (1,5) at turn 71.\n\nFrom turn 70 position, after one move, I can be at (4,5), (5,6), or (6,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), (1,5) is still 3 cells away, so at turn 71, I can move to (3,5), which is 2 cells away, not on (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, from other positions, I can't reach (1,5) by turn 71.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (1,5) because it's too far and life span too short. Distance 4, life span 2 including current turn, so only one more turn, but I need 4 moves, impossible.\n\nConfirming: at turn 70, I am at (5,5), food at (1,5). To move to (1,5), I need to decrease x by 4, each move left decreases x by 1, so 4 moves. After 4 moves, at turn 74, but food gone after turn 71. So yes, cannot eat it. It will disappear unused.\n\nSo (1,5) is not reachable in time. Ignore it.\n\nNow, next food: (4,6), at (4,6), life span 4, so available until turn 73 (turns 70,71,72,73, disappear turn 74).\n\nHead at (5,5), (4,6) is adjacent? (5,5) to (4,6): Δx=-1, Δy=+1, not adjacent; adjacent cells share row or column.\n\n(4,6) is left and up from (5,5).\n\nDistance: |5-4|=1 in x, |5-6|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 2.\n\nI can reach in 2 moves.\n\nFor example, move left to (4,5), then up to (4,6).\n\nOr move up to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nBoth possible in 2 moves.\n\nSince life span 4, I have until turn 73 to eat it, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to consider the path and future moves.\n\nAnother food: (1,2), at (1,2), life span 10, so available until turn 79, no rush.\n\nNow, snake head direction U, at (5,5).\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each option with lookahead.\n\nFirst, move Up (U) to (5,6):\n\nAt (5,6), what is there? Not food, not wall, not body, so safe.\n\nThen direction becomes U.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U, L, R (cannot D, reverse).\n\nU to (5,7): but y=7 is wall, so invalid, death.\n\nL to (4,6): (4,6) is food! Positive food.\n\nR to (6,6): should be free? Check.\n\n(6,6): not wall, x=6<7, y=6<7, ok. Occupied? Snake: (6,4), (6,3), etc., no (6,6), so free.\n\nBut (4,6) is food, so moving L from (5,6) to (4,6) would eat the food.\n\nBut I need to see if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, after eating, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nBut also, need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, tail position: tail is at (2,4) now.\n\nWhen I eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut in terms of collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is food, it eats, then snake body moves, but head moves first to the cell, if food, it is eaten, then the tail does not move, so snake length increases by one.\n\nCollision: after head moves, before the body moves, if head is on a body segment except the tail, it dies, because tail will move away.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is body except the tail, collision. If tail, and tail moves away, no collision.\n\nBut here, special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, the food is not on tail, it's free.\n\n(4,6) is not tail, it's free cell.\n\nSo moving to (4,6) should be safe.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nIf at turn 70, I move U to (5,6).\n\nThen at turn 71, head at (5,6), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) invalid (wall), L to (4,6) which is food, R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move L to (4,6), I eat the food at (4,6).\n\nThen snake grows: new head at (4,6), body: previous head (5,6) becomes new segment 1, then the rest, but tail remains, so positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), then previous (5,5) which was head, now segment 2? Let's list.\n\nBefore move turn 70: positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (2,4)]\n\nAfter turn 70 move U to (5,6): new positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (2,4) but tail (2,4) will be there, and since no food eaten, tail moves? When no food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to next position, tail is removed.\n\nStandard: each turn, head moves to new cell, if food, tail stays, else tail moves forward.\n\nIn this case, turn 70: move to (5,6), no food there, so snake moves: head to (5,6), then body: segment 1 (5,4) moves to (5,5), segment 2 (6,4) moves to (5,4)? No.\n\nAfter head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo initial positions turn 70: index 0: (5,5) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (4,2), 13: (4,3), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,4), 16: (2,4) tail.\n\nAfter move U to (5,6): new head position (5,6). Then segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,5). Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,4). But segment 1 was at (5,4), so segment 2 moves to (5,4)? Let's think: the new position of segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i>=1.\n\nNew head: (5,6)\n\nNew segment 1: old head position (5,5)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 position (5,4)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 position (6,4)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 position (6,3)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 position (6,2)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 position (6,1)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 position (5,1)\n\nNew segment 8: old segment 7 position (4,1)\n\nNew segment 9: old segment 8 position (3,1)\n\nNew segment 10: old segment 9 position (2,1)\n\nNew segment 11: old segment 10 position (2,2)\n\nNew segment 12: old segment 11 position (3,2)\n\nNew segment 13: old segment 12 position (4,2)\n\nNew segment 14: old segment 13 position (4,3)\n\nNew segment 15: old segment 14 position (3,3)\n\nNew segment 16: old segment 15 position (3,4)\n\nTail was segment 16 at (2,4), but since no food eaten, tail moves away, so new tail is new segment 16, which is old segment 15 position (3,4), so positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) and tail at (3,4)? New segment 16 is (3,4), and since no growth, that's the tail.\n\nOld segment 15 was (3,4), so new segment 16 is at (3,4).\n\nList: new positions after turn 70 move U:\n\n- Head: (5,6)\n\n- Seg1: (5,5)\n\n- Seg2: (5,4)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (6,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (6,2)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (6,1)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (5,1)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (4,1)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (3,1)  // old seg8\n\n- Seg10: (2,1)  // old seg9\n\n- Seg11: (2,2)  // old seg10\n\n- Seg12: (3,2)  // old seg11\n\n- Seg13: (4,2)  // old seg12\n\n- Seg14: (4,3)  // old seg13\n\n- Seg15: (3,3)  // old seg14\n\n- Seg16: (3,4)  // old seg15\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nNow at turn 71, head at (5,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) invalid (wall), L to (4,6), R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) is food, (6,6) is free.\n\nIf I move L to (4,6), I eat the food.\n\nThen, after move: head to (4,6), since food, snake grows, so tail does not move. New positions: head (4,6), then the body: previous head (5,6) becomes seg1, then the rest as before, but tail stays.\n\nSo: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), ..., up to seg16 (3,4), and since food eaten, add new segment at tail, so new seg17 at (3,4)? No.\n\nWhen food eaten, the tail remains, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), ..., seg16 (3,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,6) and eating food: new head (4,6), then the next segments: seg1 is old head position (5,6), seg2 is old seg1 (5,5), seg3 old seg2 (5,4), ..., seg16 old seg15 (3,3)? Let's index.\n\nOld positions turn 71 before move: index 0: (5,6) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (2,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (4,2), 14: (4,3), 15: (3,3), 16: (3,4) tail\n\nAfter move L to (4,6): new head (4,6). Since food eaten, the body segments move: seg1 new position: old head (5,6), seg2 new: old seg1 (5,5), seg3: old seg2 (5,4), seg4: old seg3 (6,4), ..., up to seg16: old seg15 (3,3), and since food eaten, no tail removed, so a new segment is added at the end, which is the position where tail was, but tail was at old seg16 (3,4), so new seg17 at (3,4)? The segments are renumbered.\n\nNew positions: head (4,6), then:\n\n- Body segment 1: old head (5,6)\n\n- Body segment 2: old seg1 (5,5)\n\n- Body segment 3: old seg2 (5,4)\n\n- Body segment 4: old seg3 (6,4)\n\n- Body segment 5: old seg4 (6,3)\n\n- Body segment 6: old seg5 (6,2)\n\n- Body segment 7: old seg6 (6,1)\n\n- Body segment 8: old seg7 (5,1)\n\n- Body segment 9: old seg8 (4,1)\n\n- Body segment 10: old seg9 (3,1)\n\n- Body segment 11: old seg10 (2,1)\n\n- Body segment 12: old seg11 (2,2)\n\n- Body segment 13: old seg12 (3,2)\n\n- Body segment 14: old seg13 (4,2)\n\n- Body segment 15: old seg14 (4,3)\n\n- Body segment 16: old seg15 (3,3)\n\n- Body segment 17: old tail position (3,4)  // new segment added\n\nSo tail now at (3,4), but it was already there, now it's part of body, and new tail is (3,4), but since added, the snake is longer.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (4,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, back to turn 70 decision.\n\nIf at turn 70 I move U to (5,6), then at turn 71 I can move L to (4,6) to eat food immediately.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? I need to think long-term.\n\nMoving to (4,6) might be good since it's food, but after that, I am at (4,6), and the area might be cramped.\n\nAnother option: at turn 70, move left to (4,5).\n\nThen at (4,5), which is not food.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) to eat food at turn 71.\n\nOr move L to (3,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (6,5) at turn 70, then from there, it might take longer to reach food.\n\nBut (4,6) food can be reached in 2 moves from (5,5): directly via L then U, or U then L.\n\nBut from (5,5), if I move L to (4,5), then U to (4,6) at turn 71.\n\nOr move U to (5,6), then L to (4,6) at turn 71.\n\nBoth sequences get me to eat at turn 71.\n\nNow, which one is better?\n\nI also need to consider the future after eating.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (1,2) to consider later.\n\nBut first, let's see the grid after moving.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (2,4) now, and after moves, it might move.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nNow, if I eat at (4,6) at turn 71, I am at (4,6), with direction depending on how I arrived.\n\nIf I arrived via left, direction L; if via up then left, direction L.\n\nIn both cases, when I move to (4,6), direction is L if I came from right.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (4,6) is left, so direction L.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,6) is up, so direction U.\n\nThen from (4,6), after eating, I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6): U, D, L, R? Direction after move.\n\nIf I came from (5,6) to (4,6) via left, direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nIf I came from (4,5) to (4,6) via up, direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nNow, surrounding cells: (4,6) has neighbors: U (4,7) wall, D (4,5), L (3,6), R (5,6).\n\nBut R (5,6) is body if I just ate, in the positions after eating, (5,6) is body segment, so moving to (5,6) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, if direction U, cannot move D to (4,5), which might be body.\n\nAfter eating at (4,6), positions: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), etc., so (5,6) is occupied, (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nFirst case: if at turn 70 I moved U to (5,6), then turn 71 move L to (4,6) eat.\n\nAfter turn 71, positions as above: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), ..., seg17 (3,4)\n\nSo (4,5) is not in the list? seg2 is (5,5), not (4,5). (4,5) is free? In the positions, after turn 71, the cells are: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), etc., no (4,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) might be free.\n\nFrom (4,6), with direction L (since moved left to get there), so possible moves: U, D, L? Cannot R because reverse.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible: U to (4,7) invalid wall.\n\nD to (4,5), which is free.\n\nL to (3,6), free? (3,6) not in positions, should be free.\n\nR to (5,6) but (5,6) is seg1, body, collision, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf I had arrived from below, direction U, then from (4,6) direction U, cannot move D, so only U or L or R, but U wall, R to (5,6) body, so only L to (3,6).\n\nBut in this case, since I moved left to (4,6), direction L, I can move D or L.\n\nNow, similarly for the other approach.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; back to turn 70.\n\nAt turn 70, I can choose to move U, L, or R.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), then at turn 71, I can eat (4,6) by moving L.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), then at turn 71, I can move U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), then I don't eat immediately.\n\nMoving R might not be good for short-term food.\n\nBut there is also the (1,2) food later.\n\nSince (4,6) is easy to get, I should go for it.\n\nBut let's see if moving to (5,6) first is better or to (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,6), after eating at (4,6), I am at (4,6) with direction L, and can move to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is below, which might lead to the lower area, where there is food at (1,2).\n\n(3,6) is left, towards the left wall.\n\nAfter eating, the snake is longer, 18 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nThe grid has free cells: let's list all free cells to see space.\n\nGrid size 8x8, walls on border, internal obstacle (5,2), and snake occupies 17 cells, so free cells: 64 - 1 (obstacle) - 17 (snake) - 4 walls? Walls are many cells, but for movement, we care about accessible cells.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8=64, but border walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nx from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable, similarly y=1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive? Coordinates: x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable? But y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6, yes.\n\nFor example, (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but (1,1) is not wall, etc.\n\nNumber of playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so 6x6=36 cells.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is within, so obstacle, not playable.\n\nSnake occupies 17 cells.\n\nFood at (1,5), (4,6), (1,2), but (1,5) and (4,6) are playable cells, (1,2) is playable.\n\nPlayable cells: 36 total, minus 1 obstacle, so 35 cells for snake and food.\n\nSnake 17 cells, so 18 free cells including the three food, but food are on free cells.\n\nTotal free space: 35 - 17 = 18 cells, including the 3 food positions.\n\nBut food are on specific cells, so empty cells are 18 - 3 = 15, plus food.\n\nAfter eating food, snake grows, space decreases.\n\nBut for now.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nAt turn 70, moving U to (5,6) or L to (4,5) both lead to eating (4,6) at turn 71.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), then from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4) or L to (5,5), but (5,5) is body after move.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf turn 70 move R to (6,5):\n\nAfter move: head to (6,5), no food, so body moves: new head (6,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), ..., similar to before but now head at (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 71, from (6,5), direction R (since moved right), so can move U, D, R? Cannot L, reverse.\n\nU to (6,6), free? (6,6) should be free.\n\nD to (6,4), but (6,4) is body, after move, seg2 is at (5,4)? Positions after turn 70 move R:\n\nOld: head (5,5), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (6,4), seg3 (6,3), etc.\n\nAfter move R to (6,5): new head (6,5), seg1 old head (5,5), seg2 old seg1 (5,4), seg3 old seg2 (6,4), seg4 old seg3 (6,3), ..., seg16 old seg15 (3,4), tail old tail (2,4) but since no food, tail moves, so new positions: head (6,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), ..., seg15 (3,4), seg16 (2,4)? Old seg15 was (3,4), old seg16 was (2,4), new seg15: old seg14 (3,3)? Let's not.\n\nNew seg1: old head (5,5)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (5,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (6,4)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (6,3)\n\n...\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (3,4)\n\nOld seg15 was (3,4), so new seg16 at (3,4), and tail at (3,4), but old tail was (2,4), which is not occupied now.\n\nSo at turn 71, head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(6,4) is seg3, body, so moving to (6,4) collision.\n\nU to (6,6) should be free.\n\nL to (5,5) but (5,5) is seg1, body, collision, and also cannot reverse direction.\n\nSo only possible move: U to (6,6).\n\nThen at (6,6), no food, etc.\n\nBut this delays eating the food at (4,6), which might not be good, as it has limited life, though still 3 turns left after turn 70.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 70, so available turn 70,71,72,73.\n\nAt turn 70, if I move R, I don't eat, at turn 71 I move to (6,6), still not eating (4,6), so I need to go towards it later.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), I can move L to (5,6) or D to (6,5), but (6,5) is previous position, body.\n\nAfter turn 71 move to (6,6), head at (6,6), then I can move L to (5,6), which might be free or not.\n\nBut it's inefficient to go right now, since (4,6) is close and urgent in a few turns.\n\nLife span 4, so I have until turn 73, so I can take a bit longer, but why risk it?\n\nMoving to (6,5) now might lead me away from other food.\n\nThe other food (1,2) is at (1,2), which is far, and life span 10, so I can go later.\n\nBut the snake body is mostly on the bottom and left, so the top-right is more free.\n\nAfter eating (4,6), I can go towards (1,2).\n\nBut let's compare moving U or L at turn 70.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6) at turn 70, then at turn 71, I move L to (4,6) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 72, I am at (4,6) with direction L, and I can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is free, as per earlier.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go down towards (1,2).\n\n(3,6) is left, which might be dead end if I go to left wall.\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, not wall.\n\nIf I move L to (3,6) at turn 72, then from there, I can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6), etc., but not towards (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is at bottom left, so moving down is better.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 70 I move L to (4,5), then at turn 71 move U to (4,6) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 72, head at (4,6), direction U (since moved up), so cannot move D, can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, R to (5,6) body, so only L to (3,6).\n\nThen I am forced to move left to (3,6), which might not be ideal for reaching (1,2).\n\nWhereas if I had moved U first, after eating I can move down to (4,5).\n\nSo moving U at turn 70 gives me more flexibility after eating.\n\nIn both cases, after eating at turn 71, at (4,6), but the direction and possible moves differ.\n\nCase 1: move U turn 70 to (5,6), then L turn 71 to (4,6) eat, direction L.\n\nThen at turn 72, from (4,6) dir L, can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nCase 2: move L turn 70 to (4,5), then U turn 71 to (4,6) eat, direction U.\n\nThen at turn 72, from (4,6) dir U, can only move L to (3,6), since U and R invalid.\n\nSo in case 1, I have choice to move D or L, in case 2, only L.\n\nTherefore, moving U at turn 70 is better because it allows me to move down after eating, towards the area where (1,2) is.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), so from (4,5), I can move left and down.\n\nNow, if I move R at turn 70, I go to (6,5), then to (6,6), and I might miss the food or take longer.\n\nMoreover, (4,6) might not be reachable later if I go far, but it is, but I should eat it soon.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving.\n\nCurrently tail at (2,4), and as snake moves, tail moves, freeing space.\n\nFor example, if I move, the tail moves away from (2,4), so cells might free up.\n\nBut in the short term, for eating (4,6), it's fine.\n\nSo I think moving U at turn 70 is good.\n\nThen turn 71 move L to eat (4,6).\n\nThen turn 72, from (4,6) dir L, move D to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go left towards (1,2).\n\nNow, let's think about (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), life span 10, so available until turn 79.\n\nHead at (4,5) after turn 72, for example.\n\nDistance: from (4,5) to (1,2) is |4-1|=3 in x, |5-2|=3 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, can reach in 6 moves, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to plan the path considering body and walls.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nNow, after turn 72, if I am at (4,5), direction? Let's trace.\n\nTurn 70: move U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 71: move L to (4,6) eat, now head (4,6), dir L\n\nTurn 72: move D to (4,5), now at (4,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen from (4,5), dir D, so can move D, L, R? Cannot U, reverse.\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nNow, (4,4): is it free? Snake positions after turn 72.\n\nFirst, after turn 71: after eating at (4,6), positions: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,1), seg8 (5,1), seg9 (4,1), seg10 (3,1), seg11 (2,1), seg12 (2,2), seg13 (3,2), seg14 (4,2), seg15 (4,3), seg16 (3,3), seg17 (3,4)  // I think I have the positions.\n\nEarlier after turn 71 eat: head (4,6), body: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), tail (3,4)  // seg17 at (3,4)\n\nNow turn 72 move D to (4,5): no food at (4,5), so head moves to (4,5), body moves: seg1 to old head (4,6), but old head is now body, new seg1 to (4,6), new seg2 to old seg1 (5,6), new seg3 to old seg2 (5,5), ..., up to new seg17 to old seg16 (3,3), and tail moves away, so new tail at (3,3).\n\nPositions: head (4,5), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1), seg11 (3,1), seg12 (2,1), seg13 (2,2), seg14 (3,2), seg15 (4,2), seg16 (4,3), seg17 (3,3) tail? New seg17 is old seg16 (3,3), and since no food, tail removed, so positions from head to seg16: head (4,5), to seg16 (3,3), and tail at (3,3).\n\nList: new head (4,5), new seg1: old head (4,6), new seg2: old seg1 (5,6), new seg3: old seg2 (5,5), new seg4: old seg3 (5,4), new seg5: old seg4 (6,4), new seg6: old seg5 (6,3), new seg7: old seg6 (6,2), new seg8: old seg7 (6,1), new seg9: old seg8 (5,1), new seg10: old seg9 (4,1), new seg11: old seg10 (3,1), new seg12: old seg11 (2,1), new seg13: old seg12 (2,2), new seg14: old seg13 (3,2), new seg15: old seg14 (4,2), new seg16: old seg15 (4,3), and since no food, no new segment, tail was at old seg16 (3,3)? Old seg16 was (3,3), which is now new seg15? Old positions: after turn 71, seg15 was (4,3)? Let's clarify indices.\n\nAfter turn 71 (after eating):\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Seg1: (5,6)\n\n- Seg2: (5,5)\n\n- Seg3: (5,4)\n\n- Seg4: (6,4)\n\n- Seg5: (6,3)\n\n- Seg6: (6,2)\n\n- Seg7: (6,1)\n\n- Seg8: (5,1)\n\n- Seg9: (4,1)\n\n- Seg10: (3,1)\n\n- Seg11: (2,1)\n\n- Seg12: (2,2)\n\n- Seg13: (3,2)\n\n- Seg14: (4,2)\n\n- Seg15: (4,3)\n\n- Seg16: (3,3)\n\n- Seg17: (3,4)  // tail\n\nNow turn 72 move D to (4,5): no food, so head to (4,5), then body: new seg1: old head (4,6), new seg2: old seg1 (5,6), new seg3: old seg2 (5,5), new seg4: old seg3 (5,4), new seg5: old seg4 (6,4), new seg6: old seg5 (6,3), new seg7: old seg6 (6,2), new seg8: old seg7 (6,1), new seg9: old seg8 (5,1), new seg10: old seg9 (4,1), new seg11: old seg10 (3,1), new seg12: old seg11 (2,1), new seg13: old seg12 (2,2), new seg14: old seg13 (3,2), new seg15: old seg14 (4,2), new seg16: old seg15 (4,3), and since no food, tail removed, so no seg17; new tail is new seg16 at (4,3).\n\nOld seg16 was (3,3), old seg17 was (3,4), but new positions: the last segment is new seg16 at old seg15 (4,3), and old seg16 (3,3) is not occupied now, old seg17 (3,4) gone.\n\nSo positions: head (4,5), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1), seg11 (3,1), seg12 (2,1), seg13 (2,2), seg14 (3,2), seg15 (4,2), seg16 (4,3) tail.\n\nNow at (4,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\n(4,4): free? Not in positions.\n\n(3,5): free? Not in positions.\n\n(5,5): seg3, body, collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move U, reverse.\n\nSo can move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n\n(4,4) is down, (3,5) is left.\n\nTo go to (1,2), moving left and down is better.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5) at turn 72.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we need only to decide for a few turns, but the answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nThe output format is to give actions for several turns, e.g., turn 70,71,72,etc.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince the AI should think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nFor now, at turn 70, I think moving U is best.\n\nThen turn 71 move L to eat.\n\nThen turn 72 move D to (4,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (1,2).\n\nBut to be precise, let's outline the next few turns.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: at (4,6), after eating, if I move D to (4,5), it should be fine.\n\nIf I had only L move, it might be riskier.\n\nBut in this case, with U first, I have the option.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 70.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: L (to eat at (4,6))\n\nThen turn 72: D (to (4,5))\n\nThen from turn 72, at (4,5), dir D, can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I can specify up to 3 or 4 turns.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nI should provide a sequence for multiple turns.\n\nSince the state might change, but for now, based on current state.\n\nI think for the first two moves, it's clear, then I need to plan further.\n\nAfter turn 72 at (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) to go left.\n\nThen to (2,5), etc., towards (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is at y=2, x=1.\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), but (2,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's not simulate too far.\n\nI think for the output, I can do:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: L\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nThen, for example, at turn 72, after moving to (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) at turn 73.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince after turn 72, the state changes, but for consistency, I can plan a path.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll provide actions for 3 turns: 70,71,72.\n\nBut thinking 5 turns, so up to turn 74 or 75.\n\nCurrent turn 70, think to turn 75.\n\nBut after actions, state changes.\n\nPerhaps in the context, I should output the actions I would take.\n\nI think U then L then D is good for now.\n\nThen from there, I can head to (1,2).\n\nBut there might be other considerations.\n\nAnother food: (1,5) is gone, as we said.\n\n(1,2) is there.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,2), so when going to (1,2), avoid that.\n\nPath from (4,5) to (1,2): possible moves.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5), then L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), then D to (2,3), then L to (1,3), then D to (1,2)? (1,3) to (1,2) down.\n\nBut need to check if cells are free.\n\nAt turn 72, positions: head (4,5), body as above, (4,6), (5,6), etc., so (3,5) free, (2,5) free, (2,4) might be free? In positions, at turn 72, tail at (4,3), etc., (2,4) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free, (1,3) free, (1,2) food.\n\nSo path is clear.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all now.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output:\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: L\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nThen, for example, turn 73: L (to (3,5))\n\nBut I can stop at turn 72, or provide more.\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\" and it might be multiple lines.\n\nI think providing 3 actions is fine, as thinking ahead is for the decision.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's include up to eating or something.\n\n(4,6) eaten at turn 71.\n\nThen (1,2) to be eaten later.\n\nBut for output, I'll do for turns 70,71,72.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 72 D to (4,5), then at turn 73, I can move L to (3,5), but I don't have to specify.\n\nPerhaps the answer should be the actions starting from current turn.\n\nI think I'm ready.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - The food at (1,5) has a life span of 2 (available until turn 71) but is 4 cells away from the head at (5,5). It is impossible to reach by turn 71, so it is ignored.\n  - The food at (4,6) has a life span of 4 (available until turn 73) and is only 2 cells away (Manhattan distance). Eating it soon is efficient and low-risk.\n  - The food at (1,2) has a life span of 10 (available until turn 79) and is 6 cells away. It can be targeted after eating (4,6) with no urgency.\n\n- **Movement Strategy**:\n  - At turn 70, the head is at (5,5) with direction U. Possible moves are U (to (5,6)), L (to (4,5)), or R (to (6,5)). Moving R (right) delays reaching (4,6) and offers no short-term benefit.\n  - Moving U (up) to (5,6) on turn 70 sets up a direct path to eat (4,6) on turn 71 by moving L (left). This also maintains flexibility for future moves toward (1,2).\n  - Moving L (left) to (4,5) on turn 70 also allows eating (4,6) on turn 71 but restricts post-eating options, as it forces a left move on turn 72 (due to direction constraints), potentially trapping the snake near the left wall.\n  - After eating (4,6), moving D (down) to (4,5) on turn 72 positions the snake to head toward (1,2) safely, avoiding body collisions and leveraging tail movement to free space.\n\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,2) must be avoided when targeting (1,2).\n  - After eating (4,6), the snake grows, reducing free space. Moving down on turn 72 keeps the snake centered and avoids dead ends.\n  - Simulations confirm no collisions or wall hits in the planned sequence.\n\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**:\n  - **Turns 70-71**: Secure (4,6) for +1 score, as it is low-risk and time-sensitive.\n  - **Turns 72-75**: Head toward (1,2) via (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (2,3), ensuring a safe path with body clearance.\n  - **Beyond**: (1,2) can be eaten by turn 76-77, well within its life span.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 70: Move U (up) to (5,6) – Positions for immediate food access and future flexibility.\n- Turn 71: Move L (left) to (4,6) – Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1), with no collision risk.\n- Turn 72: Move D (down) to (4,5) – Avoids walls/body, starts path to (1,2).\n\nThis sequence eats (4,6) efficiently, avoids all risks, and sets up a clear path to (1,2) for further scoring.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: L \\\\\nTurn 72: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 71, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,6), and direction is Up. The body segments are listed: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. Value is +1, so positive food.\n\n- (4,6) with value 1 and life span 3. Positive food, will disappear in 3 turns.\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Positive food, will disappear in 9 turns.\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n\nNow, since the snake head is at (5,6) and direction is Up, moving Up would go to (5,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. Moving Down would go to (5,5), which is the body segment immediately behind the head, but since the tail will move, I need to be careful.\n\nLet me sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,6)\n\nBody: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nList all positions in order:\n\n1. Head: (5,6)\n\n2. (5,5)\n\n3. (5,4)\n\n4. (6,4)\n\n5. (6,3)\n\n6. (6,2) — but (5,2) is an obstacle, so (6,2) is snake, not obstacle.\n\n(6,2) is snake body, (5,2) is wall/obstacle.\n\n7. (6,1)\n\n8. (5,1)\n\n9. (4,1)\n\n10. (3,1)\n\n11. (2,1)\n\n12. (2,2)\n\n13. (3,2)\n\n14. (4,2)\n\n15. (4,3)\n\n16. (3,3)\n\n17. (3,4) — tail? Positions have 17 elements: indices 0 to 16, head is 0, tail is 16 at (3,4).\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,5): value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n\n- (4,6): value 1, life span 3 (disappears in 3 turns, so by turn 74)\n\n- (1,2): value 1, life span 9 (disappears in 9 turns, by turn 80)\n\nCurrent turn is 71.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction Up. But moving Up to (5,7) is invalid since y=7 is wall. So I cannot move Up.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6): Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nBut Up is wall, invalid.\n\nDown: to (5,5) — but (5,5) is the second segment. If I move down, head goes to (5,5), but at that moment, the body is still at (5,5), so it would collide with itself? No, because when the head moves to a cell, if it's occupied by the body, it depends.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nSpecifically, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's only safe if it's the tail segment, and after moving, the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, moving down to (5,5): (5,5) is currently occupied by the second segment, not the tail. The tail is at (3,4). So moving to (5,5) would cause collision because it's not the tail.\n\nLet me confirm the positions:\n\nAt turn 71, before moving:\n\n- Cell (5,6): head\n\n- Cell (5,5): body segment\n\n- Cell (5,4): body segment\n\n- etc.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5), that cell is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, it will still be there after movement? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. The tail segment is left, and if a food was eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nBut for collision, the head collides if it moves into a cell that is part of the body, except that if it moves into the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is only safe if it is the tail cell, because after moving, the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (5,5) is not the tail; it's the segment immediately behind the head. So moving to (5,5) would cause collision because after movement, that cell would still be occupied or something? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt start, positions: [(5,6), (5,5), ...]\n\nIf I move down to (5,5), the head tries to go to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, this is a collision, and the snake dies.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any body cell except the tail is deadly.\n\nNow, tail is at (3,4), which is far away.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,7) - wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (5,5) - occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid\n\n- Left: (4,6) - what is at (4,6)? Is it occupied?\n\nLook at snake positions: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(4,6) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, Right: (6,6) - not in list, should be empty.\n\nBut (6,6) is within bounds? x=6, y=6, but x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, y=6 is ok since y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not wall.\n\nWalls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive are free? Let's see.\n\nThe grid: x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nSimilarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so valid y: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nSo (1,1) to (6,6) are the playable cells.\n\nNow, (4,6): x=4, y=6, which is valid.\n\nSimilarly (6,6): x=6, y=6, valid.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2), but that's not near here.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,7) - wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (5,5) - occupied by body (segment 1), not tail, so collision, invalid\n\n- Left: (4,6) - empty, as per positions\n\n- Right: (6,6) - empty\n\nSo only Left or Right are possible moves.\n\nNow, direction is currently Up, but since Up is invalid, I can choose Left or Right without reverse issue because I'm not moving opposite to current direction; current is Up, but I'm not moving Down, which would be opposite. Left and Right are perpendicular, not opposite.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is Up, so opposite is Down, which I can't do anyway. Left and Right are fine.\n\nSo actions for turn 71: L (left to (4,6)) or R (right to (6,6)).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,5): life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or it disappears. But I'm at (5,6), and (1,5) is at x=1,y=5. To reach it in one move, I need to be adjacent and move to it, but from (5,6) to (1,5) is not adjacent; it's 4 cells away in x and 1 in y, so impossible in one turn. So I cannot eat (1,5) this turn; it will disappear after this turn since life span 1. So this food is not reachable, and will be gone.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 71, life span is 1, meaning after this turn, it disappears. Since I can't reach it this turn, I lose it.\n\n- (4,6): at (4,6), value 1, life span 3. So available for turns 71,72,73; disappears after turn 73.\n\n- (1,2): at (1,2), value 1, life span 9, so available for many turns.\n\nNow, (4,6) is exactly the cell I can move to by going Left from (5,6).\n\nIf I move Left to (4,6), I will eat the food there, since (4,6) has food.\n\nFood at (4,6), and I move to it, so I eat it.\n\nThen, since it's positive food, snake length increases by one, and I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to check for Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the tail grows and collides.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (5,6), tail at (3,4), distance |5-3| + |6-4| = 2+2=4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so neighbors: up, down, left, right.\n\n(5,6) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal or further. So no issue.\n\nMoreover, the food is at (4,6), not on tail.\n\nSo if I move to (4,6), I eat the food, snake grows, new tail position after move.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), ..., tail (3,4)\n\nMove left to (4,6). Since (4,6) has food, after moving, head is at (4,6), and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail was (3,4), new segment added there, but tail moves? When eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added where the tail was.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays in place, effectively growing.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving without eating, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\nWith eating, after moving head to food, the tail segment is not removed, so the snake grows by one, with the new segment at the old tail position.\n\nBut in this case, when I move to (4,6), which has food, so:\n\n- Head moves to (4,6)\n\n- The body segments follow: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where head was, but head was at (5,6), so (5,5) moves to (5,6)? Let's think.\n\nPositions before move: S0: (5,6), S1: (5,5), S2: (5,4), S3: (6,4), etc.\n\nAfter move left to (4,6):\n\n- New head position: (4,6)\n\n- Then S1 moves to previous S0 position: (5,6)\n\n- S2 moves to previous S1 position: (5,5)\n\n- S3 moves to previous S2 position: (5,4)\n\n- And so on, up to the tail.\n\nBut since we ate food, we don't remove the last segment; so the tail segment S16 at (3,4) stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nTypically: after moving, if no food, last position (tail) is removed.\n\nIf food eaten, last position is not removed, so snake grows.\n\nSo positions after move with food eaten:\n\n- New head: (4,6)\n\n- Then S1 moves to (5,6) (previous head)\n\n- S2 moves to (5,5) (previous S1)\n\n- S3 moves to (5,4) (previous S2)\n\n- S4 moves to (6,4) (previous S3)\n\n- ...\n\n- S16 moves to previous S15 position? S15 is (3,3), previous S15 position before move.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nPositions list: index 0: (5,6), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (2,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (4,2), 14: (4,3), 15: (3,3), 16: (3,4)  // tail\n\nAfter moving head to (4,6) and eating food:\n\n- New head: (4,6)\n\n- Segment 1 (old index 1) moves to old index 0 position: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to old index 1 position: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to old index 2 position: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to old index 3 position: (6,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- Up to segment 16 moves to old index 15 position: (3,3)\n\n- And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is old index 16: (3,4)\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), and new tail at (3,4)\n\nThe new tail is at (3,4), which was the old tail position, and we added a segment there.\n\nSnake length is now 18.\n\nNow, head direction: I moved Left, so new direction is Left.\n\nNow, if I move Right to (6,6), what happens?\n\n(6,6) is empty, no food there. So no food eaten.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head to (6,6)\n\n- S1 to (5,6)\n\n- S2 to (5,5)\n\n- etc., up to S16 to (3,3), and since no food, tail is removed, so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ..., down to (3,3), and tail at (3,3) or something.\n\nOld S16 at (3,4) moves to old S15 position (3,3), and since no food, no new segment, and the last position is removed, so the new tail is at (3,3) or wherever S15 was.\n\nAfter move without eating:\n\n- Head new position: (6,6)\n\n- Segment 1: to old head (5,6)\n\n- Segment 2: to old S1 (5,5)\n\n- ...\n\n- Segment 15: to old S14 (4,3)\n\n- Segment 16: to old S15 (3,3)\n\n- Since no food, no new segment, and the old tail position (3,4) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)  // 17 segments, tail at (3,3)\n\nLength same.\n\nNow, back to choice: at turn 71, I can go Left to (4,6) and eat food, or Right to (6,6) no food.\n\nBut if I go Left, I eat (4,6) which has life span 3, but since I eat it now, it's fine.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can eat it later, but life span 3, so available for two more turns after this? Turn 71,72,73; disappears after 73.\n\nBut if I go Right, I don't eat it, and it might be available later.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) with long life, but far.\n\nAnd (1,5) is gone after this turn.\n\nNow, for turn 71, if I go Left to (4,6), I eat food, grow, and head is at (4,6), direction Left.\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Turn 71, move L to (4,6), eat food.\n\nThen state after turn 71:\n\nHead at (4,6), direction L.\n\nPositions: as above, 18 segments: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nFood: (1,5) disappeared, so only (4,6) is eaten, so food left: (1,2) with life span 9, but decreased to 8? Turn 71, life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 71, food (1,5) life span 1, after turn 71, it disappears.\n\nFood (4,6) was eaten, gone.\n\nFood (1,2) life span 9 at turn 71, after turn 71, life span 8, available until turn 79.\n\nNow, head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nCurrent direction is L, so cannot move R on next turn.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (4,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\nD: (4,5) - what is here? Positions: (4,6) is head, (5,6) is next, then (5,5), etc. (4,5) not in positions, so empty? But let's check.\n\nGrid: (4,5) x=4,y=5, valid cell. Not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), ... no (4,5), so empty.\n\nL: (3,6) - x=3,y=6, valid? x=3, between 1-6, y=6 ok. Not in positions, empty.\n\nR: (5,6) - but (5,6) is occupied by the second segment. After move, positions: head (4,6), first body at (5,6). So moving R to (5,6) would be into the body segment at (5,6), which is not the tail; tail is at (3,4). So collision, invalid.\n\nCannot move R because opposite and also occupied.\n\nD: to (4,5) - empty, and not opposite? Current direction L, D is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nL: to (3,6) - empty, and same direction or perpendicular.\n\nU: invalid wall.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible moves: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nNow, if I go D to (4,5), no food there.\n\nIf I go L to (3,6), no food there either.\n\nFood is only at (1,2) now.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nOption 2 for turn 71: move R to (6,6), no food eaten.\n\nThen after turn 71:\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPositions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) // tail at (3,3)\n\nFood: (1,5) gone, (4,6) still there with life span 2 now? Turn 71, food (4,6) life span 3, after turn 71, if not eaten, life span 2, available turn 72 and 73.\n\n(1,2) life span 8.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nU: (6,7) wall, invalid\n\nD: (6,5) - empty? Positions: (6,6) head, (5,6) next, then (5,5), etc. (6,5) not occupied, empty.\n\nL: (5,6) - but (5,6) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\nR: (7,6) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (6,5)\n\nMust move down to (6,5).\n\nNo choice, only one move possible.\n\nThen after that, head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, comparing the options.\n\nIf I choose to go Left at turn 71, I eat the food at (4,6), grow to 18, but then from (4,6), I have choices: down to (4,5) or left to (3,6).\n\nIf I go Right at turn 71, I go to (6,6), then must go down to (6,5), and (4,6) food is still there for now.\n\nBut in that case, I might be able to eat (4,6) later, but it's risky or might not be possible.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) to consider.\n\nBut let's think about the map.\n\nThe snake body occupies many cells; let's list all occupied cells to see free spaces.\n\nCurrent grid: walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nCells:\n\nRow y=6: x=1 to 6, but snake at (5,6) head, and if I move, etc.\n\nPerhaps for planning, I should consider the path to (1,2) food.\n\n(1,2) is at bottom-left, but there is the body.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, option 1: turn 71 move L to (4,6), eat food.\n\nThen turn 72: from (4,6), direction L, I can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n\nIf I move L to (3,6), then head to (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves from (3,6): U, D, L, R.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R.\n\nU: (3,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (3,5) - empty? Let's see positions after turn 71.\n\nAfter turn 71 with eat: positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo (3,5) not occupied, empty.\n\nL: (2,6) - empty\n\nR: (4,6) - occupied by body, not tail, collision invalid.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nIf I move to (3,5), no food.\n\nTo (2,6), no food.\n\nFood is at (1,2), so I need to go towards there.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), so from (3,6), I can go left and down.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 72 I move D to (4,5) from (4,6).\n\nThen head to (4,5), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: L, R, U, D? Direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nL: (3,5) - empty\n\nR: (5,5) - but (5,5) is occupied; positions: after turn 71, (5,5) is a body segment, so moving to (5,5) collision.\n\nU: (4,6) - occupied by body, collision.\n\nD: (4,4) - empty? Positions: (4,5) not occupied yet, but after move to (4,5), head at (4,5), body: (4,6), (5,6), etc., so (4,4) empty.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,5) or D to (4,4).\n\nBoth no food.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option where I go right at turn 71.\n\nTurn 71 move R to (6,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 72 must move D to (6,5), as only choice.\n\nAfter move: head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nPositions: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) // tail at (4,3)? After turn 71 no eat: positions (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail at (3,3)\n\nAfter move down to (6,5): head to (6,5), then S1 to (6,6), S2 to (5,6), S3 to (5,5), ..., S16 to (3,3), no eat, so tail removed, new positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) // 17 segments, tail at (4,3)\n\nFood: (4,6) is still there, with life span 2 at turn 72? After turn 71, if not eaten, life span of (4,6) was 3 at turn 71, after turn 71, it decreases to 2, so available turn 72 and 73.\n\n(1,2) life span 8.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: L, R, U, D.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U.\n\nU: (6,6) - occupied by body, collision invalid\n\nD: (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied; positions: (6,4) is a body segment, not tail, so collision invalid.\n\nL: (5,5) - occupied, body segment, collision.\n\nR: (7,5) wall invalid.\n\nOh no! From (6,5), all moves are invalid?\n\nU to (6,6): occupied by body\n\nD to (6,4): occupied by body\n\nL to (5,5): occupied by body\n\nR to (7,5): wall\n\nAnd no other moves.\n\nBut (6,4) is occupied, (5,5) occupied, etc.\n\nIn positions, (6,4) is segment 4 or something, not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,3), far.\n\nSo moving to (6,4) or (5,5) would cause collision because they are body cells.\n\nThus, from (6,5), no possible moves! Snake would die if I choose to go right at turn 71.\n\nThat's critical.\n\nSo if I move right at turn 71 to (6,6), then at turn 72, I must move down to (6,5), and then at (6,5), I have no safe moves; all adjacent cells are occupied or wall.\n\nTherefore, moving right at turn 71 leads to death on turn 72 or 73.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 72, after moving to (6,5), I have no valid moves for the next turn, so I cannot move, and probably it's game over or collision.\n\nBut in the rules, I have to move, so if no valid move, it's a collision or something.\n\nSo definitely, moving right is fatal.\n\nTherefore, I must move left at turn 71 to (4,6) to eat the food and avoid that trap.\n\nThen, as before, at turn 72, I can move down or left from (4,6).\n\nNow, I need to plan further turns to eat the (1,2) food.\n\nAfter turn 71 move left to (4,6), eat food.\n\nHead at (4,6), direction L.\n\nFor turn 72, I need to choose move.\n\nPossible: down to (4,5) or left to (3,6).\n\nIf I move left to (3,6), then head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen for turn 73, from (3,6), I can move down to (3,5) or left to (2,6).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), so moving left might be good, but (2,6) is closer to top, while (1,2) is bottom.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (4,5) at turn 72, then to (3,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, the tail is at (3,4), and there might be opportunities.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,2) has long life, so I can take time.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but survival first.\n\nIn this case, after moving left, I have space.\n\nLet me list free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I should head towards the bottom-left where (1,2) is.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I move down to (4,5), then I can go further down.\n\n(4,5) to (4,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\n(4,4) might be free; let's see current positions after turn 71 eat.\n\nPositions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nSo occupied cells: all these.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) but gone, (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4) is tail? (3,4) is occupied, (3,5), (3,6) but if I move to (3,6) it's free, (4,5), (4,4) free, (5,3) free? (5,3) not in list, (6,5) free, (6,6) free but I didn't go there, etc.\n\n(1,2) is food, so not free but target.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I need a path.\n\n(1,2) is surrounded? Adjacent cells: (1,1) wall? y=0 wall, so (1,1) is wall? Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 walls.\n\nSo (1,1): x=1,y=1, not border, since border walls are at x=0 and y=0, so (1,1) should be playable.\n\nx=0 and y=0 are walls, so (1,1) is inside, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2), (2,1), etc.\n\nIn snake positions, (2,1) is occupied, (2,2) occupied, (1,2) is food, so not occupied by snake.\n\nAdjacent to (1,2): (1,1), (1,3), (2,2)\n\n(1,1): is it wall? No, walls at x=0, y=0, so (0,0), (0,1), etc. are walls, but (1,1) is at x=1,y=1, which is within 1-6, so not wall.\n\nBut is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), etc., no (1,1), so (1,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,2) occupied by snake.\n\nSo to eat (1,2), I need to move head to (1,2) when adjacent.\n\nNow back to turn 72 choices.\n\nAfter turn 71, head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nOption A: turn 72 move L to (3,6)\n\nThen head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 73, can move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5)\n\nIf move L to (2,6), head at (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 74, from (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction L, cannot R.\n\nU: (2,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (2,5) - free? Positions: after previous, but let's not get too deep.\n\n(2,5) should be free.\n\nL: (1,6) - free\n\nR: (3,6) - occupied by body, invalid.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nIf move L to (1,6), then head at (1,6), then can go down to (1,5) but no food, or to (1,4), etc. towards (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, if at (2,6) move D to (2,5), then to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut (1,2) is at y=2, so need to go down.\n\nOption B at turn 72: from (4,6) move D to (4,5)\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 73, can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nIf move D to (4,4), head at (4,4), then can go to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied? After turn 71, (4,3) is a body segment, but after moves, it changes.\n\nAfter turn 72 move to (4,5): positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), etc., tail (3,4)\n\n(4,4) is free? Not occupied, so move D to (4,4) possible.\n\nThen from (4,4), can go left to (3,4) but (3,4) is tail, so moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n\n(3,4) is current tail, but when I move, it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,3) or right to (5,4) but (5,4) occupied.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nFor survival, moving left at turn 71 is necessary to avoid death.\n\nThen for turn 72, I need to choose a move that keeps options open.\n\nSince (1,2) food is valuable, I should head towards it.\n\nFrom (4,6), moving down to (4,5) might be better to go down.\n\nMoving left to (3,6) is going left, which is away from (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is at bottom-left, (4,6) is top, (3,6) is top-left.\n\n(4,5) is middle-top.\n\nPerhaps moving down first is better.\n\nBut let's see the tail position; tail at (3,4), which is near (1,2) relatively.\n\n(3,4) is at bottom, y=4, x=3.\n\n(1,2) is x=1,y=2.\n\nSo when the tail moves, it might free up space.\n\nBut I need to think about the path.\n\nSince I have to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to output actions starting from turn 71 for a few turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but in answer format, it says to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, so I should output for the current turn and perhaps a few more, but since it's a sequence, I need to plan.\n\nBut in the state, it's turn 71, so I need action for turn 71, then for subsequent turns based on what happens, but since I'm to think ahead, I should plan a sequence assuming no new food, but food might be eaten or disappear.\n\nPerhaps for simplicity, I can output for turn 71 and then for the next few turns the planned actions.\n\nBut to be precise, I should decide turn 71 first.\n\nFrom above, moving left at turn 71 is the only safe choice, as moving right leads to death.\n\nSo for turn 71, action: L (left to (4,6))\n\nThen for turn 72, I need to choose from (4,6).\n\nNow, to think ahead, let's assume I move down to (4,5) at turn 72.\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 73, from (4,5), can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nSay I move D to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 74, from (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction D, cannot U.\n\nU: (4,5) - now, after previous, positions: after turn 72: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), etc.\n\nAfter turn 73 move to (4,4): head to (4,4), then body: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), etc., tail (3,4) still? Tail moves slowly.\n\nPositions: after turn 73 move to (4,4) with no eat (assume), so head (4,4), then segment to (4,5), to (4,6), to (5,6), to (5,5), to (5,4), to (6,4), etc., and tail moves to previous S15 or something.\n\nBut (3,4) is tail, and it moves away if no eat.\n\nEasier: from (4,4), adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (4,5) - occupied by body (the segment that was head at turn 72, now body)\n\n- D: (4,3) - what is here? Currently, after turn 73, (4,3) might be free or not.\n\nIn initial positions, (4,3) is occupied, but after moves, it changes.\n\nAfter turn 73: head at (4,4), body at (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and tail at (3,3) or something? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 71: positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail\n\nTurn 72: move D to (4,5), no food, so head to (4,5), then body: S1 to (4,6), S2 to (5,6), S3 to (5,5), S4 to (5,4), S5 to (6,4), ..., S17 to (3,4), and since no eat, remove last, so new tail is where S16 was, which is (3,3) or? S16 is (3,3) in positions, S17 is (3,4).\n\nIndices: after turn 71, segments: 0: (4,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (2,1), 12: (2,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (4,3), 16: (3,3), 17: (3,4)  // 18 segments\n\nTurn 72 move to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), then S1 to old pos 0: (4,6), S2 to old pos 1: (5,6), S3 to old pos 2: (5,5), S4 to old pos 3: (5,4), S5 to old pos 4: (6,4), ..., up to S17 to old pos 16: (3,3), and remove old tail (3,4), so positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)  // 17 segments, tail at (3,3)\n\nNow turn 73: move D to (4,4), no food?

Old positions: S15 is (4,3), S16 is (3,3)\n\nAfter move: head (4,4), S1 to (4,5), S2 to (4,6), S3 to (5,6), S4 to (5,5), S5 to (5,4), S6 to (6,4), S7 to (6,3), S8 to (6,2), S9 to (6,1), S10 to (5,1), S11 to (4,1), S12 to (3,1), S13 to (2,1), S14 to (2,2), S15 to (3,2), S16 to (4,2), S17 to (4,3)  // and no eat, so remove last?

No, we removed the tail.\n\nFrom 17 segments before move, after move no eat: head new, then 16 segments move to previous positions, and tail removed, so 17 segments.\n\nBefore turn 73, 17 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head (4,4), then the first body to old head (4,5), second body to old S1 (4,6), third to old S2 (5,6), fourth to old S3 (5,5), fifth to old S4 (5,4), sixth to old S5 (6,4), seventh to old S6 (6,3), eighth to old S7 (6,2), ninth to old S8 (6,1), tenth to old S9 (5,1), eleventh to old S10 (4,1), twelfth to old S11 (3,1), thirteenth to old S12 (2,1), fourteenth to old S13 (2,2), fifteenth to old S14 (3,2), sixteenth to old S15 (4,2), and since no eat, no new segment, and old tail (4,3) is removed? Old tail was (3,3), which is old S16.\n\nThe segment that was S16 moves to old S15 position (4,2), and since no eat, we don't add new, so the last position is (4,2), and (3,3) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)  // 17 segments, tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,3) is now free.\n\nBack to from (4,4), direction D.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U: (4,5) - occupied by body (first body segment)\n\n- D: (4,3) - now free, as above\n\n- L: (3,4) - free?

The current state (turn 71) presents a critical decision point:\n\n- Moving right (R) to (6,6) leads to inevitable death on turn 72 or 73, as the snake becomes trapped with no valid moves from (6,5).\n- Moving left (L) to (4,6) allows the snake to eat the positive food at (4,6) (value +1, life span 3), increasing length by 1 and scoring +1. This avoids the trap and opens paths for future movement.\n\nAfter eating the food at (4,6), the snake head is at (4,6) with direction left (L). From here, moving down (D) to (4,5) is chosen for turn 72 to:\n- Head towards the remaining food at (1,2) (value +1, life span 9, decreasing to 8 after turn 71).\n- Avoid the top-left corner (e.g., (3,6)) which could limit mobility.\n- Maintain flexibility for future turns by staying central and navigating toward the bottom-left food.\n\nThe sequence for turns 71-73 is planned as follows, with further turns outlined for pathing toward (1,2) while considering body positions and obstacles:\n- **Turn 71**: Move L to (4,6) to eat food, avoid death, and grow.\n- **Turn 72**: Move D to (4,5) to progress downward toward (1,2).\n- **Turn 73**: From (4,5) with direction down (D), move left (L) to (3,5) to continue toward (1,2).\n- **Beyond turn 73**: The path to (1,2) involves moving left/down (e.g., to (3,4), (2,4), etc.), but actions depend on evolving state. Survival is ensured by avoiding body collisions and walls.\n\nThis sequence eats one food immediately, positions the snake to target (1,2) within its life span, and avoids risks by steering clear of trapped areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: L (left)  \nTurn 72: D (down)  \nTurn 73: L (left)  \n}",

        "step": 72,

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 72. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and one wall at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,6), and the body segments follow: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,6).\n\nFood: only one piece mentioned: at (1,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and it's turn 72, it will disappear after 9 turns, so on turn 81 it will be gone. Value is +1, so it's positive food.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (4,6), moving left. So from (4,6), possible moves are up, down, left, but not right because that would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed. Since head direction is L, I can't move right (opposite direction) on this turn.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6):\n\n- Up: (4,7) but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (4,5) – let's check if it's occupied or wall.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (4,7) is out because y=7 wall. (4,5) is within bounds, no internal walls mentioned except (5,2), so (4,5) should be free.\n\n- Left: (3,6) – also within bounds.\n\n- Right: (5,6) but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body; it's the second segment. But according to rules, moving into the tail is allowed if it's the tail and will move, but let's see the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ...] so (5,6) is the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (3,4), I think. Let me list all positions to identify the tail.\n\nSnake segments: index 0: head (4,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (2,1), 12: (2,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (4,3), 16: (3,3), 17: (3,4) <-- tail.\n\nSo tail is (3,4). Now, moving to (5,6) would be moving to the position occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail, so it would cause a collision because that segment won't move away immediately; only the tail can be moved into safely.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut (5,6) is not the tail; it's the neck or something. So moving to (5,6) should cause a body collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any other body cell would be deadly.\n\nSo from (4,6), possible actions:\n\n- U: (4,7) – y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (4,5) – let's check if occupied. Snake positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), etc. – (4,5) is not in the list, so it should be free? List: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). No (4,5), so (4,5) is empty.\n\n- L: (3,6) – not in snake positions, so empty.\n\n- R: (5,6) – but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body (segment 1), so moving there would cause collision. Invalid.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,5) and (3,6) are not walls. Walls are only borders and (5,2).\n\nSo valid moves: Down to (4,5) or Left to (3,6).\n\nNow, head direction is L, so if I move left to (3,6), that's continuing left. If I move down to (4,5), that's changing direction.\n\nNo instant reverse issue since I'm not moving right.\n\nNow, food is at (1,2) with value +1 and life span 9. It's turn 72, so it has 9 turns left, including this one? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 72, life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 more turns, so on turn 81 it's gone. But since we're at turn 72, we can eat it before turn 81.\n\nBut (1,2) is far from current head position (4,6). I need to plan a path to get there while avoiding risks.\n\nAlso, there might be other cells with food, but only one is listed, so I assume only that one food exists now.\n\nThe state says \"Food Positions: (1,2,9,1)\" so only one food.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo, playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (5,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions: head (4,6), then to (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) — but (6,2) is at y=2, which is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is fine, but (6,2) is occupied.\n\nThen (6,1) at y=1, which is border? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall, it's playable. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so rows y=1 to y=6 are playable, except walls.\n\nSimilarly for x.\n\nSo snake is at various positions.\n\nFood at (1,2).\n\nNow, to eat the food, I need to get the head to (1,2) when it's free, but currently, is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), etc., (1,2) is not listed, so it should be free, but food is there.\n\nFood can be under snake body? Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nCurrently, (1,2) is not occupied by snake; let's check: snake has (2,2) and (3,2), but not (1,2). Positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), etc. No (1,2), so food at (1,2) is not under snake, so it can be eaten directly if head goes there.\n\nBut head is at (4,6), so I need to navigate down to (1,2).\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFirst, for current turn, turn 72, I need to choose action.\n\nOptions: Down to (4,5) or Left to (3,6).\n\nI should think about the path to the food.\n\n(1,2) is at bottom-left, head at top-middle.\n\nAlso, the snake is long; 18 segments? Let's count: positions list has 18 elements, so length 18.\n\nAfter eating positive food, length increases by one.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,4), and food is at (1,2), not on tail, so no issue for now.\n\nFirst, I need to move towards (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,6) to (1,2), I need to go left and down.\n\n(4,6) to (1,2), delta x = -3, delta y = -4, so mostly down and left.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nPossible moves: left to (3,6) or down to (4,5).\n\nIf I go left to (3,6), then from there, I can go down, left, or up? But up might be wall or something.\n\n(3,6): possible moves? x=3,y=6, not wall. Adjacent: U: (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D: (3,5); L: (2,6); R: (4,6) but (4,6) was head, but after move, snake moves, so positions change.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nSince I have to think multiple turns ahead, I should consider paths.\n\nAlso, the food life span is 9 turns, so I have time, but I should plan to get there efficiently.\n\nBut survival is key; avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake: from positions.\n\nCells: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nAnd walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2)\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6), (2,3) to (2,6) except occupied, etc.\n\nSpecifically, around (1,2): (1,2) has food, (1,1) wall? y=0 wall, so (1,1) is x=1,y=1, which is not wall; walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) is playable, but y=1 is not wall, only y=0 is wall. Similarly, x=1 not wall.\n\n(1,1) is free? Snake has (2,1) and (3,1), but not (1,1), so (1,1) free.\n\n(1,2) free but with food.\n\n(1,3) free, (1,4), etc.\n\nBut to get to (1,2), from current position.\n\nPath from (4,6) to (1,2).\n\nOne way: go left to (3,6), then down to (3,5), then left to (2,5), then down to (2,4), then down to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2). But (1,2) is the target, so when head moves to (1,2), it eats.\n\nBut need to check if cells are free at that time.\n\nSince snake moves, the body also moves, so some cells become free.\n\nFor example, if I move down from (4,6) to (4,5), then snake positions will be: head (4,5), then body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc., but tail (3,4) moves to next? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail position is vacated.\n\nStandard snake movement.\n\nSo after moving down to (4,5), new positions: head (4,5), then the old head becomes part of body, so (4,6) is now the first body segment, then (5,6), then (5,5), and so on, up to (3,4) is tail, but when head moves to (4,5), the segment that was tail (3,4) is removed if no food eaten, so new tail is the one before, which is (3,3)? Let's see.\n\nPositions before move: indices 0: (4,6) head, 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (2,1), 12: (2,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (4,3), 16: (3,3), 17: (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,5), new head is (4,5), then the body: segment 1 was (5,6), but now it becomes the position of old segment 0, which is (4,6), so new segment 1: (4,6), then new segment 2: old segment 1 position (5,6), and so on, down to new segment 17: old segment 16 position (3,3), and the old tail (3,4) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)  -- tail at (3,3).\n\nLength same, no food eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if move left to (3,6), new positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail? Old tail was (3,4), removed, new tail (3,3).\n\nAfter left move to (3,6): head (3,6), body: old head (4,6) becomes first body, so (4,6), then old segment 1 (5,6), old segment 2 (5,5), ..., up to old segment 16 (3,3), and old segment 17 (3,4) removed. So tail is (3,3).\n\nNow, back to choosing turn 72 action.\n\nI need to go towards (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,6), going down to (4,5) is moving down, which is towards lower y.\n\n(1,2) has y=2, current y=6, so down is good.\n\nGoing left to (3,6) is same y, but left towards x=1.\n\nBoth are towards, but down might be better since delta y is larger.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (4,5), then from there, I can go left, down, or right? But right to (5,5) is occupied by snake body? After move, positions include (5,5) as a body segment.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc. so (5,5) is occupied, so from (4,5), moving right to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nMoving down to (4,4) – (4,4) is free? Before move, (4,4) not in positions, and not wall, so yes.\n\nMoving left to (3,5) – free.\n\nMoving up to (4,6) but (4,6) is now body, collision.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible moves: D to (4,4), L to (3,5), or U to (4,6) invalid, R to (5,5) invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left first to (3,6), from there: after move, head (3,6), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc.\n\nPossible moves from (3,6): U: (3,7) wall, invalid; D: (3,5); L: (2,6); R: (4,6) but (4,6) is body, invalid.\n\nSo moves: D or L.\n\nNow, to reach (1,2), I need to go to lower x and y.\n\nAlso, the area around (1,2) has some snake segments.\n\nCurrent snake: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n\n(1,2) is free, but to access it, I might need to go through (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied.\n\n(2,2) is a body segment now.\n\nAs the snake moves, segments will shift.\n\nFor example, if I start moving down and left, the tail will move, freeing up cells.\n\nLet's plan a path to (1,2).\n\nSuppose I go down from (4,6) to (4,5) on turn 72.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go down to (4,4) or left to (3,5).\n\nSay I go down to (4,4).\n\nThen to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (4,3) is segment 15, but after moves, it might be different.\n\nI need to simulate a few turns.\n\nSince the food has life span 9, I have time, but I should not delay too much.\n\nFirst, distance: from (4,6) to (1,2), Manhattan distance |4-1| + |6-2| = 3+4=7, so at least 7 moves, but with snake body, it might take more if blocked.\n\nBut as snake moves, body clears.\n\nNow, the tail is at (3,4), and as we move, it will free cells.\n\nTo reach (1,2), one way is to go to (1,3) then to (1,2), or (2,2) then to (1,2), but (2,2) is occupied, so I need to wait for it to clear.\n\n(2,2) is segment 12, and tail is 17, so it's not tail, so it will move only when the snake moves.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is segment 13, etc.\n\nThe segment at (2,2) will move to the next position when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if the head moves down or left, the body shifts.\n\nLet's assume I start moving left and down towards (1,2).\n\nFor turn 72, I have to choose between down or left.\n\nI think down might be better because it gets me closer in y, and then I can go left.\n\nIf I go left to (3,6), I am at x=3,y=6, still high y.\n\nThen from there, I need to go down, but I can go down to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see if there are any immediate risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal wall at (5,2) might block some paths, but since I'm going to (1,2), it's not in the way.\n\n(5,2) is wall, so I can't go through there, but (1,2) is far.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to have space to move after eating the food or before.\n\nBut with one food, after eating, I need to find more food, but there might be no other food, so I need to survive as long as possible.\n\nThe state has only one food, so after eating it, I need to avoid starvation, but since no other food mentioned, I should eat this one to grow and then roam carefully.\n\nBut for now, focus on getting to this food safely.\n\nAlso, the \"tail reward danger\" isn't an issue here.\n\nNow, let's consider the moves.\n\nI should think 5 turns ahead.\n\nStart from turn 72.\n\nOption 1: Move Down to (4,5)\n\nThen new state: head at (4,5), direction down (since moved down).\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nFood at (1,2,9,1) but life span decreases, so at turn 73, life span 8, etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: L to (3,5), D to (4,4), or R to (5,5) but occupied, invalid. U to (4,6) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo L or D.\n\nIf I go D to (4,4), then head to (4,4), direction down.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) — (5,4) is occupied, but after move, (5,4) becomes body segment, but let's list: old positions before this move: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), ..., up to (3,3)\n\nAfter move down to (4,4): head (4,4), then body: old head (4,5), then old body1 (4,6), old body2 (5,6), old body3 (5,5), old body4 (5,4), old body5 (6,4), ..., old body17 (3,3), and old tail was (3,3)? Old tail was (3,3), which is now body segment, and the previous tail is removed? Indices: old positions: 0:(4,5), 1:(4,6), 2:(5,6), 3:(5,5), 4:(5,4), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,3), 7:(6,2), 8:(6,1), 9:(5,1), 10:(4,1), 11:(3,1), 12:(2,1), 13:(2,2), 14:(3,2), 15:(4,2), 16:(4,3), 17:(3,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,4): new head (4,4), new body0: old head (4,5), new body1: old body1 (4,6), new body2: old body2 (5,6), new body3: old body3 (5,5), new body4: old body4 (5,4), new body5: old body5 (6,4), ..., new body16: old body16 (4,3), new body17: old body17 (3,3)? Old body17 is (3,3), which was tail, but after move, new positions have 18 segments? When no food, length same, so new tail is the last one.\n\nNew head (4,4), then the first body is the old head (4,5), then old body1 (4,6), then old body2 (5,6), old body3 (5,5), old body4 (5,4), old body5 (6,4), old body6 (6,3), old body7 (6,2), old body8 (6,1), old body9 (5,1), old body10 (4,1), old body11 (3,1), old body12 (2,1), old body13 (2,2), old body14 (3,2), old body15 (4,2), old body16 (4,3), and old body17 (3,3) is the last body, so new tail is (3,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is old body16, which is now new body16, position (4,3).\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (3,3)? New body17 is old body17 (3,3), so positions: indices 0: (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1), 14: (2,2), 15: (3,2), 16: (4,2), 17: (4,3), and tail should be (3,3) but (3,3) is not in the list? Old body17 was (3,3), and it was the tail, but after move, it is removed because the snake moves forward, so new snake has segments from new head to the old position of segment 16, which is (4,3), and tail is (4,3).\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo from old positions, new positions: new head at new position, new segment 1 at old head position, new segment 2 at old segment 1 position, ..., new segment k at old segment k-1 position, up to new segment L-1 at old segment L-2 position, and the old segment L-1 position is vacated (tail removed).\n\nOld positions: 18 segments, indices 0 to 17.\n\nAfter move, new head at new cell, say P.\n\nThen new segment 1 at old seg0 position.\n\nNew segment 2 at old seg1 position.\n\n...\n\nNew segment 17 at old seg16 position.\n\nThe old seg17 position is not occupied anymore.\n\nSo length is 17? No, number of segments same, but the tail cell changes.\n\nFor example, initially 18 segments.\n\nAfter one move, still 18 segments, but the tail has moved.\n\nIn terms of cells: the head moves to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell, so the snake occupies a new head cell and vacates the tail cell; the body cells shift.\n\nSo the number of segments remains the same unless food eaten.\n\nIn this case, length 18.\n\nAfter move down to (4,5): new head (4,5), new body: the old head position (4,6) is now body segment 1, old body1 position (5,6) is now body segment 2, old body2 position (5,5) is now body segment 3, ..., up to old body16 position (3,3) is now body segment 17, and old body17 position (3,4) is vacated.\n\nOld body17 is (3,4), which is tail, vacated.\n\nNew tail is at old body16 position (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, in the earlier move.\n\nBack to path.\n\nTo save time, I should choose a direction that heads towards (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,6), moving down to (4,5) gets me to y=5, closer to y=2.\n\nMoving left to (3,6) gets me to x=3, closer to x=1.\n\nBut since delta y is larger, down might be better.\n\nAlso, from (4,5), I can go left to (3,5) or down to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) is closer to (1,2) than (4,4)? (3,5) to (1,2) dx=2, dy=3, dist 5; (4,4) to (1,2) dx=3, dy=2, dist 5 same.\n\nBut from (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), I am at (4,4), which is occupied later? In the current state, (4,4) is not occupied, but after move, it might be.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nCurrent free cells near head: (3,6), (4,5), (3,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,5) is free.\n\nAnother point: the food at (1,2) has life span 9, so I have 9 turns to eat it.\n\nMinimum distance 7 turns, so I can reach in 7 or 8 turns.\n\nBut I need to plan the route.\n\nAlso, to avoid collision, I need to ensure that when I move, the cells are free or the tail.\n\nBut in this case, for the path to (1,2), I need to go to cells like (2,2), but (2,2) is currently occupied, so I need to wait for it to be free or go around.\n\n(2,2) is segment 12, and the tail is segment 17, so when the snake moves, (2,2) will move to the next position only if the head moves, but it depends on the movement.\n\nThe cell (2,2) will be vacated when the segment there moves, which depends on the snake's path.\n\nFor example, if the head moves in a way that the body segment at (2,2) is no longer there after some moves.\n\nSince the tail is at (3,4), and as we move, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I can go via (1,3) or (1,1) or (2,2) but (2,2) occupied.\n\n(1,3) is free, (1,1) is free, (2,3) is free? Current positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) so (2,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) free.\n\nSo I can go to (1,3) then to (1,2).\n\nOr to (2,3) then to (2,2) but (2,2) occupied, so only when it's free.\n\nBut if I go to (2,3), then later to (1,3) or (2,2) if free.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nSuppose on turn 72, I move down to (4,5).\n\nTurn 72: move D to (4,5)\n\nThen on turn 73, from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4).\n\nSay I move L to (3,5) to go left.\n\nThen head to (3,5), direction left.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), etc., tail at (3,3)? After previous move to (4,5), tail was at (3,3).\n\nAfter move to (3,5): head (3,5), body: old head (4,5), old body1 (4,6), old body2 (5,6), ..., up to old body16 (4,3), old body17 (3,3), so new tail at old body17 position (3,3)? Old body17 was (3,3), new body17 at old body16 position (4,3), so tail at (4,3).\n\nVacated old tail position.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) or U to (3,6) but (3,6) may be body, after move, (3,6) is not occupied yet, let's see positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail. (3,4) is free now? Old tail was vacated.\n\n(3,4) was old tail, vacated, so free.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) - free, D to (3,4) - free, L to (2,5) - free, R to (4,5) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo U, D, L.\n\nI want to go to (1,2), so down to (3,4) or left to (2,5).\n\n(3,4) is closer in y, (2,5) closer in x.\n\nSay move D to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 73: move D to (3,4)\n\nHead at (3,4), direction down.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), tail at (4,3)? Old tail was (4,3), vacated, new tail at old body17 position.\n\nAfter previous, tail at (4,3), after move to (3,4): head (3,4), body: old head (3,5), old body1 (4,5), old body2 (4,6), ..., old body16 (3,2), old body17 (4,2), so new tail at (4,2)? Old body17 was (4,2), which is now new body17, position (4,2).\n\nList: new head (3,4), new body0: (3,5), new body1: (4,5), new body2: (4,6), new body3: (5,6), new body4: (5,5), new body5: (5,4), new body6: (6,4), new body7: (6,3), new body8: (6,2), new body9: (6,1), new body10: (5,1), new body11: (4,1), new body12: (3,1), new body13: (2,1), new body14: (2,2), new body15: (3,2), new body16: (4,2), new body17: (4,3)? Old body17 was (4,3)? Earlier: after turn 72 move to (4,5), positions include (4,3) as body, but in the list, when we moved to (3,5), let's keep track.\n\nStart from turn 72 move D to (4,5): positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nThen turn 73 move L to (3,5): new head (3,5), body: old head (4,5), old body1 (4,6), old body2 (5,6), old body3 (5,5), old body4 (5,4), old body5 (6,4), old body6 (6,3), old body7 (6,2), old body8 (6,1), old body9 (5,1), old body10 (4,1), old body11 (3,1), old body12 (2,1), old body13 (2,2), old body14 (3,2), old body15 (4,2), old body16 (4,3), old body17 (3,3) so new body17 at old body16 position (4,3), so tail at (4,3).\n\nVacated old tail (3,3).\n\nNow from (3,5), move D to (3,4): new head (3,4), body: old head (3,5), old body1 (4,5), old body2 (4,6), old body3 (5,6), old body4 (5,5), old body5 (5,4), old body6 (6,4), old body7 (6,3), old body8 (6,2), old body9 (6,1), old body10 (5,1), old body11 (4,1), old body12 (3,1), old body13 (2,1), old body14 (2,2), old body15 (3,2), old body16 (4,2), old body17 (4,3) so new body17 at old body16 position (4,2), so tail at (4,2).\n\nVacated old tail (4,3).\n\nNow head at (3,4), which is where the tail was, but it's free now.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (3,3) but (3,3) was vacated earlier, so free, or (2,4), or (3,5) but (3,5) is body, invalid, or (4,4) free.\n\nPositions now: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nFree around: (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nI can move L to (2,4), D to (3,3), or R to (4,4), U to (3,5) invalid.\n\n(3,3) is free, so D to (3,3) possible.\n\nBut (3,3) is below, towards (1,2).\n\nThen from there to (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied, body segment.\n\n(3,2) is in positions, so I can't go there yet.\n\nSo perhaps move L to (2,4) or D to (3,3).\n\nSay move D to (3,3) on turn 74.\n\nBut (3,3) is free, move to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction down.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) tail? Old tail at (4,2), vacated, new tail at old body17 position (3,2).\n\nAfter move, head (3,3), body: old head (3,4), old body1 (3,5), old body2 (4,5), ..., old body16 (2,2), old body17 (3,2), so new body17 at old body16 position (2,2), tail at (2,2).\n\nVacated (4,2).\n\nNow head at (3,3), which was previously body, but now head.\n\nFrom here, I can move to (3,2) but (3,2) is now body, in positions, so collision if I move there.\n\nMove to (2,3) or (4,3) or (3,4) but (3,4) body, invalid.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (2,2), (3,2) tail.\n\nSo free: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2) occupied, (2,4), etc.\n\n(2,3) free, (4,3) free, (2,4) free.\n\nI can move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3) or U to (3,4) invalid, D to (3,2) invalid.\n\nSo to go towards (1,2), move L to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 75: move L to (2,3)\n\nHead at (2,3), direction left.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), tail at (3,2)? Old tail at (3,2), vacated, new tail at old body17 position (2,2).\n\nAfter move, head (2,3), body: old head (3,3), old body1 (3,4), old body2 (3,5), old body3 (4,5), ..., old body16 (2,1), old body17 (2,2), so new body17 at old body16 position (2,1), tail at (2,1).\n\nVacated (3,2).\n\nNow head at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) but (2,2) is occupied, body segment, so invalid.\n\nMove to (1,3) or (2,4) or (3,3) but (3,3) body, invalid.\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2) invalid, L to (1,3), R to (3,3) invalid.\n\nSo U to (2,4) or L to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is closer to (1,2), so move L to (1,3).\n\nTurn 76: move L to (1,3)\n\nHead at (1,3), direction left.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), tail at (2,2)? Old tail at (2,2), vacated, new tail at old body17 position (2,1).\n\nAfter move, head (1,3), body: old head (2,3), old body1 (3,3), old body2 (3,4), old body3 (3,5), old body4 (4,5), ..., old body16 (3,1), old body17 (2,1), so new body17 at old body16 position (3,1), tail at (3,1).\n\nVacated (2,1).\n\nNow head at (1,3), I can move to (1,2) or (1,4) or (2,3) but (2,3) body, invalid.\n\nU to (1,4), D to (1,2), R to (2,3) invalid.\n\n(1,2) has food, so I can move D to (1,2) to eat it.\n\nTurn 77: move D to (1,2)\n\nThen head moves to (1,2), eats food, so length increases by one, so new head (1,2), and the tail does not move, so new positions: head (1,2), then body: the old head position (1,3) becomes body, then old body positions, and tail remains, so new segment at old tail position? When eating, the head moves to food, the body follows, but tail stays, so length increases.\n\nNew head at (1,2), new body0 at old head position (1,3), new body1 at old body1 position (2,3), and so on, up to new body17 at old body17 position (3,1), and since food eaten, no tail removed, so new body18 at old tail position (3,1)? Old tail was at (3,1), which is now the new last body segment.\n\nPositions: new head (1,2), then new body segments at the old positions: old head (1,3), old body1 (2,3), old body2 (3,3), old body3 (3,4), ..., up to old body17 (3,1), and the old tail was at (3,1), but since no removal, it's included, so the new body17 is at old body17 position, but old body17 was (3,1), and it was the last, so new positions have 19 segments.\n\nHead (1,2), body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and tail at (3,1) but (3,1) is now body, and new tail at (3,1)? After eating, the tail doesn't move, so the position that was tail is now the new last body segment.\n\nIn this case, old positions before move: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), ..., (3,1) was body? Let's list before turn 77 move.\n\nBefore turn 77, after turn 76: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), tail at (2,1)? Earlier after turn 76: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and tail at (3,1)? No, after turn 76 move to (1,3), tail was at (3,1).\n\nIn the positions, the last one is tail.\n\nAfter move to (1,3): positions head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and tail at (3,1), but (3,1) is listed as body, but it's the tail position.\n\nIn the list, it's the last element.\n\nSo for turn 77, move D to (1,2): new head at (1,2), then the body: the old head position (1,3) becomes new body segment, then old body1 position (2,3), old body2 (3,3), ..., up to old body17 position (3,1), and since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the old tail position (3,1) is still there, but it's already included as old body17? The positions are indexed.\n\nOld positions: 0: head (1,3), 1: body (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (3,1), 17: tail? The last is (3,1), which is segment 16 or 17?\n\nList has 18 positions: from head to tail, 18 cells.\n\nIn turn 76 state, positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]? Earlier I think I missed (2,1).\n\nIn turn 76 after move to (1,3): from previous, before move, head at (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), tail at (2,2)? I'm confused.\n\nLet's go back.\n\nAfter turn 75: head at (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), tail at (2,2)? No, in the list, after turn 75 move to (2,3), tail at (2,1) or?\n\nFrom turn 75 move: from (3,4) move L to (2,3), new head (2,3), body: old head (3,4), old body1 (3,5), old body2 (4,5), old body3 (4,6), old body4 (5,6), old body5 (5,5), old body6 (5,4), old body7 (6,4), old body8 (6,3), old body9 (6,2), old body10 (6,1), old body11 (5,1), old body12 (4,1), old body13 (3,1), old body14 (2,1), old body15 (2,2), old body16 (3,2), old body17 (4,2) so new body17 at old body16 position (3,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nVacated old tail (4,2).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) tail.\n\nThen turn 76 move L to (1,3): new head (1,3), body: old head (2,3), old body1 (3,4), old body2 (3,5), old body3 (4,5), old body4 (4,6), old body5 (5,6), old body6 (5,5), old body7 (5,4), old body8 (6,4), old body9 (6,3), old body10 (6,2), old body11 (6,1), old body12 (5,1), old body13 (4,1), old body14 (3,1), old body15 (2,1), old body16 (2,2), old body17 (3,2) so new body17 at old body16 position (2,2), tail at (2,2).\n\nVacated old tail (3,2).\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) tail.\n\nThen turn 77 move D to (1,2): new head at (1,2), and since food eaten, no tail removal, so new body: old head position (1,3) becomes body, then old body1 position (2,3), old body2 position (3,4), ..., up to old body17 position (2,2), and the old tail position (2,2) is now body, so new positions: head (1,2), then body (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) and tail at (2,2)? The last is (2,2), which is now the new tail.\n\nLength 19.\n\nAnd food eaten, score +1.\n\nIn this sequence, I reached (1,2) on turn 77, which is within life span 9 from turn 72, since turn 72 to 77 is 5 turns? Turn 72 action, turn 73,74,75,76,77: 6 actions, from turn 72 to turn 77 is 6 turns? Let's see: at turn 72, I move, so turn 72 is the current turn, action for turn 72.\n\nThen turn 73,74,75,76,77: so 5 additional turns, total 6 moves from turn 72 to turn 77.\n\nBut the food life span: at turn 72, life span 9, decreases each turn, so after turn 72, life span 8, turn 73:7, turn 74:6, turn 75:5, turn 76:4, turn 77:3, so at turn 77, life span 3, still there, can be eaten.\n\nSo I ate it on turn 77.\n\nNow, in this sequence, I moved down on turn 72, then left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then down to (3,3)? In my earlier, from (3,4) I moved to (3,3), but at that time (3,3) was free.\n\nThen to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2).\n\nBut when I moved to (3,3) on turn 74, from (3,4) to (3,3), but (3,3) was free, but after moving, head at (3,3), and I could have moved directly to (3,2) but it was occupied, so I moved left to (2,3).\n\nThen to (1,3), etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 72, I could have moved left instead.\n\nBut with down, I reached in 6 moves.\n\nIf I move left on turn 72 to (3,6).\n\nTurn 72: move L to (3,6)\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail? Old tail (3,4) vacated.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nSay move D to (3,5) on turn 73.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut from (3,6) to (3,5), then to (3,4), etc., similar path but starting from higher y.\n\nIt might take the same or more turns.\n\nFor example, to (3,5) on turn 73, then to (3,4) on 74, to (3,3) on 75, to (2,3) on 76, to (1,3) on 77, to (1,2) on 78, one turn later than with down first.\n\nSo moving down first is slightly better.\n\nIn the down-first path, I ate on turn 77.\n\nWith left first, turn 78.\n\nSo down is preferable.\n\nAlso, in the down path, when I moved to (3,4) on turn 73, (3,4) was the previous tail position, but it was vacated, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all moves were to free cells.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for current and future turns up to some point, but it says \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify a sequence, but how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I planned to eat on turn 77, which is t1+5, turn 72 to 77 is t1 to t1+5.\n\nt1=72, turn 77 is t1+5.\n\nBut I need to output from turn 72 to when? Perhaps until the food is eaten or something.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should output a sequence, but it might be open-ended.\n\nSince I have a plan to eat the food, I can output until I eat it.\n\nBut after eating, I need to continue, but for now, the goal is to eat this food.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the sequence, with down first, I have actions.\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nTurn 73: L (to (3,5))\n\nIn my earlier, from (4,5) I moved L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 74: D (to (3,4))\n\nThen turn 75: D (to (3,3)? But from (3,4) I moved to (3,3), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 72: move D to (4,5)\n\nTurn 73: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 74: move D to (3,4)\n\nThen from (3,4), I moved to (3,3) on turn 75? But in positions, after turn 74, head at (3,4), I can move to (3,3) or (2,4) or (4,4).\n\nI moved to (3,3) on turn 75.\n\nThen turn 76: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 77: move D to (1,2)? From (2,3) to (1,3) first, then to (1,2).\n\nIn turn 76, I moved from (2,3) to (1,3), then turn 77 to (1,2).\n\nBut from (2,3), I could move directly to (1,3) or to (2,2) if free, but not, so to (1,3).\n\nThen to (1,2).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nTurn 73: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 74: D (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 75: D (to (3,3)) -- but at turn 75, from (3,4) to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 76: L (to (2,3))\n\nThen turn 77: L (to (1,3))? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left, then turn 77: D to (1,2)\n\nBut from (2,3) to (1,3) is left, then (1,3) to (1,2) is down.\n\nIn the move to (1,3) on turn 76, then to (1,2) on turn 77.\n\nBut at turn 76, head at (1,3), and (1,2) is below, so move down to (1,2).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output from turn 72 to turn 77 or so.\n\nBut turn 77 is when I eat.\n\nPerhaps I can output until that point.\n\nTo be concise, since the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 75, when I moved to (3,3), but (3,3) might not be necessary; I could go directly to (2,3) from (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 74, instead of down to (3,3), I could move left to (2,4) or (2,3)? (2,4) or (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free at that time? After turn 74, positions include (2,2), but (2,3) not occupied.\n\nAfter turn 74 move to (3,4): positions head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nFree cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can move L to (2,4) or D to (3,3) or R to (4,4) or U to (3,5) invalid.\n\n(2,3) is adjacent, but to move to (2,3) from (3,4), it's left and down, not direct; moves are only U, D, L, R, so from (3,4), to go to (2,3), I need to move left to (2,4) or down to (3,3), then to (2,3).\n\nI can't move diagonally.\n\nSo from (3,4), moving left to (2,4) or down to (3,3).\n\nThen from there to (2,3) or (2,4) to (2,3).\n\nFor example, on turn 75, from (3,4) move L to (2,4)\n\nThen head at (2,4), then on turn 76 move D to (2,3) or L to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) might be free later.\n\nBut in my first path, going to (3,3) then to (2,3) is fine.\n\nAnd it worked.\n\nTo save a turn, but it's similar.\n\nNow, for the answer, I think moving down on turn 72 is good.\n\nBut in the initial, head direction is L, and I moved D, which is fine, not reverse.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nBut I need to specify for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 72 to 76, and on turn 77 I eat, but I can include.\n\nSince the format is to output a sequence, I'll output from turn 72 to turn 77.\n\nBut turn 77 is t1+5.\n\nt1=72, t1+5=77.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nTurn 72: D (down)\n\nThen after that, head at (4,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 73: L (left to (3,5)), now direction L.\n\nTurn 74: D (down to (3,4)), direction D.\n\nTurn 75: D (down to (3,3)), but (3,3) is free, direction D.\n\nThen turn 76: L (left to (2,3)), direction L.\n\nThen turn 77: D (down to (1,2)? From (2,3) to (1,3) first? No, from (2,3) I can move directly to (1,3) by left, or to (2,2) if free, but not, so to (1,3) by L.\n\nThen from (1,3) to (1,2) by D.\n\nIn turn 76, from (2,3) move L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 77: D to (1,2)\n\nBut in the sequence above, on turn 75 I am at (3,3), move L to (2,3) on turn 76.\n\nThen on turn 76, move L to (1,3)? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left.\n\nThen turn 77: D to (1,2)\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 76: L (to (1,3)? No, to (2,3) first? Turn 76: from (3,3) move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 77: from (2,3) move L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 78: D to (1,2)? But I want to eat on 77.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAfter turn 75: at (3,3), move to (2,3) on turn 76.\n\nThen at (2,3), on turn 77, move to (1,3) or to (1,2)? But (1,2) not adjacent directly; from (2,3), adjacent are (2,4), (2,2), (1,3), (3,3).\n\n(1,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nSo must go to (1,3) first, then to (1,2).\n\nSo on turn 77: move to (1,3), then turn 78: to (1,2).\n\nBut earlier with down first, I reached (1,3) on turn 76? In first sequence:\n\nTurn 72: D to (4,5)\n\n73: L to (3,5)\n\n74: D to (3,4)\n\n75: D to (3,3)  -- turn 75 at (3,3)\n\n76: L to (2,3)  -- turn 76 at (2,3)\n\n77: L to (1,3)  -- turn 77 at (1,3)\n\nThen to eat, on turn 78: D to (1,2)\n\nBut at turn 77, at (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nBut in my initial plan, I said turn 77 to (1,2), but from (2,3) to (1,2) is not possible directly; must go to (1,3) first.\n\nSo minimum from (4,6) to (1,2) is 7 moves: e.g., L,D,D,L,D,L,D or something.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (1,2): one path: (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) that's 7 moves.\n\nOr (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, not free, so better to go left earlier.\n\nIn my sequence, with down first: (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) 7 moves, turns 72 to 78.\n\nTurn 72: to (4,5)\n\n73: to (3,5)\n\n74: to (3,4)\n\n75: to (3,3)\n\n76: to (2,3)\n\n77: to (1,3)\n\n78: to (1,2) and eat.\n\nLife span: at turn 72, life span 9, after 6 moves to turn 78, life span 9-6=3, still there.\n\nTurn 72 action, life span decreases after the turn? Rule: \"life-span decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 72, before action? Or after?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think when the turn starts, life span decreases.\n\nSo at turn 72, before action, life span decreases to 8? Or after?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", so at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears.\n\nFor example, if life span 1, it disappears after the current turn.\n\nSimilarly, here at turn 72, life span 9, after turn 72, it becomes 8, and so on.\n\nAfter turn 77, life span 9-6=3? Turns: at turn 72, after action, life span decreases to 8.\n\nAfter turn 73, to 7, ..., after turn 77, to 9-6=3, so on turn 78, before action, life span 3, so I can eat on turn 78.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to go to (1,3) on turn 77, then to (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nBut for the output, I can start with turn 72 D.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nSince the food is the only goal, and I have a path.\n\nBut in turn 75, moving to (3,3) might not be best; from (3,4) on turn 74, I could move left to (2,4), then down to (2,3), then left to (1,3), etc., similar.\n\nBut with down, it's fine.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output the actions for turns 72 to 77, but on turn 77 I am at (1,3), not eating yet.\n\nPerhaps output until turn 78.\n\nBut to keep it shorter, since the instruction says \"maximize score\" and \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can output for 5 turns: turns 72 to 76.\n\nThen on turn 76, at (2,3), and I can go to (1,3) on 77.\n\nBut for the box, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I should include the eating turn.\n\nSince the AI needs to survive, after eating, I need to move away, but for now, the sequence to eat is clear.\n\nAnother thing: in the current state, when I move down to (4,5), is there any risk?\n\n(4,5) is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are safe.\n\nIf I move left to (3,6) first, it might take longer.\n\nSo I think down is better.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (5,2) is not in the way.\n\nSo for turn 72, action D.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: L  (to (2,3))\n\nThen on turn 77: L to (1,3), turn 78: D to (1,2)\n\nBut for the answer format, perhaps output 5 actions or so.\n\nSince the food is at (1,2), and life span 9, I have time, but this path is fine.\n\nI think for the response, I'll output the actions for turns 72 to 76, as thinking ahead 5 turns.\n\nt1=72, to t1+4=76.\n\nThen the AI can continue.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" etc., so I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I should include the eating in the plan.\n\nBut for the box, I'll output from turn 72 to turn 77, with actions to reach (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nTurn 77: move L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 78: D to (1,2) eat.\n\nBut for turn 77, it's part of the sequence.\n\nSince the current turn is 72, and I need to output for multiple turns, I'll do for 6 turns: 72 to 77.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 72: D\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D  (from (3,4) to (3,3))\n\nTurn 76: L  (from (3,3) to (2,3))\n\nTurn 77: L  (from (2,3) to (1,3))\n\nThen on turn 78, move D to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut turn 77 is to (1,3).\n\nIn the output, I can stop at turn 77.\n\nFor the answer, I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 72):**\n- **Snake Head Position**: (4, 6)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Left (L)\n- **Valid Moves from (4, 6)**: \n  - Down (D) to (4, 5): Free (not occupied by snake or wall).\n  - Left (L) to (3, 6): Free (not occupied by snake or wall).\n  - Up (U) to (4, 7): Invalid (y=7 is a wall).\n  - Right (R) to (5, 6): Invalid (occupied by snake body segment at index 1).\n- **Food**: Only one positive food at (1, 2) with value +1 and life span 9. It will disappear after turn 81 (life span decreases each turn, including turn 72).\n- **Goal**: Eat the food at (1, 2) safely within 9 turns while prioritizing long-term survival. The Manhattan distance from (4, 6) to (1, 2) is 7 (|4-1| + |6-2| = 3 + 4), so a minimum of 7 moves is required. A safe path has been planned to reach (1, 2) by turn 78 (6 moves from turn 72).\n\n**Path to Food and Risk Avoidance:**\n- **Path Overview**: Move down immediately to reduce the y-coordinate faster, then left/down to navigate toward (1, 2). The chosen path avoids snake body collisions and walls, leveraging tail movement to free space. Key waypoints:\n  - Turn 72: Move down to (4, 5).\n  - Turn 73: Move left to (3, 5).\n  - Turn 74: Move down to (3, 4).\n  - Turn 75: Move down to (3, 3) (now free after tail movement).\n  - Turn 76: Move left to (2, 3).\n  - Turn 77: Move left to (1, 3).\n  - Turn 78: Move down to (1, 2) to eat food (life span will be 3 at turn 78, so safe).\n- **Why This Path?**: \n  - Moving down on turn 72 starts reducing y-distance immediately, which is larger than x-distance (delta y=4 vs. delta x=3).\n  - The path uses free cells and avoids body segments (e.g., (3, 3) is freed by turn 75 due to tail movement).\n  - No \"tail reward danger\" as food is not on the tail.\n  - Thinking 5+ turns ahead: The sequence ensures the snake reaches (1, 3) by turn 77, setting up the food eat on turn 78. After eating, the snake can move to open areas (e.g., (1, 1) or (2, 2) once freed) for survival.\n- **Risks Mitigated**:\n  - Wall at (5, 2) is irrelevant for this path.\n  - No dead ends: The bottom-left area (e.g., (1, 1), (1, 3)) has space to maneuver after eating.\n  - Life span: Food will be eaten on turn 78 with 3 turns remaining, avoiding starvation risk.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 72 to 77):**\nThe sequence below covers turns 72 to 77, reaching (1, 3) on turn 77.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 73, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). But since walls occupy those cells, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,5), and direction is D (down). The list is: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nThat's 18 segments. Let me map this out to visualize.\n\nFood: Two pieces:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 8, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 10, value +1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth have value 1, so they're both positive food. No negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's understand the snake's current state. Head at (4,5), moving down. So from (4,5), down would be to (4,4), but let's see what's around.\n\nCurrent possible moves: Since direction is D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U because that would be instant reverse. From down, opposite is up, so I cannot move up. So possible actions: Down, Left, Right.\n\n- Down: to (4,4)\n\n- Left: to (3,5)\n\n- Right: to (5,5)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, walls: Playable area (1,1) to (6,6). (4,4) is within, (3,5) within, (5,5) within.\n\nNow, snake body: Snake positions list, head is (4,5), then body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), etc.\n\n(5,5) is a body segment. Specifically, the fourth segment? Let's list indices:\n\nIndex 0: head (4,5)\n\nIndex 1: (4,6)\n\nIndex 2: (5,6)\n\nIndex 3: (5,5)  -- this is the body\n\nIndex 4: (5,4)\n\nIndex 5: (6,4)\n\netc.\n\nSo if I move right to (5,5), that's where the body is at index 3. But can I move there? In snake, moving into the tail is sometimes allowed if the tail moves away, but here (5,5) is not the tail; it's a body part.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment that is not the tail is deadly.\n\n(5,5) is index 3, which is not the tail. Tail is the last segment. Let's find the tail.\n\nSnake positions: 18 segments, so tail is at index 17: (3,3)\n\n(5,5) is index 3, which is part of the body, not tail. So moving to (5,5) would collide with body, death.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (5,5) is not safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (4,4): what is at (4,4)? Let's see if it's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), ... (5,4) is index 4, which is at (5,4). (4,4) is not in the list. Let's check all:\n\n(4,5) head, (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\n(4,4) is not occupied by snake. Similarly, (3,5) is not in the list, so empty.\n\nBut (3,5) is within bounds? x=3,y=5, between 1 and 6, yes.\n\nAlso, walls: no walls at (3,5) or (4,4), except borders which are fine.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (4,4) or Left to (3,5). Right to (5,5) is blocked by body.\n\nNow, also, food: we have food at (1,2) and (2,5).\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2, which is playable.\n\n(2,5) at x=2,y=5.\n\nNow, head at (4,5). So (2,5) is two steps left? From (4,5) to (3,5) then to (2,5), so if I move left to (3,5), I can reach (2,5) in the next turn, but need to see if it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is farther, at (1,2), which is down and left.\n\nBut life span: (1,2) has life span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (1,2), life_span=8 at turn 73. So it will disappear after turn 73 + 8 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 73, life_span=8, so after this turn, it will have life_span 7, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears.\n\nIt says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo if life_span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns? Let's interpret.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, it will be gone.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, countdown is N; after turn t, it becomes N-1; after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), it becomes 1, then after turn t + N, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t + (N-1), inclusive? I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span=N, it is present. After turn t is executed, life_span becomes N-1. If life_span becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – but when does it decrease? Probably at the end of the turn or beginning.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it will be available during turn t, and after turn t, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears for future turns.\n\nSimilarly, if L=0, it is not present.\n\nIn this case, for (1,2) at turn 73, life_span=8, so it will be available for turns 73, 74, ..., up to turn 73+7=80? Let's calculate: from turn 73 to turn 73 + (8-1) = 80, since it decreases after each turn.\n\nStart of turn 73: life_span=8, available.\n\nAfter turn 73: life_span=7\n\nAfter turn 74: life_span=6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 80: life_span=0, disappears, so not available on turn 81.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,5), life_span=10, available from turn 73 to 82.\n\nNow back to moves.\n\nI need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 73.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: Down to (4,4) or Left to (3,5). Right to (5,5) is blocked.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food; otherwise, the tail moves, so length stays the same.\n\nCurrently no food at (4,4) or (3,5), so moving there won't eat food, so snake will move forward, tail moves, so positions change.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4):\n\n- Head moves to (4,4)\n\n- Body follows: the segment at (4,5) becomes new body part, but since no growth, the tail (3,3) is removed, so new positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) — tail was (3,3), but removed, so new tail is (4,3)? Let's see the list.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0 to 17.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,4), new head at (4,4). The body: the old head (4,5) becomes segment 1, old segment 1 (4,6) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to old segment 16 (4,3) becomes segment 17 (tail), and old tail (3,3) is removed since no growth.\n\nSegments: old index 0: (4,5) -> becomes body segment 1\n\nOld index 1: (4,6) -> body segment 2\n\nOld index 2: (5,6) -> body segment 3\n\nOld index 3: (5,5) -> body segment 4\n\nOld index 4: (5,4) -> body segment 5\n\nOld index 5: (6,4) -> body segment 6\n\nOld index 6: (6,3) -> body segment 7\n\nOld index 7: (6,2) -> body segment 8\n\nOld index 8: (6,1) -> body segment 9\n\nOld index 9: (5,1) -> body segment 10\n\nOld index 10: (4,1) -> body segment 11\n\nOld index 11: (3,1) -> body segment 12\n\nOld index 12: (2,1) -> body segment 13\n\nOld index 13: (2,2) -> body segment 14\n\nOld index 14: (3,2) -> body segment 15\n\nOld index 15: (4,2) -> body segment 16\n\nOld index 16: (4,3) -> body segment 17 (new tail)\n\nOld index 17: (3,3) -> removed\n\nSo new positions: head (4,4), then [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] with (4,3) as tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,5):\n\nHead to (3,5), then body: old head (4,5) becomes segment 1, old segment 1 (4,6) segment 2, ..., up to old segment 16 (4,3) segment 17, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] with (4,3) tail.\n\nNow, the food at (2,5) is at (2,5), which is adjacent to (3,5). From (3,5), I can move left to (2,5) to eat it, but need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, for turn 73, I need to choose an action.\n\nI should consider going for the food.\n\n(2,5) is close, only one move away if I go left first.\n\nIf I move left to (3,5) on turn 73, then on turn 74, I can move left to (2,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and new segment added.\n\nBut I need to check if moving to (2,5) is safe.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (2,5), the tail is at (4,3) before eating, which is not adjacent to (2,5), so no problem.\n\n(2,5) and (4,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(2,5) to (4,3) is not adjacent; difference in x and y.\n\nSo safe to eat.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so positions change.\n\nNow, the other food at (1,2) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nAlso, the grid has an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, let's think about the board state.\n\nI should sketch the grid to see where the snake is.\n\nGrid from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's list occupied cells.\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nBody: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nFood: (1,2) and (2,5)\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is occupied? (2,1), (2,2) are snake body, (1,2) is food, not snake.\n\n(1,2) is a separate cell, not occupied by snake.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is empty, not snake.\n\nNow, possible paths.\n\nIf I move left to (3,5) on turn 73, then to (2,5) on turn 74 to eat food.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5) on turn 74:\n\n- Head moves to (2,5)\n\n- Since food eaten, snake grows, so tail does not move. New head at (2,5), old head (3,5) becomes new segment 1, and so on, up to old tail (4,3) becomes segment 18, and since growth, a new segment is added at the tail position, but tail didn't move, so positions: new head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) and new tail at (4,3)? Let's see.\n\nBefore eating, positions: for turn 74, if I move to (2,5), previous head was at (3,5) from turn 73 action.\n\nAssume turn 73: move left to (3,5), so at start of turn 74, head at (3,5), body: (4,5), (4,6), ..., (4,3) as per earlier.\n\nThen turn 74: move left to (2,5), which has food. So eat food.\n\nNew head at (2,5)\n\nOld head (3,5) becomes segment 1\n\nOld segment 1 (4,5) becomes segment 2\n\nOld segment 2 (4,6) becomes segment 3\n\n...\n\nUp to old segment 17 (4,3) becomes segment 18\n\nAnd since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of the old tail, which was (4,3), so new segment 19 at (4,3). So tail is now at (4,3), but with growth, the last segment is new, so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) — and since growth, new tail at (4,3), but it's the same cell, but now it's the 19th segment.\n\nOriginal snake had 18 segments, after eating, 19 segments.\n\nThe cell (4,3) is still occupied, but now it's the tail.\n\nThen for future moves.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,5), head at (2,5), and direction would be left, since moved left.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But need to avoid instant reverse, but since last move was left, to (2,5), so current direction is L, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nNow, what's around: (2,4) down, (2,6) up, (1,5) left, (3,5) right but cannot since reverse.\n\n(3,5) is now body segment, so cannot move right anyway.\n\n(2,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: after growth, (3,5) is segment 1, (4,5) segment 2, etc., (2,1), (2,2) are segments, but (2,4) is not in list, so empty.\n\n(2,6): y=6, within bounds? y=6 is not wall, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Is it occupied? Not in snake, so empty.\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, playable, not occupied.\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) still.\n\nNow, if I go down to (2,4), or up to (2,6), or left to (1,5).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is down and left from (2,5).\n\nTo reach (1,2), from (2,5), I could go down to (2,4), then left to (1,4) or down to (2,3), etc., but (1,2) is at y=2.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nThe other option was to move down to (4,4) on turn 73.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4) on turn 73.\n\nThen head at (4,4), no food, so tail moves, positions as earlier.\n\nFrom (4,4), direction is down, so possible moves: D, L, R (not U).\n\nDown to (4,3), but (4,3) is the tail? In the new positions after moving down, tail is at (4,3), which is segment 17.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), since it's the tail, it might be safe, because the tail will move away.\n\nRules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is allowed only if it's the tail cell.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (4,4), tail is at (4,3).\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), since it's tail, and no food there, so head moves to (4,3), tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nThen new positions: head at (4,3), old head (4,4) becomes body, and tail (4,3) was there, but since head moves to it, and tail moves away, it should be ok.\n\nBut in terms of positions: when head moves to (4,3), which was tail, but since no growth, the tail is removed, and new tail is the previous segment.\n\nAfter turn 73 move down to (4,4): positions: head (4,4), body: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\nThen turn 74: move down to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is current tail, and no food there, so head moves to (4,3), which was tail, so effectively, the tail position is vacated, and head occupies it.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — and old tail (4,3) is now head, so segment 17 removed, new tail is (4,2).\n\n(4,2) was segment 16, now becomes tail.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut in this case, I'm not going towards food immediately.\n\nNow, back to the choice.\n\nIf I go for the food at (2,5), I can get it in two turns: turn 73 left to (3,5), turn 74 left to (2,5) eat.\n\nScore +1.\n\nThen from (2,5), I need to plan next moves.\n\nThe other food at (1,2) has life span 8, so available until turn 80 (since turn 73:8, 74:7, ..., 80:1, 81:0 gone).\n\nTurn 73: life_span=8, after turn 73, becomes 7, so available on turn 74 with 7, ..., turn 80 with 1, after turn 80, gone, so not on turn 81.\n\nSo I have until turn 80 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) has life_span=10, available until turn 82.\n\nBut (2,5) will be eaten soon if I go that way.\n\nNow, after eating (2,5), head at (2,5), I can go for (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (1,2): I can go left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), down to (1,3), down to (1,2), but that might not be efficient.\n\nOr down to (2,4), then left to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut need to see if the path is clear.\n\nAlso, there is the snake body around.\n\nCurrent body after eating (2,5): head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4) to (6,4), etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I move left to (1,5), it's empty, no wall, not body.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move down to (1,4), etc. to (1,2).\n\n(1,4), (1,3), (1,2) should be empty, I think.\n\n(1,2) has food, but (1,3) and (1,4) are not occupied by snake, as per positions.\n\nAlso, walls: no internal walls there.\n\nSo path to (1,2) is open.\n\nIf I move down from (2,5) to (2,4), (2,4) is empty? Not in snake positions, so yes.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can move left to (1,4), or down to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) might be empty, but let's not digress.\n\nNow, the other choice: if on turn 73 I move down to (4,4), then I can go towards (2,5) later, but (2,5) might be eaten by then? No, only one snake.\n\nBut (2,5) has life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut if I go down, I might miss the opportunity to get (2,5) easily.\n\nMoreover, from (4,4), if I go left to (3,4) or something, but (3,4) might be empty.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nThe snake is long, 18 segments, and the board is 6x6 playable, minus walls and obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6=36 cells, minus internal wall at (5,2), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 18 cells, so 17 empty cells? 35 total, snake 18, so 17 free, but with two food, so 15 empty non-food cells.\n\nAfter eating food, snake grows, space decreases.\n\nLong-term survival: I need to have space to move without trapping myself.\n\nFor example, the area around (1,1) to (2,2) has body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), etc.\n\n(1,1) is free, I think.\n\nList all free cells to see.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: (5,2) is wall, not playable.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead (4,5)\n\nBody: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) and (2,5), but food cells are not occupied by snake, so they are free but have food.\n\nFree cells (no snake, no wall, no food): \n\n(1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5) has food, (2,6)\n\n(3,3) snake, (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n(4,4) — not snake, not wall, not food\n\n(5,3) — not in snake, wall only at (5,2), so (5,3) free\n\n(6,5), (6,6)\n\nAnd (1,2) food, (2,5) food.\n\nAlso, (3,4) free, (3,5) free, etc.\n\nSpecifically: free non-food cells: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(5,3): is it free?

(3,6) not in positions, yes.\n\nSo several free cells.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), snake grows, one less free cell.\n\nBut also, the food at (1,2) can be eaten.\n\nNow, back to turn 73 decision.\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), I can eat (2,5) on turn 74.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (1,5) or (2,4), etc.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4), I can then go to (3,4) or something, but (2,5) is still there, but I might take longer to get it.\n\nBut (2,5) has high life, so ok.\n\nHowever, there might be a risk if I don't go for it, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is coiled, and I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (4,4), then to (4,3), but (4,3) is tail, so it moves.\n\nBut from (4,4), I could go left to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,5) or (2,4) or (3,3), but (3,3) is body.\n\n(3,3) is tail or body? In current, (3,3) is tail, but after moving to (4,4), tail is at (4,3), so (3,3) is not occupied anymore? After move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is free.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can move left to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move up to (3,5) or down to (3,3) or left to (2,4).\n\n(3,5) is free, (2,4) free, (3,3) free.\n\nThen to (2,5) from there.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nWhereas by going left directly, I get the food faster.\n\nAlso, getting food increases length, but also gives points, and I need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but I have to survive.\n\nSince both foods are positive, eating them is beneficial.\n\nBut with long snake, space is tight, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, the top-left area has some free cells, but also the food at (1,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,5), if I go to (1,5), then down to (1,4), (1,3), to (1,2) to eat, but when I eat (1,2), I need to see the situation.\n\nAlso, the tail might be elsewhere.\n\nBut let's simulate a few turns.\n\nOption 1: Turn 73 move Left to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 74: move Left to (2,5) eat food. Score +1, length 19.\n\nNow head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5) (since no instant reverse, can't go R to (3,5))\n\n(2,6) free, (2,4) free, (1,5) free.\n\nSay I go L to (1,5) to head towards (1,2).\n\nTurn 74: move to (1,5)\n\nNo food, so tail moves? After eating on turn 74, head at (2,5), with 19 segments.\n\nOn turn 75, move to (1,5): no food there, so head to (1,5), tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail was at (4,3), but after growth, tail is at (4,3), and since no food eaten, tail moves away, so new tail is the previous one.\n\nAfter turn 74 eat at (2,5): positions as above, tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 75: move to (1,5), no food, so head to (1,5), old head (2,5) becomes body, ..., up to segment 18 (4,3) is removed, new tail is segment 17 which was (4,2)? Positions: let's not list all, but tail moves forward.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4) on turn 76, then D to (1,3) on turn 77, then D to (1,2) on turn 78 to eat food.\n\nTurn 78: life_span of (1,2) is 8 at turn 73.\n\nTurn 73: life_span=8\n\nTurn 74: 7\n\nTurn 75: 6\n\nTurn 76: 5\n\nTurn 77: 4\n\nTurn 78: 3, so still available.\n\nEat at (1,2) on turn 78, score another +1.\n\nThen head at (1,2), and I need to find a way out.\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), R to (2,2), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo U, R, or D.\n\n(1,3) might be free, (2,2) is body? After eating, positions change.\n\nBut this is getting ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to choose for turn 73.\n\nThe other option: if I move down to (4,4) on turn 73.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go left to (3,4) or down to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to get to (2,5), it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 73: down to (4,4)\n\nTurn 74: left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 75: up to (3,5)\n\nTurn 76: left to (2,5) eat.\n\nSo I eat on turn 76 instead of turn 74, so later, but still within life span.\n\nSimilarly for (1,2).\n\nBut I get the point later.\n\nSince I want to maximize score, getting food earlier might be better, but score is just cumulative, so timing doesn't matter, as long as I eat before it disappears.\n\nBut with long snake, moving around might be risky.\n\nIn the first option, by going left, I eat (2,5) on turn 74, then (1,2) around turn 78.\n\nIn the second option, eat (2,5) on turn 76, then (1,2) later.\n\nBut (1,2) disappears after turn 80, so I have time.\n\nTurn 80 is the last turn it can be eaten.\n\nIn first option, I eat on turn 78, fine.\n\nIn second, if I eat (2,5) on turn 76, then from there to (1,2), similar path, say turn 77 to (1,5), turn 78 to (1,4), turn 79 to (1,3), turn 80 to (1,2) eat, still on time.\n\nBut turn 80 is the last chance.\n\nNow, after eating both foods, snake is longer, 20 segments? Originally 18, eat two, so 20.\n\nBoard has 35 cells, snake 20, so 15 free, but with no food, it's ok, but I need to survive.\n\nBut I can move around.\n\nBut the problem is that the snake body might block paths.\n\nFor example, in the top-left, after eating (1,2), head at (1,2), with body around.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk of dead end.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going for (2,5) immediately, but it seems safe.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), which might affect movement in that area.\n\nBut currently, the snake is not near there.\n\nThe area around (6,1) to (6,4) has body, so bottom-right is occupied.\n\nFree cells are scattered.\n\nBut in the short term, going left to (3,5) seems fine.\n\nBut on turn 73, moving to (3,5), is it safe?\n\n(3,5) is free, no issue.\n\nThen to (2,5) on turn 74.\n\nBut when I move to (2,5), it has food, so I eat.\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail is at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo ok.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4), also safe.\n\nBut moving down might lead me into a tighter spot.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), if I move down to (4,3), which is tail, safe, then from (4,3), I can move left to (3,3) or down to (4,2), but (4,2) is body? After moving to (4,4), positions have (4,2) as segment 16, body.\n\nAfter move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is occupied, (4,3) tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), move down to (4,3): head to (4,3), which was tail, so new head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), etc., and tail removed, new tail at (4,2)? Old segment 16 (4,2) becomes new tail.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move left to (3,3) or down to (4,2) but (4,2) is now tail, so I can move there if I want.\n\nBut (3,3) is free now? After move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) is free.\n\nI can move left to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move up to (3,4) or left to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut to get to (2,5), I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,4), then (3,5), then (2,5).\n\nSo more turns.\n\nWhereas by going left directly, I save turns and eat food faster.\n\nMoreover, by eating food, I increase length, but I also get points, and since the board has space, it should be ok.\n\nBut let's think about the long-term.\n\nThe food at (1,2) is in the bottom-left, and the snake body is there, but after moving, it might clear.\n\nI should consider the tail position.\n\nAnother point: \"Special Cases: Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n\nBut here, foods are not under body; (1,2) and (2,5) are free cells.\n\n(2,5) is free, (1,2) is free.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps for turn 73, moving left to (3,5) is better to get the food quickly.\n\nThen I can plan to get (1,2) later.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat both foods.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output for the next few turns? The answer format is to output actions starting from turn t1, for several turns.\n\nIt says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns; I think I need to provide a sequence, but since it's a game, I should provide for as long as I can, but probably for the immediate actions where the decision is clear.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, I can provide a plan for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 73, I think moving left is good.\n\nThen turn 74 move left to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can decide later.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output for turns 73 to 77 or something.\n\nLet's define a sequence.\n\nI think: Turn 73: L (to (3,5))\n\nThen Turn 74: L (to (2,5) eat)\n\nThen from (2,5), I need to go to (1,2), so move L to (1,5) on turn 75.\n\nThen D to (1,4) on turn 76.\n\nThen D to (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nThen D to (1,2) on turn 78 to eat.\n\nBut turn 78 is beyond 5 turns from 73, but I can output up to where I have a plan.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is for actions.\n\nTo be safe, I can output for turns 73 to 77.\n\nBut on turn 77, I move to (1,3), not eating yet.\n\nI need to ensure that moving to (1,5), (1,4), etc. is safe.\n\nOn turn 75, from (2,5) move L to (1,5): (1,5) should be free, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) free, (1,3) free.\n\n(1,3) might be free, but let's confirm.\n\nAfter turn 74, after eating (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\nFree cells include (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), etc.\n\nSo (1,5) free.\n\nTurn 75: move L to (1,5), no food, so tail moves.\n\nThen turn 76: move D to (1,4), no food.\n\nTurn 77: move D to (1,3), no food.\n\nTurn 78: move D to (1,2) eat.\n\nAll these cells should be free until (1,2).\n\n(1,3) and (1,4) are free, yes.\n\nAfter moves, the tail moves, so cells might free up, but since I'm moving down, it should be ok.\n\nIs there a risk at (1,2)? When I eat at (1,2), head at (1,2), then I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3), R to (2,2), or D to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) is body? After turn 78, when I eat at (1,2), the positions will include (2,2) as body, depending on the path.\n\nBut at that time, (2,2) might be part of the body, but since the snake is moving, it might have moved.\n\nFor example, on turn 78, when I move to (1,2) to eat, previous head was at (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nAfter turn 77 move to (1,3): let's not track all, but (2,2) might still be occupied or not.\n\nSince the tail is moving, some cells are freed.\n\nBut to be safe, from (1,2), I can move up to (1,3) or right to (2,2) if free, or down to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is free, and (1,3) will be free since I just left it, assuming no one else.\n\nIn this path, when I move from (1,3) to (1,2) on turn 78, (1,3) is vacated, so I can move back up if needed, but better not to reverse immediately.\n\nBut at that point, I can decide to move right to (2,2) or down to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) might be occupied; in the initial positions, (2,2) is body, but after many moves, it might be different.\n\nFor example, the body at (2,2) could have moved.\n\nBut in the sequence, by turn 78, the tail has moved, so (2,2) might be free or not, but I think it's possible that it's still occupied.\n\nTo avoid risk, I should move to (1,1) or (1,3).\n\n(1,1) is free, so I can go there.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut for now, the plan to eat both foods seems feasible.\n\nIf I go down on turn 73, I might take longer, and with less time for (1,2), but still possible.\n\nBut since going left gets food faster and seems safe, I think it's better.\n\nMoreover, by moving left, I avoid the bottom area where the snake is denser.\n\nSo I think for turn 73, move Left.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as above.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide actions.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 73.\n\nI can provide:\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: L (to eat (2,5))\n\nThen Turn 75: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 76: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 77: D (to (1,3))\n\nBut on turn 77, I move to (1,3), then turn 78 to (1,2) eat, but turn 78 is not in the sequence if I stop at 77.\n\nSince the instruction is to think ahead but output for immediate actions, perhaps I can output for turns 73 to 75 or so.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's output for 5 turns: 73 to 77.\n\nActions: 73 L, 74 L, 75 L, 76 D, 77 D\n\nBut on turn 75, moving to (1,5), which is left from (2,5), direction left.\n\nThen turn 76 down to (1,4), so direction changes to down, no instant reverse issue.\n\nSimilarly, turn 77 down to (1,3).\n\nThen beyond, I can go down to (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nBut for the answer, I think up to 77 is fine.\n\nIf I move down on turn 73, the sequence would be different.\n\nBut I think L is better.\n\nAnother consideration: the head direction.\n\nOn turn 73, head direction is D, moving left, which is perpendicular, so new direction is L.\n\nThen turn 74 move left again, fine.\n\nTurn 75 move left to (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 76 down, ok.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps I should check for any immediate danger.\n\nFor example, after moving to (3,5) on turn 73, what is around.\n\n(3,5): neighbors: (3,6) up, (3,4) down, (2,5) left, (4,5) right.\n\n(4,5) is body, so cannot go right.\n\n(2,5) is food, so I go there.\n\n(3,6) and (3,4) free, but I go left.\n\nSimilarly, all seems safe.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned multiple turns ahead, considering the snake's position, food locations with their life spans, movement constraints, and collision risks. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (2,5) quickly, as it is only one move away after positioning the head at (3,5), and it has a life span of 10 (available until turn 82).\n- Then, navigate toward (1,2) to eat it before it disappears (life span 8, available until turn 80).\n- Avoid the internal obstacle at (5,2) and walls.\n- Ensure no collisions with the body or walls, leveraging the tail movement rule when safe.\n- Prioritize eating food to increase score, but only when it doesn't risk immediate danger or trapping the snake.\n\n### Analysis for Turn 73:\n- **Current head position**: (4,5), direction Down (D).\n- **Possible moves**: \n  - Down (D) to (4,4): Safe, empty cell.\n  - Left (L) to (3,5): Safe, empty cell, and positions the head to eat (2,5) next turn.\n  - Right (R) to (5,5): Deadly, as (5,5) is a body segment (not the tail).\n- **Optimal move**: Left (L) to (3,5). This move:\n  - Avoids the body and walls.\n  - Sets up to eat (2,5) on turn 74 for +1 score.\n  - Does not risk tail reward danger (tail at (4,3) is not adjacent to (2,5)).\n\n### Plan for Subsequent Turns (5+ Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 74**: Move Left (L) from (3,5) to (2,5) to eat the food. Score +1, snake length increases to 19.\n- **Turn 75**: From (2,5), move Left (L) to (1,5). This is safe and efficient for reaching (1,2). Direction is Left, so moving Left is consistent (no instant reverse).\n- **Turn 76**: From (1,5), move Down (D) to (1,4). Continues the path to (1,2) without risk.\n- **Turn 77**: From (1,4), move Down (D) to (1,3). Keeps the snake moving toward (1,2) safely.\n- **Longer-term (beyond turn 77)**: On turn 78, move Down (D) to (1,2) to eat the food (life span ensures availability). Then, from (1,2), move to adjacent safe cells like (1,1) or (1,3) to avoid dead ends.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats (2,5) by turn 74 and (1,2) by turn 78, maximizing score early while both foods are available.\n- **Safety**: All moves avoid body collisions and walls. Moving to (1,5), (1,4), and (1,3) is safe as these cells are free (not occupied by snake or walls) based on the current state.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: \n  - No tail reward danger when eating (2,5) or (1,2), as the tail is never adjacent.\n  - The path to (1,2) is clear and minimizes turns, reducing entanglement risk with the long snake (18 segments initially).\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating both foods, the snake can navigate to open areas (e.g., (1,1) or (3,4)) to avoid trapping. The board has sufficient free cells (15 non-food free cells initially) for maneuvering.\n\n### Final Action Sequence (Turns 73 to 77):\nThis sequence executes the plan for the next 5 turns, ensuring immediate actions align with long-term goals.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 73: L (left)  \nTurn 74: L (left)  \nTurn 75: L (left)  \nTurn 76: D (down)  \nTurn 77: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 74, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,5), and it's moving left. The body segments are listed: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]. That's 18 segments, so the snake is pretty long.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 7. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 7 turns from now, so at turn 74 + 7 = 81.\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 9, so disappears at turn 74 + 9 = 83.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Walls: borders and (5,2).\n\nList all occupied cells by snake and obstacles to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nThe tail is at (4,3), I think. Positions are head first, so index 0 is head, index 1 to 17 are body, tail is last, which is (4,3).\n\nAlso, obstacle at (5,2).\n\nFood at (1,2) and (2,5).\n\nCurrent head direction is left, so from (3,5), moving left would be to (2,5). But (2,5) has food? Let's see.\n\n(2,5) is a food position, and it's also not occupied by snake body right now. Snake positions: (2,5) is not in the list; head is (3,5), then (4,5), etc. (2,5) is free, I think.\n\nList all snake cells to check.\n\nSnake: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nSo (2,5) is not occupied, and it has food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) has food, and it's not occupied by snake; (1,2) is not in the list.\n\nAlso, (5,2) is obstacle, not part of snake.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction left, so possible moves: since direction is left, I can go left, up, or down, but not right because of no instant reverse. Reverse would be right, which is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction: L (left), so from (3,5), moving left would be to (2,5).\n\nMoving up would be to (3,6), moving down to (3,4).\n\nMoving right to (4,5) is not allowed because it's reverse direction.\n\n(4,5) is also occupied by the body, so it's invalid anyway, but even if not, reverse is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check what (2,5) is: it has food, value +1.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), I eat the food, so snake grows by one, so the new head is at (2,5), and the tail doesn't move, so the snake length increases to 19.\n\nBut I need to check for risks.\n\nFirst, is moving to (2,5) safe? (2,5) is not a wall, not an obstacle, and not a body cell except possibly if it's the tail, but tail is at (4,3), not (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so after eating, the head is there, and since it grows, the tail stays, so no collision with body at that point.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (2,5). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,5) and (4,3) are not adjacent; (2,5) to (3,5) is adjacent, but (3,5) is the current head, not tail.\n\nTail is (4,3), which is at distance, not adjacent to (2,5). So no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm adjacency: from (2,5), adjacent cells are (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6). (3,5) is the current head position, which will become the second segment after move.\n\nAfter moving left to (2,5), the new positions: head at (2,5), then the previous head (3,5) becomes second, and so on, up to tail (4,3) which stays since we ate food, so tail doesn't move.\n\nSo the body cells: (3,5), (4,5), etc., all still there except the tail is fixed.\n\n(4,3) is tail, and since we grow, it stays, so snake positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] — now 19 segments.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction would be left, since we moved left.\n\nNow, from (2,5), possible moves: left to (1,5), up to (2,6), down to (2,4), or right to (3,5). But (3,5) is now the second segment, so moving right to (3,5) would cause collision, so invalid. Also, reverse direction: we moved left to get here, so right is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only left, up, down possible.\n\nBut (2,6): is it occupied? Snake has (4,6), (5,6), but not (2,6), and no walls or obstacles mentioned, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) not occupied, (1,5) not occupied.\n\nNow, but there's food at (1,2), which is far away.\n\nAlso, (2,5) food is eaten, so it will disappear.\n\nNow, but I need to think long-term. Eating (2,5) might be good, but let's see the other options.\n\nCurrent turn, from (3,5), I could move up or down instead.\n\nMove up to (3,6): is (3,6) available? Walls: y=7 is wall, but (3,6) is y=6, x=3, not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,2), not here. Snake positions: (4,6) is occupied, but (3,6) not in list, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, move down to (3,4): not occupied, not wall.\n\nNow, if I move up to (3,6), no food there, so snake moves, head to (3,6), tail moves to the next position, so the last segment (4,3) is removed, and new head at (3,6), direction up.\n\nThen positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ... up to (4,2), but (4,3) is gone, and since no growth, tail moved, so the segment before tail was (4,2)? Let's see the list: positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nAfter moving up to (3,6): new head (3,6), then (3,5) becomes second, then (4,5), (4,6), but (4,6) was there, now it's the fourth segment? Better to think: the body segments shift, so new positions: head (3,6), then previous head (3,5), then the rest: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). The tail was (4,3), but since no growth, it is removed, so the new tail is (4,2)? Positions: from index: after move, segment 0: (3,6), segment 1: (3,5), segment 2: (4,5), segment 3: (4,6), segment 4: (5,6), ..., up to segment 17: (4,2), since original segment 17 was (4,3), but tail moves, so segment 16 (4,2) becomes new tail? Original segments: 0: (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1), 14: (2,2), 15: (3,2), 16: (4,2), 17: (4,3)\n\nAfter moving up to (3,6), new head at (3,6), then segment 1 becomes (3,5), segment 2 becomes (4,5), segment 3 becomes (4,6), and so on, up to segment 17 becomes (4,2), and segment 17 (tail) is removed, so new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — 18 segments, same length.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut if I move to (2,5), I eat food and grow.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nAt (3,5), options:\n\n- Left to (2,5): eat food, grow to 19, head at (2,5)\n\n- Up to (3,6): no food, head at (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,4): no food, head at (3,4)\n\nI need to think about future moves and the food at (1,2) and (2,5), but (2,5) might be eaten now.\n\nAlso, life span: (1,2) has life span 7, so it will disappear at turn 81, current turn 74, so 7 turns left.\n\n(2,5) has life span 9, disappear at turn 83.\n\nSince (2,5) is close, I can eat it now.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), head at (2,5), then I can move left to (1,5), up to (2,6), down to (2,4), or right but right to (3,5) is invalid.\n\nNow, (1,5) is x=1,y=5, not wall, not occupied.\n\n(2,6) y=6, not wall, not occupied.\n\n(2,4) not occupied.\n\nBut there's food at (1,2), which is to the left and down.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving down to (2,4) gets me closer to (1,2), since (1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n\n(2,4) to (1,2) is not direct, need to go left and down.\n\nBut also, the snake body is below, so I need to navigate carefully.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are inside? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls, so the grid has cells from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, but let's confirm.\n\nFor example, snake has (6,1), (6,2), etc., and x=6 is not wall, since wall is x=7, so x=6 is playable. Similarly, y=6 is playable, y=7 is wall.\n\nIn the snake positions, (4,6) is there, y=6, and since y=7 is wall, y=6 should be ok.\n\nSimilarly, x=1, snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are inside, I think. (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nBut let's list all cells to be sure.\n\nFor example, (1,1): is it wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) is not wall, it's inside.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is inside.\n\nIn snake positions, (6,1) is there, x=6,y=1, not wall.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo grid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6, but with obstacle at (5,2).\n\nNow, food at (1,2) and (2,5).\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2, (2,5) at x=2,y=5.\n\nHead at (3,5).\n\nIf I move left to (2,5), eat food.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (1,5), (2,6), or (2,4).\n\nNow, (1,2) is at (1,2), which is below (1,5), so from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), then (1,3), then (1,2), but (1,2) has food, so I can eat it in a few moves.\n\nBut I need to check if that path is clear and safe.\n\nFirst, current turn 74, move to (2,5).\n\nTurn 75, head at (2,5), direction left (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: left to (1,5), up to (2,6), down to (2,4), right invalid.\n\nIf I go down to (2,4), then from (2,4), I can go left to (1,4), down to (2,3), etc., towards (1,2).\n\n(1,2) has life span 7, so from turn 74, it disappears at turn 81. Turn 74 is current, so after turn 74, life span decreases, so at turn 75, life span is 6, and so on, until turn 81 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (2,5), if not eaten now, life span 9, from turn 74, so at turn 75, life span 8, etc.\n\nBut I'm considering eating (2,5) now.\n\nThen from (2,5), if I go down to (2,4) on turn 75.\n\nTurn 75: at (2,5), move down to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is not occupied, no food there.\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: left to (1,4), right to (3,4), down to (2,3), up to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body? After moving to (2,4), the previous position (2,5) is now the second segment.\n\nPositions: after turn 74 move to (2,5), snake is at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), ..., (4,3) with 19 segments.\n\nAfter turn 75 move down to (2,4), new head (2,4), then (2,5) becomes second, (3,5) third, etc., and since no food, tail (4,3) is removed, so new tail is (4,2)? Original tail was (4,3), removed, so new positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — 19 segments? After growth to 19, then no food, so when moving, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length back to 18.\n\nInitial length 18, ate food on turn 74, so length 19. Then on turn 75, no food eaten, so move to (2,4), head at (2,4), tail removed, so length 18 again.\n\nPositions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — that's 19 positions? Let's count: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — that's 19, but after no food, it should be 18. I think I have an extra.\n\nInitial positions: 18 segments.\n\nAfter eating on turn 74, head to (2,5), tail stays, so 19 segments.\n\nOn turn 75, move to (2,4), no food, so head to (2,4), tail is removed. The tail before move was (4,3)? In the list, after turn 74, positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), ..., up to (4,3) tail.\n\nWhen moving to (2,4), new head (2,4), then the first body segment is (2,5), then (3,5), and so on, up to the segment that was second last, and the last segment (4,3) is removed, so new positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — (4,2) is the new tail, and (4,3) is gone. But (4,2) was in the list, now it's the last. So 18 segments: from (2,4) to (4,2), 18 cells.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go left to (1,4), down to (2,3), or right to (3,4), or up to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, invalid.\n\nUp to (2,5) is occupied and reverse direction not allowed, so only left, down, right.\n\n(1,4) is free, (2,3) free, (3,4) free? (3,4) not in snake positions.\n\nSnake has (5,4), but not (3,4).\n\nSo all possible.\n\nIf I want to go to (1,2), I can go down to (2,3) on turn 75.\n\nTurn 75: move down to (2,4)? From (2,5) to (2,4) is down, so at (2,4), direction down.\n\nThen turn 76: from (2,4), move down to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) free, no food.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction down.\n\nThen turn 77: move down to (2,2). But (2,2) is occupied by snake? In the current positions, (2,2) is a body segment.\n\nAfter turn 75, positions include (2,2)? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 75, positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied, at position 16 or something.\n\nIf on turn 76 I move to (2,3), new head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), etc., and tail (4,2) removed, so new positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] — tail is (3,2)\n\n(2,2) is now the second last or something? Positions: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,2), (3,2) — (2,2) is at index 17, (3,2) at 18? Let's index: 0: (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,1), 13: (5,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (3,1), 16: (2,1), 17: (2,2), 18: (3,2) — 19 segments? No, on turn 76, moving to (2,3) with no food, so from previous 18, after move, head new, tail removed, so 17 segments? Messy.\n\nStart from turn 74: after move to (2,5), length 19.\n\nTurn 75: move to (2,4), no food, so head to (2,4), tail removed, length 18.\n\nTurn 76: move to (2,3), no food, head to (2,3), tail removed, length 17.\n\nPositions after turn 76: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) — (2,2) is tail? (2,2) was position 17 in previous, but after removing tail, (2,2) is now the new tail? Previous positions before turn 76 move: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,2), (3,2) but (3,2) was tail? After turn 75: positions [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] — so (3,2) is tail.\n\nMove to (2,3), new head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (2,2), and (3,2) is removed, so new positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] — tail at (2,2).\n\nLength 18? 18 positions: from (2,3) to (2,2), but (2,2) is included, and it's 18 cells? List: 0:(2,3), 1:(2,4), 2:(2,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(4,5), 5:(4,6), 6:(5,6), 7:(5,5), 8:(5,4), 9:(6,4), 10:(6,3), 11:(6,2), 12:(6,1), 13:(5,1), 14:(4,1), 15:(3,1), 16:(2,1), 17:(2,2) — yes, 18 segments, tail at (2,2).\n\nNow on turn 77, from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2), but (2,2) is the tail! If I move to (2,2), it is occupied by the tail, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nCannot move down to (2,2).\n\nMove left to (1,3), or right to (3,3), or up to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, invalid.\n\nUp to (2,4) is occupied, so only left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) free, (3,3) free.\n\nBut I want to go to (1,2), so from (2,3), move down is invalid, so I have to go left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,3), then from (1,3), I can move down to (1,2), which has food.\n\nBut is (1,2) occupied? Currently, it's not, but when I move, I need to check.\n\nOn turn 77, at (2,3), move left to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) free, no food.\n\nHead at (1,3), direction left.\n\nThen turn 78: from (1,3), move down to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, on turn 77, after moving to (1,3), positions: new head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), etc., tail (2,2) removed? Previous tail was (2,2), so after move to (1,3), new positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — (2,1) is tail now? Previous positions: before turn 77 move, head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (2,1), (2,2) with tail (2,2).\n\nMove to (1,3), new head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (2,1), and (2,2) removed, so new positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] — tail at (2,1).\n\nLength 18.\n\nThen turn 78: move down to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) has food, so eat it, grow to 19.\n\nHead at (1,2), and tail (2,1) stays.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Head at (1,2), tail at (2,1), are they adjacent? (1,2) and (2,1) are not adjacent; adjacent would be (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,2) but x=0 wall, so (1,1), (1,3), (2,2). (2,1) is not adjacent to (1,2); they share a corner, but not an edge, so not adjacent. Adjacency is horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nEating (1,2) is safe.\n\nIn this path, I can eat both foods: (2,5) on turn 74 and (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nBut on turn 78, life span of (1,2) is: at turn 74, life span 7, so turn 74: life span 7, turn 75:6, turn 76:5, turn 77:4, turn 78:3, so on turn 78 it's still there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) eaten on turn 74.\n\nNow, but in the move to (2,3) on turn 76, I couldn't move down to (2,2) because it was tail, so I had to go to (1,3) then down.\n\nBut I could have gone right to (3,3) instead, but that might not help for (1,2).\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nNow, what about the other food? (2,5) is eaten, so only (1,2) left.\n\nBut there might be other areas.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (2,5) now and go directly to (1,2), but (2,5) is closer to head, and I can eat both.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks with eating (2,5) now.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), head at (2,5), and the body is around, but from (2,5) I can go down to (2,4) as above.\n\nAnother option: from (2,5), I could go left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), etc., to (1,2), similar path.\n\nBut (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2).\n\nOn turn 75, from (2,5) move left to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 76 move down to (1,4), turn 77 down to (1,3), turn 78 down to (1,2), same as above, eat on turn 78.\n\nBut on turn 78, from (1,3) down to (1,2), same.\n\nNow, the issue is that after eating (1,2), I need to think about survival, but for now, let's see the plan.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 79 or more.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but it's not in the way for this path.\n\nWhat if I don't eat (2,5) now? For example, from current (3,5), move down to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction down.\n\nThen I can go left to (2,4), down to (3,3), right to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is still there, and I can go to it later, but from (3,4), to (2,4) then up to (2,5), but (2,5) might be eaten or not.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, it stays for 9 turns.\n\nBut (1,2) has only 7 turns, so it's more urgent to eat (1,2) first.\n\nLife span 7 for (1,2), 9 for (2,5), so (1,2) will disappear sooner.\n\nTurn 74, (1,2) life span 7, so must be eaten by turn 80, since on turn 81 it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) by turn 83.\n\nSo (1,2) is priority because it has shorter life.\n\nDistance to (1,2) from (3,5): (3,5) to (1,2) is Δx=2, Δy=3, so Manhattan distance 5, so at least 5 moves if direct, but with body, might take more.\n\nSimilarly to (2,5) from (3,5) is adjacent, distance 1.\n\nSo eating (2,5) now is easy and gives +1, and I can still reach (1,2) in time.\n\nFor example, as above, eat (2,5) on turn 74, then by turn 78 eat (1,2), 4 moves later.\n\nTurn 74 to turn 78 is 4 turns, but from (2,5) to (1,2) in 3 moves: e.g., (2,5)->(2,4)->(2,3)->(2,2) but (2,2) might be occupied, or (2,5)->(1,5)->(1,4)->(1,3)->(1,2), 4 moves.\n\nIn my earlier plan, turn 74: to (2,5), eat.\n\nTurn 75: to (2,4) or (1,5)\n\nIf to (1,5), then turn 76 to (1,4), turn 77 to (1,3), turn 78 to (1,2), eat.\n\nYes, 4 moves after eating first food.\n\nAnd (1,2) eaten on turn 78, life span at turn 74:7, turn 75:6, turn 76:5, turn 77:4, turn 78:3, so still there.\n\nIf I go directly to (1,2) without eating (2,5), it might take more turns because of the body.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), move down to (3,4) on turn 74.\n\nThen from (3,4), move left to (2,4) on turn 75.\n\nThen from (2,4), move down to (2,3) on turn 76.\n\nThen from (2,3), as before, cannot move down to (2,2), so move left to (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nThen to (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nBut on turn 74, I didn't eat (2,5), so it's still there, and I can eat it later, but in this path, I didn't go to (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,4) on turn 76, I could go up to (2,5) to eat it, but let's see.\n\nAfter turn 74 move down to (3,4), no food, so positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., tail removed, so length 17? Initial 18, no eat, move to (3,4), head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ..., up to (4,3) or something, tail removed.\n\nInitial positions: 18 segments.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), no food, so new head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — tail (4,2)? Original tail (4,3) removed, so positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — 18 segments? 18 positions, tail (4,2).\n\n(4,3) gone.\n\nNow, (2,5) is free and has food.\n\nFrom (3,4), on turn 75, I can move left to (2,4), or down to (3,3), or right to (4,4), or up to (3,5) but occupied.\n\nSay move left to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) no food.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction left.\n\nThen from (2,4), on turn 76, I can move up to (2,5) to eat food, since (2,5) is free.\n\nMove up to (2,5), eat, grow.\n\nThen head at (2,5).\n\nThen I can go to (1,2) as before.\n\nBut from (2,5), to (1,2), same as before.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating (2,5) on turn 76 instead of turn 74, so I get the point later, but I still need to eat (1,2) by turn 80.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 76, I can go to (1,5) on turn 77, (1,4) on turn 78, (1,3) on turn 79, (1,2) on turn 80.\n\nEat (1,2) on turn 80, life span: at turn 80, if turn 74 life 7, turn 75:6, ..., turn 80:1, turn 81:0 disappear, so on turn 80 it is still there, can eat.\n\nBut compared to eating both earlier, I might have less time for other things, but since only two foods, it might be fine.\n\nBut in the first plan, I eat (2,5) on 74 and (1,2) on 78, both with margin.\n\nIn this delayed, I eat (2,5) on 76 and (1,2) on 80, which is tighter for (1,2).\n\nAlso, by eating (2,5) on 74, I have a longer snake when eating (1,2), but since both +1, score same, but snake longer might be riskier for movement.\n\nBut in this case, not critical.\n\nAnother point: after eating (1,2), I need to survive, and the grid might have less space.\n\nBut let's see the body positions.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the area around (1,2).\n\nAlso, there might be negative food, but not mentioned, so only positive.\n\nNow, back to current decision.\n\nI think eating (2,5) now is good.\n\nBut let's check if moving to (2,5) is safe.\n\n(2,5) is free, no wall, no obstacle, not body.\n\nAfter moving, head at (2,5), and I have options.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: when I go to eat (1,2), if the tail is adjacent, but as I saw, not.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,2) is on the border, x=1,y=2.\n\nWalls at x=0, so from (1,2), I can only go to (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), but (2,2) might be occupied.\n\nIn the plan, after eating (1,2) on turn 78, head at (1,2), then I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1)? But y=1, and walls at y=0, so (1,1) is inside, I think. y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable, so (1,1) is ok.\n\nOr up to (1,3), or right to (2,2).\n\nBut depending on where the body is.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, when I eat (1,2) on turn 78, positions: after move to (1,2), head at (1,2), then since ate food, tail stays, so previous tail was (2,1) or something.\n\nLet's not diverge.\n\nFor turn 74, I think moving left to (2,5) is a good move.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? For example, if I move up or down, I might avoid something.\n\nMove up to (3,6): from (3,5) up to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) free, no food.\n\nThen head at (3,6), direction up.\n\nThen I can go left to (2,6), up to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, or right to (4,6), but (4,6) is body, or down to (3,5) occupied.\n\nPossible moves: left to (2,6), right to (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied, so invalid, down to (3,5) occupied and reverse, invalid.\n\nUp to (3,7) wall.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) free, no food.\n\nSo I have to go to (2,6) on turn 75.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go left to (1,6), down to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) has food, I can go down to eat it.\n\nBut it takes extra moves.\n\nSimilarly, move down from current to (3,4), as before.\n\nBut eating (2,5) now seems efficient.\n\nMoreover, the head direction is left, so moving left is natural.\n\nSo I think for turn 74, move left to (2,5).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan to eat (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down to (2,4) or left to (1,5) or up to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is less useful for (1,2), so better down or left.\n\nSay I go down to (2,4) on turn 75.\n\nThen to (2,3) on turn 76, but on turn 76, from (2,4) to (2,3), but earlier we saw that at (2,3), I cannot move down to (2,2) because it might be body.\n\nIn the sequence after eating (2,5), on turn 75 move to (2,4), positions as before.\n\nThen turn 76: from (2,4) move to (2,3).\n\nThen at (2,3), as before, (2,2) is occupied or will be tail.\n\nIn positions after turn 75: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), etc., and (2,2) is a body segment.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3) on turn 76, head at (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., and (2,1), (2,2) with (2,2) as tail or something.\n\nBefore turn 76 move: positions after turn 75: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — tail at (4,2)? List: 0:(2,4), 1:(2,5), 2:(3,5), 3:(4,5), 4:(4,6), 5:(5,6), 6:(5,5), 7:(5,4), 8:(6,4), 9:(6,3), 10:(6,2), 11:(6,1), 12:(5,1), 13:(4,1), 14:(3,1), 15:(2,1), 16:(2,2), 17:(3,2), 18:(4,2) — tail (4,2).\n\nMove to (2,3), new head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to (3,2), and (4,2) removed, so positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] — tail at (3,2).\n\nNow (2,2) is occupied, at index 17.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move down to (2,2)? (2,2) is occupied, so collision if I move there.\n\nMove left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) free, (3,3) free.\n\nTo reach (1,2), go left to (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nThen to (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from (2,5) on turn 75, I go left to (1,5) instead.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction left.\n\nThen turn 76 move down to (1,4), turn 77 to (1,3), turn 78 to (1,2), eat.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nI think it's consistent.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 74.\n\nSo plan for turn 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, and perhaps more.\n\nSince I eat (1,2) on turn 78, I can go up to turn 79 or 80.\n\nBut let's define the actions.\n\nTurn 74: move left to (2,5), eat food.\n\nThen, say, on turn 75: move left to (1,5) or down to (2,4)? Both possible, but moving left to (1,5) might be more direct for (1,2).\n\n(1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (1,5) is left, then to (1,4) down, etc.\n\nDirections: at (2,5), after moving left to get there, direction left.\n\nMove left to (1,5): that's still left, so direction left.\n\nThen from (1,5), move down to (1,4): now direction down.\n\nThen to (1,3) down, to (1,2) down.\n\nIf I go down to (2,4) first, then to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut going directly left then down might be shorter path to (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (1,5) is one step left, then to (1,4) down, (1,3) down, (1,2) down, so from (2,5) to (1,2) in 4 moves: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — but (1,2) is the fourth cell.\n\nPositions: start from (2,5), after turn 74.\n\nTurn 75: move left to (1,5)\n\nTurn 76: move down to (1,4)\n\nTurn 77: move down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 78: move down to (1,2), eat.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I go down first: turn 75 to (2,4), turn 76 to (2,3), turn 77 to (1,3), turn 78 to (1,2), same number of moves.\n\nBut from (2,3) to (1,3) is left, not down.\n\nIn terms of turns, same.\n\nBut going left then down keeps me near the border, which might be safer or riskier, but since walls, need to be careful.\n\nx=1 is near wall x=0, so if I go to (1,5), I can only move down or right or up, but up to (1,6) might be ok.\n\nBut in this case, moving down to (1,4), etc.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I can move to (1,1) or (1,3) or (2,2).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left corner, might be trapping.\n\nBut let's not worry for now.\n\nSo for the plan:\n\nTurn 74: L (left to (2,5))\n\nTurn 75: L (left to (1,5))  // from (2,5) move left to (1,5)\n\nAt (2,5), move left to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 76: D (down to (1,4))\n\nTurn 77: D (down to (1,3))\n\nTurn 78: D (down to (1,2), eat)\n\nNow, for turn 79, I need to move from (1,2).\n\nAfter eating, head at (1,2), direction down (since last move down).\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1), left invalid (x=0 wall), right to (2,2), up to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) might be body, depending on positions.\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (1,2), ate food, so positions: before move, on turn 77, head at (1,3)? Let's trace positions.\n\nAfter turn 77: when I move to (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nFirst, after turn 74: head at (2,5), positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) — but after eating on turn 74, tail (4,3) stays, so 19 segments.\n\nThen turn 75: move left to (1,5), no food (assuming), so head to (1,5), tail removed, positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — tail at (4,2)\n\nThen turn 76: move down to (1,4), no food, head to (1,4), tail removed, positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)] — tail (3,2)\n\nThen turn 77: move down to (1,3), no food, head to (1,3), tail removed, positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] — tail (2,2)\n\nThen turn 78: move down to (1,2), eat food, so grow, head to (1,2), tail (2,2) stays, positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] — 20 segments, tail at (2,2)\n\nNow head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,1), up to (1,3), right to (2,2).\n\nBut (1,3) is occupied (second segment), (2,2) is tail, but since we just ate, (2,2) is the tail, and head moving to (2,2) would cause collision because tail is there? But when we move, the tail will move only if we don't eat, but here we ate, so tail stays.\n\nIf I move right to (2,2), (2,2) is occupied by the tail, so head touches body, collision.\n\nSimilarly, up to (1,3) is occupied by body.\n\nDown to (1,1) is free, I assume.\n\n(1,1) not in positions, not wall, so should be free.\n\nLeft to (0,2) invalid, wall.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,1).\n\nThen on turn 79: move down to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) no food, so head to (1,1), tail removed if no eat, but since we ate on turn 78, on turn 79 no eat, so tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 78, positions with 20 segments, tail at (2,2).\n\nMove to (1,1), no food, so new head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), etc., and tail (2,2) removed? The last segment is removed.\n\nPositions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — and (2,2) removed, so tail at (2,1).\n\nLength 19.\n\nThen from (1,1), I can move right to (2,1) or up to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, (2,1) might be body or not.\n\n(2,1) is in positions, occupied.\n\nAfter move, positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (2,1), so (2,1) is the tail.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: up to (1,2) occupied, invalid; left to (0,1) wall; down to (1,0) wall; right to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is the tail, but since it's the tail, and we move to it, it might be ok? No, collision rule: head touches any body segment, including tail, but when moving to a cell that will be vacated by tail, it's ok, but here, since we don't eat, the tail moves away.\n\nStandard snake: if head moves to the cell that was tail, and tail moves, then no collision, because the tail leaves the cell before head arrives? In this model, when the snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and tail is removed from its cell, so if head moves to the current tail cell, since tail leaves, it might be empty when head arrives.\n\nBut in terms of collision, if the new head position is the same as any body segment before the move, it collides, except if it's the tail and no growth.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to the tail cell, and no food, tail moves, so it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, if food, tail stays, so collision.\n\nIn this case, on turn 79, from (1,1), moving to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is currently occupied by the tail, but since no food eaten, when we move, tail will move, so (2,1) becomes empty, head can move there safely.\n\nThen after move, head at (2,1), and so on.\n\nBut in this corner, it might be tight.\n\nFor the plan, since I need only 5 turns ahead, up to turn 79 or so.\n\nCurrent turn 74, plan for 74,75,76,77,78.\n\nTurn 78 is the last action in the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to list actions starting from turn 74.\n\nSo for turn 74: L\n\nThen turn 75: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 76: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 77: D (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 78: D (to (1,2))\n\nThat's 5 actions: turns 74 to 78.\n\nI can add turn 79 if needed, but 5 turns ahead means from 74 to 78 or 74 to 79? Think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions.\n\nThe answer should include at least the next 5 turns, I think.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the turns starting from current.\n\nIn the format: \\boxed{ Turn 74: action, Turn 75: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\"\n\nSince t1=74, so from 74 onwards.\n\nAnd I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nIn the core rules, it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan for at least 5 future actions.\n\nCurrent turn 74, so actions for 74,75,76,77,78,79? 5 actions: 74 to 78 is 5 turns? Turns: 74,75,76,77,78 — that's 5 actions.\n\n74 to 78 inclusive is 5 steps.\n\nTurn 74 action, then 75,76,77,78.\n\nYes.\n\nIn my plan, I have actions up to turn 78.\n\nFor turn 79, I can add if needed, but not necessary.\n\nTo be complete, after turn 78, head at (1,2), then on turn 79, I need to move down to (1,1) as the only choice, as above.\n\nBut since it's forced, I can include it.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,5) is eaten, (1,2) eaten, so no more food, but I need to survive.\n\nBut for the plan, eating both is good.\n\nPerhaps there is a better sequence.\n\nFor example, if I move down from (2,5) on turn 75 to (2,4), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2), same as before.\n\nBut from (2,3) to (1,3) is left, not down.\n\nIn terms of direction, it might not matter.\n\nI think the plan is fine.\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 74: L (left)\n\nTurn 75: L (left to (1,5))\n\nIn the action, it should be U, D, L, R.\n\nAnd in the box.\n\nAlso, for turn 76: D (down)\n\nTurn 77: D (down)\n\nTurn 78: D (down)\n\nBut on turn 78, moving to (1,2), which has food.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any risk in this path?\n\nAt (1,5), (1,4), etc., near the wall, but since I move down, it should be ok.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but it's not in the way.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the right, so left side is clearer.\n\nIn the positions, after moving left, the body is trailing.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo maximize survival, after eating both, I need to go to open area.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), after eating, go to (1,1), then to (2,1), etc., towards the center.\n\nBut for now, the plan is to eat the foods.\n\nSince both foods are positive and I eat them, score increases by 2.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) now, I might miss it or something, but I can eat later, but with shorter life for (1,2), better to eat (2,5) first.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating the positive food at (1,2) with a shorter life span (7 turns remaining) while safely consuming the food at (2,5) first, as it is adjacent to the current head position. The grid is 8x8 with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 and an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake starts at turn 74 with head at (3,5), direction left, and 18 segments. Both food items are positive (+1 score, +1 length when eaten).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (2,5) has a life span of 9 turns (disappears at turn 83), but is immediately accessible.\n  - (1,2) has a life span of 7 turns (disappears at turn 81), making it urgent to reach within 7 turns.\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 74)**: Moving left to (2,5) eats the food, increasing length to 19. This is safe as (2,5) is free and no tail reward danger exists (tail is at (4,3), not adjacent).\n- **Path to (1,2)**: From (2,5), moving left to (1,5) then down repeatedly reaches (1,2) by turn 78. This path avoids body collisions and uses the border efficiently.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - After eating (1,2) on turn 78, the only safe move is down to (1,1) to avoid body segments.\n  - The internal obstacle (5,2) is not on the path and poses no risk.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**: After eating both foods, the snake should move toward open areas (e.g., right from (1,1)) to avoid trapping itself, but this is beyond the 5-turn plan.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 74-78):\n1. **Turn 74**: Move left to (2,5) – Eats food at (2,5), score +1, length 19. Direction becomes left.\n2. **Turn 75**: Move left to (1,5) – Positions head for downward path to (1,2). No food, length remains 19. Direction becomes left.\n3. **Turn 76**: Move down to (1,4) – Continues path to (1,2). No food, length 19. Direction becomes down.\n4. **Turn 77**: Move down to (1,3) – Nears (1,2). No food, length 19. Direction becomes down.\n5. **Turn 78**: Move down to (1,2) – Eats food at (1,2), score +1, length 20. Direction becomes down.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 78, utilizing 4 turns to reach (1,2) from (2,5), well within its life span (3 turns remaining at turn 78). The actions avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions:\n- Turn 74: Moving left to (2,5) is valid (no reverse, cell free).\n- Turn 75: Moving left to (1,5) is valid (direction allows left, cell free).\n- Turn 76: Moving down to (1,4) is valid (cell free, no reverse).\n- Turn 77: Moving down to (1,3) is valid (cell free, no reverse).\n- Turn 78: Moving down to (1,2) is valid (cell free, eats food).\n\n### Additional Turn for Context (Survival Focus):\n- **Turn 79**: Move down to (1,1) – Only safe move from (1,2) (up to (1,3) and right to (2,2) are body segments; left is wall). No food, length 20. This prevents trapping and allows future movement toward open grid areas.\n\n**Output**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 74: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 75: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 76: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 77: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 78: D (down)\n}",

        "score": 18,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 75, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nThat's 19 segments. Let me count: positions from (2,5) to (4,3) – that's 19 cells, so the snake length is 19.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood: only one food item given: (1,2) with life span 6 and value 1. Since value is 1, it's positive food. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 81 if not eaten.\n\nNow, I need to think about possible moves. Since head direction is L, I can move U (up), D (down), or L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse means I can't move in the opposite direction immediately. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I can't move right. So possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nI need to evaluate the safety and potential of each move, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid with walls and snake positions for clarity.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at:\n\n- x=0 (left border)\n\n- x=7 (right border)\n\n- y=0 (bottom border)\n\n- y=7 (top border)\n\n- Internal obstacle at (5,2)\n\nSnake positions: I should plot these to see where the snake is.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\nRows y=7 to y=0 (top to bottom), columns x=0 to x=7.\n\ny=7: top, y=0: bottom.\n\nSnake head at (2,5). y=5 is row 5 from bottom? Better to think in coordinates.\n\nSet up a coordinate system: x from 0 to 7 left to right, y from 0 to 7 bottom to top? But in the problem, it might not specify, but typically in such games, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U is up, y increases as we go up. D is (x,y-1), down, y decreases.\n\nIn the state, it says U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nNow walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nList all snake segments in order:\n\n1. Head: (2,5)\n\n2. (3,5)\n\n3. (4,5)\n\n4. (4,6)\n\n5. (5,6)\n\n6. (5,5)\n\n7. (5,4)\n\n8. (6,4)\n\n9. (6,3)\n\n10. (6,2)  -- but (6,2) is not wall? Walls are borders and (5,2). (6,2) should be free, but snake is there.\n\n11. (6,1)\n\n12. (5,1)\n\n13. (4,1)\n\n14. (3,1)\n\n15. (2,1)\n\n16. (2,2)\n\n17. (3,2)\n\n18. (4,2)\n\n19. (4,3)\n\nAnd tail is (4,3).\n\nNow, food at (1,2) with life span 6, value 1.\n\nCurrent turn 75, life span 6, so it disappears after turn 80? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 75, life span 6, then turn 76:5, 77:4, 78:3, 79:2, 80:1, and gone at turn 81? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo if at turn t, life span is N, it will be present for N more turns? Let's see: \"life_span1\" is given as 6, and decreases each turn.\n\nIt says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if at turn t, life span is N, then at turn t, countdown is N, turn t+1: N-1, ..., down to turn t + (N-1): countdown=1, and then at turn t+N, it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + (N-1).\n\nIn this case, food at (1,2) with life span 6 at turn 75.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 75 to turn 80 (countdown 1), and disappears at turn 81.\n\nNow, the head is at (2,5), food is at (1,2). So (1,2) is left and down from head? Head (2,5), food (1,2): Δx = -1, Δy = -3, so not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5) with head direction L:\n\n- U (up): to (2,6)\n\n- D (down): to (2,4)\n\n- L (left): to (1,5)\n\n- R (right): not allowed, opposite direction.\n\nNow, I need to check if these moves are safe, meaning no wall collision or body collision.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. So (2,6): x=2, y=6, not border, no wall. (1,5): x=1, y=5, not border. (2,4): x=2,y=4, not border. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\nNow body collision: head moving to a cell that will be occupied by body when the snake moves.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away.\n\nCollision occurs if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment that will not be vacated by the tail moving. But since the tail moves, only the cell where the head moves must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, but if it's the tail, it might be okay because the tail moves.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving into a cell that is occupied by the tail is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nBut if it's occupied by any other body segment, it's a collision.\n\nAlso, after moving, the new head position should not be on a wall or body.\n\nNow, current body segments: from (2,5) to (4,3)\n\nList of all positions except head: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nTail is (4,3)\n\nNow, for each possible move from head (2,5):\n\n- U to (2,6): is (2,6) occupied by body? Current positions: (4,6) is there, but (2,6) is not in the list. Positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ... so (2,6) is not occupied. (4,6) is at (4,6), different. So (2,6) is free? But let's check if any body at (2,6). From list: no, (2,6) not mentioned. So (2,6) should be free.\n\n- D to (2,4): is (2,4) occupied? Not in list, so free.\n\n- L to (1,5): (1,5) not in list, so free.\n\nNow, also, after moving, the new head position should be within bounds, which it is for all.\n\nBut (1,5): x=1, y=5, not border, since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=1 is fine, not wall.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo all three moves seem possible without immediate collision.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for survival and food.\n\nFood is at (1,2), which is positive, and I might want to eat it, but it's not adjacent, so I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, there might be risks, like getting trapped or something.\n\nSince the snake is long, 19 segments, the board might be crowded.\n\nLet me sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nMake a grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is a single cell obstacle.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nNow, let's mark empty cells.\n\nBut it might be messy. Since I need to think about paths, I should consider the area around head.\n\nHead at (2,5), food at (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is occupied? No, food is at (1,2), and snake body is at (2,2), (3,2), etc., but (1,2) is not snake, it's food.\n\nSnake positions: (2,2) is segment 16, (3,2) is 17, (4,2) is 18, so (1,2) is free for food.\n\nNow, to reach (1,2) from (2,5).\n\nPossible paths: for example, go left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). But I need to see if that's safe.\n\nGo down to (2,4), then left or down, etc.\n\nBut I also need to avoid dead ends.\n\nMoreover, the snake body is around, so moving might block paths.\n\nCurrent head direction L, so if I move L to (1,5), that might be a step towards food.\n\nBut let's evaluate each move for turn 75.\n\nFirst, move L to (1,5): from (2,5) to (1,5).\n\nThen, after move, head at (1,5), and body follows: the tail (4,3) will move to the next, but when head moves to (1,5), the segment that was at (3,5) moves to (2,5), and so on, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), etc., down to (4,3) moves to where? The second last is (4,2)? Positions: after head, first body was (3,5), now it becomes the new position for what was the first body.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions: let S be the list: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (4,1), 13: (3,1), 14: (2,1), 15: (2,2), 16: (3,2), 17: (4,2), 18: (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,5), new positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nThen body: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, (2,5)\n\nSegment that was at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (3,5)\n\nGenerally, for i from 1 to 18, segment i moves to position of segment i-1.\n\nBut since head moved to new position, the body segments shift down.\n\nNew position 0: (1,5)  // new head\n\nNew position 1: (2,5)  // old head position\n\nNew position 2: (3,5)  // old position 1\n\nNew position 3: (4,5)  // old position 2\n\nNew position 4: (4,6)  // old position 3\n\nNew position 5: (5,6)  // old position 4\n\nNew position 6: (5,5)  // old position 5\n\nNew position 7: (5,4)  // old position 6\n\nNew position 8: (6,4)  // old position 7\n\nNew position 9: (6,3)  // old position 8\n\nNew position 10: (6,2)  // old position 9\n\nNew position 11: (6,1)  // old position 10\n\nNew position 12: (5,1)  // old position 11\n\nNew position 13: (4,1)  // old position 12\n\nNew position 14: (3,1)  // old position 13\n\nNew position 15: (2,1)  // old position 14\n\nNew position 16: (2,2)  // old position 15\n\nNew position 17: (3,2)  // old position 16\n\nNew position 18: (4,2)  // old position 17\n\nTail was (4,3) which is old position 18, but now it moves to old position 17, which is (4,2)? Old position 17 is (4,2), so new tail is at (4,2), but old position 18 was (4,3), which is now vacated.\n\nIn the list, new position 18 is (4,2), which was old position 17.\n\nThe point (4,3) is no longer occupied after move, since tail moved to (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, for other moves.\n\nBut for collision check, when I move to (1,5), it was not occupied before move, so safe.\n\nNow, similarly for other moves.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's the food at (1,2), which I might want to eat.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5), then from there, I can go U, D, L.\n\nL to (0,5) but x=0 is wall, so cannot go left from (1,5), since x=0 is wall.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), R to (2,5), but R might be reverse or not, depending on direction.\n\nAfter moving to (1,5), the head direction is L, since I moved left.\n\nNew head direction L.\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: U (1,6), D (1,4), L (0,5) but x=0 wall, so invalid, or R (2,5).\n\nBut moving R to (2,5) would be opposite to current direction L? Current direction after move is L, so moving R is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (1,5) with dir L, can go U, D, or L but L is wall, so only U or D.\n\nU to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I go D to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nBut I need to see if (1,2) is safe to eat.\n\nFirst, (1,2) is food, but when I eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length increases, so tail stays, head moves to food.\n\nAlso, there's a danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (4,3), far from (1,2).\n\nBut more importantly, for (1,2), it is under the body? No, it's food, not body.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nIn this case, is (1,2) under snake body? Current snake positions: (2,2) is body, (3,2), (4,2), but (1,2) is not occupied by snake, it's food, so it can be eaten directly when head moves there, no issue.\n\nThe special case is only if food is under a body segment.\n\nHere, (1,2) is free, so eating is fine.\n\nBut let's see the path to (1,2).\n\nFrom current (2,5), if I move L to (1,5), then I can move D to (1,4) on next turn, then D to (1,3), then D to (1,2) to eat on turn 78.\n\nTurn 75: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 76: from (1,5), dir L, move D to (1,4)  // now dir D\n\nThen turn 77: from (1,4), dir D, move D to (1,3)  // possible, D down\n\nThen turn 78: from (1,3), dir D, move D to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nAt turn 78, head moves to (1,2), which has food, so eats it, length increases, tail stays, so new tail is the old tail.\n\nBut I need to check if at that point it's safe.\n\nFirst, when moving to (1,2), is there collision? At that time, the body positions.\n\nBut let's think if this path is feasible.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2), all along x=1, y decreasing.\n\nNow, are these cells free? Currently, (1,5) is free, (1,4) should be free, (1,3) free, (1,2) food, so yes.\n\nBut after moves, the body moves, so I need to ensure that when I move to these cells, they are not occupied.\n\nFor example, at turn 75, move L to (1,5), as above, new positions include (1,5) head, (2,5), etc.\n\nThen at turn 76, move D to (1,4) from (1,5).\n\nCurrent positions before move: head at (1,5), body: (2,5), (3,5), ..., down to (4,2) tail? After turn 75 move, positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\n(1,4) is not in this list, so moving to (1,4) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, after moving to (1,4), new positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., and tail (3,2) or something.\n\nThen turn 77, move D to (1,3): (1,3) should be free.\n\nThen turn 78, move D to (1,2): (1,2) has food, so eat, head to (1,2), body: the segment that was at (1,3) moves to where? When head moves to (1,2), and eats, so tail doesn't move, new body added, so positions: head (1,2), then previous head position (1,3) becomes first body, and so on, up to tail which is still the old tail before move.\n\nBut in terms of collision, moving to (1,2) should be fine since it's not occupied by body at that time.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to continue.\n\nBut life span: food at (1,2) can be eaten until turn 80, so turn 78 is fine.\n\nTurn 75: eat? Not yet, move towards it.\n\nTurn 75: t=75, move L\n\nt=76: move D to (1,4)\n\nt=77: move D to (1,3)\n\nt=78: move D to (1,2) and eat.\n\nFood life span: at t=75, life span 6, so t=75:6, t=76:5, t=77:4, t=78:3, so yes, present.\n\nNow, but is this the only option? I have other moves.\n\nFor example, if I move D from (2,5) to (2,4) on turn 75.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,2) but not directly.\n\nFrom (2,4), I could go L to (1,4), then D to (1,3), D to (1,2), but that takes one more turn: turn 75 D to (2,4), turn 76 L to (1,4), turn 77 D to (1,3), turn 78 D to (1,2), same as above but started later.\n\nFrom (2,5), move D to (2,4), then on turn 76, from (2,4) I can go L to (1,4), but then to (1,3) on t=77, (1,2) on t=78.\n\nSame timing as if I go L first then down.\n\nIf I go L to (1,5) on t=75, then D to (1,4) on t=76, D to (1,3) on t=77, D to (1,2) on t=78.\n\nIf I go D to (2,4) on t=75, then on t=76 from (2,4) I can go L to (1,4) (if possible), then D to (1,3) t=77, D to (1,2) t=78. Same.\n\nBut from (2,4), after moving, head direction is D (since I moved down), so from (2,4) dir D, I can go L, U, D, not R (reverse).\n\nL to (1,4) is possible.\n\nBut (1,4) might be free.\n\nIn the first path, I go directly to (1,5) then down, which might be similar.\n\nBut moving U or D from (2,5) might not directly help for food.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating at (1,2), what do I do? But I need to survive long term.\n\nPerhaps there are other foods, but only one food given, so I should eat this one since it's positive.\n\nThe state only lists one food, so I think that's the only one.\n\nFood positions: only (1,2) given.\n\nSo I should aim to eat it.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nLook at the area around (1,2): it's near the left wall.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), head at (1,2), and the body is long.\n\nFor example, after eating at (1,2) on t=78, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., up to tail.\n\nBut tail: before move, on t=78, before eating, head was at (1,3), body to tail.\n\nAfter eating, head (1,2), body: (1,3), then previous body, and tail stays, so the snake is longer.\n\nBut at (1,2), head, I need to move from there.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,2), after moving down to it, direction D, so down.\n\nThen I can go L, R, D, not U (reverse).\n\nL: (0,2) wall, invalid.\n\nR: (2,2), but (2,2) is part of the body? At that time, when I move from (1,2), the body includes (1,3), (1,4), etc., and (2,2) might be occupied.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, on turn 78: before move, positions: after t=77, let's assume we are at (1,3) head, from previous.\n\nEasier to think from t=78.\n\nSuppose on t=78, head at (1,3), direction D, and I move D to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBefore move, positions: head at (1,3), body: let's say from t=77.\n\nPerhaps I should not go into too much detail yet.\n\nSince (1,2) is at the edge, after eating, I might be trapped if I go there.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), with dir D, I can only go R or D, since L is wall, U is reverse.\n\nD to (1,1), but y=1, not wall yet, but y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is ok, but then to (1,0) wall.\n\nR to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) might be occupied by body.\n\nWhen I move to (1,2) and eat, the new positions: head (1,2), then first body at (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and tail at (4,2) or where.\n\nBefore eating at t=78, head at (1,3), let's say after t=77 move.\n\nSet t=77: head at (1,3), dir D.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., down to tail.\n\nWhat is tail? From the path, after t=76: head at (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nAfter t=75 move to (1,5): positions as before.\n\nThen t=76 move D to (1,4): new head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nTail at (4,2)\n\nThen t=77 move D to (1,3): new head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail is (3,2)? Positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to (3,2), and (4,2) is gone? When head moves to (1,3), the last body segment moves to the previous second last position.\n\nOld positions before t=77 move: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), ..., (4,2) at index 18.\n\nAfter move head to (1,3), new positions:\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nBody 1: (1,4)  // old head\n\nBody 2: (1,5)  // old body 1\n\nBody 3: (2,5)  // old body 2\n\n...\nBody 18: (3,2)  // old body 17, since old body 17 was (4,2)? Old positions: index 0: (1,4) head, 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,1), 13: (5,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (3,1), 16: (2,1), 17: (2,2), 18: (3,2)? Old index 18 was (4,2), but in the list, after t=76, positions: head (1,4), then 1:(1,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(4,5), 5:(4,6), 6:(5,6), 7:(5,5), 8:(5,4), 9:(6,4), 10:(6,3), 11:(6,2), 12:(6,1), 13:(5,1), 14:(4,1), 15:(3,1), 16:(2,1), 17:(2,2), 18:(3,2)? No, after t=76 move, positions are: from earlier, after t=76: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), and tail (4,2)? Let's list indices.\n\nAfter t=76 move to (1,4):\n\n- Head: (1,4)\n\n- Body1: (1,5)  // old head\n\n- Body2: (2,5)  // old body1\n\n- Body3: (3,5)  // old body2\n\n- Body4: (4,5)  // old body3\n\n- Body5: (4,6)  // old body4\n\n- Body6: (5,6)  // old body5\n\n- Body7: (5,5)  // old body6\n\n- Body8: (5,4)  // old body7\n\n- Body9: (6,4)  // old body8\n\n- Body10: (6,3)  // old body9\n\n- Body11: (6,2)  // old body10\n\n- Body12: (6,1)  // old body11\n\n- Body13: (5,1)  // old body12\n\n- Body14: (4,1)  // old body13\n\n- Body15: (3,1)  // old body14\n\n- Body16: (2,1)  // old body15\n\n- Body17: (2,2)  // old body16\n\n- Body18: (3,2)  // old body17? Old body17 was (2,2) in previous state? Messy.\n\nFrom t=75 move to (1,5): positions:\n\n- 0: (1,5) head\n\n- 1: (2,5)\n\n- 2: (3,5)\n\n- 3: (4,5)\n\n- 4: (4,6)\n\n- 5: (5,6)\n\n- 6: (5,5)\n\n- 7: (5,4)\n\n- 8: (6,4)\n\n- 9: (6,3)\n\n- 10: (6,2)\n\n- 11: (6,1)\n\n- 12: (5,1)\n\n- 13: (4,1)\n\n- 14: (3,1)\n\n- 15: (2,1)\n\n- 16: (2,2)\n\n- 17: (3,2)\n\n- 18: (4,2) tail\n\nThen t=76 move D to (1,4): new head (1,4), then body:\n\n- 1: (1,5)  // old head\n\n- 2: (2,5)  // old body1\n\n- 3: (3,5)  // old body2\n\n- 4: (4,5)  // old body3\n\n- 5: (4,6)  // old body4\n\n- 6: (5,6)  // old body5\n\n- 7: (5,5)  // old body6\n\n- 8: (5,4)  // old body7\n\n- 9: (6,4)  // old body8\n\n- 10: (6,3)  // old body9\n\n- 11: (6,2)  // old body10\n\n- 12: (6,1)  // old body11\n\n- 13: (5,1)  // old body12\n\n- 14: (4,1)  // old body13\n\n- 15: (3,1)  // old body14\n\n- 16: (2,1)  // old body15\n\n- 17: (2,2)  // old body16\n\n- 18: (3,2)  // old body17\n\nTail is (3,2), and (4,2) is gone.\n\nThen t=77 move D to (1,3): new head (1,3), body:\n\n- 1: (1,4)  // old head\n\n- 2: (1,5)  // old body1\n\n- 3: (2,5)  // old body2\n\n- 4: (3,5)  // old body3\n\n- 5: (4,5)  // old body4\n\n- 6: (4,6)  // old body5\n\n- 7: (5,6)  // old body6\n\n- 8: (5,5)  // old body7\n\n- 9: (5,4)  // old body8\n\n- 10: (6,4)  // old body9\n\n- 11: (6,3)  // old body10\n\n- 12: (6,2)  // old body11\n\n- 13: (6,1)  // old body12\n\n- 14: (5,1)  // old body13\n\n- 15: (4,1)  // old body14\n\n- 16: (3,1)  // old body15\n\n- 17: (2,1)  // old body16\n\n- 18: (2,2)  // old body17\n\nTail is (2,2)\n\nThen t=78 move D to (1,2) and eat food: since food at (1,2), head moves to (1,2), and because food, tail does not move, new segment added.\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), then body1: (1,3)  // old head position\n\nBody2: (1,4)  // old body1\n\nBody3: (1,5)  // old body2\n\nBody4: (2,5)  // old body3\n\n...\nBody19: (2,2)  // old body18? Old positions before move: head (1,3), body1 (1,4), body2 (1,5), body3 (2,5), ..., body18 (2,2)\n\nAfter eating, new head (1,2), then new body1: (1,3), new body2: (1,4), new body3: (1,5), new body4: (2,5), ..., up to new body19: (2,2), and new body20: the old tail position, but since tail didn't move, we add a new segment at the tail position, which was (2,2), but (2,2) is already occupied by body19? Confusion.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to food, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail.\n\nPositions: the new head is at food cell, then the previous head position becomes the first body, and so on, but the last body segment (tail) stays in place, so it becomes a new body segment, and the tail is still there, so length increases.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk where k=18 for length 19.\n\nAfter moving to food and eating, new positions: new head at food, then H (previous head), B1, B2, ..., Bk, and Bk (tail) does not move, so we have new head, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, with Bk repeated? No.\n\nThe body segments: the segment that was at H moves to the new head position? No.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell without eating, the head moves, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail moves away.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, but the tail does not move, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was.\n\nPositions after eating: head at food, then the previous head position, then the previous body positions, and the tail remains the same as before.\n\nSo the list has one more element.\n\nBefore move: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P_m (tail), length m+1.\n\nAfter moving to food and eating: new head at food cell, then P0, P1, P2, ..., P_m. So the tail P_m is still there, and P0 is now body, etc.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nIn this case, before t=78 move, positions: head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  // 19 positions, index 0 to 18.\n\nAfter moving to (1,2) and eating: new head (1,2), then body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  // 20 positions, tail at (2,2).\n\nNow, from head at (1,2), direction D (since I moved down to it).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but L to (0,2) wall, U to (1,3) but (1,3) is now the first body segment, so moving U to (1,3) would collide with body.\n\nD to (1,1), R to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is the tail, so moving to tail is allowed, since tail will move, but after eating, tail didn't move, so when I move, the tail will move only if I don't eat, but here I just ate, so on the next move, if I move, tail will move.\n\nFrom (1,2), dir D, I can move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nU is reverse, not allowed, L wall.\n\nNow, (1,1): is it free? Currently, in positions, (1,1) not occupied, so should be free.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by tail, but I can move to it because tail will move when I move.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), head to (2,2), which was tail, and tail will move to the previous position, which was (2,1)? Before move, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), ..., tail (2,2)\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), head to (2,2), and since I don't eat (no food), tail moves: the segment at (2,2) was tail, but when head moves to (2,2), it's the new head, and the body segments shift, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically, new head at (2,2), then body1 at (1,2), body2 at (1,3), ..., and the last body moves to the position of the previous last but one, so tail moves away.\n\nSo moving to (2,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,1) is safe.\n\nBut (1,1) is near wall, y=0 below.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (1,1) is above it.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can only go U or R, not D to (1,0) wall.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nThe point is, after eating at (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (1,1), but the board might be crowded, and I need to survive.\n\nBut for now, eating the food is good, and I can manage.\n\nBut perhaps there is a risk that the snake is looping and I might collide later.\n\nAnother thing: the food is at (1,2), and the snake body is at (2,2), (3,2), etc., so after eating, I might be able to go up or something.\n\nBut let's consider other moves from current position.\n\nIf I move U from (2,5) to (2,6) on turn 75.\n\n(2,6) is free? Currently, snake has (4,6), but not (2,6), so free.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go U, D, L, R, but head direction U.\n\nCurrent dir L, I move U, so new dir U.\n\nFrom (2,6), dir U, can go U to (2,7), but y=7 wall, invalid; L to (1,6); R to (3,6); D to (2,5) but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\n(1,6) or (3,6).\n\nBut this might not lead to food directly.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (2,4) on t=75, from (2,4) I can go L to (1,4) or D to (2,3) or U to (2,5) reverse not allowed, R to (3,4).\n\nBut to reach food at (1,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut if I go U or D first, it might take longer, and food life span is short, only until turn 80.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6) on t=75, then I might not reach food in time.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (1,2) is far, at least 4 moves away: e.g. L to (1,6), then D to (1,5), D to (1,4), D to (1,3), D to (1,2) but that's 5 moves, to eat on t=80.\n\nt=75 move U to (2,6)\n\nt=76 from (2,6) dir U, move L to (1,6)  // now dir L\n\nt=77 from (1,6) dir L, move D to (1,5)\n\nt=78 from (1,5) dir D? After moving D, dir D, move D to (1,4)\n\nt=79 from (1,4) dir D, move D to (1,3)\n\nt=80 from (1,3) dir D, move D to (1,2) eat, if food still there.\n\nFood life span: at t=75, life span 6, so t=75:6, t=76:5, t=77:4, t=78:3, t=79:2, t=80:1, so on t=80, countdown 1, can be eaten, disappears at t=81.\n\nSo I can eat on t=80.\n\nBut in the first path, I can eat on t=78, which is earlier, so better to eat sooner to avoid risk of not reaching.\n\nAlso, by eating sooner, I grow earlier, which might help with space, but the snake gets longer, which could be riskier.\n\nBut since food is positive, +1 score and length, so good to eat.\n\nIf I move D to (2,4) on t=75, then to food in 3 moves: t=75 D to (2,4), t=76 L to (1,4), t=77 D to (1,3), t=78 D to (1,2) eat, same as first path.\n\nt=75 move D to (2,4), then t=76 from (2,4) dir D, move L to (1,4)  // now dir L\n\nt=77 from (1,4) dir L, move D to (1,3)  // after moving D, dir D\n\nt=78 from (1,3) dir D, move D to (1,2) eat.\n\nSame as if I went L first then down.\n\nNow, what about moving U? If I move U to (2,6) on t=75, I can still reach food but on t=80, which is later, and if something happens, I might miss it, so riskier.\n\nTherefore, moving U is not good for getting the food.\n\nSimilarly, moving D directly might be similar to moving L, but let's see the board.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not near here.\n\nAlso, the snake has a loop or something? Look at positions: from head (2,5), to (3,5), (4,5), then (4,6) up, (5,6), (5,5) down, (5,4), (6,4) right, (6,3) down, (6,2), (6,1) down, (5,1) left, (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) left, (2,2) up, (3,2) right, (4,2), (4,3) up.\n\nSo the snake is coiled, and after moving, it might open up.\n\nBut for now, to maximize score, I should eat the food, and moving L or D from current position allows me to reach it in 3 turns.\n\nMoving L directly to (1,5) might be better because it gets me closer to the left side.\n\nBut let's check if moving L is safe in terms of future moves.\n\nFrom (1,5), as I said, I can only go U or D, since L is wall, R is reverse not allowed.\n\nThen if I go D to (1,4), etc.\n\nAfter eating, as before.\n\nBut there might be a danger: at (1,2), after eating, if I go to (2,2), which was the tail, but it's ok.\n\nBut (2,2) might be part of the body now.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), positions include (2,2) as tail or body.\n\nIn the new positions, (2,2) is the last body segment, tail.\n\nThen if I move R to (2,2), head to (2,2), and tail moves away, so fine.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go U, D, L, R depending on direction.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nPerhaps the area near (1,2) is cramped, but I should be able to maneuever.\n\nAnother option: maybe I don't go for the food immediately, but that might be risky because it could disappear, and no other food.\n\nSince only one food, and positive, I should eat it.\n\nBut let's see if there is negative food, but not mentioned, so only positive.\n\nThe food has value 1, positive.\n\nSo I think eating it is good.\n\nNow, between moving L or D from current.\n\nMoving L to (1,5) gets me directly to the column, which might be efficient.\n\nMoving D to (2,4) might allow me to go to other areas, but since food is at (1,2), I still need to go left.\n\nMoreover, from (2,4), I can go to (1,4) or (2,3), etc., but to reach (1,2), I need to go to (1,4) or (1,3).\n\nBut (2,4) is closer to the center, might have more space.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), after move, dir D, I can go L to (1,4), or D to (2,3), or R to (3,4), etc.\n\nIf I go to (2,3), then to (2,2) or (1,3), but (2,2) has body? Not immediately.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think both L and D are ok, but moving L might be slightly better for direct path.\n\nWhat about the tail reward danger? But food is at (1,2), tail is far, at (4,3) or moving, not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the food life span is 6, I have time, but eating sooner reduces risk.\n\nTurn 75, I move; earliest eat on t=78.\n\nIf I move U or other, I might eat on t=80.\n\nBut t=80 is the last chance, if I delay, and something blocks, I miss it.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,6), and then down, but on the way, if the body blocks, but in this case, since I'm going left and down, it might be ok.\n\nBut to be safe, better to go directly towards food.\n\nTherefore, for turn 75, I should move L to (1,5).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, move down to the food.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for multiple turns: from turn 75 to turn 75+ something, at least 5 turns ahead? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan actions for turn 75,76,77,78,79, etc.\n\nTurn 75 to 79 or 80.\n\nBut I don't know the state after, so I need to specify actions based on current state, but after each move, state changes, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nThe answer format: for each turn, specify action, but since state changes, I need to assume the path.\n\nPerhaps I can plan the path to the food.\n\nSince only one food, and I can reach it in 3 moves, then after that, I need to survive.\n\nBut after eating, I need to move away.\n\nSo for turn 75: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 76: move D to (1,4)  // from (1,5) dir L, move D\n\nTurn 77: move D to (1,3)  // from (1,4) dir D, move D\n\nTurn 78: move D to (1,2) and eat\n\nNow for turn 79: after eating, head at (1,2), dir D, as above.\n\nThen I need to move. Possible: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2)\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), which was tail, but now it's body, but moving to it is safe since tail moves.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go to other directions.\n\nMove D to (1,1), then from there, only U or R, since L wall, D wall.\n\n(1,1) to (1,0) invalid, so from (1,1) I can go U to (1,2) but that might be body, or R to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) might be body.\n\nBut let's see positions after t=78 eat.\n\nHead at (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nSo (2,1) is occupied, (2,2) is occupied.\n\nFrom (1,2) dir D, move R to (2,2): (2,2) is occupied by the tail, but I can move to it.\n\nAfter moving, head to (2,2), and tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body1 (1,2), body2 (1,3), body3 (1,4), ..., body19 (2,1)? Let's not list.\n\n(2,1) was the second last or something.\n\nPoint is, moving to (2,2) is safe.\n\nThen from (2,2), direction R (since I moved right), then I can go U, D, L, R.\n\nFor example, go U to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other food, I just need to survive, so I should avoid walls and body.\n\nBut for the plan, I can go to (2,2) on turn 79.\n\nThen from there, depending.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 75 to 79.\n\nTurn 75: L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 76: D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 77: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 78: D to (1,2) eat\n\nTurn 79: from (1,2) dir D, move R to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 80: from (2,2) dir R, I can go U to (2,3) or D to (2,1) or L to (1,2) but (1,2) might be body now, or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,3) might be free, etc.\n\nBut I think for the plan, it's ok.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving L on turn 75 is best.\n\nAnother consideration: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant.\n\nAlso, the snake length is 19, grid 8x8 with walls, so 64 cells, minus walls, but borders are walls, so inner grid 6x6=36 cells? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so valid cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (5,2), so total cells: 36 -1 =35 cells.\n\nSnake length 19, so many cells occupied, but after moving, it changes.\n\nIn this case, going to the edge might be risky, but I think it's manageable.\n\nIf I move D to (2,4) on turn 75, then I can go to (1,4) on t=76, etc., similar.\n\nBut moving L directly seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going to (1,5) because from there I have only two choices, U or D, which might limit options.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,5), then I must go U or D, say D to (1,4), then from (1,4) I can go U, D, L, R but dir after move to (1,4) is D, so from (1,4) dir D, I can go L to (0,4) wall invalid, R to (2,4), U to (1,5) reverse not allowed, D to (1,3).\n\nSo only R or D.\n\nIf I go R to (2,4), then I am back, or D to (1,3).\n\nBut I need to go to (1,2), so I go D.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for turn 75, action L.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can plan for 5 turns: 75 to 79.\n\nTurn 75: move L\n\nTurn 76: move D\n\nTurn 77: move D\n\nTurn 78: move D to eat\n\nTurn 79: after eat, move R\n\nBut on turn 79, from (1,2) dir D, move R to (2,2)\n\nThen for turn 80, I need to specify, but not required, but think ahead.\n\nSince I ate on t=78, and no more food, I just need to survive.\n\nBut the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, so for the plan, it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,2) might be under body? But no, it's not, it's separate.\n\nIn the initial state, is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions include (2,2), (3,2), but not (1,2), so free.\n\nSo I think going for it is good.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (1,2) while ensuring long-term survival, I must plan a sequence of moves that safely navigates the snake to the food within its life span (disappearing after turn 80) and avoids collisions. The snake is currently at (2,5) with direction left (L), and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,2). The food at (1,2) has a value of +1 and a life span of 6, meaning it can be eaten from turn 75 to turn 80 (countdown decreases each turn, including the current one).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 75)**: From (2,5) with direction L, possible moves are U (up), D (down), or L (left). R (right) is invalid due to the no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **Path to Food**: The food at (1,2) can be reached in 3 moves by going left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), (1,3), and finally (1,2) to eat on turn 78. This is efficient and minimizes risk, as eating sooner reduces the chance of missing the food due to its short life span.\n- **Safety Checks**: \n  - Moving left to (1,5) on turn 75 is safe: (1,5) is not occupied by the body or walls.\n  - Subsequent down moves are safe: (1,4), (1,3), and (1,2) are unoccupied and within bounds.\n  - After eating, moving right to (2,2) on turn 79 is safe, as (2,2) is the tail cell and the tail will move away.\n- **Long-Term Survival (5+ Turns Ahead)**:\n  - Eating on turn 78 grows the snake to length 20, increasing the risk of collisions. After eating, the snake must avoid the cramped left wall area by moving right to more open space.\n  - The planned moves for turns 75–79 ensure the snake survives past the food consumption and has options to maneuver. Beyond turn 79, the snake should head towards the center (e.g., (2,3) or (3,2)) to reduce entanglement risks, but the sequence focuses on the critical food acquisition phase.\n- **Risk of Delay**: Moving up or down on turn 75 would delay reaching the food, potentially missing it if the path is blocked later. For example:\n  - Moving up to (2,6) forces a longer path (e.g., (2,6) → (1,6) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2)), risking that the food disappears by turn 81 or that body movements block access.\n  - Moving down to (2,4) allows a similar path to the food but is less direct than moving left first.\n- **No Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (4,3) initially, far from (1,2), so eating the food poses no collision risk from the tail growing into the head.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 75–79):\nThe sequence below eats the food on turn 78 and positions the snake for survival. Actions are chosen to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions, with directions updated after each move.\n\n- **Turn 75**: Move L to (1,5).  \n  - *Reasoning*: Moves directly toward the food column. From (2,5), L to (1,5) is safe and efficient. New head direction: L.\n- **Turn 76**: Move D to (1,4).  \n  - *Reasoning*: From (1,5) with direction L, D is valid (U and D are options; L leads to wall, R is reverse). Moves toward food. New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 77**: Move D to (1,3).  \n  - *Reasoning*: From (1,4) with direction D, D is valid (L to wall, R to (2,4), U reverse). Positions for eating. New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 78**: Move D to (1,2) and eat food.  \n  - *Reasoning*: From (1,3) with direction D, D to (1,2) eats the food (+1 score, length increases to 20). Safe as (1,2) is not body-occupied. New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 79**: Move R to (2,2).  \n  - *Reasoning*: From (1,2) with direction D, R is valid (L to wall, U reverse, D to (1,1) possible but leads to dead end). Moving R to (2,2) is safe (tail cell, tail moves away) and escapes the left wall. New head direction: R.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats food on turn 78 (within life span) with minimal turns.\n- **Survival Focus**: Avoids dead ends (e.g., staying near y=0 or x=0) by moving right after eating. By turn 79, the snake is at (2,2) with direction R, enabling future moves to open areas (e.g., U to (2,3) or R to (3,2)).\n- **Risk Mitigation**: All moves are collision-free and respect movement constraints. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms that delaying the food pursuit (e.g., moving up/down first) increases risk, while this path balances immediate reward with long-term safety.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 76: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 77: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 78: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 79: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 76, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,5), and the body segments follow. The snake is quite long, with 19 segments. Head direction is left, so it's moving left.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,4) with life span 10 and value 1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1 and gives +1 score. But I need to avoid negative food, though there isn't any here.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival and maximizing score. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize. I'll sketch a grid.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders and (5,2) is an obstacle.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nThe tail is at (4,2), I think. Let's list all positions in order:\n\nIndex 0: (1,5) head\n\n1: (2,5)\n\n2: (3,5)\n\n3: (4,5)\n\n4: (4,6)\n\n5: (5,6)\n\n6: (5,5)\n\n7: (5,4)\n\n8: (6,4)\n\n9: (6,3)\n\n10: (6,2)\n\n11: (6,1)\n\n12: (5,1)\n\n13: (4,1)\n\n14: (3,1)\n\n15: (2,1)\n\n16: (2,2)\n\n17: (3,2)\n\n18: (4,2) tail\n\nYes, 19 segments.\n\nHead direction is left, so from (1,5), moving left would go to (0,5), but x=0 is a wall, so moving left is not possible? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (0,5) is a wall, so snake cannot move left to (0,5) because it's a wall collision.\n\nBut head direction is given as L, left, and current position is (1,5), so moving left to (0,5) is impossible because wall. But the snake must have moved to (1,5) from the right, since direction is left.\n\nPrevious position must have been (2,5), and it moved left to (1,5). Now, for the next move, I need to choose a direction.\n\nAvailable moves: Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, or L, but L is to (0,5) which is wall, so not possible. Also, cannot move opposite to current direction, which is L, so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right to (2,5) because that's the body? (2,5) is the first body segment.\n\nLet's see possible moves from (1,5):\n\n- Up (U): (1,6) — y+1, so (1,5) to (1,6)\n\n- Down (D): (1,4) — y-1, to (1,4)\n\n- Left (L): (0,5) — but x=0 is wall, invalid\n\n- Right (R): (2,5) — but (2,5) is occupied by body segment, but it's not the tail? Tail is at (4,2), so (2,5) is a body segment, so moving to (2,5) would cause collision.\n\nGeneral rule: moving to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail is deadly, because after move, the tail moves, so only the tail cell is safe if it moves away.\n\nBut in this case, (2,5) is not the tail; it's the segment right behind the head. So if head moves to (2,5), it collides with body.\n\nAlso, walls: (0,5) is wall.\n\nSo possible cells:\n\n- Up: (1,6) — what is here? Not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,5) head, (2,5), (3,5), etc. (1,6) is not in the list, so empty?\n\nList all occupied cells: from positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo (1,6) is not occupied. Also, walls: borders and (5,2). (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n(1,6): x=1, y=6. y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, x=1 not border, and not (5,2), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): x=1,y=4, not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions? (1,4) is not listed, so free.\n\n(1,4) is a food position! Food at (1,4) with life span 10.\n\nAnd (1,2) is also food.\n\nBut for move from (1,5), possible:\n\n- U to (1,6)\n\n- D to (1,4)\n\n- L to (0,5) invalid wall\n\n- R to (2,5) invalid, body collision\n\nSo only U or D are possible moves.\n\nNow, head direction is L, so for next move, I can choose U or D, since L is invalid and R is opposite, but R is invalid anyway.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. But R is invalid, so no issue. I can move U or D.\n\nNow, food: (1,4) at (1,4) with life span 10, value 1. If I move down to (1,4), I eat it, since head moves there.\n\nBut (1,4) is currently unoccupied by snake, so yes.\n\nAlso, (1,2) at (1,2) with life span 5, value 1.\n\nBut life span: decreases every turn, including current. Current turn is 76, so for (1,2), life span 5, so it will disappear at turn 76 + 5 = 81? Life span decreases each turn, so after 5 turns, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) life span 10, disappears after 10 turns.\n\nNow, I need to think about risks.\n\nFirst, if I move down to (1,4), I eat the food immediately, snake grows by one segment.\n\nBut then, the new tail will be added after the move.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head at (1,5), tail at (4,2)\n\nIf I move down to (1,4), head now at (1,4), and since I eat food, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving, if food eaten, the tail doesn't move; the body extends, so the new head position is where food was, and the tail stays, so length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, snake at S = [ (1,5), (2,5), ..., (4,2) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (1,4), since (1,4) has food, the body moves: the head moves to (1,4), and the body segments shift, but since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (1,4), then the old head becomes part of body, so (1,5) becomes segment 1, (2,5) segment 2, ..., up to tail (4,2), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail? No.\n\nTypically, when snake eats, it grows: after moving, the tail remains, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: new head at (1,4), then the previous positions except the tail is not removed, so the segment that was tail stays, and all shift.\n\nLet's think: before move: positions P = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new head at new position, then [B1, B2, ..., T] but T is removed, so new body from B1 to T-1? Better to think indices.\n\nPositions list: index 0: head, 1 to 18: body, with 18 being tail.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell without eating: new head at new position, and the body becomes [ old head, old body 1, ..., old body 17 ], so tail is old body 17, which was index 17.\n\nOld tail index 18 is removed.\n\nAfter moving with eating: new head at new position, and body becomes [ old head, old body 1, ..., old body 18 ], so the old tail is kept, and a new segment is added, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, positions: after move to (1,4) with eat, new positions: head at (1,4), then old head (1,5), then (2,5), ..., up to old tail (4,2), so 20 segments now.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this case, if I move down to (1,4), I eat the food, grow to 20 segments.\n\nNow, but I need to think about future moves and dangers.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (4,2), head at (1,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,5) and (4,2) are not adjacent; distance is large.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, if I move up to (1,6), what is there? (1,6) is empty, no food, so no growth.\n\nThen snake moves to (1,6), body shifts, tail (4,2) removed, so length 19 still.\n\nNow, food at (1,4) and (1,2). (1,4) is below (1,5), so if I move up, I'm moving away from it.\n\nLife span: (1,2) has life span 5, so after 5 turns, it disappears. Current turn 76, so it will be gone by turn 81.\n\n(1,4) has life span 10, gone by turn 86.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, and the grid has limited space, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (1,4), body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nNow, head at (1,4), direction from (1,5) to (1,4) is down, so head direction is D.\n\nPossible moves from (1,4):\n\n- U to (1,5): but (1,5) is now the first body segment, so collision, invalid.\n\n- D to (1,3): empty? What is (1,3)? Not in positions, not wall, so possible.\n\n- L to (0,4): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,4): empty? (2,4) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n\nNow, food at (1,2) is below, at (1,2).\n\nIf I move down to (1,3), then to (1,2) later.\n\nBut (1,2) has life span 5, so it might disappear soon.\n\nCurrent turn 76, after this move, turn 77.\n\n(1,2) life span 5, so it decreases to 4 on turn 76, then 3 on 77, 2 on 78, 1 on 79, 0 on 80, so disappears at turn 80? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 76, life span is 5, so it decreases each turn: after turn 76, it becomes 4, after 77, 3, and so on, until after turn 80, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it is present on turns 76,77,78,79, and gone at turn 80.\n\nSimilarly for (1,4), life span 10, present until turn 85, gone at 86.\n\nIf I eat (1,4) on turn 76, it's gone.\n\nThen on turn 77, from (1,4), I can move to (1,3) or (2,4).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is down from (1,3).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then on turn 77, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves from (1,3):\n\n- U to (1,4): but (1,4) is now body? After moving to (1,4) on turn 76, positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nOn turn 77, if I move from (1,4) to (1,3), then new head at (1,3), and body: since not eating, tail moves, so positions: head (1,3), then old head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to old body 17, which was (3,2)? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 76: positions with growth: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)  // 20 segments\n\nTail is (4,2)\n\nNow turn 77, move to (1,3), no food there, so new positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail (3,2), since (4,2) removed.\n\n(4,2) was tail, removed, so positions from (1,3) to (3,2), 19 segments? Head (1,3), then 19 body segments? No.\n\nList: new head: (1,3)\n\nThen previous positions except tail removed: so [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) ] that's 19 segments including head? No.\n\nPositions list: after move, head is at (1,3), then the first body is the old head (1,4), then old body 1 (1,5), old body 2 (2,5), ..., up to old body 18, which was (3,2)? Old positions after growth: indices 0: (1,4) head, 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,1), 13: (5,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (3,1), 16: (2,1), 17: (2,2), 18: (3,2), 19: (4,2) tail? Earlier I said 20 segments, but indices from 0 to 19.\n\nIn the list: after turn 76 eat: positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ] so 20 cells.\n\nWhen moving without eating, new head at new position, then the list from index 0 to 18 become the body, so new positions: [new head, old index 0, old index 1, ..., old index 18] but old index 19 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo for turn 77, move to (1,3) no food: new head at (1,3), then old head (1,4), then old body: (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to old index 18, which is (4,2)? Old indices: 0:(1,4), 1:(1,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(4,5), 5:(4,6), 6:(5,6), 7:(5,5), 8:(5,4), 9:(6,4), 10:(6,3), 11:(6,2), 12:(6,1), 13:(5,1), 14:(4,1), 15:(3,1), 16:(2,1), 17:(2,2), 18:(3,2), 19:(4,2)\n\nAfter move, new positions: head (1,3), then old 0 to 18: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  // old index 19 (4,2) removed, so 20 segments? New head plus 19 old from 0 to 18, that's 20, but old 0 to 18 are 19 segments, plus new head, 20, but since no eat, length should be same as before, 20? Before turn 76, length was 19, after eat on 76, length 20, then on 77 no eat, so length should be 20.\n\nOld positions 20 segments, after move no eat: new head and the first 19 of old positions, so 20 segments, yes.\n\nTail is now (3,2).\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,4): but (1,4) is the first body segment, so collision, invalid.\n\n- D to (1,2): (1,2) is food, so possible to eat.\n\n- L to (0,3): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,3): empty? (2,3) not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\nSo from (1,3), can move D to (1,2) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I move D to (1,2), I eat the food, grow to 21 segments.\n\nBut (1,2) has life span 5, on turn 77, it has life span 3 (since decreased from 5 at 76 to 4 at 77? At turn 76, life span 5, after turn 76, it becomes 4. At turn 77, before move, life span is 4? Let's define.\n\nThe life span decreases at the end of each turn, I think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, food has life span L, then after the turn, it decreases to L-1.\n\nSo on turn 76, (1,2) has life span 5, after turn 76, it becomes 4.\n\nOn turn 77, it has life span 4, after turn 77, becomes 3, and so on.\n\nSo on turn 77, (1,2) is still there with life span 4.\n\nIf I move to (1,2) on turn 77, I eat it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first decision on turn 76.\n\nBack to turn 76 choices: move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), I eat food, but then I might be in a tight spot.\n\nAfter eating at (1,4), head at (1,4), then I can move to (1,3) or (2,4).\n\nIf I move to (1,3), then from there to (1,2) or (2,3).\n\n(1,2) is food, so I can eat it soon.\n\nBut the area around (1,2) might be crowded.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nGrid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, (x,0) and (x,7) for all x, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: from (1,5) to (4,2), but after eating at (1,4), positions as above.\n\nAlso, free spaces: for example, (1,6) is free, (1,3) free, (2,4) free, etc.\n\nBut the snake body occupies many cells.\n\nLet me sketch the grid for turn 76.\n\ny=7: wall at bottom? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=7 is top or bottom? Usually y increases up, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nIn the position, (1,5) and U to (1,6), D to (1,4), so y=4 is down from y=5.\n\nSo y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's list occupied cells:\n\n(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nFood at (1,2) and (1,4)\n\n(1,4) is food, not occupied by snake yet.\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,0) to (0,7) wall, (7,0) to (7,7) wall, (x,0) and (x,7) wall for all x.\n\nSo free cells within 1 to 6 in x and y, except snake and obstacle.\n\nObstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2) food, (1,3), (1,4) food, (1,6), (1,7) wall? y=7 wall, so (1,7) wall.\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (2,7) wall, etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is free, (1,3) free, (2,3) free, (2,4) free, (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (3,7) wall, (4,3), (4,4), (4,7) wall, (5,3), (5,7) wall, (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) wall, (7,y) all wall.\n\nAlso (3,3) free, (3,4) free, (4,3) free, (4,4) free, (5,3) free, (6,5) free, (6,6) free, etc.\n\nBut let's focus on the head area.\n\nOn turn 76, if I move up to (1,6), what happens?\n\nMove U to (1,6), no food there, so new positions: head (1,6), then old head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), but (4,6) is occupied, but when moving, the body shifts.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ]\n\nMove to (1,6), no food, so new head (1,6), then the body: old head (1,5), then old body 1 (2,5), old body 2 (3,5), old body 3 (4,5), old body 4 (4,6), old body 5 (5,6), old body 6 (5,5), etc., up to old body 17 (3,2), and old tail (4,2) removed.\n\nOld indices: 0: (1,5) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (4,1), 14: (3,1), 15: (2,1), 16: (2,2), 17: (3,2), 18: (4,2) tail.\n\nAfter move no eat: new head (1,6), then old 0 to 17: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  // old 18 (4,2) removed, so 19 segments.\n\nTail is now (3,2).\n\nHead at (1,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves from (1,6):\n\n- U to (1,7): but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D to (1,5): but (1,5) is now the first body segment, collision, invalid.\n\n- L to (0,6): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,6): (2,6) is empty?

(4,4) not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\nSo move to (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nThen I can explore the grid more freely.\n\nBut the food at (1,2) will disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nLife span: on turn 76, (1,2) life 5, after turn 76, life 4; turn 77, life 4, after turn 77, life 3; turn 78, life 3, after 78, life 2; turn 79, life 2, after 79, life 1; turn 80, life 1, after 80, life 0, gone.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 76 to 79, but on turn 76 we didn't eat it, on 77 if we go that way, etc.\n\nBut since eating it might trap us, better to leave it and focus on survival.\n\nAnother food at (1,4) is already eaten if we move down on 76.\n\nOn turn 76, only (1,4) is available to eat immediately.\n\nBut if I move down, I eat it, but then I might have limited space.\n\nPerhaps on turn 76, I can move down, but on turn 77, instead of going to (1,3), I go to (2,4), then to (3,4), etc., to open space.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), I can move to (4,4), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nTail is at (2,2) or wherever, but as snake moves, tail moves, opening space.\n\nAlso, there might be other areas.\n\nBut the grid is small, and snake is long, 19 segments, grid 8x8, walls, obstacle, so 64 cells minus walls and obstacle.\n\nBorder walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7, so inner grid 6x6=36 cells, but with internal obstacle (5,2), so 35 free cells.\n\nSnake has 19 segments, so occupied 19, so 16 free cells.\n\nAs it moves, some free cells.\n\nBut with 19 segments, it's easy to trap oneself.\n\nNow, back to turn 76, if I move down to (1,4), I eat food, but then I need to move right to avoid the left column.\n\nSo on turn 77, move R to (2,4).\n\nThen from (2,4), move to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nMove to (3,4) to go right.\n\nThen from (3,4), to (4,4) or (3,3).\n\nMove to (4,4).\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nPositions: after moving to (4,4), no food, new head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1) or something, but (2,2) might be removed.\n\nPrevious positions: before move to (4,4), let's assume we were at (3,4) from previous.\n\nOn turn 77: at (2,4)\n\nTurn 78: move to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  // tail (2,2)\n\nHead (3,4), move to (4,4), no food, new head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // (2,2) removed, tail (2,1)\n\nHead at (4,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n- U to (4,5): (4,5) is body, collision.\n- D to (4,3): empty, possible.\n- L to (3,4): body, collision.\n- R to (5,4): (5,4) is body?

No, internal obstacle is (5,2), so (4,2) is free? But in snake positions, it was occupied earlier, but now?\n\nCurrent positions: after move to (4,3) on turn 79.\n\nLet's trace positions.\n\nAfter turn 76: ate at (1,4), positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ]\n\nTurn 77: move R to (2,4), no food, new head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  // (3,2) and (4,2) removed?

The key observations are:\n\n- Moving up (U) on turn 76 leads to a dead end by turn 78, as the snake becomes trapped with no valid moves.\n- Moving down (D) on turn 76 allows eating the positive food at (1,4), increasing the snake's length and score, and provides a path to avoid immediate traps.\n- The food at (1,2) has a short life span (disappears after turn 80) and is in a high-risk location near the wall and snake body. Attempting to eat it could trap the snake, so it should be avoided.\n- After eating the food at (1,4), the strategy is to move rightward to open space, avoiding the left column and potential collisions.\n- Survival is prioritized; the snake should not take unnecessary risks for the (1,2) food, as the grid is crowded with the long snake (19 segments) and limited free space.\n\n### Detailed Move Sequence (5 turns)\n- **Turn 76 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to (1,4) to eat the positive food. This gains +1 score and increases length. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 77**: Move right (R) to (2,4). This avoids the dangerous left column and moves toward open space. No food eaten. Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 78**: Move right (R) to (3,4). Continues rightward movement to explore safer areas. No food eaten. Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 79**: Move right (R) to (4,4). This is the only valid move from (3,4), as other directions are blocked by the snake body or walls. No food eaten. Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 80**: Move down (D) to (4,3). From (4,4), moving down is the only safe option (U, L, R are blocked). This positions the snake for further exploration. The food at (1,2) disappears after this turn (life span ends), so no loss.\n\n### Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead\n- **Turn 76 (D)**: Eating the (1,4) food is safe and provides immediate reward. Moving up (U) is fatal within 3 turns, so down is necessary for survival.\n- **Turns 77-78 (R, R)**: Moving right avoids the congested left side and leverages the snake's body to open up space as the tail moves. The food at (1,2) is ignored due to corner risk.\n- **Turn 79 (R)**: Only move available, but it maintains momentum away from hazards.\n- **Turn 80 (D)**: Ensures the snake doesn't get stuck and prepares for future moves (e.g., to (5,3) or (3,3) on later turns).\n- **Beyond Turn 80**: The snake should continue toward the center or right side (e.g., to (5,3), (4,2), or (3,3)) to avoid walls and body collisions. No food is available after turn 80, so survival and space management are critical. The internal obstacle at (5,2) must be avoided, but the path is manageable.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake survives at least 5 turns, gains +1 score, and positions it for longer-term play. It prioritizes safety over the risky (1,2) food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 76: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 77: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 78: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 79: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 80: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 77. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,4), and it's moving down (direction D). The full snake body is: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. That's 20 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood: only one piece mentioned: (1,2) with value 1 and life span 4. That means it will disappear after 4 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 77, life span is 4; turn 78, it becomes 3; turn 79, it becomes 2; turn 80, it becomes 1; and on turn 81, it disappears. Since we start at turn 77, it can be eaten up to turn 80.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (1,4) moving down. Since it's moving down, from (1,4) down would be to (1,3), but y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is the bottom row? Let's clarify the coordinates.\n\nThe grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. (1,1) is bottom-left? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here it says y=0/y=7 are borders, and snake positions have y values from 1 to 6, so probably y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? But in the snake positions, head at (1,4), and moving down. If moving down decreases y, then (1,4) down to (1,3), then (1,2), etc. And (1,5) is above it, since the body includes (1,5), so if head is at (1,4) and body next is (1,5), that means the snake was moving up to get to (1,4) from (1,5)? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), then (2,5), etc. So from head to tail: (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (2,5) -> ... so the head is at (1,4), and the segment behind it is (1,5), which has a higher y, so if y increases upwards, then moving down would decrease y.\n\nDirection is given as D, down, so from (1,4), moving down would go to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is within bounds? x=1, y=3, since y from 1 to 6, so (1,3) is playable.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (1,4) with direction D (down).\n\nSince direction is down, I cannot move up instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: left, right, or continue down? No instant reverse means I can't do the opposite direction, which would be up.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn. I can move down (same direction), left, or right.\n\nSo from (1,4), moving down to (1,3), left to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so invalid, or right to (2,4)? (2,4) is not occupied by snake or wall? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nAnd walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (5,2)\n\nSo for head at (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (1,3) — is this free? (1,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3). Also not wall, since y=3 between 1 and 6. x=1 is fine. So (1,3) is empty.\n\n- Left: to (0,4) — x=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: to (2,4) — (2,4) not in snake positions? Snake has (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), but not (2,4)? Positions: (2,5), (2,1), (2,2), no (2,4) listed. So (2,4) should be free. Also not wall.\n\n- Up: but direction down, opposite is up, so cannot move up because of no instant reverse. So up is invalid for this turn.\n\nSo possible actions: Down or Right. U and L not possible; L is invalid due to wall, U invalid due to reverse.\n\nNow, food is at (1,2) with value 1, life span 4.\n\n(1,2) is below (1,3), since moving down decreases y.\n\nIf I move down to (1,3), then next turn I could move down to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a risk with tail collision if eating near tail.\n\nFirst, let's see where the tail is.\n\nSnake positions: last one is (4,2), which is the tail.\n\nFood is at (1,2), which is same y as tail, but different x.\n\nNow, if I eat the food at (1,2), the snake will grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn, meaning if head moves to (1,2), which has food, it eats it, length increases, and tail stays, so the new tail would be the old tail, but since head moves to (1,2), and it was at (1,3) say, then the new segment is added, so tail remains at (4,2) for that turn? Let's clarify how eating works.\n\nWhen snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So the snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn terms of positions, if head moves to food cell, it consumes it, and the tail position remains, so the snake length increases.\n\nNow, for collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell, and the tail is about to move, but when eating, the tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail cell and eats food, it might collide if the tail doesn't move.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut when eating food, the tail does not move, because a new segment is added. So if head moves to the tail cell to eat food, since tail doesn't move, it would be a collision because the tail is still there.\n\nThe special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, the food is at (1,2), not on the tail. Tail is at (4,2). So (1,2) is not the tail position; it's a different cell.\n\nCurrently, head at (1,4), tail at (4,2). Food at (1,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then to (1,2), I eat the food. At that point, head moves to (1,2), which is food, so eat, grow, tail stays at (4,2). (1,2) was not occupied by snake before, so no collision.\n\nThen the new tail will be (4,2) still? No: after eating, the tail remains for that turn, so positions: head at (1,2), then the segment that was head is now behind, so (1,3) becomes part of body, and tail (4,2) stays, so the snake has a new segment, so positions include (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (4,2), and since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so (4,2) is still there.\n\nBut (4,2) is not adjacent to (1,2); they are far apart. So no collision issue.\n\nThe tail danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself, I think.\n\nFrom the rule: \"if the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\" — meaning food on the tail position.\n\nHere food is at (1,2), tail at (4,2), different cells. So no problem.\n\nBut I need to think about the path and future moves.\n\nAlso, life span: food at (1,2) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after turn 77+3 = 80? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 77, life span 4, so:\n\n- Turn 77: life span decreases to 3? Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\"\n\nSo at turn t when food appears, life_span = N, then at turn t, it decreases to N-1? Or at the start of turn?\n\nThe input says for food: (x,y, value, life_span) at current turn.\n\nAnd \"life_span\" is the remaining turns, I think.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (1,2,4,1)\" so (x,y, life_span, value)? In the input it's written as (1,2,4,1), but in the description it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the state it's written as (1,2,4,1), which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or? Let's see.\n\nIn the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 2, 4, 1)\"\n\nBut in the core rules, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", so order might be inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nBut in the state, it's written as \"(1, 2, 4, 1)\", which has four numbers, but (x,y) is two, so probably (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? It says \"Life Span and Value\" in the state, but in core it's \"Value and Life Span\".\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nCore rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nState input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 2, 4, 1)\"\n\nBut (1,2,4,1) — it has four elements, but (x,y) should be one tuple.\n\nProbably it's a typo in the state; it should be ( (1,2), 1, 4 ) or something.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 2, 4, 1)\"\n\nIt says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the core it's \"Value and Life Span\". And the tuple has four numbers.\n\nI think it's likely that (1,2) is the position, 4 is life span, 1 is value, or vice versa.\n\nBut in the core description, it says value and life span, so value first.\n\nPerhaps in the state it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value).\n\nConfirm with the text: \" (1, 2, 4, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably life span is 4, value is 1.\n\nSimilarly, in core, it's value and life span, but here it's specified as \"Life Span and Value\", so for this state, it's (x,y, life_span, value) = (1,2,4,1)\n\nValue 1, life span 4.\n\nSo at turn 77, life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, so after turn 80, it's gone. Countdown: turn 77: life span 4, decreases to 3 at turn 78, to 2 at turn 79, to 1 at turn 80, to 0 at turn 81, so it disappears at the start of turn 81 or after turn 80?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\"\n\nLet's assume that at the start of turn t, the life span is L, then during the turn, it can be eaten, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn 77, before action, life span is 4. After the turn, it decreases to 3, and so on, until it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nBut when it disappears? After the turn when life span reaches 0.\n\nFor example, at turn 77, life span 4, can be eaten, after turn 77, life span 3.\n\nTurn 78, life span 3, can be eaten, after turn 78, life span 2.\n\nTurn 79, life span 2, can be eaten, after turn 79, life span 1.\n\nTurn 80, life span 1, can be eaten, after turn 80, life span 0, so it disappears, not available on turn 81.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 77,78,79,80.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (1,3) or right to (2,4).\n\nIf I move down to (1,3), then from there, I can go to (1,2) to eat the food, or to (2,3), or left to (0,3) invalid, or up to (1,4) but (1,4) is now body? After moving to (1,3), the snake body will be head at (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), etc. so (1,4) is occupied, so moving up to (1,4) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,3), possible moves: down to (1,2), right to (2,3), or left invalid, up to (1,4) but occupied, so only down or right.\n\nIf I go down to (1,2) on turn 78, I eat the food.\n\nBut I need to think further ahead.\n\nIf I move right to (2,4) on turn 77.\n\nFrom (2,4), what can I do?\n\nFirst, let's see the grid and snake.\n\nI should sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells outside are walls, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake: head (1,4), body: (1,5) - up, then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) - up, (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nNow, food at (1,2).\n\nIf I move down to (1,3) on turn 77.\n\nThen turn 78, from (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat food.\n\nOr move right to (2,3).\n\nIf I eat on turn 78, then head at (1,2), food eaten, snake grows, so positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to tail (4,2) still there since it didn't move.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions are: from head to tail: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — and since it grew, (4,2) is still the tail, but the segment before it is (3,2), so (4,2) is tail.\n\nLength 21 now.\n\nThen from (1,2), what can I do? Direction would be down, since I moved down to (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: down to (1,1)? y=1 is bottom, not wall, (1,1) is not occupied? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1) or (1,2) now head, (1,3) body. (1,1) is free? Snake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), but not (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n\nAlso, left to (0,2) invalid, right to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by snake? Snake has (2,2) as one of the segments, yes, (2,2) is in the list, it's part of body.\n\nPositions: (2,1), (2,2), etc. so (2,2) is occupied.\n\nUp to (1,3) but that's body, collision.\n\nSo from (1,2), after moving down to it, direction down, so possible moves: down to (1,1), or right to (2,2) but occupied, invalid, or left invalid, or up to (1,3) but occupied and reverse? Direction is down, so up is opposite, cannot move up anyway.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is free, as above.\n\nThen go to (1,1).\n\nFrom (1,1), then I can move right to (2,1), but (2,1) is occupied by snake? Snake has (2,1) as a segment.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), the snake body: head at (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n\n(2,1) is still occupied by the previous body segment.\n\nLet's see the positions after turn 78: head at (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,1), (2,2), etc. up to (4,2).\n\nWhen head moves to (1,1) on turn 79, from (1,2) down to (1,1), then positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), ..., and tail at (4,2) still? When head moves, the tail moves forward unless eating.\n\nSince not eating, on turn 79, head moves to (1,1), so tail moves from (4,2) to the next? The snake moves, so the tail segment is removed, and new head position.\n\nStandard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from the end.\n\nWith eating, head moves to food, tail stays, new segment added.\n\nHere, on turn 78, we ate food, so tail stayed.\n\nOn turn 79, if we move from (1,2) to (1,1), not eating, so head moves to (1,1), and tail moves forward, meaning the last segment (4,2) is removed, and the new tail is the previous one, which is (3,2) or? Positions after turn 78: head (1,2), then segments: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — so the segment before tail (4,2) is (3,2), and (4,2) is tail.\n\nWhen moving without eating on turn 79, head moves to (1,1), so new head (1,1), then the body includes (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (3,2), and (4,2) is removed. So tail is now at (3,2).\n\nFrom (1,1), direction down (since moved down), so possible moves: down to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; left to (0,1) invalid; right to (2,1); up to (1,2) but occupied and reverse.\n\n(2,1) is occupied? After move, positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), ..., (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc. (2,1) is a body segment, so moving to (2,1) would be collision.\n\nOnly possible move is up to (1,2), but that's body and also reverse direction, so invalid.\n\nBut (1,2) is occupied, so no valid moves from (1,1)? That can't be right.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1) on turn 79, the cell (1,2) is the first body segment, so it's occupied.\n\nOther directions: down and left invalid, right to (2,1) is occupied, up to (1,2) occupied.\n\nSo indeed, from (1,1), no valid moves; all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied.\n\nThus, moving down to (1,3) and then to (1,2) leads to a dead end on turn 79, after eating the food.\n\nOn turn 78, after eating at (1,2), on turn 79, from (1,2), only move to (1,1), then on turn 80, from (1,1), no moves, die.\n\nSo if I go to eat the food directly, I die soon after.\n\nTherefore, eating the food now is risky; I need to avoid that path.\n\nBut there might be other ways.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it later, but life span is short.\n\nNow, the other option at turn 77: move right to (2,4).\n\nSo on turn 77, move right to (2,4).\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction now right (since moved right).\n\nSnake body: head (2,4), then previous head (1,4) becomes body, so positions: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — and tail at (4,2).\n\nNow, from (2,4), direction right, so possible moves: right to (3,4), up to (2,5), down to (2,3), or left to (1,4) but that's body and reverse? Direction is right, so left is opposite, cannot move left.\n\nAlso, (1,4) is body, so invalid.\n\nSo possible: right to (3,4), up to (2,5), down to (2,3).\n\nNow, (3,4) is free? Snake has (3,5), (3,1), (3,2), no (3,4)? Positions above: (3,5), (3,1), (3,2), not (3,4), so free.\n\n(2,5) is occupied, it's a body segment.\n\n(2,3) is free? Not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, walls: no internal walls there.\n\nSo from (2,4), can go to (3,4), (2,5) but occupied, invalid, or (2,3).\n\n(2,5) is occupied, so cannot go up.\n\nSo possible: right to (3,4) or down to (2,3).\n\nNow, food is at (1,2), which is left and down from here, but I need to plan how to get there safely.\n\nSince the food has limited life, I need to eat it within 4 turns, but after eating, I need space to move.\n\nCurrently, the area around (1,2) is tight.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but that's not near here.\n\nI should think about the snake's body and possible paths.\n\nThe snake has many segments, and the grid has limited space.\n\nPlayable cells: x1-6, y1-6, total 36 cells.\n\nSnake length 20, so 16 free cells, but some occupied by walls? Walls are borders, so the cells are 6x6=36, minus internal wall at (5,2)? (5,2) is a cell occupied by wall, so not playable.\n\nWalls: borders are lines, but cells: cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning those coordinates are invalid, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is also wall, so not playable. Thus, 35 playable cells.\n\nSnake occupies 20 cells, so 15 free cells.\n\nFood at (1,2), which is free, so 14 other free cells.\n\nBut after moving, etc.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I move right to (2,4) on turn 77.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nSuppose I go down to (2,3) on turn 78.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), or down to (2,2) but y decreases? From (2,3), down to (2,2), up to (2,4) but that might be body.\n\nAfter turn 77, head at (2,4), positions: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ... tail (4,2).\n\nOn turn 78, if I move down to (2,3), then head to (2,3), body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), etc. tail moves, so (4,2) removed, new tail is (3,2) or? Positions after move: head (2,3), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — and (4,2) gone, tail at (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,3), direction down, so possible moves: down to (2,2), left to (1,3), right to (3,3), up to (2,4) but occupied and reverse? Direction down, so up is opposite, invalid.\n\n(2,2) is occupied? Positions have (2,2) as body segment, yes, so (2,2) occupied.\n\n(1,3) free? Not in positions, so free.\n\n(3,3) free? Not listed, so free.\n\nSo from (2,3), can go to (1,3) or (3,3).\n\nNow, food at (1,2), which is below (1,3).\n\nIf I go to (1,3) on turn 79, then from (1,3), I can go down to (1,2) to eat food on turn 80.\n\nLife span: turn 77:4, turn78:3, turn79:2, turn80:1, so on turn80 it can be eaten.\n\nOn turn79, at (1,3), move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen, after eating, head at (1,2), snake grows, tail stays at (3,2) for that turn.\n\nThen from (1,2), as before, only can move down to (1,1) on turn81, then from (1,1), no moves, die on turn82.\n\nStill dead end.\n\nIf from (2,3) I go to (3,3) instead on turn79.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to various places.\n\nBut food at (1,2) might expire.\n\nLife span: on turn80, life span 1, decreases to 0 after turn80, so not available on turn81.\n\nTo eat, I need to be at (1,2) by turn80.\n\nOn turn79, if I am at (1,3), I can go to (1,2) on turn80.\n\nIf I am elsewhere, might not reach.\n\nBut in the path above, if I go to (3,3) on turn79, I can go to (3,2) or (3,4), etc., but (1,2) is two steps away, on turn80 I can't reach from (3,3) to (1,2) in one move, too far, so I miss the food.\n\nSo only way to eat food is to be at (1,3) on turn79 or turn80, but turn80 last chance.\n\nTurn80: if on turn80 I am at (1,3), I can move to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut after eating, I go to (1,1) and die.\n\nSo eating the food leads to death soon after, since I am trapped.\n\nTherefore, it might not be worth eating this food, as it sacrifices long-term survival.\n\nI should avoid eating it and find a way to survive longer.\n\nBut there is only one food, and no other food mentioned, so if I don't eat this, I might not get another food soon, but the game might spawn more food, but in this state, only this food is given, so I need to work with what I have.\n\nThe state only shows current food; new food may spawn later, but I don't know, so I should assume only this food for now.\n\nTo maximize score, I need to eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nHere, eating this food leads to death, so better not to eat it, and find a path to stay alive longer.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it but have an escape route.\n\nFrom (1,2), after eating, if I could go right instead of down, but from (1,2), right is (2,2), which is occupied, as we saw.\n\nUnless the tail moves and frees up space.\n\nLet's think about the tail movement.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2) on turn78, say, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nOn turn79, if I move down to (1,1), then tail moves, so (4,2) removed, new tail (3,2).\n\nBut (1,1) is free, so I move there.\n\nThen from (1,1), as before, only up to (1,2) which is body, or right to (2,1) which is body, etc., no free cells.\n\nIf from (1,2) I could move right, but (2,2) is occupied.\n\nBut (2,2) is occupied until the tail moves.\n\nWhen tail moves on turn79, if I move from (1,2), the tail (4,2) is removed, but (2,2) is still occupied because it's not the tail; the tail is (4,2), so when tail moves, (4,2) is freed, but (2,2) is still body.\n\nPositions: after eating on turn78, head (1,2), segments: (1,3), (1,4), ..., (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nOn turn79, if I move head to (1,1), then new head (1,1), new body: (1,2), (1,3), ..., and tail moves, so (4,2) removed, new tail is (3,2), and (2,2) is still there.\n\nSo (2,2) occupied.\n\nIf I could move head to (2,2) from (1,2), but (2,2) is occupied, so I can't.\n\nSo no way to go right from (1,2).\n\nThus, the only move is down to (1,1), then trapped.\n\nSo eating the food is fatal.\n\nTherefore, I should not go for the food directly.\n\nAt turn 77, instead of moving down to (1,3), I should move right to (2,4) to avoid the trap.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), for example.\n\nOn turn 77, move right to (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 78, from (2,4), direction right, I can go right to (3,4) or down to (2,3), as up is occupied.\n\nSay I go to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), etc., tail moved to (3,2) or something.\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — tail at (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,4), can go to (4,4), (3,5), (3,3), or left to (2,4) occupied.\n\nDirection right, so left opposite, invalid.\n\n(3,5) occupied? Positions have (3,5), yes, body segment.\n\n(4,4) free? Not listed, so free.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nSo to (4,4) or (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, I can explore.\n\nBut the food at (1,2) will expire soon, and I may not be able to eat it, but since eating it is bad, I should ignore it and focus on survival.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it later if possible, but with life span, only until turn 80.\n\nBy turn 80, if I'm not near, I can't eat it.\n\nBut since eating it traps me, better to let it expire and find other ways.\n\nBut there might be no other food, so score might not increase, but survival is key.\n\nThe AI should prioritize long-term survival to have more chances to eat future food.\n\nSo for now, avoid the food and move to open areas.\n\nFrom the current position, moving right to (2,4) seems better, as it opens more options.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nIf I go to (2,3), then to (3,3) or (1,3), but (1,3) might lead to the food temptation.\n\nBut if I go to (3,3), for example.\n\nLet's list free cells to see possible paths.\n\nFree cells: all cells not snake or wall.\n\nWalls: (5,2) internal, and borders not cells.\n\nPlayable cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6) but (1,6) is wall? y=6, but y=6 is border, so not playable? Walls: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, so for y, cells with y=1 to 6 are playable, but y=6 is included? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are playable for x=1-6, except internal walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nSo playable: for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo free cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6) y=6, x=1: (1,6) is not in snake, but is it playable? y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), (2,4) but (2,4) is not occupied yet? Current head is at (1,4), so (2,4) is free.\n\nList all:\n\nFor x=1: y=1,2,3 free (y=4,5 occupied)\n\ny=6: (1,6) free\n\nx=2: y=1,2 occupied, y=3 free, y=4 free (since head moving, but currently free), y=5 occupied, y=6? (2,6) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,6) not in snake positions.\n\nSimilarly, x=3: y=1,2,5 occupied, y=3 free, y=4 free, y=6 free? (3,6) not occupied.\n\nx=4: y=1,2,5,6 occupied, y=3 free, y=4 free?

Snake has (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,1), no (5,3), and (5,2) wall, so (5,3) free.\n\ny=3 for x=5.\n\nx=6: y=1,2,3,4 occupied, y=5 free, y=6 free? (6,5) not occupied, (6,6) not.\n\nAlso, internal wall (5,2), so not a cell.\n\nSo free cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,6), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(5,3) is free, as above.\n\n(6,5) and (6,6).\n\nAlso (3,6), etc.\n\nNow, food at (1,2), which is free.\n\nBut as we saw, it's a trap to go there.\n\nThe open areas are like (3,4), (4,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom current, moving right to (2,4) on turn 77.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), then to (4,4), etc., which might be safer.\n\nIf I go to (2,3), then to (3,3) or (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is close to food.\n\nTo avoid the food, I should not go to (1,3).\n\nSo better to go to (3,4) or (2,3) then (3,3).\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,2), which might move.\n\nBut in general, the center might have more space.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate a sequence.\n\nTurn 77: current head (1,4), direction down. Options: down to (1,3) or right to (2,4).\n\nIf I go down to (1,3), then as before, on turn 78 I can go to (1,2) to eat or (2,3).\n\nIf I eat on turn 78, then on turn 79 to (1,1), turn 80 from (1,1) no move, die.\n\nIf on turn 78 from (1,3) I go to (2,3), then from (2,3), on turn 79 I can go to (3,3) or (1,3) but (1,3) is now body if I moved from it.\n\nAfter turn 77: move down to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), etc. tail (4,2).\n\nOn turn 78, if I move right to (2,3), then head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), etc. tail moves, so (4,2) removed, new tail (3,2).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  -- tail (3,2)\n\nFrom (2,3), can go to (3,3) or (1,3) but (1,3) is body, occupied, so only to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 79 to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), can go to (4,3), (3,4), (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, (2,3) occupied, so to (4,3) or (3,4).\n\nSay to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 80 to (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nMeanwhile, food at (1,2) expires after turn 80, so not eaten, but I survive longer.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,3) I go to (3,3), same thing.\n\nBut on turn 77, if I move right to (2,4) instead.\n\nTurn 77: move right to (2,4)\n\nPositions: head (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ... tail (4,2)\n\nOn turn 78, from (2,4), go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nSay go to (3,4)\n\nPositions: head (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  -- tail (3,2)\n\nFrom (3,4), go to (4,4) or (3,3)\n\nSay (4,4)\n\nThen to (4,3) or (5,4) but (5,4) occupied, etc.\n\nI can survive for many turns in the free areas.\n\nTherefore, to maximize survival, I should avoid the food and move to the right.\n\nSo for turn 77, move right to (2,4).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many, but probably for 5 turns or so, but since the state might change with new food, I should only provide for the current and immediate future based on current info.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output is for the turns starting from current.\n\nIn the answer format, it says to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many; I think I need to provide a sequence for a few turns.\n\nSince new food may spawn, I should provide actions only for the current turn, but the format says to list multiple turns.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan and output a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns if possible.\n\nBut with the current state, I can plan a path.\n\nSince the food is dangerous, I can ignore it and move to open space.\n\nSo for turn 77: move right to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 78: from (2,4), I can move down to (2,3) or right to (3,4). Both seem ok, but (2,3) might be closer to the left, but I can go to (3,4) to center.\n\nSay move to (3,4)\n\nTurn 79: from (3,4), move to (4,4) (since (3,5) occupied, (3,3) free, but (4,4) is free and central.\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nThen turn 80: from (4,4), can move to (4,3) or (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, or (3,4) occupied, or (5,4) occupied, so only to (4,3) or perhaps (3,4) invalid.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3) down, or (4,5) up but occupied, (3,4) left occupied, (5,4) right occupied? (5,4) is body.\n\nSo only to (4,3) or if I can go up/down.\n\n(4,4) to down (4,3) or up (4,5) occupied, left (3,4) occupied, right (5,4) occupied, so only to (4,3).\n\nThen from (4,3) to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied, or (5,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not get too detailed.\n\nSince I need to avoid the food, and it expires soon, I can have a sequence that doesn't go near it.\n\nFor the output, I should provide actions for 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 77.\n\nAction turn 77: R (right to (2,4))\n\nThen turn 78: from (2,4), move to (3,4) (right)\n\nTurn 79: from (3,4), move to (4,4) (right)\n\nTurn 80: from (4,4), only possible to (4,3) (down)\n\nTurn 81: from (4,3), can move to (4,2) but occupied? Depends on tail position.\n\nBut at that time, tail may have moved.\n\nTo be precise, I need to simulate.\n\nBut for now, since I think moving right is better, I'll go with that.\n\nPerhaps at turn 77, move right.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nAfter moving right on turn 77, direction is R.\n\nThen on turn 78, from (2,4), direction R, so I can move right to (3,4) or down to (2,3), or up invalid, left invalid.\n\nI choose right to (3,4).\n\nThen direction R.\n\nOn turn 79, from (3,4), direction R, move right to (4,4), possible.\n\nDirection R.\n\nOn turn 80, from (4,4), direction R, move right to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, as per initial positions, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nLet's simulate positions.\n\nStart turn 77: snake pos: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] head dir D\n\nTurn 77: move R to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), direction R\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — tail (4,2) removed? No, when moving without eating, tail moves.\n\nOn move, head to new cell, tail removed.\n\nSo after move to (2,4), the body: the first segment after head is the previous head, so positions: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — and (4,2) is removed, so tail is (3,2)\n\nLength 19? Original 20, moved without eating, so length same, positions 19? List: 20 positions, head moves to (2,4), which was free, so new positions: [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) ] — that's 20 positions, but (4,2) is gone, and (3,2) is last, so tail at (3,2). Yes, 20 segments.\n\n(1,4) to (3,2) is 20 points?

Positions: [ (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] so tail (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is tail.\n\nNow turn 80: from (4,4), direction R, possible moves: right to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied (in positions), left to (3,4) occupied, up to (4,5) occupied, down to (4,3) free.\n\nSo only down to (4,3)\n\nMove to (4,3), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) — tail (2,1) removed, new tail (3,1)?

(5,2) is wall, but (4,2) is not wall, but occupied? In positions, at turn 80 end, positions have (4,1) and (4,5), but not (4,2), so (4,2) might be free or not.\n\nAt turn 80, positions: after move to (4,3), positions include (4,1), but not (4,2). (4,2) was previously occupied, but tail moved, so (4,2) is free now? In the sequence above, at turn 80, positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), ..., (4,1), (3,1) ] so (4,2) not in list, and not wall, so free.\n\nAlso, (5,3) free, (3,3) free, etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), direction down, so possible moves: down to (4,2), up to (4,4) occupied, left to (3,3), right to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is free, (3,3) free, (4,2) free.\n\nAnd no reverse issue since direction down, up is opposite.\n\nSo can go to (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3).\n\nI can choose, say to (5,3) to avoid the left side.\n\nBut (4,2) is near the wall, but ok.\n\nFor the sequence, I can define.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify actions.\n\nSince the immediate action is to move right on turn 77 to avoid the trap.\n\nSo I think for turn 77, action should be R.\n\nThen for the next turns, I can provide based on the plan.\n\nBut to complete the answer, let's say:\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 79: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 80: D (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 81: for example, R to (5,3) or something.\n\nBut I don't have to specify all, but the format might expect multiple.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output for current and future.\n\nBut for now, I'll go with move right.\n\nPerhaps I can consider moving down but not eating the food.\n\nBut from (1,3), if I go to (2,3) instead of (1,2), then as before.\n\nBut moving right initially seems safer to get away from the corner.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must avoid the positive food at (1,2) due to the high risk of trapping itself in the bottom-left corner after eating it. Although the food offers a +1 reward, moving towards it leads to a dead end, as the snake would be forced into (1,1) with no escape, resulting in death on turn 80 or 81. Instead, the snake should prioritize exploring open areas to the right and center of the grid, where there is more space to maneuver and avoid collisions. This strategy allows for potential future food consumption and extends survival.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 77)\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: Head at (1,4), moving down (D). The snake is 20 segments long, occupying many cells.\n- **Food**: Only one food at (1,2) with value +1 and life span 4 (can be eaten up to turn 80). However, eating it leads to immediate danger:\n  - If eaten on turn 78: Head moves to (1,2) on turn 78, growing to 21 segments. On turn 79, the only move is down to (1,1). On turn 80, no valid moves from (1,1) (all adjacent cells occupied or walls), causing death.\n- **Grid Constraints**: Playable area is x=1-6, y=1-6, with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2). Free cells are limited (15 free cells out of 35 playable), but the right and center areas (e.g., (3,4), (4,4)) offer more paths.\n- **Movement Options from (1,4)**:\n  - Down (D) to (1,3): Leads toward the food and potential trap.\n  - Right (R) to (2,4): Avoids the trap and opens paths to safer areas.\n  - Left (L) and Up (U) are invalid (wall and reverse direction, respectively).\n\n### 5+ Turn Lookahead Plan\n- **Avoid Food (1,2)**: Eating it sacrifices long-term survival for a +1 gain. Let it expire (after turn 80) and focus on survival.\n- **Escape to Open Areas**: Move right immediately to (2,4), then continue right/center to access free cells like (3,4), (4,4), and (4,3). This path avoids body collisions and walls.\n- **Sequence for Turns 77-81**:\n  - **Turn 77 (Current)**: Move R to (2,4) to escape the left side.\n  - **Turn 78**: From (2,4), move R to (3,4) (right is safe and heads to center).\n  - **Turn 79**: From (3,4), move R to (4,4) (continuing to open area).\n  - **Turn 80**: From (4,4), only valid move is D to (4,3) (other directions blocked by body).\n  - **Turn 81**: From (4,3), move R to (5,3) (avoids left side and utilizes free space; (5,3) is safe).\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns, with no risk of collision. Beyond turn 81, the snake can navigate to other free cells (e.g., (5,3), (3,3), or (4,2)) depending on new food spawns. Prioritizing open areas maximizes opportunities for future food while avoiding the immediate risk of the food at (1,2).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 77: R (right)\nTurn 78: R (right)\nTurn 79: R (right)\nTurn 80: D (down)\nTurn 81: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 78. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,4), and the body segments follow. The snake has 20 segments: from (2,4) to (3,2). Head direction is right (R), so it's moving east.\n\nFood: only one food item at (1,2) with value 1 and life span 3. Life span decreases every turn, including the current one, so at turn 78, it has 3 turns left. After turn 80, it will disappear if not eaten.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since the food is positive, eating it is good, but I have to be careful about collisions.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so we can't go there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake body: let's list all positions to avoid collisions.\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo the tail is at (3,2).\n\nNow, food at (1,2). But (1,2) is not occupied by the snake; let's see: snake positions include (2,2) and (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,2). (1,2) should be empty, I think. Food can spawn under body, but here it's not under body; it's at (1,2), which is not in the snake positions list.\n\nSnake positions: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo (1,2) is not occupied by snake, so food is there freely.\n\nHead is at (2,4), moving right. So from (2,4), possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be opposite and no instant reverse? Head direction is R, so current direction is right.\n\nNo instant reverse: I cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from current head direction R, I cannot move left (L) immediately. But for the next move, I can choose U, D, or R.\n\nPossible actions from (2,4):\n\n- Up (U): to (2,5)\n\n- Down (D): to (2,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (3,4)\n\n- Left (L): not allowed because opposite to current direction R.\n\nBut let's check what cells are occupied or walls.\n\nFirst, (2,5): is this occupied? Snake positions: (2,5) is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (2,4), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), so (2,5) is the body segment at index 3. So moving to (2,5) would be collision with body, since it's not the tail? But when we move, the tail moves, so only if it's not the tail.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves, tail also moves, so the tail cell becomes free if we eat food or not, but if we don't eat, tail moves away.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if it's food, tail stays, so snake grows; if not, tail moves, so the cell is free except for the new head position.\n\nBut collision: head cannot move to a cell occupied by body except the tail cell, because after move, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (2,5): it is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail; tail is (3,2). So moving to (2,5) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4): what is at (3,4)? Not in snake positions: positions are up to (3,2), (3,1), etc. (3,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\nList all snake positions to see:\n\n(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo (3,4) not in list, free.\n\n(2,3) not in list, free.\n\n(1,4) is body, but (2,4) is head, moving to (1,4) would be left to (1,4), but (1,4) is occupied, so collision.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4):\n\n- U to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by body (index 3), not tail, so collision.\n\n- D to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied, and not wall? Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. (2,3): x=2 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not here. So (2,3) is free and safe to move.\n\n- R to (3,4): (3,4) not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n\n- L to (1,4): (1,4) is occupied by body (index 1), not tail, so collision. Also, L is opposite to R, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible actions: D or R. U and L not possible.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food at (1,2). It has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns from now, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 78, life_span=3, so after turn 78, it becomes 2; after turn 79, it becomes 1; after turn 80, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 78, 79, or 80. If not eaten by turn 80, it's gone.\n\nTo eat it, I need to get the head to (1,2).\n\nCurrently head at (2,4), so I need to move towards (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n\nFrom (2,4), moving down to (2,3) or right to (3,4) doesn't directly help.\n\nI should plan a path to (1,2) within 3 turns.\n\nAlso, I have to avoid collisions and consider the snake body.\n\nMoreover, there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But here, food is at (1,2), not on tail. Tail is at (3,2).\n\nNow, let's see the grid to plan.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. And internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)  // tail\n\nSo the snake is coiled around. Let's list occupied cells:\n\nRow y=6: (4,6), (5,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4) head, (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (6,3)\n\ny=2: (6,2), (2,2), (3,2) tail, and food at (1,2) but not occupied by snake.\n\ny=1: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nAnd (1,2) has food.\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,4), (4,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nI need to get to (1,2) from (2,4).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go D to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (2,3), that's down.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can then go to adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to reach (1,2) in at most 3 moves.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), current head (2,4), so Manhattan distance |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3, so it's possible in 3 moves, but I have to go through free cells.\n\nPath to (1,2):\n\nOne way: from (2,4) to (2,3) (down), then to (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3), but (2,2) is occupied by snake body, segment at index 17? Positions: (2,2) is the 18th segment? Let's index: 0: (2,4), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (3,1), 17: (2,1), 18: (2,2), 19: (3,2)  // tail is (3,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is occupied, so I cannot go to (2,2) now.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) might be free? Not in positions, so free.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\n(1,2) free except for food.\n\nSo from (2,4) to (2,3): down.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) left, or (2,2) but (2,2) occupied, or (3,3) right, or (2,4) up but that's back.\n\n(2,3) to (1,3): left, or to (3,3) right, or to (2,4) up but occupied now? After move, the snake moves, so cells change.\n\nI need to think turn by turn.\n\nAt turn 78, head at (2,4), direction R.\n\nI choose action for turn 78.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,3)\n\nThen new head position (2,3), and since no food eaten (food at (1,2), not here), so tail moves, so the segment at tail (3,2) is removed, and new segment added at head, so snake becomes: head (2,3), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, so positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] and tail was (3,2), removed, so (2,2) is now the end? After move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (2,3), then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSnake before move: [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,2), (3,2) ] 20 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,3), no food, so new head (2,3), then the body is the first 19 segments: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,2), and tail (3,2) is removed, so the last body segment is (2,2), which was previously the second last.\n\nPositions: index 0 to 19: 0:(2,4), 1:(1,4), 2:(1,5), 3:(2,5), 4:(3,5), 5:(4,5), 6:(4,6), 7:(5,6), 8:(5,5), 9:(5,4), 10:(6,4), 11:(6,3), 12:(6,2), 13:(6,1), 14:(5,1), 15:(4,1), 16:(3,1), 17:(2,1), 18:(2,2), 19:(3,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), no food, so new positions: head at (2,3), then the segments from old 0 to 18: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). So 19 segments now, tail at (2,2).\n\nOld segment 19 (3,2) is removed.\n\nNow, from (2,3), head direction: I moved down, so new direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\nBut (2,4) is now body segment, occupied, so cannot go U.\n\n(2,2) is tail, but now it's occupied by body, and since it's the tail, I can move there only if I don't eat food or something? Moving to tail cell: if head moves to tail cell, and since tail moves away, it should be safe, as long as no food on it.\n\nIn this case, (2,2) is the current tail position. If I move to (2,2), and there is no food there, then head moves to (2,2), tail moves away, so no collision. If there is food, then eating it would mean tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide, which is death.\n\nBut here, (2,2) has no food, food is at (1,2), so moving to (2,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) should be free, (3,3) free.\n\nAlso, no walls.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can go D to (2,2), L to (1,3), or R to (3,3). U not possible.\n\nNow, if I go D to (2,2), I move to tail position. Since no food, head to (2,2), tail (which was (2,2)) moves away, but tail was at (2,2), and I move head to (2,2), so after move, head is at (2,2), and the previous tail is removed, so the new body has the segment that was at (2,3) becomes body, and so on.\n\nPositions before this move: head (2,3), body: (2,4), (1,4), ..., (2,2)  // tail at (2,2)\n\nAfter moving to (2,2): head to (2,2), no food (assuming), so tail is removed. Tail was (2,2), so it is removed, and new positions: head (2,2), then previous body except tail: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., up to (2,1)? Let's see the list.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]  // tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (2,2), no food, so new head at (2,2), and remove tail, so body is from index 0 to 18 of previous: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), ..., (2,1). Index 0: (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (4,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,4), 11: (6,4), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,2), 14: (6,1), 15: (5,1), 16: (4,1), 17: (3,1), 18: (2,1), and tail was (2,2) removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // tail at (2,1)\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (1,2) or other.\n\nBut back to turn 78.\n\nI am considering moving to (1,2) for the food.\n\nAt turn 78, if I move down to (2,3), then at turn 79, from (2,3) I can move left to (1,3), then at turn 80, from (1,3) I can move down to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 78: move D to (2,3)\n\nThen snake: head (2,3), direction D, positions as above.\n\nTurn 79: from (2,3), move L to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) should be free. Is it occupied? Current positions after turn 78: head (2,3), body (2,4), (1,4), etc., (1,4) is at (1,4), (1,3) not in positions, so free.\n\nMove to (1,3), no food, so new head (1,3), remove tail, which is (2,1) or something, but not relevant.\n\nThen turn 80: from (1,3), move D to (1,2) to eat food.\n\n(1,2) has food, so when head moves to (1,2), it eats the food, snake grows, so tail does not move, length increases.\n\nNow, is there any risk? At (1,2), after eating, the head is there, and since we grow, the tail stays, so the cell where tail was remains occupied, but head is at new position.\n\nBut need to check if moving to (1,2) causes collision.\n\nWhen at turn 80, head at (1,3), move down to (1,2). (1,2) is free except for food, so no collision. After eating, snake grows, so the segment that was tail is not removed.\n\nBut in terms of position, it should be fine.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the direction and no instant reverse.\n\nAlso, the food life span: at turn 78, life span 3, so on turn 78, if I move to (1,2)? But I'm not, I'm moving to (2,3).\n\nOn turn 78, food at (1,2) with life span 3. After turn 78, if not eaten, life span becomes 2. After turn 79, becomes 1. After turn 80, becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 79 or 80, but not on 78 from current position.\n\nIn my plan, I eat on turn 80.\n\nNow, another option: from (2,4), I could move right to (3,4) at turn 78.\n\nThen from there, it might take longer to get to (1,2).\n\nFor example, to (3,4), then I need to go west, but the snake body might be in the way.\n\nBut with only 3 turns, moving to (3,4) might not reach (1,2) in time, since (3,4) to (1,2) is |3-1| + |4-2| = 2+2=4, at least 4 moves, but food disappears after turn 80, so I have turns 78,79,80 to eat, so 3 moves including turn 78? Turn 78,79,80: I can move on these turns to eat.\n\nIf I move on turn 78 to (3,4), then on turn 79 to (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) is body, etc., then to (2,3), then to (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) might be occupied or not, it's messy.\n\nFrom (3,4), to (3,3), then to (3,2) or (2,3), etc., but (3,2) is tail, but might move.\n\nBut to reach (1,2) from (3,4), it's at least 3 moves: e.g., (3,4) to (2,4) but (2,4) is body after move, not possible; (3,4) to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2) but that's 4 moves, on turn 81, too late.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,4) not possible since occupied; to (4,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) at turn 78:\n\nTurn 78: move R to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), no food, so remove tail (3,2), new positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)  // tail (2,2)\n\nNow from (3,4), direction R, possible moves: U to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, occupied; D to (3,3), free; L to (2,4), occupied; R to (4,4), free? (4,4) not in positions, free.\n\nSo can go D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf go D to (3,3), then from (3,3) can go to (3,2), (2,3), (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is not occupied now? Current positions: (3,4) head, (2,4), (1,4), ..., (2,2) tail, so (3,2) free.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2): (3,2) free, then to (2,2) but (2,2) is tail, but later.\n\nBut to reach (1,2), from (3,3) to (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2), but (2,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 78, positions at turn 79 start: head (3,4), etc.\n\nTurn 79: from (3,4) move D to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), no food, remove tail (2,2), new positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)\n\nNow from (3,3), can move to (2,3), (3,2), (4,3), etc. (3,4) up occupied.\n\n(2,3) should be free, not in positions.\n\nMove to (2,3), then turn 80: from (2,3) to (1,3), then turn 81 to (1,2) but turn 81 food gone, life span 0 after turn 80.\n\nFood life span: at turn 78, life span 3. After turn 78, if not eaten, life span 2. After turn 79, life span 1. After turn 80, life span 0, gone. So last chance to eat is turn 80.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 80, I can move to (1,3) or to (1,2) directly from (2,3)? From (2,3) to (1,2) is not adjacent; (1,2) is left and down, not directly adjacent unless diagonal, but no, only orthogonal moves.\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,3) can go to (1,3) left, (2,2) down, (2,4) up, (3,3) right.\n\nTo (1,2) is not directly accessible from (2,3); must go through (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) might be occupied.\n\nIn this path, at turn 80, if I am at (2,3), I can go to (1,3), but not to (1,2) directly. Then on turn 81, to (1,2) but food gone.\n\nSo with the right move, I cannot reach (1,2) by turn 80 if I start by going right.\n\nTherefore, to reach the food in time, I must go down to (2,3) at turn 78.\n\nThen as before, to (1,3) at turn 79, to (1,2) at turn 80.\n\nNow, is there a way to eat earlier? On turn 78, from (2,4) I cannot go to (1,2) directly.\n\nOr on turn 79? If I go to (2,3) at turn 78, then at turn 79 I can go to (1,3) or to (2,2), but (2,2) is tail, and I can move to it if no food.\n\nBut to eat food at (1,2), from (2,3) at turn 79, I can go to (1,3) or to (2,2), but not to (1,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,2) at turn 79: from (2,3) move down to (2,2).\n\nAs earlier, if (2,2) has no food, it is safe because tail moves away.\n\nIn that case, at turn 79, I move to (2,2), then at turn 80, from (2,2) I can go to (1,2) left, since adjacent.\n\nAnd (1,2) has food, so I can eat it on turn 80.\n\nLet's see this path.\n\nTurn 78: move D to (2,3)  // as before\n\nAfter turn 78: head at (2,3), direction D, positions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] tail at (2,2)\n\nTurn 79: move D to (2,2)  // down to (2,2)\n\nSince (2,2) is tail and no food, head moves to (2,2), tail is removed, so new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // tail at (2,1)\n\nNow head at (2,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 80: from (2,2), I can move L to (1,2)\n\n(1,2) has food, so move to (1,2), eat food, snake grows, so tail not removed. New head at (1,2), and the body includes the previous positions, with tail staying.\n\nSo positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ... up to (2,1), and since we eat, tail (2,1) remains, so length increases by one.\n\nNo collision, since (1,2) was free.\n\nAnd food eaten on turn 80, before it disappears.\n\nIf I go to (1,3) at turn 79, then to (1,2) at turn 80, same thing.\n\nBut going directly to (2,2) at turn 79 might be similar.\n\nIn terms of the path, both work.\n\nBut I need to think about survival after eating.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but it's not in the way here.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to avoid collisions and plan for future.\n\nBut since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's see the state after eating.\n\nFirst, let's decide the actions.\n\nAt turn 78, from (2,4), I should move down to (2,3) to head towards food.\n\nThen at turn 79, I can either move left to (1,3) or down to (2,2).\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), then at turn 80 move left to (1,2).\n\nIf I move left to (1,3) at turn 79, then down to (1,2) at turn 80.\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 80.\n\nBut moving to (2,2) at turn 79 might be riskier if there is food, but there isn't.\n\n(2,2) has no food, so safe.\n\nNow, after eating at (1,2), the snake will be longer, and I need to find space.\n\nThe grid has some free areas, for example, around (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the map.\n\nAfter eating at turn 80, head at (1,2), and body includes (2,2), (2,3), etc., and tail at (2,1) or something.\n\nBut I need to move away from there to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), R to (2,2) but (2,2) is body now, occupied; D to (1,1), but y=1, not wall? Walls: y=0 is wall, y=1 not wall, but (1,1) is occupied? After positions.\n\nAt turn 80, after eating: head at (1,2), previous head was at (2,2) before move? Let's clarify.\n\nBefore turn 80: in the first scenario, at turn 79 end, head at (2,2), positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail at (2,1)\n\nThen turn 80: move L to (1,2), eat food, so new head at (1,2), and tail not removed, so positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // 21 segments, tail at (2,1)\n\nNow from (1,2), head direction: moved left, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 wall, cannot; R to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, occupied.\n\n(1,3) should be free? Not in positions, so free.\n\n(1,1) is occupied? Positions include (2,1), (3,1), etc., but (1,1) not listed, so free? Let's check: positions: (1,2) head, (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ... (2,1), (3,1), etc. (1,1) not mentioned, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) not mentioned, free.\n\nBut (1,4) is body, so (1,3) is above (1,2), should be free.\n\nSo from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nCannot go R or L to wall or body.\n\nNow, (1,1): y=1, not wall, but need to check if wall at y=0, but (1,1) is not border, border is y=0.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is y=3, free.\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then I can continue, but the area around (1,1) to (1,3) might be tight.\n\n(1,1) is free, I can go down.\n\nBut there might be better areas.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, after eating, I should move towards open space.\n\nFor example, to the right or up.\n\nBut let's see the free cells.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going for the food if it's too risky, but here it seems possible.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. But here, food is not on tail, and when I eat, tail is at (2,1), not adjacent to head at (1,2), so no issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 78, I have two choices: after (2,3), go to (1,3) or to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3) at turn 79:\n\nTurn 78: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 79: L to (1,3)\n\nThen after turn 79: head at (1,3), no food, so remove tail. Before move: positions at turn 79 start: head (2,3), body (2,4), (1,4), etc., tail (2,2) or earlier.\n\nAfter turn 78: head (2,3), positions [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] tail (2,2)\n\nTurn 79: move L to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) free, no food, so new head (1,3), remove tail (2,2), new positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)\n\nNow head at (1,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 80: move D to (1,2) to eat food.\n\n(1,2) has food, move to (1,2), eat, grow. New head (1,2), tail not removed, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)  // 21 segments, tail at (2,1)\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or D to (1,1), since R to (2,2) occupied, L to (0,2) wall.\n\n(1,3) is now body, so I cannot go U to (1,3); in positions, (1,3) is the second segment, body, so occupied.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), etc., so (1,3) is body, so moving U to (1,3) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is not directly adjacent? (1,2) adjacent: up (1,3), down (1,1), left (0,2) wall, right (2,2) but (2,2) is not in the positions? Positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3), then (2,4), etc. (2,2) is not listed, so free? But (2,2) was tail before, but not in new positions.\n\nIn the list: after eating at (1,2), positions: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nSo (2,2) is not occupied; it was removed earlier. So (2,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is free.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go:\n\n- U to (1,3): but (1,3) is body, occupied, collision.\n\n- D to (1,1): free, not occupied.\n\n- L to (0,2): x=0 wall, cannot.\n\n- R to (2,2): free, not occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,1), then I might be cornered.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2) or (2,3), but (2,3) is body.\n\n(2,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), if I do.\n\nBut to avoid, better to go to (2,2) to have more space.\n\nIn the other path, same.\n\nBut let's not worry yet.\n\nBack to turn 78, I need to choose the action.\n\nSince both paths to food are similar, I can choose one.\n\nBut there might be a difference in the direction.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nAt turn 78, after moving down, direction is D.\n\nThen at turn 79, if I move left to (1,3), direction L.\n\nOr if move down to (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen at turn 80, to eat.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut to be safe, moving to (1,3) at turn 79 might keep me away from the body cluster.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I move down to (2,2), (2,2) is tail, and after move, it's fine, but then at (2,2), I am near (2,1) and (2,3), which are body.\n\nIf I move left to (1,3), (1,3) is open, and then to (1,2).\n\n(1,3) is closer to the left wall, but I can move down to (1,2) or up to (1,4), but (1,4) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), before eating, at turn 79, positions: head (1,3), with body (2,3), (2,4), etc., so (1,4) is body, so from (1,3), I cannot go up to (1,4), occupied; down to (1,2) is for food; left to (0,3) wall; right to (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo only down to (1,2) to eat, which I do at turn 80.\n\nIn the other case, if I go to (2,2) at turn 79, then at turn 80 I go to (1,2).\n\nSo in both cases, at turn 80 I eat.\n\nThe difference is at turn 79 position.\n\nIf I am at (1,3) at turn 79, I have only one choice: down to (1,2) at turn 80.\n\nIf I am at (2,2) at turn 79, I can go to (1,2) or to (3,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) is body, (3,2) might be free.\n\nAt turn 79, if head at (2,2), positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail (2,1)\n\nSo (3,2) not occupied, free; (1,2) free; (2,1) occupied; (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (2,2), I can go to (1,2) or to (3,2) or to (2,1) but (2,1) occupied, cannot; down to (2,1) occupied, up to (2,3) occupied, left to (1,2), right to (3,2).\n\nSo can go L to (1,2) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (3,2), I don't eat the food, and it might disappear.\n\nBut I want to eat, so at turn 80, I should go to (1,2).\n\nSo no real difference.\n\nTherefore, for turn 78, moving down to (2,3) is the way to go.\n\nThen for turn 79, I can choose to go left or down, but since I need to eat at turn 80, it doesn't matter much; I can choose arbitrarily.\n\nBut to have more options, perhaps go to (1,3) at turn 79.\n\nSince the food is at (1,2), and I need to eat it, going to (1,3) first might be better.\n\nAlso, after eating, from (1,2), I can go to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\n(2,2) might be better to go into the grid.\n\n(1,1) is corner.\n\nSo I think for turn 78, action: D\n\nThen turn 79: L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 80: D to (1,2) to eat.\n\nAfter that, turn 81: from (1,2), I can go R to (2,2) or D to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) is free, as we saw, so go R to (2,2).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 83 or so.\n\nBut since there might be no other food, I need to survive.\n\nThe food has life span, and only one food now, but after eating, no new food mentioned, so I should just avoid dying.\n\nBut the state might have new food spawning, but not specified, so I assume only this food for now.\n\nIn the input, only one food given, so probably no other food, so after eating, I just need to move safely without colliding.\n\nSo after turn 80, head at (1,2), with the positions as above.\n\nTurn 81: move R to (2,2)  // since (1,3) occupied, (1,1) free but corner, so better to (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (2,2), no food, so tail removed? Tail is at (2,1), so new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)? After removing tail, the last is (3,1) or let's see.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ... (3,1), (2,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,2), no food, so head to (2,2), remove tail (2,1), new body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)  // 20 segments, tail at (3,1)\n\nHead at (2,2), direction R (since moved right from (1,2)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), but (2,3) is body, occupied; D to (2,1), but (2,1) not in positions? Positions: (2,2) head, (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ... (3,1), so (2,1) not occupied, free? (2,1) was tail removed, so free.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), not in new positions, so free.\n\nL to (1,2) occupied; R to (3,2), free.\n\nU to (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo can go D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free, not occupied.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), not here.\n\nSo I can go to (3,2) or to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is near corner, (3,2) better.\n\nSo go R to (3,2).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state might change, so probably output for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\n\"Turn t1: action on turn t1\"\n\n\"Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1\"\n\netc.\n\nAnd since I need to think ahead, I should output for t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4, so 5 turns.\n\nt1=78, so up to turn 82.\n\nBut at turn 80 I eat, so after that, I need to move.\n\nNow, to summarize:\n\nTurn 78: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 79: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 80: move D to (1,2) eat food\n\nNow turn 81: from (1,2), move R to (2,2)  // as above\n\nAfter turn 80, head at (1,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 81: move R to (2,2), so direction R.\n\nAfter move, as above, head (2,2), positions: head (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail (3,1)\n\nTurn 82: from (2,2), can move to (3,2) or (2,1)\n\nSay move R to (3,2)\n\nThen from (3,2), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can specify up to turn 82.\n\nSince after eating, no immediate danger, I can just plan to move towards open space.\n\nNow, another option at turn 78: if I move right to (3,4), but as I thought, I might not reach food, so better not.\n\nSo I think D is best.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nThen for turn 81: R (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 82: R (to (3,2))\n\nBut at turn 82, from (2,2) move to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 83, etc., but I think 5 actions are enough.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output can be for the next turns.\n\nAlso, in the state, head direction changes.\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n\nSo for t1=78:\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: R\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nBut turn 82 action depends on position, but since I planned, it should be fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I should output only until necessary.\n\nBut the format implies multiple turns.\n\nSince food is eaten at turn 80, and I survive, it should be ok.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 79, if I go to (1,3), and at turn 80 I must go down, no choice, but it's fine.\n\nIf at turn 79 I go down to (2,2), then at turn 80 I go left to (1,2), same effect.\n\nBut in that case, from (2,2) at turn 79, I could potentially not eat if I go right, but I won't.\n\nI think my plan is solid.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize reaching the positive food at (1,2) within its remaining lifespan of 3 turns (disappearing after turn 80) while avoiding collisions and considering future movements. The current head position is (2,4) with direction right. Possible immediate moves are down (D) to (2,3) or right (R) to (3,4), but moving right delays reaching the food and risks missing it. Moving down to (2,3) is optimal to start the path toward (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,3), moving left to (1,3) on turn 79 sets up for eating the food on turn 80 by moving down to (1,2). This path is safe and efficient, with no collisions. After eating, the snake must move to open space to avoid trapping itself. Moving right to (2,2) on turn 81 and then right to (3,2) on turn 82 provides access to the central grid, reducing collision risks.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan Justification:**\n- **Turn 78 (Current):** Move down (D) to (2,3). This avoids body collision (since (2,3) is free) and starts the path to the food. Moving right (R) to (3,4) is less efficient, as it takes longer to reach (1,2) and may miss the food deadline.\n- **Turn 79:** Move left (L) to (1,3). (1,3) is free, and this positions the head adjacent to the food for the next turn. Moving down to (2,2) is possible but offers no advantage and may increase risk near body segments.\n- **Turn 80:** Move down (D) to (1,2) to eat the food. This consumes the food before it disappears, increasing length by 1. The move is safe as (1,2) is free except for the food.\n- **Turn 81:** Move right (R) to (2,2). After eating, (1,3) is occupied by body, so moving right to (2,2) (free cell) avoids the corner and heads toward open space. Moving down to (1,1) is possible but risks cornering the snake.\n- **Turn 82:** Move right (R) to (3,2). (3,2) is free and moves the snake away from the wall and body clusters, providing more maneuverability for future turns. This path considers long-term survival by accessing the less crowded right side of the grid.\n\nThis plan eats the food on turn 80, scores +1, and ensures survival for at least 5 turns by avoiding walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 82, the snake should continue toward open areas like (3,3) or (4,2) to maximize space and await new food spawns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 78: D (down)  \nTurn 79: L (left)  \nTurn 80: D (down)  \nTurn 81: R (right)  \nTurn 82: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 79, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (2,3), and it's moving down (D). The full body is: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]. That's 20 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood items:\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 79, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 80? Life span is given as 2, so it has 2 turns left including this one. So it can be eaten on turn 79 or 80, and disappears after turn 80.\n- (4,3) with value 1 and life span 10, so it has 10 turns left.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nNow, head is at (2,3), direction down. Possible moves: Since moving down, I can go left (L), right (R), or down (D), but not up (U) because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move up next. Allowed moves: L, R, D.\n\nI need to check adjacent cells for movement.\n\nHead at (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- Down (D): to (2,2). But (2,2) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: let's list all positions to see what's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nSo (2,2) is the tail, since it's the last in the list. Positions are head first, so index 0: (2,3) head, then (2,4), (1,4), ..., up to (2,2) which is the tail.\n\nMoving down to (2,2): (2,2) is occupied by the tail. But according to rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward, so as long as it's not colliding with other body parts, it should be fine. But let's see what happens when I move.\n\nIf head moves to (2,2), and since it's the tail, the tail will move away, so no collision, because the snake grows only when it eats food. Here, no food at (2,2), so if I move to (2,2), the tail moves to the next position, so head and tail don't collide.\n\nBut (2,2) has no food, so the snake doesn't grow, so the tail moves, and head occupies (2,2), which was tail, but tail moves, so it's safe.\n\nNow, is there food at (2,2)? Food is at (1,2) and (4,3), not (2,2).\n\nAlso, walls: border walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,2) is within bounds, not a wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n\nSo moving down to (2,2) is possible.\n\nLeft (L): to (1,3). (1,3) is not in snake positions? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3). Also, (1,3) is within grid, not wall.\n\nRight (R): to (3,3). (3,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (3,5), (3,1), but no (3,3). So should be free.\n\n(3,3) might be empty.\n\nNow, food: (1,2) is at (1,2), which is below and left of head? Head at (2,3), so (1,2) is left and down.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is right and down? From (2,3), (4,3) is two right, same y? y=3, so right.\n\nHead at (2,3), food at (1,2) and (4,3).\n\n(1,2) has life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 79 or 80.\n\n(4,3) has life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. Also, there's a risk with tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's see the tail. Tail is at (2,2). Head is at (2,3), directly above tail. So head and tail are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), which is the tail, and if there were food on tail, it might be dangerous, but there is no food at (2,2), so it's safe. I just move there, no growth, tail moves to the previous position.\n\nAfter moving, the tail will be where the second last was, which is (2,1)? Positions: after head moves to (2,2), the body moves, so the segment that was at (2,3) moves? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (2,3), then (2,4), (1,4), ..., (2,2) tail.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), new head position: (2,2). But (2,2) was the tail. Now, since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the new body is: new head at (2,2), then the old head (2,3) becomes first body segment, then (2,4), (1,4), ..., up to the second last segment, which was (2,1)? Let's list indices.\n\nLet me number the positions: seg[0] = (2,3) head, seg[1] = (2,4), seg[2] = (1,4), seg[3] = (1,5), seg[4] = (2,5), seg[5] = (3,5), seg[6] = (4,5), seg[7] = (4,6), seg[8] = (5,6), seg[9] = (5,5), seg[10] = (5,4), seg[11] = (6,4), seg[12] = (6,3), seg[13] = (6,2), seg[14] = (6,1), seg[15] = (5,1), seg[16] = (4,1), seg[17] = (3,1), seg[18] = (2,1), seg[19] = (2,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2): new head at (2,2). Since no food, tail is removed, so the new snake is: head at (2,2), then seg[0] becomes body at (2,3), then seg[1] at (2,4), ..., up to seg[18] at (2,1), and seg[19] is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\nTail is now (2,1), and head at (2,2), so they are still adjacent.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nNow, food at (1,2). (1,2) is adjacent to head? Head at (2,3) now, but after move, head at (2,2)? I'm considering turn 79 move.\n\nAt turn 79, head at (2,3), I choose move.\n\nOption 1: Down to (2,2)\n\nAs above, safe, no food, snake moves, tail shortens relatively, but length same.\n\nOption 2: Left to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is empty? Let's see if occupied. From positions, no (1,3), and not wall, so should be free.\n\nThen, if I go left to (1,3), new head at (1,3), body: (2,3) becomes body, then (2,4), etc., up to tail (2,2), but since no food, tail removed, so new positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), ..., (2,1), (2,2) minus the last? Similar to above.\n\nSpecifically: new head (1,3), then old head (2,3), then seg[1] (2,4), seg[2] (1,4), but (1,4) is there, seg[3] (1,5), etc., and tail (2,2) removed, so new tail is (2,1) or whatever.\n\nPositions after move left: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,1), and (2,2) is gone.\n\nFrom the list, after removing tail, the body is from seg[0] to seg[18], with seg[0] at (2,3) now body, etc.\n\nBut (1,3) is not occupied, so it's safe.\n\nOption 3: Right to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) should be empty, not in positions, not wall.\n\nNew head at (3,3), then body: (2,3), (2,4), etc., tail removed.\n\nNow, food: (1,2) is at (1,2), which is adjacent to (1,3) and (2,2), but not directly to head at (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), (1,2) is one left and one down, so not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,2) down, (2,4) up but can't go up, (1,3) left, (3,3) right.\n\n(1,2) is not adjacent to (2,3); it's diagonal.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is not adjacent; it's two right.\n\nSo no food adjacent to head now.\n\nBut I can plan to eat food soon.\n\n(1,2) has life span 2, so it must be eaten by turn 80 or it disappears.\n\nTurn 79: if not eaten, life span decreases to 1 after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten on turn t, and if not, at turn t+1, life span is L-1, and so on, until 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (1,2): life span 2 at turn 79. So:\n\n- If eaten on turn 79, life span 2, eaten, snake grows.\n\n- If not eaten on turn 79, at turn 80, life span 1, can be eaten on turn 80.\n\n- If not eaten on turn 80, disappears after turn 80.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3), life span 10, so it will be around for a while.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail at (2,2), no food there.\n\nAfter moves, tail might move.\n\nI need to think about getting to (1,2).\n\nTo eat (1,2), I need to move to (1,2) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (1,2) might be under snake body? Is (1,2) occupied by snake?\n\nSnake positions: let's list all: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n(1,2) is not in the list, so it's not occupied by snake body. So it's free to move to, as long as I can get there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) not in positions, free.\n\nNow, to eat (1,2), I need to be at (1,2) or adjacent to move there.\n\nFrom head (2,3), I can go left to (1,3), then from there, down to (1,2) on next turn.\n\nOr go down to (2,2), then left to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) has food, so if I go to (1,2), I eat it.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nAlso, tail position.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (1,2) since it has short life.\n\nOption: on turn 79, move left to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 80, move down to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut on turn 80, if I eat at (1,2), life span is 1, so it can be eaten.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and I add a segment.\n\nNow, tail is at (2,2) now, but after moves.\n\nCurrent turn 79:\n\nIf I move left to (1,3):\n\n- New head: (1,3)\n\n- Body: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), ..., up to (2,2) but tail removed, so new body: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]  // (2,2) removed, so tail is now (2,1)\n\nSnake length was 20, after no eat, still 20, but positions shifted.\n\nHead at (1,3), tail at (2,1)\n\nNow, food at (1,2) which is below (1,3).\n\nOn turn 80, I can move down to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nMove down to (1,2): (1,2) is not occupied by body? Current body: (1,3) is head, but will be body after move, positions: (1,3), (2,3), etc., (2,1), no (1,2), so (1,2) is free.\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), new head at (1,2), and since food eaten, snake grows, so tail not removed. New positions: head (1,2), then previous head (1,3) becomes body, then the rest, and tail remains, so length 21.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail is at (2,1), head at (1,2), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nAlso, no collision.\n\nBut after eating, the food disappears.\n\n(1,2) is eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, what about the tail? Tail at (2,1), not close to head.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nAnother option: on turn 79, move down to (2,2).\n\nThen head at (2,2), which was tail, but now head.\n\nBody: (2,3), (2,4), etc., tail removed, new tail at (2,1).\n\nThen on turn 80, I can move left to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nMove from (2,2) to (1,2): left.\n\nThen new head at (1,2), eat food, grow, so tail stays, positions: head (1,2), then (2,2) becomes body, etc., tail at (2,1) or wherever, but since grow, the last segment stays.\n\nOriginal after turn 79 move down: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), ..., (2,1)] tail (2,1)\n\nAfter move left to (1,2) and eat: new head (1,2), then (2,2) body, then (2,3), etc., and since grow, tail (2,1) remains, so new tail is (2,1), head at (1,2), adjacent? (1,2) and (2,1) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(1,2) and (2,1) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat (1,2) by turn 80.\n\nNow, which move on turn 79 is better?\n\nIf I go left to (1,3) first, then down to (1,2), or down to (2,2) then left to (1,2).\n\nIn terms of position, after eating, if I go via (1,3), after eating head at (1,2), body includes (1,3), etc.\n\nIf I go via (2,2), after eating head at (1,2), body has (2,2), etc.\n\nBut also, I need to consider the direction and future moves.\n\nMoreover, there is another food at (4,3) with longer life, but I should eat (1,2) first since it might disappear.\n\nBut let's see the grid and possible traps.\n\nFirst, the internal wall at (5,2), but that might affect later.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies many cells.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead (2,3)\n\nThen: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nSo let's plot:\n\ny=6: (4,6), (5,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4)  // (2,4) and (1,4) at y=4? (1,4) is x=1,y=4, (2,4) x=2,y=4\n\nPositions: (2,4) at (2,4), then (1,4) at (1,4), both y=4.\n\nThen y=3: head (2,3), and (6,3)\n\ny=2: (6,2), and tail (2,2)\n\ny=1: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\ny=0: wall\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) and (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is at x=4,y=3.\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (1,3) is free, (3,3) free, (4,3) has food, (3,2) might be free, etc.\n\nAfter eating (1,2), I can go for (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) has life span 10, so no rush.\n\nI should avoid getting trapped.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (2,2), and if I move, it will move.\n\nBut let's plan to eat (1,2) first.\n\nOn turn 79, I can move left or down.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), then turn 80 move left to (1,2) to eat.\n\nIf I move left to (1,3), then turn 80 move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 80.\n\nBut on turn 79, if I move down to (2,2), and (2,2) has no food, so no eat, life span of (1,2) decreases to 1 after turn 79.\n\nIf I move left to (1,3), also no eat, same.\n\nThen on turn 80, I eat it.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to find a path to (4,3) or other areas.\n\nBut there might be space on the left or bottom.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), head at (1,2), direction depends on how I arrived.\n\nIf I arrived from above, by moving down, so direction down.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move left, right, or down, but down to (1,1) might be wall? y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is not wall, y=0 is bottom wall, so y=1 is valid.\n\n(1,1): is it occupied? Snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but not (1,1), so free.\n\nBut let's not go there yet.\n\nFrom (1,2), after eating, if I came from left or above.\n\nIn the first case, if I moved to (1,3) then down to (1,2), so I moved down to (1,2), so direction down.\n\nPossible moves: left to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nRight to (2,2), which might be body.\n\nDown to (1,1), which is free.\n\nUp to (1,3), but (1,3) is body segment now, since after eating, (1,3) is part of body, so moving up would collide.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2) on turn 80:\n\nSuppose turn 79: move left to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 80: move down to (1,2) eat food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), then body: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc., and tail is still (2,1) or? Since grow, tail not removed.\n\nAfter move to (1,2) and eat, new head (1,2), previous head (1,3) becomes first body, then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., up to (2,1), and since grow, we add a new segment at the end, so tail is now the new segment at the position where tail was, but since not moved, tail position stays but becomes part of body, new tail is the previous segment.\n\nStandard: when eat, head moves to food, and tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo positions: new head at (1,2), then the old head (1,3) becomes segment 1, then segment 2 (2,3), segment 3 (2,4), ..., segment 19 (2,1), and new segment 20 at the old tail position, which was (2,1)? Before move, tail was (2,1), but when we move, for eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nBefore turn 80 move: after turn 79 move left, positions: head at (1,3), body: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1), and tail is (2,1)? Positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,1)] but (2,1) is the last, tail.\n\nNow, on turn 80, move down to (1,2): (1,2) is free and has food.\n\nSo head moves to (1,2), food eaten, snake grows, so the tail does not move. New positions: head (1,2), then the previous head (1,3) becomes body segment 1, then the previous segment 1 (2,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to the previous tail (2,1) becomes second last, and a new segment is added at the position of the old tail, which is (2,1), but (2,1) is already occupied? No.\n\nThe old tail position is where the new segment is added, but since tail didn't move, we add a new segment at (2,1), but (2,1) was the position of the tail, so now we have two segments at (2,1)? No.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nWhen the snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail stays in place, meaning the position of the tail remains occupied by the new tail, and the segment before it becomes body.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving head to new position with eat, the body segments remain in place, but the tail position stays, and we add a new segment at that position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from its cell.\n\nWhen eat, head moves to new cell, tail does not move, so the cell that was tail remains occupied, and the snake grows by one cell.\n\nSo positions: the new head is at the food cell, the old head becomes the neck, and all body segments stay, and the tail stays, so we have one more segment.\n\nFor example, before move: positions [A, B, C, ..., Z] with A head, Z tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell E with eat: new positions [E, A, B, C, ..., Z] so Z is still tail, and length increased.\n\nIn this case, before turn 80 move: positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] with (1,3) head, (2,1) tail.\n\nMove down to (1,2) and eat: new head at (1,2), so new positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] and tail is still (2,1), but (2,1) is now the last segment.\n\nBut (2,1) was tail before, now it's still tail, but since we added a new head, the position (2,1) is occupied by the tail segment.\n\nIn the list, (2,1) is included twice? No, in the new list, we have (1,2) as head, then (1,3), then (2,3), etc., up to (2,1), so (2,1) is the tail, and it's only once.\n\nThe segments are: index 0: (1,2), index 1: (1,3), index 2: (2,3), index 3: (2,4), index 4: (1,4), but (1,4) is at position 4, etc., and the last is (2,1), which was the old tail.\n\nSo tail at (2,1), head at (1,2).\n\n(1,2) and (2,1) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so no issue.\n\nFrom (1,2), direction is down (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: left to (0,2) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,2), but (2,2) is not in positions? New positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), etc., no (2,2) mentioned. (2,2) was not in the previous positions, so it should be free.\n\nPrevious positions before turn 79 move: had (2,2) as tail, but after turn 79 move left, (2,2) was removed, so not occupied.\n\nAfter turn 79 move left to (1,3), positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] so (2,2) is not there, free.\n\nAfter turn 80 eat at (1,2), positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] so (2,2) is free.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move right to (2,2) or down to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is free, not wall.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), to (2,2), which is free, no food, so no grow, move to (2,2), then tail moves.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 79 I move down to (2,2), then turn 80 move left to (1,2) to eat.\n\nAfter turn 79 move down to (2,2): positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] with head (2,2), tail (2,1)\n\nThen turn 80 move left to (1,2) and eat: new head (1,2), then body (2,2), (2,3), etc., up to tail (2,1), and since grow, new segment added at tail position, so new positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] with tail at (2,1).\n\nHead at (1,2), tail at (2,1), diagonal.\n\nDirection: moved left, so direction left.\n\nFrom (1,2), can move down to (1,1), or right to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body, so collision if move right, or up to (1,3) which might be body.\n\nIn this case, after eating, (2,2) is body segment, so from (1,2), moving right to (2,2) would collide with body.\n\nMoving up to (1,3) might be body or not.\n\nIn the positions: after eat, positions include (1,2) head, (2,2) body, then (2,3), etc. So (1,3) is not in the list? In this sequence, after turn 79 move down, positions had (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc., no (1,3), so (1,3) free.\n\nAfter turn 79 move down: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] so (1,3) not occupied.\n\nThen after turn 80 move left to (1,2) and eat: new positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] with tail at (2,1).\n\nSo body includes (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nFrom head at (1,2), possible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,1): free, not wall\n\n- Right to (2,2): but (2,2) is body, collision\n\n- Up to (1,3): (1,3) not in positions, so free\n\n- Left to (0,2): wall, invalid\n\nSo can move down or up.\n\nIf I move up to (1,3), then I can go to other areas.\n\nBut in the first approach, when I moved to (1,3) first, then down, from (1,2) I can move down or right to (2,2).\n\nBut in both cases, after eating (1,2), I have options.\n\nNow, to maximize long-term, I should eat (1,2) and then go for (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is currently free.\n\nBut the snake body is around, so I need a path.\n\nAlso, there is the internal wall at (5,2), which might block some paths.\n\nNow, life span of (1,2) is short, so I should prioritize eating it.\n\nOn turn 79, I can choose to move towards it.\n\nBut I also need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the head is adjacent to tail currently at (2,2), but since no food on tail, it's safe to move to it.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2), I am on the tail position, but since it moves, it's ok.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,3).\n\nIf I don't eat (1,2), it disappears, so better to eat it.\n\nBut I can eat it on turn 80, so on turn 79, I can move in a way that sets up for future.\n\nSince both moves allow eating on turn 80, it might not matter much for turn 79.\n\nBut let's consider the direction.\n\nIf I move left to (1,3) on turn 79, then on turn 80 I move down to (1,2) to eat, and head direction is down.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nIf I move down to (1,1), then I am at the bottom, might be cornered.\n\n(1,1) is free, but below is wall, so from there, I can move right to (2,1), but (2,1) is body or tail.\n\nAfter eating, tail is at (2,1), so (2,1) is occupied.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating at (1,2) via (1,3), positions have tail at (2,1), so (2,1) occupied.\n\nFrom (1,2), move down to (1,1): free.\n\nThen from (1,1), can move right to (2,1) but occupied, or up to (1,2) but body, or left to (0,1) wall. So only right is invalid, up is body, so only left and down but down wall, left wall, so stuck? (1,1): x=1,y=1, left to (0,1) wall, down to (1,0) wall, right to (2,1) occupied, up to (1,2) occupied by head or body? Head is at (1,2), but after move, if I move down to (1,1), new head (1,1), previous head (1,2) becomes body, so (1,2) is body, so from (1,1), moving up to (1,2) is collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (2,1) is occupied by tail or body.\n\nSo from (1,1), no valid moves, death.\n\nTherefore, after eating at (1,2), I should not move down to (1,1); it's a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,2), moving right to (2,2) is better.\n\nIn the second approach, if I moved down to (2,2) first, then to (1,2), from (1,2) I can move up to (1,3) or down to (1,1), but down to (1,1) is bad, so move up to (1,3).\n\nSo to avoid the bottom, on turn 79, moving left to (1,3) might be better because then from (1,2) I can move right to (2,2), which is free.\n\nIf I move down to (2,2) on turn 79, then to (1,2) on turn 80, from (1,2) I can move up to (1,3), which is free.\n\nEither way, I can avoid (1,1).\n\nBut let's plan for turn 79.\n\nPerhaps moving left to (1,3) is slightly better because it keeps me away from the bottom.\n\nThen after eating, I can go to (2,2) or up.\n\nBut (1,3) is now body after eating.\n\nAnother idea: I could eat (1,2) on turn 79 directly? But from (2,3), (1,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, so I can't move directly to it. I have to move to adjacent cells first.\n\nSo I must take two moves to eat it.\n\nTurn 79: move to an adjacent cell, then turn 80 move to (1,2).\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (1,2), I should head towards (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is on the way to the right side.\n\nThe grid has free space on the right and top.\n\nFor example, cells like (3,3), (4,3), (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,3) is free, (4,3) has food, (3,2) free, etc.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (5,2) might affect moves around there.\n\nBut (5,2) is a wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nNow, to reach (4,3), from (1,2) after eating, if I go to (2,2), then to (3,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 79: I need to choose action.\n\nOption A: Move left to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 80: Move down to (1,2) eat food.\n\nAfter that, head at (1,2), direction down.\n\nThen turn 81: I can move right to (2,2) (since (2,2) should be free).\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move right to (3,2) or up to (2,3), but (2,3) is body.\n\nAfter turn 80, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), etc., tail (2,1)\n\nSo (2,3) is body, so from (1,2) move right to (2,2) free.\n\nThen turn 81: move right to (2,2)? Head at (1,2), move right to (2,2), new head (2,2), no food, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), etc., and tail removed, so new tail is (3,1) or something.\n\nPositions after turn 81 move: old head (1,2) to (2,2), new head (2,2), then body: old body from (1,3) to second last, but tail (2,1) removed.\n\nAfter turn 80: positions [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] head (1,2), tail (2,1)\n\nMove right to (2,2): no food, so new head (2,2), then body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to (3,1), and tail (2,1) removed. So new positions: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] tail (3,1)\n\nHead at (2,2), direction right.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move right to (3,2), or down to (2,1) but (2,1) was removed, not occupied, or up to (2,3) but (2,3) is body.\n\n(3,2) is free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n(2,1) is not occupied now, since tail moved.\n\n(2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (2,2), move right to (3,2) or down to (2,1) or up to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, collision.\n\nSo can move right or down.\n\nIf move down to (2,1), then I am at bottom.\n\nBetter to move right to (3,2) to go towards (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), so from (3,2), I can go up to (3,3) or right to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be near wall.\n\nInternal wall at (5,2), so (5,2) blocked.\n\nNow, back to turn 79.\n\nIf on turn 79 I move down to (2,2), then turn 80 move left to (1,2) eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (1,2), direction left.\n\nThen turn 81, from (1,2), I can move up to (1,3) or down to (1,1) but bad, so move up to (1,3).\n\nNew head (1,3), no food, tail moves.\n\nPositions after turn 80: similar but with (2,2) in body.\n\nAfter turn 80 eat: positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (2,1)] tail (2,1)\n\nMove up to (1,3): (1,3) is free, no food, so new head (1,3), then body (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc., tail (2,1) removed, so new positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., (3,1)] tail (3,1) or something.\n\nThen head at (1,3), can move to other places.\n\nBut in both cases, I can reach similar states.\n\nBut moving left on turn 79 might be better because it doesn't involve moving to the tail cell, but it's fine.\n\nNow, there's another food at (4,3) with life span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat both.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), and it's not under snake, so I can eat it when I get there.\n\nNow, the life span of (1,2) is 2, so I must eat it by turn 80.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I lose the point, so better to eat.\n\nBut is there any risk in eating it?\n\nOne thing: when I eat at (1,2), the head is at (1,2), and tail is at (2,1), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nAlso, no collision.\n\nSo it should be safe.\n\nThen after that, I can plan to go to (4,3).\n\nThe shortest path: from (1,2) to (4,3), I can go right to (2,2), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), then up to (4,3), or other ways.\n\n(4,2) might be free.\n\nBut there is wall at (5,2), so (4,2) is ok.\n\n(3,3) is free, I can go to (3,3) then to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) has food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nNow, for turn 79, I think moving left to (1,3) is fine.\n\nThen turn 80 move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen turn 81, move right to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 82, move right to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 83, move up to (3,3) or to (4,2), but to reach (4,3), from (3,2), I can move up to (3,3), then right to (4,3).\n\n(3,3) to (4,3) is right.\n\nOr from (3,2) move right to (4,2), then up to (4,3).\n\nBoth possible.\n\n(4,2) might be closer.\n\nBut let's see if (4,2) is free.\n\nCurrently, snake positions have (4,1), (4,5), etc., not (4,2) or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, so free except food.\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nInternal wall at (5,2), not (4,2).\n\nSo ok.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, so I need space to move without colliding.\n\nAfter moving to the right, there might be more space.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) has life span 10, so I have time, but after eating (1,2), I can go directly.\n\nBut on turn 79, I should decide the first move.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating (1,2) if it's risky, but it doesn't seem risky.\n\nBut there's a special case: food can spawn under body, but here (1,2) is not under body, it's free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTail reward danger only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here no.\n\nSo I think eating (1,2) is good.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe format is for turns t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point.\n\nt1=79, so for turn 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, etc.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 79, I need to choose one action.\n\nLet's decide.\n\nI think move left to (1,3) on turn 79.\n\nThen turn 80 move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen turn 81, move right to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 82, move right to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 83, move up to (3,3) to approach (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), turn 84 move right to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut (4,3) life span 10, so by turn 84 it should be fine.\n\nLife span decreases, but 10 turns from turn 79, so at turn 79, life span 10, turn 80:9, turn 81:8, turn 82:7, turn 83:6, turn 84:5, still there.\n\nSo ok.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I can continue, but I only need to output up to 5 turns or so, but the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, ... for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but at least for the immediate actions.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output for the turns.\n\nIn this case, for turn 79, action.\n\nBut to be complete, I can output a sequence.\n\nLet's make a plan.\n\nTurn 79: Move L (left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 80: Move D (down to (1,2) eat food)\n\nNow, after that, head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 81: Move R (right to (2,2))\n\nAs (2,2) free.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 82: Move R (right to (3,2))\n\n(3,2) should be free.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 83: Move U (up to (3,3)) to go towards (4,3)\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nThen turn 84: Move R (right to (4,3)) eat food.\n\nBut I only need to output up to turn 83 or something? The sequence can be longer, but for the answer, I should output for the current turn and a few ahead.\n\nThe format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nAnd it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps output 5 actions.\n\nBut turn t1 to t1+4 or t1 to t1+5.\n\nt1=79, so 79 to 83 or 84.\n\nIn my plan, turn 83 is move to (3,3), which is not eating yet.\n\nBut I can stop at turn 83.\n\nSince the food at (1,2) must be eaten by turn 80, and I do it, then the rest is for (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) can be eaten later.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 79, if I move down to (2,2), then turn 80 left to (1,2) eat, then turn 81 up to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think L on 79 is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction constraint.\n\nCurrent direction is D, moving left or down or right, all allowed, no reverse.\n\nAfter moving L, direction L.\n\nThen move D, which is perpendicular, ok.\n\nThen move R, perpendicular.\n\nEtc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nNow, about the internal wall at (5,2): it might affect when I go to (4,3), but (4,3) is safe.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I can move up, down, left, right, but right to (5,3) might be ok, (5,3) should be free, but (5,2) is wall, so (5,3) is not wall.\n\nBut I don't need to go there now.\n\nSo I think the plan is ok.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 79: L (left)\n\nTurn 80: D (down) to eat (1,2)\n\nTurn 81: R (right) to (2,2)\n\nTurn 82: R (right) to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: U (up) to (3,3)\n\nThen I can continue, but for output, up to turn 83 or 84.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, from turn 79, 5 turns to turn 83.\n\nTurn 79,80,81,82,83: that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 79 is the first action.\n\nt1=79, actions for 79,80,81,82,83.\n\nYes.\n\nIn turn 83, I move to (3,3), which is not eating, but it's fine.\n\nI could go directly to (4,3) faster, but from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) then to (4,3), but (4,2) might be free.\n\nIn turn 82, at (3,2), instead of up to (3,3), I can move right to (4,2), then turn 83 up to (4,3).\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nLet's see: current positions, no (4,2), not wall.\n\nInternal wall (5,2), not (4,2).\n\nSo yes.\n\nIn that case:\n\nAfter turn 82 at (3,2), move R to (4,2) on turn 83.\n\nThen turn 84 U to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut for output, if I stop at turn 83, I can have move to (4,2) on turn 83.\n\nBut (4,2) has no food, so not eating.\n\nBut it's closer to food.\n\nEither way.\n\nBut since life span long, no rush.\n\nIn the sequence, I can output.\n\nBut for turn 79, I need to decide.\n\nI think I'll go with moving left on turn 79.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D  // eat (1,2)\n\nTurn 81: R  // to (2,2)\n\nTurn 82: R  // to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: U  // to (3,3) or R to (4,2), but let's say U to (3,3) to avoid being too low.\n\n(3,2) to (3,3) up.\n\nThen later to (4,3).\n\nBut for output, up to turn 83 is fine.\n\nTo eat (4,3) by turn 84, but not necessary.\n\nI think it's ok.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 79 and Beyond\n\n**Current State Overview:**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,2)).\n- **Snake**: Head at (2,3), direction Down (D). Length 20. Body positions form a complex shape, with tail at (2,2). Head and tail are adjacent vertically.\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): Value +1, life span 2 (must be eaten by turn 80 to avoid disappearance).\n  - (4,3): Value +1, life span 10 (plenty of time; lower priority than (1,2)).\n- **Key Constraints**:\n  - Cannot move Up (U) on turn 79 (instant reverse from current Down direction).\n  - (1,2) must be eaten within 2 turns (by turn 80) to maximize score.\n  - Tail reward danger: Currently, no food on tail, but must be monitored if head and tail become adjacent with food.\n  - After eating (1,2), avoid moving to dead ends (e.g., (1,1) is a risk due to walls and body).\n  - Long-term goal: After securing (1,2), navigate toward (4,3) for additional score, while ensuring survival by avoiding body collisions and walls.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan Rationale:**\n1. **Prioritize Eating (1,2)**: It has only 2 turns of life span (disappears after turn 80). Must be eaten by turn 80. Path: From head (2,3), move Left (L) to (1,3) on turn 79, then Down (D) to (1,2) on turn 80 to eat it. This avoids the risky bottom row and sets up for movement toward the center.\n2. **Avoid Risks**:\n   - Moving Down to (2,2) on turn 79 is safe (tail moves away), but it delays reaching (1,2) and risks being cornered near (1,1) later.\n   - Moving Left to (1,3) on turn 79 positions the snake better for post-food movement to open areas (e.g., right toward (4,3)).\n   - After eating (1,2), move Right (R) to (2,2) on turn 81 to escape the left wall and body, then continue right to open space.\n3. **Long-Term Survival and Path to (4,3)**:\n   - After eating (1,2), the grid has more free space on the right (e.g., (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3) are all free).\n   - (4,3) has a long life span (10 turns), so it can be eaten later (e.g., around turn 84). Plan a safe path: After turn 81, move Right to (3,2) on turn 82, then Up to (3,3) on turn 83 to approach (4,3) from a safe angle, avoiding the internal wall at (5,2).\n   - This path minimizes body collision risk and keeps options open for future moves beyond turn 83.\n4. **Direction and Collision Checks**:\n   - All moves respect the no-instant-reverse rule.\n   - Body collisions are avoided by moving to free cells (verified from snake positions).\n   - Tail reward danger: After eating (1,2), head at (1,2) and tail at (2,1) are diagonal, not adjacent, so no risk. Future moves maintain safe distances.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 79-83):**\n- **Turn 79 (t1=79)**: Move L (Left) to (1,3).  \n  - *Why?* Moves toward (1,2) efficiently. (1,3) is free and safe. Avoids moving to tail cell unnecessarily. Sets up for Down move to eat on turn 80.\n- **Turn 80**: Move D (Down) to (1,2) to eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 21).  \n  - *Why?* (1,2) is eaten just before it disappears (life span 1 on turn 80). Safe, no tail reward danger (head and tail not adjacent).\n- **Turn 81**: Move R (Right) to (2,2).  \n  - *Why?* (2,2) is free after tail movement. Escapes the left wall area and aligns for rightward movement toward (4,3). Direction changes to Right.\n- **Turn 82**: Move R (Right) to (3,2).  \n  - *Why?* (3,2) is free and safe. Continues path to open space, avoiding bottom row risks. Positions for upward move.\n- **Turn 83**: Move U (Up) to (3,3).  \n  - *Why?* (3,3) is free and safe. Approaches (4,3) from below, avoiding the internal wall at (5,2). Sets up for Right move to eat (4,3) on turn 84 (beyond this sequence).\n\n**Beyond Turn 83**:  \n- Turn 84: Move R to (4,3) to eat the food (if not eaten earlier).  \n- Continue exploring open areas (e.g., up or right) to avoid trapping the snake. Monitor food life spans and tail proximity.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating both foods, prioritizes survival by avoiding dead ends and collisions, and thinks 5+ turns ahead with a clear path.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 79: L (left)  \nTurn 80: D (down)  \nTurn 81: R (right)  \nTurn 82: R (right)  \nTurn 83: U (up)  \n}",

        "step": 80,
        "score": 20,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 80, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, the valid coordinates are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head at (1,3), and it's moving left, since head direction is L. The positions are: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\nThat's 20 segments. So the snake is quite long.\n\nFood: Two pieces.\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and it's turn 80, this food will disappear after turn 80? Life span is 1, so it should disappear after this turn. Let's read carefully.\n\nFood life span: Disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for food at (1,2), life span 1, at turn 80, it will disappear at the end of turn 80, meaning it can only be eaten on turn 80, I think. But since we're at turn 80, and we're deciding the action for turn 80, if the head moves to (1,2) on this turn, it can eat it, but it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 9. So it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning it can be eaten from turn 80 to turn 88, and disappears at turn 89? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, food with life span L will have countdown L at turn t, then at turn t+1, countdown L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to interpret: when food is spawned, it has life span N, meaning it will be present for N turns, including the turn it was spawned. So at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 during turn t, and if L-1 > 0, it remains, else it disappears after turn t.\n\nBut for eating, the head can eat it when moving onto the cell during a turn.\n\nIn this case, for (1,2): life span 1 at turn 80. During turn 80, if head moves to (1,2), it can eat it. After turn 80, life span becomes 0, so it disappears, not available for turn 81.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3): life span 9 at turn 80, so it will be available until turn 88, and disappear at turn 89.\n\nNow, snake head is at (1,3), direction left, so it just moved left to (1,3)? Positions: head is (1,3), previous was (2,3), and direction is L, which matches, since from (2,3) to (1,3) is left.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning it moved left to get to (1,3).\n\nNow, possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R, because reverse is not allowed. Reverse of L is R, so I cannot move right immediately.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left).\n\nNow, coordinates: (1,3), U would be (1,4), D would be (1,2), L would be (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so L is invalid.\n\nx=0 is wall, so moving left from (1,3) to (0,3) is wall, collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (1,2) is possible, but (1,2) has food with value 1, positive food.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible actions for turn 80.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- U: (1,4)\n\n- D: (1,2)\n\n- L: (0,3) — wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,3) — but reverse not allowed, since current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n\nSo only possible moves: U or D.\n\nU to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n\nNow, (1,4) is part of the snake body? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\nSo (1,4) is the fourth position, which is a body segment. But when the snake moves, the body also moves, so moving to (1,4) might be dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, for collision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, it dies. But since the tail moves, if head moves to where the tail was, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, in general, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, but moving to a cell occupied by a body segment that isn't the tail is collision.\n\nIn this case, the snake positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc.\n\nThe tail is (2,1), I think? Last position is (2,1), so tail is at (2,1).\n\nIf I move to (1,4), which is currently occupied by a body segment. Is (1,4) the tail? No, tail is (2,1), so (1,4) is a body segment, not tail. Therefore, if I move to (1,4), the head would be on a body cell, causing collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,2): (1,2) is not in the snake positions, I think? Positions: let's list all coordinates.\n\nSnake: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nSo (1,2) is not listed, so it should be empty, except for food.\n\n(1,2) has food, but the cell itself is not occupied by snake, so moving to (1,2) should be possible without immediate collision.\n\nBut (1,2) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nNow, what about the tail? The tail is at (2,1), which is not adjacent or anything yet.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for (1,2), is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (1,3), tail at (2,1). Distance: |1-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent would be sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (2,1): not adjacent; it's diagonal or something. Specifically, (1,3) and (2,1) are not neighbors; neighbors are (1,2), (1,4), (0,3) invalid, (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is (2,1), which is not adjacent to head (1,3). So no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving to (1,2) seems possible and I can eat the food.\n\nBut the food has life span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears. And value is +1, so eating it increases length by 1.\n\nNow, moving up to (1,4): but (1,4) is occupied, as I thought earlier. Let me confirm the positions after move.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the body shifts.\n\nBut for collision check, it's at the moment of movement. If the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (1,4): current positions, (1,4) is occupied by the fourth segment. When I move the head to (1,4), at that moment, the cell is still occupied, but since it's not the tail (tail is (2,1)), it should be a collision.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, only the tail cell is safe to move into.\n\nHere, (1,4) is not the tail, so moving to (1,4) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is empty, so no collision.\n\nTherefore, for turn 80, possible actions:\n\n- U: (1,4) — collision, death\n\n- D: (1,2) — safe, and eat food\n\n- L: wall, invalid\n\n- R: reverse, invalid\n\nSo only D to (1,2) is possible.\n\nBut is that right? U to (1,4): (1,4) is a body cell, not tail, so collision.\n\nD to (1,2): no snake there, so safe.\n\nMoreover, (1,2) has food, so eating it.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added.\n\nBut let's first confirm the move.\n\nSo for turn 80, I think I must move D to (1,2).\n\nBut the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to consider future moves.\n\nPerhaps there is a risk I'm missing.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,2) has life span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone, but I have to move, and only down is safe.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from (1,1) to (6,6), walls at borders and obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nThen: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) tail.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (4,3)\n\n(1,2) is below head, and it's empty except food.\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), the snake eats the food, so the new head position is (1,2), and since it ate positive food, the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,2), then the previous head (1,3) becomes second segment, and so on, down to tail (2,1), but since it grew, the tail stays, and we add a new segment at the end? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so the head moves to new cell, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance; it stays, so length increases.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move on that turn, so the snake gets longer.\n\nIn terms of positions: new head at food cell, and the previous positions all remain, with tail not moving.\n\nSo after moving to (1,2) and eating, the new snake positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), ..., up to (2,1), but since it grew, the tail (2,1) is still there, and the segment before tail was (3,1) or something.\n\nOriginal positions: 20 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new cell, tail moves, so positions shift, length same.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to new cell, tail does not move, so positions: new head, then all previous positions, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, moving to (1,2) and eating, so new head (1,2), then the previous positions starting from (1,3) to (2,1), all remain, so now 21 segments.\n\nSpecifically: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\nTail is still (2,1).\n\nNow, head direction: I moved down to (1,2), so new head direction is D.\n\nNow, for turn 81.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nBut first, on turn 80, only D is possible, so I must do that.\n\nBut let's confirm if U is possible? U to (1,4): but (1,4) is occupied, and not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, other moves invalid.\n\nSo for turn 80, action must be D.\n\nNow, after that, turn 81.\n\nHead at (1,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,2), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction is D, so reverse is U, cannot move up.\n\nAlso, L: (0,2) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR: (2,2) — is this valid? (2,2) is not in snake positions above, but let's see if it's occupied.\n\nAfter move, positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), etc., so (2,2) is not occupied, I think.\n\nCoordinates: from above, snake has (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc. No (2,2), so (2,2) should be empty.\n\nD: (1,1) — y=1, but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is valid? Walls at y=0, so (1,1) should be valid, but is it occupied? Snake positions: tail is (2,1), but (1,1) not listed, so empty.\n\nU: (1,3) — but (1,3) is now the second segment, and since head direction is D, moving U is reverse? Current direction is D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nR: (2,2) — possible.\n\nD: (1,1) — possible.\n\nNow, (1,1): is it wall? No, walls at y=0, so (1,1) is playable.\n\nBut let's check if moving there causes issue.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (1,2) with direction D:\n\n- U: reverse, invalid\n\n- D: (1,1)\n\n- L: (0,2) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,2)\n\nSo can move D or R.\n\nNow, (1,1) has no food, I think? Food is at (1,2) eaten, and (4,3).\n\n(1,1) is empty.\n\n(2,2) is empty.\n\nNow, I need to think about future turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,3) with life span 9, so it will be around for a while.\n\nBut I should plan a path to eat that, but first, from (1,2), I need to move.\n\nNow, the snake is long, so I need to avoid colliding with myself.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nLabel x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,2).\n\nSo (5,2) is obstacle.\n\nSnake positions after turn 80 move: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3) has food, (4,4), (5,3), but (5,2) is wall, so not, (3,2) etc.\n\nSpecifically, (4,3) has food.\n\nFrom head (1,2), I can move:\n\n- D to (1,1)\n\n- R to (2,2)\n\nNow, if I move R to (2,2), then new head (2,2), direction R? Since I moved right, new direction R.\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), ... up to (2,1), but since no food eaten, tail moves: the last segment (2,1) is removed? No.\n\nWhen moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves, so one segment added at head, one removed from tail.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), no food, so new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) — tail was (2,1), removed, so new tail is (3,1).\n\nOriginal 21 segments, after move no eat, 21 segments: head to new, then previous head to second last, but tail removed.\n\nPositions: new head (2,2), then the previous positions except tail: so from (1,2) to (3,1), but (1,2) was head, now second, (1,3) third, ..., up to (3,1) which was second last, now tail.\n\nList: previous positions after turn 80: index 0: (1,2), 1: (1,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,4), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (4,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4), 13: (6,4), 14: (6,3), 15: (6,2), 16: (6,1), 17: (5,1), 18: (4,1), 19: (3,1), 20: (2,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2) no eat: new head (2,2), then positions 0 to 19: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) and tail (2,1) is gone, so new tail (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is now tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (1,1), head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), ... up to (3,1), tail (2,1) gone, new tail (3,1).\n\n(2,1) was tail, removed, new tail is the previous segment before tail, which was (3,1).\n\nIn the list, position 19 is (3,1), position 20 was (2,1) tail.\n\nAfter move, new head, then positions 0 to 19, so (3,1) becomes tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for turn 81, from (1,2), direction D.\n\nOption 1: move R to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, R, but not L (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), but (2,3) is body segment? After move, positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), etc. So (2,3) is occupied by third segment, not tail. Tail is (3,1). So moving to (2,3) would collide.\n\nD to (2,1): (2,1) was tail, but after move, the tail is (3,1), and (2,1) is empty now? After moving to (2,2), the cell (2,1) is vacated, so (2,1) is free.\n\nR to (3,2): (3,2) should be free.\n\nBut (5,2) is wall, but (3,2) is different.\n\nSo from (2,2), with direction R:\n\n- U: (2,3) — occupied, collision\n\n- D: (2,1) — should be free, since tail moved\n\n- L: reverse, invalid (current dir R, opposite L)\n\n- R: (3,2) — free\n\nSo can move D or R.\n\nIf move D to (2,1), no food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is below, y=1, which is above wall y=0, so ok.\n\nBut let's think about getting to the food at (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, if from (1,2) I move D to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nL: (0,1) wall, invalid\n\nR: (2,1) — but (2,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (3,1), tail (2,1) gone, new tail (3,1).\n\nSo (2,1) is free.\n\nD: (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves from (1,1): R to (2,1) or U, but U is reverse? Direction is D, so moving U is opposite, invalid.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: (1,2) — but (1,2) is now second segment, occupied, and moving up is reverse, but even if not reverse, it's occupied.\n\n- D: (1,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (0,1) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,1) — free\n\nSo only R to (2,1) possible.\n\nThen from (2,1), and so on.\n\nBut if I go to (1,1), I'm cornered, and only way out is to (2,1), which might lead to issues.\n\nLet's think long-term.\n\nThe food at (4,3) is valuable, life span 9, so I have until turn 88 to eat it.\n\nCurrently at turn 80, after move to (1,2), turn 81.\n\nFrom (1,2), I have choices: move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1).\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), then as above, on turn 81 I must move R to (2,1), since other moves invalid.\n\nThen at (2,1), after move, direction R (since moved right from (1,1) to (2,1)).\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\nU: (2,2) — should be free\n\nD: (2,0) wall, invalid\n\nL: (1,1) — occupied? After moving to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (3,1), tail (3,1) is tail? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 81 move to (2,1): previous positions after turn 80: head (1,2), etc.\n\nAfter turn 81 move to (2,1) no eat: new head (2,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) and tail (2,1) was but removed? Previous tail was (2,1), but we moved to (2,1), which is new head, so the previous segment at (1,1) or something.\n\nAfter turn 80, positions: [ (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail (2,1)\n\nThen on turn 81, move to (2,1) — but (2,1) is the current tail, so moving to tail cell is safe, but since no food, it's a move without growth.\n\nHead moves to (2,1), which was tail, so at that moment, head and tail are on same cell, but since tail moves away, it's ok. Then the new positions: head (2,1), then the previous positions except the tail: so from (1,2) to (3,1), but (1,2) to (3,1) are 20 segments, with new head (2,1), so positions: (2,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) — and (3,1) is tail.\n\nSo 21 segments, tail at (3,1).\n\nFrom head (2,1), direction R (since moved right from (1,1) to (2,1), assuming (1,1) to (2,1) is right).\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves:\n- U: (2,2) — should be free\n- D: (2,0) wall, invalid\n- L: (1,1) — now occupied by second segment (1,2)? Positions: head (2,1), then (1,2), so (1,1) is not occupied; after move, (1,1) is vacated? When head moved to (2,1), the previous head (1,2) is now second, and (1,1) was not in positions, so (1,1) is free? No.\n\nAfter move to (2,1), positions are (2,1), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (3,1)\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,1), (1,2), (1,3), etc. (1,1) is not occupied, it's free.\n\nL to (1,1): free, but current direction is R, moving L is left, which is opposite, so invalid because reverse.\n\nR to (3,1): (3,1) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nU to (2,2): free.\n\nD invalid.\n\nSo from (2,1), can move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n\nR to (3,1): (3,1) is tail, so safe, and no food.\n\nThen the snake can continue.\n\nBut this path seems to be going right and down, but the food is at (4,3), so I need to go up and right.\n\nFrom the initial position at turn 81, from (1,2), it's better to move R to (2,2) rather than D to (1,1), because moving to (1,1) forces me to (2,1), which is corner.\n\nFrom (1,2), move R to (2,2).\n\nThen at (2,2), direction R.\n\nThen as earlier, can move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), then head to (3,2), direction R.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (3,3): should be free\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) might be tail or something, but let's see positions.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) no eat: new head (3,2), then previous (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) removed, so new tail (4,1).\n\nPositions: new head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n\n(3,1) was tail, removed.\n\nFrom (3,2), move U to (3,3): (3,3) should be free.\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) is free now.\n\nR to (4,2): but (4,2) is not wall? Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is different. (4,2) should be free.\n\nBut (5,2) is wall, so (4,2) is ok.\n\nThen to reach (4,3), I can go from (3,2) to (3,3) or (4,2), then to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut I need to see if it's safe.\n\nAlso, the life span is 9, so I have time, but since it's positive food, I should eat it when possible.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, for turn 80, I think I have to move D to (1,2) to eat the food and avoid death.\n\nThen for turn 81, from (1,2), I should move R to (2,2) to start heading towards (4,3).\n\nThen from there, I can plan.\n\nBut the answer needs to be a sequence of actions for multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for at least 5 turns.\n\nt1=80, so I need actions for turn 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, and possibly more.\n\nBut since the state changes, I need to simulate.\n\nFirst, turn 80: only possible action is D (down) to (1,2), eating the food.\n\nNew state: head at (1,2), direction D, snake length 21, positions as above.\n\nFood: (1,2) eaten, so only (4,3) with value 1, life span 9, but at turn 81, life span decreases to 8? At turn 80, life span was 9, after turn 80, it decreases.\n\nTurn 80: food at (4,3) has life span 9.\n\nAfter turn 80, it decreases to 8 for turn 81.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 80, (1,2) had life span 1, eaten, so gone.\n\nNow turn 81: head at (1,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: as before, U invalid (reverse), L invalid (wall), so D or R.\n\nI think R to (2,2) is better to avoid corner.\n\nSo move R to (2,2), no food.\n\nNew head (2,2), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nTail at (3,1).\n\nNow turn 82: from (2,2), direction R.\n\nCan move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is free, as before.\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nI should move towards (4,3), so R to (3,2) is better.\n\nMove R to (3,2), no food.\n\nNew head (3,2), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nNow turn 83: from (3,2), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), or R to (4,2).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), so from here, moving U to (3,3) or R to (4,2) gets closer.\n\n(3,3) is free? Positions: no (3,3), so yes.\n\n(4,2) free.\n\n(3,1) free but down.\n\nTo reach (4,3), I can go via (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is adjacent to (4,3), and (3,3) is also adjacent.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,2), so (4,2) is ok.\n\nAlso, (4,3) has food, so I need to eat it.\n\nBut when I eat, I grow, so I need to be careful with space.\n\nCurrently, from (3,2), move to (4,2) or (3,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,2), then next turn I can go to (4,3) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if to (3,3), then to (4,3).\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nTail is at (4,1), which is below.\n\nIf I move to (4,2), then to (4,3), I eat at (4,3).\n\nBut after eating, I grow, so the tail doesn't move, which might block some paths.\n\nFirst, let's go to (4,2).\n\nSo turn 83: move R to (4,2), no food? (4,2) has no food, food is at (4,3).\n\nSo move to (4,2), no eat.\n\nNew head (4,2), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail? After move: new head (4,2), then previous except tail removed. Previous tail was (4,1), removed.\n\nPrevious positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), ..., (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,2) no eat: new head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and tail (4,1) removed, so new tail (5,1).\n\nPositions: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nNow turn 84: head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) was tail, but now free? After move, (4,1) is not occupied, since tail is (5,1).\n\n(4,1) free.\n\nL to (3,2): (3,2) is now second segment, occupied, and moving left is reverse? Current direction R, opposite is L, so cannot move L.\n\nU to (4,3): has food, and should be free.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (4,3) — free except food\n\n- D: (4,1) — free\n\n- L: reverse, invalid\n\n- R: (5,2) wall, invalid\n\nSo can move U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), I eat the food, grow.\n\nThen new head (4,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: since eat, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and the previous tail (5,1) stays, so now 22 segments, tail at (5,1).\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), no eat, then positions shift, tail moves.\n\nBut I should eat the food since it's there.\n\nNow, after eating, I am at (4,3), with direction U.\n\nNow, for future turns, I need to find a way out without colliding.\n\nThe area around: (4,3) has neighbors: U (4,4), D (4,2) but (4,2) is now body segment, L (3,3), R (5,3).\n\n(5,3) should be free, since no snake there.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\n(4,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nPositions: (4,4) not in list, so free.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), with direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but occupied, invalid, L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (reverse).\n\nSo U, L, R possible, but D invalid.\n\nU to (4,4): should be free.\n\nL to (3,3): free.\n\nR to (5,3): free.\n\nAll good.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut back to the sequence.\n\nFor turn 80, action D.\n\nTurn 81, I need to choose.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 83, I could have gone to (3,3) instead of (4,2).\n\nBut let's write the sequence so far.\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nThen turn 81: from (1,2), I said move R to (2,2)\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake long, I need to ensure survival.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat at (4,3), is the head adjacent to tail?\n\nTail is at (5,1), head at (4,3), distance |4-5| + |3-1| =1+2=3, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same row or column, diff 1.\n\nSo (4,3) and (5,1) not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, in other cases.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nTurn 80: D (down) to (1,2), eat food.\n\nTurn 81: from (1,2), move R (right) to (2,2), no eat.\n\nTurn 82: from (2,2), move R (right) to (3,2), no eat.\n\nTurn 83: from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2) or U to (3,3).\n\nIf I move U to (3,3), then head to (3,3), direction U.\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail, since no eat, tail removed, new tail (5,1)? Previous tail (4,1) removed.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) no eat: new head (3,3), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and tail (4,1) removed, so new tail (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is tail.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) to eat.\n\nTurn 84: from (3,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nCan move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but occupied, invalid, L to (2,3) occupied? (2,3) is body, R to (4,3) which has food.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves:\n- U: (3,4) — free?\n- L: (2,3) — occupied, collision\n- R: (4,3) — free except food\n\n(2,3) is occupied, as per positions.\n\nSo move U to (3,4) or R to (4,3).\n\nIf move R to (4,3), eat food.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nMoving directly to (4,3) might be better.\n\nIn turn 83, from (3,2), moving to (4,2) then to (4,3) is direct.\n\nOr to (3,3) then to (4,3).\n\nBut (3,3) to (4,3) is right, which might not be reverse, depending on direction.\n\nBut let's go with moving to (4,2) on turn 83.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: R\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R (to (4,2))\n\nNow turn 84: from (4,2), move U to (4,3) to eat.\n\nAction: U (up)\n\nThen new head (4,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and previous tail (5,1) stays, so now two segments at (5,1)? No.\n\nWhen eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (4,3), then all previous positions: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) so tail at (5,1), but (5,1) is still there, and the segment before was (6,1), etc.\n\nLength 22.\n\nNow turn 85: head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nCan move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nAll should be free.\n\n(4,4) free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\nCannot move D.\n\nNow, to continue, I can for example move U to (4,4), or elsewhere.\n\nBut since we need 5 turns, up to turn 84, but turn 80 to 84 is 5 actions: 80,81,82,83,84.\n\nt1=80, so turns 80,81,82,83,84.\n\nActions: 80:D, 81:R, 82:R, 83:R, 84:U\n\nBut on turn 83, I moved to (4,2), which is not eating, then on 84 to (4,3) eating.\n\nI could have on turn 83 from (3,2) moved U to (3,3), then turn 84 to (4,3).\n\nBut similar.\n\nIn terms of actions, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think this is ok.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's see if on turn 81 I could move D instead.\n\nIf turn 81: from (1,2) move D to (1,1)\n\nThen as before, only move R to (2,1) on turn 81? Turn 81 action.\n\nAfter turn 80 D to (1,2), head at (1,2) dir D.\n\nTurn 81: if move D to (1,1), then head (1,1) dir D.\n\nThen turn 82: from (1,1), only possible move R to (2,1), since U invalid, D invalid, L invalid.\n\nMove R to (2,1), dir R.\n\nThen turn 83: from (2,1), can move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n\nSay move U to (2,2), then to (2,3) or (3,2), but it takes more turns to reach (4,3).\n\nFor example, at (2,2), then to (3,2), then to (4,2) or (3,3), etc., similar but delayed.\n\nAnd food life span decreases, but still 8 turns left or so.\n\nBut the first choice is more direct.\n\nSo I think moving R on turn 81 is better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: R\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nBut on turn 83, moving to (4,2), which is right from (3,2), dir R.\n\nThen turn 84 to (4,3) up.\n\nNow, for turn 85, I can add if needed, but 5 turns from 80 to 84.\n\nt1=80, turns 80,81,82,83,84 for 5 actions.\n\nTo be safe, I should include the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nAlso, need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, one thing: on turn 84, when I move U to (4,3), I eat, but is there tail reward danger?\n\nTail is at (5,1), head at (4,3), not adjacent, so no.\n\nAfter eating, tail is still (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nSo fine.\n\nThus, the actions.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 80):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (1,3), moving left (L). The snake has 20 segments, forming a dense body around the top-left and right areas of the grid.\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): Positive food (+1), life span 1 (must be eaten on turn 80 or it disappears).\n  - (4,3): Positive food (+1), life span 9 (available until turn 88).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Grid Constraints**: Playable area is x=1-6, y=1-6. Snake body occupies multiple cells, including (1,3) to (2,1) as listed.\n\n**Immediate Decision (Turn 80):**\n- Only valid move is Down (D) to (1,2) to eat the positive food at (1,2). Other moves are invalid:\n  - Up (U) to (1,4): Collision with body segment (not tail).\n  - Left (L) to (0,3): Wall collision.\n  - Right (R): Reverse move (opposite of current left direction) not allowed.\n- Eating (1,2) increases snake length to 21 and scores +1. Food at (1,2) is consumed and removed.\n\n**Turn 81 and Beyond:**\n- After moving to (1,2), head direction is Down (D). Priority is to navigate toward (4,3) while avoiding collisions and considering long-term survival.\n- **Path to (4,3)**: The food at (4,3) has 8 turns left (life span decreases to 8 on turn 81). Moving right (R) to (2,2) on turn 81 avoids the corner at (1,1) and starts a path toward (4,3). Subsequent moves are planned to reach (4,3) efficiently:\n  - Turn 82: Move right (R) to (3,2).\n  - Turn 83: Move right (R) to (4,2).\n  - Turn 84: Move up (U) to (4,3) to eat the food.\n- **Safety Checks**:\n  - No collisions: All moves are to free cells or safe tail cells (e.g., moving to (2,1) on turn 82 would be safe but inefficient).\n  - Tail Reward Danger: When eating at (4,3) on turn 84, head is at (4,3) and tail is at (5,1)—not adjacent (distance >1), so no risk.\n  - Obstacle Avoidance: (5,2) is avoided by moving to (4,2) and (4,3).\n- **5-Turn Plan Justification**: This sequence eats both foods quickly (maximizing score) and positions the snake for future movement. After turn 84, the snake can safely explore open areas (e.g., move to (4,4), (3,3), or (5,3) on turn 85).\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 80-84):**\n- Turn 80: D (down) to eat (1,2) and survive.\n- Turn 81: R (right) to (2,2), starting path to (4,3).\n- Turn 82: R (right) to (3,2), continuing path.\n- Turn 83: R (right) to (4,2), preparing to eat (4,3).\n- Turn 84: U (up) to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 80: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 81: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 82: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 83: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 84: U (up)\n}",

        "step": 81,
        "score": 20,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 81. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the edges. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (1,2), and the direction is down. Let me list out the snake segments in order:\n\n- Head: (1,2)\n\n- Then: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nThat's 21 segments. Let me count: positions from (1,2) to (2,1), that's 21 points? Let's list indices:\n\n1. (1,2) - head\n\n2. (1,3)\n\n3. (2,3)\n\n4. (2,4)\n\n5. (1,4)\n\n6. (1,5)\n\n7. (2,5)\n\n8. (3,5)\n\n9. (4,5)\n\n10. (4,6)\n\n11. (5,6)\n\n12. (5,5)\n\n13. (5,4)\n\n14. (6,4)\n\n15. (6,3)\n\n16. (6,2)\n\n17. (6,1)\n\n18. (5,1)\n\n19. (4,1)\n\n20. (3,1)\n\n21. (2,1) - tail\n\nYes, 21 segments. So the snake is quite long.\n\nFood: There's only one food mentioned: at (4,3) with life span 8 and value 1. Since value is 1, it's positive food. Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including the current turn, so after turn 88 it will be gone.\n\nNow, the head is at (1,2) and direction is down. Since it's moving down, the previous position was above it. Looking at positions: head is (1,2), next is (1,3), which is down, so yes, moving down to (1,3) from some previous, but direction is current head direction, which is down, meaning it just moved to (1,2) from above? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe positions are listed head first: so at turn 81, head is at (1,2), and it moved to there from the previous position. Since direction is down, it must have come from (1,1) or something, but (1,1) isn't in the list? Tail is at (2,1), but let's see the movement.\n\nFrom the positions, before (1,2) it was... the list is head first, so the second position (1,3) is where the head was one step ago? No.\n\nTypically in snake, the positions list gives the current state: index 0 is head, index 1 is the segment that was head one step ago, and so on, up to the tail.\n\nSo at current turn, head is at (1,2), and it just moved there. Since direction is down, it came from (1,1)? But (1,1) isn't in the positions. Let's list all positions:\n\n- Head: (1,2) - current position\n\n- Next segment: (1,3) - this is directly below, so the snake was at (1,3) before moving down to (1,2)? That doesn't make sense because moving down would increase y.\n\nI think I have a confusion with coordinates.\n\nThe grid: y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in such problems, y increases upwards or downwards?\n\nLook at the walls: border cells y=0 and y=7. Also, in positions, (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3), etc.\n\nDirection is down, and head is at (1,2). If direction is down, and it just moved to (1,2), it must have come from (1,1) or (1, something with lower y).\n\nBut in the positions, (1,3) is listed second, which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, (1,3) would be above (1,2), but direction down might mean decreasing y.\n\nI need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nLook at the walls: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" And internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nAlso, in snake positions, we have (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), etc. (1,5) has y=5, which is higher, and (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) so y is decreasing from head to neck? Head is (1,2), neck is (1,3), so y=3 to y=2, which is down if y=0 is bottom.\n\nSimilarly, later we have (6,1), (5,1), etc., with y=1.\n\nAlso, food at (4,3).\n\nI think y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. So moving up increases y, moving down decreases y.\n\nDirection down means decreasing y.\n\nSo head at (1,2), direction down, so it just moved from (1,3) to (1,2)? But (1,3) is the second position, which is the neck.\n\nIn the list, positions: index 0: (1,2) head\n\nindex 1: (1,3) - this is the segment that was head at previous turn, so at turn 80, head was at (1,3), and it moved down to (1,2) at turn 81.\n\nThen index 2: (2,3) - that was head at turn 79, and so on.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo current turn 81, head at (1,2), just moved down from (1,3).\n\nNow, possible moves: I can choose to move up, down, left, or right, but cannot instantly reverse. Since current direction is down, I cannot move up (which would be reverse) next turn. So possible moves: down, left, right. Moving up is not allowed because it would be reverse.\n\nDirections: U: (x, y+1) - up, increasing y\n\nD: (x, y-1) - down, decreasing y\n\nL: (x-1, y)\n\nR: (x+1, y)\n\nCurrent position: (1,2)\n\nCurrent direction: D (down, so from (1,3) to (1,2))\n\nCannot move opposite, so cannot move U (up) to (1,3), because that's where the neck is, and it would cause collision if I move there? Not necessarily, because the neck will move when I move, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\" meaning I cannot choose to move directly opposite to the current direction of motion.\n\nSo, since I just moved down to (1,2), I cannot move up to (1,3) because that would be reversing direction instantly.\n\nTherefore, possible moves from (1,2):\n\n- Down: to (1,1)\n\n- Left: to (0,2)\n\n- Right: to (2,2)\n\nBut I have to check for walls and collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo:\n\n- Down to (1,1): y=1, which is not y=0, so it's within bounds? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall, but let's see the grid.\n\nThe grid has cells from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so they are occupied and cannot be moved to.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacle at (5,2) is a wall cell.\n\nSo for (1,1): x=1, y=1. x=1 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Also not (5,2), so it should be free, but I need to see if it's occupied by snake body.\n\nSnake body: the positions except the head are body segments.\n\nCurrent head: (1,2)\n\nBody segments: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\nNow, (1,1) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, left to (0,2): x=0, y=2. x=0 is a wall, since border cells x=0 are walls. So cannot move there.\n\nRight to (2,2): x=2, y=2. Not wall, not in body positions? Body positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nFrom above: (1,2) is head, but when we move, the head moves to new position, and tail moves, so the body cells are from index 1 to 20, and tail is (2,1).\n\nCells occupied: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\n(2,2) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n\nBut (2,2) is adjacent, and not occupied now.\n\nAlso, food is at (4,3), which is not near head yet.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n- Down to (1,1): possible, not wall, not body\n\n- Left to (0,2): not possible, wall\n\n- Right to (2,2): possible, not wall, not body\n\nCannot move up because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only two choices: down or right.\n\nI need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n\nThere is food at (4,3) with life span 8. Current turn 81, so it will disappear after turn 88, meaning it can be eaten on or before turn 88.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so if not eaten, it will be there for 8 more turns, from turn 81 to 88.\n\nTurn 81: life span 8\n\nAfter turn 81, if not eaten, life span becomes 7 at turn 82, and so on, down to 0 at turn 88, and disappears after that.\n\nI can eat it on any turn from 81 to 88.\n\nNow, head at (1,2), food at (4,3).\n\nDistance: Δx = 3, Δy = 1, so Manhattan distance 4, but with obstacles.\n\nPath to food: from (1,2) to (4,3).\n\nOne way: right to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then up to (3,3), then right to (4,3). But (3,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrent snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to see free cells.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nFree cells: all except walls and snake.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and (5,2).\n\nx=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and specifically (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies: head (1,2), and body: (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is tail.\n\nNow, (1,2) is head, but when we consider moving, for collision, we care about the body excluding the tail if it moves, but generally, when head moves to a cell, it must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nOther body segments, if head moves there, collision.\n\nIn this case, for possible moves:\n\nTo (1,1): not occupied by any body, as per list.\n\nTo (2,2): not occupied, free.\n\nNow, if I move right to (2,2), then at turn 81, head moves to (2,2), direction becomes right.\n\nThen possible next moves.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns.\n\nThe food at (4,3) is positive, so I should try to eat it, but need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there might be risks near the tail or other areas.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid mentally.\n\ny from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Earlier I thought y=0 bottom, but in coordinates, (1,2) to (1,3) is up, since y=3>2.\n\nIn positions, from head (1,2) to (1,3) which has higher y, so y increases upwards.\n\nIn movement, U: (x,y+1) up, D: (x,y-1) down.\n\nSo y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nNow, current head (1,2), which is x=1, y=2.\n\nFood at (4,3), x=4, y=3.\n\nInternal wall at (5,2).\n\nAlso, snake body: let's see the area around (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is not in snake positions, so free.\n\nBut to reach it, I need a path.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go right to (2,2), then I can go right to (3,2), but (3,2) : is it occupied?\n\nCurrent snake positions: (1,2) head, (1,3), (2,3), etc. (3,2) not in list, so free.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go up to (3,3), then right to (4,3). (3,3) and (4,3) should be free.\n\n(3,3): not in positions, free.\n\n(4,3) food.\n\nBut (5,2) is wall, so from (3,2) I cannot go right to (4,2) because (4,2) might be free, but then to (4,3) up, but (4,2) is not wall? Walls are only borders and (5,2), so (4,2) should be free.\n\n(4,2) not in snake positions, so free.\n\nBut let's confirm the path.\n\nPath to food: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (4,3) or (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (4,3)\n\nBoth possible in 4 moves? From turn 81:\n\nTurn 81: move to (2,2) - that's one step\n\nThen turn 82: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: to (4,2) or (3,3)\n\nIf to (4,2), turn 84: to (4,3)\n\nOr from (3,2) to (3,3) turn 83, then to (4,3) turn 84.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly, but from (1,2) to (4,3) min 3 moves, but with current position, it will take at least 3 turns.\n\nTurn 81: move, head to new position.\n\nAfter move on turn 81, head at new cell.\n\nFood life span 8, from turn 81, so I can eat by turn 88.\n\nNow, but I need to consider if moving to (2,2) is safe, and then plan.\n\nBut there might be dangers.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (2,1), which is just below (2,2).\n\nIf I move right to (2,2) at turn 81, then the snake head is at (2,2), and tail is at (2,1), but tail will move.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), the new positions: head at (2,2), then the body: since head moved, the segments shift.\n\nOld positions: head was (1,2), moved to (2,2), so new head (2,2), then the previous body from index 1: (1,3) becomes the new neck, and so on, down to tail (2,1), which will be removed if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nWhen I move to a cell without food, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,2) on turn 81, no food there, so tail at (2,1) moves off, so (2,1) is now free.\n\nNew snake positions: head (2,2), then segments: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and tail was (2,1), but since no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is (3,1)? Let's see.\n\nOld positions: 0: (1,2) head\n\n1: (1,3)\n\n2: (2,3)\n\n3: (2,4)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,5)\n\n6: (2,5)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (4,5)\n\n9: (4,6)\n\n10: (5,6)\n\n11: (5,5)\n\n12: (5,4)\n\n13: (6,4)\n\n14: (6,3)\n\n15: (6,2)\n\n16: (6,1)\n\n17: (5,1)\n\n18: (4,1)\n\n19: (3,1)\n\n20: (2,1) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2), new positions:\n\n- New head: (2,2)\n\n- Then the previous segments from index 0 to 19 become the new body, but index 0 is old head, which is now at position 1, so:\n\nNew index 0: (2,2) head\n\nNew index 1: old index 0: (1,2)  // which was previous head\n\nNew index 2: old index 1: (1,3)\n\nNew index 3: old index 2: (2,3)\n\n...\n\nUp to new index 20: old index 19: (3,1)\n\nBut old index 20 was (2,1), which is not included because tail moved off.\n\nThe snake has 21 segments, so after moving without eating, it remains 21 segments, tail moves.\n\nNew head at (2,2)\n\nNew position 1: (1,2)  // previous head\n\nNew position 2: (1,3)  // previous position 1\n\nNew position 3: (2,3)  // previous position 2\n\nNew position 4: (2,4)  // previous position 3\n\nNew position 5: (1,4)  // previous position 4\n\nNew position 6: (1,5)  // previous position 5\n\nNew position 7: (2,5)  // previous position 6\n\nNew position 8: (3,5)  // previous position 7\n\nNew position 9: (4,5)  // previous position 8\n\nNew position 10: (4,6)  // previous position 9\n\nNew position 11: (5,6)  // previous position 10\n\nNew position 12: (5,5)  // previous position 11\n\nNew position 13: (5,4)  // previous position 12\n\nNew position 14: (6,4)  // previous position 13\n\nNew position 15: (6,3)  // previous position 14\n\nNew position 16: (6,2)  // previous position 15\n\nNew position 17: (6,1)  // previous position 16\n\nNew position 18: (5,1)  // previous position 17\n\nNew position 19: (4,1)  // previous position 18\n\nNew position 20: (3,1)  // previous position 19, new tail\n\nOld position 20 (2,1) is gone.\n\nSo tail now at (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (1,1) on turn 81.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nIf I go right to (2,2) on turn 81, then on turn 82, I can move to (3,2) or other directions.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2)\n\nBut L to (1,2): (1,2) is now occupied by the body, since after moving to (2,2), (1,2) is the neck, index 1, so if I move left to (1,2), that would be collision with body, because (1,2) is occupied and not the tail.\n\nNew positions after turn 81 move to (2,2): head (2,2), body includes (1,2), which is adjacent.\n\nSo moving left to (1,2) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,3): (2,3) is in body, position new index 3? New positions: index 1 is (1,2), index 2 is (1,3), index 3 is (2,3), so (2,3) is occupied by body.\n\nMoving down to (2,1): (2,1) was tail, but after move, tail is at (3,1), so (2,1) is free now.\n\nAfter move to (2,2), (2,1) is free, since tail moved to (3,1)? Tail is at (3,1), so (2,1) is empty.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ... up to (3,1)\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nSo (2,1) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,3) is occupied.\n\nSo from (2,2) at turn 82, possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): but (2,3) is occupied, collision\n\n- D to (2,1): free, not occupied\n\n- L to (1,2): occupied, collision\n\n- R to (3,2): free\n\nSo only down or right possible.\n\nIf I move right to (3,2), then from there, I can go to (4,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the path to food.\n\nFrom (2,2) at turn 82, if I go right to (3,2), then turn 83.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go right to (4,2), then up to (4,3) on turn 84.\n\nOr from (3,2) go up to (3,3), then right to (4,3) on turn 84.\n\n(3,3) should be free; let's check current state.\n\nIn current turn 81, positions: (1,3), (2,3), etc., (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) free, (4,3) food.\n\nBut on turn 83, when head at (3,2), the positions might have changed, but since no food eaten, the body shifts, but (4,2) and (4,3) should be free unless something happens.\n\nThere is a risk: the food at (4,3) might be under the body or something? But in current state, (4,3) is food, not occupied by snake.\n\nBut let's see if it can be eaten safely.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nBut in this case, food is at (4,3), tail is at (2,1), not adjacent, so no issue now.\n\nBut when I approach, need to be careful.\n\nFirst, back to turn 81 decision.\n\nI have two choices: down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\nIf I go down to (1,1) on turn 81.\n\nThen head to (1,1), direction down.\n\nThen new positions: head (1,1), then previous head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), etc., up to (3,1), and tail was (2,1), removed, new tail (3,1).\n\nOld tail (2,1) gone.\n\n(1,1) is not wall, not body, free.\n\nFrom (1,1), turn 82, possible moves: U to (1,2) - but (1,2) is now body, occupied, so collision if move there.\n\nD to (1,0) - but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nL to (0,1) - x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,1) - (2,1) was tail, now free, so possible.\n\nSo only right to (2,1) possible.\n\nThen from (2,1), etc.\n\nBut this seems to lead to a dead end or limited options.\n\nFrom (1,1), only can go right to (2,1).\n\nThen at (2,1), turn 82, head at (2,1), direction right (since from (1,1) to (2,1)? From (1,1) to (2,1) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) occupied, R to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is tail or body? After moving to (1,1) on turn 81, new positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (3,1) tail.\n\nSo (2,2) is free? Current occupied: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ... (3,1)\n\n(2,2) not listed, free.\n\n(3,1) is tail.\n\nFrom (2,1) at turn 82, after moving there.\n\nWhen at turn 82, head moves to (2,1), from previous (1,1).\n\nPrevious state after turn 81: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nMove head to (2,1), no food, so new head (2,1), new body: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) remains? Old tail (3,1), not removed because head moved to (2,1), not eating, so tail moves off, but (3,1) is not the tail position? Old positions: index 0: (1,1) head after turn 81\n\nIndex 1: (1,2)\n\nIndex 2: (1,3)\n\nIndex 3: (2,3)\n\nIndex 4: (2,4)\n\nIndex 5: (1,4)\n\nIndex 6: (1,5)\n\nIndex 7: (2,5)\n\nIndex 8: (3,5)\n\nIndex 9: (4,5)\n\nIndex 10: (4,6)\n\nIndex 11: (5,6)\n\nIndex 12: (5,5)\n\nIndex 13: (5,4)\n\nIndex 14: (6,4)\n\nIndex 15: (6,3)\n\nIndex 16: (6,2)\n\nIndex 17: (6,1)\n\nIndex 18: (5,1)\n\nIndex 19: (4,1)\n\nIndex 20: (3,1) tail\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), new head (2,1)\n\nNew index 1: old index 0: (1,1)\n\nNew index 2: old index 1: (1,2)\n\nNew index 3: old index 2: (1,3)\n\nNew index 4: old index 3: (2,3)\n\n...\n\nNew index 20: old index 19: (4,1)\n\nOld index 20 (3,1) is removed, so new tail is (4,1)?

In new positions, (3,1) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,1) was old tail, removed, so free.\n\nSo can move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1)\n\nThen to continue, but this path is going away from food, and I have limited moves, while the food is at (4,3), so it might take longer to reach, and life span is 8, but I should prioritize getting to food.\n\nGoing down to (1,1) seems to trap me in the bottom left, with fewer options.\n\nWhereas going right to (2,2) opens up the board and I can reach food in 3 turns.\n\nAlso, need to think about survival beyond that.\n\nBut first, let's go for the food.\n\nOn turn 81, move right to (2,2).\n\nThen, as above, on turn 82, from (2,2), I can only move down or right, since up and left are occupied or walls.\n\nEarlier: from (2,2), U to (2,3) occupied, L to (1,2) occupied, D to (2,1) free, R to (3,2) free.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nIf I move right to (3,2), then I'm closer to food.\n\nIf I move down to (2,1), then I go to the area where tail was, but tail has moved.\n\nBut moving right is better for food.\n\nSo turn 82, move right to (3,2).\n\nThen at (3,2), turn 82, head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\nNow, (3,3) should be free, (3,1) free?

Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 81: move to (2,2)\n\nTurn 82: move to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: move to (4,2)\n\nTurn 84: move to (4,3) and eat food.\n\nFood life span: at turn 81, life span 8, so after turn 81, if not eaten, life span 7 at turn 82, and so on.\n\nAt turn 84, before move, life span should be 8 - (84-81) = 8 - 3 = 5? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 81: life span 8, decreases after turn or including?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 81, life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 81, life span becomes 7 for turn 82.\n\nAfter turn 82, life span 6 for turn 83.\n\nAfter turn 83, life span 5 for turn 84.\n\nOn turn 84, I move to (4,3), and if food is there, I eat it.\n\nSince it decreases after the turn, but when I move, I can eat if present.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think on the turn when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the move or after?\n\nTypically, at the start of turn, if life span >0, food is there, and after move, if head moves to it, eat.\n\nCountdown decreases at the end of turn or beginning?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, with life span L, at the end of turn, L decreases by 1.\n\nSo for turn 81, life span 8, so food present during turn 81 moves.\n\nAfter turn 81, life span 7 for turn 82.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 82, life span 6 for turn 83.\n\nAfter turn 83, life span 5 for turn 84.\n\nOn turn 84, life span 5, food present, so I can eat on turn 84.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, when I eat at (4,3), the snake grows, so new segment added at tail.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, when I move to (4,3) on turn 84, head at (4,3), and food is eaten.\n\nThe cell (4,3) was food, so no issue.\n\nBut after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nNow, potential danger: is the head adjacent to tail when eating? Tail is at (4,1) or something.\n\nAfter turn 83, positions: let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 83 move to (4,2): from previous after turn 82.\n\nAfter turn 82: head at (3,2), body as above.\n\nMove to (4,2) on turn 83, no food (assuming), so new head (4,2), new body: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and tail (4,1) removed? Old tail (4,1), so new positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and tail (4,1) gone, new tail (5,1)\n\nNew tail is (5,1).\n\nNow on turn 84, move to (4,3) to eat food.\n\n(4,3) is adjacent, up from (4,2).\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), food eaten, so tail doesn't move, new segment added, so the previous tail stays.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then previous body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and the tail (5,1) is kept, so length 22 now.\n\nTail is still (5,1).\n\nNow, is there any danger? Head at (4,3), tail at (5,1), not adjacent. Adjacent cells: (4,2) is body, (4,4) free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free? (5,3) not wall, not occupied, free.\n\nBut no immediate collision.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to think about future moves.\n\nBut the food is eaten, so I need to survive and find other food, but currently only one food is given, and no other food mentioned, so after eating this, I need to avoid dying until more food spawns, but the problem doesn't specify food spawning, only the current state.\n\nIn the input, only one food is listed, so I should assume that only this food is present, or that other food may spawn later, but the state only gives current food.\n\nThe state says \"Food Positions\", and lists one, so probably only this one for now.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eating this is good.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to navigate without dying.\n\nIn the area, there might be risks.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,3), head at (4,3), I can move up to (4,4), or down to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, or left to (3,3), or right to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, but there is a wall at (5,2), but (5,3) is ok.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nBut let's see the surrounding.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival.\n\nAnother thing: when I was going to (4,2), I could have gone to (3,3) instead.\n\nBack to turn 83.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (3,2), I could move up to (3,3) instead of right to (4,2).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move right to (4,3) to eat.\n\nLet's compare.\n\nIf on turn 83, from (3,2) I move U to (3,3).\n\nThen head to (3,3), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 84, move R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nSimilar timing.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (4,3), and positions.\n\nBut in both cases, I reach food by turn 84.\n\nNow, for turn 81, I should move right to (2,2).\n\nBut what about the down option? If I move down to (1,1) on turn 81, I might not reach food in time or at all.\n\nFrom (1,1), I have to move right to (2,1) on turn 82, then from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf U to (2,2), then similar to before, but one turn later.\n\nTurn 81: down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 82: right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 83: up to (2,2)  // assuming from (2,1) to (2,2), direction U\n\nThen from (2,2), on turn 84, I can move to (3,2), then to (4,2) turn 85, to (4,3) turn 86.\n\nBut food life span: at turn 86, life span would be 8 - (86-81) = 8-5=3? After turn 85, life span 3 for turn 86, so I can eat on turn 86, still within life span.\n\nBut it takes longer, and I might have risks.\n\nAlso, on the way, when at (2,2) on turn 84, similar to before, but later.\n\nBut since I can reach faster by going right first, better to go right.\n\nMoreover, going down might lead to tight spaces.\n\nSo I think moving right on turn 81 is better.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, so for turn 81 and beyond, but I don't know how many turns, but since I need to think ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"maximize score\", but with only one food, after eating, no more food, so score is fixed, but I need to survive, but the game might continue, but with no food, I just need to avoid dying.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat this food and then survive as long as possible.\n\nBut since no other food, score is 1 if I eat it.\n\nIf I don't eat, score 0.\n\nBut I should eat it.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to navigate.\n\nBut let's first confirm the path.\n\nOn turn 81: move right to (2,2)\n\nThen on turn 82: from (2,2), I can move down or right.\n\nIf I move right to (3,2), as I thought.\n\nBut at (2,2), moving down to (2,1) is possible, but that might not be efficient.\n\nMoving right is better.\n\nThen on turn 82, move right to (3,2)\n\nThen on turn 83, from (3,2), I can move right to (4,2) or up to (3,3)\n\nIf I move to (4,2), then on turn 84 to (4,3) eat.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) on turn 83, then on turn 84 to (4,3) eat.\n\nNow, which is better?\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), if I come from (4,2), head at (4,3), came from (4,2), so direction up.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\n(4,2) is occupied, so cannot move down.\n\nCan move up, left, or right.\n\nSimilarly, if I come from (3,3), head at (4,3), came from (3,3), so direction right.\n\nThen moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3) occupied, R to (5,3)\n\nCannot move left.\n\nNow, the area: (4,4) might be free, (5,3) free, (3,3) free if not occupied.\n\nBut after eating, positions include (4,2) and (3,3) depending on path.\n\nIn first path: via (4,2)\n\nAfter turn 83: head at (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), etc., tail (5,1)\n\nMove to (4,3) eat, so new head (4,3), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), ... up to (5,1), and since ate, tail stays, so positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nSo (4,4) free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\nHead can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nD to (4,2) occupied.\n\nNow, if I came via (3,3): on turn 83 move to (3,3), then turn 84 to (4,3) eat.\n\nAfter turn 83 move to (3,3): from (3,2) to (3,3), direction U.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail? After turn 82: head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), tail (4,1) but removed? Let's not digress.\n\nIn both cases, after eating, I have options.\n\nBut to think about survival, the grid has walls, and the snake body.\n\nOne thing: the tail is at (5,1), and I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,3), if I move to (4,4), then I can go to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,5) is in the body.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see free spaces.\n\nSince I need to output actions, and think 5 turns ahead, I can plan a sequence to eat the food and then move to open area.\n\nBut for now, on turn 81, move right.\n\nThen for turn 82, from (2,2), I should move right to (3,2) to get closer.\n\nThen turn 83 to (4,2) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) might be better because from there to (4,3) and then I have more options.\n\nIf I go to (4,2), then to (4,3), and I came from below, so I can only move up, left, or right, not down.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), then to (4,3), I came from left, so I can move up, down, or right, not left.\n\nIn terms of options, similar.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nAfter eating, if I am at (4,3) and came from left, I can move up to (4,4), but (4,4) is free? In positions above, (4,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nThen to (4,4), then I can go to (4,5) but occupied, or (3,4), (5,4).\n\n(3,4) might be free or not.\n\nCurrent body: after eating at (4,3) via (4,2), positions include (4,5), which is body, so (4,4) free, (4,5) occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) not listed, free.\n\n(5,4) is body? In positions: (5,4) is there, yes, in the list, so occupied.\n\nSo from (4,3), if I move up to (4,4), then from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) occupied, D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4), R to (5,4) occupied, so only left to (3,4) possible, if free.\n\n(3,4) should be free.\n\nThen to (3,4), and so on.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,3) from (4,3), etc.\n\nTo avoid tight spaces, I should move towards the center or open areas.\n\nBut for now, since I need to eat the food, I'll go with moving right on turn 81.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can plan turns 81 to 84 to eat the food.\n\nTurn 81: R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 82: R to (3,2)  // from (2,2) to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: let's choose to go to (4,2) for simplicity, or to (3,3).\n\nSay to (4,2): R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 84: U to (4,3) eat.\n\nBut on turn 83, when I move to (4,2), direction R, then turn 84 move U to (4,3), which is not reverse, since previous was right, now up, ok.\n\nAfter eating, on turn 85, I need to move.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction U (since from (4,2) to (4,3)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nD not possible.\n\nNow, (4,4) free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), then as above, only L to (3,4) possible next, which might lead to complications.\n\n(3,3) is free, so I can move L to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (3,2) but (3,2) might be body, or (3,4), or (2,3), etc.\n\nAfter turn 84, positions: after eating at (4,3), head (4,3), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) free, (3,4) free, (4,4) free, (5,3) free, etc.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3) on turn 85, head to (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) occupied.\n\n(3,2) is body, occupied, so cannot move down.\n\n(2,3) is body, occupied? (2,3) is in positions, index, let's see: body includes (2,3), yes, so occupied.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\n(4,3) occupied.\n\nSo only U to (3,4) possible.\n\nThen to (3,4), and so on.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,3) on turn 85, head to (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen from there, U to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied, D to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, internal obstacle, cannot, L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3) occupied (since (6,3) in body).\n\n(6,3) is in positions, yes.\n\nSo from (5,3), no possible moves, collision or wall.\n\nTherefore, if I move R to (5,3) on turn 85, it would be fatal, as all adjacent cells are blocked.\n\nThus, I cannot move right to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (4,4) on turn 85, then only left to (3,4).\n\nSo best to move left to (3,3) on turn 85.\n\nThen on turn 86, from (3,3), only up to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, or (2,4) occupied, or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut this might be risky.\n\nTo avoid this, on turn 83, instead of going to (4,2), I should go to (3,3) first.\n\nThen on turn 83, move U to (3,3) from (3,2).\n\nThen turn 84, move R to (4,3) eat.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), came from (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 85, possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3)\n\nCannot move left to (3,3) occupied.\n\nNow, U to (4,4): free\n\nD to (4,2): but (4,2) is body, occupied, cannot\n\nR to (5,3): free\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf move U to (4,4), then as before, only L to (3,4) possible later.\n\nIf move R to (5,3), then as before, no moves, death.\n\n(5,3) to (6,3) occupied, (5,4) occupied, (5,2) wall, (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo only U to (4,4) is safe, but then trapped.\n\nBetter to not be in that position.\n\nPerhaps I should not go directly to eat, but approach from a different angle.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) on turn 83, instead of going up or right, but only those two choices.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 82, from (2,2), instead of moving right to (3,2), I could move down to (2,1), but that delays.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat the food later, but with life span 8, I have time, but eating sooner might be better to free up space or something.\n\nBut in this case, since only one food, no issue.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, harder to manuever.\n\nBut I have to eat it to score.\n\nNow, to avoid the trap after eating, I should eat from a direction that leaves more options.\n\nFor example, if I approach (4,3) from above or left.\n\nFrom above: (4,4) to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,4) is free, but how to get there.\n\nFrom current, at (1,2), I can go up, but I cannot because reverse not allowed, only down, left, right, but left wall, so down or right.\n\nIf I go right to (2,2), then I can go up? But at (2,2), up to (2,3) is occupied, so cannot.\n\nOnly down or right.\n\nSo I cannot go up immediately.\n\nPerhaps later.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) move down to (2,1) on turn 82.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2) but occupied, or R to (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,1) on turn 83.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), etc., but it takes longer and I might not reach food in time or have other issues.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo best to go directly.\n\nThen after eating, on turn 85, I should move to (3,3) if possible, but in the first path, I can.\n\nIn the path via (4,2), after eating at (4,3), I can move L to (3,3) on turn 85.\n\nThen from (3,3), I must move U to (3,4) on turn 86.\n\nThen at (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4) occupied, R to (4,4) free.\n\nSo only R to (4,4).\n\nThen at (4,4), U to (4,5) occupied, D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4) occupied, R to (5,4) occupied, so no move, death.\n\nOh, so I get trapped.\n\nIf I go the other way, similar issue.\n\nTherefore, I need to eat the food in a way that after eating, I have an escape route.\n\nFor example, if I eat from the left, so that I can go up or down.\n\nBut from left, I came from (3,3), then after eating, I can go up to (4,4) or down to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied.\n\nIn both cases, after eating, (4,2) or (3,3) is occupied.\n\nThe only free cells are (4,4), (3,3), (5,3), but (5,3) is dead end.\n\n(3,3) is free only if I didn't come from there, but when I eat, if I came from (3,3), then (3,3) is body, occupied.\n\nIf I came from (4,2), (4,2) is body.\n\nSo after eating, the cell I came from is occupied.\n\nSo from (4,3), the adjacent cells: (4,4) free, (4,2) occupied, (3,3) free if I came from (4,2), or occupied if came from (3,3), (5,3) free.\n\nBut (5,3) is dangerous.\n\nSo the only safe moves are to (4,4) or to (3,3) if free.\n\nBut after moving to (4,4), I am trapped.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (4,4), trapped.\n\nSo I need to have the tail or something move to free space.\n\nPerhaps I can delay eating or approach differently.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 83, from (3,2), I move U to (3,3) instead of to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 84, I don't eat immediately, but move to (3,4) or something.\n\nTurn 83: move U to (3,3)\n\nThen at (3,3), I can move to (3,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nOn turn 84, if I move to (4,3), I eat.\n\nBut if I move to (3,4) first, then eat later.\n\nBut food life span, I have until turn 88.\n\nTurn 84, life span 5, so I can wait.\n\nFor example, on turn 84, from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) instead of eating.\n\nThen from (3,4), on turn 85, I can move to (4,4) or (3,5), but (3,5) occupied, or (2,4) occupied, so only to (4,4) if free.\n\n(4,4) free.\n\nMove to (4,4) on turn 85.\n\nThen on turn 86, from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nNow, when I move to (4,3) on turn 86, head to (4,3), eat food.\n\nCame from (4,4), so direction down.\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,3), body includes (4,4), so adjacent up occupied.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) may be free or not, depending on positions.\n\nLet's simulate positions.\n\nFirst, turn 81: move R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 82: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: move U to (3,3)  // not eating\n\nAfter turn 83: head at (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail?

The food has a life span of 8, starting from turn 81, so it must be eaten by turn 88. The plan prioritizes reaching the food safely by turn 86, avoiding collisions and dead ends. After eating, the sequence allows for escape to open areas.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 81)**: Snake head at (1,2), direction down. Possible moves: down to (1,1) or right to (2,2) (left to (0,2) is a wall, up is reverse and not allowed).\n- **Food at (4,3)**: Value +1, life span 8 (can be eaten through turn 88).\n- **Path to Food**: The chosen path avoids body collisions and leverages the grid layout:\n  - Turn 81: Move right to (2,2) to open up board access.\n  - Turn 82: Move right to (3,2) to approach food efficiently.\n  - Turn 83: Move up to (3,3) to set up an approach from above, avoiding the risk of trapping after eating.\n  - Turn 84: Move up to (3,4) to position for a downward eat move.\n  - Turn 85: Move right to (4,4) to be adjacent to food.\n  - Turn 86: Move down to (4,3) to eat food safely, with escape options.\n- **Post-Eating Survival**: After eating at (4,3) on turn 86, moves like down to (4,2) or right to (5,3) are possible (though (5,3) may be risky; down is preferred for escape). The sequence ensures the snake does not get trapped.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving directly to (4,2) or (3,3) on earlier turns could lead to dead ends after eating. This path delays eating slightly to approach from above, providing more flexibility.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are based on simulating the grid and snake positions for each turn, ensuring no collisions or reverse moves. Moves are chosen to maximize options and avoid walls/body segments.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 81: R (right)  \nTurn 82: R (right)  \nTurn 83: U (up)  \nTurn 84: U (up)  \nTurn 85: R (right)  \nTurn 86: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. The turn is 82. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), then body segments: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). That's 21 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right, so the snake is moving east.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- At (4,3) with life span 7 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- At (4,2) with life span 10 and value +1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth are positive, so eating them increases length by 1. No negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a small grid to understand positions.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7):\n\n- Walls on borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions in order:\n\nHead: (2,2)\n\nThen: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nSo, tail is at (3,1).\n\nNow, head is at (2,2), moving right, so from (2,2), it can move to (3,2), (2,3), or (2,1), but since direction is R, it might prefer to go right, but I need to check possible moves.\n\nPossible moves from current position (2,2):\n\n- Up: (2,3) – but (2,3) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see: from positions, (1,3) is at (1,3), (2,3) is the fourth segment? Positions list: index 0: (2,2) head, index 1: (1,2), index 2: (1,3), index 3: (2,3), so (2,3) is occupied by the body. Similarly, (2,2) is head, so moving to (2,3) would be colliding with its own body at (2,3), which is segment index 3.\n\nBut in snake, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so if it moves to a cell that was occupied but is about to be vacated, it's ok only if it's the tail. Specifically, moving into the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves forward, so no collision. But for other body parts, it's a collision.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut here, (2,3) is not the tail; tail is at (3,1). So (2,3) is a body segment that won't move away immediately, so moving to (2,3) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, down: (2,1) – let's see if it's occupied or wall.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (2,1): x=2, y=1, y=1 is not y=0, so it's within bounds, not a border wall. Also, no internal wall at (2,1), obstacle is at (5,2).\n\nIs (2,1) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So (2,1) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, left: (1,2) – (1,2) is the second segment, index 1, not tail, so moving left to (1,2) would collide with body.\n\nRight: (3,2) – not in positions, not wall? (3,2): x=3, y=2, within 1-6? x from 0 to 7, so x=3, y=2, not border, obstacle at (5,2), not (3,2), so empty.\n\nUp: (2,3) – occupied by snake body at index 3.\n\nDown: (2,1) – empty, as above.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so possible moves: since direction is R, it can go U, D, R, but not L (opposite), because no instant reverse.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nSo possible moves from (2,2): U, D, R.\n\n- U: (2,3) – but (2,3) is occupied by body, so collision if move there, unless it's the tail, but tail is (3,1), not this.\n\n- D: (2,1) – seems empty, no wall.\n\n- R: (3,2) – empty, no wall.\n\nBut U to (2,3) is occupied, so not possible, would die.\n\nSimilarly, L is not allowed because opposite direction.\n\nSo only possible moves are D or R.\n\nD: to (2,1) or R: to (3,2).\n\nNow, I need to think about food. Food at (4,3) and (4,2).\n\n(4,3) has life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 82, so food at (4,3) will disappear after turn 82 + 6? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn 82, life span is 7, so it decreases to 6 on this turn, then 5 on next, down to 0, and disappears after that. So it can be eaten until the turn when countdown reaches 1? Let's think.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food with life_span L, at turn t, the countdown is L, then at turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before the next turn or something? I need clarity.\n\nTypically, if life_span is L at turn t, it means it can be eaten for L turns starting from t. After L turns, it disappears.\n\nBut \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, countdown is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 82, food has life_span 7, so at turn 82, countdown=7. After turn 82 actions, it decreases to 6, and so on. It can be eaten on turn 82, 83, ..., as long as countdown >0. When countdown=1, it can be eaten on that turn, and then decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2), life span 10.\n\nNow, (4,3) and (4,2) are both at x=4, y=3 and y=2.\n\nSnake head is at (2,2), so to reach (4,2) or (4,3), it needs to go right and then up or down.\n\nPossible moves now: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), that's one step right.\n\nThen from (3,2), what can I do?\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a risk about tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,1), and head is at (2,2), which is adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) and (3,1) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (2,2) adjacent to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\nTail at (3,1), which is not adjacent to head (2,2); (3,1) is down-right, but not directly adjacent. So no issue now.\n\nNow, food at (4,2) and (4,3). (4,2) is at x=4,y=2, which might be reachable.\n\nBut there's an obstacle at (5,2), which is near.\n\nLet me list the grid around the snake.\n\nI'll make a small grid for x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,2)\n\nBody: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nTail: (3,1)\n\nFood: (4,3) and (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is a food position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake has (6,2), (5,4), etc., but (4,2) not in list, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) not in snake positions.\n\nBut (4,3) might be under the snake? No, positions don't have (4,3), so it's free.\n\nNow, from head (2,2), move options:\n\n- D to (2,1): empty, not wall.\n\n- R to (3,2): empty, not wall.\n\nU and L not possible, as above.\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), new head position (3,2), then tail moves, so the tail (3,1) moves to the next position, but since snake moves, the segment that was at (3,1) moves, but tail position changes.\n\nAfter move, snake positions: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten yet, so when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n\nSo from current state, if move R to (3,2):\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nThen body: the segment that was at (1,2) moves to where head was (2,2)? Let's see the chain.\n\nCurrent positions: indices: 0: (2,2) head, 1: (1,2), 2: (1,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,4), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (4,5), 10: (4,6), 11: (5,6), 12: (5,5), 13: (5,4), 14: (6,4), 15: (6,3), 16: (6,2), 17: (6,1), 18: (5,1), 19: (4,1), 20: (3,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,2), the new positions:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 1 moves to position of old head (2,2)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to position of segment 1 (1,2)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to position of segment 2 (1,3)\n\n- And so on, up to segment 20 moves to position of segment 19 (4,1), and tail segment 20 was at (3,1), but since no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is what was segment 19, which was at (4,1), and moves to (3,1)? Let's think.\n\nWhen snake moves, the body segments shift: new position i is old position i-1 for i from 1 to len-1, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo new snake: head at new position (3,2)\n\nThen body: segment 1: old position 0, which was (2,2)\n\nSegment 2: old position 1, (1,2)\n\nSegment 3: old position 2, (1,3)\n\nSegment 4: old position 3, (2,3)\n\nSegment 5: old position 4, (2,4)\n\nSegment 6: old position 5, (1,4)\n\nSegment 7: old position 6, (1,5)\n\nSegment 8: old position 7, (2,5)\n\nSegment 9: old position 8, (3,5)\n\nSegment 10: old position 9, (4,5)\n\nSegment 11: old position 10, (4,6)\n\nSegment 12: old position 11, (5,6)\n\nSegment 13: old position 12, (5,5)\n\nSegment 14: old position 13, (5,4)\n\nSegment 15: old position 14, (6,4)\n\nSegment 16: old position 15, (6,3)\n\nSegment 17: old position 16, (6,2)\n\nSegment 18: old position 17, (6,1)\n\nSegment 19: old position 18, (5,1)\n\nSegment 20: old position 19, (4,1)  // since old segment 19 was at (4,1), it moves to position of segment 18? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo new position k is old position k for k=1 to len, but with head new.\n\nAfter move, the new body segment at index 1 is at the old head position (2,2)\n\nNew body segment at index 2 is at old position of index 1, which was (1,2)\n\nNew body segment at index 3 is at old position of index 2, (1,3)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment at index 20 is at old position of index 19, which was (4,1)\n\nBut the old tail was index 20 at (3,1), which is not included anymore, so the new tail is the last segment, which is at old position of index 19, (4,1)\n\nAnd since no food eaten, the length is the same, so the new snake has 21 segments? No, when no food, length decreases by one? No.\n\nIn snake game, when no food eaten, the snake moves, head to new position, tail is removed, so length stays the same.\n\nNumber of segments: originally 21 segments.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new cell, so we add a new head, and remove the tail, so still 21 segments.\n\nPositions: new head at (3,2)\n\nThen the first body segment is at old head position (2,2)\n\nSecond body segment at old first body position (1,2)\n\nThird at old second body position (1,3)\n\n...\n\nThe 20th body segment at old 19th body position (4,1)\n\nThe 21st segment (tail) at old 20th position (3,1)? Old positions have 21 cells: indices 0 to 20.\n\nAfter move, new positions: index 0: new head (3,2)\n\nIndex 1: old index 0 (2,2)\n\nIndex 2: old index 1 (1,2)\n\nIndex 3: old index 2 (1,3)\n\nIndex 4: old index 3 (2,3)\n\nIndex 5: old index 4 (2,4)\n\nIndex 6: old index 5 (1,4)\n\nIndex 7: old index 6 (1,5)\n\nIndex 8: old index 7 (2,5)\n\nIndex 9: old index 8 (3,5)\n\nIndex 10: old index 9 (4,5)\n\nIndex 11: old index 10 (4,6)\n\nIndex 12: old index 11 (5,6)\n\nIndex 13: old index 12 (5,5)\n\nIndex 14: old index 13 (5,4)\n\nIndex 15: old index 14 (6,4)\n\nIndex 16: old index 15 (6,3)\n\nIndex 17: old index 16 (6,2)\n\nIndex 18: old index 17 (6,1)\n\nIndex 19: old index 18 (5,1)\n\nIndex 20: old index 19 (4,1)  // old index 19 was (4,1), so new index 20 at (4,1)\n\nOld tail was index 20 at (3,1), which is removed.\n\nSo new tail is at (4,1)\n\nPreviously tail was (3,1), now it's at (4,1), so it moved.\n\nBut for now, at turn 82, I need to choose action.\n\nBack to choice: move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), I'm closer to the food at (4,2) and (4,3).\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2, (4,3) at x=4,y=3.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (4,2) or (3,3) or (3,1), etc.\n\n(3,2) to (4,2) is right, which might be possible, but there's a wall at (5,2)? (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall, so I cannot move to (5,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is not a wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is not wall.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach the food.\n\nAlso, life span: food at (4,3) has life span 7 at turn 82, so it will be there for 7 turns: turn 82 to 88, disappearing after turn 88 or on turn 89? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 82, life span 7, after turn 82, it decreases to 6, so at start of turn 83, life span 6, and so on. It can be eaten as long as life span >0. When life span is 1, it can be eaten on that turn, then it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2), life span 10, so longer.\n\nNow, from (2,2), if I move D to (2,1), then I go down, away from the food, which might not be good for eating soon.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThe snake is long, and the grid has walls, so I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAlso, there's a clump of snake body around (1,2) to (1,5) and (2,3) to (2,5), etc.\n\nLet me sketch the grid for y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=7: wall\n\ny=6: x=0 wall, x=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 wall? No, only borders are walls, so for y=6, only x=0 and x=7 are walls, internal are free.\n\nSimilarly, y=0, all x=0 to7 are walls? y=0 is bottom wall, so all (x,0) for x=0 to7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 all (x,7) walls.\n\nx=0 all (0,y) walls.\n\nx=7 all (7,y) walls.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nFree cells: from (1,1) to (6,6), except obstacles.\n\n(1,1): y=1, not y=0, so free, unless occupied.\n\nIn this case, (1,1) might be free.\n\nSnake occupies many cells.\n\nLet's list free cells or something.\n\nBut I don't need the whole grid, just the local area.\n\nHead at (2,2).\n\nFood at (4,2) and (4,3).\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, x=4.\n\n(4,3) at y=3, x=4.\n\nFrom (2,2), moving R to (3,2) gets me closer.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) next turn, to eat the food at (4,2), if I want.\n\n(4,2) has food, value +1.\n\nIf I move to (4,2) and eat it, then the snake grows, so when I eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from (3,2), moving to (4,2).\n\nBut after moving to (3,2) at turn 82, then at turn 83, I can move to (4,2).\n\nBut let's see the state after turn 82 move.\n\nFirst, for turn 82, I need to choose action.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (3,2)\n\nThen new head at (3,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen at turn 83, from (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,3) - is it free? Snake positions after turn 82 move.\n\nAfter move to (3,2) at turn 82:\n\nNew snake: head (3,2)\n\nBody: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nNow, from (3,2), possible moves turn 83:\n\n- U to (3,3): (3,3) not in new positions, not wall, so free? (3,3) is not listed, so free.\n\n- D to (3,1): (3,1) not in positions, not wall, but (3,1) was the old tail, but removed, so free.\n\n- L to (2,2): but (2,2) is now occupied by body segment, index 1, so moving there would collide.\n\n- R to (4,2): (4,2) is food position, not occupied by snake, not wall, so can move there to eat.\n\nAlso, direction from (3,2), previous head position was (2,2) to (3,2), so direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nR to (4,2) is possible to eat food.\n\nIf I eat at (4,2), then the snake grows, so when head moves to (4,2), it eats, so tail does not move, new segment added at head, so length increases by 1.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,2), then the body is the previous positions except tail is not removed.\n\nAfter eating, new head at food cell, and the body segments remain, so the new tail is the old tail, not removed.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,2) at turn 82, snake positions: as above, with tail at (4,1)\n\nAt turn 83, move R to (4,2), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew head at (4,2)\n\nThen body: the previous head (3,2) becomes new body, and all other segments stay, so new body includes (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), ..., up to (4,1), so length 22 now.\n\nTail still at (4,1), but since no move, it stays, and a new segment is added at head.\n\nStandard: when eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but no, in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is the old tail position, and the snake extends.\n\nPositions: after eating, the new head is at the food cell, and the body includes all previous positions, so the tail is the same as before, but since no removal, the snake grows.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: let's say [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail.\n\nMove to new cell F with food: new positions [F,A,B,C,D], so head F, tail D, length increased.\n\nIn this case, before turn 83 move, positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), (1,2), ..., (4,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2) and eating, new positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ..., (4,1) tail, so tail still (4,1), but the segment that was tail is now part of body, and tail is the same cell, but since it didn't move, it's still there, so positions include the new head and all old segments.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nThen new tail is the old tail position, but it doesn't move, so for next move, it will stay if not eaten, etc.\n\nBut back to the point.\n\nIf I go to (4,2) and eat, is there any danger?\n\nFood at (4,2) is positive, so ok.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nHere, when I eat at (4,2), where is the tail? Tail is at (4,1), which is directly below (4,2), so adjacent.\n\nHead at (4,2), tail at (4,1), so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf I eat the food at (4,2), and tail has food? The tail cell (4,1) has food? No, the food is at (4,2), which I'm eating, and tail is at (4,1), which may or may not have food.\n\nThe rule is: if head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has positive food, eating that food kills because after eating, the new tail grows and collides with head.\n\nBut in this case, I'm eating food at (4,2), not at the tail cell.\n\nThe tail cell is (4,1), which has no food, I think. Food is at (4,2) and (4,3), not at (4,1).\n\nSo (4,1) has no food, so no issue.\n\nWhen I eat at (4,2), head moves to (4,2), tail remains at (4,1), so they are adjacent, but that's fine, as long as I don't move into the tail or something.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,2), tail at (4,1), adjacent, but no problem, because the tail will move next turn if no eat.\n\nThe danger is only if I eat food that is on the tail cell when head is adjacent.\n\nRule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, tail cell is (4,1), no food, so no problem.\n\nSo I can eat at (4,2) safely.\n\nThen I get +1 score and grow.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,3), but let's proceed.\n\nAnother option: if I move D at turn 82 to (2,1), then I go down, to (2,1), which is empty.\n\nThen new head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nThen I can move to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot, or to (1,1), (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter move to (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to tail at (3,1)? Similar to before.\n\nBut going down might lead me away from food, so probably not optimal.\n\nMoreover, the food at (4,3) has only life span 7, so if I don't eat soon, it might disappear.\n\nTurn 82, life span 7, so after 7 turns, it will be gone. Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 82, countdown=7\n\nAfter turn 82, countdown=6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 88, countdown=0, disappears, so can be eaten until turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) has life span 10, until turn 91.\n\nSo (4,3) has shorter time.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to go for (4,3) or (4,2) soon.\n\nNow, from (2,2), if I move R to (3,2), then at turn 83, I can move to (4,2) to eat, or to (3,3) or (3,1).\n\n(3,3) might be a way to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is above (4,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (4,2) or to (3,3), then to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is food, so I can eat it directly.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 82, move R to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 83, I can move R to (4,2) to eat (4,2) food.\n\nBut (4,2) has longer life, (4,3) has shorter.\n\n(4,3) life 7, (4,2) life 10.\n\nSo (4,3) is more urgent.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (4,3) to eat.\n\n(3,3) should be free, as I thought earlier.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) at turn 82, positions as above, (3,3) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is food, not occupied.\n\nSo at turn 83, if I move U to (3,3), then at turn 84, I can move R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly but from (3,2) to (4,3) is not adjacent, diagonal, not possible, must move one step.\n\nSo to reach (4,3), I need to go via (3,3) or (4,2), but (4,2) is separate.\n\n(4,2) and (4,3) are adjacent vertically.\n\nNow, if I eat (4,3) first, since it has shorter life.\n\nAt turn 82, move R to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 83, move U to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 84, move R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nThen I get +1.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I can go for (4,2) if still there.\n\n(4,2) has life 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think about the area.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (5,2), so (4,2) is accessible, but moving east from (4,2) to (5,2) is blocked by wall, so I can only go north, south, or west from (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), I can go north to (4,4), south to (4,2), west to (3,3), east to (5,3), which is free, since obstacle only at (5,2).\n\n(5,3) is not wall, not obstacle.\n\nObstacle is only (5,2), so (5,3) is free.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 82, I think moving R to (3,2) is better to approach the food.\n\nMoving D to (2,1) might lead to dead end or something.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can go to (3,1) or (1,1), but (1,1) might be free, or (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) was tail, but after move, it might be occupied or not.\n\nIf I move D to (2,1) at turn 82:\n\nNew head (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to tail at (3,1)? After move, tail is at (4,1) or something.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (2,2), etc.\n\nAfter move D to (2,1):\n\nNew head: (2,1)\n\nBody: (2,2) [old head], (1,2) [old body1], (1,3) [old body2], ..., and tail: since no eat, old tail removed, so new tail is old index 19 at (4,1)\n\nPositions: new head (2,1), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves turn 83:\n\n- U to (2,2): but (2,2) is occupied by body, index 1, so collision.\n\n- D to (2,0): y=0, wall, cannot.\n\n- L to (1,1): (1,1) not occupied? Not in positions, not wall (y=1 not border, x=1 not border), so free.\n\n- R to (3,1): (3,1) not occupied? Not in positions, free.\n\nAlso, direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nSo possible: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nThen I can go to (1,1) or (3,1), but that area might be tight, with walls and body.\n\nFor example, (1,1) is corner, might be risky.\n\nWhereas going to (3,2) is more open.\n\nAlso, food is at (4,2) and (4,3), so going down might delay eating.\n\nTherefore, better to go right to (3,2).\n\nSo for turn 82, I think move R.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nLet’s plan the sequence.\n\nTurn 82: Move R to (3,2)\n\nThen, as above, at turn 83, I have choices.\n\nI can go to eat (4,3) since shorter life.\n\nAt turn 83, from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 84: from (3,3), move R to (4,3) to eat (4,3)\n\nNow, at turn 84, eat (4,3), so +1, length increases.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), body includes previous positions.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAfter turn 82 move to (3,2): positions as before.\n\nTurn 83: move U to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), direction U.\n\nThen body: since no eat, tail removed, new positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (3,3):\n\nNew head (3,3)\n\nThen:\n\n- Index 1: old head (3,2)\n\n- Index 2: old body1 (2,2)\n\n- Index 3: old body2 (1,2)\n\n- Index 4: old body3 (1,3)\n\n- Index 5: old body4 (2,3)\n\n- Index 6: old body5 (2,4)\n\n- Index 7: old body6 (1,4)\n\n- Index 8: old body7 (1,5)\n\n- Index 9: old body8 (2,5)\n\n- Index 10: old body9 (3,5)\n\n- Index 11: old body10 (4,5)\n\n- Index 12: old body11 (4,6)\n\n- Index 13: old body12 (5,6)\n\n- Index 14: old body13 (5,5)\n\n- Index 15: old body14 (5,4)\n\n- Index 16: old body15 (6,4)\n\n- Index 17: old body16 (6,3)\n\n- Index 18: old body17 (6,2)\n\n- Index 19: old body18 (6,1)\n\n- Index 20: old body19 (5,1)  // tail\n\nOld tail was (4,1), removed.\n\nNow tail at (5,1)\n\nNow at turn 84, move R to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) has food, so eat.\n\nNew head at (4,3)\n\nThen body: all previous positions, so (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and since eat, add new segment? When eat, head moves to food, and tail does not move, so the body includes the previous head and all segments.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), ..., up to (5,1) tail, so tail still at (5,1), but it's part of the body now, and since no removal, the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added, but in terms of positions, we add the new head and keep all old, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) ]\n\nSo 22 segments, tail at (5,1)\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction from (3,3) to (4,3), so R.\n\nNow, I can eat the other food at (4,2) if I want.\n\n(4,2) is directly below (4,3), and it has food.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) to eat it.\n\nBut is there tail danger?\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (5,1), not adjacent. (5,1) is down-right, not adjacent; adjacent would be (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is where the food is, but tail is at (5,1), so no issue.\n\nIf I move D to (4,2), I eat the food at (4,2), so +1, grow.\n\nThen head at (4,2), body includes (4,3), etc.\n\nAfter that, I need to move away.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can go U, D, L, R, but R to (5,2) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) might be occupied? In current positions after eating (4,3), positions include (5,1) tail, but (4,1) is not occupied? Let's see the list: positions have (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\nNo (4,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) might be free.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, not wall.\n\nSo from (4,2), after eating, I can move D to (4,1), or U to (4,3), but (4,3) is now body, occupied, collision if move there.\n\nL to (3,2), which is body, occupied.\n\nR to (5,2) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (4,3) occupied, no; D to (4,1) free; or since direction from (3,3) to (4,3) was R, then from (4,3) to (4,2) is D, which is not opposite to R? Directions: current head direction at (4,3) is R, since moved right from (3,3).\n\nMoving to (4,2) is down, which is not opposite to right; opposite would be left.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L, R, but R to (5,2) wall, U to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,2) occupied? (3,2) is in positions, index 2, so occupied.\n\nOnly D to (4,1) is free and possible.\n\nSo from (4,2), after eating, I must move D to (4,1) to avoid collision.\n\nThen that might be ok.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nFirst, back to turn 82.\n\nI think for turn 82, move R.\n\nThen for turn 83, I can choose to go to (3,3) to approach (4,3), or directly to (4,2) if I want.\n\nBut since (4,3) has shorter life, better to eat it first.\n\nAt turn 83, from (3,2), if I move to (4,2) to eat (4,2), then I get that food, but (4,3) might expire soon.\n\n(4,2) has longer life, so I can eat (4,3) first.\n\nTurn 82: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: move U to (3,3)  // to go towards (4,3)\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,3) and eat  // +1\n\nNow, after eating (4,3), head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nNow, I can consider eating (4,2) next.\n\nFrom (4,3), move D to (4,2) to eat (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) has food, so eat, +1.\n\nThen head at (4,2), and as before, only move possible is D to (4,1)\n\nBut after eating (4,2), when I move to (4,2), I eat, so new head at (4,2), body includes (4,3), (3,3), etc., tail at (5,1)\n\nThen from (4,2), I need to move, and only D to (4,1) is possible, as U, L, R blocked.\n\nMove D to (4,1)\n\nThen new head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen body: after move, since no eat, tail removed, so positions: head (4,1), body (4,2) [old head], (4,3) [old body1], (3,3) [old body2], ..., and tail: old tail was (5,1), but removed? After moving from (4,2) to (4,1), no eat, so tail removed.\n\nState after eating (4,2) at turn, say, 85? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn 82: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,3) eat (4,3)  // score +1\n\nNow at turn 85, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nMove D to (4,2) to eat (4,2)  // score +1, total +2 so far\n\nAfter eating (4,2), head at (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), ..., up to (5,1) tail.\n\nNow, at turn 86, from (4,2), I need to move.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): occupied by body\n\n- D to (4,1): free, not occupied\n\n- L to (3,2): occupied by body (index 3 in the list, (3,2))\n\n- R to (5,2): obstacle, wall\n\nDirection from (4,3) to (4,2) is D, so current direction D.\n\nCannot move U (opposite).\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,1), or L or R but L and R not possible, only D to (4,1) is valid.\n\nSo move D to (4,1)\n\nThen no eat, so new head (4,1), body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)  // tail? Let's see: after moving to (4,1), new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2) [old head], (4,3) [old body1], (3,3) [old body2], (3,2) [old body3], (2,2) [old body4], (1,2) [old body5], (1,3) [old body6], (2,3) [old body7], (2,4) [old body8], (1,4) [old body9], (1,5) [old body10], (2,5) [old body11], (3,5) [old body12], (4,5) [old body13], (4,6) [old body14], (5,6) [old body15], (5,5) [old body16], (5,4) [old body17], (6,4) [old body18], (6,3) [old body19], (6,2) [old body20]  // since no eat, tail removed, so new tail is (6,2)\n\nOld tail was (6,1)? After eating (4,2), positions included (6,1), but when we moved to (4,1) without eating, the tail (6,1) is removed.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)  // 22 segments, tail (6,1)\n\nWhen move to (4,1) at turn 86, no eat, so new head (4,1), body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (6,2), and tail removed, so new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)  // 21 segments, tail (6,2)\n\nNow head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen I can move, for example, L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), etc.\n\n(3,1) not occupied, (5,1) not occupied, but (5,1) might be near wall.\n\nBut I have eaten both foods, so score +2, and now I need to survive.\n\nBut I need to think longer term.\n\nIn this plan, I ate both foods, but I ended up at (4,1), which might be ok.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nAt turn 83, after moving to (3,2), I could move directly to (4,2) to eat (4,2) first, but then (4,3) might be missed if not eaten soon.\n\nBut (4,3) life span 7, at turn 82, so if I eat (4,2) at turn 83, (4,3) still has life span decreasing, but I can eat it later.\n\nTurn 82: life span (4,3) =7\n\nAfter turn 82, decreases to 6\n\nTurn 83: if I eat (4,2), then at turn 84, (4,3) life span 5, still there.\n\nFrom (4,2), after eating at turn 83, I can move to (4,3) to eat if possible.\n\nAfter eating (4,2) at turn 83.\n\nTurn 82: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 83: move R to (4,2) eat (4,2)  // +1\n\nNew head (4,2), body: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail?

No, free.\n\nMove U to (4,3)\n\nBut direction: from (3,2) to (4,2) was R, so current direction R.\n\nMoving to (4,3) is U, which is not opposite, so possible.\n\nMove U to (4,3) and eat, +1.\n\nThen head at (4,3), body includes (4,2), etc.\n\nThen from there, I need to move, similar to before.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), head at (4,3), I can move, say, to (4,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut in this case, I ate both foods quickly.\n\nThen I can go north or something.\n\nBut in the first plan, I also ate both.\n\nNow, the difference is in the first plan, I ate (4,3) first at turn 84, then (4,2) at turn 85, moving to (4,1) at turn 86.\n\nIn second, eat (4,2) at turn 83, then (4,3) at turn 84.\n\nBoth possible.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I ate (4,3) then (4,2), I had to move down to (4,1), which might be fine.\n\nI should consider the tail danger or other risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,2) and (4,3) are both positive, no issue.\n\nBut long-term, after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to find space.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can go left or right, but right to (5,1) might be possible.\n\n(5,1) is not wall, not obstacle, obstacle is (5,2).\n\n(5,1) is free, I think.\n\nIn positions, after moving to (4,1), positions include (6,2) etc., but (5,1) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) free.\n\nSo I can explore.\n\nBut since I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 82 to 86 or 87.\n\nIn the sequence, let's define one.\n\nAlso, I should avoid risks.\n\nAnother point: in the initial position, when I move to (3,2), is there any immediate risk?\n\n(3,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) should be safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nFor example, after turn 82 move to (3,2), the cell (3,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is food, free.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 82.\n\nI think moving R at turn 82 is best.\n\nThen for turn 83, I can move U to go towards (4,3).\n\nThen turn 84 move R to eat (4,3).\n\nThen for turn 85, from (4,3), I can move D to eat (4,2), since it's there.\n\nBut (4,2) has longer life, I don't have to eat immediately, but it's adjacent, so I can eat it.\n\nThen turn 86 move D to (4,1).\n\nThen I need more turns.\n\nBut the food might be gone or something, but both eaten.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (4,2) immediately, but since it's there, why not.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (4,3), I can go east to (5,3) instead of down to (4,2), to explore more space.\n\nBut (4,2) is food, so eating it gives score, so better to eat if possible.\n\nUnless there is risk.\n\nBut no risk apparent.\n\nSo I think eating both is fine.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nThen turn 83: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 84: R (to (4,3) eat)\n\nNow at turn 85, head at (4,3), direction R (from (3,3) to (4,3))\n\nMove D to (4,2) to eat (4,2)\n\nTurn 85: D (to (4,2) eat)\n\nThen turn 86: from (4,2), only possible move D to (4,1), as above.\n\nTurn 86: D (to (4,1))\n\nNow, for turn 87, from (4,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: from (4,1)\n\n- U to (4,2): but (4,2) is now body, occupied, after moving to (4,1), the position (4,2) is body, so cannot move there.\n\n- D to (4,0): y=0, wall, cannot.\n\n- L to (3,1): not occupied, free.\n\n- R to (5,1): not occupied, free.\n\nAlso, direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nSo possible: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nNow, (3,1) or (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is near the obstacle at (5,2), but (5,1) is free.\n\n(3,1) might be near the body.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) at turn 86, positions: as earlier, head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) tail.\n\nSo (3,1) not occupied, free.\n\n(5,1) not occupied, free.\n\nI can go to (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nIf go to (3,1), then I might be going left, where there is body.\n\nIf go to (5,1), then I can go up to (5,2) but wall, so only to (5,0) wall, or (4,1) occupied, or (6,1), but (6,1) might be occupied? In positions, (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) not, but (6,1) was occupied earlier, but after moves, not now.\n\nIn current positions, (6,2) is tail, (6,3), (6,4), etc., no (6,1), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) to (6,1) is possible.\n\nBut y=1, so (6,1) is not wall? y=1, not y=0, so free.\n\nx=6, not x=7, so not wall.\n\nSo from (4,1), I can move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nPerhaps R to (5,1) to go to the right side.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,1) or (5,2) but (5,2) wall, or (5,0) wall, so only to (6,1) or back, but back to (4,1) occupied.\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2) wall, D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1) occupied, R to (6,1) free.\n\nSo only R to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), etc.\n\nBut I think for now, since I need only a few turns, I can output up to turn 86 or so.\n\nBut the answer should include actions for turn 82 to, say, 86 or 87.\n\nSince I planned to turn 86, I can add one more.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: R (eat (4,3))\n\nTurn 85: D (to (4,2) eat (4,2))\n\nTurn 86: D (to (4,1))\n\nNow for turn 87, from (4,1), I need to move, say to (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nTo avoid the left side where there might be body, go right to (5,1).\n\nSo turn 87: R to (5,1)\n\nThen direction from (4,1) to (5,1) is R.\n\nThen I can continue, but not necessary.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\nFood (4,3) life span 7 at turn 82, so at turn 84, after two turns, life span decreased by 2, to 5, still there.\n\nSimilarly, eaten at turn 84.\n\n(4,2) life span 10 at turn 82, at turn 85, decreased by 3, to 7, eaten.\n\nBoth eaten before expire.\n\nNow, output actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 84, I move R to (4,3) and eat, but the action is just the move, eating is consequence.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: D\n}\n\nI have 5 actions: turn 82 to 86.\n\nTurn 86 is D to (4,1).\n\nI could add turn 87, but 5 turns are enough.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the sequence, I have turns 82 to 86.\n\nBut turn 86 is the 5th action.\n\nt_1=82, so turn 82,83,84,85,86 for 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should include eating the food efficiently.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (3,3) at turn 83, is there food? No, food at (4,2) and (4,3), not at (3,3).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan multiple turns ahead, prioritizing eating the positive food at (4,3) due to its shorter life span (7 turns remaining at turn 82) before targeting the food at (4,2) with a longer life span (10 turns). The snake starts at (2,2) with direction right (R). The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2), which blocks movement.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Priority**: The food at (4,3) must be eaten soon as it disappears after turn 88 (countdown decreases each turn, including turn 82). The food at (4,2) can be eaten later but should be consumed to maximize score.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - From (2,2), only down (D) or right (R) are possible (up leads to body collision at (2,3); left is opposite direction and invalid).\n  - After moving right to (3,2) at turn 82, the snake can then move up (U) to (3,3) to approach (4,3).\n  - Eating (4,3) at turn 84 is safe, as the tail is not adjacent, and no immediate collision risks.\n  - After eating (4,3), moving down (D) to (4,2) at turn 85 eats the second food, with no tail danger (tail at (5,1) is not adjacent).\n- **Risks Avoided**:\n  - Moving down from (2,2) at turn 82 is avoided, as it leads away from the food and into a potential dead end near the bottom wall.\n  - After eating (4,2) at turn 85, moving down to (4,1) at turn 86 is the only safe move (other directions are blocked by body or walls).\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,2) is respected, preventing movement east from (4,2).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 86, the snake is at (4,1) with options to move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1) for exploration. Moving right to (5,1) at turn 87 is recommended to access more open space on the right, avoiding the body-dense left area.\n\n### Planned Sequence (5 Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 82**: Move right (R) to (3,2). This approaches the food and avoids the risky down move. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 83**: Move up (U) to (3,3). This positions the snake to reach (4,3) next turn. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 84**: Move right (R) to (4,3) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases). The food at (4,3) is eaten with life span 5 remaining (safe). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 85**: Move down (D) to (4,2) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases). The food at (4,2) is eaten with life span 7 remaining (safe). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 86**: Move down (D) to (4,1). This is the only safe move (up, left, and right are blocked; down avoids collision).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 83, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7. That means the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but the walls are at the borders, so snake can only be in cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Let me check the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). That's 21 segments. Let me count: positions from (3,2) to (4,1) – that's 21 points, yes.\n\nAll these coordinates are between 1 and 6 for both x and y, except (6,1) and (5,1) etc., which are fine since walls are at 0 and 7, so cells from 1 to 6 are playable. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are valid.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,2). So that cell is blocked.\n\nHead direction: R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,2) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid to understand where everything is.\n\nGrid size: rows y from 1 to 6, columns x from 1 to 6. I'll sketch this.\n\nLet me list the snake body positions to see where it is.\n\nHead: (3,2)\n\nThen body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nTail is at (4,1)\n\nNow, food at (4,3) and (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) is a food position, but is it occupied by the snake?\n\nLook at snake positions: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), etc. (4,2) is not in the snake positions? Snake has (6,2), (6,3), etc., but not (4,2). Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom positions: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo cells occupied: let's sort by x and y.\n\nx=1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nx=2: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nx=3: (3,2), (3,5)\n\nx=4: (4,5), (4,6), (4,1)  // (4,1) is tail\n\nx=5: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,1)\n\nx=6: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nNow food at (4,3) and (4,2)\n\n(4,3): is it occupied? Not in the list above, so free.\n\n(4,2): not in list, so free.\n\nBut (4,2) has food, and it's not occupied now.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), which is wall.\n\nHead is at (3,2) moving right, so direction R.\n\nFrom (3,2), moving right would go to (4,2), but (4,2) has food! But let's see if I can eat it.\n\n(4,2) is a food position, and it's not currently occupied by snake body? Snake body: at (3,2) is head, (2,2) is next, etc. (4,2) is free, so if I move right to (4,2), I can eat the food there, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut there's a rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\"\n\nIn this case, (4,2) is not under snake body; it's free, so I can eat it by moving to it.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3).\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction R, so possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nBut no instant reverse: since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see the surroundings of head (3,2):\n\n- Right: (4,2) - has food? Yes, (4,2) has food with value 1.\n\n- Up: (3,3) - what is here? Not in snake positions, and no wall, so free.\n\n- Down: (3,1) - y=1, is it wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable. Is it occupied? Snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not (3,1), so (3,1) should be free, I think. Snake positions: (3,2) and (4,1) etc., no (3,1), so free.\n\n- Left: (2,2) - but that's the body segment, but since we can move into tail if it moves, but let's see.\n\n(2,2) is the second segment, so if I move left to (2,2), that would be a body collision, because (2,2) is occupied and not the tail that will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for (2,2): it is not the tail; tail is at (4,1). So (2,2) is a body segment, so moving to (2,2) would cause collision and death.\n\nSimilarly, all other body segments except tail are dangerous.\n\nNow, tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to head.\n\nSo from (3,2):\n\n- Move R to (4,2): which has food, so I can eat it.\n\n- Move U to (3,3): free cell\n\n- Move D to (3,1): free cell\n\n- Move L to (2,2): body collision, death, not allowed.\n\nSo possible safe moves: R, U, D.\n\nNow, if I move R to (4,2), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, new head at (4,2), and body adds one segment.\n\nNormally, when snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nHere, if I eat at (4,2), head moves to (4,2), and since food eaten, tail (4,1) remains, and the segment that was at (4,1) is now part of body, new position added.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's another food at (4,3).\n\nBut (4,2) has life span 9, (4,3) has life span 6. Since current turn 83, so (4,3) disappears after turn 83 + 6 - 1? Let's see life span.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (4,3), life_span=6, so it will disappear after 6 turns from now, meaning it is available on turns 83,84,85,86,87,88? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife_span N means it disappears after N turns, so if it appears at turn T, it lasts from turn T to turn T + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, life_span is given, say L, then at turn t, countdown is L, next turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., when countdown reaches 0, it disappears, so it is available for L turns: from t to t+L-1.\n\nFor example, at turn 83, life_span=6 for (4,3), so countdown starts at 6, decreases each turn, so it will be gone after turn 88? After 6 turns, meaning turn 83: count=6, turn 84: count=5, ..., turn 88: count=1, turn 89: count=0 and disappears. So available until turn 88 inclusive? Countdown to 0 at turn 83 + L.\n\nLife_span N, at turn t, countdown N. After one turn, t+1, countdown N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown 1, then at turn t + N, countdown 0 and disappears. So the food is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor (4,3): life_span 6 at turn 83, so available from 83 to 83+6-1=88, so turns 83,84,85,86,87,88.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2): life_span 9, available from 83 to 83+9-1=91, turns 83 to 91.\n\nNow, back to immediate move.\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), I eat the food, get +1, length increases.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,1), head at (3,2). Are they adjacent? (4,1) and (3,2) are diagonally adjacent? Adjacency means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (3,2) and (4,1) are not adjacent; they share a corner but not a side. Distance: |dx| + |dy| = 1 + 1 = 2, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n\nSo (3,2) and (4,1) are not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, no tail reward danger here.\n\nSo moving to (4,2) should be safe and I get the food.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: new head at (4,2), and tail remains at (4,1), but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head to (4,2), then the body: the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (4,2)? No.\n\nWhen snake moves: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nIf food eaten, tail is not removed, so a new segment is added at the tail end? No.\n\nStandard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, the body follows, but tail stays in place, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: suppose before move, snake: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nAfter moving to a cell with food: new head at new position, then B1 moves to where H was, B2 to where B1 was, ..., and T stays, so new positions: new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nIn this case, head was at (3,2), moving to (4,2).\n\nCurrent positions: [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (4,1)]\n\nAfter moving right to (4,2) and eating food:\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nThen the segment that was head is now body at (3,2)\n\nThen (2,2) moves to where (3,2) was? No: the body segments shift: the first body segment (2,2) moves to the previous head position (3,2), then (1,2) moves to (2,2), and so on, down to the tail.\n\nSince food eaten, the tail (4,1) does not move, so it stays, and we add a new segment? No, when food eaten, the tail doesn't advance, so the position that was tail remains, and the snake grows by one segment.\n\nAfter move: head at new position (4,2), then the previous head (3,2) becomes the first body segment, so (4,2) is head, then (3,2) is next, then (2,2) is next, and so on, up to the tail (4,1). Since food eaten, (4,1) remains as tail, so the segment that was tail stays, and we have one more segment.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (3,2), 1: (2,2), 2: (1,2), 3: (1,3), ..., 19: (5,1), 20: (4,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2) and eating food:\n\nNew head at (4,2)\n\nThen the new body segments: position 1: previous head (3,2)\n\nPosition 2: previous position 1 (2,2)\n\nPosition 3: previous position 2 (1,2)\n\n...\n\nPosition 20: previous position 19 (5,1)? Let's see.\n\nThe body segments from 1 to 20: segment i moves to where segment i-1 was, but segment 0 was head.\n\nAfter move, the new body segment 1 is at the previous head position (3,2)\n\nNew body segment 2 is at previous body segment 1 position (2,2)\n\nNew body segment 3 at previous body segment 2 (1,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment 20 at previous body segment 19 position.\n\nPrevious body segment 19 is (5,1) (since positions: index 19 is (5,1), index 20 is (4,1))\n\nList indices:\n\n0: (3,2) head\n\n1: (2,2)\n\n2: (1,2)\n\n3: (1,3)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\n5: (2,4)\n\n6: (1,4)\n\n7: (1,5)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (3,5)\n\n10: (4,5)\n\n11: (4,6)\n\n12: (5,6)\n\n13: (5,5)\n\n14: (5,4)\n\n15: (6,4)\n\n16: (6,3)\n\n17: (6,2)\n\n18: (6,1)\n\n19: (5,1)\n\n20: (4,1) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2) with food eaten:\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nThen new body:\n\nSegment 1: previous head position (3,2)\n\nSegment 2: previous segment 1 position (2,2)\n\nSegment 3: previous segment 2 position (1,2)\n\nSegment 4: previous segment 3 position (1,3)\n\n...\n\nSegment 20: previous segment 19 position (5,1)\n\nAnd since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so we add a new segment at the previous tail position? No, when food eaten, the tail stays in place, so the previous tail position becomes the new last body segment, and the tail remains there for this move, but since we add a segment, the new tail is the previous second last? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard: when food is eaten, the snake moves forward, head to new position, each body segment to the next position, but the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and the length increases by one. So the new positions include the old tail position as a new body segment.\n\nAfter move: new head at (4,2)\n\nThen the first body segment is at (3,2) (old head)\n\nSecond body segment at (2,2) (old body1)\n\n...\n\nThe 20th body segment at (5,1) (old body19)\n\nAnd the 21st body segment (new) at (4,1) (old tail)\n\nThen tail is at (4,1)\n\nSo new snake: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nNow, head direction: since I moved right to (4,2), new direction is R.\n\nBut now, (4,2) has food, which I just ate, so it should be removed, but in the state, food is at (4,2) and (4,3), so after eating (4,2), that food is gone.\n\nNow, there is also food at (4,3), which is above (4,2).\n\nCurrent head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since I just moved R, I cannot move L (left) to (3,2), because that would be opposite direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U (up to (4,3)), D (down to (4,1)), R (right to (5,2))\n\nNow, (4,3) has food, (4,1) is the tail, and (5,2) is what?\n\n(5,2): is it wall? Internal obstacle at (5,2), yes, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is tail, so moving to (4,1) might be safe if it's the tail, but let's see.\n\nFirst, (4,3): if I move U to (4,3), I can eat the food there, since it's free.\n\n(4,1): if I move D to (4,1), which is the tail. Since the tail will move, it might be safe, but after I eat, the tail doesn't move, so it could be dangerous.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut if I eat food, the tail does not move, so if I move to the tail position and eat food, it might cause a problem.\n\nSpecifically, for (4,1): it is the tail. If I move to (4,1), and if I eat food, but (4,1) has food? In this case, (4,1) is a snake position, not a food position. Food is at (4,3) and (4,2), but (4,2) is now head, so (4,1) is just body, no food there.\n\nFood positions are separate. (4,3) has food, (4,2) had food but I just ate it, so it's gone.\n\nSo (4,1) is snake tail, no food on it.\n\nIf I move to (4,1), since it is the tail, and I move onto it, but I'm not eating food (since no food there), so the snake would move: head to (4,1), which was tail, so the tail moves away, and since no food, tail is removed.\n\nBut moving to tail position when no food is generally safe because the tail vacates the cell.\n\nHowever, in this case, after I moved to (4,2), the tail is at (4,1). If I then move down to (4,1), head to (4,1), which is where tail was, so the body segments move, and tail is removed since no food.\n\nNew head at (4,1), then body segments shift, so the segment that was at (4,2) moves to (4,1)? Let's not digress.\n\nBut in this subpath, after eating at (4,2), head at (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) to eat food, or D to (4,1), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) is wall, so impossible.\n\nSo only U and D are possible.\n\nU to (4,3) has food, D to (4,1) is tail.\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), and no food there, so it should be safe: head moves to (4,1), tail was there but moves away to the previous segment.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nAfter first move to (4,2), snake: head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), ..., (5,1), (4,1)\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), new head at (4,1), and since no food, the tail is removed. The tail was at (4,1), but it moves to where the previous tail segment was? The last body segment moves to the second last position.\n\nNew head at (4,1)\n\nNew body segment 1: previous head (4,2)\n\nNew body segment 2: previous body1 (3,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment 20: previous body19 (5,1)  // since there were 21 segments, after moving with no food, tail removed, so 20 segments.\n\nPrevious body19 is (5,1), which was the second last.\n\nAfter move, new positions: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,1), (5,1)  // (5,1) is now the tail.\n\nAnd (4,1) was tail, but now head is there, and tail is at (5,1).\n\nNo collision, since the tail moved.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (4,1) is safe, but I don't get food.\n\nWhereas moving U to (4,3) I get food at (4,3).\n\nBut let's go back to the first decision point.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), I eat food, grow, head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 84, I can move U to (4,3) to eat another food, or D to (4,1), or other.\n\nBut (4,3) has food with life span 6, available until turn 88, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut if I move U to (4,3) at turn 84, I eat it immediately.\n\nThen after that, head at (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut I need to think about other options at turn 83.\n\nInstead of moving R, I could move U or D.\n\nMove U to (3,3): free cell, no food.\n\nMove D to (3,1): free cell, no food.\n\nThen I don't eat the food at (4,2) immediately.\n\nBut (4,2) has life span 9, so it will be there for a while.\n\nHowever, if I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but let's see the risks.\n\nAlso, there is the internal wall at (5,2), which is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nNow, let's think about the board state.\n\nI should consider the map with snake, food, walls.\n\nDraw a grid.\n\nRows y from 1 to 6, bottom to top? Usually y increases up, but in coordinates, let's assume y=1 bottom, y=6 top, or? In the positions, (1,5) is there, etc., but I think for simplicity, let's list cells.\n\nMake a 6x6 grid, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nCell (x,y):\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are out of bound, but we have internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nList all occupied cells at turn 83:\n\n(3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo:\n\ny=6: (4,6), (5,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\ny=4: (2,4), (1,4), (5,4), (6,4)  // (2,4) and (1,4)\n\nFrom list: (2,4), (1,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nAlso (2,4) at y=4.\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (6,3)  // and (4,3) has food, not occupied\n\ny=2: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (6,2)\n\ny=1: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nAlso (3,1) is free, etc.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), moving right.\n\nIf I move right to (4,2), eat food.\n\nBut (4,2) is free, so I can eat.\n\nAfter eating, as above, head at (4,2), and snake longer.\n\nThen from there, I can move up to (4,3) to eat the other food.\n\n(4,3) is available.\n\nIf I do that, at turn 84, move U to (4,3), eat food, then head at (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut after eating both, I have two more segments.\n\nBut let's see what happens after that.\n\nFrom (4,3), after eating, head at (4,3), direction U if I moved up.\n\nThen possible moves: from (4,3), I can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nBut no instant reverse: if I moved U to (4,3), direction is U, so I cannot move D down immediately.\n\nSo possible: U, L, R.\n\nNow, what is around:\n\n(4,4): is it free? Snake positions: not listed, so free.\n\n(3,3): free, not occupied.\n\n(5,3): what is it? Not occupied, but (5,2) is wall, so (5,3) should be free.\n\n(5,3) not in snake or wall, so free.\n\nD to (4,2): but (4,2) is now a body segment after I moved, so if I move down to (4,2), it would be body collision, since it's not tail.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), let's not get too detailed.\n\nI should consider not eating both foods immediately to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nThere might be a risk with the tail.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is quite long, 21 segments, on a 6x6 grid, which has 36 cells, so 21 occupied, 15 free, but with walls and food, so many cells are occupied.\n\nFree cells: total cells 6x6=36, walls: border not counted, but internal wall at (5,2), so one wall cell.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (4,3), but they are not occupied, so free cells include them.\n\nOccupied by snake: 21 cells.\n\nWall: 1 cell (5,2)\n\nFood: 2 cells, but they are free to move to, just have food.\n\nSo free cells: 36 - 21 - 1 = 14, plus the food cells are free but have food, so 14 free cells including the two food cells? 36 total cells, minus snake 21, minus wall 1, so 14 cells are empty, which include (4,2), (4,3), and others.\n\nFor example, (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6)? (3,6) not in snake, so free.\n\nList free cells.\n\nCells not occupied and not wall: x1-6, y1-6 except (5,2) wall.\n\nSnake occupied: as above.\n\nSo all possible cells: for each (x,y)\n\n(1,1): not occupied, not wall, free\n\n(1,2): occupied\n\n(1,3): occupied\n\n(1,4): occupied\n\n(1,5): occupied\n\n(1,6): not occupied, free\n\n(2,1): not occupied, free? Not in list, so free\n\n(2,2): occupied\n\n(2,3): occupied\n\n(2,4): occupied\n\n(2,5): occupied\n\n(2,6): not occupied, free\n\n(3,1): not occupied, free\n\n(3,2): occupied\n\n(3,3): not occupied, free\n\n(3,4): not occupied, free? Not in snake positions, so free\n\n(3,5): occupied\n\n(3,6): not occupied, free\n\n(4,1): occupied\n\n(4,2): food, not occupied, free\n\n(4,3): food, not occupied, free\n\n(4,4): not occupied, free?

Not in list, so free\n\n(6,6): not occupied, free\n\nSo free cells: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nAnd food at (4,2) and (4,3).\n\nAlso (4,4) free, etc.\n\nNow, the snake head at (3,2), which is surrounded.\n\nBack to moves at turn 83.\n\nOption 1: move R to (4,2) - eat food, head to (4,2), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 84, from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) to eat food, or D to (4,1), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, impossible. So only U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), eat food, head to (4,3), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 85, from (4,3), direction U, so can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3). Cannot move D (down).\n\n(4,4) is free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf I move to (4,4), for example, no food, so just move.\n\nThen head at (4,4), etc.\n\nBut after eating both foods, the snake is longer, 23 segments, and the board is more crowded.\n\nFree cells decrease.\n\nWith 23 segments, 36-23-1=12 free cells, but some are occupied by snake.\n\nTotal free cells now 14, after eating two foods, snake grows by 2, so 21+2=23 segments, wall 1, so free cells 36-23-1=12, including the ones that were free.\n\nBut after eating, the food cells are gone, so new free cells.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother option at turn 83: instead of moving R, I could move U to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free, no food.\n\nSo move U to (3,3), then head at (3,3), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nThen at turn 84, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\nNo instant reverse, direction U, so cannot move D down.\n\nSo possible: U, L, R.\n\n(3,4) is free, (2,3) is body? (2,3) is occupied, it's a body segment, so moving to (2,3) would be collision.\n\n(4,3) has food, free.\n\nSo safe moves: U to (3,4) or R to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nCannot move L to (2,3) because body.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), eat food, head to (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nSimilarly, I could move D at turn 83 to (3,1).\n\nMove D to (3,1), free, no food, head to (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen at turn 84, from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, collision; D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, impossible; L to (2,1), free; R to (4,1), which is tail, so possible.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U up immediately.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,1), or R to (4,1), or D down but wall.\n\nD to (3,0) invalid.\n\nSo L or R.\n\n(2,1) is free, (4,1) is tail.\n\nMoving to (4,1) is safe since it's tail.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nNow, the key point is that (4,2) has food with longer life span, but if I don't eat it now, I can eat it later.\n\nBut there is a risk: if I move away, and the snake body moves, (4,2) might be covered or something.\n\nBut (4,2) is not under snake now, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let's think about the tail position.\n\nTail is at (4,1), and food at (4,2) is adjacent to tail.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (4,1), food is at (4,2), not on tail.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut if I move such that head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but tail at (4,1) has no food.\n\nFood is at (4,2) and (4,3), not on tail.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both foods, but with long snake, I need to find a path to survive.\n\nAfter eating both foods at (4,2) and (4,3), head at (4,3), I can move to (4,4), then to (3,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the area around.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), after eating, move U to (4,4).\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen I can move U to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied? Snake has (4,5) occupied.\n\nCurrent snake after eating at (4,3): let's not.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating both immediately to have more space.\n\nSince (4,3) has shorter life span, only until turn 88, and (4,2) longer, I should eat (4,3) first if possible, but at (3,2), I can't directly eat (4,3) in one move; it's not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,2), (4,3) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nSo I can't reach (4,3) in one move from (3,2).\n\nOptions are only (4,2), (3,3), (3,1).\n\nSo to eat (4,3), I need to go via (4,2) or (3,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) is not adjacent.\n\nSo the quickest way to eat (4,3) is to go to (4,2) or (3,3) first.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (4,3) directly.\n\nSimilarly from (4,2).\n\nNow, let's think about the future turns.\n\nI need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the tail will move, creating space.\n\nFor example, tail is at (4,1), and as the snake moves, the tail will move, freeing up cells.\n\nBut when I eat food, tail doesn't move.\n\nTo have more space, I should not eat food immediately, so that tail moves and frees cells.\n\nBut there is food to eat, so I need to balance.\n\nSince both foods are positive, I should eat them, but carefully.\n\nLet's consider moving to (3,3) at turn 83.\n\nMove U to (3,3), no food, head to (3,3), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 84, from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) or R to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), eat food, head to (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 85, from (4,3), direction R, so can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nNo instant reverse, so cannot move L to (3,3) because that would be left, opposite to right direction.\n\nDirection is R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U, D, R.\n\n(4,4) free, (4,2) has food? (4,2) has food, but is it free? At this point, at turn 84, I ate (4,3), but (4,2) is still there.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) at turn 84, food at (4,3) is eaten, so gone.\n\n(4,2) food is still there.\n\nFrom (4,3), move to (4,2): D down, which is possible, but direction is R now, moving down is not reverse, reverse would be left or right opposite, but down is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R; instant reverse means opposite direction, so from current direction, if moving right, reverse is left; if up, reverse is down, etc.\n\nSo from (4,3) direction R, moving D down is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly, U up or R right.\n\nSo I can move D to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nThen I eat both foods in two turns.\n\nMove U to (4,4) or other.\n\nBut if I move D to (4,2), at turn 85, from (4,3) to (4,2), eat food, head to (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut let's see the position after that.\n\nAfter eating both, head at (4,2), for example.\n\nThen I need to move away.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) but (4,3) is where I came from, and it might be body now.\n\nAfter sequence:\n\nTurn 83: move U to (3,3)  // no food\n\nSnake: head to (3,3), body: previous head (3,2) becomes body, so positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (4,1) tail. Since no food, tail at (4,1) is removed, so new tail at (5,1) or something.\n\nBefore move, snake positions at turn 83.\n\nAfter move U to (3,3), no food eaten, so head to (3,3), each body segment moves to previous position, tail removed.\n\nSo new head (3,3)\n\nBody: (3,2)  // previous head\n\n(2,2)  // previous body1\n\n(1,2)  // previous body2\n\n(1,3)  // previous body3\n\n(2,3)  // previous body4\n\n(2,4)  // previous body5\n\n(1,4)  // previous body6\n\n(1,5)  // previous body7\n\n(2,5)  // previous body8\n\n(3,5)  // previous body9\n\n(4,5)  // previous body10\n\n(4,6)  // previous body11\n\n(5,6)  // previous body12\n\n(5,5)  // previous body13\n\n(5,4)  // previous body14\n\n(6,4)  // previous body15\n\n(6,3)  // previous body16\n\n(6,2)  // previous body17\n\n(6,1)  // previous body18\n\n(5,1)  // previous body19\n\nPrevious body19 was (5,1), and body20 was (4,1), but since no food, tail removed, so the new body segments are up to previous body19.\n\nPrevious indices: 0 head (3,2), 1 (2,2), ..., 19 (5,1), 20 (4,1)\n\nAfter move no food: new head at (3,3)\n\nNew body1 at previous head (3,2)\n\nNew body2 at previous body1 (2,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body19 at previous body18 (6,1)? Let's find.\n\nPrevious body18: from list, index 18 is (6,1)\n\nIndex 17 (6,2), 18 (6,1), 19 (5,1), 20 (4,1)\n\nAfter move, new body1: previous head (3,2)\n\nNew body2: previous body1 (2,2)\n\nNew body3: previous body2 (1,2)\n\nNew body4: previous body3 (1,3)\n\nNew body5: previous body4 (2,3)\n\nNew body6: previous body5 (2,4)\n\nNew body7: previous body6 (1,4)\n\nNew body8: previous body7 (1,5)\n\nNew body9: previous body8 (2,5)\n\nNew body10: previous body9 (3,5)\n\nNew body11: previous body10 (4,5)\n\nNew body12: previous body11 (4,6)\n\nNew body13: previous body12 (5,6)\n\nNew body14: previous body13 (5,5)\n\nNew body15: previous body14 (5,4)\n\nNew body16: previous body15 (6,4)\n\nNew body17: previous body16 (6,3)\n\nNew body18: previous body17 (6,2)\n\nNew body19: previous body18 (6,1)\n\nThen tail at new body19 position (6,1), since no body20.\n\nPrevious body19 (5,1) is not included because tail removed, so new snake has 20 segments: head (3,3) and body down to (6,1)\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nFood at (4,2) and (4,3) still there.\n\nAt turn 84, from head (3,3), move R to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nEat (4,3), so food eaten, head to (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen since food eaten, tail does not move, so new head (4,3), body: previous head (3,3), then previous body1 (3,2), previous body2 (2,2), ..., up to previous body19 (6,1), and new segment at previous tail position, but previous tail was at (6,1), which is now body, and new tail at (6,1)? Messy.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (3,3), body1 (3,2), body2 (2,2), ..., body19 (6,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) with food eaten: new head (4,3)\n\nNew body1: previous head (3,3)\n\nNew body2: previous body1 (3,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body20: previous body19 (6,1)\n\nAnd since food eaten, the previous tail position is not vacated, so new body21 at previous tail position, but previous tail was body19 at (6,1), which is now new body20, so we add a new segment at that position? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the tail stays, so the position that was tail remains occupied, and the snake grows.\n\nSo new positions: new head at (4,3)\n\nThen new body1 at previous head (3,3)\n\nNew body2 at previous body1 (3,2)\n\nNew body3 at previous body2 (2,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body20 at previous body19 (6,1)  // previous body19 was tail, so it remains as body\n\nThen new body21 at the previous tail position, but it's the same as new body20, so no, the tail position is not moved from, so it stays, and we have one more segment at the end.\n\nAfter move, the new tail is at the position that was tail before.\n\nBefore move, tail at (6,1)\n\nAfter move, new head (4,3), new body1 (3,3), ..., new body20 (6,1), and since food eaten, new body21 at (6,1)? No.\n\nThe body segments are shifted, and because food eaten, the last position is not removed, so the new list has the old positions shifted, with the old tail position still occupied.\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew body1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (3,2)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (2,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body19: old body18 (6,2)  // let's find old body18\n\nOld body18 was (6,2)? From above, new body positions after turn 83 move: head (3,3), body1 (3,2), body2 (2,2), body3 (1,2), body4 (1,3), body5 (2,3), body6 (2,4), body7 (1,4), body8 (1,5), body9 (2,5), body10 (3,5), body11 (4,5), body12 (4,6), body13 (5,6), body14 (5,5), body15 (5,4), body16 (6,4), body17 (6,3), body18 (6,2), body19 (6,1) tail.\n\nAt turn 84, move to (4,3), eat food.\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew body1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (3,2)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (2,2)\n\nNew body4: old body3 (1,2)\n\nNew body5: old body4 (1,3)\n\nNew body6: old body5 (2,3)\n\nNew body7: old body6 (2,4)\n\nNew body8: old body7 (1,4)\n\nNew body9: old body8 (1,5)\n\nNew body10: old body9 (2,5)\n\nNew body11: old body10 (3,5)\n\nNew body12: old body11 (4,5)\n\nNew body13: old body12 (4,6)\n\nNew body14: old body13 (5,6)\n\nNew body15: old body14 (5,5)\n\nNew body16: old body15 (5,4)\n\nNew body17: old body16 (6,4)\n\nNew body18: old body17 (6,3)\n\nNew body19: old body18 (6,2)\n\nNew body20: old body19 (6,1)  // old tail\n\nAnd since food eaten, new body21 at old tail position (6,1)? No, old tail position is already occupied by new body20, so we don't add extra; the snake grows by not removing the tail.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body1 (3,3), body2 (3,2), body3 (2,2), body4 (1,2), body5 (1,3), body6 (2,3), body7 (2,4), body8 (1,4), body9 (1,5), body10 (2,5), body11 (3,5), body12 (4,5), body13 (4,6), body14 (5,6), body15 (5,5), body16 (5,4), body17 (6,4), body18 (6,3), body19 (6,2), body20 (6,1) tail.\n\nSo tail at (6,1), length 21 again? Before turn 83 move, length 21, after turn 83 move no food, length 20, after turn 84 move with food, length 21.\n\nBut we ate one food, so should be 21, yes.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to eat (4,2) or other.\n\nBut this is complicated.\n\nTo simplify, for long-term survival, I should avoid eating both foods immediately because the area around (4,2) and (4,3) might become trapped.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,2) or (4,3), and the only free cells are above or below.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), after eating, I can move U to (4,3) or D to (4,1) or R to (5,2) wall.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), eat, then from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) is free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\nThen I can go to (4,4), for example.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied, or L to (3,4), free, or R to (5,4), occupied.\n\n(4,5) is occupied by snake, so cannot move there.\n\nL to (3,4) free, R to (5,4) occupied, D to (4,3) but that's where I came from, body now.\n\nSo only L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) occupied, impossible, or D to (4,3) body, collision.\n\nSo from (4,4), only possible move is L to (3,4) or R to (5,4) but occupied, so only L to (3,4).\n\nThen to (3,4), and so on.\n\nBut there are free cells like (3,3), (3,4), (2,6), etc.\n\nBut with long snake, it might be ok.\n\nBut let's consider not eating at turn 83.\n\nMove D to (3,1) at turn 83.\n\nMove D to (3,1), no food, head to (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen tail moves, freeing (4,1).\n\nAt turn 84, from (3,1), direction D, so can move L to (2,1), or R to (4,1), or D down but wall.\n\n(2,1) free, (4,1) is now free? After move to (3,1), no food, so tail moved.\n\nPrevious tail at (4,1) is removed, so (4,1) is free now.\n\nAt turn 84, from (3,1), move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nIf I move R to (4,1), no food, so just move, head to (4,1), then I can later move to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nSimilarly, I can move to (4,2) from there.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,3) with shorter life span.\n\nIt will disappear after turn 88, so I have 6 turns to eat it.\n\nCurrent turn 83, so turns 83 to 88.\n\nIf I don't eat it soon, I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) has longer life.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat both.\n\nThe safest way might be to eat (4,2) at turn 83, then at turn 84 eat (4,3), then move to (4,4) at turn 85.\n\nFrom (4,4), as above, only move L to (3,4) at turn 85.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen at turn 86, from (3,4), can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) occupied; D to (3,3), free; L to (2,4), occupied; R to (4,4), body.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R right.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5) occupied, collision; D to (3,3) free; L to (2,4) occupied, collision.\n\nSo only D to (3,3) is safe.\n\nMove to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), and so on.\n\nI can survive for a while.\n\nBut eventually, I need to find a path out.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3), I can go to (3,4) or other.\n\nBut let's see the free cells.\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat the foods later.\n\nBut (4,3) will disappear soon.\n\nTurn 83, life span 6, available until turn 88, so I have until turn 88 to eat it.\n\nAt turn 83, I can move U to (3,3), then at turn 84 move R to (4,3) to eat it, as before.\n\nThen I have eaten one food, and (4,2) is still there.\n\nThen I can move from (4,3) to (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) after eating, move U to (4,4), then to (3,4) as above.\n\nThen from (3,4) move D to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can move to (3,2) but occupied, or (2,3) occupied, or (4,3) body, or (3,4) body.\n\nFrom (3,3), after moving from (3,4) to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction D (since moved down from (3,4) to (3,3)).\n\nThen at turn 87, from (3,3), direction D, so can move U to (3,4), but (3,4) is body; D to (3,2), occupied; L to (2,3), occupied; R to (4,3), which may be free or not.\n\nIn this path, (4,3) was eaten and is body now, so all directions are occupied or body, no move possible, death.\n\nLet's trace the path.\n\nAssume turn 83: move U to (3,3)  // no food\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,3)  // eat food, head at (4,3), direction R\n\nTurn 85: move U to (4,4)  // no food, head to (4,4), direction U\n\nTurn 86: move L to (3,4)  // no food, head to (3,4), direction L\n\nTurn 87: from (3,4), move D to (3,3)  // no food, head to (3,3), direction D\n\nNow at turn 87, head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4) - but (3,4) is where I came from, body segment now, collision.\n\nD to (3,2) - occupied by body, collision.\n\nL to (2,3) - occupied, collision.\n\nR to (4,3) - occupied, body, collision.\n\nAll directions blocked, die.\n\nSo this path leads to death at turn 87.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (4,3) and moving that way is dangerous.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), I should not move U to (4,4), but move to (5,3) or something.\n\nAt turn 85, from (4,3), instead of U, move R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\nMove R to (5,3), no food, head to (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (5,3), direction R, so can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) occupied, (5,2) wall, (4,3) body, (6,3) occupied.\n\nAll blocked, die immediately.\n\nMove L to (3,3) at turn 85 from (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), move L to (3,3), but direction is R, moving L is instant reverse? Current direction R, moving L left is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nCannot move L to (3,3) because instant reverse.\n\nOnly U, D, R possible.\n\nU to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) free, (4,2) has food, (5,3) free.\n\nIf I move D to (4,2) to eat food, at turn 85.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen from (4,2), at turn 86, can move U to (4,3), but (4,3) body now; D to (4,1), which may be free or not; L to (3,2), occupied; R to (5,2) wall.\n\nU to (4,3) body, collision; D to (4,1), let's see if free; L to (3,2) occupied; R to (5,2) wall.\n\n(4,1) might be free or occupied.\n\nIn this state, after eating at (4,2), snake positions depend.\n\nBut likely occupied.\n\nFrom (4,2) after eating, only D to (4,1) if free, but (4,1) might be body.\n\nFor example, in the sequence where I ate at (4,3) at turn 84, then at turn 85 move D to (4,2) eat, head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (4,2), U to (4,3) body, D to (4,1) - what is (4,1)? In the snake, it might be occupied or not.\n\nTo avoid risk, at turn 83, I should not move U or D, but move R to (4,2) to eat, then at turn 84, instead of moving U to (4,3), move D to (4,1) to avoid the area.\n\nMove D to (4,1) at turn 84.\n\nFrom (4,2), move D to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is tail at that moment.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2) at turn 83, snake head at (4,2), body includes (3,2), (2,2), ..., (4,1) tail.\n\nMove D to (4,1), which is tail, so if no food, it is safe.\n\n(4,1) has no food, so move to (4,1), no food eaten, so head to (4,1), tail moves.\n\nNew head (4,1), body: previous head (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), etc., tail at (5,1) or something.\n\nTail moves, (4,1) is free after move? No, head is there.\n\nPosition: after move, head at (4,1), body at (4,2), (3,2), ..., and tail removed or not.\n\nSince no food, tail removed, so new tail at previous body19.\n\nPrevious to move: head (4,2), body1 (3,2), body2 (2,2), ..., body20 (4,1) tail? After eating at turn 83, we had 22 segments? At turn 83, after eating, snake length 22.\n\nHead (4,2), body1 (3,2), body2 (2,2), ..., body20 (5,1), body21 (4,1) tail.\n\nMove D to (4,1), but (4,1) is tail, so moving to tail position.\n\nSince no food there, head moves to (4,1), which was tail, so the body segments shift, and tail is removed.\n\nNew head at (4,1)\n\nNew body1: previous head (4,2)\n\nNew body2: previous body1 (3,2)\n\n...\n\nNew body20: previous body20 (5,1)  // previous body20 was (5,1)? Let's not.\n\nNew tail at previous body20 position.\n\n(4,1) is now head, and (4,2) is body, etc.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move to other cells, like L to (3,1) or R to (5,1) but (5,1) may be body.\n\n(3,1) is free, so I can move L to (3,1), for example.\n\nThen I can survive longer.\n\nAnd the food at (4,3) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is gone, but I ate it at turn 83.\n\nIn this case, I ate (4,2) at turn 83, then at turn 84 moved D to (4,1), no eat, then at turn 85 from (4,1) move to (3,1) or other.\n\nThen I can go to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc., and later come back for (4,3) if possible.\n\nSince (4,3) has short life, I need to eat it soon.\n\nTurn 83 to 88, so at turn 85, it is still there.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body now, collision; or L to (3,1), free; or R to (5,1), occupied; or D to (4,0) wall.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) occupied, D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) free, R to (4,1) body.\n\nSo only L to (2,1).\n\nThen to (2,1), and so on.\n\nTo eat (4,3), I need to go through (3,3) or (4,4), but it might be difficult with the snake body.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move U to (2,2) occupied, etc.\n\nIt might take too many turns, and (4,3) may disappear.\n\nTurn 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 available.\n\nAt turn 85, I am at (2,1), far from (4,3), and the snake is long, so it might not be possible to reach in time.\n\nTherefore, to not miss the food at (4,3), I should eat it soon.\n\nThe best option is to eat both foods quickly and then escape to the free areas.\n\nFrom the earlier death path, when I moved to (4,4) and got stuck, but if after eating at (4,3), I move to (5,3) instead.\n\nAt turn 85, from (4,3), move R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\nHead to (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (5,3), direction R, move U to (5,4) occupied, D to (5,2) wall, L to (4,3) body, R to (6,3) occupied.\n\nAll blocked, die.\n\nMove U to (4,4) from (4,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,3), stuck.\n\nMove D to (4,2) from (4,3), but (4,2) has food, so eat at turn 85.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (4,2), U to (4,3) body, D to (4,1), which may be free or not.\n\nAfter eating at (4,2), snake positions: head at (4,2), body at (4,3), (3,3), etc., so (4,1) might be free if tail moved.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's messy.\n\nPerhaps at turn 83, I should move to (3,1) instead.\n\nMove D to (3,1) at turn 83.\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nAt turn 84, move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay move R to (4,1), no food, head to (4,1), direction R.\n\nThen at turn 85, from (4,1), move U to (4,2) to eat food, or L to (3,1), or R to (5,1) occupied, D to (4,0) wall.\n\nSo move U to (4,2) eat food.\n\nHead to (4,2), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (4,2), move U to (4,3) to eat food, or D to (4,1) body, L to (3,2) occupied, R to (5,2) wall.\n\nSo move U to (4,3) eat food.\n\nThen I eat both foods at turn 85 and 86.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 87, from (4,3), move U to (4,4), or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen I can move to (4,4), for example.\n\nThen from (4,4), as before, only move L to (3,4) since U and R occupied.\n\nThen to (3,4), then move D to (3,3), but (3,3) may be free.\n\nIn this case, at turn 87, from (4,3) move U to (4,4), head to (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 88, from (4,4) move L to (3,4), head to (3,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 89, from (3,4) move D to (3,3), but (3,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nAt this point, snake has grown, and cells may be occupied.\n\nBut (3,3) might be free initially.\n\nSince I ate two foods, snake length 23, board has less free space, but I can move to (3,4) then to (3,3) if free, or to (2,4) if free, but (2,4) occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), move U to (3,5) occupied, D to (3,3) free, L to (2,4) occupied, R to (4,4) body.\n\nSo only D to (3,3).\n\nThen to (3,3), and so on.\n\nSimilar to before, might get stuck later, but I can survive for more turns.\n\nSince the food at (4,3) is eaten by turn 86 in this path, it's fine.\n\nIn this path, I eat both foods without immediate death.\n\nAt turn 83: move D to (3,1)\n\nAt turn 84: move R to (4,1)\n\nAt turn 85: move U to (4,2) eat\n\nAt turn 86: move U to (4,3) eat\n\nThen at turn 87: move U to (4,4) or other.\n\nNo death in 5 turns.\n\nIf I move R at turn 83 to (4,2) eat, then at turn 84 move D to (4,1), then at turn 85 move L to (3,1), then I can go to (2,1), but I miss (4,3) food.\n\nSince (4,3) has short life, I might miss it, so better to eat it.\n\nTherefore, the path where I move D at turn 83 to (3,1), then to (4,1), then to (4,2) and (4,3) allows me to eat both foods and survive for several turns.\n\nI could move R at turn 83 to eat (4,2), then at turn 84 move U to (4,3) to eat, then from (4,3) move to (5,3) or (4,4), but (5,3) might lead to death, while (4,4) to (3,4) etc. can work.\n\nBut in the move D first path, it seems safer.\n\nSince the head direction is R, moving D down might not be preferred, but it's allowed.\n\nFor long-term, moving to (3,1) might open up more space.\n\nI think moving D to (3,1) at turn 83 is a good start.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 83: move D to (3,1)\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,1)  // no eat\n\nTurn 85: move U to (4,2) eat food\n\nTurn 86: move U to (4,3) eat food\n\nThen for turn 87, from (4,3) after eating, I can move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nTo maximize space, move to (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nSay move to (4,4) for consistency.\n\nBut I need to output only for the current turn and a few ahead? The answer format is to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer, I need to provide the action for turn 83, and optionally for future turns, but the format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions or so.\n\nBut for the decision, I need to choose the first action.\n\nSince the state is given, I should output from turn 83 onward for a few turns.\n\nBut in the box, it might be a sequence.\n\nFor now, at turn 83, move D to (3,1) seems good.\n\nMove U to (3,3) also possible, but with risk of missing (4,2) or getting stuck.\n\nIn the move U path, if after eating (4,3), I move to (3,3) but I couldn't because of direction.\n\nAt turn 85 from (4,3), I can move to (4,4) or (5,3), both risky.\n\nWhereas in move D path, I can eat both foods safely.\n\nSo I think move D at turn 83 is the best.\n\nSo action for turn 83: D (down)\n\nThen for the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and simulated multiple move sequences 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- Eating both positive foods (at (4,2) and (4,3)) is desirable to increase the score, but the snake is long (21 segments) on a 6x6 grid with limited free space, increasing collision risk.\n- Food at (4,3) has a short life span (disappears after turn 88), so it must be eaten soon. Food at (4,2) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 91), allowing flexibility.\n- Moving directly to eat (4,2) at turn 83 risks trapping the snake near the crowded top-right area after eating both foods, as seen in simulations (e.g., moving to (4,2) then (4,3) can lead to dead ends by turn 87).\n- Moving down to (3,1) at turn 83 avoids immediate food consumption, freeing space as the tail moves, and sets up a safer path to eat both foods while accessing open areas like (2,1) and (3,1) for future movement.\n\nAfter simulating sequences, the optimal first move is **Down (D)** to (3,1) at turn 83. This:\n- Avoids the risky (4,2) eat and potential trap.\n- Preserves access to both foods.\n- Allows eating (4,2) and (4,3) by turns 85-86 via (4,1), with no collisions.\n- Provides an escape route to less crowded areas (e.g., (2,1), (3,1)) for survival beyond 5 turns.\n\nThe planned sequence for turns 83-88 is:\n- **Turn 83: D** – Move down to (3,1), no food eaten, tail moves, freeing (4,1).\n- **Turn 84: R** – Move right to (4,1), no food eaten, tail moves.\n- **Turn 85: U** – Move up to (4,2), eat positive food (+1, length +1).\n- **Turn 86: U** – Move up to (4,3), eat positive food (+1, length +1).\n- **Turn 87: U** – Move up to (4,4), no food, accessing open area.\n- **Turn 88: L** – Move left to (3,4), no food, continuing to open space.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 86, avoids all collisions, and ensures survival beyond turn 88 with options to navigate to free cells like (3,3) or (3,4).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 83: D\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 84, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions are given as a list: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (2,2), and so on, up to tail at (5,1). Let me list out all positions to visualize:\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Body: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)  [that's the tail]\n\nThe snake head direction is down, meaning it was moving down to (3,1) from (3,2)? Positions are head first, so from (3,2) to (3,1), which is down? Let's see: from (3,2) to (3,1) is decreasing y, so that's down, yes. Direction is D, so current head is at (3,1), and it came from (3,2), so moving down to (3,1).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo, playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the grid has cells x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 for movement, but internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nSo, valid cells: (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2).\n\nNow, snake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions: I'll list coordinates:\n\n1. (3,1) - head\n\n2. (3,2)\n\n3. (2,2)\n\n4. (1,2)\n\n5. (1,3)\n\n6. (2,3)\n\n7. (2,4)\n\n8. (1,4)\n\n9. (1,5)\n\n10. (2,5)\n\n11. (3,5)\n\n12. (4,5)\n\n13. (4,6)\n\n14. (5,6)\n\n15. (5,5)\n\n16. (5,4)\n\n17. (6,4)\n\n18. (6,3)\n\n19. (6,2)\n\n20. (6,1)\n\n21. (5,1) - tail\n\nSo, the snake has 21 segments, meaning it's long, and the grid is small, so space is tight.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,2).\n\n(4,3) is not occupied by snake? Let's see if food is under snake.\n\n(4,3): is it in snake positions? From list: (4,5), (4,6), etc., no (4,3). Similarly, (4,2) not in list. So both are free cells.\n\n(4,3) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 84, life span 5, so it will be gone by turn 89? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, food with life span L will disappear at turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, L=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t if head moves there.\n\nStandard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns where life span >0.\n\nAt turn t, if life span is N, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor (4,3): at turn 84, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 88? Turn 84: life span 5, after turn 84, it becomes 4 at turn 85, ..., at turn 88: life span 1, after turn 88, it becomes 0 and disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2): life span 8 at turn 84, disappears after turn 91.\n\nNow, current head at (3,1), direction down. But direction is given as D, which is down, meaning it was moving down to (3,1).\n\nPossible moves from (3,1): since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because no instant reverse. Current direction down, so cannot move up to (3,2) because that's opposite.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,2) - but that's the body segment, and since direction is down, moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- Down: (3,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left: (2,1)\n\n- Right: (4,1)\n\n(2,1) and (4,1) are possible.\n\nNow, (2,1): is it occupied? Snake positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (2,2), etc. Tail is (5,1), and (6,1), (6,2), etc. Is (2,1) in the list? No: positions are (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), ... no (2,1). Similarly, (4,1): not listed, but (5,1) is tail, (6,1) is body.\n\n(4,1): let's check coordinates: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. (4,1) should be free, but is it?\n\nSnake positions: (6,1) is there, (5,1) is tail, (3,1) head, (2,2), etc. No (4,1) mentioned, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) not mentioned, free.\n\nBut (3,0) is wall, invalid.\n\n(3,2) is body and also reverse move, invalid.\n\nSo from (3,1), possible moves: left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, what about the food? (4,3) and (4,2) are both at x=4, y=3 and y=2.\n\n(4,2) is above (4,1), but (4,1) is a possible move.\n\nCurrent head at (3,1).\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), then I'm at (4,1), one step closer to the food.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), so from (4,1), I can go up to (4,2), but (4,2) has food, or to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,2) also has food, but let's see the life span.\n\n(4,3) life span 5, (4,2) life span 8, so (4,3) will disappear sooner.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,1), which is adjacent to head? Head at (3,1), tail at (5,1), not adjacent; (5,1) is at distance.\n\nAdjacent cells to head: (3,1) has neighbors: (3,2) body, (3,0) wall, (2,1), (4,1).\n\n(2,1) and (4,1) are free.\n\nNow, if I move to (4,1), then I can consider going up to (4,2) or other directions.\n\nBut (4,2) has food, so if I go to (4,2) next, I can eat it.\n\nBut there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,1). If I move to (4,1), and tail is at (5,1), they are adjacent? (4,1) and (5,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAfter I move, the snake moves: when I move the head, the tail also moves forward, so positions shift.\n\nI need to simulate the movement.\n\nLet me denote the snake positions as a list: let's index them.\n\nSnake: [head: (3,1), seg1: (3,2), seg2: (2,2), seg3: (1,2), seg4: (1,3), seg5: (2,3), seg6: (2,4), seg7: (1,4), seg8: (1,5), seg9: (2,5), seg10: (3,5), seg11: (4,5), seg12: (4,6), seg13: (5,6), seg14: (5,5), seg15: (5,4), seg16: (6,4), seg17: (6,3), seg18: (6,2), seg19: (6,1), seg20: (5,1)] I think I miscounted; positions given: from (3,1) to (5,1), that's 21 positions? List has 21 coordinates: indices 0 to 20, head at 0, tail at 20.\n\nIn the input: \"Snake Positions\":[(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] so 21 segments.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away from its current position, so the snake effectively moves forward, and if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so it grows.\n\nIn this case, if I move head to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the new tail is added at the end.\n\nBut for collision, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail, because tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically, the head can move to the tail's current position because the tail will move, so it's safe, as long as no other body part is there.\n\nIn this case, from (3,1), moving to (2,1) or (4,1), both are free, no body.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,1)\n\nThen new head at (2,1), direction: since I moved left, new direction L.\n\nThen body: the segment that was at (3,1) becomes body, so positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), ... up to tail (5,1), but tail will move? When head moves to (2,1), the tail moves from (5,1) to where? The snake shifts: the last segment is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten, so tail is removed, and new positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] and (5,1) is gone, tail is now (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if move right to (4,1): head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), ... tail moves from (5,1), so new tail is (6,1) or? Positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] and (5,1) removed, tail at (6,1).\n\nIn both cases, tail ends up at (6,1) after move.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) and (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which might be reachable.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and possible paths.\n\nFirst, I need to consider risks. The snake is long, 21 segments, in a 6x6 play area minus obstacle, so 36 cells minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells, snake 21, so 14 free cells, but some occupied by food? Food is two, so 12 free cells? Not all cells are accessible due to walls, but walls are borders, internal only one obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2), so 6x6=36 minus 1, 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 21, so 14 free, but two have food, so 12 empty cells.\n\nSpace is tight, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,2) are both on column x=4.\n\n(4,2) has longer life span, 8 turns, (4,3) has 5 turns.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer to head? Head at (3,1), (4,3) is at (4,3), Manhattan distance |3-4| + |1-3| = 1+2=3, similarly (4,2) |3-4| + |1-2| =1+1=2, so (4,2) is closer.\n\nBut I can reach both.\n\nHowever, if I go for (4,2) directly.\n\nFrom (3,1), if I move right to (4,1), then from (4,1), I can move up to (4,2), which has food.\n\nThen, if I move to (4,2) on turn 85, I eat the food.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, so the new length is 22.\n\nBut let's see the position after eating.\n\nTurn 84: move right to (4,1), no food there, so snake moves to [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), ..., (6,1) ] as above, tail at (6,1).\n\nThen turn 85: from (4,1), I can move up to (4,2), which has food, so I eat it.\n\nThen, since I eat, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (4,2), then the previous head (4,1) becomes body, and all body segments stay, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nPositions: before move, snake is [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), ..., (6,1) ] 21 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2) with food, new head (4,2), then the body is the previous list without removing tail, so [ (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] and tail is (6,1), but since I ate, I add a new segment, so tail was (6,1), now it stays, and the new tail is still (6,1)? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that would have been removed is kept, so the snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, when head moves to (4,2), the new head is (4,2), and the body includes all previous positions, so the list becomes: head (4,2), then previous head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), ..., up to (6,1), and since tail was not removed, the snake has 22 segments now, with tail at (6,1).\n\nThe positions: index 0: (4,2), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,4), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (3,5), 13: (4,5), 14: (4,6), 15: (5,6), 16: (5,5), 17: (5,4), 18: (6,4), 19: (6,3), 20: (6,2), 21: (6,1) — and since ate, no removal, so tail is (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) is the last segment.\n\nNow, after eating at (4,2), the food is gone, so only (4,3) left.\n\nBut now, what about tail reward danger? The warning is: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, when I ate at (4,2), the tail is at (6,1), not adjacent to head at (4,2). (4,2) and (6,1) are not adjacent; |4-6|=2, |2-1|=1, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nThen I can consider eating (4,3) next.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move up to (4,3) to eat it on turn 86.\n\n(4,3) has food, life span 5 at turn 84, so at turn 85, if I eat on turn 85? Turn 84: move to (4,1), no eat.\n\nTurn 85: move to (4,2), eat that food.\n\nThen turn 86: from (4,2), move to (4,3), which has food, so eat (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) life span: at turn 84, life span 5, so at turn 85, it should be 4? Life span decreases every turn.\n\nAt turn 84, food (4,3) has life span 5, so after turn 84, at turn 85, life span becomes 4, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2), life span 8 at turn 84, at turn 85: 7.\n\nBut when I eat at turn 85 at (4,2), it's consumed, so gone.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (4,2), I can move to (4,3) to eat it, since (4,3) has life span 4 at turn 85? Turn 85: before move, life span of (4,3) is 4 (since decreased from 5 at turn 84 to 4 at turn 85).\n\nAfter eating at turn 86, snake grows to 23 segments.\n\nBut is (4,3) available? Yes.\n\nBut let's see the position after turn 85: after eating at (4,2), head at (4,2), body: (4,1), (3,1), etc., tail at (6,1).\n\nThen move to (4,3): head to (4,3), eat food, so new head (4,3), body includes (4,2), (4,1), etc., tail not removed, so snake length 23, tail at (6,1).\n\nNow, but the grid is small, and snake is long, I might trap myself.\n\nBut let's see the other option: if I move left to (2,1) at turn 84.\n\nThen head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places, but the food might expire.\n\n(4,3) has only 5 turns life, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nAt turn 84, life span 5, so I have until turn 88 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) until turn 91.\n\nBut with snake at (3,1), if I move left to (2,1), I am farther from the food.\n\n(2,1) to (4,3) is |2-4| + |1-3| = 2+2=4 moves, to (4,2) |2-4| + |1-2| =2+1=3.\n\nBut since I have time, but space is tight, I need to plan for survival.\n\nMoreover, there might be risks.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6. Obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) blocked.\n\nWalls at borders.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead (3,1)\n\nThen: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nSo, let's list occupied cells:\n\n- Row y=1: (3,1) head, (6,1), (5,1) tail\n\n- y=2: (3,2), (2,2), (6,2)\n\n- y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (6,3)\n\n- y=4: (2,4), (1,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n- y=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n- y=6: (4,6), (5,6)\n\nAnd food at (4,3) and (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, x=4, not occupied, similarly (4,3) at y=3,x=4.\n\nNow, free cells: let's find all free cells.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) obstacle.\n\nOccupied by snake: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and head (3,1) already included.\n\nList: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are both occupied.\n\nNow, missing cells: for example, (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\ny=6: (4,6) and (5,6) occupied, so (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (6,6) free? But (6,6) is within bounds.\n\nLet's list all possible cells:\n\nCells: (x,y) for x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6 except (5,2)\n\nOccupied: from snake: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\n(5,1) is occupied, (6,1), etc.\n\nAlso, (1,1) not occupied, (1,6) not, (2,1) not, (2,6) not, (3,3) not, (3,4) not, (3,6) not, (4,1) not, (4,2) not but has food, (4,3) not has food, (4,4) not, (5,3) not but (5,2) obstacle, so (5,3) is free? (5,3) is not listed as occupied or obstacle, obstacle only (5,2), so (5,3) free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) not occupied, (6,6) not, (4,4) not, etc.\n\nFree cells including food: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2) food, (4,3) food, (4,4), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nAnd (3,6)? y=6, x=3, not occupied.\n\nAlso (5,3), etc.\n\nBut food at (4,2) and (4,3) are to be eaten, so when eaten, they become snake body.\n\nNow, back to moves at turn 84.\n\nFrom head (3,1), direction down, can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), as I thought, then turn 85 move up to (4,2) to eat that food.\n\nThen I have eaten one food, snake length 22.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move to (4,3) to eat the other food on turn 86.\n\nBut after eating (4,3), head at (4,3), and I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (4,3): up to (4,4), down to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body? After eating at (4,2) on turn 85, (4,2) is body segment.\n\nAt turn 85, after eating at (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), etc., so (4,2) is head, (4,1) is neck, etc.\n\nThen at turn 86, move to (4,3): (4,3) has food, so eat, new head (4,3), body: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), ... tail at (6,1), not removed, so snake length 23.\n\nNow from (4,3), possible moves: up to (4,4), down to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nLeft to (3,3), right to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, as per earlier.\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nSo can go to (3,3) or (5,3) or (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) is free.\n\nNow, the tail is at (6,1), which is far.\n\nBut the area around (4,3) might be crowded.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), the body includes (4,2), (4,1), etc.\n\nLet's see the local area.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I go to (3,3), or (5,3), or (4,4).\n\n(5,3) is free, but (5,2) is obstacle, so not accessible, but (5,3) is above obstacle.\n\n(3,3) free, (4,4) free.\n\nNow, after eating both foods, snake is longer, 23 segments, and fewer free cells.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both immediately, but save one for later, but (4,3) will expire soon.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 84, so by turn 88 it's gone.\n\nTurn 84,85,86 I can eat it.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 86, it might be possible later, but with limited moves.\n\nBut let's see the other choice: move left to (2,1) at turn 84.\n\nThen head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: from (2,1), I can move up, down, left, or right, but not right to (3,1) because that's reverse? Current direction left, since I moved left to (2,1), so direction L.\n\nCannot move right to (3,1), which is body anyway.\n\nPossible moves: up to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, occupied.\n\nDown to (2,0), y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,1)\n\nRight to (3,1), but reverse and body, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,1) is left to (1,1), since (1,1) is free.\n\n(1,1) is free, yes.\n\nSo if I move left to (2,1) at turn 84, then at turn 85 I must move to (1,1), since only choice.\n\nThen from (1,1), where can I go?\n\nFrom (1,1), direction left or? After moving to (1,1), direction is L.\n\nPossible moves: up to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, occupied.\n\nDown to (1,0), wall invalid.\n\nLeft to (0,1), wall invalid.\n\nRight to (2,1), which is now body, since head moved from there.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), the previous head (2,1) is now body, so (2,1) occupied.\n\nSo from (1,1), only possible moves: up to (1,2) body, collision; down wall; left wall; right to (2,1) body, collision. All directions invalid except up, but up is body, so I die if I go there.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 84: move left to (2,1). Snake was [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), ..., (5,1) ]\n\nAfter move to (2,1), no food, so new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (6,1), and tail (5,1) removed, so new tail is (6,1)? Positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] and (5,1) gone, tail at (6,1).\n\nNow at (2,1), direction L.\n\nFor turn 85, possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,2) - but (2,2) is in positions, index 3: (2,2), occupied.\n\n- Down: (2,0) - y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Left: (1,1) - free cell\n\n- Right: (3,1) - but (3,1) is index 1 in positions, occupied, and also reverse direction? Current direction L, moving right is opposite, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (1,1).\n\nMove to (1,1), no food there, so new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (6,1), and tail (6,1) removed? When head moves to (1,1), the tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food, so tail (6,1) removed, new positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2).\n\nNow head at (1,1), direction: moved left, so direction L.\n\nFor turn 86, possible moves from (1,1):\n\n- Up: (1,2) - but (1,2) is in positions, index 5: (1,2), occupied\n\n- Down: (1,0) wall, invalid\n\n- Left: (0,1) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,1) - (2,1) is index 1, occupied\n\nAll adjacent cells are invalid: up body, down wall, left wall, right body. So I have no move, I die.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (2,1) at turn 84 leads to death on turn 86, because I get stuck at (1,1).\n\nSo this is a bad move; I must avoid this.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move at turn 84 is to move right to (4,1).\n\nThen, as before, I can go to (4,2) to eat the food on turn 85.\n\nNow, after that, I need to think ahead for survival.\n\nTurn 84: move right to (4,1), no eat.\n\nSnake: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nDirection: moved right, so R.\n\nTurn 85: move up to (4,2), eat food (value +1), life span decreases but eaten.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) and tail not removed, so tail at (6,1), length 22.\n\nDirection: moved up, so U.\n\nNow, food (4,2) eaten, so only (4,3) left with life span at turn 85: was 5 at turn 84, decreased to 4 at turn 85, but since eaten at turn 85, (4,2) gone.\n\n(4,3) at turn 85: life span 4.\n\nTurn 86: from (4,2), I can move to (4,3) to eat it.\n\nMove up to (4,3), eat food.\n\nThen new head (4,3), body: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), etc., tail not removed, snake length 23, tail at (6,1).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, from (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (4,4)\n\n- Down to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, cannot\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n(4,4) is free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to obstacle (5,2), but (5,3) is accessible.\n\nI should choose a move that keeps me safe.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1), which might move soon.\n\nBut I need to think about the future.\n\nSince snake is long, I need to find a path that doesn't trap me.\n\nNotice that the left part of the grid has some free cells: (1,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), etc.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), head at (4,3), I can move to (3,3) or (5,3) or (4,4).\n\nIf I move to (5,3), then from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's see what happens if I go to (4,4) or (3,3).\n\nFirst, life span of food: (4,3) eaten at turn 86, so no more food for now, but (4,2) was eaten earlier, no other food mentioned.\n\nFood was only two: (4,3) and (4,2), both eaten by turn 86.\n\nSo no more food, I need to survive as long as possible.\n\nBut the snake is long, and grid small, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the tail will move as I move, freeing up cells.\n\nAt turn 86, after eating (4,3), snake positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nNow, from head (4,3), I move say to (4,4).\n\nTurn 86: move up to (4,4), no food, so snake moves: head to (4,4), then body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), etc., and tail (6,1) removed, so new positions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: up to (4,5), but (4,5) is body?

(3,3) should be free.\n\nLeft to (2,4), but (2,4) is index 11, occupied.\n\nRight to (4,4), body, occupied.\n\nSo only down to (3,3).\n\nMove to (3,3), no food, head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), etc., tail removed: [ (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4).\n\nDirection D?

(3,3) has neighbors: (3,4) up: body, (3,2) down: body, (2,3) left: body, (4,3) right: body.

Positions: (6,3) is index 21, occupied.\n\nAll moves invalid: up body, down wall, left body, right body. So I die immediately.\n\nTherefore, moving to (5,3) causes instant death.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) from (4,3) at turn 86.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), head at (4,3), move left to (3,3).\n\nNo food, so head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), etc., tail removed: [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2)? After move, tail is removed, so from previous, after move to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) but (6,2) is the last, tail.\n\nIndex: 0: (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), 7: (1,2), 8: (1,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (3,5), 15: (4,5), 16: (4,6), 17: (5,6), 18: (5,5), 19: (5,4), 20: (6,4), 21: (6,3), 22: (6,2) tail.\n\nFrom (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: up to (3,4), free?

(4,4) not occupied.\n\nSo move right to (4,4).\n\nMove to (4,4), no food, head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,3), etc., tail removed: [ (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4).\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: up to (4,5), body, index 17?

(5,4) index 21, occupied.\n\nAll occupied, die.\n\nSo in all cases, after eating both foods and moving around, I get trapped quickly because the snake is too long for the space.\n\nBut I have to eat the food to score, but then I die soon after.\n\nPerhaps I should only eat one food, or delay eating.\n\nFor example, at turn 84, move right to (4,1), then at turn 85, instead of moving up to (4,2) to eat, I could move elsewhere.\n\nBut (4,2) has food, and if I don't eat it, I might not get another chance, but it has life span 8, so I have time.\n\n(4,2) life span 8 at turn 84, so until turn 91.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) life span 5, until turn 88.\n\nAt turn 85, from (4,1), after moving right at turn 84.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: up to (4,2) food, down to (4,0) wall invalid, left to (3,1) body, reverse? Current direction R, moving left is reverse, and body, invalid, right to (5,1) but (5,1) is tail? After turn 84 move, tail is at (6,1), (5,1) is not there; positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), ..., (6,1), so (5,1) is not present, only (6,1) is tail.\n\n(5,1) was tail at turn 83, but after move, removed.\n\nSo from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (4,2) food\n\n- Down: (4,0) wall invalid\n\n- Left: (3,1) body and reverse, invalid\n\n- Right: (5,1) - is (5,1) occupied?

(5,1) is not in the list, and not wall, so free.\n\nBut (5,1) is adjacent to obstacle (5,2), but (5,1) is at y=1, x=5, which is valid.\n\nSo from (4,1), I can move up to (4,2) or right to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is free.\n\nIf I move to (5,1) at turn 85, no eat.\n\nThen head to (5,1), no food, so snake moves: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), etc., tail removed, positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: up to (5,2), but (5,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nDown to (5,0) wall invalid.\n\nLeft to (4,1), body, occupied.\n\nRight to (6,1), but (6,1) is not in positions? Positions have (6,2), (6,3), etc., (6,1) was tail but removed, so (6,1) is free? After move to (5,1), positions are [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] so (6,1) not occupied, free.\n\nSo move right to (6,1).\n\nThen similar issues.\n\nBut I need to eat the food eventually.\n\nPerhaps at turn 84, move right to (4,1), then turn 85 move up to (4,2) to eat, then turn 86, instead of eating (4,3), I move to (4,4) or something to avoid eating both and growing too fast.\n\nBut (4,3) will expire soon.\n\nAt turn 86, from (4,2), after eating at turn 85, head at (4,2), I can move to (4,3) to eat, or to (3,2) or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, or (4,1) down, but (4,1) body.\n\nFrom (4,2), after eating, positions: head (4,2), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), ..., (6,1)\n\nSo adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (4,3) food\n\n- Down: (4,1) body\n\n- Left: (3,2) body\n\n- Right: (5,2) obstacle\n\nSo only possible move is up to (4,3), which has food, so I must eat it or not move, but I have to move.\n\nI have to move to (4,3) and eat it, no choice.\n\nSo from (4,2), only move is to (4,3), so I eat it on turn 86.\n\nThen I am forced to grow to 23, and then I get trapped as before.\n\nBut in that case, I score 2 points by eating both foods, but die soon after.\n\nIf at turn 84 I move right to (4,1), turn 85 move to (5,1) instead of eating, then I avoid eating (4,2) now, but I can eat it later.\n\nTurn 85: from (4,1) move right to (5,1), no eat.\n\nThen positions as above.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (5,1), I can move right to (6,1), as it's free.\n\nMove to (6,1), no food, so head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), etc., tail removed: [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) ] tail at (6,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (6,1), possible moves: up to (6,2), but (6,2) is body, index 20? Positions: (6,2) is index 20, occupied.\n\nDown to (6,0) wall invalid.\n\nLeft to (5,1), body, index 1, occupied.\n\nRight to (7,1) wall invalid.\n\nAll invalid, die at turn 86.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo moving to (5,1) leads to death.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to eat both foods and then die, but I should try to survive longer.\n\nPerhaps I can eat only one food.\n\nBut (4,3) will expire soon, so I should eat it.\n\nAt turn 84, move right to (4,1), turn 85 move up to (4,2) eat, then turn 86 move to (4,3) eat, and then at turn 87, from (4,3), I have to move, and as before, I can only go to (3,3) or (5,3) or (4,4), but all lead to death quickly.\n\nBut earlier when I went to (3,3), I survived a few more turns, but still died.\n\nFor example, in the sequence where I went to (3,3), then (3,4), then (4,4), then died at turn 89 or something.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nTurn 84: move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 85: move up to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 86: move up to (4,3) eat\n\nTurn 87: from (4,3) move left to (3,3)  -- as in one scenario\n\nThen turn 88: from (3,3) move up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 89: from (3,4) move right to (4,4)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,4) no move, die.\n\nSo I survived until turn 90, scored 2 points.\n\nIf I don't eat the second food, but I have to eat (4,3) because it's the only move.\n\nAt turn 86, from (4,2), I have to move to (4,3), so I must eat it.\n\nSo I think scoring 2 points and surviving a few more turns is the best I can do.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival, but in this case, with the snake so long, survival is limited.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to go to the free areas.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,3), if I could go to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (4,4), then to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nOr to (5,4) but occupied.\n\nThe free cells are isolated.\n\nLet's list free cells at turn 86 after eating (4,3):\n\nSnake occupies 23 cells, grid has 35 cells, minus 1 obstacle, 34, so 11 free cells.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nBut (5,3) is free, but from (4,3), I can move to (5,3), but as before, from (5,3) no move.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is free, but then I can go to (3,4), etc., but as before, I can reach (3,4), (4,4), but then stuck.\n\n(2,6) and (3,6) are free, but how to get there.\n\nFrom (4,4), I could go up to (4,5) but occupied, or to (3,4) occupied, etc.\n\nNo, from (4,4) in previous, I was stuck.\n\nPerhaps at turn 84, I move right to (4,1), then turn 85, instead of moving up, I have no other choice, only up or right, but moving right to (5,1) led to death.\n\nSo I think it's inevitable to eat both and die.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial move.\n\nAt turn 84, from (3,1), move left to (2,1) is deadly, as we saw, so must move right to (4,1).\n\nThen the sequence is fixed: turn 85 move up to (4,2) eat, turn 86 move up to (4,3) eat.\n\nThen for turn 87, from (4,3), I need to choose a move to survive as long as possible.\n\nOptions: move up to (4,4), or left to (3,3), or right to (5,3).\n\nMoving to (5,3) is instant death, as no moves.\n\nMoving to (4,4): from (4,3) move up to (4,4), no eat, so positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) tail at (6,2)? After move, tail removed, so from previous 23, remove tail, 22 segments.\n\nPositions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) ] tail at (6,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (4,4), as before, only move left to (3,4) or up to (4,5) occupied, etc.\n\nUp to (4,5) body, down to (4,3) body, left to (3,4) free, right to (5,4) body.\n\nSo move left to (3,4).\n\nThen continue as before.\n\nMoving to (3,3) from (4,3): turn 87 move left to (3,3), no eat, positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) tail at (6,2).\n\nThen from (3,3), move up to (3,4) as before.\n\nIn both cases, I can survive until around turn 90.\n\nSince the food at (4,2) has longer life, I could skip eating it now and eat later, but at turn 85, from (4,1), if I don't move up, I have to move right to (5,1), which led to death, so I can't skip.\n\nSo I think the best is to eat both and then survive as long as possible.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions for turn 84, 85, etc., but since I think ahead 5 turns, I can output for turn 84 to 88 or so.\n\nBut the format is to output for the current turn and subsequent, but not necessarily 5, as many as I decide.\n\nBut the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nFor this state, turn 84: move right\n\nTurn 85: move up\n\nTurn 86: move up\n\nThen for turn 87, I can choose, say, move left to (3,3) to go to the left area.\n\nThen turn 88: from (3,3) move up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 89: from (3,4) move right to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 90: from (4,4) move left to (3,4) but body, or up to (4,5) body, etc., no move, die.\n\nBut I don't need to output that far.\n\nSince the food at (4,2) has life span 8, I could leave it for later, but I can't because at turn 85, from (4,1), I have to move up to (4,2) because the other move to (5,1) is deadly.\n\nSo I think it's fixed.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 84: R (right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 85: U (up to (4,2), eat food)\n\nTurn 86: U (up to (4,3), eat food)\n\nThen for turn 87, since from (4,3) I can move to (3,3) or (4,4) or (5,3), but (5,3) bad, so better to move to (3,3) to access more space.\n\nSo turn 87: L (left to (3,3))\n\nThen turn 88: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the output, I can stop at turn 86 or go further.\n\nThe instruction says to output actions for the turns, starting from current.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 84 to 88.\n\nBut turn 87 and 88 are after eating.\n\nSince I need to maximize survival, moving to (3,3) is better.\n\nBut let's see if from (4,3) moving to (4,4) is similar.\n\nI think both are similar.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output:\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nAnd that's the critical part.\n\nTo be complete, I can add more.\n\nBut the format is to box the actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction for future turns is not specified, but I can infer from moves.\n\nIn the state, at turn 84, direction is D, but after move, it changes.\n\nBut for the output, I think just the actions.\n\nSo for turn 84: action R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nThen for turn 87, say L to (3,3)\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinate.\n\nGrid: U for y+1, so up increases y.\n\n(3,1) to (4,1) is R, then to (4,2) is U, to (4,3) is U, then to (3,3) is L.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the way.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. Given the current state at turn 84, the snake is in a constrained position with limited safe moves. The food at (4,3) has a short life span (5 turns, expiring after turn 88) and must be eaten soon, while the food at (4,2) has a longer life span (8 turns, expiring after turn 91). However, immediate moves are risky due to the snake's length (21 segments) and the small grid (6x6 playable area minus one obstacle), leaving few free cells.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 84)\n- **Head position**: (3,1), direction down (D).\n- **Possible moves from (3,1)**:\n  - Up (U) to (3,2): Occupied by body segment and reverse move (current direction D), invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (3,0): Wall (y=0), invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (2,1): Free cell, but analysis shows this leads to a dead end by turn 86 (trapped at (1,1) with no escape).\n  - Right (R) to (4,1): Free cell, and the only safe move that avoids immediate death and allows access to food.\n- **Conclusion**: Moving right (R) to (4,1) is the only viable option at turn 84, as moving left leads to death.\n\n### Plan for 5+ Turns Ahead\n- **Turn 84 (current)**: Move right (R) to (4,1). This avoids the deadly left move and positions the snake closer to both food items.\n- **Turn 85**: From (4,1), direction right (R). Move up (U) to (4,2) to eat the positive food there (value +1, life span 8). This is the only safe move (down to wall, left to body/reverse, right to (5,1) leads to death by turn 86). Eating this food grows the snake to 22 segments.\n- **Turn 86**: From (4,2), direction up (U). Move up (U) to (4,3) to eat the positive food (value +1, life span 5). This is the only safe move (down to body, left to body, right to obstacle). Eating this food grows the snake to 23 segments. Both foods are now consumed, scoring +2.\n- **Beyond turn 86**: Survival is prioritized. From (4,3), the best move is left (L) to (3,3) to access free cells in the left area (e.g., (3,4), (4,4)), extending survival. Moves to (5,3) or (4,4) lead to quicker deaths. With this path, the snake can survive until around turn 90 by navigating to free cells like (3,3), (3,4), and (4,4), though the high snake density limits long-term survival.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence below ensures both foods are eaten (maximizing score) and survival is extended as long as possible. Actions are provided for turns 84 to 88 (5 turns ahead from current turn 84).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: R (right)  \nTurn 85: U (up)  \nTurn 86: U (up)  \nTurn 87: L (left)  \nTurn 88: U (up)  \n} \n\n### Explanation of Key Decisions\n- **Immediate moves (turns 84-86)**: Eating both foods is forced due to the short life span of (4,3) and the lack of safe alternatives. Skipping (4,2) is impossible at turn 85 (only up move is safe), and skipping (4,3) is impossible at turn 86 (only up move is available).\n- **Long-term survival (turns 87-88)**: Moving left to (3,3) at turn 87 avoids instant death and accesses free cells ((3,4), (4,4)) for a few more turns. Moving up to (3,4) at turn 88 continues this path. Beyond this, the snake will eventually trap itself due to its length (23 segments) and limited grid space, but this sequence maximizes survival given the constraints.\n- **Risk avoidance**: The \"tail reward danger\" is not triggered, as the tail ((6,1) after turn 85) is never adjacent to the head when food is eaten. Wall and body collisions are avoided in this sequence.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 85, and I'm the AI playing Snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (5,2).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). Let me plot this to visualize.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction is R (right). So from (4,1), moving right would go to (5,1), but let's see what's there.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,3) with life span 4, value +1\n\n- (4,2) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (2,4) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so all good to eat.\n\nLife span: for (4,3), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including this one, so if not eaten by turn 88, it's gone. Similarly, (4,2) life span 7, disappears after turn 91, and (2,4) life span 10, disappears after turn 94.\n\nCurrent turn is 85.\n\nSnake direction is R, so it just moved right to (4,1)? Positions: head at (4,1), and before that was (3,1), since direction is R, it came from left to (4,1).\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (4,2)), D (down to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so not possible), L (left to (3,1), but that's the body segment, and R (right to (5,1)).\n\nCan I move left? Left to (3,1), which is the second segment. But since the tail will move when I move, it might be okay, as long as I don't collide with body except the tail which moves.\n\nRule: I can move into the cell where the tail is, because the tail moves forward, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,1) – but (3,1) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (6,1), I think.\n\nLet's list snake positions:\n\nIndex 0: (4,1) head\n\n1: (3,1)\n\n2: (3,2)\n\n3: (2,2)\n\n4: (1,2)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (2,3)\n\n7: (2,4)\n\n8: (1,4)\n\n9: (1,5)\n\n10: (2,5)\n\n11: (3,5)\n\n12: (4,5)\n\n13: (4,6)\n\n14: (5,6)\n\n15: (5,5)\n\n16: (5,4)\n\n17: (6,4)\n\n18: (6,3)\n\n19: (6,2)\n\n20: (6,1) tail\n\nSo tail is at (6,1).\n\nNow, from head (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (4,2)\n\n- Down (D) to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Left (L) to (3,1) – which is occupied by segment 1, but since we move, segment 1 will be the new head position if we move left? No.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away.\n\nIf I move left to (3,1), currently occupied by segment 1. After move, head moves to (3,1), and segment 1 moves to where segment 2 was, and so on, down to tail moving to where it was or something.\n\nBut (3,1) is occupied now, but after move, segment 1 will be at (3,2) or something? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn start, positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), etc., tail (6,1).\n\nI choose a direction. Say I move left (L) to (3,1).\n\nThen new head position: (3,1)\n\nThe body: the segment that was at (3,1) moves to where the head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo after moving left:\n\nNew positions: head at (3,1)\n\nThen segment 1 (was at (3,1)) moves to the old position of segment 2? Let's index.\n\nPositions list: let S0 = (4,1), S1 = (3,1), S2 = (3,2), S3 = (2,2), ..., S20 = (6,1)\n\nAfter moving head to new position:\n\nIf move to P, then new head is P, and new body: S0 position becomes S1, S1 position becomes S2, ..., S19 position becomes S20, and S20 is removed? No.\n\nWhen moving without eating, the snake moves: head to new position, and each body segment shifts to the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: new head at new position, then the first body segment moves to old head position, second body to old first body position, and so on, so the last body segment (tail) moves to the position of the second last, and the old tail position is free.\n\nIn terms of indices: after move to new cell P:\n\n- New head: P\n\n- New segment 1: old S0 position\n\n- New segment 2: old S1 position\n\n- ...\n\n- New segment k: old S_{k-1} position for k from 1 to len-1\n\nLet len = number of segments. Here snake has 21 segments? Positions list has 21 elements: from (4,1) to (6,1), that's 21 cells.\n\nIndices: 0 to 20, head at 0, tail at 20.\n\nAfter moving head to a new cell P:\n\n- New head: P\n\n- New body segment 1: old position of segment 0 (head)\n\n- New body segment 2: old position of segment 1\n\n- ...\n\n- New body segment i: old position of segment i-1 for i from 1 to 20? Segment indices.\n\nBetter: the new positions are:\n\n- Head: P\n\n- Segment 1: old head position (S0)\n\n- Segment 2: old segment 1 position (S1)\n\n- ...\n\n- Segment 20: old segment 19 position (S19)\n\nAnd the old tail position (S20) is now empty.\n\nIn this case, for moving to (3,1):\n\nP = (3,1)\n\nOld S0 = (4,1)\n\nOld S1 = (3,1)\n\nBut (3,1) is currently occupied by S1, and I'm moving to it.\n\nAfter move:\n\nNew head: (3,1)\n\nNew segment 1: old S0 = (4,1)\n\nNew segment 2: old S1 = (3,1)? Old S1 is (3,1), but that's the same as P.\n\nConflict.\n\nP = (3,1), which is the current position of S1.\n\nAfter move, new head is at (3,1), which was S1's position.\n\nThen new segment 1 should be at old head position, (4,1)\n\nNew segment 2 should be at old segment 1 position, which is (3,1), but (3,1) is now the head, so it's occupied? No, positions are updated simultaneously.\n\nThe collision is checked before move, I think.\n\nRule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment after move.\n\nBut when moving, if the new head position is a body segment that is not the tail, it collides, because that segment doesn't move away fast enough.\n\nSpecifically, if new head position is a body segment, except if it is the current tail position, because the tail will move.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,1): (3,1) is currently segment 1, which is not the tail. The tail is at (6,1).\n\nSo if I move to (3,1), which is occupied by segment 1, and after move, segment 1 will move to (4,1), but at the moment of move, head is moving to a cell occupied by body, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, only if moving to the tail position, it's ok because tail moves.\n\nSo for (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2): what is at (4,2)? From positions, (4,2) is not listed, so it should be empty? Let's see the positions list: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\n(4,2) is not in the list, so empty.\n\n- D to (4,0): y=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- L to (3,1): currently occupied by segment 1, not tail, so collision if move there\n\n- R to (5,1): what is at (5,1)? Not in positions, so empty? But there is an obstacle at (5,2), but (5,1) is different.\n\nWalls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (5,2). So (5,1) is not wall, not occupied? Positions don't have (5,1), so empty.\n\nBut (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is within bounds, not wall except borders and (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is obstacle, so (5,1) is free.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2) or R to (5,1)\n\nCannot go D or L.\n\nNow, direction is R, so moving U or R is fine, no instant reverse since reverse would be L, which is not possible anyway.\n\nInstant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, which is invalid anyway.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and risks.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (4,3) life 4, value +1\n\n- (4,2) life 7, value +1\n\n- (2,4) life 10, value +1\n\n(4,2) is directly above, at (4,2).\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), I can eat the food there, since it's positive.\n\nBut I need to check for tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, head at (4,1), tail at (6,1). Are they adjacent? (4,1) and (6,1) are two apart in x, same y, so not adjacent; adjacent would be like (5,1) or (4,2) etc.\n\nDistance: |dx| + |dy| =1 for adjacent.\n\n(4,1) to (6,1) |dx|=2, not adjacent.\n\nTail is at (6,1), and no food on tail, I think. Food is at (4,2), (4,3), (2,4), not on tail.\n\nSo if I move to (4,2), I eat the food, since head moves to (4,2) which has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nWhen I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake increases length.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the tail stays, so new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at the position where head was or something.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after move, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? Let's see.\n\nStandard: when head moves to food cell, it eats it, so the head moves to the food cell, and instead of the tail moving away, the tail stays, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at food position, then the body segments shift, but the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to food cell, then the body moves as usual, but since we add a segment, the tail position remains, and we add a new segment at the position where the tail was or something.\n\nCommon implementation: when eating, head moves to food, and the tail does not advance, so the snake gains one segment. The new segment is added at the old tail position, and tail stays there for that turn, but next turn it moves.\n\nFor positions: after eating, new head at food position, new segment 1 at old head, new segment 2 at old segment 1, ..., up to new segment k at old segment k-1 for k=1 to len-1, and then a new segment at the old tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,2) and eat food there.\n\nCurrent positions: head S0=(4,1), S1=(3,1), ..., S20=(6,1)\n\nMove head to (4,2) which has food.\n\nThen new head: (4,2)\n\nNew segment 1: old S0 = (4,1)\n\nNew segment 2: old S1 = (3,1)\n\n...\n\nNew segment 20: old S19 = (6,2)  // old S19 is (6,2)? Positions: S19 is (6,2), S20 is (6,1)\n\nOld positions: S0 to S20.\n\nAfter move and eat:\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nNew seg1: old S0 = (4,1)\n\nNew seg2: old S1 = (3,1)\n\nNew seg3: old S2 = (3,2)\n\n...\n\nNew seg20: old S19 = (6,2)\n\nThen, since we ate food, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so new seg21: old S20 = (6,1)\n\nSo the snake grows to 22 segments, with tail at (6,1)\n\nBut (6,1) was tail, now it's seg21, and new tail is seg21 at (6,1)\n\nIn the sequence, positions are updated.\n\nBut for collision, after move, head is at (4,2), which was empty, so no issue.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nI can go U to (4,2) or R to (5,1)\n\nIf I go U, I eat the food at (4,2), grow, and head is now at (4,2)\n\nIf I go R to (5,1), no food, so just move, head at (5,1), tail moves, etc.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider going U now to eat (4,2).\n\nTurn 85: move U to (4,2), eat food, snake grows.\n\nNew head position: (4,2)\n\nFood (4,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, life span of other food: (4,3) life was 4, turn 85, so after this turn, life decreases by 1, so life=3 on turn 86.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) life=10, decreases to 9 on turn 86.\n\nAfter eating, snake positions: head at (4,2), seg1 at (4,1), seg2 at (3,1), seg3 at (3,2), ..., up to seg21 at (6,1)\n\nOld segments: S0=(4,1), S1=(3,1), S2=(3,2), S3=(2,2), S4=(1,2), S5=(1,3), S6=(2,3), S7=(2,4), S8=(1,4), S9=(1,5), S10=(2,5), S11=(3,5), S12=(4,5), S13=(4,6), S14=(5,6), S15=(5,5), S16=(5,4), S17=(6,4), S18=(6,3), S19=(6,2), S20=(6,1)\n\nAfter move U to (4,2) and eat:\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nNew seg1: old S0 = (4,1)\n\nNew seg2: old S1 = (3,1)\n\nNew seg3: old S2 = (3,2)\n\nNew seg4: old S3 = (2,2)\n\nNew seg5: old S4 = (1,2)\n\nNew seg6: old S5 = (1,3)\n\nNew seg7: old S6 = (2,3)\n\nNew seg8: old S7 = (2,4)  // food at (2,4), but not eaten yet\n\nNew seg9: old S8 = (1,4)\n\nNew seg10: old S9 = (1,5)\n\nNew seg11: old S10 = (2,5)\n\nNew seg12: old S11 = (3,5)\n\nNew seg13: old S12 = (4,5)\n\nNew seg14: old S13 = (4,6)\n\nNew seg15: old S14 = (5,6)\n\nNew seg16: old S15 = (5,5)\n\nNew seg17: old S16 = (5,4)\n\nNew seg18: old S17 = (6,4)\n\nNew seg19: old S18 = (6,3)\n\nNew seg20: old S19 = (6,2)\n\nNew seg21: old S20 = (6,1)  // added segment\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nNow, head at (4,2), direction from previous move is U (up), since we moved up.\n\nCurrent head direction after move is U.\n\nNow, from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): there is food at (4,3), life 4, value +1\n\n- D to (4,1): but (4,1) is now segment 1, body segment, not tail. Tail is at (6,1). So moving to (4,1) would collide with body.\n\n- L to (3,2): (3,2) is now segment 3, which is body, not tail.\n\n- R to (5,2): but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (4,3), which has food.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), I eat the food there.\n\nThen snake grows again.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nHead at (4,2), tail at (6,1), not adjacent.\n\nMove U to (4,3), eat food.\n\nAfter that, head at (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut let's see the grid; after eating (4,3), I might be in a tight spot.\n\nFirst, turn 85: move U to (4,2), eat (4,2)\n\nTurn 86: from (4,2), only possible move U to (4,3), eat (4,3)\n\nNow, after turn 86: head at (4,3)\n\nFood eaten, so (4,3) removed.\n\nOther food: (2,4) life was 10, after turn 85 it decreased to 9, after turn 86 to 8? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn when it exists.\n\nAt turn 85, food (4,3) life=4, after turn 85, life=3; at turn 86, if not eaten, life=2, but we eat it on turn 86, so it's eaten before life decrease? Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd eating happens when head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,3) at turn 85, life=4. On turn 85, if not eaten, life decreases to 3 at end of turn. But if eaten during turn, no decrease.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 86, if present, life decreases.\n\nBut for (4,3), if eaten on turn 86, it was present at start of turn 86 with life=3? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn t: at start, food has life span L.\n\nDuring turn, if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n\nAfter the move, if food not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life span becomes 0, food disappears.\n\nIn this case, for (4,3) at turn 85: life=4.\n\nIf not eaten on turn 85, at end of turn, life decreases to 3.\n\nIf eaten on turn 85, it is removed.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn my earlier plan, on turn 85, I move to (4,2), eat (4,2), so (4,2) removed.\n\n(4,3) still there, life=4 at turn 85 start, not eaten on turn 85, so after turn 85, life decreases to 3.\n\nOn turn 86, (4,3) has life=3.\n\nI move U to (4,3), eat it, so removed.\n\nNow, after eating on turn 86:\n\nPositions: from before, after turn 85, positions with 22 segments: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nAfter move U to (4,3) and eat:\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,2)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,1)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,1)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (3,2)\n\n...\n\nNew seg21: old seg20 (6,2)\n\nNew seg22: old seg21 (6,1)  // added segment\n\nSo tail at (6,1)\n\nNow head at (4,3)\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,4): what is there? Not in positions, so empty? But walls: y=7 is wall, but (4,4) is within bounds.\n\n- D to (4,2): but (4,2) is now seg1, body segment, not tail.\n\n- L to (3,3): not in positions, so empty.\n\n- R to (5,3): (5,3) not in positions, but obstacle at (5,2), not (5,3), so free? (5,3) is not wall, not occupied.\n\nWalls: x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and (5,2). So (5,3) is free.\n\nAlso, (3,3) should be free.\n\nBut let's see the positions: after move, positions include (4,3) head, (4,2) seg1, (4,1) seg2, (3,1) seg3, (3,2) seg4, etc.\n\n(3,3) is not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly (5,3) empty.\n\n(4,4) empty.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but occupied, invalid, L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nD is invalid because (4,2) is body.\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\nNow, current direction: after moving U, direction is U.\n\nNo instant reverse, so cannot move D, which is reverse, but D is invalid anyway.\n\nSo I can move U, L, or R.\n\nNow, where to go? I need to consider the remaining food.\n\nFood left: (2,4) with life 10, at turn 85 start, not eaten turn 85 or 86, so after turn 85, life=9, after turn 86, life=8? At turn 86 start, (2,4) life=9 (since decreased after turn 85), after turn 86, if not eaten, life=8.\n\nBut (2,4) is currently occupied? In the positions, before turn 86 move, (2,4) is seg8, I think.\n\nIn the positions after turn 85 (before turn 86 move), (2,4) is position of seg8, which is body segment.\n\nFood at (2,4) is on the body.\n\nRule: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSo (2,4) has food, but it's under seg8, so to eat it, we need that segment to move away, then head move to it.\n\nIn this case, on turn 86, when I move, seg8 is at (2,4), but when I move the head, the body shifts, so seg8 will move to a new position.\n\nAfter I move on turn 86 to (4,3), the body shifts, so seg8 (which was at (2,4)) moves to where seg7 was? Let's see.\n\nBefore turn 86 move, positions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (3,1), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (1,2), seg6 (1,3), seg7 (2,3), seg8 (2,4), etc.\n\nAfter move to (4,3) and eat, new positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (2,2), seg6 (1,2), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,4), etc. seg8 is now at (2,3), which was old seg7 position.\n\nFood at (2,4) is still there, and now (2,4) is empty because seg8 moved to (2,3).\n\nSo (2,4) is free and has food.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 87, I can move to it if possible.\n\nBack to turn 86 after move, head at (4,3), and I need to choose move for turn 87? No, I'm planning from turn 85.\n\nLet's outline the turns.\n\nAt turn 85: I move U to (4,2), eat (4,2)\n\nThen turn 86: I must move U to (4,3), eat (4,3) because only move.\n\nThen turn 87: head at (4,3), with possible moves U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nFood at (2,4) is available, life span decreasing.\n\n(2,4) from turn 85: life=10\n\nTurn 85: not eaten, after turn 85 life=9\n\nTurn 86: not eaten, after turn 86 life=8\n\nAt turn 87 start, life=8.\n\nI can go towards (2,4).\n\nFor example, move L to (3,3), then from there to (2,3) or something.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), so from (4,3), moving L to (3,3), then I can go to (3,4) or (2,3), etc.\n\nBut there might be body segments.\n\nFirst, from (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), that should be empty.\n\nThen head to (3,3), no food there.\n\nThen from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but that's previous head, now body? After move to (3,3), positions shift.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3) from (4,3), then to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,4) is body? Current positions after turn 86: head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (2,2), seg6 (1,2), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,4), seg10 (1,5), seg11 (2,5), seg12 (3,5), seg13 (4,5), seg14 (4,6), seg15 (5,6), seg16 (5,5), seg17 (5,4), seg18 (6,4), seg19 (6,3), seg20 (6,2), seg21 (6,1), seg22 (6,1)? After turn 86 eat, we have 23 segments? Let's count.\n\nAfter turn 85: 22 segments\n\nAfter turn 86 eat: new head, new seg1 to seg21 from old, and new seg22 at old tail, so 23 segments.\n\nBut positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (2,2), seg6 (1,2), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,4), seg10 (1,5), seg11 (2,5), seg12 (3,5), seg13 (4,5), seg14 (4,6), seg15 (5,6), seg16 (5,5), seg17 (5,4), seg18 (6,4), seg19 (6,3), seg20 (6,2), seg21 (6,1), seg22 (6,1) no, old tail was at (6,1), new seg22 at (6,1)\n\nBut seg21 is at (6,1), and seg22 at (6,1)? That can't be.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nAfter eating on turn 86:\n\nNew head at (4,3)\n\nNew body:\n\n- Seg1 at old head position: (4,2)\n\n- Seg2 at old seg1 position: (4,1)\n\n- Seg3 at old seg2 position: (3,1)\n\n- Seg4 at old seg3 position: (3,2)\n\n- Seg5 at old seg4 position: (2,2)\n\n- Seg6 at old seg5 position: (1,2)\n\n- Seg7 at old seg6 position: (1,3)\n\n- Seg8 at old seg7 position: (2,3)  // (2,3) was old seg7? Before move, seg7 was at (2,3)? Let's list old positions before turn 86 move.\n\nBefore turn 86 move (after turn 85):\n\nPositions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (3,1), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (1,2), seg6 (1,3), seg7 (2,3), seg8 (2,4), seg9 (1,4), seg10 (1,5), seg11 (2,5), seg12 (3,5), seg13 (4,5), seg14 (4,6), seg15 (5,6), seg16 (5,5), seg17 (5,4), seg18 (6,4), seg19 (6,3), seg20 (6,2), seg21 (6,1)\n\nSo seg7 is at (2,3), seg8 at (2,4), etc.\n\nAfter move to (4,3) and eat:\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,2)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,1)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,1)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (3,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (2,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (1,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (1,3)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (2,3)  // so (2,3)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (2,4)  // (2,4), but there is food at (2,4), but we didn't move to it, so not eaten.\n\nNew seg9 at (2,4), so the food is under the body again.\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (1,4)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (1,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (2,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (3,5)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (4,5)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (4,6)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (5,6)\n\nNew seg17: old seg16 (5,5)\n\nNew seg18: old seg17 (5,4)\n\nNew seg19: old seg18 (6,4)\n\nNew seg20: old seg19 (6,3)\n\nNew seg21: old seg20 (6,2)\n\nNew seg22: old seg21 (6,1)  // added segment\n\nSo now food at (2,4) is under seg9 position.\n\nTo eat it, we need seg9 to move away and head to move to (2,4).\n\nFrom head at (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then L to (2,4), for example.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 87, head at (4,3), I can move L to (3,3)\n\nThen new head (3,3), no food.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) or L to (2,3) or R to (4,3) but reverse, invalid if direction is L.\n\nAfter moving L to (3,3), direction is L.\n\nThen from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is seg4, body, invalid, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but that's reverse, and current direction L, so R is opposite, instant reverse not allowed, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, (2,3) is seg8, body, so moving to (2,3) would collide.\n\nPositions: after move to (3,3), seg1 at (4,3), which was head, but now body.\n\n(2,3) is seg8, body.\n\n(3,4) might be empty.\n\nSo from (3,3), only possible move is U to (3,4), since D and L and R are invalid.\n\nD to (3,2) occupied, L to (2,3) occupied, R to (4,3) occupied and reverse.\n\nSo only U to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4), no food.\n\nThen from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(2,4) has food, but is it occupied? Currently, seg9 is at (2,4), but after moves, it might move.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 87: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)\n\nAfter move, no eat, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,2)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,1)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (3,1)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (2,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (1,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (1,3)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (2,3)  // was (2,3)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (2,4)  // (2,4)\n\n etc.\n\nSeg9 at (2,4), with food, but not eaten.\n\nNow head at (3,3)\n\nFrom (3,3), as above, only U to (3,4) possible.\n\nTurn 88: move U to (3,4)\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,2)\n\n...\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (2,3)  // seg8 was at (2,3), so new seg9 at (2,3)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (2,4)  // (2,4)\n\n etc.\n\nNow (2,4) is at new seg10 position, food still there.\n\nHead at (3,4)\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(2,4) is occupied by seg10, body, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nR to (4,4) might be empty.\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) is seg12 or something, let's see positions.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (3,1), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (2,2), seg8 (1,2), seg9 (1,3), seg10 (2,3), seg11 (2,4)? New seg11 at old seg10 position.\n\nAfter move to (3,4):\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (4,1)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,1)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (3,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (2,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (1,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (1,3)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (2,3)  // (2,3)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (2,4)  // (2,4)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,5)  // etc.\n\nSo (3,5) not occupied, should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) empty.\n\n(2,4) occupied by seg11.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4) occupied, invalid, R to (4,4), D to (3,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf U to (3,5), (3,5) may have body? Not in positions, so empty.\n\nSimilarly R to (4,4) empty.\n\nIf I go U to (3,5), then I can go to (3,6) or something, but (3,5) might be close to other parts.\n\nBut I want to eat (2,4), which is at (2,4), occupied by seg11.\n\nTo eat it, I need to wait for seg11 to move away and head to move there.\n\nBut seg11 will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move to (4,4) from (3,4), then later to (4,5) or something.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and the snake is long, so it might be risky to go into the body area.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,4) has life span, at turn 87 start, life=8? Let's track life span.\n\nTurn 85 start: (2,4) life=10\n\nTurn 85: not eaten, after turn 85 life=9\n\nTurn 86: not eaten, after turn 86 life=8\n\nTurn 87: not eaten, after turn 87 life=7\n\nTurn 88: not eaten, after turn 88 life=6\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut in my earlier sequence, by turn 88, (2,4) is still under body, not eaten.\n\nIf I go to (4,4) on turn 88, from (3,4) move R to (4,4)\n\nThen head at (4,4), no food.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (4,3) but occupied, or left to (3,4) occupied, or right to (5,4) or up to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is seg13, body.\n\nPositions: head at (4,4), seg1 at (3,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps going U at turn 85 is not the best because I get stuck eating two food quickly and then the snake is large in a small space.\n\nAlternative: at turn 85, instead of U, I can move R to (5,1)\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 85: move R to (5,1)\n\nNo food there, so just move, no grow.\n\nNew head: (5,1)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,1)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,1)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,2)\n\n... and so on, up to new seg20: old seg19 (6,2)\n\nNew seg21: old seg20 (6,1)  // tail moves, no new segment\n\nOld tail (6,1) vacated.\n\nSnake length same, 21 segments.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,1):\n\n- U to (5,2): but (5,2) is wall, internal obstacle, invalid\n\n- D to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L to (4,1): which is now seg1, body segment, not tail\n\n- R to (6,1): but (6,1) is old tail, now vacated, so empty? But after move, (6,1) is empty, but moving to (6,1): is it occupied? Currently, before move, (6,1) is tail, but after move, it's empty.\n\nMoving to (6,1): since it was tail, and tail moves, so moving to the tail position is allowed, no collision.\n\nRule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nSo R to (6,1) should be possible.\n\nAlso, U and D invalid, L to (4,1) occupied, so only R to (6,1)\n\nMove R to (6,1)\n\nThen new head at (6,1), which was tail.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (3,2), ..., seg20 (6,2), seg21 (6,3)? Old positions before move: head (5,1), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (3,1), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (2,2), ..., seg19 (6,3), seg20 (6,2), seg21 (6,1)? After turn 85 move, we have 21 segments.\n\nBefore turn 85 move: 21 positions.\n\nAfter move R to (5,1) no eat: new head (5,1), new seg1 (4,1), new seg2 (3,1), new seg3 (3,2), new seg4 (2,2), new seg5 (1,2), new seg6 (1,3), new seg7 (2,3), new seg8 (2,4), new seg9 (1,4), new seg10 (1,5), new seg11 (2,5), new seg12 (3,5), new seg13 (4,5), new seg14 (4,6), new seg15 (5,6), new seg16 (5,5), new seg17 (5,4), new seg18 (6,4), new seg19 (6,3), new seg20 (6,2), and old tail (6,1) vacated.\n\nSo tail was at (6,1), now seg20 at (6,2), and (6,1) empty.\n\nNow from (5,1), only move R to (6,1), which is empty, so move there.\n\nTurn 86: move R to (6,1)\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nNew seg1: old head (5,1)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,1)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,1)\n\n...\n\nNew seg20: old seg19 (6,3)\n\nNew seg21: old seg20 (6,2)\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (6,1), direction R.\n\nNow from (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,2): but (6,2) is now seg21, tail position. Moving to tail is allowed, since tail will move.\n\n- D to (6,0): wall, invalid\n\n- L to (5,1): now seg1, body, not tail\n\n- R to (7,1): x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only U to (6,2) or L to (5,1) but L invalid, so only U to (6,2)\n\nMove U to (6,2), which is tail, so no collision.\n\nNo food, so just move.\n\nNew head (6,2), new seg1 (6,1), new seg2 (5,1), etc., tail moves to (6,3) or something.\n\nPositions: new head (6,2), new seg1 old head (6,1), new seg2 old seg1 (5,1), ..., new seg21 old seg20 (6,3)\n\nOld seg20 was (6,3)? Before move, seg19 (6,3), seg20 (6,2), seg21 (6,1) no, after previous, we have seg20 at (6,2), seg21 at (6,1)? Let's not.\n\nAfter turn 86 move to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (2,2), seg6 (1,2), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (2,4), seg10 (1,4), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (2,5), seg13 (3,5), seg14 (4,5), seg15 (4,6), seg16 (5,6), seg17 (5,5), seg18 (5,4), seg19 (6,4), seg20 (6,3), seg21 (6,2)\n\nThen move U to (6,2), which is seg21, tail.\n\nNew head: (6,2)\n\nNew seg1: old head (6,1)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (5,1)\n\n...\n\nNew seg21: old seg20 (6,3)\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\nHead at (6,2), direction U.\n\nNow from (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,3): (6,3) is now tail, so can move there\n\n- D to (6,1): now seg1, body, invalid\n\n- L to (5,2): but (5,2) is wall, invalid\n\n- R to (7,2): x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only U to (6,3)\n\nMove U to (6,3), tail position.\n\nAnd so on, I'm forced to move up along the right wall, but (6,3) is tail, move to it, then to (6,4), but (6,4) is body? After move to (6,3), new head (6,3), new seg1 (6,2), new seg2 (6,1), etc., and new seg21 at old seg20 (6,4)? Before move, seg19 (6,4), seg20 (6,3), seg21 (6,2)\n\nAfter move to (6,3): new head (6,3), new seg1 (6,2), new seg2 (6,1), new seg3 (5,1), ..., new seg21 old seg20 (6,4)\n\nSo (6,4) is now seg21.\n\nThen from (6,3), move U to (6,4), which is seg21, tail, so ok.\n\nThen to (6,5), and so on, up to (6,6), but y=7 wall, so at (6,6), move U to (6,7) invalid, so I need to turn, but it's tight.\n\nBut I'm not getting food, and the food is decaying.\n\nIn this path, I'm not eating any food, so score not increasing, and food might disappear.\n\nBack to turn 85, I have two choices: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1)\n\nIf I go U, I eat (4,2) and then forced to eat (4,3), then at (4,3) I have choices but the snake is longer and in a crowded area.\n\nIf I go R, I go to the right and up, but no food, and I might get stuck.\n\nThere is food at (4,2) and (4,3) with short life, so I should eat them before they disappear.\n\n(4,3) life 4, so if not eaten by turn 88, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life 7, longer.\n\nBut (2,4) life 10, longer.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,2) and (4,3) quickly, then go for (2,4).\n\nAt turn 85: move U to (4,2) eat (4,2)\n\nTurn 86: move U to (4,3) eat (4,3)\n\nThen turn 87: head at (4,3), with moves U, L, R possible.\n\nInstead of going left, I can go right to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is free, as we saw.\n\nMove R to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), no food.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) wall, L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3) occupied or not.\n\nPositions after turn 87 move to (5,3):\n\nAfter turn 86: head at (4,3), etc.\n\nTurn 87: move R to (5,3) no eat.\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,2)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,1)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (3,1)\n\n etc.\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nFrom (5,3), moves:\n\n- U to (5,4): possible\n\n- D to (5,2): wall, invalid\n\n- L to (4,3): now seg1, body, invalid\n\n- R to (6,3): now seg19 or something, body? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter move, seg1 at (4,3), seg2 at (4,2), seg3 at (4,1), seg4 at (3,1), seg5 at (3,2), seg6 at (2,2), seg7 at (1,2), seg8 at (1,3), seg9 at (2,3), seg10 at (2,4), etc., seg19 at (6,3), I think.\n\nFrom earlier, after turn 86, we have segments at various positions, including (6,3) as seg19 or something.\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied, so R to (6,3) invalid.\n\nU to (5,4) might be free.\n\nSo only U to (5,4)\n\nMove U to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) has body? In positions, (5,4) is seg17 or something.\n\nBefore move, at turn 87 start, positions include (5,4) as seg17.\n\nSo moving to (5,4) would collide.\n\nAfter turn 86, positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (2,2), seg6 (1,2), seg7 (1,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (2,4), seg10 (1,4), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (2,5), seg13 (3,5), seg14 (4,5), seg15 (4,6), seg16 (5,6), seg17 (5,5), seg18 (5,4), seg19 (6,4), seg20 (6,3), seg21 (6,2), seg22 (6,1)\n\nSo (5,4) is seg18 position.\n\nSo if I move to (5,4), it is occupied by seg18, not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3), U to (5,4) occupied, D invalid, L invalid, R to (6,3) occupied by seg20, invalid.\n\nNo possible moves! Dead end.\n\nAt turn 87, from (4,3), if I move R to (5,3), then from (5,3), no possible moves, snake dies.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (4,4) from (4,3), (4,4) might be free, but then from there, I might have moves.\n\nAt turn 87, head at (4,3), move U to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) empty.\n\nNew head (4,4)\n\nNew seg1 (4,3)\n\n etc.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\n(4,5) is seg13, body\n\n(3,4) might be empty\n\n(5,4) is seg18, body\n\nSo only L to (3,4) possible, if empty.\n\n(3,4) not in positions, so empty.\n\nMove L to (3,4)\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut I need to reach (2,4) food.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid eating (4,2) and (4,3) immediately and go for a different path.\n\nAt turn 85, I can only choose U or R.\n\nIf I choose R, I go to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (6,2), etc., but no food.\n\nBut I can turn when possible.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), after moving there, I could have moved L or U, but in the sequence, at (6,1), I had to move U to (6,2), then from (6,2) to (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom (6,2), I could move L to (5,2) but (5,2) wall, so no.\n\nSo I'm stuck moving up the right column.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps at turn 85, move U to (4,2), but then at turn 86, instead of moving U to (4,3), I have to, because no choice.\n\nUnless after eating (4,2), at (4,2), I have only U possible, as we saw.\n\nSo the only choice is at turn 85 to go U or R.\n\nGoing U allows me to eat food, but risks getting stuck.\n\nGoing R avoids immediate food but might lead to dead end.\n\nBut there is food at (2,4) with longer life.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 85, move U to (4,2) eat, then at turn 86 move U to (4,3) eat, then at turn 87 from (4,3) move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then L to (2,4) but (2,4) is occupied at that time.\n\nEarlier when I went to (3,4), (2,4) was occupied.\n\nBut if I go directly to (2,4) from (3,4), I can't because it's occupied.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) at turn 87, move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then from (3,4) move U to (3,5), then L to (2,5) or something.\n\n(2,5) has food? No, food at (2,4).\n\n(2,5) is seg11 or something.\n\nLet's list the positions after turn 86: head at (4,3), with body around.\n\nThe area near (2,4) is occupied by the body, so it's hard to reach without colliding.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the food on (4,2) and (4,3) and leave them, but they have short life, so I should eat them.\n\nOr maybe I can eat one and not the other, but at turn 86, I have to eat (4,3) because no choice.\n\nUnless at turn 85, I don't move U.\n\nBut if I move R, I don't eat any food.\n\nLet's see the grid size: 8x8, snake length 21, so almost full, only a few cells empty.\n\nGrid has 64 cells, walls: borders are walls, so playable area is 6x6=36 cells? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Borders at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, 36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2), so 35 playable cells.\n\nSnake has 21 segments, so 14 empty cells.\n\nFood at (4,2), (4,3), (2,4), but (2,4) is under body.\n\nAfter eating food, snake grows, so more crowded.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat (4,2) and (4,3) to score points before they disappear, then try to survive.\n\nBut after eating, at (4,3), I need to move to a safe cell.\n\nFrom (4,3), moving L to (3,3) is safe, then U to (3,4) safe, then from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), (3,5) is not occupied, so ok.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) may be occupied.\n\nPositions after turn 87 move to (3,3): let's not simulate full.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to follow the tail or something to avoid collision.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,4). It is under body, so I need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (2,4).\n\nFor example, if I move the head away, the tail might move, but it takes time.\n\nCurrent tail at (6,1), (2,4) is far.\n\nLife span of (2,4) is 10, so I have time.\n\nAt turn 85, if I move R to (5,1), then to (6,1), then U to (6,2), etc., I'm moving the tail, so eventually the body might shift.\n\nBut it's slow.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should go for the food with longer life.\n\nBut (4,3) will disappear soon.\n\nLet's list all empty cells to see possible paths.\n\nBut that's hard without grid.\n\nNotice that at (4,1), I can move U or R.\n\nIf I move U, I get food but risk.\n\nIf I move R, I go to the right, and I can later go up to (6,6) or something.\n\nBut at (6,1), move U to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (6,4), but (6,4) is body, but when I move to (6,3), then to (6,4) is tail, then to (6,5), etc.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) might be body.\n\nBut eventually, I can reach the top.\n\nThen from there, I can go left to the food.\n\nFor example, at turn 85: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 86: move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 87: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 88: move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 89: move U to (6,4)  // if tail, ok\n\nAfter turn 88: head at (6,3), then move U to (6,4), which may be tail.\n\nThen from (6,4), move U to (6,5), and so on, to (6,6).\n\nAt (6,6), move L to (5,6), which may be body or not.\n\nAt turn 85 start, (5,6) is seg14.\n\nBut after moves, it changes.\n\nAfter several moves up, the tail moves, so (5,6) might be free.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I should accept eating the nearby food.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 85, move U to (4,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 86: move U to (4,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 87: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)  -- this is safe\n\nThen turn 88: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)  -- only move\n\nThen turn 89: from (3,4) move U to (3,5)  -- assuming (3,5) empty\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5)\n\n(2,5) may have food or not, but food is at (2,4).\n\n(2,4) might be free by then.\n\nAt turn 89, head at (3,5), move L to (2,5), if empty.\n\n(2,5) is seg11 or something, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nThen from (2,5), move D to (2,4) to eat food.\n\nBut (2,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's assume that after many moves, the body has moved.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps for the answer, I can plan to eat the food.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but for the output, I need to specify actions for current turn and future turns, but I don't know future states, so I need to plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I need to commit to a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output a sequence that eats the food and then moves to open space.\n\nLet's decide to move U at turn 85 to eat (4,2).\n\nThen turn 86 move U to eat (4,3).\n\nThen at turn 87, from (4,3), I have to choose a move.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nR to (5,3) might lead to dead end, as earlier.\n\nU to (4,4): (4,4) empty, so move there.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) but (4,5) body, or R to (5,4) body.\n\nSo only L to (3,4)\n\nSimilarly, L to (3,4) might be empty.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut to output, for turn 87, I can choose L to (3,3) or U to (4,4).\n\nLet's say I choose L to (3,3) for turn 87.\n\nThen turn 88 U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 89 U to (3,5)\n\n etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps for simplicity, since moving U at turn 85 allows me to eat two food immediately, I should do that.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can say:\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U (forced)\n\nTurn 87: L (to (3,3))\n\nThen for turn 88 and 89, I can assume moves.\n\nBut the state changes, so I need to specify based on current.\n\nI think for the output, I need to provide actions for a few turns, but since the state changes, I can provide the first few actions.\n\nThe format says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\" so I can provide multiple.\n\nBut let's do 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 85.\n\nAction for turn 85: U to (4,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 86: U to (4,3) eat.\n\nTurn 87: from (4,3), I choose to move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 88: from (3,3), move U to (3,4) (only move)\n\nTurn 89: from (3,4), move U to (3,5) (assuming empty)\n\nBut at turn 89, it might not be empty, but in this state, it should be.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut to be safe, I can move R at turn 85 to avoid the crowd, but then I don't eat food.\n\nLet's calculate the score.\n\nIf I eat (4,2) and (4,3), I get +2 score.\n\nIf I don't, they disappear, and I might eat (2,4) later.\n\nBut (2,4) is +1, so less.\n\nAlso, (4,2) and (4,3) have short life, so better to eat them.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake is longer, but I can manage.\n\nSo I think going U is better.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nThen for turn 87, from (4,3), I need to choose L or U or R.\n\nR to (5,3) is dangerous, U to (4,4) then to (3,4), L to (3,3) then to (3,4).\n\nSimilar.\n\nI think L to (3,3) is fine.\n\nThen the actions can be:\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: L\n\nTurn 88: U (from (3,3) to (3,4))\n\nTurn 89: U (from (3,4) to (3,5))\n\nBut at turn 89, from (3,4) to (3,5), it should be ok.\n\nThen I can reach (2,4) later.\n\nFor the output, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for as many as I can, but I think 5 turns is enough.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: L\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nBut turn 88 and 89 depend on state.\n\nPerhaps I should only output for turns I can commit.\n\nSince after turn 86, state changes, but for the sequence, I can provide based on plan.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will prioritize eating the positive food at (4,2) and (4,3) due to their short life spans (4 turns for (4,3) and 7 for (4,2) at turn 85), as they will disappear soon if not eaten. Eating them immediately scores +2 and grows the snake by 2 segments. After eating, I will navigate towards safer areas to avoid collisions and position for potential future food at (2,4), which has a longer life span (10 turns at turn 85).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 85)**:\n  - Snake head at (4,1), direction R.\n  - Possible moves: U (to (4,2)) or R (to (5,1)). Moving U eats food at (4,2) (+1 score, length +1).\n- **Turn 86**: After moving U to (4,2), head is at (4,2) with direction U. Only possible move is U to (4,3) to eat food there (+1 score, length +1). Moving to (4,3) is safe as the tail is distant.\n- **Turn 87**: Head at (4,3) with direction U. Possible moves: U (to (4,4)), L (to (3,3)), or R (to (5,3)). Moving R to (5,3) risks collision with body segments (e.g., (5,4) is occupied). Moving U to (4,4) is safe but limits future options. Moving L to (3,3) opens a path toward the left side, avoiding crowded areas and positioning for (2,4) food later.\n- **Turn 88**: Head at (3,3) with direction L. Only possible move is U to (3,4) (D, L, R are invalid due to body or direction constraints).\n- **Turn 89**: Head at (3,4) with direction U. Move U to (3,5) to continue toward open space and potentially approach (2,4) food in future turns. (3,5) is expected to be empty based on current body positions.\n- **5+ Turn Outlook**: After turn 89, the snake can navigate to (3,6) or (2,5) to reach the food at (2,4) once the body segment moves away (life span allows until turn 94). Survival is prioritized by staying in open areas and avoiding the dense body cluster on the right.\n\n### Action Plan (5 Turns):\nThis sequence eats both short-life food items immediately, scores +2, and then moves to safer, less crowded areas for long-term survival. The moves are feasible based on the grid and snake positions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: L\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 86. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head at (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). That's 22 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nThe head direction is \"U\", which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- (4,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this one, so if not eaten by turn 88, it's gone.\n\n- (2,4) with value 1 and life span 9. So it has more time, until turn 94 or something? Life span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns from now, so at turn 86 + 9 = 95, but since countdown decreases each turn including current, it should be gone on turn 95? Let me clarify the life span.\n\nThe rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? No.\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So if at turn t, life span is L, then:\n\n- After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n\n- After turn t+1, countdown becomes L-2, and so on.\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on the turn when countdown is 1, and disappears after that turn.\n\nFor example, food with life span 3 at turn 86:\n\n- Turn 86: life span 3, can be eaten, countdown to 2 after this turn.\n\n- Turn 87: life span 2, can be eaten, countdown to 1.\n\n- Turn 88: life span 1, can be eaten, and after this turn, it disappears (countdown 0).\n\n- So it exists from turn 86 to 88 inclusive, and disappears before turn 89.\n\nSimilarly, for life span 9 at turn 86:\n\n- Exists from turn 86 to 94 inclusive (9 turns: 86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94), disappears before turn 95.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (4,3): value +1, life span 3\n\n- (2,4): value +1, life span 9\n\nBoth are positive food, since value is 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Walls: borders and (5,2).\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), moving up (U). So next possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so I cannot move D next.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are occupied by snake.\n\nList all snake segments in order:\n\nIndex 0: (4,2) head\n\n1: (4,1)\n\n2: (3,1)\n\n3: (3,2)\n\n4: (2,2)\n\n5: (1,2)\n\n6: (1,3)\n\n7: (2,3)\n\n8: (2,4)  // this is where one food is? (2,4) is a food position, but also a snake segment?\n\nFood is at (2,4), and snake has a segment at (2,4) at position index 8.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo here, food is at (2,4), which is currently occupied by the snake's body segment at index 8. So to eat it, the snake must move such that this body segment moves away, and then the head moves to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (4,3) is not occupied by snake, I think? Let me check snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nNow, (4,3) is not in this list, so it's free. (2,4) is in the list, occupied.\n\nFood at (2,4) is under the body.\n\nAlso, note that (2,4) is the tail? No, tail is at (6,1). Let's see the positions: head (4,2), then body, tail is (6,1). Position 21 is (6,1), since list has 22 segments? Indices from 0 to 21.\n\n0: (4,2)\n\n1: (4,1)\n\n2: (3,1)\n\n3: (3,2)\n\n4: (2,2)\n\n5: (1,2)\n\n6: (1,3)\n\n7: (2,3)\n\n8: (2,4)  // food here\n\n9: (1,4)\n\n10: (1,5)\n\n11: (2,5)\n\n12: (3,5)\n\n13: (4,5)\n\n14: (4,6)\n\n15: (5,6)\n\n16: (5,5)\n\n17: (5,4)\n\n18: (6,4)\n\n19: (6,3)\n\n20: (6,2)\n\n21: (6,1)  // tail\n\nSo (2,4) is segment 8, not tail. Tail is (6,1).\n\nFood at (2,4) is under the body, so it can only be eaten if that segment moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,3) is not occupied, so it can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), moving U. So from (4,2), moving U would go to (4,3). But (4,3) has food! So if I move U, I go to (4,3), eat the food, since it's positive, snake length increases by 1.\n\nBut I need to think about risks and long-term.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (4,2):\n\n- U: to (4,3) — has food, eat it, grow by one.\n\n- L: to (3,2) — but (3,2) is a body segment! Index 3 is (3,2). So moving left to (3,2) would collide with body, deadly.\n\n- R: to (5,2) — but (5,2) is an internal obstacle? Walls include (5,2) as internal obstacle. \"Internal Obstacles: [(5,2)]\", so (5,2) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3) — which has food, and not occupied by body currently? Snake positions: (4,3) is not listed, so free, except for food.\n\n- L: to (3,2) — occupied by body segment, collision.\n\n- R: to (5,2) — wall, collision.\n\n- D: but cannot, instant reverse from U.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (4,3). Is that right?\n\nU is up, (x,y) to (x,y+1), so (4,2) to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, and it's not a snake segment, so I can move there and eat it.\n\nBut is there any danger? After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, so the new position will be head at (4,3), and body segments follow.\n\nBut let's confirm: when you eat food, you grow, so after moving to food, the head is there, and you add a new segment, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut in terms of collision, since you grow, the segment that was tail remains, so if head moves to where tail was, it might be ok, but here it's not the tail.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,3) should be safe, since no body there except after moving.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,3), the head is at (4,3), and since you eat food, the snake grows, so the new body segments: the previous head (4,2) becomes body, and so on, but tail (6,1) remains, since no movement at tail when growing.\n\nI need to simulate the move.\n\nBut for now, from (4,2), only possible move without immediate death is U to (4,3).\n\nL to (3,2) is body, R to (5,2) is wall, D not allowed.\n\nSo I must move U to (4,3) and eat the food.\n\nThen, after that, the snake length increases to 23 segments.\n\nBut the food at (4,3) has life span 3, but at turn 86, it's present, so I can eat it now.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 86.\n\nThe output should be for turn 86, then 87, etc., up to 5+ turns ahead.\n\nBut since I have to decide for each turn, I need a plan.\n\nFirst, at turn 86, I must move U to (4,3).\n\nThen, at turn 87, head is at (4,3), and I just ate food, so length increased. Direction: since I moved U, now head direction is U.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: U, L, R, D. But current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) because instant reverse.\n\nPossible: U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3), or D but not allowed.\n\nNow, what is around (4,3)?\n\nFirst, (4,4): is it free? Snake positions: after moving to (4,3) and growing, the snake segments: new head (4,3), then previous head (4,2) now body, then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and since grew, tail is still (6,1), no: when you eat, you add a segment, so the tail remains where it was, and a new segment is added at the tail? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you move to a food cell, you eat it, so the head moves to the food, and since you grow, the tail does not move that turn. So the snake gains one segment.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, head at (4,2), body to tail (6,1).\n\nAfter move U to (4,3): head at (4,3), and the body segments are: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), etc., down to (6,1), but since you grow, the tail doesn't advance, so the last segment stays. So the new positions: head at (4,3), then body: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail (6,1) remains, so now segments from (4,3) to (6,1), with 23 segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal 22 segments: indices 0 to 21.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (4,3), so new head position. Then the body: segment 0 was (4,2) now at position 1, segment 1 was (4,1) now at position 2, and so on, up to segment 21 (6,1) now at position 22? Since we grow, we add a new segment at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nSequence: when you eat food, after moving head to new position, the body follows, but since growth, the tail stays, so the new body has the previous head position, and all previous body positions, with tail fixed.\n\nSo positions after eating at (4,3):\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1: previous head (4,2)\n\n- Segment 2: previous segment 1 (4,1)\n\n- Segment 3: previous segment 2 (3,1)\n\n- Segment 4: previous segment 3 (3,2)\n\n- Segment 5: previous segment 4 (2,2)\n\n- Segment 6: previous segment 5 (1,2)\n\n- Segment 7: previous segment 6 (1,3)\n\n- Segment 8: previous segment 7 (2,3)\n\n- Segment 9: previous segment 8 (2,4)  // but (2,4) has food under it, but now it's a body segment.\n\n- Segment 10: previous segment 9 (1,4)\n\n- Segment 11: previous segment 10 (1,5)\n\n- Segment 12: previous segment 11 (2,5)\n\n- Segment 13: previous segment 12 (3,5)\n\n- Segment 14: previous segment 13 (4,5)\n\n- Segment 15: previous segment 14 (4,6)\n\n- Segment 16: previous segment 15 (5,6)\n\n- Segment 17: previous segment 16 (5,5)\n\n- Segment 18: previous segment 17 (5,4)\n\n- Segment 19: previous segment 18 (6,4)\n\n- Segment 20: previous segment 19 (6,3)\n\n- Segment 21: previous segment 20 (6,2)\n\n- Segment 22: previous segment 21 (6,1)  // tail, and since growth, this stays, and we add a new segment? No.\n\nWhen you grow, the tail remains in place for that move, so the new segment is effectively the old tail position, and the tail doesn't move. So the length increases by one, with the tail fixed.\n\nSo after move: the head is at new position (4,3), and the body includes all previous positions from (4,2) to (6,1), so now 23 segments: positions (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1).\n\nYes, 23 positions.\n\nNow, at turn 87, head at (4,3), direction U (since last move was U).\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R. No D.\n\nNow, cells:\n\n- U to (4,4): is it free? From above, (4,4) is not in the snake positions list, so it should be free. Snake has (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,5), (4,6), but not (4,4). (4,4) is not listed, so yes, free.\n\n- L to (3,3): is it free? Snake positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), but not (3,3). Also, walls? No, so free.\n\n- R to (5,3): (5,3) is not in snake positions: snake has (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), but not (5,3). Walls: (5,2) is wall, but (5,3) is not wall, so free.\n\nAlso, food: (4,3) was eaten, so no food there now. Other food at (2,4) is still there, under segment 9 (which is (2,4)).\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term. Also, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail is at (6,1), head at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nNow, I should consider the food at (2,4). To eat it, I need the body to move away from (2,4) and then head to move there.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move if it's not the tail.\n\nIn the current position after turn 86, (2,4) is segment 9, which is not tail; tail is (6,1). So when the snake moves, all segments move.\n\nFor example, at turn 87, if I move, say, U to (4,4), then the head moves to (4,4), and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (2,4) will move to where segment 8 was, which was (2,3)? Let's see the positions after turn 86.\n\nAfter turn 86, positions:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nSeg1: (4,2)\n\nSeg2: (4,1)\n\nSeg3: (3,1)\n\nSeg4: (3,2)\n\nSeg5: (2,2)\n\nSeg6: (1,2)\n\nSeg7: (1,3)\n\nSeg8: (2,3)  // previous segment 7 was (2,3)? After move, segment 8 is previous segment 7, which was (2,3)\n\nList indices clearly.\n\nAfter turn 86 move:\n\n- Index 0: (4,3) head\n\n- Index 1: (4,2)  // previous head\n\n- Index 2: (4,1)  // previous seg1\n\n- Index 3: (3,1)  // previous seg2\n\n- Index 4: (3,2)  // previous seg3\n\n- Index 5: (2,2)  // previous seg4\n\n- Index 6: (1,2)  // previous seg5\n\n- Index 7: (1,3)  // previous seg6\n\n- Index 8: (2,3)  // previous seg7\n\n- Index 9: (2,4)  // previous seg8\n\n- Index 10: (1,4)  // previous seg9\n\n- Index 11: (1,5)  // previous seg10\n\n- Index 12: (2,5)  // previous seg11\n\n- Index 13: (3,5)  // previous seg12\n\n- Index 14: (4,5)  // previous seg13\n\n- Index 15: (4,6)  // previous seg14\n\n- Index 16: (5,6)  // previous seg15\n\n- Index 17: (5,5)  // previous seg16\n\n- Index 18: (5,4)  // previous seg17\n\n- Index 19: (6,4)  // previous seg18\n\n- Index 20: (6,3)  // previous seg19\n\n- Index 21: (6,2)  // previous seg20\n\n- Index 22: (6,1)  // previous seg21\n\nSo (2,4) is index 9.\n\nFood is at (2,4), which is occupied by index 9.\n\nTo eat this food, I need index 9 to move away, and then head to move to (2,4).\n\nWhen the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nFor example, if at turn 87, I move the head, say to (4,4) U, then:\n\nNew head at (4,4)\n\nThen index 1 moves to (4,3) (previous head)\n\nIndex 2 moves to (4,2) (previous index 1)\n\n...\n\nIndex 9 moves to the position of previous index 8, which was (2,3)\n\nPrevious index 8 is (2,3), so index 9 moves to (2,3)\n\nThen (2,4) is now empty? After the move, the cell (2,4) is vacated because index 9 moved to (2,3), and index 10 moves to (1,4) or something.\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4), the new positions:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Index 1: (4,3)  // previous head\n\n- Index 2: (4,2)  // previous index 1\n\n- Index 3: (4,1)  // previous index 2? No\n\nPrevious positions: before move, index 0: (4,3), index 1: (4,2), index 2: (4,1), index 3: (3,1), etc.\n\nWhen head moves to (4,4), new index 0: (4,4)\n\nThen new index 1: previous index 0 position, which is (4,3)\n\nNew index 2: previous index 1 position, (4,2)\n\nNew index 3: previous index 2 position, (4,1)\n\nNew index 4: previous index 3 position, (3,1)\n\nNew index 5: previous index 4 position, (3,2)\n\nNew index 6: previous index 5 position, (2,2)\n\nNew index 7: previous index 6 position, (1,2)\n\nNew index 8: previous index 7 position, (1,3)\n\nNew index 9: previous index 8 position, (2,3)  // now at (2,3)\n\nNew index 10: previous index 9 position, (2,4)  // but previous index 9 was at (2,4), so new index 10 at (2,4)? Let's see:\n\nPrevious index 9 was at (2,4), so new index 10 moves to (2,4)\n\nBut when moving, the segment that was index 9 moves to where index 8 was, which is (2,3).\n\nAnd the segment that was index 10 moves to where index 9 was, which is (2,4).\n\nSo after move, (2,4) is now occupied by new index 10, which was previously index 10 at (1,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's list previous positions before turn 87 move:\n\nPositions: \n- 0: (4,3)\n- 1: (4,2)\n- 2: (4,1)\n- 3: (3,1)\n- 4: (3,2)\n- 5: (2,2)\n- 6: (1,2)\n- 7: (1,3)\n- 8: (2,3)\n- 9: (2,4)\n- 10: (1,4)\n- 11: (1,5)\n- 12: (2,5)\n- 13: (3,5)\n- 14: (4,5)\n- 15: (4,6)\n- 16: (5,6)\n- 17: (5,5)\n- 18: (5,4)\n- 19: (6,4)\n- 20: (6,3)\n- 21: (6,2)\n- 22: (6,1)\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4) (U move):\n\nNew positions:\n- New 0: (4,4)  // head moved here\n- New 1: previous 0: (4,3)\n- New 2: previous 1: (4,2)\n- New 3: previous 2: (4,1)\n- New 4: previous 3: (3,1)\n- New 5: previous 4: (3,2)\n- New 6: previous 5: (2,2)\n- New 7: previous 6: (1,2)\n- New 8: previous 7: (1,3)\n- New 9: previous 8: (2,3)\n- New 10: previous 9: (2,4)  // so (2,4) is still occupied by new index 10\n- New 11: previous 10: (1,4)\n- New 12: previous 11: (1,5)\n- New 13: previous 12: (2,5)\n- New 14: previous 13: (3,5)\n- New 15: previous 14: (4,5)\n- New 16: previous 15: (4,6)\n- New 17: previous 16: (5,6)\n- New 18: previous 17: (5,5)\n- New 19: previous 18: (5,4)\n- New 20: previous 19: (6,4)\n- New 21: previous 20: (6,3)\n- New 22: previous 21: (6,2)\n- And the tail, new 22 is at (6,2), and previous 22 (6,1) is left, but since we didn't eat, the tail moves, so (6,1) is vacated.\n\nSince no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so the last position (6,1) is empty now.\n\nBut for (2,4), it is now occupied by new index 10, which moved from (1,4)? New index 10 is at previous index 9 position, which was (2,4), so (2,4) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n\nSo the food at (2,4) is still under the body, not accessible yet.\n\nTo free (2,4), I need the segment there to move away, and no other segment to move there immediately.\n\nSince the snake is moving, it will take several moves for the body to shift.\n\nThe segment at (2,4) will move when the snake moves, but only if it's not the tail.\n\nCurrently, at turn 86, index 9 is at (2,4). When the snake moves, index 9 moves to where index 8 was, which is (2,3), and index 10 moves to (2,4), so (2,4) is still occupied.\n\nThen next move, if head moves again, index 10 moves to where index 9 was, (2,3), and index 11 moves to (2,4), and so on.\n\nSo (2,4) remains occupied until the segment that was at (2,4) moves away and the position is not filled immediately, but since the snake is contiguous, when a segment moves from a position, the next segment moves into it if it's not the tail moving.\n\nIn this case, because the tail is far away, (2,4) will be occupied continuously as long as the snake is moving without the tail passing by.\n\nThe only way to vacate (2,4) is if the tail is at that position and it moves away, but tail is at (6,1), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach there, and in the meantime, (2,4) is always occupied by some body segment.\n\nWhen the tail moves, the cell is vacated.\n\nFor example, when the snake moves and no food eaten, the tail moves from its position, so that cell is empty.\n\nBut for (2,4), it is currently occupied by a middle segment, so when that segment moves, the next one takes its place, so the cell remains occupied until the tail passes that point.\n\nSpecifically, the position (2,4) will be occupied until the segment that is now at (2,4) moves away when the tail advances, but since it's a body segment, it will be occupied for many turns.\n\nLet's find when (2,4) might be vacated.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1). The snake has to move, and each move, the tail advances to the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nTo vacate (2,4), it must be that the segment at (2,4) is the tail, and when it moves, the cell is empty.\n\nBut currently, the tail is at (6,1), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (2,4).\n\nThe distance: from (6,1) to (2,4) is not straight, but the snake has to unwind.\n\nThe shortest path or the number of moves for the tail to move to (2,4) depends on the snake's movement.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nSince the food at (2,4) has life span 9, it will be there for a while, so I have time to plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for now, at turn 87, I have choices.\n\nBack to turn 87.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (4,4): free, as we saw.\n\nL to (3,3): free? (3,3) is not in current snake positions, so yes.\n\nR to (5,3): free, (5,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\n(5,2) is wall, but (5,3) is ok.\n\nAlso, are there foods? (4,3) is eaten, (2,4) is under body.\n\nNow, I need to think about the grid and risks.\n\nThe grid has walls at borders and (5,2), so for example, if I go right to (5,3), I might be cornered.\n\nLet's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions after turn 86: head (4,3), body down to (6,1).\n\nThe area around: (4,3) is top-left of some part.\n\nFood at (2,4) under body.\n\nAnother food was at (4,3), eaten.\n\nNow, at turn 87, if I move U to (4,4), that's free.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), free.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), free.\n\nBut moving U might be towards more open space, but let's see the surroundings.\n\n(4,4): from there, I can go U to (4,5), but (4,5) is a body segment, index 14 in current positions? After turn 86, index 14 is (4,5), so if I go to (4,4), then to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, so at turn 88, if head at (4,4), moving U to (4,5) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is occupied.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, for turn 87, I need to choose a move.\n\nAlso, long-term, I want to eat the food at (2,4), but it's under body, so I need to move the snake such that the body moves away from (2,4).\n\nThat means I need the segment at (2,4) to move, and the position to be free for some time, but as we saw, it's occupied until the tail passes.\n\nSince the tail is at (6,1), and the snake is long, it will take many turns to free (2,4).\n\nThe food at (2,4) has life span 9, so it will be there until turn 94, so 8 more turns from now? Turn 86: life span 9, so exists for 9 turns: 86 to 94.\n\nAt turn 86, we are moving, so after turn 86, life span decreases to 8 for the next turn, etc.\n\nBut it can be eaten as long as it exists.\n\nTo eat it, I need head to be at (2,4) when it is free.\n\nIt will be free only when the tail is at (2,4) and moves away.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (6,1), and the path to (2,4) is through the snake body.\n\nFor example, the segment that is at (2,4) now is index 9. When the snake moves, this segment will move towards the tail direction over time.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on survival first and avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's look at the map.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake after turn 86:\n\nFrom positions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nAlso walls: borders and (5,2).\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so not accessible.\n\nAccessible free cells: y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6 except where snake or wall.\n\nWall at (5,2), so (5,2) not accessible.\n\nFree cells: (1,1) is free? Snake has (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), not (1,1), but y=1, x=1, is it border? Border walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (1,1) is not border, no obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) : y=6, not border, x=1, not in snake? Snake has up to (1,5), (2,5), etc, not (1,6), so free.\n\n(2,1): not in snake, not wall.\n\n(2,6): not in snake.\n\n(3,3): not in snake.\n\n(3,4): not in snake.\n\n(3,6): not in snake.\n\n(4,4): not in snake.\n\n(5,1): not in snake, but (5,2) is wall, (5,1) is y=1, not border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall, x=5, not border. Snake has (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), not (5,1), so free.\n\n(5,3): free.\n\n(6,0) is y=0 wall, not accessible.\n\n(6,5): not in snake, snake has (6,1) to (6,4), not (6,5), so free.\n\netc.\n\nNow, at turn 87, head at (4,3), I can move:\n\n- U to (4,4): free, then from there, I can go U to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied, so if I go to (4,4), at turn 88 I cannot go U to (4,5) because collision.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go L to (3,4), or R to (5,4), or D to (4,3), but (4,3) is body after move, so not possible, or depending on direction.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4), direction is U, so at turn 88, I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (4,5) is occupied, so not possible.\n\nL to (3,4): let's see if free.\n\nAfter turn 87 move to (4,4), positions change.\n\nBut for now, at turn 87, moving U to (4,4) might lead to a dead end if I can't go further.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\n(3,4): currently not occupied, should be free.\n\n(5,4): after turn 86, (5,4) is index 18, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) at turn 87, the positions shift.\n\nIf at turn 87 head moves U to (4,4), then as before, new head (4,4), new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail at (6,1) moved to (6,2)? No.\n\nAfter move with no eat, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 87, no food eaten (assuming), so after move to (4,4), new positions:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- 1: (4,3)\n\n- 2: (4,2)\n\n- 3: (4,1)\n\n- 4: (3,1)\n\n- 5: (3,2)\n\n- 6: (2,2)\n\n- 7: (1,2)\n\n- 8: (1,3)\n\n- 9: (2,3)\n\n- 10: (2,4)  // (2,4) still occupied\n\n- 11: (1,4)\n\n- 12: (1,5)\n\n- 13: (2,5)\n\n- 14: (3,5)\n\n- 15: (4,5)  // occupied\n\n- 16: (4,6)\n\n- 17: (5,6)\n\n- 18: (5,5)\n\n- 19: (5,4)\n\n- 20: (6,4)\n\n- 21: (6,3)\n\n- 22: (6,2)  // tail\n\nAnd (6,1) vacated.\n\nSo at (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4) or U to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by index 15, so collision if U.\n\nD is not allowed because direction U.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves: L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\n(3,4) is free? Not in the list, so yes.\n\n(5,4) is occupied by index 19, so not free.\n\nIndex 19 is (5,4), so (5,4) is occupied, so cannot move R to (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,4) is L to (3,4), or if I could go D, but not allowed.\n\nSo moving U to (4,4) at turn 87 would put me in a position where at turn 88, I can only move L to (3,4), since R and U are blocked.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nAt turn 87, if I move L to (3,3) from (4,3).\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nAfter moving L to (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen new head at (3,3), new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), tail at (6,1) moves to (6,2)? New positions:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- 1: (4,3)  // previous head\n\n- 2: (4,2)\n\n- 3: (4,1)\n\n- 4: (3,1)\n\n- 5: (3,2)\n\n- 6: (2,2)\n\n- 7: (1,2)\n\n- 8: (1,3)\n\n- 9: (2,3)\n\n- 10: (2,4)\n\n- 11: (1,4)\n\n- 12: (1,5)\n\n- 13: (2,5)\n\n- 14: (3,5)\n\n- 15: (4,5)\n\n- 16: (4,6)\n\n- 17: (5,6)\n\n- 18: (5,5)\n\n- 19: (5,4)\n\n- 20: (6,4)\n\n- 21: (6,3)\n\n- 22: (6,2)  // tail\n\n(6,1) vacated.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3), or D to (3,2).\n\nBut direction is L (since moved L), so cannot move R (instant reverse).\n\nPossible: U, L, D.\n\nU to (3,4): free\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied by new index 9, which is (2,3), so body, collision.\n\nD to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied by new index 5, (3,2), body, collision.\n\nSo from (3,3), after moving L, at turn 88, I can only move U to (3,4), since L and D are body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R from (4,3) to (5,3) at turn 87.\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\nMove R to (5,3), direction R.\n\nNew head (5,3), new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), tail at (6,1) to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), R to (6,3), D to (5,2), or L to (4,3).\n\nDirection R, so cannot move L (instant reverse).\n\nPossible: U, R, D.\n\nU to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by new index 19, (5,4), body, collision.\n\nR to (6,3): (6,3) is occupied by new index 21, (6,3), body, collision.\n\nD to (5,2): (5,2) is wall, collision.\n\nSo all moves are deadly! If I move R to (5,3) at turn 87, then at turn 88, I have no safe move; U, R, D all lead to collision or wall.\n\nTherefore, moving R to (5,3) is suicidal and must be avoided.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (4,4) at turn 87 leads to only one safe move to (3,4) at turn 88.\n\nBut moving L to (3,3) at turn 87 also leads to only one safe move to (3,4) at turn 88? From (3,3), only U to (3,4) is safe.\n\nAt turn 87, from (4,3):\n\n- If I move U to (4,4), then at turn 88, I can only move L to (3,4) (since U and R blocked)\n\n- If I move L to (3,3), then at turn 88, I can only move U to (3,4) (since L and D blocked)\n\n- If I move R to (5,3), then at turn 88, no safe move, death.\n\nSo moving R is bad.\n\nNow, both U and L lead to (3,4) at turn 88, but via different paths.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4) at turn 87, then to (3,4) at turn 88.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3) at turn 87, then to (3,4) at turn 88.\n\nIn both cases, I end up at (3,4) at turn 88.\n\nBut the intermediate state is different.\n\nSince the goal is to survive and eat food, and I need to output actions for multiple turns, I should choose one.\n\nMoreover, for the food at (2,4), I need to plan to eat it later.\n\nFirst, at turn 86, I must move U to (4,3) to eat the food there.\n\nThen at turn 87, I need to choose between U or L to avoid death.\n\nMoving R is not an option.\n\nNow, moving U to (4,4) or L to (3,3).\n\nLet's see which one is better for long-term.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4) at turn 87, then at turn 88, I move L to (3,4).\n\nIf I move L to (3,3) at turn 87, then at turn 88, I move U to (3,4).\n\nEither way, I reach (3,4) at turn 88.\n\nAt turn 88, head at (3,4), and how did I get there.\n\nCase 1: from (4,4) moving L, so direction L.\n\nCase 2: from (3,3) moving U, so direction U.\n\nIn case 1, after moving L to (3,4), direction L.\n\nIn case 2, after moving U to (3,4), direction U.\n\nNow from (3,4), what can I do.\n\nFirst, let's assume we go through (3,3) to (3,4).\n\nAt turn 87: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen at turn 88: move U to (3,4)\n\nNow head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R. No D.\n\n- U to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by body, index 14 in previous, but after moves.\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (3,4), let's find positions.\n\nFirst, after turn 87: head at (3,3) as above.\n\nThen move U to (3,4) at turn 88.\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nNew body: previous head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n\nAnd tail moved, etc.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by new index 14, which was previous (3,5), so yes occupied.\n\nSimilarly, L to (2,4): (2,4) has food but occupied by body? (2,4) is index 10, occupied.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is free? Not occupied, so free.\n\nD to (3,3) but not allowed, direction U.\n\nSo from (3,4), direction U, possible moves: U to (3,5) occupied, collision; L to (2,4) occupied, collision; R to (4,4) free; D not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,4).\n\nThen at turn 89, head at (4,4), direction R (since moved R from (3,4)).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) occupied, or R to (5,4) occupied, or D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, and direction R, so cannot move L or D? Directions: moved R, so current direction R, can move U, R, D? No, can move in directions not opposite.\n\nOpposite of R is L, so cannot move L.\n\nCan move U, R, D.\n\nU to (4,5) occupied, R to (5,4) occupied, D to (4,3) occupied, all collision, death.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) via the other path.\n\nAt turn 87, move U to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 88 move L to (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,4) occupied, R to (4,4) free, D to (3,3) but not allowed (instant reverse from L? Direction L, so opposite is R, so cannot move R, but R is to (4,4), which is right.\n\nDirection L means moving left, so opposite is right, so cannot move right.\n\nSo from (3,4) with direction L, can move U, L, D.\n\nU to (3,5) occupied, collision; L to (2,4) occupied, collision; D to (3,3) free? (3,3) is body? After moves, let's see.\n\nAfter turn 88, head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPositions: from turn 87 at (4,4), then move L to (3,4), so new head (3,4), new body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), tail at (6,2) or something.\n\n(3,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\nD to (3,3) should be free.\n\nBut can I move D? Direction L, so possible moves U, L, D (since not opposite).\n\nU to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,4) occupied, D to (3,3) free.\n\nSo I can move D to (3,3).\n\nThen at turn 89, head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nL to (2,3) might be occupied, etc.\n\nBut at least I can survive.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\nAt turn 87, if I move L to (3,3), then turn 88 move U to (3,4), then turn 89 only move R to (4,4), then turn 90 death.\n\nIf at turn 87 I move U to (4,4), then turn 88 move L to (3,4), then turn 89 move D to (3,3), then survive to turn 90.\n\nSo the second option allows survival longer.\n\nTherefore, at turn 87, I should move U to (4,4) to have an escape route.\n\nThen at turn 88, move L to (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 89, move D to (3,3)\n\nNow, let's continue from there.\n\nAt turn 89, head at (3,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: L, R, D. Not U.\n\n- L to (2,3): is it free? After previous positions.\n\nAfter turn 88: head at (3,4), body includes (4,4), (4,3), etc., and (2,3) is occupied by some segment.\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (3,4) from (4,4) L, so positions:\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- 1: (4,4)\n\n- 2: (4,3)\n\n- 3: (4,2)\n\n- 4: (4,1)\n\n- 5: (3,1)\n\n- 6: (3,2)\n\n- 7: (2,2)\n\n- 8: (1,2)\n\n- 9: (1,3)\n\n- 10: (2,3)  // occupied\n\n- 11: (2,4)\n\n- 12: (1,4)\n\n- 13: (1,5)\n\n- 14: (2,5)\n\n- 15: (3,5)\n\n- 16: (4,5)\n\n- 17: (4,6)\n\n- 18: (5,6)\n\n- 19: (5,5)\n\n- 20: (5,4)\n\n- 21: (6,4)\n\n- 22: (6,3)  // tail, and (6,2) vacated or something.\n\n(2,3) is index 10, occupied.\n\nSo L to (2,3) occupied, collision.\n\nR to (4,3): (4,3) is index 2, occupied.\n\nD to (3,2): (3,2) is index 6, occupied.\n\nAll moves collision! Death at turn 89.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nAt turn 89, from (3,3), after moving D to (3,3) at turn 89? Let's clarify the turns.\n\nTurn 87: move U to (4,4)\n\nPositions after turn 87: head (4,4), body as earlier, including (4,3), (4,2), etc.\n\nTurn 88: move L to (3,4)\n\nNew positions:\n- Head: (3,4)\n- 1: (4,4)  // previous head\n- 2: (4,3)  // previous 1\n- 3: (4,2)  // previous 2\n- 4: (4,1)  // previous 3\n- 5: (3,1)  // previous 4\n- 6: (3,2)  // previous 5\n- 7: (2,2)  // previous 6\n- 8: (1,2)  // previous 7\n- 9: (1,3)  // previous 8\n- 10: (2,3)  // previous 9\n- 11: (2,4)  // previous 10\n- 12: (1,4)  // previous 11\n- 13: (1,5)  // previous 12\n- 14: (2,5)  // previous 13\n- 15: (3,5)  // previous 14\n- 16: (4,5)  // previous 15\n- 17: (4,6)  // previous 16\n- 18: (5,6)  // previous 17\n- 19: (5,5)  // previous 18\n- 20: (5,4)  // previous 19\n- 21: (6,4)  // previous 20\n- 22: (6,3)  // previous 21, tail\n\n(6,2) vacated.\n\nAt turn 89, head at (3,4), but we move to (3,3) D.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 88, we move D to (3,3) at turn 89.\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew body: previous head (3,4) becomes 1, then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and tail at (6,3) moved to (6,4)? New positions:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n- 1: (3,4)  // previous head\n- 2: (4,4)  // previous 1\n- 3: (4,3)  // previous 2\n- 4: (4,2)  // previous 3\n- 5: (4,1)  // previous 4\n- 6: (3,1)  // previous 5\n- 7: (3,2)  // previous 6\n- 8: (2,2)  // previous 7\n- 9: (1,2)  // previous 8\n- 10: (1,3)  // previous 9\n- 11: (2,3)  // previous 10\n- 12: (2,4)  // previous 11\n- 13: (1,4)  // previous 12\n- 14: (1,5)  // previous 13\n- 15: (2,5)  // previous 14\n- 16: (3,5)  // previous 15\n- 17: (4,5)  // previous 16\n- 18: (4,6)  // previous 17\n- 19: (5,6)  // previous 18\n- 20: (5,5)  // previous 19\n- 21: (5,4)  // previous 20\n- 22: (6,4)  // previous 21, tail\n\n(6,3) vacated.\n\nAt (3,3), head, direction D.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D to (3,2), U not allowed.\n\n(2,3) is index 11, occupied.\n\n(4,3) is index 3, occupied.\n\n(3,2) is index 7, occupied.\n\nAll occupied, no safe move, death.\n\nBut this can't be right; I must have a mistake.\n\nAt turn 89, from (3,4) moving D to (3,3), but (3,3) was free before, but after moving, the body is there, but the head moves to (3,3), and the body follows, so (3,3) is now head, and previous positions shift.\n\nBut the cells around are occupied by other body segments.\n\nSpecifically, (2,3) is occupied by index 11, (4,3) by index 3, (3,2) by index 7.\n\nSo yes, all adjacent cells are occupied, so I am trapped and die.\n\nBut at turn 87, if I move L to (3,3), then at turn 88 move U to (3,4), then at turn 89 move R to (4,4), then at turn 90 from (4,4), I can only move L or R but both occupied or wall, death as before.\n\nSo in both cases, I die by turn 89 or 90.\n\nBut that can't be; I must be missing something.\n\nPerhaps at turn 86, when I move U to (4,3), I eat food, so I grow, and the tail doesn't move, so at turn 87, the tail is still at (6,1), so when I move, the tail doesn't advance, so more space.\n\nI forgot the growth at turn 86.\n\nAt turn 86, I move U to (4,3) and eat food, so I grow, tail does not move.\n\nSo after turn 86, positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)  -- 23 segments, tail at (6,1) not moved.\n\nAt turn 87, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nMove U to (4,4): (4,4) free.\n\nAfter move, no food, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions:\n- Head: (4,4)\n- 1: (4,3)\n- 2: (4,2)\n- 3: (4,1)\n- 4: (3,1)\n- 5: (3,2)\n- 6: (2,2)\n- 7: (1,2)\n- 8: (1,3)\n- 9: (2,3)\n- 10: (2,4)  // (2,4) occupied\n- 11: (1,4)\n- 12: (1,5)\n- 13: (2,5)\n- 14: (3,5)\n- 15: (4,5)  // occupied\n- 16: (4,6)\n- 17: (5,6)\n- 18: (5,5)\n- 19: (5,4)\n- 20: (6,4)\n- 21: (6,3)\n- 22: (6,2)\n- 23: (6,1)  // tail, and since no eat, tail moves to (6,2)? New tail is new index 23 at (6,1), but since no growth, tail advances.\n\nWhen no eat, tail moves to the position of the previous second last segment.\n\nBefore move, tail at (6,1).\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4), the new tail is the segment that was at (6,2), now at (6,1)? Let's not worry about the position, the point is that (6,1) is vacated.\n\nFor (4,4), after move, U to (4,5) is occupied by index 15, so cannot.\n\nL to (3,4) free? (3,4) not occupied, free.\n\nR to (5,4) occupied by index 19, so not.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (3,4) possible at turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 87 I move L to (3,3) from (4,3).\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nAfter move, new head (3,3), new body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nThen from (3,3), move U to (3,4) at turn 88, which is free.\n\nThen at (3,4), only R to (4,4) free, then death.\n\nBut with growth, the tail is at (6,1), so when I move, the body is longer, but the vacated cells are behind.\n\nIn both cases, I end up trapped.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to not eat the food at turn 86, but at turn 86, I have no choice; I must move U to (4,3) because L and R are blocked.\n\nSo I have to eat it.\n\nThen at turn 87, I can move U or L, but both lead to death in a few turns.\n\nBut that can't be; the snake must have a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps I can move to a different direction at turn 87.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can only move U or L, R is death, D not allowed.\n\nU or L.\n\nBut both seem bad.\n\nMaybe after eating, at turn 87, I can move to a cell that opens space.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (3,3), then at turn 88 to (3,4), then to (4,4), then from (4,4), if I could go down, but at (4,4), after moving R from (3,4), direction R, so from (4,4), I can move U, R, D.\n\nU to (4,5) occupied, R to (5,4) occupied, D to (4,3) occupied, all bad.\n\nIf from (3,4) I move U, but U to (3,5) occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps at turn 87, move U to (4,4), then at turn 88 move L to (3,4), then at turn 89, I can move D to (3,3), but as before, (3,3) is free, but after moving, the cells around are occupied.\n\nBut in the position after move to (3,3), at (3,3), I can move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), but all are body.\n\nUnless the tail has moved and vacated some cells, but the tail is at (6,1), far away.\n\nFor example, at turn 89, after moving to (3,3), the positions have shifted, but (2,3) and (3,2) are still occupied by segments that are now closer.\n\nBut let's calculate the distance.\n\nIt's hopeless; the snake is too long and in a tight space, so after eating the food, I am trapped.\n\nBut that can't be the case; perhaps I missed a free cell.\n\nLet's list all free cells at turn 86 after eating.\n\nAfter turn 86, snake occupies 23 cells.\n\nGrid has 8x8 = 64 cells, minus border walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so accessible cells: x1-6, y1-6, 6x6=36 cells, minus internal wall at (5,2), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 23, so 12 free cells.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (5,1), (5,3), (6,5), (6,6)? y=6, x=6, not border, but snake has (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), not (6,5), (6,6), so (6,5), (6,6) free.\n\nAlso (5,1), (5,3), etc.\n\nBut the head is at (4,3), and free cells like (3,3), (4,4), (5,3) are adjacent, but when I move, I get blocked.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to move towards the tail to free space.\n\nBut the tail is at (6,1), so I need to move down and right.\n\nAt turn 87, from (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), then I can move down or left, but left is occupied.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (3,2) but occupied, or (2,3) occupied, or (3,4) free.\n\nSo I have to go to (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,4), I have to go to (3,4).\n\nSo I think it's inevitable to get trapped.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I have to accept that and output the moves until I die.\n\nBut the AI should maximize score and survive, so there must be a way.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 86, I move U to (4,3) and eat.\n\nThen at turn 87, move U to (4,4).\n\nThen at turn 88, move L to (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 89, move D to (3,3).\n\nThen at turn 90, from (3,3), as before, no move, death.\n\nBut at turn 89, after moving to (3,3), the position (3,2) might be free if the tail moved.\n\nLet's simulate the positions at turn 89.\n\nAfter turn 88: head at (3,4), body as above.\n\nMove D to (3,3) at turn 89.\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and tail at (6,2) or something.\n\nPrevious tail was at (6,1), after move, new tail is at (6,2)? Let's not.\n\nAt (3,3), the cells:\n\n- Left: (2,3) is occupied by index 11 in new positions, which is (2,3)\n\n- Right: (4,3) occupied by index 3, (4,3)\n\n- Down: (3,2) occupied by index 7, (3,2)\n\n- Up: (3,4) occupied by index 1, (3,4)\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied by body segments, so no move possible, death.\n\nSimilarly for the other path.\n\nSo the snake will die soon after eating the food.\n\nBut for the answer, I should output the moves until it dies.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score and avoid risks, prioritize survival.\n\nBut in this case, I have no choice but to eat the food and then die.\n\nPerhaps at turn 87, I can move to a different cell, but only U or L.\n\nOr perhaps I can plan to eat the other food later.\n\nBut for now, let's output the moves.\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nThen at turn 87, I can choose U or L, say U for example.\n\nThen turn 88: L\n\nThen turn 89: D\n\nThen turn 90: no move, death.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 86.\n\nSo for turn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 88: L ( to (3,4))\n\nTurn 89: D ( to (3,3))\n\nThen at turn 90, from (3,3), no safe move, so I have to choose one, but all deadly, so I die.\n\nBut for the output, I can put the moves until possible.\n\nOr assume I choose one, but it dies.\n\nSince the food at (2,4) has long life, I should try to survive to eat it, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (2,4) is under the body, so to eat it, I need to move the snake such that the head can reach it when free.\n\nBut with the current position, it's difficult.\n\nPerhaps after moving, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if I move the head around, the segment at (2,4) will eventually move when the snake turns.\n\nBut in the short term, I am stuck.\n\nI think I have to accept the situation.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nThen at turn 90, from (3,3), I might move to (3,2) or something, but it's occupied, so death.\n\nBut for the format, I can put up to turn 89 or 90.\n\nLet's see the life span of the food at (4,3) is short, but I eat it at 86.\n\nAt turn 86, I eat it.\n\nThen for the other food at (2,4), life span 9, so I have until turn 94 to eat it.\n\nBut I die before.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to avoid death.\n\nAt turn 87, from (4,3), instead of U or L, I have no other choice.\n\nUnless I can move to a cell that is free, but U and L are free, but lead to trap.\n\nI think I have to go with it.\n\nSo for the output, I'll plan 5 turns: turn 86 to 90.\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U ( to (4,4) )\n\nTurn 88: L ( to (3,4) )\n\nTurn 89: D ( to (3,3) )\n\nTurn 90: from (3,3), possible moves are all bad, but I can choose to move to (3,2) for example, but it's occupied, collision, so I die.\n\nBut for the sake of output, I can put a move, but it will die.\n\nPerhaps at turn 89, from (3,4), I can move to a different direction.\n\nAt turn 89, head at (3,4), direction L (after moving L from (4,4)).\n\nFrom (3,4), with direction L, I can move U, L, D.\n\nU to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,4) occupied, D to (3,3) free.\n\nSo only D.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved differently at turn 87, same thing.\n\nSo I think the snake is doomed after eating the food.\n\nBut let's assume that at turn 90, I move to (3,2) and die.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll output the actions.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but not applicable here.\n\nSo for the boxed answer:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nThen for turn 90, I need to put something, but it will die, so perhaps stop at 89 or put a move.\n\nSince the format says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can put 5 turns.\n\nTurn 90: for example, L, but it will collide.\n\nPerhaps I can move to (2,3) from (3,3) at turn 90, but occupied.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 87, if I move L to (3,3), then at turn 88 move U to (3,4), then at turn 89 move R to (4,4), then at turn 90 from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) but occupied, or L to (3,4) occupied, or U to (4,5) occupied, death.\n\nSame.\n\nSo I'll output for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nTurn 90: L (to (2,3), but it will die, but for the sake of output)\n\nOr since all moves are deadly, I can choose any, but it will die.\n\nPerhaps the AI can choose not to move, but I have to move each turn.\n\nSo I'll do that.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Plan\n\n- **Current Turn**: 86\n- **Snake Head Position**: (4, 2)\n- **Head Direction**: U (up)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4, 3): Positive food (value +1), life span 3 (disappears after turn 88).\n  - (2, 4): Positive food (value +1), life span 9 (disappears after turn 94), but currently under the snake's body (segment at index 8 in positions list). It can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) on next turn (instant reverse).\n  - From (4, 2), possible moves:\n    - U: To (4, 3) – contains food, can be eaten (safe and increases length).\n    - L: To (3, 2) – occupied by body segment (index 3), collision (deadly).\n    - R: To (5, 2) – wall (internal obstacle), collision (deadly).\n  - **Only safe and forced move at turn 86 is U to (4, 3) to eat the food.**\n- **After Eating at Turn 86**:\n  - Snake length increases to 23 segments.\n  - Head moves to (4, 3), direction remains U.\n  - Food at (4, 3) is consumed and removed.\n- **Turn 87 (Head at (4, 3), Direction U)**:\n  - Possible moves: U, L, R (D not allowed due to instant reverse).\n    - U to (4, 4): Free, no immediate collision.\n    - L to (3, 3): Free, no immediate collision.\n    - R to (5, 3): Free, but leads to dead end (no safe moves on turn 88).\n  - Moving R is high risk (traps snake by turn 88). Moving U or L is safer, but both lead to constrained paths.\n  - **Choose U to (4, 4) for better access to open space long-term.**\n- **Turn 88 (Head at (4, 4), Direction U after U move)**:\n  - Possible moves: U, L, R (D not allowed).\n    - U to (4, 5): Occupied by body (index 15), collision (deadly).\n    - R to (5, 4): Occupied by body (index 19), collision (deadly).\n    - L to (3, 4): Free.\n  - **Only safe move is L to (3, 4).**\n- **Turn 89 (Head at (3, 4), Direction L after L move)**:\n  - Possible moves: U, L, D (R not allowed due to instant reverse).\n    - U to (3, 5): Occupied by body (index 16), collision (deadly).\n    - L to (2, 4): Occupied by body (index 11) and has food, but collision (deadly; food cannot be eaten while occupied).\n    - D to (3, 3): Free.\n  - **Only safe move is D to (3, 3).**\n- **Turn 90 (Head at (3, 3), Direction D after D move)**:\n  - Possible moves: L, R, D (U not allowed).\n    - L to (2, 3): Occupied by body (index 11), collision (deadly).\n    - R to (4, 3): Occupied by body (index 3), collision (deadly).\n    - D to (3, 2): Occupied by body (index 7), collision (deadly).\n  - **No safe moves; snake is trapped and will collide regardless of choice.**\n  - Since survival is impossible beyond this point, move L (least risky in terms of direction, but fatal).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations\n- **Food at (2, 4)**: Life span allows eating until turn 94, but it is under the body. Freeing it requires the tail to pass (2, 4), which is distant (tail at (6, 1)). With current path, snake dies before this can happen.\n- **Survival Priority**: The plan maximizes immediate score by eating (4, 3) at turn 86. However, the snake's length and position lead to inevitable trapping by turn 90 due to limited space and body occupancy. No alternative path exists to avoid this in 5 turns.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moves are chosen to delay death as long as possible. Eating (2, 4) is not feasible in this timeframe.\n\n### Action Plan for Turns 86 to 90\n- Turn 86: U (eat food at (4, 3), grow to 23 segments).\n- Turn 87: U (to (4, 4), avoid dead end from R move).\n- Turn 88: L (to (3, 4), only safe move).\n- Turn 89: D (to (3, 3), only safe move).\n- Turn 90: L (to (2, 3), fatal collision; no survival possible).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: U \\\\\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: L \\\\\nTurn 89: D \\\\\nTurn 90: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 87. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 (from 0 to 7 inclusive). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), and the body segments follow. The snake is long—23 segments based on the list: from (4,3) to (6,1). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Then: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — that's 22 body segments, plus head, so 23 total. Positions list has 23 elements? Let's count: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] — that's 23 positions, so snake length is 23.\n\nHead direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (4,3) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and previous position was (4,2) I assume, but let's see the sequence. From the list, head is (4,3), and before that was (4,2), so it moved up to (4,3) from (4,2), so direction U is consistent.\n\nFood: only one food mentioned: (2,4) with value 1 and life span 8. But the format says \"(x1,y1, value1, life_span1)\", so for (2,4), value=1, life_span=8.\n\nIn the food positions, it's given as (2,4,8,1), which I think means (x,y, life_span, value), so (2,4), life_span=8, value=1.\n\nValue 1 is positive food, since +1.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's plot them.\n\nHead at (4,3)\n\nBody:\n\n- (4,2) - directly below head\n\n- (4,1) - below that\n\n- (3,1) - left\n\n- (3,2) - up\n\n- (2,2) - left\n\n- (1,2) - left\n\n- (1,3) - down? (1,2) to (1,3) is down? y increases down? No, in coordinates, usually y=0 is top, y increases down, but in movement, U is (x,y+1)? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases as you go up? But typically in grids, y=0 is top, and y increases downward, so U would be y-1 or something. I need to confirm the coordinate system.\n\nLook at the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nAnd walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nIn snake positions, head at (4,3), with direction U.\n\nPrevious position: since positions list is head first, then body, so the segment after head is (4,2), which is same x, y=2 < 3, so if y=3 to y=2, that would be moving down if y increases downward? But direction is U.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nIf U is (x,y+1), that means moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? That might be it.\n\nStandard in many games, but let's see the positions.\n\nFrom positions: head at (4,3), next segment (4,2). If U is (x,y+1), meaning moving up increases y, so from (4,2) to (4,3) is moving up, since y from 2 to 3 increased, so direction U is correct, and y increases as you go up. So bottom is y=0, top is y=7.\n\nSimilarly, D (x,y-1) decreases y, moving down.\n\nL (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nWalls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nNow food at (2,4).\n\nLife span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn, so it will disappear at turn 87 + 8 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if current turn is t, and life_span N, it disappears after N turns, so on turn t+N it's gone? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life_span N, at turn t, countdown is N, then turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., turn t + (N-1), countdown 1, then on turn t + N, it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + (N-1).\n\nHere, turn t=87, life_span=8, so countdown starts at 8 on turn 87, decreases to 7 on turn 88, ..., down to 1 on turn 94, and disappears on turn 95. So it can be eaten on turns 87 to 94 inclusive.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,3), direction U (up).\n\nAvailable moves: since direction is U, I can go U, L, R, but not D, because no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction U, so cannot move D next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (4,3):\n\n- U (up): to (4,4)\n\n- D (down): to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by body? (4,2) is the second segment, so it's body. But can I move there? Movement constraints: body collision is deadly, but there's an exception: you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, need to see what the tail is.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nTail is (6,1).\n\nNow, from (4,3), moving to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail. The tail is (6,1), so (4,2) is body, not tail, so moving to (4,2) would cause collision and death.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other body cells would cause collision.\n\nBut moving to tail cell is ok if it's the tail.\n\nHere, (4,2) is not tail; tail is (6,1).\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,4)\n\n- D: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\n- L: to (3,3)\n\n- R: to (5,3)\n\nNow, are these cells free?\n\nFirst, (4,4): is it occupied? Look at positions: (4,5), (4,6), etc., but (4,4) is not in the list. Snake positions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), etc., no (4,4), so (4,4) should be free, unless wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: border, x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,4) is within bounds, not border. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,4). So (4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\n(5,3): not in positions? Positions have (6,3), (6,2), etc., but (5,3) not listed. Walls: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) is different. (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) is not mentioned as wall, so should be free.\n\nConfirm walls: border cells and internal obstacles: only (5,2) internal, so (5,3) should be free.\n\nNow, (4,2) is occupied by body, so moving D to (4,2) would die, since it's not the tail.\n\nTail is at (6,1), far away.\n\nSo possible safe moves from (4,3): U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nCannot go D.\n\nNow, food is at (2,4), value +1.\n\nI need to plan to eat it if possible, but also consider risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid state.\n\nPlot the grid roughly.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so we can only be inside, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so accessible x=1,2,3,4,5,6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nFor example, snake has (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), so x=1 is not wall, only the border cells are walls, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls and cannot be moved to.\n\nSimilarly, internal (5,2) is wall.\n\nSo accessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where occupied or obstacle.\n\nObstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake occupies many cells.\n\nHead at (4,3).\n\nFood at (2,4).\n\nTo eat food at (2,4), head needs to move to (2,4).\n\nCurrently head at (4,3), so I need to go left and up or something.\n\nPossible paths.\n\nBut also, (2,4) is currently occupied? Snake positions include (2,4)? Let's see: positions: ... (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), ... so (2,4) is the 10th segment? List: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (3,2), 5: (2,2), 6: (1,2), 7: (1,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,4), 10: (1,4), etc.\n\nSo (2,4) is position index 9, which is a body segment.\n\nFood is at (2,4), but it's under the snake body? The food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied by the snake body, so the food is under it, but to eat it, the body must move away first, then head can move in.\n\nLife span of food is 8, from turn 87 to 94.\n\nNow, since (2,4) is part of the body, it will move as the snake moves.\n\nThe segment at (2,4) will move to where the next segment is or something? Snake movement: when head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo, when head moves to a new cell, the second segment moves to where head was, third to where second was, and so on, tail moves away.\n\nFor the food at (2,4) to be accessible, the snake body must leave (2,4) so that the cell is free, then head can move to it to eat.\n\nCurrently, at turn 87, (2,4) is occupied by body, so food is hidden under it, but not eatable yet.\n\nAs snake moves, that segment will move.\n\nLet me trace the body segments.\n\nThe snake positions in order: head (4,3), then body segments: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nSo the segment at (2,4) is the 9th segment, meaning when the head moves, it will take several moves for this segment to move.\n\nSpecifically, the distance from head to this segment: head is at index 0, (2,4) at index 9, so it will move after 9 steps? Let's see.\n\nWhen head moves to a new position, say to (4,4) if U, then the new positions: head at (4,4), then segment 1 moves to old head (4,3), segment 2 moves to old seg1 (4,2), ..., segment 9 moves to old seg8 position.\n\nOld seg8 is (2,3)? Positions: index 8 is (2,3), index 9 is (2,4).\n\nAfter head move, new head, then body[1] to old head, body[2] to old body[1], ..., body[k] to old body[k-1] for k=1 to len-1.\n\nIn terms of the cell (2,4): currently occupied by segment 9.\n\nAfter one move, segment 9 will move to where segment 8 was, which is (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, segment 10 at (1,4) will move to where segment 9 was, (2,4), but since segment 9 moves to (2,3), segment 10 moves to (2,4)? Let's simulate.\n\nSuppose at turn 87, positions: let's number indices for clarity.\n\nSet P_t for positions at turn t.\n\nTurn 87: P = [H, B1, B2, ..., B22] with H=(4,3), B1=(4,2), B2=(4,1), B3=(3,1), B4=(3,2), B5=(2,2), B6=(1,2), B7=(1,3), B8=(2,3), B9=(2,4), B10=(1,4), B11=(1,5), B12=(2,5), B13=(3,5), B14=(4,5), B15=(4,6), B16=(5,6), B17=(5,5), B18=(5,4), B19=(6,4), B20=(6,3), B21=(6,2), B22=(6,1) tail.\n\nFood at (2,4), but occupied by B9.\n\nNow, if I move head, say to (4,4) for example.\n\nThen new head: (4,4)\n\nThen B1 new position: old H (4,3)\n\nB2 new: old B1 (4,2)\n\nB3 new: old B2 (4,1)\n\nB4 new: old B3 (3,1)\n\nB5 new: old B4 (3,2)\n\nB6 new: old B5 (2,2)\n\nB7 new: old B6 (1,2)\n\nB8 new: old B7 (1,3)\n\nB9 new: old B8 (2,3)  // so B9 moves to (2,3)\n\nB10 new: old B9 (2,4)  // B10 moves to (2,4)\n\netc.\n\nSo after one move, the cell (2,4) is now occupied by B10, who moves there from old (1,4)? B10 was at (1,4), moves to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, the food is still at (2,4), but now covered by B10.\n\nThe cell (2,4) remains occupied by the snake body, just different segment.\n\nFor the food to be accessible, the snake must move such that at some point, no body segment is at (2,4), so it becomes free, then head can move to it.\n\nBut since the snake is long, and (2,4) is part of the body, it will be occupied until the tail passes or something.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1), which is far.\n\nThe segment at (2,4) is B9, index 9 from head, so to free (2,4), the snake needs to move so that B9 moves away and no other segment is there, but as the snake moves, different segments occupy it.\n\nActually, the cell (2,4) will be occupied as long as some body segment is on it, until the last segment that was on it moves off.\n\nIn this case, B9 is on (2,4) at t=87.\n\nAfter one move, B10 moves to (2,4), as above.\n\nThen after another move, B11 would move to (2,4), and so on, until the tail passes.\n\nThe tail is B22 at (6,1).\n\nThe body segments from B9 to B22 will each occupy (2,4) for one turn as the snake moves.\n\nLet's see the sequence of who is at (2,4).\n\nAt turn 87: B9 at (2,4)\n\nAfter move, at turn 88: B10 at (2,4)  // as above simulation\n\nAt turn 89: B11 moves to (2,4)\n\nGenerally, at turn t, the segment at (2,4) is B_{9 + (t-87)} for t from 87 to when it moves off.\n\nB9 at t=87\n\nB10 at t=88\n\nB11 at t=89\n\n...\n\nUp to B22 at (2,4)? B22 is tail at (6,1), not at (2,4).\n\nThe segment that moves to (2,4) depends on the movement.\n\nIn the current path, from the positions, the snake is coiled, so (2,4) is occupied consecutively by different segments as the tail approaches.\n\nThe number of segments after B9: B9 to B22 is 14 segments? B9 to B22 inclusive: B9, B10, ..., B22 is 14 segments.\n\nIndices: 9 to 22 inclusive is 14 positions.\n\nAt turn 87, B9 at (2,4)\n\nAfter k moves, B_{9+k} will be at (2,4) for k from 0 to 13, since B9 to B22.\n\nAt turn 87 + k, B_{9+k} at (2,4) for k=0 to 13.\n\nAt k=0, turn 87, B9\n\nk=1, turn 88, B10\n\n...\n\nk=13, turn 87+13=100, B22 at (2,4)? B22 is the tail.\n\nAt turn 100, if no eating, B22 would be at (2,4), but since the snake moves, the position changes.\n\nI need to simulate the movement.\n\nBut the snake is moving, so the cell (2,4) will be occupied by body segments until the segment that is currently at the end of the snake at that position moves away.\n\nSince the snake is not straight, it's a bit messy.\n\nNotice that in the current position, (2,4) is occupied, and as the snake moves forward, the body segments will each spend one turn at (2,4) in sequence, from B9 to B22.\n\nB9 to B22 is 14 segments, so (2,4) will be occupied for 14 turns from now, from turn 87 to turn 100, but only if the snake doesn't change direction or eat food.\n\nBut if the snake eats food, it grows, so the body gets longer, and (2,4) might be occupied longer.\n\nCurrently, food at (2,4) with life span 8, from turn 87 to 94.\n\nAt turn 87, occupied.\n\nTurn 88, occupied, as B10 moves to it.\n\nSimilarly, turn 89, B11 to it, and so on.\n\nWhen does it become free?\n\nThe last segment to occupy (2,4) is B22, the tail.\n\nAt turn 87, B22 at (6,1)\n\nAfter each move, the tail moves to where B21 was, etc.\n\nTo find when B22 leaves (2,4), but B22 is not at (2,4) yet.\n\nThe segment currently at (2,4) is B9.\n\nB9 will move to the position of B8 when head moves.\n\nB8 is at (2,3) at t=87.\n\nAfter head move, B9 moves to (2,3)\n\nThen the next segment B10 moves to (2,4), so (2,4) is now occupied by B10.\n\nSimilarly, when B10 moves, it goes to where B9 was, which is (2,3), and B11 moves to (2,4), and so on.\n\nSo (2,4) is always occupied by some body segment until the tail B22 moves to it and then off.\n\nBut B22 is far.\n\nThe distance: from head to B9 is 9 steps, but to free (2,4), we need the tail to pass.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1), and the path to (2,4) is not direct.\n\nIn terms of turns, the number of segments after B9 is B10 to B22, 13 segments, so it will take 13 moves for the tail to reach (2,4) from the current state, but since (2,4) is occupied in sequence, it will be occupied for 14 turns from turn 87 to turn 100, as each segment stays for one turn.\n\nAt turn 87: B9 at (2,4)\n\nTurn 88: B10 at (2,4)\n\n...\n\nTurn 100: B22 at (2,4)  because B9 to B22 is 14 segments, k from 0 to 13, turn 87+k, B9+k at (2,4) for k=0 to 13.\n\nAt k=13, turn 100, B22 at (2,4)\n\nThen at turn 101, when head moves, B22 moves to where B21 was, so (2,4) is freed, and the food can be eaten if head moves to it, but only if food is still there.\n\nFood life span: can be eaten up to turn 94.\n\nTurn 94 is within 87 to 94, but at turn 94, who is at (2,4)?\n\nTurn 94 = 87 + 7, so k=7, B9+7 = B16 at (2,4)? B9+k for k=7, B16.\n\nB16 is at (5,6) at t=87, which is not (2,4), but in the sequence, at turn 94, B16 is at (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied.\n\nFood disappears on turn 95, so last chance to eat is turn 94.\n\nAt turn 94, (2,4) is occupied by B16 or whoever, so it's not free, so head cannot move to it to eat.\n\nThe food will disappear before the snake body leaves (2,4), since body leaves at turn 101, food gone at turn 95.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat this food because it is under the body and the body won't move away in time before the food disappears.\n\nLife span 8, from turn 87 to 94, but occupied until turn 100, so yes, never free during its lifetime.\n\nTherefore, we cannot eat this food; it's inaccessible.\n\nSo, we should ignore this food and focus on other things.\n\nBut there might be other food, but in the state, only one food is given: (2,4,8,1)\n\nOnly one food on the grid.\n\nSo no other food to eat.\n\nTherefore, we need to survive and wait for new food to spawn, I suppose, but the state doesn't say new food spawns; it only gives current food.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify food spawning; we have to work with what's given.\n\nIn this state, only one food, which we can't eat, so we need to move safely without eating it.\n\nMaximize score, but no food to eat now, so just survive.\n\nBut we need to think ahead for future turns.\n\nPerhaps new food appears, but it's not specified, so I think we have to assume only this food for now.\n\nBut the food will disappear on turn 95, and maybe new food spawns later, but not mentioned.\n\nThe state only provides current food, so for planning, we consider this food and that's it.\n\nSince we can't eat it, we should avoid risks and stay alive.\n\nNow, back to current position: head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nNow, need to choose which one, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if we go U to (4,4).\n\nThen new head at (4,4), body: B1 to (4,3), B2 to (4,2), B3 to (4,1), B4 to (3,1), B5 to (3,2), B6 to (2,2), B7 to (1,2), B8 to (1,3), B9 to (2,3), B10 to (2,4), etc. as before.\n\nNow (4,4) is free, so safe.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: new head direction depends on move, but after moving U, direction is U, so can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nFrom (4,4), U to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by B14? Positions: B14 at (4,5) at t=87, but after move, B14 moves to old B13, which is (3,5) or something.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4), the new positions:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nB1: old H (4,3)\n\nB2: old B1 (4,2)\n\nB3: old B2 (4,1)\n\nB4: old B3 (3,1)\n\nB5: old B4 (3,2)\n\nB6: old B5 (2,2)\n\nB7: old B6 (1,2)\n\nB8: old B7 (1,3)\n\nB9: old B8 (2,3)  // B8 was (2,3)?

After move, B5 is at (3,2), which is body, not tail, so moving D to (3,2) would collide.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied by B9? After move, B9 at (2,3), body.\n\nU to (3,4): should be free, not occupied.\n\nSo only safe move is U to (3,4).\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nIf we go R from (4,3) to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, as earlier.\n\nNew head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen body: B1 to (4,3), B2 to (4,2), B3 to (4,1), B4 to (3,1), B5 to (3,2), B6 to (2,2), B7 to (1,2), B8 to (1,3), B9 to (2,3), B10 to (2,4), etc.\n\nFrom (5,3), direction R, so can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3)\n\n(5,2) is wall, internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n(5,4) is occupied by B19? At t=87, B19 is not at (5,4), B19 is (6,4)?

After move, B20 to (6,4)? Old B19 (6,4), so B20 to (6,4)\n\nB21 to old B20 (6,3) to (6,3)\n\nB22 to old B21 (6,2) to (6,2)\n\nSo (5,4) has B19, (6,3) has B21.\n\nFrom (5,3), U to (5,4): occupied by B19, body, not tail.\n\nD to (5,2): wall, cannot.\n\nR to (6,3): (6,3) has B21, body, not tail.\n\nAll possible moves seem blocked? But that can't be right.\n\n(5,3) to U (5,4): B19 is at (5,4), but is it the tail? Tail is B22 at (6,2) or something, not (5,4), so collision.\n\nSimilarly, R to (6,3): B21 at (6,3), body, not tail.\n\nD to (5,2) wall.\n\nL is opposite to R, cannot move L.\n\nSo no safe move from (5,3) if we go R at turn 87.\n\nTherefore, moving R to (5,3) is dangerous because at the next turn, we might be trapped with no safe move.\n\nIn this case, from (5,3), all adjacent cells are either wall or body, so indeed, no safe move on turn 88, so we die.\n\nTherefore, we must not go R at turn 87.\n\nSimilarly, going U or L might be better.\n\nNow, going U to (4,4), then at turn 88, we can go L to (3,4), as we saw earlier.\n\nGoing L directly to (3,3) at turn 87, then at turn 88, go U to (3,4).\n\nIn both cases, we end up at (3,4) or similar.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, if we go U at t=87 to (4,4), then t=88 go L to (3,4).\n\nIf we go L at t=87 to (3,3), then t=88 go U to (3,4).\n\nSo in both cases, at turn 88, head is at (3,4) with direction depending on how we got there.\n\nNow, from (3,4), we need to see.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,4) is irrelevant since we can't eat it.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail position.\n\nTail is at (6,1) at t=87, but after moves, it moves.\n\nPerhaps we should aim to move to an open area.\n\nNotice that the snake is coiled, and we might need to uncoil or find space.\n\nLet's see the grid occupancy.\n\nFor example, the area around (3,4) might be free.\n\nAt t=87, after moving, say we go to (3,4) at some point.\n\nAlso, there is the internal wall at (5,2), which blocks some area.\n\nTo avoid getting trapped.\n\nSince we must think 5 turns ahead, let's simulate both options.\n\nFirst option: at t=87, go U to (4,4)\n\nThen at t=88, from (4,4) with direction U, we can only go L to (3,4), as we concluded.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), new direction L (since moved left from (4,4)).\n\nNow positions at t=88 after moving to (3,4):\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nB1: old position, which was at (4,4) before move? At t=88 before move, head at (4,4), B1 at (4,3), etc.\n\nAfter moving L to (3,4):\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nThen B1 moves to old head (4,4)\n\nB2 moves to old B1 (4,3)\n\nB3 to old B2 (4,2)\n\nB4 to old B3 (4,1)\n\nB5 to old B4 (3,1)\n\nB6 to old B5 (3,2)\n\nB7 to old B6 (2,2)\n\nB8 to old B7 (1,2)\n\nB9 to old B8 (1,3)\n\nB10 to old B9 (2,3)\n\nB11 to old B10 (2,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction L, so can go U, D, L, not R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied? At t=87, (3,5) was B13, but after previous moves.\n\nAt this point, B13 is moving, but let's see current positions.\n\nSince we moved to (3,4) from (4,4), and before that from (4,3), the positions are shifting.\n\nFrom above: new head (3,4)\n\nB1: (4,4)\n\nB2: (4,3)\n\nB3: (4,2)\n\nB4: (4,1)\n\nB5: (3,1)\n\nB6: (3,2)\n\nB7: (2,2)\n\nB8: (1,2)\n\nB9: (1,3)\n\nB10: (2,3)\n\nB11: (2,4)\n\nB12: (1,4)  // from old B11 at (1,4)? Earlier chain.\n\nAt t=88 before this move, when head was at (4,4), positions as I had for turn 88 after first move.\n\nPerhaps start from t=87 initial.\n\nt=87: positions as given.\n\nAfter move U to (4,4): t=88 positions as I listed earlier for after U move.\n\nThen from there, move L to (3,4): so at t=89, new positions:\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nB1: old head (4,4)\n\nB2: old B1 (4,3)\n\nB3: old B2 (4,2)\n\nB4: old B3 (4,1)\n\nB5: old B4 (3,1)\n\nB6: old B5 (3,2)\n\nB7: old B6 (2,2)\n\nB8: old B7 (1,2)\n\nB9: old B8 (1,3)\n\nB10: old B9 (2,3)\n\nB11: old B10 (2,4)\n\nB12: old B11 (1,4)\n\nB13: old B12 (1,5)\n\nB14: old B13 (2,5)\n\nB15: old B14 (3,5)\n\nB16: old B15 (4,5)\n\nB17: old B16 (4,6)\n\nB18: old B17 (5,6)\n\nB19: old B18 (5,5)\n\nB20: old B19 (5,4)\n\nB21: old B20 (6,4)\n\nB22: old B21 (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\nNow, from head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left from (4,4)).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by B15? B15 is at (3,5), body, not tail.\n\nD to (3,3): (3,3) is not occupied? In positions, B2 at (4,3), B6 at (3,2), no (3,3), so should be free.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied by B11, body, not tail.\n\nR to (4,4): but R is opposite to L? Current direction L, so moving R would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nCannot move R.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5): occupied by B15, collision.\n\nL to (2,4): occupied by B11, collision.\n\nD to (3,3): free, as not occupied.\n\nSo only safe move is D to (3,3).\n\nThen from there, and so on.\n\nWe are getting into a loop or something.\n\nIf at t=87 we go L directly to (3,3).\n\nt=87: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen t=88 positions:\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nB1: (4,3)\n\nB2: (4,2)\n\nB3: (4,1)\n\nB4: (3,1)\n\nB5: (3,2)\n\nB6: (2,2)\n\nB7: (1,2)\n\nB8: (1,3)\n\nB9: (2,3)\n\nB10: (2,4)\n\netc.\n\nFrom (3,3), direction L, so can go U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,4): free, not occupied.\n\nD to (3,2): occupied by B5, body.\n\nL to (2,3): occupied by B9, body.\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo only U to (3,4) is safe.\n\nThen to (3,4) at t=89.\n\nSame as above.\n\nIn both cases, we end up at (3,4) at some turn, then to (3,3) or something.\n\nBut we need to find a way to escape this area.\n\nNotice that the snake is long, and the tail is moving, so eventually space will be freed.\n\nFor example, at t=87, tail at (6,1), and it will move.\n\nBut in the short term, we might be constrained.\n\nPerhaps going R is not good, as we saw it leads to dead end.\n\nSo better to go U or L at t=87.\n\nSince food is not eatable, and we need to survive, we should choose a move that keeps options open.\n\nGoing U to (4,4) then L to (3,4) seems ok, or directly L to (3,3) then U to (3,4).\n\nBut from (3,4), as above, we have to go D to (3,3), which might be safe.\n\nAt t=89, after being at (3,4), we go D to (3,3).\n\nThen at t=90, positions:\n\nHead at (3,3), direction D (since moved down from (3,4)? From (3,4) to (3,3), which is D (y-1), so direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nU to (3,4): but (3,4) is where we came from, and it might be occupied now.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3), new positions:\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nB1: old head (3,4)  // so (3,4) now occupied by B1\n\nB2: old B1 (4,4) etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), U to (3,4): occupied by B1, body, collision.\n\nL to (2,3): may be occupied or not.\n\nR to (4,3): occupied by B2 or something.\n\nLet's list positions at t=90 after moving D to (3,3) from (3,4).\n\nAssume previous state: at t=89, head at (3,4), with positions as before.\n\nMove D to (3,3):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nB1: old head (3,4)\n\nB2: old B1 (4,4)\n\nB3: old B2 (4,3)\n\nB4: old B3 (4,2)\n\nB5: old B4 (4,1)\n\nB6: old B5 (3,1)\n\nB7: old B6 (3,2)\n\nB8: old B7 (2,2)\n\nB9: old B8 (1,2)\n\nB10: old B9 (1,3)\n\nB11: old B10 (2,3)\n\nB12: old B11 (2,4)\n\n...\n\nB22: tail at some position.\n\nFrom (3,3), direction D, so can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (3,4): occupied by B1, collision.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) may be free or not. In the list, B11 is at (2,3)? B11: old B10 (2,3), but B10 was at (2,3) at t=89? Messy.\n\nFrom above, B11: old B10, and at t=89, B10 was at (2,3), so B11 moves to (2,3), so (2,3) occupied by B11.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,3): B3 is at (4,3), occupied.\n\nSo no safe move? U, L, R all occupied or not possible.\n\nU occupied, L to (2,3) occupied by B11, R to (4,3) occupied by B3.\n\nAnd D not allowed.\n\nSo stuck, die.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nIf we go this path, we get trapped at turn 90.\n\nBut this is from the U then L path.\n\nIf we go directly L at t=87 to (3,3), then U to (3,4) at t=88, then at t=89 from (3,4) we have to go D to (3,3), same as above, then stuck at t=90.\n\nSo both ways lead to a dead end in a few turns.\n\nWe need a different initial move.\n\nWhat about going R? But earlier we saw that going R to (5,3) at t=87, then at t=88 no safe move, immediate death.\n\nSo R is worse.\n\nPerhaps at t=87, from (4,3), instead of U or L, we can only U or L, R is bad.\n\nBut U and L both lead to trap.\n\nUnless we can go to a different direction.\n\nAnother idea: at t=87, go U to (4,4), then at t=88 from (4,4), instead of L to (3,4), is there other option? But earlier we saw only L is possible, U and R are occupied.\n\nIn the position at t=88 after U move, from (4,4), we could only go L to (3,4).\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSimilarly for L at t=87.\n\nBut there must be a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps we missed something.\n\nAt t=87, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nAvailable moves: U, L, R.\n\nR to (5,3): but as we saw, from (5,3), all adjacent are blocked: U to (5,4) has body, D to (5,2) wall, R to (6,3) has body, L not allowed.\n\nSo death next turn.\n\nNot good.\n\nU to (4,4): then only L to (3,4), then only D to (3,3), then stuck.\n\nL to (3,3): then only U to (3,4), then only D to (3,3), stuck.\n\nSo in all cases, by turn 90, we die.\n\nBut that can't be right; the snake must have a way out.\n\nPerhaps at some point, moving to the tail cell is possible.\n\nFor example, at t=87, if we go D to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, B1, not tail, so collision.\n\nTail is at (6,1), far.\n\nOr later, when tail is closer.\n\nBut in the short term, no.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (2,4) is under body, but if we move in a way that the body moves away faster, but we can't because the snake is long.\n\nPerhaps we can move towards the tail area to free space.\n\nLet's list the free cells around.\n\nAt t=87, head at (4,3), free cells: (4,4), (3,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is free but leads to trap.\n\n(3,3) and (4,4) both lead to trap in 3 turns.\n\nBut maybe after moving, some cells become free.\n\nFor example, when we move, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nAt t=87, when we move, the tail at (6,1) moves to old B21 position, which is (6,2), so (6,1) is freed.\n\nBut that's far from head.\n\nSimilarly, other cells are freed as tail moves.\n\nBut in the head area, it's tight.\n\nLet's see the position at (3,3): at t=87, is it free? Yes.\n\nIf we go L to (3,3) at t=87, then at t=88, from (3,3), we go U to (3,4), which is free at that time.\n\nAt t=89, from (3,4), we can only go D to (3,3), but (3,3) is now free because we moved from it, but after moving to (3,4), B1 moves to (3,3)? Let's see.\n\nAt t=87: move L to (3,3)\n\nt=88 positions:\nHead: (3,3)\nB1: (4,3)\nB2: (4,2)\nB3: (4,1)\nB4: (3,1)\nB5: (3,2)\nB6: (2,2)\nB7: (1,2)\nB8: (1,3)\nB9: (2,3)\nB10: (2,4)\nB11: (1,4)\nB12: (1,5)\nB13: (2,5)\nB14: (3,5)\nB15: (4,5)\nB16: (4,6)\nB17: (5,6)\nB18: (5,5)\nB19: (5,4)\nB20: (6,4)\nB21: (6,3)\nB22: (6,2)  // tail moved to (6,2)\n\nFrom (3,3), at t=88, we go U to (3,4), which is free.\n\nt=89 positions:\nHead: (3,4)\nB1: old head (3,3)\nB2: old B1 (4,3)\nB3: old B2 (4,2)\nB4: old B3 (4,1)\nB5: old B4 (3,1)\nB6: old B5 (3,2)\nB7: old B6 (2,2)\nB8: old B7 (1,2)\nB9: old B8 (1,3)\nB10: old B9 (2,3)\nB11: old B10 (2,4)\netc.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction U (since moved up from (3,3)? From (3,3) to (3,4) is U (y+1), so direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied by B14? At t=88, B14 was at (3,5)? t=88 positions: B14 at (3,5), so after move, B14 moves to old B13 position.\n\nAt t=89 after move to (3,4):\n\nB14: old B13 (2,5)  // B13 was (2,5), so B14 to (2,5)\n\nB15: old B14 (3,5)  // B14 was (3,5), so B15 to (3,5)\n\nSo (3,5) has B15.\n\nU to (3,5): occupied by B15, body.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) has B11, occupied.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) has B2, occupied. B2 is at (4,3)? B2: old B1 (4,3), so (4,3) occupied, (4,4) is not occupied by body? B2 is at (4,3), B1 at (3,3), so (4,4) is free?\n\nPositions: head (3,4), B1 (3,3), B2 (4,3), B3 (4,2), etc., no (4,4), so (4,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, walls not.\n\nSo R to (4,4) is possible.\n\nAnd D not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,4), we can go R to (4,4) or U/L occupied, so only R to (4,4).\n\nThen we go to (4,4) at t=90.\n\nThen from there, similar to before.\n\nBut we are moving around.\n\nAt least we didn't get stuck yet.\n\nIn this case, with initial L at t=87, then U at t=88 to (3,4), then R at t=89 to (4,4).\n\nThen at t=90, head at (4,4), direction R (since moved right from (3,4)).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) has B15 or something, occupied.\n\nD to (4,3): occupied by B2, body.\n\nL to (3,4): occupied by B1, body.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) has B19 or something.\n\nAfter previous move, at t=90 positions:\n\nHead at (4,4)\n\nB1: old head (3,4)\n\nB2: old B1 (3,3)\n\nB3: old B2 (4,3)\n\nB4: old B3 (4,2)\n\nB5: old B4 (4,1)\n\nB6: old B5 (3,1)\n\nB7: old B6 (3,2)\n\nB8: old B7 (2,2)\n\nB9: old B8 (1,2)\n\nB10: old B9 (1,3)\n\nB11: old B10 (2,3)\n\nB12: old B11 (2,4)\n\nB13: old B12 (1,4)\n\nB14: old B13 (2,5)\n\nB15: old B14 (3,5)\n\nB16: old B15 (4,5)\n\n etc.\n\nSo (4,5) has B16? B16: old B15 (4,5), so B16 at (4,5)\n\n(5,4) has B20? B20: old B19 (6,4), so B20 at (6,4), not (5,4)\n\nB19: old B18 (5,5), so B19 at (5,5)\n\nB18: old B17 (5,6), so B18 at (5,6)\n\nB17: old B16 (4,6), so B17 at (4,6)\n\nSo (5,4) is not occupied? Who is at (5,4)? Not in the list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) has B3, occupied.\n\n(3,4) has B1, occupied.\n\n(4,5) has B16, occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), direction R, so can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,5): occupied by B16, collision.\n\nD to (4,3): occupied by B3, collision.\n\nR to (5,4): free, as above.\n\nSo go R to (5,4).\n\nThen continue.\n\nSo we can keep moving.\n\nSimilarly, if we had gone U first, we might have similar paths.\n\nBut in the initial choice, at t=87, both U and L can lead to survival if we choose the right subsequent moves.\n\nSince we need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to output actions for the current turn and future turns, but we don't know the state, so perhaps for this response, we only need to output the action for turn 87, and maybe suggest, but the format says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point.\n\nBut since the state changes, and we don't have control over food spawns, perhaps we only output for the current turn.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output might be for the immediate action or more.\n\nSince future states depend on moves, and no new food info, perhaps we output only for turn 87, or for a few turns.\n\nBut to be safe, let's output for turn 87 and then for future turns based on plan.\n\nBut since the grid might have changes, it's tricky.\n\nPerhaps for this, we can output the action for turn 87 and indicate the plan.\n\nBut let's see the core rules, no mention of food spawning, so only this food exists.\n\nSince we can't eat it, we just survive.\n\nFrom above, at t=87, we can choose U or L.\n\nLet's pick one, say L to (3,3).\n\nThen at t=88, U to (3,4)\n\nThen at t=89, R to (4,4)\n\nThen at t=90, R to (5,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U at t=87, then L to (3,4) at t=88, then from (3,4) with direction L, we can go R to (4,4) at t=89, same as above.\n\nSo both are similar.\n\nBut at t=87, if we go U, we go to (4,4), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nIf we go L, to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nNow, the food at (2,4) is not eatable, so no issue.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid the Tail Reward Danger, but no food near tail, so ok.\n\nSo for turn 87, I think either U or L is fine.\n\nLet's choose U for example.\n\nSo action for turn 87: U\n\nThen for future turns, we can plan, but since not required, perhaps output only for turn 87.\n\nThe format suggests multiple turns, but I think for this, we can do Turn 87: U\n\nBut to be complete, let's think 5 turns.\n\nAt t=87: go U to (4,4)\n\nt=88: go L to (3,4)\n\nt=89: from (3,4), with direction L, go R to (4,4)  -- but (4,4) might be occupied? In previous state, but after move, it changes.\n\nFrom earlier simulation, when at (3,4), we can go R to (4,4) if free.\n\nIn the U-first path:\n\nt=87: U to (4,4)\n\nt=88: L to (3,4)  -- direction now L\n\nt=89: from (3,4), direction L, go R to (4,4)  -- (4,4) should be free, as in the L-first path we had it free.\n\nThen t=90: from (4,4), direction R, go R to (5,4) if free.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: R\n\nTurn 90: R (to (5,4))\n\nThen from (5,4), direction R, can go U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut we need to check if safe.\n\nSince the snake is moving, and tail is moving, space is created.\n\nFor this response, I think outputting for turn 87 is sufficient, with the understanding that we plan to move to open space.\n\nBut to follow format, let's output for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the state is given only for t=87, future depends on actions.\n\nPerhaps output the action for turn 87 and that's it, but the format shows multiple.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=87, we can go R to (5,3), but we saw it leads to death, so not good.\n\nOr, is there a way to go D? But D to (4,2) is body, not tail, so collision, not possible.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nI think U is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with U for turn 87.\n\nThen for the answer.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 87, the snake head is at (4,3) with direction Up. The available moves are Up (U), Left (L), and Right (R), as Down (D) is not allowed due to the no-instant-reverse rule and would cause a body collision at (4,2). The food at (2,4) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten because the body will occupy (2,4) until at least turn 101, while the food disappears on turn 95 (life span 8, last edible on turn 94). Thus, the food is inaccessible, and the priority is long-term survival by avoiding collisions and maintaining maneuverability.\n\nAfter evaluating possible moves 5+ turns ahead:\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,3) leads to a dead end on turn 88, as all adjacent cells are blocked by walls or body segments.\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,4) or Left (L) to (3,3) both allow for a safe path to more open areas, but moving Up provides slightly better access to the right side of the grid, where the tail is moving away, creating future space.\n\nThe chosen action for turn 87 is Up (U) to (4,4). Subsequent actions are planned to navigate toward open spaces while avoiding collisions:\n- Turn 88: Move Left (L) to (3,4), avoiding body collisions and leveraging the freed cell from the tail movement.\n- Turn 89: Move Right (R) to (4,4), as (3,5) and (2,4) are occupied, but (4,4) is free after the tail moves.\n- Turn 90: Move Right (R) to (5,4), accessing the less cluttered right side.\n- Turn 91: Move Up (U) to (5,5), continuing toward open area near the top-right.\n- Turn 92: Move Right (R) to (6,5) if free, or adjust based on new food spawns (though not specified, the grid may have new food by then).\n\nThis plan maximizes survival by moving away from the coiled body and toward areas freed by the tail, with flexibility to adapt after turn 92 based on new state information.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: R\nTurn 90: R\nTurn 91: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 88. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow. The snake has 23 segments, so it's quite long. Head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,4) with value 1 and life span 7. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 7 turns from now, so by turn 95.\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 10, so it disappears at turn 98.\n\nBoth foods are positive, value +1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 88. But the answer format should show actions for turn 88, 89, 90, etc., up to some point. I should think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a grid to understand where everything is.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nThen: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n\nHead direction is Up, so from (4,4), it's moving to (4,5)? No, direction Up means increasing y, so from (4,4), up would be to (4,5), but let's see the positions.\n\nPositions are given in order: head first, then body. So from head (4,4), next is (4,3), which is down, but direction is Up? That might be inconsistent.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), ...]\n\nIf head is at (4,4) and direction is Up, that means it just moved to (4,4) from below, so previous position was (4,3), which is now the first body segment. Direction Up means the head is facing upwards, so for the next move, it can go U, L, or R, but not D (down) because that would be instant reverse.\n\nHead direction: \"Snake Head Direction: U\" so current direction is Up. That means from turn 87 to 88, it moved Up to (4,4). So positions: at turn 88, head at (4,4), which was previously occupied by body? Let's see the positions.\n\nList of positions: index 0: (4,4) head, index 1: (4,3), index 2: (4,2), index 3: (4,1), index 4: (3,1), index 5: (3,2), index 6: (2,2), index 7: (1,2), index 8: (1,3), index 9: (2,3), index 10: (2,4), index 11: (1,4), index 12: (1,5), index 13: (2,5), index 14: (3,5), index 15: (4,5), index 16: (4,6), index 17: (5,6), index 18: (5,5), index 19: (5,4), index 20: (6,4), index 21: (6,3), index 22: (6,2) tail.\n\nSince head direction is Up, and it's at (4,4), the next possible moves are Up (to (4,5)), Left (to (3,4)), or Right (to (5,4)). Down to (4,3) is not allowed because it's instant reverse.\n\nNow, (4,5) is occupied by the snake body, position index 15: (4,5). Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nI should mark the grid.\n\nMake a grid:\n\ny=7: row 7\n\ny=6: row 6\n\n...\n\ny=0: row 0\n\nx from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are all walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is within the grid, so it's a wall cell.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n\nSpecifically, (5,2) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n\n(4,4) head\n\n(4,3) body\n\n(4,2) body\n\n(4,1) body — y=1, which is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, except borders. x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 playable.\n\n(4,1) is x=4,y=1, which should be playable, not wall.\n\nThen (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n\n(6,2) is tail, x=6,y=2.\n\nFood at (2,4) and (2,6).\n\n(2,4) has food, but (2,4) is also occupied by snake? Position index 10: (2,4) is a body segment.\n\nFood can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is food, let's see if occupied.\n\n(2,6): is it in snake positions? Positions: (4,6) at index 16, (5,6), etc. No (2,6), so (2,6) is free.\n\n(2,4) is occupied by snake body at index 10: (2,4).\n\nFood at (2,4) with life span 7, value 1.\n\nSince it's under the body, to eat it, the snake must move away from (2,4) and then head move to it when it's free.\n\nLife span 7, from turn 88, so it disappears at turn 95 (since countdown decreases every turn including current, so after 7 turns, on turn 95 it's gone).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 10, disappears at turn 98.\n\nNow, head at (4,4), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves from (4,4):\n\n- Up (U) to (4,5): but (4,5) is occupied by snake body, position index 15: (4,5). So moving there would cause collision, death.\n\n- Down (D) to (4,3): but Down is opposite to current direction Up, so instant reverse not allowed. Also, (4,3) is body, but even if not, reverse is forbidden.\n\n- Left (L) to (3,4): what is (3,4)? Let's see if occupied or wall.\n\n(3,4): not in snake positions? Positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), no (3,4). Also not wall. Walls are borders and (5,2). So (3,4) should be free.\n\n- Right (R) to (5,4): (5,4) is position index 19: (5,4), which is body segment. So occupied.\n\nTherefore, from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,5): occupied, death\n\n- D: not allowed, reverse\n\n- L to (3,4): free\n\n- R to (5,4): occupied, death\n\nSo only possible move is Left to (3,4).\n\nIs that right? Head direction Up, so cannot go Down, that's reverse.\n\nUp to (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nRight to (5,4) is body, collision.\n\nLeft to (3,4) is free? Let me confirm snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n\nSo (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,4) is listed as index 19.\n\n(4,5) index 15.\n\nYes, so only possible safe move is Left to (3,4).\n\nBut is (3,4) safe? Moving to (3,4), then the snake will move, tail will move away, etc.\n\nFor this turn, turn 88, the only option is to go Left to (3,4).\n\nThen, after moving, head will be at (3,4), and the body will follow.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, let's simulate.\n\nTurn 88: move Left to (3,4)\n\nAfter move, new head position (3,4), and the tail (6,2) will be cut off or moved? When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten, so tail moves.\n\nNew snake positions: head to (3,4), then the previous head (4,4) becomes body, so body starts from (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), and tail was (6,2), which is removed. The new tail is (6,3)? Let's see the segment before tail.\n\nPositions: after moving head to (3,4), the body is: previous positions except tail is removed and head added.\n\nThe snake was: [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ]\n\nAfter moving Left to (3,4): new head is (3,4), then the first body segment is the old head (4,4), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) and tail (6,2) is gone, so new tail is (6,3)? The last segment before tail was (6,3), which is now the tail.\n\nList: new positions: head (3,4), then body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,3) is now the tail. (6,2) removed.\n\nOld tail was (6,2), so removed. The segment before was (6,3), which is now the last, so tail at (6,3).\n\nDirection: after moving Left, the new head direction is Left, so for next turn, direction L.\n\nNow, at turn 89, head at (3,4), direction Left.\n\nPossible moves: cannot go Right (instant reverse), can go Up, Down, Left.\n\n- Left (L) to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied by body? In new positions, (2,4) is the 11th segment? New positions: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (1,2), 9: (1,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (2,4), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (3,5), 16: (4,5), 17: (4,6), 18: (5,6), 19: (5,5), 20: (5,4), 21: (6,4), 22: (6,3) tail.\n\n(2,4) is index 11, so occupied by body. Moving to (2,4) would collide.\n\n- Up (U) to (3,5): (3,5) is index 15 in new positions? Index 15 is (3,5)? Positions: index 0 head (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (1,2), 9: (1,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (2,4), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (3,5), 16: (4,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) is index 15, body segment.\n\n- Down (D) to (3,3): what is (3,3)? Not in positions, and not wall. Free?\n\n(3,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- Right (R) to (4,4): but (4,4) is body, index 1, occupied, and also Right is opposite to current direction Left? Current direction is Left, so Right would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- L to (2,4): occupied, death\n\n- U to (3,5): occupied, death\n\n- D to (3,3): free\n\n- R: not allowed\n\nSo only Down to (3,3) is safe.\n\nTurn 89: move Down to (3,3)\n\nNow head to (3,3), direction Down.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) and tail (6,3) removed? Old tail (6,3), removed. New tail is (6,4)? Positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) and (6,3) was tail, gone, so new tail (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is now tail.\n\nDirection Down.\n\nTurn 90: head at (3,3), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nCannot go Up (reverse), can go Left, Right, Down.\n\n- Down (D) to (3,2): (3,2) is body? Positions: index 0 head (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (3,2), ... index 7 is (3,2), which is body. So occupied.\n\n- Left (L) to (2,3): (2,3) is index 11? Positions: 0: (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (3,2), 8: (2,2), 9: (1,2), 10: (1,3), 11: (2,3), ... so (2,3) is index 11, body.\n\n- Right (R) to (4,3): (4,3) is index 3, body.\n\n- Up (U) to (3,4): but Up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nAll possible moves except Up are to body cells? Down to (3,2) body, Left to (2,3) body, Right to (4,3) body.\n\n(3,2) is body, (2,3) body, (4,3) body.\n\nBut (3,3) is head, moving Down to (3,2) which is occupied.\n\nIs there any free cell?\n\n(3,1) is body, index 6.\n\nWhat about (2,3)? Body.\n\nPerhaps I missed a cell.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3)\n\n(3,4) is body, index 1, and also Up is reverse, not allowed.\n\n(3,2) is body, index 7.\n\n(2,3) is body, index 11.\n\n(4,3) is body, index 3.\n\nAll occupied! But that can't be right; the snake is long, but there must be some free cells.\n\n(3,3) itself is head, but adjacent cells.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells from positions:\n\nAfter turn 89 move: positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied, (2,3) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (3,4) occupied.\n\nIndeed, all four directions are blocked by body or reverse.\n\nBut (3,4) is body, and Up is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (3,3), no safe move? That means death on turn 90.\n\nBut that can't be, because in previous turns, we had moves.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet's go back to turn 88.\n\nAt turn 88, head at (4,4), direction Up.\n\nWe said only possible move is Left to (3,4).\n\nBut after that, at turn 89, head at (3,4), direction Left, and only move was Down to (3,3).\n\nThen at (3,3), stuck.\n\nBut is there another way?\n\nAt turn 88, is there only one choice?\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,4) is under the body, but we can't eat it yet.\n\nOr maybe at turn 88, moving to (3,4) is necessary.\n\nBut then we get stuck.\n\nLet's list the grid state at turn 88.\n\nGrid: walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nSnake occupies: all positions listed.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,6), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,5), (6,6), etc. and (3,3), (3,4) is not free yet, but will be after moves.\n\nAt turn 88, head at (4,4), only move to (3,4) is free.\n\nThen after move, at turn 89, head at (3,4), and (3,3) is free, which is why we could move Down to (3,3).\n\nAt (3,3), it is surrounded.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to other directions at some point.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 88, when we move to (3,4), the cell (2,4) has food, but it's occupied by body, so we can't eat it now.\n\nThen at turn 89, from (3,4), we moved to (3,3), but we could have moved to other places? At turn 89, from (3,4), only (3,3) was free, as we saw.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (2,4): occupied\n\n- Up to (3,5): occupied\n\n- Down to (3,3): free\n\n- Right not allowed.\n\nSo only Down.\n\nThen to (3,3), and stuck.\n\nBut (3,3) is now head, and all adjacent are body: (3,4) is body, (3,2) is body, (2,3) is body, (4,3) is body.\n\n(4,3) is body, yes.\n\nSo the snake is trapped in a small area.\n\nBut there are free cells elsewhere, like (2,6) with food.\n\nBut how to get there?\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, at turn 88, we must go to (3,4), but then we need to find a way out.\n\nMaybe the snake can move towards the food.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,2), and as it moves, some cells free up.\n\nFor example, after turn 88 move to (3,4), tail at (6,3) now.\n\nThen after turn 89 move to (3,3), tail at (6,4).\n\nBut at turn 90, head at (3,3), and the cells around are still occupied.\n\nLet's see what cells are free at turn 90.\n\nAt turn 90, after move to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nFree cells include (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,6), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,5), (6,6), (5,7) but y=7 wall, so (5,6) is occupied, (6,5) free, etc.\n\nBut from (3,3), no adjacent free cell, so the snake dies on turn 90 if it moves to (3,3).\n\nBut that can't be the only path; perhaps I have a mistake in the initial move.\n\nAt turn 88, head at (4,4), direction Up.\n\nIs there a way to go Right? But (5,4) is occupied, so not.\n\nOr Up, occupied.\n\nSo only Left to (3,4).\n\nThen at turn 89, from (3,4), only Down to (3,3).\n\nThen stuck.\n\nBut perhaps at turn 89, when at (3,4), we can go to (3,5)? But (3,5) is occupied.\n\n(3,5) is body.\n\nOr (2,4) occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless the snake can eat food or something, but no food to eat here.\n\nThe food at (2,4) is under body, so we can't eat it yet.\n\nLife span 7, so we have time.\n\nBut at this rate, the snake dies in two turns.\n\nThat can't be right; I must have misread the positions.\n\nLet's list all snake positions again: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n\nSo at (4,4), adjacent:\n\n- North (U) (4,5): occupied by (4,5) in positions, index 15\n\n- South (D) (4,3): occupied by index 1, and also reverse, not allowed\n\n- West (L) (3,4): not in list, free\n\n- East (R) (5,4): occupied by index 19\n\nSo only (3,4) free.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) tail\n\nFrom (3,4), adjacent:\n\n- North (U) (3,5): occupied, index 15 in new list? Index 0 head (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (1,2), 9: (1,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (2,4), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (3,5), 16: (4,5), etc. so (3,5) is index 15, body.\n\n- South (D) (3,3): not in list, free\n\n- West (L) (2,4): occupied, index 11\n\n- East (R) (4,4): occupied, index 1, and also East is not reverse? Current direction is Left (since moved Left), so East would be opposite, reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only South (D) to (3,3) is possible and free.\n\nThen at (3,3), from above, all adjacent occupied.\n\nSo the snake is in a dead end.\n\nBut perhaps on turn 90, when at (3,3), if we move, but all moves are to body cells, so collision.\n\nUnless there is a free cell that I missed.\n\n(3,3) adjacent:\n\n- (3,4) body\n\n- (3,2) body (index 6 in new positions)\n\n- (2,3) body (index 10)\n\n- (4,3) body (index 2)\n\nAll body, so no, death on turn 90.\n\nBut that means for turn 88, we have to move to (3,4), and then die soon after.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; perhaps I need to consider that the tail is moving, but at this point, the tail is at (6,3) after turn 88, then at (6,4) after turn 89, but the head is far away, so the body around head doesn't change immediately.\n\nSo the snake will die unless it can find a way out.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,4) can be eaten if the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if we can vacate (2,4), then head can move to it.\n\nBut at turn 88, (2,4) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (3,4), (2,4) is still occupied by index 11.\n\nAfter turn 89 move to (3,3), (2,4) is still occupied.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe body at (2,4) will move when the snake moves, but it's not the tail, so it will take many moves to vacate.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,4) is index 11 in turn 88 positions, but after moves, it shifts.\n\nAt turn 88 after move, positions: 0:(3,4), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(4,2), 4:(4,1), 5:(3,1), 6:(3,2), 7:(2,2), 8:(1,2), 9:(1,3), 10:(2,3), 11:(2,4), 12:(1,4), 13:(1,5), 14:(2,5), 15:(3,5), 16:(4,5), 17:(4,6), 18:(5,6), 19:(5,5), 20:(5,4), 21:(6,4), 22:(6,3)\n\nAfter turn 89 move to (3,3): new head (3,3), body 0: (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (1,2), 9: (1,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (2,4), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (3,5), 16: (4,5), 17: (4,6), 18: (5,6), 19: (5,5), 20: (5,4), 21: (6,4), tail (6,3) gone, so (6,4) is new tail? Index 21 is (6,4), which was body, now tail.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nSo (2,4) is still occupied, index 11.\n\nIt will take many moves for this segment to move.\n\nFor example, when the head moves, the body shifts, but (2,4) will only move when the segment before it moves, which is not soon.\n\nSo at turn 90, from (3,3), no move, death.\n\nTherefore, for turn 88, the only possible action is L to (3,4), but it leads to death soon after.\n\nBut that means the snake will die, which is not good for maximizing score.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head direction or something.\n\nHead direction is U, at (4,4), so from (4,3) to (4,4), so up.\n\nMaybe the grid has more space.\n\nAnother cell: at (3,4), after moving, we have to go to (3,3), but (3,3) is free at that moment, but then surrounded.\n\nPerhaps on turn 89, from (3,4), instead of going to (3,3), but there is no other choice.\n\nUnless we can go to a different direction, but no.\n\nPerhaps the snake can go towards the tail or something.\n\nLet's look at the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, with food, life span 10.\n\nIf we can reach it.\n\nBut from current position, it's far, and we are stuck.\n\nPerhaps at turn 88, we can do something else, but there is no other move.\n\nUnless I consider that moving to a body cell is not always death if it's the tail, but the rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAh, that's important!\n\nI forgot that.\n\nYou can move to the tail cell because the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nSo for collision, head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to tail, the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for cells occupied by the tail, it is safe to move there, because the tail moves, so head and tail don't collide.\n\nFor other body segments, collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn 88, head at (4,4), tail at (6,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,5): occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\n- D to (4,3): occupied by body, not tail (index 1), and also reverse, not allowed.\n\n- L to (3,4): free, not occupied.\n\n- R to (5,4): occupied by body, index 19, (5,4), which is not tail, tail is (6,2), so collision.\n\nSo only L to (3,4) is safe.\n\nThen at turn 89, head at (3,4), tail at (6,3) after previous move.\n\nPositions: as before.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- L to (2,4): occupied by body, index 11, (2,4), not tail, tail is (6,3), so collision if move there.\n\n- U to (3,5): occupied, index 15, not tail, collision.\n\n- D to (3,3): free, safe.\n\n- R to (4,4): occupied, index 1, not tail, and also reverse not allowed? Current direction is Left, so Right is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (3,3).\n\nThen at turn 90, head at (3,3), tail at (6,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) tail.\n\nNow, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,4): occupied by body, index 1, (3,4), not tail, so collision.\n\n- D to (3,2): occupied by body, index 7, (3,2), not tail, collision.\n\n- L to (2,3): occupied by body, index 10, (2,3), not tail, collision.\n\n- R to (4,3): occupied by body, index 3, (4,3), not tail, collision.\n\nAnd tail is at (6,4), far away.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied by non-tail body segments, so moving to any would cause collision.\n\nNo move to tail, so death on turn 90.\n\nBut this is a problem.\n\nUnless on turn 89, from (3,4), we can move to a different cell, but no.\n\nPerhaps at turn 88, we can move to the tail or something, but tail is at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo it seems the snake is in a position where it must move to (3,4) on turn 88, then to (3,3) on turn 89, then die on turn 90.\n\nBut that can't be the case for the game; perhaps I need to output the moves until death.\n\nBut the AI should maximize score, so maybe eat food before dying.\n\nBut here, no food to eat immediately.\n\nThe food at (2,4) is under body, so not accessible.\n\nLife span 7, so it might disappear before we can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is free, but we can't reach it from here.\n\nSo for turn 88, the only action is L.\n\nThen turn 89, D.\n\nThen turn 90, no safe move, so death.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, there is a move to the tail, but tail is not adjacent.\n\nDistance: from (3,3) to (6,4) is not adjacent.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother possibility: the head is adjacent to the tail in some cases, but not here.\n\nSo I think for turn 88, we have to go L.\n\nThen for turn 89, D.\n\nThen for turn 90, all moves lead to death, so perhaps the game ends.\n\nBut let's confirm the state.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle: (5,2) is wall, but not relevant here.\n\nOr perhaps I misread the positions.\n\nList the positions in order:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nThen: (4,3)  // body\n\n(4,2)  // body\n\n(4,1)  // body\n\n(3,1)  // body\n\n(3,2)  // body\n\n(2,2)  // body\n\n(1,2)  // body\n\n(1,3)  // body\n\n(2,3)  // body\n\n(2,4)  // body with food under it\n\n(1,4)  // body\n\n(1,5)  // body\n\n(2,5)  // body\n\n(3,5)  // body\n\n(4,5)  // body\n\n(4,6)  // body\n\n(5,6)  // body\n\n(5,5)  // body\n\n(5,4)  // body\n\n(6,4)  // body\n\n(6,3)  // body\n\n(6,2)  // tail\n\nYes.\n\nAt (4,4), only (3,4) free.\n\nMove to (3,4).\n\nThen at (3,4), only (3,3) free.\n\nMove to (3,3).\n\nThen at (3,3), no free adjacent cells, all body, so death.\n\nSo for the answer, I should output the moves until possible.\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nThen on turn 90, no safe move, so perhaps stop or something.\n\nBut the AI has to choose an action, and if all actions lead to death, it might choose one, but it dies.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, but here no long-term.\n\nBut there is food at (2,6), which we could try to reach, but from current position, it's impossible in two moves.\n\nDistance: from (4,4) to (2,6) is about 4 cells away, but with body in between.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), still far.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps the snake can go towards the tail area.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (6,2), and there might be free cells near there.\n\nBut from head at (4,4), to go to (6,2), but it's not straight.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), then to (3,3), then if we could go to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, and not tail.\n\nAt turn 90, if we move to (3,2), it is body, so collision.\n\nUnless at that time it is tail, but not.\n\nSo I think the snake will die on turn 90.\n\nFor the answer, I should output:\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nAnd for turn 90, since no safe move, but I have to choose, so perhaps U or something, but it dies.\n\nBut to maximize, we can choose a move that might allow survival if possible, but here no.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,4) is under the body, so if we can move the body away.\n\nBut at turn 88, if we move to (3,4), then the body at (2,4) is still there.\n\nThe segment at (2,4) will only move when the snake moves many times, but the head is trapped before that.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps for turn 88, we can go to a different direction, but no other choice.\n\nSo I think for the answer, we have to do:\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nThen for turn 90, say U, but it dies.\n\nBut let's see the life span of food.\n\nTurn 88, food at (2,4) life span 7, so available until turn 94 (since on turn 88, life span 7, so after 7 turns, on turn 95 it disappears. Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 88, life span 7, turn 89:6, turn 90:5, ..., turn 94:1, turn 95:0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 10, gone at turn 98.\n\nBut we can't reach it.\n\nSo for the output, I'll put the moves for two turns, and for turn 90, since it's the last possible, but the format requires actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but in this case, we can only do 2 turns.\n\nPerhaps output actions for as long as possible.\n\nBut for turn 90, no action, so only two actions.\n\nBut the format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, we choose a move that goes to a body cell, but it dies, so no point.\n\nI think I should output:\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nAnd that's it for the safe moves, but the format might expect more.\n\nPerhaps I missed a free cell at some point.\n\nLet's list all free cells at turn 88.\n\nGrid size 8x8, walls at borders and (5,2).\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,2) wall.\n\nSnake occupies 23 cells.\n\nTotal cells: 6x6 = 36, minus 1 wall, so 35 cells, snake 23, so 12 free cells.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,5), (6,6), (3,4) is free but will be occupied after move, etc.\n\nAt turn 88, free cells include (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,5), (6,6), and also (4,0) but y=0 wall, so not, (0,4) wall, etc.\n\nSo (3,4) is free, which we move to.\n\nAfter that, at turn 89, free cells include (3,3), etc.\n\nBut from head position, no other choices.\n\nSo I think for the answer, I'll output L for turn 88 and D for turn 89, and for turn 90, since no safe move, but to complete, say U, but it dies.\n\nBut let's assume that on turn 90, we move U to (3,4), but it is body, collision, death.\n\nSimilarly for other directions.\n\nSo perhaps the game ends.\n\nBut for the sake of the response, I'll provide the two moves.\n\nBut the user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan for more if possible.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, we can go to (3,4), then from there, instead of going to (3,3), but we have to.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 89, from (3,4), we can go to (2,4) if it were tail, but it's not.\n\nOr if we can eat food, but (2,4) is occupied, so not.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to accept that the snake can only make two moves.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nAnd for turn 90, I'll put U, even though it dies, to have three moves.\n\nBut let's see the rules: \"prioritize long-term survival\", but here no long-term.\n\nPerhaps for turn 88, we can do something else, but no.\n\nOr perhaps the head direction allows other interpretations, but no.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (2,6). If we can survive, we might go there.\n\nBut from current, we can't.\n\nSo for the output, I'll do:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: D\nTurn 90: U\n}\n\nBut on turn 90, moving U to (3,4) which is body, collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, any move dies.\n\nSo the snake scores 0, no food eaten.\n\nBut there is positive food, but we didn't eat.\n\nLife span of (2,4) is 7, so if we can vacate (2,4), we can eat it.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,4) is the 10th segment in initial list.\n\nAfter moves, it takes at least 10 moves for it to move, but the head is stuck before that.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, I think the only way is to output the moves until death.\n\nSo for turn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: D\n\nTurn 90: U (or any, since all die)\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, we can choose a move that doesn't die if possible, but no.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 88):**\n- **Snake Head**: At (4,4), direction Up (U).\n- **Snake Body**: Occupies 23 cells, including key segments like (4,5), (5,4), and (2,4) (which has positive food underneath but is currently occupied by the body).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,4): Positive food (value +1), life span 7 (disappears at turn 95).\n  - (2,6): Positive food (value +1), life span 10 (disappears at turn 98).\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Immediate Constraints**: \n  - From (4,4), moving Up (to (4,5)) or Right (to (5,4)) causes body collision (not tail). Down is instant reverse (forbidden). Only Left (to (3,4)) is safe.\n  - After moving to (3,4), the snake faces limited options due to body congestion. Only Down (to (3,3)) is safe on turn 89.\n  - On turn 90, from (3,3), all adjacent cells are occupied by non-tail body segments, leading to inevitable death on turn 90 regardless of the move chosen. No food can be eaten before this point due to the trapped position.\n\n**Key Risks and Opportunities:**\n- **Food at (2,4)**: Occupied by body; cannot be eaten until the body moves away. Life span allows until turn 94, but the snake will die before this can happen.\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Accessible but too far (4 cells away). Reaching it requires 4+ turns, but the snake dies on turn 90.\n- **Survival Priority**: With death unavoidable on turn 90, no long-term planning is possible. The priority is to survive as long as possible and output the forced moves until death.\n\n**Move-by-Move Reasoning (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Turn 88 (Current)**: Only safe move is Left (L) to (3,4). (Up and Right cause collision; Down is reverse forbidden.)\n- **Turn 89**: From (3,4), direction Left. Only safe move is Down (D) to (3,3). (Left to (2,4) and Up to (3,5) cause collision; Right is reverse forbidden.)\n- **Turn 90**: From (3,3), direction Down. All adjacent cells are body-occupied (not tail):\n  - Up (U) to (3,4): Body collision.\n  - Down (D) to (3,2): Body collision.\n  - Left (L) to (2,3): Body collision.\n  - Right (R) to (4,3): Body collision.\n  No safe move exists; choosing Up (U) as a default, but death occurs.\n- **Beyond Turn 90**: Death on turn 90; no further moves possible. No food is eaten in this sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe snake is in an inescapable trap due to body congestion. The only valid sequence is to move Left on turn 88 and Down on turn 89, followed by a fatal move on turn 90. Long-term survival or food collection is impossible, so the actions are limited to the forced moves until death.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: L  \nTurn 89: D  \nTurn 90: U  \n}",

        "score": 22,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 89, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles.\n\nThe grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, I think? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means x=0 and x=7 are walls, and y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid is 8x8, but since walls are at the edges, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]\n\nLet me list these with indices to see the head and tail.\n\nHead is at (3,4), which is index 0. Then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) is the tail.\n\n(6,3) is the last one, so tail is at (6,3).\n\nNow, head direction is L, which is left. So the snake is moving left, meaning from (3,4) to (4,4) was previous move? Let's see the positions: head is (3,4), and next is (4,4), which is to the right? That doesn't make sense with direction left.\n\nHead direction is the current direction it's facing, so since it's moving left, the head is at (3,4), and it just moved left to get there? Or is it about to move?\n\nThe state says \"Snake Head Direction: L\", which I think means the direction it is currently facing, so for the next move, it can choose to go in a new direction, but with no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head position is (3,4), and the direction is L, meaning it was moving left to get to (3,4). Let's see the previous position.\n\nThe positions are listed from head to tail, so head is (3,4), then (4,4), which is to the right of (3,4)? (3,4) to (4,4) is +x, right? But direction is left? Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Snake positions: [(3,4), (4,4), ...] so head is (3,4), and the next segment is (4,4). Since it's head first, the head is at (3,4), and it moved from (4,4) to (3,4)? But that would be left, from (4,4) to (3,4) is decreasing x, so left.\n\nAh, yes: from (4,4) to (3,4) is moving left. So the head was at (4,4) before moving left to (3,4). So current head position is (3,4), and it just moved left to get there. Therefore, for the next move, it can go U, D, L, or R, but not R because R is opposite to L, so no instant reverse. Opposite of left is right, so it cannot move right on the next turn.\n\nHead direction is L, meaning it is facing left, so it cannot move right immediately, as that would be reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): up, down, left. Not right.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,4,6,1) I think this is (x,y, life_span, value). The format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's written as (2,4,6,1), so probably (x=2, y=4, life_span=6, value=1)\n\nSimilarly, (2,6,9,1) is (x=2, y=6, life_span=9, value=1)\n\nBoth are positive food since value=1.\n\nLife_span: for (2,4) it's 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is t=89, so at turn 89, life_span is 6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns, meaning on turn 95 it will be gone? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at the start of turn t+L, it's gone? Or after the turn?\n\nTypically, countdown decreases each turn, so if at turn t, life_span is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that on the turn when it is present, countdown starts at N, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? But for eating, it can be eaten as long as it's there.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, it can be eaten during turn t, and after turn t, if L>1, it stays with L-1, else if L=1, it disappears after turn t.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate; for now, at turn 89, food at (2,4) has life_span=6, so it will be there for 6 more turns, including turn 89, so it can be eaten on turns 89 to 94, and disappears on turn 95.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) has life_span=9, so there for turns 89 to 97.\n\nBoth are value=1, positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nBody: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  <-- tail\n\n(6,3) is tail.\n\nNow, food at (2,4) and (2,6).\n\n(2,4) is also occupied by the snake? Let's see: positions include (2,4), which is the 12th segment? List indices:\n\n0: head (3,4)\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (4,2)\n\n4: (4,1)\n\n5: (3,1)\n\n6: (3,2)\n\n7: (2,2)\n\n8: (1,2)\n\n9: (1,3)\n\n10: (2,3)\n\n11: (2,4)  <-- this is a body segment\n\n12: (1,4)\n\n13: (1,5)\n\n14: (2,5)\n\n15: (3,5)\n\n16: (4,5)\n\n17: (4,6)\n\n18: (5,6)\n\n19: (5,5)\n\n20: (5,4)\n\n21: (6,4)\n\n22: (6,3) tail\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied by the snake's body at position 11.\n\nBut there is food at (2,4) as well. Special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) has food and is occupied by the snake body.\n\nTo eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,4), and then head moves to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,6), which is not occupied? (2,6): let's see if it's in snake positions. Positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), etc. (2,6) not listed, so it's free.\n\n(2,6) is not occupied, so food can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n\nNow, current head at (3,4), direction left.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): up to (3,5), down to (3,3), left to (2,4), right to (4,4) but right is opposite to left, so cannot move right. No instant reverse.\n\nSo choices: U, D, L.\n\n- U: to (3,5)\n\n- D: to (3,3)\n\n- L: to (2,4)\n\nNow, (2,4) has food but is currently occupied by body. If I move left to (2,4), since it's occupied, I would collide with body and die. But the rule is: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves.\n\nGeneral rule: when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail, because the tail will move forward, so it's safe.\n\nIn this case, (2,4) is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (6,3).\n\nSo moving to (2,4) would cause collision with body, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move left to (2,4) now because it's occupied.\n\nNow, U to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied? Positions: (3,5) is position 15, which is body. Similarly, moving to (3,5) would collide with body.\n\nD to (3,3): is (3,3) occupied? Looking at positions: (4,3) is position 2, (3,2) is 6, (2,3) is 10, no (3,3) listed, so (3,3) is free? Let's list all positions:\n\nFrom above: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\n(3,3) not in list, so free.\n\n(3,3) is not occupied, and not wall, so I can move down to (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is occupied, so cannot move up.\n\nLeft to (2,4) is occupied, cannot.\n\nRight not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (3,3)? Is that right?\n\nBut (3,5) is occupied, so up is invalid.\n\nDown to (3,3) is free, as per positions.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAlso, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is within 1-6,1-6, and internal obstacle at (5,2), not affecting.\n\nSo yes, from (3,4), only possible move is down to (3,3), since up and left are occupied, right not allowed.\n\nBut that seems too constrained. Let me double-check.\n\nHead at (3,4), body segments: (4,4) is directly adjacent, but when I move, the head moves to new cell, and the body follows.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), which is empty, then head goes to (3,3), and the tail moves, so (4,4) becomes new head? No.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (3,3), then the body: the segment that was at (3,4) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions: head was (3,4), after move down to (3,3), new head is (3,3).\n\nThen, the segment that was at index 1, (4,4), moves to (3,4), which was head position.\n\nThen index 2 (4,3) moves to (4,4), and so on, tail moves from (6,3) to the position of the second last segment.\n\nBut for collision, when moving to (3,3), it is empty, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I could move to (3,5), it is occupied by body, so collision.\n\n(2,4) occupied, collision.\n\nSo indeed, only down to (3,3) is possible? But that seems like the only choice, but I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I can move in other directions if I consider future moves, but for now, at turn 89, only down is possible to avoid death.\n\nBut let's list all adjacent cells to (3,4):\n\n- Up: (3,5) - occupied by snake body at (3,5) position 15\n\n- Down: (3,3) - not occupied, free\n\n- Left: (2,4) - occupied by snake body at (2,4) position 11\n\n- Right: (4,4) - but right is opposite direction? No, direction constraint is only for input, not for occupancy.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied by body position 1, so cannot move there anyway, and also cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction left.\n\nCurrent direction is left, so cannot move right.\n\nTherefore, only down to (3,3) is safe and possible.\n\nSo for turn 89, I must move down to (3,3).\n\nBut then I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the move.\n\nTurn 89: move down to (3,3).\n\nNew head position: (3,3)\n\nNew direction: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n\nSnake positions after move: head at (3,3), then the body: the segment that was head moves to new position, so the new body is: (3,4) which was head, now becomes segment 1, but positions shift.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,3)\n\nThen, the previous head (3,4) is now the first body segment.\n\nThen, previous segment 1 (4,4) is now segment 2, and so on, up to tail.\n\nThe tail was (6,3), which moves to the position of the previous segment 21, which is (6,4)? Let's list.\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0 to 22.\n\nAfter move down:\n\n- New head: (3,3)\n\n- New segment 1: previous head (3,4)\n\n- New segment 2: previous seg1 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 3: previous seg2 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 4: previous seg3 (4,2)\n\n- New segment 5: previous seg4 (4,1)\n\n- New segment 6: previous seg5 (3,1)\n\n- New segment 7: previous seg6 (3,2)\n\n- New segment 8: previous seg7 (2,2)\n\n- New segment 9: previous seg8 (1,2)\n\n- New segment 10: previous seg9 (1,3)\n\n- New segment 11: previous seg10 (2,3)\n\n- New segment 12: previous seg11 (2,4)\n\n- New segment 13: previous seg12 (1,4)\n\n- New segment 14: previous seg13 (1,5)\n\n- New segment 15: previous seg14 (2,5)\n\n- New segment 16: previous seg15 (3,5)\n\n- New segment 17: previous seg16 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 18: previous seg17 (4,6)\n\n- New segment 19: previous seg18 (5,6)\n\n- New segment 20: previous seg19 (5,5)\n\n- New segment 21: previous seg20 (5,4)\n\n- New segment 22: previous seg21 (6,4)  // tail moves to (6,4)\n\nPrevious tail was (6,3), which is lost, and the segment that was at (6,4) is now tail? Let's see: previous segment 21 was (6,4), but after move, the new tail comes from the previous second last.\n\nPrevious positions: seg0 (3,4), seg1 (4,4), ..., seg21 (6,4), seg22 (6,3)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,3), the new body is: seg0 becomes (3,4), which is the position of previous seg0.\n\nThen new seg1 is previous seg0 position: (3,4)\n\nNew seg2 is previous seg1: (4,4)\n\n...\n\nNew seg21 is previous seg20: (5,4)\n\nNew seg22 is previous seg21: (6,4)\n\nAnd previous seg22 (6,3) is no longer part of snake, so the cell (6,3) is now free.\n\nNew tail is at (6,4).\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nNow, head direction is down.\n\nFood: (2,4) with life_span=6, value=1. At turn 89, it had life_span=6, after turn 89, it decreases to 5? Since countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 89, life_span=6, so after turn 89, it becomes 5 for turn 90.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life_span=9, after turn 89, 8 for turn 90.\n\nNow, for turn 90, head at (3,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,3), can go U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse, current direction down, so cannot move up (opposite).\n\nSo possible: down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3).\n\nNow, check occupancy:\n\n(3,2): is it occupied? In new positions, (3,2) is segment 7? Positions: seg7 is (3,2), yes, occupied by body.\n\n(2,3): seg11 is (2,3), occupied.\n\n(4,3): seg3 is (4,3), occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied? That can't be right.\n\nHead at (3,3)\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- Up (3,4): which is new segment 1, occupied\n\n- Down (3,2): new segment 7, occupied\n\n- Left (2,3): new segment 11, occupied? Seg11 is (2,3), yes\n\n- Right (4,3): new segment 3, (4,3), occupied\n\nAll four directions are occupied by body segments. But that means I cannot move anywhere without colliding!\n\nBut that can't be, because the snake is long, but there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the move.\n\nAt turn 89, head at (3,4), I moved down to (3,3), which was free, no problem.\n\nNow at (3,3), the cells around are all body, so no safe move.\n\nBut let's list the new positions again.\n\nNew positions after turn 89 move:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Seg1: (3,4)  // previous head\n\n- Seg2: (4,4)  // previous seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,3)  // previous seg2\n\n- Seg4: (4,2)  // previous seg3\n\n- Seg5: (4,1)  // previous seg4\n\n- Seg6: (3,1)  // previous seg5\n\n- Seg7: (3,2)  // previous seg6\n\n- Seg8: (2,2)  // previous seg7\n\n- Seg9: (1,2)  // previous seg8\n\n- Seg10: (1,3)  // previous seg9\n\n- Seg11: (2,3)  // previous seg10\n\n- Seg12: (2,4)  // previous seg11\n\n- Seg13: (1,4)  // previous seg12\n\n- Seg14: (1,5)  // previous seg13\n\n- Seg15: (2,5)  // previous seg14\n\n- Seg16: (3,5)  // previous seg15\n\n- Seg17: (4,5)  // previous seg16\n\n- Seg18: (4,6)  // previous seg17\n\n- Seg19: (5,6)  // previous seg18\n\n- Seg20: (5,5)  // previous seg19\n\n- Seg21: (5,4)  // previous seg20\n\n- Seg22: (6,4)  // previous seg21, tail\n\nCells around (3,3):\n\n- North: (3,4) - occupied by seg1\n\n- South: (3,2) - occupied by seg7\n\n- West: (2,3) - occupied by seg11\n\n- East: (4,3) - occupied by seg3\n\nAll occupied, so no possible move. Snake would die on turn 90.\n\nBut that can't be the case; I must have made a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,4) is under the body, but when the body moves, it might free up.\n\nAt turn 89, when I moved to (3,3), the body at (2,4) is still there, but in the new positions, (2,4) is seg12.\n\nFor turn 90, head at (3,3), to move to any adjacent cell, all are occupied, so collision.\n\nBut that means the snake is trapped and will die next turn.\n\nBut that seems odd for the state to be given if it's immediately fatal.\n\nPerhaps I misread the initial state.\n\nInitial head at (3,4), and I could only move down to (3,3), which led to trap.\n\nBut maybe at turn 89, there is another move? But earlier I thought only down is possible.\n\nLet's recheck initial state.\n\nTurn 89, head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by body seg15 (3,5), so if I move there, collision.\n\nD to (3,3), not occupied, free.\n\nL to (2,4), occupied by seg11 (2,4), collision.\n\nR to (4,4), occupied by seg1 (4,4), and also cannot move right because opposite direction.\n\nSo only D to (3,3) is possible.\n\nThen after that, as above, all adjacent cells are occupied, so on turn 90, no move, death.\n\nBut that can't be right. Perhaps the snake can move to the tail cell if the tail is moving away.\n\nFor example, if the tail is at a position, and I move to it, it might be safe if the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, at (3,3), the south cell (3,2) is occupied, but (3,2) is not the tail; tail is at (6,4).\n\n(3,2) is a body segment, so moving to it would collide.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it seems the snake is in a position where after moving down, it is surrounded.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that on turn 89, I have to move down, and on turn 90, I die, but that means game over, but the AI is supposed to play, so maybe it's the only choice.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (2,6), which is free, but I can't reach it from here.\n\nAnother thing: the special case about tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nPerhaps I misidentified the positions.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells at turn 89 before move.\n\nCells: from positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (4,0) but y=0 wall, so not, (5,1), (5,2) obstacle, (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\nBut for head at (3,4), only (3,3) is free adjacent cell.\n\nSo yes, only move down to (3,3).\n\nThen after move, as above, (3,3) is head, and all adjacent are occupied.\n\nSo for turn 90, no safe move, snake dies.\n\nBut that means for turn 89, I have to move down, and that's it, no future turns.\n\nBut the answer format requires multiple turns, so perhaps I need to include turn 89 only, or something.\n\nBut the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but in this case, it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can move to a cell that will be freed.\n\nBut at turn 89, only one choice.\n\nAnother possibility: the food under body at (2,4), but to eat it, I need the body to move away first.\n\nBut at turn 89, I can't move to (2,4) because it's occupied.\n\nSo I have to move away, then later come back.\n\nBut in this case, I moved down to (3,3), then stuck.\n\nPerhaps after moving down, on turn 90, some cells are free, but in my calculation, all adjacent are occupied.\n\nLet's list the new positions again after turn 89 move down:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nNow, cells around (3,3): (3,4) occupied, (3,2) occupied, (2,3) occupied, (4,3) occupied.\n\n(3,2) is part of body, (2,3) is part of body, etc.\n\nNo free cell, so indeed, no move possible on turn 90.\n\nTherefore, for turn 89, I must move down, and on turn 90, I die.\n\nBut that seems bleak. Perhaps the state has a mistake, or I misread.\n\nAnother idea: when the snake moves, the tail moves, so some cells are freed.\n\nIn this case, when I moved to (3,3), the tail was at (6,3), which is now free, but that's far away, not adjacent to head.\n\nFor the head at (3,3), the adjacent cells are all occupied by body segments that are not moving away immediately; they are fixed for that turn.\n\nSo at the time of move, if head moves to a body cell, it collides.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps for turn 89, the only action is down, and then game over.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,6), which is free, but I can't reach it.\n\nOr (2,4) food under body.\n\nBut at turn 89, I can't eat it.\n\nAfter moving down, on turn 90, I die, so no.\n\nUnless on turn 89, there is another way.\n\nDirection constraint: I can move U or D or L, but U and L are occupied.\n\nL to (2,4) is occupied, so collision if I move there.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to a cell that the tail is leaving, but in this case, for (3,4), the tail is at (6,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that on turn 89, move down to (3,3), and that's the only action.\n\nFor the answer, I should output turn 89: D\n\nBut the format says to output multiple turns, but since it dies on next turn, I can only output one.\n\nBut let's assume that on turn 90, it dies, so no action.\n\nBut the AI should avoid death, but here it's unavoidable.\n\nPerhaps I missed a free cell.\n\nLet's list all cells to see if there's a free cell adjacent to (3,4).\n\nGrid: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6.\n\nOccupied: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,5), (6,6), and (5,2) is obstacle, so not free.\n\n(3,3) is free, which is down.\n\n(3,6) is free, but not adjacent to (3,4); adjacent are (3,5) occupied, (3,3) free, (2,4) occupied, (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only (3,3) free.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output turn 89: D, and that's it.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,4) with life_span 6, so it has time, but I can't reach it now.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) with life_span 9.\n\nBut since I die on turn 90, no point.\n\nPerhaps after moving down, on turn 90, if I could move, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: is (3,2) the tail or something? No, tail is at (6,4) after move.\n\nIn the new positions, (3,2) is seg7, not tail.\n\nSo moving to (3,2) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think I have to proceed with move down on turn 89.\n\nThen for future turns, since I die, I can't plan.\n\nBut maybe for the sake of the exercise, I need to assume I can move, but it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps at turn 89, the direction allows me to move in other ways, but no.\n\nOr perhaps the no instant reverse is only for the next move, but for this move, I can choose any except opposite.\n\nBut in this case, only down is possible.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nThen for the answer, I'll output turn 89: D\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" etc., so for turn 89 only.\n\nBut let's confirm the life-span of food.\n\nAt turn 89, food at (2,4) life_span 6, so after turn 89, it becomes 5 for turn 90.\n\nBut since I die on turn 90, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for turn 89, action is D (down).\n\nThen for turn 90, no action since dead.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I should only output the possible actions.\n\nPerhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's count the positions: there are 23 positions, so snake length 23.\n\nPositions list has 23 elements, from 0 to 22.\n\nHead (3,4), tail (6,3) initially.\n\nAfter move to (3,3), tail at (6,4).\n\nBut still, head trapped.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,4) can be eaten later if I free it.\n\nBut I can't from here.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 89, I move down to (3,3), then on turn 90, if I could move, but I can't, so no.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (5,2) is not relevant.\n\nOr walls.\n\nBut I think it's correct.\n\nSo for turn 89, I must move down.\n\nThen for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 89: D\n}\n\nBut since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but in this case, it's not possible, so only one turn.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, there is a move if I consider the tail moving, but no, the cells are occupied by middle body.\n\nFor example, if I move to (3,2), which is occupied, but if (3,2) is the tail, it might be safe, but it's not the tail; tail is far.\n\nIn this case, (3,2) is not tail, so collision.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nI'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 89)\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (3,4), with direction Left (L). The snake body occupies multiple cells, including (2,4) where positive food is located under the body. The tail is at (6,3).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,4): Value +1, life_span 6 (disappears after turn 94, can be eaten on turns 89-94).\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life_span 9 (disappears after turn 97, can be eaten on turns 89-97).\n- **Grid Constraints**: \n  - Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7), so playable area is (1,1) to (6,6).\n  - Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Immediate Moves at Turn 89**:\n  - From head (3,4), possible moves: Up (U) to (3,5), Down (D) to (3,3), Left (L) to (2,4), Right (R) to (4,4).\n  - Right (R) is opposite to current direction (L), so invalid (no instant reverse).\n  - (3,5) is occupied by body segment (3,5) (position 15 in initial state), so moving Up causes collision and death.\n  - (2,4) is occupied by body segment (2,4) (position 11 in initial state), so moving Left causes collision and death.\n  - (3,3) is free (not occupied by body, wall, or obstacle), so moving Down is safe.\n  - **Conclusion for Turn 89**: Only Down (D) to (3,3) is possible to avoid immediate death.\n\nAfter moving Down to (3,3) on turn 89:\n- New head position: (3,3), direction Down (D).\n- New snake positions: Head (3,3), body segments: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) (tail).\n- **Food Life-Span Update**:\n  - (2,4): Life_span decreases to 5 (available until turn 94).\n  - (2,6): Life_span decreases to 8 (available until turn 97).\n- **Turn 90 Moves**:\n  - From (3,3), possible moves: Up (U) to (3,4), Down (D) to (3,2), Left (L) to (2,3), Right (R) to (4,3).\n  - Up (U) is opposite to current direction (D), so invalid.\n  - (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), and (4,3) are all occupied by body segments in the new positions:\n    - (3,4) is body segment 1.\n    - (3,2) is body segment 7.\n    - (2,3) is body segment 11.\n    - (4,3) is body segment 3.\n  - All adjacent cells are occupied, and none are the tail (tail is at (6,4)), so any move results in body collision and death on turn 90.\n\n### Long-Term Planning and Risk Avoidance\n- **Turn 89 Constraint**: Moving Down (D) is the only safe action on turn 89, as other moves cause immediate death.\n- **Turn 90 Outcome**: After moving Down, the snake is trapped with no safe moves on turn 90, leading to inevitable death. Thus, planning beyond turn 89 is not feasible.\n- **Food Considerations**: \n  - Food at (2,4) is under the body and cannot be eaten immediately. Freeing it would require the body to move away, but the snake cannot reach a safe path to do so.\n  - Food at (2,6) is accessible but cannot be reached due to the impending trap.\n- **Prioritize Survival**: Since death is unavoidable on turn 90, the focus is on surviving turn 89 with the only possible action.\n\n### Action Plan\n- Turn 89: Move Down (D) to (3,3) to avoid immediate death.\n- Turn 90: No action possible; snake dies due to body collision.\n\nGiven the constraints, only one action can be taken.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 89: D\n}",

That means from (3,3), moving down would go to (3,2), but let's see the positions: the head is at (3,3), and the next segment is (3,4). Head direction is D, down. But (3,4) is above (3,3), since y increases up or down? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but let's look at the movement.\n\nMovement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases upwards. D is (x,y-1), so y decreases downwards. So (3,4) to (3,3) is moving down, from higher y to lower y. Yes, head at (3,3) with direction D, so it came from (3,4) to (3,3) by moving down.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,4) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nLife span: for (2,4), it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so it has 5 turns left starting from turn 90. Similarly, (2,6) has 8 turns left.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSnake positions: list all to see where it is.\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nThen: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nThat's 23 positions. Let's plot this on a grid mentally.\n\nStart from head: (3,3)\n\nNext: (3,4) - above it\n\nThen (4,4) - right\n\n(4,3) - down\n\n(4,2) - down\n\n(4,1) - down\n\n(3,1) - left\n\n(3,2) - up\n\n(2,2) - left\n\n(1,2) - left\n\n(1,3) - up\n\n(2,3) - right\n\n(2,4) - up\n\n(1,4) - left\n\n(1,5) - up\n\n(2,5) - right\n\n(3,5) - right\n\n(4,5) - right? (3,5) to (4,5) is right, x from 3 to 4\n\n(4,6) - up, y from 5 to 6\n\n(5,6) - right, x from 4 to 5\n\n(5,5) - down, y from 6 to 5\n\n(5,4) - down, y from 5 to 4\n\n(6,4) - right, x from 5 to 6\n\nTail is at (6,4)\n\nNow, food at (2,4) and (2,6)\n\n(2,4) is a food position, but looking at snake positions, (2,4) is part of the snake body! In the list, (2,4) is the 13th position: positions are 0:head (3,3), 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,1), 6:(3,1), 7:(3,2), 8:(2,2), 9:(1,2), 10:(1,3), 11:(2,3), 12:(2,4), 13:(1,4), etc. So (2,4) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the 12th segment.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,4) is under the snake body.\n\nThe rules say food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail is at (6,4), and food is at (2,4) and (2,6), not near tail.\n\nCurrent head position (3,3) with direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: since direction is D, I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right), but not U (up) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so opposite is U, so cannot move up. Can move D, L, or R.\n\nNow, from (3,3):\n\n- Down (D): to (3,2)\n\n- Left (L): to (2,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,3)\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (3,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,2) is the 7th segment, but when we move, the snake moves, so we need to see if it's a body part or if it will be vacated.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its position, so cells occupied by body might change.\n\nFor collision: head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n\nRule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment except that it can move into the tail cell since tail moves.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for a cell to be safe to move to, it must not be a wall, not be a body segment except the tail cell.\n\nAlso, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (5,2).\n\nNow, current snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nTail is (6,4).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- D: (3,2) - is this occupied? (3,2) is in positions, it's the 7th segment. But when we move down to (3,2), the tail will move from (6,4), so (3,2) is not the tail, it's a body segment. So moving to (3,2) would collide with body, death. Not safe.\n\nConfirm: head moves to (3,2), but (3,2) is currently occupied by a body segment (not tail), and since tail moves, (3,2) might still be occupied or not? When head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift, so the segment that was at (3,2) moves to where the head was, I think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n\nBut for collision, at the moment of movement, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the tail, it collides.\n\nSpecifically: after movement, if head is on a cell that has any body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail cell, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (3,2) is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (6,4). So moving to (3,2) would place head on a body segment, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, L: to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is in positions, it's the 11th segment. Not tail, so moving there would collide.\n\nR: to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is the 3rd segment. Not tail, so collision?\n\nBut let's list current occupied cells except tail: all positions except tail are occupied.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), and body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), and tail (6,4). So all these are occupied now.\n\nWhen we move, head moves to a new position, say to (4,3). But (4,3) is currently occupied by the 3rd segment. After movement, the head is at (4,3), and the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,3), and so on, down to tail.\n\nBut at the time of movement, when head moves to (4,3), if (4,3) was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, then it collides because the head is moving into a cell that is still occupied.\n\nThe rule is: head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by any part of the body except the tail.\n\nIn this case, for (4,3), it is occupied by a body segment (index 3), not tail, so moving there causes collision.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2) and (2,3).\n\nBut what about moving to tail? Tail is at (6,4), not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo all possible moves: D to (3,2) - occupied by body, not tail.\n\nL to (2,3) - occupied by body, not tail.\n\nR to (4,3) - occupied by body, not tail.\n\nU to (3,4) - but U is opposite direction? Current direction is D (down), so moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nAnd (3,4) is also occupied, it's the first body segment.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are occupied by body? That can't be right; the snake must have a way to move.\n\nPerhaps I misread the positions.\n\nHead at (3,3)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,4) - occupied by body\n\n- Down: (3,2) - occupied by body\n\n- Left: (2,3) - occupied by body\n\n- Right: (4,3) - occupied by body\n\nAll four directions are occupied? But that means the snake is surrounded by its own body.\n\nLet's list all positions again:\n\nSnake: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSo cells around (3,3):\n\n- (3,4): occupied, body\n\n- (3,2): occupied, body\n\n- (2,3): occupied, body\n\n- (4,3): occupied, body\n\nYes, all adjacent cells are occupied by body segments. So no safe move? But that can't be, because the snake is moving, and it should be able to move to where the tail was or something, but in this case, the tail is far away.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but for the head to move to a cell, that cell must be empty or the tail cell at that moment.\n\nBut here, all adjacent cells are occupied by non-tail body parts, so moving to any of them would cause collision because those cells are not vacated yet.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (4,3), but (4,3) is currently occupied by the segment at index 3, which is not moving away immediately; only after the head moves, the body shifts.\n\nBut at the instant the head moves to (4,3), the body segment is still there, so collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut that means the snake is trapped and will die on the next move? But that seems odd for the game state.\n\nPerhaps I have a mistake in the positions.\n\nAnother possibility: the snake positions are given in order, but when moving, the head moves, and the tail moves, so some cells become free.\n\nBut for the head's move, we need to check the current state before movement.\n\nAccording to the rules, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides.\n\nIn this case, all adjacent cells are occupied by body segments that are not tail, so no valid move? But that can't be right.\n\nLet's check the direction. Head direction is D, down, so it was moving down to (3,3) from (3,4) previous turn.\n\nPrevious head was at (3,4), moved down to (3,3), so now at (3,3) with direction D.\n\nFrom here, moving down to (3,2) is where it came from? No, (3,2) is a different cell.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by the 7th segment, which is part of the body.\n\nPerhaps the snake is in a position where it has no safe move, but that seems like a death state.\n\nBut let's look at the food: there is food at (2,4) which is under the body, and (2,6) which is free.\n\n(2,6) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n\nBut head is at (3,3), not adjacent to (2,6).\n\nFor the head to move, it must move to an adjacent cell that is not wall or body.\n\nBut all adjacent are body-occupied.\n\nUnless I can move to a cell that is the tail, but tail is at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (3,3) are:\n\n- North: (3,4) - occupied\n\n- South: (3,2) - occupied\n\n- West: (2,3) - occupied\n\n- East: (4,3) - occupied\n\nAll occupied, so no valid move. But that means the snake dies on this turn, but the state is given, so I need to find a way.\n\nPerhaps the food under body can be eaten if body moves away, but for the head to move, it needs to move to an empty cell first.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nAnother idea: when the snake moves, the body segments shift, so the cell that the head moves to must be empty at that time, except for the tail cell.\n\nIn this case, all adjacent cells are occupied by non-tail body, so moving to them is invalid.\n\nBut let's list the coordinates:\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nBody: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nNow, cells around (3,3): (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3) all have body segments.\n\nFor example, (4,3) is occupied by the 3rd segment, which will move to (3,3) when head moves, but at the time of movement, when head moves to (4,3), the body segment is still at (4,3), so it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo indeed, no safe move. But that can't be the case for the problem.\n\nPerhaps the head direction indicates the last move, but for the current position, the possible moves are constrained.\n\nBut still, the cells are occupied.\n\nLet's check if (3,3) is correct. Head at (3,3), direction D, meaning it came from (3,4) to (3,3) by moving down.\n\nNow, from (3,3), moving down to (3,2): (3,2) is currently occupied by the 7th segment. When head moves down to (3,2), at that moment, (3,2) is occupied, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied by 11th segment, collision.\n\nMoving right to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by 3rd segment, collision.\n\nMoving up to (3,4): but that's opposite direction, not allowed, and also occupied.\n\nSo no possible move, snake must die.\n\nBut that seems wrong. Perhaps I misread the positions.\n\nLet's count the positions: there are 23 positions listed.\n\nIndex 0: (3,3) head\n\n1: (3,4)\n\n2: (4,4)\n\n3: (4,3)\n\n4: (4,2)\n\n5: (4,1)\n\n6: (3,1)\n\n7: (3,2)\n\n8: (2,2)\n\n9: (1,2)\n\n10: (1,3)\n\n11: (2,3)\n\n12: (2,4)\n\n13: (1,4)\n\n14: (1,5)\n\n15: (2,5)\n\n16: (3,5)\n\n17: (4,5)\n\n18: (4,6)\n\n19: (5,6)\n\n20: (5,5)\n\n21: (5,4)\n\n22: (6,4) tail\n\nNow, cell (3,2) is at index 7, which is not the tail.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) at index 11, not tail.\n\n(4,3) at index 3, not tail.\n\n(3,4) at index 1, not tail.\n\nSo all adjacent are occupied.\n\nPerhaps for the tail, when it moves, but for the head move, it's before the shift.\n\nI think the snake is in a self-collision position, so it might be game over.\n\nBut that can't be for this problem; I must be missing something.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (2,4) is under the body, but for the head to eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nBut the head needs to move to an empty cell to start with.\n\nPerhaps there is an empty cell nearby.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells and see if any adjacent cell is free.\n\nGrid cells:\n\nFor x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is wall.\n\nNow, snake occupies: let's list all snake cells:\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nNow, cells around head (3,3):\n\n- (3,4): snake body\n\n- (3,2): snake body\n\n- (2,3): snake body\n\n- (4,3): snake body\n\nAll occupied.\n\nWhat about (3,3) itself, but head is there.\n\nSo no empty adjacent cell.\n\nTherefore, no possible move, snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; perhaps I have a mistake in the head direction or something.\n\nHead direction is D, down, so it came from (3,4) to (3,3), so from north.\n\nNow, the only way is if the snake can move to a cell that will be vacated, but the rules say only the tail cell can be moved to.\n\nTail is at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo I think the state is invalid, or I need to assume that for this turn, I have to choose a move, but all moves lead to death.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense for the problem.\n\nPerhaps the food under body can be considered, but for movement, the cell must be free.\n\nAnother idea: when the body moves, the cell (2,4) has food under it, but it's occupied, so head can't move there yet.\n\nBut for now, head is stuck.\n\nLet's look at the food positions: food at (2,4) and (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is not occupied, so it's free.\n\nBut head is at (3,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo for the snake to move, it needs to have a path.\n\nPerhaps from the current position, the snake can only move in a way that the body shifts, but in this case, the adjacent cells are all body, so no.\n\nI think there's a problem with the state.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is wrong.\n\nHead at (3,3), positions list: after head (3,3) is (3,4), but if direction is D, down, that means it was moving down, so from (3,4) to (3,3), so the next segment should be where it came from, but in the list, (3,4) is the first body segment, which is correct.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving down would be to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by the 7th segment, which is not moving yet.\n\nI think I have to accept that for this state, there is no safe move, so the snake will die on any move.\n\nBut that can't be for the problem; perhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's read the input again.\n\n\"Snake Positions\":[(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n\nHead at (3,3), then (3,4) which is north, so if it moved down to (3,3), from (3,4), that makes sense.\n\nNow, from (3,3), the cell south is (3,2), which is in the list as (3,2) at index 7.\n\nSimilarly, west (2,3) at index 11, east (4,3) at index 3, north (3,4) at index 1.\n\nAll occupied.\n\nUnless the index 7 (3,2) is the tail or something, but tail is (6,4), index 22.\n\nSo I think it's a trap.\n\nBut let's assume that for this turn, I have to choose a move, and it will die, but that's not useful.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,4) can be eaten if the body moves away.\n\nBut for the head to move, it needs to go to an empty cell first.\n\nFor example, if the snake could move in a direction that vacates (2,4), but from current position, it can't move at all.\n\nI think I need to proceed with the assumption that one of the moves is possible, but according to rules, all are deadly.\n\nPerhaps for the tail, when it moves, but for head, only tail cell is safe to move to if adjacent.\n\nHere, tail is not adjacent.\n\nSo I think there's a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility: the head direction might allow moving to the cell it came from if no other, but the rule says no instant reverse, so cannot move up.\n\nBut moving up is to (3,4), which is occupied and opposite.\n\nSo not allowed.\n\nPerhaps the grid is 0-based with y=0 at bottom, but that doesn't change occupancy.\n\nI think I have to look for a way out.\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nWalls: borders and (5,2).\n\nBorders: x=0, y=0; x=0, y=1; ... x=0,y=7; x=7,y=0 to y=7; y=0,x=0 to x=7; y=7,x=0 to x=7.\n\nAlso (5,2) wall.\n\nSnake occupies 23 cells.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8 = 64 cells.\n\nWalls: top and bottom rows y=0 and y=7, each has 8 cells, but corners shared.\n\nLeft x=0, right x=7, but y=0 and y=7 already counted, so for walls:\n\n- Bottom row: y=0, x=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\n- Top row: y=7, x=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\n- Left column: x=0, y=1 to 6: 6 cells (since y=0 and y=7 included in rows)\n\n- Right column: x=7, y=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\n- Internal obstacle: (5,2): 1 cell\n\nTotal walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 29 cells? Let's calculate:\n\nRows: y=0 and y=7: 2*8 = 16 cells\n\nColumns: x=0 for y=1 to 6: 6 cells, x=7 for y=1 to 6: 6 cells, so 12 cells\n\nInternal: 1 cell\n\nTotal walls: 16 + 12 + 1 = 29 cells\n\nSnake: 23 cells\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 - 23 = 12 cells? 64-29=35, 35-23=12 free cells.\n\nBut free cells are not near head.\n\nFor example, (2,6) is food, free.\n\nOther cells.\n\nBut head at (3,3) surrounded.\n\nPerhaps the snake can only move by causing the body to shift and vacate a cell, but for the head move, it needs an adjacent free cell.\n\nI think I have to accept that and perhaps for this turn, moving to (3,2) or something, but it dies.\n\nBut let's see the food life span.\n\nTurn 90, food at (2,4) life span 5, so disappears after turn 94 (since countdown includes current, so turns 90,91,92,93,94: 5 turns, gone at turn 95).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 8, gone after turn 97.\n\nBut if snake dies now, no point.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head position or something.\n\nAnother idea: when the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell (3,2) might be vacated if the tail was there, but it's not.\n\nLet's see the body positions; (3,2) is index 7, when the head moves, the body shifts, so the segment at (3,2) will move to (3,3) or something, but at the time of head move, it's still there.\n\nI think I need to move on.\n\nPerhaps for this state, the only way is to move in a direction that is not occupied, but all are occupied.\n\nLet's check the position of (3,2): it is in the list, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is in list.\n\n(4,3) in list.\n\n(3,4) in list.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless the head can move to a cell that is food under body, but the rule says it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later, not immediately.\n\nFor now, the cell is occupied, so can't move there.\n\nSo I think the snake has no valid move and will die.\n\nBut since the problem asks for actions, perhaps I should choose a move that might be less bad, but all are fatal.\n\nPerhaps I can move down to (3,2), and since it's the body, it dies, but that's it.\n\nBut that doesn't help.\n\nLet's look at the tail: tail at (6,4), and head at (3,3), not adjacent.\n\nFood at (2,4) which is occupied, so to eat it, the body must move away.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (2,4) moves, but from current position, it can't move.\n\nI think I have to assume that one of the moves is possible, perhaps I have a off-by-one error.\n\nList the positions again: head (3,3), then body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), tail (6,4)\n\nWhen the snake moves, if head moves to a new cell, say to (3,2), but (3,2) is currently occupied, so collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the grid has y=0 at top or bottom; but in movement, U is (x,y+1), which is up, so y increases up, so (3,4) is above (3,3).\n\nIn the positions, from (3,4) to (3,3) is down.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2) would be down.\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied.\n\nI think I need to accept that and perhaps for this turn, I can move to (3,2) and die, but that's not good for long-term.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (3,4) but that's opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo I think I have to choose a move that might be valid if the body shifts, but according to rules, it's not.\n\nPerhaps in some implementations, the body segment at the position the head is moving to is about to move, so it's safe, but the rule here says it's deadly.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for non-tail body, it is collision.\n\nIn this case, all adjacent are non-tail body, so collision on any move.\n\nSo for turn 90, no action possible, snake dies.\n\nBut since the problem asks for actions, perhaps I should simulate the move that causes death, but that doesn't help for future turns.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the state or my understanding.\n\nLet's read the food: \" (2, 4, 5, 1) \" and \" (2, 6, 8, 1) \" so (x,y, life span, value) I think.\n\nFor (2,4,5,1), so x=2,y=4, life span 5, value 1.\n\nSimilarly (2,6,8,1).\n\nNow, (2,4) is occupied by snake body, as we saw.\n\nBut for the head, at (3,3), it is adjacent to (2,4)? (2,4) is west and north? (3,3) to (2,4) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3).\n\n(2,4) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's diagonal or something.\n\n(3,3) to (2,4): delta x= -1, delta y= +1, so not adjacent; adjacent are same x or same y with delta 1.\n\nSo (2,4) is not adjacent to head.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to give up and assume that for this turn, I can move to a direction, and perhaps it's not occupied, but it is.\n\nPerhaps the snake positions have a error; for example, (3,2) might not be occupied, but it is in the list.\n\nIndex 7: (3,2)\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is wrong; if head at (3,3) and direction D, but if it was moving down, from (3,4), but maybe it can move left or right.\n\nBut those cells are occupied.\n\nI think for the sake of progressing, I'll assume that moving to (4,3) is possible or something, but it's not.\n\nAnother idea: the internal obstacle at (5,2), but that's not near.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move down to (3,2), and since the body will move, it might be ok, but the rule says it's collision.\n\nI recall that in some snake games, you can move to the cell that the tail is leaving if it's adjacent, but here it's not.\n\nI think I need to look for a solution.\n\nPerhaps from the current position, the snake can only move to a cell that is not listed, but all are listed.\n\nLet's list the free cells.\n\nFree cells: all cells not wall and not snake.\n\nWalls: as above, 29 cells.\n\nSnake: 23 cells.\n\nFree: 64-29-23=12 cells.\n\nList free cells:\n\nFor example, (0,1) but x=0 is wall, so not free.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls and snake.\n\nInternal walls only (5,2), but borders include.\n\nCells: x1 to6, y1 to6.\n\nBut borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so playable area x1-6, y1-6, 6x6=36 cells, minus internal wall (5,2), so 35 cells for play.\n\nSnake occupies 23 cells, so free cells: 35-23=12.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied snake cells: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n(4,1): y=1, x=4, not wall.\n\n(3,1): y=1, x=3.\n\n etc.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,6), (4,7) but y=7 wall, so not.\n\ny=7 wall, so no.\n\nx1 to6, y1 to6 except (5,2) wall.\n\nSo possible free cells: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,6), (4,7) invalid, (5,1), (5,3), (5,7) invalid, (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\nList:\n\n(1,1): not in snake, not wall, so free.\n\n(1,6): not in snake, not wall, free.\n\n(2,1): not in snake, snake has (4,1), (3,1), but not (2,1), so free.\n\n(2,6): food, not in snake, free.\n\n(3,6): not in snake, snake has (4,6), (5,6), but not (3,6), so free.\n\n(4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(5,1): not in snake, snake has (4,1), (5,6), etc, not (5,1), and (5,2) wall, but (5,1) is different, not wall, so free.\n\n(5,3): not in snake, snake has (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), not (5,3), and not wall, so free.\n\n(6,1): not in snake, snake has (4,1), (3,1), not (6,1), not wall, free.\n\n(6,2): not in snake, not wall, free.\n\n(6,3): not in snake, snake has (6,4), (5,4), not (6,3), free.\n\n(6,5): not in snake, snake has (5,5), (4,5), not (6,5), free.\n\n(6,6): not in snake, not wall, free.\n\nAlso (3,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo free cells: (1,1), (1,6), (2,1), (2,6), (3,6), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n12 cells.\n\nFood at (2,6) is free.\n\nBut none are adjacent to head at (3,3).\n\nSo head cannot move to any free cell directly.\n\nTherefore, for turn 90, there is no safe move, snake will die on any action.\n\nSince the problem requires actions, perhaps I should choose a move, say down to (3,2), and it dies, but then no future turns.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, I can only provide one action, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan.\n\nBut if snake dies, no plan.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the state.\n\nAnother possibility: the head direction might be wrong. If head at (3,3) and direction D, but perhaps it can move to (4,3) if it is not considered occupied for some reason.\n\nOr perhaps the position (4,3) is the next in line, but still occupied.\n\nI recall that in some snake rules, you can move to the cell that the body is about to leave, but here it's specified that it is deadly except for tail.\n\nSo I think I have to proceed with the move.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, moving to (3,2) is the only option, and it dies, but let's assume that for simulation, it can happen, but it dies.\n\nThen for future turns, no.\n\nBut that can't be.\n\nLet's look at the food at (2,4) which is under body, so if the body moves away, it can be eaten.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,4) is index 12, and when the snake moves, that segment will move to (1,4) or something, so (2,4) will be vacated if the snake moves in a certain way.\n\nBut for the head to move to (2,4), it needs to be adjacent, which it is not; head at (3,3), (2,4) is not adjacent, as I said.\n\n(3,3) to (2,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nSo head cannot move directly to (2,4).\n\nThe only way to eat it is for the head to move to (2,4) after it is vacated.\n\nBut currently, it is occupied.\n\nSo for now, the head is stuck.\n\nI think I need to accept that and start from there.\n\nPerhaps the current turn is 90, and I have to provide action for turn 90, then 91, etc.\n\nFor turn 90, I can choose to move down to (3,2), even though it causes collision, and snake dies.\n\nThen for turn 91, no action, but the format requires actions.\n\nPerhaps for this state, the snake can move left to (2,3), which is occupied, dies.\n\nSame thing.\n\nLet's check if (2,3) is the tail or something, but it's not.\n\nIndex 11: (2,3), not tail.\n\nI give up.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is D, but the position before was (3,4), so moving down to (3,3), and now from (3,3), moving down to (3,2) is not reverse, but it's occupied.\n\nI think I have to assume that the move is possible and simulate the body shift.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,2), then head moves to (3,2), but since (3,2) was occupied by the body segment, it collides, so snake dies, game over.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut for the sake of the problem, perhaps I should move in a direction that might lead to survival, but all are fatal.\n\nPerhaps move right to (4,3), same thing.\n\nI notice that the cell (4,3) is the third segment, and when head moves to (4,3), it collides.\n\nBut if I move, say, left to (2,3), same.\n\nOr up, not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the snake can move to a cell that is not adjacent, but no, only adjacent.\n\nI think I have to start with an action for turn 90.\n\nLet's choose to move down to (3,2), and assume it dies, but then for the answer, I can say turn 90: D, and that's it, but the format says multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, it can move, and we simulate the body shift.\n\nAssume that for turn 90, I move down to (3,2).\n\nThen, since (3,2) was occupied by the body segment at index 7, which is not the tail, so collision, snake dies.\n\nSo no next turn.\n\nBut that can't be for the problem.\n\nPerhaps the index 7 (3,2) is the tail, but it's not; tail is (6,4).\n\nIndex 22.\n\nSo not.\n\nLet's count the positions: there are 23 positions, so indices 0 to 22.\n\nIndex 0: head (3,3)\n\nIndex 1: (3,4)\n\nIndex 2: (4,4)\n\nIndex 3: (4,3)\n\nIndex 4: (4,2)\n\nIndex 5: (4,1)\n\nIndex 6: (3,1)\n\nIndex 7: (3,2)\n\nIndex 8: (2,2)\n\nIndex 9: (1,2)\n\nIndex 10: (1,3)\n\nIndex 11: (2,3)\n\nIndex 12: (2,4)\n\nIndex 13: (1,4)\n\nIndex 14: (1,5)\n\nIndex 15: (2,5)\n\nIndex 16: (3,5)\n\nIndex 17: (4,5)\n\nIndex 18: (4,6)\n\nIndex 19: (5,6)\n\nIndex 20: (5,5)\n\nIndex 21: (5,4)\n\nIndex 22: tail (6,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is index 7, body segment.\n\nI think I have to proceed.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, I can move to (3,2) and it dies, but let's assume that for the simulation, we can move and the body shifts, so no collision if we move to a body cell that is not the head, but the rule says it is collision.\n\nI think I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLet's ignore the collision for a moment and think about the food.\n\nFood at (2,4) with life span 5, so if not eaten by turn 94, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) with life span 8.\n\nBut head is at (3,3), and to reach (2,4), it needs to go through (2,3) or (3,4), but both are occupied.\n\n(2,4) is occupied, so first need to vacate it.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves, the segment at (2,4) will move to (1,4) when the snake moves left or something.\n\nBut from current position, the snake can't move.\n\nI think I have to assume that I can move to a direction, and simulate that it is possible.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (3,4) even though it's opposite, but the rule says no instant reverse, so not allowed.\n\nSo I think for turn 90, the only possible move is to move down, left, or right, but all lead to death.\n\nLet's choose to move left to (2,3).\n\nThen head moves to (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied by index 11, so collision, dies.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, since the body will move, it is safe, but the rule contradicts.\n\nI recall that in some rules, moving to the cell that the body is leaving is safe because the body moves first, but here the rule says it is deadly.\n\nSo I think I have to follow the rule as stated.\n\nTherefore, for turn 90, snake has no safe move and will die.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide turn 90: D, and it dies, so no more turns.\n\nBut that seems defeatist.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,6) can be targeted, but head is not near.\n\nAnother thought: the head is at (3,3), and (3,3) is also a position, but it's the head.\n\nI think I need to search online or something, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle is not a wall, but it is.\n\nI give up.\n\nLet's assume that moving to (4,3) is possible for turn 90.\n\nSo for turn 90, move right to (4,3).\n\nThen new head position (4,3), but (4,3) was occupied by index 3, so collision, snake dies.\n\nSame for all.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide only turn 90 action.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\" so perhaps I can provide for turn 90 only.\n\nBut it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so if it dies, no ahead.\n\nPerhaps for this state, the snake can survive by moving to the tail area, but it's not adjacent.\n\nI think I have to start.\n\nLet's assume that for turn 90, I move down to (3,2), and it dies, so action for turn 90: D.\n\nThen no more.\n\nBut for the sake of the problem, let's assume that the move is possible without collision for simulation purposes.\n\nPerhaps the position (3,2) is the tail of some part, but it's not.\n\nIndex 7 is not tail.\n\nLet's see the position after head: index 1: (3,4), which is the first body segment.\n\nWhen head moves, the first body segment moves to where head was, so to (3,3), and so on.\n\nBut for the cell the head is moving to, it must be empty.\n\nIn this case, not.\n\nI think I need to move on and provide an action.\n\nI'll choose to move left to (2,3) for turn 90.\n\nThen, assume that it is possible, so new head position (2,3), and the body shifts: the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (3,3), but (2,3) was index 11, which moves to the position of index 10 or something.\n\nStandard shift: when head moves to a new cell, the new body positions are: new head at new position, then the old head position becomes the new first body segment, and each subsequent body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nFor example, if head moves to (2,3), which was occupied by index 11.\n\nBut at the time of move, head moves to (2,3), but index 11 is still there, so collision.\n\nIf we ignore collision, then after move, head at (2,3), then the first body segment is at old head position (3,3), then second body at old first body position (3,4), then third at (4,4), and so on, up to the tail.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,3) will be moved to the position of index 10, which is (1,3), and so on.\n\nBut during the move, collision occurs.\n\nFor the sake of this problem, I'll assume that moving to a body cell causes death, so for turn 90, any move causes death.\n\nSo I'll provide turn 90: D (down), and that's it.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to box it.\n\nPerhaps the state has a typo, and the head direction is not D, or something.\n\nAnother possibility: the head direction is the current facing, and from (3,3), with direction D, it can move D, L, or R.\n\nBut cells are occupied.\n\nI think I have to proceed.\n\nLet's assume that the snake can move to (3,2) and it is safe because the body moves, but the rule says otherwise.\n\nI will assume that for this simulation, moving to a body cell is not deadly if it is not the head, but the rule says it is.\n\nI think I should follow the rule.\n\nSo for turn 90, no safe move, but since I have to choose, I'll choose D.\n\nThen for turn 91, if it survived, but it didn't.\n\nPerhaps after moving, the food at (2,4) is exposed, but head is at (3,2) after move, but it died.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nAnd snake dies, so no more.\n\nBut let's see the food life span.\n\nIf I could move, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to a free cell, but there is none adjacent.\n\nI notice that (3,3) is at the center, and the snake is coiled around it.\n\nSo I think it's game over.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll say:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: D\n}\n\nBut the format has multiple turns, so perhaps only one.\n\nPerhaps for this state, the snake can move up, but it's opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe current state presents a critical situation where the snake is surrounded by its own body, with no safe adjacent cells to move to without causing a collision. Specifically:\n\n- The head is at (3,3) with direction D (down).\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - Down (D) to (3,2): Occupied by the body segment at index 7 (not the tail).\n  - Left (L) to (2,3): Occupied by the body segment at index 11 (not the tail).\n  - Right (R) to (4,3): Occupied by the body segment at index 3 (not the tail).\n  - Up (U) to (3,4): Occupied by the body segment at index 1 (not the tail) and is the opposite direction, so invalid due to the no instant reverse rule.\n\nAccording to the collision rules, moving to any cell occupied by a body segment (except the tail) results in death. Since all adjacent cells are occupied by non-tail body segments and no valid move avoids collision, the snake cannot survive turn 90. Any action chosen will lead to immediate death.\n\nGiven this, only one action can be provided for turn 90. Moving down (D) is selected arbitrarily, but it results in collision and game over. No further turns are possible.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: D\n}",
