Then U to (4,3).\n3. Then R to (5,3) to eat the second food.\n4. Then can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3) to avoid collision.\n\nThis sequence allows eating both foods by turn 5.\n\n### Avoiding (1,1)\n\nThe food at (1,1) is a trap because after eating it, the only adjacent cell is (2,1), which would be occupied by the body, leading to immediate collision. Hence, it's best to ignore (1,1).\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above, the optimal sequence is:\n\n1. **Turn 1**: Move D to (3,1).\n   - Prepares to eat (4,1) next.\n2. **Turn 2**: Move R to (4,1) and eat.\n   - Score +1, length increases to 3.\n3. **Turn 3**: Move U to (4,2).\n   - Avoids collision, moves towards (5,3).\n4. **Turn 4**: Move U to (4,3).\n   - Further towards (5,3).\n5. **Turn 5**: Move R to (5,3) and eat.\n   - Score +1, length increases to 4.\n6. **Turn 6**: Move U to (5,4).\n   - Safe move to avoid collision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence maximizes score by safely eating both accessible positive foods while avoiding the dangerous (1,1). It ensures the snake has escape routes after each meal to prevent collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: R \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: R \\\\\nTurn 6: U\n}",

The borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, and y=7 are walls that the snake cannot pass through.\n  \n- **Internal Obstacles**: There are internal walls at the following coordinates:\n  - (6, 4), (5, 1), (2, 4), (6, 1), (1, 2), (5, 6), (5, 2), (3, 5)\n  \n- **Snake Position**: The snake consists of three segments:\n  - Head: (4, 2)\n  - Body: (4, 1)\n  - Tail: (3, 1)\n  \n- **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently facing \"Up\" (U), meaning it moved from (4,1) to (4,2) in the previous move.\n  \n- **Food Items**:\n  1. (1, 1): Value = +1, Life Span = 6 (available until turn 9)\n  2. (5, 3): Value = +1, Life Span = 6 (available until turn 9)\n  3. (2, 5): Value = +1, Life Span = 10 (available until turn 13)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 4\n\nGiven that the snake's current direction is Up (U), the possible immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (4, 3)\n   - Check if (4,3) is free:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Not in the list of internal obstacles.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (current positions: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)).\n   - Conclusion: Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: Move to (4, 1)\n   - This would be the opposite direction (reverse), which is not allowed.\n   - Conclusion: Invalid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: Move to (3, 2)\n   - Check if (3,2) is free:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Not in the list of internal obstacles.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Conclusion: Valid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: Move to (5, 2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is free:\n     - (5,2) is listed as an internal obstacle.\n   - Conclusion: Invalid move.\n\nTherefore, at Turn 4, the possible valid moves are **Up (U)** and **Left (L)**.\n\n### Evaluating Move Up (U) to (4, 3)\n\nLet's explore moving Up to (4,3):\n\n- **Turn 4**: Move U to (4,3)\n  - New head: (4,3)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: old head position (4,2)\n    - Tail: old body position (4,1)\n  - New snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n  - Direction: Up (since we moved Up)\n\n- **Turn 5**: From (4,3), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (4,4)\n    - (4,4) is free.\n  - Left (L) to (3,3)\n    - (3,3) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (5,3)\n    - (5,3) is free and has food.\n  - Down (D) to (4,2) is reverse (invalid).\n\n  **Choosing to eat food at (5,3)**:\n  - Move R to (5,3) to eat the food.\n  - New head: (5,3)\n  - Snake grows by 1 (length now 4):\n    - Body1: old head (4,3)\n    - Body2: old body1 (4,2)\n    - Tail: old body2 (4,1) + new segment (since we ate food)\n    - New snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n  - Direction: Right.\n\n- **Turn 6**: From (5,3), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (5,4)\n    - (5,4) is free.\n  - Down (D) to (5,2) is an obstacle (invalid).\n  - Left (L) to (4,3) is body (collision, invalid).\n  - Right (R) to (6,3)\n    - (6,3) is free (not an obstacle).\n\n  **Choosing Up to (5,4)**:\n  - Move U to (5,4)\n  - New head: (5,4)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: (5,3)\n    - Body2: (4,3)\n    - Tail: (4,2)\n  - New snake: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n  - Direction: Up.\n\n- **Turn 7**: From (5,4), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (5,5)\n    - (5,5) is free.\n  - Down (D) to (5,3) is body (invalid).\n  - Left (L) to (4,4)\n    - (4,4) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (6,4) is an obstacle (invalid).\n\n  **Choosing Left to (4,4)**:\n  - Move L to (4,4)\n  - New head: (4,4)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: (5,4)\n    - Body2: (5,3)\n    - Tail: (4,3)\n  - New snake: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n  - Direction: Left.\n\n- **Turn 8**: From (4,4), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (4,5)\n    - (4,5) is free.\n  - Down (D) to (4,3) is body (invalid).\n  - Left (L) to (3,4)\n    - (3,4) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (5,4) is body (invalid).\n\n  **Choosing Up to (4,5)**:\n  - Move U to (4,5)\n  - New head: (4,5)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: (4,4)\n    - Body2: (5,4)\n    - Tail: (5,3)\n  - New snake: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n  - Direction: Up.\n\nThis sequence allows the snake to eat the food at (5,3) on Turn 5 and then navigate safely upwards and leftwards, avoiding collisions and setting a path towards the other food at (2,5) in future turns.\n\n### Evaluating Move Left (L) to (3, 2)\n\nNow, let's explore moving Left to (3,2):\n\n- **Turn 4**: Move L to (3,2)\n  - New head: (3,2)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: old head (4,2)\n    - Tail: old body (4,1)\n  - New snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1)]\n  - Direction: Left.\n\n- **Turn 5**: From (3,2), possible moves:\n  - Up (U) to (3,3)\n    - (3,3) is free.\n  - Down (D) to (3,1)\n    - (3,1) is free (old tail position, now vacated).\n  - Left (L) to (2,2)\n    - (2,2) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (4,2) is body (invalid).\n\n  **Choosing Down to (3,1)** to head towards (1,1):\n  - Move D to (3,1)\n  - New head: (3,1)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: (3,2)\n    - Tail: (4,2)\n  - New snake: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2)]\n  - Direction: Down.\n\n- **Turn 6**: From (3,1), possible moves:\n  - Left (L) to (2,1)\n    - (2,1) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (4,1)\n    - (4,1) is free.\n  - Up (U) to (3,2) is body (invalid).\n  - Down (D) to (3,0) is border wall (invalid).\n\n  **Choosing Left to (2,1)** to approach (1,1):\n  - Move L to (2,1)\n  - New head: (2,1)\n  - Body segments shift:\n    - Body1: (3,1)\n    - Tail: (3,2)\n  - New snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n \n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

The possible moves are:\n- **U (Up)**: (5,5) - Valid (not a wall or body segment).\n- **L (Left)**: (4,4) - Valid (not a wall or body segment).\n- **R (Right)**: (6,4) - Invalid (wall at (6,4)).\n- **D (Down)**: (5,3) - Invalid (body segment and opposite direction).\n\n**Why L (Left) is chosen**:\n1. **Path to (3,6)**: Moving left to (4,4) is the first step toward reaching (3,6), a positive food with a long life span (available until turn 16). The sequence is:\n   - Turn 7: L to (4,4).\n   - Turn 8: U to (4,5).\n   - Turn 9: U to (4,6).\n   - Turn 10: L to (3,6) (eat food).\n2. **Avoiding (1,1)**: (1,1) is unreachable by turn 9 (its last available turn), so it is ignored.\n3. **Safety**: Moving left avoids the risk of dead ends (e.g., moving right could trap the snake later). \n\nThis choice aligns with the long-term plan to maximize score by safely eating (3,6) and later (2,5). \n\n### Next Steps (Implicit Plan)\n- **Turn 8**: Move U to (4,5).\n- **Turn 9**: Move U to (4,6).\n- **Turn 10**: Move L to (3,6) (eat food).\n- Continue toward (2,5) for another +1 score. \n\nThis ensures the snake survives and scores optimally.",

Internal obstacles at: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), (5,6), (5,2), (3,5)]\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (5,4), direction D (down)\n  - Body segments: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] (total length 13)\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,3): value +1, life span 7\n  - (6,5): value +1, life span 10\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 43\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4), moving downward (D). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n   - Check if (5,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall (x=5, y=3 is within bounds).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (not in the list).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (not in snake positions).\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (4,4)\n   - (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body (4th segment).\n   - Not the tail (tail is at (3,6)), so moving here would cause a collision.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n   - (6,4) is an internal obstacle.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n   - (5,5) is the second segment of the snake's body.\n   - Moving up is the reverse of the current direction (D), which is not allowed.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid move at Turn 43 is **Down (D)** to (5,3).\n\n### Verifying the Next Moves\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), let's see the possible moves at Turn 44:\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,3), direction D.\n- **New Body**: Head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). Tail at (3,6) is removed since no food was eaten.\n- **Possible Moves from (5,3)**:\n  1. **Down (D)**: (5,2)\n     - (5,2) is an internal obstacle. Invalid.\n  2. **Left (L)**: (4,3)\n     - (4,3) is not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by the snake. Valid.\n  3. **Right (R)**: (6,3)\n     - (6,3) is not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by the snake. Valid.\n  4. **Up (U)**: (5,4)\n     - (5,4) is the first body segment. Also, U is reverse of D. Invalid.\n\n**Possible Moves at Turn 44**: Left (L) to (4,3) or Right (R) to (6,3).\n\n#### Option 1: Left to (4,3)\n\n- **Turn 44**: Move L to (4,3).\n- **Turn 45**: From (4,3), direction L.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down (D): (4,2) - Valid.\n    - Left (L): (3,3) - Occupied by body. Invalid.\n    - Right (R): (5,3) - Occupied by body and reverse. Invalid.\n    - Up (U): (4,4) - Occupied by body. Invalid.\n  - Only move: Down (D) to (4,2).\n\n- **Turn 45**: Move D to (4,2).\n- **Turn 46**: From (4,2), direction D.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down (D): (4,1) - Valid.\n    - Left (L): (3,2) - Valid.\n    - Right (R): (5,2) - Obstacle. Invalid.\n    - Up (U): (4,3) - Body and reverse. Invalid.\n  - Moves: Down to (4,1) or Left to (3,2).\n\nThis path seems restrictive and doesn't lead to food quickly.\n\n#### Option 2: Right to (6,3)\n\n- **Turn 44**: Move R to (6,3).\n- **Turn 45**: From (6,3), direction R.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down (D): (6,2) - Valid.\n    - Left (L): (5,3) - Body and reverse. Invalid.\n    - Right (R): (7,3) - Wall. Invalid.\n    - Up (U): (6,4) - Obstacle. Invalid.\n  - Only move: Down (D) to (6,2).\n\n- **Turn 45**: Move D to (6,2).\n- **Turn 46**: From (6,2), direction D.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Down (D): (6,1) - Obstacle. Invalid.\n    - Left (L): (5,2) - Obstacle. Invalid.\n    - Right (R): (7,2) - Wall. Invalid.\n    - Up (U): (6,3) - Body and reverse. Invalid.\n  - No valid moves. Snake would die.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving Right at Turn 44 leads to a dead end. Therefore, the only viable path is to move Left at Turn 44.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the constraints and the analysis:\n\n1. **Turn 43**: Only possible move is **Down (D)** to (5,3).\n2. **Turn 44**: From (5,3), move **Left (L)** to (4,3) to avoid immediate death.\n3. Subsequent moves would need to navigate carefully to avoid getting trapped, but the immediate action at Turn 43 is clear.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3,4)\n2. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3,2)\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (4,3)\n4. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2,3) — But this is opposite to current direction R, so illegal.\n\nNow, check each possible move:\n\n1. **Up to (3,4)**:\n   - Is (3,4) a wall? No, walls at (3,5) but not (3,4).\n   - Is (3,4) occupied by the snake? Snake positions don't include (3,4), so free.\n   - Is there food at (3,4)? No, food is at other positions.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n2. **Down to (3,2)**:\n   - Is (3,2) a wall? No.\n   - Is (3,2) occupied by the snake? Yes, it's part of the body (from the list: (3,2) is the 6th segment).\n   - **Invalid move** (collision with body).\n\n3. **Right to (4,3)**:\n   - Is (4,3) a wall? No.\n   - Is (4,3) occupied by the snake? Yes, it's the 8th segment.\n   - **Invalid move** (collision with body).\n\nThus, the only valid move at Turn 52 is **Up (U) to (3,4)**.\n\n### Verifying the Move\n\nAfter moving to (3,4):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (3,4)\n- **New Direction**: U (since we moved up)\n- **Tail Moves**: Since no food is eaten, the tail (originally at (4,4)) moves away. The new tail is the segment before the last, which is (4,5).\n\n**New Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (3,4)\n- Body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\n**Food Update**:\n- (4,4) was under the tail. Now that the tail has moved, the food at (4,4) is exposed but not eaten yet.\n\n### Next Move at Turn 53\n\nNow, head is at (3,4), direction U. Possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3,5) — Wall (internal obstacle at (3,5)), invalid.\n2. **Left (L)**: (2,4) — Wall (internal obstacle at (2,4)), invalid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,4) — Check:\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Occupied by food, not snake (since tail moved away).\n   - **Valid move**, and we can eat the food at (4,4).\n\n**Eating (4,4)**:\n- Value: +1\n- Length increases by 1.\n- Tail does not move; a new segment is added at the head.\n\n**New Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n- Length: 14 (original 13 + 1)\n\n**Direction After Move**: R (since we moved right from (3,4) to (4,4))\n\n### Subsequent Moves\n\nAt Turn 54, head at (4,4), direction R. Possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,5) — Occupied by tail (from positions: (4,5) is the last segment).\n   - Can move to tail cell if no food is eaten (tail moves away).\n   - No food at (4,5), so valid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,3) — Occupied by body (segment 9), invalid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,4) — Occupied by body (segment 11), invalid.\n4. **Left (L)**: Opposite to R, illegal.\n\nOnly valid move: **Up (U) to (4,5)**.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5):\n- No food eaten.\n- Tail moves away from (4,5), new tail is (5,5).\n\n**New Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (4,5)\n- Body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), ..., (5,5)\n- Tail: (5,5)\n\n**Direction After Move**: U (since we moved up).\n\n### Continuing the Sequence\n\nAt Turn 55, head at (4,5), direction U. Possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,6) — Check:\n   - Not a wall (y=6 is not a border, no internal wall at (4,6)).\n   - Not occupied by snake.\n   - No food.\n   - **Valid move**.\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,5) — Wall, invalid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,5) — Occupied by tail.\n   - Can move to tail cell if no food is eaten.\n   - No food at (5,5), so valid.\n4. **Down (D)**: Opposite to U, illegal.\n\nChoices: U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n\n**Choosing R to (5,5)**:\n- Moves towards the right side where food (6,2) is, but its life span is short (gone by turn 56).\n- After moving to (5,5), direction R.\n- Next moves would likely lead to a dead end as the snake is long and space is limited.\n\n**Choosing U to (4,6)**:\n- Then at (4,6), direction U, only possible move is L to (3,6) (since U to (4,7) is wall, R to (5,6) is wall).\n- Continuing this path may lead to the left side, but the snake is long, and space is constrained by walls and its own body.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints and the snake's current position and length, the only immediate valid move at Turn 52 is **Up (U)**. Subsequent moves are forced due to the snake's length and wall placements, leading to limited options for survival. \n\nTherefore, the action for Turn 52 is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",
