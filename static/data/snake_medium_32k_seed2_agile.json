Let me confirm the walls.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means x from 0 to 7 inclusive, but since walls occupy those cells, the snake can only be on cells where x is from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, I believe. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, y: 1 to 6. Also, internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,3)] – that's just the head? The list has one position, so the snake is of length 1, only the head at (3,3).\n> \n> Head direction: L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.

When it eats, the length increases, so after eating, the body grows.\n> \n> But right now, no body, just head.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

Directions: L is left, R is right, so yes, opposite. Since current head direction is L, I cannot move R on this turn. The rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> \"on next turn\" – let me read carefully.\n> \n> \" Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. I think it means that in the next move, you cannot choose the direction opposite to the current moving direction.\n> \n> Current moving direction is L, so for turn t=0, I cannot choose R.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move, the direction will change accordingly.\n> \n> For turn t=0, action: I can choose U, D, or L, but not R.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: to (3,4)\n> \n> - D: to (3,2)\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> - R: to (4,3) but forbidden because opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4): x=3 between 1-6, y=4 between 1-6, should be ok, but internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> (3,4) is an internal obstacle? (3,4) is listed: \"Internal Obstacles: [(1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4)]\"\n> \n> Yes, (3,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is obstacle, but I'm not moving there directly.\n> \n> From (3,3):\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) – but (3,4) is an obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (3,2) – is (3,2) wall or obstacle? y=2, not border, and not in internal obstacles list: obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (3,2) not there, so should be free.\n> \n> - L: to (2,3) – (2,3): not border, internal obstacles: (1,3) is there, but (2,3) not listed. Obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (2,3) not mentioned, so should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (4,3) – forbidden because opposite direction, but also (4,3) not wall or obstacle, but cannot move due to direction rule.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (3,2) or L to (2,3). U is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> Now, food positions: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6)\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, which is on the right border but x=6 is valid? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, since walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning cells x=1 to x=6 are free, except if obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 to 6 free.\n> \n> So (6,3) is within bounds, no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> (5,5) and (6,6) similarly.\n> \n> Life span 10 for all, so they disappear after 10 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn t=0, life span 10, so at turn 10 it disappears? Let's see: \"life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it disappears at turn t + L? Or after L turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> At turn when spawned, countdown = N, then each turn it decreases by 1, when countdown=0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, life span N, after each turn (including the turn it was placed), countdown decreases. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> To be precise: suppose food is placed at turn T with life span N.\n> \n> At turn T, countdown = N.\n> \n> After turn T, countdown = N-1? \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> It says including current, so at turn T, when the food is present, countdown starts at N, and during turn T, it decreases? But the decrease might happen at the end of the turn.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, we can think: at the beginning of turn, if countdown >0, food is there, and after the turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown=0 after decrease, food disappears.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so for turn t, the countdown decreases during this turn.\n> \n> But for decision making, at turn t, we know the current life span, which is the remaining turns including current.\n> \n> For example, here at turn 0, life span 10, so it will disappear after 10 more turns, meaning at turn 10 it is still there? Or gone?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – so after N turns from now, it is gone.\n> \n> With countdown decreasing each turn including current.\n> \n> Assume: at turn t, for a food with life span L, it will be present for turns t to t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, L=10 at t=0, present from turn 0 to 9, gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, countdown at turn k: L - (k - t) for k from t to t+L-1.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown = L, at turn t+1, countdown = L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, countdown=1, then at turn t+L, countdown=0, gone.\n> \n> The rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we see it, countdown is L, and after this turn, it becomes L-1, etc.\n> \n> For path planning, at turn 0, food has life span 10, so it will be there for 10 turns, so we have until turn 9 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly for all food here.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (3,3), possible actions: D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> I need to think multiple steps ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells outside 1-6 in x or y are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4)\n> \n> And borders are walls, so no access to x=0,7 or y=0,7.\n> \n> Now, free cells: all from (1,1) to (6,6) except the obstacles.\n> \n> For example, row y=1: all x=1 to6 free?

But after moving to (2,3), the cell (3,3) is empty, so moving to (3,3) should be fine, but direction: current direction after move is L, moving R to (3,3) is opposite? From (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is right, which is opposite to current direction L?

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells with x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7 are walls. That means the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? No, let's see the snake position: (3,2). (3,2) should be within bounds. x=3 is between 1 and 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free, similarly y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But there are internal obstacles: [(1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)]. So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,2)] – that's just the head, since it's a single position. So the snake is only one cell long right now. That means there's no body to worry about, except for the tail, but since it's only one segment, the head is also the tail.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, which is down, so moving (x,y-1).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 9, value 1\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 9, value 1\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, and different life spans, but all long, so not disappearing soon.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one cell long, there are no body collision risks except for walls and obstacles. Also, the \"tail reward danger\" might not apply yet because if the head is adjacent to the tail, but here tail is the head itself, so it's not adjacent; it's the same cell. But when we eat food, the snake grows, so after eating, it will have a body.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2), direction down. So from (3,2), moving down would go to (3,1). But y=0 is a wall, so (3,1) is within bounds? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom row? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically, in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left.

Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid has rows from y=0 to y=7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so snake can be on y=1 to y=6? Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so cells with y=0 cannot be moved to. Similarly y=7 cannot.

So from (3,1), can go L to (2,1), R to (4,1), or U to (3,2) but (3,2) is where I came from, but since no body, it might be ok, but after moving to (3,1), the snake position is [(3,1)], so head at (3,1), and no body, so moving back to (3,2) would be like entering an empty cell, but (3,2) is free now, since I moved away. But in terms of direction, if I go U from (3,1), to (3,2), that would be opposite to current direction? Current direction after moving to (3,1) is still D? Let's think.\n> \n> After moving, the head direction changes based on the move.\n> \n> At turn 1, head direction is D, meaning it arrived at (3,2) by moving down.\n> \n> Then I choose an action for turn 1.\n> \n> Suppose I move D to (3,1).

So only L or R, or U, but U is opposite to D? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I cannot move U immediately, because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> So from (3,1), with direction D, possible moves: L to (2,1), R to (4,1).

Then from (2,2), direction L (since I moved left), so next moves: can go L to (1,2), U to (2,3), D to (2,1). Cannot go R (opposite to L).\n> \n> (1,2) is free? x=1,y=2, not obstacle, so free. (2,3) free? (2,3) not listed obstacle, but (1,3) is obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, so (2,3) should be free. (2,1) free.\n> \n> But (2,3): from (2,2) to (2,3) is U.\n> \n> Then from (2,3), I can go to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, blocked, so cannot. Or to (1,3) but (1,3) blocked. Or to (3,3). So from (2,3), only down to (2,2) or right to (3,3), or left to (1,3) but blocked, up to (2,4) blocked. So only to (3,3) or back to (2,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): from (1,2), can go to (1,1), (1,3) but blocked, or (2,2).\n> \n> So left side has some limitations.\n> \n> If I go R from (3,2) to (4,2): (4,2) free. Then from (4,2), direction R (since moved right), so next moves: can go R to (5,2), U to (4,3), D to (4,1).

It's turn 2, and the snake is at position (4, 2) with direction right (R). The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), and (2,4). The food items are:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1, and life span decreases each turn, including this one.\n> \n> The snake has only one segment, which is the head, at (4,2). So, it's a snake of length 1. That means if it eats food, it will grow to length 2.\n> \n> Since it's length 1, there is no body to collide with except itself, but since it's just the head, moving into the same cell isn't possible because it would have to stay still, but movement is required each turn. So, for now, the only collisions to worry about are walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, the tail is the same as the head since only one segment. But when it eats food, it will grow, so after eating, there will be a tail.\n> \n> Now, head direction is R, so from (4,2), moving right would go to (5,2).\n> \n> Available moves: U (up, to (4,3)), D (down, to (4,1)), L (left, to (3,2)), R (right, to (5,2)).\n> \n> But need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are borders, so (4,1): y=1, not 0, so it's within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are safe? Let's see the grid size.\n> \n> The borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? But internal obstacles are given, so coordinates might be from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so snake can only be in (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. Internal cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> Snake is at (4,2), which should be safe.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - U: (4,3) - is this safe? y=3, between 1 and 6, x=4, not in obstacle list. Obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (4,3) is not there, and not border, so should be safe.\n> \n> - D: (4,1) - y=1, not 0, so not border. x=4, not obstacle. Safe.\n> \n> - L: (3,2) - x=3, y=2. Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles have (3,4) but y=4, not 2. So (3,2) should be safe.\n> \n> - R: (5,2) - x=5, y=2. Not border, not obstacle. Safe.\n> \n> So all four directions are possible at this point, since no body to hit.\n> \n> But head direction is R, so if I move L, that would be opposite, but is that allowed? The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so next move cannot be L (left), because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Similarly, if current is R, cannot move L immediately.\n> \n> So from R, possible moves: U, D, R (since L is opposite).\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n> \n> So for turn 2, since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> So actions for turn 2: U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> Food locations: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6), (6,4) all with value 1 and life spans 8,8,8,9 respectively.\n> \n> Since life span decreases each turn, including current, at turn 2, life spans are 8,8,8,9. So after turn 2, they become 7,7,7,8? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1 or something? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, it has L, then after turn t, it has L-1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at turn 2 with life_span 8, it will be present for turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9? Let's calculate: at turn 2, life_span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 2 + 8 - 1 = 9? Since after N turns, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – N is life_span, so if life_span is L at turn t, it disappears after L turns, meaning it is gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> But countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life_span = L, then at turn t+1, it is L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, it is 1, then at turn t+L, it disappears (life_span 0).\n> \n> So for example, food at (6,3) with life_span 8 at turn 2: it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9 (since at turn 10 it disappears, but turn 9 is when life_span=1, still present).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) and (6,6) same, life_span 8 at turn 2, disappear after turn 9.\n> \n> (6,4) life_span 9 at turn 2, disappear after turn 10.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (4,2), and I need to get to food.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

But since playable is only inner, we care about positions.\n> \n> For movement, we check if target cell is wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacle cells: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> Also, snake is at (4,2), but it will move, so not occupied after move.\n> \n> Now, food at: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is food, not obstacle.\n> \n> Now, from snake head (4,2), I can move:\n> \n> - U to (4,3)\n> \n> - D to (4,1)\n> \n> - R to (5,2)  (since L not allowed due to direction)\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Since snake is length 1, eating any food will make it grow to length 2, and then the tail will be where the head was when it ate.\n> \n> But for now, no tail.\n> \n> Also, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills snake.

No, from (4,2) to (5,2) on turn 2, then on turn 3, from (5,2) to (6,2), but (6,2) has no food, food is at (6,3). So on turn 4, I can go to (6,3) from (6,2) by moving up.\n> \n> But let's see the state.\n> \n> Turn 2: move to (5,2), snake position becomes [(5,2)] since length 1, head at (5,2), direction R.\n> \n> Then turn 3: from (5,2), can move U to (5,3), D to (5,1), R to (6,2), not L.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,2), then snake at (6,2).\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (6,2), can move U to (6,3), which has food.

When it eats, the head moves to food, and body grows, so since it was length 1, after eating, head at (6,3), tail at (5,2)? Let's see.\n> \n> Before eating, snake is at (6,2), length 1. It moves to (6,3), which has food, so it eats, head now at (6,3), and since it grows, the tail is added, but where? Typically, when snake moves, head goes to new position, and tail follows, but for growth, when it eats, after moving, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves, tail moves to where head was or something.\n> \n> In this case, when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from end.\n> \n> When it moves to food, head moves to new cell, tail stays, so new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Usually: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail, unless it eats, then it adds new head without removing tail, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, since positions are given as list, head first.\n> \n> At turn 3, snake at [(6,2)], length 1.\n> \n> It moves to (6,3), which has food, so after move, positions are [(6,3), (6,2)] — head at (6,3), tail at (6,2).

But internal obstacles are additional walls: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4).\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> But (x,0) and (x,7) include corners, so it's all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Additionally, internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> So playable cells are those not listed as walls or obstacles.\n> \n> For example, (1,1), (1,2), etc., but (1,3) is an obstacle, so not playable.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) obstacle, (1,6) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, (3,4) obstacle.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (5,2), head direction right.\n> \n> Food at: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is listed, but let's see coordinates: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n> \n> All have value 1 and life span 7 or 8.\n> \n> Current turn t=3.\n> \n> Since snake is only one segment, no body to worry about collisions except walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, since no body, eating food will make it grow to length 2.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 3 and plan a sequence for at least 5 turns: turns 3,4,5,6,7, and maybe beyond.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so from (5,2), moving right would go to (6,2).\n> \n> What is at (6,2)? No food listed, and not a wall. Walls: x=7 is wall, so (6,2) is within bounds, x=6 is ok since x=7 is wall, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 are playable except obstacles.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (6,2): not a wall, not an obstacle. Obstacles are (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4) — all have x=1,2,3 or y=3,4,6, so (6,2) is clear.\n> \n> No food at (6,2), so moving right to (6,2) doesn't eat anything.\n> \n> I could move in other directions, but head direction is R, and I cannot instantly reverse, so I cannot move left (opposite of right) on the next turn. So for turn 3, since current direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,1) — but y=1, is that playable? y=0 is wall, y=1 should be playable unless obstacle. No obstacle at (5,1), so yes.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): but cannot, because opposite direction.\n> \n> So options: U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3): at (6,3), life 7\n> \n> - (5,5): at (5,5), life 7\n> \n> - (6,6): at (6,6), life 7\n> \n> - (6,4): at (6,4), life 8\n> \n> Also, (6,4) has life 8, others 7.\n> \n> Since life span decreases each turn, including current, at turn 3, (6,3) has 7 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 3 + 7 = turn 10? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear on turn t+L.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the turn it spawns, countdown is L, after that turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> In the input, it says \"life_span\" which is the remaining life span at current turn.\n> \n> For food at (6,3), life span 7 at turn 3, meaning after 7 more turns it disappears, so it will be gone on turn 3 + 7 = turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) gone on turn 10, (6,6) gone on turn 10, (6,4) life span 8, gone on turn 3+8=11.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (5,2), and I want to eat food.\n> \n> Closest food: (6,3) is at (6,3), which is adjacent right and up? From (5,2), (6,3) is one right and one up, so Manhattan distance 2.\n> \n> (5,5) is at (5,5), from (5,2) same x, y+3, so distance 3.\n> \n> (6,6) at (6,6), distance |6-5| + |6-2| =1+4=5.\n> \n> (6,4) at (6,4), |6-5| + |4-2| =1+2=3.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, since snake has no body, no collision risk except with walls or obstacles.\n> \n> After eating, it will grow, so body segments will appear.\n> \n> First, I need to decide where to go.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 3:\n> \n> - Move R to (6,2): no food, safe.\n> \n> - Move U to (5,3): no food there? Food is at (6,3), not (5,3). (5,3) is empty? Probably, since not listed.\n> \n> - Move D to (5,1): no food.\n> \n> None of the immediate moves have food; food is at (6,3), which is not adjacent directly; from (5,2), to reach (6,3) I need to go right then up, or up then right, etc.\n> \n> From (5,2), moving U to (5,3) gets me closer to (6,3), since (5,3) to (6,3) is adjacent right.\n> \n> Similarly, moving R to (6,2), then from there I can go up to (6,3).\n> \n> But (6,3) has food, so if I go to (6,3) when food is there, I eat it.\n> \n> But on turn 3, I can't reach it directly.\n> \n> So for turn 3, I need to move to an adjacent empty cell.\n> \n> Then on subsequent turns, I can eat.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks later.\n> \n> Since all food is positive, I should aim to eat them, but with life span, I need to prioritize those with less life if they are about to disappear, but here all have similar life, (6,4) has more.\n> \n> (6,3) disappears on turn 10, others similar.\n> \n> Turn 3 now, so I have time.\n> \n> But I need to maximize score, so eat as many as possible.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the snake grows, so I need to avoid self-collision.\n> \n> Currently no body, so no issue.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> So let's list all obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,3) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,6) obstacle\n> \n> - (2,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (3,4) obstacle\n> \n> Also, borders: (0,y) all, (7,y) all, (x,0) all, (x,7) all.\n> \n> For pathfinding, only care about playable cells.\n> \n> Snake position: only head at (5,2)\n> \n> Food at: (6,3), (5,5), (6,6), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is listed.\n> \n> Now, from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3), D to (5,1), or R to (6,2).\n> \n> If I go R to (6,2) on turn 3:\n> \n> Then at (6,2), head direction would be R (if I moved right).\n> \n> Then on turn 4, from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) which has food, so eat it, and snake grows to length 2.\n> \n> After eating, the new tail is added, so positions: head at (6,3), body at (6,2)? When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, head is at food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position. But since only one segment, when it eats, it becomes head and body; the body is where the head was before moving.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> But if snake has only head, no tail, so after eating, the head moves to food, and a body segment is created at the previous head position.\n> \n> So for example, if snake is at [(5,2)], and I move to (6,3) and eat, then new positions: head at (6,3), body at (5,2) or at (6,2)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Suppose on turn 3, I move from (5,2) to (6,2) — no food at (6,2), so no eat, snake still length 1 at [(6,2)].\n> \n> Then on turn 4, from (6,2), I move U to (6,3) — food there, so eat, grow to length 2: head at (6,3), body at (6,2).\n> \n> Then on turn 5, from (6,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but head direction is U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, so collision? Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So (6,2) is the tail, and when I move, the tail moves, so if I move to (6,2), since the tail is there, but after I move, the tail moves away, so it should be safe, as long as it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,3), moving D to (6,2): at the moment of move, head at (6,3), body at (6,2), so moving to (6,2) would collide with body, but (6,2) is the tail, and since tail moves after head moves, it might be ok.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So yes, moving to the tail cell is allowed and safe, because the tail moves to the next position.\n> \n> Similarly, in this case, from (6,3), moving to (6,2) should be safe.\n> \n> Other moves: U to (6,4) which has food? (6,4) has food, so I could eat it.\n> \n> (6,4) has food with value 1.\n> \n> But if I move to (6,4) on turn 5, I eat it, grow to length 3.\n> \n> But I need to see the sequence.\n> \n> Back to turn 3 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R on turn 3 to (6,2)\n> \n> Then turn 4: move U to (6,3) — eat food, snake now head at (6,3), body at (6,2), length 2.\n> \n> Head direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 5: from (6,3), I can move:\n> \n> - U to (6,4): food there, so eat, grow. After eating, head at (6,4), body: previous head at (6,3), and previous body at (6,2), so positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2)\n> \n> - D to (6,2): but (6,2) is current tail, moving there should be safe. After move, head to (6,2), tail moves to where? When head moves to tail, the tail moves to the next segment, but since only two segments, moving head to (6,2), which was tail, so new head at (6,2), and the body segment (which was at (6,3)) becomes the new tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,3), body (6,2)\n> \n> If I move head down to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by tail. After move, head is at (6,2), and the tail moves: since it was a straight line, the body segment at (6,3) should move to where the head was? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, all body segments follow the path. When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from positions: segment 0: head at (6,3), segment 1: body at (6,2)\n> \n> If head moves to (6,2), which is the position of segment 1. But after head moves to (6,2), segment 1 (the body) needs to move to where segment 0 was, which is (6,3). But (6,3) is now empty? Let's see:\n> \n> - Head moves from (6,3) to (6,2)\n> \n> - Then body segment at (6,2) needs to move, but it was segment 1 at (6,2), now head is moving to (6,2), so collision? No, at the time of move, head is moving to (6,2), which is occupied by the tail. But the rule says it's allowed because the tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically: after head moves to (6,2), the body segment that was at (6,2) is no longer there; it moves to the previous position of the head, which is (6,3).\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,2), body at (6,3)\n> \n> So effectively, the snake has moved down, head at (6,2), tail at (6,3).\n> \n> No collision, and no growth.\n> \n> If I had moved to (6,4), I eat food, so head moves to (6,4), and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail was at (6,2), new segment at (6,2), body at (6,3), head at (6,4). So positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), body (6,2)\n> \n> Length 3.\n> \n> But back to the point.\n> \n> In my earlier plan, if I go to (6,3) on turn 4, then on turn 5 I can go to (6,4) to eat another food.\n> \n> (6,4) has food.\n> \n> But I need to think about the direction.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (5,5) is at (5,5), which is left and up from (6,4).\n> \n> But let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Another option from start: on turn 3, I could move U to (5,3) instead.\n> \n> (5,3) is not a wall, not obstacle. Is it playable? Obstacles are (1,3), but (5,3) is fine.\n> \n> Move U to (5,3) on turn 3.\n> \n> Then head at (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> Then turn 4, from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), or R to (6,3), or L to (4,3), or D to (5,2) but D is opposite of U? Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) instantly.\n> \n> So possible: U, L, R.\n> \n> (6,3) has food, so I can move R to (6,3) and eat on turn 4.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved R on turn 3 to (6,2), I could eat on turn 4 by moving U.\n> \n> But from (5,3), moving R to (6,3) directly eats.\n> \n> Let's compare the two paths.\n> \n> Path A: turn 3 move R to (6,2) — no eat, then turn 4 move U to (6,3) — eat.\n> \n> Path B: turn 3 move U to (5,3) — no eat, then turn 4 move R to (6,3) — eat.\n> \n> In both cases, I eat on turn 4.\n> \n> But in Path A, after turn 4, I am at (6,3) with body at (6,2)\n> \n> In Path B, after turn 4, I am at (6,3) with body at (5,3)\n> \n> Slightly different positions.\n> \n> From there, I can go to (6,4) to eat another food.\n> \n> (6,4) has food, life 8, so available longer.\n> \n> (6,3) has life 7, disappears on turn 10.\n> \n> Turn 4 is when I eat it, so it's fine.\n> \n> But let's plan further.\n> \n> Also, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Another food at (5,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (5,5) is at (5,5), which is above.\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6).\n> \n> Now, from (6,3) after eating, I can move to (6,4) on turn 5 to eat (6,4).\n> \n> Then from (6,4), I can go to other places.\n> \n> But let's see the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> For example, to reach (5,5), from (6,4), I could move left to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n> \n> (5,4) is not obstacle?

But let's confirm the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is U, so from (5,3), moving U would go to (5,4). But since there's only one segment, the tail is the same as head, but when it moves, the tail should move or something? I need to recall how snake movement works.\n> \n> In snake games, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail follows, but if there's only one segment, moving to a new cell should leave the tail behind, but since it's only one, after moving, it should be at the new position with length 1 still? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves forward, so if length is 1, moving to a new cell means the snake is now at that new cell with length 1. But in this case, since there's only one segment, moving from (5,3) to, say, (5,4) would mean the new position is [(5,4)], and the old position is empty.\n> \n> But when it eats food, it grows, so length increases.\n> \n> Here, snake positions are given as a list, so [(5,3)] means one segment at (5,3).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life_span 6\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life_span 6\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life_span 6\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is 1 for all, and it says \"Value and Life Span\", so for (6,3,6,1) – I think the format is (x,y, life_span, value), so value is +1 for all, meaning all are positive food.\n> \n> In the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (6,3,6,1)\" – so (x,y, life_span, value), and value=1, so all positive food.\n> \n> But value=1, so eating any gives +1 and increases length.\n> \n> Now, life_span: for (6,3), life_span 6 at turn 4, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 4 + 6 - 1? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L. Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if current turn is t, after this turn, life_span decreases by 1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, food has life_span L, after k turns, life_span becomes L - k, and when life_span <= 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Specifically, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning it is present for N more turns including current.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if current turn is T, and life_span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn T, life_span counter is L\n> \n> - After turn T, counter becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn T+1, counter becomes L-2, ..., until counter <=0, food disappears.\n> \n> So the food is available from turn T to turn T + L - 1, inclusive?

So snake becomes [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)].\n> \n> Then next turn, if I move, tail moves, etc.\n> \n> If I don't eat, tail moves with head.\n> \n> But here, (6,4) has food.\n> \n> Now, other options: D to (6,2), no food there.\n> \n> L to (5,3), which is tail, and no food there, I think. Food positions are (5,5), (6,6), (6,4), (1,5). No food at (5,3), so moving to (5,3) is safe but no eat.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, head at (6,3), tail at (5,3), they are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But the tail cell (5,3) does not have food, so no issue now.\n> \n> If tail had food, but here no.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4) is adjacent? (6,4) is above head, but tail is at (5,3), not adjacent to (6,4).\n> \n> I should plan a sequence of actions.\n> \n> Current turn t=5.\n> \n> I need to output actions for turn 5,6,7,... but how many? The sequence should be for several turns, at least 5 ahead, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but in answer, I need to provide an action sequence starting from t=5.\n> \n> It says: \"Action Sequence (in order): Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns. I think I need to provide a sequence for the immediate future, say 5 turns or so, but it might depend.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate a few moves.\n> \n> First, at turn 5, options:\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (6,4), eat food. Then snake becomes [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)], length 3. Head at (6,4).\n> \n> Then for turn 6, I need to move from there.\n> \n> But (6,4) is near the border.\n> \n> Grid: let me list all walls and obstacles for clarity.\n> \n> Borders: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> So (1,3) is obstacle, (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food: (5,5), (6,6), (6,4), (1,5)\n> \n> (1,5) has food, but there are obstacles around.\n> \n> Back to turn 5.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,4), I eat the food there.\n> \n> Then head at (6,4), which is not border, but y=4, x=6.\n> \n> From (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) but x=7 wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,3): but (6,3) is now the body segment, since snake is [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)], so (6,3) is body, so if I move D to (6,3), it would be body collision, deadly.\n> \n> L to (5,4): is that free? Let's see what cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> (5,4): not a wall, and not occupied by snake now, since snake has (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), so (5,4) is empty.\n> \n> U to (6,5): also empty.\n> \n> (6,5) is within bounds, x=6 y=5, not border or obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacles are at (1,6), etc., not (6,5).\n> \n> So from (6,4) after eating, moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but body, collision, invalid. L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only U or L.\n> \n> If U to (6,5), no food there.\n> \n> Then snake moves: head to (6,5), tail moves, so body: (6,4) and (6,3)? Positions: after move to U, head to (6,5), since no eat, tail moves, so new positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), tail (6,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> Before move turn 6: snake [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Move head to (6,5), no food at (6,5), so tail moves: tail (5,3) is removed, new positions: head (6,5), then body segments: (6,4) and (6,3)? Order: head moves to new position, then each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)], move head to (6,5), no eat, so new positions: head at (6,5), the segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the first body segment (which was head) moves to the new head position only if head moves, but in terms of positions: the new head is at (6,5), then the body segment that was at (6,4) moves to where the head was, but head was at (6,4), so it stays? Better to think of the list.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (6,4), index 1: (6,3), index 2: tail (5,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,5), since no eat, the tail (index 2) is removed, and each segment shifts: new head is (6,5), then segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (6,4), but index 0 was (6,4), so it stays at (6,4)? Confusion.\n> \n> Better: the positions are updated as: new head position is the move target. Then for each body segment, it moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for body segment at index i, it moves to the position that was at index i-1.\n> \n> After head move, the position that was head becomes the new position for the first body segment.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (6,4) head, (6,3) body, (5,3) tail ]\n> \n> After moving head to (6,5): new head at (6,5). Then the first body segment (was at (6,3)) moves to the previous head position (6,4). Then the tail segment (was at (5,3)) moves to the previous position of the first body segment, which was (6,3).\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (6,3). So [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> Tail was (5,3), but since no eat, it is removed, so only three segments now? Length was 3, no eat, so length remains 3, but tail moves.\n> \n> After move, snake is [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved L to (5,4) from (6,4), no eat, then head to (5,4), body to (6,4), body to (6,3), so [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> Back to turn 5.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,4) and eat, then for turn 6, from (6,4) head, I can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4), since D and R are invalid.\n> \n> (6,5) has no food, (5,4) has no food.\n> \n> Food is at (5,5), (6,6), etc.\n> \n> (6,6) has food, which is at (6,6), life span 5.\n> \n> From (6,4), if I move U to (6,5) on turn 6, then head at (6,5), then I can move to (6,6) on turn 7 to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see if possible.\n> \n> First, at turn 5, if I choose not to eat (6,4), what are other options.\n> \n> At turn 5, I can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> Move D to (6,2): no food, then snake moves to [(6,2), (6,3)] since tail moves? After move, head to (6,2), body to previous head (6,3), tail removed, so [(6,2), (6,3)] length 2.\n> \n> Then for turn 6, head at (6,2), direction south? Last move was D, so direction D.\n> \n> Then possible moves: from (6,2), D to (6,1), U to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, collision if I go back, but direction is D, so U is opposite? Current direction is D, so cannot move U (opposite), can move L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall, or D to (6,1).\n> \n> (6,1) is not wall, y=1>0, x=6.\n> \n> U to (6,3) is invalid because it's body and also opposite direction? But body collision takes precedence.\n> \n> (6,3) is body, so moving to it is deadly, and also U is opposite to current D, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So from (6,2), moves: D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R invalid.\n> \n> No food at those, and (6,4) is above, but I moved away.\n> \n> Not good, I might miss the food at (6,4).\n> \n> Similarly, move L at turn 5 to (5,3): since (5,3) is tail, it's safe, no eat, so snake becomes [(5,3), (6,3)]? After move head to (5,3), which was tail, so body moves to previous head (6,3), tail removed, so new snake [(5,3), (6,3)], head at (5,3), direction west since moved left.\n> \n> Then for turn 6, from (5,3), possible moves: L to (4,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, collision.\n> \n> Direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> So moves: L to (4,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2).\n> \n> (5,4) has no food, but it's a cell, not wall or food.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) is close.\n> \n> (5,5) has food, which is above (5,4).\n> \n> So if I go to (5,4) on turn 6, then to (5,5) on turn 7 to eat.\n> \n> But let's compare to eating (6,4) now.\n> \n> Eating (6,4) at turn 5 seems good because it's there and life span 6, plenty of time, but I can eat it now.\n> \n> But after eating, I'm at (6,4) with a longer snake, and limited moves.\n> \n> From (6,4) after eating, I have to move to (6,5) or (5,4) on turn 6.\n> \n> Say I move to (6,5) on turn 6, then to (6,6) on turn 7 to eat that food.\n> \n> (6,6) has food, life span 5, so at turn 7, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 5: move U to (6,4), eat, snake: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Turn 6: from (6,4), move U to (6,5), no food, so snake moves: head to (6,5), body to (6,4), body to (6,3)?

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls and can't be moved to.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then (6,3), then (5,3). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is Up, which means it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> All food is positive here; no negative food mentioned. Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so I need to consider how many turns left for each food.\n> \n> Current turn is 6.\n> \n> For (5,5): life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, life span N means it will disappear after N turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span is L, then at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.

It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 8x8, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are out of bounds. Also, internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,5), then body at (6,4), and tail at (6,3). So the snake is vertical, going up? Head direction is U, meaning up, so it's moving upwards. Since positions are given as [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3)], and head direction is U, that means from (6,4) to (6,5) is up, so the snake is moving north.\n> \n> Head direction U means it moved to (6,5) from (6,4), I think. Positions are head first, so (6,5) is head, (6,4) is segment after head, (6,3) is tail. Since head direction is U, it came from below, so from (6,4) to (6,5), so moving up.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. But I need to check for any negative food; here all are +1.\n> \n> Life span: For (5,5), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 7, it will disappear after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone on turn t + N. But since countdown decreases every turn including current, if life span is 3 on turn 7, on turn 8 it will be 2, turn 9 it will be 1, and on turn 10 it should be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N on turn t, it decreases to N-1 on turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (5,5) with life span 3 on turn 7:\n> \n> - Turn 7: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 8: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 9: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 10: life span 0, disappears\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 3, same as above.\n> \n> (1,5) life span 7, so on turn 7:7, turn 8:6, ..., up to turn 13:1, turn 14:0, gone.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10, so lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The action sequence should start from turn 7, and go for several turns. But how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan for at least 5 moves, but the sequence might be shorter if I can't see that far, but I should aim for 5 or more actions.\n> \n> Also, in the answer format, it says \"Action Sequence\" for turns starting from t1, so for turn 7, turn 8, etc., and it should be in order.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 are all walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6?

In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> But snake positions: head (6,5), which is near right side, y=5.\n> \n> Now, snake: head (6,5), body (6,4), tail (6,3). So it's on x=6, y=3,4,5.\n> \n> Head direction U, so moving up, towards y=6.\n> \n> Available moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite, and no instant reverse.

Also, walls: y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is y=6, which is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6? y from 1 to 6 should be free, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable? y=0 is wall, y=1 is bottom row? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically, in grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But here, movement U is (x,y+1), so if y increases up, then (0,0) is bottom-left, (0,7) is top-left, etc.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls.

Currently, (6,6) has food, but no snake or wall, I think. Snake is at (6,5),(6,4),(6,3), so (6,6) is empty except for food.\n> \n> Walls: (6,6) is not a wall cell, since walls are only borders and obstacles; borders are lines, not cells? The input says \"Cells occupied by walls\", and \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4)\n> \n> So (6,6) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake, so moving to (6,6) is possible.\n> \n> Left: to (5,5) - (5,5) has food, and is not wall or snake.\n> \n> Down: to (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied by the body, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Right: to (7,5) - x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> Now, U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> Both have food, positive.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's see the current state.\n> \n> Snake length: 3 segments.\n> \n> If I eat food, length increases by 1, so to 4.\n> \n> Now, for (6,6): if I move U to (6,6), I eat the food there, since head moves onto it. Then snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), and new tail at (6,3)? When you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; let's think about movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, the head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves one cell, so length same. If food, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, similarly: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So, if I move to a food cell, I eat it, and the tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In positions, after move: if I move to food, head to new cell, body follows, tail stays, so new head position, and body segments shift, but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> For example, current: positions [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6) and eat food, new positions: head at (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, (6,4) body, and (6,3) tail, but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]? No.\n> \n> Standard: after moving and eating, the new head is at the new position, the segment that was head is now neck, etc., and the tail remains where it was because it didn't move.\n> \n> So from [(6,5)H, (6,4)B, (6,3)T]\n> \n> After move U to (6,6) with food: head to (6,6), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so body: (6,5) is now first body segment, (6,4) second body, (6,3) tail. So positions: [(6,6)H, (6,5)B, (6,4)B, (6,3)T] length 4.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (5,5) and eat, positions: [(5,5)H, (6,5)B, (6,4)B, (6,3)T] length 4.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> First, move U to (6,6): eat food at (6,6), value +1, length to 4.\n> \n> But is there any danger? (6,6) is at the top-right corner, since y=6, x=6, and walls at y=7 and x=7, so adjacent cells: up from (6,6) is (6,7) which is wall (y=7), left is (5,6), down is (6,5) which will be body, right is (7,6) wall.\n> \n> After eating, head at (6,6), body at (6,5), etc.\n> \n> Possible moves from there: since head direction would be U (if I moved U), so I can move U, L, R, but U to (6,7) is wall, invalid. R to (7,6) wall, invalid. So only possible is L to (5,6) or D to (6,5), but (6,5) is now body, so collision if move D.\n> \n> After head at (6,6), body at (6,5), so moving down to (6,5) would be collision.\n> \n> So from (6,6), only possible move is L to (5,6), if it's free.\n> \n> (5,6) is not occupied, no wall, no food listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But after moving to (6,6), I have to consider next moves.\n> \n> If I move U now, to (6,6), then I must move L to (5,6) next, because no other choice.\n> \n> Then from (5,6), I can go L, D, R? Head direction would be L (since moved left from (6,6) to (5,6)).\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,6): L to (4,6), D to (5,5), R to (6,6) but (6,6) is now body? After first move: turn 7, move U to (6,6), positions: [(6,6)H, (6,5)B, (6,4)B, (6,3)T]\n> \n> Turn 8, move L to (5,6): head to (5,6), and since no food at (5,6)? We don't know if there's food, but currently only listed foods, so assume no food, so tail moves, meaning the tail (6,3) is left, so positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), and (6,4) is new tail? Movement: head to new cell, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> After turn 7: positions [(6,6)H, (6,5)B, (6,4)B, (6,3)T]\n> \n> Turn 8, move to (5,6): head to (5,6), then body segments follow: the first body segment moves to where head was, so (6,6) becomes body, (6,5) becomes body, and (6,4) becomes tail.

Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - New head: (5,6)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment moves to old head position (6,6)\n> \n> - Second body segment moves to old first body position (6,5)\n> \n> - Third body segment (tail) moves to old second body position (6,4)\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (6,6), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: tail (6,3)\n> \n> After move: head to (5,6), segment 1 to (6,6), segment 2 to (6,5), segment 3 to (6,4).

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 9, it will be gone. Similarly, (1,5) has life span 5, so it will last until turn 13 (since current turn is 9, life span 5: turns 9,10,11,12,13, gone after turn 13). Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for (5,5), life span 1, it exists only on turn 9, and disappears before turn 10.

It's turn 12. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body segments at (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6).

Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so at turn 12, the food at (1,5) has 2 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 13? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, so it can be eaten up to turn t + N - 1? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Example: if L=2 at turn 12, it decreases to 1 at turn 13, and disappears after turn 13, so it can be eaten on turns 12 or 13.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has L=5, so available until turn 12+5-1=16?

Snake positions: index 0 is head, so head (4,6), then segment 1: (4,5), which is directly below, so yes, it moved up to (4,6) from (4,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.

When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So from positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]\n> \n> After move L to (3,6), new head is (3,6), then segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,6), but (4,6) was head, now segment 1 is (4,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> No food eaten now, so length same, tail moves forward.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (3,6), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,6), second body segment to previous first body position (4,5), third to (5,5), fourth to (5,6), and tail to previous fourth position? Positions: let's index.\n> \n> Before move: pos[0] = head (4,6), pos[1] = (4,5), pos[2] = (5,5), pos[3] = (5,6), pos[4] = tail (6,6)\n> \n> After move left to (3,6): new head is (3,6). Then, since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new body: segment 1 moves to pos[0] old (4,6), segment 2 moves to pos[1] old (4,5), segment 3 moves to pos[2] old (5,5), and segment 4 moves to pos[3] old (5,6). Tail was pos[4] (6,6), which is removed.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]\n> \n> Tail is now (5,6).\n> \n> Now, from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) wall\n> \n> - D: (3,5)\n> \n> - L: (2,6)\n> \n> - R: not allowed since direction is L, opposite is R.\n> \n> Direction: head moved left, so new direction is L, so cannot move R (right).\n> \n> So can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6)\n> \n> (3,5): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake? New snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). So (3,5) not occupied.\n> \n> (2,6): not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), etc., (2,6) not listed, so free. And not in snake positions.\n> \n> So both (3,5) and (2,6) are possible.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,5) and (2,6) are nearby.\n> \n> (1,5) has to be eaten by turn 13, since L=2 at turn 12, so after turn 13, it disappears. Turn 12: L=2, can be eaten turn 12 or 13; after turn 13, L=1 decreases to 0? At turn 13, if not eaten, L=1, then after turn 13, it decreases and disappears? Let's clarify the life span countdown.\n> \n> Problem: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, when food is present, life_span L means it has L turns left, including current turn.\n> \n> So at turn 12, L=2: it can be eaten on turn 12 or turn 13. After turn 13, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, turn 13: if not eaten, L=1, then after turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,5), must be eaten on turn 12 or 13.\n> \n> But on turn 12, I am moving to (3,6), not to (1,5), so I can't eat it on turn 12.\n> \n> Then on turn 13, I need to eat it.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5).\n> \n> From (3,6) on turn 12, after move.\n> \n> Turn 12: I move to (3,6), so at end of turn 12, head at (3,6).\n> \n> Then turn 13: I can move from (3,6).\n> \n> To reach (1,5) from (3,6) in one move?

Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So current positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (4,5), 4: tail (5,5)\n> \n> If move left to (2,5), new head at (2,5), then body: segment 1 moves to old head (3,5), segment 2 moves to old segment 1 (3,6), segment 3 moves to old segment 2 (4,6), segment 4 moves to old segment 3 (4,5), and tail old segment 4 (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new snake: head (2,5), body: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> 3.

It's turn 15, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), and (2,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments at (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (2,6) with value 1 and life span 3. This means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So after turn 15, it has 2 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 15, life span is 3, so it will disappear after turn 17? Let's clarify: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning after turn t1 + N - 1 or something. The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so:\n> \n> - At turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life span L, it will be gone by turn t + L. But since it decreases each turn, at turn t+1, life span is L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,6): value 1, life span 3 at turn 15. So:\n> \n> - Turn 15: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 16: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 17: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 18: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 17, and on turn 18 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): value 1, life span 5 at turn 15. So disappears after turn 19.\n> \n> (3,2): value 1, life span 8 at turn 15. Disappears after turn 22.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food only, no negative food mentioned. Good.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,5), direction left. Current possible moves: since head direction is L, I can't move right instantly (no instant reverse), so possible moves are U, D, L. But L is the current direction, so moving left might be possible if not blocked.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions from (2,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,4)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): but since current direction is L, moving right is opposite, so not allowed. So only U, D, L are possible.\n> \n> Now, check what's at these positions:\n> \n> - (2,6): is this a wall? Walls: internal obstacles include (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). (2,6) is not listed, so not a wall. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,5) head, (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (2,6) is not in the list, so empty? Food is at (2,6), but food can be on a cell, and snake can move there to eat it, but only if not blocked.\n> \n> (2,6) has food, and it's not a wall or snake body? Snake body: positions are (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (2,6) is not occupied by snake, so it should be free, except for the food.\n> \n> But the food at (2,6) might be under the snake? No, the snake is not at (2,6) currently. Snake head is at (2,5), body at (3,5), etc. (2,6) is empty except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5): let's see if it's wall or snake.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders.

(2,4) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall. So cannot move to (2,4).\n> \n> So from (2,5):\n> \n> - U to (2,6): possible, and there is food.\n> \n> - D to (2,4): but (2,4) is wall, so impossible.\n> \n> - L to (1,5): possible, no immediate obstacle.\n> \n> - R to (3,5): but (3,5) is snake body, and it's not the tail? Snake positions: head (2,5), then (3,5) is the first body segment. Moving to (3,5) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), which is the last segment.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, except if food is there or something.\n> \n> But for collision: head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because when head moves, the tail also moves, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment causes collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, body segments are: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). Tail is (4,5).\n> \n> So from (2,5):\n> \n> - Moving to (3,5): (3,5) is a body segment, not tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Moving to (2,6): not a body segment, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> - Moving to (1,5): not body or wall, possible.\n> \n> - Moving to (2,4): wall, impossible.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n> \n> Now, U to (2,6) has food, which is positive.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (2,5), tail at (4,5). Are they adjacent? (2,5) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are two apart. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right.\n> \n> (2,5) neighbors: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5). Tail is (4,5), which is not adjacent; it's two cells away.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> If I move to (2,6), I eat the food there. Food at (2,6) with value 1, life span 3.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new tail added. Current positions: after moving head to (2,6), and body follows.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new cell, if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one. Else, tail moves, snake length same.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6), there is food, so I eat it, head now at (2,6), body segments: the previous head (2,5) becomes new body, so positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), then (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and tail (4,5) remains? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to food cell, food consumed, body segments move as before, but tail does not move, so new tail is added at the end, snake length increases by one.\n> \n> Positions: let's list current: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: tail (4,5).\n> \n> After moving U to (2,6):\n> \n> - New head at (2,6)\n> \n> - Since food eaten, snake grows: new positions: head (2,6), then body: previous head (2,5) now segment 1, then (3,5) segment 2, (3,6) segment 3, (4,6) segment 4, and tail (4,5) remains segment 5?

It's turn 16. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So, I should sketch this grid mentally.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7. Walls are at the borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are all walls. Internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So, let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All border cells: e.g., (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) – but since it's borders, it's the outer edges.\n> \n> Specifically: x=0 or x=7 for any y, and y=0 or y=7 for any x. So corners are included.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So let's plot this.\n> \n> Head at (2,6), direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y? In coordinates, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? But in this context, since U is (x,y+1), it might be that y increases upwards, like Cartesian coordinates with origin at bottom left. But in many games, y increases downwards. I need to clarify.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1) – if y+1, and walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 and y=7 being walls, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so U (up) increases y, meaning moving to higher y is up.\n> \n> Similarly, D (down) decreases y to lower y.\n> \n> L decreases x, R increases x.\n> \n> So, for example, from (2,6), U would be (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Current head position (2,6), direction U, so it was moving up to (2,6) from previous?

But direction is given as U, which is up.\n> \n> If head is at (2,6) and moving U, that means from previous position, it moved to (2,6) with direction U, so previous head position was probably (2,5), and it moved up to (2,6). Yes, that makes sense: from (2,5) to (2,6) is U, increasing y.\n> \n> Then the body: (2,5) is the neck, then (3,5), which is right and down? (3,5) to (3,6)? Let's see the sequence: positions: index 0: (2,6) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So from head to tail: (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled. From (2,6) down to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then up to (3,6), then right to (4,6), then down to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, meaning it just moved up to (2,6), so from (2,5) to (2,6).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current head (2,6):\n> \n> - U: (2,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (2,5) – but (2,5) is the body segment, but it's the neck, and since the snake will move, the tail will move away, so moving to (2,5) might be possible if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> Collision rules: moving into a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away. Specifically, if head moves to a cell occupied by the tail, and the tail moves, it's ok, but if it's another body part, it collides.\n> \n> Here, from (2,6), moving D to (2,5): (2,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. When the snake moves, if head goes to (2,5), and the body moves, the segment at (2,5) will move to where? Let's simulate.\n> \n> In general, when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment. So if head moves to a new cell, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, until tail.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied, it might collide.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If head moves to an empty cell or food, it grows if food, else just moves.\n> \n> - If head moves to a body segment, it collides unless that segment is the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,6), moving D to (2,5): (2,5) is currently occupied by the second segment (index 1).\n> \n> After move, head would be at (2,5), and the second segment would move to where head was, (2,6), so (2,5) is now the new head position, but the old position (2,5) was body, and now it's being vacated? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start: positions: head (2,6), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (4,6), tail (4,5)\n> \n> If head moves D to (2,5): (2,5) is currently seg1.\n> \n> After move: head is now at (2,5), but (2,5) was seg1, so seg1 must move to the new position. But when head moves to (2,5), which is occupied by seg1, this causes a collision because head is touching seg1 immediately.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (2,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment, so moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other body cells would collide.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - U: (2,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,5) - occupied by body (seg1), not tail, so collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: (1,6) - x=1, y=6. Is this wall? Internal obstacles include (1,6), which is a wall. So invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4). So (1,6) is wall, so L to (1,6) invalid.\n> \n> - R: (3,6) - (3,6) is occupied by seg3? Positions: seg3 is (3,6), so occupied by body.\n> \n> (3,6) is the fourth position? Indices: 0: (2,6) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So (3,6) is index 3, which is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Moving R to (3,6) would be collision.\n> \n> But what about other directions?
