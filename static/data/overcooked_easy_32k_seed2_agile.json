Moving left to (1,3) positions her to face and interact with the dispenser next turn.  \n- This aligns with the plan to prioritize filling the left pot first, leveraging her starting position for efficiency. Bob can handle the right pot (3,0) independently.  \n- The action sequence (L→U→I→D→D→I) will add the first onion to the pot by turn 5, initiating the cooking process as early as possible.  \n\n**Collaboration Note**: Bob should concurrently move right (R) to (3,1) to start gathering onions for the right pot (3,0).",

Alice is at (1,3) holding an onion, facing up (U). The nearest pot is at (1,0), directly below her.\n2. To interact with the pot, she needs to be adjacent to it (at (1,1)) and facing it (down). \n3.

This is the first step in the coordinated plan to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (0, 3) and add it to the pot at (1, 0), which already contains 1 onion. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. Alice is currently at (2, 1), holding nothing, and facing right (R).\n2. Moving up to (2, 2) positions her to then move left to (1, 3) in subsequent turns, where she can interact with the kitchen counter at (0, 3) to pick up the onion.\n3. This action aligns with the plan to have Alice add the third onion to the pot at (1, 0) after Bob adds his onion (he is currently holding one and can add it to the pot in parallel).\n\nThus, the immediate action for Alice at turn \\( t_0 = 28 \\) is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Adding both onions will complete the recipe and start cooking.\n\n2. **Alice's Position**: At (1,3), facing left, holding an onion. The pot is at (1,0), accessible by moving down to (1,1) and facing down to interact.\n\n3. **Immediate Action**: Move down (D) to (1,2).

Alice is currently at (1,2) holding an onion, facing down.\n2. The pot at (1,0) already contains 1 onion and needs 2 more to start cooking.\n3. By moving down to (1,1), Alice will be adjacent to the pot and facing it (since moving down changes orientation to down), allowing her to interact with the pot in the next turn to add her onion.\n4.

The pot at (1,0) has 2 onions and needs 1 more to start cooking (3 onions → reward 20). The optimal action is to move **Down (D)** toward the pot (path: (1,3)→(1,2)→(1,1)), where she can later interact to add the onion. This aligns with the strategic reference to complete the soup. Bob is independently fetching a plate (action sequence ensures coordination). \n\n**Key Steps**:  \n1. **Alice moves D** (toward pot).  \n2. Subsequent turns: Alice adds onion (I), Bob grabs plate (I), and they wait for cooking (5 turns).  \n3. Post-cooking, Bob serves and delivers the soup.  \n\n*Note*: The boxed action is Alice's immediate move (D) at \\( t_0 \\). The full sequence ensures maximal reward via coordinated soup completion and delivery.",

Alice is at (1, 1), facing down (D), which is directly adjacent to the pot at (1, 0).\n2. The pot currently has 2 onions and needs 1 more to start cooking (3 onions total). Alice is holding 1 onion.\n3. Adding the onion will start the cooking process immediately, and the soup will be ready in 5 turns (at turn 49).\n4.

The serving counter is at (4, 2), which is directly to her right. She is adjacent to the serving counter and facing it, so she can interact (I) to deliver the soup immediately.\n2. **Strategic Goal**: Delivering the soup now maximizes the reward and allows Alice to transition to gathering ingredients for the next soup. The past plan also aligns with this action, as it prioritizes securing the reward first.\n3. **Coordination with Bob**: Bob is holding an onion and can start working on filling a pot (either (1, 0) or (3, 0)), while Alice focuses on delivering and then gathering more ingredients.\n\nThus, the optimal immediate action is to deliver the soup by interacting with the serving counter.",

Alice is at (3,3), facing up, and holding nothing. The onion at (4,3) is adjacent to her right.\n2. To interact with (4,3), she must face right. Since moving right to (4,3) is not possible (it's occupied by the kitchen counter), she needs to change her orientation to right without moving.\n3. Changing orientation to right (R) is the correct action here, as it allows her to interact with (4,3) in the next turn to pick up the onion.\n\nThus, the immediate action for Alice at turn \\( t_0 = 68 \\) is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The pot at (3,0) already has 2 onions and needs 1 more to start cooking.\n2. **Alice's State**: At (3,3) holding an onion, facing right. She needs to reach (3,1) (adjacent to the pot at (3,0)) to interact.\n3. **Path**: Move down twice (to (3,2) then (3,1)), then interact to add the onion. This will start the 5-turn cooking process.\n4. **Coordination**: Bob is holding an onion but is far from the nearly full pot. His onion can be used for another soup later.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{D}  \n\n**Next Steps**:\n- Turn 71: Move down again (D) to (3,1).\n- Turn 72: Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot (now cooking). \n- Subsequent actions: Retrieve a plate from (0,2) to serve the soup when ready at turn 77.\n\nThis prioritizes starting the cooking process as early as possible. The outdated plan aligns with this strategy but includes unnecessary plate retrieval steps; the current state allows Alice to focus solely on adding the onion first.",

This will complete the recipe (3 onions), start cooking (5 turns), and allow Bob to fetch a plate for serving.  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- Moving down (D) aligns Alice to interact with the pot on turn 72 (action **I**).  \n- After adding the onion, she can reposition (e.g., move up twice) to avoid blocking Bob’s path to the pot for serving.  \n\n\\boxed{D}  \n\n**Strategic Context:**  \n- This follows the thinking model’s plan but focuses on the immediate step.  \n- The next steps (interact, reposition) will be handled in subsequent turns.  \n- Maximizes efficiency by ensuring the soup starts cooking immediately.",

The only available recipe is:\n   - **Recipe 1**: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; cooking time: 5 turns.\n\n2. **Current Pot State**:\n   - Pot at (3, 0) has 1 onion and is not full (needs 2 more onions to start cooking).\n\n3. **Player States**:\n   - **Alice (you)**:\n     - Position: (3, 1)\n     - Orientation: Down (facing the pot at (3, 0))\n     - Holding: Nothing\n   - **Bob**:\n     - Position: (2, 2)\n     - Orientation: Up\n     - Holding: 1 onion\n\n4. **Available Onions**:\n   - Onions on kitchen counters: (0, 1), (0, 3), (4, 3)\n   - Onion dispensers: (1, 4), (3, 4) (but these are farther away and not immediately useful).\n\n5. **Key Observations**:\n   - Alice is adjacent to the pot at (3, 0) and facing it but cannot interact meaningfully since she is not holding an item.\n   - Bob is holding an onion and can contribute to filling the pot but is not currently in position to do so.\n   - The pot needs 2 more onions to start cooking. Bob can add one immediately if he reaches (3, 1), and Alice can fetch the third onion from a nearby kitchen counter.\n\n### Strategic Plan\n\n1. **Immediate Goal**: Add the remaining 2 onions to the pot to start cooking the soup as quickly as possible.\n   - Bob should add his onion first by moving to (3, 1) and interacting with the pot.\n   - Alice should fetch the third onion from a nearby kitchen counter (e.g., (0, 1)) and add it to the pot.\n\n2. **Alice's Actions**:\n   - Alice is currently at (3, 1), blocking Bob's path to the pot. She should move away to allow Bob to reach (3, 1).\n   - After moving, Alice can fetch an onion from the nearest kitchen counter (e.g., (0, 1)) and bring it back to the pot.\n\n3. **Bob's Actions (Assumed Coordination)**:\n   - Bob will move to (3, 1) and add his onion to the pot.\n   - After Alice adds the third onion, Bob can handle serving (getting a plate and delivering the soup).\n\n### Detailed Action Sequence for Alice\n\n1. **Turn 91 (Current Turn)**:\n   - Alice is at (3, 1). To free the space for Bob, she should move left to (2, 1).\n   - Action: `L` (move left to (2, 1), facing left).\n\n2. **Turn 92**:\n   - Alice is at (2, 1). She should move left to (1, 1) to approach the kitchen counter at (0, 1).\n   - Action: `L` (move left to (1, 1), facing left).\n\n3. **Turn 93**:\n   - Alice is at (1, 1), facing left (toward (0, 1)). She can interact to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter.\n   - Action: `I` (pick up onion from (0, 1)).\n\n4. **Turn 94**:\n   - Alice is at (1, 1), holding an onion. She should move right to (2, 1) to return toward the pot.\n   - Action: `R` (move right to (2, 1), facing right).\n\n5. **Turn 95**:\n   - Alice is at (2, 1). She should move right to (3, 1) to reach the pot.\n   - Action: `R` (move right to (3, 1), facing right).\n\n6. **Turn 96**:\n   - Alice is at (3, 1), facing right. She needs to face down to interact with the pot.\n   - Action: `D` (change orientation to down).\n\n7. **Turn 97**:\n   - Alice is at (3, 1), facing down. She can now interact to add her onion to the pot.\n   - Action: `I` (add onion to pot at (3, 0)).\n\n### Expected Outcome\n\n- By turn 97, the pot will have 3 onions (added by Bob and Alice), and cooking will start. The soup will be ready at turn 102.\n- After this, Alice or Bob can fetch a plate from (0, 2) and deliver the soup to the serving counter at (4, 2).\n\n### Immediate Action for Alice at Turn 91\n\nThe first action in the sequence is for Alice to move left to free the space for Bob.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Moving left to (1,1) positions her to interact with the onion on (0,1) next turn.  \n- This action initiates the critical path of gathering the third onion for the pot at (3,0), which already contains 1 onion. Bob will concurrently add his held onion (from (2,3)) to the pot.  \n- Efficiency is maximized by dividing tasks: Alice fetches ingredients while Bob handles plate preparation for future serving.  \n\n*Note*: Subsequent actions (e.g., interacting with (0,1) at turn 93) will follow this initial move.",

The nearest onion sources are:\n     - Kitchen counter at (4, 3) (contains an onion).\n     - Onion dispenser at (3, 4).\n   - The kitchen counter at (4, 3) is closer (requires moving to (3, 3) and facing east) than the dispenser at (3, 4) (requires moving to (3, 3) and facing north).\n\n2. **Path to Fetch Onion from (4, 3)**:\n   - From (3, 1):\n     - Move north to (3, 2) (action: U).\n     - Move north to (3, 3) (action: U).\n     - Change orientation to face east (action: R).\n     - Interact to pick up onion from (4, 3) (action: I).\n   - Then return to (3, 1) to add the onion to the pot:\n     - Move south to (3, 2) (action: D).\n     - Move south to (3, 1) (action: D).\n     - Interact to add onion to pot (action: I).\n\n3. **Bob's Role**:\n   - Bob can place his onion on a kitchen counter (e.g., (0, 1)) to free his hands, then fetch a plate from (0, 2) to prepare for serving the soup once it is cooked.\n\n### Immediate Action for Alice at Turn 98\n\nAlice should start moving toward the onion source at (4, 3). The first step is to move north to (3, 2).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",
