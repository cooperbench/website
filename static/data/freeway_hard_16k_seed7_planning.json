        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions and how they move over time. The current turn is t_1 = 0, so for any future turn T, the car positions at turn T are based on their state at t=0.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3) — head at -48, tail at -59? That seems backward. Typically, for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here it says head -48, tail -59, and direction right. -48 is greater than -59, so head is at -48, tail at -59? That would mean the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, so head at -48 (right end), tail at -59 (left end), and moving right, so speed +3 per turn.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] with tail < head? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ, h]? No, it says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the update, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the state, it's (head, tail).\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for freeway 4, it has (-48,-59,right,4), which should be similar.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume.\n\nIn the state, it says (head, tail), so for right-moving, if head is at the front, so for (-48,-59,right,3), head is -48, tail is -59, so since it's moving right, the span should be from tail to head, [ -59, -48 ]? But the update says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail ≤ head.\n\nIn this case, for (-48,-59,right,3), head is -48, tail is -59, so tail = -59, head = -48, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at turn T, span is [ -59 + 3(T-0), -48 + 3(T-0) ] = [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut -59 + 3T and -48 + 3T, so the car is from x= -59+3T to x= -48+3T.\n\nCollision if 0 is in this interval for the freeway I'm on at turn T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving except? Freeway 4 has three cars, all right-moving? Let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 3) so tail τ = -59, head h = -48, span at T: [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48, -59, right, 3) so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 4) so τ=-59, h=-48, span at T: [ -59 + 4T, -48 + 4T ]\n\nSecond: (-12, -23, right, 4) τ=-23, h=-12, span at T: [ -23 + 4T, -12 + 4T ]\n\nThird: (24, 13, right, 4)? 24 and 13, head=24, tail=13? But 13<24, so τ=13, h=24, span at T: [13 + 4T, 24 + 4T]\n\nBut direction is right, so moving right, yes.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12) τ=-59, h=-48, span at T: [ -59 + 12T, -48 + 12T ]\n\nSecond: (0, -11, right, 12) τ=-11, h=0, span at T: [ -11 + 12T, 0 + 12T ] = [ -11 + 12T, 12T ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nAll freeways have cars, and I need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I have to pass through y=1 to 8 at some points.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, no car, y=9 is the target, no car mentioned, so probably safe.\n\nThe collision is only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway y, I collide if for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new y, I am not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T, so I collide only if on y_T at turn T, 0 is in some car's span for that freeway.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nI start at (0,0) at turn t=0.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H means I need to get to y=9 as fast as possible, with actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nt_1 is given as 0, so turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so at turn t_1 + H, position is after H actions.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1 (current turn), position is (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nAnd so on, up to after H-1 actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn (0 + H-1), y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is a_0 to a_{H-2}? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn (t_1 + H), position is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1? No.\n\nThe position after action at t is y_{t+1}, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen action a_t is chosen, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1})\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we want minimal H.\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=0, y_0=0.\n\nI need to find actions a_0 to a_{H-1} such that y_H =9, with no collision during the path.\n\nCollision at turn t only if when I am on y_t (which is between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, at turn t, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, since I move one step per turn in y, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 moves up, but I can stay or go down, so H could be more than 9, but minimal should be 9 if no cars, but with cars, I might need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied, i.e., if 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen for each turn T, and each freeway k, I can compute if it is safe to be on k at turn T.\n\nSafe if no car on k has 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, for each k and T, safe if for all cars on k, 0 not in [low, high] of the span at T.\n\nThen I can make a grid of safe times for each row.\n\nBut turns are infinite, but since cars move, the pattern repeats or something, but with different speeds, it might be periodic or I need to find when it's safe.\n\nSince the cars are at different positions and speeds, I should find for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span at T: [ -59 + 3T, -48 + 3T ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nSo -59 + 3T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3T ≤ 0 => 3T ≤ 59 => T ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T ≤ 19 since T integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 3T => 48 ≤ 3T => T ≥ 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in span, unsafe.\n\nT=16,17,18,19\n\nCheck: T=16: -59 + 48 = -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=17: -59+51=-8, -48+51=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nT=18: -59+54=-5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=19: -59+57=-2, -48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nT=20: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not in.\n\nT=15: -59+45=-14, -48+45=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car, unsafe same times T=16-19.\n\nFreeway 3: same, unsafe T=16-19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above but speed 4, span [ -59 +4T, -48 +4T ]\n\n0 in: -59+4T ≤0 ≤ -48+4T\n\n-59+4T ≤0 => 4T≤59 => T≤14.75, T≤14\n\n0 ≤ -48+4T => 48≤4T => T≥12\n\nSo T=12,13,14\n\nT=12: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=13: -59+52= -7, -48+52=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=14: -59+56= -3, -48+56=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=15: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=11: -59+44= -15, -48+44= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) τ=-23, h=-12, span [ -23 +4T, -12 +4T ]\n\n0 in: -23+4T ≤0 ≤ -12+4T\n\n-23+4T≤0 => 4T≤23 => T≤5.75, T≤5\n\n0≤ -12+4T => 12≤4T => T≥3\n\nT=3: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=4: -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=5: -23+20= -3, -12+20=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=6: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=2: -23+8= -15, -12+8= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at T=3,4,5\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13, so τ=13, h=24, span [13+4T, 24+4T]\n\n0 in: 13+4T ≤0 ≤24+4T? But 13+4T ≥13>0 for T≥0, so 0 cannot be ≤ left end which is positive, so 0 never in span. Since min x=13+4T >0, so always safe for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 4, unsafe when first car or second car has 0 in span, so at T=3,4,5 from second car, and T=12,13,14 from first car.\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) τ=-59, h=-48, span [ -59+12T, -48+12T ]\n\n0 in: -59+12T ≤0 ≤ -48+12T\n\n-59+12T≤0 => 12T≤59 => T≤4.916, T≤4\n\n0≤ -48+12T => 48≤12T => T≥4\n\nT=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nSo only unsafe at T=4\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) τ=-11, h=0, span [ -11+12T, 0+12T ] = [ -11+12T, 12T ]\n\n0 in: -11+12T ≤0 ≤12T\n\nLeft: -11+12T ≤0 => 12T≤11 => T≤11/12<1, so T≤0 since T integer ≥0? T from 0.\n\nAt T=0: span [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, since 0≤0.\n\nRight: 0≤12T always for T≥0.\n\nSo -11+12T ≤0 ≤12T\n\nAt T=0: -11≤0≤0, yes 0 included.\n\nT=1: -11+12=1, 12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not in.\n\nT=0: [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the upper bound, included if closed interval.\n\nI think it is closed, since it says \"in\" the span, so includes endpoints.\n\nAt T=0, span [ -11, 0 ], so x=0 is included, so unsafe.\n\nFor T>0, not unsafe from this car.\n\nBut at T=0, for freeway 5, second car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, first car unsafe only at T=4.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe when either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt T=0, second car: unsafe\n\nT=1: no car covers 0, first car [ -59, -48] at T=0? At T=1: first car [ -59+12= -47, -48+12= -36]? [ -47, -36], all negative, 0 not in. Second car [ -11+12=1, 12], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly T=2: first [ -59+24= -35, -48+24= -24], neg. Second [ -11+24=13, 24], pos.\n\nT=3: first [ -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12], neg. Second [ -11+36=25, 36], pos.\n\nT=4: first [ -59+48= -11, -48+48=0], [ -11,0], 0 in. Second [ -11+48=37, 48], [37,48], 0 not in. So unsafe from first car.\n\nT=5: first [1,12], second [49,60], both not cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=0: from second car, T=4: from first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, since cars identical: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSo unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, unsafe T=0,4\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe T=0,4\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 unsafe at T=0,4\n\nI need to go from y=0 at T=0 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on y_T, and I start at T=0 on y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so on y=0 and y=9, no cars, so always safe, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nThe collision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at T=0, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, the path: I need to move through y=1 to 8 at various times without being there when unsafe.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I can control the time I spend on each row.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal time is 9 turns if I go up every turn, but I might hit unsafe spots.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row the unsafe times:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe 16-19\n\ny=3: same, unsafe 16-19\n\ny=4: unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=6: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=7: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=8: unsafe T=0,4\n\nI need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some safe time.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, I can delay or go back, but that might increase H, so for minimal H, I probably go up directly but choose when to move to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince unsafe times are sparse, I might be able to go up quickly.\n\nFirst, at T=0, I am on y=0.\n\nI can choose to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=0? y_t in [0,9], so from y=0, I can go to y=1 (U), or stay y=0 (S), or down? D would be y=-1, but y>=0, so from y=0, D not allowed? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, not allowed, so I think from y=0, I cannot go down, similarly from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nThe Δy_t: if a_t=D, Δy_t = -1, but y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0, y_{t+1} = -1 not allowed, so probably action D is invalid when y_t=0, similarly U invalid when y_t=9.\n\nBut in the action choice, it should be constrained.\n\nIn the game dynamics, it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so implicitly, actions are only allowed if they keep y within bounds.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U (to y=1) or S (stay y=0)\n\nAt y=9, U not possible, only D or S.\n\nBut we start at y=0, go to y=9.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to be on y=1 at some T, y=2 at some T, etc., up to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut not necessarily in sequence; I can go to y=1, then stay or go back, but for minimal time, I should go up.\n\nThe fastest is to go up every turn, so at turn T, y_T = T, for T from 0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, y_1=1, y_2=2, ..., y_9=9.\n\nThen I reach at T=9.\n\nNow, check for each T and y_T, if safe.\n\nT=0, y=0, safe (no freeway)\n\nT=1, y=1, freeway 1, is T=1 unsafe? From above, y=1 unsafe only at T=16-19, so at T=1, safe.\n\nT=2, y=2, similarly safe.\n\nT=3, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only at 16-19, T=3 safe.\n\nT=4, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14, so T=4 unsafe!\n\nOh, at T=4, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, T=5, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at T=0 and T=4, T=5 safe? Freeway 5 unsafe T=0 and T=4.\n\nT=4 unsafe, T=5 safe.\n\nBut at T=4, if I go directly, I would be on y=4 at T=4, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly up at constant speed for T=4.\n\nNow, T=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=4 at T=4.\n\nI could delay moving to y=4 or something.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, but moving down might not help for minimal time.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower or faster on some parts.\n\nFor example, at T=3, if I am on y=3, I could stay on y=3 instead of going to y=4 at T=4.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nFirst, list all unsafe (y,T) pairs.\n\ny=1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same T=16-19\n\ny=3: same T=16-19\n\ny=4: unsafe T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=6: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=7: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=8: unsafe T=0,4\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI need to have a sequence where for each turn, if I am on y between 1 and 8, T must not be unsafe for that y.\n\nSince I start at T=0 y=0, and want to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: since I need to increase y by 9, with possible stays or down, but down increases time, so for minimal time, I should not go down, only up or stay.\n\nStaying might be necessary to avoid unsafe times.\n\nGoing down would make me take more steps, so H larger, so for minimal H, I should never go down, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, from low y, I might need to stay to wait for safe time.\n\nBut staying increases time.\n\nSo I should go up as much as possible, but skip unsafe points by staying or adjusting.\n\nNow, in the direct path, only T=4 y=4 is problem, since at T=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nAt T=5, y=5 is safe, as we saw.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, T=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=3 y=3 safe, etc.\n\nSo at T=3, I could be on y=3, and instead of going to y=4 at T=4, I stay on y=3 at T=4, then go to y=4 at T=5, or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSuppose at T=3, I am on y=3 (safe).\n\nThen action at T=3: if I go U, to y=4 at T=4, but y=4 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, S, then at T=4, I am still on y=3.\n\ny=3 at T=4: is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at T=16-19, T=4 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I can go U to y=4 at T=5.\n\nNow at T=5, y=4: is it safe? y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14, so T=5 unsafe for y=4.\n\nOh, T=5 y=4 also unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at T=5, it is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\ny=4 unsafe from T=3 to 5 and 12 to 14.\n\nSo at T=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at T=3 on y=3, then at T=4 on y=3, then at T=4 I go U to y=4 at T=5, but y=4 at T=5 unsafe.\n\nIf at T=4 I stay on y=3, then at T=5 I go U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=4: safe? y=4 unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14. T=6 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, then I can proceed.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nIn direct path, to reach y=9 at T=9.\n\nBut with delay.\n\nStart: T=0, y=0, safe. Action: U to y=1 at T=1.\n\nT=1, y=1, safe. Action U to y=2 at T=2.\n\nT=2, y=2, safe. Action U to y=3 at T=3.\n\nT=3, y=3, safe. Now instead of U, I stay: action S, so at T=4, y=3 (since stayed).\n\ny=3 at T=4 safe.\n\nThen at T=4, action U to y=4 at T=5? But y=4 at T=5 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nAction at T=4: from y=3, I can go U to y=4 at T=5, but unsafe, or stay on y=3, or go down to y=2, but that might be worse.\n\nSince y=4 is unsafe at T=5, I need to go to y=4 at a different time.\n\ny=4 safe when T not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so for example T=6, as I thought.\n\nSo at T=4, on y=3, I stay: action S, so at T=5, y=3.\n\nT=5, y=3: safe, since not unsafe time.\n\nThen at T=5, action U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nT=6, y=4: safe, as T=6 not unsafe for y=4.\n\nThen from here, I can go up.\n\nBut at T=6, y=4, now go U to y=5 at T=7.\n\ny=5 at T=7: is safe? y=5 unsafe at T=0 and T=4, T=7 not, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at T=8.\n\ny=6 at T=8: unsafe? y=6 unsafe at T=0 and T=4, T=8 not, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at T=9.\n\ny=7 at T=9: unsafe? y=7 unsafe at T=0,4, T=9 not, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at T=10.\n\ny=8 at T=10: unsafe? y=8 unsafe at T=0,4, T=10 not, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, y=9 at T=11, reached.\n\nBut H? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart T=0 y=0.\n\nAfter actions, at turn T=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=10, actions a_0 to a_10, 11 actions, H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=0: action U, to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1: action U, to y=2 at T=2\n\nT=2: action U, to y=3 at T=3\n\nT=3: action S, stay, so y=4? No.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nIn terms of time:\n\nAt time T=0: position y_0=0\n\nAction a_0: say U, then y_1 = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt T=1: position y_1=1\n\nAction a_1: U, y_2=2\n\nT=2: y_2=2, a_2: U, y_3=3\n\nT=3: y_3=3, now a_3: instead of U, we do S, so y_4 = y_3 + 0 =3\n\nT=4: position y_4=3\n\nThen a_4: S, so y_5 =3 +0=3\n\nT=5: y_5=3, a_5: U, y_6=4\n\nT=6: y_6=4, a_6: U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: y_7=5, a_7: U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: y_8=6, a_8: U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y_9=7, a_9: U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y_10=8, a_10: U, y_11=9\n\nAt T=11, y_11=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end? We have actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions, but H is the minimal number such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 11 actions: a_0 to a_10, and y_{11}=9.\n\nBut we started at t_1=0, so turn t_1 + H -1 should be the last action? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1 + H -1? Or after the sequence.\n\nIt says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we should be at (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, after a_{t_1 + H -1}, position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nPosition at turn t is after previous actions.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, position at turn t_1 + k +1.\n\nAfter the last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=0, so after a_{H-1}, position at turn H is (0,9).\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 11, position y=9, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10, which is t from 0 to 10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? I took 11 turns to go from 0 to 9, with one stay, so y increased by 8 in 10 steps? From T=0 to T=11, 11 turns, but y from 0 to 9, with actions at 10 steps? Let's count the actions.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_10, 11 actions, each action corresponds to one turn of action.\n\nAfter 11 actions, we are at turn 11, y=9.\n\nMinimal possible is 9 actions to go directly, but we had to delay because of unsafe at T=4 y=4 and T=5 y=4 was also unsafe in the direct path, but in this path, I avoided by going to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFor example, instead of staying twice, maybe only once or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6,7,8 are only unsafe at T=0 and T=4, which are early, so for T>=5, they are safe except y=4 has later unsafe times, but I can go faster through higher rows.\n\nFor example, I could stay at the beginning or something.\n\nStart T=0 y=0.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for some turns, but that might not help.\n\nAction at T=0: if I go U to y=1 at T=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at T=1.\n\nI need to avoid y=4 at T=4 and T=5.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nSo I need to be on y=4 at T<=2 or T>=6 or T=11,12? But T=6 to 11 except 12-14 unsafe.\n\ny=4 safe at T=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,... etc. except 3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nBut at T=0, I am on y=0, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=4 only from T=2 onwards, since it takes time to reach.\n\nEarliest to be on y=4: if I go up directly, at T=4 y=4, but unsafe.\n\nAt T=3 y=4? If I go up faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so y increases at most one per turn.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=0, y=1 at T=1, y=2 at T=2, y=3 at T=3, y=4 at T=4 earliest.\n\nCannot be on y=4 before T=4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=2, y=2 max, etc.\n\nSo y=4 can be occupied from T=4 onwards.\n\nAt T=4, unsafe; T=5, unsafe; T=6, safe; etc.\n\nSo I must be on y=4 at T>=6.\n\nIn my previous path, I reached y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from there, I went up each turn to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut at higher rows, after T=4, all safe, so I can go up fast.\n\nIn my path: from T=6 y=4, to T=7 y=5, T=8 y=6, T=9 y=7, T=10 y=8, T=11 y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut can I reach y=4 earlier? No, because T=4 and T=5 are both unsafe, so earliest safe is T=6.\n\nBut T=6 is the earliest I can be on y=4 safely.\n\nThen to go to y=9, I need 5 more steps: to y=5 at T=7, y=6 T=8, y=7 T=9, y=8 T=10, y=9 T=11.\n\nSo minimum H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can be on y=4 later but go faster through higher rows, but since higher rows are safe after T=4, going faster doesn't help, I still need to spend at least one turn on each y from 4 to 8, but y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, from T=6 to T=11, 5 turns to increase 5 in y.\n\ny from 4 to 9, delta 5, so at least 5 actions if all up.\n\nIn this case, from y=4 at T=6 to y=9 at T=11, with 5 up actions.\n\nNow, to reach y=4 at T=6, from start.\n\nStart y=0 at T=0.\n\nTo y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut y=4 at T=6, which requires that at T=5, I was on y=3 or y=4 or y=5, but since I go up, probably on y=3.\n\nAt T=5, I need to be on y=3 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIn my path, I had at T=5 y=3.\n\nThen at T=5 action U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nNow, how to reach y=3 at T=5.\n\nFrom start, to y=3 at T=5.\n\nBut I can be on y=3 earlier.\n\nFor example, directly: at T=3 y=3.\n\nBut if I am at y=3 at T=3, I need to stay or something until T=5 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIn my earlier path, I stayed at y=3 for two turns: at T=3 and T=4, both on y=3, then at T=5 on y=3, then to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=4, I was on y=3, which is fine.\n\nCan I reduce the waiting?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=3 later, but no, because I need to reach y=4 at T=6, so y=3 at T=5.\n\nThe latest I can be on y=3 is T=5 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut I can be on y=3 as early as T=3.\n\nBut if I reach y=3 at T=3, I have to stay until T=5 to avoid going to y=4 during unsafe times.\n\nFrom T=3 to T=5, I need to be on y=3 for two turns if I stay.\n\nBut I could move to another row, but y=2 or y=4, but y=4 unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4, if I go to y=4, unsafe; if I go to y=2, but that is moving down, which might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=3 y=3, instead of staying, I go down to y=2 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4 y=2, which is safe, since y=2 unsafe only at T=16-19.\n\nThen at T=4, I can go up to y=3 at T=5, or to y=2, etc.\n\nBut then at T=5, if I go to y=3, then at T=6 to y=4.\n\nBut I was on y=2 at T=4, then to y=3 at T=5, then to y=4 at T=6.\n\nCompared to staying on y=3: if I stay on y=3 at T=3 and T=4, then at T=5 to y=3? At T=4 on y=3, then at T=4 action to go to y=4? No, we avoid.\n\nIn both cases, I reach y=3 at T=5 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIn the stay case: from T=3 to T=4 stay on y=3, then T=4 to T=5? At T=4 position y=3, action S, so y_5=3, position at T=5 y=3.\n\nThen action U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nIf I go down: at T=3 y=3, action D, so y_4=3-1=2, position at T=4 y=2.\n\nThen at T=4, action U to y=3, so y_5=2+1=3, position at T=5 y=3.\n\nThen same as above, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nSo I end up at same point, but with extra down and up, which cost actions, so worse.\n\nThus, staying is better.\n\nSo minimal way is to stay at y=3 for two turns: T=3 and T=4 both on y=3.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nIn terms of actions: to reach y=3 at T=3, which takes 3 up actions from start.\n\nThen two stay actions at T=3 and T=4? Actions at time.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t.\n\nTo have position at time T.\n\nAt T=0: y=0\n\na_0: U, to y=1 at T=1\n\na_1: U, to y=2 at T=2\n\na_2: U, to y=3 at T=3\n\nNow at T=3: position y=3, we need to stay, so a_3: S, so y_4 =3, position at T=4 y=3\n\nThen a_4: S, so y_5=3, position at T=5 y=3\n\nThen a_5: U, to y=4 at T=6\n\nPosition at T=6 y=4\n\nThen a_6: U, to y=5 at T=7\n\na_7: U, to y=6 at T=8\n\na_8: U, to y=7 at T=9\n\na_9: U, to y=8 at T=10\n\na_10: U, to y=9 at T=11\n\nSo actions: a_0:U, a_1:U, a_2:U, a_3:S, a_4:S, a_5:U, a_6:U, a_7:U, a_8:U, a_9:U, a_10:U\n\nH=11, since after a_{10}, position at T=11 y=9.\n\nBut a_{10} is the last action, at t=10, which is t_1 + 10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=10.\n\nBut can I reduce H?\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=4 earlier but safely, but I cannot, since T=4 and 5 unsafe.\n\nPerhaps at T=4, I can be on a different row.\n\nBut y=5 at T=4 is unsafe, since y=5 unsafe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 all unsafe at T=4.\n\ny=3 safe, but I am already there.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is safe at T=2, but I cannot be on y=4 at T=2, since at T=2 max y=2.\n\nT=1 y=1, T=2 y=2, T=3 y=3, T=4 y=4 earliest.\n\nNo earlier.\n\nPerhaps I can go to higher rows faster by not staying, but I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nMaybe for y=5,6,7,8, since they are safe after T=4, I can go through them quickly.\n\nBut in my path, from y=4 at T=6, I go up each turn to y=9 at T=11, which is 5 turns for 5 levels.\n\nI could be on y=4 later, but that would make H larger.\n\nFor example, if I stay more at lower levels, but that increases time.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose I go directly but skip y=4 at unsafe times by being on another row, but I have to be on y=4 at some point.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=4 at a safe time, which is not T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSince we are early, T=6 is fine.\n\nPerhaps at T=4, I am on y=3, safe, and instead of staying, I go up to y=4 at T=5, but T=5 y=4 unsafe, not possible.\n\nOr go down, but worse.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the best.\n\nBut in the freeway 4, there are unsafe times at T=12,13,14, but since I am going early, not a problem.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3, unsafe at T=16-19, late, not issue.\n\nNow, but in the path, when I am on y=3 at T=4 and T=5, is it safe? Yes.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, at T=6, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: cars.\n\nFirst car: at T=6, span [ -59 +4*6, -48 +4*6] = [ -59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: at T=6, [ -23 +24, -12 +24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAt T=7, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFirst car: [ -59 +12*7, -48 +84] = [ -59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], not 0.\n\nSecond car: [ -11 +84, 84] = [73,84], not 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAt T=4, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nCars: at T=4, span [ -59 +3*4, -48 +12] = [ -59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36], not 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my sequence, I have two stays at y=3.\n\nBut action a_3 and a_4 both S, so I stay at y=3 for two turns.\n\nThen at a_5 U to y=4.\n\nBut a_5 is at t=5, to y=4 at T=6.\n\nNow, is there a way with only one stay?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 at T=6, but reach y=3 at T=4 or something.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=3 at T=4.\n\nHow? If I go slower.\n\nFor example, at T=0 y=0, action S, stay at y=0, so at T=1 y=0.\n\nThen action U to y=1 at T=2? At T=1 position y=0, action U, y_2=1, position T=2 y=1.\n\nThen U to y=2 at T=3.\n\nU to y=3 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4 y=3.\n\nThen I need to go to y=4 at T=6, so at T=4 action? If I go U to y=4 at T=5, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at T=4: action S, so y_5=3, position T=5 y=3.\n\nThen action U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen same as before, but now I started with a stay, so I reached y=3 at T=4 instead of T=3, so later, then from T=6 y=4 to T=11 y=9, same, but I have an extra stay at beginning, so H larger.\n\nFor example, actions: a_0:S (y=0 at T=1), a_1:U (y=1 at T=2), a_2:U (y=2 at T=3), a_3:U (y=3 at T=4), a_4:S (y=3 at T=5), a_5:U (y=4 at T=6), then a_6 to a_10 U to y=5 to9 at T=7 to11.\n\nNow actions from a_0 to a_10, 11 actions, but reached at T=11 same, but I used a stay at T=0, so I have two stays, whereas in first path I had two stays at T=3 and T=4, but H same.\n\nIn first path, I had actions a_0 to a_10, 11 actions.\n\nIn this, also 11, but I reached y=3 later.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nIf I don't stay at beginning, I reach y=3 at T=3, then I need to stay until T=5 to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nSo from T=3 to T=5, I am on y=3 for three turns? Positions.\n\nAt T=3 y=3\n\nAction a_3:S, so y_4=3, position T=4 y=3\n\nAction a_4:S, so y_5=3, position T=5 y=3\n\nThen a_5:U, y_6=4, T=6 y=4\n\nSo at T=3,4,5 I am on y=3, three turns, but only two actions: a_3 and a_4 both S.\n\nThen one action to go to y=4.\n\nCompared to direct: to go from y=3 to y=4 takes one action if no delay.\n\nBut with delay, I take extra actions to stay.\n\nIn terms of time, to be at y=4 at T=6 requires that I was at y=3 at T=5, which requires being at lower rows earlier.\n\nMinimal time to y=3 is T=3, then I must wait until T=5 to leave for y=4, so arrive at y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=11.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly or something, but no, I have to go through each level.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can skip y=4 by going from y=3 to y=5? But no, I can only change y by ±1 or 0, so must go through intermediate levels.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the action sequence.\n\nt_1=0.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_0 = U  (to y=1 at next turn)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_1 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_2 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_3 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +4: a_4 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +5: a_5 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn t_1 +10: a_10 = U\n\nAfter a_10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut t_1 is given as 0, so turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1 = 0 to 10.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at T=6, but can I reach higher faster?\n\nFor example, after y=4 at T=6, I go up to y=5 at T=7, etc., as before.\n\nBut y=5 at T=7 is fine.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are safe after T=4, I could reach them earlier if possible, but I need to be on y=4 first.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be on y=5 at a time when it is safe, but to be on y=5, I need to come from y=4 or y=6.\n\nEarliest at T=5 y=5, but y=5 at T=5: is it safe? y=5 unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, T=5 safe.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=5, I need to be on y=4 at T=4 or y=5 at T=4 or y=6 at T=4, but y=4 at T=4 unsafe, y=5 at T=4 unsafe, y=6 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be on y=5 at T=5 directly because to get there, I must have been on adjacent at T=4, all unsafe or not possible.\n\nFor example, to be at y=5 at T=5, I must have been at y=4, y=5, or y=6 at T=4.\n\nIf at y=4 at T=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at y=5 at T=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at y=6 at T=4, but y=6 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nAnd I cannot be at y=6 at T=4 because earliest y=6 at T=6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=5 unsafe anyway.\n\nSo no, cannot.\n\nThus, the path I have is minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 5,6,7,8, they are unsafe only at T=0 and T=4, which we avoid.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=5 at T=7, safe.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something: in freeway 4, there is a car at T=12,13,14 unsafe, but since I pass early, no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo H=11 should be fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can save a turn.\n\nSuppose I go to y=3 at T=3, then at T=3, I go up to y=4 at T=4, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nOr, at T=2, I am on y=2, I could stay or something.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4 eventually.\n\nSince y=4 is the bottleneck, and I must pass it at T>=6, and then to y=9 takes 5 more turns, total from start 6 turns to y=4, plus 5 to y=9, but to reach y=4 at T=6, I need 6 turns from start (since y=0 to y=4 in 4 actions, but with delays).\n\nIn time: at T=0 y=0, after k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nTo have y_k =4 at turn k.\n\nEarliest possible k=4 with all up.\n\nBut y=4 at T=4 unsafe, T=5 unsafe, so earliest safe k=6.\n\nThen y_6=4.\n\nThen from there, y_7=5, ..., y_11=9, so at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nThe sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there was a car (24,13,right,4), which I thought always safe, but let me confirm at T=6: [13+4*6,24+4*6]=[13+24,24+24]=[37,48], yes safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5, at T=0, there is a car (0,-11,right,12), so at T=0, span [-11,0], so 0 included, unsafe, but I am not on freeway 5 at T=0, I am on y=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the turn labels: since t_1=0, it should be Turn t_1: U, Turn t_1+1: U, etc.\n\nIn the format.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can have fewer actions by combining.\n\nSuppose at some point I go down, but that would increase H, so no.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=4 at T=6, but from y=3 at T=5, I could go directly, no down.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the car positions and their movements must be analyzed to determine safe times for the player to occupy each freeway row. The cars' positions at turn \\(T\\) are derived from their initial state at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) using the update rules:\n\n- For a right-moving car with initial span \\([ \\tau, h ]\\) and speed \\(s\\), the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([ \\tau + sT, h + sT ]\\).\n\nCollision occurs at turn \\(T\\) on freeway \\(k\\) if the player is on row \\(k\\) (i.e., \\(y_T = k\\)) and \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway row are calculated as follows:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: One car with initial span \\([-59, -48]\\), speed 3. Unsafe when \\(0 \\in [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T]\\), which occurs for \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Same as freeway 1, unsafe at \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Same as freeway 1, unsafe at \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Three cars:\n  - Car 1: initial span \\([-59, -48]\\), speed 4. Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n  - Car 2: initial span \\([-23, -12]\\), speed 4. Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\).\n  - Car 3: initial span \\([13, 24]\\), speed 4. Always safe since \\(13 + 4T > 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 0\\).\n  - Freeway 4 unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Two cars:\n  - Car 1: initial span \\([-59, -48]\\), speed 12. Unsafe at \\(T = 4\\).\n  - Car 2: initial span \\([-11, 0]\\), speed 12. Unsafe at \\(T = 0\\).\n  - Freeway 5 unsafe at \\(T = 0, 4\\).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Same as freeway 5, unsafe at \\(T = 0, 4\\).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Same as freeway 5, unsafe at \\(T = 0, 4\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Same as freeway 5, unsafe at \\(T = 0, 4\\).\n\nRows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\nThe player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(0\\). To minimize the number of turns \\(H\\), the player should move up (\\(U\\)) whenever possible, but must avoid being on an unsafe row at an unsafe time. The direct path moving up every turn would reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(9\\), but this causes a collision at turn \\(4\\) on \\(y = 4\\) (unsafe at \\(T = 4\\)).\n\nThe bottleneck is row \\(y = 4\\), which is unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\). The earliest safe time to be on \\(y = 4\\) is \\(T = 6\\). To achieve this:\n- Reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(3\\) via actions \\(U\\) at turns \\(0\\), \\(1\\), and \\(2\\).\n- Stay on \\(y = 3\\) for turns \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) (actions \\(S\\)) to avoid moving to \\(y = 4\\) during unsafe turns \\(4\\) and \\(5\\).\n- Move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(6\\) with action \\(U\\) at turn \\(5\\).\n- From \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(6\\), move up every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(11\\).\n\nThis path has \\(H = 11\\) turns, with the sequence of actions:\n\n- Turn \\(0\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 1\\) at turn \\(1\\))\n- Turn \\(1\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 2\\) at turn \\(2\\))\n- Turn \\(2\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(3\\))\n- Turn \\(3\\): \\(S\\) (stay on \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(4\\))\n- Turn \\(4\\): \\(S\\) (stay on \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(5\\))\n- Turn \\(5\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(6\\))\n- Turn \\(6\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 5\\) at turn \\(7\\))\n- Turn \\(7\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(8\\))\n- Turn \\(8\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(9\\))\n- Turn \\(9\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(10\\))\n- Turn \\(10\\): \\(U\\) (to \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(11\\))\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions:\n- At turn \\(4\\), on \\(y = 3\\): safe (unsafe times for \\(y = 3\\) are \\(T = 16-19\\)).\n- At turn \\(5\\), on \\(y = 3\\): safe.\n- At turn \\(6\\), on \\(y = 4\\): safe (unsafe times \\(T = 3,4,5,12,13,14\\); \\(T = 6\\) safe).\n- Turns \\(7\\) to \\(10\\): on \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\), all safe after \\(T = 4\\).\n\nNo shorter path is possible, as \\(y = 4\\) cannot be occupied safely before turn \\(6\\), and reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 11 turns from the start.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,1) at turn t1 = 1 (which is the current turn). We must reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8 (each row from 1 to 8 has cars). We start at y=1 and need to get to y=9 (which is safe, no cars).\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When moving, at turn T we are on freeway y_T. If we move at turn T (by U or D) to y_{T+1}, then at turn T we are still on y_T. Only at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo, for each turn T, we check: \n  - The player's y-coordinate at T (which we denote as y_T) must not be in [1,8]? Actually, if y_T is in [1,8], then we must check the cars on that freeway (row) at turn T.\n\nBut note: if we are at y_T = 0 or y_T = 9, then no collision check (because there are no cars at y=0 and y=9).\n\nOur current state: at turn 1 (t1=1), we are at (0,1). So we are on freeway 1 at turn 1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=1.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at future turns. Since the cars move at constant speed, we can compute their head and tail at any turn T (relative to turn 1) as:\n\nFor a car at turn 1: \n  - If left-moving (d = left): \n        head(T) = h1 - s*(T-1)\n        tail(T) = tau1 - s*(T-1)\n    and the span is [min(head, tail), max(head, tail)]? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \n        at turn 1: [h, tau] -> then at turn T: [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)]\n    and note that for left-moving, the head is at the left (smaller x) and tail at the right? But the problem states the span as [h, tau] for left-moving? Actually, the representation is:\n\n    For left-moving: the car is moving to the left, so the entire car shifts left. The span at turn 1 is [h, tau] (with h and tau being the head and tail at turn 1). Then at turn T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\n    Similarly, for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem uses the term \"head\" and \"tail\". In the left-moving car, the head is the front (which is the leftmost part) and the tail is the rear (rightmost). So at turn 1, the car occupies [h, tau] meaning from h to tau, but since the car is moving left, h < tau? Actually, the problem gives negative numbers for left-moving? Let me check the data.\n\nLooking at the data: \n  For freeway 1: (-45, -56, right, 3) -> but note: the direction is right. So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which will be the rightmost part) and tail the rear? \n\nHowever, the problem says for right-moving: \n    Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo in the data, for freeway 1: head = -45, tail = -56. But if the car is right-moving, then the span at turn 1 is [tau, h] = [-56, -45]. So the car covers from -56 to -45? That is 12 units? But note: the length of the car is |h - tau| + 1? Actually, the span is inclusive? \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the length, but we know the car occupies integer positions. So the car at freeway 1 at turn 1: \n    positions: from -56 to -45 (inclusive) because it's right-moving: [tau, h] = [-56, -45] -> meaning the car covers x from -56 to -45.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if we had one, the span would be [h, tau] and then we shift left.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (i.e., 0 is between the head and tail of the car at that turn, inclusive), then collision.\n\nWe start at turn 1 at (0,1). We must check freeway 1 at turn 1: \n    freeway 1 has one car: right-moving, span at turn1: [-56, -45]. Does 0 fall in [-56, -45]? No, because -45 is less than 0? Actually, -56 to -45 are all negative, so 0 is not in that interval. So safe.\n\nBut note: we are at (0,1) at turn 1, so we are on freeway 1. The car on freeway 1 at turn 1 does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move from y=1 to y=9.\n\nWe can move up (U: y increases by 1), down (D: y decreases by 1), or stay (S: y stays). But note: we are bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe want minimal H (number of turns) so that at turn (1 + H - 1) we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=1 and need to get to y=9, the minimal number of moves without any cars would be 8 moves (each U) in 8 turns: \n    Turn1: at y1=1 -> then we do U at turn1, then at turn2 we are at y2=2, ... at turn8 we are at y8=8, then at turn9 we do U and become y9=9? But wait, we are at turn9: we started at turn1, so after H turns we have done H actions? \n\nActually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1? The problem says: \n    sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo at turn t1 (which is turn1) we take the first action a1. Then at turn t1+1 (turn2) we take a2, ... until turn t1+H-1 (which is turn1+H-1). And we require that at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\nBut note: the state at turn t1 (before any action) is given. Then we take an action at turn t1, which updates the state to turn t1+1? Actually, the update:\n\n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t (we are at y_t), then we choose a_t, which determines Delta y_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is (x_t, y_t). We are at turn t1: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1).\n\nWe then choose a_{t1} (which is the action at turn t1). This will lead to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which produces y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \n    \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut note: the actions are taken from t1 to t1+H-1 (so H actions). The state at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,1). Then:\n\n    Turn t1: apply a_{t1} -> then we are at state (0, y_{t1+1}) at the beginning of turn t1+1? \n\nActually, the state after an action at turn t is the state at the next turn. So:\n\n    At turn t1: we are at (0,1). We choose a_{t1}. Then we move to (0, y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n\n    Then at turn t1+1: we choose a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\n    We want that at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn we take an action), after we take that action, we become at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nWait, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me check: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: \n    t=0: action at turn t1+0 = t1 -> leads to state at turn t1+1\n    t=1: action at turn t1+1 -> leads to state at turn t1+2\n    ...\n    t=H-1: action at turn t1+H-1 -> leads to state at turn t1+H\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be the state at turn t1+H-1, which is before the last action? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then it says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nLet me index:\n\n    Turn t1: initial state: (0,1) -> then we take a_{t1} -> then we get state at turn t1+1: (0, y_{t1+1})\n\n    Turn t1+1: we take a_{t1+1} -> then state at turn t1+2: (0, y_{t1+2})\n\n    ...\n\n    After H actions: we have taken a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} (so H actions) and we are at state at turn t1+H: (0, y_{t1+H})\n\nBut the problem requires: y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis implies that we require the state at turn t1+H-1 (which is after H-1 actions) to be 9? \n\nBut then the last action is at turn t1+H-1? And that action would be taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we get the state at turn t1+H, but we don't care about that? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H? Actually, no: the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? \n\nThe problem does not specify, but typically the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action and then update to the next state at turn t+1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... at turn T\". So at the beginning of turn T, we are at (0, y_T). Then we choose an action and then we move to (0, y_{T+1}) at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}? But that would move us to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta, which might be 10? That would be invalid because y must be in [0,9]. \n\nAlternatively, we might not take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. \n\nThis is ambiguous. \n\nLooking at the answer format: \n    Turn t1: a_{t1}\n    Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n    ...\n    Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last action) we are at (0,9)? \n\nBut note: the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. \n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that would change the y-coordinate. \n\nUnless the action is S (stay). Then y_{t1+H} = 9. \n\nBut the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? And then we are at turn t1+H. But we don't require to be at 9 at turn t1+H? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\"\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo the minimal H such that after H-1 actions we are at y=9? \n\nBut then we have taken H actions? \n\nWait: \n    We start at turn t1: state (0,1). \n    Then we take action a_{t1} (first action) -> we get state at turn t1+1: (0, y_{t1+1})\n    ...\n    After k actions, we are at turn t1+k: (0, y_{t1+k})\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1 (so after (H-1) actions) we are at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, the number of actions is H (from t1 to t1+H-1: H actions) but the state we care about is at turn t1+H-1 (which is after H-1 actions). \n\nThis implies that the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1? But then that action would be taken at a state that is already (0,9). \n\nSo we require that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? But the action at turn t1+H-1 is the last one in the sequence, and it is taken when we are at (0,9). \n\nWhat action do we take then? It doesn't matter? But we must avoid collision at turn t1+H-1: we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 -> no collision (because y=9 has no cars). Then we take an action (say S) and then we move to (0,9) again? Or we might move to 8 or 10? \n\nBut we are required to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H: which might not be 9? \n\nThis doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there might be an off-by-one. Let me check the example: \n\n    Suppose we start at (0,1) at turn1. \n    We want to get to (0,9). \n\n    If we do 8 consecutive U actions:\n\n        Turn1: U -> then at turn2: y=2\n        Turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n        ...\n        Turn8: U -> turn9: y=9\n\n    So at the beginning of turn9, we are at y=9. \n\n    How many actions? 8 actions: from turn1 to turn8. \n\n    Then H=8? \n\n    Then the sequence is for t=0 to H-1=7: \n        t=0: turn1 -> a1\n        t=1: turn2 -> a2\n        ...\n        t=7: turn8 -> a8\n\n    And we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 1+8-1 = 8, we are at y8=9? \n\n    But in our plan, at the beginning of turn8 we are at y8=8 (because after 7 actions: from turn1 to turn7: we did 7 U's -> then at turn8 we are at 8). Then at turn8 we do U -> then at turn9 we are at 9. \n\n    So we are at y=9 at turn9, not at turn8.\n\n    Therefore, to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we would need to be at 9 at turn8? That would require only 7 actions? \n\n    How? \n\n        Turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n        Turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n        ...\n        Turn7: U -> turn8: y=8+1=9? \n\n    That is 7 U's: so we start at y1=1, then after 7 U's we are at y8=1+7=8? \n\n    Actually: \n        y_{t1+1} = y1 + a1 = 1+1=2\n        y_{t1+2}=2+1=3\n        ...\n        y_{t1+7}=7+1=8? \n\n    We never get to 9 in 7 actions.\n\n    Alternatively, we do 8 actions to get to 9 at turn9.\n\n    Therefore, the requirement should be that at turn t1+H we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1 (so we take H actions) and that action is taken at a state that is already at 9? \n\nBut then we don't need to move? So we would take an action at turn t1+H-1 that is S (so we stay at 9). \n\nBut note: we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we are safe (no cars at 9). Then we take S and remain at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nSo the minimal H would be the number of turns from start until we are at 9, and then we take one additional S? \n\nBut that doesn't minimize H: we want minimal H. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H-1 actions and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut then the last action is at turn t1+H-2? \n\nI think the indexing is: \n    The sequence of actions is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 -> total H actions.\n    The state after these actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me look at the problem again: \n    \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis is inconsistent. \n\nAfter reading carefully: \n    The player update: at turn t, we are at state (x_t, y_t). We take action a_t, and then we get:\n        y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n    So the state at turn t+1 is determined by the action at turn t.\n\n    We start at turn t1: state (0, y_{t1})= (0,1).\n\n    We take action a_{t1} at turn t1, leading to state at turn t1+1: (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\n    We take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, leading to state at turn t1+2.\n\n    ...\n\n    We take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, leading to state at turn t1+H.\n\n    But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n    This means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\n    Then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action (which is the last action in the sequence) and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta.\n\n    But we don't care about y_{t1+H}? \n\n    And the collision avoidance: at each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, we must not collide. \n\n    At turn t1+H-1: we are at y=9 -> safe. Then we take an action -> then we are at turn t1+H: but we don't require to be at 9 at turn t1+H, so we might go to 8 or 10? But 10 is invalid, so we must choose S or D? \n\n    However, the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, not at turn t1+H.\n\n    This seems odd.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem actually means that we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H (i.e., after H actions). This is the typical interpretation. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me see the provided example: the current state is at turn1. And we are to output actions for turn1, turn2, etc.\n\nAnd the answer format says: \n    Turn t1: a_{t1}\n    Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n    ...\n    Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo we output H actions, for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after the last action (at turn t1+H) should be 9? But the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAnother possibility: the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9, and then we do not take any action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes an action for turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Given the answer format and the typical interpretation, I believe the intended meaning is that after the sequence of H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me calculate with the minimal path without cars: \n    We start at y1=1.\n    We want to get to y=9.\n    The minimal number of U actions is 8.\n    Then after 8 U actions: \n        turn1: U -> y2=2\n        turn2: U -> y3=3\n        ...\n        turn8: U -> y9=9\n\n    So at turn9 (which is t1+8), we are at 9.\n\n    Therefore, H should be 8? \n\n    Then the sequence has 8 actions: for turns1 to 8.\n\n    And the requirement should be y_{t1+8}=9.\n\n    But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> y_{1+8-1}=y8=9? But in our plan, at turn8 we are at y8=8, not 9.\n\n    So to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we would need to be at 9 at turn8, which would require 7 U's: then y8=1+7=8? -> not 9.\n\n    It's impossible to be at 9 at turn8 if we start at 1 at turn1 with 7 actions: because 1+7=8.\n\n    Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem means that after H actions, we are at turn t1+H with y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n    And then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem has a typo and it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible to reach 9 in any H because we start at 1 and each action can only change by at most 1.\n\nBut note: we start at turn1 at y1=1. The requirement is for y_{t1+H-1}=9. If H=8, then we require y_{1+8-1}=y8=9. How many actions have we taken by turn8? We have taken 7 actions (at turns1 to 7). Then we are at y8=1+7=8? not 9.\n\nIf we do 8 actions: then we are at y9=1+8=9. So we are at 9 at turn9. But then the condition y_{t1+H-1}=y_{1+8-1}=y8=8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the typical interpretation: we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, which means after H actions (taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1) we have moved to y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd the collision avoidance: for each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, we are at y_T (which is between 0 and 9) and if y_T is in [1,8] then we must ensure that at turn T, no car on freeway y_T has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe do not care about turn t1+H because at turn t1+H we are at y=9 and there are no cars.\n\nSo in the example without cars, we would do:\n\n    Turn1: U -> then at turn2: y=2 (and at turn1 we were at y=1: safe if no car at turn1 on freeway1 covers 0)\n    Turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n    ...\n    Turn8: U -> then at turn9: y=9.\n\n    So H=8 actions.\n\n    The sequence: \n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        ...\n        Turn8: U\n\n    And we require that at each turn from 1 to 8, when we are at freeway y, the car on that freeway at that turn does not cover 0.\n\nBut in our case, at turn1 we are at freeway1: we already checked that at turn1, freeway1's car does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nNow, we need to compute for future turns.\n\nWe are at turn1: y=1.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn1.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, we can compute the span at any turn T.\n\nLet T be the turn number (absolute turn, starting at 1).\n\nFor a car on freeway i, given at turn1: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s)\n\nThen at turn T, the span is:\n    if d == right: \n        new_head = h + s*(T-1)   [because at turn1: head = h, then at turn2: head = h+s, etc.]\n        new_tail = tau + s*(T-1)\n        span = [new_tail, new_head]   -> but wait, the problem says for right-moving: span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n    But note: in the data, for a right-moving car, at turn1, the span is [tau, h]. So for freeway1: tau=-56, h=-45, so the car occupies from -56 to -45.\n\n    At turn T, it occupies [ -56 + s*(T-1), -45 + s*(T-1) ].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [ h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1) ].\n\nWe need to know if at a particular turn T, on freeway y_T, the car(s) on that freeway have a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: a freeway may have multiple cars. We must avoid any of them covering 0 at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe start at turn1: freeway1 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn2: we will be at freeway2? Not necessarily. We might stay on freeway1 or move to freeway0 or freeway2.\n\nBut we start at freeway1. At turn1, we take an action. If we go up, then at turn2 we are at freeway2. If we go down, at turn2 we are at freeway0 (which is safe, no cars). If we stay, then at turn2 we are at freeway1.\n\nSo we must plan the path and the actions to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal path in terms of vertical moves is 8 steps up. But we may have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid cars.\n\nWe need to find the minimal H such that there is a sequence of actions of length H (which will move us to y=9 at turn1+H) and for every turn T in [1, 1+H-1] (the turns we are on the grid), if y_T is in [1,8], then at turn T, no car on freeway y_T covers 0.\n\nNote: at turn T, we are at freeway y_T. This y_T is the one we are at the beginning of turn T.\n\nWe are given y1=1.\n\nThen after action at turn1, we get y2.\n\nWe need to compute the car positions at turn T for each freeway.\n\nLet's list the freeways and their cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-45, -56, right, 3) -> at turn T: [ -56 + 3*(T-1), -45 + 3*(T-1) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same: (-45, -56, right, 3) -> [ -56 + 3*(T-1), -45 + 3*(T-1) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same: (-45, -56, right, 3) -> [ -56 + 3*(T-1), -45 + 3*(T-1) ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: \n    car1: (-44, -55, right, 4) -> [ -55 + 4*(T-1), -44 + 4*(T-1) ]\n    car2: (-8, -19, right, 4) -> [ -19 + 4*(T-1), -8 + 4*(T-1) ]\n    car3: (28, 17, right, 4) -> wait, head=28, tail=17? but for right-moving, the span at turn1 is [tau, head] = [17, 28]?

We must reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path without waiting would be:\n\n    Turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n    Turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n    Turn3: U -> turn4: y=4\n    Turn4: U -> turn5: y=5\n    Turn5: U -> turn6: y=6\n    Turn6: U -> turn7: y=7\n    Turn7: U -> turn8: y=8\n    Turn8: U -> turn9: y=9\n\nNow, check safety at each turn:\n\n    Turn1: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (T=1 safe)\n    Turn2: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (T=2 safe)\n    Turn3: y=3 -> freeway3: safe? freeway3 is unsafe only at T in [16,19] -> T=3 is safe? \n            But wait, freeway3: we see above that freeway3 is unsafe at T=16,17,18,19 -> T=3 is safe.\n            However, we have freeway4 at T=3 is unsafe, but we are on freeway3, not freeway4.\n\n    Turn4: y=4 -> freeway4: at T=4, freeway4 is unsafe! (because T=4 is in {3,4,5,12,13,14}? no, wait: freeway4 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. So T=4: unsafe.\n\nSo we collide at turn4.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway4 at turn4.\n\nWe could:\n    - Stay at freeway3 at turn4? \n    - Or move to freeway5? \n    - Or even move down to freeway2?\n\nBut note: at turn3, we are at freeway3 (if we did U at turn1 and turn2). Then at turn3, we can choose to not go to freeway4 at turn4.\n\nOptions at turn3 (when we are at y=3):\n    - U: then at turn4 we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at T=4: unsafe.\n    - D: then at turn4 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at T=4: freeway2 is unsafe only at T>=16, so T=4 is safe.\n    - S: then at turn4 we are at y=3 -> freeway3 at T=4: safe (since freeway3 unsafe only at T>=16).\n\nSo we can do:\n\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n    Turn3: S or D\n\nBut we want minimal H. If we do S at turn3, then at turn4 we are still at y=3. Then we can do U at turn4 to go to y=4 at turn5.\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn5: T=5 -> unsafe (because freeway4 is unsafe at T=5).\n\nSo we cannot go to freeway4 at turn5 either.\n\nIf we do D at turn3: then at turn4 we are at y=2. Then we can do U at turn4 to go to y=3 at turn5, and then U at turn5 to go to y=4 at turn6.\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn6: T=6 -> safe.\n\nSo one possible path:\n\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2 (safe: freeway2 at T=2 safe)\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3 (safe: freeway3 at T=3 safe)\n    Turn3: D -> y4=2 (safe: freeway2 at T=4 safe? freeway2 unsafe only at T>=16 -> safe)\n    Turn4: U -> y5=3 (freeway3 at T=5: safe)\n    Turn5: U -> y6=4 (freeway4 at T=6: safe)\n    Turn6: U -> y7=5 (freeway5 at T=6: safe)\n    Turn7: U -> y8=6 (freeway6 at T=7: safe? freeway6 unsafe only at T=4 -> safe)\n    Turn8: U -> y9=7\n    Turn9: U -> y10=8\n    Turn10: U -> y11=9\n\nBut we are at y11=9 at turn11. Then we have taken 10 actions.\n\nBut we can do better? \n\nAlternatively, after turn3 we do S:\n\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n    Turn3: S -> y4=3 (freeway3 at T=4: safe)\n    Now, at turn4 we are at y=3. Then we want to go to y=4. But freeway4 at turn5 (if we do U at turn4) is unsafe (T=5: freeway4 unsafe). \n    So we cannot go at turn5 to freeway4.\n\n    We could wait again at turn4: \n        Turn4: S -> y5=3 (freeway3 at T=5: safe)\n        Turn5: U -> y6=4 (freeway4 at T=6: safe)\n\n    Then:\n        Turn6: U -> y7=5 (freeway5 at T=7: safe)\n        Turn7: U -> y8=6\n        Turn8: U -> y9=7\n        Turn9: U -> y10=8\n        Turn10: U -> y11=9\n\n    This is 10 actions as well.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster.\n\nAnother idea: avoid freeway4 at turn4 and turn5 by going up earlier? We start at turn1.\n\nWe could do:\n\n    Turn1: S (stay at y=1) -> then at turn2 we are still at y=1.\n        Check: at turn2: freeway1 at T=2: [ -56+3= -53, -45+3=-42] -> safe.\n\n    Then at turn2: U -> y3=2\n    Turn3: U -> y4=3\n    Turn4: U -> y5=4 (freeway4 at T=5: unsafe) -> not safe.\n\n    So that doesn't help.\n\nWe could go up to y=4 earlier? \n\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n    Turn3: U -> y4=4 (at turn4: freeway4 at T=4: unsafe) -> not safe.\n\nWe must not be on freeway4 at turns 3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nWe are going to be on freeway4 only once if we go straight, but we can adjust the timing.\n\nWe need to be on freeway4 at a safe turn: T not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}. The safe turns for freeway4: T=1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,16,... but freeway4 is unsafe at T=16? no, freeway4 unsafe only at T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}. So T=6,7,8,9,10,11,15 are safe.\n\nWe want to minimize the total turns. We need to get to freeway4 at one of these safe turns.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid freeway5,6,7,8 at T=4.\n\nBut note: we only go through each freeway once if we go up without backtracking, but we might have to wait or backtrack.\n\nMinimal steps without waiting is 8. If we wait or backtrack, we take more.\n\nBut we might be able to get to freeway4 at a safe turn without adding too many steps.\n\nWe start at turn1 at y=1.\n\nWe need to be at y=4 at a turn T that is safe for freeway4.\n\nThe safe T for freeway4: T in {1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,...}\n\nBut we cannot be at y=4 at turn1 or turn2 because we start at y=1 and we need at least 3 ups to get to y=4: \n    After 3 actions: at turn4 we are at y=4? \n        Turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n        Turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n        Turn3: U -> turn4: y=4 -> T=4: unsafe.\n\n    After 4 actions: \n        We can be at y=4 at turn5: if we do three U's and then one S? \n            Turn1: U -> y2=2\n            Turn2: U -> y3=3\n            Turn3: U -> y4=4 (but this is at turn4, not turn5) -> we are at y=4 at turn4.\n        How to be at y=4 at turn5? \n            We can be at y=4 at turn5 by:\n                Option1: \n                    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n                    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n                    Turn3: S -> y4=3\n                    Turn4: U -> y5=4\n                Option2:\n                    Turn1: S -> y2=1\n                    Turn2: U -> y3=2\n                    Turn3: U -> y4=3\n                    Turn4: U -> y5=4\n\n        So at turn5: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=5: unsafe.\n\n    After 5 actions: \n        We can be at y=4 at turn6: \n            Example: \n                Turn1: U -> y2=2\n                Turn2: U -> y3=3\n                Turn3: S -> y4=3\n                Turn4: S -> y5=3\n                Turn5: U -> y6=4   -> T=6: safe.\n\n        Or without waiting twice:\n                Turn1: U -> y2=2\n                Turn2: U -> y3=3\n                Turn3: D -> y4=2\n                Turn4: U -> y5=3\n                Turn5: U -> y6=4   -> T=6: safe.\n\n        Or:\n                Turn1: S -> y2=1\n                Turn2: U -> y3=2\n                Turn3: U -> y4=3\n                Turn4: S -> y5=3\n                Turn5: U -> y6=4\n\n        All of these take 5 actions to get to y=4 at turn6.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9: which is 5 more U's -> 5 actions, so total actions = 5 (to get to y=4) + 5 (to get to y=9) = 10.\n\nBut we already had a path with 10 actions.\n\nCan we get to freeway4 earlier? The next safe turn after 2 is 6. We cannot get to freeway4 at turn1 or turn2 because we start at y=1 and we need 3 moves to get to y=4, which takes at least 3 actions -> the earliest we can be at y=4 is turn4 (which is unsafe), then next is turn5 (by adding one wait: then we are at turn5, which is unsafe), then turn6 (by adding two waits or a backtrack) -> turn6 is safe.\n\nSo minimal we can be at freeway4 at turn6.\n\nThen we do:\n\n    Actions to get to y=4 at turn6: 5 actions (as above).\n\n    Then from y=4 at turn6, we do U at turn6: y7=5 (freeway5 at T=7: safe)\n    U at turn7: y8=6 (freeway6 at T=8: safe)\n    U at turn8: y9=7 (freeway7 at T=9: safe)\n    U at turn9: y10=8 (freeway8 at T=10: safe)\n    U at turn10: y11=9\n\n    Total actions: 10.\n\nBut we start at turn1 and do 10 actions: from turn1 to turn10.\n\nThen at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: we require that at the last action (at turn10) we move to y=9 at turn11.\n\nAnd we require that at each turn from 1 to 10 (the turns we take actions) we are safe.\n\nLet me write the sequence for one of the 5-action ways to get to y=4 at turn6:\n\nOption A (with two waits at y=3):\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2 (safe: freeway2 at T=2 safe)\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3 (safe: freeway3 at T=3 safe)\n    Turn3: S -> y4=3 (safe: freeway3 at T=4 safe)\n    Turn4: S -> y5=3 (safe: freeway3 at T=5 safe)\n    Turn5: U -> y6=4 (safe: freeway4 at T=6 safe)\n    Turn6: U -> y7=5 (freeway5 at T=7: safe)\n    Turn7: U -> y8=6 (freeway6 at T=8: safe)\n    Turn8: U -> y9=7 (freeway7 at T=9: safe)\n    Turn9: U -> y10=8 (freeway8 at T=10: safe)\n    Turn10: U -> y11=9\n\nTotal 10 actions.\n\nOption B (with backtracking):\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n    Turn3: D -> y4=2 (freeway2 at T=4: safe)\n    Turn4: U -> y5=3 (freeway3 at T=5: safe)\n    Turn5: U -> y6=4 (freeway4 at T=6: safe)\n    Then same as above: \n    Turn6: U -> y7=5\n    Turn7: U -> y8=6\n    Turn8: U -> y9=7\n    Turn9: U -> y10=8\n    Turn10: U -> y11=9\n\nAlso 10 actions.\n\nBut can we do it in 9 actions?\n\nWe must be at y=4 at a safe turn: the only safe turns before 12 are 6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=4 is turn4 (unsafe), then turn5 (unsafe), then turn6 (safe).\n\nTo be at y=4 at turn6, we need to have spent 5 actions (as above).\n\nThen we need 5 more actions to get to y=9: \n    from y=4 at turn6, we do 5 U's: \n        turn6: U -> y7=5 at turn7\n        turn7: U -> y8=6 at turn8\n        turn8: U -> y9=7 at turn9\n        turn9: U -> y10=8 at turn10\n        turn10: U -> y11=9 at turn11\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn11, after 10 actions.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn1+H, and we did 10 actions, so H=10.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=4 at turn6 and then only use 4 more actions? That would require getting from y=4 to y=9 in 4 actions: that's 5 steps (y4->y5->y6->y7->y8->y9) -> 5 steps, so 5 actions.\n\nWe need at least 5 actions from y=4 to y=9.\n\nAlternatively, we might skip freeway4 by going from y=3 to y=5 in two actions? But we can only move one step per action.\n\nSo minimal is 10 actions.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path that goes through freeway4 at a later safe turn but with fewer total actions? For example, if we go very fast to a high freeway and then wait, but then we have to go through freeway4 eventually? Actually, we don't have to go through freeway4 if we go from y=3 to y=5? But we must go through y=4.\n\nUnless we go from y=3 to y=4 to y=5, but that requires two actions and we are at freeway4 for one turn.\n\nBut we can avoid freeway4 at unsafe times by being there at a safe time.\n\nWe have to go through freeway4 at some turn T that is safe. The earliest safe turn for freeway4 is T=6.\n\nSo we cannot avoid spending at least 5 actions to get to freeway4 at turn6.\n\nThen 5 actions to get to y=9: total 10.\n\nBut is there a way to get to freeway4 at turn6 in fewer than 5 actions? \n\nTo get to y=4 at turn6, we start at y=1 at turn1.\n\nThe moves:\n\n    We need to cover 3 net up moves.\n\n    The number of actions is at least 3, but we also have to account for the turns: we must be at y=4 at turn6.\n\n    The total displacement is +3.\n\n    The minimal number of actions for displacement +3 is 3, but then we would be at y=4 at turn4, not turn6.\n\n    To be at turn6, we need to spend 2 extra turns: either by waiting or by moving down and then up.\n\n    That requires 2 extra actions.\n\n    So minimal 5 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, we must also avoid freeway5,6,7,8 at T=4. But in our path, we are at freeway5 at turn7 (T=7), which is safe. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut what about the other unsafe turns? For example, freeway4 is unsafe at T=12,13,14. We are at freeway4 at turn6, which is safe.\n\nAnd freeway1,2,3 are unsafe at T>=16. We are at freeway1 at turn1, freeway2 at turn2, freeway3 at turn3 and also at turn4 (in the backtracking path we are at freeway3 at turn5? no, in the backtracking path: \n    turn1: y1=1 -> freeway1\n    turn2: y2=2 -> freeway2\n    turn3: y3=3 -> freeway3\n    turn4: y4=2 -> freeway2\n    turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3\n    turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4\n\nSo at turn4 we are at freeway2, which is safe at T=4. At turn5 we are at freeway3, which is safe at T=5.\n\nIn the waiting path:\n    turn1: freeway1\n    turn2: freeway2\n    turn3: freeway3\n    turn4: freeway3\n    turn5: freeway3\n    turn6: freeway4\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, we also need to check the later freeways:\n\n    freeway5: we are at turn7: T=7 -> safe (only unsafe at T=4)\n    freeway6: turn8: T=8 -> safe\n    freeway7: turn9: T=9 -> safe\n    freeway8: turn10: T=10 -> safe\n\nAnd we end at turn11 at y=9.\n\nTherefore, a valid sequence is 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a sequence with 9 actions?\n\nSuppose we try to get to freeway4 at turn6 (as before) but then do the last 5 moves in 4 actions? That's impossible because we need 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway4 altogether by jumping from freeway3 to freeway5? But we can only move one step per action, so we must go through freeway4.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nWe can output either the waiting sequence or the backtracking sequence.\n\nI'll choose the waiting sequence:\n\n    Turn1: U\n    Turn2: U\n    Turn3: S\n    Turn4: S\n    Turn5: U\n    Turn6: U\n    Turn7: U\n    Turn8: U\n    Turn9: U\n    Turn10: U\n\nBut let me verify:\n\n    Start at turn1: y1=1.\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2 (turn2: freeway2 at T=2: safe)\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3 (turn3: freeway3 at T=3: safe)\n    Turn3: S -> y4=3 (turn4: freeway3 at T=4: safe) -> note: we are still at freeway3.\n    Turn4: S -> y5=3 (turn5: freeway3 at T=5: safe) -> still at freeway3.\n    Turn5: U -> y6=4 (turn6: freeway4 at T=6: safe)\n    Turn6: U -> y7=5 (turn7: freeway5 at T=7: safe)\n    Turn7: U -> y8=6 (turn8: freeway6 at T=8: safe)\n    Turn8: U -> y9=7 (turn9: freeway7 at T=9: safe)\n    Turn9: U -> y10=8 (turn10: freeway8 at T=10: safe)\n    Turn10: U -> y11=9 (at turn11: we are at y=9)\n\nBut the problem requires that we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 1+10-1 = turn10? \n\nBut at turn10 we are at y10=8, not 9.\n\nAnd then we take the last action (U) at turn10 and then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=y_{1+10-1}=y10=9? But we are at 8 at turn10.\n\nThis is the issue we had earlier.\n\nTherefore, if the problem requires being at 9 at the beginning of turn10 (before the action), then we must be at 9 at turn10.\n\nHow to achieve that? \n\nWe must have y10=9.\n\nWe start at y1=1.\n\nWe need to cover 8 units up in 9 actions? \n\nThe net displacement must be 8.\n\nBut we have 9 actions: so we can do 8 U's and 1 S, for example.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nWe can try to be at freeway4 at a safe turn and then proceed.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nThe moves:\n\n    We start at y1=1.\n    We have 9 actions: from turn1 to turn9.\n\n    Then at turn10 we are at y10.\n\n    We require y10=9.\n\n    So the net displacement over 9 actions must be 8.\n\n    Therefore, we must have 8 U's and 1 non-up action (S or D) that doesn't change the net.\n\n    We can do 8 U's and 1 S.\n\nNow, we have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nWe must assign the S at a turn where we are at a safe freeway.\n\nWe also have to time the passage through freeway4 at a safe turn.\n\nWe are at freeway4 when we are at y=4 at the beginning of a turn.\n\nWe need to be at y=4 at a turn T that is safe: T in {1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,...}\n\nBut we are only going up to turn10.\n\nThe safe turns in [1,10] for freeway4: 1,2,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWe cannot be at y=4 at turn1 or 2 (because we start at 1 and need at least 3 moves to get to 4).\n\nSo we can be at turn6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action that might move us away.\n\nTo minimize the total turns, we want to get to y=4 as early as possible, but safely.\n\nThe earliest safe turn is 6.\n\nSo we want to be at y=4 at turn6.\n\nThen from turn6 to turn10: 4 actions to get to y=9? We need to cover 5 moves (from y=4 to y=9: 5 steps). So we need 5 actions, but we only have 4 actions (from turn6 to turn9) to affect the state at turn10.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10. The actions at turn6,7,8,9 determine the state at turn10.\n\nWe start at turn6: y6=4.\n\nThen:\n\n    turn6: action -> y7 = 4 + a6\n    turn7: action -> y8 = y7 + a7\n    turn8: action -> y9 = y8 + a8\n    turn9: action -> y10 = y9 + a9\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nWe need: \n    y7 in [3,5] (if we move down, up, or stay)\n    y8 in [2,6]\n    y9 in [1,7]\n    y10=9.\n\nThe minimal number of U's needed from y6=4 to y10=9 is 5. But we only have 4 actions. So we can only achieve a net displacement of 4 (if we do 4 U's: then y10=4+4=8) or 3 if we do one non-up.\n\nBut we need a net displacement of 5. \n\nTherefore, it is impossible to get to y=9 at turn10 in 9 actions.\n\nWe need at least 5 actions from y=4 to get to y=9: so the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn11 (after 5 actions from turn6 to turn10).\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn11.\n\nThe problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> y_{1+10-1}=y10=9? But in our plan, y10=8.\n\nSo we must be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nBut we just argued that is impossible in 9 or 10 actions? \n\nLet me clarify the indexing.\n\nWe start at turn1: y1=1.\n\nWe take actions at turns: 1,2,...,H-1? \n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn our case, t1=1.\n\nSo we require y_{1+H-1}=y_H=9.\n\nAnd we take actions at turns 1 to H-1.\n\nHow many actions? H-1 actions.\n\nThe net displacement is from 1 to 9: 8.\n\nSo we need at least 8 actions (if we do 8 U's).\n\nThen H-1 = 8 -> H=9.\n\nThen we require y_{1+9-1}=y9=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn9.\n\nHow do we achieve that?\n\nWe start at turn1: y1=1.\n\nAfter 8 actions (taken at turns1 to 8), we are at y9=9.\n\nThe actions:\n\n    a1, a2, ..., a8.\n\n    Then y2 = y1 + a1\n    y3 = y2 + a2\n    ...\n    y9 = y8 + a8\n\nWe require y9=9.\n\nAnd we require that for turns1 to 8, we are safe.\n\nThe net displacement: y9 - y1 = 8 = a1+a2+...+a8.\n\nEach a_t is in {-1,0,1}. \n\nWe need exactly 8 net up moves, so we must have 8 U's and 0 D's and 0 S's? But that's 8 U's.\n\nBut then we are at freeway4 at turn4: unsafe.\n\nSo we might have to use some S's or D's and compensate with extra U's? \n\nBut we only have 8 actions and we need 8 net up moves, so we must have exactly 8 U's and 0 non-up actions.\n\nTherefore, we must do 8 U's in a row.\n\nBut then we are at freeway4 at turn4: unsafe.\n\nSo it is impossible to do it in 8 actions.\n\nBut we have 8 actions for the moves, and we need 8 net up moves, so we must do 8 U's.\n\nAnd that is unsafe at turn4.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to achieve y9=9 in 8 actions (which would be H=9) without colliding.\n\nSo we must use more than 8 actions.\n\nBut the number of actions is H-1.\n\nWe require y_{H}=9.\n\nAnd we have taken H-1 actions.\n\nThe net displacement is 8.\n\nSo we need at least 8 U's.\n\nThe number of actions is at least 8.\n\nBut we may have extra actions (S or D and then compensate with extra U's).\n\nFor example, if we do 8 U's and 1 S, then we need 9 actions, so H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nThen we require y_{1+10-1}=y10=9.\n\nAnd we take 9 actions.\n\nThe net displacement: 8 = (number of U's) - (number of D's).\n\nIf we do 8 U's, 0 D's, and 1 S, then net=8.\n\nThen we can do:\n\n    U, U, U, S, U, U, U, U, U  [8 U's and 1 S]\n\nBut we have to check the safety.\n\nWe need to be at freeway4 at a safe turn.\n\nThe safe turns for freeway4 in [1,10]: 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWe must be at freeway4 at one of these turns.\n\nWe start at y1=1.\n\nWe want to be at y=4 at a safe turn.\n\nThe earliest safe turn is 6.\n\nSo we want to be at y=4 at turn6.\n\nThen we have to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn6 to y=9 at turn10: we need 5 net up moves in 4 actions? \n\n Because we have actions at turns6,7,8,9 to move from y6=4 to y10=9.\n\n The states:\n\n    turn6: y6=4\n    turn7: y7 = 4 + a6\n    turn8: y8 = y7 + a7\n    turn9: y9 = y8 + a8\n    turn10: y10 = y9 + a9 = 9\n\n We need: a6+a7+a8+a9 = 5.\n\n But each a_t <=1, so the maximum we can get is 4.\n\n Therefore, we cannot achieve +5 in 4 actions.\n\n This is the same problem as before.\n\n Therefore, we must be at a higher y earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at freeway4 at a later turn, but then we have more actions to get to y=9.\n\nBut we are constrained to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nFor example, if we are at freeway4 at turn7:\n\n    To be at y=4 at turn7, we need to have done 3 net up moves in 6 actions? \n        actions at turn1 to 6: net displacement from 1 to 4: +3.\n        so we can have 3 U's and 3 non-up actions.\n\n    Then from turn7: y7=4, we need to get to y10=9: net +5 in 3 actions (at turns7,8,9) -> impossible (max +3).\n\nIf we are at freeway4 at turn8: \n    Then we have actions turn1 to 7 to get from y1=1 to y8=4: net +3 in 7 actions -> we can do that.\n    Then from turn8: y8=4, we need to get to y10=9 in 2 actions: impossible (max +2).\n\nIf at turn9: \n    turn1 to 8: from 1 to 4: net +3 in 8 actions.\n    then from turn9: y9=4, we need to get to y10=9 in one action: only if we can move +5, which we cannot.\n\nIf at turn10: \n    we are at y10=4, but we require y10=9, so not.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to achieve y10=9 with 9 actions (H=10) because we cannot be at freeway4 at a safe turn and then get to 9 in the remaining actions.\n\nBut wait, we may not need to be at freeway4 at a safe turn? We could be at freeway4 at an unsafe turn if we are not there at the beginning of the turn? \n\nNo, because we are at the freeway at the beginning of the turn.\n\n unless we move through it in the action, but the collision check is at the beginning of the turn.\n\nSo the only hope is to be at freeway4 at a safe turn.\n\n Given the above, it is impossible to achieve in 9 actions.\n\nWe try H=11.\n\nThen we require y_{1+11-1}=y11=9.\n\nActions: 10 actions (from turn1 to turn10).\n\nNet displacement: 8.\n\nSo we can do 8 U's and 2 non-up actions.\n\nWe can be at freeway4 at turn6 (safe) and then from turn6 to turn11: 5 actions to do 5 U's -> net +5, so we get to y11=4+5=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo a valid plan for H=11 actions (10 actions in the sequence, but the problem says H is the number of turns? wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions? \n\n Let me read: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\n Then we are at turn t1+H-1 with y=9.\n\n So for H=11, we require y_{1+11-1}=y11=9.\n\n We take 11 actions: turn1 to turn11? \n\n But the sequence has H actions: for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n So for H=11, the actions are for turn1 to turn11.\n\n Then we are at turn12? \n\n This is not matching.\n\n Let me clarify:\n\n We are at turn1 initially.\n\n We take an action at turn1, then we are at turn2.\n\n ...\n\n We take an action at turn1+H-1, then we are at turn1+H.\n\n But the problem requires that at turn1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\n So for the state at the beginning of turn1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n Then we take an action at turn1+H-1, and then we are at turn1+H.\n\n The collision avoidance is for turns1 to 1+H-1.\n\n So for H=10, we require y_{1+10-1}=y10=9.\n\n But in our earlier plan, we can achieve y10=9 only if we can get from 1 to 9 in 9 actions, which requires net 8, and we can do 8 U's in 9 actions by 8 U's and 1 waiting? But we need the net to be 8, so no waiting: exactly 8 U's in 9 actions is not possible because then we would be at 1+8=9 after 8 actions, but then the ninth action would be at turn9, and after that at turn10 we would be at 9 or 10 or 8.\n\n Let's simulate with 8 U's and 1 S, distributed.\n\n We start at turn1: y1=1.\n\n We do 8 U's and 1 S in some order.\n\n The net is 8, so y at turn10 = 1+8 = 9.\n\n The only issue is the safety.\n\n But we must be at freeway4 at a safe turn.\n\n We can try to delay the passage through freeway4 to turn6 or later.\n\n For example:\n\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n    Turn3: S -> y4=3  ( wait at 3)\n    Turn4: U -> y5=4  // at turn5: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=5: unsafe.\n\n not good.\n\n    Turn1: U ->2\n    Turn2: U ->3\n    Turn3: U ->4 // unsafe at turn4.\n\n    Turn1: S ->1\n    Turn2: U ->2\n    Turn3: U ->3\n    Turn4: U ->4 // unsafe.\n\n    Turn1: U ->2\n    Turn2: U ->3\n    Turn3: U ->4 // unsafe.\n\nWe must add a action to wait, but then we will have to do 9 actions for net 8, and we will be at freeway4 at turn5 or turn6.\n\nIf we are at freeway4 at turn5: unsafe.\n\nIf we are at freeway4 at turn6: safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=4 at turn6.\n\nThen from turn6: y6=4, we need to go to y10=9: net +5 in 4 actions ( turns6 to 9: actions at turn6,7,8,9 -> 4 actions).\n\n net +5 in 4 actions: doable only if we do 5 U's and -1 somewhere? net is number of U's minus number of D's.\n\n 5 U's and 0 D's: net +5, but that's 5 actions, and we only have 4 actions.\n\n Therefore, net +5 in 4 actions is impossible.\n\n So we cannot achieve y10=9.\n\n For H=11: we require y_{1+11-1}=y11=9.\n\n actions: 10 actions ( for turn1 to turn10).\n\n net from 1 to 9: 8.\n\n then we can have 8 U's and 2 non-up actions.\n\n and we can be at freeway4 at turn6.\n\n then from turn6: y6=4, we need to go to y11=9: net +5 in 5 actions ( turns6 to 10: 5 actions) -> doable with 5 U's.\n\n So the plan for H=11:\n\n    to get to y=4 at turn6: 5 actions ( net +3 in 5 actions: so 3 U's and 2 S's, or 3 U's, 1 D, and 1 U extra? Let's net +3 in 5 actions: number of U's - number of D's = 3, and number of actions=5.\n        for example, 4 U's and 1 D: net = 3, or 3 U's and 2 S's: net=3.\n\n    then from turn6: y6=4, we do 5 U's in a row: \n        turn6: U -> y7=5\n        turn7: U -> y8=6\n        turn8: U -> y9=7\n        turn9: U -> y10=8\n        turn10: U -> y11=9\n\n    then at turn11, we are at y=9.\n\n    and the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=y_{1+11-1}=y11=9.\n\n    perfect.\n\n    Now, the actions for the first 5 turns to get to y=4 at turn6 with net +3 in 5 actions:\n\n        one possibility: 3 U's and 2 S's.\n\n        Turn1: U -> y2=2\n        Turn2: U -> y3=3\n        Turn3: S -> y4=3\n        Turn4: S -> y5=3\n        Turn5: U -> y6=4\n\n        This is net +3 ( because only 3 U's and 2 S's).\n\n    Then the sequence:\n\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: S\n        Turn4: S\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n\n    But then we have 10 actions, and we require for H=11 to have 11 actions? \n\n    No, for H=11, the sequence has 11 actions? \n\n    The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> H actions.\n\n    and then we are at turn t1+H-1 with y=9.\n\n    For H=11, we are at turn1+11-1= turn11 with y11=9.\n\n    We need 11 actions: for turn1 to turn11? \n\n    But in our plan, we have only 10 actions and we are at turn11.\n\n    How? \n        actions at turn1 to turn10: 10 actions.\n        then at turn11: we are at y11=9.\n\n    So we have taken 10 actions, not 11.\n\n    Therefore, for the condition: the sequence has H actions, and after those actions, we are at turn t1+H-1 with y=9.\n\n    In this case, with 10 actions (H=10), we are at turn1+10-1= turn10 with y10=? \n        in our plan, at turn10: we did an action (U) and then at turn11 we are at 9, but the state at turn10 is before the action: we are at y10=8.\n\n    So for H=10, we are not at 9 at turn10.\n\n    For H=11, we would need 11 actions, but we only have 10 in the above plan.\n\n    So we need to add one more action.\n\n    The net for the whole thing must be 8, so if we do 11 actions, we must have net 8, so we can have 8 U's and 3 non-up actions.\n\n    then we can add one more S at the beginning or at the end.\n\n    For example, add an S at the end:\n\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: S\n        Turn4: S\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: S   // then y12 = 9+0=9? but we are at turn12, and we require to be at turn1+11-1= turn11 with y11=9, not turn12.\n\n    So at turn11, we are at y11=9 only if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\n    then the action at turn11 is taken at a state of 9.\n\n    in this case, the last action ( at turn11) is S, and then at turn12 we are still at 9, but we don't care.\n\n    but the requirement is for turn11: y11=9.\n\n    in the above, after the action at turn10, we are at turn11: y11=9.\n\n    then we take an action at turn11: which is S, but that doesn't change the state for turn11 ( because the state at turn11 is before the action).\n\n    the state at turn11 is 9, which is what we want.\n\n    then we take action S at turn11, and then at turn12 we are still at 9.\n\n    so it is valid.\n\n    Therefore, the sequence for H=11 is:\n\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: S\n        Turn4: S\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: S\n\n    But we can put the extra S anywhere safe.\n\n    However, we must ensure safety at turn11: we are at y11=9 -> safe.\n\n    So this works.\n\n    But is there a sequence with H=10? \n\n    For H=10, we require y10=9.\n\n    with 9 actions, net 8.\n\n    then we must be at freeway4 at a safe turn.\n\n    and then have enough actions to cover the remaining net.\n\n    but we saw that to be at freeway4 at turn6 (safe), we need net +3 in 5 actions, which allows us to be at y6=4.\n\n    then we need net +5 in 4 actions ( actions at turn6 to turn9) to get to y10=9, which is impossible.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n So the answer is 11 actions.\n\n actions for turn1 to turn11:\n\n    Turn1: U\n    Turn2: U\n    Turn3: S\n    Turn4: S\n    Turn5: U\n    Turn6: U\n    Turn7: U\n    Turn8: U\n    Turn9: U\n    Turn10: U\n    Turn11: S\n\nBut note at the last action we are at y=9 at turn11 (before the action), and then we do S.\n\nWe could do any action at turn11, but S is fine.\n\n Now, verify the safety:\n\n    turn1: y1=1 -> freeway1 at T=1: safe.\n    turn2: y2=2 -> freeway2 at T=2: safe.\n    turn3: y3=3 -> freeway3 at T=3: safe.\n    turn4: y4=3 -> freeway3 at T=4: safe.\n    turn5: y5=4 -> freeway4 at T=5: unsafe! \n\n    Oh no! at turn5, we are at freeway4 and T=5 is unsafe for freeway4.\n\n So we are not after all.\n\n We are at freeway4 at turn5: because at turn5: we are at y5=4.\n\n and freeway4 is unsafe at T=5.\n\n So we need to be at freeway4 at a safe turn, which in this sequence we are at turn5: unsafe.\n\n So we must adjust to be at freeway4 at turn6 or later.\n\n in the above, we did at turn5: U from y4=3 to y5=4.\n\n but turn5 is unsafe.\n\n So we need to be at y=4 at turn6.\n\n then we should do the fifth action (U) at turn6, not turn5.\n\n But we are at turn5: we are at y=3.\n\n then at turn5: we can do S or U or D.\n\n if we do U at turn5, we become y6=4 at turn6: then at turn6: freeway4 at T=6: safe.\n\n then from turn6: we do U's.\n\n so the sequence should be:\n\n    Turn1: U -> y2=2\n    Turn2: U -> y3=3\n    Turn3: S -> y4=3\n    Turn4: S -> y5=3\n    Turn5: S -> y6=3   // wait at 3 for another turn\n    Turn6: U -> y7=4   // at turn7: we are at y=4? -> no, at turn7: state is y7=4, so we are at freeway4 at turn7: T=7: safe.\n\n    then we need to do 5 U's in a row:\n\n        Turn7: U -> y8=5\n        Turn8: U -> y9=6\n        Turn9: U -> y10=7\n        Turn10: U -> y11=8\n        Turn11: U -> y12=9\n\n    but then we are at y12=9 at turn12.\n\n    and for H=12: we require y_{1+12-1}=y12=9.\n\n    and actions from turn1 to turn11: 11 actions.\n\n    so H=12.\n\n    then we can do:\n\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: S\n        Turn4: S\n        Turn5: S\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n\n    net: 8 U's and 3 S's -> net 8, and we are at y12=1+8=9.\n\n    and at turn7: freeway4 at T=7: safe.\n    turn8: freeway5 at T=8: safe.\n    turn9: freeway6 at T=9: safe.\n    turn10: freeway7 at T10: safe.\n    turn11: freeway8 at T11: safe.\n    turn12: y=9, safe.\n\n    So this works.\n\n    But is there a shorter H? \n\n    H=12 actions ( for turn1 to turn11) -> then we are at turn12 with y12=9.\n\n    minimal before was 10 for the straight line but with collision, then we had 10 or 11 for safe.\n\n    but now we have 12.\n\n    We can try to use the backtracking to save one action.\n\n    instead of waiting at y=3 for three turns, we can wait for only two and then use a different path.\n\n    but to be at y=4 at turn6, we need to have spent 5 actions as before, and then 5 actions for the last part, so 10 actions, and then one extra action for the net ( because net must be 8, and we have 10 actions, so we must have 8 U's and 2 non-up actions, which is net 8).\n\n    then we are at y=9 at turn11.\n\n    so for the first part, to get to y=4 at turn6: we need net +3 in 5 actions: for example, 3 U's and 2 S's.\n\n    then from turn6: y=4, we do 5 U's in a row: \n        turn6: U -> y7=5\n        turn7: U -> y8=6\n        turn8: U -> y9=7\n        turn9: U -> y10=8\n        turn10: U -> y11=9\n\n    so we are at y11=9 at turn11.\n\n    then the actions are 10 in total: turn1 to turn10.\n\n    for H=11, we would then have 10 actions? -> the sequence has H actions, so for H=11, we need 11 actions.\n\n    so we must add one more action.\n\n    then add an S anywhere safe.\n\n    for example, at the end:\n\n        turn1: U\n        turn2: U\n        turn3: S\n        turn4: S\n        turn5: U  // at turn6: y6=4 ( because after action at turn5, we are at turn6: y6=4)\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: S\n\n    then at turn11: we are at y11=9 ( state at the beginning of turn11: after the action at turn10, we are at turn11: y11=9).\n\n    so it meets the condition for H=11: y_{1+11-1}=y11=9.\n\n    and the action at turn11 is taken at turn11 when we are at y=9.\n\n    now, check safety for the first part:\n\n        turn1: y1=1 -> safe.\n        turn2: y2=2 -> safe.\n        turn3: y3=3 -> safe.\n        turn4: y4=3 -> safe.\n        turn5: y5=4 -> freeway4 at T=5: unsafe! \n\n    again, at turn5: we are at freeway4 and T=5 is unsafe.\n\n so we must not be at freeway4 at turn5.\n\n to be at y=4 at turn6: we need to have the fifth action (U) at turn5, which moves us to y=4 at turn6.\n\n how to achieve that? \n\n    after action at turn4: we are at turn5: what is y5?\n\n    in the sequence:\n\n        turn1: U -> y2=2\n        turn2: U -> y3=3\n        turn3: S -> y4=3\n        turn4: S -> y5=3   // at the beginning of turn5, we are at y=3.\n        turn5: U -> then at turn6: y6=4.\n\n    so at turn5: we are at y=3, not 4.\n\n    then freeway3 at T=5: safe.\n\n    so only at turn6: we are at freeway4: safe.\n\n    Therefore, the sequence is safe.\n\n    So the complete sequence for H=11 (11 actions):\n\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: S\n        Turn4: S\n        Turn5: U   // this action is at turn5, and we are at y=3 at the beginning of turn5. After this action, at turn6: y=4.\n        Turn6: U   // at turn6: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=6: safe. Then after action, at turn7: y=5.\n        Turn7: U   // -> y8=6 at turn8\n        Turn8: U   // -> y9=7 at turn9\n        Turn9: U   // -> y10=8 at turn10\n        Turn10: U  // -> y11=9 at turn11\n        Turn11: S  // we can choose any action; S is fine. At the beginning of turn11, we are at y=9.\n\n    So at turn11: y11=9, as required.\n\n    Now check safety at each turn from 1 to 10 ( since at turn11: y=9, safe by rule).\n\n        turn1: y1=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n        turn2: y2=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n        turn3: y3=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n        turn4: y4=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n        turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n        turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4: T=6: safe.\n        turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5: T=7: safe.\n        turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6: T=8: safe.\n        turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7: T=9: safe.\n        turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8: T=10: safe.\n\n    All safe.\n\n    Therefore, minimal H is 11.\n\n    The sequence of actions (11 actions):\n\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: S\n        Turn4: S\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: S\n\nBut note, we could avoid the last S if we are allowed to do any action, but since we must have 11 actions, we include it.\n\n    Alternatively, we could put the extra S earlier, but this is fine.\n\n    So the answer is:\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) while avoiding collisions with cars is \\(H = 11\\). The sequence of actions is designed to ensure the player is at \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\) (i.e., turn 11).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 3.\n- Staying at \\(y = 3\\) for turns 3 and 4 to avoid the unsafe period for freeway 4 at turns 4 and 5.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6, when freeway 4 is safe.\n- Moving up consecutively to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11.\n- The final action (stay) at turn 11 is taken when already at \\(y = 9\\), ensuring no collision.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 3, and I need to find the sequence of actions starting from this turn.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=3 and want to go to y=9, moving up makes sense, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with their own set of cars. The cars move left or right with a certain speed. Collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y-position, you are not considered on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and you only check the cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=3, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t=3:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head h=-39, tail τ=-50, direction right, speed s=3. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-50 + 3(T-3), -39 + 3(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span at a given turn.\n\nAlso, for right-moving cars, since head is greater than tail? The notation says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ < h I assume? Let me check.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], and since it's moving right, h should be greater than τ, so [τ, h] is increasing.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3). But -39 is head, -50 is tail, and since it's right-moving, head should be on the right, so if numbers increase to the right, head h=-39, tail τ=-50, so h > τ since -39 > -50, so the car is from -50 to -39, and moving right, so at time T, it's [ -50 + 3(T-3), -39 + 3(T-3) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, freeway 4 has three cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\n(0,-11,right,4) — tail -11, head 0? But tail should be left, head right, so if head=0, tail=-11, that means the car spans from -11 to 0 at t=3? But direction right, so moving right.\n\nSimilarly, (36,25,right,4) — head=36, tail=25? 36>25, so from 25 to 36.\n\nBut let's list all freeways clearly.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-39, tail=-50, dir=right, s=3 → span at T: [ -50 + 3(T-3), -39 + 3(T-3) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"(-39, -50, right, 3)\" so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also \"(-39, -50, right, 3)\" same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n\n- Car1: head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, s=4 → span at T: [ -47 + 4(T-3), -36 + 4(T-3) ]\n\n- Car2: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, s=4 → [ -11 + 4(T-3), 0 + 4(T-3) ] = [ -11 + 4(T-3), 4(T-3) ]\n\n- Car3: head=36, tail=25, dir=right, s=4 → [ 25 + 4(T-3), 36 + 4(T-3) ]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, s=12, right → [ -23 + 12(T-3), -12 + 12(T-3) ]\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, s=12, right → [ 25 + 12(T-3), 36 + 12(T-3) ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 all have the same cars as freeway 5.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn t=3.\n\nI need to get to y=9, which is above, so I need to move up through freeways 4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=9 might be safe, no cars there.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer is at (0,y), so x=0 is the point we care about for collision.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway k=y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince we move step by step, at each turn, we choose an action, then move, and after moving, we are at y_{t+1} for the next state, but collision is checked based on current y_t at turn t.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since we're moving at turn T, and we are on y_T at turn T, we only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision at that turn.\n\nWhen we move to y_{T+1}, that position is for the next turn.\n\nSo at each turn T, we are on position y_T, and we check if for freeway y_T, 0 is in any car's span at time T. If yes, collision.\n\nThen we choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=3, we need to go up through y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, we just need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least 6, since we need to move up 6 steps (from 3 to 4,4 to5,...,8 to9), but we can stay or move down sometimes to avoid cars, but since we want minimal turns, we should move up as much as possible, unless there's a collision.\n\nMoving down might be necessary to avoid, but since we start at 3 and need to go to 9, moving down would increase H, so probably not minimal. So I should only consider moving up or staying, but staying also increases turns without progress, so for minimal H, we should avoid staying if possible, only when necessary to avoid collision.\n\nBut staying might be needed to wait for a car to pass.\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, the spans change over time, so I need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway at x=0.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway k, and for each possible time t, I need to know if at time t, 0 is occupied by a car on freeway k, i.e., if 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at time t.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at time t.\n\nBut since we move step by step, we need to plan a path through time and y-positions.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the sequence must be a path from y=3 to y=9 with steps in y.\n\nAnd at each point, when we are at (t,y), it must be that for freeway y, at time t, 0 is not in any car span.\n\nThen we choose action to go to next y.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and each relevant time whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, time is measured from t_1=3, so let τ = t - t_1 = t - 3, so τ=0 is current time.\n\nThen for each car, span at time t = span at τ.\n\nI'll use τ as offset for simplicity.\n\nSo τ ≥ 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find when 0 is not in any car span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, span at τ: [ -50 + 3τ, -39 + 3τ ]\n\n0 in span if -50 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -39 + 3τ\n\nSo -50 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -39 + 3τ\n\nFirst: -50 + 3τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 3τ ≤ 50 ⇒ τ ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so τ ≤ 16 since τ integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -39 + 3τ ⇒ 3τ ≥ 39 ⇒ τ ≥ 13\n\nSo for τ from 13 to 16 inclusive, 0 is in span.\n\nOtherwise, not.\n\nSince τ=0 to, say, 20 should be enough.\n\nFor τ <13 or τ>16, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, and we start at y=3, and going up, we might not go to y=1, but we could, but since we start at 3 and go to 9, we probably don't need to go to lower freeways, so freeway 1 might not be relevant, similarly freeway 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 are same as freeway 1, so same thing.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4, which we need to pass through.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: [ -47 + 4τ, -36 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in this span: -47 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 4τ\n\nSo -47 + 4τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4τ ≤ 47 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/4 = 11.75, τ ≤ 11\n\n0 ≤ -36 + 4τ ⇒ 4τ ≥ 36 ⇒ τ ≥ 9\n\nSo for τ=9,10,11\n\nτ ≥9 and τ≤11, so τ=9,10,11\n\nSecond car: [ -11 + 4τ, 0 + 4τ ] = [ -11 + 4τ, 4τ ]\n\n0 in this span: since the span is from -11+4τ to 4τ, and 0 is included if -11+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 4τ\n\n-11+4τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4τ ≤ 11 ⇒ τ ≤ 2.75, τ ≤ 2\n\n0 ≤ 4τ always true for τ≥0\n\nSo for τ≤2, 0 is in this span.\n\nSpecifically, when τ=0,1,2\n\nτ=0: [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included.\n\nτ=1: [ -11+4= -7, 4], -7 to 4, 0 in it.\n\nτ=2: [ -11+8= -3, 8], -3 to 8, 0 in it.\n\nτ=3: [ -11+12=1, 12], 1 to 12, 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly for higher τ.\n\nSo second car has 0 in span for τ=0,1,2.\n\nThird car: [25 + 4τ, 36 + 4τ], since 25+4τ ≥25>0 for τ≥0, so 0 not in span ever, as min is at least 25.\n\nSo for freeway 4, collision at x=0 when either first car or second car has 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: τ=0,1,2\n\nFirst car: τ=9,10,11\n\nSo unsafe at τ=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nSafe otherwise, for τ≥0.\n\nτ=3 to 8,12,13,... should be safe.\n\nτ=3: first car span: [ -47+12= -35, -36+12= -24], -35 to -24, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -11+12=1, 12], 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [25+12=37, 48], not.\n\nSo safe at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, τ=4: [ -47+16= -31, -36+16= -20], not 0.\n\n[ -11+16=5, 16], not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=8: first car: [ -47+32= -15, -36+32= -4], -15 to -4, 0 not in? -4 <0, so 0 not in [-15,-4].\n\n-4 to -15? -15 to -4, which is negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -11+32=21, 32], not.\n\nτ=9: first car: [ -47+36= -11, -36+36=0 ], -11 to 0, so 0 is included.\n\nYes, τ=9 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=10: [ -47+40= -7, -36+40=4], -7 to 4, 0 in.\n\nτ=11: [ -47+44= -3, -36+44=8], -3 to 8, 0 in.\n\nτ=12: [ -47+48=1, -36+48=12], 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 4 safe for τ=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,...\n\nNow, since we are at τ=0 (t=3), and we need to go through y=4 at some point.\n\nPlayer is at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, s=12, right → span at τ: [ -23 + 12τ, -12 + 12τ ]\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, s=12, right → [25 + 12τ, 36 + 12τ]\n\nNow, for first car: 0 in span if -23 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12τ\n\n-23 + 12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 23 ⇒ τ ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so τ ≤ 1\n\n0 ≤ -12 + 12τ ⇒ 12τ ≥ 12 ⇒ τ ≥ 1\n\nSo for τ=1 only.\n\nτ=1: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nτ=0: -23 to -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+12τ, 36+12τ], min 25>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nSafe for τ=0,2,3,...\n\nτ=0: first car [ -23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1: unsafe\n\nτ=2: [1,12], safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, since cars identical.

At τ=0, freeway 3: span [ -50, -39], 0 not in, so no collision. Safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 to y=8.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once on y=9, it's fine.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the unsafe times in terms of τ.\n\nτ = t - 3.\n\nFreeway y=4: unsafe at τ=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nBut τ=0 is current time, but we are not on y=4 yet.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on y=3.\n\nFreeway y=4 unsafe at τ=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nSafe at τ=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\nFreeway y=5: unsafe at τ=1 only\n\nSafe at τ=0,2,3,4,...\n\nSimilarly freeway y=6: same as y=5, unsafe at τ=1 only\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=1 only\n\ny=8: unsafe τ=1 only\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move up increases y by 1, so from y=3 to y=9, at least 6 moves up, but we can have stay or down, but for minimal H, we should minimize the number of stays.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, with actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t_1=3, we are at y_{t_1} = y_3 = 3.\n\nWe perform actions at t=3,4,5,... up to some t, and at turn t, we have y_t =9.\n\nThe last action is at turn t when we reach y_t=9, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nWe have actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have reached after H steps.\n\nAt time t_1, before action, we are at (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we move to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, we are at position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at some turn, meaning that at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nTurn T is when we are at that position.\n\nIn the sequence, after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k with position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action at t_1, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nWe want for some H, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, we do one action at t_1, and at turn t_1, we are still at y_{t_1}, but after action, at turn t_1+1, y might change.\n\nBut we want y to be 9 at some turn.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9.\n\nSuppose at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT must be >= t_1.\n\nThe actions before that determine how we get there.\n\nFor minimal H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nSince we need to go from y=3 to y=9, the minimal steps: if no cars, we can go up each turn, so in 6 turns: at t=3, y=3; action U at t=3, to y=4 at t=4; U at t=4 to y=5 at t=5; ... U at t=8 to y=9 at t=9. So at turn t=9, y=9.\n\nt from 3 to 9, that's 7 turns? Let's index.\n\nTurn t=3: position y=3\n\nAction a_3: if U, then at turn t=4, y=4\n\na_4: U, t=5, y=5\n\n...\n\na_8: U, t=9, y=9\n\nSo actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8: 6 actions, to reach at turn t=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1=3.\n\nStart: turn 3, y=3.\n\nAfter action a_3, at turn 4, y=4 or other.\n\nAfter a_4, turn 5, y= something, etc.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe smallest possible T is turn 9, with y=9, as above, if we move up each time.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at each turn.\n\nIn the sequence above: at turn 3, y=3, which is safe as we saw.\n\nAt turn 4, y=4, τ = t - 3, t=4, τ=1.\n\nFreeway y=4 at τ=1: unsafe, because τ=1 is unsafe for y=4 (from earlier, τ=0,1,2 unsafe).\n\nAt τ=1, t=4, y=4, unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=4 at turn 4 (τ=1).\n\nSimilarly, if we go directly up.\n\nWe need to delay or something.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, unsafe only at τ=13,14,15,16, so for early times, safe.\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=0,1,2,9,10,11; safe at τ=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=1; safe at τ=0,2,3,4,...\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8: unsafe at τ=1; safe otherwise.\n\ny=9: always safe.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe issue is y=4 at τ=1 is unsafe, and y=5,6,7,8 at τ=1 are also unsafe.\n\nBut τ=1 corresponds to t=4.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=4 (τ=1), if we are on y=4, unsafe; if we could be on y=5, but y=5 at τ=1 is also unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince we start at y=3, τ=0.\n\nWe need to choose actions.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nFor minimal turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut at τ=1 (t=4), it is unsafe to be on y=4,5,6,7,8 because:\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=3: safe at τ=1, since unsafe only later.\n\ny=9: safe, but we can't reach at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, t=4, possible y positions: from y=3 at τ=0, after one action, at turn t=4, y could be:\n\n- If a_3=S, y=3\n\n- If a_3=U, y=4\n\n- If a_3=D, y=2, but y=2 might have cars, but we are not going down.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, which is like freeway 1, unsafe at τ=13-16, so at τ=1, safe. But going down might not help.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe at τ=1.\n\nBut since we want to go up, probably not useful.\n\nSo at τ=1, if we are on y=3, it is safe; on y=4,5,6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nWe can be on y=3 at τ=1 by staying or moving down, but moving down is worse.\n\nSo perhaps we stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\nThen at τ=2, t=5.\n\nNow, τ=2, what is safe.\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=2 (from earlier, τ=0,1,2 unsafe for y=4)\n\ny=5: safe at τ=2 (since unsafe only τ=1)\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at τ=2.\n\ny=3 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut we need to move up.\n\nAt τ=2, t=5, if we are at y=3, we can move to y=4.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=2 is unsafe.\n\nWe can move to other, but let's see.\n\nFirst, from start: τ=0, t=3, y=3.\n\nAction a_3: if we do S, then at turn t=4, y=3, τ=1, which is safe for y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, we choose action for next.\n\nIf we do U at t=4, to go to y=4 at turn t=5, τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, t=5, y=4, which is unsafe because y=4 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIf we do U at t=4 from y=3, we go to y=4 at t=5.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we do S again at t=4, stay at y=3 at t=5, τ=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, we can do something.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\ny=4 is unsafe until τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is safe at τ=2,3,etc except τ=1.\n\nSo let's list the safe τ for each y we care about.\n\nWe need to be on y=4 at some τ where it is safe, i.e., τ not in {0,1,2,9,10,11}, so τ=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, safe except τ=1, so safe at τ=0,2,3,4,...\n\nBut τ=0 is past, we are at y=3.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 same as y=5.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if we can be on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3, t=6.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nStart: τ=0, t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=4 at a safe time, earliest τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=5 at τ=2 or later, except τ=1.\n\nBut since y=4 must be visited before y=5, and y=4 safe from τ=3.\n\nNow, to be at y=4 at τ=3, which is turn t=6.\n\nAt turn t=6, τ=3, y=4.\n\nHow to get there from start.\n\nAt t=3, y=3.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that at turn t=6, y=4.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=6, that's 3 turns: actions at t=3,4,5 to determine y at t=4,5,6.\n\nAt turn t=6, y=4.\n\nThe position at turn T depends on actions before.\n\ny_t = y_{t-1} + Δy_{t-1}, with Δ from action at t-1.\n\nSet time.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor example, at turn t=3, y_3 =3.\n\nAction a_3 determines y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 determines y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\na_5 determines y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5.\n\nWe want y_6 =4, for example.\n\ny_6 =4.\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_3=3\n\nSo to have y_6=4, we need y_5 + Δy_5 =4.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 + Δy_4 = y_5, etc.\n\nSince we start at y_3=3, to have y_6=4, that means in three steps, we only increased by 1, so we must have stayed twice or moved down, but moved down would make it worse, so probably stayed twice.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at t=3, action S: Δy=0, so y_4 =3\n\nAt t=4, action S: Δy=0, y_5=3\n\nAt t=5, action U: Δy=+1, y_6=4\n\nThen at turn t=6, y=4, τ=3, which is safe for y=4.\n\nNow, from here, we can go up to y=5.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nAction a_6: U, then y_7=5\n\nNow turn t=7, τ=4, y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at τ=4? Yes, since unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 should be safe at τ=4.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nτ=4, t=7.\n\ny=5 at τ=4: freeway 5, safe since τ=4 ≠1.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up.\n\nAction a_6=U at t=6, to y_7=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_7=U, to y_8=6 at t=8.\n\nt=8, τ=5, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only at τ=1, so safe.\n\nAction a_8=U, to y_9=7 at t=9.\n\nt=9, τ=6, y=7, safe.\n\nAction a_9=U, to y_10=8 at t=10.\n\nt=10, τ=7, y=8, safe.\n\nAction a_10=U, to y_11=9 at t=11.\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we reached at t=11, with actions from t=3 to t=10, 8 actions.\n\nH=8 actions, from t=3 to t=10, reach at t=11.\n\nBut t_1=3, so actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 8 actions, reach at turn t=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal is 6, but with delay.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nFor example, at start, instead of staying, we can go down or something, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=5 is safe at τ=0, but τ=0 is t=3, we are at y=3, not y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=5 at a safe time.\n\nEarliest safe for y=5 is τ=0 or τ=2, but τ=0 is past.\n\nτ=2 is t=5.\n\nCan we be at y=5 at τ=2?\n\ny=5 at turn t=5, τ=2.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=3, to y=5 at t=5.\n\nIn two steps: from t=3 to t=5, actions at t=3 and t=4.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nSet y_5=5.\n\ny_3=3.\n\nSo y_5 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 = 3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 =5\n\nSo Δy_3 + Δy_4 =2.\n\nSince Δy can be +1,0,-1, to increase by 2 in two steps, must have two U actions.\n\nSo a_3=U, a_4=U.\n\nThen y_4 = y_3 +1 =4\n\ny_5 = y_4 +1 =5\n\nNow, at turn t=4, y=4, τ=1.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=1 is unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we do U and S, but y_5=3 +1 +0=4 <5.\n\nCannot reach y=5 in two steps without being on y=4 at τ=1, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, in one step impossible.\n\nSo earliest to reach y=5 is at τ=2 or later.\n\nBut to reach y=5 at τ=2, t=5.\n\nFrom above, if we go directly, we are on y=4 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on unsafe positions.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe at τ=0, but we can't be there at τ=0.\n\nOr at τ=2.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=2, we must pass through y=4 at some point, but at τ=1, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nThe only way to reach y=5 without being on y=4 at τ=1 is to be on y=4 at a different time or skip it, but we can't skip, since we move step by step.\n\nWe must be on y=4 at some turn.\n\nThe safe times for y=4 are τ=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\nEarliest is τ=3, t=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, we can be there at τ=2,3,4,... except τ=1.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=2, we need to be at y=4 at τ=1 or τ=2, but both unsafe for y=4.\n\nτ=1 and τ=2 are unsafe for y=4.\n\nThe only safe times for y=4 are τ>=3 except 9,10,11.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at τ=1 or 2; we must be there at τ=3 or later.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=5 at τ=0,2,3,... but τ=0 not possible.\n\nAt τ=2, to be on y=5, we must have been on y=4 at τ=1 or τ=2, but both unsafe, so impossible to be on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nBecause to reach y=5 at turn t, we must have been at y=4 at turn t-1 or something.\n\nSuppose at turn T, we are at y_T=5.\n\nThen at turn T-1, we were at y_{T-1}, and after action at T-1, we moved to y_T.\n\ny_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}\n\nIf Δy_{T-1} = +1, then y_{T-1} =4\n\nIf Δy_{T-1} =0, then y_{T-1}=5\n\nIf Δy_{T-1} = -1, then y_{T-1}=6\n\nBut since we are coming from below, probably y_{T-1}=4 or 5.\n\nTo reach y=5 for the first time, likely from y=4.\n\nBut at the turn when we are at y=5, it could be from moving up from 4 or staying.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor y=5 at time T, τ=T-3.\n\nTo have y_T=5, it must be that at time T, freeway y=5 is safe.\n\nBut to get there, at time T-1, we were at some position.\n\nIf we moved up from y=4 to y=5 at action T-1, then at turn T-1, we were on y=4, which must be safe at that turn.\n\nIf we stayed at y=5, then at turn T-1 we were on y=5.\n\nIn this case, for y=5 at τ=2, T=5, τ=2.\n\ny_5=5.\n\nThen, either:\n\n- We came from y_4=4, with a_4=U, so at turn t=4, we were on y=4, which is τ=1, unsafe.\n\n- Or we came from y_4=5, with a_4=S, so at t=4, y=4? No, y_4=5, but at turn t=4, position is y_4.\n\nIf y_4=5, then at turn t=4, we are on freeway y=5, τ=1.\n\nBut y=5 at τ=1 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf y_4=6, with a_4=D, then at t=4, y=6, τ=1, which is unsafe for y=6 (since unsafe at τ=1).\n\nSimilarly, any freeway y=4,5,6,7,8 at τ=1 is unsafe.\n\nAnd y=3 at τ=1 is safe, but y=3 ≠5.\n\nSo to have y_5=5, we must have been at y_4=4,5, or6, but all these positions at τ=1 are unsafe except possibly, but y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe at τ=1.\n\ny=3 is safe, but not 5.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=5 at τ=2, because at the previous turn τ=1, we would be on an unsafe position or not on the way.\n\nSimilarly, for any position between 4 and 8 at τ=1 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=5 at turn t=5 (τ=2), because the only ways to be there require being on an unsafe position at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot reach y=5 before τ=3 or something.\n\nLet's find the earliest possible time to be on y=5.\n\ny=5 safe for τ=0,2,3,4,...\n\nBut τ=0 not possible.\n\nτ=2: as above, impossible because to be there at τ=2, we need to be at τ=1 on a position that allows it, but all positions except y=3 are unsafe at τ=1, and from y=3, we can go to y=4 at τ=1, but y=4 unsafe, or stay or down.\n\nBut from y=3, if we go to y=4 at τ=1, unsafe; if we stay, y=3 at τ=1, safe, but not y=5.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3: t=6, y=5 possible?\n\ny_6=5.\n\nThen at turn t=6, τ=3, y=5 safe.\n\nNow, how to get there.\n\ny_6=5.\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_3=3\n\nSo y_6 = 3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nSet y_6=5, so Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 =2\n\nWith each Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nTo increase by 2 in three steps, possible with two U and one S, or other combinations.\n\nThe point is, we need to be at intermediate positions at safe times.\n\nFor example, to have y_6=5, we need y_5 and y_4.\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\netc.\n\nBut we need each position at its turn to be safe.\n\nNow, at τ=3, t=6, y=5 safe.\n\nNow, y_6=5, so possible:\n\n- If y_5=4 and a_5=U, then at t=5, y=4 must be safe.\n\n- If y_5=5 and a_5=S, then at t=5, y=5 must be safe.\n\n- If y_5=6 and a_5=D, then at t=5, y=6 must be safe.\n\nNow t=5, τ=2.\n\ny=4 at τ=2: unsafe, as per freeway 4.\n\ny=5 at τ=2: freeway 5, unsafe? τ=2 for y=5: earlier, y=5 unsafe only at τ=1, so at τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 at τ=2 safe.\n\ny=4 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nSo for y_6=5, options:\n\n- If from y_5=4, with U, then at t=5, y=4, τ=2, unsafe, not possible.\n\n- If from y_5=5, with S, then at t=5, y=5, τ=2, which is safe.\n\n- If from y_5=6, with D, then at t=5, y=6, τ=2, safe.\n\nNow, y_5=5 or 6.\n\nBut we start from below, so y_5=6 might not be efficient.\n\nFirst, option with y_5=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, y_5=5.\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_4 at t=4, τ=1.\n\nNow, y_5=5, so:\n\n- If from y_4=4, with U, then at t=4, y=4, τ=1, unsafe.\n\n- If from y_4=5, with S, then at t=4, y=5, τ=1, unsafe.\n\n- If from y_4=6, with D, then at t=4, y=6, τ=1, unsafe.\n\nAll these positions at τ=1 are unsafe: y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_5=5 at τ=2, because to have y_5=5, we must have been at y_4 which is between 4 and 6, all unsafe at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly for y_5=6.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=5 at τ=2 or earlier; the earliest possible is τ=3 or later.\n\nAt τ=3, t=6, we can be on y=5 if we come from staying or from above, but let's see how.\n\nFrom the beginning.\n\nAt t=3, τ=0, y=3, safe.\n\nAction a_3: let's choose.\n\nIf we do S, then at t=4, y=3, τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, action a_4.\n\nNow, we can do U, to go to y=4 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4, τ=2, which is unsafe for y=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo S again at t=4, stay y=3 at t=5, τ=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action a_5: U, to y=4 at t=6, τ=3.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, τ=3, which is safe for y=4.\n\nThen from here, we can go up.\n\nAs in the first plan.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, to y=5 at t=7, τ=4.\n\nt=7, τ=4, y=5, safe.\n\na_7=U, to y=6 at t=8, τ=5, y=6 safe.\n\na_8=U, to y=7 at t=9, τ=6, y=7 safe.\n\na_9=U, to y=8 at t=10, τ=7, y=8 safe.\n\na_10=U, to y=9 at t=11, τ=8.\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nActions: from t=3 to t=10.\n\nt=3: S (since we stayed)\n\nt=4: S (stayed)\n\nt=5: U (to go to y=4)\n\nt=6: U (to y=5)\n\nt=7: U (to y=6)\n\nt=8: U (to y=7)\n\nt=9: U (to y=8)\n\nt=10: U (to y=9)\n\nAt t=10, action U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, we reached at t=11.\n\nBut at t=5, we did U to go to y=4 at t=6.\n\nIn the actions, a_t is at turn t.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Turn t=3: action a_3, we did S, so y_4=3\n\n- Turn t=4: action a_4, we did S, so y_5=3\n\n- Turn t=5: action a_5, we did U, so y_6=4\n\n- Turn t=6: action a_6, U, y_7=5\n\n- Turn t=7: action a_7, U, y_8=6\n\n- Turn t=8: action a_8, U, y_9=7\n\n- Turn t=9: action a_9, U, y_10=8\n\n- Turn t=10: action a_10, U, y_11=9\n\ny_11=9 at turn t=11.\n\nH=8 actions: from t=3 to t=10.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nFor example, at the beginning, instead of staying twice, can we stay once?\n\nBut if we stay only once: at t=3, S, then y_4=3 at t=4, τ=1.\n\nThen at t=4, if we do U, y_5=4 at t=5, τ=2, but y=4 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf at t=3, we do U immediately, y_4=4 at t=4, τ=1, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo we must stay at least until τ=3 to be on y=4.\n\nτ=3 is t=6.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=4 at τ=3, but then to y=5, we can go quickly.\n\nIn the above, from t=6 y=4 to t=7 y=5, etc., all safe, but we used two stays at start.\n\nTotal from start to y=9: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, but we took 8 turns because of two stays.\n\nMinimal H might be 8.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, can we be on y=5 at τ=3?\n\ny_6=5 at t=6, τ=3.\n\nThen as before, to have y_6=5, we need to come from y_5.\n\ny_6=5.\n\nAt t=5, τ=2, y_5 must be 4,5, or6.\n\nIf y_5=4, then a_5=U, but y_5=4 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nIf y_5=5, then a_5=S, but y_5=5 at τ=2: is it safe? y=5 at τ=2, safe, but how to be at y_5=5?\n\ny_5=5 at t=5, τ=2.\n\nTo be there, from y_4.\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nAt t=4, τ=1, y_4 must be such that y_5=5.\n\nIf y_4=4, a_4=U, but y_4=4 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nIf y_4=5, a_4=S, but y_4=5 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nIf y_4=6, a_4=D, y_4=6 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nAll not possible.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=5 before τ=3.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nSo the earliest to be on y=4 is τ=3, and then to y=5 at τ=4, etc., up to y=9 at τ=8, t=11.\n\nτ=8 from t=3, t=11.\n\nBut y=9 at t=11.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to go through y=6,7,8, which are safe except at τ=1, but τ=4,5,6,7 are fine.\n\nNow, but at y=8, for example, at τ=7, safe, no problem.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 5, unsafe only at τ=1, so at τ=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, we used actions at t=3 to t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, action to y=9 at t=11.\n\nWe can reach y=9 earlier? For example, if we can be on y=4 earlier, but we can't.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are safe at τ=0, but not accessible.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=0, t=3, y=3, we can move to y=4, but unsafe.\n\nOr, we can move down to y=2, but y=2 at τ=0: freeway 2, span [ -50 +3*0, -39+0] = [-50,-39], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=2, τ=1, freeway y=2 at τ=1: unsafe? Freeway 2 same as 1, unsafe at τ=13-16, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=2, to go to y=9, need 7 up moves, more than 6, so worse.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSimilarly, staying is better than moving down.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems minimal: stay at y=3 for two turns, then up each turn to y=9.\n\nIn terms of actions: from t=3 to t=10 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nt=3: S\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nThen position at t=11 is y=9.\n\nBut at which turn do we reach? At turn t=11.\n\nThe minimal H.\n\nBut let's see if we can save one turn.\n\nFor example, after being at y=4 at t=6, we go up to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=5 is one step, necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=4 later, but that would be later, not earlier.\n\nτ=3 is earliest for y=4.\n\nAnother point: at τ=3, we are on y=4.\n\nThen we go to y=5 at τ=4, which is fine.\n\nBut y=5 can be safe at τ=0, but not possible.\n\nNotice that for y=6,7,8, they are safe at τ=2, but we can't reach them directly.\n\nFor example, to be on y=6 at τ=2, t=5.\n\ny_5=6.\n\nThen at t=5, τ=2, y=6 safe.\n\nBut to be there, from y_4.\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nAt t=4, τ=1, y_4 must be 5,6,7.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 at τ=1 all unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to be on any y=4 to 8 at τ=1 or τ=2 for y=4.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence must have at least two stays to wait until τ=3 to move to y=4.\n\nThen from there, five up moves to go from y=4 to y=9, but at t=6 y=4, then t=7 y=5, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8, t=11 y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need to increase by 5, so at least 5 up moves, which take 5 turns.\n\nPlus the two waits, total 7 actions? Actions from t=3 to t=10 is 8 actions for 8 steps in time.\n\nTime from t=3 to t=11 is 9 turns? No.\n\nTurns: at t=3, position before action.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart: turn t=3, position.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 3.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=3), at turn 4.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nT = t_1 + H for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn minimal time, T min.\n\nSince y from 3 to 9, min T=9 with 6 up moves, but not possible due to cars.\n\nWith delays.\n\nIn our sequence, we reach at T=11, with H=8 actions.\n\nt_1 + H = 3 + H =11, so H=8.\n\nActions at t=3 to t=10.\n\nCan we reach at T=10?\n\nAt turn t=10, y=9.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nTo have y_10=9, y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, a_9=U; if y_9=9, a_9=S or D, but S to stay.\n\nBut we need to reach, so probably from y_8.\n\nSimilarly, y_10=9.\n\nNow, τ for t=10 is τ=7.\n\ny=9 at τ=7, fine.\n\nBut we need y_9.\n\nSuppose y_10=9 from y_9=8 with U.\n\nThen at t=9, y=8 must be safe.\n\nt=9, τ=6, y=8, safe since unsafe only τ=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we need to have y_9=8.\n\ny_9=8 at t=9, τ=6.\n\nTo have that, we need earlier positions.\n\nThe critical point is to pass y=4 early.\n\ny_9=8.\n\nThen y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\netc.\n\nBut y_8 must be 7,8,9.\n\nBut we start from low.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=4 is t=6, as before.\n\nThen at t=6, y=4.\n\nThen t=7, y=5 with U\n\nt=8, y=6 with U\n\nt=9, y=7 with U? If we go up, y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut we want y=9 at t=10, so from y=7 at t=9 to y=9 at t=10, we need to increase by 2 in one step, impossible, since max +1 per action.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, |Δy| <=1, so can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nTherefore, from y=4 at t=6, to y=9 at t=10, that's 4 steps: t=6 to t=7,8,9,10.\n\ny_6=4, y_7, y_8, y_9, y_10.\n\nFrom y_6=4 to y_10=9, need to increase by 5 in 4 steps, so average more than 1, but possible only with all U, but 4 steps, increase by 4, to y=8, not 9.\n\ny_10 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_6=4, y_10=9, so Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 =5\n\nBut each <=1, so sum <=4, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 by t=10 if we start from y=4 at t=6.\n\nEarliest at t=11.\n\nIf we can be on y=4 earlier, but we can't.\n\nTherefore, minimal to reach at t=11.\n\nWith actions as above.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at the beginning.\n\nBut in the action list for the answer.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, we go to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen up to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut let's confirm all positions are safe.\n\nt=3: y=3, τ=0, safe\n\nt=4: y=3, τ=1, freeway 3, safe (unsafe only τ=13-16)\n\nt=5: y=3, τ=2, freeway 3, safe\n\nt=6: y=4, τ=3, freeway 4, safe (τ=3 safe)\n\nt=7: y=5, τ=4, freeway 5, safe (not τ=1)\n\nt=8: y=6, τ=5, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, τ=6, freeway 7, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, τ=7, freeway 8, safe\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, no car.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nAt turn t=3: action S (to stay at y=3 for next position? Action determines next y.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn t, we check based on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn t=3: we are at y=3. We choose a_3=S, so y_4 = y_3 + 0 =3\n\n- Turn t=4: position y=3. We choose a_4=S, so y_5 =3 +0=3\n\n- Turn t=5: position y=3. We choose a_5=U, so y_6 =3+1=4\n\n- Turn t=6: position y=4.

Choose a_9=U, so y_10=8\n\n- Turn t=10: position y=8. Choose a_10=U, so y_11=9\n\nAt turn t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nWe performed actions from t=3 to t=10, 8 actions.\n\nH=8.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1} = a_3 to a_10.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut in the action, for turn t_1 + t, with t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut we don't need action at turn 10 if we reach at turn 10, but at turn 10, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter a_10 at t=10, we go to y_11=9 at turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn t=10, we are at y=8, and we do U to go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nBut the turn when we are at y=9 is t=11.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me check.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=3, reach at turn 3 + H -1 = 3 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 11, so 3 + H -1 =11, so 2 + H =11, H=9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nDefine:\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, total H actions.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 +1.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nThat means after H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + (H-1) with y=9.\n\nIn terms of actions, we perform actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H - 2, to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H - 1, the turn we reach.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions are from t = t_1 to t = T - 1, because action at t determines y_{t+1}, so to have y_T, action at T-1 determines it.\n\nSpecifically, for y_T=9, it is determined by action at T-1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t = t_1 to t = T - 1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t_1 + 1 = T - t_1.\n\nSince T = t_1 + H - 1, then number of actions H = T - t_1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=3, T=11, so H=11-3=8 actions.\n\nActions at t=3 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, we reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the action list: for turn t, we specify a_t.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nIn this case, H=8, t_1=3, so actions at turn 3 to turn 10.\n\nAs above.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have two S at start, but is there a way with only one S?\n\nSuppose at t=3, we do S, so y_4=3.\n\nThen at t=4, we are at y=3, τ=1.\n\nInstead of doing S again, we must do S or something.\n\nIf we do U at t=4, y_5=4, but at t=5, y=4, τ=2, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we do D, y_5=2, then at t=5, y=2, τ=2, freeway 2, safe, but then we are lower, worse.\n\nSo no, must stay twice.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, from t=6 to t=10, we go up each turn, but at t=6, we are at y=4, and we go to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut notice that for y=5,6,7,8, they are safe at all times except τ=1, which is past, so we can go directly.\n\nBut we have to go through them.\n\nIn this sequence, we used U all the way after, but we could have stayed or something, but no need, since safe.\n\nNow, but let's see if we can reach y=9 earlier by skipping some, but we can't.\n\nAnother point: at τ=3, we are on y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at τ=3, but we can't jump.\n\nMinimal steps.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves, 5 turns.\n\nStarting from turn when y=4, which is t=6, to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nCannot faster.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car that is unsafe at τ=9,10,11, but in our case, we are at y=4 at τ=3, early, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence above, actions are:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut at turn 10, we do U, to go to y=11? No.\n\nAt turn 10, position y=8, we do U, so y_{11}=9.\n\nBut we reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the action, for turn 10, we do U.\n\nThe sequence is correct.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nThe player position: from turn 3: y=3\n\nAfter a3=S, turn 4: y=3\n\na4=S, turn 5: y=3\n\na5=U, turn 6: y=4\n\na6=U, turn 7: y=5\n\na7=U, turn 8: y=6\n\na8=U, turn 9: y=7\n\na9=U, turn 10: y=8\n\na10=U, turn 11: y=9\n\nReached at turn 11.\n\nActions from turn 3 to 10.\n\nNow, H=8.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be minimal H, and sequence.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=7?\n\nSuppose H=7, then reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = 3 +7 -1=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, y=9.\n\nThen actions from t=3 to t=8? Actions at t=3 to t= t_1 + H -1 = 3+7-1=9? Let's see.\n\nReach at turn T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nT=9.\n\nThen actions from t = t_1 to t = T -1 =8.\n\nActions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8. 6 actions? H= number of actions.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1, so 9 = 3 + H -1, so 9=2+H, H=7.\n\nActions at t=3 to t=3+6= t=9? t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=3, H=7, so actions at t=3 to 3+6=9, turn 3 to 9.\n\nBut after action at t=9, we are at turn 10.\n\nTo reach at turn 9, we need y_9=9.\n\nAction at t=8 determines y_9.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=8 determine y_4 to y_9.\n\ny_3=3 given.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nSo in 6 steps (from t=3 to t=8 actions), y from 3 to 9, increase by 6, so must all be U, no S or D.\n\nSo actions a3 to a8 all U.\n\nThen:\n\na3=U: y4=4\n\nBut at turn 4, τ=1, y=4, unsafe. Collision at t=4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf any S or D, we cannot reach y=9 in 6 steps from y=3 with only 6 actions? With H=7 actions, we have 6 intervals? From y_3 to y_9, 6 steps.\n\ny_9 = y_3 + sum_{k=3}^{8} Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9, y_3=3, so sum_{k=3}^{8} Δy_k =6\n\nEach Δy <=1, so must all be +1, so all U.\n\nBut then at t=4, y=4, τ=1, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nThus H=7 impossible.\n\nH=8 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (0,-11,right,4) at t=3, which at τ=0,1,2 covers 0, but we avoid by not being there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5,6,7,8, they have cars, but we are on them at τ=4,5,6,7, which are safe.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 at τ=4: the cars are at [ -23 +12*4, -12+48] = [ -23+48=25, -12+48=36]? τ=4.\n\nt=3, τ=0.\n\nAt τ, span: first car [ -23 + 12τ, -12 + 12τ ]\n\nAt τ=4: -23+48=25, -12+48=36, [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [25+48=73,36+48=84], not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAll fine.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is two stays then six ups.\n\nBut in actions: two S, then six U.\n\nNow write.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is \\(H = 8\\). This sequence requires staying at \\(y = 3\\) for two turns to avoid unsafe conditions on higher freeways at early times, then moving up one freeway per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 8 - 1 = 10\\), which corresponds to turn 11 (since \\(t_1 = 3\\)).\n\n### Explanation of the Sequence:\n- **Turns 3 to 4 (τ = 0 to τ = 1)**: The player stays at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid being on freeways \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at τ = 1, where all these freeways are unsafe due to car collisions. Freeway \\(y = 3\\) is safe at τ = 0 and τ = 1.\n- **Turn 5 (τ = 2)**: The player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) at τ = 3 (turn 6), which is safe for freeway \\(y = 4\\) (unsafe at τ = 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 11; safe at τ = 3).\n- **Turns 6 to 10 (τ = 3 to τ = 7)**: The player moves up one freeway per turn to \\(y = 9\\). Freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe only at τ = 1, so they are safe at τ = 3 to 7. Freeway \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is always safe.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Details:\n- **Freeway \\(y = 4\\)**: Unsafe at τ = 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 11. The sequence uses τ = 3 (turn 6), which is safe.\n- **Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)**: Unsafe only at τ = 1. The sequence uses τ = 4 to 7 (turns 7 to 10), which are safe.\n- **Freeway \\(y = 3\\)**: Safe at τ = 0, 1, 2 (turns 3, 4, 5), as unsafe only at τ = 13, 14, 15, 16.\n- **Freeway \\(y = 9\\)**: Always safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are specified for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t\\) ranges from 0 to \\(H-1 = 7\\), i.e., turns 3 to 10.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car spans the x=0 position at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y-position, I'm not considered on that new row until the next turn, so I only check for collisions on the row I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 5. Player is at y=3. I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 5 onwards to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states. Each freeway has cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"right\" means moving right, so for right-moving cars, the span increases with time: [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] for turn T.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be decreasing, but here all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-33, tail τ=-44, direction right, speed s=3. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] = [-44 + 3*(T-5), -33 + 3*(T-5)]\n\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1: [-44 + 3*(T-5), -33 + 3*(T-5)]\n\n- Freeway 3: same: [-44 + 3*(T-5), -33 + 3*(T-5)]\n\n- Freeway 4: three cars:\n\n  - First: h=-28, τ=-39, right, s=4 → span: [-39 + 4*(T-5), -28 + 4*(T-5)]\n\n  - Second: h=8, τ=-3, right, s=4 → span: [-3 + 4*(T-5), 8 + 4*(T-5)]  τ is tail, so for right-moving, it's [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\n  - Third: h=44, τ=33, right, s=4 → [33 + 4*(T-5), 44 + 4*(T-5)] but τ=33, h=44, so [33 + 4*(T-5), 44 + 4*(T-5)]\n\n- Freeway 5: two cars:\n\n  - First: h=12, τ=1, right, s=12 → [1 + 12*(T-5), 12 + 12*(T-5)]\n\n  - Second: h=60, τ=49, right, s=12 → [49 + 12*(T-5), 60 + 12*(T-5)]\n\n- Freeway 6: same as 5: [1 + 12*(T-5), 12 + 12*(T-5)] and [49 + 12*(T-5), 60 + 12*(T-5)]\n\n- Freeway 7: same as 5 and 6\n\n- Freeway 8: same as 5,6,7\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn. That is, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the player starts at y=3 at turn t=5, and we need to go to y=9, which is the top row, so we need to move up through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are no freeways above y=8, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible at y=0 or y=9. But we need to be at (0,9), so when we reach y=9, we're safe.\n\nThe collision only happens on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y_T, and for that y, if there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}. But during the turn, I am still on y_T, so I only check collision for y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I move to a new y at turn T, I arrive at y_{T+1} at the end of the turn, so for collision at turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nYes, so only the current row matters for collision.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=3, I need to increase y by 6, so minimum 6 turns if I go up every turn. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nI need to find a path from y=3 to y=9 in fewest turns, avoiding being on a row when a car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each future turn, when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, find the times T when for some car, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves one row at a time, I need to consider when I am on each row.\n\nLet me denote t_1 = 5, so dt = T - 5 for T >=5.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, find when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nThen for that k, at those T, the row is occupied.\n\nThen for the player, when on row k at turn T, it must not be one of those occupied times.\n\nSince I start at T=5 on y=3.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row the dangerous times.\n\nStart with freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car with span [ -44 + 3*dt, -33 + 3*dt ]\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max:\n\n-44 + 3*dt <= 0 <= -33 + 3*dt\n\nFirst inequality: -44 + 3*dt <= 0 => 3*dt <= 44 => dt <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666, so dt <= 14 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -33 + 3*dt => 3*dt >= 33 => dt >= 11.\n\nSo for dt from 11 to 14 inclusive.\n\ndt = T - 5, so T from 5+11=16 to 5+14=19.\n\nSo on freeway 1, occupied at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car parameters, so also occupied T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 3: same, occupied T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [-39 + 4*dt, -28 + 4*dt]\n\nMin <=0<= max: -39 +4dt <=0 <= -28 +4dt\n\nFirst: -39+4dt <=0 => 4dt <=39 => dt <= 39/4=9.75, dt<=9\n\nSecond: 0<= -28+4dt => 4dt >=28 => dt>=7\n\nSo dt=7,8,9 → T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car on y=4: [-3 +4dt, 8 +4dt]\n\nMin <=0<= max: -3+4dt <=0 <= 8+4dt\n\nFirst: -3+4dt <=0 => 4dt <=3 => dt <= 0.75, since dt integer >=0, dt<=0? dt=0?\n\ndt = T-5, T>=5, dt>=0.\n\n-3+4dt <=0 => 4dt <=3 => dt <= 0.75, so for dt=0, -3 <=0 true, but second part: 0 <= 8 +4dt, which for dt>=0, 8+4dt >=8>0, so always true for dt>=0.\n\nBut min <=0: -3+4dt <=0.\n\nFor dt=0: min = -3 <=0, max=8 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor dt=1: min= -3+4=1 >0? min= -3 +4*1=1, which is >0, so 0 not <= min? min=1, max=12, both >0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly for larger dt.\n\n0 <= max is always true since max=8+4dt >=8>0.\n\nBut min <=0: -3+4dt <=0.\n\n-3+4dt <=0 only if 4dt <=3, dt<=0.75, so only dt=0.\n\ndt=0: min=-3 <=0, max=8>=0, yes.\n\ndt=1: min=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo only at dt=0, T=5.\n\nBut T=5 is current turn? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, for the car, we evaluate at that turn.\n\nFor second car on y=4: at dt=0, T=5, span [-3,8], so 0 is in [-3,8], yes.\n\nFor other dt, no.\n\nThird car on y=4: [33 +4dt, 44 +4dt]\n\nMin=33+4dt >0 for dt>=0, so always min>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 4, dangerous times:\n\n- First car: T=12,13,14\n\n- Second car: T=5\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall for y=4, occupied at T=5 and T=12,13,14.\n\nT=5 is the current turn, but we are at turn T=5, and player is on y=3, not on y=4, so for future turns, we care about T>5.\n\nFor planning, we need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nAt T=5, player is on y=3, so for y=4, at T=5, it is occupied, but since player is not on it, no issue. For future actions, we start from T=6 onwards.\n\nSo for y=4, dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [1 +12dt, 12 +12dt]\n\nMin <=0<= max: 1+12dt <=0 <=12+12dt\n\nBut min=1+12dt >=1>0 for dt>=0, so min>0, so 0 never <= min? 0 <= max always true, but min <=0 is false, so 0 not in span since min>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [49+12dt, 60+12dt], min>0, so never.\n\nSo for y=5, no cars at x=0 ever? But let's check.\n\nMin for first car is 1+12dt, which for dt>=0 is at least 1, so >0, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly for second car.\n\nBut what if dt negative? But dt = T-5 >=0 for T>=5, so no, min >=1 >0.\n\nSo for y=5, no dangerous times, always safe.\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nCar span: at dt=0, first car [1,12], so x=1 to 12, not including 0, so 0 not in span.\n\nAt dt=1, [13,24], etc., all positive, so yes, never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars, both with min>0 and increasing, so yes, never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, cars [1+12dt,12+12dt] and [49+12dt,60+12dt], both min>0, so never at x=0.\n\nFreeway 7: same, never.\n\nFreeway 8: same, never.\n\nBut freeway 8 has cars similar to 5,6,7.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all have cars that start from x=1 or higher, moving right, so x=0 is never occupied.\n\nBut for freeway 4, we have dangerous times at T=12,13,14.\n\nAnd freeway 1,2,3 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\ny=1,2,3 occupied at T=16-19, y=4 occupied at T=12-14.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at T=5.\n\nNow, y=3: freeway 3, which has a car that occupies at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut at T=5, player is on y=3, is it occupied?\n\nFor y=3, freeway 3, car span at dt=0: [-44 +0, -33 +0] = [-44,-33], min=-44<0, max=-33<0? Both negative, so 0 not in [-44,-33], since max=-33<0.\n\nAt T=5, dt=0, span [-44,-33], both negative, so 0 not in span, so y=3 is safe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, for future, occupied only at T=16-19.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path must go through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are always safe, since no cars at x=0 ever.\n\ny=4 is safe except at T=12,13,14.\n\ny=3 is safe except at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut we start at T=5 on y=3, which is safe.\n\nSince y=5 to 8 are always safe, I can move up quickly through them.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so once I'm there, no issue.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so at least 6 moves if all up.\n\nBut I might need to avoid the dangerous times on y=4 and y=3.\n\ny=3 is dangerous only at T=16-19, which is far in the future, T=16 is 11 turns from now (since T=5 to T=16 is 11 steps? T=5 to T=6 is one turn, etc.\n\nCurrent turn T=5, player at y=3.\n\nI want to move up.\n\nBut y=4 is dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nIf I can pass through y=4 before T=12 or after T=14, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, since I start there, I might want to leave before T=16.\n\nBut T=16 is later.\n\nFirst, since y=5 to 8 are always safe, I can go directly to them.\n\nBut I need to go through y=4 to reach y=5.\n\nSo the critical part is y=4.\n\ny=4 is occupied at T=12,13,14, so I should not be on y=4 at those turns.\n\nTherefore, I need to be on y=4 at T not in {12,13,14}.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, dangerous at T=16-19, but since I start at T=5 and want to go up, I probably leave early.\n\nNow, minimal turns: I need to increase y by 6, so H at least 6.\n\nCan I do it in 6 turns?\n\nThat means from T=5 to T=10, y from 3 to 9.\n\nAt T=5: y=3\n\nAction at T=5: I choose a_{t_1} = a_5.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, perform action, then y_{T+1} is set.\n\nStart: turn T=5, y=3.\n\nAfter action, at end of turn, y= y_{6} for turn T=6.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt time T, before action, position y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines delta y for this turn.\n\nThen y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nThen for collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, so we check for y_T at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at T=5, y=3, and we need to check if collision, but as we saw, at T=5, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen I choose action to go to y_6.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T+H, with y_{T+H} =9.\n\nBut since actions are taken, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nTurn indices: from t_1=5, after t actions, at turn 5+t, position y_{5+t}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 5, y=3.\n\nAfter first action (at turn 5), at turn 6, y= y_6.\n\nTo have y_{5+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H=6, so y_{11} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 5: y=3\n\nAfter action a5, at turn 6: y=3 + delta5\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{5+H-1}, at turn 5+H: y=9\n\nSo for H=6, we need to reach y=9 at turn 5+6=11.\n\ny_{11} =9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=6, actions from t=5 to t=10, and y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nAt turn T=5: y=3\n\nT=6: y= ? depends on action\n\n...\n\nT=11: y=9\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\ny=4 dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19\n\nBut for H=6, we finish at T=11, before T=12, so we can avoid the dangerous times easily.\n\ny=4 dangerous only at T=12,13,14, which are after T=11.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 dangerous after T=11.\n\nSo for H=6, we can just go up every turn, and since y=5,6,7,8 are always safe, and y=3 and y=4 are safe at early times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=4: dangerous only at T=12-14, and T=11 is before, so at T=11, if we are on y=4, it should be safe, but we are going to y=9 at T=11? No.\n\nFor H=6, we reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, during the journey:\n\nAt T=5: y=3, safe\n\nAction a5: let's say U, so y6 =4\n\nAt T=6: on y=4, need to check if safe at T=6.\n\nT=6, dt=1, for y=4.\n\nEarlier, y=4 dangerous at T=12,13,14. T=6 is not in that, and at T=5 it was occupied but not now.\n\nAt T=6, dt= T-5=1\n\nFor freeway 4:\n\nFirst car: span [-39 +4*1, -28 +4*1] = [-35,-24], both negative, 0 not in\n\nSecond car: at dt=1, min= -3 +4*1=1, max=8+4=12, [1,12], min>0, 0 not in\n\nThird car: [33+4,44+4]=[37,48], >0, not\n\nSo at T=6, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7: dt=2\n\ny=4: first car [-39+8, -28+8]=[-31,-20] <0, not\n\nSecond car [-3+8,8+8]=[5,16]>0, not\n\nThird [33+8,44+8]=[41,52]>0, not\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly, up to T=11, all before T=12.\n\ny=5 to 8 always safe.\n\nSo if I go up every turn from T=5 to T=10:\n\nAt T=5: action U, go to y=4 at turn 6? Let's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | next y\n\nStart: T=5, y=3\n\nChoose a_5: if U, then y_6 = 4\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, choose a_6: if U, y_7=5\n\nT=7, y=5, a_7: U, y_8=6\n\nT=8, y=6, a_8: U, y_9=7\n\nT=9, y=7, a_9: U, y_10=8\n\nT=10, y=8, a_10: U, y_11=9\n\nAt T=11, y=11=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, when on a row, is it occupied?\n\nT=5: y=3, freeway 3, at dt=0, span [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=6: y=4, as above, at dt=1, safe.\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5, always safe, as min car positions >0.\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nT=11: y=9, not a freeway, no cars.\n\nSo no collisions, and we reached in 6 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=6, which is the theoretical min since dy=6.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there was a car at T=5, but we weren't on it.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=6 we are on y=4, which is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the second car on y=4 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=4 has a car with span [-3,8], which includes 0, so if player were on y=4 at T=5, it would collide, but in this case, player is on y=3 at T=5.\n\nAt T=6, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo with all U actions, we can reach in 6 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=5, so actions from turn 5 to turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=6, actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nEach action U.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut let me make sure about the indices.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=5, H=6.\n\nSo t from 0 to 5.\n\na_{5+0} = a_5\n\na_{5+1} = a_6\n\n...\n\na_{5+5} = a_{10}\n\nAnd y_{5+6} = y_{11} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: all U.\n\nBut is there any reason to do otherwise? For example, if we wait or something, but since we can go directly, H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, no.\n\nFor y=3, it is dangerous at T=16-19, but we are long gone by then.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 1,2,3, it says (-33,-44,right,3), but head and tail, for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail? In the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span becomes [τ + s dt, h + s dt].\n\nIn the data, for freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nNow, h=-33, τ=-44.\n\nSince right-moving, and τ=-44, h=-33, so τ < h, which is consistent, tail left, head right.\n\nAt dt=0, span [τ, h] = [-44, -33], as I had.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4, second car: (8, -3, right, 4), so h=8, τ=-3, so at dt=0, span [-3,8], which includes 0.\n\nBut as we saw, only at T=5.\n\nIn our sequence, we don't hit any danger.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? But from y=3 to y=9, min 6 moves, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1,-1,0.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nThus, the action sequence should be all U from turn 5 to turn 10.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5,6,7,8, cars like (12,1,right,12), so h=12, τ=1, so span [1 +12dt, 12+12dt], which at dt=0 is [1,12], not including 0, and increases, so always min>0.\n\nSimilarly, other car (60,49,right,12), [49,60] to higher, never 0.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6, actions all U.\n\nNow, output:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1 +5} = U\n\nSince H=6, t from 0 to 5, so turns 5 to 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so since t_1=5, it should be Turn 5: U, etc.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from turn 5 to turn 10, which is 6 actions.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 10, action U to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe I can reach earlier? But at turn 5, y=3, after one action at T=5, to y=4 at T=6, then to y=5 at T=7, ..., to y=9 at T=11, so minimum 6 actions to go from 3 to 9.\n\nIf I could move faster, but no, each U only increases by 1.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(T = 5\\).\n- The vertical movement per turn is controlled by actions: \\(U\\) (up, \\(\\Delta y = +1\\)), \\(D\\) (down, \\(\\Delta y = -1\\)), or \\(S\\) (stay, \\(\\Delta y = 0\\)), with \\(y\\) constrained to \\([0, 9]\\).\n- Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway row \\(y = k\\) (for \\(k = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that row has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at that exact turn.\n- The dangerous times (when a car is at \\(x = 0\\)) for each relevant freeway are:\n  - \\(y = 4\\): Occupied at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n  - \\(y = 3\\): Occupied at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n  - \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\): Always safe, as no car spans include \\(x = 0\\) for any \\(T \\geq 5\\).\n- The minimum number of turns to increase \\(y\\) from 3 to 9 is 6, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- A sequence of all \\(U\\) actions from turn 5 to turn 10 achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11:\n  - Turn 5: \\(y = 3\\) → action \\(U\\) → \\(y_6 = 4\\)\n  - Turn 6: \\(y = 4\\) → action \\(U\\) → \\(y_7 = 5\\)\n  - Turn 7: \\(y = 5\\) → action \\(U\\) → \\(y_8 = 6\\)\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 6\\) → action \\(U\\) → \\(y_9 = 7\\)\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 7\\) → action \\(U\\) → \\(y_{10} = 8\\)\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 8\\) → action \\(U\\) → \\(y_{11} = 9\\)\n- Collision checks:\n  - Turn 5 (\\(y = 3\\)): Freeway 3 span at \\(T = 5\\) is \\([-44, -33]\\), which does not contain 0.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=6, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, and for right-moving, it moves right. But looking at the car states, all cars here are right-moving, since direction is \"right\". Let me confirm:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3) — head at -30, tail at -41? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so tail on left. But here, for right-moving, head is greater than tail? Let me see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. So in the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, d, s). But for right-moving, head should be the right end, so h > τ, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 4, for example: (-24, -35, right, 4), so head -24, tail -35. Since -24 > -35, yes, head is right end. Similarly, (12,1,right,4), 12>1, head at 12. Etc.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn. That is, if the car covers position x=0 at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are on y_{T} at turn T, and you only check collision for that freeway at that turn. If you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so you don't check y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSpecifically: at turn T, you are on y_T. If you choose action at T, you move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is the freeway you're on, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nAnd since you move after the collision check, I think. Let me read.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", meaning at turn T, you are on y_T for collision.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9, so I need to move up 5 units. Each up move increases y by 1, down by -1, stay same.\n\nMinimal moves would be 5 up moves, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut since I need to reach exactly (0,9), and y=9 is the goal, which is above the freeways, so no cars on y=0 or y=9, I assume. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point sometimes, but here I'm at (0,4), so y=4 has cars? Freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, but y=4 is a freeway, yes.\n\ny=1 to 8 are freeways with cars, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so when I'm on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn the player position, I'm at (0,y), so x is always 0, I think. The grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, I assume, since actions are U,D,S, changing y.\n\nAnd cars are on horizontal freeways, moving horizontally.\n\nSo for collision, only when I'm on a freeway row, and at x=0, a car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nNow, I start at t=6, position (0,4). I need to get to (0,9).\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I just need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H is 5 if I can go up 5 times without collision.\n\nBut I need to check for each freeway I cross, whether at the time I'm on it, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nI will be on y=4 at t=6, then if I go up, at t=7 I'm on y=5, and so on, up to y=9.\n\nBut I need to check for each y from 4 to 8, since y=4 I'm on at t=6, and if I go up each turn, at t=7 on y=5, t=8 on y=6, t=9 on y=7, t=10 on y=8, t=11 on y=9. So turns 6 to 10 on freeways y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=4 at t=6, y=5 at t=7, ..., y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, for each of these, I need that at that turn, for that freeway, no car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t1 = 6.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T (T >= t1) is given by the update.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] since t1=6.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving, the span is [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] with left end τ + s(T-6), right end h + s(T-6).\n\n0 is covered if τ + s(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s(T-6)\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h=-30, τ=-41, d=right, s=3)\n\nAt time T, span: [ -41 + 3(T-6), -30 + 3(T-6) ]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 3(T-6) <= 0 <= -30 + 3(T-6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-30,-41,right,3) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nAll freeways 1,2,3 have the same car? No, different freeways, each has its own cars.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nFreeway 2 has one car: (-30,-41,right,3) — same parameters, but on different row, so it's a different car, but same position at t=6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 same.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars: (-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4)\n\nFreeway 5: (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (24,13,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have two cars: one at (24,13,right,12) and one at (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nNow, I need to check for each freeway y and time T when I might be on it, whether 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's consider the direct path: start at t=6, y=4.\n\nAt t=6, on y=4. Freeway 4 has cars.\n\nFor freeway 4 at time T=6:\n\nCar 1: (-24,-35,right,4), at T=6, span: [ -35 + 4(0), -24 + 4(0) ] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 in [-35,-24]? -35 <= 0 <= -24? 0 > -24? -24 is negative, so 0 not <= -24, so no.\n\nCar 2: (12,1,right,4), span at T=6: [1 + 0, 12 + 0] = [1,12], 0 in [1,12]? 0 < 1, no.\n\nCar 3: (48,37,right,4), [37,48], 0 not in, since 0<37.\n\nSo at t=6, on y=4, no car covers x=0. Good.\n\nNow, if I go up, at t=7, on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=7.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nAt T=7, time from t1=6, Δt=1.\n\nCar1: (24,13,right,12), span: [13 + 12(1), 24 + 12(1)] = [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36]\n\n0 in [25,36]? no.\n\nCar2: (-48,-59,right,12), span: [-59 + 12(1), -48 + 12(1)] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36]\n\n0 in [-47,-36]? -47 <= 0 <= -36? 0 > -36? -36 negative, 0 not <= -36, since -36 <0, so 0 not in interval. [-47,-36] all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=7, y=5, no collision.\n\nNow t=8, on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=8.\n\nFreeway 6 has same cars as 5, but on different row.\n\nCar1: (24,13,right,12), at T=8, Δt=2, span: [13 + 12*2, 24 + 12*2] = [13+24,24+24] = [37,48]\n\n0 not in.\n\nCar2: (-48,-59,right,12), span: [-59 + 24, -48 + 24] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 in [-35,-24]? no, all negative.\n\nGood.\n\nt=9, on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=9.\n\nCars: same, (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nΔt=3, car1: [13+36, 24+36] = [49,60]\n\ncar2: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in either.\n\nt=10, on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=10.\n\nΔt=4, car1: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72]\n\ncar2: [-59+48,-48+48]=[-11, 0]\n\ncar2 span: [-11, 0]\n\n0 in [-11,0]? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 <= 0 is true, so 0 is included.\n\nSo at t=10, on y=8, car2 covers x=0, since span is [-11,0], so collision.\n\nTherefore, if I go directly up, at t=10 when I reach y=8, I collide with the car on freeway 8.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could wait or go down to avoid this collision.\n\nSince I need to go to y=9, and y=8 is the last freeway, I might need to be on y=8 at a different time when no car covers 0.\n\nOr I could skip y=8 by going directly to y=9 from y=7, but I can only move one step per turn, so I have to pass through y=8.\n\nUnless I stay or something.\n\nBut I have to be on y=8 at some point to go up to y=9.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, so I must be on it at some turn.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this case, at t=10, y=8 is occupied.\n\nSo I need to adjust my path.\n\nI could delay going up or go down first.\n\nFor example, at t=6, I could stay or go down, then go up later.\n\nBut that might increase H.\n\nMinimal H is 5, but with collision, so I need at least 6 turns or more.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=6 to t=6+H-1, and at t=6+H-1, y=9.\n\nIf I start at t=6, after H turns, I am at turn t=6+H-1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, so H actions, from time t to t+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have moved H steps in time.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at position for that turn.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I am at y_t, then I choose action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, collision is checked based on y_t.\n\nThen for the next turn.\n\nSo for a sequence of H actions, starting from t=6, I perform actions a_6, a_7, ..., a_{6+H-1}, and after that, I am at y_{6+H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{6+H} = 9.\n\nSince I start at y_6=4, after H actions, I am at y_{6+H}.\n\nSet y_{6+H} =9.\n\nThe number of turns covered: from t=6 to t=6+H-1, I take actions, and at t=6+H, I am at position.\n\nBut at t=6+H, I don't take action, I am just at the position.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, I reach (0,9).\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1 + 0 to t1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at position, but the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd actions from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, then at turn t1, after action, y_{t1} = y_{t1} + Δy, but initial position is at turn t1, before action.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at (0, y_{t1}), then I take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am at y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nI reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1, meaning that at that turn, before action or after?\n\nThe position is given for turn t, before the action for that turn.\n\nLet's see the game dynamics.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nThen I choose a_t, which sets Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nI reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1, which means that at that turn, y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nAnd actions from t1 to t1 + H -1 are taken.\n\nFor H turns of actions, I am at turn t1 + H -1 after H-1 steps? Let's think.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, position y_{t1+2}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut I need to reach at turn t1 + H -1, which is before the last action.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t1 + H -1}, and I want this to be 9.\n\nThen I take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which might move me, but the position at that turn is y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThe reaching is at the start of the turn, before action.\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd actions are taken from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I start at t1, y_t1, and I want to be at y=9 at the same turn, but if y_t1 !=9, I need to take actions to move there.\n\nIn this case, at t=6, y=4, not 9, so I need to take some actions to reach y=9 at some later turn.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 5, if I go up each time, I can be at y=9 at turn t=6+5=11, with actions from t=6 to t=10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=6, y=4.\n\nAfter action a6, at t=7, y= y6 + Δy6.\n\nIf a6=U, then at t=7, y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up 5 times: actions at t=6,7,8,9,10: all U.\n\nThen at turn t=6: y=4\n\nt=7: y=5\n\nt=8: y=6\n\nt=9: y=7\n\nt=10: y=8\n\nt=11: y=9\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=6, so at turn t=6 + H -1 =9, for example? Let's set T = t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIf T=9, y_T=9, so at turn 9, y=9.\n\nBut from above, with up moves, at turn 9, y=7 if I start at t=6.\n\nAt t=6: y=4\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=6, y=4\n\nAfter 1 action (a6), at t=7, y=5\n\nAfter 2 actions (a6,a7), at t=8, y=6\n\nAfter 3 actions, t=9, y=7\n\nAfter 4 actions, t=10, y=8\n\nAfter 5 actions, t=11, y=9\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, I need T such that after (T - t1) actions, but the turn number is t1 + number of actions.\n\nAt turn t1, after 0 actions.\n\nAt turn t1+k, after k actions.\n\nPosition at turn t is after (t - t1) actions from start.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t, there are (t - t1) actions taken? No.\n\nAt turn t1, before any action, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nI need at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for T, y_T =9.\n\nThe number of actions from t1 to T-1, so that after those actions, at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nActions from t1 to T-1 determine y_T.\n\ny_T depends on actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_T = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t=T-1.\n\nAnd each Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nI need y_T =9, y_{t1}=4, so net change +5, so sum of Δy from t=6 to t=T-1 must be +5.\n\nThe number of actions is from t1 to T-1, which is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1 actions.\n\nFor example, from t=6 to t=T-1, actions at times 6,7,8,...,T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: (T-1) - 6 +1 = T-6.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T = y6 + sum_{t=6 to T-1} Δy_t.\n\nSet y_T=9, y6=4, so sum Δy =5.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so minimal number of actions is 5, with all U, so T-6 =5, so T=11.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=6 to t=10, 5 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H actions, times from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen at turn (t1 + H -1) + something? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1}, which is before the H-th action.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} depends on the first H-1 actions.\n\nFrom t1 to t1+H-2 actions determine y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nLet k = H-1, number of actions to reach the position.\n\nEasier to think of the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nSet T such that at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1.\n\nActions are from t1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nH = number of actions = T - t1.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1, so H = T - t1 +1.\n\nFor example, if I reach at turn t1, y=9, then H=1, actions at t1, but if y_t1=9, a_t1 could be S or something, but in this case y_t1=4≠9.\n\nMinimal T: since I need to increase by 5, T min = t1 +5 =11, with actions at t=6 to10 all U, y at t=11 is 9.\n\nAt turn T=11, y=9.\n\nThen H = T - t1 +1 =11-6+1=6 actions? Let's see.\n\nT = t1 + H -1, so 11 =6 + H -1, so H=6.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=6+5=11? t1 to t1+H-1=6 to 11? H-1=5, so t=6 to 10.\n\nYes, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10, all U, then at t=11, y=9.\n\nAnd at turn t=11, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut during the path, at t=10, y=8, which had collision as we saw.\n\nWith all U, at t=10, on y=8, collision with car on freeway 8.\n\nSpecifically, at t=10, for freeway 8, car2 span [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nOr I could go slower or faster.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the coverage changes with time.\n\nFor freeway 8, cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSpan for car2: at time T, [ -59 + 12(T-6), -48 + 12(T-6) ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12(T-6) <= 0 <= -48 + 12(T-6)\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: -59 +12(T-6) <= 0 => 12(T-6) <= 59 => T-6 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T-6 <=4 since T integer, T<=10\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +12(T-6) => 48 <= 12(T-6) => 4 <= T-6 => T >=10\n\nSo from T>=10 and T<=10, so only at T=10, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, car1: [13 +12(T-6), 24+12(T-6)] = [12(T-6)+13, 12(T-6)+24]\n\n0 <= 12(T-6)+13? 12(T-6)+13 >=13>0, always positive, so 0 not <= right end? 0 <= right end is true since right end large, but left end 12(T-6)+13 >=13>0, so 0 < left end, not covered. So car1 never covers 0.\n\nOnly car2 covers 0 at T=10 on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but in the direct path, only y=8 at t=10 is problem.\n\nFor y=4 at t=6, we saw no problem.\n\ny=5 at t=7: freeway 5, cars as above, at t=7, spans [25,36] and [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\ny=6 at t=8: similar, [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\ny=7 at t=9: [49,60] and [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ny=8 at t=10: [61,72] and [-11,0], 0 in [-11,0].\n\nSo only issue at t=10 on y=8.\n\nI need to not be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nI could be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I arrive earlier or later.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=8: if I go up fast.\n\nFrom y=4, if I go up each turn, at t=10 y=8, as above.\n\nI can be earlier? At t=6 y=4, t=7 y=5, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8. So t=10 is the earliest for y=8.\n\nLater: if I delay, I can be on y=8 later.\n\nAt t=10, it is covered, but at other times?\n\nFor freeway 8, car2 covers 0 only at T=10, as above.\n\nT=10 only.\n\nAt T=9: car2 span: -59 +12(3) = -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, so [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=11: -59+12(5)= -59+60=1, -48+60=12, so [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not in, since left end 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, other times not covered.\n\nSo only at T=10, freeway 8 has car covering 0.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on y=8 at turn 10.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some other turn, say earlier or later.\n\nBut earlier, at t=9, y=8? From y=4 at t=6, to y=8 at t=9: that would require 4 up moves in 3 actions? From t=6 to t=9, 3 actions: if all U, at t=9 y=7, not 8.\n\ny at turn t: after actions from 6 to t-1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\ny_t = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{t-1} Δy_k\n\nSet y_t =8 for some t.\n\ny6=4, so need sum Δy from 6 to t-1 =4.\n\nEach |Δy|<=1, so min t-6 actions to increase by 4, so at t=10, y=8 with 4 up moves? Let's compute.\n\nAt t=6, y=4\n\nAfter actions:\n\nIf a6=U, t=7 y=5\n\na7=U, t=8 y=6\n\na8=U, t=9 y=7\n\na9=U, t=10 y=8\n\nSo y=8 at t=10.\n\nTo have y=8 earlier, impossible since only one move per turn.\n\nLater: at t=11, y=8 if I don't move up, but I need to reach y=9, so I might stay or something.\n\nBut at t=11, on y=8, what is the car span?\n\nAt T=11, freeway 8 car2: [ -59+12(5), -48+12(5)] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, car1 [13+60,24+60]=[73,84], not.\n\nSo at t=11, on y=8 is safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI could go up to y=7, then wait or something.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 with minimal delay.\n\nSince at t=10 on y=8 is bad, I can avoid being there at t=10.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=8 at t=11 or later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list the times when each freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nBut freeways have different cars, so I need for each y, the times T when no car covers 0.\n\nFirst, freeway y=4: at T=6, we saw no coverage.\n\nAt other times? But I am at y=4 only at t=6 if I move up immediately.\n\nIf I stay, I could be on y=4 at later times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should move up as much as possible, but avoid the collision point.\n\nNow, for freeway 4: cars (-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4)\n\nAt time T, span:\n\nCar1: [-35 +4(T-6), -24 +4(T-6)]\n\n0 in: -35+4Δt <=0<= -24+4Δt, Δt=T-6\n\n-35+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <=35/4=8.75, Δt<=8\n\n0<= -24+4Δt => 4Δt >=24 => Δt >=6\n\nSo for Δt=6 to 8, T=12 to 14? Δt=T-6, so T-6=6,7,8, T=12,13,14\n\nAt T=12: car1 span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 covered? -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nT=13: [-35+28,-24+28]=[-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: [-35+32,-24+32]=[-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15: [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut car1 is only one car.\n\nCar2: (12,1,right,4), span [1+4Δt, 12+4Δt], since τ=1, h=12? Earlier (head h, tail τ), so for right, span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [1 +4Δt, 12+4Δt]\n\nLeft end 1+4Δt >=1>0, so 0 never in, since min left is 1.\n\nSimilarly car3: [37+4Δt,48+4Δt] >=37>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only car1 can cover 0, at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut at T=6, which is Δt=0, not covered, as before.\n\nSimilarly, other times not covered.\n\nFor freeway 5: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nCar1: [13+12Δt, 24+12Δt] >=13>0, never covers 0.\n\nCar2: [-59+12Δt, -48+12Δt]\n\n0 in: -59+12Δt <=0 <= -48+12Δt\n\nLeft: -59+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/12=4.916, Δt<=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+12Δt => 12Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt=4, T=10\n\nAt T=10, car2 span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nOther times not.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6, same cars, same as freeway 5, covers only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 7, same, only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8, same, only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 1: car (-30,-41,right,3)\n\n[ -41 +3Δt, -30 +3Δt]\n\n0 in: -41+3Δt <=0 <= -30+3Δt\n\nLeft: 3Δt <=41, Δt<=13.666, Δt<=13\n\nRight: 0 <= -30+3Δt, 3Δt >=30, Δt>=10\n\nSo for Δt=10 to 13, T=16 to 19.\n\nBut at current times, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 and 3 same.\n\nBut for our path, we only care about the freeways we cross.\n\nNow back to reaching y=9.\n\nI start at y=4 at t=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical point is that I must not be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nSince only at t=10, y=8 is occupied.\n\nOther times, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways are safe at the times in direct path except y=8 at t=10.\n\nIn direct path: y=4 at t=6 safe, y=5 at t=7 safe, y=6 at t=8 safe, y=7 at t=9 safe, y=8 at t=10 unsafe.\n\ny=9 at t=11 safe.\n\nI can, for example, stay at y=7 for one turn, then go to y=8 at t=11, then to y=9 at t=12.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, go up to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=9.\n\nNow at t=9, I am on y=7.\n\nIf I go up, to y=8 at t=10, but unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=9, I stay, so a9=S, then at t=10, still y=7.\n\nThen at t=10, I go up to y=8 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=8, which is safe, as at T=11, car span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThen at t=11, I go up to y=9 at t=12.\n\nThen at t=12, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at which turn do I reach y=9? At t=12.\n\nT=12, so t1 + H -1 =12, t1=6, so 6 + H -1=12, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=11? t1 to t1+H-1=6 to 6+6=12? H=7, t1+H-1=6+6=12? 6+7-1=12, yes.\n\nActions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=6: start y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=7, action S (stay), so y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=12\n\nAt t=12, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=6: y=4, freeway 4, as before, no car at 0, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5, at T=7, spans [25,36] and [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, similar, [37,48] and [-35,-24], safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7, [49,60] and [-23,-12], safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7, at T=10, Δt=4, car1: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72], car2: [-59+48,-48+48]=[-11,0], but I am on y=7, not y=8, so no collision, since collision only for the freeway I am on.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=7, freeway 7, cars: at T=10, Δt=4, car1: [13+48=61,24+48=72], car2: [-59+48=-11, -48+48=0], so span [-11,0], which covers 0? But I am on freeway 7, and for freeway 7, at T=10, car2 span [-11,0], so 0 is covered.\n\nOh no! I forgot that freeway 7 also has the same cars and at T=10, it covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for all y=5,6,7,8 at T=10, the second car covers 0.\n\nFor freeway 5 at T=10: car2 span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], covers 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 at T=10: same.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=10: same, car2 [-11,0], covers 0.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=10: same.\n\nSo at T=10, for any freeway y=5,6,7,8, the second car covers x=0.\n\nTherefore, at t=10, if I am on any of y=5,6,7,8, I will collide.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3,4, at T=10, let's see.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=10: Δt=4, cars:\n\nCar1: [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [1+16,12+16]=[17,28], not\n\nCar3: [37+16,48+16]=[53,64], not\n\nSo no coverage at T=10 for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 at T=10: Δt=4, car [ -41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3 same.\n\nSo at T=10, only freeways y=5,6,7,8 have coverage at x=0.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 are safe at t=10.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe at t=10.\n\nIn my earlier plan, at t=10, I was on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=5,6,7, or 8 at turn t=10.\n\nThat means at turn 10, I must be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, but I may not be there yet.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4 are below.\n\nIn the sequence above, I need to avoid being on mid freeways at t=10.\n\nI could be on y=4 at t=10, for example.\n\nOr y=3, etc.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: to go from y=4 to y=9, need net +5.\n\nWith delay, H>5.\n\nFor example, I can stay at y=4 for some turns, or go down and come back, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince at t=10, y=5-8 are bad, I should be on y=4 or below at t=10, or on y=9.\n\nBut at t=10, y=9 might not be reachable yet from y=4.\n\nEarliest to y=9 is t=11 with all U.\n\nAt t=11, y=9 is safe.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 by t=11, but to be at y=9 at t=11, I need actions from t=6 to t=10 all U, but at t=10 I am on y=8, which is unsafe if I am on it, but at t=10, with all U, I am on y=8 at t=10, which is unsafe.\n\nConflict.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=11, I must be at y=8 at t=10, which is unsafe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=8 at t=10 to then go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=10, when I am on y=8, collision occurs.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 at t=11 with the direct path.\n\nI need to arrive later.\n\nFor example, reach at t=12.\n\nThen at turn t=12, y=9.\n\nT=12, so t1 + H -1 =12, 6 + H -1=12, H=7.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=11.\n\nNow, I need y_{12} =9.\n\ny6=4, so sum of Δy from t=6 to t=11 must be +5.\n\n6 actions: t=6 to t=11 actions, 6 actions for 5 net up, so I need 5 up and one stay or down, but net +5, so if all U except one S, or U and D, but D would require extra U, so better to have one stay.\n\nFor example, 5 U and one S in the sequence.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, I must not be on those y.\n\nPossible positions at t=10: y=0 to 4 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 at t=10: from y=4, to y=9 in 4 actions? Impossible, min 5 actions to increase by 5.\n\nWith actions from t=6 to t=9 (4 actions), I can be at y=8 at t=10? At t=10, position after actions to t=9.\n\ny at turn t depends on actions to t-1.\n\nAt turn t=10, y_10 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{9} Δy_k\n\ny6=4, so y_10 = 4 + sum_{k=6 to 9} Δy_k\n\nMax y_10 = 4 +4 =8 if all U.\n\nMin y_10=4-4=0 if all D.\n\nSo at t=10, y_10 between 0 and 8.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be below 0 or above 8 at t=10.\n\nSo at t=10, y_10 must be 0,1,2,3, or 4 to be safe.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 unsafe at t=10.\n\ny=4 is safe at t=10, as we saw earlier.\n\ny=3,2,1,0 also safe, but y=0 might be edge.\n\ny=0 is not freeway, no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nBut at t=10, y cannot be 9.\n\nSo to be safe at t=10, I must have y_10 <=4.\n\nThat is, position at turn 10 must be y=4 or less.\n\nSince y=4 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, y=9.\n\nSo actions from t=6 to t=11.\n\n6 actions.\n\nNet increase +5, so I need five U and one S, or other combinations, but to minimize time, probably five U and one S.\n\nThe S can be at some point.\n\nNow, at t=10, I need y_10 <=4.\n\ny_10 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{9} Δy_k = 4 + sum of four actions: Δy6, Δy7, Δy8, Δy9\n\nI need y_10 <=4.\n\nSince y6=4, I need sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k <=0.\n\nThat is, the net change from t=6 to t=9 must be <=0.\n\nAfter that, from t=10 and t=11, I need to go up to y=12? No.\n\ny at turn 12: y_12 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{11} Δy_k\n\nSet y_12=9, so 4 + sum_{k=6 to11} Δy_k =9, so sum_{k=6 to11} Δy_k =5.\n\nNow, sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k + Δy10 + Δy11 =5.\n\nBut sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k <=0, from y_10 <=4.\n\nSet S = sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k <=0.\n\nThen S + Δy10 + Δy11 =5.\n\nSince S <=0, and Δy10 <=1, Δy11<=1, so S + Δy10 + Δy11 <= 0 +1 +1 =2 <5, which is less than 5, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nS <=0, Δy10 <=1, Δy11 <=1, so S + Δy10 + Δy11 <= 2, but we need =5, impossible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot have y_12=9 with y_10 <=4.\n\nBecause the increase from t=10 to t=12 is at most 2 (two up moves), but y_10 <=4, so y_12 <=6 <9.\n\ny_12 = y_10 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\ny_10 <=4, Δy10 <=1, Δy11 <=1, so y_12 <=6 <9.\n\nBut I need y_12=9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 at turn 12 with y_10 <=4.\n\nBut at t=10, I must have y_10 <=4 to be safe, but then I can only reach y=12 at most 6, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\ny_12 = y_10 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\ny_10 <=4, so y_12 <=4 +1 +1=6 <9, so indeed, if y_10 <=4, y_12 <=6, cannot reach 9 at t=12.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=12, I need y_12=9, which requires that after actions to t=11, but y_12 depends on actions to t=11.\n\ny_12 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{11} Δy_k\n\nWith 6 actions, sum Δy =5, so possible with five U and one S, for example.\n\nThen y_12=9.\n\nBut at turn t=10, y_10 must be <=4 for safety.\n\ny_10 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{9} Δy_k = 4 + sum of first 4 actions (k=6,7,8,9)\n\nSet S4 = sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k\n\nThen y_10 = 4 + S4\n\nNeed y_10 <=4, so S4 <=0.\n\nThen y_12 = y_10 + Δy10 + Δy11 = (4 + S4) + Δy10 + Δy11\n\nBut y_12 =9, so 4 + S4 + Δy10 + Δy11 =9\n\nThus S4 + Δy10 + Δy11 =5\n\nBut S4 <=0, Δy10 <=1, Δy11 <=1, so S4 + Δy10 + Δy11 <= 0 +1 +1 =2 <5, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=12 with y_10 <=4.\n\nBut I must have y_10 <=4 to avoid collision at t=10, since if y_10 >=5, and at t=10, if y_10 in 5-8, collision.\n\ny_10=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at t=10.\n\ny_10=4 safe, y_10<4 also safe.\n\nBut if y_10=4, then y_12 <=6, not 9.\n\nSo for t=12, I cannot reach y=9 if I require y_10<=4.\n\nPerhaps I can reach later.\n\nTry t=13.\n\nReach at turn 13, y=9.\n\nThen T=13, t1 + H -1=13, 6+H-1=13, H=8.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=12.\n\n7 actions for net +5, so I can have five U and two S, for example.\n\nAt t=10, I need y_10 <=4.\n\ny_10 =4 + S4, S4 = sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k\n\nNeed S4 <=0 so y_10<=4.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=13, I have actions at t=10,11,12.\n\ny_13 = y_10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\ny_13=9, so y_10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 =9\n\nSince y_10 <=4, and Δy <=1 each, so y_10 +3 <=7 <9 if y_10<=4, still not enough.\n\ny_10 <=4, then y_13 <=4 +1+1+1=7<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf I reach at later turn, say T, then from t=10 to T, I have (T - 10) actions, each can increase y by at most 1, so y_T <= y_10 + (T - 10)\n\nBut y_10 <=4, so y_T <=4 + (T - 10)\n\nI need y_T=9, so 4 + (T-10) >=9, so T-10 >=5, T>=15.\n\nThen at T=15, y_T <=4 + (15-10) =9, so possible if y_10=4 and all up from there.\n\nBut T=15, late.\n\nH will be large.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to be on y=9 at t=10, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: I could be on a safe freeway at t=10.\n\nFor example, on y=4 at t=10.\n\ny=4 at t=10 is safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at t=10, I need to not move up much from start.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=4, I stay or go down.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nLet's find a sequence.\n\nFirst, I must avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=10.\n\nSo at t=10, be on y=4 or below.\n\nSay on y=4 at t=10.\n\nThen from t=10, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns from y=4 to y=9 is 5, so at turn t=15, y=9.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=14 all U, then at t=15 y=9.\n\nBut at t=10, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, how to be on y=4 at t=10.\n\nFrom t=6 to t=10, 4 actions (t=6,7,8,9) to reach y_10.\n\ny_10 =4 + sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k\n\nI want y_10=4, so sum Δy from t=6 to9 =0.\n\nSo I can do, for example, all S, or two U and two D, etc., but to save time, all S.\n\nOr mix.\n\nBut all S: at t=6, S, y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7, S, y=4 at t=8\n\nt=8, S, y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9, S, y=4 at t=10\n\nThen at t=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=10, action U, to y=5 at t=11\n\nt=11, U, to y=6 at t=12\n\nt=12, U, to y=7 at t=13\n\nt=13, U, to y=8 at t=14\n\nt=14, U, to y=9 at t=15\n\nReach at t=15.\n\nH: T=15, t1+H-1=15, 6+H-1=15, H=10.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nBut this is slow, H=10.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nSince I need to be at y=9, and at t=10 I must be low, but perhaps I can be on y=3 or something at t=10, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: go down first to avoid, then up.\n\nBut going down might save time? Unlikely.\n\nOr, at t=10, be on y=0, for example.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but then from there to y=9 takes 9 turns, worse.\n\nSo best to be on y=4 at t=10.\n\nBut with all S from t=6 to t=9, I waste 4 turns.\n\nI can move up a bit before t=10, but then y_10 might be higher than 4.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=5 at some point, but then at t=10, if I am on y=5, it is unsafe, so I need to be at y=4 or below at t=10.\n\nSo I cannot be above y=4 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, from t=6 to t=9, I must have net zero change or negative, so that y_10=4 or less.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, I need to start going up after t=10.\n\nBut min from y=4 is 5 turns to y=9, so reach at t=15 as above.\n\nBut let's check if I can be on y=8 at a safe time.\n\nFor example, on y=8 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, freeway 8 is safe, as car2 span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at other times.\n\nSo if I can be on y=8 at t=11, then go to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=11, I need to arrive from below.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=6, to y=8 at t=11.\n\nThat requires 4 up moves in 5 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=11, y_11 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{10} Δy_k =4 + sum of 5 actions.\n\nSet y_11=8, so 4 + S5 =8, S5=4, so net +4 in 5 actions, so I can have four U and one S, for example.\n\nThen at t=11, y=8.\n\nThen at t=11, action U, to y=9 at t=12.\n\nReach at t=12.\n\nNow, at t=10, where am I?\n\ny_10 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{9} Δy_k\n\nWith 5 actions from k=6 to10 for y_11, but y_10 depends on actions to t=9.\n\nActions at t=6,7,8,9,10 for y_11.\n\ny_10 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{9} Δy_k\n\nI need y_11=8, so 4 + sum_{k=6 to10} Δy_k =8, so sum_{k=6 to10} Δy_k =4.\n\nLet S5 = sum_{k=6 to10} Δy_k =4.\n\nThen y_10 =4 + sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k\n\nBut sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k is part of S5.\n\nS5 = Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 =4\n\ny_10 =4 + (Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9)\n\nFrom S5, (Δy6+Δy7+Δy8+Δy9) + Δy10 =4\n\nSo y_10 =4 + (4 - Δy10) = 8 - Δy10\n\nSince S5 - Δy10 = sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k\n\ny_10 =4 + (S5 - Δy10) =4 +4 - Δy10 =8 - Δy10\n\nΔy10 is -1,0,1, so y_10 =8 - (-1) =9 if Δy10=D, or 8-0=8 if S, or 8-1=7 if U.\n\nBut y cannot be 9 at t=10, as earlier.\n\nPossible y_10 =7,8, or 9, but 9 impossible, so y_10=7 or 8.\n\nBut at t=10, y=7 or 8 is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nFor example, if Δy10 = U, then y_10=7\n\nIf Δy10 = S, y_10=8\n\nIf Δy10 = D, y_10=9 impossible.\n\nSo y_10 is either 7 or 8, both of which are in 5-8, so at t=10, on y=7 or 8, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at t=11 without being on a bad y at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nTo avoid t=10, I need to be on a safe y at t=10, like y=4.\n\nThen reach later.\n\nBut let's list all possible safe paths.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=3 or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since the cars are moving, for freeways 5-8, at t=10 it is bad, but at other times good.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=5 at t=7, which is safe, as in direct path.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I am on y=5 at t=7, then I need to move to higher y, but at t=10, I must not be on y=5-8.\n\nSo I need to be on y=9 before t=10 or after, but before impossible, so after.\n\nOr be below at t=10.\n\nSo let's accept that I need to be low at t=10.\n\nFor example, be on y=4 at t=10.\n\nThen from t=10, go up to y=9 in 5 turns, reach at t=15.\n\nBut to be on y=4 at t=10, with net zero change from t=6 to t=9.\n\nI can do actions that keep me at y=4 or move down and up, but net zero.\n\nFor example, at t=6, go down to y=3 at t=7, then up to y=4 at t=8, etc., but that might take more actions.\n\nTo save time, best to stay at y=4 from t=6 to t=10.\n\nBut from t=6 to t=10, at turn t=10, I am on y=4, which requires actions from t=6 to t=9 all S or equivalent.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=14 all U, to reach y=9 at t=15.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up after t=10, but I can go up before if I can be below at t=10.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=6, I go down to y=3 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways y=1 to 8, y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt t=7, on y=3, freeway 3, cars: (-30,-41,right,3), at T=7, Δt=1, span [-41+3, -30+3] = [-38,-27], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can stay or go up.\n\nBut I need to be at y<=4 at t=10.\n\nIf at t=7 y=3, I can go up to y=4 at t=8, then stay or something.\n\nBut let's calculate y at t=10.\n\nSuppose I want to minimize the reach turn.\n\nSet T the reach turn, y_T=9.\n\nAt t=10, y_10 must be <=4.\n\nThen y_T = y_10 + sum_{k=10}^{T-1} Δy_k\n\ny_T=9, y_10<=4, so 9 <= 4 + (T - 10) *1, since each action can increase by at most 1, so T-10 >=5, T>=15.\n\nEquality if y_10=4 and all U from t=10 to t=14.\n\nThen T=15.\n\nIf y_10<4, T>15.\n\nSo minimal T is 15, with y_10=4 and all U from there.\n\nNow, to have y_10=4, with y_6=4, so from t=6 to t=9, 4 actions, sum Δy =0.\n\nSo I can do all S, or other combinations with net zero.\n\nFor example, all S: actions S at t=6,7,8,9.\n\nThen at t=10, y=4.\n\nThen actions U at t=10,11,12,13,14 to go to y=5,6,7,8,9 at t=15.\n\nReach at t=15.\n\nH: T=15, t1+H-1=15, 6+H-1=15, H=10.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut we need to output actions until reach turn.\n\nAt turn 14, action U, to y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut we reach at turn 15, so actions up to t=14.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nAt t=6: y=4, freeway 4, T=6, safe as before.\n\nt=7: after action S, still y=4?

Inconsistency.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H, number of actions is H.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with actions at t=6 to t=14, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =6+9-1=14, position y_14.\n\nIn the sequence, after action at t=14, y_15=9, so at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut we reach at turn t1+H-1=14? y_14.\n\nIn this case, at turn 14, y_14=8, not 9.\n\nAfter action at t=14, y_15=9, so at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is turn 15, which is t1 + H -1 only if H is defined properly.\n\nSet: actions at times: let's list the turns.\n\nStart: turn 6, y=4\n\nAction a6: if S, then turn 7, y=4\n\na7: S, turn 8, y=4\n\na8: S, turn 9, y=4\n\na9: S, turn 10, y=4\n\na10: U, turn 11, y=5\n\na11: U, turn 12, y=6\n\na12: U, turn 13, y=7\n\na13: U, turn 14, y=8\n\na14: U, turn 15, y=9\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9, reached.\n\nThe actions are from t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9, since actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, so 6 to 6+H-1, number of actions H.\n\nThen reach at turn (6 + H -1) =6+9-1=14, but at turn 14, y=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nThe reach turn is t1 + H -1, but in this case at turn 14, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn T, actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nFor T=15, actions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nAfter actions to t=14, y_15=9.\n\nAt turn T=15, y=9.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=14, which is 9 actions, H=9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =6+9-1=14, but at turn 14, y=8, not 9.\n\nThe turn t1 + H -1 should be the reach turn.\n\nAccording to task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn t1 + H -1 = t1 +9 -1 =6+8=14, y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter the last action at t=14, at turn 15, y=9, but turn 15 is not t1+H-1.\n\nTo have position at turn T=15 be 9, actions from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =6+9-1=14, which is not 15.\n\nSo the reach turn is not t1+H-1 with this.\n\nDefine H such that actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nFor that, at turn t, y_t must be set before action.\n\nSo for turn T to have y_T=9, it means that after no action at T, or rather, the position at start of turn T is y_T.\n\nThen to have y_T=9, it depends on actions before T.\n\nActions from t1 to T-1 determine y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1, number is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nH = number of actions = T - t1.\n\nThen T = t1 + H.\n\nt1 + H -1 is not the turn.\n\nLet's read the task carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nActions at t1 + 0 to t1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1, then at turn t1, after action, y_{t1+1} is set, but at turn t1, y_{t1} is the position.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis means that the actions from t1 to (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2 affect y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is determined by actions up to t-1.\n\nFor turn S = t1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\ny_S depends on actions from t1 to S-1.\n\nS-1 = (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nActions from t1 to t1 + H -2.\n\nNumber of actions: (t1 + H -2) - t1 +1 = H-1.\n\nThen after H-1 actions, at turn t1 + (H-1), position y_{t1 + H-1} = y_S =9.\n\nBut the actions sequence is from t1 to t1 + H -1, which is H actions, but only H-1 are used to set the position, the last action at t1 + H -1 might move away or something, but the position at t1+H-1 is before that action.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nLet's assume that at turn T, position y_T is before action a_T.\n\nThen to have y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1.\n\ny_T = y_t1 + sum_{k=t1}^{T-1} Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\nActions from t1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, so H = T - t1.\n\nThen T = t1 + H.\n\nBut the reach turn is T = t1 + H, and actions from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nThen for the position at T to be 9, actions from t1 to T-1 = t1 + H -1.\n\nActions at t1 to t1+H-2? Let's stop.\n\nIn this case, for T=15, y=9, t1=6, so H = T - t1 =15-6=9.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=14 (9 actions).\n\nReach at turn 15 = t1 + H =6+9=15.\n\nBut the task says reach at turn t1 + H -1, which would be 6+9-1=14.\n\nBut at turn 14, with actions to t=13, y_14 is set, which is 8 in the sequence.\n\nTo have y at turn 14 be 9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=6, to y=9 at t=14, that requires net +5 in 8 actions (t=6 to t=13), so possible with 5 U and 3 S, for example.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nThen actions from t=6 to t=13 for H-1 actions? I'm messing up.\n\nLet's follow the task.\n\nSuppose I want to reach at turn T=14.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1 =14.\n\nt1=6, so 6 + H -1 =14, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=6+8= t=14? t1 to t1+H-1=6 to 6+9-1=14.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=14.\n\nBut to have y at turn T=14 be 9, it depends on actions to t=13.\n\nWith actions at t=6 to t=13, 8 actions, determine y_14.\n\nSet y_14=9, y6=4, so sum of 8 actions Δy =5.\n\nSo 5 U and 3 S, for example.\n\nNow, at t=10, I need y_10 <=4.\n\ny_10 =4 + sum_{k=6}^{9} Δy_k\n\nPart of the actions.\n\nWith 8 actions for sum Δy=5, but I need to ensure that at t=10, y_10<=4.\n\ny_10 =4 + S4, S4 = sum_{k=6 to9} Δy_k\n\nNeed S4 <=0.\n\nThen the remaining actions k=10 to13, 4 actions, sum Δy =5 - S4 >=5, since S4<=0.\n\nBut sum of 4 actions <=4, so 5 - S4 <=4, so -S4 <=-1, S4 >=1.\n\nBut from need S4 <=0, and S4 >=1, contradiction.\n\nS4 <=0 and S4 >=1 impossible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach at turn 14 with y_10<=4.\n\nSimilarly for any T<15, the same issue.\n\nOnly for T=15, I can have y_10=4 and then go up.\n\nWith T=15, y_15=9.\n\nThen actions from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =6+9-1=14, but at turn 14, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at turn 14 be 9, I need actions to t=13 to set y_14=9.\n\nFor T=14, y_14=9, actions from t=6 to t=13.\n\nBut with the constraint at t=10, it's impossible as above.\n\nSo the only way is to reach at turn 15 with the sequence I had.\n\nThen for the output, we can list the actions to reach at turn 15.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I missed a freeway or something.\n\nAnother thought: for freeway 4, at t=6, I am on it, but if I stay, I am on it at later times, but at some times it might be occupied, but in this case at t=6 to t=10, it was safe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, I could move to other freeways.\n\nBut I think the minimal H is 9 with reach at turn 15.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a faster way.\n\nSuppose I go down to y=3 at t=7, then at t=10, I can be on y=3, which is safe, then go up.\n\nBut y=3 at t=10, then to y=9, need 6 up moves, reach at t=16, worse.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nOr, I can be on y=4 at t=10, but with fewer actions before.\n\nBut from t=6 to t=10, to have y_10=4, I need to have net zero change in the first 4 actions, so I must spend 4 actions to stay or move around, but net zero, so I can't save time.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nFor the output:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = S (since t1=6)\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = S\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+8: a_{t1+8} = U  (t=14)\n\nH=9, actions at t=6 to t=14, which is t1 to t1+8.\n\nt=6 is t1, t=7 is t1+1, ..., t=14 is t1+8.\n\nSince t1=6, t1+8=14.\n\nReach at turn 15.\n\nBut the turn t1+H-1=6+9-1=14, but at turn 14, y=8, not 9, so it doesn't satisfy.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the reach turn definition.\n\nPerhaps for this game, when we take the last action, we move to the position.\n\nBut the task says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the sequence, after action at t=14, at turn 15, y=9, so turn 15 is not t1+H-1.\n\nTo have at turn T=14 y=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nWith y6=4, I need to increase by 5 in 8 actions (t=6 to t=13).\n\nBut with the t=10 constraint, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at t=10, impossible.\n\nOr, for freeway 8, at t=11 it is safe, but to be on it at t=11, I need to be on y=8 at t=11, but to get there, at t=10 I am on y=7 or 8, which is unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=8 at t=11 without being on bad at t=10, but as before, y_10 must be 7 or 8.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to reach at turn 15 with the sequence.\n\nFor the answer, I'll go with that.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen at turn 15, y=9.\n\nIn the boxed answer, list actions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\end{array} }\n\nWith this, I reach (0,9) at turn 15.\n\nBut the turn in the box is up to turn 14.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo have reach at turn 14, I need to be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nFor example, with 5 U and 3 S in the first 8 actions, but I need to avoid t=10 on bad y.\n\nSuppose I do some actions to be low at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=6, U to y=5 at t=7\n\nt=7, U to y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8, D to y=5 at t=9\n\nt=9, D to y=4 at t=10\n\nThen at t=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=10, I need to go to y=9 by turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, y=9.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=13.\n\n4 actions, to increase from y=4 to y=9, need +5, impossible with 4 actions.\n\nMax to y=8 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=8, then action U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nStill turn 15.\n\nCannot reach earlier.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 9. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn 10, when all these freeways have a car covering \\(x = 0\\). Specifically, the player stays at \\(y = 4\\) from turns 6 to 10, which is safe at these times, and then moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\) from turns 10 to 14, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turns 6-9 (y=4)**: At each turn, freeway 4 is safe:\n  - Turn 6: Cars on y=4 at Δt=0: spans [-35,-24], [1,12], [37,48]; 0 not covered.\n  - Turn 7: Δt=1: spans [-31,-20], [5,16], [41,52]; 0 not covered.\n  - Turn 8: Δt=2: spans [-27,-16], [9,20], [45,56]; 0 not covered.\n  - Turn 9: Δt=3: spans [-23,-12], [13,24], [49,60]; 0 not covered.\n- **Turn 10 (y=4)**: Safe as above (Δt=4: spans [-19,-8], [17,28], [53,64]; 0 not covered).\n- **Turn 11 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 at Δt=5: spans [73,84] and [1,12]; 0 not in [1,12] (0 < 1).\n- **Turn 12 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 at Δt=6: spans [85,96] and [13,24]; 0 not covered.\n- **Turn 13 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 at Δt=7: spans [97,108] and [25,36]; 0 not covered.\n- **Turn 14 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 at Δt=8: spans [109,120] and [37,48]; 0 not covered.\n- **Turn 15 (y=9)**: No freeway, safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = 6\\) to \\(t = 14\\) (i.e., \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6 + 9 - 1 = 14\\)) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 6: Stay (S), so \\(y_7 = 4\\).\n- Turn 7: Stay (S), so \\(y_8 = 4\\).\n- Turn 8: Stay (S), so \\(y_9 = 4\\).\n- Turn 9: Stay (S), so \\(y_{10} = 4\\).\n- Turn 10: Up (U), so \\(y_{11} = 5\\).\n- Turn 11: Up (U), so \\(y_{12} = 6\\).\n- Turn 12: Up (U), so \\(y_{13} = 7\\).\n- Turn 13: Up (U), so \\(y_{14} = 8\\).\n- Turn 14: Up (U), so \\(y_{15} = 9\\).\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 15 (which is \\(t_1 + H = 6 + 9 = 15\\), but the actions end at turn 14 to achieve this position at the next turn).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t1=8 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. If the player moves to a different y at turn T, they aren't on that freeway until the next turn, so they don't collide if cars are there but moving away.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=8, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t1=8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? No, the notation says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I think \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined based on direction.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, which is larger x if we assume x increases to the right, but since they're moving right, at t1, head is at higher x than tail.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], with τ tail, h head, so since moving right, tail has smaller x, head has larger x, so [tail, head] increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [head, tail] but head has smaller x? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h is head, which should be on the left, so smaller x, τ tail larger x, so [h, τ] with h < τ, and it decreases as time passes.\n\nBut in the collision, we care about whether x=0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nAlso, the player is always at x=0, so we only care about when the car spans cover x=0.\n\nNow for freeway 1: car is (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nGiven as (head, tail) = (-24, -35), but head is -24, tail is -35? That would mean head at -24, tail at -35, so if moving right, head should be to the right, so if x increases right, -24 > -35, so head at -24, tail at -35, so tail is left of head, which makes sense for right-moving. Span is from tail to head, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it might be different, but here all given are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet me check the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) so head=-24, tail=-35, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSpan at t1=8: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] = [-35 + 3(T-8), -24 + 3(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-24, -35, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-16, -27, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4), (56, 45, right, 4)\n\n(20,9, right,4) — head=20, tail=9? But 20>9, so tail=9, head=20, so [τ, h] = [9,20]\n\nSimilarly, (56,45, right,4) head=56, tail=45, [45,56]\n\nAnd (-16,-27,right,4) head=-16, tail=-27, [-27,-16]\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, (48,37,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at turn t=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is above, so probably moving up is better, but I have to avoid cars on y=1 to 8 when I'm on those rows.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and no cars on y=9 I assume, as freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,5), goal (0,9).\n\nTo minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars there at T.\n\nOnly when I stay or after moving, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I collide if for that freeway, 0 in span at T.\n\nLet me denote the turns: let t=0 be t1=8, so at turn 0, player at y=5.\n\nI need to find sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, with y_H =9.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H, with y_0=5, y_H=9.\n\nAt each turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions for H turns? Let's see the indexing.\n\nPlayer position at turn t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,... \n\nAt time index τ = t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...\n\nBut to simplify, let's set τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1, position (0,5)\n\nAt τ=1, turn t1+1, position after first action, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=K, so actions from τ=0 to K-1, total K actions, after K steps, at τ=K, y_K=9.\n\nSince y changes at each action, after H actions, at time τ=H, y_H.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_0, at τ=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, at τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nAnd at each step τ, for τ from 0 to H-1, when we are at position (0, y_τ), we must not collide, meaning that for freeway y_τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, then 0 not in span of any car on that freeway at time τ.\n\nTime τ is the turn index.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car at time τ.\n\nSince the player is only at x=0, I only care about whether for a given freeway and time, if the player is there, is it occupied.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and time τ, I can compute if there is a car such that 0 in span at τ.\n\nThen, when player is on row k at time τ, and k between 1 and 8, it must be that no car on k has 0 in span at τ.\n\nIf player moves to a different row, at that time, they are not on the new row yet, so only the current row matters for collision at that time.\n\nNow, since we start at τ=0, y=5, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=5 to y=9, the minimum steps if no obstacles is 4 up moves, so H=4, but with cars, it might take longer if we have to wait or detour.\n\nBut y can only change by -1,0,+1, so to go from 5 to 9, min 4 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nFirst, I should compute for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each k, times τ where for some car on k, 0 in span at time τ.\n\nTime τ is from t1=8, but since the span depends on (T - t1), let δ = τ - 0, but τ is absolute turn? Better to use relative time.\n\nSet t = 0 at current turn, so time from now: let s = 0,1,2,... be the step, s=0 is current time.\n\nAt time s (relative), the absolute turn is t1 + s.\n\nFor car positions, at time s, span for a car is based on (T - t1) = s.\n\nFor a car on freeway k with given (h, τ, d, s_speed) at s=0.\n\nDirection d, speed v.\n\nFor right-moving: span at time s is [τ + v s, h + v s]\n\nFor left-moving, but all here are right-moving, so only right.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, etc. all right.\n\nSo for any car, span at time s: [tail + v s, head + v s]\n\nSince tail and head at s=0.\n\nNow, 0 in span if tail + v s <= 0 <= head + v s\n\nSince head >= tail, as per data.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left here.\n\nSo condition: tail + v s <= 0 and 0 <= head + v s, which is tail + v s <= 0 <= head + v s.\n\nSince head + v s >= tail + v s, so equivalent to min <= 0 <= max, so tail + v s <= 0 <= head + v s.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the set of s where this is true for any car on that freeway.\n\nIf for a freeway, at time s, there is a car with 0 in span, then if player is on that row at time s, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their spans.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car: tail=-35, head=-24, v=3\n\nSo at time s, span: [-35 + 3s, -24 + 3s]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 3s <= 0 <= -24 + 3s\n\nSo -35 + 3s <= 0 => 3s <= 35 => s <= 35/3 ≈ 11.666, so s <= 11 since s integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 + 3s => 24 <= 3s => s >= 8\n\nSo s >= 8 and s <= 11\n\ns >= ceil(24/3) = 8, s <= floor(35/3) = floor(11.666) = 11\n\nSo for s=8,9,10,11\n\nAt s=8: -35+24= -11 <=0? -35+24= -11, +3s: s=8, -35+24= -11? -35 + 3*8 = -35+24= -11 <=0\n\n-24 + 3*8 = -24+24=0 <=0, 0<=0 true.\n\ns=9: -35+27= -8 <=0, -24+27=3 >=0, yes\n\ns=10: -35+30= -5 <=0, -24+30=6 >=0, yes\n\ns=11: -35+33= -2 <=0, -24+33=9 >=0, yes\n\ns=12: -35+36=1 >0? 1 <=0? -35+36=1, 1 <=0 false, so 0 not <= head + v s? 0 <= 1 is true, but tail + v s =1 >0, so 0 < tail + v s, not >=, so 0 not in [1,9], since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, s=7: tail + v s = -35+21= -14 <=0, head + v s= -24+21= -3 <=0? 0 <= -3 false, since -3<0, so 0 not <= -3.\n\nSo only s=8,9,10,11 occupied for freeway 1.\n\nNow s is relative time, s=0 is now, current turn.\n\nAt s=0, time now, is it occupied?\n\ns=0: tail=-35, head=-24, -35 <=0 <= -24? 0 <= -24? False, -24<0, so no.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, cars: (-24,-35,right,3) same, so occupied s=8,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 3: same, occupied s=8,9,10,11\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-16,-27,right,4) so tail=-27, head=-16, v=4\n\nAt s, span: [-27 + 4s, -16 + 4s]\n\n0 in span if -27 +4s <=0 <= -16 +4s\n\n-27+4s <=0 => 4s <=27 => s<=6.75, s<=6\n\n0 <= -16+4s => 16<=4s => s>=4\n\ns>=4 and s<=6\n\ns=4: -27+16= -11 <=0, -16+16=0 <=0, yes\n\ns=5: -27+20= -7 <=0, -16+20=4 >=0, yes\n\ns=6: -27+24= -3 <=0, -16+24=8 >=0, yes\n\ns=3: -27+12= -15 <=0, -16+12= -4 <0, 0 <= -4 false\n\ns=7: -27+28=1 >0, not <=0\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (20,9,right,4) head=20, tail=9? Given (20,9,right,4), so head=20, tail=9, so span [9,20] at s=0? Tail=9, head=20.\n\n[τ + v s, h + v s] = [9 + 4s, 20 + 4s]\n\n0 in span: 9+4s <=0 <=20+4s\n\n9+4s <=0 => 4s <= -9, impossible since s>=0, 4s>=0, 9+4s>=9>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for this car, since min is 9+4s >=9>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (56,45,right,4) head=56, tail=45, [45+4s, 56+4s], min 45+4s >=45>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only the first car matters, occupied when s=4,5,6.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) tail=37, head=48, v=12\n\nSpan: [37+12s, 48+12s], min 37+12s >=37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12) tail=-35, head=-24, v=12\n\nSpan: [-35 +12s, -24 +12s]\n\n0 in span if -35+12s <=0 <= -24+12s\n\n-35+12s <=0 => 12s <=35 => s<=35/12≈2.916, s<=2\n\n0 <= -24+12s => 24<=12s => s>=2\n\ns>=2 and s<=2? s=2\n\ns>= ceil(24/12)=2, s<= floor(35/12)= floor(2.916)=2\n\ns=2: -35+24= -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0, yes.\n\ns=1: -35+12= -23 <=0, -24+12= -12 <0, 0 <= -12 false\n\ns=3: -35+36=1 >0, not <=0\n\nSo only s=2 occupied for this car.\n\nThus freeway 5 occupied only at s=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, cars (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), so only second car matters, occupied at s=2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied s=2.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied s=2.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 occupied s=8,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 4 occupied s=4,5,6\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 occupied s=2\n\ns=2 for 5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, player starts at y=5 at s=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so row 5 is freeway 5.\n\nAt s=0, player on row 5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at s=0? From above, occupied at s=2, not at s=0.\n\ns=0: for freeway 5, at s=0, span second car [-35,-24], 0 not in, first car [37,48] not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times except s=2 are safe for row 5.\n\nBut we are at s=0 now.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to move up.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut we need to be there at some s.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are when we are on a row that is occupied at that time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For row 1: occupied s=8,9,10,11\n\n- Row 2: occupied s=8,9,10,11\n\n- Row 3: occupied s=8,9,10,11\n\n- Row 4: occupied s=4,5,6\n\n- Row 5: occupied s=2\n\n- Row 6: occupied s=2\n\n- Row 7: occupied s=2\n\n- Row 8: occupied s=8,9,10,11? Row 8: freeway 8, occupied at s=2 only, from above.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at s=2, but for s=8,9,10,11, is it occupied?\n\nFor row 8, freeway 8, cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car [37+12s,48+12s], at s=8: 37+96=133,48+96=144, min 133>0, not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [-35+12s, -24+12s], at s=8: -35+96=61, -24+96=72, min 61>0, not cover 0.\n\nAt s=2: -35+24=-11 to -24+24=0, covers 0.\n\nBut at s=8, both cars way positive, so no cover.\n\nSimilarly for other s.\n\nBut row 1,2,3 occupied at s=8,9,10,11, which are later.\n\nNow back to player.\n\nStart at s=0, y=5, which is safe since row 5 not occupied at s=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to move up directly, but we have to check the path.\n\nSince min steps are 4, let's see if we can go up in 4 steps: actions U,U,U,U.\n\nThen positions:\n\ns=0: y=5, action a0=U, to y=6 at s=1\n\ns=1: position y=6, after action? Let's sequence:\n\nAt time s, before action, position y_s.\n\nAfter action a_s, y_{s+1} = y_s + Δy_s\n\nAt time s, we are at (0, y_s), and we take action a_s, then at time s+1, we are at (0, y_{s+1})\n\nCollision at time s if y_s between 1 and 8 and freeway y_s occupied at time s.\n\nFor the path U,U,U,U:\n\nStart s=0: y=5, row 5, occupied? s=0 not, safe.\n\nAction a0=U, so y1 = 5 +1 =6 at s=1\n\ns=1: position y=6, row 6, is it occupied? Row 6 occupied at s=2, not at s=1. s=1: freeway 6 at s=1, cars: first [37+12*1=49,48+12=60] no, second [-35+12= -23, -24+12= -12] both not cover 0, so safe. Action a1=U, y2=7\n\ns=2: position y=7, row 7, occupied? Row 7 at s=2 is occupied, since freeway 7 occupied at s=2.\n\nAt s=2, y=7, row 7, occupied, so collision! Not good.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 7 at s=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, at s=2 we would be on row 7 if we moved up twice, but y starts at 5.\n\ns=0: y=5\n\nAfter a0=U, s=1: y=6\n\nAfter a1=U, s=2: y=7\n\nYes, and at s=2, row 7 occupied, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on rows 5,6,7,8 at s=2? Rows 5,6,7,8 all occupied at s=2? From above:\n\nRow 5: occupied s=2\n\nRow 6: occupied s=2\n\nRow 7: occupied s=2\n\nRow 8: occupied s=2\n\nAnd rows 1,2,3 at s=8,9,10,11, but that's later.\n\nAt s=2, all freeways 5,6,7,8 are occupied.\n\nSo we cannot be on any of rows 5,6,7,8 at time s=2.\n\nPlayer at s=0 is on row 5, which is safe at s=0.\n\nBut at s=2, we must not be on rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nWhere can we be at s=2?\n\nPossible positions: y=0,1,2,3,4,9, but y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeway.\n\ny=1,2,3,4: rows 1-4.\n\nNow, at s=2, are they occupied?\n\nRow 1: occupied only at s=8,9,10,11, not at s=2. s=2: freeway 1, car [-35+3*2= -35+6= -29, -24+6= -18], min -29<0, max -18<0, so 0 not in span. Similarly row 2,3 same.\n\nRow 4: freeway 4, occupied at s=4,5,6, not at s=2. At s=2: first car [-27+4*2= -27+8= -19, -16+8= -8] both neg, no. Other cars not cover, so safe.\n\nSo at s=2, rows 1,2,3,4 are safe, also y=0 and y=9.\n\nBut we start from y=5 at s=0.\n\nWe need to not be on 5,6,7,8 at s=2.\n\nSo by s=2, we need to be at y <=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might be far, and we have only two steps: from s=0 to s=1, then s=1 to s=2.\n\nAt s=0, we take action, go to s=1.\n\nAt s=1, take action, go to s=2.\n\nPosition at s=2 depends on actions at s=0 and s=1.\n\nStart y_0=5\n\nAfter a0, y1 = y0 + Δa0\n\nAfter a1, y2 = y1 + Δa1\n\nWe need y2 <=4 or y2=9, since at s=2 position.\n\ny2=9 might not be possible in two steps, from 5 to 9 min 4 up, so in two steps, max to 7 if UU, but 7 is not <=4 and not 9.\n\ny2 <=4 or y2=9.\n\nBut from y0=5, with two actions, possible y2:\n\n- UU: y1=6, y2=7\n\n- UD: y1=6, y2=5\n\n- US: y1=5, y2=6? a0=U: y1=6, a1=S: y2=6\n\na0=S: y1=5, a1=U: y2=6\n\na0=S: y1=5, a1=D: y2=4\n\na0=S: y1=5, a1=S: y2=5\n\na0=D: y1=4, a1=U: y2=5\n\na0=D: y1=4, a1=D: y2=3\n\na0=D: y1=4, a1=S: y2=4\n\na0=D: y1=4, a1=D: y2=3\n\nPossible y2: 3,4,5,6,7\n\ny2=3: if a0=D, a1=D\n\ny2=4: a0=D,a1=S or a0=S,a1=D or a0=D,a1=U? a0=D: y1=4, a1=U: y2=5, not 4. To have y2=4: a0=D then a1=S, or a0=S then a1=D? a0=S: y1=5, a1=D: y2=4; or a0=D: y1=4, a1=S: y2=4\n\ny2=5: several ways\n\ny2=6: e.g. a0=U,a1=S or a0=S,a1=U\n\ny2=7: a0=U,a1=U\n\nNow, we need y2 <=4 or y2=9, but y2=9 impossible, so must have y2 <=4.\n\nSo y2=3 or 4.\n\ny2=3: by a0=D, a1=D\n\ny2=4: by a0=D,a1=S or a0=S,a1=D\n\nBut a0=S,a1=D: at s=0, position y=5, take S, stay at y=5 for s=1? Let's see the times.\n\nAt time s=0: position y=5, we take action a0.\n\nAfter a0, at time s=1, position y1.\n\nThen at time s=1, we take action a1, then at s=2 position y2.\n\nNow, at each time s, we have a position y_s, and we check collision at that time.\n\nFor s=0: y=5, which is safe as we said.\n\nAfter a0, at s=1, position y1.\n\nIf we do a0=D, then y1=4 at s=1.\n\nPosition at s=1: y=4, row 4.\n\nIs row 4 occupied at s=1? Freeway 4 at s=1: earlier, occupied s=4,5,6, not s=1.\n\nAt s=1: car1 [-27+4*1= -23, -16+4= -12] both neg, no. Other cars not cover, so safe.\n\nThen at s=1, we take action, say a1.\n\nIf we want y2=4, we can take a1=S, so y2=4.\n\nThen at s=2, position y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 at s=2: occupied? s=2 not in {4,5,6}, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we do a0=S at s=0, y1=5 at s=1.\n\nAt s=1, position y=5, row 5.\n\nRow 5 at s=1: occupied? Only at s=2, not s=1. s=1: freeway 5, cars [37+12=49,48+12=60] no, [-35+12= -23,-24+12= -12] no, so safe.\n\nThen take a1=D, y2=4 at s=2, safe as above.\n\nOr if a0=D, a1=D, y1=4 at s=1, then y2=3 at s=2.\n\ny=3 at s=2, row 3, which is safe at s=2.\n\nNow, after s=2, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=4 or y=3 at s=2.\n\ny=4 to y=9 need 5 up, min 5 steps.\n\nBut we also have to avoid other obstacles.\n\nFor example, row 4 is occupied at s=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1,2,3 occupied at s=8,9,10,11.\n\nBut s=8 is later, we might not be there.\n\nFirst, let's get to s=2 safely.\n\nSo options:\n\nOption 1: at s=0, take D, to y=4 at s=1\n\nAt s=1, take S, to y=4 at s=2? a1=S, so from y1=4, stay, y2=4.\n\nOr take D, to y=3.\n\nBut since we need to go up, better not go down too much.\n\ny=4 at s=2 is fine.\n\nOption 2: at s=0, take S, to y=5 at s=1\n\nThen at s=1, take D, to y=4 at s=2\n\nEither way, at s=2, we are at y=4.\n\nNow from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 at s=2.\n\nWe can move up.\n\nBut row 4 is occupied at s=4,5,6.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 4 at s=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to other rows.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to move up directly, but let's see the times.\n\nAt s=2, y=4.\n\nIf we take U at s=2, go to y=5 at s=3\n\nThen at s=3, take U, to y=6 at s=4\n\nThen at s=4, take U, to y=7 at s=5\n\nThen at s=5, take U, to y=8 at s=6\n\nThen at s=6, take U, to y=9 at s=7\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\ns=2: y=4, row 4, not occupied at s=2 (only 4,5,6, but s=2<4), safe.\n\ns=3: position y=5, row 5. Occupied? Row 5 occupied only at s=2, not s=3. s=3: freeway 5, cars [37+12*3=37+36=73,48+36=84] no, [-35+36=1,-24+36=12], min=1>0, not cover 0, so safe.\n\ns=4: position y=6, row 6. Occupied? Row 6 at s=4: freeway 6, cars [37+12*4=37+48=85,48+48=96] no, [-35+48=13,-24+48=24] both >0, no cover. But row 6 occupied only at s=2, not other times. So safe.\n\nBut at s=4, we are on row 6, which is not occupied, but row 4 is occupied at s=4, but we are not on row 4.\n\nNow s=4: y=6, not row 4.\n\ns=5: position y=7, row 7. At s=5: freeway 7, cars [37+12*5=37+60=97,48+60=108] no, [-35+60=25,-24+60=36] no, so safe.\n\ns=6: position y=8, row 8. At s=6: freeway 8, cars [37+72=109,48+72=120] no, [-35+72=37,-24+72=48] no, safe.\n\ns=7: position y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we reached at s=7.\n\nBut we started from s=0 to s=7, 7 steps? Let's list:\n\nActions from τ=0 to H-1, with y_H=9.\n\nHere, at s=0: start y=5\n\na0: ? In above, at s=2 we have y=4, so we need actions to get there.\n\nFirst, to get to s=2 at y=4.\n\nFor example: at s=0, take D, so a0=D, then y1=4 at s=1\n\nThen at s=1, take S, a1=S, y2=4 at s=2\n\nThen at s=2, take U, a2=U, y3=5 at s=3\n\ns=3: y=5, take U, a3=U, y4=6 at s=4\n\ns=4: y=6, take U, a4=U, y5=7 at s=5\n\ns=5: y=7, take U, a5=U, y6=8 at s=6\n\ns=6: y=8, take U, a6=U, y7=9 at s=7\n\nNow, collision check:\n\ns=0: y=5, safe\n\ns=1: y=4, row 4, at s=1: not occupied, safe\n\ns=2: y=4, row 4, at s=2: not occupied (occupied s=4,5,6), safe\n\ns=3: y=5, row 5, at s=3: not occupied (only s=2), safe\n\ns=4: y=6, row 6, at s=4: not occupied, safe\n\ns=5: y=7, row 7, at s=5: not occupied, safe\n\ns=6: y=8, row 8, at s=6: not occupied, safe\n\ns=7: y=9, safe\n\nSo we reached at s=7 with y=9.\n\nBut H=7 turns? s from 0 to 7, 7 steps, actions from s=0 to s=6, 7 actions? Let's see:\n\nAfter 7 actions, at s=7, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from s=0 to s=6, that's 7 actions, H=7.\n\nBut min is 4, but we took extra steps to avoid s=2.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nAnother option: at s=0, take S, to y=5 at s=1\n\nThen at s=1, take D, to y=4 at s=2\n\nThen same as above, from y=4 at s=2, then up to y=9 at s=7.\n\nStill 7 steps.\n\nBut at s=2 we are at y=4, which is safe.\n\nWe could go down to y=3 at s=2, but that would take longer to go up.\n\nFor example, a0=D, a1=D, to y=3 at s=2.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=9, need 6 up, so at s=8 or more, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps we can go up later.\n\nAnother idea: since row 4 is occupied from s=4 to s=6, we can be on row 4 only before s=4 or after s=6.\n\nAt s=2 we are at y=4, which is before s=4.\n\nThen we move up.\n\nIn the above, we moved up at s=2 to s=3, to y=5, etc., and avoided row 4 during s=4,5,6.\n\nBut at s=4, we are on y=6, not row 4.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nSuppose we don't go down at the beginning.\n\nBut we have to avoid s=2 on rows 5-8.\n\nSo we must be at y<=4 at s=2.\n\ny=4 is the highest we can be at s=2 without collision.\n\ny=4 at s=2.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, min 5 steps.\n\nSo earliest to reach y=9 is at s=7, with 5 up moves from s=2.\n\ns=2 to s=7 is 5 steps: from s=2 to s=3,4,5,6,7.\n\nActions at s=2,3,4,5,6 to reach y=9 at s=7.\n\nIn terms of time: at s=2, position y=4.\n\nAfter actions at s=2,3,4,5,6, each action moves to next position.\n\nAfter a2 at s=2, to y at s=3, and so on, to y at s=7.\n\nWith 5 U actions, y increases to 9 at s=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, we used one D at the beginning, so total actions: one D, then one S or D, then five U, total 7 actions.\n\nBut the S or D at s=1 is not necessary if we go directly to y=4 at s=2 with a0=D and a1= something to y=4.\n\nEarlier: to have y2=4, we can do:\n\n- a0=D, a1=S: s=0 D to y=4 at s=1; s=1 S to y=4 at s=2\n\n- or a0=S, a1=D: s=0 S to y=5 at s=1; s=1 D to y=4 at s=2\n\n- or a0=D, a1=U? a0=D to y=4 at s=1; a1=U to y=5 at s=2, but y2=5, which is not <=4, not safe at s=2.\n\nWe need y2<=4.\n\nSo only options with a0=D and a1=S or a1=D but if a1=D, y2=3.\n\nOr a0=S and a1=D, y2=4.\n\nIn all cases, we have at least one non-up action.\n\nTotal actions to go from start to end: from y=5 to y=9, need +4 in y, but we go down to 4 first, so net +5, with 7 actions: one down, one stay or another down, then five up.\n\nIn the sequence with a0=S and a1=D: actions: s=0 S, s=1 D, then s=2 U, s=3 U, s=4 U, s=5 U, s=6 U, so actions: S,D,U,U,U,U,U — 7 actions.\n\nWith a0=D and a1=S: D,S,U,U,U,U,U — also 7.\n\nCan we avoid the extra action?\n\nSuppose at s=0, we take U, but then at s=1 y=6, which is safe at s=1, but at s=2 we need to not be on 5-8.\n\nIf at s=1 y=6, we can take D to y=5 at s=2, but y=5 at s=2 is occupied, collision.\n\nTake S to y=6 at s=2, row 6 occupied, collision.\n\nTake U to y=7 at s=2, row 7 occupied, collision.\n\nSo no, from y=6 at s=1, any action leads to y=5,6, or7 at s=2, all occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at s=0 we take S, to y=5 at s=1, then at s=1, if we take U to y=6 at s=2, occupied; S to y=5 at s=2, occupied; D to y=4 at s=2, which is safe, as before.\n\nSo only by moving down to y=4 at s=2 is safe.\n\nThus, we must have at least one down action to reach y=4 at s=2.\n\nThen from there, five up actions to y=9 at s=7.\n\nTotal H=7 actions, reaching at s=7.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nt1=8, so actions for turn 8,9,10,... up to turn 8+H-1.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by being on y=9 before s=7.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at s=2, if we move up faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so min 5 steps to go from 4 to 9.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from 4 at s=2.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 directly without going to 4, but we have to avoid s=2.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=5 until after s=2, but at s=2, if on y=5, collision, so we must leave before or after, but since we are there at s=0, we can move at s=0.\n\nIf we take no action or up, we are still on 5-8 at s=2.\n\nOnly down avoids.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=9 quickly, but to reach y=9 from y=5, min at s=4 with U,U,U,U: s=0 y=5, a0=U y=6 s=1, a1=U y=7 s=2, but at s=2 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nIf we delay, but later rows have issues.\n\nFor example, rows 1,2,3 occupied at s=8,9,10,11, but if we reach y=9 before, fine.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at s=4, we need to be at y=9 at s=4.\n\nWith actions: a0=U to y=6 s=1, a1=U to y=7 s=2, but at s=2 y=7 collision, cannot.\n\na0=U to y=6 s=1, then if we could jump, but no.\n\nFrom s=0, if we take D to y=4 at s=1, then at s=1 take U to y=5 at s=2, but y=5 at s=2 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake D to y=4 at s=1, then at s=1 take U? a1=U to y=5 at s=2, collision.\n\nIf at s=1 y=4, take S to y=4 at s=2, safe, but then we are at y=4 s=2, same as before.\n\nSo no faster way.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=0 or something, but that takes more steps down and up, worse.\n\nSo minimal seems 7 turns.\n\nBut let's see the car on row 4 occupied s=4,5,6.\n\nIn our path, at s=4 we are on y=6, not on row 4, so fine.\n\nWe could be on row 4 after s=6.\n\nBut since we are going up, not necessary.\n\nAnother path: suppose at s=2 we are at y=4, but instead of going up immediately, we stay or something, but that would delay, not better.\n\nSo the sequence I have should work.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from s=0 to s=6.\n\ns relative to t1=8.\n\nSo turn t1 + s.\n\nAction at turn t for s=0: turn 8\n\ns=1: turn 9\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence with a0=S and a1=D: at s=0 (turn 8), action S, stay at y=5\n\nThen s=1 (turn 9), action D, to y=4\n\ns=2 (turn 10), action U, to y=5\n\ns=3 (turn 11), action U, to y=6\n\ns=4 (turn 12), action U, to y=7\n\ns=5 (turn 13), action U, to y=8\n\ns=6 (turn 14), action U, to y=9\n\nAt s=6, y=9 reached.\n\ny at s=6 is after action at s=5? Let's list positions:\n\nTime s=0 (turn 8): position y=5, take action a0=S → y=5 for s=1? No.\n\nAt time s, position y_s, take action a_s, then position at s+1 is y_{s+1} = y_s + Δa_s\n\nSo:\n\n- At s=0 (turn 8): y=5, take a0=S → y1 =5 +0 =5, so at s=1 position y=5\n\n- At s=1 (turn 9): y=5, take a1=D → y2 =5 -1 =4, so at s=2 position y=4\n\n- At s=2 (turn 10): y=4, take a2=U → y3=4+1=5, at s=3 position y=5\n\n- At s=3 (turn 11): y=5, take a3=U → y4=6, at s=4 position y=6\n\n- At s=4 (turn 12): y=6, take a4=U → y5=7, at s=5 position y=7\n\n- At s=5 (turn 13): y=7, take a5=U → y6=8, at s=6 position y=8\n\n- At s=6 (turn 14): y=8, take a6=U → y7=9, at s=7 position y=9\n\nNow at s=7, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we took action at s=6 to reach y=9 at s=7.\n\nNumber of actions: from s=0 to s=6, 7 actions, H=7.\n\nReached at s=7.\n\nIn terms of turn: from turn 8 to turn 14, 7 turns.\n\nBut at s=7, turn t1+7=8+7=15, but position at turn.\n\nTurn t1 + s for position at that turn.\n\nAt turn 8, s=0, position y=5\n\nTurn 9, s=1, position y=5\n\nTurn 10, s=2, position y=4\n\nTurn 11, s=3, position y=5\n\nTurn 12, s=4, position y=6\n\nTurn 13, s=5, position y=7\n\nTurn 14, s=6, position y=8\n\nThen after action at turn 14, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9) at some turn, so at turn 15, which is fine.\n\nThe sequence ends when we reach, so actions up to the one that gets us to y=9.\n\nIn this case, action at turn 14 (s=6) is U, to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nNow, collision points: we need to check at each turn s, when position is on freeway.\n\nTurn 8 (s=0): y=5, freeway 5, not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 9 (s=1): y=5, freeway 5, at s=1 not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 10 (s=2): y=4, freeway 4, at s=2 not occupied (occupied s=4,5,6), safe\n\nTurn 11 (s=3): y=5, freeway 5, at s=3 not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 12 (s=4): y=6, freeway 6, at s=4 not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 13 (s=5): y=7, freeway 7, at s=5 not occupied, safe\n\nTurn 14 (s=6): y=8, freeway 8, at s=6 not occupied, safe\n\nThen turn 15: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 9 (s=1), we are still at y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut we could have moved down earlier.\n\nWith a0=D: at turn 8, action D, to y=4 at turn 9\n\nThen at turn 9, action S, to y=4 at turn 10\n\nThen at turn 10, action U, to y=5 at turn 11, etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in both, we have 7 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can save one action by not staying.\n\nFor example, at s=0, take D to y=4 at s=1\n\nThen at s=1, since at y=4, and s=1, row 4 safe, but we need to go to s=2.\n\nIf at s=1 we take U, to y=5 at s=2, but y=5 at s=2 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake D to y=3 at s=2, then from y=3 to y=9, need 6 up, worse.\n\nSo 7 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can be on row 4 after s=6.\n\nFor example, at s=2, y=4, but instead of moving up, we stay until s=7 or something, but then later we have to go up, and rows 1-3 occupied at s=8-11, but if we reach y=9 before, fine.\n\nBut staying would delay.\n\nFor instance, at s=2 y=4, take S at s=2, to y=4 at s=3\n\nThen at s=3 y=4, take S to y=4 at s=4, but at s=4, row 4 occupied! Collision if we stay.\n\nAt s=4, if on row 4, occupied.\n\nSo we cannot stay on row 4 during s=4,5,6.\n\nIn our sequence, we left row 4 by s=3.\n\nAt s=3 we are at y=5.\n\nWe could go directly to higher.\n\nBut from y=4 at s=2, we need to move up to avoid row 4 during occupation.\n\nSince row 4 occupied s=4,5,6, we should not be on row 4 at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on row 4 only at s=2 and s=3? At s=2 position y=4, s=3 position y=5, so not on row 4 at s=4,5,6.\n\ns=4 y=6, etc.\n\nWe could go faster: from y=4 at s=2, take U to y=5 at s=3, U to y=6 at s=4, etc., same as before.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nThus, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence of actions.\n\nNow, with the sequence above.\n\nBut there is another car: rows 1,2,3 occupied at s=8,9,10,11.\n\nBut in our path, we are at y=8 at s=6, which is turn 14, s=6 relative to t1=8, absolute turn 14.\n\ns=8 would be turn 16, but we are at y=9 by turn 15, so not on those rows.\n\ns=8 relative is turn t1+8=16, but we reach at turn 15, before that.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we go down less, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since at s=2, rows 5-8 occupied, but we can be on y=9 at s=2, but impossible from y=5 in 2 steps.\n\nOr on y=0, but worse.\n\nSo I think 7 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 4: occupied s=4,5,6.\n\nIn our path, at s=4 we are on y=6, not 4.\n\nBut is there a way to go through row 4 before s=4?\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=4 earlier, but we start at s=0 y=5.\n\nAt s=0, we can go to y=4.\n\nThen at s=1, y=4.\n\nBut at s=1, row 4 safe, but we need to be at s=2 not on 5-8, so y=4 at s=2 is fine.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut at s=1, if we are at y=4, we can take action to go up, but if we take U at s=1, to y=5 at s=2, collision.\n\nSo we must take S or D at s=1 to stay at y=4 or go down.\n\nBut going down is worse.\n\nSo stay at s=1 to y=4 at s=2.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nWe can use either sequence.\n\nLet me use the one with stay first or down first.\n\nPerhaps down first is better to save time, but same number.\n\nIn terms of actions, both have 7.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nSince the player might want to minimize time, but both same.\n\nLet me write with a0=D.\n\nSo actions:\n\nAt turn t1=8: a_{t1} = D\n\nThen turn t1+1=9: a_{t1+1} = S  (to stay at y=4 for s=2)\n\nIn terms of the action at the turn.\n\nTurn 8: action D, so after this, at turn 9 position y=4\n\nThen turn 9: action S, so at turn 10 position y=4\n\nThen turn 10: action U, at turn 11 position y=5\n\nTurn 11: action U, at turn 12 y=6\n\nTurn 12: action U, at turn 13 y=7\n\nTurn 13: action U, at turn 14 y=8\n\nTurn 14: action U, at turn 15 y=9\n\nReached at turn 15.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 8 to 14, that's 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nWith a0=S: turn 8: S, at turn 9 y=5\n\nTurn 9: D, at turn 10 y=4\n\nThen same as above from turn 10.\n\nBut then from turn 10 to 14: U,U,U,U,U to reach at turn 15.\n\nActions: turn 8: S, turn 9: D, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U, turn 14: U\n\nStill 7 actions.\n\nIn this case, at turn 9, we are at y=5, which is safe, but we move down.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nNow for the output, we need to box the sequence.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars, but we only care when player is on it.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on row 4 at turn 10 (s=2), which is safe.\n\nTurn 10 is s=2, relative.\n\nAbsolute turn: t1=8, s=0 turn 8, s=1 turn 9, s=2 turn 10, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer than 7.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=6 or something.\n\nAt s=0, take U to y=6 at s=1\n\nAt s=1, we are at y=6, which is safe at s=1.\n\nBut at s=2, we need to not be on 5-8.\n\nSo from y=6 at s=1, we can take D to y=5 at s=2, but occupied; S to y=6 occupied; U to y=7 occupied. All bad.\n\nTake D to y=5 at s=2, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps move to y=3 or 4 directly, but from y=6 at s=1, to y=4 at s=2, but with one action, we can only change by 1, so to y=5,6,7.\n\nCannot go to y=4 directly.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nSo the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nAlso, since the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, we output the sequence.\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in the box, we output the sequence with turns.\n\nNow, let's write one sequence.\n\nI'll use the down first version.\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn this, after turn 14 action U, at turn 15 y=9.\n\nReached.\n\nWith stay first: turn 8: S, turn 9: D, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U, turn 14: U\n\nSame number.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the stay action.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, take D, to y=4 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, instead of stay, take D again to y=3 at turn 10.\n\nThen from y=3, need to go to y=9, 6 steps, so to s=6 or more, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nTake U at turn 9, but to y=5 at turn 10, which is row 5 at s=2? Turn 10 is s=2, y=5, occupied, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nSo must have a stay or equivalent to be at y=4 at s=2.\n\nThus, the sequence is fine.\n\nNow for the output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 7.

But note: in the table, for right-moving cars, they are given as (head, tail) and the span is [tail, head] for right-moving? Actually, the table says:\n    For right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut look at the example in the table: \n  For freeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> this is (h, τ) = (-12, -23). \n  But the span for right-moving is defined as [τ, h] = [-23, -12]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [ -23 + 4*(T-9), -12 + 4*(T-9) ].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 4: (24,13,right,4) -> [13,24] at t1=9, then at T: [13+4*(T-9), 24+4*(T-9)].\n\nNow, we are at turn t1=9. We need to plan actions for turns 9, 10, 11, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence.\n\nConstraints:\n  - We start at y=5 at turn 9.\n  - We can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). And we must stay in [0,9].\n\nWe have to avoid being on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nApproach:\n  We can try to simulate the moves and check for collisions. We want the minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible? But we must avoid cars.\n\nHowever, note that we can also stay or even go down to avoid a collision and then go up.\n\nBut the target is at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1 to 8) so we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe are at y=5 at turn 9. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars is 4 moves (all U: 5->6->7->8->9).\n\nBut we have to check for collisions at each freeway we step on.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t (starting at t=9). We are going to simulate turns t=9,10,11,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll check at each turn, if our y is between 1 and 8, then we must check the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nHow to compute the car spans at a future turn T (relative to t1=9)?\n\nFor a car given at t1=9: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h0, τ0, d, s)\n\nAt turn T (>=9):\n  If d = right: the span becomes [τ0 + s*(T-9), h0 + s*(T-9)]\n  If d = left: the span becomes [h0 - s*(T-9), τ0 - s*(T-9)]\n\nBut note: the initial representation for right-moving cars: the head is the rightmost? So in the freeway 4 example: (-12,-23,right,4): \n  At T=9: [ -23 + 4*(0), -12 + 4*(0) ] = [-23, -12] -> and 0 is not in [-23,-12]? So safe at turn 9? But we are at y=5 at turn 9, so we are on freeway 5? So we don't check freeway 4 at turn 9.\n\nBut wait, we are at (0,5) at turn 9. So we are on freeway 5? Then we must check the cars on freeway 5 at turn 9.\n\nFreeway 5: \n  (60,49,right,12) -> [49,60] at T=9? Actually, the table says: \n      Cars: (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFor the first car: (head=60, tail=49, right, speed=12) -> span at T=9: [49 + 12*(0), 60 + 12*(0)] = [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n  Second car: (head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=12) -> span at T=9: [-23 + 0, -12 + 0] = [-23,-12] -> 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 9, we are safe at freeway 5.\n\nNow, what if we try to move up? \n\nAt turn 9: we are at y=5. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nPlan: \n  Turn 9: U -> y becomes 6 at turn 10? \n      But note: at the moment of turn 9, we are at y=5. Then we take action U, so at turn 10 we will be at y=6.\n\n  However, we must check at turn 10: when we are at y=6, that is freeway 6 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 6 at turn 10 (T=10, so T-9=1):\n  Cars: \n      (60,49,right,12) -> becomes [49+12*1, 60+12*1] = [61,72] -> 0 not in [61,72]\n      (-12,-23,right,12) -> becomes [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> now 0 is in [-11,0]? \n          The span is [-11,0]. Is 0 included? Yes, because it's a closed interval? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\".\n\nSo at turn 10, if we are on freeway 6, we would collide with the second car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 6 at turn 10.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn 9? Because that would put us at freeway 6 at turn 10.\n\nAlternatively, we might do S at turn 9: then at turn 10 we are still at y=5 (freeway 5). Then we must check freeway 5 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 5 at turn 10 (T=10):\n  First car: [49+12, 60+12] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  Second car: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo if we stay at turn 9, then at turn 10 we are at y=5 (freeway 5) and we collide with the second car.\n\nWhat about going down? \n  If we do D at turn 9: then at turn 10 we are at y=4 (freeway 4).\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 10 (T=10):\n  Cars: \n      (-12,-23,right,4) -> becomes [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8] -> 0 not in [-19,-8] -> safe.\n      (24,13,right,4) -> [13+4,24+4] = [17,28] -> safe.\n      (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4,60+4] = [53,64] -> safe.\n\nSo going down at turn 9 is safe at turn 10.\n\nBut then we are at y=4, which is further from 9. So we need more steps.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait a turn? But we saw that staying at turn 9 leads to collision at turn 10.\n\nSo at turn 9, we cannot do U (because then we collide at turn 10 on freeway 6) and we cannot do S (collide at freeway 5 at turn 10). So we must do D? \n\nBut let me check: if we do D at turn 9, then at turn 10 we are at y=4 (freeway 4) and we are safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, we can try to go up? \n  At turn 10: we are at y=4. We can choose U, D, S.\n\nIf we choose U at turn 10: then at turn 11 we are at y=5 (freeway 5). \n\nCheck freeway 5 at turn 11 (T=11, so T-9=2):\n  First car: [49+12*2, 60+12*2] = [49+24,60+24] = [73,84] -> safe.\n  Second car: [-23+12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 11, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nThen at turn 11 we are at y=5. Then we can do U again at turn 11: to go to y=6 at turn 12.\n\nCheck freeway 6 at turn 12 (T=12, T-9=3):\n  Cars on freeway 6:\n      (60,49,right,12): [49+12*3,60+12*3] = [49+36,60+36] = [85,96] -> safe.\n      (-12,-23,right,12): [-23+12*3, -12+12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn 12: we are at y=6. Then we do U: to y=7 at turn 13.\n\nCheck freeway 7 at turn 13 (T=13, T-9=4):\n  Cars on freeway 7: same as freeway 6? Actually, the table shows the same two cars for freeways 5,6,7,8? \n      Freeway 7: (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n  So: \n      [49+12*4,60+12*4] = [49+48,60+48] = [97,108] -> safe.\n      [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 13: we are at y=7. Then U to y=8 at turn 14.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at turn 14 (T=14, T-9=5):\n  Cars on freeway 8: same two cars.\n      [49+12*5,60+12*5] = [49+60,60+60] = [109,120] -> safe.\n      [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 14: we are at y=8. Then U to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, we are at y=9, which is safe (not a freeway). So we have reached the goal.\n\nSequence of actions:\n  Turn 9: D (from y=5 to y=4)\n  Turn 10: U (from y=4 to y=5)\n  Turn 11: U (from y=5 to y=6)\n  Turn 12: U (from y=6 to y=7)\n  Turn 13: U (from y=7 to y=8)\n  Turn 14: U (from y=8 to y=9)\n\nH = 6 turns? But note: we start at turn 9 and we do actions at turn 9,10,11,12,13,14 -> that's 6 actions, and we end at turn 14 (after 6 actions) we are at y=9? Actually:\n\n  t=9: start at y=5, do D -> t=10: y=4\n  t=10: do U -> t=11: y=5\n  t=11: do U -> t=12: y=6\n  t=12: do U -> t=13: y=7\n  t=13: do U -> t=14: y=8\n  t=14: do U -> t=15: y=9\n\nSo at turn 15 we are at y=9. We started at turn 9 and we used 6 actions (from turn 9 to 14). H=6.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe must avoid the collision at turn 10 at freeway 5 and 6.\n\nWhat if we do D at turn 9 and then at turn 10 we do U? That's what we did. But then we go up until turn 14.\n\nAlternatively, can we do two downs? Then we go to y=3 at turn 10? Then we have to climb more.\n\nOr maybe we can wait at y=4 for a turn? But that would take more steps.\n\nBut note: we might try to go up at a later time to avoid the car on freeway 5 at turn 10 and freeway 6 at turn 10.\n\nLet me check: \n  The dangerous time for freeway 5 is when the second car's span includes 0. \n      The car: (-12,-23,right,12) at T: span = [-23+12*(T-9), -12+12*(T-9)]\n      We have 0 in the span when: \n          -23+12*(T-9) <= 0 <= -12+12*(T-9)\n          => 12*(T-9) >= 23   and 12*(T-9) >= 12 -> so the smallest T-9 such that 12*(T-9) >=23? T-9>= ceil(23/12)= ceil(1.916)=2.\n          Actually, at T-9=1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? But note: the interval is [a,b] meaning a<=x<=b? So 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes.\n          At T-9=2: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  Similarly, freeway 6: same car? Actually, the same car appears on freeway 5 and 6? But note: the car on freeway 5 is the same as on 6? But they are different freeways. The car on freeway 5 is only for freeway 5? \n\nBut wait, the table lists for each freeway separately. So freeway 5 has two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12). Similarly freeway 6 has the same two cars? \n\nSo the dangerous time for freeway 5 is at T=10 (T-9=1) and for freeway 6 also at T=10? Actually, at T=10, the second car on freeway 5 is dangerous, and the second car on freeway 6 is dangerous at T=10? \n\nBut note: the car on freeway 6 at T=10: \n  (-12,-23,right,12) -> becomes [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> so 0 is included -> dangerous.\n\nSo both freeway 5 and 6 are dangerous at T=10.\n\nBut if we are not on freeway 5 or 6 at T=10, then we are safe.\n\nWe could try to skip freeway 5 and 6 at T=10? \n\nBut how? We are at y=5 at T=9. \n\nOption 1: Do nothing (S) at T=9 -> then we are at y=5 (freeway 5) at T=9? Actually, we already checked: at T=9, freeway5 is safe. But then at T=10, if we are still at y=5 (if we do S again at T=9 and then S at T=10? Or if we do U at T=9 we go to y=6 at T=10, which is dangerous, or if we do D at T=9 we go to y=4 at T=10 which is safe.\n\nBut we cannot stay at T=10 at freeway 5 because it is dangerous? \n\nSo we must leave freeway 5 at T=10? But we are at T=9 at freeway5. Then at T=9 we can choose to leave: either up or down. Up leads to freeway6 at T=10 (dangerous) and down to freeway4 at T=10 (safe).\n\nSo we must go down at T=9.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid freeway5 and freeway6 at T=10 by moving twice? \n\nAlternatively, we might do nothing at T=9 (stay at y=5) and then at T=10 we move? But at T=10 we are at freeway5 and it is dangerous? So we cannot be there.\n\nUnless we move at T=10 to leave freeway5? But the collision happens at the moment we are on freeway5 at T=10? So if we are at freeway5 at T=10, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway5 at T=10. Similarly, we must not be on freeway6 at T=10.\n\nSo the only safe freeway at T=10 is y=4? (if we go down from 5) or y=0,1,2,3,7,8,9? But we are at y=5 at T=9. We can only move to y=4,5,6 at T=10? So only y=4 is safe? \n\nBut what about y=0? We can't get to y=0 in one step from y=5? Only to 4,5,6.\n\nSo we must go to y=4 at T=10.\n\nThen we can go up at T=10 to y=5 at T=11? And we checked freeway5 at T=11 is safe (because the dangerous car at freeway5 at T=11 has moved to [1,12] and 0 is not in there).\n\nSo that seems the only option.\n\nBut what if we try to go to y=3? Then we have to climb more steps. That would be slower.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go to y=6 at a later turn? \n\nFor example, if we wait at y=4 for one turn? Then at T=10: we are at y=4 (safe). Then at T=10 we do S? Then at T=11 we are still at y=4. Then at T=11 we do U to y=5 at T=12? \n\nBut check freeway5 at T=12: \n  T=12: T-9=3\n  Second car: [-23+12*3, -12+12*3] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed. But then we do:\n  Turn9: D -> y=4 at T=10\n  Turn10: S -> y=4 at T=11\n  Turn11: U -> y=5 at T=12\n  Then turn12: U -> y=6 at T=13\n  Then turn13: U -> y=7 at T=14\n  Then turn14: U -> y=8 at T=15\n  Then turn15: U -> y=9 at T=16\n\nThat takes 7 moves. We already have a 6-move solution.\n\nSo we stick with the 6-move solution.\n\nBut let me check if we can do a 5-move solution? \n\nWe start at y=5 at turn9. We need to get to y=9 by turn14? (because 9 to 14 is 5 turns? Then H=5?).\n\nBut we must avoid freeway5 at turn10 and freeway6 at turn10.\n\nWhat if we go up at turn9? Then we are at y=6 at turn10 -> collision? \n\nWhat if we go down at turn9 to y=4 at turn10, then at turn10 we go up to y=5 at turn11, then at turn11 we go up to y=6 at turn12, then at turn12 to y=7 at turn13, then at turn13 to y=8 at turn14, then at turn14 to y=9 at turn15? That's 6 moves.\n\nBut we want to end at turn14? Then we would have done 5 moves? But then we would be at y=8 at turn14? Then we need one more to go to y=9.\n\nAlternatively, can we skip a step? \n\nNote: we have to go from y=5 to y=9: 4 steps up. But we cannot do 4 consecutive ups because:\n\n  If we do U at turn9: to y=6 at turn10 -> collision (as we saw).\n  If we do U at turn10: then we must be at y=5 at turn10? But we can't because at turn10 freeway5 is dangerous.\n\nSo we have to avoid turn10 for freeway5 and freeway6.\n\nWhat if we do two downs? \n  Turn9: D -> y=4 at turn10 (safe)\n  Turn10: D -> y=3 at turn11\n\nThen we are at y=3 at turn11. Then we need to go up 6 times: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: that's 6 moves from turn11 to turn16? Then total moves: 8 moves? Not better.\n\nAlternatively, we might do:\n  Turn9: D -> y=4 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> y=5 at turn11 (safe, as we saw)\n  Turn11: U -> y=6 at turn12 (safe, as we saw)\n  Then we are at y=6 at turn12. Then we have two more moves to get to y=9? We need 3 moves: 6->7->8->9, so at turn15 we get to y=9. That's 6 moves total.\n\nBut what if we do three ups in a row from turn11? \n  Turn11: at y=5 -> U to y=6 at turn12\n  Turn12: U to y=7 at turn13\n  Turn13: U to y=8 at turn14\n  Turn14: U to y=9 at turn15 -> same as before.\n\nCan we do two moves in one step? No, we can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: can we go to freeway7 or 8 earlier? \n\nBut we are at y=5. To get to y=7 in one move? No, we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me check if there is a 5-move solution by avoiding the collision in another way.\n\nWe note that the car on freeway5 and freeway6 at turn10 is dangerous. But what if we are at freeway5 at turn9 and then at turn9 we move up to freeway6 at turn10? Then we are on freeway6 at turn10 -> collision.\n\nOr if we move down to freeway4 at turn10 -> safe.\n\nBut then we have to climb back.\n\nWhat if we do a double move? We can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if we do nothing at turn9? Then we are at freeway5 at turn10 -> collision.\n\nSo we have to leave freeway5 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me check the car movements again to be sure.\n\nAt turn10 (T=10, T-9=1):\n\nFreeway4: \n  Car1: (-12,-23,right,4) -> [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n  Car2: (24,13,right,4) -> [13+4,24+4] = [17,28] -> safe.\n  Car3: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4,60+4] = [53,64] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5:\n  Car1: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12,60+12] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> dangerous.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  Car1: (60,49,right,12) -> [61,72] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n\nFreeway7: same two cars? -> same as above -> dangerous? \n  Actually, for freeway7 at turn10: \n      Car1: [49+12,60+12] = [61,72] -> safe.\n      Car2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same -> dangerous.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the freeway we are on. At turn10, if we are on freeway4, we are safe. The other freeways (5,6,7,8) are dangerous at turn10.\n\nAt turn11 (T=11, T-9=2):\n\nFreeway4:\n  Car1: [-23+4*2, -12+4*2] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n  Car2: [13+8,24+8] = [21,32] -> safe.\n  Car3: [49+8,60+8] = [57,68] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5:\n  Car1: [49+24,60+24] = [73,84] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  Car2: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 7 and 8: safe.\n\nSo at turn11, freeway5 is safe.\n\nThen we can go to freeway5 at turn11.\n\nSimilarly, at turn12, freeway6 is safe? \n  Freeway6 at turn12 (T=12, T-9=3):\n      Car2: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n\nBut wait, at turn14 we are at y=8 and we do U to y=9 at turn15. So we have 6 moves.\n\nBut note: we must write the actions for turns 9 to 14 (6 actions) and then we are at y=9 at turn15.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{9} = D\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{10} = U\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{11} = U\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{12} = U\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{13} = U\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{14} = U\n\nH = 6.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1? So from turn9 to turn14 (inclusive) -> 6 actions.\n\nWe output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1? \n\nSo for t=0: a_{9+0}=a9\nt=1: a10\n...\nt=5: a14\n\nYes.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut let me double-check if we can do it in 5 moves? \n\nSuppose we do at turn9: D (to y=4 at turn10)\nThen turn10: U (to y=5 at turn11)\nThen turn11: U (to y=6 at turn12)\nThen turn12: U (to y=7 at turn13)\nThen turn13: U (to y=8 at turn14) -> then at turn14 we are at y=8, not 9. We need one more to get to 9.\n\nSo we must have 6 moves.\n\nAlternatively, what if we do a more aggressive move? \n\nAt turn9: D -> y=4 at turn10\nAt turn10: U -> y=5 at turn11\nAt turn11: U -> y=6 at turn12\nAt turn12: U -> y=7 at turn13\nAt turn13: U -> y=8 at turn14\nAt turn14: U -> y=9 at turn15\n\nYes, 6 moves.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 at turn14? \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn14, we must have been at y=8 at turn13 and then done U at turn13. But at turn13 we are at y=8? How do we get to y=8 at turn13?\n\nFrom y=5 at turn9, we need 3 moves to get to y=8: \n  turn9: U -> y=6 at turn10 (collision) -> not possible.\n  turn9: D -> then we are at y=4 at turn10, then we need to go from 4 to 8: 4 moves: \n        turn10: U ->5\n        turn11: U->6\n        turn12: U->7\n        turn13: U->8\n        then at turn14: U->9 -> that's 6 moves.\n\nAlternatively, if we go from y=5 to y=5 at turn9 (stay) -> then at turn10 we are at y=5 (collision) -> not possible.\n\nSo no 5-move solution.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 6. The sequence of actions is determined by simulating the player's movement and checking for collisions at each turn based on the car positions, which update according to their speeds and directions.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Analysis:\n- **At turn 10 (T=10, relative turn 1):**\n  - Freeway 5: The car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\) has span \\([-23 + 12 \\times 1, -12 + 12 \\times 1] = [-11, 0]\\), which includes 0. Thus, freeway 5 is unsafe.\n  - Freeway 6: The car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\) has the same span \\([-11, 0]\\), including 0. Thus, freeway 6 is unsafe.\n  - Freeway 4: The cars are safe (spans do not include 0). Moving down to freeway 4 avoids collision.\n\n- **At turn 11 (T=11, relative turn 2):**\n  - Freeway 5: The car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\) has span \\([-23 + 12 \\times 2, -12 + 12 \\times 2] = [1, 12]\\), excluding 0. Safe to move to freeway 5.\n- Subsequent moves upward (turns 12–14) are safe as car spans no longer include 0 on freeways 6–8.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 9 (current turn):** Move down (D) to avoid freeway 5 at turn 10. Position becomes (0, 4) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10:** Move up (U) to freeway 5, which is now safe. Position becomes (0, 5) at turn 11.\n- **Turns 11–14:** Move up (U) consecutively to reach freeway 9. Positions: (0, 6) at turn 12, (0, 7) at turn 13, (0, 8) at turn 14, and (0, 9) at turn 15.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) in 6 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 10 and the player is at (0,4). We must reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at that turn) and at that same turn T, the x=0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nImportant: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at the moment of the turn T, the player is on y_T and only checks the cars on that freeway (y_T) at turn T.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (which is 10). For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\n- For a left-moving car (if direction is left, but in our data we see only right? Actually the data says \"right\" for all, so all cars are moving right? But note: the update rule for right-moving is: \n    Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]   ??? Wait, let me check the update rule:\n\nThe update rule says:\n  - Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the initial representation: \n  For a right-moving car, the initial span at t1 is [tau, head] (with tau <= head) and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the given data, we have for each car: (head, tail, direction, speed). But the representation in the table is a bit confusing because for right-moving cars, the head is the front (which is the larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the initial span for a right-moving car is [tail, head] (if we interpret tail as the rear and head as the front). However, in the update rule for right-moving, it says:\n    initial: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the data, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So we must note that the representation in the data is (head, tail) meaning that the head is the front and tail is the rear. Therefore, for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tail, head]. Similarly, for left-moving, the initial span would be [head, tail] but with head being the front? Actually, the update rule for left-moving says: initial span [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So in that case, the head h is the front (which is at a larger x at t1) and then moves left, so the front becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the rear becomes tau - s*(T-t1). But in our data, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car on a freeway, we have:\n  direction = 'right'\n  initial span at t1 = [tail, head]   (because tail is the rear, head is the front)\n\nBut wait: look at the data for freeway 4: \n  (-8, -19, right, 4) -> so tail = -19, head = -8? But then the span at t1 is [-19, -8]? \n  But note: the update rule for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] \n      = [-19 + 4*(T-10), -8 + 4*(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: \n  (0, -11, right, 12): tail = -11, head = 0 -> initial span at t1: [-11, 0]. Then at T: \n      [-11 + 12*(T-10), 0 + 12*(T-10)]\n\nBut note: at turn t1=10, for that car on freeway 5: \n  T=10: span = [-11+0, 0+0] = [-11,0]. So x=0 is at the head? But the rule says: collision if 0 is in the span. At T=10, 0 is in [-11,0] (since it includes 0). However, the player is currently at (0,4) at turn t1=10. But the freeway for the car on freeway 5 is y=5. The player is on y=4 at turn 10. So no collision at turn 10.\n\nHowever, if the player moves to y=5 at some turn T, then at that turn T we must check if there is any car on freeway 5 that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions from turn 10 (t1) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that the player starts at y=4. We need to get to y=9, so we need at least 5 upward moves. But we can also move down and then up? However, moving down might be necessary to avoid a car? But note the goal is to minimize H (the number of turns). So we want to do it in as few turns as possible. The minimal H is 5 if we can move up 5 times without being hit by a car.\n\nBut we must check for each freeway we step on at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns starting from t=10.\n\nWe are going to consider the state at each turn: the player's y-coordinate and the positions of the cars (which we can compute for any future turn T).\n\nHowever, note that the cars move continuously with time. We are given their state at t1=10. For a car (tail, head, d, s) at t1, at turn T (>=10) the car on freeway k will have:\n  if right-moving: \n      new_tail = tail + s*(T-10)\n      new_head = head + s*(T-10)\n\nWe then check for collision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k), and if there is any car on freeway k such that the span [new_tail, new_head] contains 0.\n\nWe are to avoid any such collision.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the states (turn, y) but note that the turn can go arbitrarily high? But we are looking for minimal H, so we can bound H by say 20? But we must be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check the safe moves.\n\nBut note: the cars move in a periodic manner? Actually, the cars move linearly and the road is infinite? But we only care about when the car spans cover 0.\n\nHowever, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k the times (turns) when that car covers 0. But note: the car covers 0 at turn T if:\n  new_tail <= 0 <= new_head\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n  tail + s*(T-10) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-10)\n\nBut note: it might cover 0 at multiple T? Actually, it covers 0 for a continuous interval of T? But we are only checking at integer turns. However, the car might cover 0 for a consecutive set of turns? Actually, the length of the car is (head - tail) and the speed is s, so the car will cover 0 for (head - tail) / s turns? Actually, the time the car takes to pass 0 is (length) / speed = (head - tail) / s. But since we are in integer turns, the number of consecutive turns for which 0 is covered is ceil((head - tail) / s) ? Actually, we can compute:\n\n  The car covers 0 at T if:\n      tail + s*(T-10) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-10)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  T_min: the smallest T (>=10) such that head + s*(T-10) >= 0   -> T >= 10 + ceil(-head/s) ? But we have two inequalities.\n\n  Actually:\n      tail + s*(T-10) <= 0   => T <= 10 + (0 - tail) / s   [if s>0] -> T <= 10 + (-tail)/s\n      and\n      head + s*(T-10) >= 0   => T >= 10 + (-head)/s\n\nBut note: since the car moves to the right, the front (head) must be at least 0 and the rear (tail) must be at most 0.\n\nSo T must be in [ceil(10 + (-head)/s), floor(10 + (-tail)/s)]? But note: because T is integer, we have:\n\n  T_min = ceil(10 + max( (-head)/s, (-tail - (head-tail)? ) ) -> Actually, we have:\n\n  Rear at T: tail + s*(T-10) must be <= 0 -> T <= 10 + (-tail)/s\n  Front at T: head + s*(T-10) must be >= 0 -> T >= 10 + (-head)/s\n\nBut note: (-head)/s might be fractional. So:\n\n  T must satisfy:\n      T >= 10 + ceil( (-head) / s )   ? Actually: \n          head + s*(T-10) >= 0   => s*(T-10) >= -head   => T-10 >= ceil(-head/s) if we are to have the inequality? But note: if (-head) is negative then we get T-10 >= a negative number -> always true? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\n  For the front to be at least 0: \n      head + s*(T-10) >= 0\n      => T >= 10 - head/s\n\n  For the rear to be at most 0:\n      tail + s*(T-10) <= 0\n      => T <= 10 - tail/s\n\nBut note: head and tail are negative? In the data we have: \n  freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12) -> head=0, tail=-11. Then:\n      Front condition: 0 + 12*(T-10) >= 0 -> T>=10 (always true for T>=10)\n      Rear condition: -11 + 12*(T-10) <= 0 -> 12*(T-10) <= 11 -> T-10 <= 11/12 -> T<=10. So only at T=10? \n\nBut at T=10: \n      rear = -11 + 0 = -11 <=0, front=0>=0 -> so 0 is covered at T=10.\n\nBut wait: the car is given at t1=10: (head, tail) = (0, -11) -> so the span is [-11,0] which includes 0.\n\nNow, at T=11: \n      rear = -11 + 12 = 1 -> which is >0, and front=0+12=12>0 -> so the span is [1,12] which does not include 0.\n\nSo this car only covers 0 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12) at T=10: span=[-59+0, -48+0] = [-59,-48] -> no 0.\n\nAt T=11: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> still no.\n\nWe can compute for each car the set of turns T (>=10) for which 0 is in the span.\n\nBut note: the car might cover 0 for a consecutive set of turns? Actually, the car moves continuously, so the set of T for which 0 is covered is an interval of real numbers. But we only care about integer T. And the length of the interval in time is (length of car) / speed = (head - tail) / s. Since the car moves at speed s per turn, it takes (head-tail)/s turns for the entire car to pass a fixed point. So the integer turns for which 0 is covered are consecutive? \n\nBut note: the car might start covering 0 at a fractional time and end at a fractional time. So the integer turns covered are consecutive? \n\nYes, because the condition for 0 to be covered is that the rear is <=0 and the front>=0. As the car moves, the rear increases and the front increases. So there is a starting turn T_start (the smallest integer T such that front>=0 and rear<=0) and an ending turn T_end (the largest integer T such that front>=0 and rear<=0). Actually, when the car moves, the rear becomes greater than 0 at some turn and then 0 is no longer covered. Similarly, the front might become negative? Actually, the car is moving to the right, so the front only increases and the rear only increases. So once the car has passed 0, the rear becomes positive and then 0 is never covered again. And before the car arrives, the front is negative and then 0 is not covered.\n\nTherefore, for each car, we can compute:\n\n  T_start = ceil(10 + max( (-head)/s, (-tail)/s ? )) -> Actually, we require:\n      head + s*(T-10) >= 0   => T >= 10 + ceil(-head/s)   [if (-head)/s is not integer, then ceil; if negative, then we use 10]\n      but note: if head>=0, then the front condition is already satisfied at T=10.\n\n  Actually, we can compute the smallest integer T such that head + s*(T-10) >= 0 -> T = max(10, ceil(10 - head/s))\n\n  Similarly, the largest integer T such that tail + s*(T-10) <= 0 -> T = min( ... )? Actually, we require the condition to hold simultaneously.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n      The car covers 0 at T if and only if:\n          tail + s*(T-10) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-10)\n\n      Rearranged:\n          ( -head ) / s <= T-10 <= ( -tail ) / s\n\n      So T-10 must be in the interval [ (-head)/s, (-tail)/s ]\n\n      Then the integer T in [10 + ceil( (-head)/s ), 10 + floor( (-tail)/s )]   [if the interval is non-empty]\n\nBut note: because the car moves right, we have head>tail (and both negative at t1? or not? In freeway 5: head=0, tail=-11 -> so head>tail). So (-head) < (-tail) because head>tail (so -head < -tail). Then the interval is [ (-head)/s, (-tail)/s ] which is increasing? Actually, (-head) is less than (-tail) so (-head)/s < (-tail)/s.\n\nTherefore, the integer T must satisfy:\n      T_min = ceil(10 + (-head)/s)\n      T_max = floor(10 + (-tail)/s)\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious with negative numbers.\n\nExample: freeway 5 car (0,-11,right,12) at t1=10:\n      (-head)/s = 0/12 = 0 -> T_min = ceil(10+0)=10\n      (-tail)/s = 11/12 -> about 0.916, so floor(10+0.916)=10. So T in [10,10] -> only T=10.\n\nAnother example: freeway 4 car (-8,-19,right,4):\n      head=-8, tail=-19\n      (-head)/s = 8/4=2 -> T_min = ceil(10+2)=12\n      (-tail)/s = 19/4=4.75 -> T_max = floor(10+4.75)=14. So T=12,13,14.\n\nCheck:\n  T=12: \n      tail = -19 + 4*(12-10) = -19+8=-11 -> so rear=-11<=0\n      head = -8 + 8 = 0 -> front=0>=0 -> covers 0? yes, because 0 is in [-11,0].\n  T=13: \n      rear = -19+12 = -7 -> <=0? yes. front=-8+12=4 -> >=0 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> yes.\n  T=14:\n      rear = -19+16=-3 -> <=0. front=-8+16=8>=0 -> 0 in [-3,8] -> yes.\n  T=15:\n      rear = -19+20=1 -> >0 -> does not cover 0.\n\nSo indeed T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k the set of turns T (>=10) for which the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: for a given freeway k, if multiple cars are present, then the freeway k is blocked at turn T if at least one car covers 0 at T.\n\nWe then build a set of (turn, freeway) pairs that are blocked.\n\nHowever, note that the player moves one step at a time and we are only concerned with the freeway we are on at the current turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn t=10 onward. We start at y=4.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of turns is 5 (if we can move up 5 times). But we have to avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when that freeway k is blocked at T.\n\nWe can try to move up as much as possible, but we must avoid the blocked (T, k).\n\nAlternatively, we can use BFS in state (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 10) and y is the current position (0..9). The actions are U, D, S.\n\nBut note: the state space is small: t can go up to 10+? but we are minimizing H (the number of steps). We can break when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must check for each state (t, y) if we are on freeway y at turn t and if that freeway y is blocked at turn t? But note: if y is 0 or 9, there are no cars? The freeways are from 1 to 8. So if y=0 or y=9, no car can hit us. But the goal is (0,9) and we are safe at y=9.\n\nHowever, we are only concerned with freeways 1..8.\n\nSo when the player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision check is needed.\n\nWe start at (10,4). We must check: at turn 10, we are on freeway 4. Is freeway 4 blocked at turn 10?\n\nLet's compute for freeway 4 at T=10:\n\nCars on freeway 4:\n  Car1: (-8,-19,right,4): at T=10: span = [-19, -8] -> does not cover 0? (because -19<=0<=-8 -> 0 is not in [-19,-8]? because -8<0? Actually, -8 is negative, so 0 is not in the span. So safe.\n  Car2: (28,17,right,4): wait, head=28, tail=17? But that would be a car that is 11 units long? and at T=10: [17,28] -> which is positive? so 0 not covered.\n  Car3: (-48,-59,right,4): [-59,-48] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 4 is safe at T=10.\n\nTherefore, we can start.\n\nWe want the minimal H. We'll try to do a BFS by increasing time.\n\nWe'll let the state be (turn, y). We start at (10,4) with H=0 (we haven't taken any action yet, but we are at the start). Then we take actions for the next turns.\n\nBut note: the problem says: we are to output a sequence of actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we land on y=9. The minimal H is the number of actions we take until we land on y=9 at the end of the sequence.\n\nSo we start at turn t1 (10) and we are at y=4. Then we take an action at turn 10 to move to turn 11, and so on.\n\nWe simulate:\n\n  At turn T, we are at y. Then we choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then we update y' = y + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S) [clamped to 0..9]. Then we move to (T+1, y')? \n\nWait, no: the action a_t is taken at turn t and it updates the position for the next turn. But note: the state at turn t is (0, y_t). Then we take action a_t and then the next state is (0, y_{t+1}) at turn t+1.\n\nHowever, the collision check: at turn T, we are at y_T. Then we take action a_T and then we are at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nBut the collision check is only at the turn we are on the freeway. So at turn T, we are at y_T. If y_T is between 1 and 8, we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T. Then we take the action and then at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1} and then check again.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (T, y), we are about to take an action at turn T. But we have already been checked for collision at turn T? Actually, we start at (10,4): we are at turn 10 and we are at y=4. Then we take an action a_10 and then at the next turn (11) we are at y_11 = 4 + delta.\n\nBut when did we check for collision at turn 10? We must have checked at the beginning of turn 10? Actually, the problem states: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (y_T) and 0 is in the span of a car on k at turn T.\n\nSo when we are at (10,4), we have already passed the collision check for turn 10? Or do we need to check at the moment we are at that state? \n\nThe problem says: we start at (0, y_{t1}) at turn t1. And then we take actions. So the initial state is given and we assume we are safe at turn t1? Actually, the problem says: \"avoid collisions\" meaning we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. So we must check at turn t1 as well? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". And we start at turn t1. So we must be safe at turn t1.\n\nIn the data, we have freeway 5 at turn 10: one car covers 0. But we are at freeway 4 at turn 10, so we are safe.\n\nSo in our BFS, when we are at state (T, y), we must check: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check if freeway y is blocked at turn T. If it is, then this state is invalid and we skip. If not, then we can take an action.\n\nThen we consider the next state (T+1, y') for y' = y, y+1, or y-1 (if within bounds).\n\nBut note: if we choose to stay (S), then we remain at y and the next state is (T+1, y). But we have to check at turn T+1 if y is between 1 and 8.\n\nWe start at (10,4): we check freeway4 at T=10: safe -> valid.\n\nThen we can choose U, D, S.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns (which is the number of actions) until we land at y=9.\n\nWe do BFS by the number of steps (which is H). We break when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait (by staying) to avoid a car.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on k, the set of turns T (>=10) for which the car covers 0. Then for each freeway k, we have a set of blocked turns.\n\nLet's compute the blocked turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Cars: [(-18,-29,right,3)]\n  For car: head=-18, tail=-29, s=3\n      T_min = ceil(10 + (18)/3) = ceil(10+6)=16\n      T_max = floor(10 + 29/3) = floor(10+9.666)=19\n      So blocked at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: blocked at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 3: same: blocked at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 4: \n  Car1: (-8,-19,right,4): \n        T_min = ceil(10+8/4)=ceil(10+2)=12\n        T_max = floor(10+19/4)=floor(10+4.75)=14 -> blocked at 12,13,14.\n  Car2: (28,17,right,4): wait, head=28, tail=17? Then:\n        Condition: tail + s*(T-10) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-10)\n        -> 17+4*(T-10) <= 0 and 28+4*(T-10)>=0\n        First inequality: 4*(T-10) <= -17 -> T-10 <= -17/4 = -4.25 -> T<=5.75 -> impossible for T>=10 -> so never blocked.\n        Actually, at T=10: [17,28] -> both positive -> doesn't cover 0. And as T increases, the car moves to the right -> so never covers 0.\n  Car3: (-48,-59,right,4):\n        T_min = ceil(10+48/4)=ceil(10+12)=22\n        T_max = floor(10+59/4)=floor(10+14.75)=24\n        So blocked at T=22,23,24.\n\n  Therefore, freeway4 is blocked at T=12,13,14,22,23,24.\n\nFreeway5:\n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,12): \n        T_min = ceil(10+48/12)=ceil(10+4)=14\n        T_max = floor(10+59/12)=floor(10+4.916)=14 -> only T=14? \n        Check: \n            T=14: tail=-59+12*(4)= -59+48=-11; head=-48+48=0 -> [-11,0] -> covers 0? yes.\n            T=15: tail=-59+60=1>0 -> doesn't cover.\n        So T=14.\n  Car2: (0,-11,right,12): \n        T_min = ceil(10+0)=10\n        T_max = floor(10+11/12)=10 -> only T=10.\n        But T=10: we are not on freeway5 at turn10? but we are at 4. So if we are on freeway5 at turn10 we would be hit? but we aren't.\n\n        So for freeway5: \n            T=10: blocked by car2? but note: at T=10, the car is at [ -11, 0] -> covers 0.\n            T=14: blocked by car1.\n\n        Therefore, freeway5 is blocked at T=10 and T=14.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5: blocked at T=10 and T=14.\n\nFreeway7: same: blocked at T=10 and T=14.\n\nFreeway8: same: blocked at T=10 and T=14.\n\nNow, we can simulate:\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nWe start at (10,4). We check: at (10,4): freeway4 is safe.\n\nThen we can do U, D, S.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we try U first? But we'll do BFS by the number of steps.\n\nWe maintain a queue: each element is (turn, y, path_actions) \nWe start: (10, 4, [])\n\nThen we generate:\n  For each action: \n      a = U: y' = 5, turn' = 11 -> state (11,5)\n      a = D: y' = 3, turn' = 11\n      a = S: y' = 4, turn' = 11\n\nNow, at state (11,5): we must check: at turn11, we are on freeway5 -> is freeway5 blocked at 11?\n        freeway5: blocked at T=10 and T=14 -> so T=11 is safe? \n        Therefore, (11,5) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (11,3): freeway3 at T=11: freeway3 blocked at T=16,17,18,19 -> safe at 11.\n        (11,4): freeway4 at T=11: freeway4 blocked at 12,13,14,22,23,24 -> safe.\n\nWe then continue.\n\nWe want to reach y=9. We'll expand until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll do a BFS (by the number of steps) to find the shortest path.\n\nWe note that we can only move one step per turn, so the minimal steps is 5 (if we go straight up). Let's try:\n\nOption 1: UUUUU (5 steps)\n\n  Turn10: start at 4 -> U -> to 5 at turn11? \n      Actually: \n        Turn10: at y=4 -> safe. Then we take U -> so at turn11 we are at y=5.\n        Turn11: at y=5 -> check freeway5 at T=11: safe (only blocked at 10 and 14) -> safe. Then U -> to 6 at turn12.\n        Turn12: at y=6 -> freeway6: blocked at T=10,14 -> safe at T=12? -> safe. Then U -> to 7 at turn13.\n        Turn13: at y=7 -> freeway7: blocked at T=10,14 -> safe. Then U -> to 8 at turn14.\n        Turn14: at y=8 -> freeway8: blocked at T=14 -> so at turn14, freeway8 is blocked -> collision.\n\n  So we crash at turn14.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway8 at turn14.\n\nWe might wait (stay) at some freeway to avoid being on freeway8 at turn14.\n\nWe could go up to 7 and then wait until after turn14? Then go to 8 and then to 9.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? But that might take more steps.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  We want to avoid being at freeway8 at turn14.\n\n  We can try to get to freeway7 and then wait at freeway7 for a few turns? Then after turn14, we go up.\n\nBut note: freeway7 is safe at turn14? \n        freeway7 is blocked at T=10 and T=14 -> at turn14, freeway7 is blocked? \n        So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn14 either.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6,5: at turn14, they are blocked? \n        freeway5: blocked at T=14 -> so we cannot be at freeway5 at turn14.\n        freeway6: same.\n        freeway7: same.\n        freeway8: same.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turn14.\n\nBut also, freeway4 at turn14 is blocked? \n        freeway4: blocked at T=12,13,14 -> so at turn14, freeway4 is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: blocked at T=16,17,18,19 -> safe at T=14? \n        freeway3: blocked at 16,17,18,19 -> so at turn14, safe.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway3: safe at T=14.\nFreeway1: same: safe at T=14.\n\nFreeway0: safe (no car).\nFreeway9: safe.\n\nSo at turn14, we can be at freeways 0,1,2,3,9.\n\nWe are at freeway4 at turn10. We have 4 turns to avoid being on freeways 4-8 at turn14? \n\nBut we want to get to 9 as fast as possible. We might go down to 3 and then go up after turn14? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid other blocks.\n\nWe can try:\n\n  Option: go down to 3 and stay until after turn14? Then go up.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Turn10: at 4 -> D to 3 (at turn11)\n      Turn11: at 3 -> safe (freeway3: blocked at 16-19 -> safe at 11). Then we can stay at 3 for a few turns? But we want to minimize time.\n\n      How long to wait? We must avoid being on freeways 4-8 at turn14. So we can be at 3 at turn14.\n\n      Then after turn14, we can go up.\n\n      From turn11 (at 3) to turn14: that's 3 turns. We can do:\n\n          Turn11: at 3 -> S (so at turn12: still at 3)\n          Turn12: at 3 -> S (turn13: 3)\n          Turn13: at 3 -> S (turn14: 3) -> safe at turn14? yes.\n\n      Then at turn14: we are at 3 -> safe.\n\n      Then we start going up: \n          Turn14: at 3 -> U to 4 (turn15)\n          Turn15: at 4 -> check freeway4 at turn15: \n                freeway4: blocked at T=12,13,14, and then next block at T=22,23,24 -> so turn15 is safe? \n                So we go to 4 -> safe. Then U to 5 (turn16)\n          Turn16: at 5 -> freeway5: blocked at T=10,14 -> so turn16 is safe? \n                But wait: we computed only T=10 and T=14? But what about other turns? \n                Actually, we computed for each car: \n                  Car1: only T=14? \n                  Car2: only T=10? \n                So at T=16, freeway5 is safe. Then U to 6 (turn17)\n          Turn17: at 6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5: blocked at T=10,14 -> safe at 17? safe. Then U to 7 (turn18)\n          Turn18: at 7 -> freeway7: blocked at T=10,14 -> safe. Then U to 8 (turn19)\n          Turn19: at 8 -> freeway8: blocked at T=10,14 -> safe? but wait, what about the other cars? \n                freeway8: same as freeway5: only blocked at 10 and 14 -> safe at 19? \n                Then U to 9 (turn20)\n\n      So we reach 9 at turn20.\n\n      Total actions: 10 actions (from turn10 to turn19: 10 actions? actually, we take an action at each turn from 10 to 19 inclusive: 10 actions). \n\n      But note: at turn20 we are at 9? and we don't need to take an action at turn20? because we have already reached.\n\n      Actually, the sequence of actions: \n          We start at turn10: we take action at turn10, then at turn11 we are at the new state, and so on. \n          We take 10 actions: at turns 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 -> and at the end of turn19 we are at 8, then we take U at turn19 to go to 9 at turn20? \n\n      But wait: \n          Turn19: we are at 8 (after the action at turn18). Then at turn19, we take action U -> then at turn20 we are at 9. \n          So we need to take action at turn19 to get to 9 at turn20.\n\n      Therefore, we have 10 actions: \n          H = 10.\n\n      The sequence: \n          turn10: D\n          turn11: S\n          turn12: S\n          turn13: S\n          turn14: S   -> but wait, at turn14 we are at 3 and we do S? then at turn15 we are still at 3? \n          Actually, we did: \n              turn10: D -> to 3 at turn11\n              turn11: S -> at 3 at turn12\n              turn12: S -> at 3 at turn13\n              turn13: S -> at 3 at turn14\n              turn14: we are at 3 -> then we take U to go to 4 at turn15? \n          So we don't need to stay at turn14? We can go up at turn14.\n\n      Then:\n          turn14: U -> to 4 at turn15\n          turn15: U -> to 5 at turn16\n          turn16: U -> to 6 at turn17\n          turn17: U -> to 7 at turn18\n          turn18: U -> to 8 at turn19\n          turn19: U -> to 9 at turn20.\n\n      So the sequence: \n          turn10: D\n          turn11: S\n          turn12: S\n          turn13: S\n          turn14: U\n          turn15: U\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U\n\n      H=10.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nWe might avoid staying so long.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to 5 and then go down? but that might not help.\n\nOr we could go up to 4 and then stay until after turn14? But freeway4 is blocked at turn14, so we cannot be at 4 at turn14.\n\nWe can be at 4 at turn15? which is safe.\n\nSo:\n\n  Option 2:\n\n      Start: turn10: at 4 -> we can stay? \n          turn10: S -> to 4 at turn11 -> freeway4 at turn11: safe? (blocked at 12,13,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n      turn11: S -> to 4 at turn12 -> but freeway4 at turn12: blocked! so we crash.\n\n      So we cannot stay at 4 at turn12.\n\n      Then we must leave 4 by turn11? \n\n      We can go up to 5 at turn11? \n          turn10: U -> to 5 at turn11 -> freeway5 at turn11: safe? (only blocked at 10 and 14 -> safe) -> valid.\n      Now at turn11: at 5 -> we cannot stay at 5 until turn14? because at turn14 we crash. So we must leave 5 by turn13? \n\n      But we can go down? \n          turn11: D -> to 4 at turn12 -> freeway4 at turn12: blocked -> crash.\n\n          turn11: S -> to 5 at turn12 -> freeway5 at turn12: safe? (only blocked at 10,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n          turn12: we are at 5 -> then we can do D? to 4 at turn13 -> freeway4 at turn13: blocked (13 is blocked) -> crash.\n\n          turn11: S -> to 5 at turn12 -> then S again? to 5 at turn13 -> safe? \n          Then turn13: at 5 -> then we must leave to avoid turn14? \n                turn13: D -> to 4 at turn14 -> freeway4 at turn14: blocked -> crash.\n                turn13: U -> to 6 at turn14 -> freeway6 at turn14: blocked -> crash.\n                turn13: S -> to 5 at turn14 -> freeway5 at turn14: blocked -> crash.\n\n      So we crash at turn14 if we are at 5 at turn13.\n\n      Alternatively, from 5 at turn11, we can go up to 6 at turn12? \n          turn11: U -> to 6 at turn12 -> freeway6 at turn12: safe? (only blocked at 10,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n          Then turn12: at 6 -> then we can go down? \n                turn12: D -> to 5 at turn13 -> freeway5 at turn13: safe? (only blocked at 10,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n                Then turn13: at 5 -> then we must avoid being at 5 at turn14? so we go down to 4 at turn14 -> freeway4 at turn14: blocked -> crash.\n\n          Or at turn12: at 6, we stay? \n                turn12: S -> to 6 at turn13 -> safe? \n                turn13: then we must leave: \n                    D to 5 at turn14 -> freeway5: blocked -> crash.\n                    U to 7 at turn14 -> freeway7: blocked -> crash.\n                    S to 6 at turn14 -> freeway6: blocked -> crash.\n\n      So we crash.\n\n      Alternatively, we go from 6 at turn12 to down to 5 at turn13? and then down to 4 at turn14? but 4 is blocked at turn14.\n\n      Or we go up to 7 at turn13? \n          turn12: U -> to 7 at turn13 -> freeway7 at turn13: safe? (only blocked at 10,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n          Then at turn13: at 7 -> then we must avoid being at 7 at turn14? \n                So we go down? to 6 at turn14 -> freeway6: blocked -> crash.\n                Or up? to 8 at turn14 -> freeway8: blocked -> crash.\n                Or stay? -> crash.\n\n      So we crash.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot stay at 5 or above until turn14.\n\nWe must get below freeway5 by turn14.\n\nBut we started at 4. We went up to 5 at turn11. Then we have to go down to 3? \n\n      turn10: U to 5 at turn11 -> safe.\n      turn11: D to 4 at turn12 -> but freeway4 at turn12: blocked -> crash.\n\n      turn10: U to 5 at turn11 -> safe.\n      turn11: D to 4 at turn12 -> crash.\n\n      Alternatively, turn10: U to 5 at turn11 -> safe.\n      turn11: D to 4 at turn12: crash.\n\n      Or turn10: U to 5 at turn11 -> safe.\n      turn11: D to 4 at turn12: crash.\n\n      We cannot avoid crash if we go to 4 at turn12.\n\nSo we must avoid going to 4 at turn12? \n\nBut if we go from 5 at turn11 to 6 at turn12? then we are safe at turn12? but then we have to get down to below 5 by turn14? and we have only 2 turns (turn12 and turn13) to get down from 6 to 3? \n\n      From 6 at turn12: \n          turn12: D to 5 at turn13 -> safe (freeway5 at turn13: safe) \n          turn13: D to 4 at turn14 -> but freeway4 at turn14: blocked -> crash.\n\n      Or turn12: D to 5 at turn13 -> then D to 4 at turn14: crash.\n\n      Or turn12: D to 5 at turn13 -> then D to 4 at turn14: crash.\n\n      Alternatively, turn12: DD? but we can only move one per turn.\n\n      Or turn12: D to 5 at turn13 -> then we go down to 4 at turn14: crash.\n\n      We cannot get to 3 from 5 in one turn: we can only go down one per turn.\n\n      So from 5 at turn13, we can only go to 4 at turn14 -> crash.\n\n      Alternatively, from 6 at turn12: we go down twice? \n          turn12: D to 5 at turn13\n          turn13: D to 4 at turn14 -> crash.\n\n      Or from 6 at turn12: we go down to 5 at turn13, then we go down to 4 at turn14: crash.\n\n      We must get to 3 at turn14? \n          To get to 3 at turn14: \n              at turn13 we must be at 3 or 4? \n                  If at 3: then we stay or go up? but we want to be at 3 at turn14? \n                  If at 4: then we go down to 3 at turn14 -> but freeway3 is safe at turn14? yes, but freeway4 at turn14 is blocked? we are not on freeway4 at turn14? because at turn14 we are at 3? \n\n          How to get to 3 at turn14? \n              We need to be at 3 at turn14: \n                  So at turn13 we must be at 3 (and then stay) or at 4 (and then go down) or at 2 (and then go up) -> but we are at 6 at turn12.\n\n          From 6 at turn12: \n              turn12: D to 5 at turn13\n              turn13: D to 4 at turn14 -> but then we are at 4 at turn14 -> crash.\n\n          Alternatively: \n              turn12: D to 5 at turn13\n              turn13: D to 4 at turn14: crash.\n\n          Or: \n              turn12: D to 5 at turn13\n              turn13: D to 4 at turn14: crash.\n\n          We cannot get to 3 at turn14 from 5 at turn13? because we can only move one step.\n\n      Therefore, we must be at 4 at turn13? then we can go down to 3 at turn14? \n          But to be at 4 at turn13: \n              freeway4 at turn13: blocked! (freeway4 blocked at 13) -> so we crash at turn13.\n\n      So we cannot be at 4 at turn13.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot get to 3 at turn14 from 6 at turn12 in two moves.\n\nSo the first option (going down to 3 at turn11 and then staying until turn14) seems the safe way.\n\nBut can we reduce the number of stays?\n\nWe started at 4 at turn10. We went down to 3 at turn11 (one move). Then we have to wait until after turn14? So we must be at 3 at turn14? \n\nBut we can be at 3 at turn14 by:\n      turn11: at 3 -> then we can do S on turns 11,12,13 -> three stays? then at turn14 we are at 3.\n\nBut we can also move to 2 or 4? but 4 is blocked at turn14? and 2 is safe? but then we have to come back.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to 2 at turn12? \n\n      turn10: D to 3 at turn11 -> safe.\n      turn11: D to 2 at turn12 -> safe (freeway2: blocked at 16-19 -> safe) \n      Then we can stay at 2 until turn14? \n          turn12: at 2 -> safe.\n          turn12: S -> to 2 at turn13 -> safe.\n          turn13: S -> to 2 at turn14 -> safe.\n      Then at turn14: at 2 -> safe.\n      Then we go up: \n          turn14: U to 3 at turn15 -> freeway3: safe? (blocked at 16-19 -> safe) -> valid.\n          turn15: U to 4 at turn16 -> freeway4: blocked at 12,13,14,22,23,24 -> turn16 is safe? \n          turn16: U to 5 at turn17 -> freeway5: safe? \n          turn17: U to 6 at turn18 -> safe\n          turn18: U to 7 at turn19 -> safe\n          turn19: U to 8 at turn20 -> safe\n          turn20: U to 9 at turn21 -> done.\n\n      Total actions: 11? \n          turns: 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 -> 11 actions.\n\n      This is worse than the first option (which was 10).\n\nWe can avoid one stay by not going down to 2? \n\nIn the first option, we did:\n      turn10: D (to 3 at turn11)\n      turn11: S (to 3 at turn12)\n      turn12: S (to 3 at turn13)\n      turn13: S (to 3 at turn14)\n      turn14: U (to 4 at turn15)\n      ... until turn19: U to 9 at turn20: 10 actions.\n\nBut we did four actions at turn10,11,12,13: D,S,S,S -> that's 4 actions to get to turn14 at 3.\n\nThen we do 6 actions: U (14),U(15),U(16),U(17),U(18),U(19) -> 6 actions. Total 10.\n\nCan we get to 3 at turn14 with fewer than 4 actions? \n\nWe start at 4 at turn10. We have 4 turns (turns 10,11,12,13) to get to 3 at turn14? \n\nBut we are already at 4 at turn10. We want to be at 3 at turn14. \n\nWe can do:\n\n      turn10: S -> 4 at turn11 -> but then at turn11 we are at 4. \n      turn11: D -> 3 at turn12\n      turn12: S -> 3 at turn13\n      turn13: S -> 3 at turn14\n\n      Then we are at 3 at turn14. Total actions: S, D, S, S -> 4 actions for the first 4 turns? same as before.\n\n      Alternatively, \n          turn10: D -> 3 at turn11\n          turn11: S -> 3 at turn12\n          turn12: S -> 3 at turn13\n          turn13: S -> 3 at turn14: same.\n\n      We cannot skip one? because we have to wait until turn14.\n\nBut note: we could go down to 3 at turn10? but we are at turn10: we can only move to 3 at turn11.\n\nWe must be at 3 at turn14. The minimal number of moves to go from 4 to 3 is one down move. Then we have to stay for the remaining turns? \n\nBut we have 4 turns (turn10,11,12,13) to get from turn10 (state: (10,4)) to turn14 (state: (14,3)). \n\nWe can do:\n\n      turn10: D -> (11,3) \n      then we have to cover turns 12,13: we can do anything as long as we end at 3 at turn14? \n          turn11: S -> (12,3)\n          turn12: S -> (13,3)\n          turn13: S -> (14,3)\n\n      That's 4 actions.\n\n      Alternatively, we could go down to 2 and then come back? but that would take more moves.\n\n      Example:\n          turn10: D -> to 3 at turn11\n          turn11: D -> to 2 at turn12\n          turn12: U -> to 3 at turn13\n          turn13: S -> to 3 at turn14: \n          That's 4 actions and we end at 3 at turn14.\n\n      But we avoid the crash? \n          At turn12: we are at 2 -> safe.\n          At turn13: we are at 3 -> safe (freeway3: blocked at 16-19 -> safe at 13) -> valid.\n\n      Then at turn14: at 3 -> safe.\n\n      Then we go up: \n          turn14: U -> to 4 at turn15 -> safe.\n          then same as before: U at turn15,16,17,18,19 -> to 9 at turn20.\n\n      Total actions: 10.\n\n      Sequence:\n          turn10: D\n          turn11: D\n          turn12: U\n          turn13: S\n          turn14: U\n          turn15: U\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U\n\n      But wait: at turn11: we are at 3 -> then D to 2 at turn12: valid? \n          freeway2 at turn12: safe? (blocked at 16-19 -> safe) -> yes.\n      turn12: at 2 -> then U to 3 at turn13: \n          freeway3 at turn13: safe? (blocked at 16-19 -> safe) -> yes.\n      turn13: at 3 -> then S: to 3 at turn14: safe.\n\n      Then same as before.\n\n      This is 10 actions.\n\n      But we did an extra down and up? but same length.\n\nWe can try to be at 4 at turn15? without the long path? \n\nBut we have to avoid freeway4 at turn12,13,14. So we can only be at 4 at turn15 and beyond (until 21) safely? \n\nWe can try to get to 9 without going down? \n\nWe could go up to 9 in a different timing? \n\nWe note that freeway8 is only blocked at turn14? and freeway7,6,5,4 are blocked at turn14? but after turn14, freeway8 is safe? \n\nBut freeway4 is also blocked at 22,23,24? so we must avoid being at freeway4 at those turns.\n\nBut we are going to be at freeway4 at turn15? which is safe? then we go up quickly.\n\nIn the first option we are at freeway4 at turn15: safe.\n\nThen we go up: turn15:4->5, turn16:5->6, turn17:6->7, turn18:7->8, turn19:8->9.\n\nBut freeway8 at turn19: safe? yes.\n\nBut what about freeway4 at turn22? we are not there.\n\nSo the first option is safe.\n\nNow, can we do it in 9 actions? \n\nWe must get to 9 by turn19? meaning we are at 9 at turn19? \n\nBut to be at 9 at turn19, we must be at 8 at turn18? and then U at turn18.\n\nBut at turn14, we must be at a safe freeway (0,1,2,3,9). But we are at 3? and we want to get to 8 by turn18? \n\nFrom 3 at turn14, we need 5 moves to get to 8? \n      turn14: 3->4 (U)\n      turn15: 4->5\n      turn16: 5->6\n      turn17: 6->7\n      turn18: 7->8\n\nThen at turn18: at 8 -> then at turn18 we take U to go to 9 at turn19.\n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn19 -> so we need to take 9 actions? from turn10 to turn18? \n\nBut wait, we have to cover the waiting period? \n\nWe start at turn10: at 4.\n\nWe do:\n\n      turn10: D to 3 (at turn11)\n      turn11: S to 3 (at turn12)\n      turn12: S to 3 (at turn13)\n      turn13: S to 3 (at turn14)  -> so far 4 actions.\n\n      Then:\n          turn14: U to 4 (at turn15)\n          turn15: U to 5 (at turn16)\n          turn16: U to 6 (at turn17)\n          turn17: U to 7 (at turn18)\n          turn18: U to 8 (at turn19) -> then we are at 8 at turn19? but we need to be at 9.\n\n          Then we need turn19: U to 9 (at turn20) -> that's the 10th action.\n\n      So we are at 9 at turn20.\n\nBut if we want to be at 9 at turn19, we must be at 8 at turn18? \n\n      Then we would do:\n          turn18: U -> to 9 at turn19.\n\n      But then we are at 9 at turn19.\n\n      How to be at 8 at turn18? \n          We must be at 7 at turn17? \n          at 6 at turn16? \n          at 5 at turn15? \n          at 4 at turn14? \n\n      But we are at 3 at turn14? \n\n      Then from turn14 to turn18: 4 turns -> we can move 4 steps? \n          turn14: 3->4\n          turn15: 4->5\n          turn16: 5->6\n          turn17: 6->7\n          turn18: 7->8 -> so we are at 8 at turn18? then we need an action at turn18: U to 9 at turn19.\n\n      So total actions: \n          turn10: D\n          turn11: S\n          turn12: S\n          turn13: S\n          turn14: U  -> to 4 at turn15\n          turn15: U  -> to 5 at turn16\n          turn16: U  -> to 6 at turn17\n          turn17: U  -> to 7 at turn18\n          turn18: U  -> to 8 at turn19? \n\n      But wait: \n          At turn14: we are at 3 -> then we take U -> then at turn15 we are at 4.\n          turn15: at 4 -> safe? freeway4 at turn15: we computed: freeway4 is blocked at 12,13,14 -> not 15? and next block at 22 -> so safe.\n          turn16: at 5 -> freeway5: blocked at 10,14 -> safe at 16? safe.\n          turn17: at 6 -> safe.\n          turn18: at 7 -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn18: we are at 7 -> and we take U to 8 at turn19? \n          But we want to be at 9 at turn19? \n          We need to take U again at turn19 to get to 9 at turn20.\n\n      So we are at 8 at turn19? then we take U at turn19 to get to 9 at turn20.\n\n      Therefore, we need 10 actions.\n\n      Alternatively, we can try to move faster? \n\n      We start at 4 at turn10. We want to be at 3 at turn14? but we can be at 3 at an earlier turn? but we have to avoid being at freeway4 at turn12,13,14? and freeway5,6,7,8 at turn14.\n\n      But we can be at 3 at turn12? then we can start going up earlier? \n\n      How to be at 3 at turn12? \n          turn10: D to 3 at turn11\n          turn11: S to 3 at turn12 -> so at turn12: at 3 -> safe.\n\n      Then we have two more turns to wait? \n          turn12: we can do S to 3 at turn13\n          turn13: S to 3 at turn14\n\n      Then same as before.\n\n      But then we can go up at turn14: to 4 at turn15 -> same.\n\n      So we are still at 4 at turn15.\n\n      We cannot go up earlier? because we must avoid freeway4 at turn12,13,14? so we cannot be at 4 at those turns.\n\n      We can be at 4 at turn11? \n          turn10: S to 4 at turn11 -> safe? (freeway4 at turn11: safe) -> valid.\n          turn11: D to 3 at turn12 -> safe? (freeway3 at turn12: safe) -> valid.\n          Then we are at 3 at turn12 -> then we wait: \n                turn12: S to 3 at turn13\n                turn13: S to 3 at turn14\n          Then same.\n\n      This is still 10 actions.\n\n      But note: at turn11 we did a down move? then we are at 3 at turn12. Then we have two stays? then at turn14 we go up.\n\n      Then the sequence:\n          turn10: S\n          turn11: D\n          turn12: S\n          turn13: S\n          turn14: U\n          turn15: U\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U\n\n      That's 10 actions.\n\n      But we are at 9 at turn20.\n\nWe must have 5 up moves after turn14? and we start at 3 at turn14? then we need 5 moves to get to 8 at turn19? and then a sixth to get to 9 at turn20? \n\nBut we need to be at 9 at the end of the sequence. The minimal moves from 3 to 9 is 6? \n\nWe start at 3 at turn14? \n      turn14: U to 4 at turn15\n      turn15: U to 5 at turn16\n      turn16: U to 6 at turn17\n      turn17: U to 7 at turn18\n      turn18: U to 8 at turn19\n      turn19: U to 9 at turn20\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nPlus the moves to get to 3 at turn14: we started at 4 at turn10. \n\nWe need to get from 4 at turn10 to 3 at turn14: we can do it in 4 moves? \n      turn10: D (to 3 at turn11) -> then we are at 3 at turn11. Then we have to wait until turn14? so we do 3 stays: \n          turn11: S -> 3 at turn12\n          turn12: S -> 3 at turn13\n          turn13: S -> 3 at turn14\n\n      So 4 moves.\n\nTotal moves: 4+6 = 10.\n\nBut can we do it in 9 moves? \n\nWe would need to save one move. \n\nHow? \n\nWe can try to be at 4 at turn15 without waiting until turn14? \n\nBut we are at 4 at turn10. We cannot be at 4 at turn11? because we can do S and be at 4 at turn11? but then we have to leave because at turn12,13,14 freeway4 is blocked. \n\nWe can go up to 5 at turn11? but then we have to avoid being at 5,6,7,8 at turn14? so we must go down to 3 by turn14? which takes at least 3 moves from 5: \n      turn11: at 5 -> then we need to go down to 3 by turn14? \n          turn11: D to 4 at turn12 -> but freeway4 at turn12: blocked -> crash.\n\n      So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to 3 at turn11? then we are at 3 at turn11. Then we can go up to 4 at turn12? but freeway4 at turn12: blocked -> crash.\n\nWe cannot be at 4 at turn12.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be at 3 at turn14 and then go up.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nWe have two sequences that work:\n\nOption A:\n  10: D\n  11: S\n  12: S\n  13: S\n  14: U\n  15: U\n  16: U\n  17: U\n  18: U\n  19: U\n\nOption B:\n  10: D\n  11: D\n  12: U\n  13: S\n  14: U\n  15: U\n  16: U\n  17: U\n  18: U\n  19: U\n\nBut note in option B: \n  At turn12: we are at 2 -> then we go up to 3 at turn13 -> then we stay at turn13? \n  Then at turn14: we are at 3 -> safe.\n\nBoth are 10 moves.\n\nWe can also have:\n\n  10: S\n  11: D\n  12: S\n  13: S\n  14: U\n  15: U\n  16: U\n  17: U\n  18: U\n  19: U\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn10: we do S -> stay at 4 at turn11? \n  Then at turn11: we do D -> to 3 at turn12? \n  Then we do S at turn12 and turn13: so at turn14: at 3.\n\nThis is also 10 moves.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal number of turns H and a sequence. Any sequence of 10 moves is minimal? \n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9? We saw it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, we output a sequence of 10 actions.\n\nWe choose one. Let's choose option A.\n\nBut we must verify:\n\n  Turn10: at (0,4) -> take D: then at turn11: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn11: safe? (blocked at 16-19 -> safe) -> valid.\n  Turn11: at (0,3) -> take S: at turn12: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn12: safe -> valid.\n  Turn12: at (0,3) -> take S: at turn13: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn13: safe -> valid.\n  Turn13: at (0,3) -> take S: at turn14: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn14: safe -> valid.\n  Turn14: at (0,3) -> take U: at turn15: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn15: safe? \n        freeway4: blocked at 12,13,14,22,23,24 -> turn15 is safe? yes -> valid.\n  Turn15: at (0,4) -> take U: at turn16: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn16: safe? (only blocked at 10,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n  Turn16: at (0,5) -> take U: at turn17: y=6 -> freeway6: safe -> valid.\n  Turn17: at (0,6) -> take U: at turn18: y=7 -> freeway7: safe -> valid.\n  Turn18: at (0,7) -> take U: at turn19: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn19: safe? (blocked at 10,14 -> safe) -> valid.\n  Turn19: at (0,8) -> take U: at turn20: y=9 -> reached.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn t_1: D\nTurn t_1 + 1: S\nTurn t_1 + 2: S\nTurn t_1 + 3: S\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\nTurn t_1 + 7: U\nTurn t_1 + 8: U\nTurn t_1 + 9: U\n\nBut note: t1 = 10, so the turns are 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nIn the answer format, we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t = t1 to t1+H-1, and H=10, so from t=10 to t=19.\n\nWe have 10 actions.\n\nWe output the actions for turn 10, then 11, ... up to turn 19.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nWe can choose any of the sequences, but this one is straightforward.\n\nWe output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to freeway 3 at turn 11 and staying there until turn 14 to avoid the hazardous conditions on freeways 4-8 at turn 14. After turn 14, the player moves upward consistently to reach freeway 9 by turn 20.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 10, move down (D) to position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at a turn \\(T\\) where any car on that freeway covers the x-position 0, as verified by the car movement rules and blocked turn intervals.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 11. I need to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis is from y=0 to y=9, so freeways are from y=1 to y=8, meaning that's where the cars are.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway k (which corresponds to y=k, I think), and they move horizontally. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the y you're currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nLet me read that note carefully: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T. You choose an action: U, D, or S. Then y_{T+1} is set based on that. But during turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purposes. Collision is checked based on the car positions at turn T for the freeway you're on at turn T.\n\nThen, after the action, you move to y_{T+1}, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked then for that position.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd Span(T) is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, since cars move continuously, but we're given discrete turns, so at each integer turn, we check.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t_1 = 11. So I need to compute their positions at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, where t=0 is turn t_1=11. So from now on, I'll use t as the offset from t_1.\n\nSo at t=0: player at y=3.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 in minimal H, meaning after H actions, so from t=0 to t=H-1, actions, position at t=H should be y=9.\n\nActions are taken at each turn from t=0 to t=H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=H, position is y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=0, and after action a_t at turn t, position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nBut to simplify, I'll use t from 0 upwards.\n\nSo at time t (turn offset), position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with delta y based on a_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if for freeway k = y_t, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nSpan at time t is computed based on initial span at t=0 and speed.\n\nGiven initial state at t=0 (which is t_1=11).\n\nCars:\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\nk=1: one car: head h=-15, tail tau=-26, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nSince direction right, and span given as (head, tail) but in the update, for right-moving, span is [tau, h]? Let me check.\n\nThe car update says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, tau] -> at T, [h - s(T-t_1), tau - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [tau, h] -> at T, [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for k=1: (-15, -26, right, 3)\n\nBut it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head and tail: since it's moving right, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head is greater than tail? In this case, h=-15, tau=-26, so h > tau since -15 > -26, so head is at -15, tail at -26, so the car is from left to right, with head at -15, tail at -26, so span is from -26 to -15, I think.\n\nBut in the right-moving update, it says Span(t_1) = [tau, h], so [ -26, -15 ].\n\nThen at time T, [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [ -26 + 3(T-t_1), -15 + 3(T-t_1) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the freeway 4, it has three cars, so multiple cars per freeway.\n\nNow, collision if at turn t, for freeway y_t, there is a car such that 0 is in [min(span), max(span)] at that turn.\n\nSince span is an interval, 0 in [left, right] means left <= 0 <= right.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars are at x=0.\n\nBut since cars move at constant speed, I can find for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nThen, for each freeway, I have a set of times when there is a car at x=0.\n\nThen, at turn t, if the player is on freeway k, and at that time t, there is a car on k with 0 in span, then collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nAlso, y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up at least 6 times, but I can move down or stay, so H >= 6.\n\nBut I might need to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nNow, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nSet t=0 as current turn, so T - t_1 = t, where t is offset.\n\nFor each freeway k, find the times t when there is a car at x=0.\n\nSince t is integer, we care about integer t.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: one car, right-moving, s=3, initial span at t=0: [tau, h] = [-26, -15]\n\nAt time t, span: [ -26 + 3t, -15 + 3t ]\n\n0 in span if -26 + 3t <= 0 <= -15 + 3t\n\nWhich is -26 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -15 + 3t\n\nSo 3t <= 26 => t <= 26/3 = 8.666, so t <= 8\n\nAnd 0 <= -15 + 3t => 3t >= 15 => t >= 5\n\nSo for t from 5 to 8 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nt=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, k=2: same as k=1, (-15,-26,right,3), so same as above, t=5,6,7,8 car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly k=3: same, t=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow k=4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nDirection right, so initial span [tau, h] = [-15, -4]? Head and tail: given as (head, tail) = (-4,-15), but for right-moving, head is greater, -4 > -15, so span [tau, h] = [-15, -4]\n\nAt time t: [ -15 + 4t, -4 + 4t ]\n\n0 in span if -15 + 4t <= 0 <= -4 + 4t\n\nSo -15 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 15 => t <= 15/4 = 3.75, t <= 3\n\n0 <= -4 + 4t => 4t >= 4 => t >= 1\n\nSo t from 1 to 3 inclusive.\n\nt=1,2,3.\n\nSecond car on k=4: (32,21,right,4)\n\nHead=32, tail=21? 32>21, so for right-moving, span [tau,h] = [21,32]\n\nAt time t: [21 + 4t, 32 + 4t]\n\n0 in span? 21 + 4t <= 0 <= 32 + 4t?\n\nBut 21 + 4t >=21 >0 for t>=0, so left end >0, so 0 never in span. Always positive, moving right, so never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-44,-55,right,4)\n\nHead=-44, tail=-55, -44 > -55, so span [tau,h] = [-55,-44]\n\nAt time t: [-55 + 4t, -44 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -55 + 4t <= 0 <= -44 + 4t\n\n-55 + 4t <=0 => 4t <=55 => t<=13.75, t<=13\n\n0 <= -44 + 4t => 4t >=44 => t>=11\n\nSo t from 11 to 13 inclusive.\n\nBut we start from t=0, and we might not go that far, but possible.\n\nSo for k=4, cars at x=0:\n\nFirst car: t=1,2,3\n\nSecond car: never\n\nThird car: t=11,12,13\n\nSo overall for k=4, unsafe at t=1,2,3 and t=11,12,13.\n\nNow k=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nHead=-36, tail=-47, -36 > -47, span [tau,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt time t: [-47 + 12t, -36 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12t <=0 <= -36 + 12t\n\n-47 +12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, t<=3\n\n0 <= -36 +12t => 12t >=36 => t>=3\n\nSo t=3 only? t>=3 and t<=3.916, so t=3.\n\nt=3: -47+36= -11 <=0? -47+12*3= -47+36= -11 <=0, yes; 0 <= -36 +36=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nt=4: -47+48=1 >0, so left end=1>0, 0 not <=1? 0 <=1 is true, but -47+48=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so not satisfied.\n\n0 in [left,right] if left <=0 <= right.\n\nAt t=3: left=-47+36=-11 <=0, right=-36+36=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nAt t=4: left=-47+48=1, right=-36+48=12, so 1<=0? False, 0 not >= left, so no.\n\nSo only t=3.\n\nSecond car on k=5: (12,1,right,12)\n\nHead=12, tail=1, span [tau,h]=[1,12]\n\nAt time t: [1+12t, 12+12t]\n\nLeft end 1+12t >=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus for k=5, unsafe only at t=3.\n\nk=6: same as k=5? k=6 has (-36,-47,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), same as k=5.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=3.\n\nSimilarly k=7: same cars, unsafe at t=3.\n\nk=8: same, unsafe at t=3.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, times when car at x=0:\n\nk=1: unsafe at t=5,6,7,8\n\nk=2: same, t=5,6,7,8\n\nk=3: same, t=5,6,7,8\n\nk=4: unsafe at t=1,2,3 and t=11,12,13\n\nk=5: unsafe at t=3\n\nk=6: unsafe at t=3\n\nk=7: unsafe at t=3\n\nk=8: unsafe at t=3\n\nAlso, for k=4, at t=11,12,13 unsafe, but since we start from t=0, and H might be small, but we need to reach y=9, so let's see.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at t=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, H=6, all U.\n\nBut with cars, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it's unsafe.\n\nAt turn t, if on freeway k=y_t, and t is unsafe for k, then collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nAlso, when moving, if we move to a different y, at turn t we are still on y_t for collision check.\n\nFor example, at t=0, position y=3, which is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think no cars there, so always safe.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\" and collision only if on freeway and car at x=0.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe positions.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3), which is on freeway 3? Position is (x,y), but x is always 0? The player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, and y vertical.\n\nFreeways are horizontal at each y=k for k=1 to 8.\n\nAt position (0,y), if y between 1 and 8, it's on freeway y.\n\nIf y=0 or y=9, not on any freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at t=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=0, is it unsafe? For k=3, unsafe at t=5,6,7,8, so at t=0, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to move to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, list the unsafe times for each y.\n\nSince freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nSo:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=5,6,7,8\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=5,6,7,8\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=5,6,7,8\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=1,2,3 and t=11,12,13\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3, t=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, which is safe since unsafe only at t=5-8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut we need to specify when we reach, but the position after H actions, at turn t=H, y_H=9.\n\nAnd during the path, no collision.\n\nNow, to minimize H.\n\nMinimal is 6, if we go up directly: actions U,U,U,U,U,U? From y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so 6 Ups.\n\nBut need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt t=0: y=3, action a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + delta y.\n\nAfter action at t, position for collision at t is before the move? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t:\n\n- We are at position y_t.\n\n- Collision check: if on freeway (1<=y_t<=8), and if at that time t, there is car at x=0 on that freeway, then collision.\n\n- Then, we choose action a_t, which determines delta y.\n\n- Then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nSo the collision is based on current position y_t and time t.\n\nThen we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor the sequence, we need y_H = 9 for some H, with y_t for t=0 to H-1 not causing collision.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H-1, since at turn t, position y_t, and we take action to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn H, we have y_H, which should be 9, and no action taken at turn H, I think.\n\nIn the process, we take actions from t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=H, we are at y_H=9.\n\nAt turn t=H, since we are at y_H=9, which is not a freeway, no collision, so it's fine. We don't check collision at turn H if y_H=9.\n\nCollision only when on freeway.\n\nSo we need to ensure for t=0 to H-1, if y_t between 1 and 8, it is safe at time t.\n\nNow, back to minimal path.\n\nStart t=0, y=3.\n\nIf we go all up: actions U each time.\n\nThen:\n\nt=0: y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe at t=5,6,7,8; t=0 safe, so no collision.\n\nAfter U, y=4 at t=1? After action, y_{t+1}.\n\nt=0: position y=3, safe. Action a_0=U, then y_1=4.\n\nt=1: position y=4, now check collision at t=1.\n\ny=4, freeway 4, unsafe at t=1,2,3.\n\nt=1 is unsafe for y=4, so collision! Cannot be on y=4 at t=1.\n\nIf we go up at first step, we collide at t=1.\n\nWe could stay or go down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nGo down to y=2 or something.\n\nBut let's list possible actions.\n\nSince y=4 is unsafe at t=1,2,3, we should avoid being on y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe at t=3 only.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at t=5-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe always.\n\nWe start at y=3, t=0, safe.\n\nNow, at t=0, we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U, we go to y=4 at t=1, but t=1 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we choose D, go to y=2 at t=1.\n\ny=2 at t=1: y=2 unsafe only at t=5-8, t=1 safe, so possible.\n\nIf choose S, stay at y=3 at t=1.\n\ny=3 at t=1: unsafe at t=5-8, t=1 safe.\n\nBut we need to go up, so staying might not help.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous at early times, we might want to delay going up or go down first.\n\nBut going down might take us away.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6,7,8 are only unsafe at t=3, and y=4 unsafe at t=1,2,3, so at t=3, all y=4 to 8 are unsafe except y=3 and below or y=9, but y=3 unsafe at t=3? y=3 unsafe at t=5-8, not at t=3.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=5,6,7,8, so at t=3, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 safe at t=3, etc.\n\nBut at t=3, y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe.\n\ny=4 unsafe t=1,2,3; y=5 unsafe t=3; similarly y=6,7,8 unsafe t=3.\n\nSo at t=3, if on y=4,5,6,7,8, collision.\n\nOnly safe at t=3 if on y=0,1,2,3 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, hard to be there early.\n\nNow, we need to be careful around t=3.\n\nAlso, later t=5-8, y=1,2,3 unsafe.\n\nBut since we are going to y=9, we might not be on low y later.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach y=9 before t=5 or after t=8 to avoid the low y unsafe times.\n\nt=5 to 8 is later.\n\nMinimal H=6, but we might need more.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 up moves.\n\nEach turn we can move or stay.\n\nH is number of actions, so time from t=0 to t=H.\n\nAt t=H, y_H=9.\n\nThe path has positions y_t for t=0 to H.\n\nFor t=0 to H-1, if y_t in 1-8, must be safe at t.\n\nAt t=H, y_H=9, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: safe except t=5,6,7,8\n\ny=2: safe except t=5,6,7,8\n\ny=3: safe except t=5,6,7,8\n\ny=4: safe except t=1,2,3,11,12,13 (but t=11+ might be late, we can ignore if H small)\n\ny=5: safe except t=3\n\ny=6: safe except t=3\n\ny=7: safe except t=3\n\ny=8: safe except t=3\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical point is t=3, where y=4 to 8 are unsafe, so we must be on y<=3 or y=9 at t=3.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable by t=3 from y=3 in 3 steps? t=0 to t=3, 3 actions, from y=3, max y=6 with 3U, not 9.\n\nMin y=0 with 3D.\n\nSo at t=3, we can be at y=0,1,2,3.\n\ny=4 to 8 impossible at t=3.\n\ny=9 impossible.\n\nSo at t=3, we must be on y=0,1,2,3, all of which are safe at t=3, since y=1,2,3 unsafe only at t=5-8, not t=3; y=0 safe.\n\nSo as long as we are on y<=3 at t=3, we avoid the t=3 collision for higher y.\n\nNow, for y=4, it is also unsafe at t=1 and t=2.\n\nAt t=1, if we are on y=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly t=2, y=4 unsafe.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=3.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at t=1, we collide because t=1 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go up immediately.\n\nWe must avoid being on y=4 at t=1 and t=2.\n\nAlso, at t=3, we must not be on y=4, but since we must be on y<=3, it's covered.\n\nNow, options at t=0:\n\n- Action D: go to y=2 at t=1\n\n- Action S: stay at y=3 at t=1\n\n- Action U: go to y=4 at t=1, but collision, invalid.\n\nSo only D or S at t=0.\n\nCase 1: a_0 = D, then y_1 = 2\n\nAt t=1, position y=2, which is safe (unsafe only t=5-8), so no collision.\n\nThen at t=1, we choose action.\n\nPossible: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, go to y=3 at t=2.\n\ny=3 at t=2: safe? y=3 unsafe t=5-8, t=2 safe.\n\nIf D, go to y=1 at t=2.\n\ny=1 at t=2: safe.\n\nIf S, stay y=2 at t=2.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, at t=2, we need to avoid y=4 if possible, but y=4 unsafe at t=2.\n\nAlso, at t=2, if we are on y=4, unsafe.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=1, if we go U, to y=3 at t=2.\n\nNot y=4.\n\nIf we go D, to y=1, etc.\n\nBut let's see how to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nAnother constraint: later, at t=5-8, y=1,2,3 unsafe, so we want to be above y=3 by t=5.\n\nt=5 to 8, if on y=1,2,3, collision.\n\nSo we need to be at y>=4 by t=5.\n\nAt t=5, position y_5 must be >=4 to be safe, since y<=3 unsafe.\n\ny=4 to 8 might have other unsafe times, but at t=5, y=4 is safe? y=4 unsafe only at t=1,2,3,11,12,13; t=5 is safe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7,8 safe at t=5.\n\nOnly y=1,2,3 unsafe at t=5.\n\nSimilarly for t=6,7,8.\n\nSo by t=5, we need y_t >=4.\n\nNow, back to the start.\n\nWe have to be at y<=3 at t=3.\n\nAnd at t=5, y>=4.\n\nNow, from t=3 to t=5, two turns.\n\nAt t=3, y_3 <=3.\n\nAfter actions at t=3 and t=4, we go to y_4 and y_5.\n\ny_5 must be >=4.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, from y_3 <=3 to y_5 >=4, it is possible.\n\nFor example, if y_3=3, then with two ups, y_5=5.\n\nOr with up and stay, y_5=4, etc.\n\nBut need to avoid other issues.\n\nFirst, let's handle the early part.\n\nAt t=0: y=3, cannot go U, so must go D or S.\n\nConsider going S first.\n\na_0 = S, then y_1 =3 (stay)\n\nAt t=1: position y=3, safe (t=1, not 5-8). Action?\n\nCan go U, D, S.\n\nIf go U, to y=4 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=4 is unsafe (t=2 is unsafe for y=4), so if on y=4 at t=2, collision.\n\nSo cannot go U at t=1 if y=3, because it goes to y=4 at t=2.\n\nAt t=1, position y=3, action a_1.\n\nIf a_1=U, then y_2=4, and at turn t=2, position y=4, which is unsafe at t=2, collision.\n\nSo cannot do U at t=1.\n\nIf a_1=D, then y_2=2, position at t=2 is y=2, which is safe.\n\nIf a_1=S, then y_2=3, position at t=2 y=3, safe.\n\nNow, similarly, at t=2, we need to choose action.\n\nBut we also need to be at y<=3 at t=3.\n\nt=3 is the time we must be <=3.\n\nAt t=2, position y_t, then action to set y_{t+1}, which is position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t=2, we are at y_2, then after action, y_3.\n\ny_3 must be <=3.\n\nSimilarly, y_2 can be various.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not delay too much.\n\nStart from t=0.\n\nOption: a_0 = S, then y_1=3.\n\nt=1: y=3, cannot go U (because would go to y=4 at t=2, unsafe), so must go D or S.\n\nIf a_1 = S, then y_2=3.\n\nThen at t=2, position y=3, now action a_2.\n\ny_3 must be <=3.\n\nIf a_2 = S, y_3=3 <=3, good.\n\nIf a_2 = D, y_3=2 <=3, good.\n\nIf a_2 = U, y_3=4, but y_3=4 at t=3, unsafe, collision. Cannot.\n\nSo at t=2, cannot go U, must go S or D to keep y_3 <=3.\n\nThen y_3 <=3, safe at t=3.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut we also need y_5 >=4.\n\nt=3: position y_3 <=3, say y.\n\nThen action a_3, to y_4.\n\nThen t=4: position y_4, action a_4 to y_5.\n\ny_5 must >=4.\n\nSince y_3 <=3, to have y_5 >=4, we need at least one up move in the two actions, and y_4 must be such that we can reach y_5>=4.\n\nFor example, if y_3=3, then y_4 could be 2,3,4.\n\nIf y_4=4, then y_5 could be 3,4,5.\n\ny_5 must >=4, so if y_4=4, then a_4=S or U, y_5=4 or 5, both >=4.\n\nIf y_4=3, then to have y_5>=4, must go U, y_5=4.\n\nIf y_4=2, then y_5 could be 1,2,3 or with U, 3, but y_5=3<4, not >=4, or if U, y_5=3<4, or D to 1, worse, S to 2, all less than 4. From y_4=2, max y_5=3 with U, which is less than 4, so y_5<=3<4, cannot achieve y_5>=4 if y_4=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=1, y_5<=2<4.\n\nIf y_4=0, y_5<=1<4.\n\nSo to have y_5>=4, we need y_4 >=3, because from y_4=3, with U, y_5=4; or from y_4=4, y_5=4 or 5.\n\ny_4=3 or 4.\n\nBut y_4 is at t=4 position.\n\ny_4 must be 3 or 4 to have y_5>=4.\n\nNow, y_4 comes from y_3 and a_3.\n\ny_3 <=3.\n\nIf y_3=3, then with a_3=U, y_4=4; a_3=S, y_4=3; a_3=D, y_4=2.\n\nBut if y_4=2, then y_5 cannot be >=4, as above.\n\nSo for y_4 to be 3 or 4, we need:\n\nIf y_3=3, then a_3 must be U or S, not D, so y_4=4 or 3.\n\nIf y_3=2, then a_3=U, y_4=3; a_3=S, y_4=2; a_3=D, y_4=1.\n\nThen y_4=3 is possible with U.\n\ny_4=2 or 1, not good for y_5.\n\nSo only if a_3=U, y_4=3.\n\nThen from y_4=3, we can go to y_5=4 with U.\n\nIf y_3=1, a_3=U, y_4=2, then y_4=2, cannot reach y_5>=4.\n\na_3=S, y_4=1, worse.\n\na_3=D, y_4=0, then y_5<=1<4.\n\nSo only possible if y_3=1 and a_3=U, but y_4=2, which is less than 3, and from there y_5<=3<4, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if y_3=0, even worse.\n\nTherefore, to have y_5>=4, we need y_3 >=2, and specifically:\n\n- If y_3=3, then a_3 must not be D, so y_4=3 or 4.\n\nThen if y_4=3, a_4 must be U to y_5=4.\n\nIf y_4=4, a_4 can be S or U to y_5=4 or 5.\n\n- If y_3=2, then a_3 must be U to y_4=3, then a_4 must be U to y_5=4.\n\n- If y_3=1, cannot, because y_4 <=2, y_5<=3<4.\n\n- Similarly y_3=0 impossible.\n\nSo y_3 must be at least 2, and if y_3=2, must have two ups at t=3 and t=4 to reach y_5=4.\n\nIf y_3=3, more flexible.\n\nNow back to earlier.\n\nWe also have the issue at t=1 and t=2 with y=4.\n\nBut we are not on y=4 at those times if we avoid.\n\nIn the path, we need to reach y=9 from there.\n\nBut first, let's get to t=3 safely.\n\nStart t=0: y=3\n\nCannot go U, so a_0 = S or D.\n\nIf a_0 = S, y_1=3\n\nt=1: y=3, cannot go U (to avoid y=4 at t=2), so a_1 = S or D.\n\nIf a_1 = S, y_2=3\n\nThen t=2: y=3, now y_3 must <=3, and cannot go U (because y_3=4 unsafe at t=3), so a_2 = S or D.\n\nIf a_2 = S, y_3=3\n\nIf a_2 = D, y_3=2\n\nNow, y_3=3 or 2.\n\nBoth >=2, so possible for later.\n\nIf at t=1, we choose D: a_1=D, y_2=2\n\nThen t=2: y=2, now action, y_3 must <=3.\n\nCan go U to y_3=3, S to y_3=2, D to y_3=1.\n\nAll <=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_0 = D, y_1=2\n\nt=1: y=2, safe.\n\nThen can go U to y_2=3, or S to y_2=2, or D to y_2=1.\n\nThen at t=2, similar.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not go down too much, but we need to reach y=9, so staying high is better.\n\nAlso, for y_3, higher is better for later.\n\nFor example, y_3=3 is better than 2.\n\nNow, we need to go from y_3 to y_9, but with the t=5-8 constraint.\n\ny_5 must >=4.\n\nFrom y_3 <=3, we can reach y_5>=4 as above.\n\nThen from there, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe low y unsafe at t=5-8, but since we are at y>=4 by t=5, we can stay above.\n\ny=4,5,6,7,8 have no unsafe times except y=4 at late t, but t=11+ we can ignore if H small.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, from y_5>=4, we can go up to y=9.\n\nNumber of steps: from y_5 to y=9, need at least 5 ups if y_5=4, or less if higher.\n\nBut y_5 could be 4 or 5, etc.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, let's find a path with small H.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nStart from y=3 at t=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H=9.\n\ny_H = y_0 + sum of delta y from t=0 to H-1.\n\ny_0=3, y_H=9, so sum of delta y = 6, meaning net +6, with each +1,0,-1.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D must be 6, and H = number of actions.\n\nMinimal H when no S or D, all U, H=6.\n\nBut not possible because of early collision.\n\nSo H>6.\n\nWe need extra moves, like staying or going down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nBut going down increases H more.\n\nStaying might be better.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nSince we must be at y<=3 at t=3, and we start at y=3, if we stay or go down, we can be at y<=3 at t=3.\n\nFor example, a_0 = S, a_1 = S, a_2 = S, then y_3=3.\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nThen from t=3, y_3=3, we need to go up.\n\nBut at t=3, position y_3=3, safe.\n\nAction a_3.\n\nWe need y_4 and y_5.\n\nTo have y_5>=4, with y_3=3, we can:\n\na_3 = U, then y_4=4\n\nThen at t=4, position y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=4: is it safe? y=4 unsafe at t=1,2,3,11,... t=4 safe, so ok.\n\nThen action a_4, to set y_5.\n\ny_5 must >=4.\n\nIf a_4 = S, y_5=4\n\nIf a_4 = U, y_5=5\n\nIf a_4 = D, y_5=3, but 3<4, not allowed, since y_5=3 at t=5 unsafe.\n\nt=5, if y_5=3, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo at t=4, if y_4=4, we cannot go D, must go S or U to have y_5>=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we do a_3 = S at t=3, y_4=3\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, now we must have y_5>=4, so must go U, y_5=4.\n\nBut y_5=4 at t=5: safe, as above.\n\nNow, let's choose a path.\n\nFirst, to save time, let's go up as soon as possible after t=3.\n\nSo one possible path:\n\nt=0: y=3, a_0 = S (stay, to avoid going to y=4 early)\n\ny_1=3\n\nt=1: y=3, a_1 = S (stay, avoid moving to y=4)\n\ny_2=3\n\nt=2: y=3, now a_2 must be S or D to keep y_3<=3. Set a_2 = S, y_3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, now go up, a_3 = U, y_4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, now to have y_5>=4, go up or stay. Go up to save time, a_4 = U, y_5=5\n\nNow y_5=5 at t=5: y=5 unsafe only at t=3, not t=5, so safe.\n\nNow from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5 at t=5, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=5, y=5 safe.\n\nAction a_5.\n\nIf U, y_6=6\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut check for collisions.\n\ny=6 at t=6: unsafe? y=6 unsafe only at t=3, t=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7,8.\n\nBut y=8 at some time might be issue, but only unsafe at t=3, which is past.\n\nNow, from y_5=5, to y=9, need 4 more ups.\n\nActions:\n\nt=5: y=5, a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nt=6: y=6, a_6=U, y_7=7\n\nt=7: y=7, a_7=U, y_8=8\n\nt=8: y=8, a_8=U, y_9=9\n\nNow, check if at any point collision.\n\nt=0: y=3, safe\n\nt=1: y=3, safe\n\nt=2: y=3, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, safe (t=4 not unsafe)\n\nt=5: y=5, safe (t=5 not unsafe for y=5)\n\nt=6: y=6, safe\n\nt=7: y=7, safe\n\nt=8: y=8, safe? y=8 unsafe only at t=3, t=8 safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nIn this path, we reached at t=9, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nt=0 to t=8 actions, 9 actions? t is offset.\n\nStart t=0, actions at t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, that's 9 actions, y_9=9.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9, with 6 net up, but we had 3 stays at the beginning and 5 ups? Let's count.\n\nActions: t=0: S, t=1: S, t=2: S, t=3: U, t=4: U, t=5: U, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U\n\nSo actions: S,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\ny: start 3, after S:3, after S:3, after S:3, after U:4, after U:5, after U:6, after U:7, after U:8, after U:9.\n\nAt turn t=8, position y=8, action U to y=9.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, is it safe? y=8 unsafe at t=3 only, t=8 safe, yes.\n\nThen at t=9, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? We have 3 stays, which cost extra.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, instead of staying, go down, but that might be worse.\n\na_0 = D, then y_1=2\n\nt=1: y=2, safe. Then a_1 could be U, to y_2=3\n\nThen t=2: y=3, now a_2 must be S or D to keep y_3<=3. Say a_2=S, y_3=3\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr a_2=D, y_3=2\n\nThen at t=3, y=2, now a_3 must be U to go to y_4=3 (since y_3=2, to have y_4=3 or more)\n\na_3=U, y_4=3\n\nThen at t=4, y=3, now we need y_5>=4, so must go U, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\ny_5=4 at t=5: safe.\n\nThen from here, go up: a_5=U, y_6=5; a_6=U, y_7=6; a_7=U, y_8=7; a_8=U, y_9=8; a_9=U, y_10=9? y_9=8, need another U.\n\ny_5=4, to y=9, need 5 ups.\n\nActions: from t=5: U to y=5, t=6: U to y=6, t=7: U to y=7, t=8: U to y=8, t=9: U to y=9.\n\nSo positions: t=0:3, a0=D to y1=2\n\nt=1:2, a1=U to y2=3? At t=1, position y=2, action a1=U, then y2=3\n\nt=2: position y=3, action a2=S, y3=3? Earlier I said a2=S or D, to y3.\n\nIn this case, a2=S, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, a3=U to y4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, a4=U to y5=5\n\ny5=5 at t=5.\n\nThen t=5: y=5, a5=U to y6=6\n\nt=6: y=6, a6=U to y7=7\n\nt=7: y=7, a7=U to y8=8\n\nt=8: y=8, a8=U to y9=9\n\nNow, H=8 actions? Actions at t=0 to t=7? t=0 to t=8? List:\n\nActions: a0 (t=0), a1 (t=1), a2 (t=2), a3 (t=3), a4 (t=4), a5 (t=5), a6 (t=6), a7 (t=7), a8 (t=8) for y9.\n\nIn sequence: actions at t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8: 9 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 8 inclusive is 9 actions.\n\ny at t=0:3, after a0: y1=2 (D), t=1 position\n\nAfter a1: y2=3 (U), t=2 position\n\nAfter a2: y3=3 (S), t=3 position\n\nAfter a3: y4=4 (U), t=4 position\n\nAfter a4: y5=5 (U), t=5 position\n\nAfter a5: y6=6 (U), t=6 position\n\nAfter a6: y7=7 (U), t=7 position\n\nAfter a7: y8=8 (U), t=8 position\n\nAfter a8: y9=9 (U), t=9 position.\n\nSo 9 actions to reach at t=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut in this case, we have a down move, which didn't help.\n\nIn the first path, we had three stays, here we have a down and a stay, still 9 actions.\n\nCan we do with less?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=3 at t=3 with fewer actions, but we need to avoid the early times.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, go down to y=2.\n\na0=D, y1=2\n\nThen at t=1, y=2, now we can go up to y=3? a1=U, y2=3\n\nBut at t=2, y=3, now we need to set y3.\n\nIf we go S, y3=3, same.\n\nBut at t=2, if we could go directly, but we cannot go to y=4 because at t=2, y=4 unsafe, and also at t=3 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo must stay or go down.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=4 at a later time.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe only at t=1,2,3, so after t=3, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo save time, from y=3 at t=0, if we go S at t=0, y1=3\n\nThen at t=1, instead of S, go D to y2=2\n\nThen at t=2, y=2, now go S or U or D.\n\nIf go U to y3=3\n\nThen same.\n\nBut y3=3.\n\nThen from t=3, go U to y4=4 at t=4.\n\nThen U to y5=5 at t=5.\n\nThen to y=9, need 4 more U, so up to y9=9 at t=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, after t=3, we go up faster.\n\nBut we have to be at y<=3 at t=3, and y=3 is the highest, so at t=3, y=3.\n\nThen to y=9, need 6 up moves, but we can do it from t=3 to t=8, for example.\n\ny3=3, a3=U, y4=4; a4=U, y5=5; a5=U, y6=6; a6=U, y7=7; a7=U, y8=8; a8=U, y9=9.\n\nNow, in this, we have actions from t=3 to t=8, 6 actions, but we need actions before t=3.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=2, we need to get to y3=3 with some actions.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, if we do nothing, a0=S, y1=3; a1=S, y2=3; then at t=2, y2=3, a2=S, y3=3.\n\nThat's three actions to stay.\n\nIf we do a0=S, a1=D, then y1=3, y2=2 (after a1=D), then at t=2, y2=2, a2=U, y3=3.\n\nStill three actions to reach y3=3.\n\na0=D, y1=2; a1=U, y2=3; a2=S, y3=3, still three.\n\nSo we need at least three actions to reach t=3 at y=3 or less, but since y=3 is best, and it takes three actions if we start from t=0.\n\nt=0 to t=3, three actions: for example, S,S,S or D,U,S etc., all require three actions to keep y=3 or reach it.\n\nThen from there, six actions to go from y=3 to y=9 with all U, from t=3 to t=8 actions, y from 3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=9.\n\nTotal actions: 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nBut H=9, y9 at t=9.\n\nPerhaps we can be at lower y at t=3 but go up faster, but from lower y, it takes more moves to reach high y.\n\nFor example, if y3=2, then to y=9, need 7 ups, so even more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H should be 9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose we can reach y=9 at t=8.\n\nThen y8=9.\n\nThat means from y0=3 to y8=9, net +6 in 8 actions.\n\nSo possible with 6 U and 2 S, or 7 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nNow, positions over time.\n\ny_t for t=0 to 8.\n\ny0=3\n\ny8=9\n\nAnd for each t, if y_t in 1-8, must be safe at t.\n\nNow, at t=3, must have y3 <=3 to avoid collision on high y.\n\nAlso, y5 >=4 to avoid low y unsafe at t=5-8.\n\nNow, y3 <=3.\n\ny5 >=4.\n\nSince y changes slowly, y4 between y3 and y5.\n\ny3 <=3, y5 >=4, so y4 must be 3 or 4, because if y4=2, then y5<=3<4 impossible, similarly y4=1 or 0 impossible.\n\ny4=3 or 4.\n\nIf y4=3, then y5 must be 4 (since >=4 and from y4=3, only U to 4).\n\nIf y4=4, y5=4 or 5.\n\nNow, y3 <=3, and y4 = y3 + delta, so if y3=3, y4 could be 2,3,4; but y4 must be 3 or 4, so not 2.\n\nSimilarly if y3=2, y4 could be 1,2,3; but y4 must be 3 or 4, so only y4=3 possible with U.\n\nSimilarly y3=1, y4=2 max, not 3 or 4, impossible.\n\nSo y3 must be 2 or 3.\n\nIf y3=3, then y4 must be 3 or 4.\n\nIf y3=2, then y4 must be 3 (with U), then y5 must be 4 (with U).\n\nNow, also at early times, avoid y=4 at t=1,2.\n\ny at t=1 and t=2.\n\ny0=3.\n\nAt t=1, y1 cannot be 4, because if y1=4, unsafe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, y2 cannot be 4, unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow, y1 = y0 + delta a0.\n\na0 cannot be U, because if U, y1=4, collision.\n\nSo a0 must be S or D.\n\nIf S, y1=3\n\nIf D, y1=2\n\nSimilarly, y2 = y1 + delta a1.\n\ny2 cannot be 4.\n\nIf y1=3, then a1 cannot be U, because y2=4, collision. So a1 must be S or D.\n\nIf y1=2, then a1 could be U to y2=3, or S to y2=2, or D to y2=1.\n\nNow, y3 = y2 + delta a2.\n\ny3 <=3.\n\nAlso, for H=8, y8=9.\n\nNow, let's see if possible.\n\nSuppose y3=3.\n\nThen y4 must be 3 or 4.\n\ny5 must >=4.\n\nNow, from t=3 to t=8, 5 actions, to go from y3 to y8=9.\n\nNet +6, but y3=3, y8=9, delta +6 in 5 actions? 5 actions, max increase 5, min decrease 5, but 3 to 9 is +6>5, impossible to reach in 5 actions from y3=3.\n\ny3 at t=3, after 3 actions? Let's clarify indices.\n\nAt time t, position before action y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H.\n\nFor y8=9, with 8 actions from t=0 to t=7? Actions at t=0 to t=7, 8 actions, y at t=8.\n\ny0=3, y8=9, so in 8 steps (from t=0 to t=7 actions), net +6.\n\nNumber of actions: 8.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,1.\n\nSum of changes = +6.\n\nNow, y3 at t=3, which is after 3 actions (a0,a1,a2).\n\ny3 = y0 + sum_{i=0}^2 delta y_i\n\nSimilarly, y8 = y0 + sum_{i=0}^7 delta y_i = 3 + sum =9, so sum_{i=0}^7 delta y_i =6.\n\ny3 = 3 + sum_{i=0}^2 delta y_i\n\nSince y3 <=3, so sum_{i=0}^2 delta y_i <=0.\n\nSimilarly, y5 at t=5, after 5 actions? y5 = y0 + sum_{i=0}^4 delta y_i\n\nMust >=4.\n\nBut we have y3 <=3, and y5 >=4.\n\ny5 - y3 = delta y_3 + delta y_4\n\nSince y5 >=4, y3 <=3, so y5 - y3 >=1, so delta y_3 + delta y_4 >=1.\n\nBut each delta at most 1, so possible.\n\nBack to H=8.\n\ny8=9, y0=3, 8 actions, net +6.\n\ny3 <=3.\n\nSuppose y3=3.\n\nThen from t=3 to t=8, 5 actions to go from y3=3 to y8=9, which requires +6 in 5 actions, impossible since max increase 5. Contradiction.\n\nIf y3=2, then to y8=9, need +7 in 5 actions, even worse.\n\ny3 <=3, so y3 <=3, y8=9, so in the 5 actions from t=3 to t=7 (actions a3 to a7), y changes from y3 to y8.\n\ny8 = y3 + sum_{i=3}^7 delta y_i\n\nSet to 9.\n\ny3 <=3, so sum_{i=3}^7 delta y_i = 9 - y3 >= 9-3=6\n\nBut from t=3 to t=7, 5 actions (a3,a4,a5,a6,a7), so max sum delta y =5, but 6>5, impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=8, y8=9, but from y3<=3 to y8=9 in 5 steps, requires at least 6 steps if y3=3, but only 5 actions, impossible.\n\nHence H=8 is impossible.\n\nMinimal H is 9.\n\nWith H=9, we have paths as before.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nIn the first path: actions at turns t_1 + t for t=0 to 8.\n\nt_1 =11.\n\nSo turns: 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn my first path: a0=S (at t=0, turn 11), a1=S (turn12), a2=S (turn13), a3=U (turn14), a4=U (turn15), a5=U (turn16), a6=U (turn17), a7=U (turn18), a8=U (turn19)\n\nThen at turn 20, position y=9, but we don't have action at turn 19? Actions from turn 11 to 19, that's 9 actions.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, with H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn 11 to 19.\n\nAfter action at turn 19, y at turn 20 is 9.\n\nNow, but in the path, we can have different actions, but minimal is 9.\n\nTo confirm, is there a path with H=9 that avoids all collisions.\n\nIn this path:\n\nTurn 11 (t=0): position y=3, safe, action S, then y=3 for turn 12.\n\nTurn 12 (t=1): position y=3, safe, action S, then y=3 for turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 (t=2): position y=3, safe, action S, then y=3 for turn 14.\n\nTurn 14 (t=3): position y=3, safe, action U, then y=4 for turn 15.\n\nTurn 15 (t=4): position y=4, at t=4, y=4 safe? t=4, freeway 4, unsafe only at t=1,2,3,11,... t=4 safe, yes. Action U, then y=5 for turn 16.\n\nTurn 16 (t=5): position y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at t=3, t=5 safe. Action U, then y=6 for turn 17.\n\nTurn 17 (t=6): y=6, safe (unsafe t=3 only). Action U, y=7 for turn 18.\n\nTurn 18 (t=7): y=7, safe. Action U, y=8 for turn 19.\n\nTurn 19 (t=8): position y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only at t=3, t=8 safe. Action U, then y=9 for turn 20.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWe can have fewer stays if possible, but in this case, we have three stays at the beginning.\n\nIn the other path with down, we had one down and one stay, but same number of actions.\n\nBut with down, we might be lower, but in this case same.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, which is 9.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9.\n\nPerhaps we can start with down to save a step, but not.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=1 and t=2, we can be on lower y, but still need to be at y<=3 at t=3.\n\nFor example, a0=D, y1=2\n\nt=1: y=2, a1=S, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nThen same as before, but we used a down and a stay, whereas in the first we used three stays, but both H=9.\n\nIn this, actions: a0=D, a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U\n\nThen y: start3, after D:2, after S:2, after U:3, after U:4, etc., same as before but y at t=1 is 2, not 3.\n\nBut H still 9.\n\nNo reduction.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we can choose.\n\nBut in the first one, all actions are defined.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nBut in the car state, for k=4, there is a car at t=11,12,13, but in our path, at t=11, we are not on y=4, we are on y=3, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut from turn 14 U to y=4 at turn 15, then turn 15 U to y=5 at turn 16, etc.\n\nIn terms of the answer format.\n\nBut we can write the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t_1 =11: action a_{11}\n\nThen up to turn 11 + H -1 =11+8=19? H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, actions at turn t_1 + t.\n\nFor H=9, t from 0 to 8, turns 11 to 19.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 19, action U, then at turn 20, position (0,9).\n\nBut we don't care after.\n\nNow, I think this is correct.\n\nTo make it with fewer actions, but not possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\) (offset \\(t = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Since \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 1\\) (due to a car on freeway 4), moving up (U) would cause a collision at turn 12. Therefore, staying (S) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\) (offset \\(t = 1\\)), the player is still at \\(y = 3\\). Moving up (U) would move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 13, but \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 2\\), so staying (S) is chosen to remain safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 13\\) (offset \\(t = 2\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Moving up (U) would move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14, but at turn 14 (offset \\(t = 3\\)), \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe. Additionally, all freeways \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at \\(t = 3\\), so staying (S) is chosen to keep \\(y = 3\\) for turn 14, which is safe at \\(t = 3\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 14\\) (offset \\(t = 3\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Now, moving up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) is safe because \\(t = 3\\) is the last unsafe turn for \\(y = 4\\), and the move occurs after the collision check.\n- From turn \\(t = 15\\) to \\(t = 19\\), moving up (U) each turn progresses safely to \\(y = 9\\):\n  - At turn \\(15\\) (offset \\(t = 4\\)), \\(y = 4\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(t = 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13\\)).\n  - At turn \\(16\\) (offset \\(t = 5\\)), \\(y = 5\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(t = 3\\)).\n  - At turn \\(17\\) (offset \\(t = 6\\)), \\(y = 6\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(t = 3\\)).\n  - At turn \\(18\\) (offset \\(t = 7\\)), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(t = 3\\)).\n  - At turn \\(19\\) (offset \\(t = 8\\)), \\(y = 8\\) is safe (unsafe only at \\(t = 3\\)), and moving up reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 9 turns, which is minimal, as \\(H = 8\\) is impossible due to the constraints at \\(t = 3\\) (must be at \\(y \\leq 3\\)) and \\(t = 5\\) (must be at \\(y \\geq 4\\)), requiring at least 9 actions to navigate safely.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 12, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For right-moving cars, the span moves to the right with time. The span at time T is given by:\n\nFor a right-moving car: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince at t_1, the head is h and tail is τ, so for right-moving, head > tail, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No, let's see:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might be confusing because usually head is the front, but here for right-moving, τ is tail and h is head, so [τ, h] means from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h head, τ tail.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 4, it has (0, -11, right, 4), so head=0, tail=-11? But for right-moving, if head=0 and tail=-11, that means the car is from x=-11 to x=0, so it's moving right, so at t_1=12, it's at [-11, 0].\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-11 + 4(T-12), 0 + 4(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: when you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you only check collision for cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nLet me read: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo at each turn T, you are on a row y_T, and you check if for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that row.\n\nIf you move to a different row at turn T, you are on the old row at turn T, and on the new row at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9, so I need to move up. Actions U, D, S: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny between 0 and 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, at y=9, can't go up, but since I'm going to 9, I might be able to go up.\n\nStart at t=12, y=3.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 12.\n\nFreeways 1 to 8 have cars, but y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nI am at y=3, so freeway 3 is the row I'm on now.\n\nBut I need to avoid when I'm on each row.\n\nSince I start at y=3, at turn 12, I need to check if there is a collision at (0,3) at turn 12.\n\nFreeway 3: cars: (-12, -23, right, 3)\n\nSince direction right, span at T: [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [-23 + 3(T-12), -12 + 3(T-12)]\n\nAt T=12: [-23 + 0, -12 + 0] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 is not in [-23, -12], since -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in, so no collision at start.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, since I need to increase y by 6 (from 3 to 9), if I go up every turn, it would take 6 turns, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut I should try to go up as fast as possible, unless blocked.\n\nNow, let's analyze each freeway to see when it's safe to be at y=k at turn T.\n\nFor each row k, and for each turn T, I need to know if at that turn, 0 is occupied by a car on row k.\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span of any car on row k at turn T.\n\nSo for each row k, I need the times when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns, so at integer turns.\n\nAlso, cars might be multiple on a row.\n\nList all cars per row.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): one car: (-12, -23, right, 3)\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 + 3(T-12), -12 + 3(T-12) ]\n\nSet 0 in span: min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin = -23 + 3(T-12)\n\nmax = -12 + 3(T-12)\n\nSo -23 + 3(T-12) <= 0 <= -12 + 3(T-12)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 3(T-12) <= 0 => 3(T-12) <= 23 => T-12 <= 23/3 ≈ 7.666, so T-12 <= 7 since T integer? T-12 <= floor(23/3) but better to keep fractional.\n\n3(T-12) <= 23, T-12 <= 23/3 ≈ 7.666, so T <= 12 + 7.666 = 19.666, so T <= 19 since T integer? Let's see.\n\n-23 + 3(T-12) <= 0 => 3(T-12) <= 23 => T-12 <= 23/3 = 7 + 2/3, so T-12 <= 7, since T integer? No, T-12 can be 7 or less, but 7.666, so T-12 <= 7.666, so for integer T, T-12 <= 7, so T <= 19? 12 + 7 = 19, and 12+8=20, T-12 <= 7.666, so T-12 <= 7 for integer? Let's list possible T.\n\nSet u = T-12, so at time u after t_1.\n\nFor freeway 1 car: min = -23 + 3u, max = -12 + 3u\n\n0 in [min,max] iff min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin <= 0: -23 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= 23 => u <= 23/3 ≈ 7.666\n\n0 <= max: 0 <= -12 + 3u => 3u >=12 => u >=4\n\nSo u >=4 and u <=7.666, so for integer u, u=4,5,6,7\n\nSince u=7: min = -23+21= -2, max=-12+21=9, 0 in [-2,9], yes\n\nu=8: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min, 0<1, not in [1,12], so no\n\nu=4: min=-23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0, 0<=0 true, min=-11<=0 true, so yes\n\nu=5: min=-23+15= -8, max=-12+15=3, 0 in yes\n\nu=6: min=-23+18= -5, max=-12+18=6, 0 in yes\n\nu=7: as above\n\nu=3: min=-23+9= -14, max=-12+9= -3, both negative, 0 not in\n\nu=8: min=1, max=12, 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at u=4,5,6,7, i.e., turns T=12+4=16 to 12+7=19\n\nT=16,17,18,19\n\nu=T-12, so T=16,17,18,19\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, cars: (-12,-23,right,3), identical to freeway 1, so same, unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3: same car, (-12,-23,right,3), so also unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nBut at T=12, u=0, min=-23, max=-12, safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: has three cars: (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4), (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, right, s=4\n\nAt T, span: [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [-11 + 4u, 0 + 4u] where u=T-12\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4), head=36, tail=25? Span(t_1)= [τ,h] = [25,36] for right-moving? In the table, it says (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn (36,25,right,4), head=36, tail=25, so at t_1, span [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 + 4u, 36 + 4u]\n\nThird car: (-40,-51,right,4), head=-40? head=-40, tail=-51? head should be larger, but -40 > -51, so head=-40, tail=-51, span at t_1: [-51,-40]? But for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] = [-51, -40]\n\nThen at T: [ -51 + 4u, -40 + 4u ]\n\nNow, 0 in span for any car on freeway 4.\n\nFirst car: [ -11 + 4u, 0 + 4u ] = [ -11 + 4u, 4u ]\n\n0 in this iff -11 + 4u <= 0 <= 4u\n\nLeft: -11 + 4u <= 0 => 4u <=11 => u <= 11/4 = 2.75\n\nRight: 0 <= 4u => u >=0\n\nSo for u=0,1,2\n\nu=0: min=-11, max=0, 0<=0 true\n\nu=1: min=-11+4= -7, max=4, 0 in\n\nu=2: min=-11+8= -3, max=8, 0 in\n\nu=3: min=-11+12=1, max=12, 0 not in since min=1>0\n\nSecond car: [25 + 4u, 36 + 4u], both positive for u>=0, min=25+0=25>0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nThird car: [ -51 + 4u, -40 + 4u ]\n\n0 in this iff -51 + 4u <= 0 <= -40 + 4u\n\nFirst, -51 + 4u <=0 => 4u <=51 => u <= 51/4 = 12.75\n\nSecond, 0 <= -40 + 4u => 4u >=40 => u >=10\n\nSo u >=10 and u <=12.75, so u=10,11,12\n\nu=10: min=-51+40= -11, max=-40+40=0, 0<=0 true\n\nu=11: min=-51+44= -7, max=-40+44=4, 0 in\n\nu=12: min=-51+48= -3, max=-40+48=8, 0 in\n\nu=13: min=-51+52=1, max=-40+52=12, min=1>0, not\n\nSo for freeway 4, unsafe when first car is at 0 or third car at 0.\n\nFirst car: u=0,1,2 → T=12,13,14\n\nThird car: u=10,11,12 → T=22,23,24\n\nT=12+10=22, etc.\n\nNow at u=0, T=12, first car has min=-11, max=0, so at x=0, which is occupied.\n\nBut at T=12, I am at y=3, not y=4, so for freeway 4, at T=12, it is unsafe, but I'm not there, so no issue. Collision only if I am on that row at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nSo freeway 4 unsafe at T for y=4 when:\n\nFrom first car: T=12,13,14\n\nFrom third car: T=22,23,24\n\nAnd second car never unsafe.\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 unsafe at T=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\nT=12,13,14 and 22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: (-24, -35, right, 12), and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-24? head=-24, tail=-35, so for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t_1\n\nAt T: [ -35 + 12u, -24 + 12u ] where u=T-12\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span at t_1 [13,24], at T [13+12u, 24+12u]\n\nNow, 0 in first car span: [ -35 + 12u, -24 + 12u ]\n\n-35 + 12u <= 0 <= -24 + 12u\n\nLeft: -35 + 12u <=0 => 12u <=35 => u <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 + 12u => 12u >=24 => u >=2\n\nSo u >=2 and u <=2.916, so u=2\n\nu=2: min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, so 0 in\n\nu=3: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, min=1>0, not\n\nNow second car: [13+12u, 24+12u], min=13+0=13>0 for u>=0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at u=2, T=12+2=14\n\nT=14\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? Freeway 6: (-24,-35,right,12), (24,13,right,12) identical to freeway 5, so unsafe at T=14\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, unsafe at T=14\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe at T=14\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3 we have unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 unsafe only at T=14\n\nFreeway 5 is y=5, etc.\n\nNow I am starting at y=3, turn T=12.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there is no freeway 9, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I'm not going there.\n\nNow, the path: I need to go from y=3 to y=9, moving up, down, or stay.\n\nEach action changes y or not.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nAlso, since I can stay or move down, I might need to wait.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=3: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=4: unsafe T=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\ny=5: unsafe T=14\n\ny=6: unsafe T=14\n\ny=7: unsafe T=14\n\ny=8: unsafe T=14\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nI start at T=12, y=3.\n\nAt T=12, y=3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go up every turn: from y=3 to y=9, 6 moves, so at T=12 + 6 = 18, y=18? No.\n\nTurn: at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nStart: turn T=12, y=3\n\nAfter one action, at turn T=13, y_{13} = y_12 + a_{12}\n\nIf I do U at T=12, then at T=13, y=4\n\nSimilarly, if I do S, y=3 at T=13, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, suppose at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe turn when I arrive at y=9.\n\nI need to find a sequence from T=12 to some T=12+H-1, with y_{12+H-1}=9.\n\nSince I start at T=12, and actions from t=12 to t=12+H-2 or something? Let's see.\n\nI take actions from turn t to turn t+H-2, and at turn t+H-1, I am at position.\n\nSet t_start = 12.\n\nI take actions a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., a_{12 + H - 2} for H-1 actions? Let's think.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter taking a_T, at next turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nSo from start turn T=12, after 0 actions, at y=3.\n\nAfter first action a_12, at T=13, y= y_12 + Δy_12\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn T=12 + k, y= y_{12} + sum of Δy from t=12 to t=12+k-1.\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn S, with S = 12 + H - 1? Let's define H as the number of turns from start including start or not.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H - 1, that's H actions.\n\nAt turn t_1, I take a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, I take a_{t_1 +1}, affects y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but I reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, y is set, but I reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t_1 + H -1}, and that should be 9.\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might move me, but the position at that turn is before action? I think the position is at the beginning of the turn or after action?\n\nLet's read the dynamics.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo position at turn t is y_t.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that position y_T, and 0 in span for that row at turn T.\n\nThen I reach at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nActions: I take a_{t_1}, a_{t_1 +1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -2}, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\na_{t_1} affects y_{t_1 +1}, a_{t_1 +1} affects y_{t_1 +2}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1} affects y_{t_1 + H}, but since I stop at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, I don't care about y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nFor the last action, a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken at turn t_1 + H -1, and it determines y_{t_1 + H}, but I am already at y_{t_1 + H -1}=9, so the action might be S or something, but it doesn't affect the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe position at turn t is fixed before action.\n\nIn the sequence, for reaching, I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1 are taken, but a_t only affects future positions.\n\nFor collision, at each turn t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when I am at y_t, it must be safe, no collision.\n\nBecause at that turn, I am on that row.\n\nSo for turns from T=12 to S, where S = t_1 + H -1, at each turn, y_T must be safe for that row.\n\nAnd at S, y_S=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince I need to increase y from 3 to 9, the minimal number of turns is at least 6, if I go up every time.\n\nBut with waiting, it might be more.\n\nNow, let's list for each row the unsafe turns.\n\ny=1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=3: same T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=4: unsafe T=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\ny=5: unsafe T=14\n\ny=6: unsafe T=14\n\ny=7: unsafe T=14\n\ny=8: unsafe T=14\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nI start at T=12, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are around T=14 and T=16-19.\n\nFirst, at T=12, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nI can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at T=13.\n\nBut y=4 at T=13: from above, y=4 unsafe at T=13, since T=13 is in 12,13,14.\n\nSo if I go to y=4 at T=13, collision.\n\nAt T=13, y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at T=13, y=3 at T=13: is it safe?\n\ny=3 unsafe only at T=16-19, T=13 is before, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down to y=2, but y=2 at T=13 should be safe, since unsafe only later.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, and avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are all unsafe at T=14, that means at T=14, I cannot be on y=5,6,7, or 8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16,17,18,19, I cannot be on y=1,2,3.\n\nAlso, at T=12,13,14, I cannot be on y=4.\n\nNow, I start at T=12, y=3, safe.\n\nAt T=12, I take action a_12.\n\nIf I take U, then at T=13, y=4, but y=4 unsafe at T=13, collision.\n\nIf I take D, then at T=13, y=2, which is safe at T=13, since unsafe only at 16-19.\n\nIf I take S, at T=13, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, if I go down to y=2, I might need to come back, which takes more turns, so probably not optimal to go down.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be necessary.\n\nNow, at T=13, if I am at y=2 or y=3, both safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, T=14 is a problem for y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=14, and y=5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=14.\n\nSo at T=14, I cannot be on y=4 to 8.\n\nThe only safe rows at T=14 are y=0,1,2,3,9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, but I might not be there yet.\n\ny=1,2,3 are safe at T=14? y=1,2,3 unsafe only at T=16-19, so at T=14, they are safe.\n\ny=0 is also safe, no cars.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so I should be on higher rows if possible.\n\nAt T=14, I must be on y=0,1,2,3 to be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=13, I can be on y=1,2,3, since y=4 unsafe.\n\ny=1,2,3 are safe at T=13.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nAt T=12, I am at y=3.\n\nOption: take S, so at T=13, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=13, I need to take action for T=14.\n\nAt T=14, I must be on y=0,1,2,3.\n\nIf I take U at T=13, then at T=14, y=4, but y=4 unsafe at T=14, collision.\n\nIf I take S, at T=14, y=3, safe.\n\nIf I take D, at T=14, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, similarly, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to go up later.\n\nAfter T=14, the next critical time is T=16-19 for lower rows.\n\nT=15: let's see which rows are unsafe at T=15.\n\ny=1: unsafe only 16-19, so T=15 safe.\n\ny=2: same, safe.\n\ny=3: safe at T=15.\n\ny=4: unsafe at 12,13,14,22,23,24. T=15 not in, so safe? T=15 not in 12,13,14 or 22,23,24, so y=4 safe at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: unsafe only at T=14, so at T=15, safe.\n\ny=6: safe at T=15.\n\ny=7: safe.\n\ny=8: safe.\n\ny=9: safe.\n\nSo at T=15, all rows are safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=16: y=1,2,3 unsafe, y=4 safe (since 22-24 later), y=5,6,7,8 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nT=17,18,19 similar for y=1,2,3 unsafe.\n\nT=20,21 all safe except y=4 at 22-24, but later.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince at T=14, I must be on y<=3, say I am at y=3 at T=14 (by staying or moving).\n\nThen at T=15, I can go up.\n\nFor example, from T=14, y=3, I take U, to y=4 at T=15.\n\ny=4 at T=15 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=5, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid the lower rows at T=16-19.\n\nSince I will be going up, I might be above y=3 by then.\n\nLet's outline a path.\n\nStart: T=12, y=3, safe.\n\nTake action: if I take U, go to y=4 at T=13, but T=13 y=4 unsafe, collision. Not possible.\n\nTake D: to y=2 at T=13, safe.\n\nThen at T=13, y=2.\n\nNow at T=13, I take action.\n\nIf take U, to y=3 at T=14.\n\ny=3 at T=14 is safe.\n\nIf take S, y=2 at T=14, safe.\n\nIf take D, to y=1 at T=14, safe.\n\nBut I want to go up, so better to go to y=3 or stay at y=2.\n\nBut at T=14, I need to be on y<=3 anyway.\n\nNow, suppose at T=13, I take U to y=3 at T=14.\n\nOr from T=12, I take S to stay at y=3 at T=13, then at T=13, take S again to stay at y=3 at T=14.\n\nEither way, at T=14, I am at y=3 (or lower, but let's say y=3).\n\nNow at T=14, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nNow take action for T=15.\n\nI can take U to go to y=4 at T=15.\n\nT=15, y=4 safe, as established.\n\nThen at T=15, y=4.\n\nNow I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go up each turn, but I need to check if any row is unsafe when I am on it.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at T=16.\n\nT=16, y=5: is y=5 unsafe? y=5 unsafe only at T=14, which is past, so at T=16, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 all safe at T=16, since only unsafe at T=14.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo I can go up directly.\n\nPath:\n\nT=12: start y=3\n\na_12: S or D? But if I take S, to stay.\n\nSet actions.\n\nAt T=12: take S, so at T=13, y=3\n\nAt T=13: take S, at T=14, y=3\n\nAt T=14: take U, at T=15, y=4\n\nAt T=15: take U, at T=16, y=5\n\nAt T=16: take U, at T=17, y=6\n\nAt T=17: take U, at T=18, y=7\n\nAt T=18: take U, at T=19, y=8\n\nAt T=19: take U, at T=20, y=9\n\nNow, at turn T=20, y=9, so I reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = 20, so H-1 = 20 - 12 = 8, so H=9? t_1=12, reach at turn S=20, so S = t_1 + H -1 =20, so 12 + H -1 =20, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nBut actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1=12+8=20? a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so for H=9, actions a_12 to a_20, but at T=20, I take a_20 to go to y_21, but I reach at T=20 with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions up to a_19 to reach y=9 at T=20.\n\nList the turns and positions.\n\nTurn T | y_T | action a_T | result y_{T+1}\n\nT=12: y=3, take a_12\n\nAfter a_12, y_13 set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt T=12: y=3, take a_12=S, so y_13=3\n\nT=13: y=3, take a_13=S, y_14=3\n\nT=14: y=3, take a_14=U, y_15=4\n\nT=15: y=4, take a_15=U, y_16=5\n\nT=16: y=5, take a_16=U, y_17=6\n\nT=17: y=6, take a_17=U, y_18=7\n\nT=18: y=7, take a_18=U, y_19=8\n\nT=19: y=8, take a_19=U, y_20=9\n\nAt T=20, y=9, so I have reached at turn T=20.\n\nH is such that t_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=12, so 12 + H -1 =20, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions: from t=12 to t=12+H-1=12+8=20? a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so a_12 to a_20.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions up to a_19, which sets y_20=9.\n\nThen at T=20, I am at y=9, so I need to take action a_20? But a_20 would set y_21, which is not needed.\n\nThe reach is at turn t_1 + H -1, so at that turn, I am at position, and I may or may not take an action, but the action is part of the sequence up to H-1.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor H=9, actions a_12 to a_20.\n\nBut at T=20, when I am at y=9, I take a_20, which could be anything, since I have reached, but I need to specify.\n\nTo minimize H, perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nIn the above, I used 9 turns to go from T=12 to T=20, but from y=3 to y=9, I only moved up 6 times, but I stayed twice at beginning.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if I don't stay, but I have to avoid y=4 at T=13 and T=14.\n\nAt T=12, I could go down to y=2.\n\nT=12: take D, so at T=13, y=2\n\nThen at T=13, take U, to y=3 at T=14\n\nAt T=14, y=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before, at T=14 take U to y=4 at T=15, etc.\n\nBut I reached y=3 at T=14 same as before, and go up.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nCan I be at a higher y by T=15?\n\nFor example, at T=14 I need to be at y<=3.\n\nIf at T=13 I am at y=3, I can only be at y=3 at T=14.\n\nIf I were at y=1 or 2, I might go up, but still y<=3 at T=14.\n\nThen from y=3 at T=14, to y=4 at T=15, then to y=5 at T=16, etc., up to y=9 at T=20, same as before.\n\nBut at T=15, y=4; T=16 y=5; ... T=19 y=8; T=20 y=9.\n\nI could go faster after T=15.\n\nFor example, from T=15 y=4, I go up to y=5 at T=16, but is there a way to skip or something? No, I have to go step by step.\n\nUnless I can be on multiple rows, but no, one row per turn.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=14 I must be low, but after that, all rows are safe except the lower ones at T=16-19, but since I am going up, I will be above.\n\nIn the path, from T=16 to T=19, I am on y=5,6,7,8, all safe at those times.\n\ny=5 at T=16: safe, since unsafe only at T=14.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=4 earlier, but I cannot because at T=13 and T=14, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nAt T=12, if I could go to y=4, but at T=13, unsafe.\n\nT=11 is not available.\n\nSo I have to wait until T=15 to be on y=4.\n\nAt T=15, I can be on y=4.\n\nThen from there, I need 5 more moves to y=9: y=4 to y=5 at T=16, y=6 at T=17, y=7 at T=18, y=8 at T=19, y=9 at T=20.\n\nSo T=20 is the earliest I can be at y=9.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nWhat if I go faster before or after.\n\nBefore T=15, I cannot be above y=3 except at unsafe times.\n\nAt T=12, I am y=3.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 until T=14, then go up.\n\nI could go down to y=0 or something, but that would take more turns to come back, worse.\n\nSo H=9 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt_1=12.\n\nActions:\n\na_12: to set y_13. Since I want to be at y=3 at T=13, so a_12=S or D? If a_12=S, y_13=3.\n\nSimilarly, a_13=S, y_14=3.\n\na_14=U, y_15=4\n\na_15=U, y_16=5\n\na_16=U, y_17=6\n\na_17=U, y_18=7\n\na_18=U, y_19=8\n\na_19=U, y_20=9\n\nAt T=20, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions from a_12 to a_19? But for H, reach at t_1 + H -1 =20, so 12 + H -1=20, H=9.\n\nActions: a_{12} to a_{12 + H -1} = a_{12} to a_{20}.\n\nBut a_{20} is taken at T=20, which sets y_{21}, but I don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a_12 to a_19, which is 8 actions, but H=9 actions? Let's see.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=12 to t=19 inclusive, that's 8 actions: t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nAfter a_19, at T=20, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=12, so 12 + H -1 =20, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nSo I need H=9 actions: a_12 to a_20.\n\na_20 is at turn 20, which I take, but it sets y_{21}, which is beyond, but since I reach at T=20, I can take a_20 as S or something.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor the position at T=20, it is set by previous actions.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the sequence, with a_12 to a_19 as above, I am at y=9 at T=20.\n\nThen a_20 can be anything, say S.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=14 I am at y=3, but instead of going to y=4 at T=15, can I go directly to higher? No.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=15 all safe, I could have been at higher y earlier, but I couldn't because of T=14 constraint.\n\nFor example, if I were at y=4 at T=15, that's the earliest.\n\nUnless I can be at y=5 at T=15, but to be at y=5 at T=15, I need to be at y=4 at T=14 and take U, but at T=14, y=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=4 at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=5 at T=14, unsafe.\n\nSo y=4 at T=15 is earliest possible.\n\nThen y=5 at T=16, etc., to y=9 at T=20.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after, but no, one step per turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at y=9 at T=19 or earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=19, y=9.\n\nThen I need to be at y=8 at T=18, take U at T=18 to y=9 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=17, and so on.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=18, I need to be at y=7 at T=17, etc.\n\nNow, at T=18, y=8: is it safe? y=8 unsafe only at T=14, so at T=18 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine except the beginning.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at some earlier time.\n\nEarliest y=4 at T=15.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=19: from y=4 at T=15 to y=5 at T=16, y=6 at T=17, y=7 at T=18, y=8 at T=19.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=20, same as before.\n\nIf I want y=9 at T=19, I need y=8 at T=18.\n\ny=8 at T=18 requires y=7 at T=17, y=6 at T=16, y=5 at T=15.\n\nBut y=5 at T=15: to be at y=5 at T=15, I need to be at y=4 at T=14 and take U.\n\nBut at T=14, y=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=4 at T=14, thus cannot have y=5 at T=15.\n\nIf I were at y=5 at T=14, but T=14 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 or above at T=15.\n\nThus earliest to be at y=5 is T=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=17, y=7 at T=18, y=8 at T=19, y=9 at T=20.\n\nSo indeed, minimal to reach y=9 is at T=20, with H=9.\n\nNow, in the actions, I have a_12 to a_19 to set the path, but for H=9, I need a_20.\n\nIn the sequence, a_12 to a_19: 8 actions, but H=9 actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, H=9.\n\nActions: a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16, a_17, a_18, a_19, a_20.\n\nWith a_12 to a_19 as above, at T=20 I am at y=9.\n\nThen I can take a_20 = S, for example, to stay, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the path, I stayed at y=3 for T=13 and T=14.\n\nI could have gone down and up, but no benefit.\n\nFor example, at T=12, take D, to y=2 at T=13.\n\nThen at T=13, take U, to y=3 at T=14.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nStill, at T=14 y=3, then proceed.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nSo actions: let's specify.\n\nTo be concrete:\n\nAt T=12: take S, so a_12=S\n\nThen at T=13: y=3, take S, a_13=S\n\nAt T=14: y=3, take U, a_14=U\n\nAt T=15: y=4, take U, a_15=U\n\nAt T=16: y=5, take U, a_16=U\n\nAt T=17: y=6, take U, a_17=U\n\nAt T=18: y=7, take U, a_18=U\n\nAt T=19: y=8, take U, a_19=U\n\nAt T=20: y=9, and I need to take a_20, say a_20=S\n\nNow, in the sequence, for turn t_1 + H -1 =20, I take a_20, but position is already at 9.\n\nNow, about the later unsafe times, like y=4 at T=22-24, but since I will be at y=9 before that, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, lower rows at T=16-19, but I am above y=3.\n\nIn the path, at T=16, I am at y=5, which is above y=3, safe.\n\nT=17 y=6, etc., all safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H smaller?\n\nSuppose I go up immediately when possible.\n\nBut I cannot at T=12.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 at T=15, but what if I go to y=4 earlier? No, unsafe.\n\nAnother thought: at T=12, I take S, stay y=3 at T=13.\n\nThen at T=13, instead of staying, can I go down? But worse.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps after T=14, I can move faster, but no.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the turns from start.\n\nStart at T=12, after 0 turns, at y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_12), at T=13, y=3 (if S)\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_12,a_13), at T=14, y=3 (if both S)\n\nAfter 3 actions (a_14=U), at T=15, y=4\n\nAfter 4 actions, T=16, y=5\n\nAfter 5, T=17, y=6\n\nAfter 6, T=18, y=7\n\nAfter 7, T=19, y=8\n\nAfter 8 actions, T=20, y=9\n\nSo after 8 actions, at T=20, y=9.\n\nI need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is T=20, so after H-1 actions? Actions taken: from a_12 to a_19, 8 actions, reach at T=20.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, 12 + H -1=20, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_12 to a_19 as above, and a_20.\n\na_20 can be S.\n\nIn the collision note, it said that if you move to different row, you are not on new row until next turn, but in this case, no issue.\n\nNow, but in freeway 4, there is a car at T=22-24, but late, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S  (for example)\n\nBut a_19=U sets y_20=9, so at T=20, y=9.\n\nThen a_20 is extra.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nTo save an action, but H=9 is fixed.\n\nPerhaps I don't need a_20, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nAnother idea: can I reach at T=19?\n\nSuppose at T=19, y=9.\n\nThen I need y=8 at T=18, with a_18=U.\n\ny=7 at T=17, etc.\n\nNow, to have y=8 at T=18, need y=7 at T=17, y=6 at T=16, y=5 at T=15.\n\nBut y=5 at T=15: need to be at y=4 at T=14 with a_14=U.\n\nBut at T=14, y=4 is unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 at T=14, but unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach before T=20.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the actions, in the sequence above, I have two S at beginning.\n\nI could have one S and one D, but same.\n\nFor example:\n\na_12: D, then at T=13, y=2\n\na_13: U, at T=14, y=3\n\nThen a_14: U, at T=15, y=4\n\netc., same as before, but at T=13 I was at y=2, which is fine.\n\nBut then actions: a_12=D, a_13=U, a_14=U, ..., up to a_19=U, then a_20=S.\n\nBut I reach at T=20 same.\n\nWith H=9.\n\nIn this case, from T=12 to T=13, I went down and up, but still at T=14 y=3.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think the first plan is fine.\n\nNow, about the car on y=3 at T=16-19, but since I am not on y=3 at those times, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the minimal sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nNow, the current turn is t_1=12, so actions from turn 12.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nSince H=9, actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\nIn the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 12 + 9 -1 = 20, so up to turn 20.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S  (or any, but S is fine)\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_12=S, a_13=S, a_14=U, ..., a_19=U, and at T=20, y=9, then a_20=S.\n\nIf I set a_19=S, then y_20=8, not 9, then I need another action.\n\nBut I need to reach at T=20 with y=9.\n\nSo a_19 must be U to go from y=8 to y=9 at T=20.\n\nIn the path, at T=19, y=8, take a_19=U, so y_20=9.\n\nThen at T=20, I take a_20.\n\nIn the sequence, a_20 is included.\n\nBut for the position at T=20, it is 9, reached.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nTo confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, at T=15, y=4: is it safe?\n\nT=15, u=3, freeway 4: first car span [-11+4*3, 4*3] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: u=3, min=-51+12= -39, max=-40+12= -28, 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt T=16, y=5: freeway 5, unsafe only at T=14, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12 + 9 - 1 = 20\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid unsafe rows at critical turns:\n- At turns \\(T = 13\\) and \\(T = 14\\), \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe due to car positions, so the player must not be on row 4.\n- At turn \\(T = 14\\), rows \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are all unsafe, so the player must be on row \\(y \\leq 3\\) (safe rows are \\(y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 9\\)).\n- The player stays on \\(y = 3\\) for turns \\(T = 13\\) and \\(T = 14\\) to avoid collisions.\n- Starting from turn \\(T = 15\\), all rows are safe, and the player moves up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(T = 20\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- **Turn 12**: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_{13} = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 16-19\\)).\n- **Turn 13**: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_{14} = 3\\) (safe, same reason).\n- **Turn 14**: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{15} = 4\\) (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14, 22, 23, 24\\), but \\(T = 15\\) is safe).\n- **Turn 15**: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{16} = 5\\) (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 14\\)).\n- **Turn 16**: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{17} = 6\\) (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 14\\)).\n- **Turn 17**: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{18} = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 14\\)).\n- **Turn 18**: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{19} = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 14\\)).\n- **Turn 19**: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{20} = 9\\) (reached goal, \\(y = 9\\) is always safe).\n- **Turn 20**: Stay (S), but this action is irrelevant as the goal is already reached at turn 20; it is included to complete the sequence of \\(H = 9\\) actions.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns, as it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) before turn 20 due to the constraints at \\(T = 14\\) preventing the player from being on \\(y \\geq 4\\) until \\(T = 15\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 13. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when the player moves, they are not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T, you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and only on y_{T+1} starting turn T+1. For collision, at turn T, we care about the car on freeway y_T, and whether 0 is in span(T) for that freeway.\n\nAlso, for the car movement: left-moving cars have span [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)] if span(t_1) was [h, τ] with h > τ? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, direction, speed), and span is [h, τ] but since it's left-moving, h should be the head, so if moving left, head is smaller x, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the car representation.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (-9, -20, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so it should be moving to the right.\n\nSpan at t_1: for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front when moving right, so if moving right, head should have higher x, tail lower.\n\nBut in the data, for freeway 1: (-9, -20, right, 3)\n\n-9 and -20, -9 > -20, so if right direction, head should be higher, so h = -9, τ = -20, so span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-20, -9]? But -20 < -9, so [τ, h] with τ = -20, h = -9, so [ -20, -9 ].\n\nThen for T > t_1, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-20 + 3*(T-13), -9 + 3*(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all given cars are right-moving except? Let's see the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: (-9, -20, right, 3) — right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: same\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4), (-36, -47, right, 4) all right\n\nFreeway 5: (-12, -23, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) — for this one, (-12, -23), -12 > -23, so head -12, tail -23 for right-moving, span [ -23, -12 ]\n\nSimilarly, (36,25), 36>25, so [25,36]\n\nBut 25 to 36, and speed 12, fast.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nNow t_1 = 13, current turn.\n\nPlayer at y=3.\n\nGoal y=9.\n\nSince y increases only when moving up, and we start at y=3, need to go to y=9, so minimum moves if no cars, would be 6 up moves, but might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut with cars, we need to find a path.\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAnd player position: at turn T, y_T is the row, and we care about x=0.\n\nAlso, when moving, if at turn T, action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, so during turn T, player is on y_T, and after action, at turn T+1, on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, we care about cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to know when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince cars move, we need to compute for each freeway, the time intervals when 0 is occupied.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so we need the union of times when at least one car covers 0.\n\nThen, for the player to be safe on a freeway at turn T, it must be that at turn T, no car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nTurn T is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt_1 = 13, turns are integers.\n\nSo for each freeway, we can find the set of turns T where it is safe to be on that freeway, meaning no car collision at x=0.\n\nThen the player must be on some y at each turn, and move between them.\n\nStart at turn t_1=13, y=3.\n\nEnd when y=9, and we need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y=9.\n\nSince we can stay, we might reach at turn H, with y_{t_1+H-1} =9, I think the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with t indexing from t_1.\n\nNotation: sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9)? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after action a_t at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =3.\n\nAfter actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+H-1}, we have y_{t_1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1+H} =9.\n\ny_{t_1} =3, after H actions, y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t= t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo go from 3 to 9, need a net +6, so sum of Δy must be +6.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D must be 6, since S doesn't change.\n\nThe minimal H might be more than 6 if we need to stay or go down to avoid cars.\n\nThe sequence ends when y=9, so at turn t_1+H, y=9.\n\nNow for collision, at each turn t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, when the player is on y_t, it must be safe, meaning no collision on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t_1+H, when y_{t_1+H}=9, which is the goal, but if y=9 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the edges, no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe grid: vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new y, during the turn, you are on the old y, so only concerned with the freeway you are currently on.\n\nNow, to plan the path, I need for each freeway, the set of turns where it is safe, i.e., no car has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nSince turns are discrete, I can compute for each freeway k, for each turn T, whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nBut T can be large, but since cars move at constant speed, and we want minimal H, H might be small, say around 10 or so, but with fast cars, we might need to wait, so I should find the safe times.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nt_1 = 13.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-9, -20, right, 3)\n\nAs right-moving, span at t: [τ + s(t-t_1), h + s(t-t_1)] with τ = -20, h = -9, s=3\n\nSpan at time t: [-20 + 3(t-13), -9 + 3(t-13)]\n\n0 in span if -20 + 3(t-13) <= 0 <= -9 + 3(t-13)\n\nSolve:\n\n-20 + 3(t-13) <= 0 and 0 <= -9 + 3(t-13)\n\nFirst inequality: -20 + 3(t-13) <= 0 => 3(t-13) <= 20 => t-13 <= 20/3 ≈ 6.666, so t <= 13 + 6.666 = 19.666, since t integer, t <= 19\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -9 + 3(t-13) => 9 <= 3(t-13) => 3 <= t-13 => t >= 16\n\nSo 0 in span when t >=16 and t <=19\n\nThus unsafe for t=16,17,18,19\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nt is the turn number.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe at t=16,17,18,19\n\nSafe for t<=15 or t>=20\n\nBut t starts from 13, so for t=13 to 15 safe, t=16-19 unsafe, t>=20 safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-9, -20, right, 3) same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also same.\n\nIn the table, freeway 1,2,3 all have the same car: (-9, -20, right, 3)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (4, -7, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, h=4, τ=-7? (head, tail) = (4, -7), so since right, head=4, tail=-7, span at t: [τ + s(t-t_1), h + s(t-t_1)] = [-7 + 4(t-13), 4 + 4(t-13)]\n\n0 in span if -7 +4(t-13) <= 0 <= 4 +4(t-13)\n\nFirst: -7 +4(t-13) <=0 => 4(t-13) <=7 => t-13 <= 7/4=1.75 => t<=14.75, so t<=14\n\nSecond: 0 <=4 +4(t-13) => -4 <=4(t-13) => -1 <= t-13 => t>=12\n\nBut t>=13 since we start, so t>=13\n\nNow t>=13 and t<=14? t>=12, but t min 13, so t=13 and t=14\n\nFirst inequality: -7 +4(t-13) <=0 => 4(t-13) <=7 => t-13 <= 1.75 => t<=14.75, so for integer t, t<=14\n\nSecond: 0 <=4 +4(t-13) => 0 <=4(1 + t-13) => 0 <= 4(t-12), so t-12 >=0, t>=12\n\nSince t>=13, t=13,14\n\nFor t=13: -7 +4(0) = -7 <=0, 0<=4, true\n\nt=14: -7+4(1)= -7+4=-3<=0, 0<=4+4=8, true\n\nt=15: -7+4(2)= -7+8=1 >0, so 1 <=0 false? 0 <=1? The inequality is -7+4(t-13) <=0 <= 4+4(t-13)\n\nAt t=15, left: -7+8=1, 1 <=0? False, 1 >0, so 0 not <= left end, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, right is 4+8=12, 0<12, but left is 1, so span is [1,12] at t=15, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, t=13: span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=14: [-7+4,4+4]= [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=15: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo first car covers t=13,14.\n\nNow second car on freeway 4: (40, 29, right, 4)\n\nHead=40, tail=29? (40,29) both positive, but 40>29, so for right-moving, span at t: [29 +4(t-13), 40 +4(t-13)]\n\n0 in span? Left end 29 +4(t-13) >=29 >0 for t>=13, so always positive, 0 never in span since min is 29 at t=13, increasing. So never unsafe because of this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nHead=-36, tail=-47, so span: [-47 +4(t-13), -36 +4(t-13)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +4(t-13) <=0 <= -36 +4(t-13)\n\nFirst: -47 +4(t-13) <=0 => 4(t-13) <=47 => t-13 <=47/4=11.75 => t<=24.75, t<=24\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +4(t-13) => 36 <=4(t-13) => 9 <= t-13 => t>=22\n\nSo t>=22 and t<=24\n\nThus for freeway 4:\n\n- Car 1 unsafe at t=13,14\n\n- Car 2 never unsafe\n\n- Car 3 unsafe at t=22,23,24\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 unsafe when any car unsafe, so unsafe at t=13,14 (from car1) and t=22,23,24 (from car3)\n\nSafe otherwise, for t>=13.\n\nt=13 and 14 unsafe, t=15 to 21 safe, t=22,23,24 unsafe, etc.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23, span: [-23 +12(t-13), -12 +12(t-13)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12(t-13) <=0 <= -12 +12(t-13)\n\nFirst: -23 +12(t-13) <=0 => 12(t-13) <=23 => t-13 <=23/12≈1.916 => t<=14.916, t<=14\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +12(t-13) => 12 <=12(t-13) => 1 <= t-13 => t>=14\n\nSo t>=14 and t<=14, so t=14\n\nAt t=14: left -23+12(1)= -23+12=-11 <=0, right -12+12=0, 0<=0 true? 0 <= right end, and left <=0, so 0 in span since inclusive? The span is [left, right], and 0 is included if equal.\n\nIn inequality, it says <= and >=, so if equal, included.\n\nAt t=14, left: -23 +12(14-13)= -23+12= -11 <=0\n\nRight: -12 +12(1)=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nSo 0 in span at t=14.\n\nt=13: left -23+0= -23 <=0, right -12 <=0? 0 <= -12? False, 0 > -12, so not <= right end.\n\nInequality: left <=0 <= right\n\nAt t=13: left=-23 <=0, but 0 <= right=-12? 0 <= -12 false, so no.\n\nt=15: left -23+12(2)= -23+24=1 >0, so left=1 >0, not <=0, so no.\n\nSo only t=14 unsafe for this car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nHead=36, tail=25, span [25 +12(t-13), 36 +12(t-13)]\n\nLeft min 25>0, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only unsafe at t=14 from first car.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, cars (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), so same, unsafe only at t=14.\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe only t=14.\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe only t=14.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\n- y=1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: same, t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=3: same, t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=4: unsafe t=13,14,22,23,24\n\n- y=5: unsafe t=14\n\n- y=6: unsafe t=14\n\n- y=7: unsafe t=14\n\n- y=8: unsafe t=14\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t=13, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we can go U six times, from t=13 to t=18, y from 3 to 9.\n\nBut need to check collisions.\n\nAt each turn, we are on a y, must be safe.\n\nStart at t=13, y=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway, unsafe when? From above, y=3 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt t=13, y=3, is it safe? t=13, y=3 unsafe only at 16-19, so t=13 is safe for y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U at t=13, to y=4 at t=14.\n\nBut y=4 at t=14: freeway 4 unsafe at t=13,14,22,23,24, so t=14 unsafe.\n\nSo if we go U at t=13, to y=4 at t=14, but at turn t=14, we are on y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo cannot go directly up at t=13.\n\nWe need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at those turns.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and t=13 is safe for y=3.\n\nOptions: at t=13, we can:\n\n- Go U: then at t=14, y=4, but y=4 unsafe at t=14, so collision.\n\n- Go D: to y=2 at t=14. But y=2 at t=14: is it safe? y=2 unsafe at t=16-19, t=14 not in, so safe? y=2 unsafe only t=16-19, so t=14 safe.\n\nBut going down to y=2, we are moving away from goal y=9.\n\n- Stay S: then at t=14, still y=3, which is safe at t=14? y=3 unsafe t=16-19, t=14 safe.\n\nBut not progressing.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=4 is unsafe at t=13 and t=14, we cannot be on y=4 at those turns.\n\nt=13 we are not on y=4, we start on y=3.\n\nAt t=13, we are on y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=13, at t=14 we are on new y.\n\nIf we go U at t=13, at t=14 on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, at t=14 on y=3, safe.\n\nIf we go down, at t=14 on y=2, safe.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nWe could stay or go down to wait until it's safe to move up.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe only at t=13 and 14? t=13,14 unsafe, then t=15 to 21 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 unsafe only at t=14.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=14 only.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at t=16-19.\n\nNow, goal y=9, safe always.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9 with net +6.\n\nMinimal turns: we might need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=14, many freeways are unsafe: y=4,5,6,7,8 all unsafe at t=14 except y=4 is unsafe, y=5-8 unsafe.\n\ny=4 unsafe t=13,14; y=5 unsafe t=14; etc.\n\nSo at t=14, it's bad to be on y=4 to 8.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, y=4 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nPlan:\n\nStart at t=13, y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to be careful at t=14.\n\nIf we go U at t=13, to y=4 at t=14, unsafe.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nWe can stay at t=13: action S, then at t=14, still y=3, which is safe (since unsafe only 16-19).\n\nAt t=14, we can do something.\n\nBut y=4 at t=15 might be safe? y=4 safe from t=15 to 21.\n\nSimilarly, y=5-8 at t=15: are they safe? y=5 unsafe only t=14, so t=15 safe, similarly for others.\n\nBut at t=14, if we are on y=3, we can go U to y=4 at t=15.\n\nAction at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nPosition during turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t=14, position y_{14}, must be safe.\n\nIf at t=13, we stay S, then y_{14} = y_{13} + 0 = 3, so at turn t=14, on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=14, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go U at t=14, then y_{15} = y_{14} +1 = 3+1=4.\n\nNow at turn t=15, we are on y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=15: from above, safe (since unsafe only 13,14,22-24).\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, what about higher freeways.\n\ny=5 at t=15: safe, since unsafe only t=14.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at t=15.\n\nBut we are at t=15 on y=4.\n\nWe can go up multiple times.\n\nBut there is a problem later with y=1,2,3 at t=16-19 unsafe.\n\nWe are going up, so we might be past y=3 by then.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nStart: t=13, y=3\n\nOption 1: at t=13, stay S\n\nThen t=14, y=3 (safe)\n\nAt t=14, go U, then y_{15} =4\n\nt=15, on y=4 (safe)\n\nNow at t=15, we can go U to y=5 at t=16\n\nt=16, on y=5\n\ny=5 at t=16: is it safe? y=5 unsafe only t=14, so t=16 safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U at t=16 to y=6 at t=17\n\nt=17, on y=6, safe? y=6 unsafe only t=14, so safe.\n\nGo U at t=17 to y=7 at t=18\n\nt=18, on y=7, safe? y=7 unsafe only t=14, safe.\n\nGo U at t=18 to y=8 at t=19\n\nt=19, on y=8, safe? y=8 unsafe only t=14, so safe.\n\nThen go U at t=19 to y=9 at t=20\n\nt=20, on y=9, which is safe, and we reached goal.\n\nNow, check if any collision: we need to be on freeways only when safe.\n\nt=13: y=3, safe\n\nt=14: y=3, safe\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\nt=16: y=5, safe\n\nt=17: y=6, safe\n\nt=18: y=7, safe\n\nt=19: y=8, safe\n\nt=20: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe? y=5 at t=16, yes safe since only unsafe at t=14.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut y=3 at t=14 is safe, yes.\n\nIn this path, we used actions:\n\nt=13: S (stay)\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nThen at t=20, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=13 to t=19 actions, 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions at t=13,14,15,16,17,18,19: that's 7 actions.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn t=13+7=20, y=20? t=13 action, then t=14 position, etc.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at t+1.\n\nStart: turn t=13, position y=3\n\nAfter a_13: y_{14} = y_13 + Δa_13\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nIn the sequence: after a_13, y_14\n\nAfter a_14, y_15\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{13+H-1}, y_{13+H}\n\nSet y_{13+H} =9.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt t=13, after action, say a_13 = S, then y_14 =3\n\na_14 = U, y_15 =4\n\na_15 = U, y_16 =5\n\na_16 = U, y_17 =6\n\na_17 = U, y_18 =7\n\na_18 = U, y_19 =8\n\na_19 = U, y_20 =9\n\nSo at turn t=20, y=9.\n\nH=7 actions: t=13 to t=19.\n\nNow, is this minimal? Without cars, min H=6: U six times, from y3 to y9 in 6 steps.\n\nBut with cars, at t=14, y=4 unsafe, so we cannot go directly.\n\nIn this case, we delayed by one turn by staying at t=13.\n\nCould we go down to avoid?\n\nFor example, at t=13, go down to y=2 at t=14.\n\ny=2 at t=14 safe.\n\nThen at t=14, go up to y=3 at t=15.\n\nt=15 on y=3.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=16-19, but t=15 safe.\n\nThen at t=15, go up to y=4 at t=16.\n\nt=16 on y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=16: from above, safe (unsafe only 13,14,22-24)\n\nThen go up to y=5 at t=17, and so on.\n\nBut to reach y=9, let's see:\n\nt=13: go D, y14=2\n\nt=14: go U, y15=3\n\nt=15: go U, y16=4\n\nt=16: go U, y17=5\n\nt=17: go U, y18=6\n\nt=18: go U, y19=7\n\nt=19: go U, y20=8\n\nt=20: go U, y21=9\n\nThen at turn 21, y=9, with 8 actions, worse than previous 7.\n\nAfter a_13=D, y14=2\n\na_14=U, y15=3\n\na_15=U, y16=4\n\na_16=U, y17=5\n\na_17=U, y18=6\n\na_18=U, y19=7\n\na_19=U, y20=8\n\nNow to go to y9, need another U, so a_20=U, y21=9.\n\nYes, 8 actions.\n\nBut earlier with stay, only 7 actions to reach at t=20.\n\nIn the first path, with stay at t=13, we reached in 7 actions.\n\nBut min without cars is 6, is there a way in 6?\n\nSuppose we go up at t=13 to y=4 at t=14, but t=14 y=4 unsafe, collision, not possible.\n\nGo down? Not helpful.\n\nPerhaps stay at lower y to avoid the t=14 issue, but we need to go up.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=14, y=1,2,3 are safe, we could be there.\n\nBut we start at y=3, if we stay or go down.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to move up eventually.\n\nIn the first path, we moved up from t=14 to t=19, all safe except we skipped t=14 for y=4.\n\nIn that path, we were on y=3 at t=14, which is safe.\n\nThen moved up.\n\nIs there a path with 6 actions?\n\nSuppose we go up later.\n\nFor example, at t=13, stay, then at t=14, we are on y=3, safe.\n\nBut if we go up at t=14 to y=4 at t=15, as before.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times: at t=14, y=4 to 8 unsafe, so we cannot be on them at t=14.\n\nAt t=16-19, y=1,2,3 unsafe, but if we are above y=3, we avoid that.\n\nIn the first path, we were at y=4 at t=15, which is after the unsafe period for y=4 (t=13,14), and we moved up to y=5 at t=16, which is safe since y=5 unsafe only t=14.\n\nSimilarly, no issue with y=1,2,3 unsafe later because we are above.\n\nBut at t=19, we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, back to minimal H.\n\nWith 6 actions: start at y3, after 6 U, y9 at turn 19? Let's see.\n\nIf a13=U, y14=4\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nBut at t=14, y=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we start with S or D, we delay.\n\nSuppose we go down at t=13 to y=2 at t=14.\n\nThen a14=U to y=3 at t=15\n\na15=U to y=4 at t=16\n\na16=U to y=5 at t=17\n\na17=U to y=6 at t=18\n\na18=U to y=7 at t=19\n\na19=U to y=8 at t=20\n\nThen need a20=U to y9 at t=21, 8 actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=13, go U to y4 at t=14, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=0 or something, but y=0 safe, but going down might not help.\n\nAnother thought: since at t=14, y=1,2,3 safe, we could be on y=2 or 3 at t=14.\n\nBut we start at y=3, so if we stay, we are on y=3.\n\nThen at t=14, we can go to y=4 at t=15.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, perhaps we can move up more quickly later, but we have to go through each y.\n\nEach move changes y by 1, so we need to increment step by step.\n\nUnless we stay, but staying doesn't help to go faster.\n\nMinimal number of turns to go from 3 to 9 is 6, but with the constraint, we have to avoid being on certain y at certain t.\n\nSpecifically, we cannot be on y=4 at t=14, which is required if we go up directly.\n\nIn the direct path, we must be on y=4 at t=14 to reach in 6 steps, but unsafe.\n\nTherefore, impossible in 6 steps.\n\nThus minimal H is 7, as in the first path.\n\nBut in the first path, we used one stay at the beginning.\n\nWe could stay later, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=13, go U to y=4 at t=14, unsafe, not possible.\n\nOr at some other point.\n\nSuppose we go to y=9 directly but with stays, but stays increase H without progress.\n\nSo probably 7 is minimal.\n\nIn the path I have: actions: t13: S, t14: U, t15: U, t16: U, t17: U, t18: U, t19: U\n\nThen y20=9.\n\nBut at t=19, we go U to y=8 to y=9, so at t=19, we are on y=8 when we do the action.\n\nIn terms of collision: during turn t=19, we are on y=8, which is safe, as y=8 unsafe only at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions at t=13 to t=19.\n\nAnswer format: list actions starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 20, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence has 7 actions, H=7.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=6? I don't think so, as discussed.\n\nPerhaps we can start by going down to y=2 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0 and come back, but inefficient.\n\nSo H=7 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nAnother thing: at t=16-19, y=1,2,3 unsafe, but in our path, we are not on them during those times.\n\nAt t=16, we are on y=5, etc.\n\nIn the path, at t=16, y=5, safe.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not staying at t=13.\n\nBut if we don't stay, we go to y=4 at t=14, unsafe.\n\nUnless we go down, but going down then up takes more turns.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 4, there is also unsafe at t=22-24, but we are not there yet, since we reach by t=20.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the answer format: \\boxed{ ... } with lines.\n\nAlso, H is the number of turns, which is 7.\n\nBut in the sequence, t from 13 to 19, 7 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=13, we stay, but at t=14, instead of going up immediately, we could do something else, but no need.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=14, we are on y=3, and it's safe, but we could go to y=4 at t=15, as before.\n\nBut if we go up at t=14 to y=4 at t=15, same as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher y faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nUnless we have multiple moves, but each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check if we can be on y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if we could reach by t=19.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn t, we need to have y_t=9.\n\nIn the direct 6-step, y19=9, but we couldn't do it because of t=14 issue.\n\nWith 5 actions? From y3 to y9, min 6 actions, since net +6, each U is +1, so at least 6 U, and no D or S, so exactly 6 actions if all U.\n\nBut with cars, not possible.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have one S and six U, net +6.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,3) at turn 13.\n\nIn the action sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car update, for freeway 4, there is a car that is unsafe at t=13 and 14, but at t=13 we are not on y=4, we are on y=3.\n\nIn the path, we avoid.\n\nAnother thing: when we go from y to y+1, during the turn we are on the old y, so no issue with the new y.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collisions occur if, at any turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\). The player's position updates as \\(y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\\), where \\(\\Delta y_t = +1\\) for action \\(U\\) (up), \\(-1\\) for \\(D\\) (down), or \\(0\\) for \\(S\\) (stay), with \\(y_{t+1}\\) constrained to \\([0, 9]\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\nThe unsafe turns for each freeway (where 0 is within a car's span) are derived from the car states at turn 13:\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (from car \\((-9, -20, \\text{right}, 3)\\)).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (same as freeway 1).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (same as freeway 1).\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at turns 13, 14 (from car \\((4, -7, \\text{right}, 4)\\)) and turns 22, 23, 24 (from car \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 4)\\)). Car \\((40, 29, \\text{right}, 4)\\) never covers 0.\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe at turn 14 (from car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\)). Car \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\) never covers 0.\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at turn 14 (same as freeway 5).\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at turn 14 (same as freeway 5).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turn 14 (same as freeway 5).\n\nFreeways \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Path Planning\n- The player starts at turn 13 on \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at turn 13 (since \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at turns 16–19).\n- A direct upward path in 6 turns (all \\(U\\) actions) is impossible because it would require being on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14, which is unsafe.\n- The minimal path requires 7 turns, with one stay action to avoid the unsafe turn 14 on \\(y = 4\\) and then upward moves when all intermediate freeways are safe.\n- The sequence:\n  - **Turn 13**: Stay (\\(S\\)) at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at turns 16–19).\n  - **Turn 14**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15. At turn 14, the player is on \\(y = 3\\) (safe).\n  - **Turn 15**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16. At turn 15, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (unsafe only at turns 13, 14, 22–24).\n  - **Turn 16**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17. At turn 16, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (unsafe only at turn 14).\n  - **Turn 17**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18. At turn 17, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (unsafe only at turn 14).\n  - **Turn 18**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19. At turn 18, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (unsafe only at turn 14).\n  - **Turn 19**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20. At turn 19, \\(y = 8\\) is safe (unsafe only at turn 14).\n- At turn 20, the player reaches (0, 9), which is safe.\n\nThis path has \\(H = 7\\) turns and avoids all collisions:\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 3\\) safe\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 3\\) safe\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 4\\) safe\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 5\\) safe\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 6\\) safe\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 7\\) safe\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 8\\) safe\n\nNo shorter path exists, as 6 turns would require being on an unsafe freeway at turn 14.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 13 to 19 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: S \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 14, and I'm at y=3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For each car, given its position at turn 14, I can find where it is at any future turn T.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on a freeway y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Also, if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check the car on the y I'm currently on.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays the same). And y is clamped between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head -6, tail -17, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says for freeway 1: (-6, -17, right, 3). But which is head and tail? It says \"head h, tail τ\", so h = -6, τ = -17.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, which is larger, but here h=-6, τ=-17, and -6 > -17, so head is at -6, tail at -17, so the car is from -17 to -6? But direction is right, so as it moves right, head increases.\n\nAt turn t_1=14, span is [τ, h] = [-17, -6]? The notation says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", and for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nLook back: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail, and since it's moving left, head decreases.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, span(t_1) is given as [τ, h], meaning τ is the left end (smaller), h is the right end (larger).\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -6, tail τ = -17, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction is right, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nThen at turn T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-17 + 3(T-14), -6 + 3(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 are the same as freeway 1: one car with (-6,-17,right,3)\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars: (8, -3, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4), (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nFor each, since direction right, span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: τ = -3? Head h=8, tail τ=-3, so span = [-3, 8]\n\nSecond car: head 44, tail 33? τ=33, h=44, span=[33,44]\n\nThird car: head -32, tail -43, span=[-43,-32]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nThen at T, for first car: [ -3 + 4(T-14), 8 + 4(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have two cars each: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFor (0, -11, right, 12): head h=0, tail τ=-11, so span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 12(T-14), 0 + 12(T-14) ] = [ -11 + 12(T-14), 12(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly, (48, 37, right, 12): head 48, tail 37, span=[37,48], at T: [37 + 12(T-14), 48 + 12(T-14)]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThat is, for a car with span [L(T), R(T)] at T, if L(T) <= 0 <= R(T), then collision.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, but player is always at x=0, I assume, since it says position (0,y), so x=0 fixed, y changes.\n\nCars are on the freeways, which are horizontal, so their positions are in x-direction, and player at x=0.\n\nSo at turn T, if player is on y=k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is between L(T) and R(T) inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, which is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. But I need to reach (0,9), which is above the freeways.\n\ny=9 is the vertical position, not a freeway, so when I'm at y=9, I don't care about cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nBut I start at y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 14, I'm at y=3.\n\nNow, freeway 3 has a car: (-6,-17,right,3), so at T=14, span = [-17,-6]\n\nFor collision, 0 must be in the span at the turn I'm on that freeway.\n\nSince the car moves, I need to find when 0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t_1=14.\n\nSet t = T - t_1, so t=0 is current turn.\n\nAt t=0, I am at y=3.\n\nI need to find actions for t=0 to t=H-1, and at t=H-1, y=9.\n\nSince y starts at 3, and I need to get to 9, I have to increase y by 6, so minimum moves: if I go up every turn, it takes 6 turns, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut I might be able to go straight up if no cars block me.\n\nFirst, let's see for each freeway, when 0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car at [ -17 + 3t, -6 + 3t ] since T-t_1 = t.\n\n0 is in span if -17 + 3t <= 0 <= -6 + 3t\n\nSo -17 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -6 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: 3t <= 17, t <= 17/3 ≈ 5.666, so t <= 5 since t integer\n\nt is turn number, integer.\n\n-17 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 17 => t <= 5 (since t integer)\n\n0 <= -6 + 3t => 3t >= 6 => t >= 2\n\nSo for t=2,3,4,5, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, same thing, occupied at t=2,3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 3: same, occupied t=2,3,4,5.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (8,-3,right,4), span at t: [ -3 + 4t, 8 + 4t ]\n\n0 in span: -3 + 4t <= 0 <= 8 + 4t\n\n-3 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 3 => t <= 0.75, so t <= 0 since t>=0 integer\n\n0 <= 8 + 4t always true since t>=0\n\nBut t<=0, so at t=0, -3 +0 = -3 <=0, and 0<=8, yes.\n\nAt t=0, span is [-3,8], 0 is between -3 and 8, yes.\n\nBut t=0 is current turn, and I'm not on freeway 4 now, I'm on y=3.\n\nFor future, t>=1.\n\nAt t=0, occupied, but for t>=1:\n\n-3 + 4t <=0 => 4t <=3 => t<=0.75, so for t>=1, -3+4t >= -3+4=1>0? t=1, -3+4=1>0, so -3+4t >=1 for t>=1, so 0 < -3+4t, so 0 not <= left end, so not occupied for t>=1.\n\nSimilarly, right end is larger, so only at t=0 it might be occupied, but for future turns t>=1, not occupied by first car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (44,33,right,4), span at t: [33 +4t, 44+4t]\n\n33+4t >0 for all t>=0, so 0 not in [33+4t,44+4t] since min is 33>0.\n\nThird car: (-32,-43,right,4), head -32? Head h=-32, tail τ=-43, span=[-43 +4t, -32 +4t]\n\n0 in span: -43 +4t <=0 <= -32 +4t\n\nFirst: -43+4t <=0 => 4t <=43 => t<=10.75, t<=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32 +4t => 4t >=32 => t>=8\n\nSo for t=8,9,10\n\nAt t=8: -43+32= -11? -43+4*8= -43+32= -11 <=0, -32+32=0 <=0, so 0 included.\n\nSimilarly t=9: -43+36= -7 <=0, -32+36=4 >=0, 0 in between.\n\nt=10: -43+40= -3 <=0, -32+40=8>=0.\n\nt=11: -43+44=1>0, so left end >0, not.\n\nSo for freeway 4, occupied when: by first car at t=0, but t=0 not future; by third car at t=8,9,10.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied at t=8,9,10.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12), span at t: [ -11 +12t, 0 +12t ] = [ -11+12t, 12t ]\n\n0 in span: -11+12t <=0 <=12t\n\nFirst: -11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 <1, so t=0 only? t integer >=0.\n\nt=0: -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nFor t>=1, -11+12t >= -11+12=1>0, so 0 < left end, not occupied.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), span [37+12t, 48+12t] min 37>0, so never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied only at t=0 by first car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: same as freeway 5, each has identical cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12), so for each, occupied only at t=0 by the first car.\n\nFor freeway 6, at t=0, car (0,-11,right,12) has span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nBut at t=0, I'm not on these freeways, so for future moves, t>=1, freeways 5,6,7,8 are never occupied, since only t=0 occupied and past.\n\nt=0 is now, but when I move, I consider future turns.\n\nFor t>=1, on freeways 5-8, no car occupies 0, because:\n\nFor the (0,-11,right,12) car, at t=1, span [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAnd the other car is always away.\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 are always safe for t>=1. That is, from turn t_1+1 onwards, no car at x=0.\n\nBut I need to be on the freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is occupied at t=8,9,10 relative to now.\n\nt=8 means turn t_1 +8 =14+8=22, etc.\n\nBut I can use relative t.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 6, if I can go up every turn without being hit.\n\nBut let's see where I can be hit.\n\nAt t=0, I am on y=3, and at t=0, is freeway 3 occupied?\n\nFreeway 3 car: at t=0, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -17 <=0 but 0 <= -6? 0 > -6, so 0 not <= -6? The inequality is L <= 0 <= R.\n\nHere L = -17, R = -6, -17 <= 0 is true, but 0 <= -6 is false, since 0 > -6. So 0 not in [-17,-6], so not occupied at t=0. I am safe at start.\n\nNow, if I go up immediately.\n\nSuppose at t=0, I choose U, go to y=4.\n\nBut at t=0, I am at y=3, I choose action for turn t_1=14.\n\nAfter action, at turn t_1+1, y is updated.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, player position is y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence is: at turn T, I am at y_T, then I choose a_T, and y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen, for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars at turn T.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span(T) but not span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I might collide only with cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, I am still on y_T, not on y_{T+1} yet.\n\nIn terms of the sequence:\n\nStart at turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 3.\n\nI choose a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am on y=3, and cars at t_1=14 are as given.\n\nFor freeway 3, at t_1, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nThen, if I choose U, y_{t_1+1} = 4.\n\nNow at turn t_1+1, I am on y=4, and I need to check cars on y=4 at time t_1+1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBack to minimal path.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 6 steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid, but since cars are moving, going down might not help, and y=0 is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go straight up from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nStart at t=0 (turn 14), y=3, no collision as above.\n\nAction a_{14} = U, so y_{15} = 4\n\nAt turn 15 (t=1 relative), y=4, freeway 4.\n\nCars on freeway 4 at time T=15.\n\nt=1, relative to t_1=14.\n\nAt t=1, freeway 4: we need span at T=15.\n\nFrom earlier, for freeway 4, at relative t=1, is it occupied?\n\nEarlier we said for freeway 4, occupied at t=8,9,10, and t=0 but t=0 is past.\n\nt=1: not occupied, as per cars.\n\nFirst car: at t=1, span [-3+4(1), 8+4(1)] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [33+4,44+4]=[37,48], no\n\nThird car: [-43+4, -32+4] = [-39,-28], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=1, freeway 4 not occupied, safe.\n\ny_{15}=4, no collision.\n\nThen a_{15} = U, y_{16} =5\n\nTurn 16 (t=2), y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=2.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: at t=2, first car: [ -11 +12*2, 12*2] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 all similar, no car at 0 for t>=1.\n\nSo at turn 16, y=5, safe.\n\na_{16} = U, y_{17}=6\n\nTurn 17 (t=3), y=6, freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3, freeway 6: first car [ -11 +12*3, 36] = [-11+36,36]=[25,36], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\na_{17} = U, y_{18}=7\n\nTurn 18 (t=4), y=7, freeway 7.\n\nt=4, car [ -11+48, 48] = [37,48]? -11+12*4= -11+48=37, yes [37,48], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\na_{18} = U, y_{19}=8\n\nTurn 19 (t=5), y=8, freeway 8.\n\nt=5, car [ -11+60, 60] = [49,60], no 0.\n\nSafe.\n\na_{19} = U, y_{20}=9\n\nNow at turn 20, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and I reached y=9.\n\nI started at turn 14, y=3.\n\nAfter 6 actions: U at 14,15,16,17,18,19 to reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nt from 0 to 5, 6 turns, y from 3 to 9.\n\nAt turn 20, y=9, done.\n\nNow, is there any collision during this? I think not, as above.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nTurn 14 (t=0): y=3, safe\n\nAction U, y=4 for next turn.\n\nTurn 15 (t=1): y=4, freeway 4, at time 15, cars as above, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U, y=5\n\nTurn 16 (t=2): y=5, freeway 5, at time 16, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U, y=6\n\nTurn 17 (t=3): y=6, freeway 6, time 17, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U, y=7\n\nTurn 18 (t=4): y=7, freeway 7, time 18, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U, y=8\n\nTurn 19 (t=5): y=8, freeway 8, time 19, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U, y=9\n\nTurn 20: y=9, not a freeway, done.\n\nSo I reached in 6 turns.\n\nBut is there a problem? I think I missed something.\n\nWhat about freeways 1,2,3? They are occupied at t=2,3,4,5 relative.\n\nt=2,3,4,5 relative to t_1=14.\n\nt=2 is turn 16, etc.\n\nBut in my path, I was on y=5 at turn 16 (t=2), which is freeway 5, not freeway 1,2,3.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 are y=1,2,3, I was on y=4,5,6,7,8 during t=1 to 5.\n\ny=1,2,3 are occupied at t=2,3,4,5, but I was not on them, so no issue.\n\nFor example, at turn 16 (t=2), freeway 1 is occupied, but I am on y=5, not y=1, so fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo it seems I can go straight up in 6 moves.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I need to be careful.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 19, I am on y=8, and I go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 6 actions, from turn 14 to 19, reaching y=9 at turn 20.\n\nThe sequence is actions at turn 14 to 19, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nBut let me see if I can do faster? Minimum is 6, since I need +6 in y, and each U gives +1, so at least 6 U actions, so H at least 6. I achieved 6, so it should be minimal.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to wait? For example, if at some point I would be hit, but in this case, not.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, but at t=1, it was safe.\n\nt=1 relative, turn 15.\n\nNow, what about later? For example, freeway 4 is occupied at t=8,9,10, which is turn 22,23,24, but I am at y=9 before that, turn 20, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 4.\n\nAt turn 15, t=1, freeway 4: first car [ -3 +4(1), 8+4(1)] = [-3+4, 8+4] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car at t=1: [-43+4, -32+4] = [-39,-28], not 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 to 8, for t>=1, the cars that were at 0 at t=0 have moved away, and no car covers 0.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 car: at t=0, [ -11, 0 ], so 0 covered.\n\nAt t=1, [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], not 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo in the path, when I am on freeway 5 at turn 16 (t=2), it is [13,24], not 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions.\n\nNow, for turn 14 to 19, all U.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1+5: a_{t_1+5} = U\n\nt_1=14, so actions from turn 14 to turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9, no action needed, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y should be 9.\n\nIn this case, H=6 actions: at turn t_1 to t_1+5, actions a_{14} to a_{19}, all U, then at turn 20, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI could have S actions, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nD actions would make me go down, which is worse.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nBut is there any constraint I missed?\n\nThe player position: when I go U from y=8, to y=9, which is fine.\n\ny=9 is allowed.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 8, at turn 19, t=5, car [ -11 +12*5, 12*5] = [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], not 0, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 4 cars again.\n\nAt t=8,9,10, freeway 4 occupied, but I am not there.\n\nPerhaps if I were slower, but I am fast.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 5 at t=0 is at [ -11,0], so 0 covered, but I was not on y=5 at t=0, so fine.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at t=2, which is fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with all U actions.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nI need to write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nt_1 = 14\n\nAction sequence for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere H=6, so t=0 to 5: a_{14+0} to a_{14+5} = a_{14} to a_{19}\n\nYes.\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H = 14+6=20, y=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer, it seems only sequence is needed, but H is determined.\n\nIn the box, only sequence.\n\nBut I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I couldn't go straight, but here I can.\n\nPerhaps on freeway 3, at t=0, I am safe, but if I stay, at t=1, freeway 3 is occupied? Let's see.\n\nAt t=1, relative, turn 15.\n\nFreeway 3 car: span at t=1: [-17 +3(1), -6 +3(1)] = [-14,-3]\n\n0 in? -14 <=0 <= -3? 0 <= -3 false, so no, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, only at t=2,3,4,5: t=2, [-17+6, -6+6]=[-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=3, [-17+9,-6+9]=[-8,3], 0 in.\n\nt=4, [-17+12,-6+12]=[-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=5, [-17+15,-6+15]=[-2,9], 0 in.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on y=3 at those times.\n\nIf I stay on y=3, I would be hit at t=2,3,4,5.\n\nBut I moved up.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 6, achieved by moving up (U) in every turn from turn 14 to turn 19. This sequence increases the y-coordinate from 3 to 9 in 6 turns without any collisions, as verified below.\n\n### Collision Analysis for the Sequence:\n- **Turn 14 (\\(t = 0\\) relative)**: Player at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3).  \n  Car on freeway 3: span at \\(t = 0\\) is \\([-17, -6]\\).  \n  \\(0 \\notin [-17, -6]\\) (since \\(-17 \\leq 0\\) but \\(0 \\not\\leq -6\\)), so no collision.  \n  Action: U, so \\(y_{15} = 4\\).\n\n- **Turn 15 (\\(t = 1\\) relative)**: Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4).  \n  Cars on freeway 4:\n  - First car: span at \\(t = 1\\) is \\([-3 + 4(1), 8 + 4(1)] = [1, 12]\\), \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\).\n  - Second car: span at \\(t = 1\\) is \\([33 + 4(1), 44 + 4(1)] = [37, 48]\\), \\(0 \\notin [37, 48]\\).\n  - Third car: span at \\(t = 1\\) is \\([-43 + 4(1), -32 + 4(1)] = [-39, -28]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-39, -28]\\).  \n  No collision.  \n  Action: U, so \\(y_{16} = 5\\).\n\n- **Turn 16 (\\(t = 2\\) relative)**: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5).  \n  Cars on freeway 5:\n  - First car: span at \\(t = 2\\) is \\([-11 + 12(2), 12(2)] = [13, 24]\\), \\(0 \\notin [13, 24]\\).\n  - Second car: span at \\(t = 2\\) is \\([37 + 12(2), 48 + 12(2)] = [61, 72]\\), \\(0 \\notin [61, 72]\\).  \n  No collision.  \n  Action: U, so \\(y_{17} = 6\\).\n\n- **Turn 17 (\\(t = 3\\) relative)**: Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).  \n  Cars on freeway 6 (similar to freeway 5):\n  - First car: span at \\(t = 3\\) is \\([-11 + 12(3), 12(3)] = [25, 36]\\), \\(0 \\notin [25, 36]\\).\n  - Second car: span at \\(t = 3\\) is \\([37 + 12(3), 48 + 12(3)] = [73, 84]\\), \\(0 \\notin [73, 84]\\).  \n  No collision.  \n  Action: U, so \\(y_{18} = 7\\).\n\n- **Turn 18 (\\(t = 4\\) relative)**: Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7).  \n  Cars on freeway 7 (similar to freeway 5):\n  - First car: span at \\(t = 4\\) is \\([-11 + 12(4), 12(4)] = [37, 48]\\), \\(0 \\notin [37, 48]\\).\n  - Second car: span at \\(t = 4\\) is \\([37 + 12(4), 48 + 12(4)] = [85, 96]\\), \\(0 \\notin [85, 96]\\).  \n  No collision.  \n  Action: U, so \\(y_{19} = 8\\).\n\n- **Turn 19 (\\(t = 5\\) relative)**: Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8).  \n  Cars on freeway 8 (similar to freeway 5):\n  - First car: span at \\(t = 5\\) is \\([-11 + 12(5), 12(5)] = [49, 60]\\), \\(0 \\notin [49, 60]\\).\n  - Second car: span at \\(t = 5\\) is \\([37 + 12(5), 48 + 12(5)] = [97, 108]\\), \\(0 \\notin [97, 108]\\).  \n  No collision.  \n  Action: U, so \\(y_{20} = 9\\).\n\n- **Turn 20**: Player at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.

The player moves up, down, or stays, and cars move left or right with their spans shifting based on speed.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn because I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player position changes at each turn based on the action. Let me denote the turn relative to t1=15. So at turn t=0 (which is t1=15), y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so y_{t1 + H} =9, but since we start at t=0 relative, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, we reach turn t1 + H.\n\nSet τ = t - t1, so τ=0 is turn 15, y=4.\n\nWe apply actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and at τ=H, we have y_H =9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway k=y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe span is defined for each car, and for a given turn, we need to check if 0 is in the span for any car on that row.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you check cars on that freeway at turn T. If you move vertically, you change freeways only at the next turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=4 to y=9 with minimal H.\n\nFirst, list the car states at τ=0 (turn 15).\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-3,-14, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at τ: [τ + s*τ? Let's see the update.\n\nGeneral car update: for a car, at turn t1, head h, tail τ (tail), direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (-3,-14, right, 3), but head and tail: for right-moving, head is larger, so h should be greater than τ.\n\nHere, -3 and -14, -3 > -14, so head is -3, tail is -14? But in the notation, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-3, -14, right, 3), so h = -3, τ = -14, d=right, s=3.\n\nSince right-moving, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-14 + 3(T-15), -3 + 3(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt1=15, so for any turn T, relative τ = T - 15.\n\nSet τ = T - t1 = T - 15.\n\nSo at time τ, turn is 15 + τ.\n\nPlayer position y_τ.\n\nCars:\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, h=-3, t_tail=-14, s=3\n\nSpan at τ: [ -14 + 3τ, -3 + 3τ ]  because τ = T - 15, so T-t1 = τ.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-3,-14,right,3), identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-3,-14,right,3), same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nFor (12,1,right,4): head=12, tail=1? 12>1, so for right-moving, span [tail + sτ, head + sτ] = [1 + 4τ, 12 + 4τ]\n\nSimilarly, (48,37,right,4): [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ]\n\n(-28,-39,right,4): head=-28, tail=-39, so [ -39 + 4τ, -28 + 4τ ]\n\nFreeway 5: (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\n(12,1,right,12): [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\n(60,49,right,12): [49 + 12τ, 60 + 12τ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll freeways from 5 to 8 have the same two cars? Freeway 5,6,7,8 all have (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nIn the table, freeway 5: (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nAnd freeway 1,2,3 have one car each: (-3,-14,right,3)\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at different τ.\n\nCollision occurs at turn τ if player is on freeway k at that turn, and for that k, there exists a car such that 0 is in its span at τ.\n\nFor freeway k, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each τ, whether it is occupied at x=0, i.e., if 0 is covered by any car span.\n\nSince the player is only at x=0, we care about when 0 is in the span.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span [ -14 + 3τ, -3 + 3τ ]\n\n0 in span if -14 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -3 + 3τ\n\nSo 3τ ≤ 3 and 3τ ≥ 14? Let's solve:\n\n-14 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -3 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -14 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 14 => τ ≤ 14/3 ≈ 4.666\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -3 + 3τ => 3τ ≥ 3 => τ ≥ 1\n\nSo for τ between 1 and 4.666, so τ=1,2,3,4 since τ integer.\n\nτ=1: -14+3= -11, -3+3=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included? 0 ≤ 0, yes.\n\nτ=1: lower = -14 + 3(1) = -14+3= -11, upper = -3 + 3(1) = 0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is in this interval.\n\nτ=2: -14+6= -8, -3+6=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: -14+9= -5, -3+9=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=4: -14+12= -2, -3+12=9, [ -2,9], 0 in.\n\nτ=5: -14+15=1, -3+15=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car, so occupied τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 3: same, occupied τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,4) span [1 + 4τ, 12 + 4τ]\n\n0 in [1+4τ, 12+4τ] only if 1+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12+4τ, but 1+4τ ≥1 for τ≥0, so 0 < 1+4τ, so 0 not in this interval ever, since min is 1 at τ=0.\n\nτ=0: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAs τ increases, it moves right, so always positive, 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,4) span [37+4τ, 48+4τ], always large positive, 0 never in.\n\nThird car: (-28,-39,right,4) span [ -39 +4τ, -28 +4τ]\n\n0 in if -39+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -28+4τ\n\nFirst: -39+4τ ≤ 0 => 4τ ≤ 39 => τ ≤ 39/4 = 9.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -28 +4τ => 4τ ≥ 28 => τ ≥ 7\n\nSo τ from 7 to 9.75, so τ=7,8,9\n\nτ=7: lower= -39+28= -11, upper= -28+28=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=8: -39+32= -7, -28+32=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=9: -39+36= -3, -28+36=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=10: -39+40=1, -28+40=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only the third car can cover 0, at τ=7,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\n0 in? 1+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12τ? But 1+12τ ≥1 >0 for τ≥0, so never.\n\nSecond car: [49+12τ, 60+12τ], always positive, never.\n\nSo for freeway 5, 0 is never occupied? But there are cars, but they never cover x=0?\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nAt τ=0, [1,12] and [49,60], both >0.\n\nAs τ increases, they move right, so x=0 never covered. Similarly for other τ.\n\nSo freeway 5 is always safe at x=0? But we need to check for all τ.\n\nYes, since min x is 1 for the first car, and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 all have the same, so x=0 never occupied for any τ.\n\nBut freeway 4 has occupation at τ=7,8,9.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 occupied at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny can be 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, safe.\n\nNow, player actions: at each turn τ, choose action U, D, or S, which changes y for next turn.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\ny must stay in [0,9], so cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at τ=H.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, and apply actions up to τ=H-1, to reach y_H at turn H.\n\nThe position at turn τ is y_τ.\n\nCollision at turn τ if y_τ between 1 and 8, and for freeway k=y_τ, 0 in span at that turn.\n\nNow, since freeway 5,6,7,8 are always safe, we can be on them at any time without collision.\n\nFreeway 4 is safe except at τ=7,8,9.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 are safe except at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nτ=1,2,3,4 are unsafe for y=1,2,3.\n\nτ=7,8,9 unsafe for y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 15, y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nIs it occupied? At τ=0, for freeway 4, we have spans: [1,12], [37,48], [-39,-28]? Earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, car1: [1,12], car2: [37,48], car3: [-39,-28]\n\nx=0 not in any, since [-39,-28] is negative, [1,12] positive, so safe.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are always safe, since freeways 5-8 never have cars at x=0.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=1,2,3 at τ=1,2,3,4, and avoid y=4 at τ=7,8,9.\n\ny=4 at τ=7,8,9 is unsafe.\n\nNow, start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nWe can choose actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut there might be constraints.\n\nFirst, from y=4, we can go up to y=5 immediately, but let's see the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the state at each τ.\n\nτ=0: y=4, safe as we saw.\n\nNow, action at τ=0 determines y_1.\n\nSimilarly, at each step.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps without considering cars: from y=4 to y=9, difference 5, so at least 5 up actions, but we can stay or go down, but minimal turns would be 5 turns if we go up each time.\n\nBut we might have to avoid some positions at certain times.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are always safe, and y=9 safe, the only risks are on y=1,2,3 and sometimes y=4.\n\nBut we start at y=4, and need to go up, so y=1,2,3 are below, we might not need to go there unless we go down, but going down might not help since we need to go to 9.\n\nProbably no need to go down, so we can stay at or above y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at τ=7,8,9.\n\nτ=7,8,9 are future times.\n\nNow, τ=0 is now.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we go up directly: start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1 depends.\n\nSuppose we go up at each step.\n\nAction sequence: U, U, U, U, U, then from y=4 to 5,6,7,8,9 in 5 steps.\n\nSo at τ=0: y=4\n\nAfter action U, τ=1: y=5\n\nτ=2: y=6\n\nτ=3: y=7\n\nτ=4: y=8\n\nτ=5: y=9\n\nNow, at τ=5, y=9, which is safe, goal reached.\n\nH=5, turns from τ=0 to τ=4 actions, 5 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0: apply action, then at τ=1, y is set.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn τ=H, y_H.\n\nHere, after 5 actions: actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4, then at τ=5, y=9.\n\nNow, check if any collision during the path.\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, freeway 4, τ=0, safe as above.\n\nτ=1: y=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 is always safe, so ok.\n\nτ=2: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nτ=3: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collision at all.\n\nAnd we reached in 5 turns.\n\nBut is that possible? What about the unsafe times?\n\nFor y=4, it was unsafe at τ=7,8,9, but here we were at y=4 only at τ=0, which is safe.\n\nAnd we moved up quickly.\n\ny=1,2,3 were not visited.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions at τ=1,2,3,4 for y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5 at τ=1: freeway 5, cars: at τ=1, for freeway 5, span car1: [1 + 12(1), 12+12(1)] = [13,24], not at 0.\n\nCar2: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], not at 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways same.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6, freeway 6: car1 [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], etc, all far from 0.\n\nSimilarly for τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nAnd at τ=5, y=9, safe.\n\nSo with 5 up actions, we can reach in 5 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at τ=5.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions, so sequence from t=0 to H-1, then at turn H, position is reached.\n\nIn this case, actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4 (5 actions), position at τ=5 is (0,9).\n\nMinimal H should be 5.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since 5 is minimal possible.\n\nBut let me check if at τ=0 we can stay or something, but going up is fine.\n\nPerhaps if we stay, we might be at y=4 at later τ, but since τ=0 is safe, and we can leave, no need.\n\nBut at τ=7,8,9 y=4 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nIn this path, we are at y=4 only at τ=0.\n\nNow, but let me see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions starting from turn t1=15.\n\nSo for turn 15: action at τ=0\n\nTurn 16: action at τ=1\n\netc.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn 15 (τ=0): action U\n\nThen y=5 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16 (τ=1): action U, y=6 at turn 17\n\nTurn 17 (τ=2): U, y=7 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18 (τ=3): U, y=8 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19 (τ=4): U, y=9 at turn 20\n\nAt turn 20, y=9, reached.\n\nH=5 turns? From turn 15 to turn 19 actions, 5 actions, reached at turn 20.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after that, at turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H\"\n\nIn the player update: after action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, apply action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nWith actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=15.\n\nSo with H=5, actions at t=15,16,17,18,19, all U, then at t=20, y=9.\n\nAnd no collisions, as checked.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 4 at τ=0 is safe, yes.\n\nBut let me double-check for freeway 4 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, cars: (12,1,right,4) span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\n(48,37,right,4) [37,48], not.\n\n(-28,-39,right,4) span [-39,-28], which is from -39 to -28, so x=0 not in, since -28 <0? -28 is less than 0, but the span is [ -39, -28], so numbers from -39 to -28, all negative, so 0 not in. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut why are freeways 1,2,3 occupied at τ=1,2,3,4? But we don't go there.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe at τ=7,8,9, not an issue.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut perhaps I should confirm if we can do in less.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, min 5 steps, since each action changes y by at most 1, so at least 5 up actions needed, so H min 5.\n\nAnd we achieved it, so should be fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 5-8 are safe, but we have to go through them.\n\nPerhaps there is a problem at some point.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=0, y=4, we apply U, so at τ=1, y=5.\n\nBut at τ=1, for freeway 1,2,3, they are occupied, but we are not on them, we are on y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps if we stayed at y=4, but at τ=0, it is safe, but if we stay, then at τ=1, y=4 still, but τ=1, is y=4 safe?\n\nAt τ=1, for freeway 4.\n\nτ=1, relative to t1=15, turn T=16.\n\nFreeway 4 at τ=1: car spans.\n\nCar1: [1+4(1), 12+4(1)] = [5,16]\n\nCar2: [37+4,48+4]=[41,52]\n\nCar3: [-39+4, -28+4] = [-35,-24]\n\nx=0 not in any, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2: car1 [1+8,12+8]=[9,20], car2 [45,56], car3 [-31,-20], 0 not in.\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=6: car3 [-39+24, -28+24] = [-15,-4], still negative, 0 not in.\n\nτ=7: car3 [-39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0], 0 is included? Upper is 0, so yes, 0 in [ -11, 0].\n\nSimilarly, τ=8: [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=9: [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nBut at τ=1,2,etc, for freeway 4, only car3 might be close, but at τ=1, [-35,-24], far left.\n\nτ=2: [-31,-20], still left.\n\n...\n\nτ=6: [-15,-4], -4 to -15, 0 not in.\n\nτ=7: [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nBut in our path, we are not at y=4 after τ=0.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, with five U actions, we can reach in H=5.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if we need to output for each turn.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nHere t1=15, H=5, so actions at turn 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any reason to do something else? For example, if we go slower, but no need.\n\nPerhaps at some point we have to wait, but here not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player cannot go above 9 or below 0, but here from 4 to 9, no issue.\n\ny=9 is the top, and we reach it.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are at y=8, we go U to y=9.\n\nAll fine.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car at (12,1,right,4), which at τ=0 is [1,12], and since we are at x=0, not covered, but if we were at x=12, but we are always at x=0, so only care about x=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,4) at turn 15.\n\nAnd cars, for example, freeway 1 at τ=1: occupied, but we avoid.\n\nSo output should be:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nThen at turn 20, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is for actions, and H=5.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut in the format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: & U \\end{array} } or something.\n\nBut since it's text, perhaps:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut let me confirm if H is correct.\n\nPerhaps I need to include the turn when we reach, but the sequence is actions up to H-1.\n\nAnother thing: in the collision rule, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars\", and in the dynamics, when you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until next turn.\n\nIn our case, for example, at turn τ=0 (turn 15), we are on y=4, apply U, then at turn τ=1 (turn 16), we are on y=5.\n\nAt turn 16, y=5, freeway 5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we had applied S at turn 15, then at turn 16, still y=4, and at τ=1, turn 16, y=4, freeway 4, which at τ=1 is safe, as [5,16], [41,52], [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut then we waste a turn.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up later, but no need.\n\nSo minimal is 5.\n\nPerhaps for y=4 at τ=0, it is safe, but if we stay, we can stay until τ=6, at τ=6, freeway 4 car3 span [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=7 unsafe.\n\nBut we don't need to stay.\n\nSo I think direct up is best.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3**: Each has one car with initial state \\((-3, -14, \\text{right}, 3)\\). The span at relative time \\(\\tau = T - 15\\) is \\([-14 + 3\\tau, -3 + 3\\tau]\\). This span contains 0 when \\(1 \\leq \\tau \\leq 4\\). Thus, freeways 1, 2, and 3 are occupied at \\(\\tau = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) (turns 16, 17, 18, 19).\n- **Freeway 4**: Has three cars:\n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span \\([1 + 4\\tau, 12 + 4\\tau]\\), never contains 0.\n  - \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span \\([37 + 4\\tau, 48 + 4\\tau]\\), never contains 0.\n  - \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span \\([-39 + 4\\tau, -28 + 4\\tau]\\), contains 0 when \\(7 \\leq \\tau \\leq 9\\) (turns 22, 23, 24).\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, 8**: Each has two cars:\n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Span \\([1 + 12\\tau, 12 + 12\\tau]\\), never contains 0.\n  - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\): Span \\([49 + 12\\tau, 60 + 12\\tau]\\), never contains 0.\n  Thus, freeways 5-8 are always safe at x=0 for all \\(\\tau\\).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\n- The minimal vertical distance from y=4 to y=9 is 5 units, requiring at least 5 \"U\" (up) actions, as each \"U\" increases y by 1.\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 15), the player is at (0, 4). Freeway 4 is safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 15), as no car span contains 0.\n- Moving up directly:\n  - At turn 15, apply \"U\": position at turn 16 is (0, 5).\n  - At turn 16, apply \"U\": position at turn 17 is (0, 6).\n  - At turn 17, apply \"U\": position at turn 18 is (0, 7).\n  - At turn 18, apply \"U\": position at turn 19 is (0, 8).\n  - At turn 19, apply \"U\": position at turn 20 is (0, 9).\n- Collision check:\n  - Turn 15 (y=4, \\(\\tau=0\\)): Freeway 4 safe (no car at x=0).\n  - Turn 16 (y=5, \\(\\tau=1\\)): Freeway 5 always safe.\n  - Turn 17 (y=6, \\(\\tau=2\\)): Freeway 6 always safe.\n  - Turn 18 (y=7, \\(\\tau=3\\)): Freeway 7 always safe.\n  - Turn 19 (y=8, \\(\\tau=4\\)): Freeway 8 always safe.\n  - Turn 20 (y=9): Not a freeway, safe.\n- This path achieves the goal in \\(H = 5\\) turns (actions from turn 15 to 19, position reached at turn 20).\n\n### Minimal Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 15 to 19 is all \"U\" (up), reaching (0, 9) at turn 20.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 16, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) at each turn. The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that turn, for the car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T during turn T, and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, we check the freeway y_T for collisions.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=16. For each car, we know its head, tail, direction, and speed. The update rule is:\n\nFor a left-moving car (but note: the table uses \"right\" for direction? Actually, the update rule is given for left and right. The direction in the table is given as \"right\", so we use the right-moving update:\n\nRight-moving: [τ, h] at t1, then at T (>= t1), the span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table lists for freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 3). How to interpret? Since it's right-moving, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning from τ to h (with τ < h). Then at T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (head, tail) = (0, -11) and direction right. So if we assume that the head is the front (rightmost for right-moving), then the span at t1=16 is [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. Then at time T, it becomes [-11 + 3*(T-16), 0 + 3*(T-16)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: \n  (16,5,right,4) -> span at t1: [5,16]? But wait: the problem says for right-moving: the span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h. However, the table says \"head\" and \"tail\". We need to interpret:\n\nIn the update rule, for right-moving: the car moves to the right, so the entire car shifts right. The span at t1 is [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. The problem says: \n  Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head should be the front (right) and tail the back (left). So the span at t1 is [tail, head]. For freeway 1: tail=-11, head=0 -> span [-11,0]. \n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: first car: head=16, tail=5 -> so the span is [5,16]? But wait, that would be from 5 to 16, which is 12 units long? Actually, the length of the car is |head - tail| + 1? But the problem doesn't specify the length, but we only care if 0 is in the span.\n\nHowever, note that for freeway 4, there are three cars: \n  (16,5,right,4) -> [5,16] at t1=16\n  (52,41,right,4) -> [41,52] at t1=16\n  (-24,-35,right,4) -> [-35,-24] at t1=16\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 to 8: \n  (24,13,right,12) -> [13,24] at t1=16\n  (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59,-48] at t1=16\n\nNow, we are to compute for each freeway and each car, the span at a future turn T (>=16) and check if 0 is in that span when the player is on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player starts at y=5 at turn 16. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn 16 (t1) for H turns until we reach y=9 at turn (16+H-1). So the last action is at turn (16+H-2) and then at turn (16+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at T contains 0.\n\nNote: at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways y=1..8). So if the player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision can occur.\n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9). So we must end at y=9. Also, we can use y=0 as a safe haven.\n\nThe player starts at y=5. The actions are U, D, S. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe need to find the minimal H and a sequence.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1: let t = 0,1,2,... corresponding to absolute turns 16,17,18,...\n\nSo at relative turn 0: y0 = 5.\n\nWe want the smallest H such that at relative turn H-1 (absolute turn 16+H-1) we have y_{H-1}=9.\n\nWe must avoid, for each relative turn i (0<=i<=H-2), if y_i is between 1 and 8, then we must check that at absolute turn t1+i (which is 16+i) the freeway y_i has no car that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNote: at the last turn (i=H-1) we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, let's compute the car spans at future turns. We are interested in when the car spans contain 0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, we compute for each absolute turn T (>=16) the span and check if 0 is in [A, B] (for a right-moving car: [τ + s*(T-16), h + s*(T-16)]).\n\nSo for a car (h, τ, right, s) at t1=16, the span at T is:\n   [τ + s*(T-16), h + s*(T-16)]\n\n0 is in the span if:\n   τ + s*(T-16) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-16)\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, but we don't have any left-moving in this instance.\n\nBut note: the table has only right-moving cars.\n\nNow, let's list the cars that could potentially have 0 in their span at some T>=16.\n\nWe can compute for each freeway and each car the time intervals (if any) when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=0, tail=-11, right, speed=3)\n   Span at T: [-11 + 3*(T-16), 0 + 3*(T-16)] = [3T-59, 3T-48]\n   Condition: 3T-59 <= 0 <= 3T-48\n   => 3T-59 <= 0 => T <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666 -> T<=19 (since T integer)\n       0 <= 3T-48 => 3T>=48 => T>=16\n   So T from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\n   Therefore, on freeway 1, the car covers 0 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n   The table says: freeway 2: (0, -11, right, 3) -> same as freeway 1: covers T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 3: same: covers T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n   Car1: (h=16, τ=5, right, s=4) -> span at T: [5+4*(T-16), 16+4*(T-16)] = [4T-59, 4T-48]\n       4T-59 <= 0 <= 4T-48\n       => 4T-59<=0 -> T<=59/4=14.75 -> T<=14 -> but T>=16 -> no solution? \n       0<=4T-48 -> 4T>=48 -> T>=12 -> but then T>=16 and T<=14 is impossible? \n       So this car never covers 0 at T>=16.\n\n   Car2: (52,41,right,4) -> [41+4*(T-16), 52+4*(T-16)] = [4T-23, 4T-12]\n       4T-23<=0<=4T-12 -> \n         4T-23<=0 -> T<=5.75 -> T<=5 -> but T>=16 -> no.\n       So never.\n\n   Car3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> [-35+4*(T-16), -24+4*(T-16)] = [4T-99, 4T-88]\n       4T-99<=0<=4T-88 -> \n         4T-99<=0 -> T<=24.75 -> T<=24\n         0<=4T-88 -> 4T>=88 -> T>=22\n       So T=22,23,24.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 4 is unsafe at T=22,23,24.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars, both with speed 12.\n   Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> [13+12*(T-16), 24+12*(T-16)] = [12T-179, 12T-168]\n       12T-179<=0<=12T-168 -> \n         12T-179<=0 -> T<=179/12≈14.916 -> T<=14 -> but T>=16 -> no.\n\n   Car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59+12*(T-16), -48+12*(T-16)] = [12T-251, 12T-240]\n       12T-251<=0<=12T-240 -> \n         12T-251<=0 -> T<=251/12≈20.916 -> T<=20\n         0<=12T-240 -> 12T>=240 -> T>=20\n       So only T=20.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 5 is unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5: unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 5: unsafe at T=20.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: T in {16,17,18,19}\ny=2: T in {16,17,18,19}\ny=3: T in {16,17,18,19}\ny=4: T in {22,23,24}\ny=5: T in {20}\ny=6: T in {20}\ny=7: T in {20}\ny=8: T in {20}\n\nWe are at turn 16 (T=16) at y=5. But at T=16, y=5 is unsafe? \n   Wait: at T=16, freeway 5 is unsafe? \n   But freeway 5: unsafe at T=20 only. So at T=16, freeway 5 is safe? \n   However, note that freeway 5 has two cars: one we saw doesn't cover 0 at T>=16, and the other only at T=20.\n\nBut what about the initial state? The problem says at turn t1 (16) we are at (0,5). We must check freeway 5 at T=16: \n   For freeway 5, car1: [13+12*(16-16), 24+12*0] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n        car2: [-59+12*0, -48+12*0] = [-59,-48] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo at T=16, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, freeway 1,2,3 are unsafe? But we are not on freeway 1,2,3 at T=16, we are on freeway 5, which is safe.\n\nSo we start at T=16, y=5: safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can move up or down or stay.\n\nWe want minimal H. The minimal number of moves to go from y=5 to y=9 is 4 moves up (U). But we have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSo let's consider moving up every turn:\n\nTurn 16 (T=16): start at y=5 (safe) -> action U -> then at turn 17 (T=17) we are at y=6.\n\nAt T=17: \n   Check freeway 6: unsafe at T=20 only -> safe at T=17.\n\nTurn 17: action U -> turn 18: y=7.\n   T=18: freeway 7: unsafe only at T=20 -> safe.\n\nTurn 18: action U -> turn 19: y=8.\n   T=19: freeway 8: unsafe only at T=20 -> safe.\n\nTurn 19: action U -> turn 20: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: at turn 20 (T=20), we are at y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), we are safe. However, note that we are at y=9 at turn 20. The action at turn 19 (U) causes us to be at y=8 at turn 19 and then we move to y=9 at turn 20. So at turn 19 we are at y=8. And at turn 19, freeway 8: is it unsafe? Our summary says freeway 8 is unsafe at T=20? But note: at turn 19, we are on freeway 8. And we have to check freeway 8 at T=19: \n   For freeway 8: unsafe times are only T=20. So at T=19, freeway 8 is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence: \n   Turn 16: U -> y=6 at T=17? Actually, after the action at turn 16, we update: \n        y_{17} = y_{16} + (if U: +1) -> 5+1=6 at the next state (which is at the beginning of turn 17).\n\nBut the collision check at turn 16: we are at y=5 (freeway 5) at T=16 -> safe.\nAt turn 17: we are at y=6 (freeway 6) at T=17 -> safe (since freeway 6 unsafe only at T=20).\nAt turn 18: y=7 (freeway 7) at T=18 -> safe.\nAt turn 19: y=8 (freeway 8) at T=19 -> safe.\nAt turn 20: we start at y=8 and then we apply U to get to y=9? But wait, we are at turn 20: we start at y=8, then we do U to get to y=9 at the next state? But then we haven't reached y=9 at turn 20? We reach y=9 at turn 21? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAt the beginning of turn 16: we are at (0,5).\nWe take action a_{16}: U -> then at the beginning of turn 17, we are at (0,6).\n\nSimilarly:\n  turn 17: U -> at turn 18: (0,7)\n  turn 18: U -> at turn 19: (0,8)\n  turn 19: U -> at turn 20: (0,9)\n\nSo at turn 20, we are at (0,9). We are done at the beginning of turn 20.\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn 19. The total turns H: we start at turn 16 and we have actions at turns 16,17,18,19 (4 actions) and we are at (0,9) at turn 20. So the sequence covers 4 actions and the state at turn 20 is the goal.\n\nNow, we must check if we are safe at every step:\n\nAt turn 16 (T=16): we are at y=5 -> freeway 5: safe (as above).\nAt turn 17 (T=17): we are at y=6 -> freeway 6: unsafe only at T=20 -> safe.\nAt turn 18 (T=18): y=7 -> freeway 7: unsafe at T=20 -> safe.\nAt turn 19 (T=19): y=8 -> freeway 8: unsafe at T=20 -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn 20, we are at y=9 (safe).\n\nSo H=4? But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". \n\nHere, we have actions at t1+0, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3 (which are turns 16,17,18,19) and then at turn t1+4 (20) we are at 9. So H=5? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions. And then at the state after the last action (which is at turn t1+H) we should be at 9.\n\nBut note: the player update: after an action at turn t, we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo we start at turn t1 (16) at (0,5). Then we take H actions: at turns 16, 17, ..., 16+H-1. Then the state at turn 16+H is (0,9).\n\nSo the minimal H to go from 5 to 9 is 4 actions? Because we need to move up 4 times. Then the state at turn 16+4=20 is (0,9). So H=4.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so 4 actions: at 16,17,18,19.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut is there a problem at T=20? We are at y=9 at turn 20, so we don't check freeway at turn 20 for collision because we are at y=9 (safe). And during the actions we were safe.\n\nHowever, note that at turn 20 we are already at the goal, so we don't take any action at turn 20.\n\nBut what about the unsafe freeway 5 at T=20? We are not on freeway 5 at T=20, we are at y=9.\n\nSo this sequence works.\n\nBut wait: is there a shorter path? The minimal number of moves is 4 (since we need to go from 5 to 9: 4 steps up). So H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We cannot because we are at 5 and we need to get to 9: we must go up 4 times.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times again to make sure we are safe at the steps.\n\nAt step 0 (absolute T=16): we are at y=5 -> freeway 5: \n   car1: [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n   car2: [-59,-48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt step 1 (T=17): y=6 -> freeway 6: \n   The unsafe time for freeway 6 is only T=20. So at T=17, we check:\n        car1: [13+12*(17-16), 24+12*1] = [13+12,24+12] = [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [-59+12*1, -48+12*1] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt step 2 (T=18): y=7 -> freeway 7: \n        car1: [13+12*2,24+12*2] = [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt step 3 (T=19): y=8 -> freeway 8:\n        car1: [13+12*3,24+12*3] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAnd then at T=20: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo yes, the sequence of 4 Ups works.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if we move to a different freeway at turn T, we are still on the old freeway at turn T. So when we move from y=5 to y=6 at turn 16, at turn 16 we are still on freeway 5. Then at the beginning of turn 17 we are on freeway 6.\n\nTherefore, the above checks are correct.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go faster? We can't. We have to go up 4 times.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up 3 times and then wait? But that would take more than 4 turns. Or go down? That would be worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut note: what if we get stuck because of the unsafe times? In this case, we didn't.\n\nBut what about the unsafe times at freeway 4? We never go to freeway 4, so we don't care.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut let me write in the required format.\n\nThe absolute turn numbers: \n   Turn 16: a_{16} = U\n   Turn 17: a_{17} = U\n   Turn 18: a_{18} = U\n   Turn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nWe have H=4, so the sequence is for t=0 to 3 (relative).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", which is a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}.\n\nSo the boxed answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are to output starting at t1. So that's correct.\n\nHowever, I see that the initial state has freeways 1,2,3 unsafe at T=16 to 19. But we are not on those. And we are moving from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8, which are freeways 5,6,7,8. And we've checked that at the times we are on them, they are safe.\n\nOne more thing: what if we consider that at T=20, freeway 5 is unsafe? But we are not on freeway 5 at T=20, we are at y=9.\n\nSo everything is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we do an action that causes us to be at y=5 at T=20? Then we would be unsafe. But we are not doing that.\n\nSo the above sequence is safe and minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if we can do it in 4 moves without going through any unsafe freeway? We did.\n\nAlternatively, if we tried to go up only 3 times and then wait one turn? Then we would take 5 moves: \n   U,U,U,S -> then at turn 20 we are at y=8? Then we need another U at turn 20 to get to y=9 at turn 21. Then H=5, which is worse.\n\nOr if we go down? That would be even worse.\n\nSo indeed 4 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) is 4. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving directly upward through freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) at turns 17, 18, and 19, respectively, which are safe at those times. The car configurations and unsafe times are as follows:\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at turns 22, 23, 24 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe at turn 20 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at turn 20 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at turn 20 (car span covers 0).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turn 20 (car span covers 0).\n\nThe sequence is:\n- At turn 16: Start at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5), which is safe at turn 16. Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17: Position \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), safe at turn 17 (unsafe only at turn 20). Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18: Position \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7), safe at turn 18 (unsafe only at turn 20). Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19: Position \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8), safe at turn 19 (unsafe only at turn 20). Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20, reaching the goal safely (no freeway at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThe actions are taken at turns 16, 17, 18, and 19, and the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20. No shorter sequence is possible, as moving from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least four upward moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 17, and I start at y=6.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with a constant speed, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, no car on that row has a span that includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position is always x=0, so we only care about the y-coordinate changing. The grid is vertical from y=0 to y=9, but y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something? The freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones or something. The goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9 is the target.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs only if for the freeway y_T at turn T, 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway. And importantly, when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so I only care about the car on the current row at the current turn.\n\nAlso, for moving, if I do U, y increases by 1; D, y decreases by 1; S, stay same. And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t_1 = 17.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. But in the update, left-moving has span [h, τ] moving left, so decreasing x; right-moving has span [τ, h] moving right, increasing x? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: at turn t_1, span [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: at t_1, [τ, h], at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, head is the right end? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and span [h, τ], with h > τ I assume since it's moving left? Not necessarily, but usually head is front.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, span becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so both ends decrease, meaning head is at higher x initially? I think I need to clarify.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is the leading end.\n\nFor a car moving left, the head is the front, which is at higher x, and tail at lower x. So span [head, tail] with head > tail for left-moving? But [head, tail] might imply head < tail if it's an interval.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: \"left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nThen at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, if we assume x decreases, then h - sΔT < h, so h must be the right end? But [h, τ] with h decreasing, so if h is larger, τ smaller, then [h, τ] with h > τ? But intervals are usually [min, max].\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so if moving right, τ and h increase, so τ + sΔT > τ, so τ must be the left end, h the right end? But [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nI think it's better to interpret the span as the set of x-coordinates covered, from min to max.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, min x is τ, max x is h, with τ < h? But the notation says [h, τ], which might be [max, min] or something.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nNow, if the car is moving left, the entire span shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSo at T, the min x is min( h - sΔT, τ - sΔT ), but since it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], this implies that at t_1, h is the higher value, τ is lower, so [high, low], which is decreasing, but in interval notation, it's usually [low, high].\n\nThis is messy.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so if moving right, τ is low, h is high, so [low, high] increasing.\n\nFor left-moving, it's given as [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume, so [high, low], which is not standard.\n\nBut for collision, we care if 0 is in the interval [min, max].\n\nSo for a left-moving car at turn T, min x = min( h - sΔT, τ - sΔT ) = τ - sΔT since τ < h? Not necessarily.\n\nAssume that for left-moving, head h is the front when moving left, so for left-moving, h is larger x, τ is smaller x, so span [τ, h] at t_1, but it says [h, τ], which might be a typo or misnomer.\n\nLook at the car state: for freeway 1: (3, -8, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nHere head=3, tail=-8, direction right.\n\nAt t_1=17, span is [τ, h] = [-8, 3]? But it says (head, tail) = (3, -8), and direction right.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nWith τ = tail? In the state it's \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, tail should be the left end, head the right end.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and for direction, it specifies the movement.\n\nFor this car, head=3, tail=-8, direction right, so since moving right, head is the front, so at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nSo at t_1, min x = tail = -8, max x = head = 3, so span [-8, 3].\n\nThen at T, span [ -8 + s(T-t_1), 3 + s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if direction left, head is the front when moving left, so head at higher x, tail at lower x, but moving left, so at T, [head - sΔT, tail - sΔT], so min x = tail - sΔT, max x = head - sΔT.\n\nBut in the span notation, for left-moving, it says [h, τ] which is [head, tail], but with head > tail, so [high, low], so the interval is from high to low, which is fine, but for collision, we care if 0 is between min and max, which is tail and head for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, min and max are tail and head.\n\nIn general, for any car, at time T, the min x and max x can be found.\n\nFor collision, on freeway k at turn T, if there is a car with min_x(T) <= 0 <= max_x(T), then collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there are multiple cars, so I need to check all cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, the player is at x=0 always, so only y matters.\n\nGoal: from y=6 at t=17, reach y=9 at some turn T, with H = T - 17 + 1 or something? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence starts from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, position at turn t_1 + t is y_{t_1 + t}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nInitial position is at turn t_1, (0, y_t1) = (0,6), so after H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn t_1, we need to be at y=9, but we are at y=6, so we need to move.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we take actions, and at the end of turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe position after action at turn t is y_{t+1}, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is the new position.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are at position y_T, and we check if on freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nAt the start, turn t_1=17, we are at y=6, so at turn 17, we are on freeway 6, and we need to check if there is collision at turn 17 on y=6.\n\nThen we take action a_17, which determines y_18, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action at turn t, we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn t, when we are at y_t, we check the cars on row y_t at that turn t.\n\nAlso, when we move, at turn t, we are on y_t, take action, go to y_{t+1}, and at turn t+1, we are on y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nNow, the target is to have y_T = 9 for some T, and we want minimal T - 17 or H.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so the turn when we reach y=9 is t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo we need to find min H such that we can have y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nSince we start at t_1=17, let's set t_rel = t - 17, so relative turn.\n\nAt relative turn 0, t=17, y=6.\n\nWe take actions a_{17} to a_{17 + H -1}, and at turn 17 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if we go directly up, from y=6 to y=9, we need 3 up actions, so H=3, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars on rows 7 and 8 if we go through them.\n\ny=6,7,8 are freeways, y=9 is the goal, probably safe.\n\ny=0 to y=9, freeways 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might not have cars, so safe.\n\nBut at turn when we are on y=9, we need to be there, but since no freeway, no collision, I think.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSo when we reach y=9, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars at t_1=17 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=3, tail=-8, direction=right, speed=3)\n\nSince direction right, span at t: [tail + s(t-17), head + s(t-17)] = [-8 + 3(t-17), 3 + 3(t-17)]\n\nFor collision on freeway 1 at turn t, if 0 in [ -8 + 3(t-17), 3 + 3(t-17) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (3, -8, right, 3) identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: | 2 | (3, -8, right, 3) | so same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: | 3 | (3, -8, right, 3) | also same.\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 each have one car with same parameters: head=3, tail=-8, right, speed=3.\n\nSo for each, span at t: [ -8 + 3(t-17), 3 + 3(t-17) ]\n\n0 in span when min <=0<= max, so -8 + 3(t-17) <= 0 <= 3 + 3(t-17)\n\nLeft: -8 + 3(t-17) <=0 => 3(t-17) <=8 => t-17 <= 8/3 ≈ 2.666, so t-17 <=2 since t integer? t-17 <= floor(8/3)=2? Let's keep inequality.\n\n-8 + 3(Δt) <=0 => 3Δt <=8 => Δt <= 8/3 ≈2.666\n\nRight: 0 <= 3 + 3(Δt) => -3 <= 3(Δt) always true since Δt >=0.\n\n0 <= 3 + 3(Δt) is always true for Δt >=0.\n\nSo collision when -8 + 3(Δt) <=0 and 0 <= 3 + 3(Δt), which simplifies to -8 + 3(Δt) <=0, since the right is always true.\n\n0 <= 3 + 3(Δt) is true, so only when min <=0, i.e., -8 + 3(Δt) <=0, so 3(Δt) <=8, Δt <= 2.666, so for integer Δt, Δt <=2.\n\nΔt = t - 17, so at t=17,18,19? t=17: Δt=0, min=-8 <=0<=3, yes 0 in [-8,3]\n\nt=18: Δt=1, min= -8+3= -5 <=0<=3+3=6, yes\n\nt=19: Δt=2, min= -8+6= -2 <=0<=3+6=9, yes\n\nt=20: Δt=3, min= -8+9=1 >0, so min=1>0, max=12, 0 not in [1,12], so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for t<17, but we start at t=17.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at t=17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same thing.\n\nNow freeway 4: multiple cars: (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nDirection all right, so for each, span at t: for a car with head h, tail τ, right, span at t: [τ + s(t-17), h + s(t-17)]\n\nFirst car: head=20, tail=9? (20,9,right,4), but head=20, tail=9, since moving right, tail should be left, head right, so tail=9, head=20, so min=9, max=20 at t=17.\n\nSpan at t: [9 + 4(Δt), 20 + 4(Δt)] where Δt=t-17.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (56,45,right,4), so tail=45, head=56, span [45 +4(Δt), 56 +4(Δt)]\n\nThird car: (-20,-31,right,4), tail=-31, head=-20, span [-31 +4(Δt), -20 +4(Δt)]\n\nNow for freeway 4 at turn t, collision if 0 in any of these spans.\n\nFirst span: [9+4Δt, 20+4Δt], min=9+4Δt >=9>0 for Δt>=0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSecond span: [45+4Δt,56+4Δt] min=45>0, always >0, 0 not in.\n\nThird span: [-31+4Δt, -20+4Δt], min=-31+4Δt, max=-20+4Δt.\n\n0 in span if min <=0<= max, so -31+4Δt <=0 and 0<= -20+4Δt\n\nFirst: -31+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=31 => Δt <=31/4=7.75, so Δt<=7\n\nSecond: 0<= -20+4Δt => 20<=4Δt => Δt >=5\n\nSo for Δt from 5 to 7 inclusive, 0 in this span.\n\nΔt=5, min=-31+20= -11, max=-20+20=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? min<=0<=max, -11<=0<=0, yes 0<=0 is true.\n\nSimilarly Δt=6, min=-31+24= -7, max=-20+24=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=7, min=-31+28= -3, max=-20+28=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=4: min=-31+16= -15, max=-20+16= -4, [-15,-4], min<0 but max=-4<0, so 0 not in.\n\nΔt=8: min=-31+32=1, max=-20+32=12, [1,12], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 4, collision when Δt=5,6,7, i.e., t=22,23,24.\n\nt=17+5=22, 17+6=23,17+7=24.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nBoth right direction.\n\nFirst car: head=36, tail=25, span at t: [25 +12(Δt), 36+12(Δt)] min=25+12Δt >=25>0, always >0, 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12), tail=-47, head=-36, span [-47 +12(Δt), -36 +12(Δt)]\n\n0 in if min <=0<=max\n\n-47+12Δt <=0 and 0<= -36+12Δt\n\nFirst: -47+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/12≈3.916, so Δt<=3\n\nSecond: 0<= -36+12Δt => 36<=12Δt => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt=3 only.\n\nΔt=3: min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=2: min=-47+24= -23, max=-36+24= -12, [-23,-12], max<0, 0 not in.\n\nΔt=4: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on freeway 5 only at t=17+3=20? Δt=3, t=20.\n\nt=17+3=20.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as 5? |6| (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) | identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo collision only at t=20.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: |7| same: (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) | so same as 5 and 6.\n\nCollision at t=20.\n\nFreeway 8: |8| same: (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) | so all freeways 5,6,7,8 have identical cars and collision only at t=20.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 each have two cars, but the second one causes collision at t=20, first one never.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 have collision at t=17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 4 has collision at t=22,23,24.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have collision only at t=20.\n\nt=20 for all 5-8.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nStart at t=17, y=6.\n\nAt t=17, we are on y=6, which is freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars, and at t=17, is there collision?\n\nFor freeway 6 at t=17: Δt=0, cars: (36,25,right,12) span [25,36] min=25>0, 0 not in.\n\n(-36,-47,right,12) span [-47,-36] min=-47<0, max=-36<0, so 0 not in [-47,-36] since max<0.\n\nSo no collision at t=17 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we are on y=6.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nPossible paths: we can go up directly, or down to y=0 and then up, but y=0 is safe, but going down might take more turns, probably not minimal since H min is at least 3.\n\ny from 6 to 9, difference 3, so min H=3 if no obstacles.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt each turn, when on a freeway, must not collide.\n\nAlso, we can stay or move down, but moving down might not help.\n\nNow, let's see the collision times for each row.\n\nSince we move one row per turn if we go up, but we can stay or move down, but to minimize H, probably go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when it has collision.\n\nSo let's list for each row, the turns when it is unsafe, i.e., collision possible.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at t=17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): same, unsafe t=17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): unsafe t=17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): unsafe t=22,23,24\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): unsafe only at t=20? For y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: collision at t=20, as above.\n\nSimilarly y=6: freeway 6, collision at t=20\n\ny=7: freeway 7, collision at t=20\n\ny=8: freeway 8, collision at t=20\n\nAnd y=4 unsafe at t=22,23,24\n\nNow, we start at t=17, y=6.\n\nAt t=17, y=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nMinimal T, so H = T - 16? Turn t_1 + H -1 = T.\n\nt_1=17, so T = 17 + H -1 = 16 + H.\n\ny at T is 9.\n\nNow, to go from y=6 to y=9, we need to increase y by 3, so at least 3 up actions.\n\nBut we might need to wait or something.\n\nSince we can move down or stay, but that would increase H, so for min H, probably no down or stay, only up if possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's consider the path directly up.\n\nAt t=17, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nWe take action: if we go up, a_17=U, then y_18 =7.\n\nAt turn t=18, we are on y=18? Position at turn t: y_t.\n\nAt turn t=17, y=6.\n\nAfter action a_17, y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17.\n\nAt turn t=18, position y_18.\n\nIf a_17=U, y_18=7.\n\nThen at turn t=18, we are on y=7.\n\nNow, y=7 is freeway 7, which has collision at t=20 only? t=20 is unsafe.\n\nBut t=18, is it safe?\n\nFor freeway 7 at t=18: Δt = t-17=1.\n\nCars: (36,25,right,12), span at t: [25 +12(Δt), 36+12(Δt)] at Δt=1, [25+12=37, 36+12=48], min=37>0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12), span [-47 +12(Δt), -36 +12(Δt)] at Δt=1, [-47+12= -35, -36+12= -24], min=-35<0, max=-24<0, so 0 not in [-35,-24].\n\nThus at t=18, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up again, a_18=U, y_19=8.\n\nAt turn t=19, on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=19: Δt=2.\n\nCars: first, [25+12*2=25+24=49, 36+24=60], min=49>0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond: [-47+24= -23, -36+24= -12], min=-23<0, max=-12<0, 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a_19=U, y_20=9.\n\nAt turn t=20, position y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached y=9.\n\nt=20, which is turn t_1 + H -1 =17 + H -1 =20, so 16 + H =20, H=4.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, 17 + H -1=20, 16+H=20, H=4.\n\nActions from t=17 to t=20? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t=17, we start at y=6.\n\nAction a_17: if U, then y_18=7.\n\nAt turn t=18, we are on y=7, take action a_18, etc.\n\nAfter action at t=19, y_20=9.\n\nAt turn t=20, we are at y=20? Position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t=17, y_17=6.\n\nAfter action a_17, y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17.\n\nSo at turn t=18, position y_18.\n\nSimilarly, after a_18, y_19, and after a_19, y_20.\n\nWe need y_20 =9 for some action sequence.\n\nIn this case: a_17=U, y_18=7\n\na_18=U, y_19=8\n\na_19=U, y_20=9\n\nNow, at each turn, we need to check collision.\n\nAt turn t=17: on y=6, which we said safe.\n\nt=18: on y=7, safe as above.\n\nt=19: on y=8, safe.\n\nt=20: on y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reached at t=20.\n\nBut t=20 is when we are on y=9.\n\nIn terms of H, we took actions at t=17,18,19, so three actions, H=3? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=3, actions at t=17,18,19, and at turn t=19 + something.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =17 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken at turn t, determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_t for t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after action at t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} = position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, and we take action a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nFor collision, at each turn t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when we are at position y_t, we check if on freeway y_t, there is collision at turn t.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 at turn T, we take actions from t_1 to T-1, so H = T - t_1 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is t_1 to T-1, so H = T - t_1.\n\nThen at turn T, we are at y_T=9.\n\nFor collision, we care about turns from t=t_1 to T-1, since at turn T, y_T=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nNow in our case, t_1=17, start y=6.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 at T=20, with H=3 actions at t=17,18,19.\n\nThen at turns t=17,18,19, we are on y_t, need no collision.\n\nt=17: y=6, safe.\n\nt=18: y=7, safe.\n\nt=19: y=8, safe.\n\nt=20: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 6 at t=20 unsafe, but in this path, at t=20, we are on y=9, not on freeway 6, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nIn this sequence, we are not on any row at t=20 except y=9.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in H=3.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t_1=17: at y=6, take a_17=U, then y_18=7\n\nTurn 18: at y=7, take a_18=U, y_19=8\n\nTurn 19: at y=8, take a_19=U, y_20=9\n\nAt turn 20, y=9.\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nAt turn 17: on y=6, as before, no collision.\n\nAt turn 18: on y=7, Δt=1, cars: for y=7, freeway 7.\n\nCars: (36,25,right,12), at t=18, Δt=1, span [25+12*1=37, 36+12=48], 0 not in.\n\n(-36,-47,right,12), span [-47+12= -35, -36+12= -24], both negative, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAt turn 19: on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nΔt=2, cars: (36,25,right,12) span [25+24=49,36+24=60], >0\n\n(-36,-47,right,12) span [-47+24= -23, -36+24= -12], [-23,-12], max=-12<0, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nNo collision at any point.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut is there a way with H=2? That would mean reaching at t=19.\n\nWith two actions: from y=6 to y=9 in two steps? Only if we go up twice, but y increases by at most 1 per action, so from 6 to 9, min three actions: to 7,8,9.\n\nWith two actions, we can go to at most y=8, e.g., U,U to y=8 at t=19? Let's see.\n\nIf a_17=U, y_18=7\n\na_18=U, y_19=8\n\nThen at t=19, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=19, we need y_19=9.\n\ny_19 depends on actions at t=17 and t=18.\n\ny_19 = y_17 + Δy_17 + Δy_18\n\ny_17=6, so y_19=6 + Δy_17 + Δy_18\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so max y_19=8 if both U, min=4 if both D.\n\nCannot reach 9 in two steps from 6. Since 6+1+1=8<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach in H=2 actions.\n\nH=3 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we have a sequence that works.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we have a sequence.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 4, it has cars, but we didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut let me double-check if at t=19 on y=8 is safe.\n\nt=19, Δt=2, freeway 8: second car span [-47+24= -23, -36+24= -12] = [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at t=20, if we were on y=8, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn our sequence, at t=20 we are on y=9.\n\nBut just to note, at t=20, freeway 8: for the second car, Δt=3, min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included, so collision if on y=8 at t=20.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSimilarly for other rows at t=20.\n\nBut in our path, no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but impossible.\n\nOr slower, but H=3 is min.\n\nBut the player might go down to avoid something, but in this case no need.\n\nFor example, if at some point we had to be on a row when unsafe, but here not.\n\nAnother thing: at t=17, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nBut suppose we stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 directly, but no, we have to move step by step.\n\nSo I think H=3 is achievable.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut let me see if there is any issue with other rows.\n\nFor example, when we go to y=7 at t=18, is y=7 safe? Yes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the unsafe times again.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at t=17,18,19\n\nBut we are not there.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=22,23,24, not relevant.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, unsafe only at t=20.\n\nSimilarly y=6 unsafe at t=20, y=7 at t=20, y=8 at t=20.\n\nIn our path, at t=20, we are on y=9, not on any y=5,6,7,8, so fine.\n\nIf we were on y=8 at t=20, it would be bad, but we are on y=8 at t=19, which is safe.\n\nt=19 for y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can consider going down to y=5 or something, but that would take more turns, not better.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=5 at some point, but y=5 is unsafe at t=20, and we need to go up, so likely more actions.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 3, with actions U,U,U at t=17,18,19.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 4, but we didn't use it.\n\nPerhaps I should write the actions.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=3.\n\nBut is there a reason to have H larger? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps if we start by staying or something, but that increases H.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 we stay, y=6, then at t=18, we are still on y=6, but t=18 for y=6: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 at t=18: Δt=1, cars: (36,25,right,12) span [25+12=37,36+12=48] >0\n\n(-36,-47,right,12) span [-47+12= -35, -36+12= -24] <0, so safe.\n\nThen we can go up, but it takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo min H=3.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 4, there is a car that could be issue, but we avoid it.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at turn t, we are on y_t, and we take action to go to y_{t+1}, and at that instant, we are not on the next row until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for row y=8 at t=19, but we already checked.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nAt turn t_1=17: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1=18: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2=19: U\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9.\n\nH=3.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the sequence is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is t=17,18,19 for H=3.\n\nActions: a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19} all U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if we need to specify H, but the answer should include the sequence.\n\nPerhaps write:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nAnd H=3, but since the sequence has H actions, it's implied.\n\nIn the format, it says \"determine H and a sequence\", but in the box, probably just the sequence with turns.\n\nRead the answer format.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo we list the actions for the turns.\n\nAnd since H=3, there are three actions.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at t=19 on y=8 is indeed safe.\n\nt=19, relative to t_1=17, Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 8: cars as above.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12), head=36, tail=25, direction right, so span at t: [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)] = [25 + 12*2, 36 + 12*2] = [25+24=49, 36+24=60], both >0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12), head=-36, tail=-47, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = -36, span [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)] = [-47 + 12*2, -36 + 12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12], both negative, so 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we consider the direction: moving right, so at t=19, positions.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) is 3, achieved by moving up (U) at each turn.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn \\(t = 17\\) (position \\(y = 6\\)):**  \n  Freeway 6 has cars: \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\) and \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 12)\\).  \n  - Span for first car: \\([25 + 12 \\times 0, 36 + 12 \\times 0] = [25, 36]\\) (min > 0, 0 not in span).  \n  - Span for second car: \\([-47 + 12 \\times 0, -36 + 12 \\times 0] = [-47, -36]\\) (max < 0, 0 not in span).  \n  No collision.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 7) at turn t_1 = 18. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that moves the player vertically from y=7 to y=9.\n\nThe player moves only vertically; the x-coordinate is always 0 since it's a vertical axis. Collisions happen if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=18, and they move left or right with constant speed. I need to compute where the cars are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their states at t_1=18:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head=6, tail=-5, direction=right, speed=3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-5, 6]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, the position increases.\n\nThe car update for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\", so all cars are moving to the right.\n\nFreeway 1: (6, -5, right, 3) → span at t_1: [-5, 6]\n\nFreeway 2: same, (6, -5, right, 3) → [-5, 6]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (6, -5, right, 3) → [-5, 6]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nFor the first car: head=24, tail=13? But for right-moving, it should be [tail, head]? I think I have a confusion.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in this case, all directions are \"right\", so for each car, the span is [tail, head] at t_1.\n\nFor freeway 4, first car: head=24, tail=13, so [13, 24] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=60, tail=49, so [49,60]\n\nThird car: head=-16, tail=-27? head and tail, with direction.\n\ntail τ = -27, head h = -16, so since right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-27, -16]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: each has two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor (48,37,right,12): head=48, tail=37, span [37,48]\n\nFor (-24,-35,right,12): head=-24, tail=-35, span [-35,-24]\n\nAnd speed 12 for all on freeways 5-8.\n\nNow, the player is at y=7 at t=18.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is the top, I assume y=9 is the goal, no cars there since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=9 might be safe, no freeway.\n\nSimilarly y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=7 to y=9.\n\nActions: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny is between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns, since we start at turn t=18, and after H actions, at turn t=18 + H - 1, we should be at y=9.\n\nLet’s denote the turn index.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nFrom the player update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1, we choose a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}, then at t_1+1, choose a_{t_1+1}, sets y_{t_1+2}, and so on, until at some turn, y =9.\n\nThe position after H actions: we start at turn T= t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H-1.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y_{t_1} =7, we need to increase by 2 to reach 9.\n\nSo the minimal H should be at least 2, if we can go up twice directly.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when we are at position y_T, we must not collide with cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T.\n\nWhen we choose action a_T at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at turn T, we are on y_T, so we check collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAfter moving, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and we check for collision on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe movement happens at the end of the turn or something? I think it's clear: position at turn T is y_T, so collision check is based on that.\n\nNow, for us, at t_1=18, y=7, so we are on freeway 7 at turn 18.\n\nWe need to check if there is a collision at turn 18 on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt turn T=18, span for first car: [37 + 12*(18-18), 48 + 12*0] = [37,48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: [-35 +0, -24 +0] = [-35,-24]\n\nNow, player is at x=0, so we need to see if 0 is in any span for freeway y=7.\n\n0 is not in [37,48], not in [-35,-24], so no collision at turn 18.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe, but we are going up.\n\nTo go from y=7 to y=9, we need to increase y by 2.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, we should go up as fast as possible, unless blocked.\n\nBut let's see the cars on the way.\n\nThe player must pass through y=8 to reach y=9, or directly? From y=7, we can go to y=8, then to y=9.\n\ny=8 is a freeway with cars.\n\nFirst, let's consider going directly up.\n\nAt turn 18, position y=7.\n\nChoose action a_{18}: if U, then y_{19} = 7+1 =8\n\nThen at turn 19, we are on y=8.\n\nWe need to check collision at turn 19 on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S, y_{19}=7, still on 7, or D, y_{19}=6, on 6.\n\nBut to reach 9, we need to go up.\n\nMinimal H: if we can go U at turn 18 to y=8 at turn 19, then U at turn 19 to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nThen H=2 actions, at turns 18 and 19, position at turn 20 is 9.\n\nNow, check if this is possible without collision.\n\nAt turn 18: we are on y=7, no collision as above.\n\nAfter action a_{18}, at turn 19, position y_{19}.\n\nIf a_{18}=U, y_{19}=8.\n\nAt turn 19, we are on y=8, so check cars on freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: same as freeway 7, since all 5-8 have same cars? No.\n\nFreeway 8: | 8 | (48,37,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) |\n\nAt turn t_1=18, span: [37,48] and [-35,-24] for both freeways, but different freeways.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nFirst, car positions at turn T.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving, since t_1=18.\n\ns is speed.\n\nFor freeway 8, cars:\n\nFirst car: τ=37, h=48, s=12, direction right.\n\nAt turn T, span: [37 + 12*(T-18), 48 + 12*(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, span: [-35 + 12*(T-18), -24 + 12*(T-18)]\n\nAt turn T=19:\n\nT-18=1\n\nFirst car span: [37 + 12*1, 48 + 12*1] = [37+12, 48+12] = [49, 60]\n\nSecond car span: [-35 + 12, -24 + 12] = [-23, -12]\n\nPlayer at x=0 on freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nIs 0 in [49,60]? No. In [-23,-12]? No, -12 to -23, 0 not in there. So safe.\n\nThen, at turn 19, if we do U, y_{20} =8+1=9.\n\nAt turn 20, we are on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nSo with two actions: a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, we reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut is that all? We need to check if at any point there is collision.\n\nAt turn 18, on y=7: cars on freeway 7 at T=18.\n\nFreeway 7: same as above, at T=18, spans [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 19, on y=8: as above, at T=19, spans [49,60] and [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 2 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check the cars on other freeways, but collision only happens on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 19, we are on y=8, so only check cars on freeway 8, not others.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 18, only freeway 7.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,9) at turn 20.\n\nNow, but let me see if there are any issues.\n\nFreeway 4 has multiple cars, but we don't go there.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1,2,3 have cars, but we are not on them.\n\nIn this path, we only touch y=7 and y=8, both safe at the times.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nAt turn 18, freeway 7: cars at [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 19, freeway 8: at T=19, T-18=1, so [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the initial position? Player at (0,7) at turn 18, which we checked.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait or something, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, maybe for completeness.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=18, car [ -5 +3*0, 6+3*0] = [-5,6], for right-moving, span [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] with τ=-5, h=6, s=3.\n\nAt T=18, dt=0, [-5,6], 0 is in [-5,6]? -5 to 6, yes, 0 is between -5 and 6.\n\nOh! On freeway 1 at turn 18, if player were there, but we are not on freeway 1 at turn 18, we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 same, have car at [-5,6] at T=18, so 0 is covered, meaning if player is on y=1,2,3 at turn 18, they would collide, but we are on y=7, so fine.\n\nBut in our case, for the path, no issue.\n\nNow, back to freeway 8 at T=19: spans [49,60] and [-23,-12], both away from 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at T=18: [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut at other times, if we were to stay or something.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=7 for more turns.\n\nAt turn 19, if we are still on y=7, then check cars on freeway 7 at T=19.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=19: dt=1, [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in, still safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20, [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], [-35+24,-24+24]=[-11,0], oh [-11,0], and 0 is in [-11,0]? -11 to 0, inclusive? I assume the span includes the endpoints.\n\nThe span is [a,b], so if a <= 0 <= b, then 0 is in.\n\nHere, at T=20, for second car on freeway 7: span [-35 + 12*(20-18), -24 +12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, 0 is equal to b=0, so 0 is in [-11,0], so if player is on y=7 at turn 20, collision.\n\nBut in our direct path, we are not on y=7 at turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we don't stay.\n\nNow, what about going to y=8 earlier or later.\n\nIn our case, we go to y=8 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19 on y=8, safe as above.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at turn 18? But we start at y=7 at turn 18, we can only move to y=8 at turn 19 with action U at turn 18.\n\nAt turn 18, we are at y=7, we choose action, which affects y_{19}.\n\nWe cannot be at y=8 at turn 18.\n\nThe position at turn T is fixed before action.\n\nSo sequence is fine.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason we cannot go directly.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars, but we don't go to y=4.\n\ny=4 has cars at T=18: first car [13,24], second [49,60], third [-27,-16], all not containing 0.\n\nBut we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8 at other times.\n\nSuppose we go to y=8 at turn 19, which is fine.\n\nBut what if we go to y=8 later? But that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nOr if we go down, but that would be worse.\n\nSo H=2 seems possible.\n\nBut let me check the answer format; it should be actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=2, actions at t=18 and t=19.\n\na_{t_1} = a_{18}, a_{t_1+1}=a_{19}\n\nThen position at t=20 is y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 5,6,7,8 have cars with high speed, moving fast.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8 at T=19, it was safe.\n\nBut let me see the position at T=19 for freeway 8.\n\nSecond car span: [-35 +12*(1), -24 +12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, at T=20, if we were on y=8, but we are not, we go to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut just to know, at T=20, freeway 8: first car [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], second car [-35+24,-24+24]=[-11,0], so 0 is in [-11,0], collision if on y=8 at T=20.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 at T=20: as above, second car span [-11,0], collision if on y=7 at T=20.\n\nBut again, not relevant.\n\nNow, what about the lower freeways.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: each has one car with s=3, at T=18 span [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nAt T=19: [-5+3,6+3]=[-2,9], includes 0.\n\nAt T=20: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not in, since min is 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=21: [-5+9,6+9]=[4,15], etc.\n\nSo if player is on y=1,2, or 3 at T=18 or 19, collision, but we avoid those.\n\nNow, back to our path: from y=7 to y=8 at T=19, then to y=9 at T=20.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 that might hit at T=19?\n\nAs computed, no.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car states.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nτ and h: for first, τ=37, h=48, so [τ,h] = [37,48] at t=18.\n\nAt T=19, [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]\n\nSecond car: τ=-35, h=-24, [ -35, -24] at t=18.\n\nAt T=19, [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12]\n\n-23 to -12, which is all negative, 0 not in.\n\n-12 is less than 0? -12 < 0, and -23 < -12, so span from -23 to -12, all less than or equal to -12 < 0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18, [-35,-24], -35 to -24, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nNow, what about freeway 4? It has multiple cars, but we don't care.\n\nBut just for curiosity, freeway 4 cars: (24,13,right,4) so [13,24] at t=18\n\n(60,49,right,4) [49,60] at t=18\n\n(-16,-27,right,4) τ=-27, h=-16, so [-27,-16] at t=18\n\nNone contain 0 at t=18.\n\nAt other times.\n\nBut irrelevant.\n\nSo, I think the direct path is fine.\n\nBut the player is at y=7, and we go to y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn 18: U, to y=8 at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, action U, to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nNow, at turn 19, we are on y=8, and we perform action U, which moves us to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nThe minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 1 turn? No, because from y=7, after one action, y=6,7,or8, not 9. To reach 9, we need at least two up actions or equivalent, but since we start at 7, two U are needed, so H=2 is minimal.\n\nIf we go up and down, it would take more turns.\n\nSo H=2 should be the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case, it works.\n\nBut why do I feel like it might be too straightforward? Maybe I missed something.\n\nPerhaps on freeway 8 at turn 19, there is a car covering 0.\n\nBut from calculation, no.\n\nAnother thing: the car spans are given, and for the second car on freeway 8, at T=19, span [-23,-12], which is from -23 to -12, so x=0 is to the right of -12, not in the span.\n\nUnless the span includes the endpoints, but -12 < 0, so 0 > -12, not less than or equal? The span is [a,b] with a <= b, so for [ -23, -12], a=-23, b=-12, so if x <= b and x >= a, then x in span.\n\nx=0, 0 >= -23? Yes, 0 > -23, true. 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 is false, since 0 > -12.\n\nSo 0 is not <= -12, so not in [ -23, -12].\n\nSimilarly, at T=20, [ -11, 0], a=-11, b=0, so x=0, 0 >= -11 true, 0 <= 0 true, so in the span.\n\nBut at T=19, not.\n\nSimilarly, for other.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we go to y=9 directly, but no, we have to go through y=8.\n\nAnother path: suppose we go to y=8 at turn 19, but then instead of going up, we stay or something, but that would not reach goal.\n\nOr if we go down, worse.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the cars are moving fast, but at T=19, it's safe.\n\nMaybe at turn 18, if we do nothing, but we need to move.\n\nI think I should output the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t_1=18)\n\nThen turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, but in the action index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_{t_1}\n\nt=1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nup to t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=2.\n\nt=0: a_{18}\n\nt=1: a_{19}\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe turn is given as t_1, so it should be Turn t_1: U, Turn t_1 + 1: U\n\nAnd since t_1=18, but in general, use t_1.\n\nIn the box, it should be with the numbers.\n\nThe answer should include the specific turns.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., but since t_1 is given, we can use numbers.\n\nIn the example, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so I think we should write the actions.\n\nBut with the turn numbers.\n\nSince t_1=18, we can write Turn 18: U, etc.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \n}\n\nBut to be precise, let's see the format.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nSo for H=2, two lines.\n\nWe have a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}\n\nWith a_{t_1} = U, a_{t_1+1} = U\n\nBut in terms of the position, after a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y=8, then after a_{t_1+1}, at turn t_1+2, y=9.\n\nAnd we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1? No.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, position at turn (t_1 + H-1) + 1 = t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the text: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\" is not stated, let me see.\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"? No.\n\n\"determine ... to reach (0,9)\", and the actions are applied, so after the last action, position should be (0,9).\n\nThe position after action a_t is y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is a_{t_1 + H-1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the condition, it should be y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut in the text, it says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"? Let me find.\n\nIn the task: \"Find a sequence of actions ... which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\nHere: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThat might be different.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nThen: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nBut in terms of the actions.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nNow, the position y_t is at turn t.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, y_{t_1} =7.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 +1}, at turn t_1 +2, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, at turn t_1 + k +1, position y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nNow, the last action in the sequence is a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at the turn before the last action or something.\n\nI think there might be confusion.\n\nLet me see the index.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At turn t_1: position y_{t_1} =7\n\n- Choose action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- Then at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, choose action a_{t_1 +1}, determines y_{t_1 +2}\n\n- ...\n\n- After choosing action a_{t_1 + H-1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H-1\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =7, not 9, impossible.\n\nIf H=2, we want y_{t_1 + 2 -1} = y_{t_1 +1} =9? But we start at y=7, after one action, y can be 6,7,8, not 9. So impossible to have y_{t_1 +1} =9 if start from 7.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so it must be y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the task description.\n\nLet me read the original.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions... such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nBut that can't be, because y_{t_1 + H -1} is at turn t_1 + H -1, which for H=2, is turn t_1 +1, position after one action, which can be at most 8.\n\nBut we need to be at 9.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo.\n\nIn the player dynamics, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so to reach 9 from 7, we need at least two steps, so y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\nFor that, with H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSo we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps the turn index is different.\n\nAnother possibility: the actions are applied, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H with y=9, but the last position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet's see the sequence indices.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen the position after these actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want the position to be 9 at that point.\n\nBut the task says \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", which is the position before the last action or something.\n\nI think there might be an inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position when we reach, but let's assume that for H, we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nFor example, with H=2, we want y_{t_1 +1} =9.\n\nBut from y_{t_1} =7, after one action, y_{t_1+1} can be 6,7,8, not 9, so impossible.\n\nWith H=3, we can have y_{t_1+2} =9, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+2} for H=3.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nFor H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + 3 -1} = y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=2, we want y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1+1} =9, which is impossible from y=7.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, since y_{t_1} =7, we need at least H-1 actions to change position, so to increase by 2, H-1 >=2, so H>=3.\n\nThen for H=3, we want y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nActions: at turn t_1, action a_{t_1}, sets y_{t_1+1}\n\nAt turn t_1+1, action a_{t_1+1}, sets y_{t_1+2} =9\n\nThen at turn t_1+2, position is 9.\n\nAnd we need to avoid collision at each turn from t_1 to t_1+1, since at turn t_1+2, we are at y=9, no freeway.\n\nCollision at turn T only if on freeway and 0 in car span.\n\nAt turn t_1+2, y=9, not freeway, no collision.\n\nBut we need to be safe at turns t_1 and t_1+1.\n\nFor turn t_1, y=7, safe as before.\n\nFor turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}, which must be on some freeway or not, but since we go to 9, y_{t_1+1} could be 8 or something.\n\nWith H=3, we want y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nSo from y_{t_1} =7, we need to set y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nSo actions: at t_1, a_{t_1}, sets y_{t_1+1}\n\nThen at t_1+1, a_{t_1+1}, sets y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Δy_{t_1+1} =9\n\nSince y_{t_1+1} must be between 0 and 9, to reach 9, if y_{t_1+1} =8, then U to 9; if y_{t_1+1}=9, then S, but we start from 7, y_{t_1+1} cannot be 9 directly.\n\ny_{t_1+1} can be 6,7,8.\n\nTo have y_{t_1+2}=9, we need y_{t_1+1} =8 and a_{t_1+1} = U, or y_{t_1+1}=9 and a_{t_1+1} = S, but y_{t_1+1}=9 only if from previous, but not from 7.\n\nSo only possibility is y_{t_1+1} =8, and a_{t_1+1} = U.\n\nThen y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nNow, y_{t_1+1} =8 must be set by a_{t_1} from y_{t_1}=7.\n\nSo a_{t_1} must be U, so y_{t_1+1} =8.\n\nThen a_{t_1+1} = U, y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nNow, with H=3? H is the number of actions.\n\nFor H=2 actions: a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}, we can have y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nBut the task says we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1+1} =9, which is not the case; we have y_{t_1+1} =8, not 9.\n\nWith two actions, we reach y=9 at turn t_1+2.\n\nBut the task requires y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{t_1+1} =9, which is impossible from y=7 with one action.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H must be at least 3, so that y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1+2} =9 with H=3.\n\nLet's confirm with H=3.\n\nH=3 actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+2}\n\nThen we want y_{t_1 + 3 -1} = y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nActions: a_{t_1} sets y_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+1} sets y_{t_1+2}, a_{t_1+2} sets y_{t_1+3}, but we don't care about y_{t_1+3} for the goal.\n\nThe goal is y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nTo have y_{t_1+2} =9, as above, we need y_{t_1+1} =8 and a_{t_1+1} = U, or other ways, but from y=7, the only way is to go to y=8 at t+1, then to y=9 at t+2.\n\nSo with H=3 actions, we have three actions, but the position at t_1+2 is set by the first two actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1: position y_{t_1}=7, choose a_{t_1}, sets y_{t_1+1}\n\nAt turn t_1+1: position y_{t_1+1}, choose a_{t_1+1}, sets y_{t_1+2}\n\nAt turn t_1+2: position y_{t_1+2}, choose a_{t_1+2}, sets y_{t_1+3}, but we don't need this action if y_{t_1+2} is already 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we must specify actions for t=0 to H-1, so for H=3, we need three actions, but after two actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1+2, so the third action is redundant, but we have to include it or not?\n\nThe sequence must have H actions to reach the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=3, we want y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nTo achieve that, we can have:\n\n- a_{t_1} = U, so y_{t_1+1} =8\n\n- a_{t_1+1} = U, so y_{t_1+2} =9\n\nThen we need a_{t_1+2}, but what? Since at turn t_1+2, position is 9, we can choose S, for example, but it doesn't change position.\n\nThen the action at t_1+2 is not necessary for reaching, but we have to include it in the sequence for H=3.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn t_1+2 with two actions, but with H=3, we have an extra action.\n\nBut for minimal H, we should use the smallest H such that it is possible to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=2, it is impossible to have y_{t_1+1} =9 from y=7.\n\nWith H=3, it is possible to have y_{t_1+2} =9 with two actions, but we need to specify three actions for H=3.\n\nBut the last action can be S at turn t_1+2, when we are at y=9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+2, we are at y=9, no collision issue.\n\nSo for H=3, actions: a_{t_1} = U, a_{t_1+1} = U, a_{t_1+2} = S\n\nThen y_{t_1} =7\n\nAfter a_{t_1}=U, y_{t_1+1} =8\n\nAfter a_{t_1+1}=U, y_{t_1+2} =9\n\nAfter a_{t_1+2}=S, y_{t_1+3} =9\n\nBut we want y_{t_1+2} =9, which is achieved, and the action a_{t_1+2} is at turn t_1+2, but it sets y_{t_1+3}, which is not used for the goal.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t_1+2, we are at y=9, so no collision, and we choose action S, which is fine.\n\nBut this has three actions, whereas we can reach in two actions to y=9 at turn t_1+2.\n\nBut the task requires y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so for H=2, we need y_{t_1+1} =9, impossible; for H=3, we need y_{t_1+2} =9, possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut that seems inefficient, but based on the text.\n\nPerhaps I should check the car positions for turn t_1+1.\n\nAnother way: perhaps the turn when we reach is t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the initial description, it says \"reach (0,9)\" but then specifies \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\".\n\nI think for consistency, I'll go with the text.\n\nSo for this case, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, from y_{t_1} =7, we need to increase y by 2, so it takes at least two actions, so the earliest turn to be at 9 is t_1+2.\n\nSo for y_{t_1+2} =9, which requires H such that t_1 + H -1 = t_1+2, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nThen with H=3, y_{t_1 + 3 -1} = y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nActions: we need to set y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nAs above, a_{t_1} = U, so y_{t_1+1} =8\n\nThen a_{t_1+1} = U, so y_{t_1+2} =9\n\nThen for the sequence, we have three actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+2}\n\nWe have a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1} as above, but a_{t_1+2} needs to be chosen.\n\nSince at turn t_1+2, we are at y=9, we can choose S, so a_{t_1+2} = S.\n\nThen the position remains 9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions at turns t_1, t_1+1, and t_1+2.\n\nAt turn t_1=18, y=7, safe as before.\n\nAt turn t_1+1=19, y=8, safe as before.\n\nAt turn t_1+2=20, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nWith H=2, it would require y_{t_1+1} =9, impossible, so H=3 is minimal for this definition.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car states.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at turn 19, it is safe, but with H=3, we have an extra action.\n\nBut based on the text, we must use H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for this, H=3.\n\nThen the sequence: a_{18} = U, a_{19} = U, a_{20} = S\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9, and we are at turn 20 for the position.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H -1 =18 +3-1=20, y=9.\n\nActions at turn 18,19,20.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nTurn 18: y=7, freeway 7, cars at T=18: [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 19: y=8, freeway 8, at T=19: [49,60] and [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 20: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 20 is S, which is fine.\n\nIf we can have H=2, but impossible.\n\nSo I think for this task, minimal H is 3.\n\nBut in the direct path, with two actions, we reach at turn 20, but the task requires the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, which for H=2 would be turn 19, position 8, not 9.\n\nSo we must use H=3.\n\nPerhaps for other starting points, but here.\n\nSo for this, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nBut at turn 19, action U sets y_{20}=9, so at turn 20, position is 9.\n\nThen at turn 20, we choose S, which is not necessary, but we have to include it.\n\nTo minimize H, H=3 is minimal possible.\n\nH=3 with the actions above.\n\nBut let's see if we can have y_{t_1+2}=9 with different actions, but no, only this way.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, a_{20}=S.\n\nNow, for the car states, it works.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we start from different, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player could go down to avoid something, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut in the initial quick thought, with two actions we reach, but due to the index, we need three.\n\nPerhaps I should check for collision at turn 20 on freeway 8 or something, but we are not on it.\n\nFor example, if we were on y=8 at turn 20, it would collide, but we are at y=9.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) is \\(H = 3\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 19. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is at y=8, and we need to get to y=9, which is above, so moving up might be involved, but I have to be careful about the cars.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, the cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions that move left or right at constant speeds. Collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and you only occupy y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we care about the car on the current y_T, and whether 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the current position, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T for collision at time T.\n\nWhen you are at position (0, y_T) at turn T, you check if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nIf you move to a different y, say to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you check cars on y_T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe collision condition is only at the position you are currently occupying during that turn.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9). Since we start at (0,8), and 9 is directly above, the minimal H might be 1 if we can move up immediately to y=9. But we need to check if that causes a collision.\n\nFirst, let's see where we are: turn t_1 = 19, position (0,8).\n\nWe want to go to (0,9). So action at turn t_1 could be U to move to y=9 at turn t_1 + 1.\n\nBut at turn t_1, we are on y=8, so we need to check for collision at y=8 at time t_1.\n\nThen, if we move U, at turn t_1 + 1, we would be on y=9, so we need to check y=9 at time t_1 + 1 for collision, but y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. The grid has y=0 to y=9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to y=8. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nTherefore, to reach (0,9), we just need to be on y=9 at some turn, and since no cars, it's safe as long as we get there without colliding on the way.\n\nBut we start at y=8, so to get to y=9, we need to move up.\n\nBut at the turn when we are on y=8, we might be in danger if there is a car on y=8 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, if we go through other rows, we might have issues.\n\nBut since we start at y=8 and want to go to y=9, the direct way is to move up immediately.\n\nSo let's check if at turn t_1=19, on freeway y=8, is there a collision?\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst, for each car, we need the span at time T.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at time t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 8, cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor the first car: (60,49,right,12). Since direction is right, and head and tail: for right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let me see the rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h > τ I assume, since it's moving left, head decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, since moving right, head increases.\n\nIn the freeway 8 entry, it says: (60,49,right,12)\n\nSo for right-moving, at time t_1, span is [τ, h] = [49, 60]? But it says (head, tail), so I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since moving right, τ < h.\n\nHere, (h, τ, d, s) = (60, 49, right, 12), so head=60, tail=49, so Span(t_1) = [tail, head] = [49, 60] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] with head > tail.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8, first car: (60,49,right,12), so at t_1=19, span = [49, 60]\n\nBut we need to know at time T, the position.\n\nCollision at turn T if 0 is in the span for that freeway.\n\nFor freeway y, at turn T, if there is a car on that freeway with 0 in [low, high] of its span at time T.\n\nNow for freeway 8 at turn t_1=19.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, s=12, at T=t_1=19, span = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] but T=t_1, so T-t_1=0, so Span(19) = [49 + 0, 60 + 0] = [49,60]? From the formula:\n\nSpan(T) for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt T=t_1, T-t_1=0, so Span(t_1) = [τ + 0, h + 0] = [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23,right,12), so head=-12, tail=-23, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [-23, -12]\n\nNow, for collision at turn T on freeway y=8, we need 0 to be in one of these spans.\n\n[49,60] contains 0? 49 to 60, all positive, 0 not in [49,60].\n\n[-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSo at turn t_1=19, on y=8, no car has 0 in span, so no collision if we are there.\n\nIf we do nothing, we can stay, but we need to move to y=9.\n\nNow, if we take action U at turn t_1, we move to y=9 at turn t_1+1=20.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are on y=8, and we take action, then at turn t_1+1, we are on y=9.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are on y=8, and since no collision, it's safe.\n\nAt turn t_1+1=20, we are on y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nThen we reach (0,9) at turn t_1+1=20.\n\nH=1 turn, since we start at t_1, take action at t_1, and after that action, at t_1+1, we are at position.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nDefine: we have turns t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is (0,8).\n\nWe take action a_{t_1}.\n\nThen position at turn t_1+1 is based on a_{t_1}.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn, say t_1 + H.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, position (0,8).\n\nAfter 1 action (at t_1), position at t_1+1.\n\nWe want position at t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after that, at time t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nSince we start at (0,8), if we take U at t_1, then at t_1+1, position is (0,9).\n\nIf we take S, we stay at (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nIf D, go to (0,7), worse.\n\nSo minimal H should be 1, with action U at t_1.\n\nBut is there a collision?\n\nAt turn t_1=19, on y=8, we saw no collision.\n\nWhen we move to y=9 at t_1+1=20, no cars on y=9, so no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars:\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), at t_1=19, span [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12), span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, at future times, but since we are only concerned with turn t_1 for current position, and at turn t_1+1 we are on y=9, we don't care about y=8 cars at t_1+1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=9, no cars.\n\nSo it seems we can go directly to y=9 with one move.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, which is a freeway, but at turn t_1, it's safe.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can stay or something, but moving up seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, but since we are not on them, and we move directly to y=9, we don't interact with other freeways.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nBut is y=9 considered? The grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so yes.\n\nBut in the car update, for freeway k, k=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=9 is safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action U at t_1.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars at t_1=19.\n\nFirst car: right, speed 12, head 60, tail 49, so at time T, span [49 + 12(T-19), 60 + 12(T-19)]\n\nAt T=19, [49,60]\n\nSecond car: head -12, tail -23, right, speed 12, span at T: [-23 +12(T-19), -12 +12(T-19)]\n\nAt T=19, [-23,-12]\n\n0 not in either.\n\nNow, for example, at T=20, for first car: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], not 0.\n\nSecond car: [-23+12, -12+12]=[-11,0] at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the endpoint.\n\nThe span is inclusive, I assume.\n\nSo at T=20, for freeway 8, second car has span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nBut at T=20, if we were on y=8, we would collide, but at T=20, we are moving to y=9, so we are not on y=8 at T=20.\n\nAt turn T=20, we are on y=9, so we only check cars on y=9, which has none.\n\nAt turn T=19, we are on y=8, and we take action U, which means at turn T=19, we are still on y=8, and we check for collision on y=8 at T=19, which is safe.\n\nThen, after moving, at T=20, we are on y=9.\n\nAt T=20, on y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps we should consider if staying or other actions, but moving up is fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), which is on freeway 8, but safe.\n\nMaybe for other reasons, but I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 4 or others, but since we are not moving to other rows, it shouldn't matter.\n\nPerhaps I misread the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,8), and cars on freeway 8.\n\nBut freeway 8 has multiple cars, but as above.\n\nAnother thing: the second car at T=20 has span [-11,0], so if we were on y=8 at T=20, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nBut in this case, since we move up at T=19, we avoid that.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with one action U, we can do it.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t_1=19, position (0,8)\n\nAction at t_1: U\n\nThen at turn t_1+1=20, position (0,9)\n\nAnd (0,9) is the goal.\n\nNow, collision: at turn 19, on y=8, no car has 0 in span.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, with action U.\n\nBut the answer should be just:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nIn the sequence, since H=1, we have one action at t_1.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0, action at t_1 + 0 = t_1.\n\nSo \\boxed{ Turn t_1: U }\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a trick.\n\nPerhaps y=8 is not safe at some point, but at t_1 it is.\n\nAnother thought: the cars might be moving, but at the specific turn, we only care about that instant.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the second car: head -12, tail -23, right, speed 12.\n\nAt t_1=19, span [-23,-12]\n\nWhen does it cover 0?\n\nSet τ + s(T-t_1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t_1)\n\nFor this car, τ = -23, h = -12, s=12\n\nSo -23 + 12(T-19) <= 0 <= -12 + 12(T-19)\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: -23 + 12(T-19) <= 0 => 12(T-19) <= 23 => T-19 <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so T <= 19 + 1.916 = 20.916, so T <= 20 since integer.\n\nT-19 <= floor(23/12) but 23/12=1.916, so T-19 <=1 for inequality, better to solve.\n\n-23 + 12(T-19) <= 0 => 12(T-19) <= 23 => T-19 <= 23/12 = 1.916, so T <= 20.916, thus for integer T, T <= 20.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -12 + 12(T-19) => 12 + 12(T-19) >=0? 0 <= -12 + 12(T-19) => 12 <= 12(T-19) => 1 <= T-19 => T >= 20\n\nSo from T >=20 and T <=20.916, so T=20.\n\nAt T=20, span [-23 +12(1), -12 +12(1)] = [-11, 0]\n\nYes, 0 included.\n\nBut at T=19, not included, as we have.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut since we are not on y=8 at T=20, it's fine.\n\nNow, for other freeways, but we don't go there.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or move down, but that would take more turns, so H=1 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me see the initial state again.\n\nPlayer at (0,8), and we need to go to (0,9), so moving up is direct.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot move up? For example, if at turn t_1, moving up would cause something, but no, the action is taken, position changes next turn.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, so y=0 and y=9 are safe havens, I think.\n\ny=0 might have something, but no cars, so safe.\n\nIn this case, y=9 is safe.\n\nSo I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut let me look at the car states; freeway 4 has multiple cars, but we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps the player is at y=8, which is a freeway, but safe at t_1.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility that moving up might not be possible if there is an obstacle, but there are no obstacles, only cars on the freeway rows at specific times.\n\nBut since we move directly, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no.\n\nAnother thought: when we are at (0,8) at turn t_1, and we move to (0,9) at t_1+1, but at the moment of moving, but the collision is only checked at the position during the turn.\n\nThe note clarifies: when you move to a new y, you are not on it until the next turn.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see if H=0 is possible, but no, we start at (0,8), not (0,9), so we need at least one action to change position.\n\nUnless we are already there, but we are not.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nTherefore, the action is U at t_1.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nAnd since H=1, no other actions.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because there are many cars listed, but for this move, we don't care about other freeways.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at t_1, it is safe, but let me confirm the head and tail.\n\nIn the car: for right-moving, (head, tail) so head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn freeway 8: first car (60,49,right,12), so head=60, tail=49, span [49,60]\n\nSecond car (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, since right, tail < head, -23 < -12, yes, span [-23,-12]\n\n0 not in.\n\nIf it were left-moving, it might be different, but here all are right-moving for freeway 8.\n\nIn the table, freeway 8: both right.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but we don't go there.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have (9,-2,right,3), so at t_1, span for each: tail -2, head 9, so [-2 +3(0),9+3(0)] = [-2,9] for T=t_1.\n\n-2 to 9, which includes 0, so at turn t_1, for freeway y=1,2,3, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (9,-2,right,3), at T=19, span [-2,9], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3.\n\nBut we are not on y=1,2,3 at turn t_1; we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nIf we were to go through them, it might be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSo for our case, no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think moving up directly is safe and minimal.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: U }\n\nBut to write it properly.\n\nThe sequence is one action: a_{t_1} = U\n\nIn the box as per format.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify the turn.\n\nThe format is:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo for this, Turn t_1: U\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The goal position (0, 9) is not on a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no cars are present at \\(y = 9\\), making it safe once reached.\n- Starting at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8), the player can move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) in one turn.\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 19\\), the player is on freeway 8. The car states for freeway 8 are:\n  - Car 1: \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\), span at \\(T = 19\\) is \\([49 + 12(0), 60 + 12(0)] = [49, 60]\\). 0 is not in this span.\n  - Car 2: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\), span at \\(T = 19\\) is \\([-23 + 12(0), -12 + 12(0)] = [-23, -12]\\). 0 is not in this span.\n- Since 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 19, there is no collision at \\(t_1\\).\n- If the player moves up (U) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\), the position at turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 20\\) is (0, 9). At turn 20, the player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars, so no collision occurs.\n- Moving up directly achieves the goal in one turn (\\(H = 1\\)), which is minimal since the player is not at (0, 9) initially and must change position.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- With \\(H = 1\\), the sequence consists of one action at turn \\(t_1\\).\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: U }",
