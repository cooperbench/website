        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0. I start at y=0 at turn t=0, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and I collide if at any turn T, when I'm on a freeway y, the car's span includes 0 at that turn. But note that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=0, and I need to find where they are at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn 0.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n- Car 1: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 4. Since it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving: span [τ, h] with τ < h, I think. Let me check the update rule.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span [h, τ] becomes [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, it's decreasing.\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], so τ is left end, h is right end, I assume, since it's moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4). But -48 > -59, so if it's right-moving, and span is given as (head, tail), but in the direction, it says \"right\", and the update for right-moving is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], so τ should be the smaller one.\n\nHere head is -48, tail is -59, and -48 > -59, so head is larger, so for right-moving, the head should be the front, so span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn this case, tail = -59, head = -48, so span at t=0 is [-59, -48]? But the notation says (head, tail) = (-48, -59), so head is -48, tail is -59, and since right-moving, the left end is tail, right end is head, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me define for each car, the left end and right end at t=0.\n\nFor right-moving cars: left end L = tail, right end R = head, since tail is smaller.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and head is the front.\n\nFor direction right, moving right, so at time t, position from L to R, with L increasing.\n\nAt turn t, for right-moving car, span is [L_t, R_t] = [τ, h] at time t.\n\nThen at time T, span is [L_t + s (T-t), R_t + s (T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving in this state, I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8 all have \"right\" direction, so all moving right.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 4) so head=-48, tail=-59, so L = tail = -59, R = head = -48 at t=0.\n\nSpeed s=4.\n\nSimilarly, (-12, -23, right, 4): head=-12, tail=-23, L=-23, R=-12\n\n(24, 13, right, 4): head=24, tail=13, so L=13, R=24\n\nBut tail=13, head=24, so L=13, R=24, moving right.\n\nNow freeway 2 same as freeway 1? No, freeway 2 has the same cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nIs that right? Let me see the table.\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1 | (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\n2 | (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4) — same as 1.\n\n3 | (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor (48,37,right,6): head=48, tail=37, so L=37, R=48\n\n(12,1,right,6): head=12, tail=1, L=1, R=12\n\n(-24,-35,right,6): head=-24, tail=-35, L=-35, R=-24\n\n4 | same as 3: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n5 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — same positions but speed 12\n\n6 | only one car: (48,37,right,3) — head=48, tail=37, L=37, R=48, speed 3\n\n7 | (-48,-71,right,24) — head=-48, tail=-71, L=-71, R=-48, speed 24\n\n8 | same as 7: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on a freeway y when for some car on y, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, the grid y from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, so safe. I start at y=0, which is safe, and need to reach y=9, safe.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nIf I move to a new y at turn T, I am not on that new y until turn T+1, so at turn T, I am still on y_T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9. Since I can move up or down, but y=9 is above, probably I should go up, but I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if I go up every turn, but I might hit cars, so I need to check when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so positions are discrete.\n\nLet me denote the player position at turn t as y_t.\n\nt starts from t1=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nAfter H turns, I want y_H = 9, but turns are from t=0 to t=H-1 for actions, so after H actions, at turn H, y_H should be 9.\n\nLet's see: at turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at turn t=0, y_0 = 0.\n\nI perform actions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{H-1}, then at turn H, y_H = 9.\n\nAnd I need min H.\n\nSince y_0=0, to reach y_H=9, the net displacement must be +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and each action is U, D, or S, so S actions don't change y, so H must be at least 9, and if I do all U, H=9.\n\nBut I might need to do S or D to avoid cars, which would increase H.\n\nSo minimal H could be 9 if possible, else more.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go straight up in 9 turns.\n\nThat means, for t from 0 to 8, I do a_t = U, so y_t = t for t=0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, a_0=U, y_1=1; a_1=U, y_2=2; ... a_8=U, y_9=9.\n\nNow, at each turn T, when I am on y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, I need to check if at that turn, for freeway y_T, no car has 0 in span.\n\ny_T = T for T=1 to 8.\n\nSo for each T from 1 to 8, check freeway k=T, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nTurn T, freeway k=T.\n\nFor example, at turn T=1, freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 cars: let's list their positions at turn T.\n\nGeneral: for a car with initial L_0, R_0, speed s, right-moving, at turn T, span is [L_0 + s T, R_0 + s T] since t=0, Δt=T.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nt1=0, so at turn T, Δt = T.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars at turn T:\n\nCar1: L0=-59, R0=-48, s=4, so at T, span: [-59 + 4T, -48 + 4T]\n\nCar2: L0=-23, R0=-12, s=4, span [-23+4T, -12+4T]\n\nCar3: L0=13, R0=24, s=4, span [13+4T, 24+4T]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in any span.\n\nFor T=1, freeway 1:\n\nCar1: [-59+4, -48+4] = [-55, -44], 0 not in [-55,-44]\n\nCar2: [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8], 0 not in [-19,-8] since both negative\n\nCar3: [13+4,24+4]=[17,28], 0 not in [17,28]\n\nSo at T=1, freeway 1 safe.\n\nT=2, freeway 2? y_T = T, so at turn T, we are on freeway y=T.\n\nFor T=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has same cars as freeway 1, since identical: cars with s=4, L and R same.\n\nAt T=2:\n\nCar1: [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], no 0\n\nCar2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in [-15,-4]? -4 < 0 < -15? No, -15 to -4, all negative, 0 not in interval.\n\nCar3: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32], no\n\nSafe.\n\nT=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 cars: different.\n\nFreeway 3: (48,37,right,6) so L=37, R=48, s=6\n\n(12,1,right,6) L=1, R=12, s=6\n\n(-24,-35,right,6) L=-35, R=-24, s=6\n\nAt T=3:\n\nCar1: [37 + 6*3, 48 + 6*3] = [37+18,48+18]=[55,66], no 0\n\nCar2: [1 + 18, 12+18]=[19,30], no\n\nCar3: [-35 + 18, -24 +18] = [-17, -6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nT=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3, cars with s=6.\n\nAt T=4:\n\nCar1: [37 + 24, 48+24]= [61,72], no\n\nCar2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no\n\nCar3: [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11, 0]\n\n[-11, 0], and 0 is included? Span is inclusive, I assume.\n\n[ L, R ] includes L and R.\n\nSo [-11, 0], 0 is the right end, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nAt T=4, freeway 4, car3 span is [-11,0], so 0 is included, collision if I am on freeway 4 at turn 4.\n\nBut for T=4, y_T = T =4, so freeway 4.\n\nAnd car3 on freeway 4 has span including 0 at turn 4.\n\nTherefore, if I go straight up, at turn 4, when y=4, I would collide.\n\nSo cannot go straight up; need to avoid.\n\nThus minimal H >9.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence with more turns, perhaps waiting or moving down sometimes.\n\nBut moving down might not help since I need to go up eventually.\n\nI could stay at some safe y for some turns.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the times when 0 is covered change.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when it is unsafe to be there.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find the set of times T where for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nThen, when I am at position y at time t, if y=k between 1 and 8, I need that t is not in the unsafe times for k.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars as above.\n\nCar1: span at T: [-59 + 4T, -48 + 4T]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4T <= 0 <= -48 + 4T\n\nSince right-moving, L increases.\n\n-59 + 4T <= 0 <= -48 + 4T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4T <= 0 => 4T <= 59 => T <= 59/4 = 14.75, so T <= 14 since integer? Turns are integers, T integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -48 + 4T => 4T >= 48 => T >= 12\n\nAnd first: -59 + 4T <= 0 => 4T <= 59 => T <= 14.75, so T <= 14\n\nSo 12 <= T <= 14\n\nSimilarly, car2: span [-23 +4T, -12 +4T]\n\n0 in if -23 +4T <= 0 <= -12 +4T\n\nFirst: -23+4T <=0 => 4T <=23 => T<=5.75, T<=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +4T => 4T >=12 => T>=3\n\nSo T>=3 and T<=5, so T=3,4,5\n\nCar3: [13+4T, 24+4T], both positive for T>=0, min at T=0 is 13>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when car2 covers T=3,4,5 or car1 covers T=12,13,14.\n\nBut car1 is later, not relevant for early times.\n\nSo unsafe T: 3,4,5 from car2, and 12,13,14 from car1.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since identical cars, so same unsafe times: T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nBut freeway 2 is different row, but cars same, so yes.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars with s=6\n\nCar1: L=37, R=48, s=6, span [37+6T, 48+6T]\n\n0 in: 37+6T <=0 <=48+6T\n\n37+6T <=0? 6T <= -37, impossible since T>=0, so never.\n\nCar2: L=1, R=12, s=6, span [1+6T, 12+6T]\n\n1+6T <=0? impossible, always positive, 0 never in.\n\nCar3: L=-35, R=-24, s=6, span [-35+6T, -24+6T]\n\n0 in if -35+6T <=0 <= -24+6T\n\nFirst: -35+6T <=0 => 6T <=35 => T<=35/6≈5.833, T<=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+6T => 6T >=24 => T>=4\n\nSo T=4,5\n\nThus for freeway 3, unsafe only at T=4,5 from car3.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars identical, so unsafe T=4,5.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars with s=12\n\nCar1: L=37, R=48, s=12, span [37+12T, 48+12T], always positive, no 0.\n\nCar2: L=1, R=12, s=12, span [1+12T, 12+12T], always >0, no.\n\nCar3: L=-35, R=-24, s=12, span [-35+12T, -24+12T]\n\n0 in: -35+12T <=0 <= -24+12T\n\nFirst: -35+12T <=0 => 12T <=35 => T<=35/12≈2.916, T<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12T => 12T >=24 => T>=2\n\nSo T=2\n\nThus for freeway 5, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car (48,37,right,3) so L=37, R=48, s=3, span [37+3T, 48+3T], always positive, no 0 ever. So always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: car (-48,-71,right,24) so head=-48, tail=-71, L=tail=-71, R=head=-48, s=24\n\nSpan at T: [-71 + 24T, -48 + 24T]\n\n0 in if -71 + 24T <= 0 <= -48 + 24T\n\nFirst: -71+24T <=0 => 24T <=71 => T<=71/24≈2.958, T<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+24T => 24T >=48 => T>=2\n\nSo T=2\n\nThus unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, car (-48,-71,right,24), so unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow, summary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14 (but early times relevant)\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=4,5\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=4,5\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=2\n\nAnd freeway 6 always safe.\n\nI start at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nNeed to reach y=9, safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, with positions at each turn.\n\nThe player move: at each turn t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I am on freeway y_t if 1<=y_t<=8, and must be safe at that time.\n\nThen I choose to move up, down, or stay, so y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta = +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be in 0 to 9, so I cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe positions.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 and stay there if needed, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, let me list the unsafe times per freeway:\n\nk=1: T=3,4,5\n\nk=2: T=3,4,5\n\nk=3: T=4,5\n\nk=4: T=4,5\n\nk=5: T=2\n\nk=6: always safe\n\nk=7: T=2\n\nk=8: T=2\n\nFor k=5,7,8 unsafe only at T=2, so at other times safe.\n\nk=1 and 2 unsafe at T=3,4,5.\n\nk=3 and 4 unsafe at T=4,5.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn H.\n\nSince I start at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9 if I can avoid the unsafe points.\n\nBut earlier at T=4, y=4 is unsafe because freeway 4 unsafe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nSo let's see the path.\n\nSuppose I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nI must be at y=1 at some t, y=2 at some t, etc., up to y=8 at some t, then to y=9.\n\nBut I can skip some if I stay or move multiple, but since I move one step at a time, I have to visit each y from 0 to 9, but not necessarily at consecutive turns; I can stay or go down, so I might not visit all, or visit multiple times.\n\nFor example, I could go to y=1, then back to y=0, etc., but that seems inefficient.\n\nTo minimize H, I should avoid going down, probably, since I need to go up.\n\nStaying might be useful to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, let me consider the times when each freeway is unsafe.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and 9 safe.\n\nNow, let's think about the critical points.\n\nAt t=2, freeways 5,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nBut at t=2, if I am on y=5,7, or 8, I collide.\n\nBut I might not be on them at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3,4,5, freeways 1 and 2 unsafe, and at t=4,5 freeways 3 and 4 unsafe.\n\nNow, I start at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nOne idea: since freeway 6 is safe, I can go to y=6 quickly and stay until it's safe to go up.\n\nBut I need to get to y=6 first.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, let's see the path from y=0 to y=6.\n\ny=0 (t=0) -> y=1 at some t, etc.\n\nBut freeways 1 to 5 have unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=6, I need to pass through y=1 to 5, or go directly, but I move one step, so I must visit each integer y.\n\nAt each step, when I am on a freeway, it must be safe at that time.\n\nNow, let's list for each y, the times when it is unsafe.\n\ny=k for k=1 to 8.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, unsafe at t=3,4,5\n\ny=2: freeway 2, unsafe at t=3,4,5\n\ny=3: freeway 3, unsafe at t=4,5\n\ny=4: freeway 4, unsafe at t=4,5\n\ny=5: freeway 5, unsafe at t=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at t=2\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at t=2\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nI need to choose the times when I am at each y, such that if y is between 1 and 8, the time is not unsafe for that y.\n\nSince I move step by step, the times are sequential.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nI must go to y=1 at some point, then to y=2, etc., but I can stay or go back, but let's first try to go directly with possible waiting.\n\nTo minimize H, I should avoid waiting if possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nNow, for y=1, I cannot be there at t=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, cannot at t=3,4,5.\n\nFor y=3, cannot at t=4,5\n\ny=4, cannot at t=4,5\n\ny=5, cannot at t=2\n\ny=7, cannot at t=2\n\ny=8, cannot at t=2\n\ny=6 always ok.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, let's consider the lower part.\n\nAt t=2, y=5,7,8 are unsafe, so I should not be on them at t=2.\n\nBut I might be on other y.\n\nFor example, at t=2, if I am on y=0,1,2,3,4,6, it might be safe, depending on the freeway at that time.\n\ny=0 safe, y=6 safe.\n\ny=1 at t=2: is it safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at t=3,4,5, so at t=2, freeway 1 is safe? Let's check.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe at t=3,4,5, so at t=2, it is safe, since not in unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at t=2 safe.\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at t=4,5, so at t=2 safe.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=2 safe.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at t=2, so not safe at t=2.\n\nFreeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=2.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, safe to be on y=0,1,2,3,4,6.\n\nNot safe on y=5,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3: freeway 1 unsafe, so y=1 not safe at t=3.\n\ny=2 not safe at t=3.\n\ny=3: freeway 3 unsafe at t=4,5, so at t=3 safe? Freeway 3 unsafe only t=4,5, so t=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=3: freeway 4 unsafe t=4,5, so t=3 safe.\n\ny=5: freeway 5 unsafe only t=2, so at t=3 safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=7: unsafe only t=2, so t=3 safe.\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=2, so t=3 safe.\n\nAt t=3, unsafe only for y=1 and y=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\ny=1 and 2 because freeway 1 and 2 unsafe t=4.\n\ny=3 and 4 because freeway 3 and 4 unsafe t=4.\n\ny=5 safe at t=4, since unsafe only t=2.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=5: same as t=4, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe, others safe.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nI start t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nSuppose I go up at t=0 to y=1.\n\na0 = U, then y1=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, freeway 1: is it safe? Earlier for freeway 1, unsafe at t=3,4,5, so t=1 safe. Yes.\n\nNow at t=1, y=1, I need to choose next action.\n\nI can go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\nOr S, stay y=1, or D down to y=0.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSo try U.\n\na1=U, then y2=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, freeway 2: unsafe at t=3,4,5, so at t=2 safe. Yes.\n\nNow at t=2, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nI can go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, if I go to y=3, then at t=3, I am on y=3.\n\ny=3 at t=3: freeway 3 unsafe only at t=4,5, so t=3 safe. Yes.\n\nSo a2=U, y3=3 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNow I can go U to y=4 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4: freeway 4 unsafe at t=4,5, so unsafe at t=4. Cannot be there.\n\nSo if I go U at t=3, y4=4 at t=4, collide.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could stay at y=3 at t=3.\n\na3=S, then y4=3 at t=4? Let's see.\n\nAt t=3, after action, y_{t+1} depends on action.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, I am at y_t.\n\nFor example, at t=3, y_t = y3=3, I am on freeway 3, which is safe at t=3.\n\nNow I choose a_t for t=3.\n\nIf I choose S, then y_{4} = y3 =3, so at t=4, I will be at y=3.\n\nAt t=4, y=3: freeway 3 is unsafe at t=4, so I would collide.\n\nIf I choose U, y4=4, at t=4 on y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, y4=2, at t=4 on y=2.\n\ny=2 at t=4: freeway 2 unsafe at t=4, so also unsafe.\n\nSo at t=4, if I am on y=2,3, or 4, I collide, since all unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=2: freeway 2 unsafe t=4\n\ny=3: freeway 3 unsafe t=4\n\ny=4: freeway 4 unsafe t=4\n\nBut y=1 also unsafe, but I am at y=3.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=3, no matter what I do, at t=4 I will be on y=2,3, or4, all unsafe at t=4.\n\nIf I go down to y=2, at t=4 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf stay y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf up to y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be at y=3 at t=3? But I am there.\n\nThe problem is that at t=4, y=2,3,4 are all unsafe, so I need to be elsewhere at t=4.\n\nBut from t=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be in a position where all moves lead to unsafe at next time.\n\nIn this case, at t=3, I am at y=3, and t=4 is bad for y=2,3,4.\n\nSo I should not be at y=3 at t=3.\n\nBut how? I came from y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, I was at y=2.\n\nI could have chosen different action at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, I could go down or stay, but let's see.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nI could choose S, stay at y=2, then y3=2 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=2: but freeway 2 unsafe at t=3, so I collide at t=3.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could choose D, go down to y=1, then y3=1 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, y=1, freeway 1 unsafe at t=3, collide.\n\nSo at t=2, from y=2, if I do U, to y=3 at t=3 safe, but then stuck for t=4.\n\nIf S or D, I collide at t=3.\n\nSo it's impossible to be at y=2 at t=2 without problem.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid being on y=2 at t=2 or something.\n\nLet's go back.\n\nStart t=0 y=0.\n\na0: I can choose U, to y=1 at t=1, as before.\n\nOr I can choose S, stay at y=0 for t=1.\n\nOr D, but y=0, cannot go down, since y=0, if D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) or something, but the rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, with y in [0,9], so at y=0, if D, y=0, I think, since cannot go below.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, cannot go above.\n\nSo at y=0, if a_t = D, y_{t+1} = 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nSo at t=0, y=0, I can choose:\n\n- U: go to y=1 at t=1\n\n- S: stay y=0 at t=1\n\n- D: stay y=0 at t=1 (since cannot go down)\n\nSo effectively, from y=0, I can only go to y=1 or stay.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9.\n\nSo at t=0, let's choose to stay for one turn.\n\na0 = S, then y1 = 0 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=1, I can choose U to y=1 at t=2.\n\na1 = U, then y2=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=1, freeway 1: unsafe at t=3,4,5, so t=2 safe.\n\nNow at t=2, y=1, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=2 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=3, y=2, freeway 2 unsafe at t=3, so collide.\n\nIf I stay at y=1, a2=S, then y3=1 at t=3, freeway 1 unsafe at t=3, collide.\n\nIf I go down to y=0, a2=D, y3=0 at t=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, y=0.\n\nNow I am at y=0 at t=3.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nBut at t=4, it's bad for y=2,3,4, but I am at y=0.\n\nI can go up to y=1 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=1: freeway 1 unsafe at t=4, so collide.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom t=2 y=1, I could go to y=2 at t=3, but unsafe, or stay unsafe, or down to y=0 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3 y=0, then at t=4 if I go up to y=1, unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo I need to wait at y=0 longer or something.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each y.\n\nFor y=1: safe when t not 3,4,5, so safe at t=0,1,2,6,7,... but t=0 I am not on y=1, I am at y=0.\n\nI can be on y=1 at t=1,2, or after t=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: safe at t=0,1,2,6,7,... not 3,4,5\n\ny=3: safe when t not 4,5, so safe at t=0,1,2,3,6,7,... \n\ny=4: safe when t not 4,5, so safe at t=0,1,2,3,6,7,...\n\ny=5: safe when t not 2, so safe at t=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: safe when t not 2, so safe at t=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\ny=8: safe when t not 2, so safe at t=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\nNow, I need to have a sequence of positions.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can aim to go to y=6 as soon as possible, then to y=9.\n\nBut to go to y=6, I need to go through y=1 to 5.\n\nNow, at early times, t=2 is a problem for y=5,7,8.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are after.\n\nFirst, get to y=6.\n\ny=6 can be reached at any time.\n\nBut I have to go through lower y.\n\nLet's find a time when I can be on y=1 safely.\n\nFor example, at t=1 or t=2 or after t=5.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut after t=5, it might take more turns.\n\nSince H should be small, try to go early.\n\nAt t=0, I can stay or go up.\n\nIf I go up at t=0 to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1 safe (since t=1 not 3,4,5).\n\nThen at t=1, I need to go to y=2 or stay or down.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at t=2, at t=2 y=2 safe (t=2 not 3,4,5).\n\nThen at t=2, I am at y=2, and t=3 is coming, which is unsafe for y=2.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=1 at t=3.\n\nSo at t=2, from y=2, I can go down to y=1 at t=3, but y=1 unsafe at t=3.\n\nGo up to y=3 at t=3, y=3 safe at t=3.\n\nThen as before, at t=4, I am in trouble.\n\nGo down to y=1, unsafe at t=3.\n\nOr stay, unsafe.\n\nSo only option is to go up to y=3 at t=3, safe at t=3, but then at t=4, I must go to y=2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at a safe position at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, safe positions are y=0,5,6,7,8,9 but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=0,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=3, I can only reach y=2,3,4 at t=4, none safe.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=3 at t=3 if I want to avoid t=4 problem.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on y=2 at t=2, because from there I go to y=3 at t=3 or collide earlier.\n\nAt t=2, if I am at y=2, I have no good move.\n\nSo I should not be at y=2 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, not at y=1 at t=2 if it leads to problem, but let's see.\n\nStart over.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I stay at y=0 for one or more turns.\n\na0 = S, so y1 = 0 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, I can go up to y=1 at t=2.\n\na1 = U, y2=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=1, safe (t=2 not unsafe for y=1).\n\nNow at t=2, y=1, I need to choose a2.\n\nI cannot go to y=2 at t=3 because y=2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nI cannot stay at y=1 because unsafe at t=3.\n\nI can go down to y=0 at t=3.\n\na2 = D, then y3=0 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=3, y=0, I can go up to y=1 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=1 is unsafe because freeway 1 unsafe at t=4.\n\nIf I go up, y4=1, collide.\n\nI can stay at y=0, a3=S, y4=0 at t=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=0, I can go up later.\n\nBut this is taking more turns.\n\nSince at t=4, it is unsafe for y=1,2,3,4, but after t=5, they are safe.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=1,2,3,4 are safe again.\n\ny=1 safe after t=5, etc.\n\nSo I can wait at y=0 until after t=5.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 from t=0 to t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=0, go U to y=1 at t=6.\n\nBut t=6 is late.\n\nH would be large.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can go to y=6 quickly.\n\nHow to get to y=6.\n\nFrom y=0, I need to go to y=1, then to y=2, etc.\n\nBut the lower freeways are only unsafe at specific times.\n\nFor example, y=5 is only unsafe at t=2, so I can be on y=5 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's list for each y, the safe times to be there.\n\ny=1: safe for t <=2 or t>=6\n\ny=2: safe for t <=2 or t>=6\n\ny=3: safe for t <=3 or t>=6 (since unsafe t=4,5)\n\nt=3 safe, t=6 safe.\n\ny=4: safe for t <=3 or t>=6\n\ny=5: safe for t !=2, so t=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\ny=6: always\n\ny=7: safe for t !=2\n\ny=8: safe for t !=2\n\nNow, to reach y=6, I need to be at y=5 at some time, then go up, etc.\n\nBut I can go directly step by step.\n\nSince y=5 is safe at t=1, for example.\n\nStart at t=0 y=0.\n\nGo U at t=0 to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1 y=1 safe.\n\nNow at t=1, I can go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2 y=2 safe.\n\nNow at t=2, I am at y=2.\n\nI want to go to y=3, but at t=3, y=3 is safe, but then at t=4 problem.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=2, I cannot go to y=3 because at t=3 it's safe, but then I am at y=3 at t=3, and t=4 I have to move to unsafe position.\n\nUnless I can jump to a safe position at t=4.\n\nBut I can only move to adjacent y.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=4, all unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be at y=3 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, not at y=2 at t=2, because from there I go to t=3 on y=2 or 3 or 1, but y=1 and 2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nIf at t=2 y=2, I go down to y=1 at t=3, but y=1 unsafe at t=3.\n\nGo up to y=3 at t=3, safe but then stuck.\n\nGo stay, y=2 at t=3 unsafe.\n\nSo no, I must avoid being on y=2 at t=2 or on y=1 at t=2 if it leads to that.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=5 quickly, since y=5 is safe at t=1.\n\nAt t=0 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1 y=1, go U to y=2 at t=2? At t=2 y=2, but then I have the problem.\n\nAt t=1 y=1, instead of going U, I could go to y=2 later, but I have to go through.\n\nOr, at t=1 y=1, I go down to y=0, but then I am back.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly from lower, but I have to go through.\n\nLet's list all possible moves.\n\nI need to be at some y at t=4 that is safe.\n\nAt t=4, safe y are: 0,5,6,7,8\n\nSimilarly at t=3, safe y are: 0,3,4,5,6,7,8 but y=3 and 4 are safe at t=3, only unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nAt t=3, y=3 and 4 are safe.\n\nBut at t=4, they are unsafe.\n\nSo at t=3, I can be on y=3 or 4.\n\nBut then at t=4, I need to move to a safe y, like y=5 or 6 or 0 or 7,8.\n\nBut from y=3, I can go to y=2,3,4 or to y=4 if U, or y=2 if D, or y=3 if S.\n\nNone of which are safe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly from y=4, can go to y=3,4,5.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=4, since y=5 unsafe only at t=2.\n\ny=5 at t=4 is safe.\n\nIf I am at y=4 at t=3, I can go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nBut how to get to y=4 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, from below.\n\nStart from beginning.\n\nt=0, y=0.\n\nGo U to y=1 at t=1.\n\na0=U, y1=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\na1=U, y2=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nNow at t=2, I want to go to y=4 at t=3? But I can only move to adjacent, so from y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3.\n\nNot directly to y=4.\n\nSo at t=2, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, safe (since unsafe only t=4,5).\n\nThen at t=3, from y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=4? But y=4 at t=4 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=5? Not adjacent.\n\nOptions: U to y=4, but unsafe at t=4.\n\nD to y=2, unsafe at t=4.\n\nS stay y=3, unsafe.\n\nNo good.\n\nAt t=2, from y=2, I go directly to a position that allows me to be at y=5 at t=4 or something.\n\nBut I have to go through t=3.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 at t=3.\n\ny=5 at t=3 is safe.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut how to get to y=5 at t=3.\n\nFrom t=0, go to y=1 at t=1, y=2 at t=2, then to y=3 at t=3, but y=3 at t=3 is safe, but then I am at y=3, not y=5.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=3, I need to have moved faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=5 in 3 turns? Minimum 5 turns: t=0 y=0, t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5, so at t=5 y=5.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at most y=3.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=5 at t=3.\n\ny=5 at t=3 is possible only if I start higher, but I start at y=0.\n\nSo at t=3, I can be at y=3 at best.\n\nBut at y=3 t=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=4, but y=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nOr I can go to y=6 directly, but not possible.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 via y=5 or directly, but same.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=0 y=0, stay S, y1=0 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, go U to y=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, from y=1, I can go U to y=2 at t=3, but y=2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nGo D to y=0 at t=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, y=0, go U to y=1 at t=4, but y=1 unsafe at t=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom t=2 y=1, go S stay, but at t=3 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I need to be at a safe place at t=4, like y=5 or y=6.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=4, I need to be at y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at t=3, but y=6 at t=3 is far.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=3 or 4, for example.\n\nIf I am at y=4 at t=3, I can go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\ny=5 at t=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, how to get to y=4 at t=3.\n\nFrom start, t=0 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1 y=1, go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2 y=2, go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3 y=3, go U to y=4? But y=4 at t=4 unsafe, but I am at t=3, choosing action for t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, I choose U, then y4=4 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=3, I can choose to go down or something, but y=2 at t=4 unsafe, y=4 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nUnless I can go to y=5 from y=3, but not adjacent.\n\nSo impossible from this path.\n\nTherefore, I need to reach y=4 at an earlier time or later.\n\nFor example, be at y=4 at t=3, but from above, to be at y=4 at t=3, I need to be at y=3 or 4 or 5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, I can be at y=2, for example.\n\nIf at t=2 y=2, I go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3 y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=4, but unsafe.\n\nGo to y=4 directly from y=2? No.\n\nSo still not.\n\nPerhaps be at y=5 at t=4 by coming from y=6 or something, but y=6 is higher.\n\nI think I have to accept that I need to wait or go to y=6 first.\n\nLet's try to go to y=5 at a safe time.\n\nFor example, at t=1, y=5 is possible? No, at t=1, I can be at y=1 at best.\n\nAt t=3, y=3 at best.\n\nAt t=4, I can be at y=4 if I moved fast.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo I can be at y=5 at t=4.\n\nHow? If I am at y=4 at t=3, go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nBut y=4 at t=3 is safe, as we said.\n\nSo let's set that.\n\nTo have y=4 at t=3, I need:\n\nAt t=3, y=4.\n\nSo at t=2, I must be at y=3,4, or5 and choose action to go to y=4.\n\nAt t=2, I can be at y=2, for example.\n\nIf at t=2 y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nBut then at t=3 y=3, not y=4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=3, at t=2 I must be at y=3 or y=4 or y=5.\n\nAt t=2, the highest I can be is y=2, if I moved up.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=3 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=4 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, the earliest I can be at y=4 is t=4: t=0 y=0, t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=5, I can be at y=5, for example.\n\nt=0 y=0, t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5.\n\nAt t=4, y=4, but unsafe at t=4, so I collide if I am there.\n\nSo I need to skip t=4 or be at different y.\n\nFor example, at t=4, be at y=5 or y=6.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=4, I need to be at y=4 at t=3 or y=5 at t=3 or y=6 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=3.\n\nIf at t=3 y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=2, unsafe at t=4.\n\nNo.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=4 from below.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at t=4, I need to be at y=5 at t=3 or y=6 at t=3 or y=7 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=3, so not possible.\n\nTherefore, for the lower part, I must avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo I should be at y=0 or y=5 or above at t=4 and t=5.\n\nBut at t=4, y=5 is safe, y=6 safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, same.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=4, I need to have reached y=5 by then.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=5 is t=5: t=0 y0=0, t1=1, t2=2, t3=3, t4=4, t5=5.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 is unsafe, so I collide at t=4 if I go that way.\n\nSo I cannot take the direct path.\n\nI need to reach y=5 before or after the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, be at y=5 at t=1, impossible.\n\nAt t=3, impossible.\n\nAt t=4, possible only if I was at y=4 or 5 or 6 at t=3, but at t=3 I can be at y=3, not higher.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=5 at t=5 or later.\n\nAt t=5, y=5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at y=6 at t=6, etc.\n\nBut let's plan from after t=5.\n\nAfter t=5, all freeways are safe except the late times for k=1,2 but those are late, not relevant.\n\nFor example, for y=1, unsafe only t=3,4,5, so after t=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo after t=5, I can move freely.\n\nSo one strategy: stay at y=0 until t=5, then go up to y=9 in 9 turns, but that would be H=14 or something.\n\nt=0 to t=5 at y=0, then from t=5 to t=14, go to y=9 at t=14, so H=14, y14=9.\n\nBut I can start moving earlier.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 as soon as possible and wait there if needed.\n\nHow to go to y=6.\n\nTo reach y=6, I need to be at y=5 or y=6 or y=7 at some t, but I have to go through steps.\n\nThe lower freeways are safe at early times before t=3 or after t=5.\n\nFor example, to be on y=1 at t=1 or t=2 or t>=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=2.\n\nLet's be on y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=0 y=0, a0=U, y1=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, I can be on y=1 at t=1 safe.\n\nThen to go to y=2, I can be at y=2 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y=2, I need to go to y=3.\n\nBut at t=3, I cannot be on y=2 or y=1, but I can be on y=3 at t=3 safe.\n\nSo at t=2, from y=2, go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\na2=U, y3=3 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nBut then at t=4, I need to be not on y=2,3,4.\n\nSo from y=3, I can go down to y=2, unsafe; stay y=3, unsafe; go up to y=4, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I must leave the area before t=4.\n\nBut I can't from there.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=5 or y=6 at t=4.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=4, I need to be at y=4 at t=3 or y=5 at t=3 or y=6 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=3, so not.\n\nSo impossible for t=4.\n\nTherefore, for t=4, I must be at y=0,5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for t=5, same.\n\nSo let's aim to be at y=5 or y=6 at t=4.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=4, how?\n\nIf I can be at y=4 at t=3, then go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=3, I need to be at y=3 at t=2 or y=4 at t=2 or y=5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, I can be at y=2, so not.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at t=4, need at t=3 y=5 or6 or7, not possible.\n\nSo the only safe positions at t=4 are y=0,5,6,7,8, but y=5,6,7,8 cannot be reached by t=4 from y=0 with the constraints.\n\nThe highest I can be at t=4 is y=4, but unsafe.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, I can be at y=1, but y=1 unsafe at t=5, so at t=5, I should be at y=0 or y=5 or above.\n\nBut at t=5, y=5 is safe, but I can be at y=5 only at t=5 or later, but at t=5, if I am at y=5, how?\n\nFrom below, at t=4, if I am at y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t=5, but at t=4 y=4 unsafe, so I collide before.\n\nIf I am at y=5 at t=4, but impossible.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=0 at t=4 and at t=5.\n\nThen after t=5, I can start moving up.\n\nFor example:\n\nStay at y=0 from t=0 to t=5.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\na0=S, y1=0 at t=1\n\na1=S, y2=0 at t=2\n\na2=S, y3=0 at t=3\n\na3=S, y4=0 at t=4\n\na4=S, y5=0 at t=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=0, safe.\n\nNow all freeways are safe for t>=6, since for y=1,2,3,4 unsafe only up to t=5, so at t=6, all safe.\n\nSo I can go up directly.\n\na5=U, y6=1 at t=6\n\na6=U, y7=2 at t=7\n\na7=U, y8=3 at t=8\n\na8=U, y9=4 at t=9\n\na9=U, y10=5 at t=10\n\na10=U, y11=6 at t=11\n\na11=U, y12=7 at t=12\n\na12=U, y13=8 at t=13\n\na13=U, y14=9 at t=14\n\nSo at t=14, y=9, so H=14.\n\nBut this is 14 turns, probably not minimal, but it works.\n\nI can reduce by moving earlier to y=6.\n\nFor example, at t=2, I can be at y=2, which is safe, but then I have to deal with t=3 and t=4.\n\nSince at t=2, I can be on y=2, safe, and at t=2, y=6 is safe, but I am not there.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=5 at a time when it is safe, like t=1, but impossible.\n\nt=3: y=5 at t=3 is safe, but how to reach? At t=3, I can be at y=3.\n\nNot y=5.\n\nt=4: y=5 safe, but cannot reach without being unsafe at t=4 lower.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=0 at some point.\n\nLet's try to be at y=5 at t=3.\n\nImpossible.\n\nOr at t=1, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=5 is t=5, with the direct path, but I collide at t=4.\n\nSo I have to wait until after t=5 to start moving.\n\nBut I can start moving at t=2 or something.\n\nFor example, at t=0 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1 y=1, instead of going U, I go S or D.\n\nIf I go S at t=1, y2=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=1 safe.\n\nThen at t=2, I go U to y=2 at t=3, but y=2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nGo D to y=0 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3 y=0.\n\nThen at t=3, I can go U to y=1 at t=4, but y=1 unsafe at t=4.\n\nGo S, stay y=0 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=5, but at t=5, y=1 is unsafe because t=5 is unsafe for y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=5, so at t=5, if I am on y=1, collide.\n\nSo from t=4 y=0, if I go U to y=1 at t=5, collide.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=0 until t=5, then at t=5 go U to y=1 at t=6, which is safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo the same as before.\n\nTo save turns, I can go to y=6 faster after t=5.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns after t=5, but I waited 5 turns, so 14 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at higher y when I start moving.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 at t=6, etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can move to y=6 before t=5.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so if I can reach y=6 by t=4 or something.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to be at y=5 at t=5 or something.\n\nAt t=4, I can be at y=4 if I could, but unsafe.\n\nSuppose at t=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, instead of going U, I go down to y=1 at t=3? But y=1 unsafe at t=3.\n\nOr go to y=0 at t=3, as before.\n\nThen stuck.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 from y=5 at t=3, but not possible.\n\nI think it's impossible to avoid the waiting, so minimal H is 14 with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's check if I can do with less.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 6 is always safe, I can go directly to y=6 as soon as possible and stay, then go to y=9.\n\nTo go to y=6, minimum 6 turns: t=0 y0=0, t1=1, t2=2, t3=3, t4=4, t5=5, t6=6.\n\nAt t=4, y=4 unsafe, so I collide.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=6 before t=6 without hitting unsafe.\n\nAt t=6, I can be at y=6.\n\nHow? If I start from t=0, to be at y=6 at t=6, I need to be on y=5 at t=5 or y=6 at t=5 or y=7 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, I can be at y=5, which is safe at t=5.\n\nSo if I can be at y=5 at t=5.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=5, I need to be at y=4 at t=4 or y=5 at t=4 or y=6 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be there.\n\ny=5 at t=4 is safe, but cannot reach from below.\n\ny=6 at t=4 cannot reach.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=5 without being at y=4 at t=4, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=0 at t=4 and t=5, then start from there.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nTurn t=0: action a0, etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: S (stay at y=0)\n\nTurn 1: S (y=0 at t=1)\n\nTurn 2: S (y=0 at t=2)\n\nTurn 3: S (y=0 at t=3)\n\nTurn 4: S (y=0 at t=4)\n\nTurn 5: U (to y=1 at t=6? Let's list turns.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t.\n\nFor collision at time t, on freeway y_t.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 0: I choose a0.\n\nIf a0=S, then y1=0 at time t=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nActions:\n\na0 = S  // y1=0\n\na1 = S  // y2=0\n\na2 = S  // y3=0\n\na3 = S  // y4=0\n\na4 = S  // y5=0 at time t=5\n\nNow at turn 5 (t=5), position y5=0, I choose a5=U, so y6=1 at time t=6\n\nAt turn 6, y6=1, choose a6=U, y7=2 at t=7\n\na7=U, y8=3 at t=8\n\na8=U, y9=4 at t=9\n\na9=U, y10=5 at t=10\n\na10=U, y11=6 at t=11\n\na11=U, y12=7 at t=12\n\na12=U, y13=8 at t=13\n\na13=U, y14=9 at t=14\n\nSo at time t=14, y=9, so I need 14 actions: from a0 to a13, H=14.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 at t=6.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=6, I need to have y6=6.\n\nSo at turn 5, I must be at y=5 or y=6 and choose U or S.\n\nBut at turn 5, position y5, after action a5, y6.\n\nIf at turn 5, I am at y5=5, and I choose U, then y6=6.\n\nOr at y5=6, choose S, y6=6.\n\nBut how to be at y5=5 at turn 5.\n\ny5=5 at time t=5.\n\nTo have y5=5, I need at turn 4, to be at y4=4 or5 or6 and choose action to set y5=5.\n\nAt turn 4, position y4.\n\nIf y4=4, choose U, then y5=5.\n\nBut at time t=4, if y4=4, it is on freeway 4, which is unsafe at t=4, so collide at t=4 before I can act.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y4=5 at t=4, safe, but how to be there.\n\nFrom turn 3, if y3=5, choose D or S to stay, but y3=5 at t=3, how.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14 with the waiting strategy.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to y=9 faster by using the upper freeways.\n\nFor example, after t=5, I can go directly to y=9.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, min 9 turns, plus waiting 5 turns, 14.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can go to y=6 at t=6, but to reach y=6 at t=6, I need to start moving at t=1 or something.\n\nSuppose at t=0 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1 y=1, go U to y=2 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2 y=2, now instead of going U, I go down to y=1 at t=3, but unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=0 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 14 is the best.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at y=3 at t=6 for example.\n\nAt t=6, y=3 is safe.\n\nTo be at y=3 at t=6, I can be at y=2 at t=5 or y=3 at t=5 or y=4 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=2 is safe, for example.\n\nSo from start, if I can be at y=2 at t=5.\n\nHow?\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until t=4, then at t=4 go U to y=1 at t=5? But at t=5, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=4 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=5, collide.\n\nAt t=4 y=0, go U to y=1 at t=5, but t=5 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=1 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=0 at t=5, then at t=5 go U to y=1 at t=6, safe.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=7, etc., same as before.\n\nOr, at t=5 y=0, I can go directly to higher, but no.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 6, always safe, but I still need to go through lower.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 at t=1, impossible.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, position y=9, but after action a13, y14=9.\n\nH=14 turns from t=0 to t=13 for actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 0 to turn 13, 14 actions.\n\nAnswer format: list actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo for H=14, actions a0 to a13.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen y14=9.\n\nNow, to confirm no collision.\n\nFor example, at t=1 to t=5, y=0, safe.\n\nt=6, y=1, freeway 1: at t=6, car spans: for freeway 1, car2 span at T=6: [-23+4*6, -12+4*6] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar1: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], no.\n\nCar3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], no.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 y=2, freeway 2 same as 1, at t=7: car2 [-23+28,-12+28]=[5,16], no 0.\n\nCar1 [-59+28,-48+28]=[-31,-20], no.\n\netc. All good.\n\nAnd at t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nPerhaps I can save a turn by going to y=9 faster, but from y=0 to y=9 min 9 turns, and I need to avoid the bad times, so 5 wait + 9 move =14, seems necessary.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H, and this sequence works.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving at t=0 to y=1, then at t=1 stay or something, but I tried.\n\nAnother thought: at t=2, I am at y=2, safe, then I can go down to y=1 at t=3, but unsafe, or to y=0 at t=3, then at t=3 y=0, I stay for t=4 y=0, then at t=4 y=0, I can go U to y=1 at t=5, but y=1 unsafe at t=5.\n\nSo still collide at t=5.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 until t=5, then go U to y=1 at t=6, safe.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=14 is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 14, with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) for the first 5 turns to avoid collisions during the unsafe periods of freeways 1 to 5 at turns 3, 4, and 5.\n- From turn 5 onwards, move up (U) consecutively for 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- From turn 0 to turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- From turn 6 to turn 13, the player moves through freeways 1 to 8, all of which are safe at these later times (e.g., freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe only at turns 3, 4, 5; freeways 3 and 4 at turns 4, 5; freeway 5 at turn 2; freeways 7 and 8 at turn 2; freeway 6 always safe).\n- At turn 14, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 1, starting at (0,0). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway k (which is y = k) at that turn and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, we are considered to be on y at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T) and then at turn T+1 we are on y+1 (so we check freeway y+1 at turn T+1). We are not on the intermediate freeway during the move until the next turn.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- If left-moving: then at turn T (>= t1), the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: all cars in the given state are right-moving (direction is 'right'). So for a car given at turn 1, at turn T (>=1), the span is:\n   [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n\nAlso note: the freeway index k (from 1 to 8) corresponds to the row the player must avoid if on that row at a given turn.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 at turn 1. We are not on any freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8) at turn 1 because we are at y=0. So we are safe at turn 1.\n\nGoal: Reach y=9, which is beyond the freeways (so we don't check collisions for y=9).\n\nWe can only move up, down, or stay. We are bounded between y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns starting at t1=1, until we reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to get to 9, we must go up. But we have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the exact turns when we are on them.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions at each step.\n\nLet t be the turn (starting at 1). We are at position y_t at the beginning of turn t. Then we choose an action a_t which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are on freeway k if y_t = k (for k in 1..8). Then we check the cars on freeway k at turn t: if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn t, then collision.\n\nNote: The car state for each freeway is given at turn t1=1. For any turn T, we compute the car's span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nGiven car data for each freeway k (1 to 8):\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn T: [ -55 + 4*(T-1), -44 + 4*(T-1) ]\n  (-8,-19,right,4) -> [ -19+4*(T-1), -8+4*(T-1) ]\n  (28,17,right,4) -> [17+4*(T-1), 28+4*(T-1)]\n\nBut note: the representation for the right-moving car is given as (head, tail) but in the update rule for right-moving, we use [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. \nWait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). We must interpret: for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the larger coordinate) and tail is the back (smaller). So at t1, the span is [tail, head]. \n\nSo for the first car on freeway1: head=-44, tail=-55? That would make the head at -44 and tail at -55? Then the span is [-55, -44]. But that doesn't make sense because -55 < -44, so the car is from -55 to -44? Then at turn T, it becomes:\n   [ -55 + 4*(T-1), -44 + 4*(T-1) ]\n\nSimilarly, the second car: head=-8, tail=-19 -> span at T: [ -19+4*(T-1), -8+4*(T-1) ]\nThird: head=28, tail=17 -> [17+4*(T-1), 28+4*(T-1)]\n\nBut note: the third car at turn 1: [17,28] which is to the right of 0? So if we are on freeway1 at a turn when T is such that one of these intervals contains 0, then we crash.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nWe are going to plan a path from y=0 (turn1) to y=9. We can use BFS in state space: state = (turn, y) and we want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nBut note: the turn number matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nWe start at (turn=1, y=0). We are safe at turn1 because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nWe can move: U -> y=1, D -> y=0 (but we are already at 0, so D would stay at 0? Actually, D from 0: y_{next} = max(0, 0-1)=0. Similarly, if we are at 9 and go U, we stay at 9.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we prefer going up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the car positions for freeways at different turns to see when they are dangerous.\n\nWe are particularly interested in when 0 is in the span of a car on a freeway at a specific turn.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k and for a range of turns (say from turn1=1 up to a safe bound, maybe 20 turns) whether the freeway is occupied at 0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned when the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe can define a function is_safe(k, T) that returns True if at turn T, freeway k has no car whose span contains 0.\n\nFor freeway k, we have the list of cars. For each car (h, tau, d, s) [note: the table gives (head, tail, direction, speed) and all are right], so we compute:\n   low = tau + s*(T-1)\n   high = h + s*(T-1)   [because for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? But wait: the table has (head, tail) and in the update we use [tau + s*(T-1), head + s*(T-1)]. However, the problem states: for a right-moving car, the span at T is [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut note: the example representation: first car on freeway1: head=-44, tail=-55. Then at T=1: \n   low = -55 + 4*(0) = -55\n   high = -44 + 4*(0) = -44\n   so the car is from -55 to -44. 0 is not in [-55,-44] -> safe.\n\nBut let me check the third car on freeway1 at T=1: head=28, tail=17 -> [17,28] -> safe.\n\nNow, when does a car become dangerous? We need 0 to be in [low, high].\n\nFor the first car: \n   -55 + 4*(T-1) <= 0 <= -44 + 4*(T-1)\n   => 4*(T-1) >= 55? and 4*(T-1) <= 44? -> no solution? Actually, the car is moving to the right. So as T increases, the car moves right. The car is entirely negative at T=1. It will become positive eventually.\n\nLet me solve for the first car on freeway1:\n   -55 + 4*(T-1) <= 0 <= -44 + 4*(T-1)\n   => \n   from left: 4*(T-1) <= 55 -> T-1 <= 55/4 = 13.75 -> T <= 14.75 -> so T<=14\n   from right: 0 <= -44 + 4*(T-1) => 4*(T-1) >=44 => T-1>=11 => T>=12.\n\nSo for T in [12,14] (integer turns: T=12,13,14) the first car covers 0? Let's check T=12:\n   low = -55 + 4*11 = -55+44 = -11\n   high = -44 + 44 = 0 -> so [ -11, 0] -> contains 0? yes, at the boundary? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". Since it's a closed interval? We assume inclusive? Yes, because it says \"in\".\n\nSo at T=12: freeway1 has a car covering 0? Actually, the car at T=12: [ -55+4*11, -44+4*11] = [-55+44, -44+44] = [-11,0]. So 0 is the right endpoint -> included.\n\nSimilarly, T=13: [-55+48, -44+48] = [-7,4] -> contains 0? yes.\nT=14: [-55+52, -44+52] = [-3,8] -> yes.\nT=15: [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway1 is dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway1: head=-8, tail=-19, s=4.\n   low = -19 + 4*(T-1)\n   high = -8 + 4*(T-1)\n\n   We need: -19 +4*(T-1) <= 0 <= -8+4*(T-1)\n   => \n   left: 4*(T-1) <= 19 -> T-1 <= 4.75 -> T<=5.75 -> T<=5\n   right: 0 <= -8+4*(T-1) => 4*(T-1)>=8 => T-1>=2 => T>=3\n\n   So T in [3,5]: T=3,4,5.\n\n   T=3: [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0] -> contains 0.\n   T=4: [-15, -4] -> no? wait: T=4: [-19+12, -8+12] = [-7,4] -> contains 0.\n   T=5: [-19+16, -8+16] = [-3,8] -> contains 0.\n\n   Actually, T=3: [-19+4*(2)= -19+8=-11, -8+8=0] -> [ -11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\n   So freeway1 has two cars that cover 0: one at T=3,4,5 and one at T=12,13,14.\n\nThird car: head=28, tail=17, s=4 -> [17+4*(T-1), 28+4*(T-1)] -> always positive? so never covers 0? \n   We require: 17+4*(T-1) <= 0 <= 28+4*(T-1) -> but 17+4*(T-1) is at least 17 at T=1, so never <=0? So safe.\n\nTherefore, freeway1 is dangerous at T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}.\n\nBut note: the same car data is for freeway2? The table says freeway2 has the same cars? So freeway2 is also dangerous at T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}.\n\nNow freeway3 and freeway4: same cars? They have:\n   (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=54, tail=43, s=6 -> [43+6*(T-1), 54+6*(T-1)] -> always positive? so safe.\n\nSecond car: head=18, tail=7, s=6 -> [7+6*(T-1), 18+6*(T-1)] -> positive? at T=1: [7,18] -> safe. And increasing? so safe.\n\nThird car: head=-18, tail=-29, s=6 -> [-29+6*(T-1), -18+6*(T-1)]\n\n   We require: -29+6*(T-1) <= 0 <= -18+6*(T-1)\n   => \n   left: 6*(T-1) <= 29 -> T-1 <= 29/6 ~ 4.83 -> T<=5.83 -> T<=5\n   right: 0<=-18+6*(T-1) => 6*(T-1)>=18 => T-1>=3 => T>=4\n\n   So T in [4,5]: T=4,5.\n\n   T=4: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> contains 0.\n   T=5: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6] -> contains 0.\n\n   So freeway3 and freeway4 are dangerous at T=4,5.\n\nFreeway5: \n   (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)] -> always positive? safe.\n\nSecond car: [13+12*(T-1),24+12*(T-1)] -> positive? safe.\n\nThird car: [-23+12*(T-1), -12+12*(T-1)]\n\n   Condition: -23+12*(T-1)<=0<=-12+12*(T-1)\n   => \n   left: 12*(T-1)<=23 -> T-1<=23/12~1.916 -> T<=2.916 -> T<=2\n   right: 0<=-12+12*(T-1) => 12*(T-1)>=12 => T-1>=1 => T>=2\n\n   So T=2.\n\n   T=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> contains 0.\n\n   So freeway5 dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (51,40,right,3) -> [40+3*(T-1),51+3*(T-1)] -> always positive? safe.\n\nFreeway7 and 8: same car: (-24,-47,right,24) -> [-47+24*(T-1), -24+24*(T-1)]\n\n   Condition: -47+24*(T-1)<=0<=-24+24*(T-1)\n   => \n   left: 24*(T-1)<=47 -> T-1<=47/24~1.958 -> T<=2.958 -> T<=2\n   right: 0<=-24+24*(T-1) => 24*(T-1)>=24 => T-1>=1 => T>=2\n\n   So T=2.\n\n   T=2: [-47+24, -24+24] = [-23,0] -> contains 0.\n\n   So freeway7 and 8 dangerous at T=2.\n\nSummary of dangerous (freeway, turn) pairs:\n\nfreeway1: T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\nfreeway2: T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\nfreeway3: T in {4,5}\nfreeway4: T in {4,5}\nfreeway5: T=2\nfreeway6: none\nfreeway7: T=2\nfreeway8: T=2\n\nWe start at turn1 at y=0 (safe). We must avoid being on a freeway k at a dangerous turn T.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves if no cars: 9 moves (each U) -> 9 turns? But note: we start at turn1, and after H-1 moves we are at turn t1+H-1. We start at y0=0 at turn1. Then at turn2, we have done one move, and so on.\n\nAfter t moves (t turns of actions) we are at turn = 1 + t, and y = number of net upward moves.\n\nWe require y = 9 at the last turn.\n\nWe can also move down, but that would increase the number of turns.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible and see if we can avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nPlan: We must pass through freeways 1 to 8. We can only be on one freeway per turn.\n\nWe need to assign a turn T_k for each freeway k (the turn we are on that freeway) such that T_k is not in the dangerous set for k, and the sequence of T_k must be increasing and consecutive? Not exactly: we might spend multiple turns on the same freeway? But we don't want to because we want to minimize time.\n\nActually, we can only change by one per turn. So the freeway we are on at turn T is y_T. And we require y_T to be non-decreasing? Not necessarily: we can go down. But to minimize time, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nWe can model the state as (turn, y). We start at (1,0). We want to get to (T,9) for some T.\n\nWe can do BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1). We try actions: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints:\n- If at turn T, we are at y (with 1<=y<=8), then we must check that (y, T) is not a dangerous pair.\n\nWe know the dangerous pairs. For any state (T,y) where y in [1,8], we check if (y,T) is dangerous.\n\nWe'll simulate from turn1 to, say, 20.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we reach y=9 at turn T = 1 + (H-1) = H? \n\nActually, we are at turn1: we do an action at turn1, then at turn2 we are at y2, and so on. We do H-1 actions to go from turn1 to turn1+H-1. And at turn1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo H is the number of turns we simulate (including the starting turn? but we start at turn1 and then we do H-1 actions). Actually, the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. Then after H actions? Wait:\n\nThe player update: at turn t, we do action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the next turn? Actually:\n\nThe update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo after action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1? \n\nBut the problem states: \n   \"at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose a_T and then at the start of turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, we start at turn1 at y1=0. Then we choose a_1, which leads to y2 at turn2. Then we choose a_2, which leads to y3 at turn3, and so on.\n\nWe need to be at y_{T} = 9 for some T. And we want to minimize the number of turns T (since we start at turn1, then we do T-1 actions? and H = T? because we are at turn T, and we started at turn1, we did T-1 actions?).\n\nThe problem says: minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nAnd then we have: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note: at turn t1 (turn1) we are at y1=0. Then we do action a1 at turn1, and at turn2 we are at y2. Then at turn3 we are at y3, etc. So to be at y=9 at turn T, we have done T-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1. So if we let H be the number of turns that we are in (including the starting turn?) but the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nActually, the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd after H actions (which take H turns of actions) we are at turn t1+H? And we require that at turn t1+H, we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo at the end of the sequence, at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at (0,0). Then we do the first action at turn t1, which leads to y at turn t1+1? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is y_t. Then we do action a_t at turn t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the position at turn t is y_t. \n\nTherefore, we start at turn t1: y_{t1}=0.\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n\nWe want at some turn T, we have y_T = 9. And we want the minimal T? But the problem says minimal H and then the last action is at turn t1+H-1 and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? \n\nBut that would imply that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? and we don't do an action that turn? \n\nActually, the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: \n   a_{t1+0} = a_{t1} (at turn t1)\n   a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1)\n   ...\n   a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1)\n\nThen after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is inconsistent. Let me re-read: \n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo at the end of the sequence of H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), we are at y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut how? \n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1}=0.\nThen we do a_{t1} at turn t1 -> y_{t1+1} = 0 + Delta.\nThen at turn t1+1: we are at y_{t1+1}, and we do a_{t1+1} -> y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta.\n...\nAt the last action at turn t1+H-1: we do a_{t1+H-1} -> then we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThat means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we do an action? But if we are at 9, and we do an action, we might move away? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9). So we don't require to do an action after being at 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then stop. So we require that at the beginning of some turn, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn the sequence of actions, we do actions until we are at 9. But note: we are at a position at the beginning of a turn. \n\nSo we start at turn t1 at y=0. Then we do actions at turn t1, t1+1, ... until we are at y=9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\nSo if at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T, and if y_T=9, we are done. We don't need to do an action at turn T? But the sequence of actions is defined for the turns until we get there? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for the turns when we are not yet at the goal? \n\nBut the problem says: we do H-1 actions? \n\nLet me clarify: \n\nWe are at turn t1 at y=0. We do an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we are at y1. We do an action at turn t1+1, then at turn t1+2 we are at y2, ... until at turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{H-1} and then we do an action? and then we are at y_H at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we don't need to do an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions? \n\nBut then after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n   and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nThis implies that after doing the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 (which are H actions), the player is at y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nBut how? \n\nAt turn t1: we do a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}.\nAt turn t1+1: we do a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2 we are at y_{t1+2}.\n...\nAt turn t1+H-2: we do a_{t1+H-2} -> then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{t1+H-1}.\nThen we do a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the condition is that y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we move away? \n\nThis doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement: \n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nIt means that after H-1 actions (because the sequence has H actions: t=0 to H-1), we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut no, because the state at turn t1+H-1 is after the first H-1 actions? \n\nLet me index:\n\nAt turn t1: state is (0,0). \nAction a_{t1} is applied -> then state becomes (0, y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n...\nAction a_{t1+H-1} is applied at turn t1+H-1 -> then state becomes (0, y_{t1+H}) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be the state at turn t1+H-1, before the last action? \n\nAnd then we do an action at turn t1+H-1, which might move us away? \n\nThat doesn't match the goal.\n\nI think the problem means that we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn, and we don't require to do an action after that. \n\nSo the last action we do is at the turn when we are not at 9, and after that action we land at 9 at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, we do an action at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and the number of turns we simulate is H+1? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\nAnd then the answer format: we write actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\nAnd then at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of actions to reach 9? and then we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we list actions for H turns? \n\nBut in the answer format, we list H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, so we cover H turns (the turns when we take actions).\n\nAnd then we are at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nSo H is the number of actions, and the total turns elapsed is H (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 for actions, and then turn t1+H for the state) -> but the turn count for the state at 9 is turn t1+H.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", so I think H is the total number of turns from start until we are at 9. That is, we are at 9 at turn H_start = t1 + H - 1? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n   and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nIt explicitly says: at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we do not need to do an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action for turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe sequence goes up to a_{t1+H-1}, which is the action taken at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we do an action, we will move away. \n\nThis is a problem.\n\nUnless the action at turn t1+H-1 is chosen such that it doesn't move us (S), then we stay at 9. But the goal is to reach 9, and then we are done. So perhaps we are allowed to do an action that leaves us at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and then we are done. So we can be at 9 and then stay there.\n\nSo the sequence: \n   at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we do action S, and then we are still at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut then why not stop at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe condition is: y_{t1+H-1}=9. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we do an action (maybe S) and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H, but the goal is achieved at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\", so we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we can stop the actions after we achieve 9? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, which includes the turn when we are at 9.\n\nThis is a bit odd, but it's manageable.\n\nFor example, if we start at 0 and we do 9 U's, then at turn t1+8 we are at y=9? Let's see:\n\n  turn1: y1=0 -> do U -> y2=1\n  turn2: y2=1 -> do U -> y3=2\n  ...\n  turn9: y9=8 -> do U -> y10=9\n\nThen at turn10: we are at 9. But we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\nSo we want turn H = 10? then H=10.\n\nAnd we did actions at turn1 to turn9 (9 actions). And the sequence is for t=0 to 8 (since H-1=9-1=8? no, wait: H=10, then t=0 to 9: that's 10 actions?).\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nLet me try to reconcile:\n\nWe have: \n   y_{t1} = 0\n   after action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we have y_{t1+1} = 0 + Delta\n   ...\n\n   after action a_{t1+k} (at turn t1+k), we have y_{t1+k+1} = ...\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThis means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. And then we do action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn, which might change it, but the condition is only on the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\nHowever, the goal is to reach (0,9), and we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. So we have reached it.\n\nBut then why do we need to do an action at that turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". Once we are at (0,9), we have reached, so the action at that turn might be arbitrary? but we have to specify it.\n\nPerhaps we can do any action at the turn when we are at 9, because we are already there. But the problem requires to output an action for that turn.\n\nSo to minimize H, we might not need to do an action after reaching 9, but the sequence must include that turn.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal H is the smallest such that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nAnd we do actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the number of actions is H.\n\nAnd the state at turn t1 is before any action.\n\nExample: if we start at 9? then at turn t1, we are at 9. Then we need to output an action for turn t1, and then we are done. So H=1? \n\nBut then y_{t1} = 9, and we do an action at turn t1, and then we might move away. \n\nThis is not satisfactory.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we must reach 9 at the beginning of some turn, and the actions are taken until we reach that turn. The turn when we first become at 9 is the turn we stop, and we don't do an action that turn.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo for the example of starting at 0 and going up 9 times: \n   We are at 9 at the beginning of turn 10.\n   So turn10: we are at 9 -> then we don't need to do an action at turn10? \n\nBut the sequence should cover turn1 to turn9 (9 actions), and then at turn10 we are at 9. \n\nThen H should be 10? because we are at turn10 = t1+9 = 1+9 = 10, and we are at 9. \n\nBut then the turn when we are at 9 is turn10, which is t1+9, so we want y_{t1+9} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo if H=10, then t1+H-1 = 1+10-1=10, which matches.\n\n actions: from a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+9} (10 actions) -> but then we have 10 actions, and we are at 9 at turn11? \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nLet me define:\n   Let T = turn when we are at 9 at the beginning.\n   We start at turn1: y1=0.\n   We want to be at 9 at turn T.\n\n   We do actions at turn1, turn2, ..., turn T-1.\n\n   Then the number of actions is T-1.\n\n   And the last action is at turn T-1, which leads to y_T = 9.\n\n   So the sequence of actions is for turns 1 to T-1: that's T-1 actions.\n\n   Then the minimal H is the number of turns in the action sequence? or the total turns elapsed?\n\n   The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1).\n\n   So if we let H = T-1? then the sequence has H actions, and then at turn t1+H = turn1+(T-1) = T, we are at 9.\n\n   But then the problem requires: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n   Here, t1+H-1 = 1 + (T-1) - 1 = T-1.\n\n   So we are requiring y_{T-1}=9, but we want y_T=9.\n\n   This does not match.\n\n   Alternatively, if we let H = T, then the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+T-1 = turn1 to turn T, and then we require y_{t1+T-1}=y_{1+T-1}=y_T=9. \n\n   That matches.\n\n   And we do actions at turn1 to turnT.\n\n   Then at the beginning of turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1} = y_T + action at turn T.\n\n   But we are only concerned with being at 9 at turn T.\n\n   So if at turn T we are at 9, and we do an action at turn T, then at turn T+1 we might not be at 9.\n\n   However, the condition only requires that at turn T we are at 9.\n\n   So we can do any action at turn T, but we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn T.\n\n   For example, to be at 9 at turn T, we must have gotten there from turn T-1 by an action.\n\n   And then at turn T, we do an action (which might be S to stay, or even U/D but then we leave).\n\n   The problem doesn't require to stay, only to reach.\n\n   So it's acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we will simulate until we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn, and then we output an action for that turn as well (even though we are already there).\n\n   So the minimal H is the smallest H such that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n   And we do actions at turn1 to turn1+H-1.\n\n   Example: if we start at 9, then at turn1 we are at 9. Then we need H such that turn1+H-1 = 1 -> H=1.\n        action: at turn1: we do an action (say S), and then at turn2 we might be at 9 or not, but at turn1 (the beginning) we are at 9.\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   For the 9-step example: \n        to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10, then we require 1+H-1=10 -> H=10.\n        actions from turn1 to turn10.\n\n        turn1: U -> at turn2 we are at 1\n        ...\n        turn9: U -> at turn10 we are at 9.\n        turn10: we do an action (say S) -> then at turn11 we are still at 9, but we don't care.\n\n   But note: at turn10, we are at 9 at the beginning, so condition met.\n\n   However, we did 10 actions.\n\n   But the minimal number of moves is 9? Why do we need to do an extra action?\n\n   The problem might be counting the turns differently.\n\n   Given the confusion, I will assume the following:\n\n   We are to find the smallest H such that there exists a sequence of H actions (a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}) that results in the player being at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\n   Then, at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\n   But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", not y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n   This is the core of the confusion.\n\n   Let me look at the problem statement: \n      \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\n   So they want us to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n   Therefore, we must have reached 9 by turn t1+H-1.\n\n   For the example of 9 steps, we reach 9 at turn10 = t1+9, so we want turn10 = t1+H-1 -> 1+H-1=10 -> H=10.\n\n   But then we did 9 actions to get to turn10, and then at turn10 (which is the last action in the sequence) we do an action.\n\n   So we did 10 actions.\n\n   This is inefficient.\n\n   Alternatively, we can stop as soon as we are at 9. But the problem requires the sequence to have exactly H actions, and we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n   So we must design the actions so that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n   Example: if we are at 8 at turn T, then at turn T we do U, and then at turn T+1 we are at 9. \n        But then at turn T+1, we are at 9, which is turn t1+H-1 = T+1 -> so H = T+1 - t1 + 1? \n\n   Let me index with t1=1.\n\n   We want to be at 9 at turn H' = t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n   So at turn H, we are at 9.\n\n   How did we get there? \n        at turn H-1, we were at 8 or 9 or 10? \n        if we were at 8 at turn H-1, and we did U at turn H-1, then at turn H we are at 9.\n        if we were at 9 at turn H-1, and we did S, then at turn H we are at 9.\n        if we were at 10 at turn H-1, and we did D, then at turn H we are at 9.\n\n   So we can get to 9 at turn H from being at 8,9, or 10 at turn H-1.\n\n   Therefore, we can do a BFS in (turn, y) space, with the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\n   We start at (1,0) and want to reach (H,9) for some H, and we minimize H.\n\n   But note: we are at (1,0) and then we do an action and go to (2,y2), etc.\n\n   So the state is (turn, y).\n\n   We are safe at (turn, y) if either y=0 or y=9 (not freeway) or y in [1,8] and the freeway y is not dangerous at that turn.\n\n   We want the smallest H such that we have a state (H,9).\n\n   Then the actions are from turn1 to turnH-1 ( because at turn1 we do a1 to go from (1,0) to (2,y2), ..., at turnH-1 we do a_{H-1} to go to (H,9)).\n\n   But then the sequence has H-1 actions.\n\n   The problem requires a sequence of actions for H turns: from turn1 to turn1+H-1.\n\n   And then at turn1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n   So if we reach (H,9), then turn1+H-1 = H -> H = turn1+H-1 -> turn1=1, so 1+H-1 = H -> identity, so it's consistent if we let the state at turnH be after actions up to turnH-1.\n\n   In this case, the number of actions is H-1.\n\n   But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we list H actions? \n\n   This is not matching.\n\n   Given the time, I will assume the following for the sake of solving:\n\n   We want to minimize the turn index T when we are at 9, and then H = T - t1 + 1? \n\n   But the problem's H is not defined as the turn index difference.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that H is the number of actions.\n\n   But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we list actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\n   So H is the number of actions.\n\n   And then they require that after these H actions, at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at 9? \n        -> then the condition should be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n   But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n   Given the, let's look at the provided examples in the car states. \n\n   Since it's complex, and time is limited, I will assume that the intended meaning is:\n\n   We are at turn t1: state y.\n   We do action a_t at turn t for t = t1, t1+1, ..., until we have done H actions.\n   Then, after these H actions, at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at 9.\n\n   This is the common interpretation in path planning.\n\n   So to be at 9 at turn t1+H, we must have, after H actions, reached 9.\n\n   Then the condition on the last state is at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\n   And we avoid collisions on turns t1+1, t1+2, ..., t1+H-1? \n\n   Because at turn t1 we are at 0 (safe), then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1} (which might be 0 or 1), and if it's in [1,8] we check the car on that freeway at turn t1+1.\n\n   So the turns when we are on a freeway are from turn t1+1 to turn t1+H-1 (because at turn t1+H, we are at 9, which is safe).\n\n   Therefore, for a state (turn, y) for turn from t1+1 to t1+H-1, if y in [1,8], then we must not have collision.\n\n   So in BFS, we care about states from turn=t1+1 to turn=t1+H-1.\n\n   We start at (t1,0) and then we do an action to go to (t1+1, y1) and so on.\n\n   We want to minimize H (number of actions) such that we reach (t1+H,9).\n\n   So H is the number of actions.\n\n   And then the sequence has H actions.\n\n   This matches the answer format: actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions).\n\n   And then at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\n   So in this problem, t1=1, so we want to minimize H such that we reach (1+H,9).\n\n   Example: if we do 9 Up actions, then we reach (10,9) -> so H=9.\n\n   Then the sequence is for turn1 to turn9.\n\n   We then output 9 actions.\n\n   So we will do BFS over (turn, y) for turn from 1 to, say, 20, and y in [0,9].\n\n   State: (turn, y)\n   Start: (1,0) with cost 0 actions.\n   Actions: U, D, S.\n\n   Successor: \n        if action U: y_next = min(9, y+1)\n        D: max(0, y-1)\n        S: y\n\n   Then next state: (turn+1, y_next)\n\n   We want to reach (turn, 9) for any turn.\n\n   We minimize the number of actions = turn - 1.  because at turn1, we haven't done any action, and then at turn2 we have done 1 action, etc.\n\n   So the cost to state (turn, y) is (turn - 1).\n\n   We want to find the smallest turn T such that we can be at (T,9) with a path that respects the collision avoidance.\n\n   Collision avoidance: for any state (T, y) along the path (except the start (1,0) and the goal (T,9) because goal is at 9 which is safe) we must have:\n        if 1<=y<=8, then the freeway y is not dangerous at turn T.\n\n   Note: the state (1,0) is safe (y=0), and the state (T,9) is safe (y=9).\n\n   For turns from 2 to T-1, if y in [1,8] then we check is_safe(y, turn) as above.\n\n   We'll BFS by increasing turn.\n\n   We start at (1,0) with cost=0.\n   Then we consider actions to go to (2,y) for y in {0,1} (because from 0, U->1, D->0, S->0).\n\n   For each state (turn, y), if y in [1,8], we check if it is safe for freeway y at turn 'turn' using the precomputed dangerous sets.\n\n   We precomputed for each freeway the set of dangerous turns.\n\n   So for state (2,0): safe because y=0.\n   (2,1): freeway1 at turn2 -> dangerous turns for freeway1: {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> turn2 is safe.\n\n   So we can go to (2,0) and (2,1).\n\n   We want to minimize the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\n   We can break when we find a state (T,9) for some T.\n\n   Given the dangerous turns, let's BFS.\n\n   We are at (1,0) - safe.\n\n   Actions at turn1 (indexed as a1):\n        S: (2,0)\n        D: (2,0)\n        U: (2,1)\n\n   So states at turn2: (2,0) and (2,1)\n\n   Turn2:\n        state (2,0): \n             actions: \n                 U -> (3,1)\n                 D -> (3,0)\n                 S -> (3,0)\n        state (2,1): \n             actions:\n                 U -> (3,2)\n                 D -> (3,0)\n                 S -> (3,1)\n\n   But we must check safety at turn3 for states with y in [1,8]:\n        (3,0): safe (y=0)\n        (3,1): freeway1 at turn3 -> dangerous? freeway1 dangerous at {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> turn3 is dangerous for freeway1 -> so (3,1) is not safe.\n        (3,2): freeway2 at turn3 -> dangerous? freeway2 has the same dangerous turns as freeway1: turn3 is dangerous.\n\n   So (3,1) and (3,2) are not safe.\n\n   Therefore, from (2,0) we can only go to (3,0) (by D or S).\n        and from (2,1) we can go to (3,0) by D, or to (3,1) and (3,2) which are unsafe, so only (3,0) is safe.\n\n   So at turn3, only state (3,0) is safe.\n\n   Turn3: only state (3,0)\n        actions:\n            U -> (4,1)\n            D -> (4,0)\n            S -> (4,0)\n\n   Turn4:\n        state (4,0): safe.\n        state (4,1): freeway1 at turn4: dangerous? turn4 is in {3,4,5} for freeway1 -> dangerous.\n\n   So (4,1) is not safe.\n\n   Therefore, from (3,0) we can only go to (4,0) (by D or S) or to (4,1) is unsafe.\n\n   So at turn4, only (4,0) is safe.\n\n   This is not progressing.\n\n   We need to wait until the dangerous turns are over.\n\n   freeway1 and 2 are dangerous at turns 3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n   freeway3,4 at 4,5.\n   freeway5,7,8 at turn2.\n\n   turn2 is over, so freeway5,7,8 are safe after turn2.\n\n   freeway3,4 are dangerous at 4,5 -> safe after turn6.\n\n   freeway1,2 are dangerous at 3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\n   So from turn6 to turn11, freeway1 and 2 are safe.\n\n   So we can plan to go up after turn5.\n\n   But we are stuck at (4,0) and then (5,0) -> at turn5, state (5,0) is safe.\n\n   Then at turn5, we can do U to (6,1) -> freeway1 at turn6: safe (because turn6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}).\n\n   So let's simulate from there.\n\n   We need to get to 9 from 0 in as few actions as possible, but we have to wait until turn6 to start going up.\n\n   From turn1 to turn5, we are at 0.\n\n   Then at turn5: we are at (5,0) -> do U -> (6,1) [safe because freeway1 at turn6: safe]\n   turn6: (6,1) -> do U -> (7,2) [freeway2 at turn7: safe? turn7 not in dangerous set for freeway2 (dangerous at 3,4,5,12,13,14) -> safe]\n   turn7: (7,2) -> do U -> (8,3) [freeway3 at turn8: dangerous set {4,5} -> turn8 safe]\n   turn8: (8,3) -> do U -> (9,4) [freeway4 at turn9: safe]\n   turn9: (9,4) -> do U -> (10,5) [freeway5 at turn10: dangerous set {2} -> turn10 safe]\n   turn10: (10,5) -> do U -> (11,6) [freeway6 at turn11: no dangerous turn -> safe]\n   turn11: (11,6) -> do U -> (12,7) [freeway7 at turn12: dangerous set {2} -> turn12 safe]\n   turn12: (12,7) -> do U -> (13,8) [freeway8 at turn13: dangerous set {2} -> turn13 safe]\n   turn13: (13,8) -> do U -> (14,9) -> reached goal.\n\n   So we reached (14,9) at turn14.\n\n   Number of actions = 13 (from turn5 to turn13: 9 actions, and from turn1 to turn5 we did 5 actions (staying at 0), total actions = 5+9 = 14? \n\n   Let's count the actions:\n\n   turn1: action: S (stay at 0) -> state at turn2:0\n   turn2: S -> turn3:0\n   turn3: S -> turn4:0\n   turn4: S -> turn5:0\n   turn5: U -> turn6:1\n   turn6: U -> turn7:2\n   turn7: U -> turn8:3\n   turn8: U -> turn9:4\n   turn9: U -> turn10:5\n   turn10: U -> turn11:6\n   turn11: U -> turn12:7\n   turn12: U -> turn13:8\n   turn13: U -> turn14:9\n\n   So 13 actions.\n\n   Then H = 13.\n\n   But is there a faster way?\n\n   We could try to go up earlier on a safe freeway.\n\n   For example, at turn2: we could be at (2,0) or (2,1). \n        (2,1) is safe (freeway1 at turn2 is safe), and then at turn2 we are at 1.\n\n   Then at turn2: from (2,1) we can do U to (3,2) -> but turn3 for freeway2: dangerous (turn3 in dangerous set) -> not safe.\n\n   So we cannot.\n\n   At turn6, we are at (6,1) and then we go up as above.\n\n   But maybe we can go faster after turn6.\n\n   In the above, we took 9 ups from turn5 to turn13 to go from 0 to 9, that's 9 actions for the upward move, and 4 actions of stay at 0 from turn1 to turn4.\n\n   Total 13 actions.\n\n   Can we reduce the waiting? \n\n   freeway1 and 2 are safe after turn5 (starting at turn6 onward) until turn11 (because turn12 is dangerous again).\n\n   So we have a window from turn6 to turn11 (6 turns) to go through freeways 1 to 8.\n\n   We need to cover 8 freeways, but we can be on multiple freeways in one turn? no, one freeway per turn.\n\n   We need at least 8 actions to go from 0 to 9 (8 ups), but we start at 0 and then move to 1, then 2, ... to 9, that's 9 moves.\n\n   However, note that we start at 0 (not a freeway) and then we go to 1 (freeway1) at some turn, then to 2 (freeway2) at the next turn, etc.\n\n   So we need 9 actions: 8 to go from 1 to 9, and one to go from 0 to 1.\n\n   But we are at 0 at turn5, then at turn6 we go to 1, then turn7 to2, ..., turn14 to9: that's 9 actions.\n\n   The earliest we can start is at turn6.\n\n   So we cannot do better than 13 actions.\n\n   Therefore, the plan is:\n\n   Turns 1 to 5: stay at 0 (by choosing S or D, but since we are at 0, D and S both yield 0).\n   Then turns 5: choose U to go to 1 at turn6.\n   Then turns 6 to 13: choose U every turn to go from 1 to 9.\n\n   Now, we need to check safety for freeways during the upward moves:\n\n   turn6: freeway1 -> turn6: safe (as above)\n   turn7: freeway2 -> turn7: safe\n   turn8: freeway3 -> turn8: safe (dangerous at 4,5 only)\n   turn9: freeway4 -> turn9: safe\n   turn10: freeway5 -> turn10: safe (dangerous only at turn2)\n   turn11: freeway6 -> turn11: safe (no danger)\n   turn12: freeway7 -> turn12: safe (dangerous only at turn2)\n   turn13: freeway8 -> turn13: safe (dangerous only at turn2)\n   turn14: we are at 9, safe.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence of actions for 13 actions:\n\n   turn1: S (or D, but S is sufficient)\n   turn2: S\n   turn3: S\n   turn4: S\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n\n   Then at turn14, we are at 9.\n\n   But the problem wants the sequence for turns from t1 to t1+H-1 = turn1 to turn1+13-1 = turn1 to turn13.\n\n   So we output 13 actions.\n\n   However, the problem might consider H as the number of actions, and then we are at 9 at turn14, but the problem's condition is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 1+13-1=13.\n\n   In our simulation, at turn13 we are at 8, and then after action at turn13 (U) we go to 9 at turn14.\n\n   So at turn13, we are at 8, not 9.\n\n   This does not meet the condition.\n\n   We have a off-by-one.\n\n   We need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n   In our plan, we are at 9 at turn14.\n\n   So we require 14 = H -> H=14.\n\n   Then we need to output actions for turns1 to turn13 (H=14 actions?).\n\n   But we only did 13 actions in the above plan.\n\n   Alternatively, we can be at 9 at turn13.\n\n   How? \n        at turn12: we are at 7 (freeway7) -> then at turn12 we do U to go to 8 at turn13.\n        but we want to be at 9 at turn13.\n\n   We would need to do two Ups in one turn? impossible.\n\n   So the earliest we can be at 9 is turn14.\n\n   Therefore, we must have H=14, and then condition: turn1+H-1 = 1+14-1=14, and we are at 9 at turn14.\n\n   So we need to output 14 actions.\n\n   In our plan, we have 13 actions to get to turn14.\n\n   We are missing one action.\n\n   We can add an action at turn14, but turn14 is when we are at 9, and then we do an action (S) to stay.\n\n   But then the state at turn14: we are at 9 at the beginning. Then we do S and at turn15 we are still at 9.\n\n   But the condition is to be at 9 at turn14 (the beginning) -> so it's met.\n\n   Therefore, we add a final S at turn14.\n\n   But turn14 is the last action in the sequence.\n\n   So the actions become:\n        turn1: S\n        turn2: S\n        turn3: S\n        turn4: S\n        turn5: U\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n        turn12: U\n        turn13: U\n        turn14: S\n\n   This is 14 actions.\n\n   But then at turn14, we are at 9 at the beginning, so we meet the condition.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have done one less wait and then adjusted.\n\n   But let me see if we can reach 9 at turn14 with 13 actions? \n        actions: from turn1 to turn13: 13 actions.\n        state at turn14: requires that the action at turn13 moved us to 9.\n\n        so if we are at 8 at turn13, we do U to go to 9 at turn14.\n\n        and then we don't need an action at turn14.\n\n        but the problem requires a sequence of actions for turns1 to turn1+H-1 = turn1 to turn13 (if H=14, then turn1 to turn13+1? -> turn14).\n\n        if H=14, then actions for turns1 to turn13 (14-1=13 actions) -> that doesn't make sense.\n\n   Given the problem's condition: \n        actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} (H actions)\n        and then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n   to have turn t1+H-1 = 14, then 1+H-1=14 -> H=14.\n\n   and we need to output actions for turn1 to turn13 (14 actions? turns from 1 to 13 is 13 actions).\n\n   This is not matching.\n\n   I think the indexing is as follows:\n\n   We output for turn1: a1, turn2: a2, ..., turnK: aK.\n\n   The number of actions is K - 1 + 1 = K.\n\n   And then the condition is: at turnK, we are at 9.\n\n   So K = turn index of the last action = t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n   and we are at 9 at turnK = turnH.\n\n   So the state at the beginning of turnH is 9.\n\n   How many actions have been applied? actions from turn1 to turnH-1 ( because at turn1 we applied a1 to get to turn2, and at turnH-1 we applied a_{H-1} to get to turnH).\n\n   Therefore, the number of actions is H-1.\n\n   But the sequence has actions for turns1 to turnH-1, which is H-1 actions.\n\n   So if we let the number of actions be H-1, then the problem's H is the number of actions plus one.\n\n   For our plan: \n        We want to be at 9 at turn14.\n        This requires 13 actions (applied at turn1 to turn13).\n        Then the sequence has 13 actions.\n        So H = 14 ( number of turns in the action sequence is 13, so H-1=13 -> H=14).\n\n   But the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H, and then the sequence.\n\n   In the answer, we output for turn1 to turn13 (13 actions).\n\n   So the format would be:\n\n   Turn 1: S\n   Turn 2: S\n   ...\n   Turn 13: U   [ which gets us to 9 at turn14 ]\n\n   and then we are done.\n\n   But then at turn13, we are at 8, and then we do U and then at turn14 we are at 9.\n\n   The problem requires that at turn1+H-1 = 1+14-1=14, we are at 9.\n\n   So we are at 9 at turn14, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\n   And the sequence has 13 actions? \n\n   But the problem's action sequence has length H = 14 actions? \n\n   This is not matching.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might have meant that the actions are for the turns when we are at the state, and then the next state is computed.\n\n   Given the time, I will output the sequence of actions that gets us to 9 at turn14 with 13 actions, and then set H=14.\n\n   And the actions for turns1 to turn13.\n\n   So the answer would be:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 1: S\n   Turn 2: S\n   Turn 3: S\n   Turn 4: S\n   Turn 5: U\n   Turn 6: U\n   Turn 7: U\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn 10: U\n   Turn 11: U\n   Turn 12: U\n   Turn 13: U\n   }\n\n   But then the last action is at turn13, and then at turn14 we are at 9.\n\n   The problem's condition: at turn1+H-1 = 1+14-1 = 14, we are at 9. -> yes.\n\n   And the sequence has 13 actions, which is from turn1 to turn13.\n\n   But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which would be 14 actions (0 to 13) -> 14 actions.\n\n   This is the final point of confusion.\n\n   The problem says: {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} \n\n   for H=14, t from 0 to 13, so 14 actions.\n\n   But we only have 13 actions in the sequence.\n\n   So we must have 14 actions.\n\n   Therefore, we add one more action: at turn14, we are at 9, and we do S.\n\n   So the actions are for turn1 to turn14: \n\n   turn1: S\n   turn2: S\n   turn3: S\n   turn4: S\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: S\n\n   This is 14 actions.\n\n   Then at turn14, we are at 9 at the beginning, and then we do S, and at turn15 we are still at 9, but we don't care.\n\n   The condition: at turn1+14-1 = turn14, we are at 9 (at the beginning) -> met.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\n   And the sequence is as above.\n\n   Is there a shorter sequence? \n\n   If we try to start going up earlier, we might get caught in the danger turns.\n\n   For example, if we go up at turn1: \n        turn1: U -> turn2:1 (safe, because freeway1 at turn2 is safe)\n        turn2: U -> turn3:2 -> freeway2 at turn3: dangerous ( turn3 in {3,4,5} ) -> crash.\n\n   not safe.\n\n   turn2: after being at1 at turn2, we could stay or go down.\n\n   turn2: S -> turn3:1 -> freeway1 at turn3: dangerous.\n   turn2: D -> turn3:0 -> safe.\n\n   then we are at0 at turn3.\n\n   then we can wait until turn6 to go up.\n\n   This is the same as before, but we did one extra action (U then D) and we are at0 at turn3, then we wait until turn6: \n        actions: turn1: U, turn2: D, turn3: S, turn4: S, turn5: S, then turn5: U to go to1 at turn6.\n        then the upward moves as before.\n\n   This is 14 actions? \n        actions: 6 actions to get to turn6: at1 ( because turn1:U, turn2:D, turn3:S, turn4:S, turn5:S, turn6:U -> and at turn7 we are at2)\n        then we need to go from1 to9: 8 actions: U at turn6,7,...,13: that's 8 actions.\n        total actions = 6 + 8 = 14 actions.\n\n   and then we are at9 at turn14.\n\n   So it's the same number.\n\n   Therefore, the first plan is as good.\n\n   So we output the sequence of 14 actions.\n\n   However, in the first plan with waiting at0 for 5 turns and then 9 Ups, we would have 5+9=14 actions if we include the final S.\n\n   But note, in the first plan without the final S, we had 13 actions and were at9 at turn14.\n\n   then we added the final S to make 14 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, we could do without the final S if we are at9 at turn14 by the action at turn13, and then we are at9 at turn14, and then we don't need to do anything, but the problem requires 14 actions.\n\n   So we must have 14 actions.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   H = 14\n\n   actions:\n   Turn 1: S\n   Turn 2: S\n   Turn 3: S\n   Turn 4: S\n   Turn 5: U\n   Turn 6: U\n   Turn 7: U\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn 10: U\n   Turn 11: U\n   Turn 12: U\n   Turn 13: U\n   Turn 14: S\n\n   But wait, after action at turn14 (S), we are at turn15: still 9, but the condition is for turn14.\n\n   We are at9 at the beginning of turn14, so condition met.\n\n   So it's correct.\n\n   We must check safety at turn14 for the action? \n        But at turn14, we are at9 at the beginning, and then we do S, and we are at9 at turn15.\n        During turn14, we are on freeway only if we move to a freeway? \n        But we are at9 at the beginning, and we do S, so we are at9 at the next state.\n        We are never on a freeway at turn14 because we are at9.\n\n   So safe.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n   Let's write it in the box.\n\n   Note: we could use D in the first turns as well, but S is equivalent and perhaps more natural.\n\n   So the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) is 14, with the sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 1\\).\n\n- From turn 1 to turn 4, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway) by choosing action \\(S\\) (stay). This avoids collisions during turns 1 to 5, as freeways 1-8 have dangerous turns in {2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14} for freeways 1-2, {4,5} for freeways 3-4, and {2} for freeways 5,7,8.\n- At turn 5, the player moves up to \\(y = 1\\) (action \\(U\\)), reaching freeway 1 at turn 6. Turn 6 is safe for freeway 1 (dangerous turns are {3,4,5,12,13,14}).\n- From turn 6 to turn 13, the player moves up each turn (action \\(U\\)), progressing through freeways 1 to 8:\n  - Turn 6: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe at turn 6).\n  - Turn 7: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at turn 7).\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at turn 8; dangerous turns {4,5}).\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at turn 9).\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe at turn 10; dangerous turn {2}).\n  - Turn 11: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe; no dangerous turns).\n  - Turn 12: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe at turn 12; dangerous turn {2}).\n  - Turn 13: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe at turn 13; dangerous turn {2}).\n- After the action at turn 13, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 14.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=2, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since they're moving right. The head and tail are given, and for right-moving, the head is larger, so span is [tail, head] I think? Let me check.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so I don't need left.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: cars (-40, -51, right, 4), but -40 and -51, which one is head and tail? It says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for this car, head is -40, tail is -51? That seems odd because -40 is greater than -51, so if it's right-moving, head should be on the right, so if head is -40 and tail is -51, since -40 > -51, that means head is at a higher x, so moving right, the car is from x=-51 to x=-40? But x=-51 to x=-40, that's from left to right, but both negative.\n\nPerhaps I should think of the positions. The collision point is at x=0, so we care about when the car spans include x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for each freeway, we have cars that might cross x=0 at some time.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), and we move vertically, so at each turn, we choose to go up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, when we are on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at that turn, there is a car with 0 in its span, meaning the car is covering x=0 at time T.\n\nImportantly, when we move to a new y, we are not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. So during turn T, we are on y_T, and we might collide with cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, which is the top, I think y=9 is safe, no cars, since cars are on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at t1=2, so turn 2.\n\nI need to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway from 1 to 8, the times when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFor each car on a freeway, we can find the time window when 0 is in its span at that freeway.\n\nSince the freeway is fixed for each car, and time changes.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ, speed s, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T - t1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t1)\n\nSince it's right-moving, h > τ, so the span is from left to right, [left, right] = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1\n\nSo 0 is in [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] if τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/s ≤ ΔT ≤ -τ/s ? Let's solve.\n\nτ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nFirst inequality: τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ sΔT ≤ -τ ⇒ ΔT ≤ -τ/s (since s>0)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ h + sΔT ⇒ -sΔT ≤ h ⇒ ΔT ≥ -h/s\n\nSince h and τ could be negative, but s positive.\n\nSo ΔT ≥ -h/s and ΔT ≤ -τ/s\n\nThen, since h > τ, -h/s < -τ/s, so the time window is ΔT from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) or something? But since time is integer, we need to find integer T such that ΔT satisfies.\n\nΔT = T - t1, t1=2.\n\nFor each car, we can find the range of ΔT where collision is possible.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so we need the union of these intervals for all cars on that freeway to find when the freeway is occupied at x=0.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving to a freeway y at time T, if at that time, y is occupied, collision.\n\nBut we are on y at time T only during turn T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nFirst car: head h=-40, tail τ=-51, dir=right, s=4\n\nSo for this car, ΔT ≥ -h/s = -(-40)/4 = 40/4 = 10\n\nΔT ≤ -τ/s = -(-51)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT from 10 to 12 inclusive? ΔT ≤ 12.75, so since integer, ΔT ≤ 12? 12.75, floor is 12, but let's see.\n\n0 ≤ h + sΔT and τ + sΔT ≤ 0\n\nh + sΔT = -40 + 4ΔT\n\nSet -40 + 4ΔT ≥ 0 ⇒ 4ΔT ≥ 40 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 10\n\nτ + sΔT = -51 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 4ΔT ≤ 51 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 51/4 = 12.75, so ΔT ≤ 12 since integer? 12.75, ΔT ≤ 12.75, so for integer ΔT, ΔT <=12.\n\nΔT=13: -51 +4*13 = -51+52=1 >0, not <=0, so τ + sΔT =1 >0, which violates τ + sΔT ≤0? The condition is τ + sΔT ≤0 and 0≤ h + sΔT.\n\nFor ΔT=13: τ + sΔT = -51 + 52 =1 >0, so τ + sΔT ≤0 false, so not in span.\n\nh + sΔT = -40 +52=12>0, true, but first condition false.\n\nΔT=12: τ + sΔT = -51 + 48 = -3 ≤0 true, h + sΔT = -40+48=8>0 true, so yes.\n\nΔT=10: τ + sΔT = -51 +40 = -11 ≤0 true, h + sΔT = -40+40=0 >=0 true.\n\nΔT=9: h + sΔT = -40 +36= -4 <0, not >=0, so not.\n\nSo for this car, ΔT from 10 to 12 inclusive.\n\nSecond car on freeway 1: (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nh=-4, τ=-15, s=4\n\nΔT ≥ -h/s = -(-4)/4 =4/4=1\n\nΔT ≤ -τ/s = -(-15)/4=15/4=3.75, so ΔT <=3\n\nNow, check: h + sΔT = -4 +4ΔT >=0 ⇒ 4ΔT>=4 ⇒ ΔT>=1\n\nτ + sΔT = -15 +4ΔT <=0 ⇒ 4ΔT<=15 ⇒ ΔT<=3.75, so ΔT<=3 for integer.\n\nΔT=1: τ + sΔT = -15+4=-11<=0, h + sΔT= -4+4=0>=0, ok\n\nΔT=2: -15+8=-7<=0, -4+8=4>0\n\nΔT=3: -15+12=-3<=0, -4+12=8>0\n\nΔT=4: -15+16=1>0 not <=0, not.\n\nSo ΔT=1,2,3\n\nThird car: (32,21,right,4) head=32, tail=21, s=4\n\nΔT >= -h/s = -32/4 = -8\n\nΔT <= -τ/s = -21/4 = -5.25\n\nSince ΔT >= -8 and ΔT <= -5.25\n\nBut ΔT is T - t1 = T-2, which for T>=2, ΔT >=0, but -8 is negative, so for ΔT >=0, this is always true? Let's see.\n\nΔT >= -8, which for ΔT >=0 is true since -8<0.\n\nΔT <= -5.25, but -5.25 is negative, and ΔT >=0, so ΔT <= -5.25 cannot be true for ΔT>=0. Contradiction.\n\nCheck the condition.\n\n0 <= h + sΔT = 32 + 4ΔT, which is always true for ΔT >=0 since 32>0.\n\nτ + sΔT = 21 + 4ΔT <=0? 21 +4ΔT <=0 only if ΔT <= -21/4 = -5.25, but ΔT >=0, so 21+4ΔT >=21>0, so τ + sΔT >0, not <=0, so 0 is never in the span because the car is always to the right, since head and tail both positive and moving right.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=t1=2, span [21,32], 0 not in.\n\nAs time increases, it moves right, so always x>0, never covers x=0. So this car never causes collision at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars with positive positions.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only first two cars matter: car1: ΔT=10,11,12; car2: ΔT=1,2,3\n\nSo freeway 1 is occupied at ΔT=1,2,3,10,11,12\n\nThat is, times T = t1 + ΔT = 2 + ΔT, so T=3,4,5 (from ΔT=1,2,3) and T=12,13,14 (ΔT=10,11,12)\n\nΔT=1: T=3; ΔT=2: T=4; ΔT=3: T=5; ΔT=10: T=12; ΔT=11: T=13; ΔT=12: T=14\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Look at the table.\n\nFreeway 2: cars same as freeway 1: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nSame as freeway 1, so occupied at same times: T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nBut freeway 2 is different row, but same cars? Probably different freeway, but cars have same parameters, so yes, same occupation times.\n\nNow freeway 3: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, s=6\n\nBoth positive, moving right, span starts at 49>0, so never covers x=0. Similar to before.\n\nh + sΔT =60 +6ΔT always >0, τ + sΔT=49+6ΔT>0, so 0 not <= or >=? 0 < τ + sΔT since min is 49>0, so not in span.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6) h=24, τ=13, both positive, moving right, min x=13>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6) h=-12, τ=-23, s=6\n\nΔT >= -h/s = -(-12)/6 =12/6=2\n\nΔT <= -τ/s = -(-23)/6=23/6≈3.833, so ΔT<=3\n\nNow, h + sΔT = -12 +6ΔT >=0 ⇒ 6ΔT >=12 ⇒ ΔT>=2\n\nτ + sΔT = -23 +6ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6ΔT <=23 ⇒ ΔT <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so ΔT<=3\n\nΔT=2: τ + sΔT = -23+12= -11 <=0, h + sΔT= -12+12=0>=0 ok\n\nΔT=3: -23+18= -5 <=0, -12+18=6>0 ok\n\nΔT=4: -23+24=1>0 not <=0, not\n\nSo for this car, ΔT=2,3\n\nThus freeway 3 occupied only at ΔT=2,3, so T=4,5\n\nt1=2, ΔT=2: T=4, ΔT=3: T=5\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) same, so occupied at T=4,5\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nΔT >= -h/s = -(-48)/12 =48/12=4\n\nΔT <= -τ/s = -(-59)/12=59/12≈4.916, so ΔT<=4\n\nΔT>=4 and ΔT<=4.916, so ΔT=4\n\nCheck: h + sΔT = -48 +12ΔT >=0 ⇒ 12ΔT>=48 ⇒ ΔT>=4\n\nτ + sΔT = -59 +12ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12ΔT<=59 ⇒ ΔT<=59/12≈4.916, so for integer ΔT=4\n\nΔT=4: τ + sΔT = -59 +48= -11 <=0, h + sΔT= -48+48=0>=0 ok\n\nΔT=5: τ + sΔT= -59+60=1>0 not <=0, not\n\nSo only ΔT=4, T=6\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) both positive, never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,12) h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nNow, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <= 12ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nSecond, -11 +12ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so for integer ΔT>=0, only ΔT=0 possible? ΔT=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, and 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nΔT=1: -11+12=1 >0 not <=0, so not.\n\nSo for this car, only at ΔT=0, T=t1=2\n\nBut t1=2, so at turn 2, this car is at x=0? h=0, so at T=2, head at 0, so x=0 is covered.\n\nNow, freeway 5 has multiple cars.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=2, third car covers x=0.\n\nAlso first car at ΔT=4, T=6.\n\nBut for freeway occupation, we care about when any car covers x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, at T=2, occupied (since ΔT=0 for third car)\n\nAt T=6, occupied (from first car)\n\nNow, freeway 6: only one car: (54,43,right,3) both positive, moving right, min x=43>0, never covers x=0. So freeway 6 is always safe? No cars cause collision at x=0.\n\nFreeway 7: (0,-23,right,24) h=0, τ=-23, s=24\n\nSimilarly, span: [-23 +24ΔT, 0 +24ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -23 +24ΔT <= 0 <= 24ΔT\n\n0 <= 24ΔT always for ΔT>=0\n\n-23 +24ΔT <=0 ⇒ 24ΔT <=23 ⇒ ΔT <= 23/24 ≈0.958, so only ΔT=0\n\nThus at T=2, occupied.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (0,-23,right,24) same, so at T=2, occupied.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when it is occupied (car at x=0):\n\nFreeway 1: T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: T=4,5\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, T=4,5\n\nFreeway 5: T=2 and T=6\n\nFreeway 6: never occupied\n\nFreeway 7: T=2\n\nFreeway 8: T=2\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t1=2, position y=0.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and T is an occupied time for that freeway, collision.\n\nWe start at T=2, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning we take H actions, from t= t1 to t1+H-1, and after H turns, we are at y=9.\n\nLet’s denote the turns: starting from turn 2.\n\nAfter each action, position changes.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy from action.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nt1=2, we start at turn 2, position (0,0).\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H}, and we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1, so T from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nFor example, start turn 2, after 0 actions, at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (at turn 2), we go to turn 3, y_3.\n\nAfter second action (at turn 3), to turn 4, y_4, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we need to minimize H.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9, by always going up: actions U,U,U,... 9 times, to y=9 in 9 turns.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut since we can only move one step at a time, and y from 0 to 9, we must pass through each y, but we can skip some by moving up or down, but to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some down or stay, but to minimize H, we want as few stay or down as possible, but we might need to avoid certain times.\n\nH is the number of actions, which is also the number of turns from start to end point.\n\nStart at turn T=2, after H actions, at turn T=2+H.\n\ny_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe path: we start at y_2=0, after action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, ..., up to y_{2+H} = y_{2+H-1} + Δy_{2+H-1} =9.\n\nSince we need to increase y from 0 to 9, net +9, each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0, so the number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, then U - D =9, and U + D + S = H.\n\nSince U - D =9, and U + D + S = H, then 2U + S = H +9, so H >=9, and H=9 only if S=0 and D=0, all U.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might not be able to go straight up.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H, avoiding being on freeway y at turn T if y is occupied at T.\n\ny from 1 to 8.\n\nNow, let's list the occupied times for each y (freeway).\n\ny=1: occupied at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: same, T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: occupied at T=4,5\n\ny=4: occupied at T=4,5\n\ny=5: occupied at T=2 and T=6\n\ny=6: never occupied\n\ny=7: occupied at T=2\n\ny=8: occupied at T=2\n\nAlso, at T=2, y=5,7,8 are occupied.\n\nBut at T=2, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan the path.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the occupied times.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose actions to move up when possible.\n\nFirst, at T=2, we are at y=0. We can choose to go up to y=1, or stay, or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so we can only go up or stay. Since we want to go up, probably go up.\n\nBut if we go up at T=2, action a_2=U, then y_3 =1.\n\nAt T=3, we are on y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is occupied at T=3,4,5? T=3 is occupied for y=1.\n\nSo at T=3, if we are on y=1, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=1 at T=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=0 at T=2, then at T=3, we are still at y=0, which is safe, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut at T=3, if we go up to y=1, then at T=3, we are on y=0 (before action), after action to y=1 at turn T=4? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the car positions at T.\n\nFor example, at turn T=2, we are at y_2=0, which is safe.\n\nWe choose a_2.\n\nIf a_2=U, then y_3=1.\n\nThen at turn T=3, we are on y_3=1.\n\nNow, for y=1, at T=3, it is occupied (since freeway 1 occupied at T=3), so collision at T=3.\n\nIf a_2=S, then y_3=0, at T=3 on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=3, we can choose a_3.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at T=4? a_3=U, then y_4=1.\n\nAt T=4, we are on y_4=1.\n\ny=1 occupied at T=4? Yes, T=4 is occupied for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, T=5 occupied.\n\nBut T=3 not occupied? T=3 is occupied, but at T=4, if we are on y=1, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at any time from T=3 to T=5 or T=12 to T=14, collision.\n\nBut T=12 is later, we might avoid that.\n\nFirst, near start.\n\nAt T=2, we cannot go up to y=1 immediately because T=3 y=1 occupied.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 at T=2, then at T=3 on y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=3, we can choose to go up or not.\n\nIf we go up at T=3, a_3=U, then y_4=1.\n\nAt T=4, on y=4? y_4=1.\n\ny=1 occupied at T=4, collision.\n\nIf we stay at T=3, y_4=0, then at T=4 on y=0, safe, but not progress.\n\nWe need to go to higher y.\n\ny=1 is occupied from T=3 to5, so we cannot be on y=1 during those turns.\n\nSimilarly for y=2.\n\nBut we can go to y=1 after T=5 or before, but before T=3? T=2, if we were on y=1 at T=2, but at T=2, we are at y=0, not on y=1.\n\nWe start at y=0 T=2.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=1 is T=3 if we go up at T=2, but T=3 occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go up later, say at T=5, a_5=U, then y_6=1, at T=6 on y=1.\n\nT=6, is y=1 occupied? Freeway 1 occupied at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=6 not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=1 at T=6 or later, except T=12-14.\n\nBut T=12 is later, we might not need to wait that long.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, same occupied times.\n\nNow, other freeways.\n\ny=3 and y=4 occupied at T=4,5.\n\ny=5 occupied at T=2 and T=6.\n\ny=6 never occupied.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=2.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=5,7,8 occupied, but we are at y=0.\n\nNow, to go up, we need to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we can go there.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, we might need more.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 have early occupancy, we might skip them or go later.\n\nBut we have to go through them.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 quickly, since it's always safe.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, no cars, so always safe.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 occupied at T=2, but that's past, we can go to them later.\n\nOccupied only at T=2, so after T=2, they are safe.\n\ny=7 occupied only at T=2, so for T>2, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 only at T=2, so T>2 safe.\n\ny=5 occupied at T=2 and T=6, so at T=6 occupied, other times safe? T=3,4,5,7,etc.\n\nBut at T=6 occupied.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nWe need to get to y=1 or higher.\n\nAt T=2, we can only go up or stay.\n\nIf go up, to y=1 at T=3, but occupied, collision.\n\nSo we must stay or go down, but down not possible, so only stay at T=2.\n\na_2=S, then y_3=0, at T=3 on y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=3, we can choose a_3.\n\nIf we go up, to y=1 at T=4, but at T=4 on y=1, occupied (since T=4 occupied for y=1).\n\nIf stay, y_4=0, safe but no progress.\n\nWe cannot go to y=1 until T=6 or later.\n\nAt T=3, we can only stay or go up, but go up causes collision at T=4.\n\nSo we must stay at T=3 as well? a_3=S, then y_4=0, at T=4 on y=0.\n\nAt T=4, we can choose a_4.\n\nIf go up to y=1 at T=5, at T=5 on y=1, but T=5 occupied for y=1, collision.\n\nIf stay, y_5=0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5, if go up to y=1 at T=6, at T=6 on y=1.\n\nT=6: is y=1 occupied? Occupied at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=6 not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=1 at T=6.\n\nBut we are at y=0 until we move up.\n\nSo from T=2 to T=5, we are stuck at y=0 if we don't move, but we can move at T=5 to go to y=1 at T=6.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nStart T=2, y=0.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1 at T=3,4,5, we cannot be on y=1 until at least T=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=2.\n\nBut we can go directly to higher y? No, we move one step at a time.\n\nWe can only change y by +1,0,-1 per turn.\n\nSo we must go through y=1 to go to y=2, etc.\n\nWe can go to y=1 only when it is safe, which is not at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nNow, at T=2, we must stay, so a_2=S, y_3=0.\n\nT=3, we must stay or? If we go up, y_4=1, at T=4 on y=1 occupied.\n\nIf stay, y_4=0.\n\nT=4, if go up, y_5=1, at T=5 on y=1 occupied.\n\nIf stay, y_5=0.\n\nT=5, we can go up: a_5=U, then y_6=1.\n\nAt T=6, on y=1, which is safe since T=6 not occupied.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut we wasted 3 turns staying at y=0 from T=2 to T=5, and at T=6 we are at y=1.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, which is 8 more steps, but we have to avoid other obstacles.\n\ny=2 has same occupied times as y=1, so at T=6, we are on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=6, we can go up to y=2: a_6=U, y_7=2.\n\nAt T=7, on y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 occupied at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=7 not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 occupied at T=4,5, but T=4,5 are past, so at T=7, y=3 should be safe? Occupied only at T=4,5, so for T>5, y=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4 safe after T=5.\n\ny=5 occupied at T=6? T=6 is occupied for y=5.\n\nAt T=7, on y=2, we can go up to y=3: a_7=U, y_8=3.\n\nAt T=8, on y=3, safe since T=8 >5.\n\nThen go to y=4: a_8=U, y_9=4.\n\nAt T=9, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen to y=5: a_9=U, y_10=5.\n\nAt T=10, on y=5.\n\nNow, y=5 occupied at T=2 and T=6, T=10 not occupied, so safe? T=6 was occupied, but not T=10.\n\nThen go to y=6: a_10=U, y_11=6.\n\nAt T=11, on y=6, which is always safe.\n\nThen to y=7: a_11=U, y_12=7.\n\nAt T=12, on y=7.\n\ny=7 occupied only at T=2, so T=12 safe.\n\nThen to y=8: a_12=U, y_13=8.\n\nAt T=13, on y=8.\n\ny=8 occupied only at T=2, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9: a_13=U, y_14=9.\n\nAt T=14, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, how many actions? From T=2 to T=13, actions at T=2 to T=13, that's 12 actions? Turns: action at T=2: S (stay)\n\nT=3: S? In the sequence above, at T=2: S, y_3=0\n\nT=3: I didn't specify, but in my earlier, from T=2 to T=5, I stayed until T=5.\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nStart T=2: a_2=S, y_3=0\n\nT=3: we need to stay or? At T=3, if we stay, y_4=0; if go up, y_4=1 but occupied at T=4.\n\nSo we must stay: a_3=S, y_4=0\n\nT=4: similarly, if go up, y_5=1 occupied at T=5; so stay: a_4=S, y_5=0\n\nT=5: go up: a_5=U, y_6=1\n\nT=6: go up: a_6=U, y_7=2\n\nT=7: go up: a_7=U, y_8=3\n\nT=8: go up: a_8=U, y_9=4\n\nT=9: go up: a_9=U, y_10=5\n\nT=10: go up: a_10=U, y_11=6\n\nT=11: go up: a_11=U, y_12=7\n\nT=12: go up: a_12=U, y_13=8\n\nT=13: go up: a_13=U, y_14=9\n\nNow, we have actions from T=2 to T=13, that's 12 actions, H=12, and at T=14, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from start to end, or number of actions?\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at t=t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so at time t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter that, at time t1 + H, we are at position.\n\nIn this case, actions at T=2 to T=13 (t=0 to 11, H=12), then at T=14, y=9.\n\nBut we started at T=2, after 12 actions, at T=14.\n\nBut is this minimal? We wasted 3 turns at y=0.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster.\n\nFor example, at T=6, we go to y=1, but we could go to higher y directly? No, we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we can go to y=6 as soon as possible.\n\nBut to get to y=6, we need to go through y=1 to 5, which have restrictions.\n\ny=1 and y=2 can be entered at T=6 or later except occupied times.\n\nBut T=6 is the first safe time for y=1 and y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 are safe after T=5, so from T=6 onwards.\n\ny=5 is occupied at T=6, so we cannot be on y=5 at T=6.\n\nIn my path, at T=10, I was on y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut at T=6, when I am on y=1, I could potentially go to y=3 or something, but I can only move to adjacent y.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=6, I go to y=2 at T=7, then to y=3 at T=8, etc.\n\nBut at T=6, y=5 is occupied, but I am not on y=5.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps I can stay less.\n\nBut I had to stay at y=0 from T=2 to T=5, because I cannot go to y=1 earlier without collision.\n\nUnless I go to another y, but I start at y=0, only can go to y=1.\n\nPerhaps I can go down, but y=0 is min, cannot go down.\n\nSo I must stay at y=0 until I can safely go to y=1.\n\nThe first safe time for y=1 is T=6, as T=3,4,5 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, I go to y=1 at T=6.\n\nThen to y=2 at T=7, etc.\n\nBut when I go to y=5, at T=10, safe.\n\nBut y=5 is also occupied at T=6, but I am not on it then.\n\nNow, at T=12,13,14, y=1 and y=2 are occupied again, but I am past them.\n\nIn my path, I reach y=9 at T=14.\n\nBut H=12 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by skipping some levels or something, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 directly when possible.\n\nBut to get to y=6, I need to be at y=5 or y=7, but y=5 and y=7 have restrictions.\n\ny=7 is safe after T=2, so from T=3 onwards.\n\nBut to reach y=7, I need to come from y=6 or y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I start from y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 via a different path, but I have to go through the y's.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can stay there if needed, but I want to go up.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=6.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=1 is T=6.\n\nThen y=2 at T=7, y=3 at T=8, y=4 at T=9, y=5 at T=10, y=6 at T=11.\n\nThen y=7 at T=12, y=8 at T=13, y=9 at T=14.\n\nSame as before, and I stayed at y=0 until T=5.\n\nAt T=5, I go to y=1 at T=6.\n\nBut from T=2 to T=4, I stayed, so actions at T=2,3,4: S,S,S then at T=5: U to y=1 at T=6.\n\nThen U at T=6 to y=2 at T=7, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at T=2, I stay: a_2=S, y_3=0\n\nT=3, I stay: a_3=S, y_4=0\n\nT=4, I stay: a_4=S, y_5=0\n\nT=5, U: a_5=U, y_6=1\n\nNow, at T=6, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nInstead of going directly up, can I go to another y? But I can only go to y=0 or y=2, but y=0 is down, not progress, or y=2.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at T=6: a_6=U, y_7=2\n\nBut y=2 is safe at T=7? At T=7, I am on y=2, which is safe since not occupied.\n\nThen from there, same as before.\n\nBut I still need to go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5 at T=10, as before.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied at T=6, but at T=10, not.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 earlier.\n\ny=5 is safe except T=2 and T=6.\n\nT=2 is start, we are not on it.\n\nT=6 occupied, so we can be on y=5 at other times, like T=3,4,5,7,etc.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=3, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=3, I need to come from y=4 or y=6 at T=2, but at T=2, I am at y=0.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=5 in one turn? Impossible, I can only move to y=1.\n\nSo I need multiple turns.\n\nFor example, to be on y=5 at T=3: that means at T=3, y_3=5.\n\ny_3=5, which came from y_2 + action a_2.\n\ny_2=0, so if a_2=U, y_3=1, not 5.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=5 at T=4: y_4=5, from y_3 + a_3.\n\ny_3 must be 4,5, or6, but at T=3, y_3 is at most 1 if I go up at T=2, but T=3 y=1 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf I stay, y_3=0.\n\nThen y_4=5? From y_3=0, a_3=U to y=1, or S to 0, or D not, cannot to 5.\n\nSo impossible to be on high y early.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=1 is T=6, as before.\n\nThen sequentially up.\n\nBut at T=6, when I am on y=1, I could go to y=0, but that wastes time.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother point: y=3 and y=4 are occupied only at T=4 and T=5, so after that, safe.\n\nBut to reach them, I need to come from lower y.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 faster by going through y=5 when it is safe.\n\nBut y=5 is safe except T=2 and T=6.\n\nSo at T=6 it is occupied, so I cannot be on y=5 at T=6.\n\nBut I can be at T=5 or T=7, etc.\n\nTo be on y=5 at T=5: y_5=5.\n\ny_5 from y_4 + a_4.\n\ny_4 from y_3 + a_3, etc.\n\nStart T=2, y=0.\n\nAt T=2, if a_2=U, y_3=1, but T=3 on y=1 occupied, collision, impossible.\n\nSo must a_2=S, y_3=0.\n\nT=3, y=0, a_3: if U, y_4=1, T=4 on y=1 occupied.\n\nIf S, y_4=0.\n\nT=4, y=0 or? If y=0, a_4: if U, y_5=1, T=5 on y=1 occupied.\n\nIf S, y_5=0.\n\nT=5, y=0, a_5: if U, y_6=1, T=6 on y=1 safe.\n\nSo at T=5, if I do U, I go to y=1 at T=6.\n\nBut if I want to be on y=5 at T=5, how? y_5=5, but from above, at T=5, if I start from y_2=0, and I stayed, y_5=0, or if I moved up but couldn't, so y_5=0 at best if I stay all.\n\nCannot be at y=5 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y_4=0.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=1 is T=6, as established.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=6, I can go to y=2 at T=7.\n\nThen to y=3 at T=8.\n\ny=3 safe at T=8.\n\nThen to y=4 at T=9.\n\ny=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at T=10.\n\nNow, at T=10, y=5, safe since not T=6.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=11.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=12, y=8 at T=13, y=9 at T=14.\n\nActions: T=2 to T=13: S (T=2), S (T=3), S (T=4), U (T=5), U (T=6), U (T=7), U (T=8), U (T=9), U (T=10), U (T=11), U (T=12), U (T=13)\n\nThat's 12 actions.\n\nBut at T=13, a_13=U to y=9 at T=14.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1=2 to t1+H-1=13, so H=12.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by going to y=6 via a different way.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 earlier, but I can't.\n\ny=6 is always safe, but I need to reach it.\n\nAnother idea: at some point, I can move down to avoid collision, but it might not help.\n\nFor example, suppose I go to y=1 at T=6, then instead of going up, I go down, but that wastes time.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 or y=4 directly, but I can't, only adjacent.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can save a turn.\n\nSuppose at T=6, I am on y=1, and I go to y=2 at T=7.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied at T=6, but I am not on it.\n\nNow, at T=10 I am on y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is also safe at T=7, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=7: y_7=5.\n\ny_7 from y_6 + a_6.\n\ny_6 from y_5 + a_5, etc.\n\nBut at T=6, I am on y=1 (if I went up at T=5).\n\ny_6=1.\n\nThen a_6: if U, y_7=2; if S, y_7=1; if D, to y=0.\n\nNone to y=5.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nTo be on y=5 at T=7, I need y_7=5, which requires y_6=4,5, or6.\n\nBut at T=6, I am on y=1, so y_6=1, so a_6 can only make y_7=0,1,2.\n\nNot 5.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 before T=10 in this path.\n\nSimilarly, earliest y=6 is T=11.\n\nThen y=9 at T=14.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 or y=7 earlier, but similarly constrained.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe after T=2.\n\nBut to reach them, I need to come from below.\n\nFor example, to be on y=7 at T=3: but y_3=7 impossible from y_2=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=12 is the best.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times again.\n\nFreeway 5 has occupation at T=2 and T=6.\n\nT=6 is occupied.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at T=10, not T=6.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nNow, but at T=12,13,14, y=1 and y=2 are occupied, but I am above, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5, there is a car at T=6, but I am on y=5 only at T=10, not at T=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly from lower, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe, I can go to y=5 at a time when y=5 is safe, then quickly to y=6.\n\nBut in my path, I do that.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=5 earlier than T=10.\n\nHow? Earliest y=1 at T=6, then y=2 T=7, y=3 T=8, y=4 T=9, y=5 T=10. That's 5 turns from y=1 to y=5, but since I start from y=0 at T=5 to y=1 at T=6, it takes until T=10 for y=5.\n\nT=6: y=1, T=7: y=2, T=8: y=3, T=9: y=4, T=10: y=5, T=11: y=6, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=1 at T=6, which required staying from T=2 to T=5.\n\nNow, total turns from start: at T=2, we begin; after actions at T=2 to T=13, 12 actions, at T=14 y=9.\n\nNumber of turns H=12.\n\nBut perhaps I can start moving earlier, but I can't because of the early occupation.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at T=2, I stay, but at T=3, instead of staying, I go down, but I can't, y=0 min.\n\nOr I go up but to collision, but I can't, collision not allowed.\n\nSo I must stay.\n\nPerhaps for y=1, I can be on it at other times, but T=3,4,5 are covered, and T=1 is before, but I start at T=2.\n\nAt T=1, I am not playing.\n\nSo I think it's fixed.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn my path: actions:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=2 at T=7)\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nAt turn T, action a_T.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = S  (stay, y remains 0, at T=3 y=0)\n\nTurn 3: a_3 = S  (stay, y=0 at T=4)\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = S  (stay, y=0 at T=5)\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = U  (up, to y=1 at T=6)\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U  (up, to y=2 at T=7)\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U  (to y=3 at T=8)\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U  (to y=4 at T=9)\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U  (to y=5 at T=10)\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U  (to y=6 at T=11)\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U  (to y=7 at T=12)\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U  (to y=8 at T=13)\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = U  (to y=9 at T=14)\n\nNow, H=12 actions, from t=2 to 13.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to list for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=2, H=12, so turns 2 to 13.\n\nAnd actions as above.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 faster.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=3 at T=6, but from start, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid y=1 and y=2 by going directly to y=3, but I can't, must go through.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, when I go to y=1, I could stay on y=1 for a while, but no need, I want to go up.\n\nBut in this case, I go up continuously.\n\nPerhaps at some point I can skip a level by moving faster, but I can only move one step.\n\nI think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the net: from y=0 to y=9, need 9 up moves, and I have 3 stay at beginning, so total 12 actions.\n\nIf I can reduce the stay, but I can't because of the occupation.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways.\n\nFor example, y=3 and y=4 are only occupied at T=4 and T=5, so after that, I can go through quickly.\n\nBut to reach y=3, I need to be at y=2 first, which I reach at T=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nNow, for the sequence, as above.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nIn my path, I pass through all.\n\nPerhaps I can go from y=5 to y=6 to y=7, but y=5 at T=10, etc.\n\nAnother point: at T=6, y=5 is occupied, but since I am not on it, fine.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point I have collision.\n\nFor example, at T=6, I am on y=1, which is freeway 1, at T=6: not occupied, safe.\n\nT=7, y=2, freeway 2, T=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nT=8, y=3, freeway 3, occupied only at T=4,5, T=8 safe.\n\nT=9, y=4, freeway 4, same, safe.\n\nT=10, y=5, freeway 5, occupied at T=2 and T=6, T=10 not, safe.\n\nT=11, y=6, freeway 6, no cars, safe.\n\nT=12, y=7, freeway 7, occupied only at T=2, safe.\n\nT=13, y=8, freeway 8, occupied only at T=2, safe.\n\nT=14, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd at the beginning, T=2,3,4,5 at y=0, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nAnd reached at T=14 with 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose H=11, then actions from T=2 to T=12, and at T=13, y=9.\n\ny_{13}=9.\n\nSince net +9, must have 9 up and 2 other actions (stay or down, but down not useful).\n\nSo either 9U and 2S, or 10U and 1D, but D would decrease y, so need more U, worse.\n\nSo best 9U and 2S.\n\nNow, with 2S, we save one turn compared to 3S.\n\nBut can we?\n\nFor example, if we can go to y=1 earlier, but we can't because of occupation.\n\nSuppose we stay only two times at start.\n\nFor example, at T=2, S: y_3=0\n\nT=3, S: y_4=0\n\nBut then at T=4, if we go U, y_5=1, but T=5 on y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=4 we stay, y_5=0, then at T=5 U to y=6=1, same as before, but we used S at T=4, which is extra.\n\nWith only two S, we must have actions.\n\nStart: T=2, y=0\n\nAfter 11 actions, at T=13, y=9.\n\ny_{13}=9.\n\ny_2=0\n\nAfter action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\n...\n\ny_13 = y_12 + Δy_12\n\nSince y_13=9, and y_2=0, the sum of Δy from T=2 to T=12 must be +9.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D must be 9, and U + D + S =11.\n\nSince U - D =9, U + D + S =11, add: 2U + S =20, so S=20-2U, which must be non-negative.\n\nU <=10.\n\nSubtract: 2D + S =2, so possible D=0, S=2 or D=1, S=0.\n\nIf D=1, S=0, then U -1 =9, U=10, then U+D+S=10+1+0=11, yes.\n\nIf D=0, S=2, U=9, U+S=11.\n\nD=1,S=0,U=10 or D=0,S=2,U=9.\n\nNow, the path must avoid collision.\n\nEarliest we can be on y=1 is T=6.\n\nIf we are on y=1 at T=6, then we need to reach y=9 by T=13.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=6 to y=9 at T=13, that's 7 turns: T=6 to T=13, but at T=6 we are at y=1, we need to be at y=9 at T=13.\n\nAfter actions at T=6 to T=12, 7 actions, to go from y=1 to y=9, need +8, so possible with 8U, but 7 actions, so must have at least 8 up in 7 actions? Impossible.\n\nAt T=6, after action a_6, we go to y_7.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAt T=6, we are at y_6.\n\nThen we choose a_6, go to y_7, and so on, up to choose a_12, go to y_13.\n\nTo have y_13=9.\n\ny_6 is at least 1, at T=6.\n\nIf y_6=1, then from y_6=1 to y_13=9, we need y_13 - y_6 =8, so over 7 actions (from T=6 to T=12), we need sum Δy = +8.\n\nBut each action Δy <=1, so in 7 actions, maximum increase 7, to y=8, not 9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 from y=1 in 7 actions.\n\ny_6 to y_13: actions at T=6 to T=12, that's 7 actions, determine y_7 to y_13.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\n...\n\ny_13 = y_12 + Δy_12\n\nSo y_13 = y_6 + sum_{t=6 to 12} Δy_t\n\nTo have y_13=9, y_6 + sum =9.\n\nSince y_6 >=1, sum <=8? sum of 7 Δy, each <=1, so y_13 <= y_6 +7 <=1+7=8 <9, impossible.\n\ny_6 <=? y_6 could be higher, but in this case, at T=6, earliest y_6=1, so y_6=1, then y_13 <=1+7=8<9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nIf we can be on higher y at T=6.\n\nBut earlier, we cannot be on y>1 at T=6 because to be on y=2 at T=6, we need y_6=2, which requires from y_5, etc., but y_5 at T=5 is at most 0, since we start low.\n\nAt T=5, y_5=0 if we stayed, so y_6 <=1.\n\nThus at T=6, y_6 <=1, and since we can be on y=1, y_6=1.\n\nThen y_13 <= y_6 +7 =1+7=8<9, impossible to reach y=9 by T=13.\n\nTherefore, with H=11 actions, ending at T=13, we cannot reach y=9 because from T=6 to T=13 is only 7 turns, from y=1 to at most y=8.\n\nT=6 to T=13: actions at T=6 to T=12 (7 actions) to go from y_6 to y_13.\n\ny_6=1, y_13 <=1+7=8.\n\nBut we need y_13=9, impossible.\n\nIf we can have y_6>1, but we can't.\n\nTherefore, minimal H must be at least 12, and we have a path with H=12.\n\nSo it is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nt1=2.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 6: U to go to y=2?

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y where there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=3, and they move at constant speed based on their direction and speed. Since all cars are moving right, according to the data, the span for right-moving cars is updated as [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], where τ is tail and h is head. In the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Let me check the values.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4). If it's moving right and head is -36, tail is -47, since -36 > -47, that makes sense; head is to the right of tail. Then at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 4(T-3), -36 + 4(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y that the player is on, there is a car such that 0 is in the interval [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for that car.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, y_t, so for collision at turn T, we need y_T = k for some freeway k, and 0 in the span of some car on freeway k at time T.\n\nSince the player starts at (0,0) at t=3, and we need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so we don't have to worry about collision at y=0 or y=9, only on y=1 to 8 when we're there.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0 at t=3, and we need to get to y=9 as fast as possible, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars on the rows when we cross them.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, which is 9 steps up, but we can stay or go down, so H could be more than 9 if we have to wait.\n\nBut since we can only move one step per turn, the minimum possible H is 9, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, but we have to check if that causes a collision on the freeways.\n\nSo let's simulate that: start at t=3, y=0.\n\nAction at t=3: U, so at t=4, y=1.\n\nBut at t=4, when we are on y=1, we need to check if at that turn, for freeway 1, if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for each step.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1=3. Set τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, t=t1=3, player at y=0.\n\nThen we need to find actions for τ=0 to τ=H-1, such that at τ=H-1, y = 9.\n\nSince at τ=0, y=0, and each action changes y for the next turn.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we have done H turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1, that's H turns.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=t1=3, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at t=t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo after H actions? Let's see.\n\nWe start at turn t1 with y_{t1}.\n\nWe apply a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nThen apply a_{t1+1}, at t1+2, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} = something.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1+H} = 9? No.\n\nThe position is reached at the turn when we are there.\n\nWe are at (0,9) at turn T when y_T = 9.\n\nAt turn t1=3, we are at y=0.\n\nWe want for some turn T >= t1, y_T = 9.\n\nT is the turn when we arrive at y=9.\n\nThe number of turns from t1 to T is T - t1.\n\nDuring turns t1 to T-1, we take actions that change our position to reach y_T=9.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y=0, we take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{T-1}, which determines y_T.\n\nSo to have y_T = 9, we need to take actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=T-1, that's T - t1 actions.\n\nAnd we want to minimize H = T - t1, the number of actions, or the number of turns from start to arrival?\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo, actions for t from t1 to t1 + H - 1? Indices.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen, after these H actions, at turn t1 + H, the position is y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H - 1} at turn t1 + H - 1, we move to y_{t1 + H} at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H - 1, y = 9.\n\nNow, at turn t1, y = 0.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after these actions, at turn t1+H, we are somewhere, but we care about turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe change in y from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 is due to the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? Let's think.\n\nPosition at turn t: y_t\n\nAction at t: a_t, affects y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} = 0\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAt turn t1 + k, y_{t1+k} = y_{t1} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{t1+i}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\n\nSince y_{t1} = 0, we need sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1+i} = 9? Let's see.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = y_{t1} + sum_{i=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1+i} = 0 + sum from i=0 to H-2 of Δy_{t1+i}\n\nAnd this equals 9.\n\nThe actions are from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, but the Δy for y_{t1+H-1} comes from actions up to a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nFor y_{t1+H-1}, it is determined by actions up to a_{t1+H-2}, because a_{t1+H-2} affects y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThe last action that affects y_{t1+H-1} is a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nThen a_{t1+H-1} affects y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nIn the sum, y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1} + sum_{j=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1+j}\n\nSince y_{t1} = 0, we need sum_{j=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t1+j} = 9\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0, so the net up movement must be 9, with possible downs or stays, so the number of U actions minus D actions from j=0 to H-2 must be 9.\n\nThe actions from t1 to t1+H-2 affect the position at t1+H-1.\n\nThen there is an action at t1+H-1, which is taken, but it doesn't change the position at t1+H-1, it changes the future position.\n\nFor the position at t1+H-1 to be 9, we need the actions from t1 to t1+H-2 to have a net +9 in y.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, if we do all U, no down or stay.\n\nBut we may need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be larger.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nSince we need to check for each turn T and each freeway k, if the player is on k at T, whether there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nBut only for k=1 to 8.\n\nAt T, y_T = k, and we need no collision on k at T.\n\nThe car span at time T is based on initial at t1=3.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with head h, tail τ, dir d, speed s at t1=3.\n\nSince all d=right, we can omit d.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] for right-moving.\n\nThen collision if 0 is in [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)].\n\nSince the car is on the freeway, and the player is at x=0, so if 0 is in the car's span, collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have multiple cars, so we need to check for any car on that row at time T.\n\nAlso, note that the cars are moving, so their positions change over time.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-36, -47, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4)\n\nFor first car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, s=4\n\nAt time T, span [ -47 + 4(T-3), -36 + 4(T-3) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0, -11, right, 4), so τ=-11, h=0, s=4, span [ -11 +4(T-3), 0 +4(T-3) ] = [4(T-3) -11, 4(T-3)]\n\nThird car: (36, 25, right, 4), τ=25, h=36, s=4, span [25 +4(T-3), 36 +4(T-3)] = [4(T-3)+25, 4(T-3)+36]\n\nFreeway 2 is the same as freeway 1: cars identical, so same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6, span [-59 +6(T-3), -48 +6(T-3)]\n\nSecond: τ=19, h=30, s=6, span [19+6(T-3), 30+6(T-3)]\n\nThird: τ=-17, h=-6, s=6, span [-17+6(T-3), -6+6(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nFirst: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, span [-47+12(T-3), -36+12(T-3)]\n\nSecond: τ=37, h=48, s=12, span [37+12(T-3), 48+12(T-3)]\n\nThird: τ=1, h=12, s=12, span [1+12(T-3), 12+12(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 6: (57, 46, right, 3)  only one car, τ=46, h=57, s=3, span [46+3(T-3), 57+3(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 7: (24, 1, right, 24)  τ=1, h=24, s=24, span [1+24(T-3), 24+24(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (24,1,right,24)\n\nNow, we need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at time T.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T, collision if for any car on k, 0 ∈ [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)]\n\nWhich means τ + s(T-3) <= 0 <= h + s(T-3)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ <= h, so the interval is [left, right] with left <= right.\n\nSo 0 >= left and 0 <= right.\n\nSo for each car, we can solve for T when 0 is covered.\n\nBut T is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nWe can find for each car the times T where it covers 0.\n\nThen for each freeway, the set of T where at least one car covers 0.\n\nThen when the player is on that freeway at that T, collision.\n\nPlayer is on freeway k at time T only if y_T = k.\n\nNow, for the player, we start at t=3, y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car is covering 0.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=3, and y=0 has no cars, we can take action immediately.\n\nLet me first find for each freeway, the times when there is a collision, i.e., 0 is covered by some car.\n\nSince multiple cars, find for each k the set of T where collision occurs on k.\n\nFreeway 1:\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: span [ -47 +4(T-3), -36 +4(T-3) ] = [4T-12-47, 4T-12-36] = [4T-59, 4T-48] since -12-47= -59, -12-36=-48.\n\n4(T-3) =4T-12, so span: [4T-12 -47, 4T-12 -36] = [4T-59, 4T-48]\n\n0 in [4T-59, 4T-48] iff 4T-59 <= 0 <= 4T-48\n\nWhich is 4T-59 <= 0 and 0 <= 4T-48\n\nSo 4T <=59 and 4T >=48\n\nT <= 59/4 = 14.75, T <=14 since T integer?

T=6: 12*6=72, 72-83=-11, 72-72=0, so [12T-83,12T-72] at T=6: [72-83,72-72]=[-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=7: [84-83,84-72]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT<=6 and T>=6, so only T=6.\n\n12T >=72, T>=6, and 12T <=83, T<=6.916, so T=6.\n\nSecond car: τ=37, h=48, s=12, span [37+12(T-3), 48+12(T-3)] = [12T-36+37, 12T-36+48] = [12T+1, 12T+12] >0, no 0.\n\nThird car: τ=1, h=12, s=12, span [1+12(T-3), 12+12(T-3)] = [12T-36+1, 12T-36+12] = [12T-35, 12T-24]\n\n0 in [12T-35,12T-24] iff 12T-35 <=0 <=12T-24\n\n12T <=35, T<=35/12≈2.916, T<=2\n\nBut T>=3, since t1=3, T>t1? T is the turn, can be t1 or later, but at T=3, let's see.\n\n12T-35 <=0 => T<=35/12=2.916, so T<=2\n\nBut T is turn, starting from t1=3, so for T>=3, 12T-35 >= 12*3-35=36-35=1>0, so left >0, 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, 12T-24 >=36-24=12>0.\n\nAt T=2, but T=2<3, not in our time frame, so for T>=3, no 0 in third car span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only collision at T=6 from first car.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (57,46,right,3), span [46+3(T-3), 57+3(T-3)] = [3T-9+46, 3T-9+57] = [3T+37, 3T+48]\n\nSince T>=3, 3T+37>=9+37=46>0, so 0 not in, no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 7: (24,1,right,24), span [1+24(T-3), 24+24(T-3)] = [24T-72+1, 24T-72+24] = [24T-71, 24T-48]\n\n0 in [24T-71,24T-48] iff 24T-71 <=0 <=24T-48\n\n24T <=71, T<=71/24≈2.958, T<=2\n\n24T >=48, T>=2\n\nSo T=2, but T=2<3, not in our range.

No collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same, no collision.\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: collision at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: same, T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: collision at T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=4: same, T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=5: collision at T=6\n\ny=6: no collision\n\ny=7: no collision\n\ny=8: no collision\n\ny=6,7,8 have no collision at any time, so we can be on them safely at any turn.\n\ny=5 has collision only at T=6.\n\ny=3 and y=4 have collisions at T=4,5,11,12.\n\ny=1 and y=2 have collisions at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nNow, player starts at t=3, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_final, with minimal H = T_final - 3? Since at t=3, y=0, and at turn T, y=9, so H = T - 3? Number of turns from t=3 to T inclusive? But turns.\n\nAt turn t=3, position is set.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, with t1=3.\n\nSo let T = t1 + H - 1 = 3 + H - 1, so y_T =9 at turn T.\n\nThen T - 3 = H - 1.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nBut let's think of the sequence.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 at t=3 to y=9 at some T.\n\nThe minimal T is t=12, since at t=3 we are at 0, and need 9 steps, so earliest T=12 if all up.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nNow, let's list the turns we need to cross each row.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=3, and we move to higher y.\n\nWe need to be on each freeway k for some turn when we are there, and that turn should not be a collision time for k.\n\nAlso, since we can move up, down, or stay, we can delay or advance when we are on a row.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible, except when we need to avoid.\n\nNow, the critical points are the rows with collisions.\n\nFirst, y=1 and y=2 have collisions at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=0, not on y=1.\n\nIf we move up at t=3, we go to y=1 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or down, we stay at y=0 or go to y=-1, but y must be >=0, so we can't go below 0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we can be on them anytime.\n\ny=5 has collision only at T=6, so we should not be on y=5 at T=6.\n\ny=3 and y=4 have collisions at T=4,5,11,12, so avoid those times.\n\ny=1 and y=2 have collisions at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nT=3: but at T=3, we are at y=0, so for y=1, the first possible time we can be on it is t=4 if we move up at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at earliest t=5, etc.\n\nNow, let's consider going up directly.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn from t=3.\n\nStart t=3, y=0\n\na_t=3: U, then at t=4, y=1\n\nBut at t=4, y=1, and collision on y=1 at T=4? From above, y=1 collision at T=4, yes.\n\nSo if we are on y=1 at t=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we do S at t=3, stay at y=0 at t=4? Action at t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=3, if a_3=S, then y_4 = y_3 +0 =0, so at t=4, y=0.\n\nThen we can do a_4=U, to go to y=1 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1, and collision on y=1 at T=5? Yes, T=5 is collision for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, if we go later.\n\ny=1 collision times: 3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nBut T=3 we can't be on y=1 since we start at y=0.\n\nEarliest to be on y=1 is t=4.\n\nt=4,5 collision, so we cannot be on y=1 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nNext possible time without collision: after T=5, the next collision is T=12,13,14.\n\nSo between T=6 to T=11, y=1 is safe? T=6 to 11.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, same collision times, so safe T=6 to 11.\n\nNow y=3 collision at T=4,5,11,12\n\nSafe when? T=6,7,8,9,10? T=4,5,11,12 collision, so safe for T=6,7,8,9,10 and T<4 or T>12, but T>=3, and T=3: at T=3, we are at y=0, not y=3, so for y=3, safe turns: T=6,7,8,9,10\n\nSimilarly y=4 same, safe T=6,7,8,9,10\n\ny=5 collision only at T=6, so safe for T≠6, e.g., T=5,7,8,... but T=5: at T=5, can we be on y=5? If we go up fast.\n\ny=5 safe except T=6.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 have a safe window from t=6 to t=11, we should be on them during that time.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 safe from t=6 to t=10.\n\nt=6 to 10 inclusive.\n\ny=3 and y=4 safe at T=6,7,8,9,10.\n\ny=5 safe except T=6.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=3, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe constraining rows are y=1 and y=2, which must be visited between t=6 and t=11.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 must be between t=6 and t=10, but since we need to go through them, and y=1,2 before.\n\ny=1 and y=2 need to be crossed during safe times.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nWe can stay at y=0 for a few turns until it's safe to move.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, no issue.\n\nThen when we move up.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we should not stay too long.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=1 is t=6, since before that t=4,5 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, earliest on y=2 is t=7? Let's see.\n\nIf we are at y=0 at some turn, we can go up to y=1 next turn.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, suppose at t=3, we are at y=0.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay, at t=4, y=0.\n\nStill at y=0.\n\nThen at t=4, we can do U, to go to y=1 at t=5.\n\nBut t=5, y=1, collision, not good.\n\nDo S at t=3, y=4=0.\n\nThen at t=4, do S again, y=5=0.\n\nThen at t=5, do U, y=6=1 at t=6.\n\nt=6, y=1, which is safe, since y=1 safe at t=6.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut let's list the turns we are on each row.\n\nWe need to have y_T for T from 3 onwards.\n\nStart T=3: y=0\n\nWe want to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal T when we can be on y=9.\n\nSince y=1 must be at T>=6 and T<=11.\n\nSimilarly y=2 at T>=? Earliest to be on y=1 is T=6, as above.\n\nIf we go up at T=5, to be on y=1 at T=6.\n\nAt T=5, where are we?\n\nAt T=3, y=0.\n\nAction a_3: if S, then T=4, y=0\n\na_4: if S, T=5, y=0\n\na_5: U, then T=6, y=1\n\nYes.\n\nIf we do U earlier, but if a_3=U, T=4, y=1, collision.\n\na_3=D? But y=0, D would go to y=-1, not allowed, since y in [0,9], so Δy: if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1}=0, I assume, since it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at boundary, it might stay, but the movement: Δy = -1 if D, but if y=0, y+Δy=-1 not in [0,9], so probably it stays or something? The game dynamics don't specify, but it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if action would take it out, it should stay or be clamped.\n\nI think we should assume that if action would cause y<0 or y>9, it stays at boundary.\n\nFor example, if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSo in this case, since we start at y=0, D and S both keep y=0.\n\nOnly U increases y.\n\nSimilarly at y=9.\n\nBut here we are at bottom.\n\nSo back to path.\n\nTo avoid collision on y=1 at early times, we need to stay at y=0 until we can go up safely.\n\nEarliest safe for y=1 is T=6.\n\nSo we should be at y=1 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2, we can be at T=7 or later, but since safe from T=6 to11, T=7 is fine.\n\nNow, from y=1 at T=6, we can go to y=2 at T=7, then to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 has safe times T=6 to10.\n\nT=6 is safe for y=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, y=5 has a problem at T=6.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5 at T=6.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart T=3: y=0\n\nWe need to have y_6 =1, to be safe on y=1.\n\ny_6=1 means at turn 6, position y=1.\n\nTo achieve that, from y_3=0.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nSince y_6 depends on actions at t=3,4,5.\n\ny_t+1 = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nWe want y_6=1.\n\nSince y_3=0, we need Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5 =1\n\nEach Δy is 0 or +1 or -1, but since we start at 0, and y>=0, and we want to go up, probably Δy >=0.\n\nSo to have sum of three actions =1, meaning net one up, so for example, two S and one U, or one U and one D and one S, but since D might not be useful, better to have S,S,U or S,U,S or U,S,S.\n\nNow, at T=3, if we do U, y_4=1, but then at T=4, y=1, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we do S at T=3, y_4=0\n\nThen if S at T=4, y_5=0\n\nThen U at T=5, y_6=1\n\nYes.\n\nIf we do U at T=4 or something, but let's see.\n\nSo one way: at T=3, S; T=4, S; T=5, U; then y_6=1.\n\nNow at T=6, y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow from here, we can go up.\n\nNext, we need to go to y=2.\n\nWe can do U at T=6, so y_7=2.\n\nAt T=7, y=2.\n\nIs T=7 safe for y=2? Yes, since y=2 safe at T=7 (between 6 and 11).\n\nSimilarly, then U at T=7, y_8=3.\n\nAt T=8, y=3.\n\ny=3 safe at T=8? Yes, T=8 is in 6-10.\n\nThen U at T=8, y_9=4.\n\nAt T=9, y=4, safe? T=9, y=4 safe, yes.\n\nThen U at T=9, y_10=5.\n\nAt T=10, y=5.\n\nNow y=5, collision at T=6, but T=10, not 6, so safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go up to y=6,7,8,9.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nSo U at T=10, y_11=6\n\nU at T=11, y_12=7\n\nU at T=12, y_13=8\n\nU at T=13, y_14=9\n\nAt T=14, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we reached at T=14.\n\nBut H is such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9, t1=3, so y_{3 + H -1} =9\n\nAt T=14, y=9, so 3 + H -1 =14, so 2 + H =14, H=12.\n\nH-1 =11? 3 + H -1 =14, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=3 to t=14? Actions at t=3 to t=13? Let's list.\n\nWe have actions from τ=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nSet τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, t=3.\n\nActions a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + τ is y_{t1+τ}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9\n\nIn this case, at turn t=14, y=9, so t1 + (H-1) =14, t1=3, so 3 + H -1 =14, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from τ=0 to 11, that is t=3 to t=14? τ=0 to 11, t=3 to 3+11=14? t1+τ =3+τ, for τ=0 to 11, t=3 to 14.\n\nBut action at t affects y_{t+1}, so at t=14, action a_14, but in the sequence, we have actions up to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{14}, which determines y_{15}, but we don't care.\n\ny at turn t1+H-1=14 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have:\n\nAt t=3: action S (since we stayed)\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U → y=1 at t=6\n\nt=6: U → y=2 at t=7\n\nt=7: U → y=3 at t=8\n\nt=8: U → y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: U → y=5 at t=10\n\nt=10: U → y=6 at t=11\n\nt=11: U → y=7 at t=12\n\nt=12: U → y=8 at t=13\n\nt=13: U → y=9 at t=14\n\nWe need actions from t=3 to t=13? Actions that affect up to y_{14}.\n\ny_{14} depends on actions up to a_{13}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=3 to t=13.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=3, H=12, so actions from t=3 to t=3+12-1=14? t1+H-1=3+12-1=14.\n\nSo actions at t=3 to t=14.\n\nBut in our sequence, we have actions at t=3 to t=13 to reach y_{14}=9.\n\nAfter a_{13} at t=13, we have y_{14}=9.\n\nBut the action sequence includes a_{14}, but since we are at y=9, we can do anything, but we need to specify for H actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have 11 actions: from t=3 to t=13, that's 11 actions? t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 11 actions.\n\nt=3 to t=13 inclusive is 11 turns: 13-3+1=11.\n\nBut H should be such that we have H actions.\n\nAt turn t=3, we start, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a3, y4.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{t1 + k} = y_{3+k}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + (H-1)} = y_{3 + H -1} =9\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{3+H}\n\nBut we set y_{3+H-1}=9\n\nIn terms of actions: after 0 actions, at t=3, y3=0\n\nAfter 1 action (a3), at t=4, y4\n\nAfter 2 actions (a3,a4), at t=5, y5\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=3+k, y_{3+k}\n\nWe want at some m = H-1, after m actions, position at turn t=3+m is 9.\n\nSet m = H-1, so after m actions, y_{3+m} =9.\n\nBut m = H-1, so y_{3 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we have H actions: from a3 to a_{3+H-1}\n\nFor example, if we reach y=9 at turn T, then T = 3 + H -1, so H = T - 2? Since T = 3 + H -1, so H = T - 2? 3 + H -1 = T, so H = T - 2.\n\nT=14, H=12.\n\nIn our sequence, we reached y=9 at t=14, with actions from t=3 to t=13? Actions a3 to a13, that's 11 actions, which affect y4 to y14.\n\nAfter 11 actions (a3 to a13), we have y_{3+11} = y14=9.\n\nSo m=11, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen the actions are a3 to a_{3+11} = a14.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have actions up to a13, which sets y14=9.\n\nThen we need to include a14, but a14 is not needed, since we are already at y=9, but for the sequence, we have to provide H actions, so a14 can be S or U, but since y=9, U might not change, or S.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify the actions for t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=12, so actions at t=3 to t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, we are already at y=9, so a14 can be arbitrary, say S.\n\nIn the sequence, we can set a14=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the path above, we have a3 to a13.\n\nBut let's list with times.\n\nAt t=3: action S, then y4=0\n\nt=4: S, y5=0\n\nt=5: U, y6=1\n\nt=6: U, y7=2\n\nt=7: U, y8=3\n\nt=8: U, y9=4\n\nt=9: U, y10=5\n\nt=10: U, y11=6\n\nt=11: U, y12=7\n\nt=12: U, y13=8\n\nt=13: U, y14=9\n\nNow, for H=12, we need actions up to t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, we can do S, for example.\n\nThen y15=9, but we don't care.\n\nNow, is this minimal H? H=12, but we reached at t=14.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe stayed at y=0 for two turns, t=4 and t=5, but at t=5 we did U to go to y=1 at t=6.\n\nWe could go faster to the safe zone.\n\nFor example, can we be on y=1 earlier? But t=4 and t=5 unsafe, so no.\n\nt=6 is earliest safe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2, we are at t=7, which is fine.\n\nBut y=3,4 we are at t=8 and9, which are safe.\n\ny=5 at t=10, safe.\n\nBut we have y=6,7,8 to go, which take three turns.\n\nTotal from start: at t=3, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, at t=6, y=1; t=7,y=2; t=8,y=3; t=9,y=4; t=10,y=5; t=11,y=6; t=12,y=7; t=13,y=8; t=14,y=9.\n\n9 steps from y=0 to y=9, but started at t=3, ended t=14, 11 turns later? From t=3 to t=14, 11 intervals, but 12 turns including start.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=3 to t=14 inclusive is 12 turns, but positions from t=3 to t=14.\n\nWe need to reach earlier.\n\nBut y=1 cannot be before t=6, so y=1 at t=6 is earliest.\n\nThen y=9 at least at t=6 + 8 =14, since 8 more steps? From y=1 to y=9, need 8 moves up, so at least 8 turns after, so from t=6 to t=14, 8 turns, but at t=6 y=1, at t=7 y=2, ..., t=14 y=9, yes, 9 positions, 8 steps.\n\nt=6 to t=14 is 9 turns, but y from 1 to 9.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=3, to y=9 at t=14, that seems minimal given the constraints.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 earlier if we can be on y=1 later but go faster through upper rows.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay longer at y=0, but that would delay, not help.\n\nOr, we can go to y=1 at t=6, then go up faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so we need at least 8 turns from y=1 to y=9.\n\ny=1 at t=6 to y=9 at t=14 is minimum time.\n\nBut y=1 at t=6, y=2 at t=7, etc., up to y=9 at t=14.\n\nIn this, at t=12, we are on y=7, but y=1 has collision at t=12, but we are not on y=1 at t=12, we are on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut we have a problem with y=5 at T=6, but in this path, we are on y=5 at t=10, not t=6.\n\nt=10 is fine.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=6, but then for y=3, we can be at t=6? But we are at y=1 at t=6, we need to go through y=2.\n\nAt t=6, y=1, if we go U, y=2 at t=7.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nUnless we go faster, but we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 are always safe, and y=5 safe except t=6, we can go directly to higher rows if possible.\n\nBut we start from low.\n\nWe can go up to y=0 and stay, then go to y=1 at t=6, same as before.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=1 at a later safe time, but that would be worse.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=1 at t=11, but then we have to go up to y=9, which takes more time.\n\nSo t=6 is best.\n\nBut in our path, we have to go through y=3 and y=4, which have safe times only up to t=10.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=3 at t=8, y=4 at t=9, both within 6 to10.\n\nIf we delay, we might miss the safe window for y=3 and y=4.\n\nFor example, if we go slower, we might be on y=3 after t=10, but t=11 and12 are unsafe for y=3.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nSimilarly y=4 unsafe t=11,12.\n\nSo we must be on y=3 and y=4 by t=10 at latest.\n\nIn our path, we are at y=4 at t=9, which is fine.\n\nCan we be on y=3 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go to y=1 at t=6, y=2 at t=7, y=3 at t=8, as before.\n\nIf we could go to y=2 faster, but from y=0, we can only reach y=2 at earliest t=5, but t=5 is unsafe for y=2.\n\ny=2 collision at t=5.\n\nEarliest safe for y=2 is t=6? But at t=6, we can be on y=1 or y=2?\n\nIf at t=5, we are at y= something.\n\nSuppose at t=3, S, y4=0\n\nt=4, U? But if a4=U, y5=1, but t=5 y=1 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na4=S, y5=0, then a5=U, y6=1, same as before.\n\nNo way to be on y=2 before t=7, I think.\n\nAt t=6, we can be on y=1 (if we go from y=0).\n\nThen to y=2 at t=7.\n\nCannot be on y=2 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at earliest t=8.\n\nThen y=4 at t=9, y=5 at t=10, etc.\n\nSo seems t=14 is earliest for y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision for y=5 at other times.\n\ny=5 only unsafe at t=6, so t=10 is fine.\n\nIn the path, at t=12, we are on y=7, and y=1 has collision at t=12, but we are not on y=1, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we have freeway 6,7,8 safe, but we still need to cross them.\n\nPerhaps we can go down or something, but that would take more time, not less.\n\nSo H=12 seems minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, we have two S at t=3 and t=4, then U from t=5 to t=13.\n\nActions: t=3:S, t=4:S, t=5:U, t=6:U, t=7:U, t=8:U, t=9:U, t=10:U, t=11:U, t=12:U, t=13:U\n\nThen y14=9.\n\nFor H=12, we need 12 actions, including a14.\n\nSo a14 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we can add a14=S.\n\nNow, but we need to output the actions for t=t1 to t1+H-1, which is t=3 to t=14.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a3 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a4 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a5 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +11: a14 = ? \n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=12, t from 0 to 11.\n\nt1 + t: for t=0, t1+0=3; t=1, t1+1=4; ... t=11, t1+11=14.\n\nActions: a3, a4, ..., a14.\n\nIn our sequence, a3=S, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, and a14 we need to set, say S.\n\nBut a13=U, which sets y14=9, and a14 doesn't affect y14, but we need to provide it.\n\nIn the sequence, we can set a14 to S.\n\nNow, but we have 12 actions, and we reached at turn t=14.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to y=5 before t=6 or after, but t=6 unsafe.\n\nIn our case, we go at t=10.\n\nBut we can go to y=5 at t=5? But t=5, y=5, is it safe? y=5 collision only at t=6, so t=5 should be safe.\n\ny=5 safe except t=6.\n\nAt t=5, if we can be on y=5, it should be safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=3, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=5.\n\ny5 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4\n\ny3=0, so need Δy3 + Δy4 =5\n\nBut each Δy <=1, so maximum y5= y3 +1 +1 =2, if U at t=3 and U at t=4.\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3 <=1\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4 <=2\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=5 from y=0 at t=3 in two steps.\n\nEarliest y=5 is t=8, if all U: t=3 U, y4=1 but collision; if we avoid, earliest y=1 at t=6, then y=5 at t=10 as before.\n\nt=6 y=1, t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3, t=9 y=4, t=10 y=5, so t=10.\n\nIf we could be on y=3 at t=6, but from y=0, cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps use down moves, but that would not help to go faster.\n\nSo I think t=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the safe times for y=3 and y=4.\n\ny=3 safe at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=3 at t=8, which is fine.\n\nIf we can be on y=3 at t=6, but how?\n\nTo be on y=3 at t=6, need from t=3 to t=6.\n\ny6 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 =0 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nSet to 3.\n\nSo need three U, but with constraints.\n\nIf a3=U, y4=1, but at t=4 y=1 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na3=S, y4=0\n\na4=U, y5=1, but at t=5 y=1 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na3=S, a4=S, a5=U, y6=1, as before.\n\nCannot be higher at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, so must be y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut in the actions, we have to list for H turns.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 7 and 8 with fast cars, but no collision, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, we can write.\n\nBut let's confirm for y=4 at t=9.\n\ny=4 collision at t=4,5,11,12.\n\nt=9 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for example, freeway 1 at T=3, but we not on it.\n\nAnother thing: at t=6, when we are on y=1, is it safe? t=6, y=1 collision times were 3,4,5,12,13,14, t=6 not in, so yes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: S   (which is t=3)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S   (t=4)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U   (t=5)\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U   (t=6)\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U   (t=7)\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U   (t=8)\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U   (t=9)\n\nTurn t_1 +7: U   (t=10)\n\nTurn t_1 +8: U   (t=11)\n\nTurn t_1 +9: U   (t=12)\n\nTurn t_1 +10: U   (t=13)\n\nTurn t_1 +11: S   (t=14)  // since at y=9, we can stay, or U but y=9, so S or U same.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 11 for actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 3: S  \nTurn 4: S  \nTurn 5: U  \nTurn 6: U  \nTurn 7: U  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \nTurn 11: U  \nTurn 12: U  \nTurn 13: U  \nTurn 14: S  \n}\n\nBut H=12, turns from t=3 to t=14.\n\nIn the box, it should list the actions for each turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for turn 3 to 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 14, we set S, but it's not necessary, but we have to include since H actions.\n\nPerhaps we can make H smaller by not including the last action, but the position is reached at turn t=14 with y=9, and we need actions up to a13 to set it, a14 is extra.\n\nBut according to the problem, we need to specify H actions, and y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, with H=12, y_{3+12-1}=y_{14}=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=3 to t=14.\n\nTo save one turn, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=9 at t=13.\n\nThen y_{13}=9.\n\nThen H-1 such that 3 + H -1 =13, so H=11.\n\nThen actions from t=3 to t=13? t1 to t1+H-1=3 to 13.\n\nThen y_{t1+H-1}=y_{13}=9.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nTo have y13=9.\n\nFrom y3=0, need to increase y by 9 in 10 steps? From t=3 to t=13, the actions from a3 to a12 affect y4 to y13.\n\ny13 = y3 + sum_{i=3}^{12} Δy_i?

From t=6 to t=13.\n\nAt t=6, y=1\n\nActions a6 to a12 determine y7 to y13.\n\ny13 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + ... + Δy12\n\nSet to 9.\n\ny6=1, so need sum_{i=6}^{12} Δy_i =8\n\nThere are 7 actions: a6 to a12.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so maximum increase 7, so y13 <= y6 +7 =8 <9, impossible.\n\ny6=1, after 7 actions, y13 <=1+7=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=13, we must be at y=1 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=5, but t=5 y=1 collision, not possible.\n\nAt t=4, y=1 collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=1 before t=6.\n\nThus, y=1 at t=6 at best.\n\nThen y13 <=1 + (13-6) =1+7=8, since from t=6 to t=13, 7 turns later, y increases by at most 7.\n\nt=6 to t=13 is 7 steps: y7 to y13, 7 positions, but y at t=6, after 0 actions, y6.\n\nAfter 1 action (a6), y7\n\nAfter 2 actions (a6,a7), y8\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 actions (a6 to a12), y13.\n\ny13 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{12} Δy_k <= y6 + 7\n\nSince y6=1, y13 <= 8.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, at t=14 is the earliest possible.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the actions, at t=14, we set S, but it can be anything.\n\nIn the output, for turn 14, we can put S.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \n\\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 14: S  \n}\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 13, we do U, to go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, we do S, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can set turn 14 to U, but since y=9, it might stay or be clamped, but S is simpler.\n\nIn the format, it should be clear.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is 12. This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 3 and 4 to avoid early collisions on \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\), then moving up consistently from turn 5 onwards, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 3, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 4, avoiding collision on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 5, avoiding collision on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6, which is safe since \\(y = 1\\) has no collision at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 7, safe as \\(y = 2\\) has no collision at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 8, safe as \\(y = 3\\) has no collision at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 9, safe as \\(y = 4\\) has no collision at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 10, safe as \\(y = 5\\) has no collision at turn 10 (collision only at turn 6).\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11, safe as \\(y = 6\\) has no collisions.\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12, safe as \\(y = 7\\) has no collisions.\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13, safe as \\(y = 8\\) has no collisions.\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, stay (S) is chosen arbitrarily as the position \\(y = 9\\) is already reached, and no further action is needed.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- \\(y = 1\\) is occupied at turn 6, avoiding collisions at turns 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14.\n- \\(y = 2\\) is occupied at turn 7, avoiding collisions at turns 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14.\n- \\(y = 3\\) is occupied at turn 8, avoiding collisions at turns 4, 5, 11, 12.\n- \\(y = 4\\) is occupied at turn 9, avoiding collisions at turns 4, 5, 11, 12.\n- \\(y = 5\\) is occupied at turn 10, avoiding collision at turn 6.\n- \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) have no collisions at any turn.\n\nReaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14 is the earliest possible due to the constraints:\n- \\(y = 1\\) cannot be safely occupied before turn 6.\n- From \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6, at least 8 more turns are needed to reach \\(y = 9\\) (since only one unit move per turn), leading to turn 14.\n\nThus, \\(H = 12\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{  \n\\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\  \n\\text{Turn } 14: S  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of the turn (turn T) the player is still on the original row y. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player is on row y'. Therefore, when moving, we only check the freeway of the row we are currently on (at turn T) for collision at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn T (which will be the last turn of the sequence). Note that 9 is not a freeway (since freeways are 1-8), so we don't check for collisions when we are at y=0 or y=9.\n\nWe start at y=0 (turn 4) and we want to end at y=9.\n\nWe can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). But note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (turn 4) until the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8 at every turn when we are on one of those freeways.\n\nHow the cars move:\n\nEach car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update is linear with time.\n\nFor a car on a freeway at turn t1 (current turn), we know its span at turn t1. Then at a future turn T (>= t1), the span is:\n\nIf left-moving (d='left'? but note: in the data we have 'right' for all cars in this state) -> actually, the problem states:\n\n  - Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   -> note: but the initial span for left-moving would be [h, tau] and then it moves left (decreasing x).\n\n  - Right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   -> wait, the initial span is given as (head, tail) and for right-moving the head is the front? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h]? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\nFor a car on freeway i at turn t1:\n  - Left-moving: initial span [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: initial span [tau, h] -> then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given state, all cars are right-moving and the data is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the initial span is [tau, head]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the given (head, tail) must be interpreted as: for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? \n\nBut looking at the data: \n  For freeway 1: (-32, -43, right, 4) -> if we interpret as (h, tau) and for right-moving the span is [tau, h] = [-43, -32]? Then at T, it becomes [-43 + 4*(T-4), -32 + 4*(T-4)].\n\nSimilarly, (4, -7, right, 4): span at t1=4 is [-7,4]. Then at T: [-7+4*(T-4), 4+4*(T-4)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is at (0, y) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's movement turn by turn. At each turn T (starting at T=4), we are at position y_T. Then we choose an action a_T (U, D, S) that leads to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, constrained to [0,9].\n\nAt the moment of turn T, we are on row y_T. We must check: if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we must check all cars on freeway y_T at turn T to see if any car's span contains 0.\n\nIf it does, then we have a collision and that action sequence is invalid.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states defined by (turn, y) and record the path. However, note that the turn number can be large? But the cars move linearly and the grid is fixed (y in 0..9), so we can consider the state as (y, t) where t is the absolute turn number. But the turn number can go high? However, note that we are moving from y=0 to y=9, so the minimal steps without obstacles is 9 steps (if we go up every time). But with obstacles, we might have to wait or detour.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? However, we start at 0 and want to go to 9, so moving down from 0 is not allowed (y cannot go below 0). So from 0 we can only go to 0 (stay) or to 1 (up). Similarly, at 9 we can only stay or go down? But once we reach 9 we stop.\n\nSo the minimal H is at least 9. But because of cars, we might have to wait sometimes (by staying at a freeway when it is safe, or by going down? but going down might lead to more steps). Actually, we can also use down to avoid a collision and then come back? but that would increase H.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the number of turns. So we want the shortest path in terms of turns.\n\nWe can do a BFS in the state space (y, t) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=4). But note that the state space in time might be large? However, we can bound the time? The cars are periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed and the road is infinite? But the collision only happens at x=0. So the pattern of when a car covers x=0 is periodic? \n\nFor a car with speed s, the time between consecutive times when the car covers x=0? Actually, the car is a segment. For a right-moving car with span [A, B] at time T (with A<=B), then it covers 0 if A <= 0 <= B. The car moves at speed s to the right. So the time interval during which it covers 0 is from T0 to T0 + (B-A)/s? Actually, the car is a rigid segment. The time when 0 is covered is when the entire segment [A + s*(T-t1), B + s*(T-t1)] covers 0? Actually, the condition is:\n\nFor a right-moving car at turn T (with initial at t1: [tau, head] -> so at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo we require: tau + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving? But in this problem all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for a given car, the condition for collision at turn T is:\n\ntau + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-4)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\nT >= ( -tau ) / s + 4   and T <= ( -head ) / s + 4? Actually:\n\ntau + s*(T-4) <= 0  => T <= ( -tau ) / s + 4   [if we rearrange: s*(T-4) <= -tau -> T-4 <= -tau/s -> T <= 4 - tau/s]\n\nand 0 <= head + s*(T-4) => s*(T-4) >= -head => T-4 >= -head/s => T >= 4 - head/s\n\nBut note: the head and tail can be negative or positive.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each car on each freeway the time intervals (in integer turns) when it occupies x=0.\n\nBut note: the car is present at x=0 for a continuous interval of time? But we are at discrete turns. So the condition is:\n\nLet L = tau + s*(T-4)\nLet R = head + s*(T-4)\n\nThen we need L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSince the car moves at integer speeds and we are at integer turns, we can compute the exact turns when this car is at x=0.\n\nBut note: the car might be long and cover x=0 for several consecutive turns? \n\nThe duration for which the car covers x=0: the car has length = |head - tau|? Actually, for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, head] and head >= tau? So the length is head - tau.\n\nThe time it takes for the car to pass x=0 is (length)/s? But note: the car moves s units per turn. So the number of consecutive turns that x=0 is covered is: ceil((head - tau) / s) ? Actually, no: because the movement is discrete? Actually, the movement is continuous? The problem states the update as linear in time. But the turns are discrete, so we are evaluating at integer T.\n\nBut the condition is: at integer T, we check if the segment [L, R] contains 0. The segment moves continuously? But we only check at integer T. So we can compute for each car the set of T (integer) for which L <= 0 <= R.\n\nWe can compute:\n\nT_min = ceil( ( -head ) / s + 4 )   ? Actually, from the inequality:\n\nT >= 4 - head/s   and T <= 4 - tau/s\n\nBut because head and tau are integers and s is integer, we can compute:\n\nLet T_low = ceil(4 - head/s)   -> but note: if head is negative then -head is positive.\n\nActually, rearrange:\n\nFrom head + s*(T-4) >= 0  => T >= 4 - head/s\n\nFrom tau + s*(T-4) <= 0  => T <= 4 - tau/s\n\nSo the car blocks at turn T if T is an integer in [ceil(4 - head/s), floor(4 - tau/s)]? \n\nBut note: because head and tau are integers and s is integer, the expressions 4 - head/s and 4 - tau/s might be fractional.\n\nExample: car (head, tau, right, s) = (4, -7, right, 4) at t1=4.\n\nThen at T, the span is: [ -7 + 4*(T-4), 4 + 4*(T-4) ]\n\nCondition: -7+4*(T-4) <= 0 <= 4+4*(T-4)\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: -7 + 4T - 16 <= 0 -> 4T <= 23 -> T <= 23/4 = 5.75 -> so T <= 5 (since T integer)\n\nRight: 0 <= 4 + 4T - 16 -> 0 <= 4T -12 -> 4T >= 12 -> T>=3.\n\nBut we are at T>=4 (current turn is 4). So T in [4,5].\n\nSo at T=4 and T=5, the car (4,-7,right,4) blocks freeway? which freeway? This car is on freeway 1 and 2? Actually, in the state, freeway 1 has this car, and freeway 2 also has the same set of cars? \n\nWait, the state:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (4,-7,right,4), (40,29,right,4)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same.\n\nSo for freeway 1 at T=4: we must check all three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4): \n  Span at T: [ -43 + 4*(T-4), -32 + 4*(T-4) ]\n  Condition: -43+4*(T-4) <= 0 <= -32+4*(T-4)\n  Left: -43 +4T-16 <=0 -> 4T <=59 -> T<=14.75 -> T<=14\n  Right: 0<= -32+4T-16 -> 0<=4T-48 -> T>=12.\n  So T in [12,14] -> at T=12,13,14.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4): as above, T in [4,5] (for T>=4).\n\nThird car: (40,29,right,4): \n  [29+4*(T-4), 40+4*(T-4)]\n  Condition: 29+4T-16 <=0 and 0<=40+4T-16? \n  Actually: the condition is: left <=0<=right.\n  left = 29+4T-16 = 4T+13, which is always >0 for T>=4 -> so 0 is never in [4T+13, 4T+24] because 4T+13>=13>0. So this car never blocks.\n\nTherefore, on freeway 1, the car (4,-7,right,4) blocks at T=4 and T=5, and the car (-32,-43,right,4) blocks at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is identical.\n\nNow freeway 3 and 4: same car set? \n  Freeway 3: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (-42,-53,right,6): \n  [ -53+6*(T-4), -42+6*(T-4) ]\n  Condition: -53+6T-24 <=0 and 0<=-42+6T-24\n  => 6T<=77 -> T<=77/6≈12.83 -> T<=12\n      and 0<=6T-66 -> 6T>=66 -> T>=11\n  So T in [11,12]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6): \n  [25+6*(T-4), 36+6*(T-4)] -> left=6T+1 (>=1 for T>=4) -> never blocks.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,6):\n  [-11+6*(T-4), 0+6*(T-4)] = [-11+6T-24, 6T-24] = [6T-35, 6T-24]\n  Condition: 6T-35<=0<=6T-24\n  => 6T<=35 -> T<=5.83 -> T<=5\n      and 0<=6T-24 -> 6T>=24 -> T>=4\n  So T in [4,5]\n\nSo freeway 3: blocked at T=4,5 (by car (0,-11,right,6)) and T=11,12 (by car (-42,-53,right,6))\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12): \n  [ -35+12*(T-4), -24+12*(T-4) ]\n  Condition: -35+12T-48<=0 -> 12T<=83 -> T<=6.91 -> T<=6\n            and 0<=-24+12T-48 -> 0<=12T-72 -> T>=6\n  So T=6.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12): [49+12T-48, 60+12T-48] = [12T+1,12T+12] -> always positive -> no block.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12): [13+12T-48,24+12T-48] = [12T-35,12T-24] -> at T>=4: 12T-35>=13>0 -> no block.\n\nSo freeway 5: only blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (60,49,right,3)\n  [49+3*(T-4), 60+3*(T-4)] = [3T+37, 3T+48] -> always positive -> never blocks? \n  Condition: 3T+37<=0<=3T+48 -> but 3T+37>=37>0 -> never true. So freeway 6 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: both have (48,25,right,24)\n  [25+24*(T-4), 48+24*(T-4)] = [24T-71, 24T-48] \n  Condition: 24T-71<=0<=24T-48\n  => 24T<=71 -> T<=71/24≈2.95 -> T<=2? but we are at T>=4 -> no solution? \n      and 0<=24T-48 -> T>=2 -> so for T>=4, the condition fails because 24T-71>0? \n  Let's check: at T=4: [24*4-71, 24*4-48] = [96-71,96-48]=[25,48] -> positive -> 0 not in [25,48]. So never blocks.\n\nTherefore, the blocking schedule per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T in {4,5,12,13,14}\nFreeway 2: same as 1: {4,5,12,13,14}\nFreeway 3: {4,5,11,12}\nFreeway 4: same as 3: {4,5,11,12}\nFreeway 5: {6}\nFreeway 6: never blocked\nFreeway 7: never blocked\nFreeway 8: never blocked\n\nNow, we start at turn 4, at y=0. We must avoid being on freeway 1 to 8 when the turn is in the blocking set for that freeway.\n\nWe want to go from y=0 (at turn 4) to y=9 (as soon as possible).\n\nWe can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe need to plan the moves.\n\nNote: at turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action that leads to y_{T+1} = y_T + {-1,0,1} (clamped to [0,9]).\n\nWe are only vulnerable on freeways 1 to 8 at a turn T if T is in the blocking set for that freeway.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe are at turn 4, y=0.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves if no obstacles is 9 moves (each move up: 9 steps). But we have obstacles.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the last turn. We don't require to be at 9 at the exact turn? Actually, we require the last state to be at (0,9). So the last action leads to y=9.\n\nWe do BFS by state (y, t) where t is the current turn (starting at 4). We start at (0,4). We want to reach (9, t) for some t.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But D from 0 is not allowed (y cannot go below 0) and U from 9 is not allowed? But we stop at 9.\n\nWe consider the next state: when we take an action at turn t, we move to y' = y + delta, and the next turn is t+1.\n\nBut note: at turn t, we are at y (the current row) and we check for collision only if y is between 1 and 8 and if the turn t is in the blocking set for that freeway.\n\nSo the state: (y, t) and we record the path.\n\nWe want to minimize t - 4 (the number of turns) and then we stop at the first time we hit y=9.\n\nWe can do a BFS:\n\nLet's set up a queue: each state is (y, t, path) where path is the sequence of actions from turn 4 to the current turn (exclusive of the current turn? or inclusive?) \n\nActually, at the start (turn 4) we are at y=0 and we haven't taken any action at turn 4 yet. We are going to take an action at turn 4, then at turn 5, etc.\n\nWe start at (0,4) and then we consider the actions we take at turn 4, leading to state at turn 5.\n\nSo in the state, we store the current y and the current turn t (which is the turn we have just arrived at? Actually, no: we start at turn 4 at y=0. Then we are going to take an action at turn 4 that will update the y for turn 5? \n\nBut note: the problem says: at turn t1 (4) we are at (0,0). Then we choose a_{t1} (action at turn 4) which will update y for turn 5: y_5 = y_4 + delta.\n\nBut at the moment of turn 4, we are at y=0 (safe, because 0 is not a freeway). Then we take an action. Then at turn 5, we are at y_5. Now at turn 5, we are at y_5 and we must check if y_5 is between 1 and 8 and if turn 5 is blocked for that freeway.\n\nSo the collision check happens at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of a car on freeway y_T at turn T\". And note: when we are at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action and then move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T and we check for collision at that turn T (if y_T is in [1,8]). Then we take an action and then we are at turn T+1 at y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state at the start of turn T is (y, T). Then we choose an action, and if that action leads to y' (which will be the state at turn T+1) then we must check at turn T: the current row y (which we are on during turn T) for collision? But note: we are at row y during turn T, so we check row y at turn T.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nWe start at (y=0, t=4). We are at turn 4, row 0: no collision (safe).\n\nThen we choose an action for turn 4: U, D, or S? But D from 0: y' = 0-1 = -1 -> invalid. So we can only choose U or S.\n\nIf we choose U: then at turn 5 we are at y=1.\nIf we choose S: then at turn 5 we are at y=0.\n\nBut at turn 4, we are safe (on row 0). Then we take the action.\n\nNow, at turn 5, we are at a new row. Then we check for collision at turn 5: if we are on row 1, then we check freeway 1 at turn 5: which is blocked (because freeway 1 is blocked at turn 5). So if we go to row 1 at turn 5, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn 4? Then we must do S at turn 4? Then at turn 5, we are still at y=0 (safe). Then at turn 5, we can choose U or S.\n\nBut if we choose U at turn 5: then at turn 6 we are at y=1. Now at turn 5 we are safe (on row 0) and then we take U. Then at turn 6 we are at row 1. Now check at turn 6: freeway 1 at turn 6: is 6 blocked? From above, freeway 1 is blocked at 4,5,12,13,14 -> 6 is not blocked. So safe.\n\nSo we can do: \n  Turn 4: S -> then turn 5: at y=0\n  Turn 5: U -> then turn 6: at y=1 (safe, because freeway1 at turn6 is not blocked)\n\nThen from y=1 at turn6, we can go to y=2 at turn7? But we need to check freeway2 at turn7: freeway2 blocked at 4,5,12,13,14 -> 7 is safe.\n\nBut we must consider the entire path.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go up as fast as possible avoiding the blocked turns.\n\nLet's try to simulate:\n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible. The minimal steps is 9 moves (all up). But at turn 4, we cannot go up immediately because at turn5 we would be at y=1 and turn5 is blocked for freeway1.\n\nSo we must wait at least one turn? Then:\n\nOption 1: \n  T4: S -> then T5: at y=0 (safe)\n  T5: U -> T6: at y=1 (safe, because freeway1 at T6: not blocked) \n  T6: U -> T7: at y=2 (freeway2 at T7: not blocked? freeway2 blocked at 4,5,12,13,14 -> T7 safe)\n  T7: U -> T8: y=3 (freeway3 at T8: blocked? freeway3 blocked at 4,5,11,12 -> T8 safe)\n  T8: U -> T9: y=4 (freeway4 at T9: not blocked (blocked at 4,5,11,12) -> safe)\n  T9: U -> T10: y=5 (freeway5: blocked at T6? T10 is safe? freeway5 only blocked at T6 -> safe)\n  T10: U -> T11: y=6 (freeway6: never blocked -> safe)\n  T11: U -> T12: y=7 (freeway7: never blocked -> safe)\n  T12: U -> T13: y=8 (freeway8: never blocked -> safe)\n  T13: U -> T14: y=9 -> done.\n\nTotal turns: from T4 to T14: that's 10 actions? Actually, we take 10 actions: T4 to T13.\n\nBut we can count: \n  T4: S (stay at 0)\n  T5: U (to 1)\n  T6: U (to 2)\n  T7: U (to 3)\n  T8: U (to 4)\n  T9: U (to 5)\n  T10: U (to 6)\n  T11: U (to 7)\n  T12: U (to 8)\n  T13: U (to 9)\n\nSo 10 actions? Then H=10? But we start at T4 and we take actions at T4, T5,...,T13 (10 actions) and then at T14 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: after the last action (at T13) we are at y=9 at T14? Actually, the state after an action at turn T is at turn T+1.\n\nWe define:\n  At turn T, we take an action a_T, and then at turn T+1 we are at the new y.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns: T4, T5, ..., T13 (10 actions) and then at turn T14 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions until we reach (0,9). The last action leads to y=9. So the last action is at turn T13 (which is t1+9) and then at turn T14 we are at y=9.\n\nThe problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that leads to y=9.\n\nSo the number of actions H is 10.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWe started by waiting one turn. But what if we wait more? We might not need to wait? Actually, we had to wait at the first step because going up at T4 would lead to y=1 at T5 which is blocked.\n\nBut what if we go up at T4 to y=1 at T5: that is blocked. So we must avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to go faster? For example, by going up two rows at a time? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr by skipping some rows? We have to go through each row.\n\nBut note: we can also go down to avoid? But from 0 we cannot go down. And from 1 we could go down to 0? But that would increase the steps.\n\nSo the above sequence is 10 steps.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid waiting at the beginning? \n\nSuppose at T4 we do S -> T5:0 (safe) then T5:U->T6:1 (safe) as above.\n\nBut what if we do at T4: U -> T5:1 -> but that is blocked -> invalid.\n\nSo we must wait at least one turn.\n\nBut is there a way to get there in 9 steps? That would require starting at T4 and then at T13 we are at y=9. But we must take 9 actions: from T4 to T12 (9 actions) and then at T13 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at T4. After 9 moves we would be at y=9 at T13? \n\nBut the first move: at T4: we do U -> then at T5: y=1 -> but T5 is blocked for freeway1 -> invalid.\n\nSo we cannot start with U at T4.\n\nIf we start with S at T4: then at T5: y=0. Then we have 8 moves left? But 8 moves cannot get from 0 to 9? because 8 moves up: 8, then we need one more. So 9 moves after T4? Then at T13: y=9.\n\nBut our previous sequence used 10 moves? Actually, no: in the previous sequence we used 10 moves? \n\nWait: we did 10 moves: from T4 to T13 (inclusive) that's 10 moves. But we only need 9 moves? \n\nActually, we start at y0=0 at T4.\n\nAfter 1 move: T4: move -> T5: y=?\nAfter 9 moves: at T13 (which is T4+9) we are at y=?\n\nWe want y_{T4+9} = 9? \n\nBut we start at T4: we are at y=0. Then we take 9 moves: \n  Move1: T4 -> to y1 at T5\n  Move2: T5 -> to y2 at T6\n  ...\n  Move9: T12 -> to y9 at T13.\n\nSo we want y at T13 to be 9.\n\nBut to get from 0 to 9 in 9 moves, we must go up every move.\n\nSo the sequence: T4:U, T5:U, ..., T12:U -> then at T13: y=9.\n\nBut we must check the safety at each turn:\n\nAt T4: we are at y=0 -> safe (no freeway)\nAt T5: we are at y=1 -> check freeway1 at T5: blocked -> collision -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do it in 9 moves.\n\nSo minimal moves is 10? \n\nBut let's see if we can do it in 10 moves without the initial wait? \n\nWe have to start with S at T4? Then we are at T5: y=0. Then we need 9 moves to go up to 9? So 10 moves total.\n\nBut we can also consider moving faster in the middle? For example, by not going up every time? But that would take more moves.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid a block by waiting at a safe row. But in the above sequence we didn't have to wait again.\n\nBut let me check the sequence we have:\n\nT4: S -> T5: y=0 (safe at T5? at T5 we are at y=0 -> safe)\nT5: U -> T6: y=1 -> check at T6: freeway1? freeway1 blocked at T6? no (only 4,5,12,13,14) -> safe.\nT6: U -> T7: y=2 -> freeway2 at T7: not blocked -> safe.\nT7: U -> T8: y=3 -> freeway3 at T8: not blocked (only 4,5,11,12) -> safe.\nT8: U -> T9: y=4 -> freeway4 at T9: not blocked -> safe.\nT9: U -> T10: y=5 -> freeway5 at T10: blocked only at T6 -> safe.\nT10: U -> T11: y=6 -> freeway6: never blocked -> safe.\nT11: U -> T12: y=7 -> freeway7: never blocked -> safe.\nT12: U -> T13: y=8 -> freeway8: never blocked -> safe.\nT13: U -> T14: y=9 -> done.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nThat's 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way in 10 moves that does not require waiting at the beginning? \n\nAlternatively, we could wait at a different row? But we start at 0, and we must go up.\n\nBut note: at T5 we are at y=0 and we go to y=1 at T6. But what if we wait at T5? Then we do S at T5: then at T6: y=0. Then we start going up. Then we would be at y=1 at T7, which is safe? Then we continue: then we get to y=9 at T15? which is 11 moves? worse.\n\nSo the above 10-move sequence is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: we have freeway5 blocked at T6. In our sequence, we are at freeway5 at T10? which is safe. But if we had been at freeway5 at T6, it would be blocked. But we avoid that by starting later.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 10 moves without the initial S? \n\nWe start at T4: we cannot do U (because then T5:y=1 blocked). So we must do S at T4.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can use down? \n\nFor example, at T4: U -> T5: y=1 (blocked) -> invalid.\n\nOr at T4: S -> T5:0 -> then T5:U->T6:1 (safe) as above.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: go to row 1 at a later turn? But we have to go through row 1 at some turn. The only safe turns for row1 are turns not in {4,5,12,13,14}. So we can go at T6,7,8,9,10,11,15,... We chose T6.\n\nSimilarly, row2: safe except {4,5,12,13,14} -> we are at row2 at T7 (safe).\n\nRow3: safe except {4,5,11,12} -> we are at T8 (safe).\n\nRow4: same as row3 -> we are at T9 (safe).\n\nRow5: safe except T6 -> we are at T10 (safe).\n\nRow6: always safe -> T11.\n\nRow7: always safe -> T12.\n\nRow8: always safe -> T13.\n\nThen row9: T14.\n\nSo the sequence is fixed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut note: at the last action (Turn13:U) leads to y=9 at turn14.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns starting at t1 (4) until the last action (which is at turn13).\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut wait, we have 10 actions. And the last action is at turn13 (which is t1+9) and then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at the end. \n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at T11 and T12:\n\nAt T11: we are at y=6? Actually, at the beginning of turn T11, we are at y=6? Then we do U -> then at T12: y=7.\n\nBut we must check the row we are on at turn T11: row6. Freeway6: never blocked -> safe.\n\nAt T12: we are at row7 (freeway7) -> never blocked -> safe.\n\nAt T13: we are at row8 (freeway8) -> never blocked -> safe.\n\nAnd at T14: we are at row9 -> safe and goal.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious about the freeway5: we are at row5 at turn10: which is safe (blocked only at T6).\n\nBut what about freeway3 at turn11? We are at row3 at turn8, not turn11.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut wait, in the sequence we are at row1 at turn6: safe? freeway1 at turn6: not in {4,5,12,13,14} -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row2 at turn7: freeway2 at turn7: not blocked -> safe.\n\nRow3 at turn8: freeway3 at turn8: blocked at {4,5,11,12} -> 8 is not in there -> safe.\n\nRow4 at turn9: freeway4 at turn9: not blocked -> safe.\n\nRow5 at turn10: freeway5 at turn10: only blocked at T6 -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at row6 -> safe.\n\nBut what about turn11 for freeway3? We are not on freeway3 at turn11, we are on freeway6. So we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is valid.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1..8. And we did.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1? Actually, the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So H is the number of turns (actions). So H=10.\n\nWe write the actions for turn4 (t1) to turn13 (t1+9) because t=0 corresponds to t1, t=1 to t1+1, ... t=9 to t1+9.\n\nSo the last action is at t1+9 = 13.\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" -> H=10.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=10 that is different? We think this is the only minimal one? But we could have waited at a different row? For example, if we had waited at row0 for two turns, that would be 11 moves. Or if we had gone down? but we didn't need.\n\nSo we are confident.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 10 moves without the initial S? We saw we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, what if we go up to row1 at turn6, but then skip row2? No, we must go through each row.\n\nSo the above sequence is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn to avoid the collision on freeway 1 at turn 5, then moving up consistently.\n\nThe blocking schedule for each freeway, derived from the car states, is:\n- Freeway 1: blocked at turns 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 2: blocked at turns 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 3: blocked at turns 4, 5, 11, 12\n- Freeway 4: blocked at turns 4, 5, 11, 12\n- Freeway 5: blocked at turn 6\n- Freeway 6: never blocked\n- Freeway 7: never blocked\n- Freeway 8: never blocked\n\nThe sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway during a blocked turn:\n- At turn 4: Start at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway). Action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 5.\n- At turn 5: At \\(y = 0\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6: At \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, turn 6 not blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7: At \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, turn 7 not blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8: At \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, turn 8 not blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9: At \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, turn 9 not blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10: At \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, turn 10 not blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11: At \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, never blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12: At \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, never blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13: At \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, never blocked). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14, reaching the goal.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as moving up immediately at turn 4 would place the player at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 5, which is blocked on freeway 1.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U}\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays, and the cars move left or right at constant speeds.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn and when they might be at x=0, since that's where collisions happen. The collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car whose span includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y+1 at turn T+1, not at turn T.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1=5, which is (0,0). So y_5 = 0.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there, so once I'm at (0,9), I'm safe, and that's the goal.\n\ny=9 is the top row, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut I start at y=0, and need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H means the number of actions, so from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, I take H actions to reach y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet me denote the turn number.\n\nAt turn T, the player has position (0, y_T), and we decide action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1 + H -1 for the actions, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t1 =5, position is (0,0).\n\nWe choose action a_5, which affects y_6.\n\nThen at turn 6, we are at (0, y_6), and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe turn when we reach (0,9) is turn t1 + H.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from turn t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H, we are at (0,9).\n\nNow, since we start at y=0 at turn 5, and need to get to y=9, the minimum number of actions without any cars would be 9 actions of U, so H=9, reaching at turn 14.\n\nBut with cars, it might take longer if we have to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nEach freeway has cars with their positions at turn t1=5.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn 5.\n\nFor each car, we have head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h, tau] with h > tau, I assume, since head is front.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the description, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T, [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT] with ΔT = T - t1\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T, [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars: (-28, -39, right, 4), (8, -3, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4)\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nIn this case, all are right-moving for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, I need to find when a car on a freeway has its span include x=0 at some turn.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and turn T, if there is a car such that 0 is in [low, high] for that car at turn T.\n\nSince multiple cars, but for collision, if any car on that row has 0 in span at turn T, then if player is on that row at turn T, collision.\n\nPlayer is on row y at turn T if position at T is (0,y).\n\nNow, y from 1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for each freeway, the unsafe times are the union over its cars.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving to row k, we care about the turn when we are on row k, which is when we arrive there.\n\nLet me list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway y=1:\n\nCars: (-28, -39, right, 4), (8, -3, right, 4), (44, 33, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T is [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 5\n\ns=4 for all.\n\nFirst car: head h=-28? Head and tail: in (h, tau, d, s)\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [tau, h], so for this car, tau=-39, h=-28? But it says (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nProbably head is -28, tail is -39, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if moving right.\n\nLet's see the span: at t1, for right-moving, span is [tau, h], so if tau < h, it's [tau, h], and moving right, so at T, [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left, [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT] with h > tau.\n\nIn the notation, for first car on y=1: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nSo, head h = -28, tail tau = -39.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1, span is [tau, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -39 + 4*(T-5), -28 + 4*(T-5) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (8, -3, right, 4), so [ -3, 8 ] at t1? Head=8, tail=-3, so [ -3, 8 ] at t1.\n\nThird car: (44, 33, right,4), head=44, tail=33, so [33,44] at t1.\n\nNow, we care about when 0 is in the span for each car.\n\nFor first car: 0 in [ -39 +4ΔT, -28 +4ΔT ] where ΔT = T-5\n\nSo -39 +4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -28 +4ΔT\n\nSince -39 +4ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -28 +4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -39 +4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 39 => ΔT ≤ 39/4 = 9.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -28 +4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥ 28 => ΔT ≥ 7\n\nSo for ΔT in [7, 9.75], but since turn integer, ΔT from 7 to 9 inclusive? 9.75, so ΔT=7,8,9\n\nΔT=7: -39 +28 = -11? -39 +4*7 = -39+28= -11, -28+28=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nΔT=8: -39+32= -7, -28+32=4, [ -7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=9: -39+36= -3, -28+36=8, [ -3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=10: -39+40=1, -28+40=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=6: -39+24= -15, -28+24= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nSo for first car, unsafe at T=5+7=12, 5+8=13, 5+9=14? T=12,13,14\n\nt1=5, ΔT=0 at T=5, but let's list T.\n\nT=12: ΔT=7, span [ -39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=13: ΔT=8, [-39+32, -28+32]=[-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=14: ΔT=9, [-39+36,-28+36]=[-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=15: ΔT=10, [-39+40,-28+40]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly, second car: (8,-3,right,4), at t1 span [ -3,8 ]\n\n0 in [ -3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT ]? At T, [ tau + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [ -3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT ]\n\n-3 +4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 8 +4ΔT\n\n0 ≤ 8 +4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\n-3 +4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 3 => ΔT <= 0.75\n\nSo only for ΔT=0? T=5\n\nΔT=0: [ -3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=1: -3+4=1, 8+4=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo only at T=5, unsafe.\n\nBut T=5 is current turn, but player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no issue, but for future, not unsafe except at T=5.\n\nThird car: (44,33,right,4), span at T [33+4ΔT, 44+4ΔT], min 33, max 44 at ΔT=0, both positive, increasing, so 0 never in span since min at ΔT=0 is 33>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at T=5 (from second car), T=12,13,14 (from first car)\n\nT=5 is past, player not there.\n\nNow for freeway 2, same as freeway 1? Look: freeway 2 also has the same cars: (-28,-39,right,4), (8,-3,right,4), (44,33,right,4) identical to y=1.\n\nSo unsafe at same times: T=5,12,13,14\n\nBut T=5 irrelevant.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving, s=6.\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, so at t1 span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT ]\n\n0 in if -47 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +6ΔT\n\nSo -47 +6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 47 => ΔT ≤ 47/6 ≈7.833\n\n0 ≤ -36 +6ΔT => 6ΔT ≥ 36 => ΔT ≥ 6\n\nSo ΔT from 6 to 7.833, so T=11,12?

ΔT=16: T=21, ΔT=17:22, ΔT=18:23, ΔT=19:24, ΔT=20:25, but 19.666, so up to ΔT=19.\n\nΔT=16: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=17: [-59+51, -48+51]= [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=18: [-59+54, -48+54]= [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=19: [-59+57, -48+57]= [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=20: [-59+60, -48+60]= [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe T=21,22,23,24\n\nBut T=24 is far, might not be relevant if we can reach earlier.\n\nNow freeway 7: car (72,49,right,24)\n\nRight-moving, s=24.\n\nHead=72, tail=49, span [49,72] at t1\n\nAt T: [49 +24ΔT, 72 +24ΔT], min 49>0, increasing, never 0.

H=9 is the minimum possible since we start at 0 and need to go to 9, each U increases by 1, so at least 9 U actions, no down or stay needed, so H=9 should be minimal.\n\nBut in this case, it seems to work with all U.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, y=5, T=10.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=6 and T=9.\n\nT=10 not unsafe, so safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut for y=5, at T=6, unsafe, but in this path, at T=6, we are on y=1, not y=5.\n\nIn the path above, at T=6, y=1; T=7,y=2; T=8,y=3; T=9,y=4; T=10,y=5; etc.\n\nAt T=9, y=4, which is freeway 4, and freeway 4 unsafe at T=11,12, not T=9, so safe.\n\nT=9 y=4, not on y=5.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at T=6 and T=9.\n\nAt T=6, we are on y=1; at T=9, we are on y=4, not y=5, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the car states: for freeway 5, at T=6, unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nIn this sequence, we never are on a freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nSo with H=9, actions all U from turn 5 to 13.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nTurn 5: start y=0, action a5=U, then y6=1\n\nTurn 6: position y=1, action a6=U, y7=2\n\nTurn 7: y=2, a7=U, y8=3\n\nTurn 8: y=3, a8=U, y9=4\n\nTurn 9: y=4, a9=U, y10=5\n\nTurn 10: y=5, a10=U, y11=6\n\nTurn 11: y=6, a11=U, y12=7\n\nTurn 12: y=7, a12=U, y13=8\n\nTurn 13: y=8, a13=U, y14=9\n\nAt turn 14, y=9, done.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, from t=5 to t=13, all U.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t1=5.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there a problem with any row?\n\nFor example, at turn 11, we are on y=6, T=11.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=21,22,23,24, so T=11 safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut freeway 6 has a car, but at T=11, not unsafe.\n\nEarlier I thought y=6 unsafe late, but in this path we are at y=6 at T=11, early, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=10, safe.\n\nBut what about the initial position? Turn 5, y=0, not on freeway.\n\nIn the sequence, we start moving up immediately.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 5, if we go to y=1 immediately, but at turn 5, position is (0,0), we take action a5, which sets y6.\n\nAt turn 5, we are not on any freeway.\n\nThen at turn 6, we are on y=1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 14.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier? No, because from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 steps up.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from 0.\n\ny=0 to y=9, delta y=9, each U increases by 1, so minimum 9 U actions, so H at least 9.\n\nAnd here we achieve in 9 with no issue.\n\nBut why do I feel like there might be a problem? Oh, for freeway 5 at T=9 unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=9, we are on y=4, not y=5.\n\ny=4 at T=9: freeway 4, which is unsafe at T=11,12, not T=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nPerhaps for y=1 at T=12,13,14 unsafe, but in our path, at T=12, we are on y=7, not y=1.\n\nSimilarly, far away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the car for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: only one car (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nUnsafe at T=21,22,23,24 as above.\n\nAt T=11, when we are there, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer format.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=5 to t=13, 9 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9? We have it.\n\nPerhaps with stay or down, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nBut let me see if at some point we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, y=5 was unsafe, but it is not.\n\nIn this case, all clear.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to a row, we are on that row at the next turn.\n\nAnd collision only at the turn we are on the row.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed the unsafe times.\n\nFor freeway 5, at T=9 unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=9, we are on y=4.\n\nIf we were on y=5 at T=9, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, y=5 unsafe, but at T=6, we are on y=1.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3 at T=11 unsafe, but at T=11, we are on y=6, not y=3.\n\nIn our path, we pass y=3 at T=8, which is safe.\n\nT=8 for y=3: unsafe at 11,12, not 8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 5 to turn 13.\n\nNow in the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut the box should contain the actions.\n\nPerhaps write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in text, I think it's fine.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFor freeway 5, cars: (-12,-23,right,12), unsafe at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, span for first car: ΔT=1, [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], yes 0 included.\n\nBut at T=6, we are not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, second car at T=9: ΔT=4, [-59+48, -48+48] for the second car? Freeway 5 second car (-48,-59,right,12), at T=9, ΔT=4, [-59 +12*4, -48 +12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], yes.\n\nBut at T=9, we are on y=4.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can go faster, but we can't, since each step only one up.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from 0.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 6, it has only one car, but in the state, it says \"(-48, -59, right, 3)\" for y=6.\n\nAnd we are there at T=11, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 5 to turn 13, reaching position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because:\n- At turn 6, position is \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1), which is safe as freeway 1 is unsafe only at turns 12, 13, and 14.\n- At turn 7, position is \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2), which is safe as freeway 2 is unsafe only at turns 12, 13, and 14.\n- At turn 8, position is \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3), which is safe as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turns 11 and 12.\n- At turn 9, position is \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4), which is safe as freeway 4 is unsafe only at turns 11 and 12.\n- At turn 10, position is \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5), which is safe as freeway 5 is unsafe only at turns 6 and 9.\n- At turn 11, position is \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6), which is safe as freeway 6 is unsafe only at turns 21, 22, 23, and 24.\n- At turn 12, position is \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7), which is always safe.\n- At turn 13, position is \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8), which is always safe.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 have no unsafe times, and the early passage through other freeways avoids their unsafe periods.\n\nSince moving from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 up moves, and this sequence achieves it in 9 actions without collisions, \\(H = 9\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the player's x=0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: when moving from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n- At turn T, the player is on freeway y (the starting freeway of the turn) and then moves to freeway y' at the next turn (so at turn T+1, the player will be on freeway y').\n\nThus, during the move at turn T, the player is only exposed to the cars on the freeway y (current freeway) at turn T. The next freeway (y') is not checked until the next turn (T+1).\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (turn 6). For future turns, the cars move according to their speed and direction.\n\nThe car update:\n- Left-moving: span [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n- Right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\nBut note: in the given data, the cars are described with (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the representation for left and right is different:\n\nFor right-moving cars, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] and moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the head is the front (which would be the larger x at the start?) but then moving left, so the head is the one that is leading in the direction of movement? Actually, the problem states:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note that in the given data, all cars in this problem are right-moving (since the direction is \"right\"). So we don't have any left-moving cars.\n\nTherefore, for every car, the span at turn T (>= t1) is:\n   [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given representation for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed). Since they are right-moving, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the initial span at t1 is [tail, head]. Then at turn T, it becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at (0,1) at turn 6. We must end at (0,9) at some turn (turn 6+H-1, because we start at t=0 for the sequence at turn 6: t from 0 to H-1, so the last action is at turn 6+H-1, and then the position update for that action leads to turn 6+H).\n\nBut note: the player position at the beginning of turn 6 is (0,1). Then we choose an action a6, which moves to y2 = y1 + Δy at the beginning of turn 7? Actually, the update is:\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose a_t, and then at the next turn (t+1) we are at (0, y_{t+1}) = (0, y_t + Δy_t).\n\nSo the turn index increases after the action. Therefore, the state at turn 6 is (0,1). Then we do actions at turn 6, 7, ... until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning the position at the turn when we finish. Since we are at (0, y) at the beginning of a turn, and then we do an action that might change it. We want to have at the beginning of turn (6+H) the position to be (0,9)? But note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 (meaning from turn t1 to t1+H-1). Then after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and the position at turn t1+H is (0,9).\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n- At turn t1 (6): we start at (0,1).\n- We take action a_{t1} (a6) -> then at turn t1+1 (7): we are at y_{7} = y6 + Δy6.\n\nSo after H actions (taken at turns 6, 7, ..., 6+H-1), the position at turn 6+H is y_{6+H} = 9.\n\nTherefore, we are to have the position at turn (6+H) to be 9.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with collisions during the moves? The problem states: collision occurs at turn T only if at turn T the player is on a freeway y_T (so at the beginning of the turn, the player is at (0, y_T)) and then 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nHowever, note that the action taken at turn T will change the freeway for the next turn. But at the beginning of turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we take an action that moves to y_{T+1}. During the entire turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T. Therefore, we check at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we must avoid having 0 in any car span on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nImportant: at the beginning of turn T, we are at (0, y_T). Then we take an action that moves to y_{T+1}. The collision condition is checked for the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nTherefore, we must ensure that for every turn T from 6 to 6+H-1 (because at turn 6+H, we are at 9 and we don't need to take an action? Actually, we are at turn 6+H and we are at 9, so we don't take an action at turn 6+H. We only take actions at turns 6 to 6+H-1. And during each of these turns T (6<=T<=6+H-1), we are at freeway y_T at the beginning of the turn, and we must not collide with cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAdditionally, note that when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). So if at turn T, y_T=0 or 9, then no collision check is needed.\n\nOur goal: we start at y6=1 (which is freeway 1). We end when we are at y_{6+H}=9.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 6,7,...,6+H-1 that minimizes H and avoids collisions.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, position) but note that the turn can be large? However, the minimal H is likely not too big (since we are going from 1 to 9, at least 8 moves if we only go up, but we might have to wait sometimes). Also, the car positions are periodic? Actually, the cars move continuously to the right. But note that the road is infinite? Actually, the collision only matters when 0 is in the span. So we can compute for each freeway and each car, the times (turns) at which 0 is inside the car's span.\n\nSince the cars are moving at constant speed, the condition for a car (on freeway i) to have 0 in its span at turn T is:\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial (at turn 6) tail = τ, head = h, speed = s:\n\nAt turn T, the span is [τ + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)].\n\nWe require: τ + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n  τ + s*(T-6) <= 0  and 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\n=>\n  T-6 >= ceil(-τ / s)   [if s>0, then we divide by positive, inequality direction remains] and T-6 <= floor(-h / s) ??? Actually, we have:\n\n  τ + s*(T-6) <= 0  => T-6 <= -τ/s   [if s>0, then we can rearrange: T-6 <= -τ/s? But note: if τ is negative, then -τ is positive. Actually, let me solve:\n\n  T-6 <= (-τ) / s   [since s>0, we can divide without flipping inequality]\n\nand \n  0 <= h + s*(T-6)  =>  s*(T-6) >= -h  => T-6 >= -h/s.\n\nSo: \n  T-6 in [ceil(-h/s), floor(-τ/s)]? \n\nBut note: because the car is moving to the right, the entire car is moving to the right. The condition is that 0 must lie between the tail and the head (which are increasing). Actually, the tail is the leftmost point and the head is the rightmost? For a right-moving car, the tail is the rear (which is the leftmost) and the head is the front (rightmost). So the condition is:\n\n  tail + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-6)\n\nSo we have two inequalities:\n\n1. tail + s*(T-6) <= 0   => T-6 <= -tail / s\n2. 0 <= head + s*(T-6)   => T-6 >= -head / s\n\nBut note: tail is negative? In the given data, tail is negative (for example, the first car on freeway1: (-24,-35,right,4) -> tail=-35, head=-24? Actually, wait: the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So for the first car on freeway1: head=-24, tail=-35? That would mean the car spans from x=-35 to x=-24? Then it is moving right. Then at time T-6, the car is at [ -35 + 4*(T-6), -24 + 4*(T-6) ].\n\nSo condition for 0 being in [A, B] (with A<=B) is: A<=0<=B.\n\nSo: \n  -35 + 4*(T-6) <= 0   => 4*(T-6) <= 35  => T-6 <= 35/4 = 8.75 -> T-6 <= 8 (if integer turns, then T-6 from 0 to 8)\n  and 0 <= -24 + 4*(T-6)  => 4*(T-6) >= 24  => T-6 >= 6.\n\nSo for this car, T-6 in [6,8] (i.e., turns 6+6=12 to 6+8=14) but wait: at turn T, the car is at [ -35+4*(T-6), -24+4*(T-6) ].\n\nAt T=12: [ -35+4*6 = -35+24 = -11, -24+24=0 ] -> then 0 is at the head? The problem says: the span is [tail, head] for right-moving? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at T=12: τ=-35+24=-11, h=-24+24=0. Then the span is [-11,0]. So 0 is included? Yes.\n\nBut note: the condition is that 0 must be in the closed interval? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\". So at T=12, the car spans from -11 to 0, so 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=13: [-35+4*7=-35+28=-7, -24+28=4] -> [ -7,4] which includes 0 -> collision.\nAt T=14: [-35+32=-3, -24+32=8] -> includes 0 -> collision.\n\nBut wait, T-6=6 -> T=12; T-6=7->T=13; T-6=8->T=14. Then at T=15: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo this car is dangerous on freeway1 at turns 12,13,14.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 6. So we are only concerned with turns starting at 6.\n\nWe must compute for every freeway (1 to 8) and every car, the set of turns T (>=6) for which 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThen, for a given turn T and freeway y, we have a collision if any car on freeway y at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and each turn T (starting from 6 up to a certain limit) whether there is a car that causes a collision.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is at least 8 (if we go up without waiting). But we might have to wait because of collisions. So we can set a limit: let's say we try up to H=20? or 30? Since the cars move and the dangerous periods are finite (because the cars eventually move away), we can set a bound.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the dangerous intervals for each freeway and then avoid being on that freeway during those intervals.\n\nBut note: we are going from 1 to 9. We start at 1 (turn6) and we want to get to 9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe can do BFS in the state (turn, y) for turns from 6 onward and y from 0 to 9.\n\nThe state: (T, y) meaning at the beginning of turn T, we are at y.\n\nFrom state (T, y), we can choose an action: U, D, S -> then next state (T+1, y') where y' = min(9, max(0, y + dy)).\n\nBut we must check: at state (T,y), if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check if at turn T, freeway y has a car that covers 0? If yes, then we cannot be at (T,y) -> so we avoid that state.\n\nIf y=0 or 9, then no check (safe).\n\nWe start at (6,1). We want to reach (T,9) for some T. We want minimal T - 6? Actually, the number of turns H = T - 6? But note: we are at (6,1) and then we take actions until we are at (6+H,9). So the total number of actions is H, and the turn at which we achieve the goal is 6+H.\n\nWe can do BFS (by increasing T) and we stop when we first reach y=9.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute for each freeway (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of turns T (>=6) for which the car covers 0.\n\n   How: for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) on freeway k, and since direction is right (all cars in this problem are right), the condition is:\n\n        tail + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-6)\n\n   Solve for T:\n\n        T >= 6 + ceil( (-head) / s )   [because: head + s*(T-6) >=0  => s*(T-6) >= -head => T-6 >= ceil(-head/s) if we are using real numbers? But T is integer, so we can use inequalities with integers]\n\n        T <= 6 + floor( (-tail) / s )   [because: tail + s*(T-6) <=0 => s*(T-6) <= -tail => T-6 <= floor(-tail/s)]\n\n   However, note: because the car might be moving and the positions are integers? Actually, the head and tail are integers, and s is integer, and T is integer. So we can compute:\n\n        lower_bound = ceil( ( -head ) / s )   -> but note: we have head + s*(T-6) >=0 => s*(T-6) >= -head => T-6 >= ceil( (-head) / s )? But if (-head) is positive, then we are dividing a positive by positive.\n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n          T-6 >= ceil( ( -head ) / s )   [if s>0]\n\n          T-6 <= floor( ( -tail ) / s )   [if s>0]\n\n   However, note: if head is negative, then -head is positive. Similarly, tail is negative so -tail is positive.\n\n   Example: car (head=-24, tail=-35, s=4)\n\n        T-6 >= ceil( ( - (-24) ) / 4 ) = ceil(24/4)=ceil(6)=6\n        T-6 <= floor( ( - (-35) ) / 4 ) = floor(35/4)=8.75 -> 8\n\n        So T in [6+6, 6+8] = [12,14] as we computed.\n\n   But wait: let me check at T=12: head=-24+4*(6)=0 -> condition: 0<=0 -> true, and tail=-35+24=-11<=0 -> true. So T=12 is included.\n\n   At T=15: head=-24+4*9=12, tail=-35+36=1 -> then 0 is not in [1,12]. So the interval is [12,14] (T=12,13,14).\n\n   However, note: the condition for the tail: tail + s*(T-6) <=0 -> at T=14: tail=-35+4*8=-35+32=-3<=0 -> true. At T=15: tail=1>0 -> false.\n\n   So the interval is T from 6+ceil(-head/s) to 6+floor(-tail/s) inclusive? Actually, the condition is:\n\n        T_min = ceil( ( -head ) / s ) + 6   [but note: we have head + s*(T-6) >=0 -> T>= ( -head ) / s, so the smallest integer T is ceil( (-head)/s ) + 6?]\n\n        T_max = floor( ( -tail ) / s ) + 6   [because tail + s*(T-6) <=0 -> T <= ( -tail ) / s, so the largest integer T is floor( (-tail)/s ) + 6?]\n\n   But in our example: (-head)=24, s=4 -> 24/4=6 -> ceil(24/4)=6 -> T_min=6+6=12.\n        (-tail)=35, 35/4=8.75 -> floor(35/4)=8 -> T_max=6+8=14.\n\n   So the car is dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\n   However, note: what if the car is already covering 0 at T=6? Then we have to include that.\n\n   Now, for each freeway, we can compute the set of turns T (>=6) for which at least one car on that freeway covers 0.\n\n   We'll create a set (or a boolean array) for each freeway and for each turn (from 6 to, say, 50) whether it is dangerous.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute for each freeway the union of the dangerous intervals from all cars.\n\n2. Then we run BFS:\n\n   Let Q be a queue of (T, y) where T is the turn and y is the position.\n\n   We start at (6,1). We mark visited states? But note: we might have to wait (stay) so we can revisit the same (y) at a later turn? But if we are at the same y at a later turn, it might be safe then? So we cannot mark (y) as visited? We must allow revisiting? But we are minimizing the turn T? Actually, we are doing BFS by increasing T, so if we reach a state (T,y) and we already reached (T', y) with T'<=T, then we can skip. Because we want the minimal total turns. So we can keep a 2D array: best_time[y] = minimal turn at which we reached y. But note: we might have multiple paths to the same y at the same turn? Then we don't need to revisit.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        dist[T][y] = the minimal number of actions to reach (T,y) from (6,1)? But we are doing BFS by T, so we can do:\n\n        We want to compute the minimal T such that we can be at (T,9). \n\n        We can do:\n\n          Let visited[T][y] = boolean, but T can be large. Instead, we can use an array for each y: earliest_time[y] = the earliest turn T (>=6) at which we reached y. Then we update.\n\n        However, note: sometimes we might need to wait at a safe spot to avoid a collision later? So we might have to stay at y for several turns. But if we have already reached y at turn T, then we don't need to consider reaching y at a later turn? Not necessarily: because if we are at y at a later turn, we might avoid a collision that would have happened at an earlier turn. But we are doing BFS by increasing T, so the first time we reach a state (T,y) is the earliest T we can be at y. And if we can avoid collisions by waiting, we can do that by staying (S) at a safe freeway (or at y=0 or 9) for one or more turns.\n\n        But note: if we are at (T,y) and we stay, we get to (T+1,y). So if we are already at y at T, and we stay, we get to y at T+1. But if we are at y at T, then we can also move to y+1 or y-1 at T+1. So we don't need to consider staying for multiple turns if we are already at y? Actually, we do: because the collision condition depends on T. So if at turn T, y is safe, then we can stay. But if we are at y at T and it is safe, we can leave immediately? Why would we stay? Because the next freeway might be dangerous at T+1? \n\n        Example: suppose we are at y=5 at turn T, and we want to go to y=6. But at turn T+1, if we move to y=6, then we are at y=6 at the beginning of turn T+1, and then we must check freeway6 at turn T+1. But if freeway6 at T+1 is dangerous, then we cannot go. So we might have to wait at y=5 until the danger on freeway6 is over? But note: we can also go down? \n\n        Therefore, we must consider staying at a freeway if it is safe, to wait for a better time.\n\n        So we cannot prune by the earliest_time[y]? Because we might need to be at y at a later turn to avoid a collision when moving to the next freeway.\n\n        Therefore, we have to allow multiple visits to the same y at different turns. We can use a 2D array: visited[T][y]? But T can be large. However, we can set a bound on T. Since the minimal H is at least 8, and we might have to wait a few turns, let's set T_max = 6 + 30 (so we consider up to 30 actions).\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a dictionary: key=(T,y), and we mark if we visited (T,y). We do BFS by T: we start at T=6, then T=7, then T=8, ... until we find a state (T,9). Then H = T - 6? But note: we are at (T,9) at the beginning of turn T, which is achieved by taking actions from turn 6 to T-1? So the number of actions is T - 6.\n\n        Therefore, we want to find the smallest T such that we can be at (T,9).\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let Q be a queue (FIFO) but we can do by increasing T (so we can use BFS level by level).\n\n          We start: \n            state: (turn=6, y=1) -> if at turn6, freeway1 is dangerous? We must check.\n\n          Precomputation: for each freeway (1..8) and for each car, we have the dangerous intervals. Then for each freeway, we can have a list of dangerous turns (or a set) OR we can have a function isDangerous(freeway, turn) that returns True if at that turn the freeway is dangerous.\n\n          How to compute for a freeway k and turn T:\n\n            For each car on freeway k (from the initial state at turn6), we check:\n\n                tail_car = given tail (which is the tail at turn6)\n                head_car = given head (at turn6)\n                s = speed\n\n                tail_at_T = tail_car + s*(T-6)\n                head_at_T = head_car + s*(T-6)\n\n                if tail_at_T <= 0 <= head_at_T, then dangerous.\n\n            If any car satisfies, then the freeway is dangerous at T.\n\n          But note: if there are multiple cars, we can break early.\n\n          We'll precompute for each freeway k, for turns T from 6 to T_max (say 50) whether it is dangerous.\n\n          Then, for a state (T,y):\n\n            if y is between 1 and 8, then check freeway y at turn T: if dangerous, then skip (this state is invalid).\n            if y=0 or 9, then safe.\n\n          Then, from state (T,y), we can go to (T+1, y') for y' in { y-1, y, y+1 } (if within [0,9]).\n\n          But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\n          We want to find the minimal T such that we have (T,9) and the state (T,9) is safe? Actually, when we are at (T,9), we don't need to take an action? So we only require that for all turns from 6 to T-1, we were safe? And at turn T, we are at 9 -> safe (because freeway9 doesn't exist, cars only on 1..8). So we don't check turn T for y=9? Correct.\n\n          Therefore, we stop when we first get to (T,9) for any T.\n\n          But note: we must avoid states that are dangerous at turn T for y in [1,8]. For y=0 and 9, we don't check.\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            Let T_max = 50 (or 100, but 50 is safe for 8 moves and up to 42 waits?).\n\n            Precompute for each freeway k in [1,8] and for T in [6, T_max]: \n                danger[k][T] = True if there exists a car on freeway k (from the initial list) such that:\n                    tail + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-6)\n\n            Then:\n\n                Let dist[T][y] = the minimal number of actions to reach (T,y) (or we don't need that, we just want the first T that reaches 9). We can use a visited array: visited[T][y] = the action that led to (T,y) and the parent state? Or we just want the sequence.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                queue = deque()\n                # We store (T, y, path) but path might be long? Instead, we can store parent pointers.\n\n                We'll create a 2D array (for T from 6 to T_max, and y from 0 to 9) to store the previous state and the action taken to get here.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    Let parent[T][y] = (T_prev, y_prev, action) meaning we came from (T_prev, y_prev) by taking the action at turn T_prev that led to y at T.\n\n                Steps:\n\n                  Initialize:\n\n                    for T in [6, T_max]:\n                      for y in [0,9]:\n                         parent[T][y] = None\n\n                    Start: T0=6, y0=1.\n\n                    Check: at (6,1): freeway1 at turn6: is it dangerous?\n                      We have to compute for freeway1 at T=6.\n\n                    Precomputation for freeway1 at T=6:\n\n                      Cars on freeway1: \n                         (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\n                      For each car:\n\n                         car1: tail=-35, head=-24 -> at T=6: \n                              tail_at_6 = -35 + 4*(0) = -35\n                              head_at_6 = -24 + 0 = -24\n                              -35<=0<=-24? -> 0 is not between -35 and -24 (because -24 is negative) -> no.\n\n                         car2: tail=1, head=12? Actually, the car is given as (head, tail) = (12,1) -> so tail=1, head=12? Then at T=6: [1,12]. 0 is not in [1,12] -> no.\n\n                         car3: (48,37) -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\n                      So freeway1 at T=6 is safe.\n\n                    Therefore, we start.\n\n                    Enqueue (6,1) and mark parent[6][1] = (None, None, None) [start]\n\n                    Then we process T=6: \n\n                      From (6,1), we can choose U, D, S.\n\n                      Actions:\n\n                         U: y' = min(9, 1+1)=2 -> state (7,2)\n                         D: y' = max(0,1-1)=0 -> state (7,0)\n                         S: y' = 1 -> state (7,1)\n\n                    Then we check each next state at T=7:\n\n                      (7,2): freeway2? y=2 -> between 1 and 8, so check freeway2 at T=7.\n\n                         Precomputation for freeway2 at T=7:\n\n                            Cars: same as freeway1? \n                                (-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4)\n\n                            car1: tail_at_7 = -35 + 4*(1) = -31, head_at_7=-24+4=-20 -> [-31,-20] -> 0 not in.\n                            car2: tail=1+4=5, head=12+4=16 -> [5,16] -> 0 not in.\n                            car3: tail=37+4=41, head=48+4=52 -> [41,52] -> no.\n\n                         So safe.\n\n                      (7,0): safe (because y=0)\n                      (7,1): freeway1 at T=7: \n                            car1: [-35+4, -24+4] = [-31,-20] -> no\n                            car2: [1+4,12+4]=[5,16] -> no\n                            car3: [37+4,48+4]=[41,52] -> no -> safe.\n\n                    Then we enqueue these.\n\n                    We continue until we hit (T,9) for some T.\n\n                    We are guaranteed to find because we can always go to 0 and 9? But we have to avoid collisions only on freeways 1..8.\n\n                    How to get to 9? We must eventually go up from 8 to 9.\n\n                    We stop when we first reach (T,9) for any T (minimal T).\n\n          Then we backtrack the actions.\n\n          But note: the action taken at turn T leads to the position at turn T+1. So at state (T, y), we are at the beginning of turn T. Then we take an action a_T, and then at the beginning of turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1}.\n\n          Therefore, to output the actions: we start at (6,1) and we take an action a6 that leads to y7. Then at turn7, we are at y7 and take a7, etc.\n\n          So the sequence of actions: for turn = 6,7,...,T-1.\n\n          The goal is reached at turn T (at the beginning of turn T, we are at 9). The last action was taken at turn T-1.\n\n          Therefore, the sequence of actions is for turns 6 to T-1.\n\n          How to backtrack:\n\n            We store for each state (T,y) the action that we took at the previous turn (turn T-1) to get to y at T.\n\n            Specifically, we store:\n\n                parent[T][y] = (T_prev, y_prev, a) \n                meaning: from state (T_prev, y_prev) we took action a to get to (T, y).\n\n            Then starting from (T,9), we backtrack until we get to (6,1).\n\n            Then we reverse the actions to get the sequence from turn6 to turn T-1.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Initialize parent[6][1] = None.\n\n            For each state (T,y) that we visit, we consider the next states (T+1, y_next) for y_next in {y-1, y, y+1} (if in bounds). Then we set:\n\n                parent[T+1][y_next] = (T, y, action) \n\n            where action is:\n                if y_next = y+1 -> U\n                if y_next = y-1 -> D\n                if y_next = y -> S\n\n            Then when we reach (T,9) for some T, we backtrack:\n\n                current = (T,9)\n                actions = []\n                while current != (6,1):\n                    (T, y) = current\n                    (T_prev, y_prev, a) = parent[T][y]\n                    actions.append(a)\n                    current = (T_prev, y_prev)\n\n                Then reverse actions: the first action is for turn6, then turn7, etc.\n\n          But note: the state (6,1) has parent=None, so we stop.\n\n          However, the action that led to (7,2) from (6,1) is U. Then we store for (7,2): parent = (6,1,U). Similarly, for (7,0): (6,1,D), for (7,1): (6,1,S).\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll set T_max = 50.\n\n  Precomputation for danger[k][T] for k in 1..8 and T in 6..T_max:\n\n      danger = a 2D list: danger[k][T] = False for all initially.\n\n      For each freeway k, we have a list of cars: given in the problem.\n\n      For each car in freeway k:\n\n          head, tail, d, s = car  (d is direction, but all are right)\n\n          Since d is right, the car moves to the right.\n\n          For T from 6 to T_max:\n\n              tail_T = tail + s*(T-6)\n              head_T = head + s*(T-6)\n\n              if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T:\n                  danger[k][T] = True   (and break inner loop? Actually, we can set and then continue to next car? Actually, if one car is dangerous, then the freeway is dangerous at T, so we can break the car loop for this T? But we can set and then break the car loop for this T? Actually, we can set danger[k][T]=True and then break the inner car loop? But we don't need to check other cars if one is dangerous? Yes, because one car is enough to make it dangerous.\n\n          However, we can do without break? It doesn't matter.\n\n  Then BFS:\n\n      Let's create an array parent[T][y] for T in [6, T_max] and y in [0,9]. We can use a list of dictionaries? Or a 2D array of tuples: (T_prev, y_prev, action) or None.\n\n      Initialize:\n\n          from collections import deque\n          queue = deque()\n          # We'll use a 3D list: parent[T][y] = (T_prev, y_prev, action) for T from 6 to T_max, y from 0 to 9. We can use a list of lists: \n          parent = [[None] * 10 for _ in range(T_max+1)]   # index T from 0 to T_max, but we only use 6..T_max.\n\n          visited = [[False]*10 for _ in range(T_max+1)]\n\n          Start: T=6, y=1 -> we check if safe: freeway1 at T=6: we computed danger[1][6] -> which we computed as False? So we mark:\n\n          visited[6][1] = True\n          parent[6][1] = None\n          queue.append((6,1))\n\n          While queue:\n             (T, y) = queue.popleft()\n\n             If y==9: \n                 we break and backtrack.\n\n             Otherwise, consider next actions: for a in [U, D, S] (which give dy: +1, -1, 0)\n\n                 y_next = y + dy   (but clamp to [0,9])\n\n                 T_next = T+1\n\n                 If T_next > T_max: skip\n\n                 Check: if y_next is in [1,8] -> then we must check danger[y_next] at T_next? \n                     Actually, no: because the state (T_next, y_next) is at the beginning of turn T_next. Then during turn T_next, we will be on freeway y_next? But note: the action we are about to take is at turn T? Then at turn T, we are at (T,y). We take an action that leads to y_next at the next turn (T+1). So the state (T_next, y_next) will be checked at turn T_next? \n\n                 But in our BFS, when we get to (T_next, y_next), we will check if it is safe? However, we are about to enqueue (T_next, y_next) and then when we pop it we check. But we can avoid enqueueing unsafe states.\n\n                 Actually, we can check now: \n                    if y_next is 0 or 9: safe -> then we can enqueue.\n                    else: check danger[y_next][T_next] -> if True, then skip (this state is not safe).\n\n                 Also, if we have already visited (T_next, y_next) then we skip? Actually, we can skip if we already visited (T_next, y_next) because if we have already visited, then we have a path to that state at the same turn? And we are doing BFS by T (so we first get the earliest T). But wait: we are processing by increasing T? We are doing BFS by T (since we are increasing by 1 each step). So if we visit (T_next, y_next) for the first time, then it is the earliest T. But note: we might have multiple ways to get to (T_next, y_next) at the same T? Then we only need one.\n\n                 So: if we have not visited (T_next, y_next) and the state is safe (if y_next in [1,8] then not dangerous at T_next) then we enqueue.\n\n          Steps in the loop:\n\n             for each action (dy) in [ (+1, 'U'), (-1, 'D'), (0, 'S') ]:\n\n                 y_next = y + dy, then clamp to [0,9]\n\n                 T_next = T+1\n\n                 if T_next > T_max: skip\n\n                 if y_next is 0 or 9: safe = True\n                 else: safe = not danger[y_next][T_next]   # because danger is precomputed: if danger[y_next][T_next] is True, then not safe -> skip.\n\n                 But note: the state (T_next, y_next) must be safe? Yes.\n\n                 If safe and not visited[T_next][y_next]:\n                    visited[T_next][y_next] = True\n                    parent[T_next][y_next] = (T, y, action_letter)   # action_letter is 'U','D','S'\n                    queue.append( (T_next, y_next) )\n\n                    If y_next==9: then we break out of the loop and then break out of BFS.\n\n          Then when we break (because we found y_next==9), we backtrack:\n\n             actions = []\n             current_T = T_next   # the turn when we are at 9\n             current_y = 9\n             while current_T != 6:\n                 (prev_T, prev_y, action) = parent[current_T][current_y]\n                 actions.append(action)\n                 current_T = prev_T\n                 current_y = prev_y\n\n             Then reverse actions: so the first action is for turn6, then turn7, etc.\n\n          The minimal H = current_T - 6? Actually, the number of actions = T_next - 6? Because we started at turn6 and then we took actions at turns 6,7,...,T_next-1? Then the number of actions H = T_next - 6.\n\n          Then we output:\n\n             Turn 6: action0\n             Turn 7: action1\n             ...\n             Turn 6 + H - 1: last action\n\n          Where the actions are the reversed list.\n\nLet's code the precomputation:\n\n  Freeways: 1 to 8.\n\n  Given:\n\n      k=1: [(-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4)] \n          But note: the representation is (head, tail) -> so for the first car: head=-24, tail=-35? \n          Actually, the problem says: \"Cars (head, tail, direction, speed)\"\n\n          So we'll store for each car: (head, tail, s) [since direction is always right, we ignore d?]\n\n  We'll create a list for each freeway:\n\n      cars = {\n          1: [ (-24, -35, 4), (12, 1, 4), (48, 37, 4) ],\n          2: same as 1? \n          3: [ (-30, -41, 6), (48,37,6), (12,1,6) ]   -> but note: the representation: (head, tail) so for the first car: head=-30, tail=-41? \n          4: same as 3?\n          5: [ (0,-11,12), (-36,-47,12), (48,37,12) ]   -> head=0, tail=-11? \n          6: [ (-45,-56,3) ]   -> head=-45, tail=-56\n          7: [ (-48,-71,24) ]\n          8: [ (-48,-71,24) ]\n      }\n\n  But wait: the table:\n\n      Freeway 1: (-24,-35,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4) -> so we store (head, tail, s) = (-24, -35, 4), (12,1,4), (48,37,4) for freeway1.\n\n      Freeway2: same as freeway1? So same data.\n\n      Freeway3: (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6) -> so (head, tail, s) = (-30,-41,6), (48,37,6), (12,1,6)\n\n      Freeway4: same as freeway3.\n\n      Freeway5: (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12) -> (0,-11,12), (-36,-47,12), (48,37,12)\n\n      Freeway6: (-45,-56,right,3) -> (-45,-56,3)\n\n      Freeway7: (-48,-71,right,24) -> (-48,-71,24)\n\n      Freeway8: same as freeway7.\n\n  Then for each freeway k from 1 to 8, and for each car in cars[k], and for T from 6 to T_max (50):\n\n        tail_T = tail + s*(T-6)\n        head_T = head + s*(T-6)\n\n        if tail_T <= 0 and 0 <= head_T:   # note: tail_T <= head_T? For right-moving, yes. But what if the car representation was given with head and tail swapped? The problem says: for right-moving, the car is [tail, head] at turn6? Actually, the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" -> so τ is the tail and h is the head. So we stored tail and head as given: (head, tail) -> but the given representation is (head, tail) and then the span is [tail, head]? \n\n        But wait: the problem says: \"Cars (head, tail, ...)\" and then for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" meaning that the tail is the first number? Actually, the problem does not explicitly say which is which. But in the example: \n\n            Freeway1: first car: (-24, -35) -> and then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]? \n\n        How did we get the condition? \n\n          Condition: tail + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-6)\n\n        But if the car is stored as (head, tail) and the span is [tail, head] (with tail<=head), then we use:\n\n            tail = the stored tail (second element) and head = the stored head (first element).\n\n        So for a car (h, t, s) in the list, we use:\n\n            tail = t\n            head = h\n\n        Why? Because the problem says: the car is given as (head, tail). Then the span is from tail to head? And if the car is moving right, the span at T is [tail + s*(T-6), head + s*(T-6)].\n\n        However, note: in the first car of freeway1: head=-24, tail=-35. Then the span at T=6 is [ -35, -24]. Then the condition: -35 <= 0 <= -24? -> false. Correct.\n\n        But wait: in the car (12,1,4) on freeway1: head=12, tail=1 -> span [1,12] at T=6 -> 0 not in? Correct.\n\n        But in freeway5, the first car: head=0, tail=-11 -> span at T=6: [-11,0] -> then 0 is included? So at T=6, freeway5 is dangerous? \n\n        So for freeway5 at T=6: \n            car1: tail=-11, head=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> dangerous.\n\n        Therefore, we must not be on freeway5 at T=6.\n\n        But we are not: we start at freeway1.\n\n        So we precompute:\n\n          danger[5][6] = True.\n\n  Then we run BFS.\n\n  Let's hope we find a path.\n\n  We set T_max=50.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  Note: the freeway indices: freeway k corresponds to the player being at y=k.\n\n  So when the player is at y=1, we check danger[1][T].\n\n  We'll create a 2D list: danger[k][T] for k in [1,8] and T in [6,50] (we can use 0-indexed arrays: but k from 1 to 8, T from 6 to 50).\n\n  We can create:\n\n      danger = [[False]*(T_max+1) for _ in range(9)]   # index 0 to 8: but we only use 1..8\n\n      for k in range(1,9):   # k=1 to 8\n          cars = the list for freeway k\n          for car in cars:\n              head = car[0]\n              tail = car[1]\n              s = car[2]\n              for T in range(6, T_max+1):\n                  # if already set to True, skip? Or we can OR the conditions.\n                  tail_T = tail + s*(T-6)\n                  head_T = head + s*(T-6)\n                  if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T:\n                      danger[k][T] = True\n                      # break inner for T? We can break to next car? Actually, we can break the inner loop for this car? But we don't: we want to mark all T for which any car is dangerous. But we are iterating T. We can leave: we set to True and then we don't break the T loop? Because we want to mark for this car all T that are dangerous? Actually, no: we are iterating per car and per T. We set danger[k][T] = True for any car that causes danger at T. So if we find one car that makes it dangerous at T, we don't need to check the other cars for the same T? So we can break the car loop for this T? But we are iterating T first? \n\n          Actually, we are iterating over cars and then T. We can do:\n\n              for T in range(6, T_max+1):\n                  found = False\n                  for car in cars:\n                      head, tail, s = car\n                      tail_T = tail + s*(T-6)\n                      head_T = head + s*(T-6)\n                      if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T:\n                          danger[k][T] = True\n                          found = True\n                          break   # break car loop for this T\n                  # if not found, danger[k][T] remains as False.\n\n          But we can also do without the break: we can set danger[k][T] = danger[k][T] OR (condition). But initially False.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              for T in range(6, T_max+1):\n                  for car in cars:\n                      ... if condition holds, then set danger[k][T]=True and break inner loop.\n\n          This is more efficient.\n\n  Let's code the precomputation.\n\n  Then BFS.\n\n  We hope to get a path.\n\n  Let me run a small test: at T=6, freeway5: we have a car (0,-11,12): \n        tail_T = -11 + 12*(0) = -11\n        head_T = 0 + 0 = 0\n        -11<=0<=0 -> true -> danger[5][6]=True.\n\n  freeway5 at T=7: \n        tail_T = -11+12=1, head_T=0+12=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> so not dangerous? \n        But wait: condition: tail_T=1, head_T=12 -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  freeway5 at T=6: dangerous.\n\n  freeway5 at T=5: we don't compute (T>=6).\n\n  Now, we run BFS:\n\n      Start at (6,1): safe -> enqueued.\n\n      Then from (6,1): we can go to (7,0), (7,1), (7,2)\n\n      (7,0): safe (y=0) -> enqueued.\n      (7,1): check freeway1 at T=7: \n            cars for freeway1: \n                car1: tail=-35+4*(1) = -31, head=-24+4=-20 -> not include 0 -> safe.\n                car2: tail=1+4=5, head=12+4=16 -> safe.\n                car3: tail=37+4=41, head=48+4=52 -> safe.\n            so safe -> enqueued.\n      (7,2): freeway2: same cars as freeway1? so same as above: safe.\n\n      Then from (7,0): \n          actions: \n            U: y_next=1 -> freeway1 at T=8? \n            D: cannot (0->0) -> y_next=0 -> safe? no, but y_next=0 -> safe.\n            S: y_next=0 -> safe.\n\n          But note: from (7,0): \n             U: (8,1) -> check freeway1 at T=8: \n                   car1: tail=-35+4*2=-27, head=-24+8=-16 -> no\n                   car2: tail=1+8=9, head=12+8=20 -> no\n                   car3: tail=37+8=45, head=48+8=56 -> no -> safe -> enqueue.\n             D: (8,0) -> safe -> enqueue.\n             S: (8,0) -> same as D.\n\n      From (7,1): \n          U: (8,2) -> freeway2 at T=8: same as freeway1 at T=8? safe.\n          D: (8,0) -> safe -> but we already have (8,0) from above? but we'll enqueue only once.\n          S: (8,1) -> freeway1 at T=8: safe.\n\n      From (7,2): \n          U: (8,3) -> freeway3 at T=8: \n                cars for freeway3: \n                   car1: (-30,-41,6): at T=8: tail=-41+6*2 = -41+12=-29, head=-30+12=-18 -> no\n                   car2: (48,37,6): tail=37+12=49, head=48+12=60 -> no\n                   car3: (12,1,6): tail=1+12=13, head=12+12=24 -> no\n                safe.\n          D: (8,1) -> already generated? but we'll enqueue if not visited.\n          S: (8,2) -> freeway2 at T=8: safe.\n\n      We continue until we get to 9.\n\n  How many steps?

Then we took 8 actions: \n            turn6: U -> at turn7: y=2\n            turn7: U -> turn8: y=3\n            turn8: U -> turn9: y=4\n            turn9: U -> turn10: y=5\n            turn10: U -> turn11: y=6\n            turn11: U -> turn12: y=7\n            turn12: U -> turn13: y=8\n            turn13: U -> turn14: y=9\n\n          So the last action is at turn13, and we are at y=9 at turn14.\n\n          Therefore, we have 8 actions: turns 6 to 13.\n\n          But is there a faster way? We need at least 8 moves (because we have to go from 1 to 9, 8 steps). So this is minimal.\n\n          However, we must check if we can avoid the dangerous freeways without taking extra steps? But we didn't take any extra step.\n\n          But what about the dangerous times? We avoided freeway5 at T=9? We were at freeway5 at T=10, which is safe.\n\n          And freeway7 and 8 at T=8: we were at freeway3 at T=8, then freeway4 at T=9, then freeway5 at T=10, etc. -> safe.\n\n          So the sequence:\n\n            Turn6: U\n            Turn7: U\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U\n            Turn13: U\n\n          But wait: we must check freeway8 at T=13? \n                freeway8: dangerous at T=8? and we are at freeway8 at T=13 -> safe.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n\n          But note: we are at freeway1 at T=6: safe -> then we move to freeway2 at T=7: safe, then freeway3 at T=8: safe, then freeway4 at T=9: safe, then freeway5 at T=10: safe, then freeway6 at T=11: safe, then freeway7 at T=12: safe, then freeway8 at T=13: safe, then at turn14 we are at 9.\n\n          So it works.\n\n  However, what if at freeway5 at T=10 we had a car? We computed it safe. But let me double-check freeway5 at T=10:\n\n        car1: (0,-11,12): \n            tail = -11 + 12*(10-6) = -11+48=37\n            head = 0+48=48 -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: (-36,-47,12): \n            tail = -47+12*4= -47+48=1\n            head = -36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n        car3: (48,37,12): \n            tail = 37+48=85, head=48+48=96 -> no.\n\n  Safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can output the sequence of 8 U's.\n\n  But wait: the problem says: the initial position is (0,1) and we want to reach (0,9). So we did.\n\n  However, let me check if there is a shorter path? We have to go up 8 times, so minimal actions is 8.\n\n  But what if we go faster? We cannot: each U only moves one step.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\n  But note: we must avoid collisions at every turn. We did.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n      Turn 13: U\n\n  However, we did not consider that there might be a car at freeway1 at T=6? We computed it safe. Similarly for others.\n\n  But wait: freeway1 at T=6: safe -> we start.\n\n  freeway2 at T=7: same as freeway1: safe.\n\n  freeway3 at T=8: we computed above: safe.\n\n  freeway4 at T=9: safe? \n        freeway4: same as freeway3: cars: (-30,-41,6), (48,37,6), (12,1,6)\n        T=9: \n            car1: tail=-41+6*3=-41+18=-23, head=-30+18=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> no\n            car2: tail=37+18=55, head=48+18=66 -> no\n            car3: tail=1+18=19, head=12+18=30 -> no -> safe.\n\n  freeway5 at T=10: safe.\n\n  freeway6 at T=11: safe.\n\n  freeway7 at T=12: \n        car: (-48,-71,24): \n            tail=-71+24*(12-6)= -71+24*6=-71+144=73\n            head=-48+144=96 -> no -> safe.\n\n  freeway8 at T=13: same as freeway7: safe.\n\n  So the path is safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can output the sequence.\n\n  However, note: we must check the entire path by the BFS? We did a manual path. But we can run the BFS and see if it finds a path of 8 steps.\n\n  We'll run the BFS and see.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      T=6: [1] -> enqueued.\n\n      T=7: from (6,1): \n            U: (7,2) -> safe -> enqueued.\n            D: (7,0) -> safe -> enqueued.\n            S: (7,1) -> safe -> enqueued.\n\n      T=8: \n          from (7,0): \n               U: (8,1) -> safe -> enqueued.\n               D: (8,0) -> safe -> enqueued.\n               S: (8,0) -> same as above -> skip if we mark visited?

(but we are going to get to 9 eventually, but we are going step by step. We are not at 9 yet.)\n\n          We are at (9,4): \n              U: (10,5) -> freeway5 at T=10: safe -> enqueued.\n\n          Also, we have (9,1): \n              U: (10,2) -> safe.\n\n          But we are interested in the path that goes up every time. \n\n          We started at (6,1) and then went to (7,2), then (8,3), then (9,4), then (10,5) -> then we need to go to 6,7,8,9.\n\n          At (10,5): \n              U: (11,6) -> freeway6 at T=11: safe -> enqueued.\n          At (11,6): \n              U: (12,7) -> freeway7 at T=12: safe -> enqueued.\n          At (12,7): \n              U: (13,8) -> freeway8 at T=13: safe -> enqueued.\n          At (13,8): \n              U: (14,9) -> goal.\n\n          Then backtrack:\n\n              (14,9) came from (13,8) with U.\n              (13,8) from (12,7) with U.\n              (12,7) from (11,6) with U.\n              (11,6) from (10,5) with U.\n              (10,5) from (9,4) with U.\n              (9,4) from (8,3) with U.\n              (8,3) from (7,2) with U.\n              (7,2) from (6,1) with U.\n\n          So the actions: \n              turn6: U\n              turn7: U\n              turn8: U\n              turn9: U\n              turn10: U\n              turn11: U\n              turn12: U\n              turn13: U\n\n          And we are done.\n\n  Therefore, we output the sequence.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\n  So the answer:\n\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n      Turn 13: U\n\n  However, the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1, meaning from turn t1 to t1+H-1. So we have 8 actions: from turn6 to turn13.\n\n  Format:\n\n      \\boxed{\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n      Turn 13: U\n      }\n\n  But note: the example in the problem used curly braces for the turn index: a_{t_1}, so we write:\n\n      Turn 6: a_{6} = U\n      ...\n\n  But the format says:\n\n      Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n      Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n      ...\n\n  So we write:\n\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n      Turn 11: U\n      Turn 12: U\n      Turn 13: U\n\n  Without the a_{}. The example in the problem did not include the 'a_{}' in the output, it just wrote the action.\n\n  Therefore, we output as above.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: what if there is a car that we missed? We did a manual check, but the BFS in code would have found it.\n\n  Since we are not actually coding, we rely on our reasoning.\n\n  But note: freeway3 and freeway4 have the same cars? But we checked freeway3 at T=8 and freeway4 at T=9: safe.\n\n  So we are confident.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is the sequence of 8 U's.\n\n  But wait: what if we can do it in fewer than 8 actions? We cannot, because we start at 1 and need to get to 9: 8 steps.\n\n  So it is minimal.\n\n  Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\n  However, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". We found H=8.\n\n  But the boxed part only requires the sequence.\n\n  We output the sequence.\n\n  Note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n  Here, t_1=6, H=8, so t from 0 to 7: \n        a_{6+0} = a6 = U\n        a_{6+1} = a7 = U\n        ...\n        a_{6+7} = a13 = U\n\n  So the turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\n  We output for turns 6 to 13.\n\n  Done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 8.

Collision happens if at any turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, the car on that freeway has its span including 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn, starting from t=7, since t_1=7 is the current turn.\n\nThe player update is simple: I can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left, for right-moving, it shifts right. But looking at the car states, all cars seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all. Let me confirm.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: all right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1? (-20,-31,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (52,41,right,4) — that's the same as freeway 1. Is that a mistake?\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 are identical: both have (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both have only one car each, and it's the same: (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nBut freeway 6 has one car, freeway 7 and 8 have one each but same description.\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, it lists multiple cars, but for freeway 6,7,8, it has only one car each.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, similarly 2,3,4,5 have multiple, 6,7,8 have one.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 are identical? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 1: Cars: (-20,-31,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (52,41,right,4)\n\nFreeway 2: same: (-20,-31,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (52,41,right,4)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,-47,right,24)  // same as 7\n\nNow, for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] because for right-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, so if moving right, head increases, so at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] since it shifts right.\n\nIn the car update rule, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when moving to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so collision is checked based on y_T and cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1)\"\n\nSo, collision only matters for the freeway you are currently on at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), and you are on freeway y_T, so you check if for freeway y_T, at turn T, 0 is in any car's span on that freeway. If yes, collision.\n\nThen you take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the new position, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 at t=7 to y=9, with minimal H, meaning from t=7 to t=7+H-1, so after H turns, at time t=7+H, position is (0,9)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at time t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe player position at turn T is before the action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the player is at (0, y_t).\n\nThen, the player chooses action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nIn the collision, it says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo, at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen, after choosing action, we move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), meaning that at some turn, y_T = 9.\n\nSpecifically, we want y_{t1 + H} = 9, I think, after H actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1, so after H actions, the position is at time t=7+H.\n\nAnd we want y_{7+H} = 9.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end, so from t=7 to t=7+H, position changes from y_7 to y_{7+H}.\n\nAt turn 7, position is (0,2), we apply H actions, so after H actions, at turn 7+H, position is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2, need to go to y=9, the minimum number of moves without any cars would be 7 up moves, since 9-2=7, so H=7 if we can go up every turn.\n\nBut there are cars, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to compute for each freeway, at each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nBecause for each freeway and each turn, we can compute if that freeway is occupied at position 0 at that turn.\n\nThen, when the player is on a freeway at that turn, if it is occupied, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, and we only care about x=0 for collision.\n\nSo, for each freeway k, and for each turn T, we can compute occupied(k,T) = true if there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThen, for the player, at turn T, if on freeway y_T, and occupied(y_T, T) is true, then collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions such that for all T from t1 to t1+H-1, when at position y_T, occupied(y_T, T) is false, and at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nt1=7.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1=7.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so τ=0 is turn t1=7.\n\nThen at τ=0, player at y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ = H, after H actions.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nPosition at τ=0: y=2\n\nAfter action a_0, position at τ=1: y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, position at τ=H: y_H = 9\n\nAnd for each τ from 0 to H-1, at position y_τ, we need that occupied(y_τ, τ) is false, where τ is time since t1, so absolute turn is t1 + τ.\n\nBut since the car spans depend on absolute time, we need to use absolute turn.\n\nTo make it easier, I'll use absolute time, starting from t=7.\n\nSo at t=7, y=2.\n\nWe need y_T for T from 7 to 7+H, with y_7=2, y_{7+H}=9.\n\nFor each T from 7 to 7+H-1, at turn T, position y_T, we need that freeway y_T is not occupied at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we check occupied(y_T, T).\n\nThen we take action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway k from 1 to 8, and for relevant times, whether occupied at x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: cars: (-20,-31,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (52,41,right,4)\n\nAll speed 4, right-moving.\n\nFor a car, span at time T: [τ + 4*(T-7), h + 4*(T-7)] for right-moving.\n\nFor first car: head h=-20, tail τ=-31? In the list, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -20 > -31, yes.\n\nSo at time T, span: [τ + 4*(T-7), h + 4*(T-7)] = [-31 + 4(T-7), -20 + 4(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, so for a car, if τ + 4(T-7) <= 0 <= h + 4(T-7)\n\nSince it's a closed interval.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nFor freeway 1, cars:\n\nCar A: h=-20, τ=-31, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-31 + 4(T-7), -20 + 4(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if -31 + 4(T-7) <= 0 <= -20 + 4(T-7)\n\nWhich is -31 + 4(T-7) <= 0 and 0 <= -20 + 4(T-7)\n\nFirst inequality: -31 + 4(T-7) <= 0 => 4(T-7) <= 31 => T-7 <= 31/4 = 7.75, so T-7 <= 7 since T integer? T-7 <= 7.75, since T integer, T-7 <= 7\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -20 + 4(T-7) => 20 <= 4(T-7) => 5 <= T-7\n\nSo for car A, occupied when 5 <= T-7 <= 7\n\nT-7 >=5 and T-7 <=7\n\nNow second car: (16,5,right,4) so h=16, τ=5, s=4\n\nSpan: [5 + 4(T-7), 16 + 4(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if 5 + 4(T-7) <= 0 <= 16 + 4(T-7)\n\nBut 5 + 4(T-7) <= 0? Since 5 + something, min is 5 + 4(-inf) but T-7 >=0, at T=7, 5+0=5>0, so left end >=5>0, so 0 < min, so never <=0, so 0 never in span. Similarly, right end >=16>0, so 0 not in span for any T.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (52,41,right,4) h=52, τ=41, both large positive, min span 41 +4(T-7) >=41>0, so never <=0, so not occupied.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only car A can have 0 in span, when T-7 >=5 and T-7 <=7, i.e., T=12,13,14? T-7=5,6,7 so T=12,13,14.\n\nT-7=5: T=12, T-7=6: T=13, T-7=7: T=14.\n\nAt T=7, T-7=0, not >=5.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: T-7=4 <5, not.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut at T=12,13,14 absolute time.\n\nNow freeway 2: same cars as freeway 1, so same thing, occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-35 + 6(T-7), -24 + 6(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6(T-7) <= 0 <= -24 + 6(T-7)\n\nFirst: -35 + 6(T-7) <=0 => 6(T-7) <=35 => T-7 <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so T-7 <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6(T-7) => 24 <= 6(T-7) => 4 <= T-7\n\nSo T-7 >=4 and T-7 <=5, so T=11,12\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6) h=54, τ=43, both large positive, min span 43+6(T-7) >=43>0, never occupied at 0.\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6) h=18, τ=7, span [7+6(T-7), 18+6(T-7)] min at T=7 is 7>0, so never <=0, not occupied.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied only by first car at T=11,12.\n\nT-7=4: T=11, T-7=5: T=12.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, so occupied at T=11,12.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) h=12, τ=1, s=12\n\nSpan: [1 + 12(T-7), 12 + 12(T-7)]\n\nAt T=7, [1,12], both positive, min=1>0? 1>0, so at T=7, min=1>0, not <=0.\n\nAs T increases, min increases, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12) h=-24, τ=-35, s=12\n\nSpan: [-35 +12(T-7), -24 +12(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12(T-7) <=0 <= -24 +12(T-7)\n\nFirst: -35 +12(T-7) <=0 => 12(T-7) <=35 => T-7 <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so T-7 <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12(T-7) => 24 <=12(T-7) => 2 <= T-7\n\nSo T-7 >=2 and T-7 <=2, since <=2.916 and >=2, integer, so T-7=2, T=9\n\nAt T=9, span: -35 +12(2) = -35+24= -11, -24+24=0? -24 +12*2= -24+24=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nYes.\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12) min span 49+12(T-7) >=49>0, never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied only at T=9 by second car.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nh=-42, τ=-53, s=3\n\nSpan: [-53 +3(T-7), -42 +3(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if -53 +3(T-7) <=0 <= -42 +3(T-7)\n\nFirst: -53 +3(T-7) <=0 => 3(T-7) <=53 => T-7 <=53/3≈17.666, so T-7 <=17\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +3(T-7) => 42 <=3(T-7) => 14 <= T-7\n\nSo T-7 >=14 and T-7 <=17, so T=21,22,23,24\n\nT-7=14: T=21, 15:T=22, 16:T=23, 17:T=24\n\nNow freeway 7: car (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nh=-24, τ=-47, s=24\n\nSpan: [-47 +24(T-7), -24 +24(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +24(T-7) <=0 <= -24 +24(T-7)\n\nFirst: -47 +24(T-7) <=0 => 24(T-7) <=47 => T-7 <=47/24≈1.958, so T-7 <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +24(T-7) => 24 <=24(T-7) => 1 <= T-7\n\nSo T-7 >=1 and T-7 <=1, so T-7=1, T=8\n\nAt T=8, span: -47 +24(1) = -47+24= -23, -24+24=0, so [-23,0], includes 0.\n\nFreeway 8: same car, so also occupied at T=8.\n\nNow, summarize occupied times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: occupied at T=11,12\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=11,12\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at T=9\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=21,22,23,24\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=8\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=8\n\nAnd for other times, not occupied.\n\nNow, player starts at t=7, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=2 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, but player can be at y=0 or y=9, which are not freeways, so no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so if player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn this case, start at y=2, which is a freeway, and end at y=9, not a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T =0 or y_T=9, since no freeway, no collision, always safe.\n\nFor y=1 to 8, collision possible if occupied at that time.\n\nNow, we need to find a path from t=7, y=2 to some T where y_T=9, with no collision at any step from t=7 to t=T-1? Let's see.\n\nFrom t=7 to the turn before reaching y=9.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe need for all T from 7 to T_end - 1, where at T_end, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nAt T_end, when we are at y=9, we don't care about collision since no freeway.\n\nBut for each turn before that, when we are at y_T for T < T_end, we need no collision.\n\nSpecifically, for T from 7 to T_end - 1, at position y_T, we need not occupied(y_T, T).\n\nThen at T_end, y_{T_end}=9.\n\nT_end = 7 + H, where H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStart at t=7, after H actions, at t=7+H, position y_{7+H}=9.\n\nAnd for each t from 7 to 7+H-1, at position y_t, not occupied(y_t, t).\n\nNow, y_t changes based on actions.\n\nWe need min H such that we can reach y=9 in H steps.\n\nSince we start at y=2, need to increase to y=9, so minimum moves is 7 up, but might need to wait or go down to avoid occupied times.\n\nFirst, let's list the occupied times for each y:\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied at t=12,13,14\n\ny=2: freeway 2, occupied at t=12,13,14\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at t=11,12\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at t=11,12\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied at t=9\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied at t=21,22,23,24\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied at t=8\n\ny=8: freeway 8, occupied at t=8\n\nFor other times, not occupied.\n\nWe start at t=7, y=2.\n\nAt t=7, y=2, is it occupied? Freeway 2 occupied at t=12,13,14, not at t=7, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut there are obstacles at certain times.\n\nFirst, at t=8, freeway 7 and 8 are occupied, but y=7 and y=8 are occupied only at t=8? Freeway 7 occupied at t=8, meaning if we are on y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut we might not be there at t=8.\n\nAlso, y=5 occupied at t=9.\n\nEtc.\n\nSince we start at t=7, y=2.\n\nWe can take actions: U, D, or S.\n\nTo go to y=9, we need net +7 in y.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nSo the number of U must be at least 7, and H must be at least 7.\n\nIf we can go up every turn, we can reach y=9 at t=7+7=14, since each up move increases y by one per turn.\n\nAt t=7, y=2\n\nAfter a_U at t=7, y=3 at t=8\n\nAfter a_U at t=8, y=4 at t=9\n\nAfter a_U at t=9, y=5 at t=10\n\nAfter a_U at t=10, y=6 at t=11\n\nAfter a_U at t=11, y=7 at t=12\n\nAfter a_U at t=12, y=8 at t=13\n\nAfter a_U at t=13, y=9 at t=14\n\nNow, check for collision at each step:\n\nAt t=7, y=2, freeway 2, occupied at t=12,13,14, not at t=7, safe.\n\nAt t=8, y=3, freeway 3, occupied at t=11,12, not at t=8? Freeway 3 occupied at t=11,12, not at t=8, so safe.\n\nAt t=9, y=4, freeway 4, occupied at t=11,12, not at t=9, so safe.\n\nAt t=10, y=5, freeway 5, occupied only at t=9, not at t=10, so safe.\n\nAt t=11, y=6, freeway 6, occupied at t=21-24, not at t=11, so safe.\n\nBut at t=11, y=6, freeway 6 not occupied at t=11, yes.\n\nNow at t=11, position y=6, but freeway 6 is occupied only later, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, y=7, freeway 7, occupied at t=8, not at t=12? Freeway 7 occupied only at t=8, not at t=12, so should be safe.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied at t=8, and at t=12, not occupied, since only t=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 occupied only at t=8.\n\nSo at t=12, y=7, freeway 7 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at t=13, y=8, freeway 8 not occupied (only t=8), safe.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut in this path, at t=11, we are at y=6, and freeway 3 is occupied at t=11, but we are not on y=3, we are on y=6 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, freeway 3 and 4 occupied, but we are on y=7.\n\nOnly issue might be at earlier points.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=7: y=2, safe\n\nt=8: y=3, freeway 3 not occupied at t=8? Freeway 3 occupied at t=11,12, not at t=8, so safe.\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4 occupied at t=11,12, not t=9, safe.\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5 occupied at t=9, not at t=10, safe.\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6 not occupied at t=11, safe.\n\nt=12: y=7, freeway 7 not occupied, safe.\n\nt=13: y=8, freeway 8 not occupied, safe.\n\nt=14: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=11, freeway 3 is occupied, but we are on y=6, not y=3, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, all seem safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at t=14.\n\nIs there a problem at t=9? y=4, not occupied.\n\nFreeway 5 is occupied at t=9, but at t=9 we are at y=4, not y=5.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=9, we are at y=4 after moving from y=3 at t=8.\n\nAt turn t=9, position is y=4, so we check freeway 4 at t=9.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at t=11,12, not at t=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions:\n\nStart t=7, y=2\n\nAction a_7: U, so y_{8} = 2 +1 =3\n\nAt t=8, position y=3, freeway 3 not occupied at t=8, safe.\n\nAction a_8: U, y_9 =3+1=4\n\nAt t=9, y=4, freeway 4 not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_9: U, y_10=4+1=5\n\nAt t=10, y=5, freeway 5 not occupied at t=10 (only t=9), safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, y_11=5+1=6\n\nAt t=11, y=6, freeway 6 not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_11: U, y_12=6+1=7\n\nAt t=12, y=7, freeway 7 not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_12: U, y_13=7+1=8\n\nAt t=13, y=8, freeway 8 not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_13: U, y_14=8+1=9\n\nAt t=14, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, at t=12, freeway 1 and 2 are occupied, but we are on y=7, not affected.\n\nSimilarly, all seems fine.\n\nBut is y=9 reached at t=14, with H=7 turns? From t=7 to t=13 actions, 7 actions, position at t=14.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 6 occupied at later times, but not relevant.\n\nIn this path, we are at y=5 at t=10, but freeway 5 occupied at t=9, which we avoided since at t=9 we were at y=4.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 7 turns.\n\nBut let me see if we can do faster? Minimum is 7, since 7 up moves needed, so H=7 is minimum possible.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible without any issue.\n\nBut at t=8, freeway 7 and 8 are occupied, but we are at y=3, not affected.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at any point we need to avoid.\n\nAnother thing: at t=11, freeway 3 and 4 occupied, but we are at y=6, fine.\n\nSo this path seems collision-free.\n\nBut let me confirm the occupied times again.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2 same\n\nFreeway 3 occupied t=11,12\n\nFreeway 4 same\n\nFreeway 5 occupied t=9\n\nFreeway 6 occupied t=21-24\n\nFreeway 7 occupied t=8\n\nFreeway 8 occupied t=8\n\nIn the path:\n\nt=7: y=2, freeway 2 not occ, safe\n\nt=8: y=3, freeway 3 not occ at t=8 (occ at 11,12), safe\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4 not occ at t=9 (occ at 11,12), safe\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5 not occ at t=10 (occ only t=9), safe\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6 not occ at t=11 (occ later), safe\n\nt=12: y=7, freeway 7 not occ at t=12 (only t=8), safe\n\nt=13: y=8, freeway 8 not occ at t=13, safe\n\nt=14: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSo with H=7, actions: all U from t=7 to t=13.\n\nt=7 to t=13 inclusive, that's 7 actions.\n\nActions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13, all U.\n\nThen position at t=14 is y=9.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns starting from t1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 14.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6? That would require net +7 with 6 actions, so 6 actions: if all U, but 6U would bring to y=2+6=8, not 9. Need at least 7 U, so H cannot be less than 7. So minimum is 7, and we have a path.\n\nBut in the occupied, at t=9, freeway 5 is occupied, but we are not there at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can start later, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6, occupied late, not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, at t=7, we are at y=2, safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to go faster, but we can't, since min moves.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to avoid something, but no need.\n\nFor example, if at some point we had to avoid, but here not.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut the problem might have a trap.\n\nAt t=8, freeway 7 and 8 are occupied, but y=7 and y=8 are occupied only at t=8.\n\nIn our path, we are at y=3 at t=8, not y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 7 with all up moves.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nSo actions from t=7 to t=13: all U.\n\nt=13 is the last action, at t=13 we are at y=8, then after U, to y=9 at t=14.\n\nNow, the sequence should be for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=7 to 7+6=13? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=7, t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, so turns t1+0=7, t1+1=8, ..., t1+6=13.\n\nActions at these turns.\n\nThen position at t=14= t1+7.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be on a freeway when occupied.\n\nFor example, at t=11, we are at y=6, but freeway 3 is occupied at t=11, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the player could be on y=5 at t=9, but in this path, at t=9 we are at y=4.\n\nSuppose we do something else.\n\nFor example, if we go up slower, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor instance, if we stay at some point to avoid t=9 on y=5, but since we are not there, no need.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 is occupied at t=21-24, but we are at y=6 at t=11, which is fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, we have car at t=9 occupied.\n\nBut in our path, we are at y=5 at t=10, not t=9.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 5 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position and freeway at each turn.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | freeway | occupied at T? | action\n\nT=7: y=2, freeway 2, not occ, action U\n\nT=8: y=3, freeway 3, not occ (occ at 11,12), action U\n\nT=9: y=4, freeway 4, not occ (occ at 11,12), action U\n\nT=10: y=5, freeway 5, not occ (occ only at t=9), action U\n\nT=11: y=6, freeway 6, not occ, action U\n\nT=12: y=7, freeway 7, not occ (occ at t=8), action U\n\nT=13: y=8, freeway 8, not occ, action U\n\nT=14: y=9, not freeway, done.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, with all up actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nSo the sequence is U for each turn from 7 to 13.\n\nNow, in the format.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y at turn T (i.e., y_T = y) and for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y. So we check the car on freeway y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y' and we check the car on freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway (k=1 to 8) at the initial turn t1=8.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (t=0) until we reach y=9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The y position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nPlan:\nWe'll model the state as (turn, y) and we want to get to y=9 as soon as possible. The turns are relative: we start at turn 8 (which we call t=0 in our relative time) and we are at y=3.\n\nWe need to check for each state (t, y) whether if we are at that y at that turn (relative turn t, which is absolute turn t1+t = 8+t) we are safe.\n\nBut note: the car positions at turn T (absolute) are computed by:\nFor each car, we know its state at turn 8. Then at turn T (>=8), the car has moved for (T-8) turns.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn whether the car(s) on that freeway at that turn have a span that includes 0.\n\nHow to compute the car span at turn T (absolute) for a given car:\n\nFor a car given at turn 8: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nIf direction is right:\n  head_T = head_8 + s * (T-8)\n  tail_T = tail_8 + s * (T-8)\n  The span is [tail_T, head_T] (since head>=tail in the given data for right? Actually, in the table for right, the head is greater than tail? Let's see: in the table, for freeway 1: first car: head=-16, tail=-27 -> so tail=-27, head=-16 -> then at T: tail_T = -27 + s*(T-8), head_T = -16 + s*(T-8). And the span is [tail_T, head_T] because they are increasing.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: at turn T, span = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and since originally the car is given as (h, tau) and for right-moving the head is greater? Actually, the problem states the car as (head, tail) but then in the update for right: \n  Original span at t1: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the input format is: (head, tail, direction, speed). But note the example for freeway 1: \n  (-16, -27, right, 4) -> so head = -16, tail = -27. Then the original span is [tail, head] = [-27, -16]? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> so tau is the tail and h is the head. Then at T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the example doesn't have left, but the update is: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn our case, all cars are right-moving? Yes, according to the table.\n\nSo for each car on a freeway, we can compute the span at absolute turn T as:\n  if right: [tail + s*(T-8), head + s*(T-8)]\n\nThen collision on freeway k at turn T (absolute) if the player is on that freeway (i.e., y = k) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNote: the freeways are from 1 to 8. We are at y=3 at turn 8 (absolute) and we start.\n\nWe are to move to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe are going to use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (t, y) where t is the number of steps from the start (so relative turn, starting at 0) and y is the current row.\n\nWe start at (0,3). We want to reach any state (t,9) and we want the minimal t (which is H-1? note: at turn 0 we are at step0, then after H-1 steps we have taken H actions and reached at step H-1? Actually, we take H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1, and at the end of H actions we are at step H (relative) and that is the H-th turn. But note: the problem says we take H actions and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: \n  We start at turn t1 (8) at (0,3). Then we take an action a_{t1} (which is at relative t=0) and then at turn t1+1 (9) we are at a new y. Then we take H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. Then at the end of the H-th action, we are at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n  t=0: a_{t1} -> leads to state at turn t1+1\n  t=1: a_{t1+1} -> leads to state at turn t1+2\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> leads to state at turn t1+H\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? That doesn't match because after the last action we are at turn t1+H.\n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut note: the state after the last action (which is the H-th action) is at turn t1+H. So we must have at turn t1+H the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". This is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait: the index: after the sequence of H actions (from t=0 to t=H-1, so H actions) we have updated the state H times. The initial state is at turn t1. After one action, we are at turn t1+1. After H actions, we are at turn t1+H. So the position at turn t1+H is the result.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So that would be the position at the turn before the last action? \n\nLet me clarify with a small example: \n  At turn t1: we are at y0. \n  We take action a_{t1} (t=0) -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y1.\n  Then we take action a_{t1+1} (t=1) -> then at turn t1+2 we are at y2.\n\nIf we take H=2 actions, then we have two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}. The state after the first action is at turn t1+1 (y1) and after the second action at turn t1+2 (y2). The problem says we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+1} = 9? \n\nBut then we would have reached at turn t1+1? Then why take the second action?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the turn after the last action we are at 9? But then the turn is t1+H, so we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there is an inconsistency. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1. The action at t=0 is taken at turn t1, and it produces the state at turn t1+1. The action at t=H-1 is taken at turn t1+H-1, and it produces the state at turn t1+H. \n\nSo the state at turn t1+H is the result of the last action. But the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9? That would be the state at the turn when we are taking the last action, not after.\n\nThis is critical.\n\nLooking at the example output: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n\nand the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we are at turn t1+H. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1 we are taking the last action, and we are at the state that we entered at turn t1+H-1 (from the previous action). Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 and then we move to turn t1+H. So at the moment of turn t1+H-1, we are at a state that is the result of the previous action.\n\nSo if we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, that means we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn? Then we take an action? But the problem says we have to take H actions. Then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we move to turn t1+H and then we are at a new state? But we don't care about turn t1+H? We only care about turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut wait, the collision condition: we check at the turn we are on. So if we are at turn t1+H-1 at position (0,9), then we are on freeway 9? But freeway 9 is not defined. Actually, the freeways are 1 to 8. And the goal is (0,9). The note says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So when we are at y=9, there are no cars. And when we are at y=0, also no cars? The problem doesn't say, but the freeways are only 1-8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we are safe because there are no cars on y=9.\n\nBut note: we must have taken H actions to get there? How?\n\nExample: \n  Start at turn t1 (8): we are at (0,3). We want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=1: then we have one action: a_{t1} (at turn 8). Then after that action, at turn 9 we are at a new state. But we require at turn 8+H-1 = 8+1-1=8? So we require at turn 8 we are at 9? But we start at 3. So we cannot have H=1.\n\nIf H=6: then we require at turn 8+6-1=13 we are at 9.\n\nSo we are at turn 13 at position 9.\n\nBut how do we get there? We start at turn 8 at 3. Then we take 6 actions: \n  a8 (at turn8) -> to state at turn9\n  a9 (at turn9) -> to state at turn10\n  a10 -> turn11\n  a11 -> turn12\n  a12 -> turn13\n  a13? -> but wait, the last action is at t=5 (H-1=5) which is at turn8+5=13? Then the state after that action is at turn14. But we require the state at turn13 to be 9.\n\nSo actually, we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1 (i.e., at the moment we are about to take the last action) we are at 9? Then we don't need to take the last action? But we are taking H actions.\n\nAlternatively, note: the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? Then we take an action and update to the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t1 (8): state is (0,3). Then we take an action a8 and then at the beginning of turn9 we are at a new state.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn T is the state we are in for that entire turn? And then we take an action at the end of the turn to update for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the collision check at turn T: we are in state (0,y) at the beginning of turn T, and we are on freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and we check the car spans at turn T. Then we take an action and move to the state at turn T+1.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, then we are done? And we don't need to take an action at turn T.\n\nBut the problem says we take actions until we have reached (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. And we take H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. That means:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at (0,3) -> we take action a_{t1} -> then we update to turn t1+1 (state at beginning of turn t1+1)\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1: we are at state (which we want to be (0,9)) and then we take an action? But we don't need to? Actually, the problem says the sequence has H actions. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we still have to take an action at turn t1+H-1? Then we move to turn t1+H and we are at a new state.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Then after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we move to turn t1+H and we might be at 9 or 8 or 10 (but 10 is invalid). \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo we require that the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). But note: we take H actions, and the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we are at turn t1+H. But we don't care about turn t1+H. We only care that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). How did we get there?\n\nWe got there by taking H-1 actions: \n  a_{t1} (at turn t1) leads to state at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-2} (at turn t1+H-2) leads to state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then we take one more action? a_{t1+H-1}? But that would be the H-th action. Then we move to turn t1+H and we are at a new state.\n\nBut we don't require anything about turn t1+H. We only require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So the last action (the H-th action) is taken at turn t1+H-1, but we don't care what state we end up at turn t1+H? Then why take it?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H-1 actions? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me look at the output format:\n\n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nand then we have taken H actions. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the turn at which we take the last action) the player is at 9? \n\nBut no, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at a state, and then we take an action. We are not at 9 after the action? We are at 9 before the action? Then the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut how did we get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? That was the result of the action taken at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\n  a_{t1} -> moves from state at turn t1 to state at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-2} -> moves from state at turn t1+H-2 to state at turn t1+H-1\n\nand we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1? But we don't care about the state after that.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of H actions. And we require that at the turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the result of the previous actions. We then take an action at turn t1+H-1, but we are already at 9. So we are outputting an extra action? \n\nAlternatively, maybe we don't need to take that last action? But the problem says we take H actions and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. But we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action? \n\nI think the intended meaning is that we take H actions and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). But then the requirement should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9), and we have taken H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1). This is the standard interpretation.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLooking at the problem again: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the minimal H must be at least the time to go from 3 to 9: which is 6 steps up? But then if we go up every turn, after 6 actions we would be at turn8+6 = 14 at the beginning of turn14, we would be at 9? But then we require to be at 9 at turn8+H-1. So 8+H-1 = 14 -> H=7. Then we take 7 actions? \n\nBut we only need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps. So why 7? \n\nAlternatively, if we start at turn8 at position3, then after 6 actions (at turns 8,9,10,11,12,13) we are at turn14 at position9. But we require to be at position9 at turn8+H-1. So 8+H-1=14 -> H=7. Then we take 7 actions? But then at turn14 (which is the beginning of turn14) we are at 9, and then we take the 7th action at turn14? That would move us away.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn index in the state is the time after taking the actions. But the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are at (0,3) at turn t1.\n\nI think the intended meaning is:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at (0,3). We take action a_{t1}, and then at turn t1+1, we are at a new position.\n- We want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That means: after taking H-1 actions, we are at turn t1+H-1 and at position 9.\n\nThen the number of actions is H-1? But the problem says we take H actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and this has H actions. And we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut if we take H actions, then the last action is a_{t1+H-1} and it is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at turn t1+H. So the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, which is the result of the previous action (taken at turn t1+H-2). \n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have been moved there by the action at turn t1+H-2. So we only need H-1 actions to get to that state. But the problem requires H actions.\n\nUnless the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at turn t1+H, but we don't care about that state. And we only care that at turn t1+H-1 (at the beginning) we are at 9. But then the last action doesn't contribute to getting to 9.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nI think there might be a off-by-one in the problem statement. Given the time, I will assume that we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, after taking H actions. This is the typical setup.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me see the car update: it uses T (absolute turn) and they are given at turn t1. So we can only compute for turns >=t1.\n\nI will try to follow the requirement as stated: we require that at turn t1+H-1 (absolute) the player is at 9. And we take H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given: (0,3). Then we take action a_{t1} and that updates the state to turn t1+1. We don't care about the state at the beginning of turn t1+1 for the requirement of being at 9 until turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at 9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken to get there? From turn t1 to turn t1+H-2, we take H-1 actions, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take one more action at turn t1+H-1 (which is the H-th action) and then we go to turn t1+H.\n\nSo the minimal H will be the minimal number such that we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 (beginning of turn) after taking H-1 actions, and then we take the H-th action (which might be arbitrary? but we have to specify it).\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then a sequence of H actions.\n\nAnd we must avoid collision during the entire journey: from turn t1 (beginning) to turn t1+H-1 (beginning) we are at some y, and at that turn if y is between 1 and 8, we must not be in a car span.\n\nNote that at the beginning of turn t1 we are at y=3, and we have to check for collision at turn t1: are we in a car span on freeway 3 at turn8 (absolute)? \n\nSo we start by checking the initial state.\n\nLet's compute the car spans at turn8 for freeway3:\n\nFreeway3: cars: (-18, -29, right, 6), (60,49, right,6), (24,13, right,6)\n\nWait, (60,49) -> but 49<60, so tail=49, head=60? But the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so if originally given as (head, tail), then head is the larger one? In the data, for freeway3: first car: head=-18, tail=-29 -> so tail=-29, head=-18. Then the span at turn8: [ -29 + 6*(0), -18 + 6*(0) ] = [-29, -18] -> 0 is not in this.\n\nSecond car: (60,49) -> head=60, tail=49 -> span at turn8: [49,60] -> 0 not in.\nThird car: (24,13) -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn8, freeway3 is safe.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn8, so safe.\n\nNow, we want to be at y=9 at turn8+H-1.\n\nWe will do a BFS over (t, y) where t is the absolute turn minus 8 (i.e., t=0 for turn8, t=1 for turn9, etc.) and y is the row.\n\nWe start at (0,3) and we want to reach (H-1, 9) for the smallest H.\n\nBut note: we require the state at turn8+H-1 to be 9. The absolute turn at step t (from 0) is 8+t. So we require at step t = H-1 (so absolute turn8+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nAnd we take actions from step0 to stepH-1: but the action at step0 (t=0) is taken at absolute turn8 and moves us to state at step1 (turn9). The action at stepH-1 (t=H-1) is taken at absolute turn8+H-1 and then we move to state at stepH (turn8+H). But we don't care about stepH.\n\nSo in our BFS, we are looking for a path from (0,3) to (H-1,9) with H minimal.\n\nThe actions: at state (t, y) we choose an action a in {U, D, S} and then we get to state (t+1, y') where y' = y + dy, and y' in [0,9].\n\nBut we must ensure that at state (t, y) we are safe: if y is between 1 and 8, then at absolute turn = 8+t, the cars on freeway y must not have a span that contains 0.\n\nNote: the state (t,y) corresponds to the beginning of absolute turn = 8+t.\n\nWe do not check the state after the last action? We only care up to state (H-1,9). And at that state, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at absolute turn T = 8+t.\n\nLet's write a helper function to check if at (t,y) it is safe.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and absolute turn T = 8+t, we look at the cars on freeway k (from the given table).\n\nFor each car on freeway k: (head0, tail0, d, s) -> all are right-moving.\n\nThe span at T is [tail0 + s*(T-8), head0 + s*(T-8)] = [tail0 + s*t, head0 + s*t]\n\nThen 0 is in [A, B] if A<=0<=B.\n\nWe must avoid that for any car on freeway k if we are on that freeway (y=k) at turn T.\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\n  Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of steps (actions) taken to reach (t,y) from (0,3). But we are not accumulating steps, we are moving in time naturally.\n\nWe want to reach (t,9) for the smallest t (which is H-1) so that we can set H = t+1.\n\nBut note: t starts at 0, and we want the smallest t such that we can be at (t,9).\n\nWe will simulate t from 0 upwards.\n\nWe use a queue: (t, y, actions) but we want minimal t, so we do BFS in t.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Dijkstra but time is the step.\n\nBut note: we can only move to t+1.\n\nWe'll start:\n\n  at t=0: y=3.\n\n  Then we consider actions: U, D, S -> new y in {4,2,3} (if valid).\n\n  Then for each new state (t+1, y') we check if at (t+1, y') is safe? \n      But wait: the state (t+1, y') is at absolute turn 8+t+1 = 9+t.\n      And we are at y' at that turn.\n\n  But also, when we move to (t+1, y'), we are at that state at the beginning of turn 8+t+1.\n\n  However, we also have to check the intermediate state? No, because the only state we are in is at the beginning of the turn.\n\n  The only potential issue is that we might be at a freeway at the beginning of the turn and then we move away by an action, but the collision check is only at the beginning of the turn.\n\n  So we only need to check the state we are in at the beginning of the turn.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Let Q be a queue.\n  We start: (t=0, y=3) with no actions yet.\n\n  We want to record the path, so we'll store (t, y, path) but that might be heavy. Alternatively, we can store the parent information.\n\n  We'll create a 2D array: parent[t][y] = (prev_t, prev_y, action) but t can go up? We don't know the bound. We'll use a dictionary.\n\n  We know that the minimal time to go from 3 to 9 is 6 steps up, so t will be at most ... but we have to avoid cars, so we might need to wait.\n\n  We'll set a bound for t: say up to 100? But let's hope we find a solution within a few dozen steps.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      from collections import deque\n      queue = deque()\n      # state: (t, y)\n      start = (0,3)\n      queue.append((0,3))\n      # we'll create a visited set for (t,y) to avoid loops? But we might need to revisit with different paths? \n      # But if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, we only need one. And since we are doing BFS by t, we will get the minimal t for a given (t,y).\n\n      We are not worried about cycles because we want minimal t.\n\n      So we mark visited: dist[t][y] = the minimal number of actions taken? Actually, we are not counting actions, we are counting t. And we want the first time we reach (t,9).\n\n      We'll create a 2D array: best_time[y] = minimal t when we reached y? But we might have different t for the same y and we need to consider different paths because the safety depends on t.\n\n      So we do: visited[t][y] = True, and we only visit once per (t,y).\n\n  For each state (t,y) we consider:\n\n      if y==9 and t is the first time we reached 9, then we set H = t+1? and then we can stop.\n\n      But note: we require to be at 9 at turn t (which is absolute turn8+t). And then we will have taken t actions? \n\n      How many actions have we taken to get to (t,y)? We have taken t actions: from t0=0 to t-1? \n\n      Because: \n        at t0=0: we start at (0,3) -> we haven taken no action yet.\n        then we take an action to get to (1,y1): so at t=1 we have taken 1 action.\n\n      So to get to (t,y) we have taken t actions.\n\n      But we require to be at 9 at turn8+t, and we have taken t actions? Then H would be the number of actions = t, and then the turn at which we are at 9 is 8+t. But we require that turn to be 8+H-1. \n\n      So: 8+H-1 = 8+t  => H-1 = t => H = t+1.\n\n      So if we reach (t,9), then we have taken t actions to get there, and then we will output a sequence of H = t+1 actions? But then we have only taken t actions, so we need one more action? \n\n      But the problem requires H actions and then we are at 9 at turn8+H-1. \n\n      If we are at (t,9) at step t, then that is at turn8+t. We set H = t+1, then turn8+H-1 = 8+t. So we are at 9 at turn8+t, which is 8+H-1. And we have taken actions for t steps (from 0 to t-1) and we will take one more action? \n\n      But then the last action (the t-th action, which is the H-1 = t-th action) is taken at turn8+t, and then we move to turn8+t+1. But we are outputting that last action, even though after that action we are not at 9 anymore? \n\n      The problem doesn't require that we remain at 9. It only requires that at turn8+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n      So if we are at 9 at turn8+t (which is 8+H-1) and then we take an action at that turn, we are then at turn8+t+1 at a new state. But that new state is not required to be 9.\n\n      So the last action is taken at turn8+t = 8+H-1, and it can be any action.\n\n      Therefore, when we find a state (t,9), we then know that we can output the path that took us to (t,9) and then one more arbitrary action (say S) to make it H actions. But the problem says the sequence is to reach (0,9) at turn8+H-1. And we are there at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action. So the minimal H is t+1.\n\n      However, we might find a path that gets to (t,9) and then we can stop? But we have to output H = t+1 actions.\n\n      So in the BFS, we stop when we first reach (t,9) for some t. Then we set H = t+1, and the actions are the actions that brought us to (t,9) (which are t actions) and then one more action (we can choose S, for example).\n\n      But is that minimal? We are asked for minimal H. And we are doing BFS in t, so the first time we hit 9 is with minimal t, then H = t+1 is minimal.\n\n      However, we might have a path that gets to 9 at an earlier t, but then we add one action -> H = t+1. If we find a path to 9 at t=6, then H=7. If we find at t=5, then H=6. So we want the smallest t for which we can reach 9.\n\n      But can we reach 9 in t=5? \n        We start at y=3 at t=0. To go to 9, we need 6 steps up. So t=6 is the earliest we can be at 9 by going up continuously. But we might go up and down and then up? That would take more steps.\n\n      So minimal t is 6. Then H=7.\n\n      But wait, if we are at 9 at t=6 (absolute turn8+6=14), then we take an action at turn14 (the 7th action) and then we are at turn15. And we require that at turn8+7-1=14 we are at 9. That matches.\n\n      So the minimal H is 7.\n\n      But can we do it in H=6? Then we require to be at 9 at turn8+6-1=13. That means we must be at 9 at t=5 (since 8+5=13). But we start at 3 at t=0. To get to 9 in 5 actions: we need to go up by 6 in 5 steps? That's not possible because each step can only move by 1. So minimal H is 7.\n\n      Therefore, we are going to BFS until we find a path to (t,9) for some t. We take the minimal t. Then we output the actions that got us to (t,9) (which are t actions) and then one more action (say S) as the last action.\n\n      But note: we must ensure that the last action does not cause a collision? However, the last action is taken at the state (t,9) and then we move to (t+1, y') where y' could be 9 (if we choose S) or 8 or 10 (invalid). But we are not required to avoid collision after the goal. And at the state (t,9) we are safe because y=9 has no cars. Then we take an action: if we choose S, we stay at 9? Or if we choose U, we cannot go above 9, so we stay at 9? Similarly, D: we go to 8. But we are not required to be safe after turn8+H-1.\n\n      So we can choose any action for the last one. To be safe, we can choose S.\n\n      But note: when we are at (t,9) and we choose S, then at the next state we are at (t+1,9) and then we would be safe? But we don't care.\n\n      So in summary:\n\n        We do BFS for states (t,y) for t>=0, y in [0,9], until we find a state (t,9).\n\n        Then the number of actions in the path is t (to get to (t,9)) and we add one more action (S) to make it H = t+1 actions.\n\n        The actions in the path: \n            a0 at turn8 (state0) -> to state1\n            a1 at turn9 (state1) -> to state2\n            ...\n            a_{t-1} at turn8+t-1 (state at t-1) -> to state at t (which is 9)\n\n        Then the last action: a_t = S at turn8+t.\n\n        The sequence: \n            Turn8: a0\n            Turn9: a1\n            ...\n            Turn8+t: a_t = S\n\n        And H = t+1.\n\n        We require that the state at turn8+t is 9, which is satisfied.\n\n      But note: we must avoid collision in the entire path: from state0 to state at t. And the last action (at turn8+t) is taken at state (t,9) which is safe, and then we go to state (t+1, y') which is not checked.\n\n      So we only care about states (0,3) to (t,9).\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll do a BFS (by time t) for states (t,y) for t from 0 upwards.\n\n  We'll keep a 2D array: visited[t][y] (but t can be large, we'll use a dictionary or set) and also we keep the parent: \n      parent[t][y] = (t_prev, y_prev, action) \n      where from (t_prev, y_prev) we took action 'action' to get to (t, y)\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let Q = deque()\n      Start: (0,3) -> mark visited[0][3]=True, parent[0][3] = None.\n\n      while Q:\n          pop (t,y)\n          if y==9: \n              we break and set goal = (t,y)\n          Otherwise, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n              y_new = y + dy (with dy: U->+1, D->-1, S->0), bounded to [0,9]\n              t_new = t+1\n              Check if (t_new, y_new) is safe? \n                  To check: at absolute turn = 8+t_new, and if y_new is in [1,8], then for all cars on freeway y_new, check if 0 is in any span.\n                  If y_new is 0 or 9, then safe.\n              Also check if we haven't visited (t_new, y_new) already? But we might have multiple ways to get to (t_new, y_new) but we are doing BFS by t, so we only need to visit once per (t,y).\n\n          If safe and not visited, mark visited and set parent, and enqueue.\n\n      Then, if we found a goal (t,9), then we backtrack to get the actions: \n          actions = []\n          state = (t,9)\n          while parent[state] is not None:\n              (t_prev, y_prev, action) = parent[state]\n              actions.append(action)\n              state = (t_prev, y_prev)\n\n          Then reverse actions: so the first action (from (0,3)) is first.\n\n      Then we have t actions. Then we append one more action (S) at the end.\n\n      Then we output the sequence of actions for turns from 8 to 8+t (inclusive).\n\n      The sequence has t+1 actions.\n\n  We start BFS at t=0 and go until we find 9.\n\n  We must be careful with the bound of t. The minimal t is 6, but we might have to wait, so we might go beyond.\n\nLet's hope we find a solution quickly.\n\nNow, we write a function safe(t, y) that given relative time t and y, returns whether at absolute turn T=8+t, being on freeway y is safe.\n\n  If y==0 or y==9: return True.\n\n  Else: \n      freeway = y\n      Get the list of cars for that freeway from the table.\n\n      For each car: (head0, tail0, d, s) -> note: d is always 'right' in this problem.\n      Then the span at T=8+t: \n          tail = tail0 + s * t   [because T-8 = t]\n          head = head0 + s * t\n          Then the span is [tail, head] (since it's right-moving, and tail0<=head0? In the data, we have:\n\n          For freeway1: (-16,-27,right,4) -> head0=-16, tail0=-27 -> so tail0<=head0? But -27<-16, so yes.\n          So the span is [tail, head] = [tail0 + s*t, head0 + s*t]\n\n      Then check if 0 is in [tail, head]? i.e., tail<=0<=head.\n\n      If any car on freeway y has that, then unsafe -> return False.\n\n      Else, True.\n\nBut note: in the table, for freeway6: (-39,-50,right,3) -> head0=-39, tail0=-50 -> so tail0<=head0? -50<=-39 -> yes.\n\nfreeway7: (0,-23,right,24) -> head0=0, tail0=-23 -> then at any t, the span is [ -23+24*t, 0+24*t ].\n\nFor example, at t=0: [ -23, 0] -> 0 is included? So at turn8 (t=0) if we were on freeway7, we would be in collision? But we start at freeway3 at turn8, so safe.\n\nBut if we move to freeway7 at a later turn, we must check.\n\nLet's compute for freeway7 at t=0: [ -23, 0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at turn8.\n\nBut at t=1: [ -23+24, 0+24] = [1,24] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nAt t=2: [ -23+48, 48] = [25,48] -> safe.\n\nAt t=3: [ -23+72, 72] = [49,72] -> safe.\n\nBut note: at t=0: unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same as freeway7: (0,-23,right,24) -> same.\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at t=0? But we are at freeway3 at t=0.\n\nNow, we are ready to code.\n\nBut note: the BFS: we start at (0,3). Then we try actions: U, D, S -> new states (1,4), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nCheck safety at (1,4): \n   freeway4: cars: (-18, -29, right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6) -> wait, the table has freeway4 same as freeway3? \n   | 4 | (-18, -29, right, 6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6) |\n\n   At t=1: \n        car1: [-29+6*1, -18+6*1] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in\n        car2: [49+6, 60+6] = [55,66] -> no\n        car3: [13+6,24+6] = [19,30] -> no\n   so safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): freeway2: same as freeway1? \n   freeway2: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n   t=1: \n        car1: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23, -12] -> safe\n        car2: [9+4,20+4]=[13,24] -> safe\n        car3: [45+4,56+4]=[49,60] -> safe\n\n(1,3): freeway3: same as at t=0? \n        car1: [-29, -18] -> becomes at t=1: [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23, -12] -> safe\n        car2: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66] -> safe\n        car3: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30] -> safe\n\nSo all three are safe at t=1.\n\nThen we continue.\n\nWe want to get to 9 in the fewest t. We'll go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we might run into a car? So we have to check.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we find (t,9) for minimal t.\n\nWe'll code the safe function:\n\n  def is_safe(t, y):\n      if y==0 or y==9:\n          return True\n      # absolute turn = 8 + t\n      cars = car_dict[y]   # list of cars for freeway y: each car is (head0, tail0, d, s) but d is always 'right'\n      for car in cars:\n          head0, tail0, d, s = car\n          # It's right-moving: span at t (relative) = [tail0 + s*t, head0 + s*t]\n          # Note: we assume tail0 <= head0? Yes, from the data.\n          A = tail0 + s * t\n          B = head0 + s * t\n          if A <= 0 <= B:\n              return False\n      return True\n\nWe'll create car_dict:\n\n  car_dict = {\n      1: [(-16, -27, 'right', 4), (20, 9, 'right', 4), (56, 45, 'right', 4)],\n      2: [(-16, -27, 'right', 4), (20, 9, 'right', 4), (56, 45, 'right', 4)],\n      3: [(-18, -29, 'right', 6), (60, 49, 'right', 6), (24, 13, 'right', 6)],\n      4: [(-18, -29, 'right', 6), (60, 49, 'right', 6), (24, 13, 'right', 6)],\n      5: [(24, 13, 'right', 12), (-12, -23, 'right', 12), (-48, -59, 'right', 12)],\n      6: [(-39, -50, 'right', 3)],\n      7: [(0, -23, 'right', 24)],\n      8: [(0, -23, 'right', 24)]\n  }\n\nBut note: in freeway5, one car is (24,13,...): so head0=24, tail0=13 -> then at t=0: [13,24] -> safe.\n\n  freeway5 at t=0: \n      car1: [13,24] -> safe\n      car2: [-23, -12] -> safe? 0 not in, because -23<=0<=-12? 0 is not between -23 and -12? Actually, -23<=0 is true, but 0<=-12 is false -> so 0 is not in [ -23, -12]? \n          But note: the span is [tail, head] = [ -23, -12] -> and -23<=0<=-12 is false because 0>-12? So not in.\n      car3: [-59, -48] -> safe.\n\n  So safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for a right-moving car, the span is [tau, h] and tau is the tail and h is the head. And the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? So the car covers from tau to h. Then 0 is in the span if tau<=0<=h.\n\nBut in the second car of freeway5: tail0=-23, head0=-12 -> so the car is from -23 to -12. Then 0 is not in that interval.\n\n  So the condition is: if A<=0 and 0<=B, then in.\n\n  But note: if the car is moving right, then at time t, the tail is at A = tail0 + s*t, and head at B = head0 + s*t, and we require A<=0<=B.\n\n  For the second car of freeway5 at t=0: A=-23, B=-12 -> -23<=0 is true, but 0<=-12 is false -> so 0 is not in.\n\n  But what if the car is moving left? We don't have any, so skip.\n\nNow, we run BFS.\n\nWe'll set up:\n\n  from collections import deque\n  # We use a queue: (t, y, path) but path might be long, so we store parent pointers.\n\n  We'll use:\n      parent = {}  # key: (t,y), value: (t_prev, y_prev, action_taken_from_prev)\n      visited = set() \n\n  Start: (0,3) -> visited.add((0,3))\n\n  queue = deque([(0,3)])\n\n  found = None\n\n  while queue:\n      (t,y) = queue.popleft()\n      if y==9:\n          found = (t,y)\n          break\n      # next states: t+1, y+dy for dy in [U: +1, D: -1, S:0] and clamp to [0,9]\n      for action in ['U','D','S']:\n          if action=='U':\n              y_new = y+1\n              if y_new>9: \n                  y_new=9\n          elif action=='D':\n              y_new = y-1\n              if y_new<0:\n                  y_new=0\n          else: # S\n              y_new = y\n\n          # We are going to state (t+1, y_new)\n          t_new = t+1\n          # Check if safe at (t_new, y_new)\n          if not is_safe(t_new, y_new):\n              continue\n\n          # If we have not visited (t_new, y_new)\n          if (t_new, y_new) not in visited:\n              visited.add((t_new, y_new))\n              parent[(t_new, y_new)] = (t, y, action)\n              queue.append((t_new, y_new))\n\n  If found: \n      (t_goal, y_goal) = found  # which is (t,9)\n      # Then we backtrack to get the actions that led to (t,9)\n      actions = []\n      state = (t_goal, 9)\n      while state != (0,3):\n          t_prev, y_prev, action = parent[state]\n          actions.append(action)\n          state = (t_prev, y_prev)\n      actions.reverse()   # now actions[0] is the first action (from (0,3) to (1,y1))\n\n      Then we have t actions. We need to output H = t+1 actions: the t we have and then one more (S).\n\n      So the sequence: \n          Turn8: actions[0]\n          Turn9: actions[1]\n          ...\n          Turn8+t-1: actions[t-1]\n          Turn8+t: 'S'\n\n      But note: the last action (the S) is taken at turn8+t, which is the last action of the sequence.\n\n      The total number of actions: t+1 = (t_goal)+1.\n\n      We output:\n          Turn 8: actions[0]\n          Turn 9: actions[1]\n          ...\n          Turn 8+t: 'S'\n\n      Since t_goal = t, then the turn for the last action is 8+t_goal.\n\n      And we are at 9 at turn8+t_goal (the beginning of turn8+t_goal) and then we take the last action at that turn.\n\n  If not found? Then we run until we find.\n\nBut we know we can always go up? But we have to avoid cars.\n\nLet's hope we find quickly.\n\nWe'll run and see.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait sometimes? For example, if a freeway is unsafe at a particular t, we might wait by moving down and then up? But we are going from 3 to 9, so we want to go up.\n\nWe'll run the BFS.\n\nFirst, we need to check the safe function carefully.\n\nWe'll create the car_dict as described.\n\nNote: in the table, freeway5 has a car (24,13,...) -> we store as (24,13,'right',12). But in our safe function, we use tail0 and head0. Here, head0=24, tail0=13.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the car is given as (head, tail). For a right-moving car, the span is [tail, head] at t1. So we use tail0 and head0 as given.\n\nBut in freeway5, the car (24,13): tail0=13, head0=24? Then at t, the span is [13+12*t, 24+12*t]. \n\nBut note: the problem says for a right-moving car: \n  at t1: [tau, h] -> becomes at T: [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo we are storing (head, tail) as (h, tau). So we have to use:\n  tail0 = tau (which is the second number in the tuple) \n  head0 = h (the first number)\n\nBut the problem gives the car as: (head, tail, direction, speed). So for freeway5: first car: (24,13,...) -> head=24, tail=13.\n\nSo in the safe function, we use:\n  A = tail0 + s * t   # because tail0 is the tail at t1\n  B = head0 + s * t\n\nBut in the car_dict, for freeway5, we stored (24,13,...) as (head0, tail0) = (24,13). So that matches.\n\nHowever, note: in the table, freeway2 has (20,9) -> so head0=20, tail0=9.\n\nBut in the safe function, we assume the car is stored as (head0, tail0, d, s). So we use tail0 and head0 as given.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the car is (head, tail, ...). So we are storing in the same order.\n\nNow, we code.\n\nBut note: freeway5 also has (-12,-23,...) -> head0=-12, tail0=-23.\n\nLet me test safe at freeway5 at t=0: \n  car1: [13,24] -> 0 not in\n  car2: [-23, -12] -> 0 not in? because -23<=0<=-12 -> 0<=-12 is false -> not in.\n  car3: [-59,-48] -> not in.\n\nAt t=1: \n  car1: [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36] -> not in.\n  car2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in? because -11<=0<=0 -> true. So unsafe.\n\nSo at t=1, freeway5 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2: \n  car1: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe\n  car2: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe\n  car3: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe\n\nSo freeway5 is unsafe only at t=1.\n\nNow, we run BFS.\n\nWe start at (0,3). We try:\n\n  t=0: y=3 -> safe? yes.\n\n  Then we go to t=1: \n      U: y=4 -> safe? freeway4 at t=1: \n          cars: [(-18,-29,6), (60,49,6), (24,13,6)]\n          car1: [-29+6= -23, -18+6=-12] -> safe\n          car2: [49+6=55, 60+6=66] -> safe\n          car3: [13+6=19,24+6=30] -> safe -> so safe.\n\n      D: y=2 -> freeway2 at t=1: \n          cars: [(-16,-27,4) -> becomes [-27+4=-23, -16+4=-12] -> safe\n                 (20,9,4) -> [9+4=13,20+4=24] -> safe\n                 (56,45,4) -> [45+4=49,56+4=60] -> safe -> safe.\n\n      S: y=3 -> freeway3 at t=1: safe as above.\n\n  So we have three states at t=1: (1,4), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nNow, from (1,4): we can go to (2,5), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n  Check (2,5): freeway5 at t=2 -> we computed: safe? yes, as above.\n\n  Check (2,3): freeway3 at t=2: \n        car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe\n        car2: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe\n        car3: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe\n\n  (2,4): freeway4 at t=2: same as freeway3? \n        car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe\n        car2: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe\n        car3: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe\n\nSo all safe.\n\nFrom (1,2): we can go to (2,3), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n  (2,1): freeway1 at t=2: \n        cars: [(-16,-27,4) -> [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8] -> safe\n               (20,9,4) -> [9+8=17,20+8=28] -> safe\n               (56,45,4) -> [45+8=53,56+8=64] -> safe\n\n  (2,2): freeway2: same as freeway1: safe.\n\n  (2,3): already seen.\n\nFrom (1,3): to (2,4), (2,2), (2,3) -> already considered.\n\nSo at t=2, we have: y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, we want to get to 9 as fast as possible. The optimal is to go up.\n\nFrom (2,5): we can go to (3,6), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n  (3,6): freeway6 at t=3: \n        cars: [(-39,-50,3)] -> [-50+9, -39+9] = [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\n  (3,4): freeway4 at t=3: \n        car1: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in? -> unsafe! So skip.\n        Actually, we have to check: \n            A = -29 + 6*3 = -29+18 = -11\n            B = -18 + 18 = 0\n            So [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\n  (3,5): freeway5 at t=3: \n        car1: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n        car2: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe\n        car3: [-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe -> safe.\n\nSo from (2,5): we can go to (3,6) and (3,5) and (3,4) is unsafe.\n\nFrom (2,4): to (3,5), (3,3), (3,4) -> (3,4) unsafe, (3,3) and (3,5) safe? \n  (3,3): freeway3 at t=3: \n        car1: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> unsafe? same as freeway4? \n        But freeway3 has the same cars as freeway4? \n        Yes, freeway3 and 4 are identical. So unsafe.\n\n  (3,5): safe.\n\nSo we can go from (2,4) to (3,5) and (3,3) unsafe, (3,4) unsafe.\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe want to get to 9. We'll go from (3,6) to (4,7) but freeway7 at t=4: \n   car: [0, -23, 24] -> at t=4: \n        A = -23 + 24*4 = -23+96=73\n        B = 0+96=96\n        [73,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway7 at t=0: [ -23, 0] -> unsafe, but at t=4: safe.\n\nSo (4,7) is safe.\n\nBut we can also go from (3,5) to (4,6), (4,4), (4,5). \n\n  (4,4): freeway4 at t=4: \n        car1: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in? -5<=0<=6 -> true -> unsafe.\n\n  (4,5): freeway5 at t=4: \n        car1: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> safe\n        car2: [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36] -> safe\n        car3: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> unsafe? because -11<=0<=0 -> true.\n\n  So (4,5) is unsafe.\n\n  (4,6): freeway6 at t=4: \n        car: [-50+12, -39+12] = [-38, -27] -> safe.\n\nSo from (3,5) we can only go to (4,6) and (4,4) unsafe, (4,5) unsafe.\n\nNow, from (3,6): to (4,7), (4,5), (4,6). \n   (4,5) unsafe, (4,6) safe, (4,7) safe.\n\nSo we have states at t=4: (4,6) from (3,5) and (3,6), and (4,7) from (3,6).\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe'll skip the detailed BFS and hope we can go up: from (4,7) to (5,8) -> freeway8 at t=5: \n   car: (0,-23,24) -> at t=5: \n        A = -23+24*5 = -23+120=97\n        B = 0+120=120\n        [97,120] -> safe.\n\nSo (5,8) is safe.\n\nThen from (5,8) to (6,9) -> that's our goal.\n\nSo we found: \n  t_goal = 6, y_goal=9.\n\nThen H = 6+1 = 7.\n\nThe actions to get to (6,9) are 6 actions.\n\nWe backtrack the path:\n\n  (6,9) came from (5,8) by action 'U' (because 8+1=9)\n\n  (5,8) came from (4,7) by action 'U' (7+1=8)\n\n  (4,7) came from (3,6) by action 'U' (6+1=7)\n\n  (3,6) came from (2,5) by action 'U' (5+1=6)\n\n  (2,5) came from (1,4) by action 'U' (4+1=5)\n\n  (1,4) came from (0,3) by action 'U' (3+1=4)\n\nSo the actions: \n  step0: U (from (0,3) to (1,4))\n  step1: U (to (2,5))\n  step2: U (to (3,6))\n  step3: U (to (4,7))\n  step4: U (to (5,8))\n  step5: U (to (6,9))\n\nThen we add one more action: S at step6 (which is at turn8+6=14)\n\nSo the sequence of 7 actions:\n\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: U\n  Turn14: S\n\nBut we must check safety along the way.\n\nWe already know that the states we visited are safe by the BFS.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n  t0: (0,3): safe? freeway3 at turn8: safe (as computed) -> yes.\n\n  t1: (1,4): freeway4 at turn9: \n        car1: [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n        car2: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66] -> safe\n        car3: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30] -> safe -> safe.\n\n  t2: (2,5): freeway5 at turn10 (t=2): \n        car1: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe\n        car2: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12] -> safe? 0 not in -> safe\n        car3: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe -> safe.\n\n  t3: (3,6): freeway6 at turn11 (t=3): \n        car: [-50+9, -39+9]=[-41,-30] -> safe.\n\n  t4: (4,7): freeway7 at turn12 (t=4): \n        car: [-23+24*4, 0+24*4] = [-23+96, 96] = [73,96] -> safe.\n\n  t5: (5,8): freeway8 at turn13 (t=5): \n        car: [-23+24*5, 0+120] = [97,120] -> safe.\n\n  t6: (6,9): safe.\n\nThen the last action at turn14: we are at (6,9) and take S -> then we go to (7,9) but we don't care.\n\nSo the path is valid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence is:\n\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: U\n  Turn14: S\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1 + 1\", etc.\n\nSo:\n\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n  Turn 13: U\n  Turn 14: S\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn14, which is t1+H-1 = 8+7-1=14, so that matches.\n\nWe output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut note: we can choose any action for the last one, but S is safe.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that we are not forced to take a different action? But the problem does not require anything after turn14. So S is fine.\n\nBut what if we take U at the last step? Then we try to go to 10, but it's clamped to 9. So same as S.\n\nOr D: then we go to 8 at turn15, but we don't care.\n\nBut to be clean, we choose S.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) and a sequence of actions for the player to move from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) to the target position \\((0, 9)\\) on a 2D grid, while avoiding collisions with cars moving on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, and collisions occur if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and any car on that freeway spans the x-position 0 at that turn.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The player starts at position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\). The goal is to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) such that at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\). The player must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at every turn. The cars move right with given speeds, and their positions update linearly over time.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use BFS to explore the shortest path from the initial position to the target. Each state in the BFS is represented as \\((t, y)\\), where \\(t\\) is the number of turns elapsed from the start (relative time), and \\(y\\) is the current vertical position. The BFS explores all possible moves (U, D, S) from each state, ensuring the next state is within bounds and collision-free.\n\n3. **Collision Check**: For each state \\((t, y)\\), we check if the player would collide with any car on freeway \\(y\\) at absolute turn \\(T = 8 + t\\). A collision occurs if any car's span (computed as \\([ \\text{tail} + s \\cdot t, \\text{head} + s \\cdot t ]\\) for right-moving cars) includes 0.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target state \\((t, 9)\\) is found, we backtrack to reconstruct the sequence of actions. The minimal \\(H\\) is \\(t + 1\\), where \\(t\\) is the relative time to reach \\(y = 9\\). The sequence includes the \\(t\\) actions to reach \\((t, 9)\\) and an additional action (S) at turn \\(t_1 + t\\) to satisfy the sequence length \\(H\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Define car information for each freeway\ncar_dict = {\n    1: [(-16, -27, 'right', 4), (20, 9, 'right', 4), (56, 45, 'right', 4)],\n    2: [(-16, -27, 'right', 4), (20, 9, 'right', 4), (56, 45, 'right', 4)],\n    3: [(-18, -29, 'right', 6), (60, 49, 'right', 6), (24, 13, 'right', 6)],\n    4: [(-18, -29, 'right', 6), (60, 49, 'right', 6), (24, 13, 'right', 6)],\n    5: [(24, 13, 'right', 12), (-12, -23, 'right', 12), (-48, -59, 'right', 12)],\n    6: [(-39, -50, 'right', 3)],\n    7: [(0, -23, 'right', 24)],\n    8: [(0, -23, 'right', 24)]\n}\n\ndef is_safe(t, y):\n    if y == 0 or y == 9:\n        return True\n    cars = car_dict[y]\n    for car in cars:\n        head0, tail0, d, s = car\n        A = tail0 + s * t\n        B = head0 + s * t\n        if A <= 0 <= B:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    parent = {}\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque()\n    start = (0, 3)\n    visited.add(start)\n    queue.append(start)\n    parent[start] = None\n    found = None\n\n    while queue:\n        t, y = queue.popleft()\n        if y == 9:\n            found = (t, y)\n            break\n        for action in ['U', 'D', 'S']:\n            if action == 'U':\n                y_new = y + 1\n                if y_new > 9:\n                    y_new = 9\n            elif action == 'D':\n                y_new = y - 1\n                if y_new < 0:\n                    y_new = 0\n            else:\n                y_new = y\n            t_new = t + 1\n            state_new = (t_new, y_new)\n            if not is_safe(t_new, y_new):\n                continue\n            if state_new not in visited:\n                visited.add(state_new)\n                parent[state_new] = (t, y, action)\n                queue.append(state_new)\n\n    if found is None:\n        print(\"No solution found\")\n        return\n\n    t_goal, y_goal = found\n    actions = []\n    state = (t_goal, y_goal)\n    while parent[state] is not None:\n        t_prev, y_prev, action = parent[state]\n        actions.append(action)\n        state = (t_prev, y_prev)\n    actions.reverse()\n    actions.append('S')\n    H = len(actions)\n\n    for i in range(H):\n        turn = 8 + i\n        print(f\"Turn {turn}: {actions[i]}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The car positions and movement details for each freeway are stored in `car_dict`.\n2. **Safety Check**: The `is_safe` function checks if the player at position \\(y\\) at relative time \\(t\\) (absolute turn \\(8 + t\\)) is not colliding with any car on freeway \\(y\\).\n3. **BFS Execution**: The BFS starts from the initial state \\((0, 3)\\) and explores all possible moves (U, D, S) to new states \\((t+1, y')\\), ensuring they are within bounds and collision-free.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Upon reaching \\(y = 9\\), the path is reconstructed by backtracking from the goal state to the start, collecting actions.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Also, when moving from one freeway to another, note that at the moment of the turn T, the player is only on the starting freeway and then moves to the next. So if we move at turn T from y to y+1, then at turn T we are only on y, and at turn T+1 we are on y+1.\n\nWe must output a sequence of actions (U, D, S) starting from turn t1 (which is 9) until the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe are to avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8. The cars are given for each freeway (k=1 to 8). For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the car's head is the rightmost point and the tail is the leftmost? Actually, note the update:\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] (so h is the head, which is the larger coordinate) and then at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  - Left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll cars are labeled as \"right\". So they are all right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for a car with (h, tau, right, s) at time T (relative to t1, which is 9), the span is:\n  [tau + s*(T-9), h + s*(T-9)]\n\nAnd the player collides with that car on freeway k at time T if the player is on freeway k at time T and 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(T-9), h + s*(T-9)].\n\nNote: the freeways are fixed: freeway 1 at y=1, freeway 2 at y=2, ... freeway 8 at y=8.\n\nOur player starts at y=4. We can move up (U: y increases by 1), down (D: y decreases by 1), or stay (S: y stays). But note: y must be in [0,9]. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search. The state is (time, y). Time starts at t1=9. We are to plan from time 9 onward.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move continuously with time, so at each time step T (starting from 9), we must check for collision on the freeway we are currently at.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8. If we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? The problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\". So when we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't have to worry about cars.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9), which is safe.\n\nWe start at (0,4) at time 9. We are at freeway 4 at time 9? Actually, the player is at (0,4) at time t1=9, so we start on freeway 4.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway (1 to 8) at a time T when there is a car on that freeway that covers 0.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions that minimizes H (the number of turns from the current turn t1=9 until the turn when we are at y=9). Note: at the turn when we are at y=9, we are done. We don't have to wait.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (time, y) because we want the minimal number of turns. The time is absolute, but note that the cars move linearly and we can compute the car positions for any future time.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting from 9 and increasing), and y in {0,1,...,9}.\n\nThe initial state: (9,4)\n\nThe goal: any state (t,9) for which we have reached y=9 (and we are done at the first time we reach it).\n\nFrom a state (t, y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} and then:\n\n  y_next = y + delta, where:\n      U: y_next = y+1 (if y<9)\n      D: y_next = y-1 (if y>0)\n      S: y_next = y\n\nBut note: if we are at y=0, we cannot go down. Similarly, at y=9, we cannot go up.\n\nHowever, we are starting at y=4 and we want to go to y=9, so we will be moving up mostly.\n\nBut we might have to wait (S) or even go down to avoid a collision? Let's see.\n\nAfter choosing the action, we move to state (t+1, y_next). But note that during the turn t, we are at y (the starting y) for the entire turn? And then after the action, we are at y_next at the next turn.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn t, we are at freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and we must check that at time t, there is no car on freeway y that covers 0.\n\nImportant: even if we are about to move, at the moment of turn t, we are still on y. Then we move to y_next at turn t+1.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n- At the beginning of turn t: we are at (0, y)\n- Then we choose an action a, which will update the position for the next turn.\n- During the entire turn t, we are present at (0,y). Therefore, we must not collide with any car on freeway y at time t.\n\nSo when we are at state (t, y), we are going to be present at (0,y) at time t. We must check that for freeway y (if y in [1,8]), there is no car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nIf there is, then we cannot be in that state.\n\nWe start at (9,4). We must check: at time 9, on freeway 4, are there any cars that cover 0?\n\nSimilarly, when we move to (10, y_next), we must check at time 10 on freeway y_next (if y_next in [1,8]) for collision.\n\nBut note: when we are at (9,4), we are at time 9 and freeway 4. Then we choose an action. The next state is (10, y_next). Then at time 10 we will be on freeway y_next.\n\nTherefore, in the state (t,y), we must ensure that at time t, if y is between 1 and 8, then there is no car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and each time the set of freeways that are safe? But time can go arbitrarily? However, we are looking for a minimal H, so we can bound H.\n\nWhat is the minimal H? Without obstacles, we need at least 5 moves (from 4 to 9: 5 up moves). But we might have to wait or detour.\n\nBut note: we can only move one step per turn. So the minimal number of moves is 5 (if we go up every turn). However, we might have to wait at some freeway to avoid a car.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we find the first time we hit y=9.\n\nWe'll consider the state (t, y) and we'll generate the next states by the three actions (if applicable).\n\nWe must check the current state (t,y) for safety: if y in [1,8], then we must check the cars on freeway y at time t.\n\nHow to check a freeway y at time t?\n\nWe are given the cars on freeway y at time t1=9. For a car (h, tau, d, s) on freeway y:\n\nSince d is right, the span at time t (absolute time) is:\n  [tau + s*(t-9), h + s*(t-9)]\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [tau + s*(t-9), h + s*(t-9)].\n\nNote: for a right-moving car, h is the head (the larger coordinate) and tau is the tail (the smaller). But in the data, we have:\n\nFor freeway 4: \n  cars: (-12, -23, right, 6), (-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nWait: let me check the representation. The update for right-moving says:\n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at time 9, the car (-12,-23,right,6) has span = [-23, -12]? But the problem says: \n  \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is at h and tail at tau? But note the update: \n  Right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the head h is the rightmost (larger) and tail tau is the leftmost (smaller). Therefore, at time 9, the car (-12,-23,right,6) has:\n  head = -12, tail = -23 -> so the span is [-23, -12] (because tau=-23, h=-12, so [tau, h] = [-23,-12]).\n\nSimilarly, the car (30,19,right,6) at time 9: head=30, tail=19 -> span [19,30].\n\nNow, we are at time t (absolute) and we want to know if 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(t-9), h + s*(t-9)].\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, right, s) at time t, the interval is [tau + s*(t-9), h + s*(t-9)].\n\nWe need to check for each car on the freeway if 0 is in that interval.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars, but we don't have any.\n\nNow, we are going to simulate from t=9 onward.\n\nWe'll do a BFS:\n\n  Let Q be a queue, and we start with state (t=9, y=4) and no actions so far.\n\n  We mark visited states to avoid cycles. But note: time increases, and we can also go down and then up? However, we are minimizing time, so we don't want to go back in y without reason? But sometimes we might have to wait? However, the state (t,y) is unique because t increases. So we don't need to mark by t and y? Actually, we can have the same y at different times. And we can have the same (t,y) from different paths? But we are doing BFS by time? Actually, we are expanding by time steps, so each state (t,y) is unique? Because t is increasing by one each step? Actually, we are moving one turn at a time. So the state (t,y) is uniquely defined by t and y.\n\n  However, we might have multiple ways to get to the same (t,y). But we are doing BFS and we want the minimal time? Actually, we are expanding by increasing t. So the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal.\n\n  But note: we can also have the same (t,y) by different paths? But we don't care because we are doing BFS by time (each action takes one turn). So we can use a visited set: if we have reached (t,y) then we don't need to consider it again because any later path to the same (t,y) would be the same or worse? Actually, because we are looking for the minimal time to reach y=9, and we are expanding by increasing t, we can mark (t,y) as visited and not revisit? But note: we might have a path that goes to (t,y) and then later goes to y=9, and we want the minimal t. However, if we are doing BFS in the time order (i.e., we consider all states at time t before t+1), then the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      Let dist[t][y] = the minimal time steps from start? Actually, we don't need that. We want the sequence.\n\n      We can use BFS:\n\n          queue: (t, y, path)   # path: list of actions from t1 to t-1? Actually, we are at time t and we have chosen actions for turns 9 to t-1.\n\n          But we can reconstruct the path by storing parent pointers.\n\n      Alternatively, we can store for each state (t,y) the previous state and the action taken.\n\n  However, since time and y are small (time we don't know, but we hope to find a solution quickly), we can do:\n\n      We'll let time t start at 9 and go upwards. We'll consider all states at time t, then generate states for time t+1.\n\n      We maintain a visited set: visited[t][y] = whether we have reached (t,y). But note: we might have multiple ways to get to (t,y) but we want the first one? Actually, we are doing BFS by time, so when we first reach (t,y) we have the minimal steps to that state. Then we mark it and never visit again.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Initialize: \n          queue = deque([ (9, 4) ])   # state (t,y)\n          visited = set of tuples (t,y). We start by adding (9,4).\n\n          parent: dictionary to store the parent state and the action taken to get to the current state? Or we can store the entire path? But that might be heavy.\n\n      Instead, we can store:\n\n          parent[t][y] = (t_prev, y_prev, action)  # the state we came from and the action taken at time t_prev that led to (t,y)\n\n      Then when we reach a goal, we can backtrack.\n\n      Goal: when we have y=9 at some time t. Then we can backtrack to get the sequence from time 9 to time t-1? Actually, the actions are taken at each time step.\n\n          The action at time t_prev (which is the time we were at before moving to time t_prev+1) leads to the state at time t_prev+1.\n\n      How we generate next states:\n\n          For a state (t,y) (at time t, we are at y) -> we first check that at time t, if y is in [1,8], then we must not be colliding. But wait: we are already in the state (t,y). How did we get here? We must have been safe at time t? Actually, we should check the state (t,y) for collision when we are about to use it? Actually, when we generate a state (t,y) from a previous state, we must check that at time t, if y is in [1,8], then it is safe.\n\n          However, note: we start at (9,4) and we know the state at time 9. But we must check (9,4) is safe? Yes.\n\n          Then, from (t,y), we consider the next action for the next state (t+1, y_next). But note: at time t, we are at y, and we are going to choose an action. Then at time t+1, we are at y_next.\n\n          But at time t, we are at y and we must be safe (which we already ensured when we entered (t,y)). Then we choose an action. Then at time t+1, we are at y_next. And at time t+1, we must be safe: meaning if y_next is in [1,8], then we must check that at time t+1, there is no car on freeway y_next that covers 0.\n\n          Therefore, when generating a new state (t+1, y_next):\n\n              if y_next is in [1,8]:\n                  for each car on freeway y_next:\n                      compute the interval [tau + s*( (t+1) - 9 ), h + s*((t+1)-9)]\n                      if 0 is in that interval, then this state is not safe -> skip.\n\n              Also, if y_next is 0 or 9, then no car -> safe.\n\n          Additionally, we must not generate states that are out of bounds: y_next must be between 0 and 9.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Start: (9,4) -> we must check that at time 9, freeway 4 is safe.\n\n          Then, from (9,4) we consider actions for turn 9: U, D, S -> leading to states at time 10.\n\n          But note: at time 9, we are at y=4. We are going to choose an action. Then at time 10, we are at y_next.\n\n          However, we already checked (9,4) is safe? Actually, when we start, we must check (9,4) is safe.\n\n          So:\n\n          Step 1: Check the starting state (9,4): \n              freeway 4: cars: \n                  car1: (-12,-23,right,6) -> at time 9: [ -23 + 6*(0) , -12 + 6*(0) ] = [-23, -12] -> 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n                  car2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59, -48] -> safe.\n                  car3: (30,19,right,6) -> [19,30] -> safe.\n\n          So (9,4) is safe.\n\n          Then we generate from (9,4) the next states:\n\n              Action U: y_next = 5 -> state (10,5)\n              Action D: y_next = 3 -> state (10,3)\n              Action S: y_next = 4 -> state (10,4)\n\n          Then we check each of these new states at time 10:\n\n              For (10,5): freeway 5 at time 10? \n                  freeway 5: cars: (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\n                  time_diff = 10-9 = 1\n                  car1: [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n                  car2: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe? \n                         but note: [1,12] does not include 0 -> safe.\n                  car3: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\n                  So (10,5) is safe.\n\n              For (10,3): freeway 3 at time 10?\n                  freeway 3: cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n                  time_diff=1\n                  car1: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17, -6] -> 0 is not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42] -> safe.\n                  car3: [19+6, 30+6] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n              For (10,4): freeway 4 at time 10?\n                  freeway 4: same cars as at time9? \n                  car1: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42] -> safe.\n                  car3: [19+6, 30+6] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n          So all three are safe. We add them to the queue.\n\n          Then we continue.\n\n          We are looking for the first time we get to y=9.\n\n          We'll break when we generate a state (t,9) that is safe? But note: at time t, we are at y=9 -> no cars, so safe. So the first time we get to y=9, we are done.\n\n          How many steps? Without obstacles, we could do:\n\n              t=9: y=4\n              t=10: y=5\n              t=11: y=6\n              t=12: y=7\n              t=13: y=8\n              t=14: y=9 -> done in 5 moves.\n\n          But we must check if that path is safe.\n\n          Let's check:\n\n            t=9: y=4 -> safe (we saw)\n            t=10: y=5 -> safe (we saw at time10 for y=5 is safe)\n            t=11: y=6 -> we need to check freeway6 at time11.\n\n            freeway6: only one car: (-36,-47,right,3)\n                time_diff = 11-9 = 2\n                span = [-47+3*2, -36+3*2] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\n            t=12: y=7 -> freeway7 at time12:\n                car: (24,1,right,24)\n                time_diff=3 -> [1+24*3, 24+24*3] = [1+72,24+72] = [73,96] -> safe.\n\n            t=13: y=8 -> freeway8 at time13:\n                car: (24,1,right,24) -> same as above? \n                [1+24*4, 24+24*4] = [1+96,24+96] = [97,120] -> safe.\n\n            t=14: y=9 -> safe.\n\n          So the direct path: U, U, U, U, U (5 moves) is safe.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H=5.\n\n          But wait: we have to output the sequence for turns starting at t1=9.\n\n          The actions:\n\n            Turn 9: U -> then at time10 we are at 5\n            Turn 10: U -> time11: 6\n            Turn 11: U -> time12: 7\n            Turn 12: U -> time13: 8\n            Turn 13: U -> time14: 9\n\n          So we reach at time14 (which is the 5th step after t1=9).\n\n          Therefore, the sequence is 5 actions: U, U, U, U, U.\n\n          But note: the player is at (0,4) at time9. Then at time10: (0,5), time11: (0,6), ... time14: (0,9).\n\n          We output:\n\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n\n          However, we must be cautious: are there any cars that might appear at these freeways at the times we are there? We checked:\n\n            freeway4 at time9: safe\n            freeway5 at time10: safe\n            freeway6 at time11: safe\n            freeway7 at time12: safe\n            freeway8 at time13: safe\n\n          So it's safe.\n\n          But let me double-check freeway5 at time10: we did car2: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> correct.\n\n          But wait: the car (0, -11, right, 12) at time10: \n              tail = -11 + 12*(10-9) = -11+12=1\n              head = 0 + 12*1 = 12\n              so [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway6 at time11: car (-36,-47,right,3) -> tail=-47+3*2=-41, head=-36+6=-30 -> [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\n          freeway7 at time12: car (24,1,right,24) -> tail=1+24*3=73, head=24+72=96 -> [73,96] -> safe.\n\n          freeway8 at time13: same car? Actually, freeway8 has the same car description: (24,1,right,24) -> so [1+24*4=97, 24+96=120] -> safe.\n\n          Therefore, the direct path is safe.\n\n          But wait: the problem says that at time T, if we are at y and then we move to y_next at time T+1, then at time T we are only on y and at time T+1 we are on y_next. So we don't check the freeway we are leaving at time T+1? Only the freeway we are at at time T.\n\n          So in the direct path:\n\n            At time9: y=4 -> check freeway4: safe.\n            At time10: y=5 -> check freeway5: safe.\n            At time11: y=6 -> check freeway6: safe.\n            At time12: y=7 -> check freeway7: safe.\n            At time13: y=8 -> check freeway8: safe.\n            At time14: y=9 -> no check.\n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here, H=5, so t from 0 to 4.\n\n          So:\n\n            t=0: a_{9} = U\n            t=1: a_{10} = U\n            t=2: a_{11} = U\n            t=3: a_{12} = U\n            t=4: a_{13} = U\n\n          But the output format:\n\n            Turn t_1: a_{t_1}   -> Turn 9: U\n            Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1} -> Turn 10: U\n            ...\n\n          So we output:\n\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n\n          But wait: at time13 we are at y=8, then we do U and at time14 we are at y=9. So the last action is at time13.\n\n          Therefore, the sequence is for turns 9 to 13.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5 (because we take 5 actions).\n\n          So we output 5 lines.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", meaning t from 0 to H-1, so H actions? Actually, the index t in the sequence: t=0,...,H-1, so the actions are at time t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          And then we are at (0,9) at time t1+H.\n\n          How many turns? We start at time t1=9. After H actions, we are at time t1+H.\n\n          Therefore, we need H=5.\n\n          But let me confirm: \n            Start: time9 -> y=4.\n            After 1st action (at time9): at time10, we are at y=5.\n            After 2nd: time11 -> y=6\n            After 3rd: time12 -> y=7\n            After 4th: time13 -> y=8\n            After 5th: time14 -> y=9.\n\n          So yes.\n\n          Therefore, we output 5 actions.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: what if the direct path is blocked at some point? Then we have to try alternatives.\n\n          But in this case, it is safe.\n\n          But let me check if there is a problem at time10 for freeway5: \n            The car (0,-11,right,12) at time10: [ -11+12, 0+12 ] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          But note: what about the other cars on freeway5? \n            (36,25,right,12) -> [25+12,36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n            (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n          So freeway5 at time10 is safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway6 at time11: only one car: (-36,-47,right,3) -> [-47+3*2, -36+3*2] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\n          But note: freeway6 has only one car? The table says:\n            | 6 | (-36, -47, right, 3) |\n\n          So yes.\n\n          Therefore, we can take the direct path.\n\n          But what if we had to wait? Then we would have to output a longer sequence. But we found a solution in 5.\n\n          We must make sure that there isn't a solution in less than 5? That's impossible because we need to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps.\n\n          So minimal.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n\n          However, let me check the state at time14: we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do at time14.\n\n          However, the problem also says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we did avoid.\n\n          So we are done.\n\n          But wait: what about the starting state? We are at (0,4) at time9. Then we do U at time9: so at time9 we are on freeway4? Then we move to freeway5 at time10. And we checked freeway4 at time9 and freeway5 at time10, etc.\n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so we have t=0,1,2,3,4 for H=5, so:\n\n  a_{9+0} = a9 = U\n  a_{9+1} = a10 = U\n  a_{9+2} = a11 = U\n  a_{9+3} = a12 = U\n  a_{9+4} = a13 = U\n\nSo the output is as above.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car that we missed? For example, at time12 on freeway7: \n  The car: (24,1,right,24) at time12: \n      tail = 1 + 24*(12-9) = 1 + 24*3 = 73\n      head = 24 + 24*3 = 24+72=96\n      so [73,96] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at time13: [1+24*(13-9)=1+96=97, 24+24*4=24+96=120] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: freeway7 and 8 have the same car? The table says:\n\n  7 | (24,1,right,24) |\n  8 | (24,1,right,24) |\n\nSo they are separate freeways, each having one car.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 5 up moves.\n\nOutput:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) without colliding with any cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) consists of 5 consecutive \"U\" (up) actions.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 10, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The grid for y is from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at that turn) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway k such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and then moves to y+1 (or y-1) at the next turn. So at the turn when we move, we are still on the current freeway and only check the cars of that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are starting at turn 10 at (0,5). We have to output a sequence of actions starting at turn 10 (t=0 in our sequence index) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll plan a path from y=5 to y=9 (so we need to go up 4 steps) but we might have to wait or even go down to avoid collisions. Since we are minimizing turns, we want to go as fast as possible.\n\nThe cars are moving at constant speeds. We are given the state at turn t1=10.\n\nFor each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we know:\n  (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 10.\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving and right-moving is different.\n\nFor left-moving (if any) we have head and tail defined such that the span is [h, tau] and it moves by subtracting s*(T-t1) to both.\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\" for every car.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the span at turn 10 is [tau, h] (because the car goes from tail to head in the right direction). And at turn T (>=10), the span becomes:\n   [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T happens if the player is at (0, k) at turn T and for any car on freeway k, the span at turn T includes 0.\n\nThat is, for a right-moving car: \n   tau + s*(T-10) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-10)\n\nBut note: the representation in the input for a right-moving car is given as (h, tau, right, s). However, in the update for right-moving, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]. So the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the car extends from tau to h and then moves to the right.\n\nBut in the input, the first two numbers are head and tail? Actually, the input says: (head, tail, direction, speed). And for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h]? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \n  For car k on freeway i: \n    Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    Right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the input format: \n  Cars (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost end and the tail is the leftmost? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head]. So the input gives (head, tail) but then the span is [tail, head] for right? That would mean the head is greater than the tail? \n\nLooking at the example: \n  On freeway 1: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n  Then the span at t1=10 is [tail, head] = [-19, -8]. But that is a car from -19 to -8? Then at turn T, it becomes [-19 + 4*(T-10), -8 + 4*(T-10)].\n\nSimilarly, the next car on freeway1: (28,17,right,4) -> wait, 28 and 17? Then the span would be [17,28]? But that is consistent because 17<28. However, the first car: -19 and -8: -19<-8 so that is also [ -19, -8 ].\n\nBut the second car: (28,17,right,4) -> if we take [17,28] then that is a car from 17 to 28? But the input says head=28 and tail=17? So head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost. That makes sense.\n\nSo for a right-moving car: \n   tail = left end, head = right end, and the car moves to the right.\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car (which we don't have in this problem) the input would give head and tail, but then the span is [head, tail] and head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau]. And then moves left. But note: if the car is left-moving, then head should be the leftmost? But the input gives (head, tail) and then uses [h, tau]. So in that case, head would be the leftmost and tail the rightmost? But the problem doesn't specify the order of head and tail beyond the update rule.\n\nGiven that all cars in this state are right-moving, we'll focus on that.\n\nSo for each car, we have:\n   left_end = tail\n   right_end = head\n   and the car moves to the right at speed s.\n\nAt turn T (>=10), the car's span is:\n   [tail + s*(T-10), head + s*(T-10)]\n\nWe are at (0, y) at turn T. We collide on freeway k at turn T if y==k and there exists a car on freeway k such that:\n   tail + s*(T-10) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-10)\n\nWe are starting at turn 10 at y=5. We want to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without any cars would be 4 (if we go up every turn). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe'll simulate the cars over time and check for each freeway and each turn whether the freeway is safe at that turn.\n\nWe are going to plan a path from turn 10 (t=0 in our relative time) until we get to y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (state: (turn_relative, y)) but note that the absolute turn number matters for the car positions. Since we start at absolute turn 10, then at relative time t (from 0), the absolute turn is 10+t.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the relative time (starting at 0) and y is the current y-coordinate.\n\nWe start at (0,5). We want to reach any state where y=9 and we can stop at the first time we get to 9? But we might have to wait? Actually, we must output the minimal H such that we are at 9 at step H-1? \n\nLet me clarify: \n  We are at turn t1 (10) at time t=0 (relative) and we take action a_{t1} at that turn. Then at relative time t=1 (absolute turn 11), we have y1 = y0 + delta.\n\nWe want to minimize H, the total number of turns (which is the length of the sequence). So we take H actions and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at y_{t1+H}. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nActually, note: the sequence is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. So after H actions, we have done H steps and we are at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at the next turn (t1+H) we have the state after the last action. However, we require that at the last action we have reached (0,9). That is, after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So at relative time H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at relative time step H-1? Actually, note the indexing:\n\n  At relative time t (from 0 to H-1), we take an action at turn t1+t, and then we have the position at turn t1+t+1? \n\nBut the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at the moment we take action a_t (at turn t), we are at position y_t. Then at the next turn (t+1) we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, we start at turn t1 (10) at position (0,5). We take action a_10 and then at turn 11 we are at y_11 = y_10 + Delta(a_10).\n\nWe want that at some turn T, we are at (0,9). The turn T must be the turn after the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And we are to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action and then at turn t1+H we are at (0,9). But note the requirement: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" is not exactly what is written.\n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So at the turn when we take the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at position (0,9)? But that is not consistent with the update.\n\nActually, the state after the last action: \n  We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=5.\n  After action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta(a_{t1}).\n  Then after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That would be the state before the last action? Then we take the last action and then we are at y_{t1+H} which might be 10? But that is invalid.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then in the condition: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLooking back: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then the condition: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo the position at the turn when we take the last action (at turn t1+H-1) must be 9? But that doesn't make sense because we start at turn t1 at y=5, and we take an action at turn t1 and then we are at turn t1+1 at a new y. Then at turn t1+H-1 we take an action and then we are at turn t1+H at a new y. The position at the start of turn t1+H-1 is the state from the previous action? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is the position at that turn. Then we choose an action and then we update to the next turn.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1: we are at (0,5). Then we choose a_{t1} and then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}=5+Delta(a_{t1}).\n\nWe want that at the beginning of some turn T, we are at (0,9). The problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions). Then after H actions, we have advanced H turns? Actually, the state at turn t1+H is after H actions. But the problem requires that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take the action a_{t1+H-1} and then we move to turn t1+H at a new position. But that doesn't make sense because we want to be at 9 and then we might move away.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we don't take an action at turn t1+H? But the sequence ends at turn t1+H-1.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). So we have taken H actions and we are at the goal at the next state.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" is the condition? That would be at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 and then we move to a new y at turn t1+H. So we are not at 9 at the next turn? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nIt explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9. So at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. Then we take the action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta(a_{t1+H-1}). But that might not be 9? \n\nBut note: we are only required to have y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we take an action and then we leave 9. But the goal is to be at (0,9) at the moment we reach it? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". It doesn't say we have to stay there.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we have reached the goal. Then we take an action and move to 10? That's invalid. But wait, the grid is from 0 to 9, so we cannot go above 9. The update rule says: y_{t+1} is in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and we try to go up, we would stay at 9? \n\nActually, the update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then we clamp to [0,9]? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and we go up, we remain at 9.\n\nBut the problem does not say that we must stop at 9? It just says \"reach (0,9)\". So we can be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1 and then we take an action (which might be U, but then we stay at 9) and then at turn t1+H we are still at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is only that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So even if we then move away, we have already reached 9 at that turn.\n\nHowever, the minimal H might be achieved by being at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1? But note that the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at the start of turn t1+H-1 (when we are at 9) and then we update. But the problem does not require that we stay at 9. So that is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn. So when we are at 9, we are not on any freeway (because freeways are 1 to 8). So at y=9, there are no cars. Therefore, we are safe at y=9.\n\nSo we can stop as soon as we are at y=9 at the beginning of a turn. Then we take an action (any action) and then we are still at 9? But the problem says we must output a sequence until we have reached 9. Actually, the sequence must end at the turn when we are at 9? \n\nBut the condition: we must be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn. So the last action is taken at the turn when we are at 9? And that action might change the position? But if we are at 9 and we go up, we stay at 9. If we go down, we go to 8. If we stay, we stay. \n\nBut the problem does not require that we remain at 9. It only requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action and then we are at a new position. However, we are done because we have already been at 9.\n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9). We have reached it at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action and we might leave. But that is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. At the turn when we are at 9, we are not on any freeway (1 to 8) so we are safe. Then we take an action and then at the next turn we are at a new y. But we don't care about what happens after we have reached 9? Actually, we only care until we have taken the last action in the sequence? But the collision condition is only at the turn when we are on a freeway. So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we are safe. Then we take an action and then at turn t1+H we are at, say, 8 or 9. But we are not required to avoid collisions beyond the moment we have reached 9? \n\nThe problem: we must avoid collisions with cars during the entire sequence. The sequence of actions we take is from turn t1 to t1+H-1. So we are responsible for the turns from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nAt turn t (from t1 to t1+H-1), we are at a freeway y_t (if y_t is between 1 and 8) and we must check the cars on that freeway at turn t. \n\nWhen we are at y_t=9 at the beginning of turn t (which is one of the turns in the sequence, say t=t1+H-1), then at that turn we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1-8). So we don't check any car for collision at that turn? The problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can plan until the moment we are at 9 at the start of a turn.\n\nNow, we want to minimize H, the number of actions. Since we start at turn t1 (10) and we take H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and at the beginning of that turn we are at 9.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1, we are at 5. Then we take an action and then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at a new y. So we are at 9 at the beginning of some turn.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: \n  Turn t1: start at 5 -> take action a0 -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y1 = 5 + Delta(a0)\n  ...\n  At the beginning of turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{H-1} (the state at the beginning of that turn). Then we take action a_{H-1} and then at turn t1+H we are at y_H.\n\nWe require: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. How many actions have we taken? \n  We have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to t=H-1 (H actions). \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t1 is y0=5.\nAfter 0 actions, we are at turn t1 and we are at 5. Then we take an action (the first action) at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at y1.\n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t1+1 is y1.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take the H-th action? But wait, we have taken H-1 actions to get from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me index the turns and actions:\n\n  Turn 10 (t1): state0 = 5 -> take action0 -> then state1 = 5 + Delta0 at turn 11.\n  Turn 11: state1 -> take action1 -> state2 at turn 12.\n  ...\n  Turn 10 + (H-2): state_{H-2} -> take action_{H-2} -> state_{H-1} at turn 10+(H-1).\n  Then at the beginning of turn 10+(H-1) we are at state_{H-1} = 9.\n\nBut we have taken H-1 actions? Then the sequence would be of length H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: sequence {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions.\n\nAnd then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThe state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn. How did we get there? By taking H-1 actions: \n  actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence goes up to a_{t1+H-1}. That would be an action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo to have the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 be 9, we must have gotten there by the action taken at turn t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 and we take an action (a_{t1+H-1}) and then we move to state at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H must be at least 4 because we need to go up 4 steps. But we might take more if we have to avoid collisions.\n\nBut note: we might be able to go up in 4 actions? Then we would be at 9 at the beginning of turn 10+3 = 13? \n\nHow? \n  Start: turn10: y=5.\n  Action0 (at turn10): U -> at turn11: y=6.\n  Action1 (at turn11): U -> at turn12: y=7.\n  Action2 (at turn12): U -> at turn13: y=8.\n  Action3 (at turn13): U -> at turn14: y=9.\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So if we set H=4, then we require at the beginning of turn 10+4-1=13 we are at 9? \n\nBut at the beginning of turn13, we are at y=8 (from the action at turn12). Then we take action3 at turn13 and then at turn14 we are at 9. But we are not at 9 at the beginning of turn13.\n\nSo with 4 actions, we are at 9 at turn14. Then the beginning of turn14 is 9. Then we would set H=5: because we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 10+H-1. \n  We want 10+H-1 = 14 -> H=5.\n\nSo we must take 5 actions to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14? \n\nBut that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, we might be able to get to 9 faster? \n\nActually, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10: we are at 5, so no.\nAt turn11: we can be at 6 (if we go up at turn10) or 5 (stay) or 4 (down). Not 9.\n\nSo the minimal number of actions is 4 to go from 5 to 9, but we will be at 9 at the beginning of turn14. Then the state at the beginning of turn14 is 9. So we require that at the beginning of turn10+H-1=14, we are at 9. So 10+H-1=14 -> H=5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H without any obstacles is 5.\n\nBut we have obstacles. We need to check the freeways 5,6,7,8 because we will be moving through them.\n\nWe'll simulate the cars for freeways 1 to 8 for turns 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, ... until we have a path.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS in (time_relative, y) where time_relative is the number of steps taken (which is the same as the absolute turn - 10). \n\nState: (t, y) \n  t: relative time (number of actions taken so far, and also the absolute turn is 10+t for the action we are about to take? But note: at state (t,y), we are at the beginning of turn 10+t. Then we choose an action and then we go to state (t+1, y') at the beginning of turn 10+t+1.\n\nActually, the state (t,y) means: at the beginning of absolute turn (10+t) we are at y.\n\nWe start at (0,5) -> at the beginning of turn10.\n\nWe then choose an action (U, D, S) and then we get:\n   next state at (t+1, y + delta)  (clamped to [0,9])\n\nBut we must check: at the current state (t,y) we are about to take an action. But the collision condition is: at the beginning of turn T, if we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) then we check the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo at state (t,y), we are at absolute turn T = 10+t. We must check if y is between 1 and 8, then for every car on freeway y, we check if at turn T=10+t, the car's span includes 0.\n\nIf it does, then we cannot be at this state.\n\nWe start at (0,5): \n   T=10, y=5 -> freeway 5. \n   Check freeway 5 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: \n  (48, 37, right, 12) -> wait, this car: head=48, tail=37? Then the span at turn10: [37,48] -> does 0 in [37,48]? -> no.\n  (12, 1, right, 12) -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> no.\n  (-24, -35, right, 12) -> tail=-35, head=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 is not in there -> no.\n\nSo (0,5) is safe.\n\nThen we can choose an action: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to get to a state (t,9) for some t. Then we stop? But note: we must output the entire sequence until the last action that makes us be at 9 at the next state? Actually, we require that at the beginning of turn T we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn. So we must also take an action at state (t,9). \n\nBut when we are at state (t,9), we are safe (no freeway). Then we can take any action. However, the minimal H is the number of actions we take until we have the state (t,9) at the beginning of turn 10+t. Then the number of actions taken to get to that state is t? But we have taken t actions to get from turn10 to turn10+t. Then we are at state (t,9) at the beginning of turn10+t. Then we take one more action at turn10+t? That would be the (t+1)-th action. But then we would be at turn10+t+1. \n\nBut the requirement: we must be at 9 at turn10+H-1. \n\nAt state (t,9) we are at turn10+t. We want 10+t = 10+H-1 -> t = H-1.\n\nSo H-1 = t -> H = t+1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of actions H = t+1.\n\nWe are to minimize H, so we minimize t+1, i.e., we want the smallest t for which we can be at (t,9) (at the beginning of turn10+t) and we have a path to there.\n\nThen the sequence will be the actions from state (0,5) to state (t,9) and then we take an action at state (t,9) (which is the last action, the H-th action, and H=t+1).\n\nBut note: we must also avoid collisions at the state (t,9) when taking the action? Actually, at state (t,9) we are at turn10+t and we are at y=9 -> no collision. Then we take an action and then we update to state (t+1, y') but we don't care about state (t+1,y') because we have already been at 9 at the beginning of turn10+t, which is the goal.\n\nSo the BFS: we want to find the minimal t such that we can reach (t,9) from (0,5) without colliding at any state (i, y_i) for i from 0 to t-1? Actually, we must avoid collisions at every state we pass through until we get to (t,9). And note: at state (t,9) we are safe.\n\nBut we don't check collision at state (t,9) because we are at y=9? Actually, we do not check because y=9 is not a freeway. So we only check for states with y in [1,8].\n\nSo we do:\n\n  Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of actions taken to be at state (t,y) at the beginning of turn 10+t? Actually, we are doing BFS by t.\n\n  We start: \n      (t=0, y=5) -> safe (as above) -> dist[0][5]=0\n\n  Then we consider actions: \n      From (t,y) we can go to (t+1, y') where y' = min(9, max(0, y + delta))\n\n  But we must check the state (t,y) for collision? Actually, when we are at (t,y), we check if we are on a freeway (1<=y<=8) and if so, we check the cars on freeway y at absolute turn T=10+t.\n\n  However, note: we are at (t,y) at the beginning of turn 10+t. Then we take an action and then we move to (t+1, y'). But the collision check for the current state (t,y) must be done when we arrive at that state? \n\n  Actually, we check when we are at (t,y): that is, at the beginning of turn 10+t we are at y. We must check that we are not colliding at that moment.\n\n  So when we generate a state (t,y), we check if it is safe. If not, we discard it.\n\n  Then we expand to next states.\n\nWe are to minimize t (the time step) at which we first get to y=9? But note: we have to take one more action at that state? But the problem says we output the sequence until the action that is taken at the turn when we are at 9. So we do:\n\n  We want to find a path to (t,9) for some t, and then we output the actions for the first t steps? But note: to get to (t,9) we have taken t actions? \n\n  Actually, we start at (0,5) (0 actions taken). Then we take an action to get to (1,y1). Then to get to (t,9) we have taken t actions? \n\n  But we are at (t,9) at the beginning of turn10+t. We have taken t actions: at turns 10, 11, ... 10+t-1. \n\n  Then we need to take one more action at turn10+t? But that would be the (t+1)-th action. And then we would be at state (t+1, y_{t+1}) at turn10+t+1. \n\n  However, the problem requires that at the beginning of turn10+H-1 we are at 9. We are at (t,9) at turn10+t. So we require: 10+t = 10+H-1 -> t = H-1 -> H = t+1.\n\n  Then the sequence of actions is for turns from 10 to 10+t (which is H=t+1 actions). \n\n  But note: the action at turn10+t is taken at state (t,9). Then we output that action too. \n\n  Therefore, we do not stop when we reach (t,9). We stop when we have taken the action at state (t,9). But that state is safe (y=9) and then we take any action and then we are done. \n\n  However, we do not care about the next state? We only care that at the beginning of turn10+t we are at 9. Then we take an action and then we are done. \n\n  So the minimal H is t+1, where t is the minimal time step at which we can be at (t,9) (by taking t actions from the start) and then we take one more action at that state. But that last action doesn't change the fact that we were at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\n  But note: we can choose the last action arbitrarily? Since we are at 9, we can choose S (stay) and then we remain at 9 at the next state. \n\n  So we can simulate until we get to (t,9) and then we output the sequence of the t actions that got us there and then one more action (S) at the end? \n\n  But we want the minimal H. We are at (t,9) at the beginning of turn10+t. Then we take an action at turn10+t. Then we have taken t+1 actions. \n\n  The minimal t for which we can be at (t,9) is 4? (because we need to go from 5 to 9: 4 steps up). Then H=5.\n\n  But we must check if we can get to (4,9) without collision.\n\n  Alternatively, we might get to (t,9) for t>4 if we have to wait.\n\n  So we do BFS until we find the minimal t such that (t,9) is reached. Then H = t+1.\n\n  However, note: we can also get to 9 earlier if we go faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So minimal t is 4.\n\n  Now, we need to simulate the cars for freeways 5,6,7,8 for turns 10,11,12,13,14.\n\n  We are going to move from y=5 to y=9. The path we take: \n      turn10: at y=5 -> then we move to y=6 at turn11? Or we might stay or go down.\n\n  We want the minimal H, so we want to go as fast as possible. We'll try to go up as much as possible and check if it is safe.\n\n  We'll simulate the positions we would be at and check the freeway at that turn.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    Turn10 (absolute): at y=5 -> check freeway5 at turn10: safe (as above).\n\n    Then we take action U -> at turn11 we are at y=6.\n\n    Turn11: at y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn11.\n\n        Freeway6: only one car: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n        At turn11: T=11, so T-10=1 -> the car moves: \n            tail = -44 + 3*1 = -41\n            head = -33 + 3*1 = -30\n            span = [-41, -30] -> 0 is not in there -> safe.\n\n    Then we take U -> turn12: y=7.\n\n    Turn12: at y=7 -> freeway7 at turn12: \n        Car: (48,25,right,24) -> at turn12: T-10=2\n        tail=25+24*2=25+48=73\n        head=48+24*2=48+48=96\n        span=[73,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n    Then we take U -> turn13: y=8.\n\n    Turn13: at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn13: \n        Car: (48,25,right,24) -> same as freeway7? \n        Actually, freeway8: same car? \n            tail=25+24*3=25+72=97\n            head=48+24*3=48+72=120\n            safe.\n\n    Then we take U -> turn14: y=9.\n\n    Then at the beginning of turn14, we are at y=9. \n\n    So we have taken 4 actions: U,U,U,U -> and we are at (4,9) at the beginning of turn14.\n\n    Then we must take one more action at turn14 (the 5th action) to satisfy that we are at 9 at turn10+H-1=10+5-1=14. \n\n    At turn14: we are at y=9 -> safe. We can take any action. Let's take S (stay) so we remain at 9.\n\n    Therefore, the sequence: \n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n        Turn12: U\n        Turn13: U\n        Turn14: S\n\n    But wait: the last action is at turn14. Then the state at the beginning of turn14 is 9, and then we take S and then at turn15 we are still at 9. But we only require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14.\n\n    However, the problem requires that we output the sequence of actions until turn10+H-1. Since H=5, we output actions for turns 10 to 14.\n\n    But note: the state at the beginning of turn14 is 9, which is what we want.\n\n    So is this safe? We only had to check the freeways at the states we were at:\n\n        Turn10: y=5 -> safe\n        Turn11: y=6 -> safe\n        Turn12: y=7 -> safe\n        Turn13: y=8 -> safe\n        Turn14: y=9 -> safe (no freeway)\n\n    So it seems we can do H=5.\n\n    But let me check if there are any cars on freeway5 at turn10: we did, safe.\n    freeway6 at turn11: safe.\n    freeway7 at turn12: safe.\n    freeway8 at turn13: safe.\n\n    However, note: we didn't check freeway5 at turn11? But we were not on freeway5 at turn11. We were on freeway6 at turn11.\n\n    So we only check the freeway corresponding to the current y at the current turn.\n\n    Therefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\n    But wait: what about the car on freeway5 at turn11? \n        Freeway5 at turn11: \n            Cars: \n                (48,37,right,12): at turn11: T-10=1 -> [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe.\n                (12,1,right,12): [1+12=13, 12+12=24] -> safe.\n                (-24,-35,right,12): [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        But we are not on freeway5 at turn11, so we don't care.\n\n    Similarly, we only care about the freeway we are on.\n\n    Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n        Turn12: U\n        Turn13: U\n        Turn14: S   (or U or D? But if we go U at turn14 we stay at 9, if we go D we go to 8. But we are allowed to do so. But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn14, so we have reached. We can choose S to be safe.)\n\n    However, the problem does not specify what to do after reaching. We only need to output the sequence until we have taken the last action that makes us have been at 9 at the beginning of that turn? \n\n    But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn14, then we take an action at turn14. That action is the last in the sequence. We can choose S to avoid going down.\n\n    So we choose S.\n\n    But note: we might be able to stop earlier? \n\n    We are at 9 at the beginning of turn14. Then we take an action at turn14. But we don't need to take that action? The problem says: minimal number of turns H. We are at 9 at turn14, which is the beginning of turn14. Then if we don't take an action at turn14, we are done? \n\n    But the sequence must include actions until turn10+H-1. We require that at turn10+H-1 we are at 9. So turn10+H-1=14 -> H=5. So we must output 5 actions.\n\n    Therefore, we must output 5 actions.\n\n    Alternatively, can we get to 9 earlier? \n\n    At turn10: we are at 5 -> we cannot be at 9 at the beginning of turn10.\n    At turn11: we must be at 6,7,8,9? But we can only move one step: so maximum 6 at turn11.\n    At turn12: maximum 7.\n    At turn13: maximum 8.\n    At turn14: maximum 9.\n\n    So we cannot be at 9 before turn14.\n\n    Therefore, minimal H=5.\n\n    But let me check if the path is safe? \n\n        Turn10: y=5 -> freeway5: \n            car1: [37,48] -> no 0 -> safe.\n            car2: [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n            car3: [-35,-24] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        Turn11: y=6 -> freeway6: \n            car: [-44+3*(11-10) = -41, -33+3= -30] -> [-41,-30] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        Turn12: y=7 -> freeway7:\n            car: [25+24*(12-10)=25+48=73, 48+48=96] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        Turn13: y=8 -> freeway8:\n            car: [25+24*(13-10)=25+72=97, 48+72=120] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        Turn14: y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\n    So the path is safe.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n        Turn12: U\n        Turn13: U\n        Turn14: S\n\nBut note: the problem says to output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\n    Turn10: U\n    Turn11: U\n    Turn12: U\n    Turn13: U\n    Turn14: S\n\nBut wait, the last turn index is 14, which is t1+4. Since t1=10, then we have turns 10 to 14 -> 5 turns.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to 4 (H=5 actions).\n\nSo we output:\n\n    Turn10: U\n    Turn11: U\n    Turn12: U\n    Turn13: U\n    Turn14: S\n\nBut is there a shorter H? We argued no.\n\nHowever, what if we go faster by going up twice in one turn? We cannot, because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nTherefore, we output this sequence.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway6? The car on freeway6: (-33,-44,right,3) at turn10: \n    [ -44, -33] -> does not cover 0.\n    turn11: [-41,-30] -> no.\n    turn12: [-44+3*2=-38, -33+6=-27] -> still not.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway6 for two turns? We might have encountered a car? But we are not staying.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: freeway5 at turn10 is safe, but what about if we had stayed at freeway5 for turn11? \n    At turn11: freeway5: \n        car1: [37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe.\n        car2: [1+12=13,12+12=24] -> safe.\n        car3: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n\n    So even if we had stayed, it would be safe. But we don't need to.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=5.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\n    Turn 10: U\n    Turn 11: U\n    Turn 12: U\n    Turn 13: U\n    Turn 14: S\n\nHowever, we might be able to use D or S in the middle to avoid a collision? But we didn't encounter any collision.\n\nBut what if there was a collision? For example, if at turn12 on freeway7 there was a car covering 0? Then we would have to wait.\n\nBut in our case, it's clear.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway8 at turn13: \n    The car: (48,25,right,24) at turn10: [25,48] -> at turn13: T-10=3 -> [25+24*3=25+72=97, 48+72=120] -> indeed safe.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nHowever, note that the problem has multiple cars on some freeways. We checked the cars on the freeway at the required turn.\n\nBut freeway1 to freeway4: we don't care because we never go there? We are going from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 and the sequence is U,U,U,U,S.\n\nWe can also choose U for the last action? Because at y=9, going up stays at 9. But the problem does not specify. However, if we go down, we go to 8 and then we are not at 9 at the next state? But we are only required to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14. Then we take an action and go to 8? That would be after we have been at 9. So it is acceptable. But the problem does not require to remain at 9. However, it is cleaner to stay. \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". We have reached. Then we can do anything. But to be safe, we choose S.\n\nSo we output S for the last action.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 10 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The minimal \\(H\\) is 5, achieved by moving up four times and then staying.\n\n### Path Simulation:\n- **Turn 10 (current turn)**: Player is at (0, 5).  \n  - Action: \\(U\\) (move up).  \n  - New position: (0, 6) at turn 11.  \n  - Collision check on freeway 5 at turn 10:  \n    - Cars: (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12).  \n    - Spans at turn 10: [37, 48], [1, 12], [-35, -24].

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 11, and the player is at (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The player updates at the same time as the cars. The collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T (which is the same as the player's y-coordinate at that turn) such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. So at turn T, the player chooses an action (U, D, S) and then the position at T+1 is updated. However, the collision check at turn T is based on the car positions at turn T and the player's position at turn T.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still at y (and hence checks for collision on freeway y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, the player is at y' and will check for collision on freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn 11 at position (0,6). We must avoid collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) to reach y=9.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions from turn 11 to turn 11+H-1 such that at turn 11+H-1, y=9.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search. The state is (time, y). The time is the turn number. Since the cars move deterministically and we are given their state at t1=11, we can compute the car positions at any future turn.\n\nHowever, note that the problem only gives the car state at t1=11. We are to compute for turns starting at t1=11 and beyond.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn 11 to turn 11+H-1 (so H actions, and the last action leads to y=9 at turn 11+H-1? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning:\n\nAt turn t1 (which is 11) we take the first action a_{11}. Then at turn 12 we take a_{12}, ... until turn t1+H-1 (which is 11+H-1) we take the last action. Then the next state (at turn 11+H) would be the result of that last action. But the problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So:\n\nAt the beginning of turn 11, we are at y=6. Then we choose an action for turn 11. Then we move to the next state at turn 12 (if H>1) and so on.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\nt=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{11}\nt=1: a_{12}\n...\nt=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{11+H-1}\n\nAnd after these H actions, we have the position at turn t1+H (which is 11+H) is the result of the last action. But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nWait, let me clarify: the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? But note that we take an action at every turn including turn t1+H-1. So:\n\n- At turn t1 (11): we start at (0,6). We take action a11 -> then at turn 12 we are at y12 = y11 + Delta(a11)\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1 (11+H-1): we are at y_{11+H-1}. We take action a_{11+H-1}. Then we become y_{11+H} = y_{11+H-1} + Delta(a_{11+H-1})\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (which is the time when we are about to take the action) we are at (0,9). So we must have y_{11+H-1} = 9.\n\nTherefore, we do not require an action after that? Actually, we take H actions, and the last action is taken at turn 11+H-1, and at that same turn (before the action) we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions will be from turn 11 to turn 11+H-1 (H actions) and at the beginning of turn 11+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid collisions at every turn from 11 to 11+H-1.\n\nHow to compute the car positions at any future turn?\n\nGiven a car at turn t1 (11) with (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for a car at turn T (>= t1) is:\n\nIf left-moving: then at turn T, the car's span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note the example: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut wait, the example says for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, in the table, the cars are all right-moving? \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nAll cars have direction \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nFor right-moving cars: \n  At turn t1: span is [tau, head]? Actually, the table says: for freeway 1: (-4,-15,right,4) -> so head=-4, tail=-15? But then the span is [tail, head]? \n\nThe update rule for right-moving: \n  \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo the initial span at t1=11 for a car is [tau, h]. For example, on freeway 1: \n  Car1: tau=-15, h=-4 -> so the car occupies from -15 to -4 (inclusive?) at t1=11.\n\nThen at a future turn T, the car will be at [tau + s*(T-11), h + s*(T-11)] = [-15+4*(T-11), -4+4*(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we check if on freeway k = y_T, there is any car such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: the span is a continuous interval. So 0 is in [A, B] if A<=0<=B.\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving cars: [tau, h] and for left-moving [h, tau]? Actually, the update rule for left-moving uses [h, tau] and then subtracts, meaning it moves left. For right-moving, we have [tau, h] and then we add, meaning it moves right.\n\nIn the given data, all cars are right-moving. So for a car on freeway k at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-11), h + s*(T-11)] and we require that 0 is in this interval.\n\nSo for a car (tau, h, d, s) (with d='right') at turn T, the condition for collision is:\n  tau + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-11)\n\nBut note: is the interval [tau, h] or [h, tau]? The update rule says for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau+s*(T-11), h+s*(T-11)]. So the interval is [min(tau, h), max(tau, h)]? \n\nWait, the example: (-4, -15, right, 4) at t1=11: \n  The head is -4 and tail is -15. But the update rule says: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> so [ -15, -4 ]? That is from -15 to -4. Then at T, it becomes [-15+4*(T-11), -4+4*(T-11)].\n\nBut note: the head is the front of the car? In right-moving, the head should be the rightmost? Then the tail is the leftmost. So the car covers [tail, head] = [-15, -4] at t1=11.\n\nSo the condition for 0 being in the span at turn T is:\n   tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)\n\nBut note: tail might be less than head? In this example, tail=-15, head=-4, so tail < head. Then the interval is [tail, head]. So the condition is:\n   tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)\n\nBut what if the car is defined with head and tail swapped? The table has (head, tail) for each car? \n\nLooking at the table: \n  Freeway 1: (-4, -15, right, 4) -> so head=-4, tail=-15? Then the car is from -15 to -4? \n\nYes, because the head is the front and tail is the back. For a right-moving car, the front is at -4 and the back at -15? Then the entire car is from -15 to -4? \n\nBut that would mean the car is 12 units long? (from -15 to -4 inclusive?).\n\nSo condition: at turn T, the car on freeway k will cause a collision if the player is on freeway k at turn T and \n   tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)\n\nBut note: the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? Then the condition is:\n   tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)\n\nBut wait, if the car is moving right, then at T>11, the entire car shifts right by s*(T-11). So the condition is as above.\n\nWe are at turn 11. We are at y=6. We need to get to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay. The grid has y in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Note that at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? Because the cars are on freeways 1 to 8. So if the player is at y=0 or y=9, there is no collision? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so safe.\n\nHowever, we start at y=6 (which is freeway 6) and we must get to y=9. We can go through y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turn 11, 12, ... until the turn at which we are at y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nWe can try to simulate with minimal moves: since we are at 6 and need to get to 9, we need at least 3 upward moves. But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nWe must check at each turn and at each freeway we are on, whether there is a car that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=11) the set of cars that would have 0 in their span at turn T.\n\nBut note: at a given turn T, if the player is at freeway k, then we check all cars on freeway k (at that turn) for collision.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  car1: tail=-15, head=-4, s=4\n  car2: tail=21, head=32, s=4   -> wait, the table says (32,21,right,4) -> so head=32, tail=21? Then the car is from 21 to 32? Then at T, it will be [21+4*(T-11), 32+4*(T-11)]\n  car3: tail=-55, head=-44, s=4 -> so from -55 to -44.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  car1: (-4,-15,right,4) -> tail=-15, head=-4? \n  car2: (32,21,right,4) -> tail=21, head=32\n  car3: (-44,-55,right,4) -> tail=-55, head=-44\n\nFreeway 3: \n  car1: (0,-11,right,6) -> tail=-11, head=0? Then at T=11: the car is at [-11,0]. So at T=11, 0 is in the span? \n  car2: (-36,-47,right,6) -> tail=-47, head=-36\n  car3: (42,31,right,6) -> tail=31, head=42\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: \n  car1: (60,49,right,12) -> tail=49, head=60 -> at T=11: [49,60] -> 0 not in\n  car2: (24,13,right,12) -> tail=13, head=24\n  car3: (-12,-23,right,12) -> tail=-23, head=-12\n\nFreeway 6: \n  car1: (-30,-41,right,3) -> tail=-41, head=-30\n\nFreeway 7: \n  car1: (72,49,right,24) -> tail=49, head=72\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (72,49,right,24)\n\nNow, we are at turn 11 at y=6. So we are on freeway 6. We must check freeway 6 at turn 11: \n   freeway6: one car: tail=-41, head=-30, s=3 -> at T=11: [-41, -30] -> 0 is not in [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 11 and we are at y=6. We are about to take an action. Then we will update to the next state.\n\nWe are required to avoid collision at turn 11: so we must check the freeway we are on at turn 11 (which is 6) and we just did: no collision.\n\nThen we take an action. Let's denote the actions we take at each turn.\n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible. The minimal moves would be 3 ups: U, U, U. But we must check the freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nWe start at turn 11: y=6 (safe).\n\nPlan 1: \n  Turn11: U -> then at turn12: y=7\n  Turn12: U -> then at turn13: y=8\n  Turn13: U -> then at turn14: y=9 -> but we require that at turn13 we are at 9? No, at turn14 we are at 9. But we require at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So if H=3, then we are at turn11+3-1 = turn13? Then at turn13 we must be at 9. But with 3 ups, at turn13 we are at 9? \n\nLet's see:\n  Turn11: at y=6 -> action U -> then at turn12: y=7\n  Turn12: at y=7 -> action U -> then at turn13: y=8\n  Turn13: at y=8 -> action U -> then at turn14: y=9\n\nSo at turn13 we are at 8, not 9. Therefore, we would need one more step: \n  Turn13: at y=8 -> action U -> then at turn14: y=9 -> so at turn14 we are at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 we are at 9. So we require 11+H-1 = 14 -> H=4.\n\nBut then the sequence would be for turns 11,12,13: three actions? But we need H=4 actions? The problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. So:\n\n  Turn11: a11 (first action)\n  Turn12: a12\n  Turn13: a13\n  Turn14: a14? -> but then at turn14 we are at y=9, but we are required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1. If H=4, then 11+4-1=14 -> so at turn14 we must be at 9? But note: at turn14 we take an action? and then we move to turn15? But the problem only requires that at turn14 we are at 9? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn14 is y=9 (if we did U at turn13). Then we take an action at turn14? But the problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 14) we are at 9. Then we can output the sequence for turns 11,12,13? But the sequence must have H actions. So if we do 3 actions (U at 11, U at 12, U at 13) then H=3, and we require at turn 11+3-1=13 we are at 9? But at turn13 we are at 8? So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  Turn11: U -> y12=7\n  Turn12: U -> y13=8\n  Turn13: U -> y14=9\n\nThen at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9. But we haven't taken an action at turn14? The problem says: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So if H=3, then we take actions at 11,12,13. Then at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 (which is 13) we are at 9? No, at turn13 we are at 8. \n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Therefore, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn13? \n\nHow? We start at turn11 at 6. Then:\n  At turn11: we take an action -> then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 6+Delta(a11)\n  At turn12: we take an action -> then at the beginning of turn13 we are at y12+Delta(a12)\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn13 we are at 9. So:\n\n  y13 = y12 + Delta(a12) = 9\n  y12 = y11 + Delta(a11) = 6 + Delta(a11)\n\nSo we need 6 + Delta(a11) + Delta(a12) = 9.\n\nThe minimal actions: two U's and one S? or three U's? But two U's: 6+1+1=8 -> then we need one more U to get to 9 at turn13? But then we would need three actions: \n  a11: U -> y12=7\n  a12: U -> y13=8\n  a13: U -> then at turn14: y14=9 -> but we are at turn13 at y=8, not 9.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n  a11: U -> y12=7\n  a12: U -> y13=8\n  a13: U -> then at turn14 we are at 9 -> but then we are at 9 at turn14, so we require H such that 11+H-1=14 -> H=4.\n\nBut we can do:\n  a11: U -> y12=7\n  a12: U -> y13=8\n  a13: S -> then at turn14: y14=8 -> not 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn13 (the beginning of turn13) we must have:\n\n  y11 = 6\n  y12 = 6 + d0\n  y13 = 6 + d0 + d1 = 9\n\nSo we need d0+d1=3. The actions: \n  Possibilities: \n    Two U's: 1+1=2 -> not enough.\n    Three actions: but then we would be at turn14? \n\nWait, if we do three actions, then we are at turn14? \n\nThe problem: we take H actions at turns 11, 12, ..., 11+H-1. Then at the beginning of turn 11+H-1, we are at a state. We require that state to be (0,9).\n\nSo we require the position at the beginning of turn 11+H-1 to be 9.\n\nAt the beginning of turn11, we are at 6.\n\nAfter one action (at turn11), at the beginning of turn12, we are at 6 + d0.\n\nAfter two actions (at turn11 and turn12), at the beginning of turn13, we are at 6 + d0 + d1.\n\nAfter three actions (at turn11,12,13), at the beginning of turn14, we are at 6 + d0 + d1 + d2.\n\nWe require: 6 + (d0 + d1 + ... + d_{H-1}) = 9.\n\nThe minimal number of actions is when the sum of the deltas is 3, and we use as few actions as possible. The maximal delta per action is +1. So we need at least 3 actions? Then H=3, and we require:\n\n  6 + (d0+d1+d2) = 9 -> d0+d1+d2=3 -> three U's.\n\nThen the state at the beginning of turn14 would be 9. But we require that at the beginning of turn11+H-1 = 11+3-1 = 13 we are at 9? \n\nNo: at the beginning of turn13 we have only taken two actions: \n  At turn11: action -> then at turn12 we are at 6+d0.\n  At turn12: action -> then at turn13 we are at 6+d0+d1.\n\nBut we haven't taken the third action yet? Then at the beginning of turn13, we are at 6+d0+d1, which must be 9? But then we don't need the third action? \n\nI think I have a confusion in the timing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n  and we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nWhat is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, and then we update to y_{T+1}=y_T+Delta(a_T).\n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T. Then we take a_T. Then we become y_{T+1} at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We require that to be 9.\n\nHow do we get to y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nWe start at y_{t1}=6 at the beginning of turn t1.\n\nThen we take H-1 actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1} (t=0), a_{t1+1} (t=1), ..., a_{t1+H-1} (t=H-1) -> that's H actions.\n\nBut then the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is the result of the last action? \n\nThe problem says: we take an action at turn t1+H-1. Then the next state is at turn t1+H. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 (the beginning) to be 9. \n\nSo we don't care about the state after the last action? \n\nBut note: the action taken at turn t1+H-1 will change the state to turn t1+H, but the requirement is only at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken while we are at 9? And then we move to 10? But we cannot go above 9. \n\nThe problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t) and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and we take U, then we stay at 9? Because the update is clamped? \n\nThe problem says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then adds \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, we remain at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. The action we take at that turn doesn't change that we were at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo we can take an action at turn t1+H-1 even if we are at 9? And then we might stay at 9 or go down? But that doesn't matter because the requirement is only at the beginning of the turn.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collision at every turn we are on a freeway. At turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so safe.\n\nSo the minimal H: we require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. How many actions do we take to get to 9? \n\nWe start at 6 at the beginning of turn11.\n\nWe take actions at turn11, turn12, ... until turn11+H-2 to get to 9 at the beginning of turn11+H-1? \n\nLet me denote:\n  Let T0 = 11: at beginning, y=6.\n  After action at T0: at beginning of T1=12, y = 6 + d0.\n  After action at T1: at beginning of T2=13, y = 6 + d0 + d1.\n  ...\n  After action at T_{k-1}: at beginning of T_k = 11+k, y = 6 + d0+...+d_{k-1}.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn T = 11+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo the turn index at which we are at 9 is T = 11+H-1.\n\nThe number of actions taken to get to that state is the number of actions taken from turn11 to turn 11+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from turn11 to turn11+H-1: H actions.\n\nHowever, the state at the beginning of turn11+H-1 is determined by the first H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: we take H actions. And we require the state at the beginning of the turn at which we take the last action to be 9.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn11+H-1. At the beginning of that turn, we are at 9.\n\nHow did we get to 9? \n\nWe took actions at turns 11, 12, ..., 11+H-2 to get to 9 at the beginning of turn11+H-1.\n\nThe actions at turns 11 to 11+H-2: H-1 actions.\n\nThen at turn11+H-1, we are at 9, and we take an action (the H-th action) and then move to the next state.\n\nSo the minimal number of actions to get to 9 is 3 (three U's). Then we would be at 9 at the beginning of turn14? \n\nHow:\n  Turn11: U -> at turn12: 7\n  Turn12: U -> at turn13: 8\n  Turn13: U -> at turn14: 9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn14 (which is the third action? But then H would be 4? \n\nBut the actions are:\n  a11 (first action) at turn11: U\n  a12 (second) at turn12: U\n  a13 (third) at turn13: U\n  then at turn14: we are at 9.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn11+H-1 we are at 9. So 11+H-1 = 14 -> H=4.\n\nSo the sequence has 4 actions: \n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: ? -> but we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn14. We must take an action at turn14? And then we move to y14 + Delta(a14). But we are at 9, so if we take U, we stay at 9. \n\nBut note: the requirement is only to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14. Then we can take any action at turn14? However, we must avoid collision at turn14: but at turn14 we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  H=4: \n    turn11: U\n    turn12: U\n    turn13: U\n    turn14: S (or U or D, but D would go to 8, which is not desired but the requirement is only at the beginning of turn14 to be at 9)\n\nBut the requirement is only for the beginning of turn14 to be at 9. The action at turn14 can be anything.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collision at every turn from 11 to 14. At turn14 we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut we must check the intermediate freeways.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\n  Turn11: at y=6 -> check freeway6: \n        car: (-41, -30, right, 3) -> at T=11: [ -41+3*(0), -30+3*(0) ] = [-41,-30] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Then we take U -> to y=7.\n\n  Turn12: at y=7 -> freeway7: \n        car: (49,72,right,24) -> at T=12: [49+24*(1), 72+24*(1)] = [73, 96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Then take U -> to y=8.\n\n  Turn13: at y=8 -> freeway8: \n        car: (49,72,right,24) -> at T=13: [49+24*2, 72+24*2] = [49+48, 72+48] = [97,120] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Then take U -> to y=9.\n\n  Turn14: at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo this works. So minimal H is 4? But is there a way with H=3?\n\nWith H=3, we require that at the beginning of turn11+3-1 = turn13 we are at 9.\n\nHow to be at 9 at the beginning of turn13?\n\nWe start at turn11: y=6.\n  After turn11: action a11 -> then at turn12: 6+ d0.\n  After turn12: action a12 -> then at turn13: 6+ d0+d1 = 9.\n\nSo we need d0+d1=3. The only way is to do two U's and one action that gives +1? But we only have U (+1), D (-1), S (0). So we need two U's and one more +1? But we can only do one action per turn. \n\nAlternatively, we might try to use more than two actions? But for H=3, we have two actions (at turn11 and turn12) to get from 6 to 9? \n\nWe need to gain 3 in two actions. The maximum gain per action is +1. So we can only gain 2. Then we cannot get to 9 in two actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 4.\n\nBut wait, what if we use a different route? For example, go down then up? But that would take more actions. So 4 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision on the proposed route: we saw that it is safe.\n\nBut what about other freeways? We are only on freeways 6,7,8 at turns 11,12,13 respectively.\n\nBut what if there is a car on freeway6 at turn12? We are not on freeway6 at turn12, we are on freeway7. So we only check the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway7 at turn12: \n  freeway7: car (49,72,right,24) at T=12: \n      span = [49+24*(12-11), 72+24*(12-11)] = [49+24, 72+24] = [73,96] -> 0 not in.\n\nFreeway8 at turn13: \n  freeway8: car (49,72,right,24) at T=13:\n      [49+24*(13-11), 72+24*(13-11)] = [49+48, 72+48] = [97,120] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut what about freeway6 at turn11: already checked.\n\nHowever, note: at turn11, we are on freeway6: \n  freeway6: only one car: (-30,-41,right,3) -> wait, the table says: (-30,-41)? But the representation is (head, tail). So head=-30, tail=-41? Then the car is from -41 to -30. At T=11: [-41, -30] -> safe.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car that might appear at 0 at any of the turns we are on the freeway.\n\nHowever, we might consider if we can do it in 4 turns but with a different sequence? But we did three U's and then a fourth action (S, U, or D). \n\nBut the fourth action doesn't matter for the requirement. We can choose S.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=4.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4 that avoids collision? We have one above.\n\nBut let me check if there is a car that we haven't noticed. For example, at freeway6 at turn11: we have one car. But what about at turn12? We are not on freeway6 at turn12, so no need.\n\nBut what if we try to stay at some freeway to avoid a future collision? But we want minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go up faster? But we cannot.\n\nBut wait, what if we go up twice and then we are at 8 at turn13, and then we can be at 9 at turn14. That's what we did.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14 (if H=4). \n\nBut the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". And we have a sequence for H=4.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4 that is blocked? Let me check if at any of the turns there is a collision.\n\nTurn11: y=6 -> freeway6: \n   car: (-41,-30,right,3) -> at T=11: [-41,-30] -> 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn12: y=7 -> freeway7: \n   car: (49,72,right,24) -> at T=12: [49+24, 72+24] = [73,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn13: y=8 -> freeway8: \n   car: (49,72,right,24) -> at T=13: [49+24*2, 72+24*2] = [97,120] -> safe.\n\nTurn14: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut what about freeway5? We never go to freeway5. So we don't care.\n\nBut note: what if we go down? That would be longer.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have a sequence.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 3 turns? We argued we cannot. So H=4.\n\nBut wait, what if we do:\n\n  Turn11: U -> y12=7\n  Turn12: U -> y13=8\n  Turn13: U -> then at turn14: y14=9.\n\nBut then at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9. So to have that as the state at turn11+H-1, we set H=4 and then the last action is at turn14? But then we require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn14. So we are. Then we take an action at turn14.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have four actions: \n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: U\n  Turn14: ?\n\nBut at turn14, we are at 9, and then we take an action. We can choose S (stay).\n\nBut the problem requires the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, which is 4 actions.\n\nBut what if we do not take an action at turn14? The problem says we must output a sequence of H actions. So we must have four actions.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S   (or U or D, but S is safe and doesn't move)\n\nBut note: at turn14, we are at y=9. If we take U, we stay at 9. If we take D, we go to 8. But the requirement is only at the beginning of turn14 to be at 9. The action at turn14 can be anything. But to be safe, we can choose S.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut wait, is there any car that we are missing? \n\nLet me check freeway6 at turn11: safe.\n\nBut what about the other cars? For example, freeway3 at turn11 has a car (0,-11,right,6): \n   at turn11: [-11,0] -> so 0 is included? \n   But we are not on freeway3 at turn11, we are on freeway6. So no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 is the same.\n\nBut note: freeway3 and 4 have a car that at turn11 is at [ -11, 0] and [31,42] and [-47,-36] for freeway3. The car (0,-11,right,6) at turn11: \n   head=0, tail=-11 -> so the car covers from -11 to 0. So if we were on freeway3 at turn11, we would collide. But we are on freeway6.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4, and the sequence is U, U, U, S.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=4.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it without the last action? But we must output H actions. And the requirement is that at the beginning of the last turn of the sequence (turn14) we are at 9. We are.\n\nBut what if we can be at 9 earlier? We cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to get to 9 in three actions by a different route? But we cannot gain 3 in two actions.\n\nOr, we might use a down action to avoid a car? But in this route, we don't encounter any car. So it's safe.\n\nBut let me check if there is any car on freeway7 or freeway8 at the turns we are there? We did: at turn12, freeway7: [73,96] -> safe. At turn13, freeway8: [97,120] -> safe.\n\nBut what if there is a car on freeway7 that we haven't considered? The table says freeway7 has one car: (72,49,right,24). But wait, the representation is (head, tail). So head=72, tail=49? Then the car is from 49 to 72. At T=12: 49+24*(12-11)=73, 72+24=96 -> [73,96] -> 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway8.\n\nBut note: freeway6 has only one car, but what about the other cars? The table shows multiple cars per freeway. For freeway1,2,3,4,5 we have multiple cars. But we are not on those freeways at the turns we are traveling.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at any time? We are not on it.\n\nOne more: freeway4 at turn11: \n   cars: \n      (0,-11,right,6) -> at turn11: [-11,0] -> 0 is in! \n      (-36,-47,right,6) -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in\n      (42,31,right,6) -> [31,42] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo if we were on freeway4 at turn11, we would collide. But we are not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 is the same.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway4? We don't.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is safe.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are only checking the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut the minimal H is 4. \n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 4 turns but with a different sequence? For example, if we do:\n\n  Turn11: U -> to 7\n  Turn12: S -> stay at 7\n  Turn13: U -> to 8\n  Turn14: U -> to 9\n\nThen at the beginning of turn14, we are at 9. But this takes 4 turns and we are at 9 at turn14. But we were at 7 for two turns? We must check turn12 and turn13 at freeway7.\n\nTurn12: at freeway7: [49+24,72+24]=[73,96] -> safe.\nTurn13: at freeway7: [49+24*2,72+24*2]=[97,120] -> safe.\n\nSo it's also safe. But it's the same H=4, and we did an extra S. So it's not better.\n\nWe can also do:\n\n  Turn11: U ->7\n  Turn12: U ->8\n  Turn13: S ->8\n  Turn14: U ->9\n\nThen at turn14 we are at 9. And we check:\n  Turn13: at freeway8: [49+24*2,72+24*2]=[97,120] -> safe.\n\nBut again, H=4.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4, and the fastest is to go up as much as possible.\n\nSo the sequence we first proposed is the fastest.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collision at every step. In the first sequence, we are at freeway6 at turn11, freeway7 at turn12, freeway8 at turn13, and freeway9 (safe) at turn14.\n\nBut what if at turn12, freeway7 had a car at 0? Then we would have to avoid. But it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S   (we choose S for the last action)\n\nBut we could choose U again? But then we stay at 9. Or D? Then we go to 8, but then at the next turn (if there were) we would be at 8, but we don't care because the requirement is only for turn14.\n\nBut to be safe and not move, we choose S.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to be at 9 at turn14. So we can choose any action. S is fine.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=4, so t=0,1,2,3.\n\nSo:\n\n  t=0: turn11: U\n  t=1: turn12: U\n  t=2: turn13: U\n  t=3: turn14: S\n\nYes.\n\nBut the output format is:\n\nTurn 11: a_{11}\nTurn 12: a_{12}\nTurn 13: a_{13}\nTurn 14: a_{14}\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without the last action? The problem requires H actions. So we must output four.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows us to stop as soon as we reach 9, then we might not need the last action. But the problem says: we must output a sequence of H actions that gets us to 9 at turn t1+H-1. And we need to take the actions.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 4.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0. I must reach y=9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways, and I collide if at any turn T, I'm on a freeway y where there's a car whose span includes x=0 at that turn. The note says that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm on at the start of the turn.\n\nAt turn T, I'm at position (0, y_T). I choose an action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy. Then, for collision, at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and I check if any car on freeway y_T has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nThe player update says: at turn T, position is (0, y_T). After action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAnd the note clarifies: if I move to a different y at turn T, meaning y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}, so I don't check the new freeway until I'm on it.\n\nFor example, if at turn T I'm on y=7 and I move up to y=8, then at turn T, I'm on y=7, so I check cars on y=7 at time T. At turn T+1, I'm on y=8, so I check cars on y=8 at time T+1.\n\nNow, t_1 = 12, I start at y=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is two up, but I have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each future turn relative to t_1=12.\n\nThe car spans are given at t_1=12, and for future turns, they move based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the time from t_1: let τ = T - t_1, so τ=0 at turn t_1.\n\nThen for a car, at time τ, span changes based on direction and speed.\n\nFor left-moving: head decreases, tail decreases? The update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the update, it's [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], which makes sense for left-moving.\n\nIn the car state table, it shows (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nDirection is given, so for right-moving, it should be moving right, so head increases.\n\nLet me read the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the span, if it's [h, τ], and h is head, τ tail, for left-moving, head should be on the left or right? I think I need to interpret the span.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it says (0, -11, right, 4), and direction right, so it should be moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be moving left.\n\nBut in the update rule, for left-moving, it says span becomes [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], which decreases both, so if h and τ are positions, decreasing means moving left.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nThe notation is inconsistent.\n\nLook: for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h].\n\nThat's confusing.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for each car, head and tail are given, and direction.\n\nFor direction, if right, it's moving right, so both head and tail increase with time.\n\nIf left, both decrease.\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care about whether 0 is in [min(head,tail), max(head,tail)] or something? No, the span is an interval, and we need to know the order.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] which might imply τ < h, since it's [tail, head] or something.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom the text:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIf it's moving left, and span is [h, τ], with h and τ, if h > τ, then [h, τ] would be from higher to lower, but usually we write intervals with min first.\n\nI think there's a inconsistency in notation.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined such that for left-moving, head is the front, so for left-moving, head is on the left, tail on the right, so as it moves left, both positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head on the right, tail on the left, so both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so it should be moving right.\n\nAt t_1, span is given as (head, tail) = (0, -11)\n\nSince direction right, head is the front, so tail is at -11, head at 0, so the car is from x= -11 to x=0, with head at 0, tail at -11.\n\nThen for right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], where τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nAnd since for collision, we care if 0 is in the interval [min, max] of the span.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, car at (0, -11, right, 4), so at τ=0 (T=t_1), span is from tail -11 to head 0, so [ -11, 0 ].\n\nThen at time τ, span is [ -11 + 4τ, 0 + 4τ ] = [4τ -11, 4τ]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nLet me list all cars at τ=0:\n\nFreeway k | Cars (head, tail, dir, speed) | Span at τ=0\n\nSince dir determines the order.\n\nFor each car, the span at τ=0 is from min(head,tail) to max(head,tail), but with the direction, we can find the positions.\n\nBetter to compute the left and right endpoints.\n\nFor a car, at τ=0:\n\nIf direction right, tail position at τ=0, head position at τ=0, with tail < head since moving right.\n\nIn the example, (0, -11, right, 4), tail = -11, head = 0, so tail < head.\n\nSimilarly, if left-moving, head and tail with head > tail, but in the data, all directions are right in this case, I think.\n\nLet's see the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: all right, so for each car, tail < head at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: (0, -11, right, 4) so tail=-11, head=0, span [ -11, 0 ]\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 4) tail=25, head=36, span [25,36]\n\nThird: (-40, -51, right, 4) tail=-51, head=-40, span [-51,-40]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: (6, -5, right, 6) tail=-5, head=6, span [-5,6]\n\nSecond: (-30, -41, right, 6) tail=-41, head=-30, span [-41,-30]\n\nThird: (48, 37, right, 6) tail=37, head=48, span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 4 same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 12) tail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48]\n\nSecond: (36, 25, right, 12) tail=25, head=36, span [25,36]\n\nThird: (0, -11, right, 12) tail=-11, head=0, span [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (-27, -38, right, 3) tail=-38, head=-27, span [-38,-27]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -71, right, 24) tail=-71, head=-48, span [-71,-48]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, for collision at time T (which is turn number), for freeway y_T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute, but since we start from t_1=12, let τ = T - 12, so τ=0 at start.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time τ, the span is:\n\nIf direction right, span: [ tail + s * τ, head + s * τ ]\n\nIf direction left, but all are right here, so [ tail + s τ, head + s τ ]\n\nThen 0 is in span if tail + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + s τ\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSince tail and head are positions at τ=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=7 to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: I can go directly up to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nOr I might need to go down first if there are cars blocking, but since I start at y=7, and need to go up, and cars are only on y=1 to 8, y=9 is the goal, no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I start at y=7, which has freeway, and I need to reach (0,9), which is not on a freeway, so no collision there.\n\nBut during the path, I might be on freeways.\n\nNow, at turn T, I am at y_T, so for collision, I care about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nI start at t_1=12, y=7.\n\nI need to choose actions to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go up twice, at least 2 turns if I go U,U.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down if blocked.\n\nFirst, let's see freeway 7, since I start there.\n\nFreeway 7 has one car: (-48, -71, right, 24) at τ=0, span [-71,-48]\n\nAt time τ, span: [ -71 + 24τ, -48 + 24τ ]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ\n\nWhich is 24τ ≤ 71 and 24τ ≥ 48, so τ ≥ 48/24 = 2, and τ ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSo τ from 2 to 2.958, but τ integer, so at τ=2 and τ=3? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=2: -71 + 48 = -23, -48 + 48 = 0, so span [-23, 0], so 0 is included, since ≤0≤0.\n\nAt τ=3: -71 + 72 =1, -48 +72=24, span [1,24], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nτ=2: -71 + 24*2 = -71+48= -23, -48+48=0, so [ -23, 0], 0≤0 true, so yes.\n\nτ=1: -71+24= -47, -48+24= -24, span [-47,-24], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: -71+72=1, -48+72=24, [1,24], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=2, which is turn T=12+2=14, on freeway 7, the car has span including 0.\n\nBut at τ=0, T=12, span [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nNow, I am at y=7 at turn T=12 (τ=0).\n\nI need to move to y=8 or y=9 or stay.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nFirst, let's find when each freeway has a car at x=0.\n\nFor freeway k, at time τ, for each car, if 0 in span.\n\nSince multiple cars, but on each freeway, we have the cars listed.\n\nFor freeway 7, only one car, as above, 0 in span only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as 7, since same cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has same car: (-48, -71, right, 24), so same as freeway 7.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-27, -38, right, 3), span at τ=0: [-38,-27]\n\nAt τ, [ -38 + 3τ, -27 + 3τ ]\n\n0 in span if -38 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3τ\n\nSo 3τ ≤ 38 and 3τ ≥ 27, τ ≤ 38/3≈12.666, τ ≥ 9\n\nSo τ=9,10,11,12\n\nAt τ=9: -38+27= -11, -27+27=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=10: -38+30= -8, -27+30=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nτ=11: -38+33= -5, -27+33=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=12: -38+36= -2, -27+36=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nτ=13: -38+39=1, -27+39=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 has car at x=0 for τ=9 to 12.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12), tail=-59, head=-48, span [-59,-48] at τ=0\n\nAt τ, [ -59 +12τ, -48 +12τ ]\n\n0 in if -59+12τ ≤0≤ -48+12τ, so 12τ≤59, 12τ≥48, τ≥4, τ≤59/12≈4.916, so τ=4? At τ=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=4 only? τ≥4 and τ≤4.916, so only τ=4.\n\n12τ ≥48, τ≥4, 12τ≤59, τ≤4.916, so τ=4.\n\nSecond car: (36,25, right,12), span [25,36] at τ=0, at τ, [25+12τ, 36+12τ], all positive for τ≥0, since min 25>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (0,-11, right,12), tail=-11, head=0, span [-11,0] at τ=0\n\nAt τ, [ -11 +12τ, 0 +12τ ] = [12τ-11, 12τ]\n\n0 in if 12τ-11 ≤0 ≤12τ, which is always true for τ=0, and for τ>0, since 12τ-11 ≤0 when τ≤11/12<1, so only at τ=0: at τ=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nFor τ=0, 12*0 -11 = -11 ≤0, 0≤0, yes.\n\nAt τ=1, [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not ≤ min, so not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, at τ=0, third car has 0 in span, and at τ=4, first car has 0 in span.\n\nBut τ=0 is now, turn t_1=12.\n\nNow, I am at y=7, not on freeway 5, so for now, at τ=0, freeway 5 has collision, but I'm not there.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? Freeway 4 has same as freeway 3: (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (6,-5,right,6), tail=-5, head=6, span [-5,6] at τ=0\n\nAt τ, [ -5 +6τ, 6 +6τ ]\n\n0 in if -5+6τ ≤0≤6+6τ\n\nNow, 6+6τ >0 always for τ≥0, so only need -5+6τ ≤0, so 6τ≤5, τ≤5/6<1, so only possible at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6), tail=-41, head=-30, span [-41,-30] at τ=0, all negative, at τ, [ -41+6τ, -30+6τ ], min increases, but for 0 to be in, need -41+6τ ≤0≤ -30+6τ, so 6τ≤41, 6τ≥30, τ≥5, τ≤41/6≈6.833, so τ=5,6\n\nAt τ=5: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=6: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=7: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,6), span [37,48] at τ=0, all positive, 0 never in.\n\nSo for freeway 4, at τ=0: first car has 0 in.\n\nAt τ=5: second car has 0 in.\n\nAt τ=6: second car has 0 in.\n\nFreeway 3 same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,4), tail=-11, head=0, span [-11,0] at τ=0\n\nAt τ, [ -11+4τ, 0+4τ] = [4τ-11, 4τ]\n\n0 in if 4τ-11≤0≤4τ, true for τ=0,1,2? At τ=0: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=1: [-7,4], 0 in? -7≤0≤4 yes.\n\nτ=2: [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=3: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4), [25,36] all positive, never 0.\n\nThird car: (-40,-51,right,4), span [-51,-40] at τ=0, all negative, at τ [ -51+4τ, -40+4τ ], 0 in if -51+4τ≤0≤-40+4τ, so 4τ≤51, 4τ≥40, τ≥10, τ≤51/4=12.75, so τ=10,11,12\n\nAt τ=10: -51+40= -11, -40+40=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=11: -51+44= -7, -40+44=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=12: -51+48= -3, -40+48=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=13: -51+52=1, -40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 has car at x=0 for τ=0,1,2 (first car) and τ=10,11,12 (third car)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nNow, back to me: start at τ=0, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: at τ=0, span [-71,-48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAs above, only unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\nFirst, let's see freeway 8, since I might move to y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has same as 7: car (-48,-71,right,24), so same as freeway 7, unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, safe; τ=1: span [-71+24= -47, -48+24= -24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in; τ=2: [-23,0], 0 in; τ=3: [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nNow, y=9 has no freeway, so no car, always safe.\n\nBut to reach there, I need to be at y=8 or something and move up.\n\nNow, possible actions at each turn.\n\nStart at turn τ=0 (T=12), y=7.\n\nI can choose a_{12}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, y_{13} = 8.\n\nIf D, y_{13}=6.\n\nIf S, y_{13}=7.\n\nThen at next turn, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I could go U at τ=0 to y=8 at τ=1, then U at τ=1 to y=9 at τ=2.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid collision.\n\nAt τ=0, T=12, I am at y=7, freeway 7 is safe, as above.\n\nIf I go U, at τ=1, T=13, I will be at y=8.\n\nAt that time, freeway 8: at τ=1, as above, span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U again, to y=9 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, I arrive at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision to check. I am at (0,9), done.\n\nBut at which turn am I at y=9?\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, I reach y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nStart at t_1=12, y_12=7.\n\nAfter 0 actions, still at y=7.\n\nAfter 1 action, at T=13, y_13.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at T=14, y_14, and so on.\n\nI need y_{12 + H - 1} =9.\n\nMinimal H, so H=2: actions at T=12 and T=13, then at T=14, y_14=9? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nTo be at y_t =9 at some turn t.\n\nt = t_1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nSince I start at t=12, y=7.\n\nAfter first action (at t=12), I go to y_{13}.\n\nAfter second action (at t=13), I go to y_{14}, etc.\n\nSo to reach y=9, it could be at t=13,14,15,... \n\nEarliest possible: if I go U at t=12, to y=8 at t=13.\n\nThen U at t=13, to y=9 at t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H actions over H turns? The sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter executing these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position is (0,9).\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position (0, y_{t_1+1})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn t_1 + H, position (0, y_{t_1 + H}) = (0,9)\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=12, so y_{12 + H} =9.\n\nNow, with no cars, I can have H=2: actions at t=12 and t=13, then at t=14, y=9.\n\nActions: a_{12} and a_{13}, then y_{14}=9.\n\nNow with cars, I need to check for collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I am at y_T, and I need no collision at that turn.\n\nWhen I am at y_T, I choose a_T, then move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, so collision check at time T on freeway y_T.\n\nFor the turns when I am on a freeway, I need to avoid collision.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, I am at positions y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}, and for each, if y_t is between 1 and 8, I need no car at x=0 on that freeway at time t.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9, not on freeway, no issue.\n\nIn the minimal case with H=2:\n\nAction at t=12 (τ=0): I am at y=7.\n\nAction at t=13 (τ=1): I am at y=8 (if I went up at t=12).\n\nThen y_{14}=9.\n\nNow, collision points:\n\nAt turn T=12 (τ=0): I am at y=7, freeway 7. As above, at τ=0, span [-71,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn T=13 (τ=1): I am at y=8, freeway 8. At τ=1, freeway 8 car span [-71+24= -47, -48+24= -24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen I go to y=9 at T=14.\n\nNo collision, and I reach in 2 turns.\n\nBut is that possible? I need to specify the actions.\n\nActions: at t=12, I go U to y=8 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, I go U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt turn t=13, I am at y=8, which is safe as above.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 8 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, time since t_1, so T=13, τ=1.\n\nCar on freeway 8: position at τ=1: tail + sτ = -71 + 24*1 = -47, head + sτ = -48 + 24 = -24? Head is -48 at τ=0? No.\n\nCar: head at τ=0 is -48, tail is -71.\n\nFor right-moving, at time τ, position: tail + s τ, head + s τ.\n\nAt τ=0, tail=-71, head=-48.\n\nAt τ=1, tail= -71 +24 = -47, head= -48 +24 = -24.\n\nSo span [-47, -24], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0 for y=7, same, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 7 has issue at τ=2, but I am not there at τ=2.\n\nIn this path, at τ=2, T=14, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let me check if I need to go through other freeways.\n\nIn this case, I go directly to y=8 then y=9.\n\nBut y=8 might have other issues, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nThe problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in H=2 turns.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 at other times?\n\nFreeway 8 only unsafe at τ=2, but I am there at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 unsafe at τ=2, but I am there at τ=0, safe.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut let me make sure about the action sequence.\n\nt_1=12, start at y=7.\n\nAction a_{12} = U, so y_{13} = 7 +1 =8.\n\nThen at turn t=13, I am at y=8.\n\nAction a_{13} = U, so y_{14} =8+1=9.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nCollision at t=12: y=7, freeway 7, no car at 0.\n\nAt t=13: y=8, freeway 8, no car at 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nBut is freeway 8 clear at τ=1? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach faster, but H=2 is minimal since I need to increase y by 2.\n\nUnless I start at y=7, and go U once, to y=8 at t=13, but then I need another action to go to y=9, so minimum 2 actions.\n\nIf I do nothing, y stays, but I need to reach 9.\n\nSo H=2 is minimum.\n\nBut perhaps at some point, the freeway is blocked, so I need to wait or go around.\n\nIn this case, it seems not.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6, but I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car, as above.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 8 has the same as 7, but it's different freeway, but same car description.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-71,right,24), same as freeway 7.\n\nNo other cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 is different.\n\nBut I don't go to y=6.\n\nPerhaps I should list the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFor the player, since I start at y=7 and go to y=8, then y=9.\n\ny=7: freeway 7 unsafe only at τ=2 (T=14)\n\nBut I am at y=7 only at τ=0 (T=12), which is safe.\n\ny=8: freeway 8 unsafe only at τ=2 (T=14)\n\nBut in the path above, I am at y=8 at τ=1 (T=13), which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in one turn? But from y=7 to y=9 in one action? But actions only change by +1,-1,0, so I need at least two actions to go up twice.\n\nUnless I am already at y=9, but I am at y=7.\n\nSo H=2 should be possible.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be a sequence.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in this case H=2.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and freeways from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nIn the path, when I move, for example, if at turn T I am at y, I choose to move to y+1, then at turn T, I am on y, check cars on y.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y+1, check cars on y+1.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut let me confirm for freeway 8 at T=13, τ=1.\n\nT=13, τ=1, freeway 8, car: tail + s τ = -71 + 24*1 = -47, head + s τ = -48 + 24 = -24, so from -47 to -24, x=0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, y=7, car from -71 to -48, 0 not in.\n\nPerhaps there is another car or something.\n\nFreeway 8 only has one car, as listed.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 6, it has cars, but I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going directly is blocked, but it doesn't seem.\n\nAnother point: at the beginning, t_1=12, I am at y=7, and freeway 7 has no car at 0, good.\n\nBut let me see if at the time I move, something happens.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, freeway 8 might have car at other times, but no, only at τ=2.\n\nτ=2 is T=14.\n\nBut in the path, at T=14, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nActions: a_{12} = U, a_{13} = U.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut the boxed should contain the actions.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot do this? For example, if at T=13, y=8 is unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the car on freeway 7 at τ=2, but I am not there.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, not relevant.\n\nFor example, if I were to be on y=8 at a time when it is unsafe, but I am not.\n\nIn this path, no issue.\n\nBut let me see if H=2 is achievable.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in one action? No.\n\nOr if I go up faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or something, but that would increase H.\n\nSo I think H=2 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 5 or something, but I am not there.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no freeway.\n\nAnother thought: when I am at y=8 and move to y=9, at turn T, when I am at y=8, I might be at risk if car, but in this case safe.\n\nPerhaps at T=12, if I stay, but that would delay.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both have cars that are at x=0 only at τ=2.\n\nBut τ=2 is T=14.\n\nIn the path, at T=12, y=7 safe; T=13, y=8 safe; T=14, y=9 safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be simple.\n\nBut the problem might have a trick.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has car at x=0 from τ=9 to 12, but I don't go to y=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 at τ=0 and τ=4, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps if I go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=6, but freeway 6 has cars at x=0 at τ=9 to 12, which is T=21 to 24, far away, not relevant for minimal path.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have unsafe times later or earlier.\n\nSo I think going directly up is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2, actions: a_{12} = U, a_{13} = U.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=2, turns t=12 and t=13.\n\nActions: Turn 12: U, Turn 13: U.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut is there any issue with the cars?\n\nPerhaps at T=12, on y=7, is there a car? No.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 7 at T=12.\n\nT=12, τ=0, car on y=7: head -48, tail -71, span [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at T=13, y=8: car head -48, tail -71 at τ=0, at τ=1, tail -71+24=-47, head -48+24=-24, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the player position: at turn T, I am at (0,y_T), and for y_T between 1 and 8, I need to check collision.\n\nIn this case, both times safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why are there other freeways listed? Maybe to confuse, or for other paths.\n\nBut for minimal path, this is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in H=1? Impossible.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is two actions.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- The player starts at turn 12 at position (0, 7), which is on freeway \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 12, the cars on freeway \\(y = 7\\) have a span of \\([-71, -48]\\) at time \\(T = 12\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), and since 0 is not in this interval, there is no collision.\n- Choosing action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 12 moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, the player is at position (0, 8), which is on freeway \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 13 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), the cars on freeway \\(y = 8\\) have a span of \\([-47, -24]\\) (calculated as tail \\(-71 + 24 \\times 1 = -47\\) and head \\(-48 + 24 \\times 1 = -24\\)), and 0 is not in this interval, so there is no collision.\n- Choosing action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 13 moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- Position (0, 9) is not on any freeway (freeways are only from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision check is needed, and the goal is reached.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns, which is minimal since the player must increase their \\(y\\)-position by 2, and each action can change \\(y\\) by at most 1. Alternative paths, such as moving down or staying, would require more turns and are not minimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\)\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\)\n\nAfter these actions, at turn 14, the player is at (0, 9).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,8). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=8 and want to get to y=9.\n\nNote: The collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (meaning at position (0, y_T)), then we check the cars on that freeway at that turn T. The collision occurs if 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on freeway y_T. So we only check the cars on the current freeway at turn T. When we move to the next freeway, we are on that freeway at the next turn (T+1).\n\nWe are starting at turn 13 at position (0,8). We are on freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Note that freeway 0 and 9 do not have cars? But the player is at y=0 and y=9? The problem says freeways y=1,...,8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? Therefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nOur goal is to reach (0,9). So once we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at y=8 at turn 13. We can move to y=9 in one move by going up (U). But we must check if at turn 13 (current turn) we are safe on freeway 8? And then when we move to y=9 at the next turn (turn 14), we are at y=9 and safe.\n\nBut note: at turn 13, we are at y=8. So we must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nLooking at freeway 8: \n    Cars: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nThe car is moving right. The span at turn 13 is given as [tau, h] for right-moving? But note the representation: \n    For a right-moving car: initial span at t1 (turn 13) is (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s). \n    The representation says: (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is at a greater x-coordinate than the tail? \n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving:\n    Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given state for freeway 8: (-24, -47, right, 24). \n    This is (h, tau) or (head, tail)? The representation says: (head, tail, ...). \n\nHowever, in the update rule for right-moving, they write: \n    Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the given car is: (head h = -24, tail tau = -47). \n\nFor a right-moving car, the head should be at the front (right end) and tail at the back (left end). But here head=-24 and tail=-47? That would imply the head is to the right of the tail? Because -24 > -47. \n\nSo the car spans from x=-47 to x=-24? Then the span at t1 (turn 13) is [tau, h] = [-47, -24]. \n\nAt turn 13 (T = t1 = 13), the span is [-47, -24]. Is 0 in [-47, -24]? No, because -24 < 0. So we are safe at turn 13 on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, we can move up at turn 13: \n    a_{13} = U -> then at turn 14, we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn 14, we are at y=9. Since there are no cars on freeway 9 (as freeways are only 1-8), we are safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 1 turn? Then the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut wait, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So if H=1, then t=0 only? That is a_{13+0} = a_13.\n\nBut let me check: after one action (at turn 13) we move to y=9 at turn 14? The turn index: \n    At turn 13: we are at y=8, we choose action a_13. \n    Then at turn 14: the position becomes y_14 = y_13 + Delta y_13 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo we have reached (0,9) at turn 14? But the goal is to have at the last action (turn t1+H-1) the position is 9. \n\nThe last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the next state (turn t1+H) will have the updated position. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nNote: the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is after taking the last action? \n\nBut the update: \n    At turn t, we take action a_t, then we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take a_{t1} at turn t1 -> we get state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\nThen we take a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> state at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta y_{t1+1}\n...\nUntil we take the last action at turn t1+H-1: then we get state at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta y_{t1+H-1}\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? That doesn't seem right because after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we move to turn t1+H and then we are at y=9? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nBut note: the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state BEFORE taking the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we update to state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the condition might be that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9? Then that would be the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nLooking again: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThis implies that at the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action might change the state? However, we are already at 9, and if we take an action that moves up or down, we might leave 9? \n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9). So we must be at y=9 at some turn. And the condition is that at the turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9. Then we are done? And we don't require to stay? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". \n\nBut if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we have already reached the goal? Then why take an action? \n\nAlternatively, the sequence of actions is taken until we have moved to y=9. \n\nLet me read carefully: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So the position at turn t1+H-1 must be (0,9). \n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at some position. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we update to turn t1+H. So the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is not the result of the action taken at that turn.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the update: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo the position at turn t+1 is determined by the action at turn t.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t, and it was determined by the action taken at turn t-1.\n\nSo if we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, then we get:\n\n    After a_{t1} (at turn t1): state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}\n    ...\n    After a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1): state at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H}\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? That is, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\nBut that state is the result of the previous actions. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9, so we don't need to move? \n\nAlternatively, the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? Then if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we have achieved the goal? But then we don't need to take the action at that turn? However, the sequence includes H actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning from turn t1 to t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would change the state to turn t1+H, which is beyond the goal? \n\nAlternatively, the condition might be that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me try to clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose we start at turn t1=13 at y=8. We want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=1, then we require y_{13+1-1} = y_13 = 8 = 9? -> no.\n\nIf H=2, then we require y_{13+2-1}=y_14=9.\n\nHow do we get to y_14=9? \n    At turn 13: we take an action a_13. Then y_14 = y_13 + Delta y_13.\n    We want y_14=9, so we need to set a_13 such that y_13 + Delta y_13 = 9 -> so if y_13=8, we set a_13=U.\n\nThen the sequence is for t=0 to 1 (H=2): \n    t=0: a_{13} = U\n    t=1: a_{14} = ? \n\nBut then we also have to take an action at turn 14? But we are already at y_14=9? Then we don't need to do anything? But the sequence requires two actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the last action to be S (stay). Then at turn 14: we take S, so y_15 = y_14 + 0 = 9.\n\nBut then we are at y_15=9? But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 = 13+2-1=14, we are at y_14=9? \n\nYes: at the beginning of turn 14, we are at y=9. Then we take action a_14 (which we set to S) and then we update to turn 15: y_15=9.\n\nBut the condition is satisfied at the beginning of turn 14? Then we are done? But the sequence includes two actions.\n\nHowever, the minimal H would be 2? But we could have done it in one action? \n\nBut wait, if we set H=1, then we require y_{13+1-1}=y_13=9 -> but we start at 8, so no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2: \n    Turn 13: U -> moves to 9 at turn 14 (beginning of turn 14 we are at 9)\n    Turn 14: S -> we don't move, and at the beginning of turn 15 we are still at 9? But we only require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 14? \n\nBut the condition is for turn t1+H-1=14. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 14. Then we take an action at turn 14? But the problem only requires that we are at 9 at that turn? So we don't care what happens after? \n\nHowever, the sequence must have H actions. So for H=2, we have two actions.\n\nBut we can also do:\n    Turn 13: S -> then at turn 14 we are still at 8? Then we need to do U at turn 14 to get to 9 at turn 15. Then we require H=3: \n        at turn 14 (t1+1) we are at 8, then at turn 15 (t1+2) we are at 9. Then we need to set H=3 so that at turn t1+H-1 = 13+3-1=15 we are at 9.\n\nBut that takes longer.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2: \n    Turn 13: U -> then at turn 14 we are at 9 (so condition satisfied at turn 14 = t1+1 = t1+H-1 with H=2: 13+2-1=14).\n    Then we must also take an action at turn 14? But what? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we have to specify two actions.\n\nBut the goal is reached at turn 14 (beginning of turn 14 we are at 9). Then we can do any action at turn 14? However, we must avoid collisions. \n\nAt turn 14, we are at y=9. There are no cars on freeway 9, so we are safe. Then we can do any action? For example, we can do S (stay). \n\nBut note: if we do D at turn 14, we move down to 8 at turn 15. Then we are not at 9 anymore? But the condition only requires that at turn 14 (the last turn of the sequence) we are at 9. So after that, we don't care? \n\nYes, because the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 14, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn 14, and we don't care about the future beyond that turn.\n\nTherefore, we can set the action at turn 14 to be S (or even U or D, but U would be invalid because 9+1=10>9, so it would clamp? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go above 9, it might clamp to 9? \n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then we have y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, then y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1)=9? So it stays. Similarly, D would go to 8? \n\nBut to be safe, we can do S at turn 14.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n    Turn 13: U\n    Turn 14: S\n\nBut wait, we must check the collisions during the entire sequence.\n\nAt turn 13: we are at y=8. We take action U -> so we move to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nWe must check:\n    At turn 13: we are at y=8. We check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 13: \n    Car: (-24, -47, right, 24) -> span at turn 13: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau, h] = [-47, -24]. \n    0 is not in [-47, -24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn 14: we are at y=9. There are no cars on freeway 9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: the action at turn 14 is taken at y=9. We do S, so we stay at y=9 for turn 15? But we don't care about turn 15. We only care about the period until turn 14 (the last turn of the sequence).\n\nHowever, we must also check that during the move? The collision condition: \n    At turn T, we are at freeway y_T. \n\nAt turn 13: we are at y=8 -> check freeway 8: safe.\nAt turn 14: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut what about the transition? The problem states: \n    \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo during the entire turn T, we are on the freeway y_T. Therefore, we only check the freeway we are on at the beginning of the turn (which is the same throughout the turn).\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is safe.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? \n    H=1: then we require at turn t1+H-1 = 13+1-1=13: y_13=9. But we start at 8 -> not satisfied.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, what if we do not move at turn 13? Then we are at 8 at turn 14? Then we are not at 9 at turn 14? Then we need to move at turn 14: so we do U at turn 14, then at turn 15 we are at 9. Then we need H=3: \n    Turn 13: S\n    Turn 14: U\n    Turn 15: S\n\nBut that is H=3, which is longer.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if we are safe at turn 13 and 14.\n\nAt turn 13: y=8 -> freeway 8: car (-24,-47,right,24) -> span at turn 13: [-47,-24] -> 0 not in it -> safe.\n\nAt turn 14: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n    Turn 13: U\n    Turn 14: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". For H=2, t=0 and 1: \n    t=0: a_{13} = U\n    t=1: a_{14} = S\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut wait, I did not check the cars on other freeways? Why? Because we only check the freeway we are on at that turn. We were only on freeway 8 at turn 13 and freeway 9 at turn 14. Freeway 9 has no cars.\n\nHowever, what if we had to go through other freeways? In this case, we moved from freeway 8 to freeway 9 in one step. We never set foot on freeways 1-7? So we don't need to check them.\n\nBut what if we start at y=8 and we move up to y=9, we are not going through any other freeway? Because we are at freeway 8 at turn 13 and then freeway 9 at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, we only check freeway 8 at turn 13 and freeway 9 at turn 14.\n\nSo the above sequence is valid.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8 at turn 13: \n    The car is moving right at speed 24. \n    At turn 13: the span is [-47, -24]. \n    The car moves 24 units per turn? Then at turn 14, the car would be at [-47+24, -24+24] = [-23, 0]. So at turn 14, the car would cover [ -23, 0 ]? \n\nBut note: at turn 14, we are at freeway 9, so we don't care about freeway 8. However, at turn 13, the car on freeway 8 is at [-47,-24], which does not include 0.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway 8 for more turns? Then we might have been hit at turn 14? But we are not staying.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 2 turns.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". Since at turn 14 we are at y=9, which is not in 1..8, we are safe.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is (0,8) at turn 13. We are at freeway 8. The car on freeway 8: \n    (-24, -47, right, 24) -> at turn 13: the head is -24 and tail -47? \n    The update rule for right-moving: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]? \n    But the representation: the car is given as (head, tail, ...). For right-moving, head is the right end? \n\nBut in the update rule: \n    Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the head is h, tail is tau. \n\nSo at T=13: \n    tau = -47, h = -24 -> [ -47, -24 ]\n\nAt T=14: \n    tau = -47 + 24*(14-13) = -47+24 = -23\n    h = -24 + 24 = 0\n    So the car spans [-23, 0] at turn 14? \n\nBut at turn 14, we are at freeway 9, so we don't care.\n\nHowever, what if we had taken a different action? But we are moving up at turn 13, so we are not on freeway 8 at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is safe.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in H=1? We cannot because we start at 8 and we need to be at 9 at turn 13 (which we are not). \n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut note: we could do Turn 14: U? But that would try to go to 10, which is clamped to 9? Then we are still at 9. Or we could do D? Then we go to 8 at turn 15? But the condition is satisfied at turn 14 (we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 14). So we can do any action at turn 14. But to minimize any risk, we can do S.\n\nThe problem does not specify what happens after we reach, so we can choose any safe action. Since at freeway 9 we are always safe, we can choose S.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose U? But then we stay at 9? \n\nThe update: if we are at 9 and do U: \n    y_{15} = min(9, 9+1) = 9.\n\nSo it's safe. Similarly, D: \n    y_{15} = max(0, 9-1)=8.\n\nBut if we do D, then at turn 15 we are at 8, but we are not required to be there. Since the goal is only to be at 9 at turn 14, we can do D. But that would not be harmful? However, we are not required to stay.\n\nBut to be consistent, we can choose S.\n\nI think S is the natural choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: S\n}\n\nBut let me check if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nWhat about the other cars? We only used freeway 8. But what if we had to go through other freeways? In this case, we didn't.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We were on freeway 8 at turn 13, and we avoided the collision because the car didn't cover 0 at that turn.\n\nSo we are fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if the car on freeway 8 at turn 13 is the only one? Yes, according to the table.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car: (-24,-47,right,24).\n\nAnd we are safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, what if we started at a different position? Or if we had to go down? But here we start at 8 and want to go to 9, so up is the way.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=2.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". So we are providing H=2 and the sequence.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\). The goal is to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Current Position (Turn 13)**: The player is on freeway 8. The car on freeway 8 is given as \\((-24, -47, \\text{right}, 24)\\). For a right-moving car, the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\). At turn 13 (\\(T = 13\\)):\n  - Span = \\([-47 + 24(13 - 13), -24 + 24(13 - 13)] = [-47, -24]\\).\n  - The player's x-coordinate is 0, which is not in the interval \\([-47, -24]\\). Thus, no collision occurs at turn 13.\n- **Action at Turn 13**: Moving up (\\(U\\)) changes the player's position to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- **Position at Turn 14**: The player is on freeway 9. Since freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\) have cars, but freeway 9 has no cars (as per the problem statement), the player is safe at turn 14.\n- **Minimal Turns**: To reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13 + H - 1\\):\n  - For \\(H = 1\\), \\(y_{13} = 8 \\neq 9\\) (not satisfied).\n  - For \\(H = 2\\), \\(y_{13 + 2 - 1} = y_{14} = 9\\) (satisfied after the action at turn 13).\n  - Thus, \\(H = 2\\) is minimal.\n- **Action at Turn 14**: The player is already at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 14. The action can be stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (or any action, but \\(S\\) is safe and simple).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- **Turn 13**: \\(U\\) (moves from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14).\n- **Turn 14**: \\(S\\) (stays at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 14 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13 + 2 - 1 = 14\\)) and avoids collisions:\n- At turn 13: On freeway 8, no collision (0 not in \\([-47, -24]\\)).\n- At turn 14: On freeway 9, no cars.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: S\n}",
