        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0 and we wish to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe grid has vertical positions y=0 to y=9. We start at y0=0 and want to end at y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), or S (stay: y remains same). Note that y must stay in [0,9]. Since we are at 0 and we want to go to 9, we cannot go below 0 and we must end at 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). We collide if there is a car on freeway y_T (which is one of the lanes 1..8) and at that turn T, the car's span includes 0. Note that the car spans are given for freeway k (which corresponds to y=k) and they move.\n\nImportant: when we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are only on freeway y_T during turn T. So when we are at turn T, we are on freeway y_T and we check for collisions on that freeway at that turn. Then we take an action and at turn T+1 we are on freeway y_{T+1}. So we don't have to worry about freeway y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nGiven the car state:\n\nWe have 8 freeways (k=1 to 8). Each freeway has a list of cars. Each car is represented by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation for direction: \n- For a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost (larger x) and tail is the leftmost (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] and it moves to the right: [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost (smaller x) and tail is the rightmost (larger x). But note the example: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But wait, the example given in the problem uses [h, tau] for left and [tau, h] for right? Actually, let me read again:\n\nFor car k on freeway i:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: \n  (-48, -59, right, 4) -> this is (head, tail, direction, speed) for right? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] meaning tail is first? \n\nBut the car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nWe must interpret the given tuple (h, tau, d, s) as:\n\nIf d is right: then the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (because tail is the left end, head is the right end) and then at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nIf d is left: then the initial span at t1 is [h, tau] (because head is the left end, tail is the right end) and then at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Actually, looking at the table:\n\nAll cars have direction \"right\". So every car is right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for a car (h, tau, \"right\", s) at t1=0, the span at time T is [tau + s*T, h + s*T].\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head is the right end. So if we are given (head, tail) for a right-moving car, then the tail is the left and head is the right? \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the tuple given as (h, tau) for a right car? But in the table, the car on freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4). \n\nSo let me denote the tuple as (head, tail, d, s). Then for a right car, the initial span is [tail, head]? Because the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the span goes from tau to h. So if we have (head, tail) then the head is h and tail is tau? Then the span is [tail, head]. \n\nBut in the example: (-48, -59, right, 4): \n  tail = -59, head = -48 -> so the car at time 0 occupies [ -59, -48 ]? \n\nThen at time T, the car will be at [ -59 + 4*T, -48 + 4*T ].\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway 1: \n  (-12, -23, right, 4) -> [ -23, -12 ] at time 0 -> at T: [ -23+4T, -12+4T ]\n  (24, 13, right, 4) -> [13,24] at time 0 -> at T: [13+4T, 24+4T]\n\nNow, we are at position (0, y) at time T. We collide on freeway k=y if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nNote: the freeway k=1 corresponds to y=1, k=2 to y=2, ... k=8 to y=8. We do not have cars on y=0 and y=9, so we are safe at y=0 and y=9? Actually, the problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. Therefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nSo we start at y=0 at time 0 (safe) and we want to get to y=9 (safe). The danger is in the lanes 1 to 8.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=0 to y=9 without colliding in between.\n\nWe are at time T (starting at T=0) at position y_T. We choose an action a_T which determines y_{T+1}. Then at time T+1 we are at y_{T+1}. We must not collide at any time T>=0 when we are in a lane between 1 and 8.\n\nOur goal is to minimize H (the number of turns) such that at time H-1 (because we start at t=0 and take H actions: t=0 to t=H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nNote: the minimal H without any cars would be 9: we do U 9 times. But with cars, we may have to wait (use S) or even go down (D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions. We have to consider the state: time T and position y.\n\nWe can try to compute the minimal H by BFS in state space (time, y). However, note that time can be large? But since the cars are moving periodically? Actually, the cars are moving at constant speed and the grid is infinite in x, but we only care about when the car spans cover 0. Since the cars are moving at integer speeds and we are at integer times, we can compute for each freeway and for each car the set of times when the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: at a given freeway k, we have multiple cars. We must avoid any car on that freeway at the time we are on that freeway.\n\nSo for freeway k, let F_k(T) = true if at time T, there is at least one car on freeway k that has 0 in its span. Then we are safe at time T on freeway k only if F_k(T) is false.\n\nBut note: we are only on freeway k at time T if our y_T = k.\n\nSo we can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on k, the set of times T for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nFor a right-moving car on freeway k with initial span [tail, head] at time 0 and speed s, the span at time T is [tail + s*T, head + s*T]. We require:\n   tail + s*T <= 0 <= head + s*T\n\nSo:\n  T >= ceil(( - head ) / s)   ??? Actually, let's solve:\n\n  tail + s*T <= 0  => T >= ceil( (-tail) / s)   ? but note: tail is negative? \n\nActually, for the car (-48,-59,right,4) at time 0: [ -59, -48]\nAt time T: [ -59+4T, -48+4T]\n\nWe want -59+4T <= 0 <= -48+4T.\n\nSo:\n  -59+4T <= 0  => 4T <= 59 => T <= 59/4 = 14.75 -> T <= 14 (if we take integer T, then T<=14? because at T=15: -59+60=1>0 -> fails the first inequality? Actually, we require both:\n\n  1. -59+4T <= 0  -> T <= 14.75 -> so T <= 14\n  2. 0 <= -48+4T -> 48 <= 4T -> T >= 12\n\nSo for T in [12,14] (inclusive) this car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the car (-12,-23,right,4): \n  -23+4T <= 0 <= -12+4T\n  => 1. -23+4T<=0 -> T<=5.75 -> T<=5\n      2. 0<=-12+4T -> 12<=4T -> T>=3\n  So T in [3,5]\n\nAnd for (24,13,right,4): \n  13+4T <= 0 <= 24+4T -> \n  The first inequality: 13+4T<=0 -> T<= -13/4 -> which is negative -> no solution? \n  Actually, at time 0: the car is at [13,24] which is entirely positive. As time increases, it moves right and never covers 0. So this car never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, the dangerous times are:\n  Car1: T=12,13,14\n  Car2: T=3,4,5\n  Car3: never\n\nSo F_1(T) is true for T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every freeway.\n\nBut note: the car state table:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  (-48,-59,right,4): dangerous at T=12,13,14\n  (-12,-23,right,4): dangerous at T=3,4,5\n  (24,13,right,4): never\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> \n  For right-moving: initial span [37,48]. Then at time T: [37+12T,48+12T]\n  We want 37+12T<=0<=48+12T? \n  37+12T<=0 -> T<= -37/12 -> negative, so never. \n  Actually, at T=0: [37,48] is positive. So never dangerous.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same as the first car on freeway1: dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway1: three cars -> dangerous at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway1 -> dangerous at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway1 -> dangerous at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-48,-59,right,4) -> dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-48,-59,right,4) -> dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\nFreeway 2: {} -> always safe\nFreeway 3: {12,13,14}\nFreeway 4: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\nFreeway 5: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\nFreeway 6: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\nFreeway 7: {12,13,14}\nFreeway 8: {12,13,14}\n\nWe start at time 0 at y=0 (safe). We want to get to y=9. We can move at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate from time T=0, y=0. We take an action at each time and move to the next state.\n\nWe wish to minimize the total time H. We can use BFS (breadth-first search) in the state (T, y) but note that T can be large? However, we can set a bound. The minimal H without obstacles is 9, and with obstacles we might have to wait a few turns, so we can set a maximum H, say 20.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Dijkstra (each action costs 1 turn) and we want to minimize time.\n\nBut note: the state is (time, y). The actions: U, D, S lead to (T+1, y+1), (T+1, y-1), (T+1, y) respectively, provided the new y is in [0,9].\n\nAnd we must check that if we are at y (which is in 1..8) at time T, then we must not be in a dangerous time for that freeway.\n\nWe are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe start at (0,0) and we want to reach any (T,9) with minimal T.\n\nWe can do BFS:\n\nLet Q be a queue of (time, y, path) \nBut we don't need to store the entire path if we are doing BFS and we care about minimal time. We can use a visited array: visited[T][y] = whether we have been at (T,y). However, T can be large? But we can set a limit. Alternatively, we can use state (y) and note that the time is increasing, but the dangerous times are periodic? Actually, the cars move linearly so the dangerous times are finite intervals? Actually, the dangerous intervals are finite? For each car, the dangerous interval is a contiguous set of integers? And each car only covers 0 for a finite set of times? \n\nBut note: for a car that never passes 0, it is safe. For a car that passes 0, it only covers 0 for a finite consecutive set of times (as in the example). So after a while, the car moves away. Therefore, after a sufficiently large time, the freeway becomes safe again? \n\nBut in our case, the dangerous times we computed are only for the initial cars. However, note the update: the cars move indefinitely. But the problem does not say they wrap around. They just move. So after time 14, the cars that were dangerous at T=12..14 have moved beyond 0? \n\nFor example, the car (-48,-59,right,4): at T=15: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12]. So safe after T=14.\n\nSimilarly, the car (-12,-23,right,4): after T=5, at T=6: [-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> safe.\n\nSo beyond T=14, all freeways are safe? \n\nTherefore, if we wait long enough, we can go through without any problem. But we want minimal time.\n\nSo we can set a time limit: we know that after T=14, the roads are clear. So the worst-case minimal time is at most 14 (wait until T=14 at y=0) then go up 9 times -> H=23? But we can also move during the safe times.\n\nWe can simulate from T=0 to T=20 and see the minimal time to reach y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nLet dist[time][y] = minimal time (or steps) taken to reach (time, y). But note: we are starting at time0, so the time index T is the same as the number of turns taken? Actually, at time T, we have taken T actions? \n\nWe start at T=0, y=0. Then we take an action at time0, which leads to time1, and so on.\n\nWe are going to represent the state at the beginning of a turn: at time T, we are at y, and we are about to take an action a_T that will lead to y_{T+1} at time T+1? \n\nBut note: the problem says: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, then at turn T+1 we are at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nThe collision check at turn T: we are at y_T at time T. So if y_T is between 1 and 8, we must check the freeway y_T at time T.\n\nSo our state at the beginning of turn T: (T, y_T). We then choose an action a_T which leads to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, and then we move to state (T+1, y_{T+1}).\n\nWe start at (0,0). We want to find a sequence of actions until we first reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning that at turn T we have y_T=9. Then H = T+1? Because we started at turn0 and took T+1 actions? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and we have H actions. The initial state is at turn t1 (which is 0) and then we take H actions: so we end at turn t1 + H - 1. Therefore, we end at turn H-1 (if t1=0). So if we end at turn T, then T = H-1, so H = T+1.\n\nBut we are counting the time steps: \n  Turn0: we start at y0=0, then take action a0 -> leads to y1 at turn1.\n  ...\n  At turn T: we are at y_T. We want y_T=9 and we stop. Then the actions we took are from a0 to a_{T-1}? Actually, the actions are for the turns: \n    Turn0: a0\n    Turn1: a1\n    ...\n    Turn T-1: a_{T-1}\n  and then at turn T we are at y_T=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning t=0 to H-1, so H actions. And then we are at turn t1+H = 0+H. So if we end at turn T, then H = T? \n\nWait, the initial turn is t1=0. Then we take actions at turn0, turn1, ... turn (H-1). Then at turn H, we are at the position? \n\nThe update: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at the end of turn t (after taking a_t) we are at y_{t+1}. But the problem says: the sequence of actions is taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and we end at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at time t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then after taking the last action at time t1+H-1, we have the position at time t1+H? \n\nBut the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + delta\n\nSo if we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, then we have:\n  at turn t1: we start at initial y_{t1} (given). Then we take a_{t1} -> we get y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n  ...\n  at turn t1+H-1: we take a_{t1+H-1} -> we get y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nWe require y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLet me reread: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nWait: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we end at turn t1+H-1 at position 9.\n\nBut how? \n  At turn t1: we start at (0, y_{t1}) -> then we take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta.\n  ...\n  At turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We require this to be 9.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1? Then we are at position 9 at the same turn? But note: the collision condition: at turn t, we are at y_t and we check the freeway at that turn. Then we take an action and then at the next turn we are at the next position.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn T, we must be at position (0,9) at turn T, and then we don't take an action after that? \n\nSo we start at turn0: y0=0. We take H actions: at turn0, turn1, ... turn H-1. Then at turn H, we are at y_H. But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9, meaning at turn H-1 we are at 9? \n\nActually, the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1 (so H actions) and we end at turn t1+H-1 (which is 0+H-1 = H-1) at position 9.\n\nTherefore, we require that at turn H-1, we are at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn H-1, we are at position 9. How did we get there? \n  At turn H-2: we were at some position y_{H-2}, then we took an action a_{H-2} that led to y_{H-1}=9.\n\nBut then at turn H-1, we are at 9 and we do not take an action? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take actions at turn0 to turn H-1. So the last action is taken at turn H-1? But then after taking the last action at turn H-1, we are at y_{H}? \n\nI think there is a confusion.\n\nLooking back at the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t is determined by a_t.\n\nSo if we take an action a_t at turn t, it affects the position at the next turn (t+1).\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t is determined by the previous actions. \n\nWe start at turn0 with y0=0. Then:\n  After a0 (at turn0): y1 = y0 + delta0 -> so at turn1, we are at y1.\n  ...\n  After a_{H-1} (at turn H-1): y_H = y_{H-1} + delta_{H-1}.\n\nBut we require that at turn H-1 we are at 9? That would be y_{H-1}=9. Then we take an action at turn H-1? Then we go to y_H which might be 10? But we cannot go above 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we are at turn t1+H-1 at position 9.\n\nTherefore, we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut how do we achieve that? \n  We start at turn0: y0=0.\n  We take actions a0, a1, ..., a_{H-2} to get to y_{H-1}=9.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn H-2? Then the sequence of actions is for turns 0 to H-2? But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand \n  \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut by the update rule, the action at turn t1+t (for t from 0 to H-1) will be applied to update from y_{t1+t} to y_{t1+t+1}. Therefore, the last action at turn t1+H-1 will update to y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have been at 9 at turn t1+H-1 without taking an action at that turn? But the problem says we take an action at that turn.\n\nThis suggests that the problem means: we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? But no, because at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y_{t1+H-1}, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and move to y_{t1+H}. \n\nAlternatively, the requirement is that after taking the sequence of H actions, we are at 9 at the next turn? That is, at turn t1+H we are at 9. Then the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and we end at turn t1+H at 9. Then the minimal H is the number of actions to get from the start (turn0, y0=0) to (turn H, y_H=9).\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand\n\n\"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut by the dynamics, y_{t1+H-1} is the position at turn t1+H-1, and it is determined by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. The action at turn t1+H-1 would then update it to y_{t1+H}. \n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence of actions includes a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo we are writing actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we are at turn t1+H-1 after taking the last action? But the position at turn t1+H-1 is the one we have at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action?\n\nThe problem says: at turn t, we are at (0,y_t), then we choose a_t, then we update to y_{t+1}. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t. Then we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions we write for turn t is the action we take at that turn, which will move us to the next position at the next turn.\n\nWe require that at some turn T, we are at 9. The turn T is the turn at which we are at 9. But we take an action at that turn? Then we would move away? \n\nThe problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? But then we move to y_{t1+H} which might be 8 or 10 or 9 (if we choose S).\n\nBut the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, regardless of the action taken at that turn? And then we stop? \n\nYes, that makes sense. We take the action at turn t1+H-1 and then we are done. We don't care about the next state. \n\nAnd the collision condition: at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, and then we check for collision? But at y=9, there are no cars, so safe.\n\nTherefore, we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. We take an action (any action) at that turn, but it doesn't matter because we have reached the goal at the beginning of the turn.\n\nSo in our simulation, we want to reach a state (T, y) where y=9 and T is the turn number. We can reach it by any sequence of actions that gets us to y=9 at turn T, and then we output the actions from turn0 to turn T-1? Because at turn T, we are at y_T=9, and then we take an action at turn T (which is the last action in the sequence) but we don't care where it goes.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is for turns 0 to T? Then H = T+1 turns? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and we are at turn t1+H-1 at position 9. \n\nIf we are at turn T at position 9, then we set H = T+1? But then the last turn in the sequence is turn t1+H-1 = turn (0 + (T+1) - 1) = turn T. So we include the action at turn T.\n\nBut at turn T, we are at position 9. Then we take an action a_T. But we don't care what happens after.\n\nSo in the simulation, we can consider that we have reached the goal at the beginning of turn T, and then we must take one additional action at turn T to complete the sequence? But the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T.\n\nSo we can stop as soon as we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\nTherefore, we are searching for the minimal T such that we can be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T. Then the number of actions is T, because we take an action at each turn from 0 to T-1. But then the sequence is for turns0 to turn T-1, and H = T. And then at turn T, we are at 9. But the problem requires the sequence for turns0 to turn H-1, and H is the number of turns (actions). \n\nIf we are at turn T with y_T=9, then we have taken T actions? \n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n  Turn0 (beginning): y0=0 -> take action a0 -> then we have y1 = y0 + delta0.\n  Turn1: y1 -> take action a1 -> y2 = y1+delta1.\n  ...\n  Turn T-1: y_{T-1} -> take action a_{T-1} -> y_T = y_{T-1} + delta_{T-1}.\n\nWe want y_T = 9? But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9. If we set H-1 = T, then y_{t1+H-1}=y_T=9. Then H = T+1.\n\nBut then the actions are for turns0 to turn H-1 = turn0 to turn T. That is, we would have taken actions a0 to a_T. But then the last action a_T is taken at turn T, which would update y_{T} to y_{T+1}. But we want y_T=9, not y_{T+1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, then we have y_T=9. This means that the action taken at turn T-1 must have been such that it moved to 9. And then at turn T, we are at 9. Then we take an action a_T at turn T (which is the last action in the sequence) and then we are done. And we don't care about y_{T+1}.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn T is (T, y_T). We start at (0,0). We want to reach (T,9) for some T. The actions: at state (T,y), we choose a_T in {U,D,S} and then we go to (T+1, y') where y' = clamp(y + delta, 0,9).\n\nAnd we must ensure that at every state (T,y) with y in [1,8], the freeway y is safe at time T.\n\nWe are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nThe minimal T such that we reach (T,9) is what we want. And then we output the actions a0, a1, ..., a_{T-1} for turns0 to turn T-1? But the sequence should include turn0 to turn T? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. We want to be at turn t1+H-1 = T? Then H-1 = T, so H = T+1. And the actions are for turns0 to turn T (since t1=0, and turns from 0 to T: that's T+1 actions? But then we have one extra action.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at (T,9), then we have not taken an action at turn T yet. We are about to take one. So we must take one action at turn T. Then the total number of actions is T+1 (from turn0 to turn T). And H = T+1. And then at turn T, we take an action (any action) and we are done.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn T (at the beginning), so we have already achieved the goal before taking the action at turn T. \n\nTherefore, we can choose any action at turn T. To minimize time, we might choose S (stay) so that we remain at 9? But the next state is not required.\n\nSo the plan: we want to reach (T,9) for some T. Then we output the actions for turn0 to turn T. The action at turn T can be arbitrary (we can choose S).\n\nBut the minimal T is what we care about.\n\nSo we will do BFS over states (T,y) for T from 0 up to say 20, and y from 0 to 9.\n\nWe start at (0,0).\n\nFrom state (T,y), we can go to (T+1, y') for y' in {y-1, y, y+1} ∩ [0,9].\n\nAnd we have a collision check: at (T,y) if y is in [1,8], then we must not have a car on freeway y at time T.\n\nIf y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\nWe want to find the minimal T such that we can reach (T,9).\n\nOnce we reach (T,9), we have to output the sequence of actions from turn0 to turn T. But note: the action at turn0 leads to the state at turn1, but we haven't checked collision at turn0? \n\nAt turn0, we start at (0,0) -> y0=0 (safe). Then we take an action a0 which moves us to y1. Then at turn1, we are at (1,y1) and we check collision then.\n\nSo we never have to check collision at turn0 because we are at y=0.\n\nThe collision checks are for the states we are in at the beginning of the turn.\n\nTherefore, in our BFS, when we are at state (T,y), we have already passed the collision check for that state (because we wouldn't be there if it were not safe).\n\nThen we choose an action and move to (T+1, y').\n\nBut when we move to (T+1,y'), we will check collision at (T+1,y') only if we are about to use it? Actually, we should check the state (T+1,y') at time T+1.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\n  Let's have a queue for BFS: (time, y, path_actions) \n  We start: (0,0, [])\n\n  We wish to find the minimal time T such that we have a state (T,9, path) and then we output the actions in path for turns0 to turn T-1, and then for turn T we choose an action arbitrarily (since we are at 9, we can choose S).\n\n  But wait: the path so far for state (T,y) is the list of actions taken from turn0 to turn T-1. Because:\n      at time0: we start, then we take action a0 -> leads to (1,y1)\n      ...\n      at time T-1: we take action a_{T-1} -> leads to (T,y_T)\n\n  So to get to (T,9), we have a sequence of T actions: a0 to a_{T-1}. Then at turn T, we are at (T,9) and we need to output one more action for turn T? \n\n  The problem requires a sequence of actions for turns0 to turn H-1, and we are at turn H-1 at position 9. If we are at (T,9), then we can set H-1 = T, so H = T+1, and the actions are for turns0 to turn T. Therefore, we need T+1 actions.\n\n  How do we get the last action? \n\n  We can output the actions we have (which are T actions) and then one more action at turn T. Since we are at 9, we can choose S (stay) for the last action.\n\n  So the total number of actions is T+1, and the last action is at turn T.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      We are at (T,9). Then we choose a_T = S.\n\n  But note: we must also check that if we choose S at turn T, we remain at 9, and then at turn T+1 we would be at (T+1,9). But we don't care about turn T+1. And at turn T, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\n  So it is safe.\n\n  Alternatively, we can consider that the goal is reached at turn T, and then we output the actions up to turn T.\n\n  Therefore, we can stop as soon as we reach (T,9) for any T. Then we output the actions that got us there (which are for turns0 to T-1) and then add one more action at turn T: a_T = S.\n\n  But is that minimal? Because we might have a path that lands on (T,9) and then we add an extra action. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn T, and then take an action at turn T. So the total number of actions is T+1.\n\n  We can also consider paths that reach (T,9) and then at turn T we take an action. But we don't need to extend the state beyond (T,9) because we are done.\n\n  So in BFS, we can stop as soon as we pop a state (T,9). Then the actions are the path that got us there (which is T actions) and then we add one more action at turn T: S.\n\n  But note: we might have reached (T,9) by different paths. We want the minimal T.\n\n  However, we might have a path that reaches (T,9) at the beginning of turn T, and then we take an action at turn T. So the total time is T+1 turns? But the problem says H is the minimal number of turns. And we have taken T+1 actions.\n\n  Therefore, H = T+1.\n\n  And the actions: the first T actions are the ones that brought us to (T,9), and the last action is a_T=S.\n\n  But we could also choose U or D at turn T? But if we choose U at turn T, we go to 10 -> not allowed, so we clamp to 9? Or does the update disallow? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and then clamped to [0,9]. \n\n  The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, then y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1)=9? Or is it explicitly clamped? The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we can assume it is clamped.\n\n  But the update rule does not explicitly say clamping, but it says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So we must clamp.\n\n  Therefore, at y=9, \n      a_t = U: y_{t+1} = 9 (clamped)\n      a_t = D: y_{t+1} = 8\n      a_t = S: y_{t+1} = 9\n\n  So if we choose U or S, we stay at 9. If we choose D, we go to 8.\n\n  But we don't care about the next state. However, the problem only requires that at turn T we are at 9. It doesn't require that we stay there.\n\n  But the goal is to be at 9 at turn T. We are at 9 at turn T. Then we take an action. So if we choose D at turn T, then at turn T+1 we are at 8, but that's after the turn we care about.\n\n  So we can choose any action at turn T. To keep it simple, we choose S.\n\n  Therefore, the plan:\n\n      Use BFS to find the minimal T such that we can reach (T,9). \n          The state: (time, y)\n          We start at (0,0)\n          We expand: for each action in {U, D, S}:\n               y_next = clamp(y + delta, 0,9)\n               next_time = time+1\n               Then if we are moving to (next_time, y_next), we must check that at the new state (next_time, y_next) is safe? \n                   But note: at the current state (time,y) we are safe (because we are in the state) and we are about to move to (next_time, y_next). \n                   The collision check for (next_time, y_next) will be done when we enter that state.\n\n          But in BFS, we will check when we generate (next_time, y_next): \n              if y_next is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n              else (1..8): check if time = next_time, freeway y_next is dangerous at time next_time.\n\n          If it is safe, we add the state.\n\n      We stop when we first reach a state (T,9). \n\n      Then the number of actions taken to get to (T,9) is T (because we took T actions: from turn0 to turn T-1). \n      Then we need to add one more action at turn T: so total actions = T+1.\n\n      The actions: we have the path for the first T actions. For the last action (turn T), we choose 'S'.\n\n      Then we output:\n          Turn0: a0\n          Turn1: a1\n          ...\n          TurnT: S\n\n      And H = T+1.\n\n  But note: we might have multiple ways to get to (T,9) in the same T. We want the minimal T.\n\n  We'll do a BFS that expands states (time,y) in increasing time.\n\n  We'll use a queue, and we mark visited[time][y] to avoid revisiting with a higher time? But if we revisit with the same time and y, we can skip? Actually, the state is (time,y). And we want minimal time, so if we reach (T,9) we stop.\n\n  But we might find a path to (T,9) and then stop. That will be minimal T.\n\n  However, note that there might be a lower T? We start at T=0, then we expand to T=1, then T=2, ... until we hit (T,9).\n\n  We must avoid states that are not safe: if we are at (time,y) and y in [1,8] and that freeway is dangerous at that time, then we cannot be there. But in our BFS, we only generate states that are safe.\n\n  How to check safety for (time, y) (with y in [1,8]): \n        Check the freeway y at time `time` (which is the same as T in the state).\n\n        We have precomputed for each freeway k (1..8) the set of dangerous times.\n\n        For freeway y, if time is in the dangerous set for that freeway, then it is unsafe. Otherwise, safe.\n\n  We precomputed:\n\n      Freeway1: dangerous at T in {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n      Freeway2: safe always\n      Freeway3: {12,13,14}\n      Freeway4: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n      Freeway5: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n      Freeway6: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n      Freeway7: {12,13,14}\n      Freeway8: {12,13,14}\n\n  So we can write a helper function:\n\n      def is_safe(time, y):\n          if y==0 or y==9:\n              return True\n          if y==1:\n              return time not in [3,4,5,12,13,14]\n          if y==2:\n              return True\n          if y==3:\n              return time not in [12,13,14]\n          if y==4:\n              return time not in [3,4,5,12,13,14]\n          if y==5:\n              return time not in [3,4,5,12,13,14]\n          if y==6:\n              return time not in [3,4,5,12,13,14]\n          if y==7:\n              return time not in [12,13,14]\n          if y==8:\n              return time not in [12,13,14]\n\n  Now, we do BFS:\n\n      Let dist[time][y] = minimum time value? We don't need dist, we are doing BFS by time.\n\n      We use a queue: collections.deque()\n\n      We start: (0,0) with path=[].\n\n      Then we expand:\n\n          For each action in ['U','D','S']:\n              next_y = y + delta\n              clamp next_y to [0,9]\n\n              next_time = time+1\n\n              Then we check the state (next_time, next_y) for safety.\n\n              If safe, then we mark visited and push.\n\n      We use a visited set: visited[time][y] to avoid duplicate states? But note: we might have multiple ways to reach the same (time,y). We want the one with the minimal time? But time is fixed. So if we reach (time,y) we can skip if we have been there? Because the future expansion is independent of the path.\n\n      We'll use a 2D array (or set) of tuples (time,y).\n\n      We stop when we pop a state (time,y) with y==9.\n\n      Then we output the actions: the path that got us to (time,y) (which is the list of actions for turns0 to time-1) and then add one action for turn `time`: 'S'.\n\n      The total number of actions is time+1.\n\n  But note: we might reach (time,9) for time=9? That is, the minimal without obstacles.\n\n  Let's try without obstacles: \n        Start at (0,0)\n        We want to go to (9,9) -> but then we output actions for 9 actions (turns0 to 8) and then an action at turn9: S -> total 10 actions.\n\n        But we could be at (8,9) -> then we output 8 actions and then the 9th action at turn8? \n\n        How do we get to (8,9)? \n\n        We start at (0,0). \n        We need 8 actions: U repeated 8 times: \n            turn0: U -> (1,1)\n            turn1: U -> (2,2)\n            ...\n            turn7: U -> (8,8) -> then at turn8: we do U -> (9,9) -> but then we are at (9,9) at time9.\n\n        We want to be at 9 at time8: that is, at the beginning of turn8 we are at 9. \n\n        How? \n            turn7: we are at (7,8) and we do U -> then at time8 we are at 9.\n\n        So we reached (8,9) at time8. \n\n        Then we output the actions for turns0 to 7: 8 actions (all U), and then at turn8 we output 'S'. \n\n        So total 9 actions? \n\n        But the minimal to get to 9 is 9 moves? \n\n        The problem: to go from 0 to 9, we need 9 moves up. \n\n        In this representation: \n            At time0: y0=0.\n            After 1st U (turn0): y1=1.\n            ...\n            After 8th U (turn7): y8=8.\n            Then at turn8: we do U again: y9=9.\n\n        Then we are at (9,9) at time9.\n\n        But we want to be at 9 at turn8? That would be y8=9.\n\n        How to get y8=9? \n            We must be at 8 at turn7 and then do U at turn7 -> so y8=9.\n\n        So we are at (8,9) at time8.\n\n        Then we take an action at turn8: which is the 9th action.\n\n        So minimal H is 9 actions? But we are at 9 at time8 (the beginning of turn8) and then we take an action at turn8 (the 9th action) and then we are done.\n\n        The goal is achieved at the beginning of turn8.\n\n        So without obstacles, minimal H is 9.\n\n        And the actions: \n            turn0: U\n            turn1: U\n            ...\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: S   (or U, but then it would go to 10? but clamped to 9, so same as S)\n\n        So 9 actions.\n\n        Therefore, H=9.\n\n        But in the BFS, we stop at (8,9) -> then we output 8 actions (for turns0 to 7) and then one action for turn8: S. Total 9 actions.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n  Therefore, we do:\n\n      We simulate until we find a state (T,9) for some T.\n\n      We start with (0,0, []) in the queue.\n\n      visited = set(), or we can use a 2D array for time and y. But time can be up to 20.\n\n      We'll do:\n\n          queue = deque()\n          queue.append((0,0, []))   # (time, y, actions_so_far) where actions_so_far are the actions from turn0 to turn (time-1)\n\n          visited = set()   # store tuples (time, y)\n\n          while queue:\n               pop state (t, y, path)\n               if y == 9: \n                   # we are at (t,9)\n                   # then the total actions we have is for turns0 to t-1 (which is t actions)\n                   # we need to output for turns0 to t: so we add one more action at turn t: 'S'\n                   full_path = path + ['S']\n                   H = t+1\n                   break\n\n               if (t,y) in visited: skip\n               mark visited.add((t,y))\n\n               For each action in ['U','D','S']:\n                   if action=='U': new_y = min(9, y+1)\n                   if action=='D': new_y = max(0, y-1)\n                   if action=='S': new_y = y\n\n                   new_time = t+1\n\n                   # Check if (new_time, new_y) is safe?\n                   if new_y in [0,9]:\n                       safe = True\n                   else:\n                       safe = not (new_time in dangerous_times[new_y])   # we have to define dangerous_times for each y (freeway)\n\n                   If safe, and (new_time, new_y) not in visited, then we push (new_time, new_y, path + [action])\n\n          Then output the full_path.\n\n  But note: we might have multiple actions that lead to the same (new_time, new_y). We want to avoid duplicates.\n\n  We'll break when we find the first (t,9) because we are doing BFS by time (each step time+1) and we expand in increasing time, so the first time we hit y=9 is the minimal time.\n\n  We must precompute dangerous_times for each freeway (y from 1 to 8) as a set.\n\n  Let's define:\n\n      dangerous_times = {\n          1: {3,4,5,12,13,14},\n          2: set(),\n          3: {12,13,14},\n          4: {3,4,5,12,13,14},\n          5: {3,4,5,12,13,14},\n          6: {3,4,5,12,13,14},\n          7: {12,13,14},\n          8: {12,13,14}\n      }\n\n  Now, we run BFS.\n\n  We'll simulate manually or code. Since the time is small, we can do by hand.\n\n  We start at (0,0) -> safe.\n\n  Then we can go to (1,0) [S], (1,1) [U]\n\n  Check (1,0): safe (y=0)\n  Check (1,1): freeway1 at time1 -> dangerous_times[1] has {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> 1 not in, so safe.\n\n  Then from (0,0): we have two options: S and U.\n\n  We want minimal time, so we prefer to go up. But we do BFS so we consider all.\n\n  We'll expand in increasing time.\n\n  Time0: only (0,0)\n\n  Time1: \n        (1,0): by S -> path0 = ['S']\n        (1,1): by U -> path1 = ['U']\n\n  Time2:\n        From (1,0):\n            S -> (2,0) -> safe\n            U -> (2,1) -> freeway1 at time2: 2 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> safe\n            D -> (2,-1) -> clamp to 0 -> (2,0) -> same as S? \n        But note: from (1,0): \n            S: (2,0)\n            U: (2,1)\n            D: (2,0)   [clamped]\n\n        So we get (2,0) and (2,1)\n\n        From (1,1):\n            S: (2,1) -> already generated? \n            U: (2,2) -> freeway2 at time2: safe (freeway2 always safe)\n            D: (2,0) -> already generated\n\n        So new states: (2,2)\n\n  Time3:\n        (2,0): \n            S: (3,0)\n            U: (3,1) -> freeway1 at time3: dangerous! 3 is in {3,4,5,...} -> unsafe -> skip\n            D: (3,0) -> same as S\n        So (3,0) by S or D.\n\n        (2,1):\n            S: (3,1) -> unsafe (time3, freeway1) -> skip\n            U: (3,2) -> freeway2: safe -> (3,2)\n            D: (3,0) -> already generated above.\n\n        (2,2):\n            S: (3,2) -> already generated by (2,1) with U? \n            U: (3,3) -> freeway3 at time3: dangerous_times[3] = {12,13,14} -> 3 not in -> safe -> (3,3)\n            D: (3,1) -> unsafe\n\n        So new states: (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n  Time4:\n        (3,0): \n            S: (4,0)\n            U: (4,1) -> freeway1 at time4: dangerous (4 in set) -> skip\n            D: (4,0) -> same as S\n            -> (4,0)\n\n        (3,2):\n            S: (4,2) -> freeway2: safe -> (4,2)\n            U: (4,3) -> freeway3: time4 -> 4 not in {12,13,14} -> safe -> (4,3)\n            D: (4,1) -> unsafe -> skip\n\n        (3,3):\n            S: (4,3) -> already generated\n            U: (4,4) -> freeway4 at time4: dangerous (4 in {3,4,5,12,13,14}) -> skip\n            D: (4,2) -> already generated\n\n        So new states: (4,0), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n  Time5:\n        (4,0):\n            S: (5,0)\n            U: (5,1) -> unsafe (5 in freeway1) -> skip\n            D: (5,0) -> same\n            -> (5,0)\n\n        (4,2):\n            S: (5,2) -> safe (freeway2) -> (5,2)\n            U: (5,3) -> freeway3: time5 -> 5 not in {12,13,14} -> safe -> (5,3)\n            D: (5,1) -> unsafe -> skip\n\n        (4,3):\n            S: (5,3) -> already generated\n            U: (5,4) -> freeway4: time5 -> 5 in {3,4,5,...} -> unsafe -> skip\n            D: (5,2) -> already generated\n\n        So new states: (5,0), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n  Time6:\n        (5,0):\n            S: (6,0)\n            U: (6,1) -> freeway1: time6 -> safe (6 not in) -> (6,1)\n            D: (6,0) -> same as S\n\n        (5,2):\n            S: (6,2) -> safe -> (6,2)\n            U: (6,3) -> freeway3: safe -> (6,3)\n            D: (6,1) -> freeway1: safe -> (6,1)\n\n        (5,3):\n            S: (6,3) -> already generated\n            U: (6,4) -> freeway4: time6 -> safe (6 not in) -> (6,4)\n            D: (6,2) -> already generated\n\n        So new states: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\n  Time7:\n        (6,0): -> (7,0) by S, (7,1) by U, (7,0) by D -> so (7,0) and (7,1)\n        (6,1): -> (7,1) by S -> duplicate, (7,2) by U -> freeway2: safe -> (7,2), (7,0) by D -> duplicate\n        (6,2): -> (7,2) by S -> duplicate, (7,3) by U -> freeway3: safe -> (7,3), (7,1) by D -> duplicate\n        (6,3): -> (7,3) by S -> duplicate, (7,4) by U -> freeway4: safe (7 not in) -> (7,4), (7,2) by D -> duplicate\n        (6,4): -> (7,4) by S -> duplicate, (7,5) by U -> freeway5: safe (7 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}) -> (7,5), (7,3) by D -> duplicate\n\n        So new states: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\n  Time8:\n        Similarly, we can go up to (8,6) etc.\n\n        But we want to get to (8,9) as soon as possible? \n\n        However, we are at time7 and the highest y we have is 5. We need to get to 9.\n\n        We are at (7,5): \n            U: (8,6) -> freeway6: at time8 -> 8 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> safe -> (8,6)\n\n        But we are not at 9.\n\n  We continue.\n\n  Time8: we have states up to y=6.\n\n  Time9: \n        (8,6): \n            U: (9,7) -> freeway7: time9 -> 9 not in {12,13,14} -> safe -> (9,7)\n\n        Still not 9.\n\n  Time10:\n        (9,7): \n            U: (10,8) -> freeway8: time10 -> 10 not in {12,13,14} -> safe -> (10,8)\n\n  Time11:\n        (10,8): \n            U: (11,9) -> we reached (11,9) -> stop.\n\n        So we found a state (11,9).\n\n        How did we get there? We need to track the path.\n\n        We started at (0,0) and then:\n\n          We need to reconstruct.\n\n        Alternatively, we can note the minimal time we found is 11.\n\n        But is there a faster way?\n\n        We were going up as much as possible? But at time3, we had to avoid freeway1 and freeway4? \n\n        Actually, we could have gone faster? \n\n        Without obstacles: we can be at (8,8) at time8 and then at time9 at (9,9). But at time8, we are at (8,8) and then we do U to go to (9,9). But then we are at (9,9) at time9. But we want to be at 9 at time9? Then we output an action for turn9. So total time 10.\n\n        But with obstacles, we were blocked at the beginning.\n\n        How to get faster? \n\n        We tried to go up as much as possible, but at time3 we were blocked at freeway1 and freeway4. So we had to wait or go down? \n\n        But at time0: we did U -> (1,1)\n        time1: U -> (2,2)\n        time2: U -> (3,3) -> but at time3, freeway3 is safe? yes, because freeway3 dangerous times are 12,13,14. So we can be at freeway3 at time3.\n\n        However, at time3 we were at (3,3) and then we did U? -> but freeway4 at time3: dangerous? freeway4 at time3: 3 in {3,4,5,...} -> dangerous. So we cannot do U to (4) at time3.\n\n        So at time3, we are at (3,3). We cannot go up to 4 (dangerous). We can only stay at 3 or go down to 2.\n\n        If we stay at 3: then at time4 we are at (4,3) -> then freeway3 at time4: safe. Then at time4, we can go up to 4? but freeway4 at time4: 4 in dangerous -> cannot.\n\n        Or at time3, we go down to 2: \n            time3: from (3,3) do D -> (4,2) -> freeway2 at time4: safe.\n\n        Then at time4: we are at (4,2). Then we can go up to (5,3) -> freeway3 at time5: safe (5 not in {12,13,14}) -> safe.\n        Then time5: (5,3) -> then we can go up to (6,4) -> freeway4 at time6: safe (6 not in the set) -> safe.\n\n        Then we are at (6,4) at time6 -> then we can go up each turn: \n            time6: U -> (7,5)\n            time7: U -> (8,6)\n            time8: U -> (9,7)\n            time9: U -> (10,8)\n            time10: U -> (11,9)\n\n        Same as before.\n\n        Alternatively, from (3,3) at time3, we do S -> (4,3) -> dangerous? freeway3 at time4: safe. But then at time4 we are at (4,3). Then we do U: (5,4) -> freeway4 at time5: dangerous (5 in set) -> not allowed.\n\n        Or we do D: (4,2) as above.\n\n        So we cannot avoid the detour.\n\n        But wait, can we go faster by waiting at some safe spot? \n\n        For example, at time0: we do U -> (1,1) at time1.\n        time1: we do U -> (2,2) at time2.\n        time2: we do U -> (3,3) at time3. (safe)\n        time3: we cannot go up to 4 (dangerous), so we do D -> (4,2) at time4. (freeway2 safe)\n        time4: we do U -> (5,3) at time5. (freeway3 safe)\n        time5: we do U -> (6,4) at time6. (freeway4 safe: 6 not in)\n        time6: U -> (7,5) at time7.\n        time7: U -> (8,6) at time8.\n        time8: U -> (9,7) at time9.\n        time9: U -> (10,8) at time10.\n        time10: U -> (11,9) at time11.\n\n        But we are at (11,9) at time11.\n\n        Alternatively, at time0 we do S to wait? \n\n        time0: S -> (1,0)\n        time1: U -> (2,1) -> freeway1 safe at time2? 2 not in -> safe.\n        time2: U -> (3,2) -> freeway2 safe.\n        time3: U -> (4,3) -> freeway3 safe? 3 not in freeway3's dangerous set -> safe, but freeway4? no, freeway4 is for y=4. We are at y=3 at time3. Then we do U: \n              time4: we would be at (4,4) -> freeway4 at time4: 4 in dangerous -> unsafe.\n\n        So we cannot go up at time3.\n\n        Alternatively, at time3: we are at (3,2). We can do:\n            S: (4,2) -> safe (freeway2)\n            U: (4,3) -> safe (freeway3 at time4: 4 not in) -> safe.\n\n        Then at time4: we have two states: (4,2) and (4,3)\n\n        Then from (4,2):\n            time4: U -> (5,3) -> freeway3 at time5: safe -> (5,3)\n        From (4,3):\n            time4: U: (5,4) -> freeway4 at time5: dangerous -> skip\n            D: (5,2) -> freeway2 safe -> (5,2)\n\n        Then at time5: we have (5,2) and (5,3)\n\n        Then continue: \n          (5,2): \n              U: (6,3) -> freeway3 safe -> (6,3)\n          (5,3):\n              U: (6,4) -> freeway4 safe -> (6,4)\n\n        Then same as before.\n\n        So we still get to (6,3) or (6,4) at time6, then we need 5 more steps to get to 9: total time11.\n\n        But wait: at time11 we are at (11,9). Then we output 11 actions: the 11 actions that got us there (from turn0 to turn10) and then at turn11 we output 'S'. So total 12 actions? \n\n        But wait: the state (11,9) is reached at time11. The actions that got us there are the actions from turn0 to turn10 (11 actions) because:\n            action at turn0 leads to time1, ... action at turn10 leads to time11.\n\n        Then we add an action at turn11: 'S'. So total 12 actions? \n\n        However, the minimal T is 11? But we are at (11,9) at time11, so we need to output 12 actions? \n\n        But the goal is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11, and then we take an action at turn11. So the total number of actions is 12.\n\n        But we want minimal H, which is the number of turns (actions). So H=12.\n\n        However, without obstacles we did 9 actions. And we found a path that takes 11 actions to get to (11,9) and then one more action: total 12.\n\n        But we might be able to be at (10,9) or even (9,9).\n\n        How to get to 9 faster?\n\n        We see that after time5, we are at y=3 or 4. We need to go up 5 or 6 more. So the earliest we can be at 9 is time10: \n            time5: y=3 -> then 6 ups: time6:4, time7:5, time8:6, time9:7, time10:8 -> then we need one more to 9 at time11: (11,9)\n\n        Or if we can be at y=4 at time5: \n            time5: y=4 -> time6:5, time7:6, time8:7, time9:8, time10:9 -> then at time10 we are at (10,9).\n\n        How to get to y=4 at time5? \n\n          time0: y0=0 -> action: U: time1:1\n          time1: U: time2:2\n          time2: U: time3:3\n          time3: we cannot go up to 4 (dangerous). \n          time3: we can only go to 2 or stay at 3? \n          If we stay at 3: time4: y=3 -> then at time4: we can go up to 4? -> time4: freeway4 at time4: dangerous -> no.\n          If we go down to 2: time4: y=2 -> then at time4: we go up to 3: time5: y=3 -> then we are at y=3 at time5.\n\n        Alternatively, can we be at y=4 at time4? \n          Only if we were at y=3 at time3 and then go up -> but that's dangerous.\n\n        Or if we were at y=4 at time4: we would have to be at y=3 at time3 and then go up -> dangerous.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=4 at time4.\n\n        How about time5: y=4? \n          time4: we must be at y=3 or y=4 or y=5? \n          To get to y=4 at time5, we must be at y=4 at time4 and do S, or at y=3 and do U, or at y=5 and do D.\n\n          But at time4: \n             if we are at y=3: then U: y=4 -> but freeway4 at time4 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n             if we are at y=4: then we cannot be there because we couldn't get there at time4.\n             if we are at y=5: how? \n                 time3: we must have been at y=4 or y=5 or y=6. \n                 But we were at most y=3 at time3.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=4 at time5.\n\n        Therefore, the earliest we can be at y=9 is time10: \n            We need at least 9 moves up. We start at 0. \n            We have to wait or detour for the dangerous times at freeways 1 and 4.\n\n            The dangerous times for freeway1: times3,4,5 -> we cannot be on freeway1 at those times.\n            freeway4: times3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\n            We are not on freeway1 at time3,4,5: that's why we didn't go to y=1 at those times.\n\n            But we were on freeway4 only if we are at y=4 at time in {3,4,5,12,13,14}. We avoided being at y=4 at time3,4,5.\n\n            How to get 9 ups? \n                We need 9 U actions.\n\n            The minimal time is at least 9 (if no waiting) but we had to avoid freeway4 at times3,4,5. \n\n            One idea: can we go up to y=4 after time5? \n\n            For example, at time5, we are at y=3. Then we do:\n                time5: U -> y=4 at time6 -> freeway4 at time6: safe (6 not in) -> safe.\n                time6: U -> y=5 at time7 -> freeway5 at time7: safe.\n                time7: U -> y=6 at time8 -> safe.\n                time8: U -> y=7 at time9 -> safe.\n                time9: U -> y=8 at time10 -> safe.\n                time10: U -> y=9 at time11.\n\n            So we are at (11,9) at time11.\n\n            But then H=12.\n\n        However, we might use a down move to bypass and then go up faster? \n\n        Or wait at a safe spot for the dangerous times to pass.\n\n        For example, wait at y=0 until time6? \n\n          time0: S (0->0) at time1: (1,0)\n          time1: S -> (2,0)\n          time2: S -> (3,0)\n          time3: S -> (4,0)\n          time4: S -> (5,0)\n          time5: S -> (6,0)\n          time6: U -> (7,1) -> freeway1 at time7: safe (7 not in) -> safe.\n          then we can go up: \n             time7: U-> (8,2)\n             time8: U-> (9,3)\n             time9: U-> (10,4) -> freeway4 at time10: safe (10 not in) -> safe.\n             time10: U-> (11,5)\n             time11: U-> (12,6)\n             time12: U-> (13,7) -> freeway7 at time13: dangerous! (13 in {12,13,14}) -> unsafe.\n\n        We have to avoid freeway7 at times12,13,14.\n\n        So at time12, we are at (12,6) -> then we cannot go up to 7 at time13? \n             time12: we are at (12,6): \n                 U: (13,7) -> dangerous -> skip\n                 S: (13,6) -> freeway6 at time13: dangerous? freeway6: {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> 13 in -> dangerous -> skip\n                 D: (13,5) -> freeway5 at time13: dangerous (13 in) -> skip\n\n        So we are stuck at time12? \n\n        Therefore, we must not be at freeway5,6,7,8 at times12,13,14.\n\n        So we must be at y=0 or 9 at those times, or at freeway2 (which is always safe) but freeway2 is y=2.\n\n        How to get to y=2 at time12? \n            We are at time6: y=0 -> then we need 6 steps to get to y=2? \n                time6:0 -> time7:1, time8:2 -> then we can stay at 2 for the rest? \n            Then at time12: we are at (12,2) -> safe.\n\n            Then after time12: at time13,14 we can move up.\n\n            But we want to get to 9 eventually.\n\n        This might be slower.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to be at y=9 by time11. We have a path that gets to (11,9) in 11 steps (with 9 ups and 1 down and 1 up? total 11 actions? but we had 11 actions to get to (11,9)).\n\n        But then we add one more action: so total 12.\n\n        However, we found a path that lands at (11,9) in 11 steps: \n            actions: \n                turn0: U\n                turn1: U\n                turn2: U\n                turn3: D   (to avoid freeway4 at time4)\n                turn4: U   (back to 3)\n                turn5: U   (to 4 at time6)\n                turn6: U\n                turn7: U\n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U   -> lands at (11,9)\n\n        Then at turn11: we do S.\n\n        So the full sequence: 12 actions.\n\n        But is there a path with 11 actions total? \n\n        That would require being at (10,9) at time10. \n\n        How to get to y=9 at time10? \n            We need to have taken 9 ups and 1 other move (because we did one down) so we are one short? \n\n        Alternatively, we might avoid the down by waiting in a safe spot.\n\n        For example, at time3: instead of going down, can we wait at y=3? \n            time3: at (3,3) -> safe (freeway3 safe at time3) -> then we do S: (4,3) -> freeway3 at time4: safe? 4 not in freeway3's set -> safe.\n            then at time4: we are at (4,3). We want to go to (5,4) at time5: but freeway4 at time5: dangerous -> not allowed.\n            then we do S again: (5,3) -> freeway3 at time5: safe.\n            then at time5: we do U: (6,4) -> freeway4 at time6: safe.\n            then we are at time6: y=4 -> then we need 5 more U: time11: y=9.\n\n            This also takes 11 actions to get to (11,9) -> then add one more: total 12.\n\n        Or at time3: we do D to (4,2) -> then at time4: we do not use U to go to 3? we can do S at time4: (5,2) -> then at time5: we do U to (6,3) -> then we are at time6: y=3 -> then 6 more U: time12: y=9 -> then we are at (12,9) -> then add one more action: total 13.\n\n        So the fastest is 12 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we output the sequence of 12 actions.\n\n        The actions that got us to (11,9) in the first path: \n            turn0: U\n            turn1: U\n            turn2: U\n            turn3: D\n            turn4: U\n            turn5: U\n            turn6: U\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: U\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U   -> this brings us to (11,9)\n\n        Then turn11: S\n\n        But we must check safety along the way:\n\n          Time0: (0,0) -> safe (y=0)\n          a0=U -> to (1,1)\n          Time1: (1,1) -> freeway1 at time1: safe? 1 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> safe.\n          a1=U -> to (2,2)\n          Time2: (2,2) -> freeway2: always safe -> safe.\n          a2=U -> to (3,3)\n          Time3: (3,3) -> freeway3: time3 not in {12,13,14} -> safe.\n          a3=D -> to (4,2)\n          Time4: (4,2) -> freeway2: safe.\n          a4=U -> to (5,3)\n          Time5: (5,3) -> freeway3: time5 not in {12,13,14} -> safe.\n          a5=U -> to (6,4)\n          Time6: (6,4) -> freeway4: time6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}? 6 is not -> safe.\n          a6=U -> to (7,5)\n          Time7: (7,5) -> freeway5: time7 not in -> safe.\n          a7=U -> to (8,6)\n          Time8: (8,6) -> freeway6: time8 not in -> safe.\n          a8=U -> to (9,7)\n          Time9: (9,7) -> freeway7: time9 not in {12,13,14} -> safe.\n          a9=U -> to (10,8)\n          Time10: (10,8) -> freeway8: time10 not in {12,13,14} -> safe.\n          a10=U -> to (11,9) -> safe (y=9)\n\n          Then at turn11: we do S, but we don't care about the next state.\n\n        So the sequence is:\n\n          Turn0: U\n          Turn1: U\n          Turn2: U\n          Turn3: D\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: S\n\n        Total 12 actions.\n\n        But is there a sequence with 11 actions total? \n\n        We would need to be at (10,9) at time10. \n\n        How to get to y=9 at time10? \n            We start at y0=0.\n            We have 10 actions: turns0 to 9, and then at turn10 we would be at y10=9.\n\n            That means we have to do 9 net up moves and one extra move that cancels out? \n\n            But the extra move could be a down and then an up? but that would require 11 actions to get 9 net up moves.\n\n            Or we could do 9 ups and one down and one up? that's 11 actions but then we are at 9 at the next state? \n\n            But we want to be at 9 at time10, so after 10 actions.\n\n            Let the net up moves: we need to go from 0 to 9: net +9.\n\n            Each U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\n            So the sum of the deltas must be 9.\n\n            The number of actions is 10. \n\n            Let u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S.\n            u + d + s = 10\n            u - d = 9\n\n            Then: 2u + s = 19 -> so u = 9.5 -> not integer.\n\n            So impossible.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at y=9 at time10.\n\n        Similarly, we can only be at y=9 at an odd time? \n\n        Actually, we start at 0 (even). Each U or D changes by 1, so after even number of actions, y is integer and has the same parity as the initial? \n\n        But we start at 0 (even), and 9 is odd. After k actions, we are at state (k, y). \n            The net up moves: u - d = y - 0 = y.\n            And u+d+s = k, and u-d = y.\n            Then 2u + s = k + y.\n            Since y is 9 (odd), then k+y is odd, so k must be odd.\n\n        So the minimal k for which we can be at y=9 is k=9 (then 2u+s=9+9=18 -> u=9, s=0, d=0) but we saw we cannot because of obstacles.\n\n        Next is k=11: then 2u+s=11+9=20 -> u= (20-s)/2, so s must be even. Minimal u: if s=0, then u=10, d=1? \n            u - d = 10 - d = 9 -> d=1, and s=0, u=10.\n            So we need 10 U and 1 D.\n\n        That is possible. \n\n        So we can be at (11,9) with 11 actions? \n\n        How? \n          We do 10 U and 1 D. \n\n          We must do the down at a time when we can avoid an obstacle.\n\n          We did: U,U,U,D,U,U,U,U,U,U -> that's 10 U and 1 D: total 11 actions.\n\n          And the net: 10 - 1 = 9 -> y11 = 9.\n\n          Then we are at (11,9) at time11.\n\n          And then we do not need an extra action? \n\n        But the problem: we are at turn11: we have taken 11 actions (turns0 to 10) and we are at y11=9 at the beginning of turn11? \n\n        However, by the update, after 11 actions (turns0 to 10), we are at time11.\n\n        And then we are at (11,9) and we are about to take an action at turn11. But the problem requires the sequence for turns0 to H-1 and we are at turn H-1 at 9.\n\n        Here, if we have taken 11 actions, then H-1 = 10? because the actions are for turns0 to turn10. Then we are at turn11 at the beginning? \n\n        How many actions have we taken when we are at (11,9)? \n          We took 11 actions: at turn0, turn1, ... turn10.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at y11=9.\n\n          So we have reached the goal at turn11.\n\n          Then we must output the 11 actions for turns0 to 10.\n\n          And then we are done? \n\n          But the problem says: the sequence is for turns0 to H-1, and we are at turn H-1 at position 9.\n\n          Here, the last action in the sequence is at turn10, and then at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9.\n\n          So turn11 is not included in the action sequence? \n\n          But then we are at turn11 (which is the next turn) at position 9. The problem says: we are at turn H-1 at position 9.\n\n          So we set H-1 = 11? then H=12, and the actions are for turns0 to 11? \n\n          But we haven't taken an action at turn11.\n\n        Alternatively, if we output only the 11 actions, then we are at turn11 at position 9. So the last turn in the sequence is turn10, and then at turn11 we are at 9. So we are at turn11 at position 9, but we didn't take an action at turn11.\n\n        But the problem requires that the sequence has H actions and we are at turn t1+H-1 at position 9.\n\n          Here, t1=0, and the sequence has 11 actions: turns0 to 10. Then the last turn is turn10, so we are at turn10 at the beginning? Then after taking the action at turn10, we are at turn11 at position 9.\n\n        But we want to be at position 9 at turn10, not at turn11.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at position 9 at the beginning of turn10. Then the action at turn10 is taken when we are at 9.\n\n        So if we want to be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10, then we would output actions for turns0 to 10 (which is 11 actions), and then we are at turn10 at 9. \n\n        But then the last action (at turn10) is the one that made us arrive at 9? \n\n        How to be at (10,9)? \n          We need to be at (9,8) and then do U at turn9.\n\n        But we found a way to be at (11,9) in 11 actions (which means we did 11 actions and then at the next turn we are at 9). But we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\n        So then we must output the 11 actions for turns0 to 10, and then we are at turn11 at 9. So the turn11 is the turn at which we are at 9, and it is not included in the actions that got us there? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me reread the problem:\n\n          \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\n          Here, t1=0.\n\n          So we require y_{H-1}=9.\n\n          And the actions are for t=0 to H-1.\n\n          This means that the last action is at turn H-1.\n\n          And after taking the action at turn H-1, we have the position at turn H.\n\n          But the requirement is on y_{H-1} (before taking the action).\n\n        This is a key point.\n\n        The problem says: we are at turn t at position y_t. Then we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\n        We require that at turn t = t1+H-1, we are at y_{t} = 9.\n\n        This means that at the beginning of turn H-1 (0-indexed), we are at 9.\n\n        Then we take an action a_{H-1} at turn H-1, and then we are at y_{H} (which can be 8,9, or 10 clamped to 9).\n\n        So the last action is taken when we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, we do not require to be at 9 at the next turn.\n\n        In our simulation, we want to find a state (T,9) for some T, and then we output the actions for turns0 to T (which are T+1 actions) and then we are at turn T+1 at some position, but we don't care.\n\n        But the requirement is that at turn T, we are at 9. The actions we output include the action at turn T.\n\n        So in the state (T,9), we then choose an action a_T. The action a_T is part of the sequence.\n\n        Therefore, we do not need to add an extra action. \n\n        We stop as soon as we are at (T,9) for any T, and then the actions we took to get to (T,9) are the actions for turns0 to T-1, and then the action at turn T is the next one we choose arbitrarily (but safely) and then we output the sequence up to turn T.\n\n        However, at state (T,9), we are at the beginning of turn T. We then take an action a_T. We must ensure that if we are at (T,9) and we choose a_T, then we are safe at (T,9) (which we are) and then we move to (T+1, y_{T+1}), but we don't care.\n\n        So the total number of actions is T+1.\n\n        The minimal T such that we can be at (T,9) and then we choose a_T.\n\n        But note: the action a_T is not used to get to (T,9), it is taken while at (T,9).\n\n        Therefore, in our BFS, we do not need to wait until we reach (T,9) to add an action. We can consider that we can output the action at turn T as soon as we are at (T,9).\n\n        In the BFS, when we are at (T,9), we can stop and output the actions that got us to (T,9) (for turns0 to T-1) and then for turn T we choose 'S' (or any).\n\n        But then the total actions is T+1.\n\n        However, we might be able to reach (T,9) for T=8: \n\n            at turn8: we are at (8,9) -> then we output the actions for turns0 to 7 and then at turn8 we output 'S'. \n\n        How to get to (8,9)? \n            We need to be at (7,8) and then do U.\n\n        But is (7,8) safe? freeway8 at time7: safe (7 not in {12,13,14}) -> safe.\n\n        So if we can get to (7,8) in 7 actions, then we do U at turn7: then we are at (8,9) at turn8.\n\n        Then we output actions for turns0 to 7 (8 actions) and then at turn8: 'S'. Total 9 actions.\n\n        But is that possible? \n            We need to get to (7,8) in 7 actions.\n\n        That means we need 8 net up moves in 7 actions? \n            u - d = 8\n            u + d + s = 7\n            2u + s = 15 -> u = 7.5 -> not integer.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at (7,8) at time7.\n\n        Next: T=9: \n            to be at (9,9): \n                then we need to be at (8,8) or (8,9) or (8,10) -> but then a8 would move to 9, but we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn9.\n\n            to be at (9,9) at the beginning of turn9, we must have been at 9 at turn8? and then we took an action at turn8 that left us at 9? \n                if we were at 9 at turn8, and we took S, then we are at 9 at turn9.\n                if we were at 8 at turn8, and we took U, then we are at 9 at turn9.\n\n        So if we can be at (8,8) in 8 actions, then we do U at turn8: and then we are at (9,9) at turn9.\n\n        Then we output actions for turns0 to 8 (9 actions) and then we are done. \n            actions: 8 ups to get to (8,8) and then one U at turn8.\n\n            total 9 actions.\n\n        But is it safe to be at (8,8) at turn8? \n            freeway8 at time8: 8 not in {12,13,14} -> safe.\n\n        Now, can we get to (8,8) in 8 actions with 8 net up moves? \n            We need 8 ups in 8 actions: then s=0, d=0, u=8.\n\n        So we do 8 ups.\n\n        Check safety:\n\n            turn0: (0,0) -> a0=U -> (1,1)\n            turn1: (1,1) -> a1=U -> (2,2) [freeway1 at time1: safe]\n            turn2: (2,2) -> a2=U -> (3,3) [freeway2 safe, freeway3 at time3: safe (3 not in)]\n            turn3: (3,3) -> a3=U -> would go to (4,4) but freeway4 at time4? \n                    at turn3: we are at (3,3), then a3=U -> at time4 we are at (4,4) -> freeway4 at time4: 4 in {3,4,5,12,13,14} -> dangerous! -> collide.\n\n        So we cannot do that.\n\n        We can try to avoid freeway4 at time4.\n\n        How about at time3: we do not go to 4, but wait or go down? \n\n        But if we do not do a U at time3, then we won't have 8 ups.\n\n        So we must do 8 ups, so we must do U at every step.\n\n        Therefore, we collide.\n\n        Next: T=10: \n            to be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10.\n            we must be at (9,8) or (9,9) or (9,10) at turn9, and then an action brings us to 9 at turn10? \n            but we want to be at 9 at turn10 (the beginning) -> so we are at 9 at the beginning of turn10.\n\n            How to get to (10,9)? \n                if we are at (9,9) and do S, then (10,9)\n                or at (9,8) and do U, then (10,9)\n\n            The easiest: get to (9,8) and then do U.\n\n            then we need to be at (9,8) in 9 actions.\n\n            net: from 0 to 8 in 9 actions: \n                u - d = 8\n                u + d + s = 9\n                2u + s = 17 -> u = 8.5 -> not integer.\n\n            or to (9,9) in 9 actions: net 9 in 9 actions: u=9, d=0, s=0.\n\n        So we try to get to (9,9) in 9 actions with 9 ups.\n\n        Check safety for the state (9,9) at turn9: \n            we are at y=9, so safe.\n\n        But how to get there? \n            We need to pass through intermediate steps.\n\n        Steps with 9 ups in 9 actions:\n\n          turn0: U: (1,1) [safe]\n          turn1: U: (2,2) [safe]\n          turn2: U: (3,3) [safe]\n          turn3: U: (4,4) -> at time4: freeway4 at time4: dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal T is 11: we are at (11,9) at turn11.\n\n        Then we output 11 actions: the actions that got us to (11,9) are for turns0 to 10.\n\n        The action at turn10 is the last in the sequence.\n\n        Then we are at turn11 at the beginning at 9.\n\n        So the sequence is the 11 actions we found earlier to get to (11,9) (without the extra S at the end).\n\n        But wait: in our B for the state (11,9), we got there by 11 actions: turns0 to 10.\n\n        Then we output those 11 actions.\n\n        And H = 11.\n\n        But the problem: the sequence has H actions, and we are at turn H-1 at 9.\n\n        Here, the sequence has 11 actions (H=11), and we are at turn 0+11-1 = turn10 at the beginning? \n\n        But we are at (11,9) at turn11.\n\n        This indicates we are not matching the requirement.\n\n        The requirement: at turn t = t1+H-1, we are at y_t = 9.\n\n        Here, t1=0, H=11, so turn = 0+11-1 = 10.\n\n        So we require y_10 = 9.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn10.\n\n        In our simulation, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\n        So we need to find a sequence such that at the beginning of turn10, we are at 9.\n\n        How to achieve that? \n            We need to be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10.\n\n        How to get to (10,9)? \n            We must have been at (9,8) and then done U at turn9, \n            or at (9,9) and then done S or U (clamped) at turn9.\n\n        net in 10 actions: \n            to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10: that means after 10 actions, we are at turn10.\n            but the position at turn10 is the result after 10 actions.\n\n            The net after 10 actions: from 0 to 9: net +9.\n\n            Let the actions be a0 to a9 (10 actions).\n\n            u - d = 9\n            u + d + s = 10\n            -> 2u + s = 19 -> u=9.5 -> impossible.\n\n        Therefore, it is impossible to be at 9 at an even turn (since 0 is even, and each action changes by integer, but 9 is odd, so the parity of the turn must be odd for the state to be at an odd y).\n\n        Specifically, at turn0: y0=0 (even)\n        after one action (turn0): y1 = 0+delta -> which is integer, and the parity: \n            if U: y1=1 (odd)\n            if D: y1=0 (even) [clamped]\n            if S: y1=0 (even)\n\n        after two actions: \n            from even: can become even or odd.\n            from odd: can become even or odd.\n\n        But we want to be at 9 (odd) at turn10 (even). \n            even + even = even? \n            the parity of the turn and the parity of the y are independent.\n\n        However, the net change is 9, which is odd. And each action changes the y by -1,0, or 1. \n            The net change after 10 actions is the sum of the changes.\n\n        The sum of an even number of integers (each in {-1,0,1}) can be odd? \n            Example: 5 times +1 and 5 times 0: sum=5, odd.\n            Or 6 times +1 and 4 times -1: 6-4=2, even.\n\n        We need the sum to be 9, which is odd.\n\n        So it is possible.\n\n        Specifically, we need an odd number of odd changes. But each non-zero change is odd. \n        The number of non-zero changes must be odd, and the sum of the signed changes must be 9.\n\n        For example, 9 ups and 1 down: then net=8, not 9.\n        or 10 ups and 1 down: net=9, but then 11 actions.\n\n        in 10 actions: \n            let u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S.\n            u + d + s = 10\n            u - d = 9\n\n            then 2u + s = 19 -> u = (19-s)/2. \n            s must be odd. Minimal s=1, then u=9, d=0: but 9+0+1=10, and net=9.\n            So we can do 9 ups and 1 stay.\n\n        Then we are at 0+9 = 9 after 10 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we can be at (10,9) if we do 9 ups and 1 stay in 10 actions.\n\n        Now, can we do that without colliding? \n\n        We need to choose when to do the stay.\n\n        The dangerous times are for freeway1 at times3,4,5; freeway4 at times3,4,5; freeway3,5,6,7,8 at times12,13,14 we don't care because we are done by then.\n\n        We want to be at turn10: so times0 to 9.\n\n        We must avoid being on freeway1 at times3,4,5; freeway4 at times3,4,5.\n\n        The plan: \n          We do 9 ups and 1 stay.\n\n          We can do the stay at a time when if we did an up we would be in danger.\n\n          For example, at time3, we are at (3,3) -> if we do U, we go to (4,4) at time4: dangerous.\n          So we do S at time3: then we are at (4,3) at time4.\n\n          Then we do U at time4: (5,4) -> freeway4 at time5: dangerous (5 in set) -> not allowed.\n\n        So we cannot do the stay at time3.\n\n        Do the stay at time4: \n          turn0: U -> (1,1)\n          turn1: U -> (2,2)\n          turn2: U -> (3,3) [safe]\n          turn3: U -> (4,4) [dangerous!] -> we cannot do this.\n\n        We must not be at (4,4) at time4.\n\n        So we have to do the stay before time3 or between the dangerous times.\n\n        How about at time2: \n          turn0: U -> (1,1)\n          turn1: U -> (2,2)\n          turn2: S -> (3,2) [ at time3: we are at (3,2) -> freeway2: safe]\n          turn3: U -> (4,3) [freeway3 at time4: safe (4 not in freeway3's set), but freeway4? we are not on freeway4. We are at y=3 at time4? \n                turn3: we are at (3,2) -> then we do U: then at time4 we are at (4,3) -> freeway4 is for y=4, but we are at y=3 -> safe.\n          turn4: U -> (5,4) -> freeway4 at time5: dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n        How about at time5: \n          turn0: U\n          turn1: U\n          turn2: U\n          turn3: we cannot do U because we would be at (4,4) at time4: dangerous.\n          turn3: we do something else? \n               option1: S -> (4,3) [ then at time4: (4,3) -> freeway3 at time4: safe]\n               turn4: U -> (5,4) -> freeway4 at time5: dangerous -> not allowed.\n          option2: D -> (4,2) [ then at time4: (4,2) -> safe]\n\n          turn4: from (4,2): U -> (5,3) [freeway3 at time5: safe]\n          turn5: we do S -> (6,3) [ because if we do U, we go to (6,4) -> freeway4 at time6: safe]\n          then we can do the remaining ups: \n               turn6: U -> (7,4) -> freeway4 at time7: safe\n               turn7: U -> (8,5)\n               turn8: U -> (9,6)\n               turn9: U -> (10,7)\n\n          Then we are at (10,7) at time10, not 9.\n\n        We need to do more ups.\n\n        Alternatively, we do the stay at time5: then we are at (6,4) at time6, and then we do 5 more ups: \n          turn6: U-> (7,5)\n          turn7: U-> (8,6)\n          turn8: U-> (9,7)\n          turn9: U-> (10,8) -> not 9.\n\n        We are at 8 at time10.\n\n        Then we need one more up? but we only have 9 ups and one stay.\n\n        So we are at net 8.\n\n        Therefore, we must not use a down.\n\n        How about two stays? but we are allowed only one stay.\n\n        We need exactly 9 ups and 1 stay.\n\n        Let me try to do the stay at time0: \n          turn0: S -> (1,0)\n          turn1: U -> (2,1)\n          turn2: U -> (3,2)\n          turn3: U -> (4,3) -> freeway3 at time4: safe, and freeway4?

\n            at the beginning of turn10, we are at (10,8), not 9.\n\n        So that does not satisfy.\n\n        We require that at the beginning of turn10, we are at 9.\n\n        So we must be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10.\n\n        then the action at turn10 is taken when we are at 9.\n\n        So in the sequence, the \n          action at turn0 to turn9: 10 actions, and we are at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10.\n          then we take an action at turn10.\n\n        Therefore, we need to be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10, and then we output the 10 actions for turns0 to 9, and then one more for turn10? \n\n        But then H=11.\n\n        To be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10, we need to have done net 9 in 10 actions: which is possible with 10 ups and 0 down and 0 stay? -> net 10, too much.\n        or 9 ups and 1 stay: net 9.\n\n        But we couldn't find a safe path for that.\n\n        So the only possibility is to do 9 ups and 2 extras (like 1 down and 1 up, but net 9) in 11 actions: \n            u - d = 9\n            u + d + s = 11\n            for example, u=10, d=1, s=0 -> net 9.\n\n        then we are at (11,9) at the beginning of turn11.\n\n        and we output 11 actions: for turns0 to 10.\n\n        and H=11.\n\n        then turn10 is the last in the sequence, and we are at turn10 at the beginning at position (10, something), and after the action at turn10, we are at (11,9) for turn11.\n\n        but the requirement is that at turn H-1 = 10, we are at 9.\n\n        so we must be at (10,9) at the beginning of turn10.\n\n        we are not.\n\n        Therefore, we must output a sequence of 12 actions that gets us to (12,9) at the beginning of turn12, and then we are at turn11 at the beginning at 9? \n          at the beginning of turn11, we are at (11,9) -> then we take an action at turn11.\n\n        but the requirement is to be at 9 at turn H-1 = 11, so we output actions for turns0 to 11.\n\n        and we are at (11,9) at the beginning of turn11, and then we take an action at turn11.\n\n        so the sequence has 12 actions.\n\n        and we have a path to (11,9) in 11 actions ( turns0 to 10) and then we\n        are at (11,9) at the beginning of turn11, and then we output the action for turn11: 'S'.\n\n        so in the sequence, the first 11 actions are the ones that got us to (11,9), and the 12th action is 'S'.\n\n        then we are at (12,9) or (12,8) or (12,10) -> but we don't care.\n\n        and at turn11 ( which is the last in the sequence, turn index 11), we are at the beginning of turn11 at 9.\n\n        so it satisfies: at turn t1+H-1 = 0+12-1 = 11, we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, we use the path we found and add one 'S' at the end.\n\n        So the final answer is 12 actions.\n\n        The sequence as above.\n\n        So we return.\n\n        Turn0: U\n        Turn1: U\n        Turn2: U\n        Turn3: D\n        Turn4: U\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: U\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: S\n\n        Total 12 actions.\n\n        And we are at turn11 ( which is the last action's turn) at position 9 at the beginning.\n\n        Then we take the action 'S' at turn11.\n\n        This meets the requirement.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\n        We output the 12 actions.\n\n        Note: we could try to find a path with H=12 that is different, but we have one that works.\n\n        So the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is 12. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, move up (U) to position \\((0, 1)\\).\n- At turn 1, move up (U) to position \\((0, 2)\\).\n- At turn 2, move up (U) to position \\((0, 3)\\).\n- At turn 3, move down (D) to avoid a collision on freeway 4 at turn 4, resulting in position \\((0, 2)\\).\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to position \\((0, 3)\\).\n- At turn 5, move up (U) to position \\((0, 4)\\).\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\).\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\).\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\).\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\).\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\).\n- At turn 11, stay (S) to remain at position \\((0, 9)\\), as the goal is achieved at the beginning of turn 11.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 11 (since \\(H = 12\\) and \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\)), and no collisions occur with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) during the journey. The actions avoid dangerous times on the freeways, such as freeways 1 and 4 during turns 3–5, and freeways 3, 7, and 8 during turns 12–14 (which are not encountered here).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 0: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each moving right with various speeds and positions. Since all cars are moving right, their positions at time T are given by shifting from the initial time t1=2.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at any given turn after t1. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new freeway, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn, so for collision, at turn T, you check the freeway you're currently on, y_T.\n\nThe player position at turn t is y_t, and actions are taken at each turn to change y.\n\nStart at turn t1=2, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. But the player starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2, I think? The grid has vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars. y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so if you're on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut the player is at (0,2), which means x=0, y=2, so on freeway y=2, which has cars.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (0,9), which is x=0, y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, it's safe.\n\nNow, the minimal H should be the number of turns to go from y=2 to y=9, which is 7 steps up if I only go up, but I have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I'm starting at y=2 and going to y=9, I probably only need U and S, no D, but S might be useful to wait if there's a car blocking.\n\nFirst, I need to find out for each freeway y=1 to 8, when is it safe to be there, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, and the span is defined, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns the position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nCollision if for the freeway I'm on at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nFor each freeway, I need the times when a car covers x=0.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t1=2.\n\nFor any future turn T (T >=2), I need to know for each freeway k, whether x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf it is covered, then if I am on that freeway at turn T, I collide.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThe player can choose to move or stay to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied at x=0.\n\nSince I start at y=2 at turn 2, I need to move up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of U actions is 7, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps. But I might need to wait sometimes, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I might be able to go straight up without waiting if the freeways are clear at the right times.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, head is left, tail right? But all are right-moving, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head, I think.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since it's moving right, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: first car: (-40,-51,right,4). -40 and -51, but -40 > -51? -40 is greater than -51, so if τ = -51, h = -40, then since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-51, -40]? But -51 to -40, that's from left to right, so x from -51 to -40.\n\nBut in the text it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so τ < h.\n\nBut here for first car: (-40, -51), but -40 > -51, so if τ = -40 and h = -51? That would be τ > h, which doesn't make sense for [τ,h] if τ is left.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in notation.\n\nLook back: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nHead and tail: I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor right-moving car, head is on the right, tail on the left.\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, position: tail at τ, head at h, with τ < h, span [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head on left, tail on right, span [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, so for each, τ should be less than h.\n\nBut in the data, for freeway 1, first car: (-40, -51, right, 4). -40 and -51, -40 is greater than -51, so if τ = -40, h = -51, then τ > h, which is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, or I misread.\n\nLet's see the values: -40 and -51, -51 is smaller, so tail should be -51, head -40, so τ = -51, h = -40.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-4, -15, right,4), -4 > -15, so τ = -15, h = -4? No.\n\n-15 is smaller, so τ = -15, h = -4.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed)? Or (tail, head, ...)?\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo it's head first, then tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail.\n\nBut in first car: head = -40, tail = -51? -40 > -51, so head is larger, yes, for right-moving, head on right, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head = -4, tail = -15? -4 > -15, yes.\n\nBut -4 > -15, so tail is -15, head is -4.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSo for first car: τ = -51, h = -40, so at t1=2, span = [-51, -40]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head = -4, tail = -15? Tail is given as τ, so τ = tail = -15? Head h = -4, tail τ = -15, so τ = -15, h = -4, span [ -15, -4 ]\n\nBut in the table it says (-4, -15, right,4), which is (h, τ) or (τ, h)? It says \"head h, tail τ\", so (h, τ) = (-4, -15)\n\nSo for span, it's [τ, h] = [-15, -4]\n\nSimilarly, third car: (32, 21, right,4), head=32, tail=21? 32>21, so τ=21, h=32, span [21,32]\n\nBut 21 to 32, which is fine.\n\nNow for freeway 1 at t1: cars with spans: [ -51, -40 ], [ -15, -4 ], [21,32]\n\nAll with speed 4, right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut let's list all freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (h,tau,d,s) = (-40,-51,right,4), but since (head,tail), and head=-40, tail=-51, so tau=tail=-51, h=head=-40, span at t1: [tau, h] = [-51, -40]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-4,-15,right,4), head=-4, tail=-15, so tau=-15, h=-4, span [-15, -4]\n\nThird car: (32,21,right,4), head=32, tail=21, tau=21, h=32, span [21,32]\n\nAll speed 4.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (-48,-59,right,12) so head=-48, tail=-59, tau=-59, h=-48, span [-59,-48], speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-40,-51,right,4) same as above, tau=-51, h=-40, span [-51,-40], speed 4.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: same as freeway 1: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4) so spans [-51,-40], [-15,-4], [21,32]\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 1 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 1,4,5.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-40,-51,right,4) span [-51,-40], speed 4.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-40,-51,right,4) span [-51,-40], speed 4.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one with different speed, freeway 3 has one, freeway 4,5,6 have three, freeway 7 and 8 have one each.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered at time T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time T, is 0 in some car's span at T.\n\nSpan at T for a car: since all right-moving, for a car with span at t1 [τ, h], at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nt1=2.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1 = T - 2, so for time T, Δt = T-2.\n\nThen span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 is covered if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt for some car.\n\nSince the car spans are intervals, I need to find if 0 is in [left, right] for some car at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: three cars.\n\nCar A: τ=-51, h=-40, s=4\n\nCar B: τ=-15, h=-4, s=4\n\nCar C: τ=21, h=32, s=4\n\nAt time T, with Δt = T-2\n\nCar A: left = -51 + 4Δt, right = -40 + 4Δt\n\n0 covered if -51 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -40 + 4Δt\n\nWhich is -51 + 4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -40 + 4Δt\n\nSo 4Δt <= 51 and 4Δt >= 40\n\nΔt <= 51/4 = 12.75\n\nΔt >= 40/4 = 10\n\nSo for Δt from 10 to 12.75, 0 is covered by car A.\n\nSince Δt integer? Turns are discrete, I assume T integer, so Δt integer.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nThus for Δt = 10,11,12,13? Let's see.\n\nΔt >=10 and <=12.75, so since Δt integer, Δt =10,11,12\n\nFor Δt=10: left = -51+40= -11, right= -40+40=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included? <= and >=, so 0 <= right, which is 0 <=0, true; and left <=0, -11<=0 true. So yes, 0 in span.\n\nFor Δt=11: left=-51+44= -7, right=-40+44=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=12: left=-51+48= -3, right=-40+48=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=13: left=-51+52=1, right=-40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=9: left=-51+36=-15, right=-40+36=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo for car A, 0 covered at Δt=10,11,12.\n\nNow car B: τ=-15, h=-4, s=4\n\nleft = -15 + 4Δt, right = -4 + 4Δt\n\n0 covered if -15 +4Δt <=0 <= -4 +4Δt\n\nSo 4Δt <=15 and 4Δt >=4\n\nΔt <=15/4=3.75\n\nΔt >=4/4=1\n\nSo Δt=1,2,3? Δt >=1 and <=3.75, so Δt=1,2,3\n\nΔt=1: left=-15+4=-11, right=-4+4=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=2: left=-15+8=-7, right=-4+8=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=3: left=-15+12=-3, right=-4+12=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=4: left=-15+16=1, right=-4+16=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=0: left=-15, right=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo car B covers 0 at Δt=1,2,3.\n\nNow car C: τ=21, h=32, s=4\n\nleft=21+4Δt, right=32+4Δt\n\nSince both positive and increasing, for Δt>=0, left >=21>0, so 0 never in [left,right], always left>0.\n\nSo car C never covers x=0.\n\nTherefore for freeway 1, 0 covered when car A or car B covers, i.e. at Δt=1,2,3 (from B) or Δt=10,11,12 (from A)\n\nSo unsafe at T when Δt in {1,2,3,10,11,12}\n\nT = t1 + Δt = 2 + Δt, so at T=3,4,5 (Δt=1,2,3) and T=12,13,14 (Δt=10,11,12)\n\nΔt=1,2,3 → T=3,4,5\n\nΔt=10,11,12 → T=12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nleft = -59 + 12 Δt, right = -48 + 12 Δt\n\n0 covered if -59 +12Δt <=0 <= -48 +12Δt\n\nSo 12Δt <=59 and 12Δt >=48\n\nΔt <=59/12≈4.916, Δt >=48/12=4\n\nSo Δt=4,5? Δt>=4 and <=4.916, so Δt=4\n\nΔt=4: left=-59+48= -11, right=-48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: left=-59+60=1, right=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: left=-59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=4, T=2+4=6\n\nUnsafe at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car, same as car A on freeway 1: τ=-51, h=-40, s=4\n\nSo as before, 0 covered at Δt=10,11,12, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: three cars, so unsafe at same times: T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: one car, same as car A: τ=-51, h=-40, s=4, so unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times (when x=0 covered):\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: same as y=4\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nThe player starts at turn t=2, y=2.\n\nAt turn 2, y=2, and we need to check if it's safe.\n\nFor freeway y=2, unsafe only at T=6, but T=2, Δt=0.\n\nFor y=2, car span at Δt=0: left=-59, right=-48, [-59,-48], 0 not in, so safe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, other times not unsafe except T=6.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 at turn 2 to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nThe minimal number of U actions is 7, since from 2 to 9.\n\nBut I may need to wait if I would be on an unsafe freeway at some turn.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,1 per turn, the path must go through intermediate y values.\n\nI need a sequence of actions from turn 2 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=2.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, which determines y_{t+1}, but y_t is the position during turn t.\n\nStart: turn t=2, y=2, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end, and at that turn, since y=9, no car, so safe.\n\nThe position when I reach y=9, at that turn I am on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so that y_{t1 + H-1} =9.\n\nt1=2, so after H turns, at turn 2+H-1 =1+H, y=9.\n\nSet the turn index.\n\nLet me set t starting from 2.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with delta y based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision check at turn t based on y_t.\n\nWe start at t=2, y_2=2.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T, and minimize T - 2? H is the number of turns, from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so the number of actions is H, and we reach at turn 2+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn 2+1-1=2, y_2=9, but currently y_2=2, not 9, so impossible with H=1.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from y=2 to y=9, at least 7 U actions, so H >=7.\n\nWith 7 U actions, I would reach at turn 2+7 =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 2: y=2\n\nAfter action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + delta y\n\nSimilarly, after a_3, y_4, and so on.\n\nThe position y_t is set before the action at turn t.\n\nAt the start of turn t, position is (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut during turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nThen at turn t, collision check based on y_t and the cars on that row at time t.\n\nAfter action, I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nTo have y_T =9 at some turn T.\n\nStart: t=2, y_2=2.\n\nIf I do U at t=2, y_3 = 3\n\nIf U at t=3, y_4=4, and so on.\n\nAfter k U actions, y_{2+k} = 2 + k\n\nTo have y_T =9, so 2 + number of U =9, so number of U =7.\n\nThen y_{2+7} = y_9 = 2 +7 =9? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut y_{t+1} is the position for turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t=2, position y_2=2.\n\nAfter action a_2, y_3 is determined.\n\nThen at turn t=3, position y_3, and so on.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, that means y_T=9.\n\ny_T = y_2 + sum of delta y from t=2 to t=T-1? Let's see.\n\ny_2 given.\n\ny_3 = y_2 + delta y_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + delta y_3 = y_2 + delta y_2 + delta y_3\n\n...\n\ny_T = y_2 + sum_{k=2}^{T-1} delta y_k\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t\n\nSo y_T = y_2 + sum_{t=2}^{T-1} delta y_t\n\nSet y_T =9, y_2=2, so 9 = 2 + sum_{t=2}^{T-1} delta y_t\n\nThus sum_{t=2}^{T-1} delta y_t = 7\n\nEach delta y_t is -1,0, or 1.\n\nThe number of U actions must be 7 more than D actions, and S actions add nothing.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, from t=2 to t=T-1 inclusive.\n\nThe actions are from t=2 to t=T-1, which is T-2 actions? Time points: actions at t=2,3,4,..., up to t=T-1, which sets y_T.\n\ny_T is determined by actions from t=2 to t=T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=T-1, that's (T-1) - 2 +1 = T-2 actions.\n\nFor example, to go from t=2 to t=3, one action at t=2.\n\nTo go from t=2 to t=4, actions at t=2 and t=3.\n\nGenerally, to reach y_T, we need actions from t=2 to t=T-1, number of actions is (T-1) - 2 +1 = T-2? Indices from 2 to T-1 inclusive, number is (T-1) - 2 +1 = T-2.\n\nBut each action contributes to the sum.\n\ny_T = y_2 + sum_{t=2}^{T-1} delta y_t\n\ny_2 =2, y_T=9, so sum_{t=2}^{T-1} delta y_t =7\n\nEach delta y_t = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S.\n\nThe minimal T is when we have all U, no S or D, so 7 U actions, then sum =7, with T-2 =7 actions, so T-2=7, T=9.\n\nWith actions at t=2 to t=8, 7 actions, all U, then y_2=2, after a_2=U, y_3=3; a_3=U, y_4=4; ... a_8=U, y_9=9.\n\nSo at turn T=9, y_9=9, safe.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from t1 to the end turn.\n\nt1=2, end at turn T=9, so the turns are from t=2 to t=9, that's 8 turns? But we need the sequence of actions for the turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=2 to t=8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t=2 with y_2.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1=2, actions a_2 to a_{2+H-1}, and y_{2+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, if all U from t=2 to t=8, that's actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8, which is 7 actions, H=7, then y_{2+7} = y_9=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in this sequence, we need to check for each turn t from 2 to 8, when we are at y_t, whether it is safe.\n\ny_t for t from 2 to 8.\n\nAt each turn t, y_t must not be on an unsafe freeway at time t.\n\ny_t is the freeway at turn t.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U:\n\nt=2: y=2, safe as we saw.\n\nt=3: y=3? After a_2=U, y_3=3, so at turn t=3, position y_3=3.\n\nNow freeway y=3, at time t=3.\n\nWhat is unsafe for y=3? From above, y=3 unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nt=3, which is early, not 12-14, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=4 (since a_3=U, y_4=4)\n\nFreeway y=4, unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nT=4, which is in 3,4,5, so unsafe! At T=4, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nIn the all-up sequence:\n\n- Turn t=2: y=2, safe (not unsafe at t=2)\n\n- Turn t=3: y=3, safe (y=3 unsafe only at T=12,13,14, not 3)\n\n- Turn t=4: y=4, freeway y=4 unsafe at T=4 (since T=4 in 3,4,5)\n\nSo at turn t=4, on y=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot go directly.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y=5, freeway y=5 unsafe at T=5 (in 3,4,5)\n\nAlso unsafe.\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway y=6 unsafe at T=6? y=6 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. T=6 not in, so safe? T=6 is not in 3,4,5 or 12,13,14? 3,4,5 is for T=3,4,5, T=6 is later.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14. T=6 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7: y=7, freeway y=7 unsafe at T=12,13,14, not 7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=8, freeway y=8 unsafe at T=12,13,14, not 8, safe.\n\nThen t=9: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=4 and t=5, we have problem.\n\nSpecifically, at t=4, y=4 unsafe; t=5, y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=4 or y=5 at turns when they are unsafe.\n\nUnsafe times: y=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5\n\ny=5 same, T=3,4,5\n\nAlso y=1,4,5,6 unsafe at T=3,4,5\n\nBut y=1 is not in our path yet.\n\nNow, we start at y=2 at t=2.\n\nWe need to go up, but at t=4, if we are on y=4 or y=5, it might be unsafe.\n\nPossible actions: we can stay or even go down to avoid, but going down might not help.\n\nSince the unsafe period is only T=3,4,5 for y=4 and y=5, which is early, and later they are safe except at T=12,13,14 but that is late.\n\nT=12 is far, since we start at t=2.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly, we don't want to wait long.\n\nMinimal H is 7 if possible, but we need to avoid t=4 and t=5 on y=4 or y=5.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=4, y=4; t=5, y=5, both unsafe.\n\nWe can delay or advance the time we are on certain rows.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nStart: t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nInstead of U, do S at t=2: then y_3 = y_2 +0 =2, so at t=3, y=2.\n\nNow freeway y=2, unsafe only at T=6, not t=3, so safe.\n\nThen at t=3, we can do U: a_3=U, then y_4=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3? y_4=3, position at t=4 is y=3.\n\nFreeway y=3 unsafe only at T=12,13,14, not 4, safe.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nAt t=5, y=4, but freeway y=4 unsafe at T=5, so unsafe!\n\nStill problem.\n\nAfter staying at t=2, y=2, then at t=3, y=2 (since S), then a_3=U, y_4=3.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=4, at t=5, y=4, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nDo D at some point? But we need to go up, D might not help.\n\nPerhaps stay longer.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly to y=6 or something.\n\nBut from y=2, to go to y=6, need 4 U, but during that, we hit unsafe times.\n\nList the unsafe times for relevant rows.\n\nRows we care about: y=2 to y=8.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=6 only\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\ny=5: same as y=4\n\ny=6: same as y=4, unsafe at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, T=12,13,14 is late, since we start at t=2, if we go directly, we reach y=9 at t=9, before T=12, so we can ignore the late unsafe times for now, as long as we finish before t=12.\n\nT=12 is at Δt=10, which is far.\n\nSimilarly, T=3,4,5 is early.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4,5,6 at t=3,4,5.\n\nAlso, y=2 at t=6 is unsafe, but t=6 might be avoidable.\n\nNow, at t=2, we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to increase y.\n\nSuppose we do U at t=2: y_3=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, which is safe (not unsafe at t=3)\n\nThen at t=3, if we do U: y_4=4, at t=4, y=4, unsafe at t=4.\n\nIf at t=3, we do S: then y_4=3 (same as y_3), at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can do U: y_5=4, at t=5, y=4, but t=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nStill.\n\nIf at t=4, after staying, we are at y=3, then do U to y=4 at t=5, but at t=5, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nThe problem is being on y=4 or y=5 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5 are critical for y=4,5,6.\n\nSince y=3 is safe at t=4, and y=6 is safe at t=6, etc.\n\nPerhaps we can jump over during the unsafe period.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=2, do U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=4 at t=4, we stay at y=3 for multiple turns until after t=5.\n\nFor example, at t=3, do S: then y_4=3, so at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, do S again: y_5=3, at t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, do U: y_6=4, at t=6, y=4.\n\nNow freeway y=4, at t=6. Is it unsafe?\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14. T=6 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nStart: t=2, y=2\n\nAction a_2: since we want to stay low, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nIn this case:\n\nt=2: y=2, safe. Do S? Or U.\n\nIf we do U at t=2: a_2=U, then y_3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, safe. Now, to avoid being on y=4 at t=4 or t=5, we can stay at y=3.\n\nSo at t=3, do S: a_3=S, then y_4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, safe. Then at t=4, do S: a_4=S, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, safe. Now at t=5, do U: a_5=U, then y_6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, now freeway y=4 at t=6, not unsafe (since unsafe only 3,4,5 and 12-14), t=6 safe.\n\nThen we can go up: a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway y=5 at t=7. y=5 unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14. t=7 not in, safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway y=6 at t=8. unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14, t=8 safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway y=7 at t=9. unsafe at T=12,13,14, t=9 safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway y=8 at t=10. unsafe at T=12,13,14, t=10 safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nBut we reached at t=11, which is later than the minimal 9.\n\nH is number of turns: from t=2 to t=11, that's 10 turns? Actions from t=2 to t=10, 9 actions, H=9, reach y_11=9.\n\nBut earlier minimal with no wait is 7 actions to reach at t=9.\n\nHere we used 2 S actions, so delayed.\n\nBut we avoided the unsafe times.\n\nCan we do with less waiting?\n\nNotice that y=4,5,6 are unsafe only at T=3,4,5, but at T=6, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at T=6.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=6, we are on y=4, which is safe.\n\nBut we stayed at y=3 from t=3 to t=5.\n\nt=3,4,5 at y=3.\n\nAt t=5, we do U to y=4 at t=6.\n\nt=6 is when y=2 is unsafe, but we are not on y=2.\n\nWe could go up faster after t=5.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=1 or something, but y=1 has cars, and unsafe at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nBut we start at y=2, going down to y=1 might not help.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 at t=6 or later.\n\nSince at t=3,4,5, y=4,5,6 are unsafe, but y=3 and y=7 are safe at those times.\n\ny=7 unsafe only later.\n\nSo if we can be on y=3 during t=3,4,5, then move up after t=5.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAfter t=5, y=4,5,6 are safe except at late times which we can avoid.\n\nt=5 is the last unsafe for early times.\n\nNow, at t=2, we are at y=2.\n\nIf we do U at t=2 to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, we stay at y=3 by doing S at t=3, so y_4=3, at t=4 y=3.\n\nSimilarly, S at t=4, y_5=3, at t=5 y=3.\n\nThen at t=5, we do U to y=4 at t=6.\n\nNow from t=6, we can go up quickly: U at t=6, y_7=5; U at t=7, y_8=6; U at t=8, y_9=7; U at t=9, y_10=8; U at t=10, y_11=9.\n\nReach at t=11.\n\nBut at t=6, y=4; t=7, y=5; t=8, y=6; all safe since after t=5.\n\nt=9 y=7 safe, t=10 y=8 safe, t=11 y=9.\n\nBut we used actions from t=2 to t=10, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nCan we reduce?\n\nNotice that at t=3,4,5 we are staying at y=3, but we could be moving up during some of these times if we can avoid the unsafe rows.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=2, do U: a_2=U, y_3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, safe. Now, instead of staying, we can go to y=4 at t=4, but at t=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=2 at some point? But y=2 is safe except t=6.\n\nSuppose at t=3, we do D: but y=2 might be safe at t=4.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=6.\n\nAt t=3, if we do D: a_3=D, then y_4= y_3 -1 =3-1=2, so at t=4, y=2.\n\nFreeway y=2 at t=4: unsafe only at T=6, not t=4, so safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=2, we can do U: a_4=U, y_5=3, at t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, do U: a_5=U, y_6=4, at t=6, y=4.\n\nNow t=6, freeway y=4 at t=6: safe, as before.\n\nBut also at t=6, freeway y=2 is unsafe, but we are on y=4, not y=2.\n\nThen from here, same as before: a_6=U, y_7=5, t=7 y=5 safe; a_7=U, y_8=6, t=8 y=6 safe; a_8=U, y_9=7, t=9 y=7 safe; a_9=U, y_10=8, t=10 y=8 safe; a_10=U, y_11=9, t=11 y=9.\n\nSame as before, 9 actions.\n\nBut we did one D action, which is worse, since we need net +7, so with D, we need extra U.\n\nIn this case, from t=2 to t=11, actions: a2=U, a3=D, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U? Let's list:\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: a3=D, y4=2\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=3\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: a8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=9\n\nSo actions from t=2 to t=10, 9 actions, same as before.\n\nBut we have one D and one extra U, net same.\n\nNot better.\n\nTo save time, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 at t=6 or something.\n\nBut at t=3,4,5, we cannot be on y=4,5,6.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at t=3,4,5.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 is safe at t=3,4,5.\n\nSo the fastest way might be to stay at y=3 during t=3,4,5, then at t=5 go to y=4, and so on.\n\nBut with that, we start moving up at t=5 to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen y=5 at t=7, y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=5 to y=9 at t=11, that's 6 steps: to y4 at t6, y5 at t7, y6 at t8, y7 at t9, y8 at t10, y9 at t11, so 6 U actions, but we were at y=3 at t=5.\n\nHow to get to y=3 at t=5.\n\nFrom start: at t=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=3 by some time.\n\nIf we do U at t=2, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen we stay at t=3 and t=4 at y=3: so a2=U, y3=3; then a3=S, y4=3; a4=S, y5=3; then at t=5, a5=U, y6=4; etc as before.\n\nWe have two S actions.\n\nIf we can reach y=3 later, but we are at y=2 at t=2, so we can stay at y=2 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=2, do S: a2=S, y3=2, at t=3 y=2 safe.\n\nThen at t=3, do U: a3=U, y4=3, at t=4 y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, do S: a4=S, y5=3, at t=5 y=3 safe.\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4, same as before.\n\nBut we did S at t=2, so we started later.\n\nThen y6=4 at t=6, same point.\n\nBut now we used one more S, so reached later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the sequence with two S at t=3 and t=4 seems efficient.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 directly or something, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, y=2 is unsafe, but if we are not on y=2 at t=6, it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=4 at t=6.\n\nBut can we be at higher y at t=6?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=3 at t=3, then instead of staying, but we have to stay to avoid y=4,5,6.\n\nUnless we can go to y=7 during the unsafe period, but to go to y=7, we need to go through y=4,5,6, which are unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=2, U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, U to y=4 at t=4, but at t=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nDo nothing at t=2: S, y3=2.\n\nThen at t=3, U to y=4? a3=U, y4=3? y4 = y3 + delta y, y3=2, a3=U, y4=3.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, U to y=4 at t=5, but at t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo it seems impossible to be on y=4,5,6 at t=4 or t=5 without collision.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=3 or y=7 during t=4 and t=5, but y=7 is far, we can't reach it by t=4 from y=2.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=2, to y=7, need 5 U, at t=7.\n\nBut at t=4 and t=5, we are still low.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 9 with the sequence: U at t=2, S at t=3, S at t=4, U at t=5, U at t=6, U at t=7, U at t=8, U at t=9, U at t=10.\n\nLet's list the actions and positions.\n\nt | y_t | action a_t | y_{t+1} | safe at t?\n\nt=2: y2=2, a2=U, y3=3 → safe at t=2? y2=2, freeway y=2 at t=2: not unsafe (only t=6), so safe.\n\nt=3: y3=3, a3=S, y4=3 → at t=3, y=3, safe (not unsafe at t=3)\n\nt=4: y4=3, a4=S, y5=3 → at t=4, y=3, safe\n\nt=5: y5=3, a5=U, y6=4 → at t=5, y=3, safe\n\nt=6: y6=4, a6=U, y7=5 → at t=6, y=4, safe (t=6 not unsafe time)\n\nt=7: y7=5, a7=U, y8=6 → at t=7, y=5, safe\n\nt=8: y8=6, a8=U, y9=7 → at t=8, y=6, safe\n\nt=9: y9=7, a9=U, y10=8 → at t=9, y=7, safe\n\nt=10: y10=8, a10=U, y11=9 → at t=10, y=8, safe (unsafe only at T=12,13,14)\n\nThen at t=11, y11=9, safe.\n\nNow, the last action is at t=10, which sets y11=9.\n\nSo we reached at turn t=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9, reach at turn t1 + H -1 +1? t1=2, actions from t=2 to t=10, H=9 actions, reach y_{2+9} = y11=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a2 to a10.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nThe minimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8?\n\nSuppose we reach at t=10 with y10=9.\n\nThen y10=9 = y2 + sum_{t=2}^{9} delta y_t = 2 + sum =9, so sum of delta y from t=2 to t=9 must be 7.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=9, that's 8 actions (t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).\n\nWith sum delta y =7, so net +7, so possible with 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U and one D but D would require extra U, so best 7 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, we need to be at positions such that at each turn t from 2 to 9, y_t is safe.\n\ny_t for t=2 to 9.\n\ny2=2 given.\n\ny3 = y2 + delta y2\n\n...\n\ny10 = y9 + delta y9\n\nBut y10=9.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe need y_t for t=2 to 9 to be safe.\n\ny2=2 safe.\n\ny10=9 safe, but at turn t=10, we are not on the grid yet? At turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nWhen we reach y10=9 at turn t=10, we are at (0,9) at turn t=10, which is safe.\n\nFor t=10, y_t=9 safe.\n\nNow, for H=8, actions at t=2 to t=9, reach y10=9.\n\ny_t for t=2 to 10 must be safe? No, for each turn t from 2 to 10, y_t must be safe, because at that turn we are on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, position y_t, must be safe at time t.\n\nFor H=8, we have turns from t=2 to t=10, with y_t defined for t=2 to 10.\n\ny10=9.\n\nNow, with 8 actions, sum of delta y from t=2 to t=9 must be 7, so y10 = y2 + sum_{t=2}^9 delta y_t = 2 +7 =9, so exactly 7 U and 1 S, no D.\n\nThe S action means we stay at some y for one turn.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4,5,6 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5 are the critical turns where y=4,5,6 are unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at t=6.\n\nNow, possible sequences.\n\nSuppose we have one S.\n\nThe S can be at different times.\n\nFor example, if we S at an early turn.\n\nAt t=2, S: a2=S, y3=2, so at t=3 y=2 safe.\n\nThen we need to go up to y=9 in 7 steps with 6 U and the S is used, but we have 7 U and one S for the actions.\n\nActions: 7 U and 1 S, so 8 actions.\n\nAfter y3=2, we need y10=9, so from y3=2 to y10=9, difference 7, with actions from t=3 to t=9, 7 actions, all U, then y10=9.\n\nBut actions from t=3 to t=9.\n\nt=3: y3=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y4=3, a4=U, y5=4 → but at t=5, y=4? Turn t=5, position y5.\n\ny5=4, at t=5, unsafe! Because y=4 unsafe at t=5.\n\nIf all U from t=3: t=3 y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4 y=3, a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5 y=4, unsafe at t=5.\n\nNot good.\n\nS at later time.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=3 quickly.\n\na2=U, y3=3 (t=3 y=3 safe)\n\nThen at t=3, instead of S, we must do something.\n\nIf a3=U, y4=4, t=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\na3=S, y4=3, t=4 y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can do U: but a4=U, y5=4, t=5 y=4 unsafe.\n\nStill.\n\nIf at t=4, we do S, y5=3, t=5 y=3 safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 by t=10 with actions from t=5 to t=9.\n\ny5=3, y10=9, need +6 in 5 actions (t=5 to t=9, 5 actions).\n\nBut we need sum delta y from t=5 to t9 to be 6, with 5 actions, so must have all U except one S not possible, 5 actions, min sum if all U is 5, but we need +6, impossible.\n\ny10 = y5 + sum_{t=5}^{9} delta y_t\n\ny5=3, y10=9, so sum_{t=5}^{9} delta y_t =6\n\nBut there are 5 actions (t=5 to t=9), each delta y <=1, so max sum is 5, cannot be 6. Impossible.\n\nTherefore, if we stay at y=3 until t=5, we cannot reach y=9 by t=10 with H=8.\n\ny5=3, to y10=9, need 6 steps, but from t=5 to t=10, that's 5 actions (t=5 to t=9), which can increase y by at most 5, to y10=3+5=8<9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nExactly.\n\nSo with y5=3, the earliest to reach y=9 is with 6 U actions, from t=5 to t=10, reach y11=9 at t=11.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at t=5.\n\nFor example, at t=5, if we are at y=4, but at t=5, y=4 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 or y=6 unsafe at t=5.\n\ny=3 is safe, but low.\n\ny=7 is safe at t=5, but from y=2 at t=2, to y=7 at t=5, need to increase by 5 in 3 actions (t=2,3,4), so possible with all U: a2=U, y3=3; a3=U, y4=4; a4=U, y5=5.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 unsafe; at t=5, y=5 unsafe. Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nWith S or D, we go slower.\n\nSo impossible to be above y=3 at t=5 without collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with the sequence I have.\n\nIn the sequence, we reach at t=11 with 9 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn t=2: action U\n\nTurn t=3: action S\n\nTurn t=4: action S\n\nTurn t=5: action U\n\nTurn t=6: action U\n\nTurn t=7: action U\n\nTurn t=8: action U\n\nTurn t=9: action U\n\nTurn t=10: action U\n\nThen at turn t=11, position y=9.\n\nBut the last action is at t=10, so H=9 actions.\n\nThe sequence should be up to the action before reaching.\n\nIn the answer, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=2, so actions a_{2+t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{2+0}=a2\n\nt=1, a3\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{2+H-1}\n\nAnd reach at turn (t1 + H -1) = 2 + H -1 = 1+H\n\nWith y_{1+H} =9\n\nIn our case, with H=9, reach at turn 1+9=10? 1+H=10, y10=9.\n\nIn my earlier, I have y11=9, which is turn 11.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nt1=2, actions a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1, that is a2 to a_{2+H-1}\n\nThen position after last action is y_{t1 + H}\n\nBecause after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nFor example, with H actions, from a_t1 to a_{t1+H-1}, then y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=2, so y_{2+H} =9.\n\nWith H=7, y_{9}=9.\n\nBut we couldn't with collision.\n\nWith our sequence: if we have actions up to a10, then y11=9, so 2+H=11, H=9.\n\ny_{2+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence I had: actions a2 to a10, H=9, y11=9.\n\nIn the safe sequence: a2=U, a3=S, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn t=5, action U, which sets y6=4, and at t=6, we are at y=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we can be on y=6 at t=6, for example.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=6, from y=2 at t=2.\n\nNeed to increase by 4 in 4 actions (t=2,3,4,5).\n\nBut at t=4, if we are at y=4 or y=5, unsafe.\n\nFor example, a2=U, y3=3 (t=3 y=3 safe)\n\na3=U, y4=4 (t=4 y=4 unsafe, collision)\n\na2=S, y3=2 (t=3 y=2 safe)\n\na3=U, y4=3 (t=4 y=3 safe)\n\na4=U, y5=4 (t=5 y=4 unsafe)\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4 unsafe\n\nAlways hit unsafe at t=4 or t=5 when going to y=4 or y=5.\n\nCannot be at y=6 by t=6 without being on unsafe row at unsafe time.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have two S, but we can have the S at different points.\n\nFor example, instead of S at t=3 and t=4, we could have other waits, but it won't save time.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=1, but y=1 unsafe at t=3,4,5, so not helpful.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t=2: U\n\nTurn t=3: S\n\nTurn t=4: S\n\nTurn t=5: U\n\nTurn t=6: U\n\nTurn t=7: U\n\nTurn t=8: U\n\nTurn t=9: U\n\nTurn t=10: U\n\nThen at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nBut the last action is at t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t=10: action U, which is fine.\n\nIn the answer, it should be up to turn t=10 for actions.\n\nH=9 actions from t=2 to t=10.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on y=2 at t=6.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=6, we are on y=4, not y=2, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nAnother thing: at t=5, we are on y=3, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=5 U to y=4 at t=6, etc.\n\nPerhaps we can start with S or something, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2, there is a car with speed 12, but we handled it.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions detailed below.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by ensuring that the player is not on a freeway \\(y\\) at any turn \\(T\\) when \\(x=0\\) is covered by a car on that freeway. The unsafe times for each freeway are derived from the car states at \\(t_1 = 2\\):\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at \\(T = 6\\)\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe at \\(T = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\)\n\nThe sequence stays at \\(y=3\\) during turns \\(T=4\\) and \\(T=5\\) to avoid the unsafe periods for \\(y=4,5,6\\) at these times. It then proceeds upward quickly after \\(T=5\\), reaching \\(y=9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 2, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=3\\) for turn 3. Position at turn 2: \\(y=2\\), safe.\n- At turn 3, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y=3\\) for turn 4. Position at turn 3: \\(y=3\\), safe.\n- At turn 4, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y=3\\) for turn 5. Position at turn 4: \\(y=3\\), safe.\n- At turn 5, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=4\\) for turn 6. Position at turn 5: \\(y=3\\), safe.\n- At turn 6, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=5\\) for turn 7. Position at turn 6: \\(y=4\\), safe (not unsafe at \\(T=6\\)).\n- At turn 7, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=6\\) for turn 8.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=3, and I'm at y=3. I have to move up to y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, and their positions update based on speed and time. Since they're all moving right, and the direction is given as \"right\", so for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], but looking at the rule:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says for car k, head h, tail τ. For right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end and h is the right end? That might be confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo at time t1, the car spans from τ to h, with τ < h since it's right-moving? But in the data, for example, on freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4). Head h=-36, tail τ=-47. But -36 > -47, so if it's right-moving, and span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36], I think? But it says head h and tail τ, but in the direction, for right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head is at higher x, so if x increases to the right, head should be greater than tail.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, car: (-36, -47, right, 4). h=-36, τ=-47. Since -36 > -47, and moving right, so at t1, it spans from x= -47 to x= -36? But τ=-47, h=-36, so min x is τ, max x is h? But usually tail is back, so for right-moving, tail left, head right.\n\nSimilarly, (0, -11, right, 4): h=0, τ=-11, so spans from -11 to 0.\n\n(36, 25, right, 4): h=36, τ=25, so from 25 to 36? But 25 to 36, but 25<36, so min=25, max=36.\n\nIn the list, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end, so span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is at y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T), and collision if for the freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in Span(T).\n\nAlso, note that when you move, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so you collide if on y_T and car has 0 in span at T.\n\nThen at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check for cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut since you are only on one freeway per turn, you only care about the car on that freeway at that time.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9, so I need to increase y by 6. Each U action increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays. So minimum moves would be 6 U actions, but I have to avoid cars, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since I need to go up, going down might not help, so probably I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=9, no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once there, no issue.\n\nNow, current turn t1=3, position y=3.\n\nI need to find actions from t=3 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at time t1=3.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nCar A: head = -36, tail = -47, dir=right, speed=4 → span at t1: [ -47, -36 ]? Tail τ=-47, head h=-36, so min x = τ = -47, max x = h = -36, so span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nBut since it's moving right, at time T, span [ τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1) ] = [ -47 + 4(T-3), -36 + 4(T-3) ]\n\nSimilarly, car B: (0, -11, right, 4) → at t1: τ=-11, h=0, so [ -11, 0 ]\n\nCar C: (36, 25, right, 4) → τ=25, h=36, [25,36]\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (-36, -47, right, 12) → τ=-47, h=-36, [ -47, -36 ]\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 4) → same as above, [ -47, -36 ]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: three cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 1 and 4: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nFreeway 6: same: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nFreeway 7: (-36,-47,right,4) → one car, [ -47, -36 ]\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47,right,4) → one car, [ -47, -36 ]\n\nNow, I need to check for each freeway and each turn T, whether there is a car with 0 in its span at that time, meaning the car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nCollision if for freeway y at turn T, there is a car on that freeway with 0 ∈ [min, max] of its span at T.\n\nSince the player is at (0,y), and cars are on the freeway, so for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nBut for a given freeway and time, I can compute if there is a car such that min_x(T) <= 0 <= max_x(T).\n\nThen for the player to be safe at turn T on freeway k, there should be no car on k with 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, I start at t=3, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I can stay or move, I need a sequence of actions.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, for each car, I can find when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car with span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for right-moving.\n\nSet min_x(T) <= 0 <= max_x(T)\n\nSo τ + s(T-t1) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s(T-t1)\n\nSince τ <= h for right-moving cars.\n\nSo we have:\n\nτ + s(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t1)\n\nWhich implies:\n\nFrom τ + s(T-t1) <= 0: T-t1 <= -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s(T-t1): T-t1 >= -h / s\n\nLet t_rel = T - t1 = T - 3\n\nFor each car, the time interval when it covers x=0 is from ceil( -h/s ) to floor( -τ/s ) or something? Let's see.\n\nFrom the inequalities:\n\nτ + s t_rel <= 0 => t_rel <= -τ / s\n\nAnd 0 <= h + s t_rel => s t_rel >= -h => t_rel >= -h / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nAlso, t_rel must be integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT is integer, t_rel integer.\n\nSo for a car, it covers x=0 when t_rel >= ceil( -h / s ) and t_rel <= floor( -τ / s )? Let's define carefully.\n\nFrom t_rel >= -h / s and t_rel <= -τ / s\n\nSince t_rel integer, t_rel >= ceil( -h / s ) and t_rel <= floor( -τ / s )\n\nBecause t_rel must be at least the smallest integer >= -h/s, and at most the largest integer <= -τ/s.\n\nFor example, if -h/s is not integer, ceil(-h/s) is the smallest integer >= -h/s.\n\nSimilarly, floor(-τ/s) is the largest integer <= -τ/s.\n\nThen the car covers x=0 for t_rel from max(0, ceil(-h/s)) to min(inf, floor(-τ/s)), but since time starts from t1, and we care about future, t_rel >=0.\n\nBut t_rel = T-3, T>=3, so t_rel >=0.\n\nNow for each freeway, I need the union of these intervals for all cars on that freeway.\n\nThen for each freeway, the set of t_rel when it is unsafe (occupied at x=0).\n\nThen for the player, at turn T, if on freeway k, it must be that at t_rel = T-3, freeway k is safe, i.e., not occupied at that time.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: three cars.\n\nCar B: (h=0, τ=-11, s=4) at t1.\n\nt_rel >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -0/4 ) = ceil(0) = 0\n\nt_rel <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-11)/4 ) = floor(11/4) = floor(2.75) = 2\n\nSo for t_rel=0,1,2, this car covers x=0? At t_rel=0, T=3, min_x = τ + s*0 = -11, max_x=0, so yes, -11<=0<=0.\n\nAt t_rel=1, T=4, min_x= -11 +4 = -7, max_x=0+4=4, so -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nt_rel=2, T=5, min_x= -11+8= -3, max_x=0+8=8, -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nt_rel=3, min_x= -11+12=1, max_x=4, 1 to 4, 0 not in [1,4], so no.\n\nSimilarly, car A: h=-36, τ=-47, s=4\n\nt_rel >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -(-36)/4 ) = ceil(36/4) = ceil(9) =9\n\nt_rel <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-47)/4 ) = floor(47/4) = floor(11.75)=11\n\nSo for t_rel=9,10,11\n\nCar C: h=36, τ=25, s=4\n\nt_rel >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-36/4) = ceil(-9) = -9? But t_rel >=0, so not relevant? ceil(-9) = -9, but since t_rel >=0, and -9 <0, so t_rel >=0 > -9, but we need t_rel >= ceil(-h/s) = -9, which is always true for t_rel>=0? No.\n\nt_rel >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-36/4) = ceil(-9) = -9\n\nSince -9 <=0, and t_rel >=0, so lower bound is 0 effectively? ceil(-h/s) = -9, so t_rel >= -9, but t_rel >=0, so the binding constraint is t_rel >=0.\n\nUpper bound: t_rel <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-25/4) = floor(-6.25) = -7? Since -7 < -6.25 < -6, floor is -7.\n\nBut t_rel >=0, and -7 <0, so t_rel <= -7 is impossible since t_rel>=0. So no overlap? Let's see.\n\nmin_x(T) = τ + s t_rel = 25 + 4 t_rel\n\nmax_x(T) = h + s t_rel = 36 + 4 t_rel\n\n0 in [min,max] if min <=0 and 0<=max.\n\nmin <=0: 25 + 4 t_rel <=0 => 4 t_rel <= -25 => t_rel <= -25/4 = -6.25, so t_rel <= -7 since integer.\n\nBut t_rel >=0, impossible.\n\n0 <= max: 0 <= 36 + 4 t_rel always true for t_rel>=0.\n\nSo car C never covers x=0 for t_rel >=0.\n\nSimilarly, car A covers at t_rel=9,10,11\n\nCar B covers at t_rel=0,1,2\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at t_rel=0,1,2 (from car B) and t_rel=9,10,11 (from car A), car C never.\n\nt_rel=0 is T=3, now.\n\nSo unsafe at t_rel: 0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=12\n\nt_rel >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(36/12) = ceil(3) =3\n\nt_rel <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(47/12) = floor(3.916) =3\n\nSo only at t_rel=3? t_rel=3: min_x = τ + s t_rel = -47 + 12*3 = -47+36= -11? t_rel= T-3, at T=6, t_rel=3.\n\nmin_x = τ + s (T-3) = -47 + 12 t_rel\n\nAt t_rel=3, min_x= -47 + 36 = -11, max_x= -36 + 36 =0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt t_rel=2, min_x= -47 + 24 = -23, max_x= -36+24= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt_rel=4, min_x= -47+48=1, max_x= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t_rel=3, unsafe.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: same as freeway 2 but speed 4? Freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47, s=4\n\nt_rel >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(36/4) = ceil(9) =9\n\nt_rel <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(47/4) = floor(11.75)=11\n\nSo unsafe at t_rel=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: cars A,B,C with s=4.\n\nCar B: (0,-11,right,4) unsafe t_rel=0,1,2\n\nCar A: (-36,-47,right,4) unsafe t_rel=9,10,11\n\nCar C: (36,25,right,4) never unsafe for t_rel>=0.\n\nSo unsafe at t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 5: same as 1 and 4: unsafe t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 6: same: unsafe t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-36,-47,right,4) same as freeway 3: unsafe t_rel=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 8: one car: same, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times (t_rel):\n\nFreeway 1: t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 2: t_rel=3\n\nFreeway 3: t_rel=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 4: t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 5: t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 6: t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\nFreeway 7: t_rel=9,10,11\n\nFreeway 8: t_rel=9,10,11\n\nt_rel=0 is current turn, t=3.\n\nPlayer starts at t=3, y=3.\n\nAt t=3, t_rel=0, y=3.\n\nFreeway 3: is it unsafe? Freeway 3 unsafe only at t_rel=9,10,11, so at t_rel=0, freeway 3 is safe? Let's see.\n\nFreeway k=3, unsafe at t_rel=9,10,11, so at t_rel=0, it is safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt turn T=3, t_rel=0, player on y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe only at t_rel=9,10,11, so at t_rel=0, freeway 3 is safe. So player can be there safely.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut I need to pass through y=4 to y=8.\n\nNow, let's list for each y and each t_rel, if it is safe.\n\nBut t_rel starts from 0.\n\ny from 1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars, always safe? But y=0 is not a freeway with cars, but the player can be at y=0, but in this case, we start from y=3, go to y=9, so y=0 not involved.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think.\n\nNow, for each freeway, the unsafe t_rel:\n\nI should make a table or list the safe t_rel for each y.\n\nSince y corresponds to freeway k.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, unsafe t_rel: 0,1,2,9,10,11 → so safe t_rel: 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,... but since we care about minimal turns, probably up to t_rel=12 or so.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: freeway 2, unsafe only t_rel=3 → so safe except t_rel=3.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11 → safe for t_rel=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=4: freeway 4, unsafe t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe t_rel=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same as y=4, unsafe 0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe 3-8,12,...\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same, unsafe 0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe 3-8,12,...\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11 → safe for all except those, so t_rel=0-8,12,... safe.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11 → safe t_rel=0-8,12,...\n\nNow, player at t_rel=0, y=3, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach turn, I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nStart: t_rel=0, y=3\n\nGoal: y=9 at some t_rel.\n\nSince y=9 always safe, no issue.\n\nI need min H such that after H-1 actions, I reach y=9.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1, so turns t=3 to 3+H-1.\n\nt_rel from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t=3 + t_rel, position y_{3 + t_rel}\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=3\n\nAfter first action, at t_rel=1, y changes based on a_{t1} = a_3.\n\nLet's denote the action at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action, then at turn t+1, I am at new y.\n\nThe sequence: at turn T, I am at y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, with delta based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, I must be safe on y_T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I must be safe on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nFor the starting turn, t=3, I am at y=3, and I choose action a_3 for the next position.\n\nIn the action sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, let's see the notation.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns, I think, from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions? Let's see.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H - 1, y = 9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 relative, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be 9? No.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta_{a_{t1}}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + delta_{a_{t1+1}}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H - 1}, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1 + H - 1} + delta_{a_{t1 + H - 1}}\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo at the end of turn t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThe action a_t is chosen at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for turn t, a_t affects the next position.\n\nBut at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, we must be safe at y_t.\n\nAt turn t+1, we must be safe at y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nStart at turn t1, y_{t1} =3.\n\nWe need to find actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 2} to reach y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe sequence is a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H - 1}, but let's see the indices.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nSo actions at times: t1 + 0, t1 +1, ..., t1 + (H-1)\n\nNow, after action a_{t1 + k}, at turn (t1 + k) + 1, position y_{t1 + k + 1}\n\nWe want at turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSo for example, after action a_{t1 + H - 2}, at turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAnd action a_{t1 + H - 1} is also taken, but since we reach at turn t1 + H - 1, I think we don't need to move further, but the action is included, but at that turn, we are already at y=9, so a_{t1 + H - 1} could be S, or U/D but y=9, boundary, so S or D but D might go to 8, but we want to be at 9, so probably S is safe.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, and we are at (0,9), we can stay or whatever, but to be at (0,9) at that turn, we need to have arrived or be there.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H - 1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThe last action a_{t1 + H - 2} determines y_{t1 + H - 1} from y_{t1 + H - 2}.\n\nThen a_{t1 + H - 1} is chosen, but it doesn't affect y_{t1 + H - 1}, it affects y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut since we only care about being at y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1, we can choose a_{t1 + H - 1} arbitrarily, but to be safe, since at that turn we are at y=9, safe, so a_{t1 + H - 1} can be S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence, we need to specify actions from t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1, that's H turns? Turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, that's H turns.\n\nFor example, turns 3,4,5 for H=3.\n\nAt turn 3, position y3.\n\nAfter actions from a3 to a_{3+H-1}.\n\nLet's set t1=3.\n\nStart at turn 3, y3=3.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nT = t1 + H - 1 = 3 + H - 1.\n\nH is minimal such that we can reach y=9 at turn 3+H-1.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9, net +6 in y.\n\nEach U is +1, D is -1, S is 0.\n\nTo minimize time, I should use U as much as possible, but avoid unsafe positions.\n\nSince I can stay, I might need to wait on safe rows.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, unsafe t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe t_rel=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=2: freeway 2, unsafe t_rel=3 → safe t_rel=0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,... except 3\n\ny=3: freeway 3, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11 → safe t_rel=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=4: freeway 4, unsafe t_rel=0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe t_rel=3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same as y=4, unsafe 0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=6: freeway 6, same, unsafe 0,1,2,9,10,11 → safe 3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11 → safe t_rel=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe t_rel=9,10,11 → safe t_rel=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,...\n\ny=9: always safe\n\ny=0: always safe, but not needed.\n\nI start at t_rel=0, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some t_rel.\n\nMinimal H, so min time.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always, I can go directly if possible.\n\nBut I need to pass through intermediate y.\n\nThe critical points are when some rows are unsafe at certain times.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=0, y=1 and y=4,5,6 are unsafe? y=1 unsafe at t_rel=0, y=4 unsafe at t_rel=0, etc.\n\nBut I am at y=3, safe.\n\nI need to go up to y=4, but at t_rel=0, y=4 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=4 at t_rel=0.\n\nt_rel=0 is turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, I am on y=3.\n\nI choose action a3 for turn 3, which will determine y4 (position at turn 4).\n\nAt turn 4, t_rel=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's think in terms of time.\n\nLet t denote t_rel, for simplicity, from 0.\n\nAt time t (turn t1+t), position y_t.\n\ny_t must be safe for that t.\n\nStart: t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThen H = T+1, since at turn t1 + T, y=9, so the turn index is t1 + T, so H-1 = T, thus H = T+1.\n\nt_rel = T, at turn t1 + T, position is 9.\n\nThe actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + T}, since actions at turns t1 to t1+T, total T+1 actions, but the sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so H = T+1.\n\nFor example, if I reach at t_rel=0, but y=3 not 9, not.\n\nMin T such that y_T=9.\n\nThen actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + T}, but a_{t1 + T} is chosen at turn t1+T, when I am at y=9, so it can be S.\n\nThe number of turns H is T+1, since turns from t1 to t1+T.\n\nTurn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+T, that's T+1 turns.\n\nAt turn t1+T, I am at y=9.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+T}, each at the respective turn.\n\nNow, for each action, I change y.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=9, min steps is 6 U, but with waits.\n\nSince I can only change by 1 per turn, I need at least 6 turns to increase by 6.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down, but going down might not help, so probably min T=6 if possible.\n\nCan I go directly up in 6 steps?\n\nStart t=0, y=3\n\nAfter a3 (turn t1=3 action), at t=1 (turn 4), y=4 if U, or 3 if S, or 2 if D.\n\nBut at t=1, y must be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet's see for each t, what y are safe.\n\nMake a grid: time t (t_rel) vs y.\n\nt from 0 to, say, 12.\n\ny from 0 to 9.\n\nFor each (t,y), if safe.\n\ny=0: always safe\n\ny=1: safe for t not in {0,1,2,9,10,11}\n\ny=2: safe for t not 3\n\ny=3: safe for t not in {9,10,11}\n\ny=4: safe for t not in {0,1,2,9,10,11} → so safe for t=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=5: same as y=4, safe t=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=6: same, safe t=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=7: safe for t not in {9,10,11} → so safe for all t except 9,10,11\n\ny=8: safe for t not in {9,10,11} → same\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nNow, at t=0, y=3 is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nNow, possible paths.\n\nFirst, can I go up immediately?\n\nAt t=0, y=3, I can choose U, then at t=1, y=4.\n\nBut at t=1, y=4: is it safe? y=4 safe only for t=3 to 8, not at t=1, since unsafe at t=1. So at t=1, y=4 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I choose S at t=0, then at t=1, y=3, which is safe since t=1 not 9,10,11.\n\nIf D, to y=2 at t=1.\n\ny=2 at t=1: t=1, y=2 unsafe only if t=3, but t=1≠3, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so D might not be useful.\n\nSo at t=0, if I go U, to y=4 at t=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot go U at t=0.\n\nI can go S or D.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3 for t=1.\n\ny=3 at t=1 safe.\n\nIf D, go to y=2 at t=1, also safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably stay or wait.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3 (if I stayed), I can choose action.\n\nAt t=1, if y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=4: t=2, y=4 unsafe because y=4 unsafe at t=2, since t=2 in {0,1,2} for unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be at y=4 at t=2.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=3 at t=2.\n\ny=3 at t=2 safe.\n\nIf D, to y=2 at t=2.\n\ny=2 at t=2: t=2, y=2 unsafe only at t=3, so t=2 safe.\n\nBut not progress.\n\nNow, y=4 is unsafe for t=0,1,2, and safe for t=3 to 8.\n\nSimilarly y=5 and y=6 same.\n\ny=4,5,6 are only safe between t=3 and t=8 inclusive.\n\nt=3 to 8.\n\nt=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, y=7 and y=8 are safe except t=9,10,11.\n\nBut t=9,10,11 are later.\n\nNow, since I need to go through y=4,5,6, I must be on them during t=3 to 8.\n\nMoreover, I start at y=3 at t=0.\n\ny=3 is safe until t=8, except t=9,10,11 but later.\n\nt=0 to 8 y=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is safe except t=3.\n\ny=1 safe except t=0,1,2,9,10,11.\n\nNow, to go up, I need to enter y=4 at some point when it is safe, i.e., at t>=3.\n\nSimilarly for y=5,6.\n\nNow, min time: I need to be at y=9.\n\nSince y=4,5,6 can only be occupied between t=3 and t=8, I have to be on them during that window.\n\nI start at t=0, y=3.\n\nI can stay at y=3 until t= something, then go up.\n\nBut y=4 is only safe from t=3 onwards.\n\nAt t=3, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=4, but at which time.\n\nFor example, at t=2, if I am at y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=4 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nI could go earlier, but y=4 unsafe at t=0,1,2, so I cannot be on y=4 before t=3.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=4 from t=3 to t=8.\n\nNow, y=5 and y=6 same, safe t=3 to 8.\n\ny=7 safe except t=9,10,11, so for t=0 to 8 safe.\n\ny=8 same.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, min steps.\n\nSince I need to increase y by 6, min 6 steps, but I might need to wait at beginning.\n\nStart t=0, y=3.\n\nI cannot go U immediately because y=4 at t=1 unsafe.\n\nI can go S or D.\n\nBut if I go S at t=0, to y=3 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=3, I can go S again to y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=3, I can go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from t=3, y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t=4.\n\ny=5 at t=4: t=4, y=5 safe since t=4 in 3-8.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=6 at t=5, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=6, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=7, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, check if all safe.\n\nt from 0 to 8.\n\nt=0: y=3, safe\n\nAction a3 (at turn t1=3) : since we stay, a=S? Action at turn t: we choose a_t to go to next y.\n\nAt turn t=3 (t_rel=0), position y=3, choose a3.\n\nIf I choose S, then at turn t=4 (t_rel=1), y=3.\n\nThen at turn t=4 (t_rel=1), position y=3, choose a4.\n\nIf choose S, at turn t=5 (t_rel=2), y=3.\n\nThen at turn t=5 (t_rel=2), position y=3, choose a5=U, then at turn t=6 (t_rel=3), y=4.\n\nThen at turn t=6 (t_rel=3), position y=4, choose a6=U, at turn t=7 (t_rel=4), y=5.\n\nAt t=7 (t_rel=4), position y=5, choose a7=U, at t=8 (t_rel=5), y=6.\n\nAt t=8 (t_rel=5), position y=6, choose a8=U, at t=9 (t_rel=6), y=7.\n\nAt t=9 (t_rel=6), position y=7, choose a9=U, at t=10 (t_rel=7), y=8.\n\nAt t=10 (t_rel=7), position y=8, choose a10=U, at t=11 (t_rel=8), y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t=11 (t_rel=8), y=9, which is the goal? But we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1.\n\nt_rel=8, turn=3+8=11.\n\ny=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut H: t_rel from 0 to 8, that's 9 steps? Let's count turns.\n\nStart turn 3, position.\n\nAfter actions, we reach at turn 11.\n\nTurn 3 to 11, that's 9 turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nH-1 = 8? t1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1 =11, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nBut we used many S actions at beginning.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t_rel=0 to 2, we stayed at y=3, then from t_rel=3 to 8, we went up to y=9.\n\nt_rel=3: y=4, t=4:y=5, t=5:y=6, t=6:y=7, t=7:y=8, t=8:y=9.\n\nSo at t_rel=8, y=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier?\n\ny=4,5,6 must be between t=3 and t=8, so I cannot be on them before t=3 or after t=8.\n\nt=8 is the last safe for y=4,5,6.\n\nAt t=8, if on y=6, I can go to y=7, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe earlier, I can be on them before t=3.\n\nFor example, at t=0, y=3, I could go D to y=2 at t=1.\n\ny=2 at t=1: safe, since t=1 ≠3.\n\nThen at t=1, y=2, I could go U to y=3 at t=2? Or directly to y=1? But y=1 at t=1 unsafe.\n\nAt t=1, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=2, for example.\n\nBut that might not save time.\n\nI need to go to y=4 as soon as possible, but not before t=3.\n\nThe earliest to be on y=4 is t=3.\n\nSimilarly, to leave y=6 by t=8 at latest.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should be on y=4 at t=3, then go up as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=3, to y=5 at t=4, y=6 at t=5, then y=7 at t=6, y=8 at t=7, y=9 at t=8.\n\nSo reach y=9 at t=8.\n\nt_rel=8.\n\nBut I need to get to y=4 at t=3.\n\nI start at t=0, y=3.\n\nAt t=0, I need to choose action to set position for t=1.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, I can choose U, but to y=4 at t=1, but t=1 y=4 unsafe, cannot.\n\nChoose S, to y=3 at t=1.\n\nOr D to y=2 at t=1.\n\nNow, if at t=1, I am at y=3 (after S), I can choose U to y=4 at t=2, but t=2 y=4 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=1, I am at y=2 (after D at t=0), then at t=1, y=2, I can choose U to y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=3, I can choose U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=4 safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=4 before t=3.\n\nThus, the earliest to be on y=4 is t=3.\n\nThen from there, I can go up each turn: y=4 at t=3, y=5 at t=4, y=6 at t=5, y=7 at t=6, y=8 at t=7, y=9 at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, y=9.\n\nt_rel=8, turn=3+8=11, y=9.\n\nNow, what about the actions to get there.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=2, I need to be at y=3 at t=2 to go U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, I can choose S or D, but to be at y=3 at t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=0, choose S, then at t=1, y=3.\n\nThen at t=1, choose S, at t=2, y=3.\n\nThen at t=2, choose U, to y=4 at t=3.\n\nThen as above.\n\nI could go down and up, but it takes same or more time.\n\nFor example, at t=0, choose D, to y=2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, choose U, to y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, choose U, to y=4 at t=3.\n\nSame as staying: from t=0 to t=2, I end at y=3 at t=2 in both cases.\n\nWith S,S or D,U, I reach y=3 at t=2.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t=3.\n\nNow, after that, from t=3 to t=8, I go up each turn.\n\nt=3: y=4\n\nt=4: y=5\n\nt=5: y=6\n\nt=6: y=7\n\nt=7: y=8\n\nt=8: y=9\n\nAt t=8, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, t_rel from 0 to 8, that's 9 steps? t_rel=0 to 8 inclusive is 9 times.\n\nBut positions: at t=0: y=3\n\nt=1: y=3 (if first S)\n\nt=2: y=3\n\nt=3: y=4\n\n...\n\nt=8: y=9\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=8, which is turn t1 + 8 = 3+8=11.\n\nH: since at turn t1 + H -1 =11, so 3 + H -1 =11, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn t1=3 to turn t1 + H -1 =11, actions at each turn.\n\nActions: a3 to a11, but a11 is at turn 11, when we are at y=9, so we can choose S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor H=9, actions at t=3 to t=3+8=11? t1 + H -1 =3 +9 -1=11.\n\nActions at turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nNow, at turn 3: we choose action based on current position.\n\nAt turn 3 (t_rel=0), position y=3.\n\nWe need to choose a3 to set position for turn 4.\n\nIn the sequence above, to have y=3 at turn 4, we choose S at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my earlier plan: to be at y=3 at turn 4 and turn 5? Let's list the turns carefully.\n\nDenote turn T, position y_T at turn T.\n\nT start from t1=3.\n\nTurn T=3: y3=3\n\nChoose a3: if S, then y4=3\n\nIf U, y4=4, but unsafe.\n\nIf D, y4=2\n\nIn the plan, we want y4=3? Then at turn 4, y=3.\n\nThen at turn 4, choose a4: if S, y5=3\n\nThen at turn 5, choose a5=U, then y6=4\n\nTurn 5: position y5, choose a5, then y6 = y5 + delta.\n\nIn the plan:\n\nAt turn 3: y3=3, choose a3=S, then y4=3\n\nAt turn 4: y4=3, choose a4=S, then y5=3\n\nAt turn 5: y5=3, choose a5=U, then y6=4\n\nAt turn 6: y6=4, choose a6=U, then y7=5\n\nAt turn 7: y7=5, choose a7=U, then y8=6\n\nAt turn 8: y8=6, choose a8=U, then y9=7\n\nAt turn 9: y9=7, choose a9=U, then y10=8\n\nAt turn 10: y10=8, choose a10=U, then y11=9\n\nNow at turn 11, y11=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe reached at turn 11.\n\nH: turn from 3 to 11, that's 9 turns (3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11), so H=9.\n\nBut we have actions from a3 to a10, since a10 determines y11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{3+9-1}=a11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y11=9, and we choose a11, which can be S, for example.\n\nIn the above, a10=U, to y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, we choose a11, say S, but since we are already at y=9, it doesn't affect the position for this turn.\n\nBut the action is required in the sequence.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 3, instead of staying, can I go down to y=2?\n\nAt turn 3, y=3, choose D, then y4=2.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=2, but t_rel=1 (since T=4, t1=3, t_rel=1), y=2 at t=1.\n\nIs it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t_rel=3, which is T=6.\n\nt_rel=1, y=2 safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can choose U to y=3 at turn 5.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=3, choose U to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nBut turn 6 is t_rel=3, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before: y=4 at t=3? Turn 6 is t_rel=3, same as before.\n\nBut now I reached y=4 at turn 6, which is later than before.\n\nIn the first plan, I reached y=4 at turn 6? No.\n\nIn first plan: at turn 5: y5=3, choose U, y6=4, so y=4 at turn 6, t_rel=3.\n\nIn this alternative: at turn 3: D, y4=2\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=4\n\nSame as first, but instead of two S, I did D and U, but reached y=4 at same turn 6.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nCan I be on y=7 or y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=0, y=3, I can go U, but unsafe.\n\nOr, can I go to y=7 directly? But I need to go through y=4,5,6.\n\nUnless I skip, but I can only change by 1, so must go through each level.\n\ny=4,5,6 must be visited, and only safe between t=3 and t=8.\n\nSo the earliest to be on y=4 is t=3, on y=5 is t=4, etc., up to y=9 at t=8.\n\nt=8 is the earliest to reach y=9.\n\nt_rel=8.\n\nIn terms of turns, from start t_rel=0, to t_rel=8.\n\nWith 6 up moves, but I need to wait from t=0 to t=2 at y=3 or somewhere.\n\nBut y=3 is safe, so I can wait.\n\nIn the sequence, from t_rel=0 to 2, I am at y=3, which requires no move or stay.\n\nThen from t_rel=3 to 7, I move up each turn to reach y=8 at t=7, then to y=9 at t=8.\n\nIn the position: at t=0: y=3\n\nt=1: y=3\n\nt=2: y=3\n\nt=3: y=4\n\nt=4: y=5\n\nt=5: y=6\n\nt=6: y=7\n\nt=7: y=8\n\nt=8: y=9\n\nSo reached at t=8.\n\nNow, actions: to have y4=3, from y3=3, a3=S\n\ny5=3, from y4=3, a4=S? At turn 4, position y4=3, choose a4 to set y5.\n\nIf I want y5=3, choose a4=S.\n\nThen at turn 5, y5=3, choose a5=U, to y6=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: position y3=3, choose a3 = S (to stay at y=3 for next)\n\nThen turn 4: position y4=3, choose a4 = S (to stay)\n\nTurn 5: position y5=3, choose a5 = U (to go to y=4)\n\nThen turn 6: position y6=4, choose a6 = U (to y=5)\n\nTurn 7: position y7=5, choose a7 = U (to y=6)\n\nTurn 8: position y8=6, choose a8 = U (to y=7)\n\nTurn 9: position y9=7, choose a9 = U (to y=8)\n\nTurn 10: position y10=8, choose a10 = U (to y=9)\n\nNow at turn 11: position y11=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1, so turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, we go to y=9, so at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, for turn 11, we need to choose a11, which can be S, since we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to a11.\n\nNow, but in the above, from turn 8 to 10, we have y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nAt turn 8, y8=6, which is safe since t_rel=5 (T=8, t1=3, t_rel=5), y=6 safe at t=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=4 at t=3, but then go faster, but I have to go through each, so min from y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps: to y=5 at t=4, y=6 at t=5, y=7 at t=6, y=8 at t=7, y=9 at t=8. Same as above.\n\nUnless I can skip some, but I can't, since only change by 1.\n\nSo t=8 is earliest.\n\nt_rel=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I used turns from t=3 to t=11 for positions, but actions define the moves.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce the waiting.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, instead of staying, can I go to another row?\n\nFor example, to y=2.\n\nAt turn 3, choose D, then y4=2.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=2, t_rel=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=3 at turn 5? Turn 4, choose U, then y5=3.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=3, choose U to y6=4.\n\nSame as before, y=4 at turn 6, same as first plan.\n\nNo gain.\n\nCan I go to y=7 earlier? But to reach y=7, I need to be at y=6 before, which requires y=5, etc., and y=6 only safe from t=3 to 8, so cannot be earlier.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo min T=8 to reach y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have to specify actions.\n\nIn the first plan, I have two S at beginning.\n\nBut I can have different actions, but same time.\n\nNow, about the car on y=2 at t_rel=3.\n\ny=2 is unsafe at t_rel=3.\n\nIn the plan, I didn't go to y=2, so no issue.\n\nBut just to note.\n\nNow, another thing: at the end, when I go to y=9.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I have:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 3: a3 = S\n\nTurn 4: a4 = S\n\nTurn 5: a5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a8 = U  // to y=7? Let's list positions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | resulting y_{T+1}\n\nT=3: y3=3, a3=S, y4=3\n\nT=4: y4=3, a4=S, y5=3\n\nT=5: y5=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y6=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y7=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y8=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y10=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nNow at T=11: y11=9, we need to choose a11, say S, so y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nBut we reach at T=11.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but H is fixed by time.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe earlier, but I cannot reach them earlier because I have to go through y=4,5,6 which are blocked.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=7 at t=2, but I cannot, because to be at y=7, I need to be at y=6 at t=1, but y=6 unsafe at t=1, and also from y=3 to y=7 in one step impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, min H=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if all positions are safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=3, t_rel=0, safe\n\nTurn 4: y=3, t_rel=1, safe\n\nTurn 5: y=3, t_rel=2, safe\n\nTurn 6: y=4, t_rel=3, safe (since t=3 for y=4 safe)\n\nTurn 7: y=5, t_rel=4, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=6, t_rel=5, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=7, t_rel=6, safe (y=7 safe at t=6)\n\nTurn 10: y=8, t_rel=7, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=9, t_rel=8, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, actions: a3=S, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, and a11=S or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need a11.\n\nSince at turn 11, we are at y=9, we can choose a11=S.\n\nIn the action list for turns 3 to 11.\n\nBut turn 11 action doesn't affect the reaching, but it is part of the sequence.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller?\n\nSuppose I go down to y=2 first.\n\nAt turn 3: choose D, then y4=2\n\nTurn 4: y=2, t_rel=1, safe\n\nThen I can choose to go to y=1? But at turn 4, choose U to y=3? Or to y=1.\n\nIf to y=1: a4=U? Action: from y=2, U to y=3, D to y=1, S to y=2.\n\nIf at turn 4, y=2, choose D, then y5=1.\n\nBut at t_rel=2, T=5, t_rel=2, y=1: unsafe, since y=1 unsafe at t=0,1,2.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nChoose U to y=3 at turn 5.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=8 with different path.\n\nt_rel=8, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=8, I need to be at y=8 at t=7, since only +1 per turn.\n\ny=8 at t=7 safe.\n\ny=7 at t=6 safe.\n\nBut y=6 at t=5 safe, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\ny=6 must be at some t between 3 and 8, etc.\n\nSo min time is fixed.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nNow, sequence of actions.\n\nActions at each turn from t1=3 to t1+H-1=3+9-1=11.\n\nSo turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U  // from y=6 to y=7? Positions: at T=8, y8=6 (from previous), choose a8=U, to y9=7\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAfter a7=U at T=7, y8=6 (since y7=5, U to y8=6)\n\nThen a8=U at T=8, to y9=7\n\na9=U at T=9, to y10=8\n\na10=U at T=10, to y11=9\n\nThen a11 at T=11, to y12, but we don't care.\n\nBut we reach at T=11.\n\nTo write the actions:\n\nTurn 3: a3 = S\n\nTurn 4: a4 = S\n\nTurn 5: a5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a7 = U  // to y=6 from y=5? T=7: y7=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: a8 = U  // y8=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9: a9 = U  // y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nTurn 10: a10 = U  // y10=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nTurn 11: a11 = S  // say, stay\n\nIn the sequence, a5 to a10 are all U except the first two S.\n\nBut at turn 11, we are at y=9, so a11 can be S.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAlso, H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from turn 3 to 11.\n\nNow, but I think I can start moving up earlier if I go to y=7 or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are safe at t=0, but I am at y=3, and to go to y=7, I need to pass through y=4,5,6, which are unsafe at t=0,1,2.\n\nFor example, at t=0, if I go U to y=4 at t=1, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nBut in the action, at turn 5, I go U to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nBut turn 6 is t_rel=3.\n\nI could have gone U at turn 4, but at turn 4, if I am at y=3, if I go U, to y=4 at turn 5.\n\nBut turn 5: t_rel=2, T=5, t_rel=2, y=4 unsafe, since t=2 in unsafe for y=4.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, must wait until turn 5 to go U to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nH=9\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut in the positions, after a10=U at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nThen a11=S at turn 11.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7: a7=U, from y7=5 to y8=6\n\nTurn 8: a8=U, from y8=6 to y9=7\n\nTurn 9: a9=U, from y9=7 to y10=8\n\nTurn 10: a10=U, from y10=8 to y11=9\n\nTurn 11: a11=S\n\nAll actions covered.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 2 at t_rel=3.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t_rel=3, but I didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut H=9, with 6 up and 2 stay and one S at end, but the end S is after reaching.\n\nThe reaching is at turn 11 after action a10.\n\nBut in terms of turns, from turn 3 to 11, 9 turns.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence if I go down and up, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, suppose at turn 3: D, to y4=2\n\nThen at turn 4: since y=2 at t_rel=1, safe, I can choose S or U.\n\nIf U, to y5=3 at turn 5.\n\nThen at turn 5: U to y6=4.\n\nSame as before, y=4 at turn 6.\n\nIf at turn 4, I choose D to y5=1, but at t_rel=2, y=1 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 9 - 1 = 11\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to stay at \\(y = 3\\) for the first two turns (turns 3 and 4) to avoid the unsafe conditions on \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 0, 1, 2\\) (turns 3, 4, 5). From turn 5 onwards, the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11. The actions ensure that the player is only on freeways when they are safe, based on the car positions and movements.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 3**: \\(S\\) (stay) – Player remains at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 0\\).\n- **Turn 4**: \\(S\\) (stay) – Player remains at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 1\\).\n- **Turn 5**: \\(U\\) (up) – Player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6, which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\).\n- **Turn 6**: \\(U\\) (up) – Player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7, which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 4\\).\n- **Turn 7**: \\(U\\) (up) – Player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8, which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5\\).\n- **Turn 8**: \\(U\\) (up) – Player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9, which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 6\\).\n- **Turn 9**: \\(U\\) (up) – Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10, which is safe at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 7\\).\n- **Turn 10**: \\(U\\) (up) – Player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, which is always safe.\n- **Turn 11**: \\(S\\) (stay) – Player remains at \\(y = 9\\) (action chosen since position is already reached).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns (\\(H = 9\\)) by avoiding all unsafe freeway-time combinations:\n- \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) are only safe for \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\) to \\(8\\) (turns 6 to 11), so the player enters \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 3\\) (turn 6) and exits \\(y = 6\\) by \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 5\\) (turn 8).\n- \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are safe except at \\(t_{\\text{rel}} = 9, 10, 11\\) (turns 12 to 14), so the player is safe during the movement.\n- The initial waits at \\(y = 3\\) avoid the unsafe \\(y = 4\\) at early turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, but since we're starting at turn t_1, I'll just use t to denote the turns from now on, with t=0 being the first action at turn 4.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=3 and need to get to y=9, we need to move up, but we have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, you're still on y_T, and you only check for collisions on y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, the car spans are given at turn t_1=4, and we can compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway at turn t=4 (which is t_1).\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n- Car 1: head h=-32, tail τ=-43, direction right, speed s=4\n- Car 2: head h=4, tail τ=-7, direction right, s=4\n- Car 3: head h=40, tail τ=29, direction right, s=4\n\nI need to understand the span. For right-moving cars, span is [τ, h] since τ is tail and h is head, but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For the first car on freeway 1: head=-32, tail=-43, dir=right. Since it's right-moving, the span should be from tail to head, but tail=-43, head=-32, so if it's moving right, as time increases, the positions increase.\n\nThe update rule: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving based on the data.\n\nLet me check all freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, dir right, speed s=12\n\nFreeway 3: one car: head h=-32, tail τ=-43, dir right, s=4\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: same as freeway 1: (-32,-43,right,4), (4,-7,right,4), (40,29,right,4)\n\nFreeway 5: same as above\n\nFreeway 6: same as above\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nAnd freeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one, freeway 3 has one, etc.\n\nNow, for each car, at any turn T, the span can be computed as [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] for right-moving cars, since all are right-moving.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is within the span [low, high] where low = min(τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)) and high = max, but since for right-moving, τ is tail, h is head, and if tail < head, then span is [τ, h] and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with ΔT = T-4.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], and since it's moving right, τ + sΔT and h + sΔT, with τ < h typically? Let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1, car 1: τ=-43, h=-32, so τ < h, so span at T is [-43 + 4(T-4), -32 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, car 2: τ=-7, h=4, span at T: [-7 + 4(T-4), 4 + 4(T-4)]\n\nCar 3: τ=29, h=40, span at T: [29 + 4(T-4), 40 + 4(T-4)]\n\nNow, for collision, we care when 0 is in this interval for some car on the freeway where player is.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn t=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and freeways are 1-8, y=9 is not a freeway, so once we reach y=9, we're safe, I assume, as long as we don't go below or something, but the goal is to be at (0,9), and since there are no cars on y=9, it should be fine.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps up, so H=6 if we can go straight up without issues.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions on freeways 1-8 during the path.\n\nSo let's see for each freeway, when there are cars that cover position 0 at various turns.\n\nFirst, since the player moves one y per turn (or stays, but to minimize turns, we probably want to move up as much as possible), so let's assume we always move up unless we have to avoid.\n\nBut we might need to stay or even move down to avoid, but moving down would increase H, so probably only if necessary.\n\nSince we need to go up, and cars might block at certain times, we might need to delay or change the timing.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, the times when position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k, find all T such that for some car on k, 0 is in [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] for that car.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is covered if low <= 0 <= high, where low and high are the ends.\n\nFor each car, we can find the range of T when it covers 0.\n\nThen for each freeway, the set of T where collision occurs if player is on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on y at turn t only if at that turn, y_t = y.\n\ny_t changes based on actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to start. Set t=0 as turn t_1=4, so at turn t=0, player is at y=3.\n\nThen at each turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, player is at (0, y_t).\n\nThen when we apply action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}, but at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nCollision at turn T if for y_T, and for that freeway, 0 in span of some car at T.\n\nFor turn T, which is global turn, but since t_1=4, turn T corresponds to t = T - t_1 = T - 4 in our relative time.\n\nSet τ = t - 4, so at τ=0, turn 4.\n\nThen for relative time τ >=0.\n\nAt time τ, the turn is t = 4 + τ.\n\nPlayer position y_τ at time τ.\n\nActions a_τ for τ from 0 to H-1, and after H actions, at time τ=H, y_H should be 9.\n\nAt time τ, y_τ is position, and we choose a_τ to set y_{τ+1}.\n\nStart: at τ=0, y_0 =3\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1} =9\n\nAnd we need y_H =9.\n\nNow, collision at time τ if at that turn, which is global turn t=4+τ, for freeway y_τ, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t=4+τ.\n\nSpan at t=4+τ for a car: since ΔT = (4+τ) - 4 = τ, so for a right-moving car, span is [τ_car + s * τ, h_car + s * τ] where τ_car and h_car are tail and head at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right.\n\nSo let's list for each freeway the cars and their span at time τ.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1 (y=1):\n\nCars:\n\n1. tail τ = -43, head h = -32, s=4 → span at τ: [-43 + 4τ, -32 + 4τ]\n\n2. τ = -7, h=4, s=4 → [-7 +4τ, 4 +4τ]\n\n3. τ=29, h=40, s=4 → [29 +4τ, 40 +4τ]\n\n0 is covered if for some car, low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor car1: -43 +4τ <= 0 <= -32 +4τ\n\nWhich is 4τ <= 32 and 4τ >= 43? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-43 +4τ <= 0 => 4τ <= 43 => τ <= 43/4 = 10.75\n\n0 <= -32 +4τ => 4τ >= 32 => τ >= 8\n\nSo for car1, τ in [8, 10.75], but since τ integer, τ=8,9,10\n\nSimilarly, car2: -7 +4τ <=0 <=4 +4τ\n\n-7+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=7 => τ <= 7/4=1.75\n\n0 <=4+4τ always true for τ>=0? 0 <=4+4τ, since 4+4τ >=4>0 for τ>=0, so only need -7+4τ <=0, which is τ <=1.75, so τ=0,1? τ integer.\n\n-7+4τ <=0 and 0<=4+4τ\n\n0<=4+4τ always true for τ>=0 since min at τ=0 is 4>0.\n\n-7+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=7 => τ <= 1.75, so τ=0,1\n\nBut at τ=0: -7 +0 = -7 <=0, 0<=4, yes\n\nτ=1: -7+4= -3 <=0, 0<=4+4=8, yes\n\nτ=2: -7+8=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, car3: 29+4τ <=0 <=40+4τ\n\n29+4τ <=0? 4τ <= -29, impossible since τ>=0, 4τ>=0.\n\n0<=40+4τ always true.\n\nBut 29+4τ <=0 never true, so car3 never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 covered when car1 or car2 covers.\n\nCar2 at τ=0 and τ=1\n\nCar1 at τ=8,9,10\n\nSo collision on freeway 1 at τ if y_τ=1 and τ in {0,1,8,9,10}\n\nτ is time index.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2):\n\nOnly one car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, right-moving\n\nSpan at τ: [-35 +12τ, -24 +12τ]\n\n0 covered if -35+12τ <=0 <= -24+12τ\n\nSo -35+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ <=2\n\n0 <= -24+12τ => 12τ >=24 => τ >=2\n\nSo τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: -35+24= -11 <=0 <= -24+24=0? 0<=0 true, -11<=0 true, so yes.\n\nτ=1: -35+12= -23 <=0, 0 <= -24+12= -12? 0 <= -12 false.\n\nτ=3: -35+36=1 <=0 false.\n\nSo only τ=2.\n\nThus collision on freeway 2 at τ=2 if y_τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3):\n\nOne car: τ=-43, h=-32, s=4, same as freeway1 car1.\n\nSpan at τ: [-43+4τ, -32+4τ]\n\n0 covered when τ=8,9,10 as before.\n\nSince same as car1 on y=1.\n\nSo collision at τ=8,9,10 if y_τ=3.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4):\n\nThree cars, same as y=1: cars with spans:\n\nCar like 1: [-43+4τ, -32+4τ], covers 0 at τ=8,9,10\n\nCar like 2: [-7+4τ, 4+4τ], covers 0 at τ=0,1? For y=4, same as y=1 car2.\n\nAt τ=0: -7+0=-7<=0<=4, yes\n\nτ=1: -7+4=-3<=0<=8, yes\n\nCar like 3: [29+4τ,40+4τ], never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, collision at τ if y_τ=4 and τ in {0,1,8,9,10}\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same cars as y=1 and y=4, so collision at τ in {0,1,8,9,10} if y_τ=5\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, collision at τ in {0,1,8,9,10} if y_τ=6\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): one car, τ=-43, h=-32, s=4, so span [-43+4τ, -32+4τ], covers 0 at τ=8,9,10\n\nSo collision if y_τ=7 and τ=8,9,10\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): one car, same as above, collision if y_τ=8 and τ=8,9,10\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\n- y=2: dangerous only at τ=2\n\n- y=3: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\n- y=4: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\n- y=5: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\n- y=6: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\n- y=7: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\n- y=8: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\ny_τ for τ from 0 to H.\n\nAt each τ, we choose action U, D, S to change y.\n\ny must stay in [0,9], but since we start at 3 and go to 9, and 0 and 9 are boundaries, we might not go below 0 or above 9, but y=9 is safe.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we need to avoid being on a dangerous y at dangerous τ.\n\nSpecifically, for each position and time, if at time τ, y_τ is dangerous for that y, we have collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous periods are:\n\n- For y=1,4,5,6: dangerous at τ=0,1 and τ=8,9,10\n\n- y=2: dangerous only at τ=2\n\n- y=3: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\n- y=7: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\n- y=8: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\nτ=0 is the current time, but at τ=0, we are at y=3, and y=3 is not dangerous at τ=0, because for y=3, dangerous only at τ=8,9,10.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,4,5,6 are dangerous at τ=0, but we are not on them.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on y=3, which is safe at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is 6, meaning we reach y=9 at τ=6, since we need 6 steps up.\n\ny_0 =3\n\nAfter 1 up: y1=4\n\ny2=5\n\ny3=6\n\ny4=7\n\ny5=8\n\ny6=9\n\nSo at τ=6, y=9.\n\nNow, check the path:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, safe (since y=3 dangerous only at τ=8-10)\n\nτ=1: after first action, say U, y1=4\n\nAt τ=1, y=4, but y=4 is dangerous at τ=1, so collision! Because τ=1 is in {0,1} for y=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, if we are on y=4, it is dangerous.\n\nIn this path, at τ=1, y=4, so collision.\n\nWe cannot go directly up at τ=1 to y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nIf we stay at τ=0, S, then y1=3, same position.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, still safe, since y=3 not dangerous at τ=1.\n\nThen we can go up at τ=1, to y=4? At τ=1, y=4 is dangerous, but when we go up, at turn τ=1, we are still on y=3 when we choose the action? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn τ, player is at y_τ.\n\nWe choose action a_τ.\n\nThen y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy based on a_τ.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of the turn, based on y_τ and the cars at that time.\n\nFor turn τ, we are on y_τ, and collision if y_τ is a freeway (1-8) and dangerous at that τ.\n\nIn the case above, at τ=0, y_0=3, not dangerous.\n\nIf we choose a_0 = U, then y_1 =4.\n\nNow, at turn τ=1, y_1=4, and we need to check for collision at τ=1 with y=4.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous at τ=1, collision occurs.\n\nIf we choose a_0 = S, then y_1 =3, same as y_0.\n\nAt turn τ=1, y_1=3, which is not dangerous (since dangerous only at τ=8-10), so safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go up, to y=4, but at τ=1, y=4 is dangerous, so at turn τ=1, if we set y_2=4, but at the time of turn τ=1, we are on y_1=3, which is safe, but after action, y_2 is for next turn.\n\nCollision is only at the current turn based on current y.\n\nSo at τ=1, if we are on y_1, and we choose action, collision depends on y_1.\n\nIf y_1=3, safe.\n\nThen if we choose a_1 = U, then y_2 =4.\n\nThen at turn τ=2, y_2=4, now check collision at τ=2 with y=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10, but τ=2 is not in the set, so safe? For y=4, dangerous at τ=0,1 and τ=8,9,10, so τ=2 is safe for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nSo let's list for each y and τ, if dangerous.\n\nMake a table for τ from 0 to, say, 12, and y from 1 to 8.\n\nDangerous if (y,τ) pair causes collision.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor y=1: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=2: dangerous at τ=2\n\ny=3: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\ny=4: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=5: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=6: dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10\n\ny=7: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\ny=8: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\nNow, player starts at τ=0, y=3, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so always safe when we are on it, but we reach it at the end.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a dangerous (y,τ) for y=1-8.\n\nMinimal H=6.\n\nWith H=6, y_τ:\n\nτ=0: y=3 safe\n\nτ=1: need y1, if we go up, y1=4, but at τ=1, y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we stay at τ=0, a0=S, y1=3 safe\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3 safe, then we can go up to y=4 at τ=2? At τ=1, after a1=U, y2=4.\n\nAt turn τ=2, y2=4.\n\ny=4 at τ=2: is it dangerous? From above, y=4 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10, not τ=2, so safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=5,6,etc.\n\nList the positions:\n\nOption: start with S to avoid being at y=4 at τ=1.\n\nSo:\n\nτ=0: y0=3, choose a0=S, so y1=3\n\nNow at τ=1: y1=3, safe (since not dangerous at τ=1)\n\nChoose a1=U, so y2 = y1 +1 =4\n\nAt τ=2: y2=4, and τ=2, y=4 not dangerous at τ=2, safe.\n\nNow choose a2=U, y3=5\n\nAt τ=3: y3=5, y=5 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10, τ=3 not in, so safe.\n\na3=U, y4=6\n\nτ=4: y4=6, y=6 dangerous at τ=0,1,8,9,10, τ=4 not, safe.\n\na4=U, y5=7\n\nτ=5: y5=7, y=7 dangerous at τ=8,9,10, τ=5 not, safe.\n\na5=U, y6=8\n\nτ=6: y6=8, y=8 dangerous at τ=8,9,10, τ=6 not, safe? τ=6, but dangerous at 8,9,10, 6<8, so safe.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=9\n\nNow at τ=7, y7=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached (0,9).\n\nBut we have y7=9 at τ=7, meaning after 7 actions, we are at y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nHere, from τ=0 to τ=6, we have 7 actions? Let's count.\n\nAt τ=0: action a0, to y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a6, y7=9.\n\nSo we used 7 actions: τ=0 to 6, that's 7 steps.\n\nBut minimal is 6 if no obstacles.\n\nHere we delayed by one step.\n\nIn this path, we have:\n\nτ=0: y0=3, a0=S, y1=3\n\nτ=1: y1=3, a1=U, y2=4\n\nτ=2: y2=4, a2=U, y3=5\n\nτ=3: y3=5, a3=U, y4=6\n\nτ=4: y4=6, a4=U, y5=7\n\nτ=5: y5=7, a5=U, y6=8\n\nτ=6: y6=8, a6=U, y7=9\n\nAt τ=7, y7=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each τ, y_τ:\n\nτ=0: y=3, safe\n\nτ=1: y=3, safe\n\nτ=2: y=4, safe (τ=2 not dangerous for y=4)\n\nτ=3: y=5, safe\n\nτ=4: y=6, safe\n\nτ=5: y=7, safe\n\nτ=6: y=8, safe (τ=6 <8)\n\nτ=7: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nBut H=7 turns? Number of actions is 7, from a0 to a6.\n\nWe reached at τ=7.\n\nBut can we do with H=6?\n\nWith H=6, we need y6=9.\n\ny6=9 means after 6 actions, at τ=6.\n\nStart y0=3.\n\nAfter 6 ups: y1=4, y2=5, y3=6, y4=7, y5=8, y6=9.\n\nBut at τ=1, y1=4 which is dangerous because τ=1 and y=4 collision.\n\nIf we go up immediately, a0=U, y1=4, at τ=1, collision.\n\nIf we do something else.\n\nSuppose we go down at some point? But going down would make it take longer to reach y=9, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nPerhaps stay at some points.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, we must be at y=3 safe.\n\nIf a0=U, to y1=4 at τ=1, but y=4 at τ=1 dangerous, collision, impossible.\n\na0=S, y1=3 at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, y1=3.\n\nIf a1=U, to y2=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y2=4, which is safe as above.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 by τ=6.\n\ny2=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen a2=U, y3=5 at τ=3, safe.\n\na3=U, y4=6 at τ=4, safe.\n\na4=U, y5=7 at τ=5, safe.\n\na5=U, y6=8 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y6=8, which is safe since τ=6 not 8,9,10.\n\nThen we need y6=9, but if a5=U, y6=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=6, we need y5=8, then a5=U to y6=9.\n\nBut at τ=6, y6=9, no issue.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nτ=0: y0=3, a0=S? If a0=S, y1=3\n\nτ=1: y1=3, a1=U, y2=4\n\nτ=2: y2=4, a2=U, y3=5\n\nτ=3: y3=5, a3=U, y4=6\n\nτ=4: y4=6, a4=U, y5=7\n\nτ=5: y5=7, a5=U, y6=8\n\nNow at τ=5, y5=7, safe.\n\nAfter a5=U, y6=8 at τ=6.\n\nBut we need y6=9, so we are at y6=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=6, we need to be at y=8 at τ=5, then U to y=9 at τ=6.\n\nBut in the above, at τ=5, we are at y=7, so y6=8.\n\nWe missed one up.\n\nFrom y2=4 at τ=2, to y6=8 at τ=6, we used 4 ups to go from 4 to 8, so y6=8, need one more to 9.\n\nBut with H=6 actions, we can only reach y=9 if we start from y=3 with 6 ups, but we have a delay.\n\nIn the direct path with no delay, we can reach in 6 actions: y_τ for τ=0 to 6: y0=3, y1=4, y2=5, y3=6, y4=7, y5=8, y6=9\n\nBut y1=4 at τ=1 causes collision.\n\nIf we avoid being at y=4 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0, we can only choose S or U or D.\n\nD to y=2, but y=2 at τ=0: is it dangerous? y=2 dangerous only at τ=2, not τ=0, so if a0=D, y1=2.\n\nAt τ=1, y1=2, which is y=2 at τ=1, dangerous only at τ=2, so τ=1 safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, we can go U to y=3 at τ=2? a1=U, y2=3.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=2: is it dangerous? y=3 dangerous at τ=8,9,10, not τ=2, so safe.\n\nThen we are at y=3 at τ=2, which is same as start but later.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, so at τ=8, y=9, but H larger.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSo with H=6, it seems impossible to reach without collision because to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps, we must be at y=4 at τ=1 or something.\n\nLet's list possible paths to y=9 in 6 steps.\n\ny must increase by 6 in 6 steps, so we must have exactly 6 U and no S or D, because S or D would require more U or not reach.\n\nWith S, we stay, so net increase less, need more actions.\n\nWith D, decrease, need even more.\n\nSo for minimal H=6, we must have all U, no S or D.\n\nThus y_τ = 3 + τ for τ=0 to 6: y0=3, y1=4, y2=5, y3=6, y4=7, y5=8, y6=9.\n\nNow, collisions:\n\nτ=0: y=3, safe\n\nτ=1: y=4, dangerous at τ=1, collision\n\nIndeed, at τ=1, y=4 is on freeway 4, and at τ=1, it is dangerous.\n\nSo collision unavoidable with this path.\n\nTherefore, H=6 is impossible.\n\nMinimal H must be at least 7.\n\nWith H=7, we can reach as in the first sequence I thought.\n\nBut in that sequence, we reached at τ=7 with y7=9.\n\nNow, but we have the issue of later times, τ=8,9,10, but in that path, we are done by τ=7, so no problem.\n\nBut can we reach earlier with H=7?\n\nH=7 actions, from τ=0 to τ=6, y7=9.\n\nIn the sequence I have: actions a0 to a6, y1 to y7.\n\nWith one S at the beginning.\n\nBut perhaps we can place the stay later to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, the dangerous times for the upper freeways are at τ=8,9,10, but since we reach by τ=7, we avoid them.\n\nIn the lower part, we only have danger at τ=0,1 for y=4,5,6 and τ=2 for y=2.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on y=2, and we avoided being at y=4 at τ=1 by staying at τ=0.\n\nWe could go up immediately but to a different y.\n\nAt τ=0, if a0=U, to y1=4, but at τ=1, y=4 dangerous, collision, not possible.\n\na0=D, to y1=2, at τ=1, y=2, which is safe since dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, we can go U to y2=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9, which takes 6 steps, so at τ=8, y=9? Let's see.\n\ny2=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen a2=U, y3=4 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=4, not dangerous (τ=3 not 0,1,8,9,10), safe\n\na3=U, y4=5 at τ=4, safe\n\na4=U, y5=6 at τ=5, safe\n\na5=U, y6=7 at τ=6, safe\n\na6=U, y7=8 at τ=7\n\nNow at τ=7, y7=8, which is safe since τ=7 <8.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so we need another action, a7=U, y8=9 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y8=9, safe.\n\nBut now we used 8 actions: from a0 to a7, H=8.\n\nWorse than the first sequence with H=7.\n\nIn first sequence with one stay, H=7 to reach at τ=7.\n\nIn this down-up, we have extra steps.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps stay at a different time.\n\nFor example, go up to y=4 at τ=2, then continue, but we need to reach y=9 by τ=6 for H=6, impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nWith H=7, we can reach.\n\nIn the sequence: a0=S, a1=U, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U\n\ny: τ=0:3, τ=1:3 (after S), τ=2:4, τ=3:5, τ=4:6, τ=5:7, τ=6:8, τ=7:9\n\nAll safe as before.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=8, which is safe, and we go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=7 but without staying at the beginning?\n\nFor example, go up to y=3 to y=4 at a later time.\n\nBut at τ=0, if we go U, collision at τ=1.\n\nIf we go to y=5 or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is dangerous at τ=0,1, but we are not there at those times.\n\nIn the path, if we can skip or something, but we have to pass through the freeways.\n\nPerhaps go directly to higher y but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo I think the sequence above is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times for y=7 and y=8 at τ=8,9,10, but in our path, we are at y=7 at τ=5, which is safe, y=8 at τ=6, safe, and y=9 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7 is before 8, so no issue.\n\nNow, in the car state, freeway 2 has a car dangerous at τ=2 for y=2, but we are not on y=2 at that time, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo with H=7, it works.\n\nBut can we reach in H=7 with fewer delays? In this case, we have one stay.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where we move up faster but avoid the danger.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go U to y=4, but collision at τ=1, impossible.\n\nOr, start with D to y=2 at τ=1, but then we are behind.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nIn terms of the turn, since t_1=4, the actions are for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo turn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_0 in relative, which is S in this case.\n\nThen turn t_1 +1: a1 = U\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nFirst, relative time τ=0 to τ=6 for actions.\n\nActions:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t_1=4): a_{t_1} = S\n\nAt τ=1 (turn t_1+1=5): a_{t_1+1} = U\n\nAt τ=2 (turn 6): a_{t_1+2} = U\n\nAt τ=3 (turn 7): U\n\nAt τ=4 (turn 8): U\n\nAt τ=5 (turn 9): U\n\nAt τ=6 (turn 10): U\n\nAfter that, at τ=7 (turn 11), y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 7 actions.\n\nIn the box, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1=4, position y=3.\n\nAfter first action at turn t_1, we go to next position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T chosen, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nWe start at turn T = t_1 =4, y_4 =3.\n\nWe choose a_4, then y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nThen choose a_5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\n...\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 4+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn my earlier, with H=7 actions: actions at turn 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nTurn 11 is t_1 + H =4+7=11.\n\ny_{11}=9.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = S, so y_5 = y_4 +0 =3 (since S)\n\nAt turn 5, y_5=3\n\nAction a_5 = U, y_6 =3+1=4\n\nTurn 6, y_6=4\n\na_6 = U, y_7=5\n\nTurn 7, y_7=5\n\na_7 = U, y_8=6\n\nTurn 8, y_8=6\n\na_8 = U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9, y_9=7\n\na_9 = U, y_{10}=8\n\nTurn 10, y_{10}=8\n\na_{10} = U, y_{11}=9\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions at each turn:\n\nTurn 4 (τ=0): y=3, freeway? y=3 is freeway, but at τ=0, not dangerous, safe.\n\nTurn 5 (τ=1): y=3, safe, not dangerous at τ=1.\n\nTurn 6 (τ=2): y=4, freeway 4. At τ=2, not dangerous (dangerous at 0,1,8,9,10), so safe.\n\nTurn 7 (τ=3): y=5, freeway 5, τ=3 not dangerous, safe.\n\nTurn 8 (τ=4): y=6, freeway 6, τ=4 not dangerous, safe.\n\nTurn 9 (τ=5): y=7, freeway 7, τ=5 not dangerous (dangerous at 8,9,10), safe.\n\nTurn 10 (τ=6): y=8, freeway 8, τ=6 not dangerous, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, not freeway, no issue.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=7 but without staying, but I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster in the beginning but avoid.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, go U to y=4 at turn 5, but collision at turn 5 if y=4.\n\nUnless we are not at y=4 when dangerous, but we have to be at some point.\n\nSince y=4 is only dangerous at τ=0,1, which are turns 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn 4, we start at y=3, so we can't be at y=4 at turn 4.\n\nAt turn 5, if we go to y=4, it is dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=4 at turn 5, which is τ=1.\n\nSimilarly for other y, but y=5 and y=6 also dangerous at τ=1, but we are not there.\n\nIn the minimal path, we have to pass y=4 at some turn, and the safe turns for y=4 are τ>=2 except τ=8,9,10.\n\nBut τ=8,9,10 are late.\n\nSimilarly, in our sequence, we are at y=4 at τ=2 (turn 6), which is safe.\n\nAnd we reach early.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=4 earlier, but τ=0 and 1 are dangerous, so no.\n\nSo I think this is minimal H=7.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 has a car at τ=2 for y=2, but we are not on it, so fine.\n\nAlso, freeway 3, but we are on y=3 at τ=0 and τ=1, safe.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter turn 10 action, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }\n\nBut we need to specify the actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=4, H=7, so turns 4 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence, but this should be fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about the car on freeway 2 at τ=2, but since we are not on y=2, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 2, at τ=2, y=2 is dangerous, but we are on y=4 at that time, different freeway.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 7, as a path with \\(H = 6\\) is impossible due to collisions at dangerous times.\n\n### Dangerous Times Analysis\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 4, 5, 6\\) are dangerous at turns \\(t = 4, 5\\) (relative \\(\\tau = 0, 1\\)) and \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\) (relative \\(\\tau = 8, 9, 10\\)).\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is dangerous only at turn \\(t = 6\\) (relative \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 3, 7, 8\\) are dangerous at turns \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\) (relative \\(\\tau = 8, 9, 10\\)).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4, which is safe.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,3). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The y position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: when moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and then moves to y' for the next turn. So at the moment of the move (turn T), the player is on the starting freeway y and will be checked against cars on that freeway. Only on the next turn (T+1) will the player be on y'.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 5). We have to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (5) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n\nIf the car is right-moving (d='right'):\n  At turn T (>= t1), the head becomes: h + s*(T - t1)\n            the tail becomes: tau + s*(T - t1)\n\nIf the car is left-moving (d='left'):\n  At turn T, the head becomes: h - s*(T - t1)\n            the tail becomes: tau - s*(T - t1)\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we only have to use the right-moving formula.\n\nAlso note: the car state representation for right-moving cars: the head is the rightmost (larger x) and tail the leftmost? But in the data, for a right-moving car, the head is given as a larger number than the tail? Let me check:\n\nExample: freeway 1: (-28, -39, right, 4) -> here head=-28, tail=-39 -> but -28 > -39, so the head is at a more right position? Actually, in a right-moving car, the head should be at the front (so when moving right, the head is the rightmost). But note that the representation says: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail (left) to head (right). So at t1, the car spans from tau to h (with tau <= h).\n\nThen at turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] but we don't have any left-moving.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0.\n\nThat is, if the car's span at turn T is [L, R] (with L<=R) then we require 0 to be in [L, R] for a collision.\n\nBut we want to avoid collisions, so we must ensure that for every turn T and for the freeway y_T we are on, no car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 5 at y=3. We are going to plan a sequence of moves until we reach y=9.\n\nNote: we are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8. The goal is (0,9) which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1..8). So when we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns starting at t1=5.\n\nWe need to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway at turn 5:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n  car2: (8, -3, right, 4)   -> wait, note that 8 > -3? But the representation for right-moving is [tau, head] = [-3, 8]? Actually, the problem states: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the tail is tau and the head is h, and tau should be less than or equal to h? But in the data, we have (8, -3, right, 4) which would imply tau=-3 and head=8? Then the car spans from -3 to 8? That makes sense because -3 < 8.\n\nSo let me reorganize: for a car record (head, tail, direction, speed), the problem states:\n\n  For right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h] (so from tail to head, with tail <= head). So the given numbers: the first number is head? But the example: (8, -3, right, 4) -> head=8, tail=-3? Then the span at t1 is [-3, 8].\n\nSimilarly, the other car: (44,33,right,4) -> head=44, tail=33 -> span [33,44].\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". So the first number is h (head) and the second is tau (tail).\n\nFor right-moving: the car spans [tau, h] at t1, and then at T: [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)].\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)] but we don't have any.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: head=-28, tail=-39, d=right, s=4 -> span at T: [ -39 + 4*(T-5), -28 + 4*(T-5) ]\n  car2: head=8, tail=-3, d=right, s=4 -> span at T: [ -3 + 4*(T-5), 8 + 4*(T-5) ]\n  car3: head=44, tail=33, d=right, s=4 -> span at T: [33 + 4*(T-5), 44 + 4*(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 2: \n  car1: head=-12, tail=-23, d=right, s=12 -> [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 3: \n  car1: head=-28, tail=-39, d=right, s=4 -> same as freeway1 car1: [ -39 + 4*(T-5), -28 + 4*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway1: three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 7: \n  car1: same as freeway1 car1: [ -39 + 4*(T-5), -28 + 4*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 8: \n  car1: same as freeway1 car1: [ -39 + 4*(T-5), -28 + 4*(T-5) ]\n\nSo the cars on freeways 1,3,4,5,6,7,8 have a car with the same pattern (the first car) and freeways 1,4,5,6 have two additional cars (the second and third). Freeway 2 has a different car.\n\nWe are at turn 5 at y=3. We need to avoid collisions when we are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe can move up, down, or stay. We start at y=3 (freeway 3) at turn 5.\n\nFirst, we must check if we are safe at turn 5 at y=3.\n\nAt turn 5 (T=5) on freeway 3: only one car: [ -39 + 4*(0) = -39, -28 + 0 = -28] -> [-39, -28]. Does this span include 0? No, because 0 is not in [-39, -28]. So we are safe.\n\nNow, we want to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars would be 6 moves (up 6 times: from 3 to 9). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are going to simulate moves. We need to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can use BFS (state = (turn, y)) to find the minimal steps to reach y=9. The state is (turn, y) and we start at (5,3). We mark the state by the turn and y. The turn will increase, and we want to minimize the number of turns (H) from the start (turn 5) until we land on y=9.\n\nNote: the turn when we start is 5, and we take an action at turn 5 to move to the next state. The next state (turn 6) will have a new y and then we check the freeway at turn 6.\n\nBut note: at the starting turn (5) we are already at y=3 and we are safe (as checked). Then we take an action at turn 5 to determine y6.\n\nThe sequence of actions: we are to output a_t for t from t1=5 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and the last action (at turn t1+H-1) leads to y=9 at the next turn? Actually, the update is: at turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the last turn (say T) we take an action a_T, and then at turn T+1 we have y_{T+1}. We require y_{T+1}=9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 5 at y=3. Then:\n\n  At turn 5: we take action a5 -> then at turn 6, we are at y6 = y5 + Δy5.\n\nWe must reach y_{t} = 9 for some t. The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t1 (5) to t1+H-1 (5+H-1). And then at the end of this sequence, we are at (0,9). That is, after taking the last action at turn (5+H-1), we are at turn 5+H and we require that at turn 5+H we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn 5 (the start) we are at (0,3). Then:\n\n  After 0 actions (H=0): we are at turn 5 at y=3 -> not 9.\n\n  After 1 action: we take an action at turn 5, then at turn 6 we are at y6 = 3 + Δy5. We require y6=9 -> that would require Δy5=6 -> impossible (only +1, -1, 0).\n\nSo we need at least 6 actions: because we have to move from 3 to 9: 6 steps up.\n\nBut we might have to wait (stay) sometimes to avoid collisions, so H might be more than 6.\n\nWe can do BFS (or Dijkstra since all moves cost 1) in state (turn, y). The turn starts at 5 and increases. We are to minimize the total turns (which is the same as the number of actions).\n\nWe'll generate states: (turn, y) and the path to get there.\n\nWe start at (5,3). We mark this as visited (with the turn and y).\n\nThen we consider actions: U, D, S. Then the next state is (turn+1, y + dy) where dy = {U:1, D:-1, S:0}. But note: y must be in [0,9]. If we go below 0, we clamp? The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and do D, we stay at 0? Similarly at 9 and U -> stay at 9? But the problem doesn't specify clamping. It says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So we assume that if the move would take y out of bounds, then it is clamped. But the problem does not specify. However, note that if we are at 0 and do D, we cannot go to -1. So we assume clamping: y is always between 0 and 9.\n\nBut to be safe, we will not generate a state that is out of [0,9]. So if y is 0 and we do D, then next y is 0. Similarly, if y is 9 and we do U, then next y is 9.\n\nWe simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each state (turn, y) we must check:\n\n  If y is between 1 and 8 (freeway), then we check if at this turn, on freeway y, there is any car that has a span that includes 0.\n\nIf there is, then this state is invalid (collision) and we skip.\n\nOtherwise, we mark it as valid and continue.\n\nWe start at (5,3) -> valid (as we checked).\n\nWe want to get to any state (T, 9) for T>=5. But note: when we are at (T,9), we are at the goal. However, note that 9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8) so we don't check for cars at y=9. So (T,9) is always safe.\n\nBut note: we might reach (T,9) by moving from (T-1,8) with U, or (T-1,9) with S, or (T-1,10) -> but 10 is clamped to 9? So we can get to 9 by:\n\n  - At turn T-1 we are at 8 and do U: then at turn T we are at 9.\n  - At turn T-1 we are at 9 and do S: then at turn T we are at 9.\n  - At turn T-1 we are at 9 and do U: then clamped to 9.\n\nBut note: we are at (T,9) meaning at turn T we are at y=9. How did we get there? At turn T-1 we were at y_{T-1} and took an action that led to y_T=9.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn 5 to turn T-1 (because the last action is taken at turn T-1 to get to turn T at y=9). So the sequence is for t=5,6,...,T-1. And H = T-5.\n\nWe want to minimize H.\n\nWe'll do BFS (by the turn, since each action increases the turn by 1) and we are minimizing the number of actions.\n\nWe start:\n\n  State: (turn=5, y=3) -> safe.\n\nThen we generate next states for actions at turn 5:\n\n  U: y6 = 4\n  D: y6 = 2\n  S: y6 = 3\n\nThen at turn 6, we check the freeway:\n\n  For y6=4: freeway 4 -> we must check if at turn 6, on freeway 4, there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for y6=2: freeway 2\ny6=3: freeway 3\n\nWe must compute the car positions at turn 6.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the car spans at turn 6 (T=6, so T-5=1).\n\nFreeway 4: \n  car1: [ -39 + 4*(1) = -35, -28 + 4*1 = -24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [ -3 + 4*1 = 1, 8+4=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? (0 is not in [1,12])\n  car3: [33+4=37, 44+4=48] -> [37,48] -> no.\n\nSo freeway4 at turn6: safe.\n\nFreeway2 at turn6:\n  car1: [ -23 + 12*1 = -11, -12+12=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? [ -11,0] includes 0? Yes, because 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nSo freeway2 at turn6: collision! So we cannot be at freeway2 at turn6.\n\nFreeway3 at turn6:\n  car1: [ -39+4= -35, -28+4=-24] -> no 0.\n\nSo:\n\n  Action U at turn5: leads to (6,4) -> safe.\n  Action D at turn5: leads to (6,2) -> freeway2 -> collision -> invalid.\n  Action S at turn5: leads to (6,3) -> safe.\n\nSo from (5,3) we have two valid moves: U to (6,4) and S to (6,3).\n\nNow, we continue.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we hit (T,9) for some T.\n\nWe have to compute for each state (turn, y) the car positions at that turn for freeway y.\n\nWe note that the cars on a freeway are fixed per freeway and we have the formulas.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and for a range of turns (say from turn 5 to 5+max_H, we can compute when the car spans on that freeway include 0). But note: we don't know max_H. However, since we are doing BFS and we want minimal turns, we can compute on the fly.\n\nAlternatively, we can note the periods when a car covers 0. But since the cars move linearly, we can compute the intervals of turns when a car on a given freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nBut to keep it simple, we'll compute at each step.\n\nHowever, to avoid recalculating the same freeway at the same turn multiple times, we might precompute a table: for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 5) we can compute if the freeway k is safe at turn T.\n\nBut note: the state (turn, y) only checks the freeway at the y value at that turn. So we can precompute a 2D array: safe[T][k] for k in 1..8 and T from 5 to a sufficiently large T.\n\nBut how large? Since we are going to do BFS until we reach 9, and we start at 3, the minimal steps is 6, and we might have to wait a few turns, so let's set max_turn = 5 + 20 (allowing up to 20 moves).\n\nWe'll precompute for turn T from 5 to 25 (20 steps) and for freeways 1..8.\n\nBut note: we might have to go beyond 25 if we get stuck? But we'll break when we find a solution.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the cars' spans at any T by the formula.\n\nLet me write a helper function: is_safe(k, T) -> True if at turn T, freeway k has no car that includes 0 in its span.\n\nFor freeway k, we have the list of cars (from the given data).\n\nFor each car on freeway k:\n\n  Let delta = T - 5.\n\n  For a right-moving car: \n      span_low = tail + s * delta\n      span_high = head + s * delta\n\n  Then, if 0 is in [span_low, span_high] (i.e., span_low <= 0 <= span_high) -> then collision -> return False.\n\nIf none, return True.\n\nNow, we simulate:\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS: (turn, y, path)\n\nStart: (5, 3, [])\n\nWe want to get to y=9 at any turn.\n\nWe mark visited states: (turn, y) to avoid cycles. But note: we might have to wait (stay) and then the turn increases so we don't cycle in the same state? Actually, (turn, y) is unique by turn. So we don't need to mark visited? Because the turn always increases. So we won't revisit (turn, y) at the same turn and same y. And we are doing BFS by turn (each step we advance one turn). So we can do without visited set? But we might have the same (turn, y) from different paths? Actually, we are doing BFS by the number of steps (which is turn-5). So we are expanding by increasing turn.\n\nBut note: the state (turn, y) is unique per turn and y. So we can store the best way to get to (turn, y) by the number of steps? But we are doing BFS and we are expanding by increasing turn, so the first time we get to y=9 we have the minimal steps.\n\nHowever, we might get to the same (turn, y) by two different paths? Then we can skip if we already expanded that state? But since the turn is increasing and we are doing BFS level by level (by the number of actions), then when we are at a given turn, we generate the next states. And we don't need to store the whole state because we don't come back to the same turn? Actually, we only move forward.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple ways to get to the same (turn, y) and we want to avoid duplicate work. So we can keep a visited set for (turn, y). But since we are doing BFS by increasing turn, when we process a state (turn, y) we have the minimal steps to get there? Actually, because each action costs 1 and we are doing BFS, the first time we get to (turn, y) is the minimal steps.\n\nSo we can mark (turn, y) as visited when we first get there? But note: we might have a path that gets to (turn, y) with more steps but then we skip? Actually, we are generating by increasing turn: we start at turn5, then turn6, then turn7, etc. So at each turn level, we generate all states that are reachable at that turn. And if we get to a state (turn, y) that we have already reached at an earlier turn? Actually, we are processing by the turn: we process all states at turn t before t+1. So we don't need to worry about multiple paths to the same state at the same turn? Actually, we can have multiple paths to the same (turn, y). But we can skip if we already processed (turn, y) because we are doing BFS and we are at the same turn? Actually, we generate states at turn t from states at turn t-1. So we might generate the same (turn, y) from different parents? Then we can avoid processing the same (turn, y) again? But that would be a duplicate. So we should mark (turn, y) as visited at the time we generate it.\n\nBut note: we are generating states for the next turn. For a given turn t, we generate next states for (t+1, y+dy). And we might generate the same (t+1, y) from different states at turn t. Then we can store the state (t+1, y) once and record one path? But we are only interested in the minimal steps, and we are doing BFS so we break when we first reach y=9. So we can stop as soon as we generate a state (T,9) for any T.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  Let queue be a queue of (turn, y, path) where path is the list of actions so far (from turn5 to turn (current turn-1)).\n\n  Start: (5, 3, [])\n\n  While queue not empty:\n\n      pop state (t, y, path)\n\n      if y == 9: then we found a solution. The number of actions is the length of the path (which is H), and the actions are the path. Then we output the actions.\n\n      Else, if t is beyond our precomputation? But we don't set a bound? We might set a max_turn to avoid infinite? But we can set a safe bound, say 100.\n\n      Then, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n\n          next_y = y + dy (clamped to [0,9])\n\n          next_t = t+1\n\n          If next_y is between 1 and 8, then we need to check if freeway next_y is safe at turn next_t? Wait, note: at the next state, we are at (next_t, next_y). But the collision check at turn next_t is for the freeway next_y. However, note: we are moving from y (at turn t) to next_y (at turn next_t). The move happens at turn t: then at turn t we are still on the old freeway (y) and we don't check the new freeway until turn next_t.\n\n          But the state (next_t, next_y) requires that at turn next_t we are on freeway next_y and we check that freeway at that turn.\n\n          So we compute: is_safe(next_y, next_t) if next_y in [1,8]. If next_y is 0 or 9, then no car -> safe.\n\n          If safe, then we add (next_t, next_y, path + [action]) to the queue.\n\n      We mark that we are going to process (next_t, next_y) so we don't add duplicates for the same (next_t, next_y). But as above, we can skip if we have already visited (next_t, next_y) because we are doing BFS and we want the minimal steps. The first time we get to (next_t, next_y) is the minimal steps.\n\n  We break when we find a solution.\n\nBut note: we start at (5,3) and then we generate (6,4) and (6,3). Then from (6,4) we generate (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) ... etc.\n\nWe'll implement the is_safe function.\n\nLet me code the is_safe(k, T) function for freeway k and turn T:\n\n  cars = the list for freeway k from the given data.\n\n  for each car in cars:\n      head = car[0]\n      tail = car[1]\n      d = car[2]  # all are 'right' in this case\n      s = car[3]\n\n      delta = T - 5   # because the initial state is at turn 5\n\n      if d == 'right':\n          low = tail + s * delta\n          high = head + s * delta\n          if low <= 0 <= high:\n              return False   # collision\n\n  return True\n\nNow, we run BFS.\n\nBut note: the freeways that have cars:\n\nWe'll pre-store the cars per freeway:\n\nfreeway_cars = {\n  1: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4), (8, -3, 'right', 4), (44,33,'right',4) ],\n  2: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 12) ],\n  3: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4) ],\n  4: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4), (8, -3, 'right', 4), (44,33,'right',4) ],\n  5: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4), (8, -3, 'right', 4), (44,33,'right',4) ],\n  6: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4), (8, -3, 'right', 4), (44,33,'right',4) ],\n  7: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4) ],\n  8: [ (-28, -39, 'right', 4) ]\n}\n\nWe'll write the BFS.\n\nWe set:\n\n  from collections import deque\n\n  queue = deque()\n  # start: (turn=5, y=3, path=[])\n  queue.append((5, 3, []))\n  # we'll use a visited set for (turn, y) to avoid duplicates at the same turn and y.\n  visited = set()\n  visited.add((5,3))\n\n  while queue:\n      t, y, path = queue.popleft()\n\n      # if we have reached the goal?\n      if y == 9:\n          # then we output the path\n          break\n\n      # Generate next states for the three actions.\n      for action in ['U','D','S']:\n          if action == 'U':\n              next_y = y+1\n              if next_y > 9:\n                  next_y = 9\n          elif action == 'D':\n              next_y = y-1\n              if next_y < 0:\n                  next_y = 0\n          else: # 'S'\n              next_y = y\n\n          next_t = t+1\n\n          # Check if we have visited (next_t, next_y)\n          if (next_t, next_y) in visited:\n              continue\n          visited.add((next_t, next_y))\n\n          # Check safety at (next_t, next_y): only if next_y is between 1 and 8.\n          if next_y in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:\n              # Check freeway next_y at turn next_t\n              safe = True\n              for car in freeway_cars[next_y]:\n                  # car: (head, tail, d, s)\n                  head, tail, d, s = car\n                  delta = next_t - 5\n                  if d == 'right':\n                      low = tail + s * delta\n                      high = head + s * delta\n                      if low <= 0 <= high:\n                          safe = False\n                          break\n              if not safe:\n                  continue   # skip this state\n          # else, if next_y is 0 or 9, safe\n\n          # Then we add this state\n          queue.append((next_t, next_y, path + [action]))\n\n  Then when we break, we have the path.\n\nWe break when we pop a state with y=9? Actually, we break inside the if y==9. Then we output the path.\n\nBut note: the path we have is the list of actions from turn5 to turn (t-1) for state (t,y). But at the state (t,9) we have just been popped, and we have the path that leads to (t,9). The actions in the path are for turns 5,6,...,t-1.\n\nBut the problem asks for the actions for turns: \n  Turn 5: a5\n  Turn 6: a6\n  ...\n  Turn t-1: a_{t-1}\n\nSo the path we have is of length (t-5) actions: for turns 5 to t-1.\n\nWe output:\n\n  Turn 5: a5\n  Turn 6: a6\n  ...\n  Turn t-1: a_{t-1}\n\nNow, we run the BFS.\n\nBut note: we might not get a solution in the first few steps? We have to go up 6 steps. But we might have to wait.\n\nLet me run manually for a few steps to see.\n\nWe start at (5,3) -> safe.\n\nAt turn5, we have two safe actions: U and S (D leads to collision at turn6 on freeway2).\n\n  Option1: U -> (6,4)\n  Option2: S -> (6,3)\n\nNow at turn6:\n\n  Option1: (6,4) -> freeway4: we computed at turn6: safe (as above).\n\n      Then we can do U, D, S.\n\n        U: (7,5) -> freeway5 at turn7: \n            freeway5: \n                car1: [-39+4*(7-5)= -39+8=-31, -28+8=-20] -> [-31,-20] -> no 0.\n                car2: [-3+4*2=5, 8+8=16] -> [5,16] -> no.\n                car3: [33+8=41,44+8=52] -> no.\n            safe.\n\n        D: (7,3) -> freeway3 at turn7:\n            freeway3: \n                car1: [-39+8=-31, -28+8=-20] -> safe.\n        S: (7,4) -> freeway4 at turn7:\n            freeway4: same as freeway5? \n                car1: [-31,-20] -> safe\n                car2: [5,16] -> safe\n                car3: [41,52] -> safe.\n\n  Option2: (6,3) -> freeway3 at turn6: safe (we know from above).\n\n      Then we can do U, D, S.\n\n        U: (7,4) -> freeway4 at turn7: safe (as above)\n        D: (7,2) -> freeway2 at turn7: \n            freeway2: only car: \n                at turn7: delta=2 -> [ -23 + 12*2 = 1, -12+24=12] -> [1,12] -> no 0? so safe? \n            Actually: \n                tail=-23, head=-12, s=12, delta=2: \n                low = -23 + 24 = 1\n                high = -12 + 24 = 12\n                so [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\n        S: (7,3) -> freeway3 at turn7: safe.\n\nSo we have multiple paths.\n\nBut we want the minimal H. The minimal H is 6: we need 6 moves up. So we should try to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut at turn5: we did U -> (6,4)\n\nThen at turn6: we do U -> (7,5)\n\nThen at turn7: we do U -> (8,6)\n\nAt turn8: we do U -> (9,7)\n\nAt turn9: we do U -> (10,8)\n\nAt turn10: we do U -> (11,9) -> goal.\n\nBut we have to check the safety at each step.\n\nAt turn5: we did U -> safe.\n\nAt turn6: we did U -> safe.\n\nAt turn7: we are at (7,5): freeway5 at turn7: safe (as above).\n\nAt turn7: we do U -> next state (8,6) at turn8.\n\n  Check freeway6 at turn8: \n      freeway6: \n          car1: [-39+4*(8-5)= -39+12=-27, -28+12=-16] -> safe.\n          car2: [-3+12=9, 8+12=20] -> [9,20] -> safe? 0 not in.\n          car3: [33+12=45,44+12=56] -> safe.\n\nAt turn8: we are at (8,6): safe.\n\nThen we do U: (9,7) at turn9.\n\n  freeway7 at turn9: \n      car1: [-39+4*(9-5)= -39+16=-23, -28+16=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn9: we do U: (10,8) at turn10.\n\n  freeway8 at turn10: \n      car1: [-39+4*(10-5)= -39+20=-19, -28+20=-8] -> [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10: we do U: (11,9) -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: \n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n\nBut wait, we did 6 U moves? \n  Start at y=3.\n  After first U: y=4 (turn6)\n  second U: y=5 (turn7)\n  third U: y=6 (turn8)\n  fourth U: y=7 (turn9)\n  fifth U: y=8 (turn10)\n  sixth U: y=9 (turn11)\n\nSo we need 6 actions: from turn5 to turn10.\n\nThe last state is at turn11 at y=9.\n\nSo the actions are for turn5 to turn10: 6 actions.\n\nBut we have to check the safety at the intermediate states:\n\n  At turn6: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: at turn6: we computed safe.\n\n  At turn7: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn7: safe.\n\n  At turn8: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn8: safe.\n\n  At turn9: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn9: safe.\n\n  At turn10: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nSo this sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=6? We just found one.\n\nBut note: we must check if there is a sequence with H<6? Impossible because we need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, we have to check at turn10: we are at y=8 (freeway8) and we do U to go to 9 at turn11. At turn10, we are at freeway8: we checked that at turn10, freeway8 is safe. Then we do U and then at turn11 we are at 9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut let me verify freeway8 at turn10: \n  freeway8: only car: head=-28, tail=-39, s=4, delta = 10-5=5 -> \n      low = -39 + 4*5 = -39+20 = -19\n      high = -28+20 = -8\n      so [-19,-8] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn9: delta=4 -> \n  low = -39+16=-23, high=-28+16=-12 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we must check every step.\n\nWe did:\n\n  turn5: at (5,3) -> safe (freeway3: [-39,-28] -> safe)\n  turn6: at (6,4) -> freeway4: \n        car1: [-39+4= -35, -28+4=-24] -> safe\n        car2: [-3+4=1, 8+4=12] -> safe\n        car3: [33+4=37,44+4=48] -> safe\n  turn7: at (7,5) -> freeway5: \n        car1: [-39+8=-31, -28+8=-20] -> safe\n        car2: [-3+8=5,8+8=16] -> safe\n        car3: [33+8=41,44+8=52] -> safe\n  turn8: at (8,6) -> freeway6: \n        car1: [-39+12=-27,-28+12=-16] -> safe\n        car2: [-3+12=9,8+12=20] -> safe\n        car3: [33+12=45,44+12=56] -> safe\n  turn9: at (9,7) -> freeway7: \n        car1: [-39+16=-23, -28+16=-12] -> safe\n  turn10: at (10,8) -> freeway8: \n        car1: [-39+20=-19, -28+20=-8] -> safe\n\nAnd then at turn11: (11,9) -> goal.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=6, so t from 0 to 5: that is 6 actions: for turns 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSo the above.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway2? We avoided it by not going down at the first step. And we went up continuously and didn't go to freeway2.\n\nIs there a faster way? We need 6 moves up. So we cannot do less than 6.\n\nBut what if we go down and then up? That would be more moves. So 6 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n\nBut note: at turn10 we are at y=8 and we do U to go to 9. But we must ensure that at turn10 we are safe at freeway8, which we did.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check if at any of the freeways we are on, there is a car that we missed? For example, freeway2: we never go there. But freeway4,5,6,7,8 we checked.\n\nWe did not go to freeway1,2,3 after the start? Actually, we started at freeway3 (turn5) and then went to freeway4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut note: at turn5 we started at freeway3, then at turn6 we are at freeway4, etc.\n\nSo we have the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 6 and the sequence is 6 U's.\n\nBut let me see if there is any problem with the car on freeway2? We avoided it by going up.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? In this case, we didn't have to wait.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We found H=6.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the action at turn10 is the last one (the sixth) and then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nWe are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 5 to turn 10, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 11.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 5 (y=3)**: Freeway 3 has a car with span \\([-39, -28]\\) at turn 5. 0 is not in \\([-39, -28]\\), so safe.\n- **Turn 6 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 has cars:\n  - \\([-35, -24]\\): 0 not in span.\n  - \\([1, 12]\\): 0 not in span.\n  - \\([37, 48]\\): 0 not in span.

Goal reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids all car collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: The player's movement is only vertical. The x-coordinate is always 0.\n\nPlayer actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: same y). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCar movement: All cars are moving either left or right. In this problem, note that the car state is given for freeways 1 to 8. The cars are moving with constant speed. The update for a car at turn T (from the initial turn t1=6) is:\n\nFor a car at t1 with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- If left-moving: then at T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving: then at T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, observe that for right-moving cars, the head is the front (which is the larger x-coordinate) and tail is the rear (smaller x-coordinate). So for a right-moving car, we have [tail, head] at t1? Actually, the table says for right-moving: (head, tail, right, speed). But in the update rule, for right-moving, the span at T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. This implies that at time t1, the span is [tau, h] (with tau <= h). Similarly, for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, tau] (with h >= tau, and then the car moves left so the head and tail both decrease by s per turn).\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nAll cars in the given state are right-moving? The direction is \"right\". So for each car, we have (head, tail, right, speed). Then at time t1=6, the span of a car is [tail, head] (because the update rule for right-moving says: at T, [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and at T=t1, it would be [tau, h]). So we must interpret the given (head, tail) as the head being the front (larger x) and tail the rear (smaller x). Therefore, the span at t1 is [tail, head].\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and if there is a car on that freeway whose span at turn T contains 0, then collision.\n\nNote: The player is on freeway y at turn T if at the beginning of turn T they are at (0, y) and they will be on that freeway for the entire turn? Actually, the update happens at the end of the turn? But note the collision condition is checked at the turn T: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T (after the action of turn T?).\n\nLet me read the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". This means that at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T (the starting y at the beginning of the turn) for the entire turn. Then at the end of the turn, they move to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo, during turn T, the player is at y_T. Therefore, if at turn T, the freeway y_T has a car whose span at turn T includes 0, then collision.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on a freeway y (1<=y<=8) at any turn T if there is a car on that freeway at turn T that covers x=0.\n\nOur plan: We start at turn 6 at y=4. We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, but we must avoid being at a freeway y (1..8) when a car is covering 0 at that turn.\n\nNote: y=0 and y=9 are safe because there are no cars (freeways are only y=1..8). So we can be at y=0 or y=9 without worrying about cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns from y=4 to y=9 is 5 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways we pass through.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We need to check for each freeway we are on at each turn, whether at that turn there is a car on that freeway that covers x=0.\n\nLet me write the car states for each freeway at turn t1=6 (current turn):\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car1: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, 4) -> at T, span = [-35 + 4*(T-6), -24 + 4*(T-6)]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,4) -> [1+4*(T-6), 12+4*(T-6)]\n  Car3: (48,37,right,4) -> [37+4*(T-6), 48+4*(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 2:\n  Car1: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12*(T-6), 0+12*(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 3:\n  Car1: (-24,-35,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car1: [-35+4*(T-6), -24+4*(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 4:\n  Same as freeway1: three cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 7: \n  Car1: (-24,-35,right,4) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  Car1: (-24,-35,right,4) -> same.\n\nNow, we are at turn 6, at y=4. We are on freeway 4 at turn 6. So we must check if at turn 6, freeway4 has a car that covers 0.\n\nFor freeway4 at T=6:\n  Car1: [ -35 + 4*(0) = -35, -24] -> doesn't cover 0.\n  Car2: [1, 12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]? 0 is less than 1 -> no.\n  Car3: [37,48] -> no.\n\nSo at turn6, we are safe at y=4.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9. We can only move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe are at y=4 at turn6. We want to minimize H (the number of turns including the starting turn? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions? But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning at turn t1 (t=0) we take the first action, and then we take actions until turn t1+H-1. Then at the end of H actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). Actually, the player update: after an action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. So:\n\nAt turn t1 (turn6), we are at y4. Then we choose an action a6, which will lead to y7 (at turn7). Then at turn7 we choose a7, and so on, until we are at y9.\n\nWe require that at the last turn (say turn T) we have y_T = 9. And we want the minimal H such that we have a sequence of H actions that gets us from the state at turn6 to y=9 at the end of the last action.\n\nBut note: the last action is taken at turn (t1 + H - 1). Then the position becomes y_{t1+H} = 9? Actually, the state after H actions: we start at turn6 (initial state) and take H actions (from t6 to t6+H-1), then the position at turn6+H is the result. But we require the position at turn6+H-1 to be (0,9)? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we require that \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nLet me clarify: \n- At the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,4).\n- We take action a_{t1} (at turn t1) and then we move to (0, y_{t1+1}) at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n- Similarly, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0, y_{t1+H-1}), and we take action a_{t1+H-1} and then we become at (0, y_{t1+H}) at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Actually, it says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. But note: we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? We do: the sequence goes up to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nActually, the sequence has H actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. And the position after these actions is y_{t1+H}. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning at the beginning of the turn? Or at the end of the last action?\n\nThe problem states: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nReading carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). But note that we take an action at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we move to y_{t1+H}. But we don't require anything about y_{t1+H}. We only require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut wait: the player update: at the beginning of turn t, the player is at (0,y_t). Then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo the position at the beginning of turn t is y_t. We require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note: we are at turn t1 at the beginning: y6=4. Then we take H actions: from turn6 to turn6+H-1. Then at the beginning of turn6+H-1, we are at y_{6+H-1}. We require that to be 9.\n\nHow many turns of actions? We take H actions: at turns 6, 7, ..., 6+H-1. Then at the beginning of turn 6+H-1, we are at the position that results from the first H-1 actions? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn6 is given. Then:\n\n- Beginning of turn6: y6 = 4.\n- We take action a6 -> then at the beginning of turn7: y7 = y6 + delta(a6).\n- ...\n- At the beginning of turn (6+k): y_{6+k} = y_{6+k-1} + delta(a_{6+k-1})\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn (6+H-1): y_{6+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note that the last action we take is at turn 6+H-2? Because the actions are from t=0 to H-1: so the actions are at turns: 6, 6+1, ..., 6+H-1? That would be H actions. Then the state at the beginning of turn 6+H is the result after the last action. But we require the state at the beginning of turn 6+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\n- Action at turn6: leads to y7 at turn7.\n- ...\n- Action at turn (6+H-2): leads to y_{6+H-1} at the beginning of turn (6+H-1).\n\nSo we take H-1 actions? Because the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? Then the actions are at turns: 6+0, 6+1, ..., 6+H-1? Then we take H actions. Then the state at the beginning of turn (6+H) is y_{6+H}. But we require the state at the beginning of turn (6+H-1) to be 9.\n\nThat means we require that after H-1 actions (which take us from turn6 to turn6+H-1) we are at 9. But then we are taking one extra action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. Then we must have:\n\ny_{t1} = 4 (given)\nafter a_{t1} (first action): y_{t1+1} = ... \n...\nafter a_{t1+H-1} (last action): y_{t1+H} = ?\n\nBut the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? But that action might change the position? \n\nBut note: if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can choose an action that doesn't move (S) and then we remain at 9. But the requirement is only that we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn. Then we can take any action? Actually, the problem doesn't require the last action to be S. It only requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nHowever, if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take an action (say U) we would go to 10 which is invalid? But the rule says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go above 9. Therefore, if we are at 9, we must choose S or D? But if we choose D we go to 8, which is not 9. So to remain at 9, we must choose S? Or if we are at 9, we can only choose S or D? But D would move us to 8. So the only safe way to remain at 9 is to choose S? \n\nBut the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn. But we don't care about what happens after? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we don't require to stay at 9 for the next turn? We just require that at the beginning of that turn we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we are taking an action at that turn. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 and we take an action that moves us down (D) then we leave 9. But that's acceptable because we already achieved 9 at that turn.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then the next action might move us away. But the requirement is only that we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut we want to minimize H. So we can stop as soon as we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn. And then we take an action? But the sequence must include that action? \n\nThe sequence has H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the condition is that at the beginning of that same turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. How can that be? \n\nAt the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}. Then we move to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have arrived at 9 at the beginning of that turn. That means that the previous action (at turn t1+H-2) must have moved us to 9? \n\nBut then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken while we are at 9. \n\nSo the minimal H: we start at turn6 (y=4). We want to be at 9 at the beginning of some turn T. Then H is defined such that T = t1+H-1 => H = T - t1 + 1 = T - 5? (since t1=6, so H = T - 5).\n\nBut we want to minimize H, so minimize the number of turns from the current turn (turn6) to the turn T when we are at 9. The minimal number of moves to go from 4 to 9 is 5 moves (if we go up every move). Then we would be at 9 at the beginning of turn6+5 = turn11? \n\nLet me compute:\n\n- Turn6 (beginning): y6=4.\n- Action a6: U -> then at turn7: y7=5.\n- a7: U -> turn8: y8=6.\n- a8: U -> turn9: y9=7.\n- a9: U -> turn10: y10=8.\n- a10: U -> turn11: y11=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. Then T=11. Then H = T - t1 + 1 = 11-6+1 = 6? But we took 5 actions: from turn6 to turn10. Then the sequence has H=6 actions? But we only took 5? \n\nAlternatively, the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1. So if H=6, then the actions are for turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11? But we don't need an action at turn11 because we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn11. \n\nBut note: the condition is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. If we set H=6, then we require at the beginning of turn 6+6-1 = turn11 to be at 9. And we are. Then the sequence must have 6 actions: for turns 6,7,8,9,10,11. But at turn11, we are at 9 at the beginning. Then we take an action at turn11? But then we might move away? But that's acceptable. We can choose any action? However, we must avoid collisions? But at turn11, we are at y=9, which is safe. Then we can choose S to stay. \n\nBut is it necessary to take an action at turn11? The problem requires a sequence of H actions that gets us to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we are taking an action at that turn? So the minimal H would be 6? But we could be at 9 at an earlier turn?\n\nWait: we can get to 9 in 5 moves? Then we would be at 9 at the beginning of turn11? Actually, with 5 moves we get to turn11. Then the turn at which we are at 9 is turn11. Then H = (11 - 6) + 1 = 6? \n\nAlternatively, let me define T as the turn at which we are at 9. Then T = 6 + k, where k is the number of actions taken from turn6 to turn (6+k-1) to get to 9 at turn (6+k). Then the number of actions is k. Then the sequence has k actions? But the condition is that at the beginning of turn (6+k) we are at 9. Then the turn we are at 9 is T = 6+k. Then the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. So 6+k = 6+H-1 => H-1 = k => H = k+1.\n\nSo H = k+1, meaning the sequence has k+1 actions? But we only took k actions to get to turn 6+k. Then the last action (the k+1-th) would be at turn 6+k? Then at the beginning of turn 6+k we are at 9, and then we take an action at that turn? \n\nYes, so we must take an extra action at the turn when we are at 9. Therefore, the minimal H is 6: 5 moves to get to 9 at turn11, and then one more action at turn11 (which we can set to S). But that is 6 actions.\n\nBut we might get there earlier? We start at y=4 at turn6. We can only move one step per turn. So the earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn11 (because 4 to 9 is 5 steps, so we need 5 moves: from turn6 to turn10, arriving at turn11). \n\nSo minimal H is 6? But we have to avoid cars. So we must check if the direct path (UUUUU) is safe.\n\nLet me check the freeways we pass through:\n\n- At turn6: we are at y=4 (freeway4) -> we already checked: safe at turn6.\n- Then we move to y=5 at turn7: so at turn7, we are at freeway5.\n- Then at turn8: freeway6.\n- Then turn9: freeway7.\n- Then turn10: freeway8.\n- Then turn11: we are at y=9 (safe).\n\nNow, we must check for each of these turns (6,7,8,9,10) the freeway we are on and whether a car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are only on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 during turns 6 to 10.\n\nWe have to check:\n\nTurn6: freeway4 -> we did: safe.\n\nTurn7: freeway5 -> check at T=7 (relative to t1=6: T=7 is 1 turn after)\n  For freeway5: same as freeway1? It has three cars: \n      car1: [-35+4*(7-6)= -31, -24+4= -20] -> [-31,-20] -> doesn't cover 0.\n      car2: [1+4*(1)=5, 12+4=16] -> [5,16] -> doesn't cover 0.\n      car3: [37+4=41,48+4=52] -> no.\n  So safe.\n\nTurn8: freeway6 -> same as above? \n  T=8: \n      car1: [-35+4*(2)= -27, -20] -> safe.\n      car2: [1+8=9, 12+8=20] -> safe.\n      car3: [37+8=45,48+8=56] -> safe.\n\nTurn9: freeway7 -> freeway7 has only one car: \n      car1: [-35+4*(3)= -23, -24+12= -12?] -> wait: \n      T=9: 9-6=3 turns -> [-35+4*3 = -35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> doesn't cover 0? \n      Actually, -23 to -12: 0 is not in between. So safe.\n\nTurn10: freeway8 -> same car as freeway7? \n      T=10: 10-6=4 -> [-35+4*4=-35+16=-19, -24+16=-8] -> [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nSo the direct path is safe? Then we can do:\n\nTurn6: U -> to 5\nTurn7: U -> to 6\nTurn8: U -> to 7\nTurn9: U -> to 8\nTurn10: U -> to 9\nThen at turn11 we are at 9. But the problem requires that at the beginning of turn11 (which is the turn for the last action) we are at 9. Then we must take an action at turn11? \n\nThe sequence must have H=6 actions? Then:\n\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S (or any, but we choose S to stay)\n\nBut note: at turn11 we are at y=9, which is safe. Then we can do S.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is to reach (0,9) at the beginning of turn11. Then we take an action at turn11. But we have already reached. So the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me check the freeway at turn11: we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8), so no car to collide. So safe.\n\nHowever, is there any car that might hit at turn11? We are at y=9, so no.\n\nBut wait: the direct path we checked only the freeways we were on during the moves. We were on freeway4 at turn6, freeway5 at turn7, etc. and we saw no collision. Then we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway2? We never went to freeway2. So we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6? But let me double-check the car on freeway2 at turn7? We don't go to freeway2. We are at freeway5 at turn7.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions only on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to go up every turn until we reach 9, and then at the last turn (turn11) we do S.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is from turn6 to turn11? Then H=6.\n\nBut let me see the answer format: we have to output:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nBut note: at turn11 we are at 9 and we do S, so we stay at 9. But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9, which we are. Then we do S and then at turn12 we are still at 9? But that's beyond the requirement.\n\nBut the problem only requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11. So we have met the condition at the beginning of turn11. The action at turn11 is taken and then we move to turn12. But we don't care about turn12.\n\nSo this is acceptable.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer than 6 actions? We need at least 5 moves to get from 4 to 9. Then we need an extra action at the arrival turn? So minimal H is 6.\n\nBut wait: what if we reach 9 at an earlier turn? We start at turn6 at y=4. We cannot jump. So the earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn11. So no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut we must re-check the cars at the turns we are on the freeways. We did that and found safe. But let me check freeway2 at turn6? We are not on freeway2 at turn6, so we don't care. However, note that freeway2 has a car: (0,-11,right,12) at turn6.\n\nAt turn6: \n  freeway2: car1: [-11+12*(0)= -11, 0] -> so the span is [-11,0]. Does that include 0? Yes, because 0 is the right endpoint. \n\nBut we are at freeway4 at turn6, not freeway2. So we are safe.\n\nNow, what about at turn7? freeway2: at turn7: T=7 -> [-11+12*1=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> doesn't include 0? \n\nBut we are at freeway5 at turn7, so we don't care.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway2? We don't.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nBut wait: there is a car on freeway2 at turn6 that covers 0? But we are not on freeway2 at turn6. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for H=6, t from 0 to 5.\n\nt=0: turn6\nt=1: turn7\n...\nt=5: turn11\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nBut note: at turn11 we do S. However, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn11. Then we do S, and we remain at 9. \n\nBut the problem does not require that we stay at 9 beyond the beginning of that turn. It only requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11. So we are.\n\nTherefore, this is a solution.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we can do without the last S? That is, can we have H=5? Then we require that at the beginning of turn 6+5-1 = turn10 we are at 9.\n\nBut we cannot be at 9 at the beginning of turn10: we start at 4 at turn6. Then:\n\nturn6: U -> turn7:5\nturn7: U -> turn8:6\nturn8: U -> turn9:7\nturn9: U -> turn10:8\n\nSo at the beginning of turn10 we are at 8. Then we take an action at turn10: if we do U, then at turn11 we become 9. But that is after turn10. So at the beginning of turn10, we are at 8, not 9. Therefore, we cannot achieve 9 at the beginning of turn10. The earliest is turn11.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we might take a different route? For example, go up faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr maybe we can skip some freeways by going up and down? But that would take more turns. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and in the answer we write \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut note: the turn numbers: the sequence of actions is for turns 6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut I have a doubt: at turn6, we are at y=4. Then we do U: then we move to y=5 at turn7. Then we are at freeway5 at turn7. We checked that at turn7, freeway5 is safe. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut what about freeway2? There is a car on freeway2 at turn6 that covers 0? But we are not on freeway2 at turn6. So it's safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway2 at turn6: \n  car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at turn6: span = [-11+0, 0+0] = [-11,0]. This includes 0? Yes. \n  So if we were on freeway2 at turn6, we would collide. But we are on freeway4 at turn6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn7, freeway2: \n  [ -11 + 12*(1) = 1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nBut we are not on freeway2 at turn7.\n\nSo the solution is safe.\n\nBut note: freeway2 at turn6 has a car covering 0. What if we had to cross freeway2? We don't in this path.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check freeway3: we never go there. Similarly, freeway1, etc.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6 and the sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nFor t=0: a6\nt=1: a7\n...\nt=5: a11\n\nSo we have 6 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc. So we write the turn numbers explicitly.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and t1=6. So we write:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut is turn11 within the sequence? Yes, because H=6, and we start at t1=6, then the last turn for an action is t1+H-1=6+5=11.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nBut I just noticed: freeway4 at turn6: we have car2: (12,1,right,4) -> at turn6: [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0? Correct.\n\nBut what about freeway2 at turn6: [ -11, 0] -> covers 0. But we are not on freeway2.\n\nBut what if we had to go down? We don't.\n\nSo the solution is safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there is any car on freeway5 at turn7? \n\nFreeway5 has the same cars as freeway1: \n  car1: at T=7: [-35+4= -31, -24+4=-20] -> safe.\n  car2: [1+4=5, 12+4=16] -> safe.\n  car3: [37+4=41,48+4=52] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn8: same as above, but with 8-6=2 turns: \n  car1: [-35+8=-27, -24+8=-16] -> safe.\n  car2: [1+8=9,12+8=20] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn9: only one car: \n  car1: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn10: \n  car1: [-35+16=-19, -24+16=-8] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 6 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\), the player must move upwards (U) for five consecutive turns and then stay (S) on the final turn. This sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 11, meeting the requirement \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{11} = 9\\) with \\(H = 6\\).\n\nThe path and collision checks are as follows:\n- **Turn 6**: Start at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4).  \n  Cars on freeway 4 at turn 6:  \n  - \\([-35, -24]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  - \\([1, 12]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  - \\([37, 48]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  Safe. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n- **Turn 7**: At \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5).  \n  Cars on freeway 5 at turn 7 (1 turn after turn 6):  \n  - \\([-35 + 4 \\times 1 = -31, -24 + 4 \\times 1 = -20]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  - \\([1 + 4 \\times 1 = 5, 12 + 4 \\times 1 = 16]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  - \\([37 + 4 \\times 1 = 41, 48 + 4 \\times 1 = 52]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  Safe. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- **Turn 8**: At \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).  \n  Cars on freeway 6 at turn 8 (2 turns after turn 6):  \n  - \\([-35 + 4 \\times 2 = -27, -24 + 4 \\times 2 = -16]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  - \\([1 + 4 \\times 2 = 9, 12 + 4 \\times 2 = 20]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  - \\([37 + 4 \\times 2 = 45, 48 + 4 \\times 2 = 56]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  Safe. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9**: At \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7).  \n  Cars on freeway 7 at turn 9 (3 turns after turn 6):  \n  - \\([-35 + 4 \\times 3 = -23, -24 + 4 \\times 3 = -12]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  Safe. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: At \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8).  \n  Cars on freeway 8 at turn 10 (4 turns after turn 6):  \n  - \\([-35 + 4 \\times 4 = -19, -24 + 4 \\times 4 = -8]\\) → does not cover 0.  \n  Safe. Action: U, moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: At \\(y = 9\\) (no freeway, safe). Action: S to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 6\\) turns, the minimum possible, as moving from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 5 upward moves, and an additional action is needed at the turn when \\(y = 9\\) is reached.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t1=7 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head (h), tail (τ), direction (d), and speed (s). Direction is either left or right, but in the car state, all are given as \"right\", so all cars are moving right. Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-20, -31, right, 4), (16, 5, right, 4), (52, 41, right, 4)\n\nFor left-moving cars, the head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be the right end? Let's see the span update.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time t is [τ, h] and at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]. Similarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving, since direction is \"right\".\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, on freeway 1: (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nIf direction is right, and it's moving right, then head should be the right end? But here head is -20 and tail is -31, which is less than -20, so if tail is -31 and head is -20, since -20 > -31, that means the car is from -31 to -20, so head at -20, tail at -31. Since it's moving right, at time T, span should be [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-31 + sΔT, -20 + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at position (0, y_T) and for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T. That is, if the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might collide with cars on y_T if 0 in span at T. Then after moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check for collisions there.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so at time t, position is (0, y_t), then action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). If y_T is a freeway (1-8), then we need to check if for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nIf not, or if y_T=0 or y_T=9, no collision possible since no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as they are not freeways.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, current turn is t1=7, player at y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 4, from 5 to 9.\n\nBut I can do it in multiple turns, and I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, but I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car positions and how they move.\n\nAll cars are moving right with various speeds, but speeds are given; let's see the speeds.\n\nFor freeway 1: three cars, all speed 4.\n\nFirst car: head -20, tail -31, right, speed 4. So at time t, span is [τ, h] = [-31, -20]? No.\n\nIn the notation: for a car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, the head is the front, which is the right end, I think.\n\nIn the span update for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1, first car: (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nNow, tail τ = -31, head h = -20, so since h > τ, and direction right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-31, -20]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (16, 5, right, 4), so τ=5, h=16? But 5 to 16, head=16, tail=5? That seems inconsistent.\n\n(16, 5, right, 4): if head=16, tail=5, but 16>5, so if direction right, tail should be left end, head right end, so from 5 to 16, yes.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] = [5,16] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (52,41, right,4), so τ=41, h=52, span [41,52] at t1.\n\nBut t1 is turn 7.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12] at t1=7.\n\nFreeway 3: (-20,-31,right,4), same as freeway 1 first car.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4), one car.\n\nFreeway 8: (-20,-31,right,4), one car.\n\nNow, for each freeway, at any time T, we can compute the span of each car.\n\nCollision if at turn T, when player is on y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute turn number.\n\nCurrent turn t1=7.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 7 onwards to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nLet me denote ΔT = T - t1 = T - 7, so at time T, ΔT = T-7.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, at time T, span for right-moving car: [τ + s * (T-7), h + s * (T-7)] since t1=7.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and their spans as function of T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: cars:\n\n- Car A: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4, so span at T: [ -31 + 4*(T-7), -20 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\n- Car B: τ=5, h=16, s=4, span at T: [5 + 4*(T-7), 16 + 4*(T-7)]\n\n- Car C: τ=41, h=52, s=4, span at T: [41 + 4*(T-7), 52 + 4*(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car, τ=1, h=12, s=12, span at T: [1 + 12*(T-7), 12 + 12*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 3: one car, same as car A on freeway 1: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4, span [ -31 + 4*(T-7), -20 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: cars A, B, C\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: one car, same as A: [ -31 + 4*(T-7), -20 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\nFreeway 8: one car, same as A: [ -31 + 4*(T-7), -20 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\nNow, for collision on freeway k at time T, we need 0 in the span of some car on k.\n\nThat is, for some car, low <= 0 <= high, where [low, high] is the span at T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always.\n\nNow, y_T is the freeway number if between 1 and 8.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, which is set by previous actions.\n\nI need to go from y=5 at T=7 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\ny must stay in [0,9], so at y=0, cannot go down, at y=9, cannot go up, but since we want to reach (0,9), once there, we can stop.\n\nThe sequence should end when we first reach y=9, I assume.\n\nNow, minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t1+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1=7, position y_7=5.\n\nAfter action a_7, at turn 8, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nSimilarly, after a_8, y_9, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSince y starts at 5, and we want to reach 9, we need a net increase of 4, so at least 4 U actions, and no D if we want min turns, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nMinimal H could be 4 if we go up all the way, but we need to check if it's possible without collision.\n\nH is the number of turns, from action at t1 to action at t1+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, position is reached.\n\nFor example, if H=4, actions at t=7,8,9,10, position at t=11 is 9 if all U.\n\nt=7: y=5, after a_7, at t=8 y=6 if U, and so on.\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nNow, let's see for each freeway, when is it dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, for a given freeway and time T, we can find if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThen, if the player is on that freeway at that time, collision.\n\nSince we start at y=5 at T=7, and need to reach y=9.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, so at T=7, we are on freeway 5.\n\nFirst, check if at T=7, on freeway 5, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars: same as freeway 1.\n\nCar A: span at T: [ -31 + 4*(T-7), -20 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\nAt T=7, ΔT=0, span: [-31, -20] for car A\n\n0 not in [-31,-20], since -20 < 0? -20 to -31 is negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [5 +0, 16+0] = [5,16], 0 not in [5,16]\n\nCar C: [41,52], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=7, on freeway 5, no collision. Good.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: we can go up directly, or sometimes stay or go down to avoid.\n\nBut since cars are moving, we need to simulate.\n\nFirst, let's find for each y from 1 to 8, at which times it is safe to be on that y.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find times T where no car has 0 in span.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving, we need that at each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nLet's find the safe times for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: A, B, C as above.\n\nCar A: span [ -31 + 4*(T-7), -20 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\n0 in span if -31 +4(ΔT) <= 0 <= -20 +4(ΔT)\n\nSince the span is [low, high] with low <= high, so:\n\n-31 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -20 +4ΔT\n\nSo from first inequality: -31 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=31 => ΔT <= 31/4 = 7.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -20 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=20 => ΔT >=5\n\nSo for ΔT integer, ΔT >=5 and ΔT <=7 since 7.75, ΔT=5,6,7\n\nΔT = T-7\n\nSimilarly, car B: span [5 +4ΔT, 16+4ΔT]\n\n0 in this if 5+4ΔT <=0 <=16+4ΔT but 5+4ΔT >=5>0 for ΔT>=0, so low >=5>0, so 0 never in span. Since min is 5 at ΔT=0.\n\nSimilarly car C: [41+4ΔT,52+4ΔT] min 41>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only car A can cover 0, when ΔT=5,6,7.\n\nAt ΔT=5: T=12, span: -31+20 = -11, -20+20=0, so [ -11, 0 ] , 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=6: T=13, span: -31+24= -7, -20+24=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=7: T=14, span: -31+28= -3, -20+28=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=8: T=15, span: -31+32=1, -20+32=12, [1,12], 0 not in since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, before ΔT=5, low <0 but high<0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe at T=12,13,14 (ΔT=5,6,7)\n\nT=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [1 +12ΔT, 12 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1+12ΔT <=0 <=12+12ΔT\n\nBut 1+12ΔT >=1>0 for ΔT>=0, so low >=1>0, so 0 never in span. Always safe.\n\nIs that right? At ΔT=0, [1,12], 1>0. As time increases, min is 1, so 0 never covered. Yes, freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nτ=1, which is tail, left end, at T=7, [1,12], so x from 1 to 12, 0 not included. Moving right, at later times, min x increases, so never covers 0. Yes.\n\nFreeway 3: one car, same as car A: (-20,-31,right,4) or head -20, tail -31, so τ=-31, h=-20, s=4\n\nSpan [ -31 +4ΔT, -20 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span when -31+4ΔT <=0 <= -20+4ΔT\n\nSo 4ΔT <=31, ΔT<=7.75\n\n4ΔT >=20, ΔT>=5\n\nSo ΔT=5,6,7\n\nT=12,13,14 unsafe.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1, cars A,B,C, but only car A can cover 0, same as above, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 7: one car, same as car A, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, same, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, from y=5.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nAt T=7, we are at y=5, which is safe now, but will be unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are around T=12,13,14 for freeways 1,3,4,5,6,7,8, but freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2, always safe.\n\nSince we start at y=5, and need to go up to y=9, which is 4 steps up.\n\nBut from T=12 to 14, y=5 is unsafe, so if we are on y=5 at those times, collision.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways except y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is safe always.\n\nWe might need to avoid being on dangerous freeways during dangerous times.\n\nSince the only safe freeway during T=12-14 is y=2, we could go to y=2 before T=12 and stay there until after T=14, then go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so from y=2, we need to go up to 9, which is 7 steps, but we can do it over time.\n\nLet's think about the timing.\n\nCurrent turn T=7, y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: if we go up continuously, actions: U,U,U,U at t=7,8,9,10.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check for collisions during the path.\n\nAt each turn, position and time.\n\nTurn T=7: y=5, freeway 5, as we saw, at T=7, safe.\n\nAction a_7: say U, then y_8=6\n\nTurn T=8: y=6, freeway 6. Check if safe at T=8.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars same as 1, unsafe only at T=12,13,14. T=8 is before, so should be safe.\n\nAt T=8, ΔT=1, freeway 6 car A span: -31+4(1)= -27, -20+4= -16, [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [5+4=9,16+4=20], 0 not in.\n\nCar C: [41+4=45,52+4=56], not. So safe.\n\nAction a_8: U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7. Cars: one car, same as A.\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=2, span: -31+8= -23, -20+8= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAction a_9: U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8. One car, at ΔT=3, span: -31+12= -19, -20+12= -8, [-19,-8], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, y_11=9, reached (0,9), safe.\n\nBut T=11, y=9, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nNow, during this, from T=7 to 10, all freeways were safe because T<12.\n\nT=11 at y=9, safe.\n\nSo with H=4 actions: U at t=7, U at t=8, U at t=9, U at t=10, reaching y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut is this possible? At t=10, after action, y_11=9, but at turn T=10, we were at y=8, which was safe.\n\nAnd no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times: unsafe for y=1,3-8 at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut we are done by T=11, so no problem.\n\nIn this sequence, we never reach T=12, since we arrive at T=11.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 4 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at t=11.\n\nBut is there any car that could be dangerous earlier? For example, on freeway 2, but freeway 2 is always safe, and we didn't use it.\n\nIn this path, we went through y=6,7,8 at T=8,9,10, all before 12, so safe.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 5 at T=7, we did.\n\nPerhaps I should check if any freeway has cars covering 0 at other times.\n\nFor example, freeway 2: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 1: only unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nWhat about freeway 2 car: at T=7, [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nAt T=8, [1+12=13,12+12=24], [13,24], not cover 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with all U from t=7 to t=10, we reach at t=11.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=7 to t=10, so H=4 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=7, H=4, so actions at t=7,8,9,10.\n\nBut t=10 is t_1 +3, since t_1 + (H-1) =7+3=10.\n\nH=4, actions t=0 to H-1 relative, so t from 0 to 3, absolute t=7 to 10.\n\nPosition at t=11 is 9.\n\nNow, but the problem mentions that when you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn.\n\nIn this case, at each turn, when we take action, we move to new y for next turn.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, and check cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt T=7: on y=5, safe.\n\nAction U: so at T=8, y=6\n\nAt T=8: on y=6, freeway 6, at time T=8, safe as above.\n\nAction U: at T=9, y=7\n\nT=9: on y=7, freeway 7, at T=9, safe.\n\nAction U: at T=10, y=8\n\nT=10: on y=8, freeway 8, at T=10, safe.\n\nAction U: at T=11, y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer than 4 actions? To go from y=5 to y=9, we need at least 4 up actions, since each U increases by 1, and D or S would require more turns. So H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut with H=4 actions, we reach in 4 steps.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but at t=7, y=5, after one action at t=7, y=6 at t=8; after two, y=7 at t=9; after three, y=8 at t=10; after four, y=9 at t=11. Cannot be earlier.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 2 has a car with speed 12, but it starts at [1,12] at t=7, moving right, so at t=7. something, but since we are at integer times, and x integer, I assume, but the positions might not be integer, but in the span, it could be fractional, but collision is when 0 in span, which might include fractions, but since we check at integer T, and s integer, positions integer.\n\ns=4 or 12, integer, so positions integer.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 car, at T=7, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=8, [1+12=13,12+12=24], etc, never 0.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars, like car B on freeway 1: at T=7, [5,16], not 0.\n\nBut car A covers 0 only at T=12,13,14.\n\nIn our path, we are not there.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 5 at T=7: y=5, cars: car A span [-31,-20], not 0; car B [5,16], not; car C [41,52] not. Safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I should list all freeways that are unsafe at certain times.\n\nBut in this case, only T=12,13,14 for y=1,3,4,5,6,7,8, but y=2 always safe.\n\nBut since we finish by T=11, no issue.\n\nBut the player starts at y=5, and we go up directly.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 5, at T=7, car B is (16,5,right,4), which is [5,16], so at x=5 to 16, which includes x=5, but the player is at x=0, not x=5.\n\nCollision only if player at x=0, not at other positions.\n\nThe grid, player is always at x=0, y varies.\n\nCars are on the freeways at different x positions.\n\nSo only when x=0 is covered.\n\nIn car B, [5,16], x=5 to 16, 0 not included.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo it seems the direct path works.\n\nBut let me see the initial state again.\n\nCurrent turn t1=7, player at (0,5)\n\nCar state:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-20,-31,right,4) which is tail -31, head -20; (16,5,right,4) tail 5, head 16; (52,41,right,4)? (52,41,right,4), head=52, tail=41, so if direction right, head should be larger, 52>41, so span [41,52]? τ=41, h=52, so [41,52].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 3: (-20,-31,right,4), same as above [ -31,-20]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 1\n\nFreeway 5: same as 1\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nNow for freeway 5 at T=7: cars:\n\nCar A: [ -31, -20] , 0 not in\n\nCar B: [5,16], 0 not in (5>0)\n\nCar C: [41,52], 0 not in\n\nSafe.\n\nAt T=8, if we go to y=6, freeway 6 same cars, at ΔT=1, car A: [-31+4= -27, -20+4= -16] not cover 0\n\nCar B: [5+4=9,16+4=20] not\n\nCar C: [45,56] not\n\nSimilarly, T=9, y=7, freeway 7: one car, at ΔT=2, [-31+8= -23, -20+8= -12] not cover 0\n\nT=10, y=8, freeway 8: at ΔT=3, [-31+12= -19, -20+12= -8] not cover 0\n\nThen T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nIn our case, when we move, for example at T=7, we are on y=5, take U, so we move to y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt turn T=7, we are on y=5, not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, but we didn't use it.\n\nI think H=4 is possible.\n\nBut let me see if there is any car that could be at 0 earlier.\n\nFor example, car on freeway 2: at T=7, [1,12], not 0.\n\nAt T=6, before t1, but we don't care about past.\n\nAt T=7, it is at [1,12], moving right.\n\nThe earliest it could cover 0 is if at some T, low <=0, but low=1+12ΔT, at ΔT=0, low=1>0, so never <=0.\n\nSimilarly, for car A type, low=-31+4ΔT, which becomes positive at ΔT=8, T=15, but at that time high=12>0, but since low=1>0, not cover 0.\n\nOnly when low <=0 and high >=0.\n\nFor car A, low <=0 when ΔT <=7.75, high >=0 when ΔT >=5.\n\nSo only ΔT=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think direct up is fine.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should output.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=4.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 2: it has speed 12, which is fast, but since it starts at x=1, moving right, it never hits x=0.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars near 0 except the car A types which hit later.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, car B at [5,16] at T=7, but not at 0.\n\nSo I think the sequence is: all U for 4 turns.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=7 to t=10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for t_1=7,\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut is turn 10 included? t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1 =7 to 10, yes.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be unsafe.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the turn we are on the current freeway.\n\nFor example, at T=7, on y=5, safe.\n\nAfter action U, at T=8, on y=6, which is freeway 6, safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNo move to same y, all changes.\n\nBut in this case, no stay or down.\n\nPerhaps it is minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we want to go faster, but cannot.\n\nOr slower, but H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo I think H=4 is correct.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, there is car B (16,5,right,4), which at T=7 is [5,16], so it covers x=5 to 16, but player at x=0, not affected.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head, for car B, (16,5,right,4), if head is 16, tail is 5, so from x=5 to x=16.\n\nYes.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4, with sequence U,U,U,U starting from t=7.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc, so with t_1=7.\n\nAnd since H=4, four actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H, but the sequence implies H.\n\nIn the box, just the actions.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The direct path from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires exactly 4 \"Up\" (U) actions, as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1, resulting in a net increase of 4. This can be achieved in 4 turns (actions at turns 7 to 10), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- Collisions occur only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and there exists a car on that freeway such that \\(x = 0\\) is within the car's span at time \\(T\\).\n- The car spans and movements were analyzed for all freeways at relevant times (turns 7 to 11). Key findings:\n  - Freeway 2 (\\(y = 2\\)) is always safe, as its car (span [1, 12] at \\(T=7\\), moving right at speed 12) never covers \\(x = 0\\).\n  - Freeways 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have cars that cover \\(x = 0\\) only at turns 12, 13, and 14 (due to cars like (-20, -31, right, 4) covering [ -11, 0 ] at \\(T=12\\), etc.).\n  - At turns 7 to 10, all freeways from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe:\n    - Turn 7 (\\(y=5\\)): Freeway 5 cars: [-31, -20], [5, 16], [41, 52] — no \\(x=0\\) coverage.\n    - Turn 8 (\\(y=6\\)): Freeway 6 cars at \\(\\Delta T=1\\): [-27, -16], [9, 20], [45, 56] — no \\(x=0\\) coverage.\n    - Turn 9 (\\(y=7\\)): Freeway 7 car at \\(\\Delta T=2\\): [-23, -12] — no \\(x=0\\) coverage.\n    - Turn 10 (\\(y=8\\)): Freeway 8 car at \\(\\Delta T=3\\): [-19, -8] — no \\(x=0\\) coverage.\n- The sequence of U actions from turn 7 to turn 10 avoids all collisions, as the dangerous times (turns 12–14) are after the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 11.\n- \\(H = 4\\) is minimal because fewer actions cannot achieve the required \\(+4\\) change in \\(y\\) (each non-U action would require more turns).\n\n### Sequence\nThe minimal sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y=6\\).\n- At turn 8, move up to \\(y=7\\).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y=8\\).\n- At turn 10, move up to \\(y=9\\), reached at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving right or left with given speeds, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, no car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], since head and tail are given with head > tail for right-moving, I assume.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. So for right-moving, the head is at h, tail at τ, with h > τ, I think, but in the table, for example, freeway 1: (-16,-27,right,4). -16 and -27, -16 > -27, so head is -16, tail is -27, which is left, but since it's moving right, the span is from left to right, so at t_1, position from τ to h, which is -27 to -16.\n\nSimilarly, (20,9,right,4), head 20, tail 9, so from 9 to 20.\n\nAnd (56,45,right,4) from 45 to 56.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, and speeds are given.\n\nt_1 is the current turn, which is 8.\n\nSo at turn t_1 = 8, the state is given.\n\nI need to find actions from turn t_1 onwards, so from turn 8.\n\nPlayer position at turn t_1 is (0,6), so y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U for up, D for down, S for stay, each changing y by +1, -1, or 0, clamped to [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway k at that turn, and for that k, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nImportant point: when I move, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am on y_T, and I won't be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So for collision on freeway k at turn T, it only matters if I am on k at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I am moving between freeways, at the turn when I move, I am still on the starting freeway.\n\nNow, the goal is to minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and need to go to y=9, the minimum possible H without cars would be 3 turns: up three times. But with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nt_1 = 8.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, and each car on it, with (head, tail, dir, speed) at t_1.\n\nAll dir are right, speed various.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is given by:\n\nSince all moving right, Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for a car with (h, τ, right, s) at t_1.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if I am on k and for some car on k, 0 is in [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)].\n\nSince t_1=8.\n\nSet δt = T - 8, so time offset from now.\n\nSpan at time T = [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\n0 in span if τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving, as head is larger.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, so min is τ, max is h.\n\nSo 0 in [τ + s δt, h + s δt] iff τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know for which δt there is a collision at position 0.\n\nBut I only care about the freeways I might be on.\n\nSince I start at y=6 and need to go to y=9, I will be on freeways 6,7,8,9? y=9 is the goal, not a freeway. Freeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, freeways in between.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nIn the game dynamics, collision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when I am at y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\nI start at (0,6), which is on freeway y=6, I think? Position is (x,y), x=0, y=6, so on freeway y=6.\n\nSimilarly, goal is (0,9), which is not a freeway, so when I reach y=9, I am safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and then go up, or something.\n\nActions change y, so from y, I can go to y+1, y-1, or stay.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to have y_t =9 for some t.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy from action.\n\nSo when y_t =8, if I do U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=9, I can stay or whatever, but once at 9, I am done.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so when y=9, I am at the top, no freeway.\n\nNow, back to cars.\n\nFirst, list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\nFreeway 2: (24,13,right,12) only one car.\n\nFreeway 3: (-16,-27,right,4) only one.\n\nFreeway 4: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4 and 1: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\nFreeway 6: same: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\nFreeway 7: (-16,-27,right,4) only one.\n\nFreeway 8: (-16,-27,right,4) only one.\n\nNow, speeds are all 4 or 12, freeway 2 has speed 12, others speed 4.\n\nFor each, find when 0 is in the span for some car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, for a car with (h, τ, right, s), at δt, 0 in span if τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/s ≤ δt ≤ -τ/s, since s>0.\n\nτ + s δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s δt ≤ -τ ⇒ δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nAnd 0 ≤ h + s δt ⇒ s δt ≥ -h ⇒ δt ≥ -h/s\n\nSince h > τ, -h/s > -τ/s? h > τ, so -h < -τ, since negative, so -h/s < -τ/s because s>0.\n\nLet's think numerically.\n\nFor example, take a car like (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nh = -16, τ = -27, s=4\n\nThen δt ≥ -h/s = -(-16)/4 = 16/4 = 4\n\nδt ≤ -τ/s = -(-27)/4 = 27/4 = 6.75\n\nSince δt integer, δt from 4 to 6 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nδt ≥ -h/s = -(-16)/4 = 4\n\nδt ≤ -τ/s = -(-27)/4 = 27/4 = 6.75\n\nSince δt integer, δt ≤ 6.75, so δt ≤ 6? 6.75, so δt <=6 since δt integer? δt ≤ floor(6.75) but inequality.\n\nτ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nWith s=4, τ=-27, h=-16\n\nSo -27 + 4 δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -16 + 4 δt\n\nFirst: -27 + 4 δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4 δt ≤ 27 ⇒ δt ≤ 27/4 = 6.75, so δt ≤ 6 since δt integer? δt ≤ 6.75, so for integer δt, δt <=6.\n\nδt <= floor(6.75) =6, but let's plug in.\n\nIf δt=6, τ + s δt = -27 + 4*6 = -27 + 24 = -3 ≤0\n\nh + s δt = -16 + 24 = 8 ≥0, so 0 in [-3,8], yes.\n\nδt=7: τ + s δt = -27 + 28 =1 >0? 1 ≤0? -27+28=1, which is >0, so τ + s δt =1 >0, so 0 not <= τ + s δt? τ + s δt =1 >0, and 0 ≤ h + s δt = -16+28=12, yes, but τ + s δt =1 >0, so the left end is 1, which is >0, so 0 not in [1,12], so no.\n\nSimilarly, δt=5: τ + s δt = -27+20= -7 ≤0, h + s δt= -16+20=4≥0, yes.\n\nδt=4: τ + s δt = -27+16= -11≤0, h + s δt= -16+16=0≤0, 0=0, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nδt=4: h + s δt = -16 +16=0, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, δt=3: τ + s δt = -27+12= -15≤0, h + s δt= -16+12= -4 <0, so 0 not <= -4? 0 > -4, but h + s δt = -4 <0, so 0 not in [-15,-4], since -4<0.\n\nSo for this car, 0 in span when δt=4,5,6.\n\nδt=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, for another car, (20,9,right,4)\n\nh=20, τ=9, s=4\n\nδt ≥ -h/s = -20/4 = -5\n\nδt ≤ -τ/s = -9/4 = -2.25\n\nSince δt ≥0, δt ≥0 > -5, so δt ≤ -2.25, but -2.25 <0, so for δt=0? δt ≤ -2.25, since -2.25 negative, and δt ≥0, so no overlap? Let's see.\n\nτ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\n9 + 4 δt ≤ 0? 9 +4δt ≤0 ⇒ 4δt ≤ -9 ⇒ δt ≤ -9/4 = -2.25, impossible since δt≥0.\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 20 +4δt always true since 20>0.\n\nBut τ + s δt =9 +4δt >0 for δt≥0, so left end >0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for (56,45,right,4), h=56, τ=45, s=4\n\nτ +4δt =45+4δt >0, h+4δt>0, so 0 not in span ever for δt≥0.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, car (24,13,right,12)\n\nh=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nδt ≥ -h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\nδt ≤ -τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nδt ≤ -1.083, which is negative, δt≥0, so no overlap, τ +12δt =13+12δt>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars like (-16,-27,right,4) on other freeways, same as above, 0 in span for δt=4,5,6.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the times when there is a collision at position 0, meaning for some car on that freeway, 0 is in span.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCars: (-16,-27,right,4) which causes collision at δt=4,5,6\n\n(20,9,right,4) no collision\n\n(56,45,right,4) no collision\n\nSo freeway 1 has collision only when δt=4,5,6\n\nδt is T - t_1 = T-8, so at turns T=12,13,14? t_1=8, δt=0 is T=8.\n\nδt=0: T=8\n\nδt=1: T=9, etc.\n\nFor freeway 1, at δt=4,5,6 which is T=12,13,14, collision possible.\n\nNow freeway 2: only car (24,13,right,12), no collision, as above.\n\nSo freeway 2 is always safe? At all times, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: car (-16,-27,right,4), same as above, collision at δt=4,5,6, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: cars (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\n(-16,-27) causes collision at δt=4,5,6\n\n(20,9) no\n\n(56,45) no\n\nSo same, collision only at T=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same cars, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: same cars, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 7: car (-16,-27,right,4) only, collision at δt=4,5,6, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-16,-27,right,4), collision at T=12,13,14\n\nAnd freeway 2 has no collision at any time.\n\nFreeway 2 is safe always.\n\nNow, what about other times? For example, are there cars that cause collision at other δt?\n\nFor instance, on freeway 1, the car (20,9,right,4), we saw no, because τ=9>0, and moving right, so span starts at 9 and increases.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut on freeway 2, no car covers 0 ever.\n\nNow, I start at y=6 at turn t=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimum H: if no cars, from y=6 to y=9, I can go up in 3 turns: at t=8, y=6, action U, t=9 y=7; U, t=10 y=8; U, t=11 y=9. So in 3 actions, from t=8 to t=10 actions, and at t=11 I am at y=9.\n\nt_1=8, actions at t=8,9,10, and position at t=9,10,11.\n\nAt turn T, after action, position is for that turn.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, position is (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on the position at that turn.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the vertical position at turn T.\n\nWhen I am at position (0, y_T) at turn T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I am on freeway y_T, and collision if 0 in span for some car on that freeway.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nIn the action: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only the freeway at that turn matters.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nI start at turn t=8, y=6.\n\nIf I go up directly: action at t=8: U, so y_{9} =7\n\nAt turn t=9, I am at y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nThen action U, y_{10}=8\n\nAt turn t=10, on y=8.\n\nThen action U, y_{11}=9\n\nAt turn t=11, on y=9, goal.\n\nNow, check for collision.\n\nFirst, at turn t=8, y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has cars that cause collision only at T=12,13,14, but t=8 is δt=0, which is before, so at t=8, δt=0, for freeway 6, cars: (-16,-27,4) at δt=0, τ + s*0 = -27, h+s*0=-16, both negative, so span [-27,-16], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\n(20,9,4) span [9,20], 0 not in.\n\n(56,45,4) [45,56], no. So safe at t=8.\n\nt=9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has only one car (-16,-27,4) at δt=1 (since T=9, δt=1)\n\nτ + s δt = -27 +4*1 = -23, h + s δt = -16+4= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCar (-16,-27,4) at δt=2, T=10, δt=2\n\nτ + s δt = -27 +8= -19, h + s δt= -16+8= -8, span [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11, y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut t=11 is when I reach y=9.\n\nIn this sequence, I used actions at t=8,9,10, and reached at t=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought about collision at T=12,13,14, but in this path, I am not there at those times.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=12, I would be at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut in the actions, I only go up to t=10 action.\n\nt=8: action U, to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9: action U, to y=8 at t=10\n\nt=10: action U, to y=9 at t=11\n\nSo at t=11, y=9, done. H=3 turns? From t=8 to t=10 actions, 3 actions, but H is number of turns, I think H is the number of actions, so 3 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the time.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t_1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1, and position at t_1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, actions at t=8,9,10 (which are t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2), so H=3, and at turn t=10 +1? After action at t=10, position at t=11 is y=9.\n\nTurn: after action a_t, position is for turn t+1? I think I have confusion.\n\nDefine clearly.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nThen I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars at that time.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor turn t=8, y_8=6, as given.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 is set.\n\nThen at turn t=9, position y_9.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt turn t=8: position y=6, on freeway 6. As above, no collision.\n\nAction a_8=U, so y_9=7.\n\nTurn t=9: position y=7, on freeway 7. At δt=1 (since T=9, t_1=8, δt=1), freeway 7 car: span [-27+4(1), -16+4(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_9=U, y_10=8.\n\nTurn t=10: position y=8, on freeway 8. δt=2, car span [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_10=U, y_11=9.\n\nTurn t=11: position y=9, not freeway, safe and goal.\n\nSo in 3 actions: at t=8,9,10, I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut is there any problem? The collisions are at T=12,13,14 for freeways, but I am not on freeway at t=11, and before that, at t=8,9,10, no collision.\n\nt=10 is δt=2, before the collision times δt=4,5,6.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut why do I think there might be an issue? Freeway 2 is safe, but I didn't use it.\n\nIn this path, I went directly from 6 to 7 to 8 to 9, all safe at those times.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 6 at t=8: δt=0, cars: (-16,-27,4) span [-27,-16], not cover 0.\n\n(20,9,4) span [9,20], not cover 0.\n\n(56,45,4) [45,56], not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt later times, but I am not there.\n\nSo this should work with H=3.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and this seems minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 2 is always safe, but I don't need to go there.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, at other times it might be unsafe, but at t=8 it is safe.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 6, are there cars that cause collision at other times? For example, the (20,9,4) car, but as we saw, it never covers 0 because τ=9>0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut at δt=0, all good.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be actions starting from t_1.\n\nSo for H=3, actions: turn t_1: U, turn t_1+1: U, turn t_1+2: U.\n\nt_1=8, so turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn t_1 + H -1, which is t=10, action, and position at next turn is (0,9).\n\nThe position after H actions should be at (0,9).\n\nIn terms of turns: after 0 actions, at t_1, position (0,6)\n\nAfter 1 action, at t_1+1, position ?\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t_1 + k.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T, then T = t_1 + H, because after H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, position at turn t_1 +2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H is set to (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, we need position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nAnd we have actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=3, actions at t=8,9,10, position at t=11 is (0,9).\n\nt=11 = t_1 + 3 = 8+3=11.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut why is freeway 2 mentioned? Maybe I don't need it.\n\nPerhaps at some point, if I were on y=6 at later time, but I am not.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y must be in [0,9], so if at y=0, I cannot go down, similarly at y=9, cannot go up, but in this case, from 6 to9, no issue.\n\nBut in my sequence, all good.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nFreeway 1 has cars, but I am not on freeway 1.\n\nIn the collision, it only matters for the freeway I am on at that turn.\n\nSo for my path, I am on 6,7,8 at t=8,9,10, all safe at those times.\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, safe\n\nThen y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nBut let me check if H=2 is possible.\n\nCan I reach in 2 actions?\n\nWith 2 actions, from y=6, I need to get to y=9 in two steps.\n\nPossible actions: U,U: from 6, U to 7, then U to 8, position at t=10 is y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t=10, I need position at t=10 to be 9.\n\nFrom start: at t=8, y=6.\n\nAfter a_8, y_9\n\nAfter a_9, y_10\n\nSo to have y_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 = 6 + Δy_8\n\nSo y_10 = 6 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSet this to 9, so Δy_8 + Δy_9 =3\n\nSince each Δy is -1,0,1, so only possible if both U, so Δy_8=1, Δy_9=1, then y_9=7, y_10=8.\n\ny_10=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_10=9, I need y_9=8 and Δy_9=1, or y_9=9 and Δy_9=0 or something.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nIf y_9=8, and a_9=U, y_10=9\n\nBut y_9=8, which requires from y_8=6, in one action, I can only go to 5,6,7.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_8=6, so y_9=5,6, or7.\n\nThen y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nIf y_9=7, y_10=6,7,8\n\nIf y_9=6, y_10=5,6,7\n\nIf y_9=5, y_10=4,5,6\n\nNone can be 9. y_10 max 8 if y_9=7 and U.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 in two actions from y=6. Minimum three actions.\n\nSimilarly, with one action, from y=6, y_9=5,6,7, not 9.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, with cars, it is achievable as above.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, at t=8,9,10, which are δt=0,1,2, and collision only at δt=4,5,6, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm freeway 8 at t=10.\n\nt=10, δt=2, freeway 8: car (-16,-27,4), span [ -27 + 4*2, -16 + 4*2] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut why is freeway 2 safe? Maybe if I needed to go through it, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps at t=12,13,14, freeways are unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player must avoid collisions, but in this path, no collisions.\n\nSo I think H=3 with U,U,U.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut perhaps I should write it.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because freeway 2 is mentioned and has different speed.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, if I were there at δt=4, it would be unsafe, but I am not.\n\nMaybe I need to consider if I stay, but no need.\n\nAnother point: the car on freeway 2 has high speed, but it never covers 0, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should list the collision times for completeness.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=12,13,14 (δt=4,5,6)\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nAnd at other times, all freeways are safe, except freeway 2 always safe.\n\nIn my path, I am on 6,7,8 at T=8,9,10, all safe times.\n\nT=8: all freeways safe except possibly, but freeway 6 at T=8 is safe, as δt=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", which is 3, and the sequence.\n\nBut in the initial thought, I might have overcomplicated.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, car (20,9,right,4), at δt=0, span [9,20], not cover 0.\n\nBut if I were at y=1 at some time when this car covers 0, but it never does, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother car: (56,45,right,4), span min 45>0, never cover 0.\n\nOnly the (-16,-27,4) cars cover 0 when they move to the right.\n\nAt δt=4,5,6, as above.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U,U,U.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 8: U \\\\ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut in the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H, but in the answer, it's the sequence.\n\nThe task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in answer format, it shows the sequence with turns.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTo be thorough, suppose I try to go through freeway 2.\n\nFor example, from y=6, I could go down to 5 or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor instance, if for some reason y=7 is unsafe at t=9, but in this case it is safe.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, freeway 7, δt=1, span [-23,-12], safe.\n\nIf I stayed at y=6 for one turn, then at t=9, y=6, freeway 6, δt=1, what is span?\n\nAt δt=1, freeway 6 cars: (-16,-27,4) span [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\n(20,9,4) [9+4,20+4]=[13,24], not.\n\n(56,45,4)[49,60], not.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 9, and the player is at (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves (U or D), at the next turn they are on the new row. So at turn T, if they are on row y, then at turn T they are exposed to the cars on row y. If they move at turn T to a new row, then at turn T they are still on row y (so cars on row y matter) and at turn T+1 they are on the new row (so cars on the new row matter at turn T+1).\n\nWe are to produce a sequence of actions starting at turn t_1 (which is turn 9) until we reach row 9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8. We start at y=7 and want to get to y=9. Note that y=9 is the goal and there are no freeways above y=8 (so we don't have to worry about cars on y=9). Also, the grid is from y=0 to y=9, so we can go to y=0 but that is away from the goal.\n\nThe minimal path in terms of vertical moves: from 7 to 9, we need to go up 2 steps. However, we might have to wait (or even go down) to avoid cars.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1 (turn 9). For each freeway k (which is row k) and for each car on that row, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 9.\n\nNote: For left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the update rule defines:\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLet me interpret the direction: \n- \"right\" means the car is moving to the right? Then the update rule for right-moving should be: the span at t1 is [τ, h] and then it moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\nBut in the table, for example, freeway 1: (-12,-23,right,4). \nAt turn 9: \n  For a right-moving car, the span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But note the description says: for right-moving, Span(t1)=[τ, h]. So in the tuple, the first number is head and the second is tail? Then for right-moving, the head is the front (which is to the right) and the tail is the rear? Then the span is from tail to head: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]. \n\nBut note: the update for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at time T, the car is moving right.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are to compute the car's span at any future turn T (relative to t1=9) as:\n  T_rel = T - 9\n\nSo for a car at (h, τ, d, s) at turn 9, at turn T (with T_rel = T-9) the span is:\n  if d == 'right': [τ + s * (T-9), h + s * (T-9)]\n  if d == 'left': [h - s * (T-9), τ - s * (T-9)]\n\nBut note: in the car state, all the cars are given as 'right'. So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=4) -> span at T: [ -23 + 4*(T-9), -12 + 4*(T-9) ]\n  car2: (24,13,right,4) -> [13 + 4*(T-9), 24 + 4*(T-9)]\n  car3: (60,49,right,4) -> [49 + 4*(T-9), 60 + 4*(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 2:\n  car: (36,25,right,12) -> [25+12*(T-9), 36+12*(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 3:\n  car: (-12,-23,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car1.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: same as freeway1: three cars each.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,4) -> same.\n\nWe start at y=7 at turn 9. We are on freeway 7 at turn 9? So we must check the cars on freeway 7 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, freeway 7 has one car: (-12,-23,right,4). Its span at turn 9: [ -23 + 4*(0), -12 + 4*(0) ] = [-23, -12]. 0 is not in [-23,-12] -> so safe at turn 9.\n\nBut we must plan for the future turns.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal H would be at least 2: two U moves. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nWe are at turn 9: y=7.\n\nWe consider the next moves:\n\nOption 1: Go up at turn 9 (action U) -> then at turn 10, y=8. Then at turn 10, we can go up again to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut we must check for collisions:\n\nAt turn 9: we are at y=7. We must check freeway 7 at turn 9: as above, safe.\n\nThen at turn 10: we are at y=8 (because we moved at turn 9 to y=8). At turn 10, we are on freeway 8. We must check freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 10 (T=10, T_rel=1): \n  car: (-12,-23,right,4) -> [ -23 + 4*(1), -12 + 4*(1) ] = [-19, -8]. 0 is not in [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, we do U -> at turn 11, we are at y=9 -> goal. So H=2.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway 8 at turn 10? We are safe. So that seems minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we are safe at every step.\n\nTurn 9: \n  Player at (0,7) -> freeway 7: car at [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nTurn 10: \n  Player at (0,8) -> freeway 8: car at [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nTurn 11: \n  Player at (0,9) -> goal, and no freeway at 9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says: we start at turn t_1 (which is 9) and we need to output actions for turns starting at t_1 until the turn when we reach 9. The minimal H is 2, meaning we take two actions: at turn 9 and turn 10.\n\nHowever, note that at turn 11 we are at 9, so we don't need an action at turn 11.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and H is the number of turns. So we have:\n\nH=2: actions at turn 9 and 10.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 7 at turn 9 and freeway 8 at turn 10: they are safe.\n\nBut wait, there are other freeways. But we are only on freeway 7 at turn 9 and freeway 8 at turn 10. We don't care about the others.\n\nBut what if we have to go through freeway 7 again? We are not. We are going up.\n\nBut what about freeway 8: the car on freeway 8 at turn 10 is at [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 10: T=10 -> T_rel=1 -> [-23+4*1, -12+4*1] = [-19,-8] -> yes.\n\nSo that seems safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we are only on freeways 7 and 8. So we are safe.\n\nBut is there any car on freeway 7 at turn 10? We don't care because at turn 10 we are on freeway 8. Similarly, at turn 9 we are on freeway 7 and it's safe.\n\nHowever, note that the car on freeway 7 at turn 10: we are not on freeway 7 at turn 10, so it doesn't matter.\n\nBut what if we do a different move? For example, if we stay at turn 9? Then we are at y=7 at turn 10. Then we must check freeway 7 at turn 10: \n  freeway 7: car: [ -23+4*(10-9) = -19, -12+4= -8 ] -> [-19,-8] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nBut then we have to go up twice from turn 10: so at turn 10: U -> y=8 at turn 11; then turn 11: U -> y=9 at turn 12. Then H=3, which is worse.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about the car on freeway 8 at turn 10? We saw that it is safe. But what about the car on freeway 8 at turn 11? We don't go to freeway 8 at turn 11 because we move to 9 at turn 11.\n\nBut let me check: if we do U at turn 9 and then U at turn 10, we are at y=8 at turn 10 and then at turn 11 we are at y=9. At turn 10, we are at y=8 and the car on freeway 8 is at [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, there's a car on freeway 2: (36,25,right,12) at turn 9. But we never go to freeway 2. Similarly, others.\n\nSo why am I doubting? Because I see that on freeway 2 there is a car that might be at 0 at some turn? But we are not on freeway 2 at that turn. So it's irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two up moves.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 at turn 10: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nBut what about the other cars on freeway 8? The table says freeway 8 has only one car: (-12,-23,right,4). So only one car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 has one car.\n\nBut what about freeway 1? It has three cars. But we are not on freeway 1.\n\nSo I think H=2 is safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are still on y_T. So at turn 9, we are on y=7. Then we do U: at turn 10, we are on y=8. So at turn 10, we are on freeway 8 and we check the car on freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nBut what if we do two moves: \n  Turn 9: U -> then at turn 10, we are at y=8.\n  Turn 10: U -> then at turn 11, we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn 9: we are on y=7 -> check freeway7: safe.\nAt turn 10: we are on y=8 -> check freeway8: safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut wait, what if the car on freeway 8 at turn 10 is going to cover 0? We computed: [-19,-8] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nBut let me check for turn 10: T=10 -> T_rel=1 -> [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8] -> correct.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway 8 is the same as the one on freeway 7 at turn 9? They are different freeways. They are independent.\n\nSo the car on freeway 8 is at turn 9: [-23,-12]. Then at turn 10: [-19,-8]. And we are at x=0 at turn 10 on freeway 8: 0 is not in [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, the goal is to be at (0,9). At turn 11 we are at (0,9). The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we land there. So at turn 11 we are there.\n\nBut the last action is at turn 10. So we need two actions.\n\nBut the answer format: we output actions for turn 9 and turn 10.\n\nBut what if there is a problem at turn 10? For example, if the car on freeway 8 was going to be at [ -1, 5] at turn 10, then 0 would be in that interval and we would crash. But it's not.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8 at turn 10 again: \n  T_rel = 1 -> [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8] -> correct.\n\nBut wait, the car on freeway 8: head=-12, tail=-23? Then for right-moving: [tail, head] = [-23, -12] at turn9. Then at turn10: [ -23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8] -> yes.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut why are there so many cars? Maybe to trick us? Or maybe we have to consider if we take a longer path? But we don't need to.\n\nBut what if we try to go down? That would take more steps and is unnecessary.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". H=2.\n\nBut let me check the definition of H: the minimal number of turns. And the sequence has H actions: from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the turn labels: the current turn is t_1=9, so the first action is at turn 9, then turn 10.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 2? It has speed 12. Let me see when it passes 0.\n\nFreeway2: [25+12*(T-9), 36+12*(T-9)] contains 0?\nSolve: 25+12*(T-9) <= 0 <= 36+12*(T-9)\n\nFirst inequality: 25+12*(T-9) <= 0 -> 12*(T-9) <= -25 -> T-9 <= -25/12 ≈ -2.08 -> T <= 6.92 -> so only for T<=6? But we are at T=9 and beyond, so not.\n\nSimilarly, the other cars: for example, freeway1 car1: [-23+4*(T-9), -12+4*(T-9)] contains 0?\nWe need: -23+4*(T-9) <= 0 <= -12+4*(T-9)\n\nLeft: -23+4*(T-9) <=0 -> 4*(T-9) <=23 -> T-9<=5.75 -> T<=14.75 -> so for T from 9 to 14.75, the left condition holds? But the right condition: 0 <= -12+4*(T-9) -> 4*(T-9)>=12 -> T-9>=3 -> T>=12.\n\nSo for T in [12,14] (since T is integer: T=12,13,14) the car on freeway1 will cover 0? But we are not on freeway1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, car2 on freeway1: [13+4*(T-9), 24+4*(T-9)] -> 0 in [13+4*(T-9), 24+4*(T-9)]? \n  13+4*(T-9) <=0? -> 4*(T-9)<=-13 -> T-9<=-3.25 -> T<=5.75 -> not for T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, car3: [49+4*(T-9),60+4*(T-9)] -> positive and increasing -> never covers 0.\n\nSo the only cars that might cover 0 in the near future are the ones with negative head at turn9? Like the car on freeway1,3,4,5,6,7,8 of the type (-12,-23,right,4). But they take until T>=12 to cover 0? And we are at turn9, so we are not on those freeways at T=12? We are going to be at y=9 by turn11.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is two up moves.\n\nBut wait, what if we consider that at turn9 we do S? Then we stay at y=7. Then at turn10, we are still at y=7. Then we check freeway7 at turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe. Then at turn10 we do U: to y=8 at turn11. Then at turn11, we are at y=8 and must check freeway8 at turn11.\n\nFreeway8 at turn11 (T=11, T_rel=2): [-23+4*2, -12+4*2] = [-15, -4] -> 0 not in -> safe. Then at turn11 we do U to get to y=9 at turn12. Then H=3. Worse.\n\nSo indeed, H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we do D at turn9? Then we go to y=6 at turn10. Then we have to go up 3 steps -> H=4 at best. Worse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have H=2 and the sequence above.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9). We start at (0,7). After two U moves: (0,9). Perfect.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal vertical distance to cover is 2 units (from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), requiring at least 2 turns if moving up twice.\n- The car states at turn 9 are given, and all cars are right-moving. The collision condition is checked only when the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\), and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n\n#### Step-by-Step Path:\n1. **Turn 9 (current turn, \\(y = 7\\)):**\n   - Action: \\(U\\) (move up).\n   - Next position: \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n   - Collision check on freeway 7 at turn 9:\n     - Car on freeway 7: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 4)\\)\n     - Span at turn 9: \\([-23 + 4 \\times (9-9), -12 + 4 \\times (9-9)] = [-23, -12]\\)\n     - 0 is not in \\([-23, -12]\\), so safe.\n\n2. **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\)):**\n   - Action: \\(U\\) (move up).\n   - Next position: \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (goal reached).\n   - Collision check on freeway 8 at turn 10:\n     - Car on freeway 8: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 4)\\)\n     - Span at turn 10: \\([-23 + 4 \\times (10-9), -12 + 4 \\times (10-9)] = [-19, -8]\\)\n     - 0 is not in \\([-19, -8]\\), so safe.\n\nAt turn 11, the player is at (0, 9), and no further actions are needed. The sequence takes \\(H = 2\\) turns (actions at turns 9 and 10).\n\n### Why this is minimal:\n- Any sequence with \\(H < 2\\) is impossible as it requires moving 2 units vertically.\n- Alternative actions (e.g., staying or moving down) increase \\(H\\) beyond 2 and are unnecessary.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe minimal sequence of actions starting from turn 9 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=8, and the goal is y=9. Since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to y=8), I don't think there are cars on y=9, so once I'm there, I'm safe. The collision only happens if I'm on a freeway and a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player position is given as (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player, I think? The grid has vertical axis y, and horizontal position. The player is always at x=0, I believe, from the initial position (0, y_t1). And the cars are on the freeways, which are horizontal lines at y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right.\n\nThe collision condition: if at turn T, the player is at y_T, which is a freeway, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until turn T+1, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, based on action at time t.\n\nAnd for collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the y-position at turn T, I assume.\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T. If you take an action to move to a different y, at that turn T, you are still on y_T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo, for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at time T, you collide.\n\nNow, in this case, I start at (0,8) at turn t1=10. y=8 is a freeway, so I need to make sure that at the time I'm on y=8, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways if I move through them.\n\nBut my goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there.\n\nSince I start at y=8 and need to go to y=9, the minimal action might be to go up once, but I need to check if at turn t1=10, when I'm at y=8, is it safe? Or if I need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=10.\n\nFor each car, given head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection: right or left. In the car state, it's given as direction d.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-8,-19, right, 4), etc.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time t is [tau + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)], since from the update: right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check.\n\nLooking at freeway 1: (-8,-19, right, 4), (28,17, right, 4), (-48,-59, right, 4)\n\nh and tau: for right-moving, head is larger than tail? In the notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [tau, h] with tau < h, I think.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] → [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the given, for freeway 1: (-8,-19, right, 4)\n\nNow, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [tau, h] = [-19, -8]? tau = -19, h = -8, so [ -19, -8 ] which is from -19 to -8, so head at -8, tail at -19, since it's moving right, head is the front.\n\nSimilarly, (28,17, right,4) — 28 and 17, but 28>17, so [17,28]? tau=17, h=28, so [17,28].\n\nIn the list: (28,17, right,4), so h=28, tau=17, so for right-moving, span [tau, h] = [17,28].\n\nSimilarly, (-48,-59, right,4): h=-48, tau=-59, so [ -59, -48 ].\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nBut for collision, at a given turn T, for freeway k, if k is the row, and at time T, 0 is in the span of any car on that row.\n\nThe player is only affected when on that row at that time.\n\nSince I start at y=8, and want to go to y=9, which is above, so I need to take action U to go up to y=9.\n\nBut at turn t1=10, I am at y=8. If I take action U at turn 10, then at turn 11, I will be at y=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, I am on y=8, so I need to ensure that at turn 10, on freeway 8, no car has 0 in its span at time 10.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or something, but I want minimal turns, so going up directly might be best if possible.\n\nFirst, let's check freeway 8 at turn t=10.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: from table, freeway 8: (-8,-19, right, 4) and that's it? Let me see:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\nk=1: three cars\n\nk=2: one car\n\nk=3: one car\n\nk=4: three cars\n\nk=5: three cars\n\nk=6: three cars\n\nk=7: one car\n\nk=8: one car: (-8,-19, right, 4)\n\nFor freeway 8: car with h=-8, tau=-19, direction right, speed s=4.\n\nAt time T, span: since right-moving, Span(T) = [tau + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] = [-19 + 4(T-10), -8 + 4(T-10)]\n\nAt time T=10, Span(10) = [-19 + 0, -8 + 0] = [-19, -8]\n\nIs 0 in [-19, -8]? -19 to -8, all negative, 0 is not in this interval, so at t=10, on freeway 8, no car at 0.\n\nTherefore, at turn 10, since I am at y=8, and no collision, I can take action U to go to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, I am at y=9, done.\n\nBut is that it? Seems almost too easy. But let me confirm the other freeways, but I don't need to, since I only go through y=8 at t=10 and then to y=9.\n\nI start at y=8 at t=10, take action at t=10, which moves me to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=8, and we saw no collision.\n\nAt t=11, I am on y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nMinimal H=1, since one action: from t=10 to t=11.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1 + H-1, so for H=1, it would be one action at t1, leading to position at t1 +1.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =8, which is not 9.\n\nI think I miscount.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nThe position at time t1 + H -1 should be 9.\n\nSince actions from t=t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t=t1, then position at time t1 +1 should be 9? y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =8, not 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=1, y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =8, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, y_{t1 +2 -1} = y_{t1 +1} should be 9.\n\nSimilarly, position at time t is after actions up to t-1.\n\nAt time t1, position is given, (0,8).\n\nAfter action at t1, position at t1+1 is y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9, with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo H-1 is the number of actions? Let's clarify.\n\nSet t1 =10.\n\nStart at time 10, y=8.\n\nAfter action at time 10, y at time 11.\n\nAfter action at time 11, y at time 12, and so on.\n\nWe want y at some time T to be 9, with T = t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1.\n\nSince y at time 10 is 8, to reach 9, we need at least one action.\n\nSuppose we take one action: at t=10, action a10, then y11 = y10 + Delta y10.\n\nIf a10 = U, y11=9.\n\nThen y at time 11 is 9.\n\nNow, T = t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1.\n\nSet T=11, so 10 + H -1 =11, thus H=2.\n\nSimilarly, if no action, y10=8, but we need to reach 9, so must take actions.\n\nMinimal H: with one action, we can go to y=9 at time 11.\n\nBut in terms of the index, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{10 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{10+2-1}=y11=9.\n\nAnd sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 1, meaning actions at t1 +0 =10 and t1+1=11.\n\nBut we only need to specify actions until we reach, but since we reach at time 11, after action at time 10, we don't need action at time 11 if we are already at 9.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions, leading to position at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at time t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so indices from t1 to t1 + H -1, H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, position at time t1 + H.\n\nBut \"reach (0,9)\" at time t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at time t1, position is given before any action.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position at time t1+1.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, position at t1+2, etc.\n\nWe want position at some time to be (0,9).\n\nThe time when position is (0,9) is t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for that time, it is after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt time t1, before actions, position (0,8).\n\nAfter first action at t1, position at t1+1.\n\nAfter second action at t1+1, position at t1+2, etc.\n\nSo position at time t is set after the action at time t-1 for t>t1.\n\nAt time t1, position is initial.\n\nThen action at t1 changes to position at t1+1.\n\nSo position at time t1 + k is after k actions.\n\nWe want position at time t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = time after (H-1) actions.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at time t1, position y=8.\n\nAfter 1 action, at time t1+1, position y= something.\n\nWe want at time t1 + H -1, position =9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1.\n\nThen at time T, position =9.\n\nT - t1 = H -1, so number of actions is H-1? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps H includes the turns from start to end.\n\nMinimal H such that we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSince start at t1, with y=8, to reach y=9, the earliest possible is at t1+1 with action U at t1.\n\nThen at time t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo T = t1+1.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 = t1+1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nWith H=2, we have actions at t=t1 and t1+1, but we only need one action to reach at t1+1.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, but for reaching at t1+1, we only need action at t1, so for t1+1, we might not need an action, or we can have a dummy action, but the position is reached at t1+1 after one action.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, it includes a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}, but a_{t1+1} is after we are already at 9, so it might not be necessary, but the problem says \"a sequence of actions to reach\", so perhaps we stop when we reach, but the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions, but some might be irrelevant if we reach earlier.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should have the minimal number such that at t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nFor reaching at t1+1, H=2, since t1+H-1=t1+1 implies H=2.\n\nAnd actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}, but a_{t1+1} can be anything since we are already at 9, but the player might take action, but to be safe, we can set it to S or something.\n\nBut in this case, since at t1+1 we are at 9, and no freeway, no collision possible, so a_{t1+1} can be S, for example.\n\nBut for minimal turns, H=2, with one action to move up.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify both actions, but the first one is U, the second can be S or U or D, but since y=9, if we go up, y=10, but y max is 9, I think, from y in [0,9], so if y=9, U is invalid or capped? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9 and action U, y stays 9? Or it doesn't move.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, with Delta y_t based on action, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9 and action U, Delta y= +1, but y cannot be 10, so probably y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t +1) or something, but the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so it must be clipped.\n\nSimilarly for y=0 and D.\n\nBut in this case, at y=9, action U has no effect, y stays 9.\n\nSimilarly, action D would go to 8, but we don't want that.\n\nAction S stays.\n\nBut since we want to reach (0,9), once there, we can stay.\n\nBut for minimal H, we can reach at t1+1 with one action, so H=2.\n\nNow back to the collision issue.\n\nAt t=10, I am at y=8, and I want to take action U at t=10 to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=8, so need to check freeway 8 at t=10.\n\nAs before, car on y=8: (-8,-19, right, 4)\n\nAt t=10, Span(10) = [-19, -8] for this car, since right-moving, [tau + s(0), h + s(0)] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], so safe.\n\nNow, if I take U at t=10, at t=11 I am at y=9, done.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot? For example, if at t=10, on y=8 it was unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if moving to y=9 is affected, but at t=11, y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways quickly, in case I have to move through them, but I don't; I start at 8 and go directly to 9.\n\ny=8 to y=9, no intermediate freeway.\n\nSo with one action U at t=10, I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nThen for H=2, sequence: action at t=10: U, and action at t=11: since we need to specify for t=0 to H-1, which is t=10 and t=11 for H=2.\n\nAt t=11, we are at y=9, so we can set action S, for example.\n\nBut the position is already 9 at t=11, so for the sequence, a_{t1} = U, a_{t1+1} = S.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\netc.\n\nSo for t1=10, H=2.\n\nBut is H minimal? H=2 means two turns, but we reach at turn t1+1=11.\n\nPerhaps H=1 is possible? But with H=1, y at t1 +1 -1 = t1 =10 is 8, not 9, so impossible. So H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10: car span [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt other times, I don't care since I'm not there.\n\nBut just to be sure, suppose I stay at y=8 for multiple turns, I need to check safety, but I don't need to stay.\n\nSince I can move directly, no issue.\n\nBut look at freeway 8 car: it is moving right at speed 4.\n\nSpan at time T: [ -19 + 4(T-10), -8 + 4(T-10) ]\n\nSet this interval to contain 0.\n\nSo -19 + 4(T-10) <= 0 <= -8 + 4(T-10)\n\nFirst inequality: -19 + 4(T-10) <= 0 => 4(T-10) <= 19 => T-10 <= 19/4 = 4.75, so T <= 14.75, since T integer, T <=14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -8 + 4(T-10) => 4(T-10) >=8 => T-10 >=2 => T>=12\n\nSo 0 in span for T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nT=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=10, not in, as we have.\n\nt=11: span [ -19 +4(1), -8 +4(1) ] = [-15, -4], 0 not in.\n\nt=12: [ -19+8, -8+8] = [-11, 0], 0 is included, since tail at -11, head at 0? [tau + s(2), h + s(2)] = [-19 + 8, -8 +8] = [-11, 0], so from -11 to 0, so position 0 is included, since head at 0.\n\nCollision if on y=8 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly t=13: [-19+12, -8+12] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=14: [-19+16, -8+16] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=15: [-19+20, -8+20] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut at t=10, safe.\n\nNow, back to me: I only need to be at y=8 at t=10, which is safe, and I leave immediately to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut is there a car on y=9? No, freeways only 1-8.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, just in case, but I don't go there.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: car (-8,-19, right,4)\n\nSimilar to above, at t=10, span [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nUnsafe when T=12,13,14.\n\nBut I'm not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 2 has one car: (48,37, right,12)\n\nRight-moving, h=48, tau=37, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12(T-10), 48 + 12(T-10)]\n\nAt T=10: [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSet to contain 0: 37 +12(T-10) <=0 <=48 +12(T-10)\n\nFirst: 37 +12(T-10) <=0 => 12(T-10) <= -37, but left side, for T>=10, >=0, -37<0, impossible. 12(T-10) <= -37, since T-10 >=0, 12(T-10) >=0 > -37, so inequality false. Similarly, 0 <=48 +12(T-10) always true for T>=10.\n\nSo 0 never in span for this car, since it starts at 37-48 and moves right, all positions positive.\n\nSimilarly, other cars on other freeways, let's see if any can be at 0.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-8,-19, right,4), (28,17, right,4), (-48,-59, right,4)\n\nFirst car: similar to before, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: (28,17, right,4), span [17 +4(T-10), 28+4(T-10)]\n\nAt T=10: [17,28], 0 not in.\n\nSet 17+4(T-10) <=0 <=28+4(T-10)\n\nFirst: 17+4(dt) <=0, dt=T-10, 4dt <= -17, dt <= -17/4 = -4.25, impossible since dt>=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <=28+4dt, always true.\n\nSo never contains 0.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59, right,4), span [-59 +4(dt), -48+4(dt)]\n\nSet -59+4dt <=0 <= -48+4dt\n\nFirst: -59+4dt <=0 => 4dt <=59 => dt <=14.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+4dt => 4dt >=48 => dt>=12\n\nSo dt=12,13,14\n\nT=22,23,24? dt=T-10, so T=22,23,24.\n\nBut at t=10, not issue.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, all cars are similar or same.\n\nFreeway 3: only one car (-8,-19, right,4), same as before, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, all same as freeway 1, so similar.\n\nBut no car at t=10 on any freeway has 0, except possibly, but we saw not.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, at t=10, all spans negative or positive, no zero.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at t=10, all freeways are safe at position 0.\n\nBut I only care about y=8 for now.\n\nSince I can go directly to y=9, it should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in one action, with H=2.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, actions at t=10 and t=11.\n\na10: U, a11: S (or anything, but S to stay).\n\nBut since at t=11, we are at y=9, and we need to specify action, but the position is reached at t=11.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, we only need until the action that brings us to 9, but the index includes H actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to delay? For example, if at t=10, y=8 was unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nIn this case, it is safe.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8,-19, right,4)\n\nAt t=10: [-19,-8], not contain 0.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe the player must avoid being on freeway when car at 0, but at t=10, no issue.\n\nPerhaps when I take action, but the action is at time t, position at time t is before action, I think.\n\nLet me see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the state is: position y_T, then we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T, based on y_T and the car spans at time T.\n\nSo at turn T, if y_T is freeway, and car on that row has 0 in span at time T, collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=10, y=8, freeway, car span at t=10 is [-19,-8], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nI take U, so at t=11, y=9, not freeway, no collision check.\n\nDone.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nSequence: Turn 10: U, Turn 11: S\n\nBut Turn 11 action is after reaching, but we need to specify it.\n\nTo save, I could have H=1, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=10, but y=8 not 9.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the car list again; freeway 8 has only one car, and it's safe at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if moving up, but when I move, at the turn I move, I am still on the current y.\n\nBut here, at t=10, I am on y=8, safe, then I move to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNo intermediate.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no cars.\n\nSo the minimal sequence should be U at t=10, and then S at t=11, but since we reach at t=11, the action at t=11 is not necessary for reaching, but for the sequence, we include it.\n\nTo have H minimal, H=2.\n\nIf I set a_{t1+1} to U, but at y=9, U does nothing, y stays 9.\n\nOr D, goes down to 8, not good.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nIn the answer, since the position is 9 at t=11, and we can stop, but the sequence includes the action.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps the problem implies that we take actions until we reach, but the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nWith H=2, we take two actions, but after first action, we are at 9.\n\nThen second action is redundant but harmless.\n\nTo have exactly the actions to reach, but the minimal H is 2.\n\nAnother way: perhaps H is the number of turns from start, including start or not.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nWith one action, we reach at turn t1+1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this case, it should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut let's write in the box.\n\nBut t1=10.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because the car list has many cars, but I didn't use them, since I don't go through other rows.\n\nPerhaps the player is at (0,8), but to go to (0,9), it's adjacent.\n\nUnless y=8 is blocked at that time, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the time when I arrive, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the note says if I move to different y, I am not on new y until next turn.\n\nBut here, I move to y=9 at t=11, and at t=11, y=9 not freeway, so no issue.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from t=10 to t=11.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one action, but then H=1, y at t1=10 is 8, not 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: S }\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=10, so Turn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1 +1: a_{t1+1} = S\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise, since after a_{t1} = U, at time t1+1=11, y=9, reached.\n\nThen a_{t1+1} = S is fine.\n\nIf I set a_{t1+1} = U, it stays at 9, same.\n\nBut S is safer, I think, no move.\n\nBut in terms of collision, at y=9, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 8\\), which is a freeway. The car on freeway 8 at turn 10 has a span of \\([-19, -8]\\) (since it is right-moving with speed 4, and at \\(T = 10\\), \\(\\text{Span}(10) = [-19 + 4(0), -8 + 4(0)] = [-19, -8]\\)). Since 0 is not in \\([-19, -8]\\), there is no collision at turn 10.\n\nTaking action \\(U\\) at turn 10 moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. Position \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, so no collision check occurs at turn 11. Thus, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 11.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 2, as \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{10 + 2 - 1} = y_{11} = 9\\). The sequence of actions includes:\n- Action at turn 10: \\(U\\) to move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- Action at turn 11: \\(S\\) (stay) since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), and no further movement is needed.\n\nNo other freeways are involved, as the player moves directly from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) without traversing intermediate freeways.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S }",
