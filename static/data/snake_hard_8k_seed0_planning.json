        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the grid size.\n\nThe walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles are given. So the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6) because the borders are walls. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, and y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 as well.\n\nBut let's list all wall cells: border walls are all cells where x=0 or x=7 for any y, and y=0 or y=7 for any x. But since it's a grid, the corners are included. Also internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)]\n\nSo, to avoid collision, the snake cannot move to any of these cells.\n\nNow, snake positions: only [(3,3)], so it's a single segment snake, just the head. Head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, and life span 10, which decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=0.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, eating food will increase length. After eating, the snake grows, so the tail stays where it is until it moves, but since it's one segment, after eating, it becomes two segments.\n\nLet me denote the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where internal obstacles are.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\n- Border walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since the snake starts at (3,3), which is inside, we care about the playable area.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is an obstacle, which is below (3,3).\n\nSnake head at (3,3), direction L, so it can move U, D, L, R, but since direction is L, it cannot move R immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: U, D, L (since L is current direction, moving left is allowed, but moving right would be reverse, not allowed).\n\nNo instant reverse means cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move R on this turn.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- U: (3,4)\n\n- D: (3,2) but (3,2) is an obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- L: (2,3)\n\n- R: (4,3) but cannot because reverse not allowed, and also, is (4,3) free? Let's see.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,4) - is this wall? y=4, x=3, not border, and not in internal obstacles? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n- Down: (3,2) - but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Left: (2,3) - (2,3) not in obstacles, so free.\n\n- Right: (4,3) - not in obstacles, but moving right is opposite to current left direction, so not allowed.\n\nTherefore, possible moves: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3). D is blocked by wall, R not allowed.\n\nNow, food is at (4,5), (3,6), (2,6).\n\n(4,5) is up-right from (3,3), (3,6) is up, (2,6) is up-left.\n\nSince snake is short, I need to eat food to grow, but carefully.\n\nAlso, with life span, all food has life 10, so plenty of time, but I should plan multiple turns.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid coordinates for clarity.\n\nAssume x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: borders are walls, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls.\n\nSpecifically, for movement, we care about cells snake can be on: (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSo, free cells: all from (1,1) to (6,6) except those 8 points.\n\nFor example, row y=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, so free: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (6,1) — (5,1) blocked, (6,1) is x=6,y=1, not border? Border is x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, but (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,1) not listed, so free except (5,1) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) but (3,2) obstacle, so free: (1,2), (2,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\n(3,2) blocked, so (1,2), (2,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) free? (4,2) not listed, yes.\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) but (6,3) obstacle, and (3,3) snake head, so free: (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3) — (6,3) blocked.\n\n(3,3) occupied by snake, but for movement, we can move to empty cells.\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) but (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) obstacles, so free: (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n(1,4) blocked, (2,4) blocked, (4,4) blocked, so only (3,4), (5,4), (6,4) free? (5,4) not listed as obstacle, yes; (6,4) not listed.\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) but (1,5) obstacle, so free: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(4,5) has food, but it's free to move to.\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) but (1,6)? (1,5) is obstacle, but y=6: (1,6) not listed? Internal obstacles: (5,6) and (1,5), (1,5) is y=5, so for y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so free: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (6,6) — (2,6) has food, (3,6) has food.\n\n(1,6) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free, but let's confirm internal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5) — (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,6) is not listed, so (1,6) is free? Similarly, (1,3) should be free, etc.\n\nBack to snake at (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3)\n\n(3,4) is free, as above.\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nNow, food: (4,5), (3,6), (2,6)\n\n(3,6) is directly above, at (3,6), which is two steps up from (3,3): to (3,4) then to (3,5) then to (3,6), but (3,5) is free, as per y=5.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is left and up.\n\n(4,5) is right and up.\n\nSince I can only move U or L now.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then from there, I can go to (3,5) or other directions.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3), then from there.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to food.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so the tail will be behind.\n\nCurrently, no tail, so after eating first food, length becomes 2.\n\nNow, life span: all food has life 10, so I have time, but I should go for the closest or safest.\n\nLet's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen snake moves to (3,4), and since it ate nothing, positions: [(3,4)] still length 1, direction now U? After moving, direction changes to the move direction.\n\nCurrent direction was L, but after moving U, new direction is U.\n\nThen at turn 1, from (3,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse: since direction U, cannot move D.\n\n(3,4) has no food, so no eat.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,5) - free, has no food\n\n- D: (3,3) - but (3,3) is now empty? After moving to (3,4), the previous position (3,3) is empty, so (3,3) is free, but moving D to (3,3) is down, which is opposite to current U? Current direction after move is U, so moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- L: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\n- R: (4,4) - (4,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible move is U to (3,5), because D not allowed, L and R are walls.\n\nIs that right? (3,4): up to (3,5), down to (3,3), left to (2,4) which is wall, right to (4,4) which is wall. And down is reverse, not allowed. So indeed, only U to (3,5) is possible.\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (3,5)\n\nSnake at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 2, from (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, no reverse to D.\n\n(3,5) is free, no food.\n\n- U: (3,6) - which has food! But we need to see if we can eat it.\n\n(3,6) has food, so if we move to (3,6), we eat it.\n\nBut let's see if we can move there.\n\nFrom (3,5), move U to (3,6): since (3,6) is free? y=6, (3,6) has food, but it's not obstacle, so can move there.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), we eat the food, since head moves onto it. Snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)? When you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; the head moves to food, and since it eats, a new segment is added, so positions become [(3,6), (3,5)] or something.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after move, head is at new position, and tail stays, so for length 1, after eating, length 2, head at food, tail at previous position.\n\nSo after eating at (3,6), snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nDirection is U.\n\nNow, life span of that food was 10, but we ate it at turn 2? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: at (3,4), move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: at (3,5), move U to (3,6), eat food, snake now [(3,6), (3,5)], direction U.\n\nFood at (3,6) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, other food: (4,5) and (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), (4,5) at (4,5)\n\nNow turn 3, from (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but cannot reverse to D.\n\nNow (3,6) is at y=6, so U would be (3,7), but y=7 is border wall, cannot move there.\n\nD: (3,5) - but (3,5) is the tail, so moving to (3,5) might be possible? But (3,5) is occupied by tail.\n\nIn snake, moving to the tail cell is usually allowed because when head moves, tail moves away, so no collision if it's the tail.\n\nBut here, there's a special rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail is safe, as long as after move, head and tail don't collide, but since tail moves, it should be ok.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to the current tail position, and since tail moves, the new head is there, and tail moves to previous body, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, from (3,6), moving D to (3,5) which is tail.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) - y=7 wall, cannot\n\n- D: (3,5) - occupied by tail, but can move there? Since tail will move.\n\n- L: (2,6) - (2,6) has food, and is free? (2,6) not obstacle, so yes.\n\n- R: (4,6) - (4,6) is free? y=6, x=4, not obstacle, yes.\n\nNow, if we move D to (3,5), since tail is there, after move: head moves to (3,5), but (3,5) was tail, so when head moves to (3,5), the tail moves away to where? The snake was [(3,6), (3,5)], head at (3,6), tail at (3,5).\n\nAfter moving down to (3,5): head moves to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by tail, so we need to see the sequence.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, if it's food, eat and grow, tail doesn't move. If not food, move head to new cell, and tail moves to next, so the last tail cell is vacated.\n\nHere, moving to (3,5) from (3,6): (3,5) is currently occupied by tail.\n\nSince we are not eating (no food at (3,5)), so head moves to (3,5), but since (3,5) was tail, and tail moves away? The movement: head moves to new position, if new position is not food, then the tail segment is removed from the tail end.\n\nSo positions: before move: head (3,6), body/tail (3,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (3,5): new head position is (3,5), but (3,5) is already occupied, so collision? But the rule says we can move to tail cell because tail moves.\n\nI think it's safe: when head moves to the cell that is the current tail, since the tail will move away, it doesn't cause collision. The new head is at that cell, and the tail is removed, so effectively, the snake moves forward, and if head goes to tail, it's like the tail is extended or something.\n\nStandard behavior: if head moves to the current tail position, and no food, then head moves to that cell, and since tail was there, but tail moves to the previous position? Let's think.\n\nThe snake segments: index 0: head, index 1: tail for length 2.\n\nBefore move: positions: [ (3,6), (3,5) ]  (0:head, 1:tail)\n\nMove head to (3,5) - which is the position of tail.\n\nAfter move: the head is now at (3,5), and since we didn't eat, the tail is removed, so the new positions are [ (3,5) ]? But that would be length 1, but we had length 2.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nIn snake, when you move without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail is popped, so the new snake is [new_head, ..., previous_head minus tail if no growth].\n\nFor length 2: positions [head, tail]\n\nMove to new cell: if not food, new positions: [new_head, head] and tail is removed, so it becomes [new_head, previous_head] which is the same as moving the whole snake.\n\nIf new_head is the same as previous tail, then new positions: [previous_tail, previous_head] so the snake is now from (3,5) to (3,6), but since head moved to (3,5), which was tail, and previous head (3,6) is now the body.\n\nBut in terms of cells, (3,5) is now head, (3,6) is tail, so no problem, no collision.\n\nAnd the cell (3,5) is occupied by head now, tail at (3,6).\n\nIn this case, from (3,6) moving to (3,5), which was tail, after move, head at (3,5), tail at (3,6), so it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food, it would be different.\n\nBut here no food at (3,5), so moving D to (3,5) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nBut at (3,6), U is wall, so cannot.\n\nSo possible from (3,6): D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,5), L to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) has food, (4,6) free, (3,5) free.\n\nIf we go back to the path: if at turn 0 I moved U, then turn 1 U to (3,5), turn 2 U to (3,6) eat, then turn 3 at (3,6).\n\nBut I have to choose moves step by step.\n\nIn this case, if I moved U at turn 0, I can reach (3,6) by turn 2 and eat the food.\n\nBut let's see the other option at turn 0.\n\nIf at turn 0, I move L to (2,3).\n\nThen snake at (2,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 1, from (2,3), direction L, possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot reverse to R.\n\n(2,3) no food.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U: (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, wall, cannot\n\n- D: (2,2) - (2,2) is free? y=2, x=2, not obstacle, yes.\n\n- L: (1,3) - (1,3) free? x=1,y=3, not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (1,4),(1,5), so (1,3) free)\n\n- R: (3,3) but reverse not allowed, and also (3,3) empty now.\n\nBut cannot move R because opposite to L.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,2) or L to (1,3)\n\nSay, if move L to (1,3), then at (1,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 2, from (1,3), direction L, possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, cannot\n\n- D: (1,2) - (1,2) free? not obstacle, yes\n\n- L: (0,3) - x=0 wall, cannot\n\n- R: (2,3) but reverse not allowed\n\nSo only D to (1,2) possible? U and L cannot, R reverse not allowed, so only D.\n\nMove to (1,2)\n\nThen at (1,2), and so on. But food is at (2,6), (3,6), (4,5), all far from here, so it might take more turns to reach food.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,3) I move D to (2,2), then from (2,2) I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, or (1,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,6) is at top, so from south, it might be hard to reach quickly.\n\nWhereas if I go up to (3,6), I can eat soon.\n\nBut after eating at (3,6), I am at top row, and I need to move down or sideways.\n\nNow back to turn 0 decision.\n\nIf I move U at turn 0, I can be at (3,6) by turn 2 with food eaten.\n\nIf I move L, I might not reach food soon.\n\nBut there is also food at (2,6) and (4,5).\n\n(2,6) is close to (3,6), so after eating (3,6), I can go to (2,6).\n\nBut let's simulate the U path first.\n\nAt turn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), only possible U to (3,5) as we saw earlier, because other moves blocked or not allowed.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5), move U to (3,6), eat food. Snake now length 2, positions [(3,6), (3,5)], direction U.\n\nTurn 3: at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) wall, cannot\n\n- D: (3,5) - free, but occupied by tail? Can move, as discussed.\n\n- L: (2,6) - has food\n\n- R: (4,6) - free\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), I can eat the food at (2,6) immediately.\n\n(2,6) has food, so move to (2,6), eat, grow to length 3.\n\nPositions: head at (2,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, and tail (3,5) stays? When eat, head moves to new cell, and since food, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBefore move: snake [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nMove head to (2,6): (2,6) has food, so eat, grow: new head at (2,6), and add a segment, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nDirection now L (since moved left).\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut life span: food at (2,6) and (3,6) both have life 10, we ate them early, but (4,5) still there.\n\nNow, if at turn 3 I don't move to (2,6), I could move down or right, but (2,6) is food, so probably eat it.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger: not applicable here since tail is at (3,5), not adjacent to head directly, and no food on tail.\n\nNow, another option: at turn 0, move L to (2,3)\n\nThen at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 1, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3), as before.\n\nIf move L to (1,3), then only D to (1,2), then from (1,2) I can move to (1,1) or (2,2), etc, but food is far.\n\nIf from (2,3) move D to (2,2), then at (2,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 2, from (2,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot reverse to U.\n\n- U: (2,3) - free, but reverse? Current direction D, moving U is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- D: (2,1) - (2,1) free? y=1, x=2, not obstacle, yes. (5,1) obstacle, but (2,1) ok.\n\n- L: (1,2) - free\n\n- R: (3,2) - but (3,2) obstacle, cannot\n\nSo possible D to (2,1) or L to (1,2)\n\nSay move to (2,1), then at (2,1), and so on. Still far from food.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go up, but from (2,2), I can move to (2,3) but not allowed reverse, or from (2,1) to (2,2) but direction.\n\nIt would take many turns to reach food, and I might miss the life span or get stuck.\n\nSince life span is 10, but I need to eat to grow and survive longer.\n\nMoreover, with obstacles, it might be risky to go down.\n\nSo better to go up to (3,6) quickly.\n\nBut at (3,6), after eating, I have to move.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is below and right of (3,6).\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (4,4), which is below (4,5).\n\nNow, from the U path, at turn 3, after eating (3,6), I am at [(3,6), (3,5)], head at (3,6)\n\nI can move to (2,6) to eat food, or to (4,6), or down to (3,5).\n\nIf I move to (2,6), eat, then snake longer.\n\nThen I need to go down to (4,5) or other areas.\n\nBut there is also the food at (4,5) with life 10.\n\nNow, if I don't go to (3,6) first, but go towards (4,5).\n\nAt turn 0, from (3,3), I can only move U or L, not directly to (4,5).\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then from there, I could go right, but at (3,4), I could only go up, not right or left, because L and R are walls, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt (3,4), only U possible to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) or to (4,5)? (4,5) is at (4,5), which is right and down? (3,5) to (4,5) is right, but from (3,5), direction U (since came from below?).\n\nAt turn 1, after moving to (3,5), direction is U.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6)\n\n- D: (3,4) but reverse not allowed\n\n- L: (2,5) - (2,5) free? y=5, x=2, not obstacle, yes\n\n- R: (4,5) - (4,5) has food, free\n\nSo from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), R to (4,5), or U to (3,6).\n\nI forgot that at (3,5), I have choices.\n\nIn the initial U move, at turn 2, from (3,5), I can choose to go to (4,5) instead of (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (2,5).\n\nSo let's revise.\n\nOption: at turn 0, move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)  (only choice, as before)\n\nNow at turn 2, at (3,5), direction U, possible moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nAll are possible.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), then eat the food at (4,5), since head moves to it.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2, positions [(4,5), (3,5)], direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,6), eat, as before.\n\nOr to (2,5), no food, then to (2,6) or etc.\n\nBut (2,6) has food, so from (2,5) I can go to (2,6).\n\nBut let's compare the food values; all same, +1.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the top row y=6 has obstacles: (5,6) obstacle, (1,6) free, (2,6) food, (3,6) food, (4,6) free, (6,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, bottom.\n\nNow, after eating one food, I have a body, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor instance, if I go to (3,6) and eat, then I am at corner, and with body, moving might be limited.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is not corner.\n\n(4,5) is at row 5, which has more space.\n\ny=5: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) all free except (1,5) obstacle but x=1, so (2,5) to (6,5) free.\n\nAlso, (4,5) has food.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead from turn 0.\n\nFirst, at turn 0, I must choose U or L.\n\nIf I choose L to (2,3), it might take longer to reach food, so U is better to get food quickly.\n\nSo I'll go with U.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), only U to (3,5) possible, as established.\n\nNow at turn 2, at (3,5), I have three choices: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nNow, (3,6) has food, (4,5) has food, (2,5) has no food.\n\nSo better to eat food now.\n\n(2,5) no food, so not good to go there yet.\n\nBetween (3,6) and (4,5), both have food.\n\n(4,5) might be better because it's not on the edge.\n\n(3,6) is on top row, which might be risky.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nIf I go to (3,6), eat, then at turn 3, I can move to (2,6) to eat another food, or to (4,6), or down.\n\nIf I go to (4,5), eat, then from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (5,5) or (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, etc.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,6), which might expire if not eaten soon, but life 10, and turn 2, so plenty of time.\n\nBut to maximize, eating both is good.\n\nNow, let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, suppose at turn 2, I move U to (3,6), eat food. Snake: [(3,6), (3,5)], direction U.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) to eat food there immediately.\n\nMove L to (2,6), eat, grow to length 3: positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (2,6), at turn 4, direction L, possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,7) wall, cannot\n\n- D: (2,5) - free\n\n- L: (1,6) - free\n\n- R: (3,6) - but (3,6) is body, occupied, cannot move there, collision.\n\n(3,6) is the second segment, so if I move R, to (3,6), which is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to body is deadly.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6)\n\n(1,6) is free, as we said.\n\nIf move D to (2,5), no food, then positions: head to (2,5), tail moves, so new positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]? Let's see: before move: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nMove head to (2,5): not food, so head to (2,5), then the tail (3,5) is removed, so new positions: [(2,5), (2,6)]? The segments: head moves to (2,5), then the body: (2,6) becomes first body, (3,6) becomes tail? Positions: after move, new head at (2,5), and the previous head (2,6) is now body, and (3,6) is still body, but since tail is removed, it should be [ (2,5), (2,6) ], and (3,6) is vacated, (3,5) also vacated but tail removed.\n\nSnake segments: before move: index 0: (2,6), index 1: (3,6), index 2: (3,5)\n\nAfter moving to (2,5): not food, so new head at (2,5), and the tail segment (3,5) is removed, so the new snake is [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]? No: the segments are updated: the head is now at (2,5), and the previous segments except tail are kept, but shifted.\n\nStandard: the body segments follow the head.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position, if not food, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo positions: new head at (2,5), then the previous head (2,6) becomes body, and the previous body (3,6) becomes tail, and (3,5) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] but (3,6) is the tail now.\n\nLength 3, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\n(3,5) is empty.\n\nThen direction is D, since moved down.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to other places.\n\nIf at turn 4 I move L to (1,6), then eat if food, but (1,6) no food, so move to (1,6), not food, then positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can move D to (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle, or L to (0,6) wall, or R to (2,6) body, collision, or U wall, so only possible D to (1,5) but wall, cannot, or other, all blocked? U: (1,7) wall, D: (1,5) obstacle, L: (0,6) wall, R: (2,6) occupied by body, so no move possible, dead! Snake dies.\n\nOh, so if at turn 4 I move to (1,6), I get stuck and die on next turn.\n\nTherefore, from (2,6), I must not move to (1,6), only move D to (2,5).\n\nSo in that case, at turn 3, after eating (2,6), I should move D to (2,5).\n\nThen at (2,5), no food, direction D.\n\nThen I can go to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or (3,5) or (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle, etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot reverse to U since direction D.\n\n- U: (2,6) - but (2,6) is body, occupied, collision\n\n- D: (2,4) - obstacle, wall\n\n- L: (1,5) - obstacle\n\n- R: (3,5) - (3,5) is free? But after previous, (3,5) is empty, but at this point, from (2,5), move R to (3,5), which is free.\n\nSo only possible R to (3,5)\n\nMove to (3,5), not food, then positions: head to (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,6), direction R.\n\nThen from (3,5), and so on.\n\nBut this is messy.\n\nTo avoid that, at turn 3, from (3,6), instead of moving to (2,6), I could move to (4,6) or down.\n\nBut (2,6) has food, so I should eat it if possible, but after eating, I need to move down carefully.\n\nBack to turn 2 choice.\n\nAt turn 2, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) to eat that food.\n\nThen at turn 2: move R to (4,5), eat food. Snake: [(4,5), (3,5)], direction R.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5), direction R, possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) - free\n\n- D: (4,4) - but (4,4) obstacle, cannot\n\n- L: (3,5) - but (3,5) is tail, can move? But moving left, opposite to current R? Current direction R, moving L is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- R: (5,5) - (5,5) free? y=5, x=5, not obstacle, yes.\n\nSo possible U to (4,6) or R to (5,5)\n\n(4,6) no food, (5,5) no food.\n\nSay move U to (4,6), not food, positions: head to (4,6), tail moves, so new [(4,6), (4,5)] since (3,5) removed? Before: [(4,5), (3,5)], move to (4,6) not food, so head (4,6), body (4,5), tail removed, so [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move to (3,6) or (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or down to (4,5) but occupied or reverse.\n\nAt turn 4, from (4,6), direction U, possible:\n\n- U: (4,7) wall\n\n- D: (4,5) - but (4,5) is body, occupied, collision\n\n- L: (3,6) - (3,6) has food? But we ate (3,6) already? No, in this path, we ate (4,5), not (3,6).\n\nFood at (3,6) is still there, life span 10.\n\n(3,6) has food, and it's free.\n\n- R: (5,6) - obstacle, cannot\n\nSo only possible L to (3,6)\n\nMove to (3,6), eat food, grow: positions new head (3,6), add segment, so [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (3,6), similar to before.\n\nI can move to (2,6) to eat or down.\n\n(2,6) has food.\n\nMove L to (2,6), eat, etc.\n\nBut again, similar issue.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the foods in a way that I don't get stuck.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 2, from (3,5), I can move to (2,5) first, no food, then to (2,6) to eat.\n\nBut that delays eating.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSince all food has same value, I can go for the one that allows more mobility.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is near the center, so after eating, I can go to (3,6) or to other areas.\n\n(3,6) is on edge.\n\nSo perhaps at turn 2, move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nThen to (3,6) later.\n\nBut (3,6) is close.\n\nLet's think about the internal obstacles.\n\nFor example, there is an obstacle at (4,4), below (4,5), so from (4,5), I cannot go down.\n\nAlso at (3,2), (6,3), etc.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a route to eat all three foods.\n\nFood at (4,5), (3,6), (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (4,5) first, eat, then to (4,6), then to (3,6) eat, then to (2,6) eat.\n\nBut after eating (4,5), at turn 2, snake at [(4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 3: from (4,5), move U to (4,6)  (since D and L not possible or not allowed)\n\nAs above, move U to (4,6), not food, positions [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 4: from (4,6), move L to (3,6), eat food, positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] after growth.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), move L to (2,6), eat food, positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nThen from (2,6), as before, I can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6), but moving to (1,6) might cause death later, so move D to (2,5).\n\nThen at (2,5), move R to (3,5) or other.\n\nBut (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 5, after eating (2,6), positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] head at (2,6)\n\nMove D to (2,5): not food, so head to (2,5), tail (4,5) removed, so new positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]? Head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (2,5), as before, only move R to (3,5) possible, since U to (2,6) body, D to (2,4) wall, L to (1,5) wall.\n\nMove R to (3,5), not food, positions head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) or something.\n\nBefore move: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] head (2,5)\n\nMove to (3,5): not food, so head to (3,5), tail (4,6) removed, so new: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]? Segments: head (3,5), then previous head (2,5) body, then (2,6) body, then (3,6) tail.\n\n(3,6) is tail.\n\nThen direction R.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,4) but (3,4) is free, or (4,5) but (4,5) empty, etc.\n\nBut I have eaten all three foods by turn 5.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,6) not eat\n\nTurn 4: move L to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,6) eat\n\nSo by turn 5, eaten all three foods, score 3, length 4.\n\nThen from there, I need to find more food, but no more food now, so I have to survive, but food might spawn later, but in this state, only these foods.\n\nThe state has only these three foods, so after eating them, no food, so I just need to move without dying.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 5, I am at (2,6) with body, and I moved to (2,5), then to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut at (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) or other.\n\nBut (3,4) is free, etc.\n\nNow, what about the L option at turn 0?\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nThen at (2,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 1, I can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3)\n\nSuppose move D to (2,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 2, from (2,2), move D to (2,1) or L to (1,2)\n\nSay move D to (2,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 3, from (2,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot reverse to U.\n\n- U: (2,2) - free, but reverse not allowed\n\n- D: (2,0) wall\n\n- L: (1,1) - free\n\n- R: (3,1) - (3,1) free? y=1, x=3, not obstacle, yes\n\nSo move to (1,1) or (3,1)\n\nBut food is at (4,5), etc, far away.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go up, but from (2,1), I can go to (2,2) but not allowed immediately, etc.\n\nIt would take at least 4 moves to reach y=6, and food might expire if not eaten, but life 10, turn 3, still time, but inefficient.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move to (3,1), then to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, cannot, so to (4,1) or (3,1) to (4,1), etc, complicated.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo moving U at turn 0 is better.\n\nTherefore, I think for turn 0, move U.\n\nThen for the sequence, to eat all food safely.\n\nAt turn 2, from (3,5), if I move to (4,5), then to (4,6), then to (3,6), then to (2,6), as above.\n\nIn that sequence, I ate (4,5) at turn 2, (3,6) at turn 4, (2,6) at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 2 I ate (4,5), turn 4 ate (3,6), turn 5 ate (2,6).\n\nAll within life span 10.\n\nAnd I have a path.\n\nAfter that, I can move around the grid.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions for some turns, but it doesn't specify how many to output.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence of actions, but for how many turns?\n\nProbably for a few turns, or until a decision point.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent t1=0.\n\nSo let's provide actions for turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 0: move U\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), only U possible, so move U\n\nTurn 2: at (3,5), I can choose to move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) (only choice besides R to (5,5), but U to (4,6) is fine)\n\nIn turn 3, from (4,5), I can move U or R, as above.\n\nI chose U to (4,6) to go towards (3,6).\n\nI could move R to (5,5), but then (3,6) is left, and I need to go back.\n\nBut to eat (3,6) soon, better U.\n\nTurn 4: from (4,6), move L to (3,6) eat.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), move L to (2,6) eat.\n\nNow, for turn 6, I don't need to output, but since I output up to turn 5.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 3, when I move U to (4,6), I don't eat, but at turn 4 I eat (3,6).\n\nAt turn 2, if I move to (3,6) first, then turn 3 to (2,6), but after that I need to go to (4,5), which is farther.\n\nFor example, if turn 2 move U to (3,6) eat, turn 3 move L to (2,6) eat, then at (2,6), move D to (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (4,5) to eat, but from (3,5) to (4,5) is right, but direction might not allow.\n\nAfter turn 3: at (2,6), after eating (2,6), positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] head (2,6)\n\nThen move D to (2,5), not food, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), tail (3,6)  (since (3,5) removed? Before: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)], move to (2,5) not food, head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6), tail removed so [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (2,5), move R to (3,5), not food, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (4,5) to eat, since (4,5) has food, and move R to (4,5), direction R, allowed.\n\nEat, grow.\n\nBut in this case, I eat (4,5) at turn 5 or later.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: U to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 3: L to (2,6) eat\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,5) not eat\n\nTurn 5: R to (3,5) not eat? Then at turn 6 move to (4,5) eat.\n\nBut at turn 2 I ate (3,6), turn 3 ate (2,6), turn 6 ate (4,5), so (4,5) eaten later, but life span 10, turn 6, should be fine.\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate (4,5) at turn 2, (3,6) at turn 4, (2,6) at turn 5.\n\nBoth ok.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I go to (4,5) first, then to (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), I have a longer path with an extra move to (4,6) not eating.\n\nWhereas if I go to (3,6) then (2,6), then down to (4,5), I might have fewer non-eating moves.\n\nBut in terms of score, I eat all three in both cases.\n\nBut for survival, after eating, I need to have space.\n\nPerhaps similar.\n\nBut in the sequence where I go to (3,6) first, after eating (2,6), I am at (2,5) or (3,5), which is lower, so more space to move.\n\nWhereas if I end at (2,6) after eating all, I am at top, need to go down.\n\nBut not a big deal.\n\nSince the problem says to output actions, I can choose one.\n\nAlso, at turn 2, moving to (4,5) might be better because (4,5) is not on border.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I'll go with moving to (4,5) at turn 2.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 2: R (to (4,5) eat)\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5), I need to choose move.\n\nAs above, I can move U to (4,6) or R to (5,5)\n\nIf I move U to (4,6), then turn 4 move L to (3,6) eat, turn 5 move L to (2,6) eat.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or to (6,5), etc, but (3,6) might be left, so better to go towards (3,6).\n\nSo move U to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 4: move L to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,6) eat\n\nNow, for output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction after each move.\n\nBut for the answer, just the actions.\n\nSo for turns 0 to 5:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nIn turn 3, I moved U to (4,6), not eating.\n\nIn turn 4, move L to (3,6) eat.\n\nTurn 5 move L to (2,6) eat.\n\nAfter turn 5, I have eaten all food.\n\nNow, to write in boxed.\n\nBut the snake head direction: at start, direction L, after move U, direction U, then U again, then R, then U, then L, then L.\n\nAll fine.\n\nIf at turn 2 I move U to (3,6), then turn 3 move L to (2,6), then turn 4 move D to (2,5), turn 5 move R to (3,5), then turn 6 move R to (4,5) eat, but I only output to turn 5, so turn 5 not eating.\n\nIn that case, at turn 5, I move to (3,5), not eating, while in the other sequence, at turn 5 I eat (2,6).\n\nSo better to have the eating in the first 5 turns.\n\nIn the sequence with R at turn 2, by turn 5 I have eaten three foods.\n\nIn the U at turn 2, by turn 3 I ate two, turn 5 not eating.\n\nBut output to turn 5, so both ok, but eating at turn 5 is better.\n\nIn U at turn 2: turn 2 eat (3,6), turn 3 eat (2,6), turn 4 move D, turn 5 move R, no eat at turn 5.\n\nIn R at turn 2: turn 2 eat (4,5), turn 4 eat (3,6), turn 5 eat (2,6), so at turn 5 I eat.\n\nSo in the R path, at turn 5 I eat the last food, which is good for the output.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nNow, to confirm the coordinates.\n\nAt turn 0: start (3,3) dir L, move U to (3,4), new dir U\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4) move U to (3,5), dir U\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5) move R to (4,5), eat, snake [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 3: from (4,5) move U to (4,6), not eat, snake [(4,6), (4,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 4: from (4,6) move L to (3,6), eat, snake [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] dir L\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6) move L to (2,6), eat, snake [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] dir L\n\nAll good.\n\nFor the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating all available positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's own body. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 0\\)) has the snake at position [(3,3)] with direction L (left), and food at (4,5), (3,6), and (2,6), all with value +1 and life span 10. The grid is 8x8 with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), and (3,2).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 0)**: From (3,3), moving down (D) is blocked by the obstacle at (3,2), and moving right (R) is not allowed due to the no-instant-reverse rule (current direction is L). Thus, only up (U) or left (L) are possible. Moving U to (3,4) is preferred to reach the food-rich top row quickly, whereas moving L to (2,3) leads to dead ends or delays in eating food.\n- **Food Prioritization**: All food has a life span of 10, so there is time, but eating efficiently is key. The sequence should aim to eat (4,5) first (as it is central and allows mobility), then (3,6), and finally (2,6) to avoid getting trapped on edges.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: After growing, the snake must avoid moving into walls, obstacles, or body segments (except the tail, which is safe if the tail moves away). Specifically:\n  - After eating (2,6) at (2,6), moving left to (1,6) risks a dead end, so down to (2,5) is safer.\n  - Obstacles like (4,4) block downward moves from (4,5), so upward movement is necessary.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: I will plan 5 turns ahead (turns 0 to 5) to eat all three foods and position the snake for survival. By turn 5, all food will be eaten, increasing the score by 3 and the snake length to 4.\n\n### Planned Moves:\n- **Turn 0 (from (3,3), direction L)**: Move U (up) to (3,4). This avoids the obstacle at (3,2) and positions the snake to reach food faster. New direction: U.\n- **Turn 1 (from (3,4), direction U)**: Move U (up) to (3,5). This is the only safe move (left and right are blocked by obstacles at (2,4) and (4,4); down is reverse and not allowed). New direction: U.\n- **Turn 2 (from (3,5), direction U)**: Move R (right) to (4,5) to eat the food. Eating here is efficient as (4,5) is central, avoiding edge risks. New direction: R.\n- **Turn 3 (from (4,5), direction R)**: Move U (up) to (4,6). Down is blocked by obstacle (4,4); left is reverse and not allowed; right to (5,5) is possible but detours from the remaining food. Moving up aligns with eating (3,6) next. New direction: U.\n- **Turn 4 (from (4,6), direction U)**: Move L (left) to (3,6) to eat the food. Up and right are blocked or risky (up to (4,7) is a wall; right to (5,6) is an obstacle). Moving left eats (3,6) and sets up for (2,6). New direction: L.\n- **Turn 5 (from (3,6), direction L)**: Move L (left) to (2,6) to eat the food. Down to (3,5) is safe but misses immediate food; up to (3,7) is a wall. Moving left eats (2,6) and completes all food consumption by turn 5. New direction: L.\n\n### Outcome by Turn 5:\n- **Score**: +3 (all food eaten).\n- **Snake Positions**: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] (length 4).\n- **Next Moves**: From (2,6), move down to (2,5) (safe and avoids dead ends) for long-term survival, as no food remains.\n\nThis sequence ensures all food is eaten within the life span, maximizes the score early, and positions the snake in a less constrained area for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: R \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: L \\\\\nTurn 5: L\n}",
