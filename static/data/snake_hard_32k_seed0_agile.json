This cell has positive food (value 1, life span 1). Eating it would grow the snake by 1 segment.\n   - **Right (R)**: Move to (2, 2). This cell is empty.\n   - **Left (L)**: Move to (0, 2). This is a wall (x=0), so invalid.\n   - **Up (U)**: Move to (1, 3). This is a body segment, so invalid (collision).\n\n3. **Food Considerations**:\n   - (1, 1): Positive food, life span 1. If not eaten now, it disappears after this turn.\n   - (3, 5): Positive food, life span 7. Currently under the tail, so not immediately accessible.\n   - (2, 5): Positive food, life span 10. Not urgent.\n\n4. **Immediate Risks**:\n   - Moving D to (1, 1) is safe as the head is not adjacent to the tail, so no tail reward danger.\n   - Moving R to (2, 2) is also safe but misses the food at (1, 1).\n\n### Decision\n\n- **Option 1: Move D to (1, 1)**:\n  - Pros: Eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). The food disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n  - Cons: Snake becomes longer, which might complicate future movements.\n  - After eating, the snake's new positions: head at (1, 1), body at (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5).\n  - Next move from (1, 1) would be forced to R to (2, 1) (other directions are blocked or walls).\n\n- **Option 2: Move R to (2, 2)**:\n  - Pros: Snake does not grow, keeping it more maneuverable.\n  - Cons: Miss the food at (1, 1), which disappears.\n  - Next move from (2, 2) would be forced to D to (2, 1) (other directions are blocked or walls).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations\n\n- The food at (1, 1) is only available now. Missing it means losing a point, but the snake remains shorter, which might help in tight spaces later.\n- The other foods (3, 5) and (2, 5) have longer life spans, so there's time to reach them later.\n- Moving D leads to a longer snake, which might make navigating around obstacles harder, but the immediate gain is a point.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the immediate availability of the food at (1, 1) and the lack of immediate danger, the best action is to eat it. The snake can then navigate to safer areas in subsequent turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",
