No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly for y. But internal cells are fine. The border cells are walls, so for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

I should map these out to visualize.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body at (4,5), and tail at (3,5). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to reach (4,6) from (4,5) since positions are head first.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. But I need to check if any food is under the snake body.\n> \n> Snake is at (4,6), (4,5), (3,5). Food is at (3,6), (2,6), (1,1). (3,6) is adjacent to the head? Head is at (4,6), so (3,6) is to the left, same y, x-1.\n> \n> (3,6) is not under the snake; snake has (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), so (3,6) is empty. Similarly, (2,6) is empty, and (1,1) is far away.\n> \n> Now, movement: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but no instant reverse.

But if it touches the tail, and the tail moves, it might be ok.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,6), moving Down to (4,5): (4,5) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,5). So (4,5) is a body segment that will not move away immediately; when the head moves, the body follows, so if head goes to (4,5), which is currently occupied by the body, it would collide.\n> \n> Let's think carefully about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - The head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment is left, so that cell becomes empty.\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is not occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, it's safe. But if it moves to a cell that has a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell occupied by the tail, and the tail will move away (since it follows the body), then it's safe; the head takes that position, and the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment, that segment is still there and will only move after, so collision occurs.\n> \n> In this case, positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (3,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - Up: (4,7) - is this within bounds? y=7 is border, so wall? Border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (4,7) has y=7, which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (4,5) - this is currently occupied by the body segment at index 1, (4,5). Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because that body segment is still there.\n> \n> - Left: (3,6) - x-1, y same. (3,6) is not occupied by snake; snake has (3,5), but (3,6) is different. Also, is it a wall? Internal obstacles: (3,2) is an obstacle, but (3,6) is not listed, so should be free. Food at (3,6) is there.\n> \n> - Right: (5,6) - x+1, y same. (5,6) is not in snake positions. But is it a wall? Internal obstacles include (5,6), yes, (5,6) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6) is listed, so (5,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Also, border walls: y=0, y=7, x=0, x=7.\n> \n> So from (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (4,7) - y=7, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (4,5) - occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> - Left: (3,6) - free, and has food.\n> \n> - Right: (5,6) - obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (3,6).\n> \n> Is that right? Down to (4,5) is occupied and not tail, so collision. Yes.\n> \n> But let's confirm the tail: tail is at (3,5), not (4,5). (4,5) is the middle segment.\n> \n> So only Left to (3,6) is possible.\n> \n> Now, (3,6) has food with value +1 and life span 6. Since it's turn 4, and life span decreases every turn including current, so if I move to (3,6) on this turn, I eat the food, life span was 6, so it would disappear after 6 turns from when it spawned, but since I eat it, it's consumed.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn. So at turn 4, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, including turn 4? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life_span 6 at turn 4, it means it will disappear after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, if it spawns at turn S, it disappears after S + N - 1 or something. But here, it's given at turn t1=4 with life_span 6, so it has 6 turns left including turn 4. So it will be there until turn 4 + 5 = 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 4, life_span=6, after turn 4, countdown becomes 5, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears after that turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: at the start of turn t, if life_span remaining is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and when L-1=0 after the turn, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for simplicity, since we're moving on turn, I think when the snake moves to a cell, if food is there, it eats it, as long as it's present.\n> \n> But in this case, for (3,6), life_span 6 at turn 4, so it will be available for 6 more turns, meaning from turn 4 to turn 9? Turn 4: countdown=6, after turn 4 it becomes 5, after turn 5 it becomes 4, ..., after turn 9 it becomes 0, so it disappears after turn 9, so available on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But I need to move now. So on turn 4, I must move Left to (3,6), as it's the only possible move.\n> \n> Is that correct? Let's list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (4,7) - y=7, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - South: (4,5) - occupied by snake body (not tail), collision if moved there.\n> \n> - West: (3,6) - free, no obstacle, not snake, has food.\n> \n> - East: (5,6) - internal obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> Yes, only West (Left) is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 4, action must be L.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6), I eat the food, so score +1, and snake length increases by 1. New positions: head at (3,6), then the previous head (4,6) becomes body, and (4,5) is still body, and tail (3,5) remains?

But let's confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but playable cells are (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 5. Since current turn is 5, it will disappear after 5 turns, so on turn 10 it will be gone. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so on turn 5, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one, so it disappears after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? For example, if N=5 at turn 5, after turn 5, countdown to 4, then 3,2,1,0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn 5, life span 5, it will be there for turns 5,6,7,8,9, and disappear at the start of turn 10 or after turn 9? I think it's common to say it disappears after N turns, meaning after N steps.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it's gone. For (2,6), L=5 at turn 5, so it will be there until turn 9 inclusive, and disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) with value 1 and life span 9, so it lasts until turn 13 or something, but we might not care that far.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)]\n> \n> So let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for y=0 to 7; all y=0, y=7 for x=0 to 7.

Usually in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But here, walls at y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, or vice versa?

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7.

So the snake is 5 segments long. The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,6) from (3,6).\n> \n> Food: There's one food item at (1,1) with a life span of 8 and value +1. Since the value is +1, it's positive food. Life span 8 means it will disappear after 8 turns, including the current turn, so it has 8 turns left starting from turn 6.\n> \n> I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. Since there's only one food on the board, I should consider going for it, but I need to avoid risks like collisions or getting trapped.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a mental grid.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,6)\n> \n> - Body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail is at (3,5)\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it came from right, moving left.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (2,6): Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No, the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right immediately because that would be into (3,6), which is the body, but let's check possible moves.\n> \n> From (2,6), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (2,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (2,5) - is this free? Let's see.\n> \n> - Left: (1,6) - what's here?\n> \n> - Right: (3,6) - but (3,6) is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Also, moving opposite to direction might be restricted, but the restriction is only for the next turn action, not for collision.\n> \n> Collision rules: moving into a body segment kills, except for the tail, because the tail moves. So from (2,6), moving:\n> \n> - U: (2,7) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (2,5) - let's see if occupied. Snake positions: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5). So (2,5) is not listed, so it might be free.\n> \n> - L: (1,6) - not listed, so might be free.\n> \n> - R: (3,6) - occupied by body segment (second segment), so moving there would collide, invalid.\n> \n> Also, walls: internal obstacles, but (1,6) and (2,5) are not in the obstacle list, and not borders except y=7.\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,5) is within bounds, x=2 between 1 and 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free except obstacles. Similarly y=1 to y=6 except obstacles.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free.\n> \n> (2,5): x=2, y=5. Is there an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (2,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): x=1, y=6. Obstacles: (1,5) is an obstacle, but (1,6) not listed, so should be free? (1,5) is obstacle, but (1,6) is different cell.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,5) is one, but (1,6) is not listed, so it should be free, unless it's border, but y=6 is not border, border is y=7.\n> \n> y=7 is border, y=6 is inside.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is body, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - U: (2,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,5) free? But let's confirm: snake positions, (2,6) head, (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5). (2,5) not occupied by snake. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so free.\n> \n> (2,4) is obstacle, yes.\n> \n> - L: (1,6) - x=1, y=6. Not snake, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles include (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6). (1,5) is obstacle, (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,6) is free? (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5), (1,5) is listed, and (1,4). But (1,6) not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> - R: (3,6) occupied, invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: D or L. Cannot go U or R.\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, so if I move L, that's same direction, fine. If I move D, that's perpendicular, also fine. Only R is opposite, which is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So I can choose to go Down to (2,5) or Left to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (1,1). It's at (1,1), which is bottom-left, but with obstacles around.\n> \n> Food life span is 8, so it will disappear after turn 13? Turn t=6, life span 8, so it appears at some turn, but life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 6, it has life span 8, meaning it will be there until turn 13? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> Here, turn t=6, life span=8, so food is present from turn 6 to turn 13 (since 6 to 13 is 8 turns: turns 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13; that's 8 turns), gone at turn 14.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns, but probably more to reach the food or something.\n> \n> First, where is the snake? Head at (2,6), food at (1,1). That's quite far, and there are obstacles.\n> \n> I should consider the path to (1,1).\n> \n> From (2,6) to (1,1): need to go left and down, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Current position (2,6). If I go left to (1,6), then from there, I can go down or left, but left to (0,6) is x=0 wall, so cannot go left from (1,6), only down or right, but right is back.\n> \n> From (1,6), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (1,5) - but (1,5) is an internal obstacle, so wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: (2,6) - but (2,6) is where the snake body is now, but after moving, the snake will have moved.\n> \n> I need to think about the snake movement.\n> \n> If I move to (1,6) on this turn, turn 6, action L.\n> \n> Then snake positions: head moves to (1,6), body follows: the segment that was at (3,6) moves to (2,6), (4,6) to (3,6), (4,5) to (4,6)?

The life_span value is the remaining life span at the current turn.\n> \n> The input says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and it specifies that life_span is given for the current turn.\n> \n> So for (1,1), life_span=7 on turn 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including this one. So after 7 more turns, it will disappear. Since countdown decreases every turn, on turn 7, life_span=7; turn 8, life_span=6; ... up to turn 13, life_span=1; on turn 14, it disappears. Life_span decreases each turn, so from turn 7 to turn 7 + 6 = turn 13, it has life_span from 7 down to 1, and on turn 14 it's gone. So it can be eaten from turn 7 to turn 13.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,3), value=1, life_span=10 on turn 7, so it has 10 turns left, disappearing after turn 16.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,5), direction down. Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So current direction is down, so I cannot move up on the next turn. But for the current action, I can choose any direction except the opposite if it were to reverse immediately, but since I'm choosing for turn t1, I can move in any direction except up if down was previous, but the head direction is given as current direction.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current position, I assume. So for the next move, I can choose to go down, left, or right, but not up because that would reverse the direction immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, in future turns, I need to avoid instant reverses.\n> \n> Now, the grid: let's sketch this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls are the borders, so I cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So let's list the cells:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body: (2,6) - since y increases up? I need to know the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards, but let's confirm.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I think. But walls include y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So snake head at (2,5): x=2, y=5.\n> \n> Body: (2,6) which is up from head? Head at (2,5), body at (2,6) which is y=6, so since y increases up, (2,6) is above (2,5), but head is moving down? Current head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n> \n> So head is (2,5), next segment is (2,6). But (2,6) has y=6, which is greater than y=5, so (2,6) is north of (2,5), meaning the snake was previously moving up to get to (2,5) from (2,6)? Positions are head first, so the head moved to (2,5) from previous position.\n> \n> The list is in order: index 0 is head, then index 1 is the first body segment, which is the position the head just left.\n> \n> So from positions: head at (2,5), then (2,6) which is directly above (since y=6 > y=5), so the head came from (2,6) to (2,5) by moving down. Then next segment (3,6), then (4,6), then (4,5).\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Current head direction is given as D, down, which matches moving from (2,6) to (2,5).\n> \n> For the next move, from (2,5), I can move:\n> \n> - Down: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Left: to (1,5)\n> \n> - Right: to (3,5)\n> \n> Cannot move up to (2,6) because that would be instant reverse to up, and current direction is down.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, check walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (2,4) is y=4, which is not border, so no wall. But (2,4) is listed as an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is an internal obstacle! So (2,4) is a wall cell, I cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) is also an obstacle? (1,5) is in the list.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (1,5), etc.\n> \n> So from (2,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down to (2,4): but (2,4) is an obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left to (1,5): (1,5) is also an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,5), so (1,5) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right to (3,5): is (3,5) a wall? Borders: x=3 is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: check list: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (3,5) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> (3,5) is not mentioned, so it should be empty.\n> \n> But snake body? Snake is at (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (3,5) is not occupied by snake, so it should be free.\n> \n> (4,5) is the tail, but when I move, the tail will move, so it's not a collision to move to where the tail is now, because the tail will advance.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So from (2,5), moving right to (3,5) should be possible, as long as no other body collision.\n> \n> Current body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (3,5) is not occupied, so no collision.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> Moving left to (1,5) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> Moving up to (2,6) is body, and also instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> (2,6) is the first body segment. If I move up to (2,6), it's a body collision because the head would touch the body segment before it moves.\n> \n> Rule: body collision happens if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for the tail, if head moves to where tail is now, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> But for other body segments, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment doesn't move immediately.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,5).\n> \n> So moving to (2,6) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Also, instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, from current position (2,5), the only possible move is right to (3,5).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Let me confirm:\n> \n> - Down: (2,4) - obstacle (internal wall)\n> \n> - Left: (1,5) - obstacle (internal wall)\n> \n> - Up: (2,6) - body segment and instant reverse, not allowed\n> \n> - Right: (3,5) - not wall, not occupied by body except tail? (3,5) is not occupied at all. Body segments: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). (3,5) is empty.\n> \n> So yes, only right to (3,5) is possible.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> The action sequence should be for turn t1=7, and then a few more turns, at least 5+ turns ahead as per instruction.\n> \n> But for turn 7, I must move right, as it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then, after that, I can plan.\n> \n> First, for turn 7: action must be R, to (3,5).\n> \n> Then, new head position: (3,5)\n> \n> Direction now is right (since I moved right).\n> \n> Snake body: after moving, the head moves to (3,5), and the tail moves from (4,5), but when head moves, the body follows, so the new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes body, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]? Let's see:\n> \n> Original positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5), the body shifts: the segment that was at (2,6) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n> \n> So: head was at index 0, moves to new cell.\n> \n> Then body segment at index 1 moves to where index 0 was.\n> \n> Index 2 moves to where index 1 was.\n> \n> Index 3 moves to where index 2 was.\n> \n> Tail (index 4) moves to where index 3 was.\n> \n> In this case: head moves to (3,5).\n> \n> Then, the first body segment was at (2,6), which moves to (2,5) (previous head position).\n> \n> Then, second body segment was at (3,6), moves to (2,6) (previous position of first body).\n> \n> Then, third body segment was at (4,6), moves to (3,6) (previous position of second body).\n> \n> Then, tail was at (4,5), moves to (4,6) (previous position of third body).\n> \n> The positions: indices: 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: tail (4,5)\n> \n> After move to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - New body: segment 1: position that was head, (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: position that was segment 1, (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: position that was segment 2, (3,6)\n> \n> - New tail: position that was segment 3, (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 3 was (4,6), which becomes the new tail? Tail was index 4 at (4,5), but when head moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment it was following.\n> \n> Standard: the tail leaves its position, and the new tail is the segment that was second last.\n> \n> After move: the snake occupies: new head at (3,5), then the segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and the tail was at (4,5), but (4,5) is now empty, and the segment that was at (4,6) is still there? I think I confused.\n> \n> Better to think: the body segments shift forward.\n> \n> The cell that was head is now occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> The cell that was first body is now occupied by the second body, and so on.\n> \n> The tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So positions before move:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body1: (2,6)\n> \n> - Body2: (3,6)\n> \n> - Body3: (4,6)\n> \n> - Tail: (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - New body1: old head position (2,5)\n> \n> - New body2: old body1 position (2,6)\n> \n> - New body3: old body2 position (3,6)\n> \n> - New tail: old body3 position (4,6)\n> \n> The old tail position (4,5) is now empty.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,6) - but (3,6) is now a body segment (new body3), so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,4) - is this free?

Or at the end of turn when countdown reaches 0?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the turn it's spawned, countdown is N. Each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn.\n> \n> For example, if a food has life span 6 at turn 8, countdown starts at 6. After turn 8, countdown is 5, and so on. After 5 more decreases, at turn 13, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 8: countdown 6\n> \n> Turn 9: countdown 5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 13: countdown 0, disappears after turn 13.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) with life span 9 at turn 8: countdown 9, disappears after turn 16? Turn 8:9, 9:8, ..., turn 16:1, turn 17:0, disappears after turn 17? Let's calculate:\n> \n> Start turn T, countdown C.\n> \n> After each turn, C decreases by 1.\n> \n> When C=0 at the start of turn? No.\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn, including the current one. So when we say \"current turn\", the countdown is the remaining life span.\n> \n> At turn t, for a food with life span L, it will disappear after t + L - 1 turns? Let's see an example.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 1, food with life span 3: countdown 3.\n> \n> After turn 1, countdown 2 (if not eaten).\n> \n> After turn 2, countdown 1.\n> \n> After turn 3, countdown 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it is present from turn 1 to turn 3, inclusive for 3 turns? Turn 1,2,3: that's three turns, life span 3.\n> \n> Disappears after turn 3, meaning not available on turn 4.\n> \n> In this case, (1,1) life span 6 at turn 8: will disappear after turn 13, so available from turn 8 to 13 inclusive? Turn 8: countdown 6, turn 9:5, ..., turn 13:1, turn 14:0 disappears. So available until turn 13.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 9: available until turn 16 (turn 8:9, 9:8, ..., 16:1, 17:0 disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 16).\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R. Cannot move L because that would be opposite direction, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction R, so possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1). L (left) is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells x=1 to x=6 are inside, similarly y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, y:1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles also.\n> \n> List all walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 for all y and x respectively.\n> \n> Plus internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> So let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> But playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except where obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at specific points, so those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> So let's list positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,6)  // tail\n> \n> Now, food at (1,1) and (1,3)\n> \n> (1,1) is at bottom-left, (1,3) is left side, y=3.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, what are the immediate safe moves from (3,5) with direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by segment 3 of the snake. So moving there would cause collision, since it's a body segment.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving into tail, it might be ok if tail moves.\n> \n> The rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than tail is deadly. Moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,5), moving U to (3,6): (3,6) is occupied by segment 3, which is not the tail; tail is (4,6). Snake positions: indices: 0:head (3,5), 1:(2,5), 2:(2,6), 3:(3,6), 4:(4,6) tail.\n> \n> So (3,6) is segment 3, which is body, not tail.

It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)]. So these are additional walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so (x,y-1).\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Food format: (x, y, life_span, value). So (1,1,5,1) means position (1,1), life span 5, value +1. Similarly, (1,3,8,1) is (1,3), life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should consider the sequence from turn 9 to at least turn 14 or more.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Head direction D, so last move was down to (3,4)? Let's see positions: head (3,4), then (3,5) which is above, so if head is moving down, from where? Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]. Since head is first, and direction is D, that means it was at (3,5) before moving down to (3,4)? But (3,5) is the second segment.\n> \n> Let's think carefully. The list is head first, so at turn 9, head is at (3,4). The previous head position was at turn 8, which is now the second segment, (3,5). Since head direction is D, it moved from (3,5) to (3,4) between turn 8 and 9. So current direction is down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since current direction is D, reverse would be U, so I cannot move U immediately. So allowed moves: D, L, R.

Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes: (2,4) is in the list. So (2,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is also an internal obstacle? List has (4,4), yes. So (4,4) is wall.\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,4), moving left to (2,4) is wall, moving right to (4,4) is wall.

Since it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 9 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span L, then it is visible on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> In the input, it's given as life_span at current turn, so for (1,1), life_span 5 at turn 9, so it will be there from turn 9 to turn 13, and disappear at turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life_span 8 at turn 9, so from turn 9 to 16, disappear at turn 17.\n> \n> Now, back to movement. From (3,4), I can only move down to (3,3), because left and right are blocked by walls.\n> \n> Left to (2,4) is wall, right to (4,4) is wall, so only possible move is down to (3,3).\n> \n> But is (3,3) safe?

It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, because walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are inside, similarly for y. But let's list the coordinates:\n> \n> - Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake is 5 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down. So last move was down, to (3,3) from (3,4)? Positions are given head first: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. Since head is first, and direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,3). So before that, head was at (3,4), and it moved down to (3,3). Then the body: (3,4) is the neck, then (3,5), then (2,5), then tail at (2,6).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1) value 1, life span 4 (so disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 10, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 13? Let's think: life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So at turn t, it has life span L, meaning it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for a food with life span N at turn t:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, countdown becomes N-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + (N-1), countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t + N.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn 10, life span 4: can be eaten on turns 10, 11, 12, 13. Disappears before turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 7 at turn 10: turns 10 to 16, disappears before 17.\n> \n> Life span 10: turns 10 to 19.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (1,1) value 1, life span 4 → available turns 10,11,12,13\n> \n> - (1,3) value 1, life span 7 → available turns 10 to 16\n> \n> - (3,5) value 1, life span 10 → available turns 10 to 19\n> \n> All have value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> (3,5) is also a body segment? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So (3,5) is the third segment, which is occupied by the snake body. But food at (3,5) is listed. But according to rules, food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is occupied by snake, so head can't move there until the body moves away.\n> \n> I need to plan moves for turn 10 onwards.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,3)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down), so last move was down.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up immediately, because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I cannot move U on this turn. So possible actions: D, L, R. But I have to consider the grid.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,4) — but (3,4) is occupied by snake body (second segment), so moving there would cause collision. Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving, if head moves to a body segment, it's collision unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment that is not the tail is always collision. Only if moving to the tail cell is possible if the tail moves away, meaning that after the move, the head is where the tail was, and the tail moves forward, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,4): (3,4) is the neck, not tail. Tail is at (2,6). So (3,4) is occupied and not tail, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> - D to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? Internal obstacles include (3,2), which is a wall. Walls: internal obstacles (3,2) is listed, so (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> - L to (2,3): what is at (2,3)? Not listed in snake positions or obstacles? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So (2,3) is free? Obstacles: internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R to (4,3): (4,3) not in snake or obstacles? Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Also, border walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,3) is within 1-6, so ok.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) is x=2,y=3, within 1-6.\n> \n> Now, D to (3,2) is blocked by obstacle (3,2).\n> \n> U to (3,4) is occupied by body.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and I cannot move U, but U is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So actions for turn 10: L or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 13.\n> \n> - (1,3): value 1, life span 7, by turn 16.\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 10, by turn 19. But (3,5) is currently occupied by snake body. Snake is on (3,5), so to eat it, the snake must move away from (3,5) and then head move back when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is the third segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves, so segments shift.\n> \n> Let me simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] with head at (3,3).\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), new head is (2,3), then the body: neck was (3,3), which becomes the first body segment, then (3,4), then (3,5), then (2,5), and tail (2,6) moves? When head moves, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added at tail.\n> \n> But in this case, for movement, if I move to a cell without food, snake moves, tail is cut off.\n> \n> So after moving to (2,3), new positions: head (2,3), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5).

Original tail was (2,6), which is removed, so segments are head (2,3), then previous head (3,3) now body, then (3,4), then (3,5), then (2,5). So (3,5) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, if move right: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)].\n> \n> So (3,5) remains occupied until the snake moves away.\n> \n> To eat (3,5), the snake needs to move so that (3,5) is vacated, then head can move back when it's free.\n> \n> But (3,5) has long life span, so not urgent.\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,1) and (1,3).\n> \n> (1,1) is at bottom-left, (1,3) is left, same x as (1,1) but y=3.\n> \n> Also, obstacles: let's list all blocked cells for clarity.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,6), (6,3), (1,5)\n> \n> And borders.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except obstacles.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,3), can move to (2,3) or (4,3).\n> \n> I need to think about getting to the food.\n> \n> First, (1,1) has short life span, only 4 turns left, so if I want to eat it, I need to get there by turn 13.\n> \n> From (3,3) to (1,1): Manhattan distance |3-1| + |3-1| = 2+2=4, so 4 moves away.

I need to be careful with the timing.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N more turns. But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - On turn t when it's present, life_span = N\n> - After turn t, life_span becomes N-1\n> - ...\n> - When life_span = 1, after that turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,1): life_span 3 at turn 11. After turn 11, life_span=2; after turn 12, life_span=1; after turn 13, life_span=0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 11, 12, or 13.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,3), direction L (left).

Not R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to understand positions.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n> \n> But since it's a grid, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Additionally, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> So all these are blocked.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head at (2,3), body at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake occupies these cells.\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (1,3), (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) is a food position, but (3,5) is also occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, in snake positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)], so (3,5) is the fourth segment, which is part of the body.\n> \n> But food can be under the body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (3,5), it has food with life span 9, value 1.\n> \n> Since the snake body is on it, to eat it, the snake must move such that the tail moves away first, then head moves to (3,5).\n> \n> But the tail is at (2,5), which is the last segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,5), 4: tail (2,5)\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment follows, so the tail moves to where segment 3 was, etc.\n> \n> If the head eats food, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for food under the body, it can only be eaten when the cell is vacated and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) has food, but it's occupied by body segment 3.\n> \n> To eat it, we need segment to move away, so that (3,5) is empty, then head moves there.\n> \n> But since the snake moves as a whole, when the head moves, the body follows, so segment 3 will move to where segment 2 is, and so on.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> On a move, say head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - If that cell has food, snake grows: new head position, and tail stays, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> - Else, head moves, each body segment moves to previous position, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> For a cell with food under the body, like (3,5), which is occupied by segment 3.\n> \n> After a move where the head does not eat, segment 3 will move to where segment 2 was ( (3,4) ), and segment 4 (tail) will move to where segment 3 was ( (3,5) ), so (3,5) is now occupied by the new tail position? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating:\n> \n> - New head position: based on move\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to old head position\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position\n> \n> - Segment 4 (tail) moves to old segment 3 position\n> \n> So, old positions: head (2,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5)\n> \n> After move, say head moves to (new cell).\n> \n> Then new positions:\n> \n> - Head: new cell\n> \n> - Seg1: old head (2,3)\n> \n> - Seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n> \n> - Seg3: old seg2 (3,4)\n> \n> - Seg4: old seg3 (3,5)  // tail is now at (3,5)\n> \n> But (3,5) had food, and now tail is there, so the food is still under the tail.\n> \n> The cell (3,5) was occupied by seg3, now after move, seg4 (tail) is at (3,5), so the food is still covered.\n> \n> To free the cell, we need the tail to move away from it.\n> \n> That happens when the snake moves without eating, so the tail leaves its position.\n> \n> But when it leaves, the cell becomes empty, but at that moment, no one is on it, but head isn't moving to it necessarily.\n> \n> For head to eat it, we need head to move to that cell after it's free.\n> \n> But in the move sequence, when the tail moves away, the head is moving to a different cell.\n> \n> Perhaps we need to plan multiple moves.\n> \n> For example, to eat food at (3,5), which is under seg3.\n> \n> First, we need to move so that the tail moves away from (3,5), but currently tail is at (2,5), not at (3,5).\n> \n> Current tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is seg3.\n> \n> To free (3,5), we need the snake to move such that no segment is on (3,5) after some move.\n> \n> That means that in some future turn, when the snake moves, the segment that was at (3,5) moves to another cell, and no new segment moves to it immediately, so it becomes empty.\n> \n> Then, in a subsequent turn, head can move to it to eat the food.\n> \n> But the food might disappear if life span is short.\n> \n> For (3,5), life span 9 at turn 11, so it has many turns, so it's possible.\n> \n> Similarly for other foods.\n> \n> Now, back to current position.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), direction L, so last move was left to (2,3) from (3,3)? Positions: head (2,3), next is (3,3), so yes, it came from right, so current direction is left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): (2,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): (2,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): (1,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by body segment 1, so if I move right, head to (3,3), which is body, collision, death. Also, reverse is not allowed since current direction L, cannot go R.\n> \n> So move R is invalid both because of reverse and body collision.\n> \n> Now, check other moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,4) – is this free? Check obstacles and body.\n> \n> Walls: borders, x=0/x=7/y=0/y=7, (2,4) is within 1-6 in x and y? x=2, y=4, grid 0-7, so x=2 not border, y=4 not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (2,4) is in the list! Internal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is blocked by obstacle, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (2,2) – check if blocked. Borders ok? x=2,y=2, not border. Internal obstacles: (3,2) is listed, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free, but need to check if snake body is there. Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) – no (2,2), so (2,2) is free? But is it a wall? Internal obstacles don't have (2,2), borders not, so should be free.\n> \n> But walls include internal obstacles, so cells not in obstacles and not border should be free, but snake body is also occupied.\n> \n> (2,2): not border, not in internal obstacles list: internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2) – so (2,4) is there, (3,2) is there, but (2,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Snake body: all positions except head are body, but (2,2) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> L: (1,3) – left to (1,3). x=1,y=3. Borders: x=1 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so not border. Internal obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed. Snake positions: head is (2,3), so (1,3) not occupied by body. Food at (1,3) is present, but that doesn't block, it's food.\n> \n> Moving to food is fine, we eat it if possible.\n> \n> But for (1,3), it's food, so if head moves to (1,3), it eats it, since it's not under body.\n> \n> (1,3) is free, I think.\n> \n> Confirm: cells occupied: walls and snake body.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) is not in the list, so not wall.\n> \n> Snake body: positions (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) – all at y=3 or above, (1,3) not among them.\n> \n> Head is at (2,3), so (1,3) is adjacent and empty except for food.\n> \n> Food doesn't block, it can be moved onto.\n> \n> So (1,3) is available and has food.\n> \n> Now, move U to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, as per list, so blocked, cannot move.\n> \n> Move D to (2,2): not wall, not body, so free.\n> \n> Move L to (1,3): free, has food.\n> \n> Move R: invalid, as discussed.\n> \n> So possible actions: D or L.\n> \n> L goes to (1,3) with food, so eating positive food, length increases by 1.\n> \n> D goes to (2,2), no food, so no growth.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from here.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (1,3) – eat food at (1,3), value +1, life span 6. Since head moves to (1,3), which has food, so snake grows: new head at (1,3), body: old head (2,3) becomes new segment 1, then (3,3) seg2, (3,4) seg3, (3,5) seg4, and tail (2,5) stays, so snake positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? After eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added at tail.\n> \n> Standard: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> Positions: before move: head (2,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head (2,3)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 (3,4)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 (3,5)\n> \n> - New seg5: old tail (2,5)  // since new segment added\n> \n> So snake: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? (2,5) is the tail, but (3,5) is still there, and (2,5) is connected.\n> \n> Positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail (2,5). But (3,5) to (2,5) is adjacent? (3,5) to (2,5) is left, yes, but now the snake has segments at (3,5) and (2,5), which are adjacent, but (3,4) to (3,5) down? (3,4) to (3,5) is up? y=4 to y=5, so up if y increases up.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 bottom or top? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, y increasing up, or vice versa. But in coordinates, it doesn't matter, we just use positions.\n> \n> But in the food, (1,1) etc., and walls, so we need to be consistent.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,4) to (3,5) is +y, so if y increases up, it's up.\n> \n> But for the snake, the body segments are connected.\n> \n> After eating, positions: (1,3) head, then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) tail.\n> \n> Now, the segment at (3,5) has food under it? No, the food at (3,5) is still there, but now occupied by seg4 (index 4), and tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is under seg4 now.\n> \n> But we ate (1,3) food.\n> \n> Now, life span of (1,3) was 6, we ate it on turn 11, so it's gone.\n> \n> Other foods: (1,1) life span 3, (3,5) life span 9.\n> \n> After this move, head at (1,3), direction would be L, since moved left.\n> \n> Now, possible next moves from there.\n> \n> But first, let's consider the other option.\n> \n> Option 2: Move D to (2,2). No food, so no growth. Snake moves: head to (2,2), then body: seg1 to old head (2,3), seg2 to old seg1 (3,3), seg3 to old seg2 (3,4), seg4 to old seg3 (3,5), and tail moves to old seg3 position (3,5)? Old seg3 was (3,5), so new tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Positions before: head (2,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5)\n> \n> After move down to (2,2):\n> \n> - Head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Seg1: (2,3)  // old head\n> \n> - Seg2: (3,3)  // old seg1\n> \n> - Seg3: (3,4)  // old seg2\n> \n> - Seg4: (3,5)  // old seg3?

This is safe because:\n- (1, 2) is not occupied by the snake's body or any obstacle.\n- No immediate collision risk.\n\n### Future Considerations (After Moving Down to (1, 2))\n\n1. **New Snake Position**:\n   - Head: (1, 2).\n   - Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)].\n   - Tail: (2, 5) moves to (3, 5), exposing the food at (3, 5).\n\n2. **Next Moves**:\n   - From (1, 2), direction is down (D).\n   - Possible moves:\n     - Down (D): (1, 1) → has food (+1), but eating it risks trapping the snake (as analyzed in the thinking model).\n     - Right (R): (2, 2) → free, no food.\n     - Up (U): (1, 3) → occupied by the snake's body (collision).\n     - Left (L): (0, 2) → wall (invalid).\n   - Best immediate action is to **avoid eating (1, 1)** and move **Right (R)** to (2, 2) to keep the snake flexible and avoid dead ends.\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 12\n\nThe only valid immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to (1, 2). This aligns with the thinking model's conclusion that the immediate move down is forced due to constraints.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 12, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

I should note these down to avoid them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is left, so it was moving left to (1,3) from (2,3)? Let's see the positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]. So from head to tail: (1,3) is head, then (2,3), (3,3), then it turns up to (3,4), then (3,5), then left to (2,5). Head direction is L, meaning it just moved left to (1,3).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 2\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,1), it disappears after 2 turns, including this turn, so it will disappear after turn 13? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 12, life span is 2, meaning it has 2 turns left including this one. So after turn 12, life span becomes 1, and after turn 13, it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly, (3,5) has life span 8, so it has 8 turns including this one.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score while avoiding risks.

Snake positions include (3,5), which is the fifth segment. Let's list the positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (1,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: tail (2,5)\n> \n> So (3,5) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the fourth body segment (index 4).\n> \n> But food is at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 8.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So here, food is under the snake body at (3,5). To eat it, the body must move away, meaning the snake segment currently there must leave that cell, and then the head must move onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is occupied, so head can't move there now. But since food is there, if the snake moves such that the body leaves (3,5), then later head can come to eat it.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, the food is at (3,5), which is not the tail; tail is at (2,5).

On turn 13, eating the positive food at (1,1) is prioritized as it has a short life span (disappearing after turn 13) and provides a +1 score, despite the risk of temporary entrapment. Subsequent moves (right on turns 14-16) navigate towards open areas to avoid dead ends and ensure long-term survival, sacrificing the hard-to-reach (3,5) food due to distance and obstacles.\n",

        "thinking": "### Analysis of the Current State\n\n1. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Head at (1, 2), direction is Down (D).\n   - Body segments: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)].\n   - The snake cannot reverse direction immediately, so moving Up (U) is not allowed.\n\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **Down (D)**: Move to (1, 1). This cell has positive food (value 1, life span 1). Eating it would grow the snake by 1 segment.\n   - **Right (R)**: Move to (2, 2). This cell is empty.\n   - **Left (L)**: Move to (0, 2). This is a wall (x=0), so invalid.\n   - **Up (U)**: Move to (1, 3). This is a body segment, so invalid (collision).\n\n3. **Food Considerations**:\n   - (1, 1): Positive food, life span 1. If not eaten now, it disappears after this turn.\n   - (3, 5): Positive food, life span 7. Currently under the tail, so not immediately accessible.\n   - (2, 5): Positive food, life span 10. Not urgent.\n\n4. **Immediate Risks**:\n   - Moving D to (1, 1) is safe as the head is not adjacent to the tail, so no tail reward danger.\n   - Moving R to (2, 2) is also safe but misses the food at (1, 1).\n\n### Decision\n\n- **Option 1: Move D to (1, 1)**:\n  - Pros: Eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). The food disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n  - Cons: Snake becomes longer, which might complicate future movements.\n  - After eating, the snake's new positions: head at (1, 1), body at (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5).\n  - Next move from (1, 1) would be forced to R to (2, 1) (other directions are blocked or walls).\n\n- **Option 2: Move R to (2, 2)**:\n  - Pros: Snake does not grow, keeping it more maneuverable.\n  - Cons: Miss the food at (1, 1), which disappears.\n  - Next move from (2, 2) would be forced to D to (2, 1) (other directions are blocked or walls).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations\n\n- The food at (1, 1) is only available now. Missing it means losing a point, but the snake remains shorter, which might help in tight spaces later.\n- The other foods (3, 5) and (2, 5) have longer life spans, so there's time to reach them later.\n- Moving D leads to a longer snake, which might make navigating around obstacles harder, but the immediate gain is a point.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the immediate availability of the food at (1, 1) and the lack of immediate danger, the best action is to eat it. The snake can then navigate to safer areas in subsequent turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,2), then body segments at (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since D is (x,y-1). From (1,2), moving down would go to (1,1), but let's see.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning last move was down, so from (1,3) to (1,2)? Positions are listed head first: (1,2) is head, then (1,3), so if head is at (1,2) and body at (1,3), that means the snake is moving upwards? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. Head is (1,2), next segment is (1,3), which is directly above since y increases upwards? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, like in math coordinates. So (1,3) has higher y than (1,2), so it's north or up.\n> \n> Head is at (1,2), and the segment behind it is (1,3), so the head is south of the neck, meaning the snake was moving south, down, to (1,2). And head direction is given as D, which matches: it moved down to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 7?

No, let's see: \" (1, 1, 1, 1) \" and it says \"value and life span\", so probably (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> In the description: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state it's written as (x,y, value, life_span), so for (1,1,1,1) that would be x=1,y=1, value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5,7,1) is x=3,y=5, value=1, life_span=7\n> \n> (2,5,10,1) is x=2,y=5, value=1, life_span=10\n> \n> All foods have value 1, meaning they are all positive food since value is positive. Value 1, so +1 point and snake grows.\n> \n> Life span: (1,1) has life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 13, life_span=1, so if not eaten now, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) life_span=7, so it will last 7 more turns, and (2,5) life_span=10, 10 more turns.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,2), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot instant reverse, so since current direction is D, cannot go U (up) immediately, because U is opposite of D.\n> \n> D is down (y-1), U is up (y+1), so opposite, so cannot go U.\n> \n> Can go D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, check what cells are around head (1,2):\n> \n> - Up (U): (1,2+1) = (1,3) but (1,3) is occupied by snake body, so if I move there, I collide with body.\n> \n> - Down (D): (1,2-1) = (1,1) which has food? (1,1) has food, value 1.\n> \n> - Left (L): (1-1,2) = (0,2) but x=0 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right (R): (1+1,2) = (2,2)\n> \n> (2,2) is not occupied by snake or wall? Let's see walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,2) is within bounds, no internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (3,2) is an obstacle, but (2,2) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So (2,2) is not occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (1,2):\n> \n> - D: to (1,1) - has food with life span 1, but if I eat it, I grow, so new tail will be added. But need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> - R: to (2,2) - empty cell\n> \n> - U: to (1,3) but (1,3) is body segment, so collision, death. Cannot move U.\n> \n> - L: to (0,2) wall, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible moves are D or R.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (1,1), I eat the food. Value +1, snake grows to 7 segments. New head at (1,1), and the tail remains until next move? When you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; on the turn you eat, the head moves to food, consumes it, and the tail stays, so snake grows by one segment at the end of the turn or something? I need to recall snake mechanics.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail does not move that turn, so snake grows. Then next turn, tail moves as usual.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,1), I eat the food, so head is now at (1,1), and the body is still (1,2), (1,3), etc., but since I ate, the tail (3,5) doesn't move, so positions become: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — 7 segments.\n> \n> But (3,5) is also a food position? (3,5) has food with value 1, life span 7.\n> \n> But currently, (3,5) is occupied by the tail of the snake. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,5) is tail, and there is food there, but since snake is on it, I can't eat it now. Only if later the tail moves away, and head comes back.\n> \n> But for now, if I move to (1,1), I eat the food there.\n> \n> But (1,1) has life span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears after this turn. So it's now or never for that food.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> If I move R to (2,2), empty cell, no growth.\n> \n> Now, after turn 13, the food at (1,1) will disappear since life span 1 decreases to 0 and gone.\n> \n> Then I have foods at (3,5) and (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) has food with life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,5). Head is at (1,2), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent cells to tail (3,5) are (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5). (3,4) is body, (3,6) y=6? Grid is y=0 to 7, so (3,6) is within, but not occupied yet. (2,5) has food, (4,5) empty? But head is at (1,2), far away.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the map.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> (3,2) is obstacle, which is below head (1,2), but not adjacent directly.\n> \n> Head at (1,2), possible moves D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> If I move R to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction now R? Since I moved right.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U to (2,3), but (2,3) is body segment? Snake positions: after move to (2,2), the body will move: head moves to (2,2), then the segments follow: previous head (1,2) becomes body, so positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (2,3) is still there, so if I go to (2,3), it's body, collision.\n> \n> Let's simulate turn by turn.\n> \n> Current turn 13, snake: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Head direction D.\n> \n> I choose action for turn 13.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (1,1)\n> \n> - Eat food at (1,1), life span 1, so it disappears after eaten.\n> \n> - Snake grows: new positions: head at (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — 7 segments.\n> \n> - Food (1,1) is gone.\n> \n> - Remaining food: (3,5) with life span 7 (but it's under tail, so not eatable yet), and (2,5) with life span 10.\n> \n> - Head now at (1,1), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Now, for next turn, turn 14.\n> \n> From (1,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,2) — but (1,2) is now body segment (second segment), so collision.\n> \n> - D: to (1,0) — y=0 is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> - L: to (0,1) — x=0 wall, cannot.\n> \n> - R: to (2,1)\n> \n> (2,1) is free? Check: not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is one, but (2,1) not listed, so free. Snake body: positions after growth: (1,1) head, (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So (2,1) not occupied.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (2,1). Because U, D, L all blocked or wall.\n> \n> U is body, D wall, L wall, only R possible.\n> \n> So if I move D on turn 13, then on turn 14 I must move R to (2,1).\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), head at (2,1), direction now R (right).\n> \n> Body: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (3,5) moves? When I moved to (1,1) on turn 13, I ate, so tail didn't move. On turn 14, I move to (2,1), so the tail should move: the last segment (3,5) is removed, and new head position added.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves out of last cell. When eating, head moves to food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, turn 13: I moved to (1,1) and ate, so positions: head (1,1), body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — 7 segments.\n> \n> Turn 14: I move to (2,1). Since I didn't eat (no food at (2,1)), so head moves to (2,1), and tail (3,5) moves off, so new positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). Tail was (3,5), but since not eaten, it moves to the previous segment? The last segment is removed.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), the body segments follow: the neck was (1,1), so it becomes body at (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), and (3,4) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n> \n> Previous positions: head (1,1), segments: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> After move to (2,1): new head at (2,1), then the first body segment is the old head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). The last segment (3,5) is removed because no growth, so snake is now 6 segments: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)? (3,4) was before (3,5), so after removal, tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), then (1,2), then (1,3), then (2,3), then (3,3), then (3,4). So (3,4) is tail.\n> \n> But (3,4) is where the food was? (3,5) had food, but (3,5) is no longer occupied, so the food at (3,5) is now exposed and can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) has food.\n> \n> Now head at (2,1), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1):\n> \n> - U: (2,2)\n> \n> - D: (2,0) y=0 wall, cannot\n> \n> - L: (1,1) but (1,1) is body segment (second segment), collision\n> \n> - R: (3,1)\n> \n> (2,2) and (3,1) possible? (2,2) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not body. Body positions: (2,1) head, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). So (2,2) not occupied.\n> \n> (3,1): not border, not internal obstacle? Internal: (5,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But (3,2) is internal obstacle! (3,2) is in the list: internal obstacles include (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is obstacle, so (3,1) is adjacent, but (3,1) itself is not obstacle, unless specified.\n> \n> (3,2) is obstacle, so (3,1) is free, but moving to (3,1) might be possible, but then from there, if I go up to (3,2), it's blocked.\n> \n> From (2,1), U to (2,2) is possible, R to (3,1) is possible.\n> \n> L to (1,1) body, D wall.\n> \n> So on turn 14, after moving to (2,1), I can go U or R.\n> \n> But this is if I chose D on turn 13.

Tail (3,5) moves off? Since no eat, tail moves: last segment (3,5) removed, so positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). 6 segments, tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (1,1) disappears after turn 13 since life span 1, not eaten.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) was under tail, but tail moved, so now (3,5) is empty and food is there, exposed.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) still there.\n> \n> Head now at (2,2), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: (2,3) but (2,3) is body segment (third segment?

Not wall, not obstacle, not body. Body: (2,2) head, (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4).

It's turn 14. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). Snake positions: head at (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (1,1) down would be to (1,0), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down from (1,1) to (1,0) is impossible because it's a wall.\n> \n> Head direction is D, and current position is (1,1). Moving down from (1,1) would be to (1,0), which is a border wall, so that cell is invalid. But the snake is at (1,1) with direction D, meaning it must have come from above, but let's see the positions: positions are [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ...] head is (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), etc. If head is at (1,1) and the next segment is (1,2), which is above it, since y increases up? No, let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The walls are given as y=0/y=7, and snake positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), etc. If (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3), that means y is increasing, so moving up. But head direction is D, down, which should be decreasing y.\n> \n> Inconsistency here. Head direction is D, down, but from the positions, if head is at (1,1) and previous was (1,2)? Positions are listed head first: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] so (x0,y0) is head, (x1,y1) is the first body segment, etc.\n> \n> So head at (1,1), then (1,2), which is directly above if we assume y increases upwards. But direction is D, down. That means the snake was moving down to (1,1), so from where? Before (1,1), it must have been at (1,0), but (1,0) is a wall, so it can't be there. This is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is the bottom, and y increases upwards? Let's see the walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. And internal obstacles. Snake positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> If head is at (1,1) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (1,1). But from where? The previous position before head would be where it came from. Since positions are head first, the tail is last: (3,5). So the snake was moving from (1,2) to (1,1), I think. Let's think of the path.\n> \n> The positions are in order: head: (1,1), then segment 1: (1,2), segment 2: (1,3), segment 3: (2,3), segment 4: (3,3), segment 5: (3,4), segment 6: (3,5). So the snake is at (1,1) head, then up to (1,2), up to (1,3), right to (2,3), right to (3,3), up to (3,4), up to (3,5). But direction is given as D, down. How can direction be down if it's at (1,1) with (1,2) above it?\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current moving direction. But if it's at (1,1) with direction D, it means it is facing down, so it would move to (1,0) next, but (1,0) is a wall, so it can't move there. But that can't be right because the snake is alive at turn 14, so it must be able to move.\n> \n> Unless the direction is the direction it moved to get to the current position. Let's read the input: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and it says \"Snake Positions\" with head first. Also, in movement constraints, it says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", so current direction is important for the no reverse rule.\n> \n> Perhaps I have the coordinate system wrong. Let's assume that y=0 is the bottom, so increasing y is up. Then (1,1) to (1,2) is up, to (1,3) is up, then to (2,3) is right (east), to (3,3) is right, to (3,4) is up, to (3,5) is up. But the head is at (1,1), and if direction is D (down), that means it is facing down, so it would move to (1,0) if it could, but (1,0) is a wall.\n> \n> But the snake has segments above it, so it must have been moving down to (1,1) from (1,2)? But (1,2) is the first body segment, so the head moved from (1,2) to (1,1) by moving down. So current position is (1,1), and it moved down to get there, so direction is D. Now, for the next move, it can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Moving down to (1,0) is impossible because it's a wall, so it can only move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Moving U would be to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied by the body, so that would be a collision, unless the body moves away. But at the moment of movement, the head cannot move to a cell occupied by the body, except for the tail if it moves.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to the tail's current position, it's ok because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (3,5), not near head. Head is at (1,1), body at (1,2), so moving up to (1,2) would be into the body, which is not the tail, so it would collide and die.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (0,1) but x=0 is wall, so invalid. Moving right to (2,1)? (2,1) is free? I need to map the grid.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (1,1)\n> \n> Body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  // so tail at (3,5)\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,5,6,1)  // position (3,5), value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,5,9,1)  // position (2,5), value 1, life span 9\n> \n> Food format: (x, y, life_span, value) I think. It says: (3, 5, 6, 1) and (2, 5, 9, 1), so (x,y, life_span, value), with value=1 for both, so both are positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Value 1, so +1 food.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,5) is 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 14, life span 6, so it will disappear at turn 14 + 6 - 1? Let's see: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L turns, disappearing at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 14, life span 6, it will disappear after turn 19? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 14, countdown=6, turn 15:5, ..., turn 19:1, turn 20:0, so it disappears at turn 20? I think \"disappears after N turns\" means it is present for N turns from now, so at turn 14, life span 6, it will be gone at turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5), life span 9, disappears at turn 23.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Head at (1,1), direction D (down). Since it just moved down to (1,1), it cannot move down again (reverse), and down is wall anyway. It can move up, left, or right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,2) - but (1,2) is occupied by body segment, and it's not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> - Down (D): not possible, wall and reverse.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,1) - x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,1) - let's check if free.\n> \n> (2,1): is it wall? Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders x=0,7 y=0,7. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2) — (2,1) not in list, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — (2,1) not occupied, so moving right to (2,1) is possible.\n> \n> But is (2,1) safe? Yes, no wall, no body except tail, but tail is far.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), so (2,1) is empty.\n> \n> So the only possible move is right to (2,1). Is that correct?\n> \n> Move options: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: to (1,2) - occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> D: to (1,0) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> L: to (0,1) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> R: to (2,1) - free, so only possible move is R.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead. Also, food is at (3,5) and (2,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is currently occupied by the tail! Food at (3,5), and tail is at (3,5), so the food is under the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is another food.\n> \n> Now, about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, at turn 14, food at (3,5) is under the tail.\n> \n> Life span 6, so it has 6 turns left.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,5) life span 9.\n> \n> Now, snake must move. Only possible move is to (2,1) via right.\n> \n> But let's confirm the direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down), so after moving right, the new direction will be R.\n> \n> Then for next turn, cannot move left (opposite of R).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, turn 14: must move R to (2,1).\n> \n> Then snake positions after move: head moves to (2,1), so new head (2,1), then the body: since head moved, the tail moves? When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), the new positions: head at (2,1), then previous head (1,1) becomes body, so (1,1) is now first body segment, then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (3,5) is removed since no food eaten. Tail was at (3,5), and since no food, tail moves off.\n> \n> New positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)]  // tail was (3,5), removed, so snake has 7 segments, after move without eating, length same, tail removed, so now 6 segments?
