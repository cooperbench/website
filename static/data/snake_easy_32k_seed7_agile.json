I can choose to move U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but I need to avoid instant reverse. Since it's moving left (L), I cannot move right (R) on the next turn because that would be instant reverse. So possible moves are U, D, or L.\n> \n> Instant reverse rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from L, opposite is R, so I can't move R.

So the inner grid where snake can be is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls for all y. y=0 and y=7 are walls for all x. So the accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. But (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> (5,2) is given as internal obstacle, so it's like a wall.\n> \n> So playable cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, except (5,2).\n> \n> Now, head at (3,3).\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6).\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), which is within playable area, and (5,2) is obstacle below it, so (5,3) might be accessible, but let's see.\n> \n> (5,3): x=5, y=3, which is between 1 and 6, and not (5,2), so it should be accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) and (5,6) are accessible.\n> \n> Now, life span: all food has life_span 10 at turn 0. So after each turn, life_span decreases by 1. So at turn 0, life_span=10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns, so it can be eaten until turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life_span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> So for food with life_span 10 at turn 0, at turn 0: countdown 10, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 1: countdown 9, can be eaten.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 9: countdown 1, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 10: countdown 0, disappears, cannot be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to movement.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for turns 0,1,2,3,4,... at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Since the snake is short, I can go for nearby food.\n> \n> Closest food: (5,3) is at distance 2 in x-direction, same y.\n> \n> (1,1) is at Manhattan distance |3-1| + |3-1| = 2+2=4.\n> \n> (5,6) is |3-5| + |3-6| = 2+3=5.\n> \n> So (5,3) is closest, but I can't go directly right because of direction.\n> \n> From (3,3), direction L, so if I move left to (2,3), I go away from (5,3).\n> \n> If I move up to (3,4) or down to (3,2), I can then turn towards (5,3).\n> \n> But (5,3) is at (5,3), and there's an obstacle at (5,2), but that doesn't block (5,3) directly.\n> \n> Also, I need to think about eating it.\n> \n> If I eat (5,3), since snake is at (3,3), I need to move to (4,3) then to (5,3).\n> \n> But to go to (4,3), I need to move right, but current direction is left, so I cannot move right on turn 0.\n> \n> So I have to change direction first.\n> \n> Possible actions turn 0:\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> - U: to (3,4)\n> \n> - D: to (3,2)\n> \n> If I go U to (3,4), then direction is U, so I can then move R to (4,4) or U to (3,5), etc.\n> \n> Similarly, if D to (3,2), direction D, then I can move R to (4,2) or D to (3,1), etc.\n> \n> If L to (2,3), direction L, then I can move L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2), but not R.\n> \n> Now, to reach (5,3), I need to go right at some point.\n> \n> Since I can't go right from (3,3) due to direction, I must first move perpendicular.\n> \n> Let me consider going for (1,1) or (5,6), but (5,3) is closer.\n> \n> (5,3) is only 2 steps away if I could go right, but I can't directly.\n> \n> Minimum turns to reach (5,3): from (3,3), I need to be able to move right.\n> \n> So, if I move up or down first, then I can move right on next turn.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> Turn 0: move U to (3,4), now direction U\n> \n> Turn 1: move R to (4,4), now direction R\n> \n> Then from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), but (5,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down.\n> \n> (4,4) to (5,3) is not adjacent; adjacent are (5,4), (4,3), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> From (4,4), to reach (5,3), I need to move to (4,3) or (5,4) first, but (4,3) is below, (5,4) is right.\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), so from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), then R to (5,3).\n> \n> Or move R to (5,4), then D to (5,3).\n> \n> But let's see the path from start.\n> \n> After moving to (3,4) on turn 0, direction U.\n> \n> Turn 1: I can move R to (4,4), direction R\n> \n> Then turn 2: from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), direction D\n> \n> Then turn 3: from (4,3), move R to (5,3), direction R, and eat food.\n> \n> But when I move to (5,3) on turn 3, if food is there, I eat it.\n> \n> At turn 0, food at (5,3) has life span 10, so it will be there until turn 9, so turn 3 is fine.\n> \n> Similarly, other options.\n> \n> If I move D on turn 0 to (3,2), direction D\n> \n> Turn 1: move R to (4,2), direction R\n> \n> Then turn 2: move R to (5,2), but (5,2) is an obstacle!

(4,3) has no food, food is at (5,3), so snake now [(4,3)], direction D\n> \n> - Turn 3: move R, to (5,3), there is food, so eat it, snake grows. Now snake has two segments: head at (5,3), and tail at (4,3)? When snake moves to (5,3), it eats, so new head at (5,3), and since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so positions: before move, snake was [(4,3)] (one segment), after moving to (5,3) and eating, snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3)], head at (5,3), tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, via down path:\n> \n> - Turn 0: move D to (3,2), no food, snake [(3,2)], direction D\n> \n> - Turn 1: move R to (4,2), no food, snake [(4,2)], direction R\n> \n> - Turn 2: move U to (4,3), no food, snake [(4,3)], direction U\n> \n> - Turn 3: move R to (5,3), eat food, snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Same result.\n> \n> Now, is there a shorter way?

R to (6,3), but x=6, y=3, is that wall? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not wall, y=3 between 1-6, so (6,3) is accessible? Playable area x=1 to 6? Earlier I thought x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7 for all y, y=0, y=7 for all x. So for y from 0 to 7, x=0 and x=7 are walls. For x from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> So the corners are walls, but the inner cells are (x,y) with 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6, except obstacles.\n> \n> (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except (5,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> So (6,3) is playable, since x=6, y=3, 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6, not (5,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) etc.\n> \n> Back to after eating at (5,3): snake at [(5,3), (4,3)], head direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,4)\n> \n> - D to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so impossible\n> \n> - R to (6,3)\n> \n> - L to (4,3) but (4,3) is the tail, but when I move, the tail will move, so I can move to tail cell if it moves away.\n> \n> Movement rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So if I move L to (4,3), which is current tail, but after move, head moves to (4,3), and tail moves... let's see.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3), tail (4,3)\n> \n> If I move L to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by tail. But since tail will move after head moves, it might be ok.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, if I move head to (4,3), which is current tail position, and after head moves, the tail moves to where the next segment was or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if snake is [H, B1, B2, ...], after moving head to new position, the new body is [new_head, old_head, old_B1, ...] except if not growing.\n> \n> If not eating, when head moves to new cell, tail moves out of its cell.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to new position, the segment that was head is now the first body segment, and the tail segment is removed if not growing.\n> \n> But if growing, tail stays.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (5,3), snake is [(5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Now, if I move head to a new cell, say (6,3), then new head at (6,3), and body at (5,3), so snake becomes [(6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Tail moved from (4,3) to nowhere, since not growing.\n> \n> If I move to (4,3), which is current tail position.\n> \n> Move head to (4,3). But (4,3) is occupied by tail. But at the time of move, head moves to (4,3), and since it's the tail, and we are not eating (assuming no food there), then after move, head is at (4,3), and the tail was at (4,3), but it moves to the previous position of the first body segment.\n> \n> Before move: positions [head: (5,3), body: (4,3)] but since only two segments, body is also tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,3): the new head is at (4,3), and the body should move to where the head was, which is (5,3). But (5,3) is now empty? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: the segment that was head moves to new position, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So when head moves from (5,3) to (4,3), the body segment at (4,3) should move to where the head was, (5,3). But (5,3) is now free, so new positions: head at (4,3), body at (5,3).

Wait, life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns. Turn t: life span decreases to N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. Here, all food has life span 9 at turn 1, so it will last until turn 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, food has life span L. After each turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn? Or before? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think: when food spawns, it has life span N. On each turn, including the turn it spawns, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn. So for food with life span 9 at turn 1:\n> \n> - Turn 1: life span 9\n> \n> - Turn 2: life span 8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 9: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 10: life span 0, disappears after turn 10?

Since it decreases including current turn, after turn N, it should be gone.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, L becomes L-1. If L was 1, after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for life span 9 at turn 1:\n> \n> - After turn 1, life span becomes 8\n> \n> - After turn 2, becomes 7\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 9, becomes 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 1 through 9, and disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, all food here has life span 9 at turn 1, so they last until after turn 9.\n> \n> Now, food values:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, positive food\n> \n> - (5,3): value 1, positive\n> \n> - (5,6): value 1, positive\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, but this is at (3,4), which is where the snake head is currently.\n> \n> (3,4) has food with value 1 and life span 10? Wait, life span 10? Let's see:\n> \n> Food: (1,1,9,1) — I think this means (x,y, life_span, value), so (1,1) with life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3,9,1) — (5,3) life=9, value=1\n> \n> (5,6,9,1) — (5,6) life=9, value=1\n> \n> (3,4,10,1) — (3,4) life=10, value=1\n> \n> But (3,4) is where the snake head is. The rule says: food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, the snake has only one segment, so no body. The head is at (3,4), and there's food there. Since there's no body, can the snake eat it immediately?\n> \n> The rule: \"the body moves away\" — but there is no body, so perhaps it can be eaten right away.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But here, no tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, since the snake is alone, moving onto (3,4) might not be possible because it's already there? But on the next turn, if it stays, but it has to move.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 1, snake is at (3,4) with direction U. The food at (3,4) can be eaten if the head moves onto it, but it's already on it? So perhaps on this turn, since the head is on the food, it might be eaten at the beginning or something.\n> \n> I need to clarify the timing.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it and grows.\n> \n> But here, the head is already on a cell with food at the start.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions\" include (3,4) with value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> And snake is at (3,4).\n> \n> So, since the food is under the head, and there's no body, the snake should be able to eat it immediately, I think.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, there is no body, so \"the body moves away\" is vacuously true? Or does it not apply?\n> \n> Also, for eating, when does it happen? At the end of the turn or during?\n> \n> I think I need to assume that at the start of turn 1, the head is on (3,4) with food, so if it stays or moves, but it has to move to eat or something.\n> \n> Perhaps the food is eaten when the head is on the cell at the time of movement decision.\n> \n> Let's read the core rules.\n> \n> It doesn't specify the exact timing, but from \"Special Cases\": food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Since there is no body here, moving the head to (3,4) is not possible because it's already there. So probably, at the start, since head is on food, it can be eaten immediately, but the snake hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> This might be ambiguous.\n> \n> To simplify, I think for this case, since the snake is on the food at turn 1, it should eat it when the turn starts or something. But let's see the action sequence.\n> \n> The action is for the movement on turn t1.\n> \n> At turn t1, I need to choose an action: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> After moving, if the head is on a food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> But here, at turn 1, before moving, head is on (3,4) with food. So if I move away, I might not eat it, or if I stay, but I can't stay; I have to move to an adjacent cell.\n> \n> Directions are U, D, L, R, so I can't stay in place; I must move.\n> \n> So at turn 1, head is at (3,4) with food. I choose a direction to move to a new cell.\n> \n> If I move to, say, (3,5) U, then head leaves (3,4), and since the body moves away (but no body), the food at (3,4) is still there, and I haven't eaten it because I didn't move onto it; I moved away.\n> \n> Then, to eat it, I need to move back to (3,4) later, but that might be dangerous or inefficient.\n> \n> If I don't move, but I have to move.\n> \n> Perhaps at the start of the turn, before moving, since head is on food, it eats it automatically. But the rule doesn't say that.\n> \n> Let's read the rule again: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" implies that eating happens when the head moves to that cell.\n> \n> So if the head is already on it at the start, it might not be considered \"moved onto\".\n> \n> This is confusing.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, I should look for similar cases or assume that for food under the head at start, it can be eaten if the head doesn't move or something, but it must move.\n> \n> Another idea: perhaps the food is eaten when the head occupies the cell after movement, but at turn start, it occupies, so for the first turn, if food is under head, it is eaten immediately, and then the snake moves.\n> \n> But the rule doesn't specify.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, in this context, since the snake is short and no body, moving from (3,4) will leave the food, and to eat it, I need to come back.\n> \n> But that seems wasteful.\n> \n> Let's check the life span: the food at (3,4) has life span 10, so it will last longer, until after turn 10.\n> \n> Other food has life span 9, so after turn 9 they disappear.\n> \n> At turn 1, life span 9 for (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), and 10 for (3,4).\n> \n> So (3,4) has one extra turn.\n> \n> But for now, I need to decide the action for turn 1.\n> \n> Also, snake head direction is U, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so from U, I cannot move D, because that's opposite.\n> \n> Current direction U, so possible moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, available moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: not allowed because reverse, and current dir U, so D is opposite.\n> \n> - L: to (2,4)\n> \n> - R: to (4,4)\n> \n> Also, check walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so all these cells are within bounds, no wall at (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). Internal obstacle at (5,2), but that's not relevant here.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4) is under head. If I move away, I leave the food, and to eat it later, I need to return, but that might be risky or inefficient.\n> \n> If I could eat it now, but how?\n> \n> Perhaps on this turn, since the head is on food at the start, it is eaten before movement. I think that's a reasonable assumption, otherwise it doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Let me assume that at the beginning of turn 1, since head is on food, it eats it, so the snake grows, and then I move.\n> \n> But the snake positions are given as [(3,4)], so after eating, it should be longer.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Positions: [(3,4)]\" and food at (3,4), so after eating, the snake would have two segments: head and tail, both at (3,4) for a moment, but when it moves, the tail stays or moves?\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Let's clarify the growth rule.\n> \n> Typically, when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the new tail is added at the end, but the tail doesn't move that turn, so the length increases.\n> \n> Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 1 start, head at (3,4) with food. If I assume that it eats it at start, then snake grows to length 2, with head and tail both at (3,4). Then when I move, say U to (3,5), the head moves to (3,5), and the tail remains at (3,4) for that turn, so positions become [(3,5), (3,4)].\n> \n> Then next turn, the tail moves when head moves again.\n> \n> If I don't eat at start, and I move to (3,5), then head is at (3,5), no food there, so no eat, positions [(3,5)], and food at (3,4) remains.\n> \n> Then to eat it later, I need to move back to (3,4), which might cause collision if there's body.\n> \n> But since snake is short, it's ok, but inefficient.\n> \n> I think for consistency with the rule, \"the head moves onto the food cell\" means that eating happens when the head moves to that cell from another cell.\n> \n> So if head is already on it, it doesn't eat unless it moves away and back.\n> \n> But that seems odd for the start.\n> \n> Perhaps the food at (3,4) can be eaten only if the snake moves to it later.\n> \n> To resolve, let's look at the life span: it has life span 10, so I have time to eat it later.\n> \n> Other food has life span 9, so I should prioritize those if they are at risk of disappearing.\n> \n> But let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think, but x=0,7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see:\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7), etc. all are walls.\n> \n> So the snake can only be on cells where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, I think, but the walls are the cells, so if x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, those cells are occupied by walls and cannot be moved to.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) is not a wall; it's inside.

However, moving towards the highest-value food (`(3, 4)` with value 8) is a reasonable choice, even though it cannot be eaten this turn. This is because:\n- Moving `L` to `(3, 5)` brings the snake closer to `(3, 4)`, which might be useful if food respawns in the future (though the problem does not specify respawning).\n- This move is safe and does not restrict future movement options.\n\n### Action for Turn 3\n\\boxed{L}",

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (4, 4)**:\n   - Moves the head to (4, 4).\n   - Next step: Move Down (D) to (4, 3), then Right (R) to (5, 3) to eat the food by turn 7.\n   - This sequence ensures the snake eats (5, 3) efficiently.\n\n2. **Alternatives**:\n   - Moving Down (D) to (3, 5) is safe but delays reaching food.\n   - Moving Left (L) to (2, 4) moves away from the closest food.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (4, 4), setting up the path to (5, 3).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,4), and the body is at (3,5). Since the head direction is D (down), that means the snake is moving downwards. So from (3,4) down to (3,5), which makes sense because (3,5) is directly below (3,4).\n> \n> The snake has only two segments: head at (3,4) and tail at (3,5). So it's a short snake.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned. Life spans: three with 5 turns, one with 9 turns. Current turn is 5, so for the life span 5 foods, they will disappear after turn 5? Let me read the life-span rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N, it appears at turn t, and disappears at turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume that at the turn it's listed, the countdown is life_span. So for food at (1,1), life_span=5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after 5 more turns? Or after turn 5 + 5 = 10?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But it says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: when food is spawned, it has a life_span N. Each turn, including the turn it appears, the countdown decreases by 1. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, if it appears at turn T with life_span N, at turn T, countdown=N; after turn T, countdown=N-1; ... after turn T + N - 1, countdown=1; after turn T + N - 1, it is still there, but after that turn, countdown decreases to 0 and it disappears, so it's not available on turn T + N.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if life_span is N, the food is present for N turns, from the turn it's listed until turn T + N - 1, and disappears at turn T + N.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given at turn 5 with life_span, so for (1,1): life_span=5 at turn 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns from now? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1. When L-1 reaches 0, it disappears for the next turn.\n> \n> But for decision, on turn t, if life_span >0, the food is present and can be eaten.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 5:\n> \n> - (1,1): life_span=5, so after turn 5, it becomes 4, and so on. It will disappear after turn 5 + 5 = 10, meaning not available on turn 10, but available on turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): life_span=5, same.\n> \n> (5,6): life_span=5.\n> \n> (5,1): life_span=9, so it lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,4), direction down, so moving to (3,5) next if no action, but we choose action.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since current direction is D (down), we cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> So forbidden move: U.\n> \n> Allowed moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> D would be continuing down to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently the tail.\n> \n> Let's see the positions: snake positions [(3,4), (3,5)], so head at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> If we move D to (3,5), that is where the tail is now.\n> \n> But according to rules, moving into the tail cell is allowed because the tail will move away, so no collision, as long as it's not a body part that stays.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So if we move to (3,5), which is the current tail, after moving, the head is at (3,5), and the tail was at (3,5) but moves away? Let's think about snake movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and if it doesn't eat, the tail moves off its current cell, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> In this case, if we move head to (3,5), which is currently occupied by the tail, but since the snake is moving, the tail will leave that cell, so it's ok, no collision.\n> \n> Moreover, since we're moving to the tail, and if there is food there, but in this case, there is no food at (3,5), I think. The food positions are given, none at (3,5).\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,1). No food at snake positions.\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) is safe.\n> \n> But if we move D to (3,5), since it's the tail, and we're not eating, the snake moves, head to (3,5), and tail moves from (3,5) to... when we move, the head goes to new position, and the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n> \n> Since we're not eating, the length stays the same, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Initial positions: head (3,4), body (3,5) — only two segments.\n> \n> After move D: head moves to (3,5), and since no food eaten, the tail (3,5) is removed, but it's the same cell? Confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail moves off the last cell.

Now, (3,5) was the tail, so the head is now at (3,5), and the tail was at (3,5), but since we moved and no growth, the tail is removed, so now the snake has only one segment? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In snake, when the head moves, it goes to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position. For a snake of length L, after moving without eating, the head is at new position, the body segments shift, and the last segment (tail) is left, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But with two segments: positions [A, B] where A is head, B is tail.\n> \n> After moving head to a new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has no food, then new positions: [C, A], so the tail moves from B to A, and B is empty.\n> \n> - If C has food, then new positions: [C, A, B], so tail is still B, but now body is longer.\n> \n> In this case, current: head (3,4), tail (3,5). Let's call H = (3,4), T = (3,5).\n> \n> If we move down to (3,5), which is T.\n> \n> But (3,5) is currently occupied by tail. When we move head to (3,5), since (3,5) is the tail, and we're moving to it, but in terms of collision, it's allowed because the tail will move away.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (3,5). Since we moved to a cell that was tail, and no food there (assumed), so no growth. Therefore, the tail is removed, and the new snake is just [ (3,5) ], but that would be a snake of length 1? That doesn't seem right.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard implementation: the snake is a list of positions. When moving, the head is added at the new position. If no food eaten, the last element (tail) is removed. If food eaten, the tail is not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> So for two segments: positions [H, T]\n> \n> Move head to new cell N.\n> \n> If N has no food, new positions: [N, H] , and T is removed, so now snake is [N, H], with head at N, tail at H.\n> \n> Previously head was at H, now head at N, and the segment that was at H is now the body, and T is gone.\n> \n> In this case, from [ (3,4), (3,5) ] move to (3,5).\n> \n> N = (3,5)\n> \n> But (3,5) is currently occupied by T.

The input says \"value1, life_span1\" for each, and for (5,1) it's 8,1? No: \" (5, 1, 8, 1) \" – I think it's (x,y, life_span, value).

Let's calculate expiration.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, it will be present until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 6, life_span=4, so:\n> \n> - Turn 6: present, life_span=4\n> \n> - After turn 6 (before turn 7), life_span decreases to 3\n> \n> - Turn 7: present, life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 8: present, life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 9: present, life_span=1\n> \n> - After turn 9, life_span=0, so not present on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, for life_span=4, it is available from turn 6 to turn 9 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 6,7,8,9: 4 turns.\n> \n> Life span N at turn t means it will be available for N more turns, including current, so turns t to t+N-1.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3) and (5,6), life_span=4, available turns 6-9.\n> \n> (5,1) life_span=8, available turns 6 to 13 (since 6+8-1=13).\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> I need to get to food, but also avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards the food at (5,3), which is close.\n> \n> (5,3) is at x=5,y=3, head at (4,4).\n> \n> From (4,4), to reach (5,3), I can go D to (4,3), then R to (5,3)? But from (4,3) to (5,3) is right.\n> \n> Or directly, but from (4,4), (5,3) is down-right, but I can only move one step, so not directly.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is up from (4,4)? (4,4) to (5,6) is not adjacent; (5,6) is right and up, but not directly reachable in one step.\n> \n> (1,1) is far, and (5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> So cells: for example, row y=1: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 except (5,1) is food, (5,2) is obstacle, so (5,1) is accessible? (5,1) is a cell, it has food, but (5,2) above it is obstacle, but (5,1) itself is not obstacle, it's just a cell with food.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4).\n> \n> I should consider each move and simulate a few steps.\n> \n> First option: Move R to (5,4) on turn 6.\n> \n> After turn 6: head to (5,4), snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> No food eaten, so length still 2.\n> \n> Now, from (5,4), possible moves: since I moved R, current direction R, so I can go U, D, R, not L (left, to (4,4), which is the body, but (4,4) is the body segment.\n> \n> If I go L to (4,4), that's where the body is, so collision? The rule: body collision if head touches any body segment, but when moving, the tail moves, so it might be ok.\n> \n> Let's read the collision rule.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (5,4), the body is at (4,4), which is the old head.\n> \n> If I then move left back to (4,4), but at that point, when I move, the tail is at (4,4), and I move head to (4,4), but since tail moves forward at the same time? The movement happens simultaneously: head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so the cell (4,4) is vacated when tail moves.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, and tail leaves its cell, so if head moves to the cell that was tail, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to the current tail position, and since tail moves, there is no collision because the tail is no longer there when head arrives.\n> \n> But in this case, for a length 2 snake, if head is at A, tail at B.\n> \n> After move, if head moves to B, and tail moves to? When head moves to new position, the body follows, so for length 2, if head moves to a new cell, say C, then snake becomes [C, A], and B is removed.\n> \n> If head moves to B, which is the current tail position, then after move, head at B, and the body is [B, A], but A was head, so now body at A? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial: positions [H, T] = [ (4,4), (3,4) ]\n> \n> If head moves to (5,4), new positions: head at (5,4), body at (4,4), so [ (5,4), (4,4) ], and (3,4) is empty.\n> \n> If from (5,4), I move left to (4,4). (4,4) is currently occupied by the body segment.\n> \n> But when I move head to (4,4), at the same time, the tail (which is at (4,4)) moves to where? In the sequence, when head moves to a new cell, the body segments shift, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, from state [ (5,4), (4,4) ], head at (5,4), body at (4,4).\n> \n> If I move head left to (4,4), that cell is currently occupied by the body, but when head moves to (4,4), the body segment at (4,4) will become the new head? No.\n> \n> The head moves to the new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, head moves to (4,4), which is the position of the first body segment.\n> \n> Then, the first body segment (at (4,4)) moves to where? It doesn't have a previous position; the body segments move to the position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to new cell, the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1, but for the tail, it is removed if no growth.\n> \n> In this case, positions: index 0: head at (5,4), index 1: body at (4,4)\n> \n> When head moves to (4,4), the new head is at (4,4), and the body that was at (4,4) needs to move, but there is no segment before it; since it's only two segments, the body segment moves to where the head was, but head is moving to a new position.\n> \n> After head moves to (4,4), the body segment at (4,4) should move to the position that the head left, which is (5,4), but (5,4) is the previous head position.\n> \n> Generally, for a snake of length L, when it moves without eating, the head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment towards the head, but it's easier: the tail is removed, and the new head is added.\n> \n> So from [ (5,4), (4,4) ], if head moves to (4,4), then the new positions are: head at (4,4), and the body is at (5,4)? No.\n> \n> The segment that was at (4,4) was the body, now it becomes the new tail, and since head moved to (4,4), which is the same position, but when head moves to (4,4), the cell (4,4) is now the head, and the old body at (4,4) is no longer there; it moves to the next position, but there is no next; the tail is removed.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let me clarify with coordinates.\n> \n> State before move: head at (5,4), body at (4,4). So cells occupied: (5,4) and (4,4).\n> \n> Now, if head moves to (4,4), which is currently occupied by the body.\n> \n> But when the move happens, the head moves to the new cell, and the body segments shift: the body segment at (4,4) will move to the position where the head was, but the head was at (5,4), so the body moves to (5,4)? That doesn't make sense because (5,4) is the head position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell. Then, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> For a snake with segments: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n> \n> When moving, S0 moves to a new position P. Then S1 moves to old position of S0, S2 moves to old position of S1, and so on, Sk (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So in this case, S0 at (5,4), S1 at (4,4).\n> \n> If S0 moves to (4,4), which is the position of S1.\n> \n> Then S1 must move to the old position of S0, which is (5,4).\n> \n> So new positions: S0 at (4,4), S1 at (5,4).\n> \n> But S1 at (5,4) is the body, and S0 at (4,4) is head.\n> \n> Now, the cell (4,4) was occupied by S1, but when S0 moves there, it's now head, and S1 moves to (5,4).\n> \n> So no collision, because the cell is vacated by the body before head moves in, or simultaneously, but in terms of grid, at the moment of move, the head occupies (4,4), and body occupies (5,4), so (4,4) is not occupied by body when head moves there; it's the same cell, but the body is moving away.\n> \n> Practically, it's allowed to move to the tail position because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,4) from (5,4) would be moving left, to the cell that was body, but since the body moves to (5,4), it should be ok, no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, you can move to the tail cell because it will be vacated.\n> \n> But for other body cells, not tail, it would be collision.\n> \n> Here, from (5,4), moving to (4,4) is moving to the only body cell, which is the tail, so it should be allowed.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other directions.\n> \n> But let's list possible moves from each position.\n> \n> Back to turn 6.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction R.\n> \n> Moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,5)\n> \n> - D to (4,3)\n> \n> - R to (5,4)\n> \n> All are valid, no walls or obstacles immediately.\n> \n> Now, let's think about food.\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), which is down from (4,4)?

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> - Snake positions: Head at (4,3), body at (4,4). Since it's only two segments, the snake is short. Head direction is down (D), which means it's moving towards decreasing y, so from (4,4) to (4,3) if it moved down last turn? Let's see: positions are [(4,3), (4,4)]. Head is first, so (4,3) is head, (4,4) is tail. Direction is D, meaning it was moving down to (4,3) from (4,4)? But if it moved down from (4,4) to (4,3), that would be decreasing y, so from higher y to lower y.\n> \n> Standard coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so increasing y is up, increasing x is right.

So at turn 7, it has life span 3, so it will be gone after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it will be present for N more turns, including the current one.

If no food, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> In this case, snake has two segments. If head moves to a cell without food, it moves to that cell, and tail moves to where head was, so the snake shifts.\n> \n> Positions: head at (4,3), tail at (4,4).\n> \n> If head moves to a new cell, say (x,y), and no food there, then new head is (x,y), and new tail is (4,3), so body is [(x,y), (4,3)].\n> \n> If there is food, new head is (x,y), tail stays, so positions become [(x,y), (4,3), (4,4)]? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at head position.\n> \n> But here, positions are stored. So if head moves to a cell with food, the head moves there, and since it grows, the tail remains, so the body gains a segment.

That's 5 moves, but at turn 7, I can move on turn 7,8,9 to reach by turn 9? Turn 7: move, turn 8 move, turn 9 move. So in three moves, I can reach cells within Manhattan distance 3.\n> \n> From (4,3) to (1,1): delta x = -3, delta y = -2, so Manhattan dist 5. So in three moves, I can reach at best (1,3) or (2,2) etc., not (1,1). For example, after three moves, I can be at (1,3) if I go left three times, but (1,3) to (1,1) is two down, so not reachable by turn 9. Turn 9 is the last turn to eat, so I need to be at (1,1) on turn 9 or before.\n> \n> But from turn 7, with moves on turn 7,8,9, I can move three times.\n> \n> Start at (4,3) turn 7.\n> \n> After one move turn 7: say to (3,3) or (4,2) or (5,3).\n> \n> If to (3,3), turn 8 to (2,3), turn 9 to (1,3), but (1,3) is not (1,1), and (1,1) is at distance 2, not reachable on turn 9. Similarly, if I go down first, to (4,2) turn 7, then to (4,1) turn 8, then to (4,0) or (5,1) or (3,1), but (1,1) still far. So impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 9 with three moves. Manhattan distance is 5, I have only three moves, so I cannot reach (1,1) in time. Similarly, (1,1) will disappear after turn 9, so I can only eat it on turn 7,8,9, but I can't reach it, so (1,1) is not eatable for me. I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): at (5,6), from (4,3), delta x=1, delta y=3, Manhattan dist 4. Can I reach in three moves? For example, turn 7 move to (5,3) eat, then turn 8 move to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,5), but (5,5) to (5,6) is one up, not reached. Or if I go up directly, but from (4,3) I can only move D,L,R, not U. So cannot go up immediately.\n> \n> If turn 7 move R to (5,3), then turn 8 move U to (5,4), turn 9 move U to (5,5), still not (5,6). (5,6) is at y=6, (5,5) is y=5, so need another move to (5,6) on turn 10, but food gone. So cannot eat (5,6) by turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, from other paths, with three moves, from (4,3) to (5,6) min moves 4, e.g., R to (5,3), U to (5,4), U to (5,5), U to (5,6). Four moves, but I have only turns 7,8,9 to act, so on turn 9 I can be at (5,5), not (5,6). So impossible to eat (5,6) in time.\n> \n> Therefore, the only food I can eat with short life span is (5,3), which is adjacent, so I should eat it on turn 7.\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), adjacent right, so I can eat it on turn 7 by moving right.\n> \n> Then (1,1) and (5,6) I cannot reach in time, so they will disappear uneaten.\n> \n> For (5,3), if I don't eat it on turn 7, I can eat it later, but only if I move to it on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 7 I move down to (4,2), then on turn 8 I can move R to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot, or from (4,2) I can move R only to (5,2) which is wall, or L to (3,2), or D to (4,1).\n> \n> From (4,2), turn 8, can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1), since U forbidden and R to (5,2) wall.\n> \n> If move to (3,2), then turn 9 from (3,2) can move to (3,3), (3,1), (4,2) but (4,2) is body if I came from there? Positions: after turn 7, at [(4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> Turn 8 move to (3,2), no food, so head (3,2), tail to (4,2)? Head to (3,2), tail moves from (4,3) to where? Positions become [(3,2), (4,2)]? When head moves to new cell, tail moves to previous head position.\n> \n> Start: turn 7, from [(4,3),(4,4)] move D to (4,2) no food, so new head (4,2), tail removed, so body is [(4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> Then turn 8, from (4,2) move L to (3,2) no food, so head to (3,2), tail moves to (4,2)? Previous head is (4,2), so tail moves to (4,2), but that was head, now body. New positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), but (4,2) was head, now it's the body segment, and tail was (4,3), but since no growth, tail is removed, so positions [(3,2), (4,2)].\n> \n> Then turn 9, from (3,2) can move to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), or (4,2) but (4,2) is body, cannot.\n> \n> (3,3) has no food, (5,3) is at (5,3), which is two right and one up, not reachable from (3,2) in one move. So cannot eat (5,3) on turn 9.\n> \n> If on turn 8 from (4,2) I moved D to (4,1), then positions [(4,1), (4,2)], then turn 9 from (4,1) can move D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) which has food, but (5,1) is at (5,1), so I can move R to (5,1) and eat it, but (5,1) has life span 7, so I can eat it later, not urgent. But (5,3) is not eaten.\n> \n> Point is, from (4,1), I can move to (5,1) but not to (5,3) directly.\n> \n> So if I don't eat (5,3) on turn 7, I cannot eat it later because I can't reach it by turn 9 from other positions easily, and with the moves available, it's unlikely.\n> \n> For example, only if I stay near, but on turn 7 if I move left to (3,3), then turn 8 to (3,4) or something, but (5,3) is at (5,3), from (3,3) I can go to (4,3) on turn 8, but (4,3) might be occupied.\n> \n> After turn 7 move L to (3,3) no food, positions [(3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Then turn 8 from (3,3) can move to (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), or (4,3) but (4,3) is body, cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,3) is body, so cannot move to it.\n> \n> To reach (5,3), I need to go right, but from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) only if it's free, but it's occupied.\n> \n> So impossible to move to (5,3) from there directly.\n> \n> On turn 9, from positions, it might be harder.\n> \n> Therefore, the only way to eat (5,3) is to do it on turn 7 by moving right.\n> \n> Since it's the only short-life food I can eat, and it gives +1, I should eat it.\n> \n> Moreover, if I don't eat it, I miss the point.\n> \n> So for turn 7, I think moving R to (5,3) is best.\n> \n> Then after that, I need to plan the sequence.\n> \n> So turn 7: move R to (5,3), eat food, snake grows to length 3: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4)], direction R.\n> \n> Now turn 8: from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3), since D to (5,2) wall, L to (4,3) body, cannot.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (6,3), there is food at (6,3), so I eat it, grow to length 4: positions [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)].\n> \n> But then as before, I might get stuck.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,4) instead, no food, so head to (5,4), tail moves off (4,4), so positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), and (4,3)?

Positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] with (4,3) as tail? Let's index.\n> \n> After move to (6,4) no eat: the new head is (6,4), the first body is the old head (6,3), the second body is the old B1 (5,3), and the third body is the old B2 (4,3), and the old T (4,4) is gone. So positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] with length 4 still? No, since no eat, length should not increase.\n> \n> Length was 4 after eating. When no eat, we move, head to new, bodies shift, tail is removed, so length decreases by one? No.\n> \n> In snake, when you don't eat, you move, the head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail position is vacated. So the length remains the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> For example, from [H, B1, T] with 3 segments.\n> \n> After move to new cell no eat: [new, H, B1] so still 3 segments, but now B1 is tail.\n> \n> Similarly, with 4 segments: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After move no eat: [new, H, B1, B2] so tail is B2 now.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (6,3), positions: [H=(6,3), B1=(5,3), B2=(4,3), T=(4,4)]\n> \n> T is (4,4), B2 is (4,3).\n> \n> Then move to (6,4) no eat: new head (6,4), then body segments: old H (6,3) becomes new B1, old B1 (5,3) becomes new B2, old B2 (4,3) becomes new T, and old T (4,4) is removed. So positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] with (4,3) as tail.\n> \n> Length still 4.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go D to (6,2) from (6,3), same thing.\n> \n> But back to turn 8 decision.\n> \n> If I go U at turn 8 to (5,4), no eat, positions become [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] since tail (4,4) removed, length 3.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse, so since I just moved U, I cannot go D next turn.\n> \n> Also, positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), tail (4,3).\n> \n> Now, (5,4) is head.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> U to (5,5): y+1\n> \n> D to (5,3): but (5,3) is body, and also instant reverse?

Let's define.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and after turn t+L-1, it disappears at the start of turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, turn 8, life span 2: present on turn 8 and 9, gone on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 6: present from turn 8 to 13, gone on turn 14.\n> \n> Life span 9: turn 8 to 16.\n> \n> Now, (1,1) is far away, at (1,1), snake is at (5,3) or (6,3), it's 4 steps away in x and 2 in y, so at least 4 moves to reach, but by turn 9, only one more turn after this, so impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 9 from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (5,3), (1,1) is |5-1|=4 in x, |3-1|=2 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, but with obstacles, but min moves 6. Turn 8, I can move on turn 8 and turn 9, so two moves, can only reach cells within distance 2. (1,1) is distance |5-1| + |3-1| = 4+2=6, so impossible to reach by turn 9. Similarly, from (6,3) even farther.\n> \n> (5,6) is at (5,6), current (5,3), |y-6|=3, so distance 3. On turn 8, I can move to (5,4) or (6,3), then turn 9, from there.\n> \n> If I go U to (5,4) on turn 8, then on turn 9, from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5), or L to (4,4), or R to (6,4), but not directly to (5,6). From (5,4) to (5,6) is two steps up, but I need to go U then U again, but on turn 9, if I go U to (5,5), then on turn 10 to (5,6), but food disappears after turn 9, so on turn 10 it's gone, cannot eat.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 8, life span 2, so after turn 8, it becomes 1, present on turn 9. After turn 9, it becomes 0, gone on turn 10. So can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> But (5,6) is at distance 3 from (5,3), so with one move on turn 8, I can be at (5,4) or (6,3), both distance 2 from (5,6)? (5,4) to (5,6) is |4-6|=2, so two moves away. But I have only one move after turn 8 to reach by turn 9.\n> \n> Turn 8: move to some position.\n> \n> Turn 9: move to (5,6) if possible.\n> \n> From turn 8 position, if I am at (5,4) after turn 8, then on turn 9 I can go U to (5,5), but not directly to (5,6) because I can only move one cell. From (5,4) to (5,6) requires two moves: to (5,5) then (5,6).\n> \n> But on turn 9, I can only make one move, so I can be at (5,5) on turn 9, not (5,6). (5,6) can only be reached on turn 10 if I go up twice.\n> \n> But food must be eaten by turn 9, so on turn 9 I need to be at (5,6).\n> \n> But from any position after turn 8, I cannot be at (5,6) on turn 9 with one move.\n> \n> After turn 8, if I moved U to (5,4), I am at (5,4) at start of turn 9.\n> \n> From there, I can move U to (5,5) on turn 9, but (5,5) is not (5,6).\n> \n> If I moved R to (6,3) on turn 8, at (6,3) start turn 9, I can move U to (6,4) or D to (6,2), not to (5,6).\n> \n> Distance to (5,6) is |6-5| + |3-6| =1+3=4, far.\n> \n> So impossible to eat (5,6) by turn 9.

Snake was [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]. After moving head to (5,5), the body follows: new positions: head (5,5), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, and (5,3) becomes the new tail? Let's see: when snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail segment is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> No food eaten, so length same. So new positions: head to (5,5), then the first body segment moves to (5,4), and the tail segment moves to (5,3). But the tail was at (4,3), and it moves to where the previous segment was? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, the head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So positions: before move: [head: (5,4), seg1: (5,3), seg2: (4,3)]\n> \n> After move U: head to (5,5), then seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (5,3).

Snake grows: head to (6,3), new tail not removed, so positions: head (6,3), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, and the body segments follow, but since growth, a new segment is added at the tail position before move? Standard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, body segments move, but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Before move, snake positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> After moving head to (6,3) and eating food, new head at (6,3), then the first body segment moves to (6,4) (previous head), second body segment moves to (5,4) (previous position), and the tail stays or a new segment is added?

Food positions: (1,1), (5,6), (5,1), (6,3) — none at (4,3), so no issue now.\n> \n> But after moves, it might be.\n> \n> For example, if I move to eat (6,3), tail is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (6,3)? (6,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But when I eat at (6,3), the head moves to (6,3), and tail is at (5,3), which is adjacent, but the danger is only if I eat the food under the tail or something? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, the food must be on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> In this case, if tail cell has food, and head moves to that cell to eat, but head moving to tail cell: when you move to eat food, the food is on a cell, not necessarily tail.\n> \n> The danger is: if the tail cell has food (meaning food is on the current tail position), and the head is adjacent to the tail, then if head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the head is there, and the tail grows, but since head was adjacent, now the new tail is where the old tail was, but head is on the food cell, which was tail, so when snake grows, the new tail is added at the old tail position, so head is on (old tail), and new tail is also on (old tail)? Confusion.\n> \n> Let's parse: suppose tail is at position T, and there is food on T. Head is adjacent to T. If head moves to T to eat the food, then: head moves to T, eats food, so the snake grows. The new head is at T, the body segments shift, so the previous tail position is kept as the new tail segment. But since the food was on T, and T is eaten, the cell is cleared. After growth: head at T, then the first body segment at previous head position (which was adjacent), then other segments, and a new tail segment is added at the position of the old tail, which is T, but T is now the head, so the new tail would be at T? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments move such that each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but since food is eaten, the tail segment does not move, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added in the direction of movement? No.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves forward to the food cell, and because food is eaten, the tail does not retract, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> Positions: let’s say before move, snake segments: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail)\n> \n> Head moves to new cell, which has food.\n> \n> Then, segment S1 moves to old S0 position, S2 to old S1, ..., Sk (tail) moves to old Sk-1 position? But since food eaten, the tail does not move; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is created at the old tail position? I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Common implementation: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the last segment (tail) is not removed, so the snake increases in length by one. The new segment is effectively added at the position where the tail was before the move, but since the tail moves to the previous segment's position, it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps: after the move, the head is at the new cell, and all previous segments remain, with an additional segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> Example: before move, positions: H, B, T\n> \n> Head moves to F (food), then new head at F, B moves to H, T moves to B? But if food eaten, T does not move; instead, T stays, and B moves to H, so new positions: F (head), H (body), T (tail) — but H and T might be the same if no body, but here body exists.\n> \n> In this case, snake has three segments: positions P0, P1, P2.\n> \n> Move to new cell N with food.\n> \n> New positions: P0_new = N (head), P1_new = P0 (old head), P2_new = P1 (old body), and a new segment P3_new = P2 (old tail).\n> \n> So now four segments: N, P0, P1, P2.\n> \n> The old tail position P2 is now occupied by the new tail segment.\n> \n> In the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, meaning food is on the current tail position.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to that tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the head is on that cell, and the new tail is added at the old tail position, which is the same cell? But that cell is now the head, so it's impossible to have two things on one cell.\n> \n> The danger is that after growth, the head and the new tail would be on adjacent cells that cause collision, but the text says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In the scenario: before move, head is adjacent to tail, say head at A, tail at B, with B having food.\n> \n> Head moves to B to eat food. After move: head at B, body segments shift, so the segment that was body moves to A, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position B. But B is now the head, so adding a new segment at B would put two segments on B, which is collision immediately.\n> \n> So the snake dies because of self-collision.\n> \n> Hence, you cannot eat food that is on the current tail cell if the head is adjacent to the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for us, tail is at (4,3), no food there, so no danger now.\n> \n> But after moves, it could happen.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Let's list possible action sequences.\n> \n> First, option: go for (6,3) quickly.\n> \n> On turn 9, move R to (6,4)\n> \n> Then turn 10, from (6,4) dir R, can move D to (6,3) to eat food.\n> \n> As above, after eating, snake at [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)] with dir D.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,3), dir D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but dir D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n> \n> So can move D, L, R.\n> \n> D to (6,2): (6,2) is within bounds, y=2>0, x=6<7, no wall, and not body?

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail is safe because when the head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,4), that's the body segment. But (5,4) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) would cause collision because (5,4) is a body segment that won't move away immediately; only the tail moves when the head eats or something.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added at tail, so tail doesn't move, but the segment before becomes new tail or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food, snake grows: the tail stays, and a new segment is added, so length increases.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves off its cell, so the cell becomes empty.\n> \n> But for collision: head collides if it moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except that if it's the tail cell and we're not eating, it might be safe, but only if the tail is moving away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> And \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But for movement to tail cell: it should be safe to move to the tail cell if no food is eaten there, because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) - is this free? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> Food is at (5,6), (5,1), (6,3), (6,1). (6,5) has no food mentioned, so probably empty.\n> \n> - Down: (6,3) - there is food at (6,3) with value 1.\n> \n> - Left: (5,4) - occupied by body segment (second segment), not tail. Tail is (5,3). So moving to (5,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> - Right: (7,4) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Up to (6,5) or Down to (6,3).\n> \n> Down to (6,3) has food.\n> \n> But I need to think about the consequences.\n> \n> Also, head direction is R, so if I move Up or Down, it's not reverse, since reverse would be Left, which is impossible anyway.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, which is not possible, so Up and Down are fine.\n> \n> Now, life_span: food at (5,6) has life_span 1, so it must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> But (5,6) is at x=5,y=6. Current head at (6,4).\n> \n> To reach (5,6) from (6,4) in one move: not possible, since not adjacent. (6,4) to (5,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share x or y differing by 1.\n> \n> (6,4) to (5,6): Δx=1, Δy=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So I cannot eat (5,6) this turn because it's not reachable. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn, and I cannot eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,1), (6,3), (6,1).\n> \n> (6,3) is directly below at (6,3), so I can move down to eat it.\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is left and down, but not adjacent to (6,4).\n> \n> (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is down, but y=1, while (6,4) to (6,1) is not adjacent; y difference 3.\n> \n> So only immediate option is to move down to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n> \n> Move up to (6,5) which is empty.\n> \n> But (5,6) has short life, but I can't reach it, so it's lost.\n> \n> Now, if I move down to (6,3), I eat the food, snake grows.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) has value 1, life_span 7, but since I eat it, life_span doesn't matter.\n> \n> After eating, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)] so 3 segments.\n> \n> After eating at (6,3): head moves to (6,3), which has food, so snake grows. New head position (6,3), then the body: since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (6,3), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (5,4) becomes body, and tail (5,3) stays, so snake: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)] length 4.\n> \n> (6,3) was food, now head.\n> \n> Now, what about the direction?

This path avoids the (5,2) wall and ensures long-term survivability by exiting the constrained area afterward.",

It's turn 11, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and there's one internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,3), then body segments at (6,4), (5,4), and tail at (5,3). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. That means from (6,3), moving down would go to (6,2), but I need to see possible moves.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - At (5,1) with value 1 and life span 4. Since it's turn 11, this food will disappear after 4 turns, so by turn 15 (11 + 4 = 15, and it decreases including current turn, so it has from turn 11 to 14? Life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 11, life span is 4, meaning it will be there for turns 11,12,13,14, and disappear on turn 15? The problem says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, so it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn. After turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until it reaches 0, when it disappears. So if N=4 at turn 11, then:\n> \n> - Turn 11: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 12: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 13: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 14: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 15: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 11,12,13,14.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food: (6,1) with value 1 and life span 9. So it has a long time, from turn 11 to turn 19 (since 11 + 9 - 1 = 19? Turn 11: life span 9, then decreases to 0 at turn 20? Let's not overcomplicate; it has many turns left.\n> \n> Both foods have value 1, so both are positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,3), direction down. Possible moves: I can go up, down, left, right, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so I cannot instantly reverse to U (up) next turn. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up on this turn.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid walls and my own body, but with the tail exception.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,4) but (6,4) is occupied by the body segment. Is this a collision? The body segment at (6,4) is the second segment, so if I move there, head would be at (6,4) and that segment is still there, so it's a collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> The snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3). So (6,4) is the first body segment after head. If I move up to (6,4), I'm colliding with my own body at (6,4), which is not the tail; tail is at (5,3). So that would be deadly.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,2). Is this within bounds? y=2, x=6. Walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,2) is within bounds, no wall there. Also, is it occupied? Snake positions: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) — none at (6,2), so it should be safe for now.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,3). (5,3) is the tail. Now, moving to tail: when I move to (5,3), the tail will also move, so it might be safe. After moving, the head goes to (5,3), and the tail moves away. So no collision if it's the tail. Here, tail is at (5,3), so if I move left to (5,3), since the tail moves, it should be ok.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,3). x=7 is a border wall? Walls: x=0 or x=7 are borders, so x=7 is a wall, so (7,3) is out of bounds or wall, so collision with wall.\n> \n> x=7 is border, so moving to (7,3) would hit the wall.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,4) — body collision, not tail, deadly\n> \n> - D: to (6,2) — seems safe, no obstacle\n> \n> - L: to (5,3) — tail position, but since tail moves, it should be safe\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) — wall, deadly\n> \n> So only D and L are possible without immediate death.\n> \n> But L to (5,3) is the tail, which is safe because the tail moves. But I need to consider the food aspect.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,1) and (6,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is below, and (6,1) is also below.\n> \n> Grid: y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases upwards, I assume. Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) — so if y increases, it's moving to higher y, which is up.\n> \n> Similarly, D (x,y-1) down.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), with U increasing y, so higher y is north or up.\n> \n> But in the grid, borders y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Or vice versa? U (x,y+1) from (x,y) to (x,y+1), so if y+1, it's moving to a higher y, which should be north if we think of Cartesian coordinates with origin bottom left.\n> \n> But in terms of walls, it doesn't matter; we just know the cells.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,3), food at (5,1) and (6,1). Since D is down, to (x,y-1), so from (6,3) down to (6,2), then to (6,1) is further down.\n> \n> (5,1) is left and down from head.\n> \n> Head (6,3), (5,1) is x-1, y-2, so southwest, but we move one step at a time.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) and (6,1) both have y=1, which is above y=0, so within bounds.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (5,1) has life span 4, so it will disappear on turn 15 or after 4 turns? As I thought, it can be eaten until turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) has life span 9, many turns.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 11.\n> \n> I can go down (D) to (6,2) or left (L) to (5,3).\n> \n> If I go left to (5,3), that's the tail.

It's turn 12, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid since coordinates go from 0 to 7 inclusive. There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (6,2), then body segments at (6,3), (6,4), and tail at (5,4). The head direction is D, which means down. Since it's moving down, the head is at (6,2), and it was previously at (6,1) or something? Let me think about the direction. Head direction D means it moved down to reach (6,2), so it came from above, probably from (6,1) to (6,2) since down increases y? No.\n> \n> Coordinates: typically, in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U increases y, which might be north or up, and D decreases y, which is down. But in terms of the plane, if y increases up, then (x,y+1) is up, (x,y-1) is down. But let's confirm with the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,2) head, (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). Head at (6,2), body at (6,3), which has higher y, so if y increases, (6,3) is above (6,2), but head is at (6,2) with direction D, down. Direction D means it's facing down, so moving to lower y.\n> \n> From positions: head (6,2), next segment (6,3). If head is at (6,2) and moving down to (6,1)? But (6,3) is above it? I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> List positions in order: index 0: head (6,2), index 1: (6,3), index 2: (6,4), index 3: (5,4). So from head to tail: (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (5,4). Since head is at (6,2) and next is (6,3), which has same x, higher y, so (6,3) is above (6,2) if y increases upwards. But direction is D, down, which is decreasing y. That means the snake was moving down to (6,2), so it came from (6,3) to (6,2)? But (6,3) is the body segment, not the previous head position.\n> \n> I think I misinterpreted the positions. The positions are given as a list: head first, then body segments in order. So at turn 12, head is at (6,2), which it just moved to. Previous head position was at turn 11, but we don't have that. Direction D means that on turn 12, it moved down to (6,2), so from (6,3) to (6,2)? But (6,3) is listed as the first body segment.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So at turn 12, head is at (6,2), which was the position it moved to. Before that, at turn 11, head was at, say, P, and after moving down, head is at new position, and body segments follow.\n> \n> Given positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Since head is at (6,2), and it moved down, that means previous head was at (6,3), because moving down from (6,3) to (6,2) decreases y. (6,3) to (6,2) is down if y decreases down.\n> \n> Define coordinate system: U: (x, y+1) — so y+1 is up, I assume.\n> \n> D: (x, y-1) — y-1 is down.\n> \n> L: (x-1, y)\n> \n> R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Not specified, but from movements.\n> \n> In positions: head (6,2), body (6,3). (6,3) has y=3, head y=2, so if y increases up, (6,3) is above (6,2), so the body is north of head. But direction is D, down, meaning the snake is facing south, towards decreasing y.\n> \n> At turn 11, head was at (6,3), and it moved down to (6,2) for turn 12. Then the body segments: (6,3) was head at turn 11, now it's the first body segment at turn 12. Then (6,4) was the first body at turn 11, now second body, and (5,4) was tail at turn 11, still tail but moved to where the previous segment was? When head moves from (6,3) to (6,2), the body segment that was at (6,3) moves to where? The list shows (6,3) as first body, which is the position it occupied before, but now it's a body segment.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the positions are the current locations at turn 12.\n> \n> Head at (6,2), which it just moved to by going down from (6,3). Then the segment that was at (6,3) is now part of body, but in the list, it's still at (6,3) because the snake didn't grow, so positions are: head at new position (6,2), then the previous positions are shifted: the segment that was head is now at (6,3), but since it moved, (6,3) is occupied by the first body segment, which was previously at (6,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> At turn 11: assume positions were head at (6,3), then body at (6,4), and tail at (5,4), and perhaps another segment? The snake has 4 segments: positions list has 4 elements, so length 4.\n> \n> At turn 11, before move: head at (6,3), body at (6,4), body at (5,4), and tail at? Positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] but that's only three, no: current positions at turn 12 have four: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] so at turn 11, it must have had four positions, say head at (6,3), body at (6,4), body at (5,4), and tail at (5,5) or something, but not given.\n> \n> When the snake moves down to (6,2), the head moves to (6,2), then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at (6,3) moves to where? The first body segment moves to the previous head position, which was (6,3), but since head was at (6,3), it moves to (6,3)? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the cell where the next segment was. So if positions at time t: head H, then B1, B2, ..., T\n> \n> At time t+1, head moves to new position, say H', then B1 moves to H, B2 moves to where B1 was, etc., and the tail moves to where the last body was, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 12, positions: head at (6,2) new, then B1 at (6,3) which was previous head, B2 at (6,4) which was previous B1, and B3 at (5,4) which was previous B2/tail. Previous tail was at some position, but it's not there anymore.\n> \n> For example, at turn 11, positions might have been: head (6,3), B1 (6,4), B2 (5,4), and tail (5,5) or something, but we don't care. Current state is at turn 12.\n> \n> So current snake positions: head (6,2), body segments at (6,3), (6,4), and tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Direction is D, down, so it just moved down to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, including current, so at turn 15 it will be gone. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 12, life span 3, turn 13:2, turn 14:1, turn 15:0 and gone.\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 8, so disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value 1 each.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think. But there's an internal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So available cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,2), which is bottom-right if y=0 is bottom, but let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so (6,2) is x=6, y=2, which is near the bottom, since y=0 is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,1) and (6,1). (5,1) is x=5,y=1, (6,1) x=6,y=1.\n> \n> y=1 is above y=0 wall, so (6,1) is the bottom row, since y=0 is wall.\n> \n> Grid: rows y=0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to 6 are playable, similarly x=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1 is the bottom row of playable area, y=6 top.\n> \n> Head at (6,2), which is one row above bottom.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) and (6,1), both on the bottom row, y=1.\n> \n> (6,1) is directly below head, since head at (6,2), down to (6,1) is adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is left and down from head? Head (6,2), (5,1) is x-1, y-1, so diagonal, not adjacent directly. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So from (6,2), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (6,3) - but occupied by body segment\n> \n> - Down: (6,1) - has food\n> \n> - Left: (5,2) - but this is a wall, obstacle\n> \n> - Right: (7,2) - but x=7 is wall, so cannot move\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so right is invalid.\n> \n> Head at (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,3) - but occupied by body segment (6,3), so if I move there, collision with body, death.\n> \n> - D: (6,1) - has food, and not occupied by body?

Let's list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (6,3) - body\n> \n> - South: (6,1) - food, and empty except food\n> \n> - West: (5,2) - wall\n> \n> - East: (7,2) - wall\n> \n> Yes, so only possible move is down to (6,1).\n> \n> But (6,1) has food, so I will eat it if I move there.\n> \n> The food at (6,1) has value +1, and life span 8, so it's positive food.\n> \n> If I move down, I go to (6,1), eat the food, so snake grows, length increases by 1.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), so positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]?

It's turn 13, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (6,1), then body segments at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail at (5,4). So the snake is 5 segments long. The head direction is down, which is D, meaning it's moving towards increasing y? No, in standard coordinates, down usually decreases y, but let's check the movement constraints.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it's moving down, meaning decreasing y. From (6,1), moving D would go to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't move down. Current head is at (6,1), direction D. If it moves D, it would go to (6,1-1) = (6,0), which is a border wall, so that would be a collision. But the snake must move, so I need to choose a different direction, but I have to consider the no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move U on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (6,1), with current direction D, I can move L, R, or D, but D is into wall, so invalid. L would be to (5,1), R to (7,1), but x=7 is border wall, so R to (7,1) is invalid because x=7 is wall. Similarly, D to (6,0) is wall. So only possible move is L to (5,1). Is that right?\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so (7,1) is invalid. y=0 is wall, so (6,0) invalid. (5,1) is not a wall, I think. Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,1) should be free, I assume, unless specified.\n> \n> Food positions: one at (5,1,2,1) – that's (x,y, life_span, value), so (5,1) with life_span 2, value 1 (positive food). Another at (2,2,10,1), so (2,2) with life_span 10, value 1.\n> \n> (5,1) has food with life_span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 13, life_span=2, so it will disappear after turn 14? Let's see: life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> At turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + L. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1 it's L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1 it's 1, and at turn t+L it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (5,1): turn 13, life_span=2, so countdown=2. After this turn (turn 13), countdown becomes 1. After turn 14, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 13 or 14.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,2): life_span=10, so it will be around for a while.\n> \n> Now, back to movement. Snake head at (6,1), direction D. Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,1+1) = (6,2) – but (6,2) is a body segment, so collision? No, let's see snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]. So (6,2) is the first body segment. If head moves to (6,2), it would collide with the body segment there, since it's occupied by snake body. But is it deadly? Body collision is deadly unless it's the tail, and the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly except if it's the tail segment, because after moving, the tail moves away, so head and tail won't occupy the same cell.\n> \n> In this case, (6,2) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4). So moving to (6,2) would cause collision with body segment at (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (6,0) is wall collision.\n> \n> Moving L to (5,1): what's there? It has food, but let's see if it's safe.\n> \n> (5,1) is not a wall, not a body segment? Snake positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (5,4). So (5,1) is not occupied by snake, I think. Positions are given, so (5,1) should be free except for the food.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,1): x=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: cannot move U because opposite to D.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,1). Is that correct? U is opposite? Current direction is D, which is down. Opposite is U, up. So I cannot move U this turn.\n> \n> But moving U to (6,2) is also a body collision, so it's invalid anyway.\n> \n> Similarly, D is wall.\n> \n> R is wall.\n> \n> So only L to (5,1) is possible.\n> \n> But (5,1) has food? Yes, positive food at (5,1).\n> \n> If I move to (5,1), I eat the food, since head moves onto it. Value +1, snake length increases.\n> \n> But is there any danger? \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,4). Head is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to (5,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,1) and (5,4) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = |6-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be, for example, (5,1) and (5,2) or (4,1), etc.\n> \n> Head at (6,1), tail at (5,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> So moving to (5,1) should be safe, and I eat the food.\n> \n> But let's think ahead. I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, current turn 13, I must choose an action for turn 13.\n> \n> Only possible move is L to (5,1), I think.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: positions (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). So it's like a vertical line from (6,1) to (6,4), then left to (5,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,1) and (2,2).\n> \n> For head at (6,1):\n> \n> - Move U to (6,2): but (6,2) is body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Move D to (6,0): y=0 wall, death.\n> \n> - Move L to (5,1): free? (5,1) is not wall, not snake body? Snake body is at (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4); (5,1) is not listed, so it should be free. And there's food.\n> \n> - Move R to (7,1): x=7 wall, death.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse, but U is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, when I move to (5,1), I eat the food there? Since head moves onto food cell, and it's positive, so I get +1 score, and snake length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows: new head at (5,1), and the tail doesn't move? When snake eats, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place for that turn? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail. But in terms of positions, when head moves to a new cell with food, the body follows, but since it grows, the tail remains, so the new position has head at food, and all body segments shift, with tail not moving.\n> \n> For example, current positions: [H: (6,1), B1: (6,2), B2: (6,3), B3: (6,4), T: (5,4)]\n> \n> If head moves to (5,1), and eats food, then new positions: head at (5,1), then the previous head becomes body, so [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4) ]? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> If head moves to new cell, and it eats food, then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake: at each turn, the head moves to an adjacent cell. If that cell has food, then the snake grows, so the tail remains in place (no movement of tail), effectively adding a new segment at the tail. If no food, the tail moves forward, so the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to a new cell without food: new positions [new H, H, B1, B2, ..., T'] where T' is the position T moved from, but since tail moves, T is removed, so positions are [new head, previous head, B1, ..., second to last].\n> \n> For example, current: [H, B1, B2, T] with H at (6,1), B1 at (6,2), B2 at (6,3), T at (5,4)? In this case, positions are [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)], so let's index: S0 = head (6,1), S1 = (6,2), S2 = (6,3), S3 = (6,4), S4 = tail (5,4).\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say to (5,1).\n> \n> If no food at (5,1), then new positions: head at (5,1), then S0 moves to (5,1), so S1 moves to where S0 was? Standard: the new head is the new position, then each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So after move, new head at new_pos, then segment 1 goes to old S0, segment 2 to old S1, ..., last segment (tail) goes to old second last position.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (5,1), no food, then new positions: head at (5,1), then S1 (which was at (6,2)) moves to old head position (6,1), S2 (was (6,3)) moves to (6,2), S3 (was (6,4)) moves to (6,3), and tail S4 (was (5,4)) moves to (6,4)? S3 was (6,4), so S4 moves to old S3 position (6,4), but (6,4) is where S3 was, so tail moves to (6,4).\n> \n> So positions become: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) ]? S1 moves to (6,1), which is old S0, S2 to (6,2) old S1, S3 to (6,3) old S2, S4 to (6,4) old S3.\n> \n> But old S3 was (6,4), so S4 moves to (6,4), but (6,4) was occupied by S3, but S3 moves away, so it's free.\n> \n> Then the cell (5,4) is now empty.\n> \n> But if there is food at (5,1), and I move to it, I eat it, so snake grows. Then the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position. So the positions become: head at (5,1), then S0 moves to (5,1), so S1 moves to old S0 (6,1), S2 to old S1 (6,2), S3 to old S2 (6,3), S4 to old S3 (6,4), and since it grows, a new tail is added at old tail position, which is (5,4)? Old tail was at (5,4), and it doesn't move, so new segment at (5,4).\n> \n> After growth: new head at new position (5,1), then the previous head becomes body, so (6,1) is now body, then (6,2) still body, (6,3) body, (6,4) body, and tail stays at (5,4) but since it grows, the tail position remains, and it's now part of the body, with a new tail? I think I have it.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows as usual, but the tail does not move, so the last segment stays, making the snake longer.\n> \n> For example, positions before move: [S0, S1, S2, S3, S4] with S4 tail.\n> \n> After moving to a cell with food: new positions [new_head, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4] so the tail S4 remains, and new_head is added, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of cells: new head at (5,1), then S0 at (6,1) becomes the first body segment, S1 at (6,2) becomes next, etc., up to S4 at (5,4) which is still tail? S4 was tail, but now it's the second last, and the new tail is... in the list, S4 is still there, but it was the tail, now it's not tail anymore? Positions: after growth, the snake has segments: new position (5,1) as head, then the old positions: S0, S1, S2, S3, S4 all remain, so S4 is still the tail, but since no movement, S4 is at (5,4), and it's the tail.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell with food, the body segments don't move; only the head moves, and a new segment is added at the tail position. So the tail cell remains occupied, and the new head is at the food cell.\n> \n> Then for the next move, when the snake moves, all segments shift.\n> \n> But at the moment of eating, positions: head at (5,1), body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), and tail at (5,4).\n> \n> So after eating at (5,1), new positions: head (5,1), then body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (5,4). Length 6.\n> \n> If no food, positions would be head at (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail at (6,4), since S4 moves to (6,4).\n> \n> But with food, tail stays at (5,4).\n> \n> Back to the move.\n> \n> For turn 13, I must move L to (5,1), eat the food there, since it's positive, value +1, snake grows to length 6.\n> \n> Now, after this move, head is at (5,1), direction was D, but I moved L, so new head direction is L? The head direction changes to the direction I moved, I assume.\n> \n> The state will update the head direction to the new movement direction.\n> \n> So after moving L, head direction is now L (left).\n> \n> Now, positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)] with head at (5,1).\n> \n> Food: (5,1) is eaten, so removed. (2,2) still there with life_span 10, but after turn 13, countdown decreases.\n> \n> At turn 13 start, food at (5,1) has life_span 2, so after turn 13, if not eaten, countdown becomes 1, but it is eaten, so it's gone.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) has life_span 10, after turn 13, countdown 9? At turn 13, life_span 10, so after this turn, it becomes 9 for the next turn.\n> \n> But since I need to think ahead, let's list the state after turn 13 move.\n> \n> After turn 13: head at (5,1), direction L (since I moved left).\n> \n> Body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (5,4).\n> \n> Food: only (2,2) with life_span 10, but after turn 13, it will have life_span 9 for turn 14? Let's clarify the life_span decrease.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 13, food has life_span L, after the turn (after actions), countdown decreases by 1.\n> \n> If countdown reaches 0, food disappears.\n> \n> For (5,1) at turn 13: life_span 2, so if not eaten, after turn 13, countdown 1, and if eaten, it's consumed.\n> \n> Since I ate it, it's gone.\n> \n> For (2,2): life_span 10 at turn 13, after turn 13, if not eaten, life_span becomes 9 for turn 14.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> First, for turn 13, I have to move to (5,1), no choice.\n> \n> Now, for turn 14, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R (right), which is opposite.\n> \n> Also, check collisions.\n> \n> Move U to (5,1+1) = (5,2): but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Walls include internal obstacle at (5,2), so moving to (5,2) causes wall collision, death.\n> \n> Move D to (5,1-1) = (5,0): y=0 wall, death.\n> \n> Move L to (5-1,1) = (4,1): is this free? Let's see.\n> \n> (4,1): not wall, not snake body? Snake positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). So (4,1) is not occupied, should be free.\n> \n> Move R to (6,1): but (6,1) is a body segment! Positions: (5,1) head, (6,1) is first body segment, so moving to (6,1) would be collision with body segment.\n> \n> Also, R is opposite to L? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (5,2) obstacle, invalid; D to (5,0) wall, invalid; R to (6,1) body and opposite, invalid; only L to (4,1) is possible.\n> \n> Is that right? U, D, R all invalid, only L possible.\n> \n> But L to (4,1) should be safe.\n> \n> No food there, I think. Food is only at (2,2), not at (4,1).\n> \n> So for turn 14, I must move L to (4,1).\n> \n> After that, head at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Body: since no food, snake doesn't grow. When moving without eating, the tail moves.\n> \n> After turn 14 move to (4,1) no food:\n> \n> New positions: head at (4,1), then body: previous head (5,1) becomes first body, so (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail: previous second last was (6,4)? Let's list old positions before move: head (5,1), B1 (6,1), B2 (6,2), B3 (6,3), B4 (6,4), tail (5,4)? Positions: index S0 (5,1) head, S1 (6,1), S2 (6,2), S3 (6,3), S4 (6,4), S5 (5,4) tail? After eating at turn 13, positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), tail (5,4). So 6 segments: S0 (5,1), S1 (6,1), S2 (6,2), S3 (6,3), S4 (6,4), S5 (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1) no food: new head at (4,1), then S0 moves to (4,1)? New head at new_pos, then S1 moves to old S0 position (5,1), S2 to old S1 (6,1), S3 to old S2 (6,2), S4 to old S3 (6,3), and S5 tail moves to old S4 position (6,4).\n> \n> Old S4 was (6,4), so tail moves to (6,4).\n> \n> New positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (6,4).\n> \n> S5 was tail at (5,4), but it moves to old S4 position, which is (6,4), so (5,4) is now empty.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> For turn 15, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - U to (4,1+1) = (4,2)\n> \n> - D to (4,1-1) = (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - L to (4-1,1) = (3,1)\n> \n> - R to (4+1,1) = (5,1) but (5,1) is now a body segment!

Not wall, not snake body. Snake body is at (5,1), (6,1), etc., (4,2) not occupied. So safe.\n> \n> - Move L to (3,1): similarly, (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> Both seem safe for now.\n> \n> But I need to go to (2,2), so moving U to (4,2) gets me closer in y, but same x, or moving L to (3,1) gets me closer in x, same y.\n> \n> (2,2) is left and up from (4,1).\n> \n> From (4,1), (2,2) is delta x=-2, delta y=+1.\n> \n> So moving U to (4,2) is better for y, then I need to go left.\n> \n> Moving L to (3,1) is better for x, then need to go up.\n> \n> But I also need to consider the body positions.\n> \n> After moving, the body will shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move U to (4,2) on turn 15:\n> \n> New head at (4,2), no food there, so snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,2), then body: old head (4,1) becomes body, so (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail moves to old S4 position?

It's turn 14. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Since it's turn 14, and life span decreases every turn including current, it will disappear after 9 more turns, so at turn 23. Life span 9 means it has 9 turns left including this one, so it disappears at the start of turn 15 + 9 = turn 24? Let's clarify: \"life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 14, life span is 9, so after this turn (turn 14), it decreases to 8, then 7, ..., down to 0, and disappears when it reaches 0. So it will be gone at the start of turn 14 + 9 = turn 23? No.\n> \n> If at turn 14, life span is 9, that means it has 9 turns left, including turn 14. After turn 14 is executed, life span becomes 8. After turn 15, 7, and so on, until after turn 22, it becomes 0, and then at the start of turn 23, it disappears. I think that's how it works. Let me confirm with the rules.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life span at that turn. And countdown decreases every turn, including current. So when we are at turn t with life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on. It disappears when life span reaches 0, which would be after L turns from now.\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, then after k turns (k from 0 to L-1), it's still there with life span L-k. After L turns, at turn t+L, it has life span 0 and disappears before that turn starts or something? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think that at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span L. After the turn is executed, life span decreases by 1. So after turn t, at the start of turn t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 14, life span 9. After turn 14 action, life span becomes 8. At start of turn 15, life span is 8, and so on. After turn 22 action, life span becomes 0, and it disappears before turn 23 starts. So it can be eaten up to and including turn 22.\n> \n> Similarly, for this food, at turn 14, life span 9, so it can be eaten on turns 14 to 22 inclusive.\n> \n> But in this case, only one food, at (2,2).\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,1), direction left. So last move was left to (5,1).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R. So I can move U, D, or L.

What's at (4,1)? Not a wall, not occupied by snake? Snake is at (5,1), (6,1), etc., not (4,1). Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (5,2), so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,1) – but (6,1) is occupied by the snake body, so collision if I go there.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are (5,1) head, then (6,1) is the first body segment. If I move right to (6,1), the head would be at (6,1), but (6,1) is currently occupied by the body, so when I move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment follows to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So if I move right to (6,1), which is currently the position of the first body segment. After move, head is at (6,1), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,1), second body segment moves to where first was, (6,1)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (5,1) head, index 1: (6,1), index 2: (6,2), index 3: (6,3), index 4: (6,4), index 5: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,1), new head position (6,1). Then, body segments: segment 1 (which was at (6,1)) moves to where head was, (5,1). Segment 2 (was at (6,2)) moves to where segment 1 was, (6,1). Segment 3 (was at (6,3)) moves to (6,2). Segment 4 (was at (6,4)) moves to (6,3). Segment 5 (tail at (5,4)) moves to (6,4).\n> \n> After move, positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (6,1)? (6,1) is now head, and segment 1 is at (5,1), segment 2 is at (6,1)? No: segment 2 moves to the previous position of segment 1, which was (6,1), but (6,1) is now the head position? This is messy.\n> \n> The new position for segment i is the old position of segment i-1.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then segment 1 (the one after head) moves to old position of head.\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1.\n> \n> And so on.\n> \n> In this case, if I move right to (6,1), which is the old position of segment 1.\n> \n> New head: (6,1)\n> \n> New segment 1: old position of head, which is (5,1)\n> \n> New segment 2: old position of segment 1, which is (6,1) — but (6,1) is where head is now? Collision?\n> \n> At the new head position, if it was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it causes collision because that body segment is still there until it moves.\n> \n> In snake games, when head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, (6,1) is the position of segment 1, which is not the tail. Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> If head moves to (6,1), it will be on the same cell as segment 1 before movement, so collision occurs immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, in the new configuration, after movement, head is at (6,1), and segment 2 is moving to (6,1) which is now occupied, but since it's simultaneous, it might be considered collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a body segment causes collision, except if it's the tail, and only if the tail moves away, meaning that after movement, the tail is no longer there.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,1): (6,1) is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail, so it should cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (5,0) is wall, up to (5,2) is obstacle, so only possible move is left to (4,1)?

Collision.\n> \n> The rule says: because the head and newly grown tail will collide. After eating, a new segment is added at the tail, so the old tail stays, and new tail is added, but head is on the same cell? Messy.\n> \n> Typically, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and since food is there, it's eaten, then the snake grows, so the tail does not move that turn; a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> But if the food is under the tail, and head moves to it, that means head moves to the tail position. Since tail is there, if it's not the only segment, but tail is a segment, so moving to a cell occupied by tail might be collision, except if it's the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, when you eat, the tail does not move, so if head moves to tail position, and tail is there, collision occurs.\n> \n> The rule specifies this danger only when head is adjacent and moves to the tail cell with food.\n> \n> In this situation, for (2,2), it's not under the tail; tail is at (6,4) after turn 14 move, far away.

So the snake is moving left, since head is at (4,1) and previous was (5,1), and direction is given as L.\n> - **Food**: Only one food item at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 8 turns, so at turn 23 (15 + 8 = 23).\n> \n> The snake head direction is L, meaning it's currently moving left. So from (4,1), it can move to adjacent cells: left to (3,1), up to (4,2), or down to (4,0), but down to (4,0) might be a wall since y=0 is border. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,0) is on y=0, which is a wall, so I can't move down. Similarly, moving right would be to (5,1), but that's the body segment, so collision. Let's list possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,1)\n> \n> Possible directions:\n> \n> - U (up): (4,2)\n> - D (down): (4,0) — but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> - L (left): (3,1) — this should be valid, as it's within bounds.\n> - R (right): (5,1) — but (5,1) is occupied by the second body segment, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n> \n> The rules say: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves. But in this case, (5,1) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,4). Snake positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)], so (5,1) is the second segment, which is part of the body. If head moves to (5,1), it collides with the body segment there, so death. Therefore, moving right is invalid.\n> \n> Also, moving down to (4,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving up to (4,2): let's check if that's valid. (4,2) is not a wall? Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (4,2) has x=4, y=2, not on border. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2). So (4,2) should be empty. Also, is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,2) is not in the list, so it's free.

It's turn 16, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,1), then body segments at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is moving left, since head direction is L, and positions show it going from (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1). Head is at (3,1), and it's moving left, so from (4,1) to (3,1), which is left.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so current movement is left.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Life span is given as the third number, so for (2,2) it's 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Let me check the rules.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,2), life span 7, on turn 16, it will disappear after turn 16 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, that means on the turn it spawns, countdown is N, then after that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears after the turn when countdown is 0.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: when food is present, it has a life span of N, meaning it will be there for N more turns, including the current one. So after N turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, if life span is 7 on turn 16, then on turn 17, life span is 6, ..., on turn 22, life span is 1, and after turn 22, it disappears, so not present on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2), life span 10 on turn 16, so it will last until turn 25 (16+10-1=25? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> Turn current is t, life span N.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown becomes N-1.\n> \n> After turn t+1, countdown becomes N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown becomes 0, and after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn t + N.\n> \n> So for (2,2), life span 7 on turn 16: present on turns 16,17,18,19,20,21,22; gone on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life span 10: present on turns 16 to 25; gone on turn 26.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value 1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,1), moving left. So possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible actions: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at borders, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Also obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake body: positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (2,2) and (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is directly above the head? Head is at (3,1), so (3,2) is up from head.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is left and up from head? Head (3,1), (2,2) is x-1, y+1, so not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (3,2) up, (3,0) down, but y=0 is wall, so down not possible? y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top.\n> \n> Coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but since walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake is at y=1,2,3, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Snake positions: (3,1), (4,1), etc., and (6,3), so y=1 is one above bottom, since y=0 is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,2) and (3,2), both y=2.\n> \n> So head at (3,1), which is x=3,y=1.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,1)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so down is invalid, collision with wall.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, (3,1) down to (3,0) is invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L to (2,1) or U to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, (3,2) has food! Food at (3,2), value 1, positive.\n> \n> If I move up to (3,2), I eat the food there.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, check for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,3). Is head adjacent to tail? Head (3,1), tail (6,3), distance: |dx|=3, |dy|=2, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y, diff 1, or diagonal? But movement is only orthogonal, so adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right cells.\n> \n> Head (3,1), adjacent cells: (3,2) up, (3,0) down (wall), (2,1) left, (4,1) right, but (4,1) is body, since snake body at (4,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,1) head, then (4,1), (5,1), etc. So (4,1) is the first body segment.\n> \n> So adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) - this has food\n> \n> - Down: (3,0) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left: (2,1) - empty? Let's see what's at (2,1). Not occupied by snake or wall, I think.\n> \n> Walls: only borders and (5,2). (2,1) is within bounds, x=2 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, and not (5,2), so free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,1) - occupied by snake body, so if I move there, collision with body, death.\n> \n> But I cannot move right anyway because current direction left, moving right would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible: U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (3,2), I eat the food at (3,2). Since it's positive, snake length increases by one.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so new head position at (3,2), and tail stays where it is? No, when snake eats, it grows, so the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added, so the tail remains in place for that turn, then next turn tail moves.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, head at (3,1), body at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,2), which has food, so head moves to (3,2), and since food eaten, a new segment is added. But where is the new segment added? After the head moves, the body follows, so the segment that was at head position becomes part of body.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new cell, if food, then snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; else, tail moves forward.\n> \n> So here: head moves to (3,2), eats food, so new positions: head at (3,2), then the previous head (3,1) becomes body, so body segments: (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and since grown, tail at (6,3) doesn't move, so new tail is still (6,3), but now it's part of a longer body.\n> \n> Positions: after move and eat: head (3,2), then segments: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So tail at (6,3), length increased by one.\n> \n> If no eat, tail would have moved, but here ate, so tail stays.\n> \n> Now, similarly, if move L to (2,1), no food there, so head to (2,1), body follows: (3,1) becomes body, tail at (6,3) moves to the previous position of the second last? When head moves, all body segments shift.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> So if move to (2,1) no food: head to (2,1), then body: (3,1) (which was head), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (6,3) is removed, so new positions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Tail at (6,2).\n> \n> (6,2) was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n> \n> But in this case, no food eaten.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,2) with life span 7, so it will be there for several turns.\n> \n> Current turn 16, food at (2,2) life 7, so present until turn 22.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) life 10, present until turn 25.\n> \n> If I move up to (3,2), I eat it now, which is good, but I need to consider future moves.\n> \n> After moving up, head at (3,2), direction up (since I moved up).\n> \n> Then possible moves from there.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid state.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 walls.

Food at (3,2) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Food list: only (2,2) left, with life span now? After turn 16, when I move, it's turn 16 action, so after action, turn increments? Or during?\n> \n> The action is for turn t1, so on turn t1, I perform action, then state updates.\n> \n> But food life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 16, before action, life span is as given.\n> \n> After action, turn becomes 17, and life span decreases.\n> \n> For thinking, I need to simulate.\n> \n> Also, for the action sequence, I need to output for turn 16, then 17, etc., up to 5+ turns ahead? The sequence should be for multiple turns, at least 5 actions.\n> \n> The answer format says: Action Sequence for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n> \n> And think 5+ turns ahead, meaning I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> But in the sequence, I need to specify actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, the conclusion should summarize the strategy.\n> \n> First, let's evaluate immediate options for turn 16.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (3,2) - eat food, grow to length 7.\n> \n> Then head at (3,2), direction U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse?

Snake positions: (3,2) head, (3,1), (4,1), etc. (3,3) not occupied.\n> \n> - Down: (3,1) - but (3,1) is body segment, so if move down, collision with body, death. Also, moving down would be reverse if direction is U, but direction is U after moving up, so moving down is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> - Left: (2,2) - has food! (2,2) is food.\n> \n> - Right: (4,2) - empty? Not wall, not snake. But (4,2) is free, but there's obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is ok.\n> \n> (5,2) is obstacle, so (4,2) is free.\n> \n> But moving right to (4,2).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,2) with direction U: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).

It's turn 17. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is Up, which means it's moving upwards. Last move was to (3,2) from (3,1), I assume, but since head direction is U, it came from below, so previous position was (3,1), and before that (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so let's see the positions: from (3,1) to (3,2), so it moved up to (3,2).\n> \n> Food: only one food given: (2,2) with value 1 and life span 6. So it's positive food at (2,2), which will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn, so it has 6 turns left starting from turn 17? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 17, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 22? Let's clarify: life span N, decreases each turn, so at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Better to think: at turn t, life span L means it has L turns left including turn t. So after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears before the next turn. So for food at (2,2) with life span 6 at turn 17: it will be there until turn 22, and disappear before turn 23. Turns: turn 17: life 6, turn 18: life 5, ..., turn 22: life 1, then after turn 22, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead.

If I move to a cell that is (6,3), it might be safe if the tail moves.\n> \n> But from (3,2), moving to (3,1) is not the tail; (3,1) is the second segment, not tail.\n> \n> The cells:\n> \n> - (3,1) is occupied by body, not tail. Tail is (6,3).\n> \n> - (3,3) is empty? Let's see grid.\n> \n> Available cells around head (3,2):\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) — what is there? From positions, y=3 has (6,3) snake body, but (3,3) is not listed, so empty.\n> \n> - Down: (3,1) — occupied by snake body (second segment)\n> \n> - Left: (2,2) — has food, but is it safe?\n> \n> - Right: (4,2) — but (4,2) is what? Positions: (4,1) is body, but (4,2) not listed, so empty? But there's obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> List all occupied: snake at (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Obstacle at (5,2). Food at (2,2).\n> \n> So around (3,2):\n> \n> - North (U): (3,3) — not occupied, not wall, not obstacle. Walls are borders, so y=3 is within 1-6, x=3, so (3,3) should be free.\n> \n> - South (D): (3,1) — occupied by snake body (3,1), which is not tail; tail is (6,3). So if I move there, it's a body collision, since the body segment is still there when head moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"head touches any body segment\" except when it's the tail and tail moves.\n> \n> But (3,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. When the snake moves, if head goes to (3,1), but at that moment, (3,1) is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, it doesn't move away immediately; the tail moves, but this segment is fixed relative to head movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So when head moves from (3,2) to new position, say (3,3), then the segment at (3,1) moves to (3,2), and so on, tail at (6,3) moves to (6,2) or something.\n> \n> But for collision: when you move the head to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment at that time, it collides, except if it's the tail cell and the tail will move away.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to the tail cell is safe because tail moves forward, leaving that cell empty.\n> \n> But for other body cells, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment (not tail), it will cause collision because that segment is still there when head arrives.\n> \n> In this case, moving down to (3,1): currently (3,1) has a body segment. After move, head would be at (3,1), but the body segment that was at (3,1) will move to the previous head position (3,2), I think. Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start, positions: head (3,2), seg1 (3,1), seg2 (4,1), etc.\n> \n> If I move head down to (3,1), but (3,1) is occupied by seg1, so as soon as head tries to move there, it collides with seg1.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" and \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (3,1) is not tail, so moving to (3,1) should cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (2,2): (2,2) has food, but is it safe? (2,2) is not occupied by body, so no immediate collision.\n> \n> Moving right to (4,2): (4,2) is empty, no issue.\n> \n> But (4,2) is adjacent to obstacle? No, obstacle at (5,2), but (4,2) is free.\n> \n> Moving up to (3,3): empty.\n> \n> Now, also, walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so all moves are within bounds except down to (3,1) is y=1, which is within, but occupied.\n> \n> (3,1) y=1 is not wall; walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is the bottom row, not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 playable.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,2) with head dir U:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3) — possible, empty\n> \n> - D: to (3,1) — occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (2,2) — has food, but empty cell, no body, so possible\n> \n> - R: to (4,2) — empty, possible\n> \n> Also, cannot move D because instant reverse? Head dir U, moving D is opposite, so cannot move down anyway due to no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> So effectively, possible actions: U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,2) which is left of head, so moving L would eat it immediately, if I choose to.\n> \n> But is it safe? Food is positive, value 1, so eating it increases length by 1.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Here, head is at (3,2), tail is at (6,3). Are they adjacent?\n> \n> (3,2) and (6,3): delta x=3, delta y=1, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right; not diagonal.\n> \n> So (3,2) to (6,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away or diagonal, not directly adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving left to (2,2) should be safe and I eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the food has life span 6, so I have time, but since it's close, I might eat it now.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and plan.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so length becomes 8.\n> \n> But let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, if I move left to (2,2) at turn 17:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,2), eats food, so new head (2,2), length increases to 8.\n> \n> Then body: the tail doesn't move? When head moves to new cell, and eats food, the body doesn't move, tail stays, so new positions: head (2,2), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so now 8 segments: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n> \n> Tail is still (6,3).\n> \n> Now head at (2,2), direction was to left, so now head dir L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: (2,3)\n> \n> - D: (2,1)\n> \n> - L: (1,2) but x=1, not wall?

When head moves to (3,3), the segment that was at (3,2) moves to where? Original positions: before move, positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> After head moves to (3,3), the body segments follow: the first body segment (3,1) moves to previous head position (3,2), then (4,1) moves to previous position of next, which was (4,1), but it moves to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> Standard: after head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,3), then body: seg1 moves to old head (3,2), seg2 moves to old seg1 (3,1), seg3 moves to old seg2 (4,1), seg4 moves to old seg3 (5,1), seg5 moves to old seg4 (6,1), seg6 (tail) moves to old seg5 (6,2).

Probably at the start of turn 24 or end of turn 23.\n> \n> But for eating, as long as head moves to it before it disappears.\n> \n> It can be eaten on any turn when countdown >0.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (2,2). Current head is at (3,3). So (2,2) is one step left and one step down from head, but since head is at (3,3), moving Left would go to (2,3), which is not the food. Food is at (2,2), so I need to get to (2,2).\n> \n> From (3,3), I can go Left to (2,3), then from there, I can go Down to (2,2), since Down from (2,3) to (2,2) should be possible.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple steps ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,2). Head is at (3,3), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (6,2) are not adjacent; distance is |3-6| + |3-2| = 3+1=4, not adjacent.\n> \n> Food is at (2,2), which is not under tail; tail is at (6,2), so no issue.\n> \n> But when I move, things change.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves to eat the food safely and avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,3), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake is like: from (3,3) down to (3,1), then right to (6,1), then up to (6,2). So tail at (6,2).\n> \n> Food at (2,2).\n> \n> I need to get to (2,2) to eat it.\n> \n> From head (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (3,4): free\n> \n> - Left to (2,3): free\n> \n> - Right to (4,3): free\n> \n> Down not possible.\n> \n> Now, if I go Left to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go:\n> \n> - Up to (2,4)\n> \n> - Down to (2,2)  <-- food here\n> \n> - Left to (1,3)\n> \n> - Right to (3,3) but (3,3) is now body? After moving to (2,3), the snake will have head at (2,3), and body: previous head (3,3) becomes body, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) moves? When head moves, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten.\n> \n> If I don't eat food, tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,3), I don't eat food, so snake grows? No, only if I eat food, length increases; otherwise, when I move, head to new position, and tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, head goes to new cell, if that cell has food, you eat it, length increases by one, so tail doesn't move. If no food, tail moves, length same.\n> \n> Here: \"Positive Food: Length of snake +1\", \"Negative Food: Length unchanged\", so for positive, if eaten, length increases, tail stays; if not eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> In the move: when head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If food, eat it, add new head, body extends, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> - If no food, add new head, remove tail.\n> \n> In this state, food at (2,2), not at (2,3) or others.\n> \n> So from (3,3), if I go to (2,3), no food there, so head to (2,3), body: (3,3) becomes new segment, then (3,2), etc., and tail (6,2) is removed? Positions: after move, snake: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). (6,2) is gone, since no food eaten, tail moves forward. The segment at (6,1) was there, now it's the second last, and (6,2) is removed.\n> \n> Initial positions: indices: head:0 (3,3), 1:(3,2), 2:(3,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(6,1), 6:(6,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3), no food eaten, so new head at (2,3), and remove tail, so body: (3,3) becomes segment 1, (3,2) seg2, (3,1) seg3, (4,1) seg4, (5,1) seg5, (6,1) seg6, and (6,2) removed. So tail is now (6,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat food, length increases, tail not removed.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> I want to eat the food at (2,2). From (3,3), I can go Left to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go Down to (2,2) to eat it.\n> \n> But is that safe? Let's see the positions after each move.\n> \n> Turn 18: move from (3,3) to (2,3)\n> \n> After move: head (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail was (6,2), removed\n> \n> Tail is (6,1) now.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,3), direction from (3,3) to (2,3) is Left, so head direction now L.\n> \n> Turn 19: from (2,3), I can move Down to (2,2) to eat food.\n> \n> Move Down: to (2,2), which has food, so eat it, length increases by one, so tail not removed.\n> \n> After eating: head (2,2), and body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // since ate food, (6,1) remains as tail? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the snake grows.\n> \n> Positions: before move, snake: [ (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] with head at (2,3)\n> \n> Move head to (2,2), which has food, so add new head at (2,2), and since food eaten, the body extends, so the tail stays, and we add a new segment. But the tail is at (6,1), so it doesn't move; the new position is head at (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes segment 1, (3,3) seg2, ..., up to (6,1) as tail. Length increased by one.\n> \n> So after eating: positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // 8 segments, tail at (6,1)\n> \n> But (6,1) was already there, now it's the tail.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? When I move to (2,2), I need to check if I collide.\n> \n> (2,2) is free, not wall, not snake body except possibly, but before move, (2,2) is not occupied, since food is there, and snake positions are as above.\n> \n> After move, head at (2,2), which was food, now eaten.\n> \n> But there's a special rule: food can be under body, but only eaten if head moves to it after body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, food at (2,2), is it under snake body?\n> \n> Current positions: before any move, on turn 18, snake has (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). (2,2) is not in this list, so it's not under body, it's free. So moving to it should be fine.\n> \n> But after moving to (2,3) first, then to (2,2), it should be ok.\n> \n> However, I need to think about future moves and risks.\n> \n> Also, the food life span is 5, so I have until turn 22 to eat it, since on turn 23 it disappears? Countdown from 5 on turn 18: turn 18:5, 19:4, 20:3, 21:2, 22:1, turn 23:0, disappears, so must eat by turn 22.\n> \n> Turn 22 countdown=1, still there, can eat on turn 22.\n> \n> But I can eat it earlier.\n> \n> Now, in this plan, on turn 19 I eat it.\n> \n> But let's see if I can eat it directly or other ways.\n> \n> From (3,3), I can't go directly to (2,2) because it's diagonal, not adjacent; moves are only orthogonal, so I need two moves: left then down, or down then left, but down is not possible from current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so I can't go D.\n> \n> So only via (2,3) or other paths.\n> \n> Another way: go Down, but can't, instant reverse.\n> \n> Or go Right to (4,3), then down or something, but that might be longer to reach (2,2).\n> \n> Not efficient.\n> \n> So left then down seems direct.\n> \n> But after eating at (2,2), head is at (2,2), and body is long.\n> \n> Now, I need to think beyond eating the food.\n> \n> The goal is to survive and maximize score, so after eating, I need to avoid collisions and find more food, but there's only one food now, and it might spawn more, but in this state, only one food is given, so I assume no other food for now.\n> \n> I should plan for the next 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, check for dangers.\n> \n> First, after eating at (2,2) on turn 19, positions: head (2,2), body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> Head direction: from (2,3) to (2,2) is Down, so now head direction D.\n> \n> From here, possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is possible? Head direction now D, so I can move U, L, R, not D? Instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (since moved down to (2,2)), so next turn, I cannot move Up, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - Up to (2,3): but (2,3) is now body segment, since it's the first body part.

Current direction is D, moving Down would be same direction? Directions: moving Down from (2,2) to (2,1) is Down, same as current? Current direction is the direction I just moved to get here, which is Down.\n> \n> When I move to a cell, the head direction is set to that direction.\n> \n> So after moving to (2,2) with direction Down, for the next move, I can move Down (same), Left, or Right, but not Up (opposite).\n> \n> Moving Up to (2,3) is occupied, so deadly.\n> \n> Moving Down to (2,1): is it free?

It's turn 19. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then body segments at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).

Since life span decreases every turn including current, after turn 19, it will have 3 turns left, then 2, then 1, then disappear after turn 22 or something. Let's calculate: life span 4 at turn 19, so it disappears after turn 22? Life span decreases each turn, starting from turn 19. So:\n> \n> - Turn 19: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 20: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 21: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 22: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 23: life span 0, so it disappears before turn 23 or after turn 22? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 19, life span is 4, meaning it has 4 turns including this one before it vanishes. After turn 19, life span becomes 3, and so on. So it can be eaten from turn 19 to turn 22, and vanishes after turn 22, so not available on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 10. Since life span is 10, it will last until turn 28 or so.\n> \n> Value is 1 for both, so positive food, but I need to check if they are safe to eat.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,1) is actually under the snake's body. Snake positions include (4,1), which is the 5th segment? Let's list snake positions with indices:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (2,3)\n> \n> 1: (3,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,2)\n> \n> 3: (3,1)\n> \n> 4: (4,1)\n> \n> 5: (5,1)\n> \n> 6: (6,1) tail\n> \n> So (4,1) is position index 4, which is a body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is under the body. But according to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Since (4,1) is occupied by the snake, the head can't move there until that segment moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,2) is not under the snake; it's at (2,2), which is adjacent to head (2,3) directly below? (2,3) to (2,2) is down, but y increases up? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (2,3), which is x=2, y=3.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is at x=2, y=2, which is directly below head? Since y decreases down, so from (2,3) to (2,2) is down (D).\n> \n> But is (2,2) occupied? Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc. (2,2) is not in snake positions, so it's free for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is in snake positions, index 4, so occupied.\n> \n> Head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to (2,3) from (3,3).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (2,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,2) — but there's food at (2,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,3) — but (3,3) is the next segment, so moving right would cause collision, since it's the body.\n> \n> Movement constraints: head cannot move into a cell occupied by body, except the tail if it moves away, but in this case, (3,3) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1). So moving to (3,3) would be collision with body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: x=0 is wall, so moving left to (1,3) is possible? x=1 to x=6 is playable, since walls at x=0 and x=7. x=0 is wall, so x=1 is valid. Similarly y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,4): check if wall or body. (2,4) is within bounds: x=2 (1-6), y=4 (1-6). Not a wall, and not in snake positions? Snake: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (2,4) is free. So U is possible.\n> \n> - D to (2,2): (2,2) is within bounds, not wall, and food is there, but we need to see if it's safe. Also, is it occupied? Snake positions don't have (2,2), so it's free. But moving D would go to food cell.\n> \n> - L to (1,3): (1,3) is within bounds, not wall, not in snake positions, so possible.\n> \n> - R to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by the first body segment (index 1), so collision, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since head direction is L, moving right (R) would be opposite, but R is not possible anyway because of body.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R, which is not allowed next turn? The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So since I just moved left to get here, I cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> But right is invalid anyway, so only U, D, L possible.\n> \n> Now, U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (2,2). It has life span 4, so it can be eaten in the next few turns. Value +1.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,2), I eat the food, snake grows to 8 segments. New head at (2,2), and tail stays, so new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the segment that was tail (6,1) might move? When snake eats, it grows, so tail doesn't move that turn. Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: [ (2,2) , (2,3) , (3,3) , (3,2) , (3,1) , (4,1) , (5,1) , (6,1) ] so 8 segments, tail at (6,1).\n> \n> But is this safe? After moving to (2,2), the head is at (2,2), and the body includes (2,3) above it, but since it just moved down, no immediate collision. But I need to check future moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But here, tail is at (6,1), far away, not adjacent to head at (2,2). Adjacent means neighboring cells, so (2,2) and (6,1) are not adjacent; distance is large. So no issue.\n> \n> But let's see the position: after eating, head at (2,2), with body above at (2,3), and so on.\n> \n> Now, possible next moves from there.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns.\n> \n> The other food at (4,1) is under the body, at position (4,1), which is currently occupied by the snake. To eat it, the snake must move so that (4,1) becomes free, and then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,1) is segment 4. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if no food eaten, tail moves from (6,1) to... depends on direction.\n> \n> I should simulate possible sequences.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible actions for turn 19.\n> \n> Options: U, D, or L.\n> \n> D goes directly to food at (2,2), eats it, grows to 8.\n> \n> U goes to (2,4), no food.\n> \n> L goes to (1,3), no food.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,2) has only 4 life span, so it might disappear soon if not eaten.\n> \n> Life span 4 at turn 19, so after turn 19, if not eaten, life span 3 at turn 20, and so on. So it can be eaten until turn 22.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (4,1) is under body, so need to free it.\n> \n> Now, to free (4,1), since it's a body segment, the snake needs to move in a way that this segment is no longer occupied, meaning the tail moves away or something.\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) will move when the snake moves without eating, but since it's not the tail, it depends on the movement.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake's body movement.\n> \n> Current positions: let's label them:\n> \n> Head: S0 = (2,3)\n> \n> S1 = (3,3)\n> \n> S2 = (3,2)\n> \n> S3 = (3,1)\n> \n> S4 = (4,1)\n> \n> S5 = (5,1)\n> \n> S6 = tail = (6,1)\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a new cell, S0 moves to new cell, S1 moves to old S0, S2 to old S1, ..., S6 moves to old S5, and old S6 is vacated.\n> \n> If head moves to food, then S0 to food, S1 to old S0, ..., S6 stays, so new segment added at head, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> To free a cell that has a body segment, like (4,1), which is S4, it will be freed only if the snake moves and S4 moves to a new position, which happens when the snake moves without eating, and specifically, S4 will move to where S3 was, but S3 is at (3,1), which is different.\n> \n> Perhaps I should think of the snake as a sequence.\n> \n> After one move without eating, the new positions: head moves to new cell, say P, then body: [P, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5] so S6 is gone, and S5 is new tail.\n> \n> Original: [S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6]\n> \n> After move to P (no food): [P, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5]  so S6 removed, new tail S5.\n> \n> The cell that was S6 is free now.\n> \n> But for S4, which was at (4,1), it moves to S3's position, which is (3,1), so (4,1) is vacated only if no new segment is added there, but in this case, S4 moves to (3,1), so (4,1) is left empty.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body segment, when the snake moves without eating, all segments shift, so each body cell except the tail's position is vacated, but the tail position is vacated, and new head position occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell that was occupied by S6 (tail) is vacated, and S4 moves to S3's position, so the cell that was S4 is vacated only if S4 was not the tail, which it isn't.\n> \n> In general, when moving without eating, all cells except the tail position are reoccupied by the next segment, so only the tail position is freed. The other body positions are still occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For example, start: positions: S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6\n> \n> After move to P (no eat): positions: P (new head), S0 (now body), S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 (new tail)\n> \n> So the cells: old S0 is now occupied by S0 but it's the new position for body, old S1 occupied by S1, ..., old S5 occupied by S5, old S6 is free.\n> \n> Only the tail cell is freed; other body cells are still occupied but by the preceding segment.\n> \n> For a specific cell like (4,1), which is occupied by S4, after a move without eating, S4 moves to where S3 was, so (4,1) is no longer occupied by snake, because S4 moves to (3,1), and S5 moves to (4,1)? No.\n> \n> S4 was at (4,1), S3 at (3,1), S5 at (5,1), S6 at (6,1).\n> \n> After move to P (no eat): new head at P, then S0 at old S0 position, but S0 is now the segment after head, so positions: [P, old S0, old S1, old S2, old S3, old S4, old S5]\n> \n> So old positions: old S0 (2,3) is now occupied by the new body segment that was S0.\n> \n> old S1 (3,3) is now occupied by new S1, which was old S2? Let's index the segments.\n> \n> After move: new segment 0 at P\n> \n> Segment 1 at old segment 0 position\n> \n> Segment 2 at old segment 1 position\n> \n> Segment 3 at old segment 2 position\n> \n> Segment 4 at old segment 3 position\n> \n> Segment 5 at old segment 4 position\n> \n> Segment 6 at old segment 5 position (new tail)\n> \n> And old segment 6 position is free.\n> \n> So for a cell that was occupied by segment K, after move, it is occupied by segment K+1 if K<6, or free if K=6.\n> \n> Specifically, for K=4, (4,1) was segment 4, after move, it will be occupied by segment 5, which was old S5 at (5,1).\n> \n> So (4,1) is still occupied unless segment 4 was the tail, which it isn't.\n> \n> The only cell that becomes free is the old tail position, (6,1) in this case.\n> \n> For (4,1) to be free, it needs to be the tail position at some point, so that when snake moves, it vacates.\n> \n> Currently, (4,1) is segment 4, not tail. Tail is segment 6 at (6,1).\n> \n> To make (4,1) the tail, the snake needs to grow or move in a way that segments before it are removed, but since it's a body segment, the only way to free it is for the tail to move past it or something, but the tail only moves when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves away, but since segments move sequentially, it will be occupied as long as that part of the body is there.\n> \n> To free a specific body cell, the snake must move so that that cell is no longer part of the body, which happens when the tail moves away from it, but since the tail is at the end, it only affects the last cell.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,1) will be freed only if the snake shortens or moves in a way that the segment at (4,1) is the tail and then moves.\n> \n> But currently, segment at (4,1) is not tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> So to make it the tail, the snake needs to lose segments after it or something, but we can't lose segments; only when eating negative food, but there's no negative food here.\n> \n> With positive food, snake grows, so tail moves less.\n> \n> The only way to free a body-occupied cell is for the snake to move without eating for several turns, so that the tail moves, and eventually the segment that was at (4,1) might become the tail if the snake doesn't grow, but since it's segment 4, and there are 7 segments, after 3 moves without eating, segment 4 would be the new tail? Let's see.\n> \n> After one move no eat: segments 0 to 5, tail at old S5 position.\n> \n> After two moves no eat: segments 0 to 4, tail at old S4 position.\n> \n> After three moves no eat: segments 0 to 3, tail at old S3 position.\n> \n> So after K moves without eating, the tail is at the position of old segment (7-K) for a snake of length L=7.\n> \n> After 0 moves: tail at S6\n> \n> After 1 move no eat: tail at S5\n> \n> After 2 moves no eat: tail at S4\n> \n> After 3 moves no eat: tail at S3\n> \n> S3 is at (3,1), so after 3 moves without eating, the tail will be at (3,1), and (4,1) would have been freed earlier? After 2 moves no eat, tail at S4 position, which is (4,1), so at that point, (4,1) is the tail cell.\n> \n> Then when the snake moves again without eating, (4,1) is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - After 0 moves: positions include S4 at (4,1)\n> \n> - After 1 move no eat: new positions, tail at S5 which is (5,1), and S4 is at old S3 (3,1), so (4,1) is now occupied by S5? From above:\n> \n> After 1 move no eat to P: new positions: P, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5  so S4 is at old S3 (3,1), S5 at old S4 (4,1), so (4,1) is occupied by S5.\n> \n> (4,1) is still occupied, by the new segment 5.\n> \n> After 2 moves no eat: from there, move to Q no eat, new positions: Q, P, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4  so S4 is at old S3 position, which was (3,1), but S3 was at (3,1) before, now S4 is at that position, but the cell (4,1) is now occupied by S3? Let's track.\n> \n> After first move: positions: [P, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5] with S5 at old S4 position (4,1)\n> \n> After second move to Q no eat: new positions: [Q, P, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4]  so S4 is at old S3 position, S3 at old S2 position, etc.\n> \n> The cell that was (4,1) after first move is now occupied by S4 in the new body, but in the new list, segment 6 is S4 at position of old S3.\n> \n> The position (4,1) is now occupied by the new segment that was S4 in the previous state, but in the new state, it's the position of segment 5 or something. It's messy.\n> \n> The key point is that the cell (4,1) will be occupied until the segment that was there is no longer part of the snake, which happens when it becomes the tail and then the tail moves.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (4,1) is the 4th segment. After 2 moves without eating, it will be the 6th segment (tail), because the snake shortens by one each move no eat.\n> \n> After 2 moves no eat, length is 7, but tail is the segment that was S4 initially.\n> \n> Initially, segments: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n> \n> After 1 move no eat: segments: new0, 0,1,2,3,4,5  so tail is 5, which was initial S5.\n> \n> After 2 moves no eat: segments: new0, new1, 0,1,2,3,4  so tail is 4, which was initial S4.\n> \n> So after 2 moves without eating, the tail is at the position where initial S4 was, which is (4,1).\n> \n> Then, when the snake moves again without eating, the tail moves from (4,1), so (4,1) is vacated.\n> \n> So to free the food at (4,1), we need to have the snake move without eating for 3 turns: after 2 moves, tail is at (4,1), and on the third move, if we don't eat, tail moves away, freeing (4,1).\n> \n> Then, head can move to (4,1) to eat it, but only if it's free and head moves there.\n> \n> But during these moves, we need to avoid eating other food or dying.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,1) has life span 10, so it has time.\n> \n> But the food at (2,2) has only life span 4, so it will disappear soon.\n> \n> If I don't eat (2,2) soon, it might be lost.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving D to eat (2,2) now on turn 19.\n> \n> Turn 19: move D to (2,2), eat food, snake grows to 8 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  so tail at (6,1).\n> \n> Head direction now D (since moved down).\n> \n> Food at (2,2) is eaten, so removed. Food at (4,1) still there, under body, but now (4,1) is occupied by the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (2,2), 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1) tail. So (4,1) is segment 5, still body.\n> \n> Life span of food at (4,1) is 10 at turn 19, so after turn 19, when we eat, it's turn 19, so food life span decreases after the turn? The rule: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 19, life span 10, after turn 19, it becomes 9 for turn 20, etc.\n> \n> But we are at turn 19, so if we don't eat it now, life span decreases after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,2), life span 4 at turn 19.\n> \n> After eating (2,2), we have food at (4,1) to consider.\n> \n> From new head at (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (2,3) — but (2,3) is now the first body segment, so collision, cannot move there.\n> \n> D to (2,1) — (2,1) is within bounds, y=1 not wall, x=2.

It's turn 20. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is down (D), meaning it's moving downwards.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9. But (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (2,2) head, (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (4,1) is the sixth segment, which is part of the body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (4,1), since it's under the snake now, the snake needs to move so that this cell becomes free, and then later the head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Life span is 9, meaning it will disappear after 9 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 20, it will disappear after turn 28? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 20, life span is 9, so it will be there for turns 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28? Let's see: after turn 20, life span becomes 8; turn 21, 7; ... down to turn 28, life span 1, then after turn 28, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to and including turn 28. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if life span is 9 at turn 20, it will be present for 9 turns: turns 20 to 28 inclusive? Turn 20: life span 9, after turn 20, it decreases to 8; turn 21: 7; ... turn 27: 1; turn 28: 0? But it disappears after N turns, meaning after the turn where life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Typically, life span decreases at the end of the turn or during the turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". And \"disappears after N turns\". So at turn t, with life span L, after that turn, L becomes L-1. When L reaches 0, it disappears, so it can be eaten on the turn when L >=1.\n> \n> For food at (4,1) at turn 20, life span 9. After turn 20, life span 8; after turn 21, 7; ... after turn 28, life span becomes 0, so it disappears after turn 28. Therefore, it can be eaten from turn 20 to turn 28 inclusive.\n> \n> But currently, at turn 20, (4,1) is occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now. The head is at (2,2), which is not adjacent to (4,1) directly.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. I should consider possible moves and their consequences.\n> \n> First, current head position: (2,2), direction down. So from (2,2), possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse? Instant reverse means opposite direction. Current direction down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn. Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> But I have to consider walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So for head at (2,2):\n> \n> - Move down (D): to (2,1). Is (2,1) valid? y=1 is not y=0, so not wall. Also, is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). (2,1) is not in the list, so empty. But (3,1) is occupied, but (2,1) is different cell. So moving to (2,1) should be safe, no collision.\n> \n> - Move left (L): to (1,2). x=1, not wall, and not occupied? Positions: (2,2), (2,3), etc., no (1,2), so empty. Safe.\n> \n> - Move right (R): to (3,2). But (3,2) is occupied by snake body; it's the fourth segment. So moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body. Not safe.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 20: D or L. R is invalid because (3,2) is body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (4,1). I want to eat it if possible, but it's currently under the body. So I need to move the snake in such a way that (4,1) becomes free, and then head can go there.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (6,1). When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if I move, the tail will move away from (6,1), but (4,1) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> Let's list the snake segments with indices:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,2)\n> \n> Index 1: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,1)  <-- food is here\n> \n> Index 6: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 7: tail (6,1)\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail segment is removed, but since we eat food, length increases, but currently no food eaten, so on move, head moves, tail is removed, so the segment at (6,1) will be removed, and the new tail will be (5,1), but only if no food is eaten. If food is eaten, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 20, if I move without eating food, the snake will move: head to new position, tail removed.\n> \n> So after move, the body segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (2,1), new head is (2,1), then the body becomes: previous head (2,2) becomes segment 1, (2,3) becomes segment 2, (3,3) segment 3, (3,2) segment 4, (3,1) segment 5, (4,1) segment 6, (5,1) segment 7, and tail (6,1) is removed. So the food at (4,1) is now at segment 6 position, still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (1,2), new head (1,2), body: (2,2) seg1, (2,3) seg2, (3,3) seg3, (3,2) seg4, (3,1) seg5, (4,1) seg6, (5,1) seg7, tail (6,1) removed.\n> \n> So in both cases, (4,1) is still occupied by the snake, now segment 6.\n> \n> To free (4,1), I need the snake to move such that when the tail moves, (4,1) is no longer occupied. But (4,1) is not the tail; the tail is (6,1). So I need to move multiple times so that the tail moves past (4,1).\n> \n> The snake has to move in a way that the segment at (4,1) is vacated.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment when the head moves.\n> \n> So for (4,1) to be free, it must be that when the head moves, the tail moves away, and the segment that was at (4,1) moves to a new position, but it's a chain reaction.\n> \n> After one move, as above, (4,1) is still occupied by the body, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move, the segment that was at (4,1) is now at the position of the next segment, but since the head moved, all segments shift.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions after a move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P7\n> \n> After moving head to new position H, the new positions are: H, P0, P1, P2, ..., P6. Because the tail P7 is removed.\n> \n> So the cell that was P7 is now free, but other cells may still be occupied.\n> \n> For cell (4,1), which is currently P5 (index 5).\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, the new positions are H, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. So P5 (which was (4,1)) is now occupied by the segment that was P6, but in the new list, P5 old is not directly there; the new P6 is the old P5.\n> \n> Old positions: P0=(2,2), P1=(2,3), P2=(3,3), P3=(3,2), P4=(3,1), P5=(4,1), P6=(5,1), P7=(6,1)\n> \n> After move to (2,1): new P0 = (2,1), P1 = old P0 = (2,2), P2 = old P1 = (2,3), P3 = old P2 = (3,3), P4 = old P3 = (3,2), P5 = old P4 = (3,1), P6 = old P5 = (4,1), P7 = old P6 = (5,1)  // old P7 removed\n> \n> So (4,1) is now occupied by new P6, which is old P5, so still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, after another move, it might shift again.\n> \n> (4,1) will be occupied until the segment that is currently at (4,1) is no longer part of the snake or moves away.\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is fixed; it's the body part. When the snake moves, that segment moves to a new position.\n> \n> To free (4,1), I need that after some moves, no segment is at (4,1).\n> \n> That happens when the tail has moved past it, but since the tail is at (6,1), and (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, I need the snake to move so that the body leaves (4,1).\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at (4,1) will move to where the next segment is when the head moves.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves down to (2,1), then as above, the segment that was at (4,1) is now at (3,1) in the new positions (new P5 = old P4 = (3,1)? From above: after move, new P6 = old P5 = (4,1), so the segment that was at (4,1) is now at (4,1) still? No.\n> \n> Old P5 is at (4,1). After move, new P6 = old P5, so the segment that was at old P5 is now at new P6, which is (4,1), so it didn't move; the position is still occupied by the same segment?

No: old P5 was at (4,1), and new P6 is at (4,1), but new P6 is old P5, so yes, it is still at (4,1). How?\n> \n> Old P5 = (4,1)\n> \n> After move, new P6 = old P5 = (4,1)\n> \n> So the segment is still at (4,1), so the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> But when does it move? Only when the segment before it moves, but in this case, since the head moved down, the body didn't change position for that segment.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think of the snake as a chain. When the head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was.\n> \n> So for segment i, it moves to the position that segment i-1 was at before the move.\n> \n> In this case, for segment at index 5, (4,1), it will move to where index 4 was, which is (3,1).\n> \n> In the move, when head moves from (2,2) to (2,1), the new head is (2,1).\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to where head was, (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was, (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to where segment 4 was, (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 7 moves to where segment 6 was, (5,1)\n> \n> And tail (6,1) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (4,1) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at (5,1), which is now at (4,1) because it moved to where segment 5 was.\n> \n> But the cell (4,1) is still occupied, just by a different segment.\n> \n> To free the cell (4,1), I need that no segment is assigned to that cell after the move.\n> \n> That happens only if the segment that was at (4,1) moves to a different cell, and no other segment moves to it, which means that in the move, the position (4,1) is not the target for any segment.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the body shifts and (4,1) is not occupied.\n> \n> In this case, since the snake is moving, (4,1) will be occupied until the tail passes it or something.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be free when the segment that is currently at (4,1) has moved away, and no other segment moves to it, but since the snake is connected, it might be occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> The only way to free a cell is when the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (6,1). If I move the snake such that the tail moves, after a move, the old tail position is free.\n> \n> For (4,1), it is not the tail, so to free it, I need the snake to move so that the segment at (4,1) becomes the tail or something.\n> \n> Let's calculate how many moves until (4,1) is free.\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is index 5.

It's turn 21, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No, let's see: border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning that these are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, I assume. But there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake has 8 segments. Head is at (1,2), and current direction is L, which is left. Since it's moving left, from (1,2), possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, reverse would be R, so I cannot move right on this turn. Allowed moves: U (up), D (down), L (left). Not R.\n> \n> Now, food: only one food item at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 8. But life span is given as 8, and it says \"life_span decreases every turn including current\", so at turn 21, life span is 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 more turns, so at turn 29? Let's see: \"life_span decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life_span is N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's there for turns t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N. For example, if at turn t, life_span N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until N=0, then it disappears. So at turn 21, life_span 8, so it will be there until turn 28, and disappear at turn 29? No:\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So at the start of turn t, if life_span is N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if at turn t, life_span is N, then:\n> \n> - During turn t, the food is present.\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes N-1.\n> \n> - If after some turn, life_span becomes 0, then after that turn, the food disappears, so it's not available for the next turn.\n> \n> So for turn 21, life_span=8, so:\n> \n> - Turn 21: available, after turn, life_span=7\n> \n> - Turn 22: available, after turn, life_span=6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 28: available, after turn, life_span=0\n> \n> - Then at turn 29, it disappears, so not available.\n> \n> So food at (4,1) is available from turn 21 to turn 28 inclusive.\n> \n> But now, look at snake positions: the head is at (1,2), and food is at (4,1). Also, snake body includes (4,1) and (5,1). Snake positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> So segment 7 is (4,1), which is exactly where the food is. And segment 8 is (5,1).\n> \n> Now, the food is at (4,1), but it's under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, I need to plan for 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,2)\n> \n> Current direction: L (left)\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,2): U (up to (1,3)), D (down to (1,1)), L (left to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, so invalid), R (right to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision? Wait no, movement constraints.\n> \n> Movement: I can choose U, D, L, R, but:\n> \n> - L: to (0,2), x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (2,2), which is a body segment. But according to collisions: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves, so if I move to the current tail position, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, but moving to a body segment that is not the tail is collision.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: indices: head (0): (1,2), then (1): (2,2), (2): (2,3), (3): (3,3), (4): (3,2), (5): (3,1), (6): (4,1), (7): (5,1) — tail.\n> \n> So tail is (5,1).\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), which is segment (1), not the tail, so it would be a collision, since the body segment is still there when head moves.\n> \n> But when I move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed or something. Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But at the moment of movement, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail cell and the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for other body segments, it's collision.\n> \n> In this case, (2,2) is segment (1), which is not tail, so moving to (2,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (1,1): is that within bounds? y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is valid, but is it occupied? Snake positions don't have (1,1), so it should be empty.\n> \n> Moving up to (1,3): is (1,3) occupied? Snake positions: (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc. (1,3) is not listed, so empty.\n> \n> (2,3) is segment, but (1,3) is different.\n> \n> Coordinates: (1,3) is not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> But let's list all cells:\n> \n> - (1,2): head\n> \n> - (2,2): body\n> \n> - (2,3): body\n> \n> - (3,3): body\n> \n> - (3,2): body\n> \n> - (3,1): body\n> \n> - (4,1): body\n> \n> - (5,1): tail\n> \n> Food at (4,1), which is a body segment.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,2):\n> \n> - U: to (1,3) — no wall, not body?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game at Turn 22:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (i.e., the outermost rows and columns are walls).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is also a wall.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)].\n     - Head: (1,1)\n     - Tail: (4,1)\n   - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (4,1): value = +1, life_span = 7 (will disappear after Turn 28).\n   - Food at (4,4): value = +1, life_span = 10 (will disappear after Turn 31).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 22\n\nFrom the head position (1,1), let's examine possible moves based on the current direction (D) and movement constraints:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1,2) \n  - Occupied by the snake's body (second segment). Moving here would cause a collision.\n- **Down (D)**: (1,0)\n  - y=0 is a wall. Invalid move.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,1)\n  - x=0 is a wall. Invalid move.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,1)\n  - Check if (2,1) is free:\n    - Not a wall (x=2 is not 0 or 7; y=1 is not 0 or 7; not (5,2)).\n    - Not occupied by the snake's body (snake segments are at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), etc., but not (2,1)).\n  - Valid move.\n\n**Current Direction Constraint**: The snake cannot reverse its direction instantly. Current direction is D, so the opposite is U, which is already invalid due to collision. Thus, no additional restriction beyond the invalid moves above.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 22**: The only valid move is **Right (R)** to (2,1).\n\n### Verifying the Move to (2,1)\n\nAfter moving to (2,1):\n\n- New head position: (2,1)\n- The previous head (1,1) becomes the first body segment.\n- The tail (4,1) moves away since no food is eaten (food at (4,1) is under the tail and cannot be eaten yet).\n- New snake positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n  - Tail is now at (3,1).\n- New head direction: Right (R), since we moved right.\n\n### Next Moves Planning\n\nLooking ahead to ensure we can eat the positive foods safely:\n\n1. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Currently under the tail at (4,1).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away first (which it does when the snake moves without eating).\n     - Then, the head can move to (4,1) to eat the food.\n   - Life_span: 7 at Turn 22 → disappears after Turn 28 (exists until Turn 28 inclusive).\n\n2. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Life_span: 10 at Turn 22 → disappears after Turn 31.\n   - More time available to reach it.\n\n**Proposed Sequence**:\n\n- **Turn 22**: Move R to (2,1) (only option).\n- **Turn 23**: From (2,1), possible moves:\n  - U: (2,2) - body segment (from previous positions), collision.\n  - D: (2,0) - wall.\n  - L: (1,1) - body segment, collision.\n  - R: (3,1) - tail. Moving into the tail is allowed if no food is eaten there (which is the case here).\n    - After moving to (3,1), tail moves away from (3,1), new tail is (3,2).\n- **Turn 24**: From (3,1), possible moves:\n  - U: (3,2) - tail (allowed).\n  - D: (3,0) - wall.\n  - L: (2,1) - body, collision.\n  - R: (4,1) - food is here now (tail moved away at Turn 23).\n    - Moving to (4,1) eats the food (+1 score), snake grows by 1 (tail doesn't move).\n- **Turn 25**: From (4,1), direction R, possible moves:\n  - U: (4,2) - free.\n  - D: (4,0) - wall.\n  - L: (3,1) - body, collision.\n  - R: (5,1) - free (not wall or body).\n    - Prefer moving U to start heading towards (4,4).\n- **Turn 26**: From (4,2), move U to (4,3).\n- **Turn 27**: From (4,3), move U to (4,4) to eat the second food.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- Eating (4,1) before it disappears (by Turn 28).\n- Then moving upwards to eat (4,4) before it disappears (by Turn 31).\n- Avoids collisions and follows movement rules.\n\n### Potential Risks and Mitigations\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: When eating food under the tail, ensure the head is not adjacent to the tail after growing to avoid collision. In our sequence, when eating at (4,1), the tail is at (3,1), and the head moves to (4,1), which is not adjacent (diagonally adjacent doesn't count as adjacent in this context; adjacent means same x or y with difference of 1).\n  \n- **Blocking Paths**: After eating (4,1), moving up the column to (4,4) is clear since the body segments are not blocking the path upwards from (4,1) to (4,4).\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 22\n\nGiven the analysis, the only valid and safe move at Turn 22 is to move **Right (R)** to (2,1). This sets up the sequence to safely consume both positive foods while avoiding collisions and adhering to movement constraints.\n\n### Action for Turn 22\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> - Head direction: Currently moving Down (D). That means from the previous position, it moved to (1,1). Since the head is at (1,1) and direction is D, it must have come from above, but (1,2) is the next segment, so it moved from (1,2) to (1,1)? Let's list the positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), ...]. If head is at (1,1) and direction is D, that means it was at (1,2) before and moved down to (1,1). But in the list, (1,2) is the second position, which is the body after the head. Snake positions are head first, so head is (1,1), then next is (1,2), which is directly below, meaning the snake is moving down.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (1,1), index 1: (1,2), index 2: (2,2), index 3: (2,3), index 4: (3,3), index 5: (3,2), index 6: (3,1), index 7: (4,1) tail.\n> \n> Since head is at (1,1) and direction is D, it must have moved from (1,2) to (1,1), but (1,2) is the second segment. Actually, the direction indicates the current movement vector. So with direction D, from (1,1), moving down would go to (1,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that might be invalid. I need to find possible moves.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 7? No, food positions: (4,1, 7, 1) – that's (x,y, life_span, value). Let's read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 1, 7, 1) - (4, 4, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> So first food: position (4,1), life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> Second food: (4,4), life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Both are positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Now, life_span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 22, life_span=7 means it will disappear after 7 more turns, so at turn 29? Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, life_span left is given, and it decreases by 1 each turn until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> For (4,1): life_span=7 at turn 22, so it will be there until turn 22+7-1=28? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So if life_span is given at turn t, it means it has that many turns left, including the current turn. So after one turn, at turn t+1, life_span decreases to N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? Typically, it should be that at the start of turn t, if life_span >0, it exists, and after the turn, if life_span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But for movement, we need to know if food is present when we move.\n> \n> Similarly, for the food at (4,1), which is exactly where the tail is.

So to eat it, the tail must move away, and then head moves to (4,1). But when the snake moves, the tail moves only if it doesn't eat food. If it eats food, the tail doesn't move, it grows.\n> \n> But in this case, since food is under the tail, for it to be eaten, first the snake must move such that the tail leaves (4,1), and then later head can move to (4,1) to eat it.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see the current state.\n> \n> Snake head at (1,1), tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Food at (4,1) with life_span=7, value=1.\n> \n> Another food at (4,4) with life_span=10, value=1.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, down.

Food at (4,1) with life span 6.\n> \n> But for movement, it's accessible.\n> \n> Now, possible actions: U to (3,2) or R to (4,1)\n> \n> Both seem possible.\n> \n> U to (3,2) is tail, safe.\n> \n> R to (4,1) is empty, safe.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (4,1) has food with life span 6. Current turn is 23, so after turn 23, life span decreases.\n> \n> Food life span: it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> For food at (4,1): life span 6 at turn 23. So on turn 23, it's present, life span 6.\n> \n> After turn 23, on turn 24, life span becomes 5, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 9 at turn 23.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 24 actions.\n> \n> If I move R on turn 23, then turn 24 head at (3,1) dir R.\n> \n> Options: U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,2), then head to (3,2), which was tail, so after move, new snake: head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3) removed? Let's see: old positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2)\n> \n> Move U to (3,2): (3,2) is current position of tail, so head moves to (3,2), then body: (3,1) becomes new segment, (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). Tail (3,3) is removed? Segment 6 was (3,3), which is not tail; tail was (3,2).\n> \n> In the list: indices: 0: head (3,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (1,1), 3: (1,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving U to (3,2): new head (3,2), then body: previous head (3,1) becomes body, then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). Tail (3,2) is gone, but (3,3) is now the last? New positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). So tail is (3,3).\n> \n> And (3,2) was occupied, but since it was tail and we moved there, it's ok.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (4,1) on turn 24, then head to (4,1), which has food? (4,1) has food, so if I move there, I eat the food.\n> \n> But let's not jump ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to plan sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (3,2) after turn 23 move? After turn 23 action R, snake head at (3,1), tail at (3,2).\n> \n> Is head adjacent to tail? (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), which has no food; food is at (4,1) and (4,4), not on tail.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> For turn 24, from (3,1), I can choose U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,2), I go to tail position, no food, so snake grows? No, only if I eat food.\n> \n> Moving to (3,2) doesn't eat food, so length same, tail removed.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,1), and (4,1) has food, so I eat it, snake grows by one segment, so length becomes 9, no tail removed.\n> \n> Then new tail is the last segment.\n> \n> But let's think strategically.\n> \n> I need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but with risks.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns from now, so by turn 28? Life span 6 at turn 23: present on turns 23,24,25,26,27,28; after turn 28, gone. Countdown decreases each turn including current, so at turn 23, life=6, turn 24 life=5, ..., turn 28 life=1, turn 29 life=0 gone. So available until turn 28 inclusive? Let's see: if life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning after N decreases to 0.\n> \n> Typically, at turn t, if life span is L, it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, then after turn t, life span L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, life span 1, then after that turn, gone, so not present on turn t+L.\n> \n> So for (4,1) at turn 23, life span 6, so present on turns 23,24,25,26,27,28 (6 turns: 23 to 28), gone on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 9, present turns 23 to 31.\n> \n> Now, I am at turn 23, head at (2,1), moving to (3,1) on turn 23 action R.\n> \n> Then turn 24, head at (3,1).\n> \n> From (3,1), if I move R to (4,1), I eat the food at (4,1), since it's there.

New head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) and since ate food, a new segment is added, so tail is not removed, new segment at previous tail position? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake increases by one segment.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so the new head is at food, and the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the previous head (3,1) becomes body, and all body segments remain, so snake is (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) — 9 segments.\n> \n> Tail at (3,2).\n> \n> Head direction R.\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> U: (4,2)\n> \n> D: (4,0) wall, invalid\n> \n> L: (3,1) but (3,1) is body, not tail, so collision\n> \n> R: (5,1)\n> \n> L is left, current direction R, so instant reverse not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So cannot move L.\n> \n> U to (4,2): (4,2) is free?

So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it's moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - At (4,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Since current turn is 24, this food will disappear after 5 turns, so by turn 29 (24 + 5 = 29, but since life span decreases each turn including current, it should disappear after turn 28? Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: It says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,1), life span 5 on turn 24. That means:\n> \n> - Turn 24: life span 5\n> \n> - Turn 25: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 26: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 27: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 28: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 29: life span 0, so it disappears before turn 29 or after turn 28? I think it disappears at the end of turn when life span reaches 0. But typically, it should be available until the turn it expires.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for N=5, on turn t, it has life span L, after that turn, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten on the turn when life span is still >0.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,4) with life span 8, so it will last until turn 24 + 8 - 1? Let's not overcomplicate. On turn t, food with life span L can be eaten if L >=1, and after eating, it's gone.\n> \n> After each turn, life span decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,1): life span 5 on turn 24. So it can be eaten on turns 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. After turn 28, life span becomes 0, so disappears before turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): life span 8, can be eaten from turn 24 to 31 (24+7=31, since 8 turns including current: turns 24 to 31 inclusive?

No, in Snake, when you eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place or something? Standard Snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> The rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food. So when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. The snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> But the movement: normally, each turn, head moves to new position, and tail moves forward, so last segment is removed unless you eat.\n> \n> When you don't eat, head moves to new cell, tail end is removed.\n> \n> When you eat, head moves to new cell, tail end is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,1) and eat the food, the snake grows.\n> \n> Now, current snake positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2).

Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (4,1), tail at (3,2). Are they adjacent? (4,1) and (3,2): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So (4,1) and (3,2) are diagonal, not adjacent.

D invalid.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2): head to (4,2), no food there, so no eat, tail moves. After eating on turn 24, the tail didn't move, so on turn 25, if I don't eat, tail moves.\n> \n> After turn 24: positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2)] tail at (3,2)\n> \n> Turn 25, move U to (4,2): no food at (4,2), so head moves to (4,2), and tail is removed, so new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — tail at (3,3), length 8? No, after growth on turn 24, length is 9, but on turn 25 no eat, so length remains 9, but tail moves.\n> \n> Positions: head to (4,2), then previous head (4,1) becomes body, and so on, up to (3,3), and the last segment (3,2) is removed, so the body is (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — that's 8 segments? Indices: new head (4,2), then segment 1: (4,1), seg2: (3,1), seg3: (2,1), seg4: (1,1), seg5: (1,2), seg6: (2,2), seg7: (2,3), seg8: (3,3) tail. So length 8? But on turn 24, after eat, length was 9: positions from head to tail: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2). When no eat on turn 25, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so the new body includes all except the last tail segment. So new positions: head (4,2), then the first body segment is the previous head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — and (3,2) is gone, so 8 segments. But length should be 9 after growth, but when you don't eat, the tail moves, so length stays the same only if you don't eat; when you eat, length increases, then when you don't eat, it stays increased but tail moves.\n> \n> Initial length before turn 24: 8 segments.\n> \n> Turn 24: eat, so after move, length 9.\n> \n> Turn 25: no eat, move, so head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length back to 8? No, that's wrong.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat, you grow, so the length increases permanently until you die or something.\n> \n> When you eat food, the snake grows by one segment, meaning that when you move, the tail does not advance, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Then, on subsequent moves, if you don't eat, the tail advances, so the length stays the same.\n> \n> For example, start length L.\n> \n> After move to food: head moves to food, new segment added, so length L+1.\n> \n> Then next move, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves from its position, so length L+1.\n> \n> If food, head moves, new segment added, length L+2, and so on.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 24: eat at (4,1), so snake grows to length 9.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,1), body segments including the new one, so positions list has 9 elements.\n> \n> Turn 25: if no eat, head moves to new position, say (4,2), no food, so tail is removed, positions: new head (4,2), then previous positions from index 0 to 7 become body, but index 0 was head, now it's body, and index 8 was tail, removed. So new positions: (4,2) head, then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — 8 positions? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Initial positions turn 24 before move: 8 segments.\n> \n> After move to (4,1) and eat: head to (4,1), and the tail is not removed, so the new positions are: (4,1) head, then the previous segments: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) — so 9 positions.\n> \n> Turn 25, move to (4,2) no food: head moves to (4,2), and since no eat, the tail is removed. The tail is at (3,2), so it is removed. New positions: head at (4,2), then the first body segment is (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — that's 8 segments. So length is back to 8? But we grew on turn 24, so length should be 9.\n> \n> Mistake: when you add a segment by eating, the length increases, so on turn 25, after moving without eating, the length should be 9, but the tail moves, so the positions change.\n> \n> After eating on turn 24, positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) ]\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,1), index 1: (3,1), ..., index 8: tail (3,2)\n> \n> On turn 25, move head to (4,2) no food: new head at (4,2), then the body segments are the previous positions from index 0 to 7, which are (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), and the tail index 8 (3,2) is removed. But (3,3) is now the new tail? Positions: new head (4,2), then body: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — so 8 segments, but it should be 9 segments because we grew.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental misunderstanding.\n> \n> In Snake, when you eat, you grow, so the length increases. On the turn you eat, the head moves to the food, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> On the next turn, if you don't eat, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the length remains the same, not decrease.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating at turn t, positions have L+1 segments.\n> \n> At turn t+1, if no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves from its position to the next, but since the tail moves, the last position is removed, but the new head is added, so the number of segments remains L+1.\n> \n> In the position list, when you move without eating, you remove the last element (tail) and add the new head at front.\n> \n> When you move with eating, you add the new head but do not remove the tail, so the list grows by one.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> Turn 24 before move: positions list has 8 elements.\n> \n> Move to (4,1) with eat: add new head (4,1) to front, do not remove tail, so new list: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) — 9 elements.\n> \n> Turn 25, move to (4,2) no eat: add new head (4,2) to front, and remove tail (3,2), so new list: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — 9 elements, tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Yes, so length remains 9.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had not eaten on turn 24, length would be 8.\n> \n> Back to the decision.\n> \n> If I move R on turn 24 to (4,1), eat food, grow to length 9.\n> \n> Then on turn 25, from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Let's say I move U to (4,2).\n> \n> Then head at (4,2), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (4,3), or (3,2), or (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, wall, so not possible.\n> \n> (5,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, (3,2) might be occupied or not, but at that point, positions after turn 25: as above, (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) tail.\n> \n> So (3,2) is free now, since tail moved.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by body, L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> Current head direction after move to (4,2) is U, so I can move U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n> \n> R to (5,2) invalid, so only U to (4,3) or L to (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is free, as per above positions.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,3), or L to (3,2).\n> \n> Then and so on.\n> \n> But I need to get to the food at (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is at y=4, x=4.\n> \n> From (4,2), I can go U to (4,3), then to (4,4) to eat.\n> \n> But let's see if that's possible.\n> \n> First, on turn 24, I moved R to (4,1), eat.\n> \n> Turn 25, move U to (4,2), no eat.\n> \n> Turn 26, from (4,2), move U to (4,3), no food at (4,3)?

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) being bottom-left, I assume, but I should confirm coordinates. Typically, in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, and y increases upwards, but in the snake positions, head is at (4,2), and direction is U, which is up, so moving to higher y. Also, food at (4,4) and (3,6) both have value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3).

(4,4) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 26, life span 6, it will disappear after turn 26 + 6 = 32? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span is N, then after turn t, life span becomes N-1, and after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0 and disappears? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L, then after this turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1, and when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify exactly when it disappears, but for planning, since eating happens when head moves onto it, we need to consider when it's present.\n> \n> Assume that food is present as long as life span > 0, and after each turn, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So at turn 26, food (4,4) has life span 6, so it will be present for turns 26,27,28,29,30,31, and disappear after turn 31 (before turn 32?).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life span 9, present until turn 34.\n> \n> Now, I need to get to the food safely.\n> \n> First, from head (4,2), I can go U or L.\n> \n> If I go U to (4,3), then position becomes (4,3), head, then body: (4,2), (4,1), etc.\n> \n> Direction becomes U.\n> \n> Then from (4,3), possible moves: U, L, R (since direction U, cannot D).\n> \n> U to (4,4) – that's the food!

(4,4) is food, but I need to check if eating it causes collision or something.\n> \n> First, when I move to (4,4), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (4,4), and tail doesn't move off yet? When you eat, the snake grows, so the segment that was tail stays, meaning the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn, I think.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So, after eating, the snake increases in length.\n> \n> Now, positions: if at turn 26, move U to (4,3), so new positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), ..., up to tail (3,3).\n> \n> Turn 26: after move, positions: head at (4,3), then previous head (4,2) becomes second segment, and so on, tail at (3,3).\n> \n> List: new head (4,3), then segments: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) – still 9 segments, no growth.\n> \n> Then turn 27: move to (4,4).

It's turn 27, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on all sides, meaning the snake can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's check the snake positions: snake is at [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) are all at y=1, which is the bottom row? y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 wall, x=7 wall, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food positions: (4,4) with life span 5, value 1; and (3,6) with life span 8, value 1. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,4), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn? The countdown decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 27, life span is 5, so it will disappear after turn 27 + 5 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The food has a life span N, and countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn. So on the turn it appears, life span is N, after that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. But when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before? The description says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone by turn t + L. For example, if life span is 5 on turn 27, then after 5 more turns, on turn 32, it should be gone. But let's see the countdown: on turn 27, life span is 5, so it decreases to 4 on turn 28, to 3 on 29, to 2 on 30, to 1 on 31, to 0 on 32, and disappears after turn 32, so it's not available on turn 33. But since we eat on a turn, as long as it's present during the turn, we can eat it.\n> \n> Typically, food is present until the end of its life span turn. So for (4,4) with life span 5 on turn 27, it will be present on turns 27,28,29,30,31, and disappear after turn 31 or before turn 32? The description says \"disappears after N turns\", and N=5, so after 5 turns from now, which is turn 32, it disappears. So on turn 32, it might still be there or not? This is ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think the countdown is the remaining turns it will exist. So on turn t, if life span is L, then it exists for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so it disappears after t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if on turn t, life span is L, then after this turn, it will have L-1 life left, and it exists until life span reaches 0. When life span is 1, it exists for this turn, and after this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, when life span is 0, it's gone.\n> \n> But in the input, life span is given as a positive number, so on turn 27, for (4,4), life span 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one. So it will be present on turns 27,28,29,30,31. On turn 32, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life span 8, so present until turn 27+7=34? Turn 27: L=8, turn 28: L=7, ..., turn 34: L=1, turn 35: L=0, gone. So present on turns 27 to 34.\n> \n> Turn 27: L=8, after turn 27, L=7 for turn 28, and so on, down to turn 34: L=1, present, after turn 34, it disappears, so not on turn 35.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (4,3), direction U, so moving up.\n> \n> Body segments: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> Let me list the positions in order: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (1,1), 6: (1,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3)\n> \n> So the tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,3), moving up to (4,4) if it moves U.\n> \n> (4,4) has food! Positive food at (4,4) with value 1.\n> \n> But I need to check if I can eat it safely.\n> \n> First, possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because no instant reverse. Current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, moving U to (4,4): that's where the food is.\n> \n> But is it safe? I need to think about collisions and future moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it might be dangerous, but here the food is at (4,4), which is not the tail position. Tail is at (2,3), not adjacent to head directly? Head at (4,3), tail at (2,3), not adjacent; adjacent cells would be (4,4) U, (4,2) D but can't go D, (3,3) L, (5,3) R.\n> \n> (4,4) is above head, which is U.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (4,4), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (4,4), and the tail doesn't move off yet, so body becomes longer.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it is for this turn? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, length increases by one, so the tail remains in place for that turn.\n> \n> Then on subsequent turns, the tail moves.\n> \n> But for collision, after moving, if head collides with body, it dies.\n> \n> Now, current positions: if I move to (4,4), head is at (4,4), and body segments are: after moving, the body follows, but since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (4,4), then previous positions: (4,3) becomes body, (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> Now, is (4,4) occupied? Before moving, (4,4) has food, not body, so it's free. After moving head to (4,4), it's the head, no collision yet.\n> \n> But I need to see if in the new position, head collides with body.\n> \n> Current body positions: (4,3) will be the first body segment, (4,2), (4,1), etc., all different from (4,4), so no collision.\n> \n> But (4,4) is now head, and body is at (4,3), (4,2), etc., all fine.\n> \n> But there might be future risks.\n> \n> Also, walls: (4,4) is within x=1-6, y=1-6? y=6 is wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall. Similarly, x=1 to 6.\n> \n> (4,4): x=4, y=4, both between 1 and 6, so not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), not relevant here.\n> \n> So moving U to (4,4) seems safe for now, and I get +1 score and grow.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> There's another food at (3,6), which is farther away.\n> \n> Now, life span: (4,4) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 31, meaning it's available for turns 27,28,29,30,31. Since we're on turn 27, I can eat it now or later, but if I don't eat it now, it might be risky later.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) has life span 8, so available longer.\n> \n> But let's see the snake path.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,4) now, turn 27: action U, head to (4,4), eat food, length increases to 10 segments? Current length is 9 positions, after eating, length becomes 10.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head at (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) — that's 9 body segments? No: head and 8 body segments? Let's count: positions given: 9 positions, so snake length 9. Head + 8 body segments.\n> \n> After eating, when head moves to food, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move. So positions: new head at (4,4), then the previous head (4,3) becomes segment 1, then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and tail remains (2,3) for now? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail stays, and body moves as usual except tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> So after moving and eating: head at (4,4), then the body segments: the first segment after head is the previous head position (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and the tail is still at (2,3), but since we added a segment, the new tail position is (2,3), and it will move next turn.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and tail (2,3). That's 10 positions: head + 9 body segments? Length 10.\n> \n> But initially 9, after eating, length 10.\n> \n> Now, for turn 28, if I don't move, but I have to move.\n> \n> But let's think about future moves.\n> \n> I need to consider other options.\n> \n> If I don't eat now, I could move L or R.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (4,3) direction U.\n> \n> Can move U, L, R.\n> \n> U: to (4,4) with food.\n> \n> L: to (3,3)\n> \n> R: to (5,3)\n> \n> Now, what is at (3,3)? Not a food position, and not wall, not body? Current positions: snake at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). (3,3) is not in this list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): not occupied, not wall, internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,3) is different.\n> \n> (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) is above, should be free.\n> \n> Now, if I move L to (3,3), then head to (3,3), direction now L? After moving, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> Then body follows: tail moves off (2,3), so new positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) — tail at (2,2) now? After moving without eating, tail moves.\n> \n> From turn 27: move to (3,3), no food there, so head to (3,3), then body: the segment that was at (4,3) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So from positions: head was (4,3), move to (3,3), so new head (3,3), then body segments: the first body segment moves to (4,3), but (4,3) was head, now it's occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> Then (4,2) moves to where? The segment that was at position 1 ( (4,2) ) moves to the previous position of segment 0, which was (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 2 ( (4,1) ) moves to (4,2), and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (1,1), 6: (1,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3) without eating:\n> \n> New head: (3,3)\n> \n> New body: segment 1 (was (4,2)) moves to (4,3) — the old head position\n> \n> Segment 2 (was (4,1)) moves to (4,2) — old position of segment 1\n> \n> Segment 3 (was (3,1)) moves to (4,1) — old position of segment 2\n> \n> Segment 4 (was (2,1)) moves to (3,1) — old position of segment 3\n> \n> Segment 5 (was (1,1)) moves to (2,1) — old position of segment 4\n> \n> Segment 6 (was (1,2)) moves to (1,1) — old position of segment 5\n> \n> Segment 7 (was (2,2)) moves to (1,2) — old position of segment 6\n> \n> Segment 8 (was (2,3)) moves to (2,2) — old position of segment 7\n> \n> And tail was at (2,3), so it moves off, so the new tail is at (2,2)?

So the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Snake head direction: Left (L), since it's moving left from (3,4) to... wait, positions are given with head first, so from (3,4) to (4,4) is actually the neck. Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Next: (4,4)  // so the snake was moving right to (4,4) but now head is at (3,4) with direction L, meaning it just moved left to (3,4)? I need to interpret the direction.\n> \n> The head direction is given as L, meaning the snake is currently facing left, so from the previous position, it moved left to (3,4). But the positions list shows head at (3,4) and then (4,4), which is to the right. That means the snake was moving right to (4,4) at some point, but now it has moved left to (3,4), so the direction is left.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]\n> \n> So, from head to tail: (3,4) <- head, then (4,4) is the first body segment, which is to the right of head, so indeed, head is at (3,4) and it moved left from (4,4) to (3,4), so current direction is left.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,6) with life_span=6, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life_span=9, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Life span: (3,6) has 6 turns left, including current turn, so it disappears after 6 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span=N at turn t, it will disappear at turn t+N. So for turn 29, life_span=6 means it will be gone after turn 34? Let's see: at turn t, life_span decreases by 1 each turn, so if current turn is 29, and life_span=6, then:\n> \n> - Turn 29: life_span=6\n> \n> - Turn 30: life_span=5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 34: life_span=1? After turn 34, it should disappear, I think. Typically, if life_span=N at turn t, it lasts for N turns including t, so after N-1 more turns it disappears. But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life_span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (3,6): at turn 29, life_span=6, so:\n> \n> - Turn 29: life_span=6\n> \n> - Turn 30: life_span=5\n> \n> - Turn 31: life_span=4\n> \n> - Turn 32: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 33: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 34: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 35: life_span=0, disappears before turn 35 or at the end of turn 34? I think it disappears when life_span reaches 0, so at the start of turn 35, it's gone.

Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2), so I need to avoid that.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head at (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So the tail is at (1,2).

So at turn 30, life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, so by turn 35 it's gone. Similarly, (4,5) has life span 8, so it disappears at turn 38.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence starting from turn 30. Since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan moves for at least turns 30 to 34 or 35.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. Internal obstacle at (5,2).

No.\n> \n> When snake eats, head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move that turn. Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, head moves to food, body follows, but since you eat, length increases, so the tail stays in place or rather, a new segment is added at the head position after move.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new position. If it's food, length increases by one, so the tail doesn't move; the new head position is added, and all segments shift, but tail stays. If no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions: let’s say current positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move: new head position, then old head becomes seg1, seg1 becomes seg2, ..., and tail is removed if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail is not removed, so new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> For example: positions [A,B,C] with C tail. Move to D, if D not food, new positions [D,A,B] with B tail.

It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (3,6), then body segments at (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), and tail at (1,2). So the snake has 11 segments. The head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to reach (3,6) from (3,5) in the previous turn.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - One at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 7. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, this food will disappear after 7 more turns, so by turn 38.\n> \n> - Another at (2,1) with value 1 and life span 10, so it disappears after 10 more turns, by turn 41.\n> \n> But the food at (2,1) is listed, and looking at the snake positions, (2,1) is part of the snake body. Specifically, (2,1) is the 9th segment in the list: positions are [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]. So index 0: head (3,6), index 1: (3,5), index 2: (3,4), index 3: (4,4), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (4,2), index 6: (4,1), index 7: (3,1), index 8: (2,1), index 9: (1,1), index 10: tail (1,2).\n> \n> (2,1) is occupied by the snake body, and there's food there. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So currently, since (2,1) is occupied, we can't eat it now; we have to wait for the snake to move so that this cell is free, and then the head can move to it.\n> \n> Similarly, the food at (4,5) is not occupied by the snake, so it can be eaten if the head moves there.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. I should consider possible moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at borders and (5,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,6), body down to (1,2).\n> \n> Food: (4,5) and (2,1) but (2,1) is under body.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so I just moved to (3,6) by moving Up from (3,5).\n> \n> Possible actions now: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Current direction U, so opposite is D, which is not allowed. So I can go Up, Left, or Right.\n> \n> From (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,7). But y=7 is a border wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,7) is on y=7, which is a wall, so moving Up to (3,7) would be a wall collision, death. So Up is invalid.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,6)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,5), but (3,5) is the body segment right behind the head. Moving Down would put head at (3,5), which is currently occupied by the body. But according to movement constraints, it might be okay if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment that is not the tail is collision. Only moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is at (1,2). So moving to (3,5) would be head touching body, collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, Down is invalid because it's opposite direction and also leads to collision.\n> \n> Up is invalid due to wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, (2,6) and (4,6) are both empty, I think. Let's check the positions.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So (2,6) and (4,6) are not in this list, and no walls there except borders which are fine as long as not on wall cells. (2,6) is within bounds, similarly (4,6).\n> \n> Also, obstacles: internal at (5,2), not relevant here.\n> \n> So, two choices: L or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,5): value +1, life span 7. It's at (4,5), which is one cell down and right from head? Head at (3,6), (4,5) is x=4,y=5.\n> \n> From (3,6), to reach (4,5), I could go Right to (4,6), then Down to (4,5). Or other ways, but directly.\n> \n> But from (4,6), I can go Down to (4,5), which is the food.\n> \n> If I go Right now to (4,6), then next turn I can go Down to (4,5) to eat it, assuming no issues.\n> \n> But let's see the life span. Current turn 31, life span 7, so it disappears after turn 38? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 31, life span 7, meaning it has 7 turns left including this one. So after 7 turns, on turn 38, it disappears before the turn starts or after? Need to clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear after L more turns, so it exists for turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L or something. Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears. So it exists as long as countdown >0.\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it is present from turn t to turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, turn 31, life_span 7, so countdown starts at 7. After turn 31, countdown 6 at turn 32, ..., after turn 37, countdown 0, so at turn 38, it is gone.\n> \n> So food at (4,5) can be eaten from turn 31 to 37.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,1) life_span 10, can be eaten from turn 31 to 40.\n> \n> But (2,1) is currently occupied by snake body, so we need to free that cell first.\n> \n> Now, back to current move.\n> \n> Options: Left to (2,6) or Right to (4,6).\n> \n> If I go Right to (4,6), then next turn I can go Down to (4,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows by one segment, since positive food.\n> \n> Current length 11, after eating, length 12.\n> \n> But need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> From (4,5), after eating, the new tail will be added, but the head moves to (4,5), and the body follows.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Another option: go Left to (2,6), then I might go towards the other food or something.\n> \n> But the other food is at (2,1), which is far and under body.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move to eat (4,5).\n> \n> Plan to go Right then Down.\n> \n> But after eating, where can I go?\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, for (4,5), it's not near the tail, so probably fine.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,2), head at (3,6), far apart.\n> \n> So eating (4,5) should be safe.\n> \n> But after eating at (4,5), head is at (4,5), and body: the previous head was at (3,6), now it becomes body, so positions after move: if I go from (3,6) to (4,6), then to (4,5), eating food.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 31: move R to (4,6)\n> \n> New positions: head moves to (4,6), then body segments: the previous head (3,6) becomes first body, but since the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position except when growing.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, and a new cell is added.\n> \n> But in terms of positions:\n> \n> After turn 31 move R:\n> \n> - Head to (4,6)\n> \n> - Then body: the first body segment (which was at (3,5)) moves to the old head position (3,6)?

No.\n> \n> When the snake grows, after moving, the head is at new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the tail position is duplicated for the new segment.\n> \n> So in this case, after moving to (4,5) with growth:\n> \n> - The cell (1,1) was the tail, it remains occupied by the tail, but now it's not moving, so it becomes part of the body, and a new tail is added at (1,1)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows as usual, but the tail does not leave its position; instead, the snake gains a new segment at the tail end, so the tail stays put, and the new segment is at the previous tail position, but since the tail doesn't move, it's the same.\n> \n> Positions: the new head is at (4,5)\n> \n> Then the segment that was at (4,6) is now the first body at (4,6) -- no, when head moves, the first body moves to the old head position.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions list.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0: H (4,6), 1: B1 (3,6), 2: B2 (3,5), 3: B3 (3,4), 4: B4 (4,4), 5: B5 (4,3), 6: B6 (4,2), 7: B7 (4,1), 8: B8 (3,1), 9: B9 (2,1), 10: T (1,1)\n> \n> After moving Down to (4,5) and eating food:\n> \n> New head at (4,5)\n> \n> Then, the body segments: the segment that was at index 1 (B1 at (3,6)) moves to the old head position (4,6), so new index 1 at (4,6)\n> \n> The segment that was at index 2 (B2 at (3,5)) moves to old index 1 position (3,6), so new index 2 at (3,6)\n> \n> The segment that was at index 3 (B3 at (3,4)) moves to old index 2 position (3,5), so new index 3 at (3,5)\n> \n> Index 4 (B4 at (4,4)) moves to old index 3 position (3,4), so new index 4 at (3,4)\n> \n> Index 5 (B5 at (4,3)) moves to old index 4 position (4,4), so new index 5 at (4,4)\n> \n> Index 6 (B6 at (4,2)) moves to old index 5 position (4,3), so new index 6 at (4,3)\n> \n> Index 7 (B7 at (4,1)) moves to old index 6 position (4,2), so new index 7 at (4,2)\n> \n> Index 8 (B8 at (3,1)) moves to old index 7 position (4,1), so new index 8 at (4,1)\n> \n> Index 9 (B9 at (2,1)) moves to old index 8 position (3,1), so new index 9 at (3,1)\n> \n> Then, the tail: since eating, the tail does not move; it stays at (1,1), but this position is now occupied by the new segment that is added. The segment that was tail is now the second last, and a new tail is added at the same position.\n> \n> The tail segment remains at its position, and a new segment is added there, so the position (1,1) is now occupied by the new body segment, and the new tail is at (1,1) as well? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> In snake games, when the snake eats, the head moves to the food, the body follows as if moving, but the tail does not advance; it stays in place, and a new segment is created at the tail position, so the snake length increases by one, with the tail remaining stationary for that turn.\n> \n> So for positions: the new head is at the food cell.\n> \n> Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> But for the tail, since no movement, it stays, and the new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> After move with growth:\n> \n> - New head at (4,5)\n> \n> - New body segment 1 at old head position (4,6)\n> \n> - New body segment 2 at old body 1 position (3,6)\n> \n> - New body segment 3 at old body 2 position (3,5)\n> \n> - New body segment 4 at old body 3 position (3,4)\n> \n> - New body segment 5 at old body 4 position (4,4)\n> \n> - New body segment 6 at old body 5 position (4,3)\n> \n> - New body segment 7 at old body 6 position (4,2)\n> \n> - New body segment 8 at old body 7 position (4,1)\n> \n> - New body segment 9 at old body 8 position (3,1)\n> \n> - New body segment 10 at old body 9 position (2,1)\n> \n> - New tail at old tail position (1,1)  // this is the new segment added\n> \n> So now the snake has 12 segments: head at (4,5), body at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), tail at (1,1)\n> \n> And the old position of the tail (1,1) is still occupied, but now by the new tail.\n> \n> The food at (2,1) was under the body, but after this move, the body has moved, so (2,1) is now occupied by a body segment, but it's not free yet.\n> \n> In the new positions, (2,1) is occupied by the 11th segment, which is body, not tail.\n> \n> But for the food to be eatable, the cell must be free when the head moves to it.\n> \n> Back to the decision.\n> \n> At turn 31, if I go Right to (4,6), then at turn 32, I can go Down to (4,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> After that, head at (4,5), direction Down.\n> \n> From there, I need to move somewhere.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): U, D, L, R, but direction is D, so cannot go U (opposite), so can go D, L, or R.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): but (4,4) is body segment in the new positions.

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, because walls are at 0 and 7, so coordinates 0 and 7 are walls, not playable. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), and body segments: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So the snake is 11 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is right, so last move was to the right, to (4,6) from (3,6)? Positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), which is left of head, so yes, head moved right to (4,6).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,5), life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? So if not eaten now, it has 5 more turns? Life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 32, life span 6, it will disappear after turn 37 (since 32 + 6 - 1 = 37? Let's think: at turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t + N. So for turn 32, life span 6, it will be there until the end of turn 37? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until life span 0 at some turn, and it disappears before that turn or after? The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let me read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span L, after this turn, at turn t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or at the end of the turn? The problem doesn't specify, but I think it's common to assume that food is present during the turn if life span > 0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> To be safe, I'll assume that at the start of turn t, if food has life span S, it can be eaten during turn t, and after the turn, life span decreases to S-1 for turn t+1. If S=1 at start of turn, it can be eaten this turn and disappears after.\n> \n> For (4,5): at turn 32, life span 6, so it can be eaten for 6 more turns? From turn 32 to turn 37? Turn 32: S=6, after turn, S=5 for turn 33. At turn 33, S=5, and so on, down to turn 37: S=1 at start, can be eaten, disappears after turn 37. So available from turn 32 to 37 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life span 9, available from turn 32 to 40 inclusive? Turn 32 S=9, turn 33 S=8, ..., turn 40 S=1, disappears after.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,6), direction right. So possible moves: up, down, left, right? But no instant reverse, so since head direction is right, it just moved right, so cannot move left immediately, because that would be reverse to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,6). So for next move, it can go U, D, or R, but not L, because L is opposite to R.\n> \n> Directions: U (y+1), D (y-1), L (x-1), R (x+1).\n> \n> Head at (4,6), so:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so not possible.

Moving left would go to (3,6), which is occupied by the body. But is it deadly? Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> Important: collisions. Head touches body segment: if it's not the tail, it's collision and death. But if it's the tail, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving left to (3,6): (3,6) is the position after head, which is the neck, not tail. Snake positions: head (4,6), then (3,6) is the first body segment. So if head moves to (3,6), it would collide with the body segment there, and since the tail is far away, this is a collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right: R to (5,6). (5,6) is within bounds? x=5, y=6. Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. (5,6) is playable.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake positions: all positions listed, (5,6) not in the list, so free? Also, obstacles: internal obstacle (5,2), not here. So (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> Moving down to (4,5): which has food.\n> \n> Moving left to (3,6): occupied by snake body, collision.\n> \n> Up to (4,7): wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,5) or R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, (4,5) has positive food, so if I move down, I eat it, score +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: last one is (1,1), so tail at (1,1).\n> \n> Head at (4,6), tail at (1,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,6) and (1,1) are far, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,5) to eat food should be safe and beneficial.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there's another food at (2,1), which is near the tail.\n> \n> Current turn is 32, I need to output action sequence for turn 32, 33, 34, etc., but only for a few turns? The answer format says \"action sequence\" but doesn't specify how many turns. It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> But in the answer, it should be a sequence like Turn 32: action, Turn 33: action, etc.\n> \n> I need to decide for turn 32 first.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - Move D to (4,5): eat food, length becomes 12, head now at (4,5). Then from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> - Move R to (5,6): no food, head at (5,6), snake moves, tail moves, so the body segment at (1,1) is removed, new positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), etc. down to (2,1), I think? After move, tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, tail moves away, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> If eating, tail stays, so new segment added.\n> \n> For turn 32:\n> \n> If I move D to (4,5), I eat the food, so new head position (4,5), and the body: the previous head (4,6) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and since I ate, I add a new segment at the tail? No, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, the head is now at food, and you add a new segment at the tail position, so the tail stays in place for that turn, then next turn it moves.\n> \n> More precisely: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move; so the snake grows by one cell. The new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> When not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves out of the last cell.\n> \n> So for eating at (4,5): head moves to (4,5), and since it ate, tail does not move, so positions: new head (4,5), then previous positions except tail stays: so body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and tail (1,1) still there. So snake now has 12 segments.\n> \n> If not eating, move to (5,6): head moves to (5,6), then body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), ..., down to (2,1), and tail (1,1) is removed, so positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — that's 11 positions, tail at (2,1).\n> \n> Original positions: 11 segments. After move without eating, head new position, each segment moves to previous position, so last segment (tail) is removed from the list.\n> \n> So after move to (5,6) without eating: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — that's 11, tail at (2,1).\n> \n> (1,1) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 32 choice.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,5), I eat the food, get +1, length 12.\n> \n> But is there any risk? The food at (4,5) is under the body? Currently, at turn 32, where is (4,5)? Snake positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So (4,5) is not occupied by snake? It's free, with food.\n> \n> (4,5) is not in the list, so it's free, and food is there.\n> \n> Moving down to (4,5) is fine.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> After moving to (4,5), head at (4,5), direction was down, so head direction now D.\n> \n> Then from (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: to (4,6) — but (4,6) is now the second segment, since after move, positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), which is the neck. So moving up to (4,6) would be collision with body.\n> \n> D: to (4,4) — (4,4) is in positions, it's the 5th segment? Let's see positions after eating: head (4,5), body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), ... down to (1,1). (4,4) is occupied, so moving down to (4,4) would collide.\n> \n> L: to (3,5) — (3,5) is in positions, occupied.\n> \n> R: to (5,5) — is (5,5) free? Let's check: not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not here. So (5,5) should be free.\n> \n> After moving down to (4,5) and eating, from (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,6): occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - D to (4,4): occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - L to (3,5): occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - R to (5,5): free\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (5,5).

Not in positions, so yes.\n> \n> D to (5,4): free?\n> \n> L to (4,5): but (4,5) is now the second segment, occupied.\n> \n> R to (6,5): within bounds? x=6, y=5, playable.\n> \n> So from (5,5), can go U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5), but not L to (4,5) because occupied.\n> \n> Head direction is R, but no instant reverse issue since last move was to (5,5) from (4,5), which was right, so moving left would be opposite, but left to (4,5) is occupied anyway, so not possible.\n> \n> Now, if I had chosen to go right at turn 32 to (5,6) without eating.\n> \n> At turn 32, move R to (5,6): no food, so positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — tail at (2,1), since (1,1) is removed.\n> \n> Head direction now R.\n> \n> From (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, not possible.\n> \n> D to (5,5): free?

At turn 32, tail is at (1,1), and (2,1) is the second last segment? Positions: ... (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) — so (2,1) is the 10th segment? Indices: head (4,6) index 0, (3,6) 1, (3,5) 2, (3,4) 3, (4,4) 4, (4,3) 5, (4,2) 6, (4,1) 7, (3,1) 8, (2,1) 9, (1,1) 10. So (2,1) is position 9, body segment, not tail. Tail is (1,1).\n> \n> Food at (2,1) is on a body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> So currently, (2,1) has food, but it's under the snake body, so I can't eat it now because the head is not on it, and it's covered.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,1) moves away, freeing the cell, then later head can move to it.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, if I don't eat, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n> \n> For example, if I move away from eating now, the tail might move, freeing (1,1) or something.\n> \n> But food is at (2,1), which is not the tail.\n> \n> At turn 32, if I move without eating, tail (1,1) is removed, so (2,1) becomes the new tail? After move to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — so tail at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, (2,1) has food, but it's the tail position. So if head moves to (2,1), it would be eating the food at tail.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, if head moves to (2,1) while it's the tail, and it has food, but since head moves to tail, and eats it, the snake grows, so new tail is the old tail position, but since head is now there, and tail doesn't move, it might cause collision.\n> \n> Specifically: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, head is at food, and the new tail is added at the old tail position, but since head just moved to that cell, it's the same cell, so collision? Or the new tail is behind.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at T, and head is adjacent to T. If head moves to T to eat the food, then after move, head is at T, and since it ate, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: the segment at T is now part of body, and a new segment is added at T? No.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place for this turn, so the new tail is the old tail position, but now it's not moving, so the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> But when head moves to the tail cell, which has food.\n> \n> For example, positions: ..., A, H, T where H is head adjacent to tail T. If head moves to T, to eat food at T.\n> \n> After move: head is now at T, and since it ate, tail does not move, so the previous position of head becomes body, and tail stays at T? But now head and tail are both at T? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Positions: before move, say body segments: S1, S2, ..., Sk, head H, tail T. H and T are adjacent.\n> \n> If head moves to T (which has food), then new head is at T, and since it ate, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: the new positions are: new head at T, then previous head H, then S1, S2, ..., Sk, and tail T still? But T is now head, so it's inconsistent.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: the tail is a position. When snake moves, if not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, so tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> If eating, head moves to food, body segments move, but tail does not move, so the tail cell is not abandoned, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to the food, the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the snake gains one segment; the new segment is effectively at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, it stays, and a new cell is added at that position.\n> \n> For example, positions before: ..., body, tail.\n> \n> After eating: head at new position (food), then previous head, then body, and tail still at old tail position. So the tail position now has the tail segment, and it's the end.\n> \n> In the case where head moves to tail position:\n> \n> Suppose positions: A (head), B (tail), and A and B adjacent. Food at B.\n> \n> Head moves to B. New head at B. Since it ate, tail does not move, so new positions: head B, then previous head A, and tail B? But B is now head, so tail cannot be at B.\n> \n> The tail is the last position. Before move, positions: [A, B] with A head, B tail.\n> \n> After moving head to B (food), new head at B, and since ate, tail does not move, so the snake grows: new positions are [B, A] but now B is head, A is the only body, and tail should be B? No, tail is the last element.\n> \n> After move: the new head is at the food cell B. The previous head A becomes the first body segment. The tail B, since it didn't move, but B is now the head, so the tail is removed? I'm messing up.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake is a list of coordinates. When moving without eating, head moves to new coord, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last position is removed.\n> \n> With eating, head moves to new coord, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the last position is not removed, so the list gains one element.\n> \n> So for [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with H head, T tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell N without eating: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed, so last is Bk or whatever.\n> \n> With eating: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, length increased.\n> \n> In the case where N is T, the tail position.\n> \n> If head is at H, tail at T, adjacent. Food at T.\n> \n> Head moves to T. New head at T. Since ate, new positions: [T, H, B1, B2, ..., T] but T is duplicated, which is impossible.\n> \n> The position T is occupied by both head and tail? That can't be.\n> \n> Therefore, it's a collision and death. That's the Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> After eating, head is at the food cell (which was tail), and the new tail is added at the old tail position, but since head is there, it's the same cell, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, so it's fatal.\n> \n> In this state, for (2,1), if the head moves to it when it is the tail, it would be dangerous.\n> \n> But currently at turn 32, (2,1) is not tail; tail is (1,1). (2,1) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food is at (2,1), so to eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body moves away from (2,1), freeing the cell, then head can move to it later.\n> \n> When the segment at (2,1) moves, the cell is freed, and food is there, so head can go there.\n> \n> But at that time, if (2,1) is the tail, and head is adjacent, it might be dangerous, but if not tail, it's ok.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> For turn 32, I have two choices:\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,5) to eat food.\n> \n> Then, as before, I must go R to (5,5) on next turn.\n> \n> At (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), or R to (6,5).\n> \n> (5,6) is free, (5,4) free, (6,5) free.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,1) with life span 9, so I have time.\n> \n> But with longer snake, it might be harder to maneuver.\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (5,6) without eating.\n> \n> Then from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> If I go to (5,5), then from there similar as above.\n> \n> Or to (6,6).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (4,5).

mobility constraints. Subsequent moves prioritize moving right and down to open areas to delay collision, but long-term survival is limited by the snake's length and the obstacle at (5,2).\n",

The earliest the snake can reach the food is turn 39 (6 moves), but the food will still be available until turn 40, so it is theoretically possible to eat it. However, given the current constraints, the snake cannot move directly toward the food without risking collision.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- The only safe move is **Right (R)** to (5, 5).\n- Moving right avoids collision and does not reverse the current direction.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nBased on the analysis, the immediate action for Turn 33 is to move right. The following sequence is planned to navigate safely and avoid collisions:\n\n1. **Turn 33**: Move **Right (R)** to (5, 5).\n2. **Turn 34**: From (5, 5), move **Up (U)** to (5, 6) to avoid boxing in.\n3. **Turn 35**: From (5, 6), move **Right (R)** to (6, 6) (only safe move).\n4. **Turn 36**: From (6, 6), move **Down (D)** to (6, 5).\n5. **Turn 37**: From (6, 5), move **Down (D)** to (6, 4).\n6. **Turn 38**: From (6, 4), move **Left (L)** to (5, 4).\n\nThis sequence prioritizes moving toward open areas to avoid collisions and prepare for potential future food opportunities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 33 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 33 \\)\n> <think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), because x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, and y from 1 to 6. Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> There's an internal obstacle at (5,2), so I can't go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, I assume. In coordinates, D is (x,y-1), so from (4,5), moving down would go to (4,4), but let's see the positions.\n> \n> The positions are given in order: head (4,5), then next is (4,6). That seems odd because if head is at (4,5) and moving down, it should have come from above, but (4,6) is above since y increases up or down? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is top or bottom? The problem says U is (x,y+1), which might imply that y increases upwards, like in math coordinates. Let me check.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) – so increasing y is up.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) – decreasing y is down.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y)\n> \n> So, for example, from (4,5), moving U would go to (4,6), moving D to (4,4), etc.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)]\n> \n> Head is (4,5), and the next segment is (4,6). Since (4,6) has higher y, that means the snake was moving up to get to (4,5)? Let's think about the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down. But the position list has head at (4,5), and the body includes (4,6), which is above it. If head is moving down, it should be going from a higher y to lower y.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current moving direction. Head direction is D, so from previous turn, it must have come from above. Let's see the positions: positions are listed head first, so (4,5) is current head, (4,6) is the segment behind, meaning the head was at (4,6) last turn? No.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0 is head, index 1 is the first body segment, and so on, to the tail.\n> \n> So, at turn t, head is at pos[0], and it was at some position at t-1, but the direction is given as the current moving direction.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it is moving down. That means from (4,5), it is moving towards (4,4) or something, but (4,4) is in the body, but when it moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so it can move to cells that were occupied if the tail leaves.\n> \n> Specifically, from (4,5), moving down to (4,4). But (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake body? Let's see the positions: (4,4) is the 6th position in the list, index 5? Positions: index 0: (4,5), index 1: (4,6), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (3,5), index 4: (3,4), index 5: (4,4), and so on.\n> \n> (4,4) is at index 5, so it is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (1,1), index 11.\n> \n> If the head moves down to (4,4), that would be a collision because (4,4) is a body segment, and it's not the tail that will move away. The tail is at (1,1), far away.\n> \n> But the rule is: you die if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail's position because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (4,4) is not the tail; it's a middle segment. So moving to (4,4) would cause a collision and death.\n> \n> But head direction is D, meaning it is currently moving down. How is that possible without dying? Perhaps at the last turn, it moved to (4,5) from above, and (4,6) was the previous head position or something.\n> \n> Let's think about the movement. At turn t-1, head was at some position, and it moved to (4,5) with direction D.\n> \n> Since direction is D, at turn t-1, head was at (4,6), and it moved down to (4,5). (4,6) is now the first body segment.\n> \n> Then at turn t, current head at (4,5), moving down would go to (4,4). But (4,4) is occupied by the snake body at index 5. Since the snake moves, when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, so the tail segment leaves its cell.\n> \n> Therefore, after the move, the cell that was occupied by the tail is now empty, and all other body cells are still occupied, but shifted.\n> \n> For a cell to be safe to move into, it must be either empty or the current tail position, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> If you move the head to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it will cause a collision because after the move, that cell will have the head and the body segment that moves into it or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> At the start of the turn, the snake occupies certain cells. When you move, the head goes to a new cell. If that new cell is occupied by a body segment, it's only safe if it is the tail segment, because after the move, the tail leaves, so that cell is no longer occupied by the snake. For any other body segment, if you move the head there, after the move, that cell will have both the head and the body segment that moves into the position where the head was, but no.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, and the new head position is set. If the new head position is a cell that was occupied by a body segment (not the tail), then after the move, that body segment is still there or moved? It's messy.\n> \n> Better to think: before the move, the snake has positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving in direction D, new head position is H' = H + D.\n> \n> If H' is not a wall, not an obstacle, and not in {B1, B2, ..., T}, then it's safe, except that if H' is the position of T, the tail, it is safe because after the move, T moves to the position of B_{n-1} or something, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: after the move, the new snake is [H', H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k}], where T was removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail not removed, length increases.\n> \n> But for collision, if H' is equal to any position in the current body segments [B1, B2, ..., T], then:\n> \n> - If H' == T, it is safe because after the move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> - If H' is any other body segment, say B_i for i not last, then after the move, B_i is still in the body, and H' is head, so head collides with body at H'.\n> \n> Yes, that's the rule.\n> \n> In this case, for head at (4,5), moving down to (4,4).\n> \n> Current body positions include (4,4), which is index 5 in the list? List: positions: 0: (4,5) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (1,1) tail.\n> \n> So (4,4) is position of index 5, which is a body segment, not the tail (index 11). Therefore, moving to (4,4) would cause a collision because after move, (4,4) would have head and the segment that was there is still part of the body.\n> \n> Similarly, other body segments.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,1), so moving to (1,1) would be safe only if the head can reach it, but it's far.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, down, so at this turn, if it moves down, it goes to (4,4), which is occupied, collision.\n> \n> But the snake is alive, so it must not be moving down into a body segment.

Not in the list, so possible, but need to check walls.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) is within 1 to 6, no wall, but internal obstacle at (5,2), not (5,5), so (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Moving up to (4,6): (4,6) is index 1, occupied, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so possible moves: not U (reverse), so can move L, R, or D, but D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5) occupied, R to (5,5) free? (5,5) not in occupied list, so yes, only right is possible? But what about down and left are occupied, up is reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> Up to (4,6) is occupied and also reverse, so not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is right to (5,5)? But that can't be, because the snake is at (4,5), and it must have a valid move.\n> \n> Perhaps at this position, with head at (4,5), moving down to (4,4) is not possible because occupied, moving left to (3,5) occupied, moving up to (4,6) occupied and reverse, moving right to (5,5) is free, so it must have come from the right or something, but direction is D.\n> \n> Let's assume that at turn t-1, head was at (4,6), and it moved down to (4,5), so direction is D.\n> \n> At turn t, for next move, I can choose D, L, R, but not U.\n> \n> D to (4,4): occupied, death.\n> \n> L to (3,5): occupied, death.\n> \n> R to (5,5): free, no problem.\n> \n> U not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> So only R is possible without death.\n> \n> Similarly, in the food list, there is food at (2,1) with value 1 and life span 8.\n> \n> Food: (2,1,8,1) – I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), so (2,1) with life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> But (2,1) is currently occupied by the snake, because in positions, index 10: (2,1), and tail is at (1,1), so (2,1) is body segment.\n> \n> Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, at (2,1), there is food, but it's under the snake, so not eatable now.\n> \n> Life span 8, so it will disappear after 8 turns, including current, so it has 8 turns left, including turn 33, so it will disappear after turn 40? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 33, life span 8, after turn 33, it becomes 7, then after turn 34, 6, ..., after turn 40, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 33 to 40, but since it's under snake now, it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and then back.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 33, I need to choose a move.\n> \n> First, I must avoid death. From (4,5), possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (4,6) – but (4,6) is occupied by body segment index 1, not tail, so collision. Also, U is reverse of current direction D, so not allowed by movement constraint. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so moving U is not allowed.\n> \n> - D: to (4,4) – (4,4) is occupied by index 5, not tail, collision.\n> \n> - L: to (3,5) – (3,5) is occupied by index 3, not tail, collision.\n> \n> - R: to (5,5) – (5,5) is not in the occupied list, and not wall, since x=5,y=5, between 1 and 6, and internal obstacle at (5,2) not affecting, so free.

It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and one internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the tail is at (2,1). The head direction is right (R), meaning the snake is moving to the right.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - One at (2,1) with value 1 and life span 7. But (2,1) is the tail position! The food is under the snake's tail.\n> - Another at (2,3) with value 1 and life span 10.\n> \n> Food at (2,1): Since it's under the tail, I can only eat it if the tail moves away and then the head moves onto it. But the tail is at (2,1), so when the snake moves, the tail will move forward if we eat food or not. Let me think about how the snake moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell where the tail was becomes empty. If it eats food, the head moves to the food position, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (2,1), which is currently occupied by the tail. To eat this food, I need:\n> 1. The body moves away from (2,1), meaning the tail moves so that (2,1) is no longer occupied.\n> 2. Then, the head moves onto (2,1).\n> \n> But since the food is under the tail, when the tail moves, the food might still be there if its life span hasn't expired, and then I can move the head to it.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the head is on the food, the tail grows, so the new tail is where the old tail was, but since the head was adjacent, now it might collide or something. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, the head is at (5,5), tail is at (2,1). Are they adjacent? (5,5) to (2,1): delta x = 3, delta y = 4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. Distance should be 1 in one direction.\n> \n> (5,5) to (2,1): |dx|=3, |dy|=4, min distance is 5, not adjacent. So currently, head and tail are not adjacent, so if I eat the food at tail, it should be fine? But the food is under tail, so I need to expose it first.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (2,3), which is not under the snake, I think. Let's see the snake positions: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So (2,3) is not in this list, so it's free. Value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1) food, life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn. So if not eaten, it will disappear after turn 34 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,1) with life span 7 at turn 34, it will disappear after turn 34 + 7 - 1? Or after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it disappears after t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t + (L-1), countdown 0, so it disappears at the start of turn t + L? Or at the end?\n> \n> It says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns have passed, so after turn t + N, it is gone. But countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t, it has L-1 turns left, and so on, until after turn t + L - 1, it has 0 turns left, so it disappears at the beginning of turn t + L.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,3) food, life span 10, at turn 34, it will disappear after turn 34 + 10 - 1? Disappears at turn 34 + 10 = 44?

Let's think.\n> \n> When I eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added. So the tail remains where it was, and a new segment is added behind it? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves from current position to the next segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment, with the tail staying in place.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, the head is on the food cell, and the tail is still at its position, and a new segment is added, so the tail segment remains.\n> \n> For example, if tail was at S, and I eat food at F, then after move, head is at F, the segment before tail is now the new tail? Let's index.\n> \n> Suppose snake positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]\n> \n> After move without food: head moves to new position, say H', then positions become [H', H, B1, ..., Bk], and T is removed, so new tail is Bk.\n> \n> With food eaten: head moves to F, positions become [F, H, B1, ..., Bk, T], so T is still there, and snake grows, new tail is T.\n> \n> In terms of cells: after eating, the cell that was tail remains occupied, and head is on the food cell.\n> \n> Now, for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, meaning |x_h - x_t| + |y_h - y_t| = 1, and the tail cell has food on it.\n> \n> But the food is on the tail cell? In this case, the food is at (2,1), which is not the tail cell; tail is at (3,1), so (2,1) is empty except for food.\n> \n> The rule says \"the tail cell has positive food\", meaning that there is food on the same cell as the tail.\n> \n> But in this state, the food is at (2,1), and tail is at (3,1), different cells.\n> \n> So for (2,1), there is no food on the tail cell, so this danger doesn't apply directly.\n> \n> However, if I eat (2,1), and at that time, the tail is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (2,1), but the head is moving to (2,1), so after move, head at (2,1), tail at (3,1), they are adjacent, but that's fine, as long as not colliding.\n> \n> The danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> But here, food is at (2,1), tail at (3,1), so no issue.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,1) is very close to the current tail at (3,1), and also (4,1) is a body segment.\n> \n> Now, to reach (2,1), I need to go to (3,1) or directly, but (3,1) is tail, which is safe to move to only if it will be vacated.\n> \n> But (2,1) is west of (3,1), so I can move head to (3,1) when the tail moves, but (3,1) is occupied by tail now.\n> \n> Let's think about path to food.\n> \n> First, from current position, I need to go left.\n> \n> But at (6,5), I can only go U or D since R is wall and L is reverse?

So possible moves are Down (D), Left (L), or Right (R).\n  - **Down (D)**: Move to (6, 3)\n    - Check if (6, 3) is valid:\n      - Not a wall (within bounds).\n      - Not occupied by the snake's body (current body positions do not include (6, 3)).\n      - Safe to move.\n  - **Left (L)**: Move to (5, 4)\n    - Check if (5, 4) is valid:\n      - Not a wall.\n      - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n      - Safe to move.\n  - **Right (R)**: Move to (7, 4)\n    - Invalid, as x=7 is a wall.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **Food at (2, 1)**:\n  - Life span: 5 turns (will disappear after Turn 40).\n  - Distance from head: |6-2| + |4-1| = 7 units (Manhattan distance).\n  - Cannot be reached in time (requires at least 7 moves, but only 4 moves until expiration).\n- **Food at (2, 3)**:\n  - Life span: 8 turns (will disappear after Turn 43).\n  - Distance from head: |6-2| + |4-3| = 5 units.\n  - Can be reached in time (e.g., via the sequence D → L → L → L → L to eat on Turn 40).\n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 36):\nBoth moving Down (D) or Left (L) are valid and lead to a path where the snake can eat the food at (2, 3) by Turn 40. \n\n- Moving **Down (D)** first may be slightly better as it moves the snake away from the crowded upper area and towards the bottom where there is more space to maneuver after eating the food.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells outside that are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,4), then body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). That's 12 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is D. That means the snake was moving down to (6,4) from (6,5)? Positions are given head first, so from head to tail: (6,4) is head, (6,5) is next, which is directly below? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then (6,5)  // directly south, so if head is at (6,4) and moving down, but (6,5) is south, so moving down would be increasing y? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up? Let's see:\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is north.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — y-1 is down, so lower y is south.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) — left\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) — right\n> \n> In the positions, head at (6,4), next segment at (6,5). Since (6,5) has higher y, that means it's north of (6,4), so the head is moving south to (6,4) from (6,5)? But head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current head position. So from turn 35 to 36, it moved down to (6,4), so it came from (6,5) to (6,4), which is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> (6,5) to (6,4) is decreasing y, so down. Yes.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current. So at turn 36, for (2,1), life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, so on turn 41 it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (2,3) with life span 8, disappears on turn 44.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current snake head at (6,4), direction D (down). Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move up on the next turn because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> So allowed moves: D, L, R. But D is down, which is (x,y-1), so to (6,3).\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are occupied except the tail. When moving, the head moves to a new cell, and if no food, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is free. But if food eaten, tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> Also, food can be under body, but can only be eaten when head moves there after body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, let's see where food is relative to snake.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) and (2,3).\n> \n> Snake occupies: let's list all positions:\n> \n> (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n> \n> So (4,1) is tail?

(2,1) is at x=2,y=1, which is not occupied by snake? Snake has (4,1), but (2,1) is different.

So playable grid is (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> (6,3) is (6,3), which is within bounds.\n> \n> Is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied, but (6,3) is not in the list. (6,3) is free? Positions: (4,3) is at (4,3), which is different from (6,3). So (6,3) is empty, no body there.\n> \n> Also, no wall.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (5,4): (5,4) not in snake positions? Snake has (5,5), (4,5), etc., but (5,4) not listed. (6,4) is head, (6,5) next, (5,5) is left and down? (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, (6,5) at x=6,y=5, so (5,5) is west of (6,5). (5,4) would be south of (5,5)? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), move L to (5,4). (5,4) not in positions list, so should be free.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (5,2), but (5,4) is different, so ok.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,1) and (2,3) are both at x=2, so left side.\n> \n> I need to go towards food but prioritize survival.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (4,1), which is near (2,1).\n> \n> But let's think about the path.\n> \n> First, if I move D to (6,3), then head at (6,3), direction now D? After moving, the direction changes.\n> \n> After moving, the head direction will be the direction I just moved.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (5,4), direction L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) with life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 40 to get it, since disappears after 5 turns including current? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 36, life span 5, it will be there for 5 more turns: turns 36,37,38,39,40, and gone on turn 41. So last chance to eat is turn 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) life span 8, so available until turn 43, last eat on turn 43.\n> \n> Since (2,1) expires sooner, I should try to eat that first if possible.\n> \n> But I need to see if I can reach it safely.\n> \n> Current head at (6,4), (2,1) is at left bottom.\n> \n> Path: from (6,4) to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n> \n> But head direction is D, so moving down or left might be good.\n> \n> Move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n> \n> If I move L to (5,4), then I'm at (5,4), direction L.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go L to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,4) is in the list, segment 9th? Positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,1) tail.\n> \n> So (4,4) is occupied by body segment at position 8.\n> \n> If I move to (4,4) from (5,4), that would be collision because (4,4) is occupied.\n> \n> But when I move, the snake moves: head moves to new cell, tail moves away if no food eaten.\n> \n> So if I move to a cell, if it's not food, the tail moves, so the cell that was tail is freed, but the body segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, if not food, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, and body segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by the next segment might be different.\n> \n> For example, if I move to (5,4) from (6,4), then new head at (5,4), the segment that was at (6,4) becomes body, and so on, up to tail at (4,1) which moves away? When head moves to new cell, if not food, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to empty cell, tail moves forward, so snake length same, body shifts.\n> \n> When head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,4), which is empty (no food there), so head to (5,4), then the body: the segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> The positions: after move, new head is at (5,4), and the previous head (6,4) becomes the neck, so the snake positions become: head (5,4), then (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5), etc., and the tail (4,1) is removed, so the new tail is (4,2)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n> \n> After moving left to (5,4): new head at (5,4), then the previous head (6,4) is now part of body, so the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,4), but (6,5) is occupied, so when head moves, all body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Standard: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So after moving head to (5,4), the new positions: head (5,4), then the first body segment is at the old head position (6,4), then the next body segment moves to the old position of the first body segment, which was (6,5), so now at (6,4), but the segment that was at (6,5) moves to where? The body segments: index 1 (old (6,5)) moves to index 0's old position, which is (6,4), but (6,4) is now occupied by the new neck? Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (6,4)\n> \n> Index 1: body (6,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (4,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Index 11: tail (4,1)\n> \n> After move to (5,4):\n> \n> New head at (5,4)\n> \n> Then, the body segments: the segment that was index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so to (6,4)\n> \n> The segment that was index 2 moves to where index 1 was, so to (6,5)\n> \n> The segment that was index 3 moves to where index 2 was, so to (5,5)\n> \n> And so on, up to the segment that was index 10 moves to where index 9 was, but index 9 was (4,3), so to (4,3)? Let's see:\n> \n> The new position for body segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i from 1 to 11.\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Body 1: old pos of head, (6,4)\n> \n> - Body 2: old pos of body 1, (6,5)\n> \n> - Body 3: old pos of body 2, (5,5)\n> \n> - Body 4: old pos of body 3, (4,5)\n> \n> - Body 5: old pos of body 4, (4,6)\n> \n> - Body 6: old pos of body 5, (3,6)\n> \n> - Body 7: old pos of body 6, (3,5)\n> \n> - Body 8: old pos of body 7, (3,4)\n> \n> - Body 9: old pos of body 8, (4,4)\n> \n> - Body 10: old pos of body 9, (4,3)\n> \n> - Body 11: old pos of body 10, (4,2)\n> \n> But body 11 is the tail, and old pos of body 10 was (4,2), so new tail at (4,2), and the old tail (4,1) is removed, so (4,1) is now free.\n> \n> Similarly, cells like (5,4) was free, now occupied.\n> \n> Now, for collision: when moving to (5,4), is it safe?

If you eat food, tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail cell and eats food, it might cause collision if the new tail is added and head is there, but in this case, if I move to (4,3), which is tail, and if I eat food there?

Confusion.\n> \n> The rule: when you move head to a food cell that is also the tail, and you eat it, then the snake grows, so a new segment is added, but the tail remains, so now head and tail are on the same cell? That would cause collision immediately.\n> \n> But in practice, the head moves to the cell, eats food, grows, so the tail doesn't move, but the cell where tail was now has both head and tail? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically, in snake: when you move, head goes to new cell.

That would be two segments on same cell, collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" It says \"newly grown tail\", but when you eat, you grow at the tail? No, when you eat, you add a segment at the tail end, so the tail segment stays, and a new segment is added behind? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, this is when the head is adjacent to the tail, not on the tail cell.\n> \n> For example, if head is next to tail, and the tail cell has food, if you move onto it to eat, then since you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but the head moves to the tail cell, so now head is where tail was, and the tail segment is still there for a moment, but then since you grow, a new segment is added at the tail? I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, or where the head was? No.\n> \n> In most implementations, when the head moves to a food cell, the head occupies that cell, and the tail does not advance, so the snake gains one segment. The new segment is effectively added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the length increases.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head is at new position (food cell), the body segments shift, but the tail segment remains in place, so the last body position is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Example: suppose positions: head at A, body B, tail at C.\n> \n> If head moves to D (no food), then new head D, body A, tail B (C removed).\n> \n> If head moves to D with food, new head D, body A, and tail C remains, so now positions D, A, B, C — length increased, tail at C.\n> \n> If D is the tail cell C, and you move to C with food, then head moves to C, eats food, so new head C, body A, tail C? But C is occupied by head and tail, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if head is adjacent to tail, say head at (1,1), tail at (1,2), and (1,2) has food. If head moves to (1,2) to eat, then new head (1,2), body includes (1,1), and tail remains (1,2), so head and tail both at (1,2), collision.\n> \n> Hence the danger.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), it is the tail, and there is no food there, so if I move to (4,3), no food, so tail moves away, no problem.\n> \n> Back to point.\n> \n> From (5,3) after turn 37, direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Left to (4,3): which is tail, no food, so safe.

No, current head is at (5,3), and it's moving left, so next position would be (4,3), but (4,3) is part of the body. Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (5,3) - head\n> \n> Index 1: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 7: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 8: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 9: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 10: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 11: (4,3) - tail? Positions are given as a list: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]\n> \n> So head is (5,3), tail is (4,3). And head direction is L, which is left, so from (5,3) moving left would be to (4,3), but (4,3) is the tail. In Snake, when the head moves to the tail's current position, it's okay because the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> But let's confirm the movement. Current head at (5,3), moving left to (4,3). At the same time, the tail will move from (4,3) to wherever the next segment is, but since it's the tail, it moves forward as the snake advances.\n> \n> After moving left, head goes to (4,3), which was the tail position. Then the new snake positions: head at (4,3), then the previous head becomes body: (5,3) is now part of body, followed by (6,3), etc., and the tail (4,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed unless food is eaten. Since no food is eaten yet, after moving, head to (4,3), then body segments shift: new position 0: (4,3) [head], position 1: (5,3) [was head], position 2: (6,3), position 3: (6,4), ..., up to position 10: (4,4), and tail was (4,3) but since head moved there, and no growth, tail should be removed, so the last position is discarded.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0 to 11: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n> \n> After moving left to (4,3): new head is (4,3), but (4,3) was the tail, so now new positions: head at (4,3), then the first body segment is the previous head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4). The tail (4,3) is now head, so we remove the last segment? When head moves to a cell, if it's not food, the tail is cut off.\n> \n> So new snake: head at (4,3), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), and (4,4) is the new tail? Original positions: 12 segments. After move, head moves to new position, so we add new head and remove tail.\n> \n> New head: (4,3)  // since moving left from (5,3) to (4,3)\n> \n> Then body segments: from index 0 to 10, but shifted: index 0 (old head) becomes body, so positions: [ (4,3) head, (5,3) body1, (6,3) body2, (6,4) body3, (6,5) body4, (5,5) body5, (4,5) body6, (4,6) body7, (3,6) body8, (3,5) body9, (3,4) body10, (4,4) body11? ]\n> \n> Original list has 12 positions: indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move, new head is (4,3), which was index 11, but we keep it as head now. The body is indices 0 to 10, but each shifts down: body becomes [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ] and tail is (4,4).\n> \n> But (4,4) was index 10, and index 11 was (4,3) which is now head. So new positions: head (4,3), then body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), and tail (4,4). That's 12 segments still? No: we added new head and removed old tail.\n> \n> Old tail was (4,3) at index 11. New head is (4,3), so we don't add a new segment, we just move head to (4,3), and the segment that was at index 11 is now the head, but in terms of positions, the list becomes: [ (4,3) ], then [ (5,3) from index 0, but index 0 was head, now it's body, so positions: new index 0: (4,3) head, index 1: (5,3) (was old head), index 2: (6,3) (was index 1), index 3: (6,4) (was index 2), ..., up to index 11: (4,4) (was index 10). But the old tail index 11 (4,3) is gone because head moved there, but since it's the same cell, we don't have duplicate.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier: the snake moves forward by adding the new head position and removing the tail position if no food eaten.\n> \n> So new head position: (4,3) (left from (5,3))\n> \n> Add to front: new positions: [(4,3)] + [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]  but this is 12 segments, and we need to remove the tail, which was (4,3) but (4,3) is now head, so the tail to remove is the last one, which is (4,4) in this case? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: let the current positions be P[0] to P[11] with P[0] = head, P[11] = tail.\n> \n> After moving to a new cell C:\n> \n> - If C is not food, new positions: [C] + P[0] to P[10]  // C is new head, P[0] to P[10] are the body, and P[11] is removed.\n> \n> In this case, C = (4,3), P[0] to P[10] are (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)  // P[0] to P[10] is 11 elements? P has 12 positions, indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> P[0] = (5,3), P[1] = (6,3), P[2] = (6,4), P[3] = (6,5), P[4] = (5,5), P[5] = (4,5), P[6] = (4,6), P[7] = (3,6), P[8] = (3,5), P[9] = (3,4), P[10] = (4,4), P[11] = (4,3)\n> \n> New head C = (4,3)  // since moving left to (4,3)\n> \n> But (4,3) is P[11], the tail.\n> \n> If C is not food, new positions: [C] + [P[0], P[1], ..., P[10]]  so new head C, then P[0] to P[10] as body, and P[11] is removed. But C is P[11], so new positions: [ (4,3) ] + [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]  so now we have head (4,3), then body (5,3), (6,3), etc., down to (4,4), which is 12 segments, but P[11] was removed, but C is added, so it should be 12 segments still? No, [C] + P[0] to P[10] is 12 elements, but P[0] to P[10] is 11 elements, plus C is 12, and P[11] is removed, so length remains the same.\n> \n> P[0] to P[10] are 11 positions: indices 0 to 10 inclusive is 11 items.\n> \n> P[0], P[1], ..., P[10] is 11 positions.\n> \n> Then new snake: [C] + [P[0], P[1], ..., P[10]] = 1 + 11 = 12 positions.\n> \n> But originally 12, so no change, which is correct since no food eaten.\n> \n> And the new tail is the last one, P[10] = (4,4).\n> \n> In this case, after moving left, head is at (4,3), and tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, back to the food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after 3 turns including current turn 38, so at turn 41 it will be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 38, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 40? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n> \n> If L=2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, here at turn 38, food at (2,1) has life_span 3, so it can be eaten on turns 38, 39, 40, and disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) life_span 6, so can be eaten from turn 38 to 43, disappears after 43.\n> \n> (5,4) life_span 9, turns 38 to 46.\n> \n> All food have value +1, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Now, the grid: walls at borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake head at (5,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> Allowed moves: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3):\n> \n> - L to (4,3): but (4,3) is the current tail, which is safe to move to because tail will move.\n> \n> - U to (5,4): what is at (5,4)? Looking at snake positions, (5,4) is not in the list. Current positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). So (5,4) is empty? Let's see y-coordinates: from 3 to 6, x from 3 to 6. (5,4) not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (5,2): but (5,2) is an internal obstacle?

        "thinking": "### Action Sequence (in order):\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n### Explanation for Immediate Action (Turn 40):\n\nThe immediate action chosen is **D (Down)** to (3,2). Here's why:\n\n1. **Avoiding Risk**: Moving left (L) to (2,3) would eat the food immediately, but this grows the snake and risks trapping it in the crowded center. Moving up (U) to (3,4) enters the snake's own body loop, which is less flexible for future moves. Moving down (D) to (3,2) is the safest option as it moves toward open space and avoids immediate collisions.\n\n2. **Food Timing**: The food at (2,3) has a life span of 4 (available until turn 43), so we can delay eating it. Moving down first allows us to reposition the snake to eat it later (e.g., on turn 42 via the sequence D → L → U).\n\n3. **Future Flexibility**: Moving down opens paths to the lower part of the grid, where fewer body segments are present. This creates more options for future moves and avoids dead ends.\n\n4. **Tail Reward Danger**: Currently, the tail is at (3,4), and the head is adjacent at (3,3). However, there is no food on the tail cell, so moving to (3,4) is safe but less optimal than moving down. \n\nThus, **D** is the best immediate action to balance survival and future opportunities. The full sequence (D → L → U) will safely eat (2,3) on turn 42 while minimizing risk.",

Let me check the rules.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food at (2,1), life span 1 at turn 40. That means after turn 40, it will be gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at the start of turn 40, life span is 1.

But internal is only (5,2).\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are. Obstacles are walls, so (5,2) is also a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So grid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6, with (5,2) blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (3,3), moving left. So from (3,3), possible moves: since direction is L, it can move L, U, D, but not R (because reverse not allowed). Current head direction is L, so cannot move right (opposite).\n> \n> Possible actions from (3,3):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,3)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,2)\n> \n> Cannot go right to (4,3) because that would be opposite direction, and (4,3) is also occupied by body, but since it's moving, the body will shift.\n> \n> Important: when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its position, so cells become free except where the head goes.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body except the tail, it dies. If it moves to tail, it's ok only if tail moves away, but in that case, no growth, so it's like moving to an empty cell.\n> \n> Also, for food under body: can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> But in this case, let's see where food is relative to snake.\n> \n> Food: (2,1), (2,3), (5,4), (6,6)\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> (3,4) is the tail? Positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) — so (3,4) is the last, tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,3): is it under snake? (2,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1), (5,4), (6,6) not in snake positions, so all food is on empty cells.\n> \n> (5,4): let's see, snake has (5,3), (5,5), but not (5,4), so empty.\n> \n> (6,6) not occupied.\n> \n> (2,1) and (2,3) not occupied.\n> \n> So no food under body.\n> \n> Now, (2,1) has life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> To eat (2,1) on this turn, from (3,3), I need to move to (2,1)? But (2,1) is at (2,1), current head (3,3), so to go to (2,1) directly? Not adjacent; adjacent cells are left (2,3), up (3,4), down (3,2).\n> \n> (2,1) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's two cells away. So impossible to eat (2,1) on this turn, turn 40.\n> \n> Because to eat food, head must move to the food cell.\n> \n> Since (2,1) is at distance 2, I can't reach it this turn. So (2,1) will disappear after this turn without being eaten.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 40: after turn 40, it disappears. Since I can't reach it on turn 40, it will be gone, no point in going for it.\n> \n> Now, other food: (2,3) is adjacent to head? Head at (3,3), (2,3) is left, directly adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is down, but no food there.\n> \n> (3,4) is up, no food, but (3,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,4) is the tail end.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,3), then ... tail (3,4). So (3,4) is occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> If I move up to (3,4), that is the tail, so it's possible, and since I move there, and tail moves away, no collision, but I don't eat food because no food there? (3,4) has no food; food is elsewhere.\n> \n> Moving to (3,4): since it's the tail, and I move there, the snake doesn't grow, because for growth, I need to eat food. If I move to an empty cell or tail, no growth; if to food, growth.\n> \n> Here, (3,4) is tail, so moving there: head moves to (3,4), tail moves away, so the cell (3,4) is now head, and the old tail is gone, so no collision, and length same.\n> \n> But in this case, no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3) direction L:\n> \n> - Left (L) to (2,3): there is food at (2,3), value 1, life span 4. So if I move there, I eat the food, snake grows to 13 segments.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (3,4): but (3,4) is the current tail. Moving to tail is ok, no growth.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (3,2): (3,2) should be empty? Let's see, is (3,2) occupied or wall?\n> \n> Grid: walls at borders and (5,2). (3,2): x=3, y=2, not border? Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=3 y=2 is within 1-6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=2, so (3,2) is playable. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), etc. No (3,2), so empty. So moving down to (3,2) is to empty cell, no food, no growth.\n> \n> Now, also, I need to think about future moves and risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving left to eat (2,3).\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), I eat the food, snake grows. New head at (2,3), direction now L? After moving, direction is set to the move direction.\n> \n> Then, the body: since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (2,3), then old head (3,3) becomes body, and so on, up to tail (3,4) still there? Let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (3,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (4,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> After move L to (2,3) and eat food: head moves to (2,3), and since food eaten, tail stays, so the body segments shift: new head (2,3), segment 1: old head (3,3), segment 2: (4,3), ..., segment 11: (3,5), and tail (3,4) remains? No.\n> \n> When snake grows, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added where the tail was? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail stays in place effectively, but since head moved, all segments shift except tail doesn't move? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically: head moves to new cell, if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows by one cell. If no food, head moves, tail moves to the next position, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,3) and eat food, then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - The previous head (3,3) becomes the new segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 1 (4,3) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to segment 11 (3,4) which was tail, but since we eat, we add a new segment at the current tail position, so the tail remains (3,4), and a new segment is added after the old tail? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions: after move, head is at new position, and the body from old head to one before tail move to their next position, and if food eaten, tail stays, so the snake extends; if not, tail moves off.\n> \n> So positions: let S[0] = head, S[1] to S[k] body, S[k] tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - New S[0] = C\n> \n> - New S[1] = old S[0]\n> \n> - New S[2] = old S[1]\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New S[k] = old S[k-1]\n> \n> If food eaten at C, then new S[k] = old S[k-1], and a new segment S[k+1] = old S[k] (tail position), so length increases by one, tail is now S[k+1].\n> \n> If no food, then new S[k] = old S[k-1], and old S[k] is removed, so tail moves to new S[k].\n> \n> In this case, current length 12 segments.\n> \n> If I move to (2,3) and eat, new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head (3,3)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 (5,3)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg5: old seg4 (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg6: old seg5 (6,5)\n> \n> - New seg7: old seg6 (5,5)\n> \n> - New seg8: old seg7 (4,5)\n> \n> - New seg9: old seg8 (4,6)\n> \n> - New seg10: old seg9 (3,6)\n> \n> - New seg11: old seg10 (3,5)\n> \n> - And since food eaten, new seg12: old tail (3,4)\n> \n> So tail is now at (3,4), same as before? New seg12 is (3,4), which was old tail, but now it's part of body, and the tail is new seg12, position (3,4).\n> \n> But (3,4) is still occupied, but it's the tail.\n> \n> Now, after this move, the direction is left.\n> \n> Now, from (2,3), what can I do?\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, if I don't go for (2,3), other options.\n> \n> (2,3) has life span 4, so it will be there for 4 turns including this one? Life span 4 at turn 40, so after 4 turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn 40, life span 4; after turn 40, life span 3; after turn 41, 2; etc., so it disappears after turn 43, I think. Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current). Disappears after N turns.\"\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and when L=0 after the turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,3), life span 4 at turn 40:\n> \n> - After turn 40, life span 3 (still present)\n> \n> - After turn 41, life span 2\n> \n> - After turn 42, life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 43, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 40,41,42,43.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life span 7, so available until turn 46.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 10, available until turn 49.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 1, disappears after turn 40, so only if eaten on turn 40, which is impossible.\n> \n> So forget (2,1).\n> \n> Now, back to turn 40 actions.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (2,3) - eat food, grow to 13.\n> \n> Then new head at (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> From (2,3), possible moves: since direction L, can move L, U, D, not R (right).\n> \n> L: to (1,3) - is that valid? x=1, y=3, not wall, should be empty. Snake positions after move: head (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), tail (3,4). So (1,3) not occupied, and not wall (x=1>0, y=3>0, x=1<7, y=3<7), and no obstacle, so empty.\n> \n> U: to (2,4) - is (2,4) empty? Not in snake positions, yes.\n> \n> D: to (2,2) - similarly, empty.\n> \n> But I need to consider the board.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the tail is at (3,4), etc.\n> \n> But let's think about risks.\n> \n> Another option: move U to (3,4). But (3,4) is the current tail. Moving to tail is ok, no collision, and no food there, so no growth.\n> \n> After move U to (3,4): since no food, head moves to (3,4), which was tail, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,4), then old head (3,3) becomes seg1, then (4,3) seg2, ..., up to old seg10 (3,5) becomes new seg11, and old tail (3,4) is gone, but head moved there, so it's occupied, and tail is now the last of the body.\n> \n> Current positions before move: S0=(3,3), S1=(4,3), S2=(5,3), S3=(6,3), S4=(6,4), S5=(6,5), S6=(5,5), S7=(4,5), S8=(4,6), S9=(3,6), S10=(3,5), S11=(3,4)\n> \n> After move U to (3,4): no food, so head to (3,4), which was S11.\n> \n> Then new S0 = (3,4)\n> \n> New S1 = old S0 = (3,3)\n> \n> New S2 = old S1 = (4,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New S10 = old S9 = (3,6)?

It's turn 41. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake positions are: head at (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (3,2) down would be to (3,1), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down might be risky if there's no space.\n> \n> Head direction is D, and it's at (3,2). Moving down would go to (3,1), but y=0 is a wall, so (3,1) might be invalid? Let's confirm the grid. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, it says border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning those coordinates are walls. So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. But (3,2) has y=2, which is between 1 and 6, I assume. The grid should be from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Similarly, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 is 6x6 grid, but (5,2) is an obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake head at (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,3) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,3) with life span 4 on turn 41, it will disappear after turn 41 + 3? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn 41, life span is 4, so after this turn, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then on turn 44 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 41,42,43,44? No.\n> \n> Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N on turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, life span 4 on turn 41: it is present on turns 41,42,43,44. On turn 45, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life span 6 on turn 41: present from 41 to 46.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 9: present from 41 to 49.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,2) - turn 41 head\n> \n> Then body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) - tail\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it was moving down to (3,2)? From previous position. Positions are given as list, with head first. So from (3,3) to (3,2) would be down? Let's see the positions: the snake was at (3,3) before moving to (3,2), I think. The positions are: [(3,2), (3,3), ...] so (3,2) is head, (3,3) is the first body segment. So the snake moved from (3,3) to (3,2), which is down, decreasing y. Yes, direction D.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,2): since direction is D, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up) because that would be opposite to current direction D. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so cannot move up immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: down to (3,1), but y=0 is wall, so (3,1) is invalid? y=0 is wall, so y=1 should be valid? Borders: y=0 is wall, so cells with y=0 are walls. y=1 is not border, it's inside. Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,1): x=3, y=1, y=1 is not 0 or 7, so it should be valid, unless it's an obstacle, but no obstacle at (3,1).\n> \n> Internal obstacles only (5,2), so (3,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) y=1, which is above y=0 wall, but y=1 is playable.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, y=1 to y=6 are playable, y=7 wall. Similarly for x.\n> \n> So from (3,2), moving down (D) to (3,1) is possible, as long as not wall or body.\n> \n> (3,1) is not wall, and not in snake body? Snake body positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). No (3,1), so (3,1) is free.\n> \n> Moving left (L) to (2,2): x=2,y=2, not wall, not body? Body has (3,3) etc, no (2,2), so free.\n> \n> Moving right (R) to (4,2): x=4,y=2, not wall, but internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2), so (4,2) should be free? Snake body: positions include (4,3), (5,3), etc., but (4,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Moving up (U) to (3,3): but (3,3) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision, since head touches body. Also, cannot move up because it's instant reverse? Current direction D, moving up U is opposite, so cannot due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: L (left to (2,2)), R (right to (4,2)), D (down to (3,1)). U is invalid because reverse and also body there.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available: (2,3) at (2,3) with life span 4, so can be eaten until turn 44.\n> \n> (5,4) at (5,4) life span 6, until turn 46.\n> \n> (6,6) at (6,6) life span 9, until turn 49.\n> \n> Snake length is 12, eating positive food increases length by 1.\n> \n> Also, special case: food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Currently, food at (2,3), (5,4), (6,6). None of these are under snake body? Let's see snake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). (2,3) is not in this list, so not under body. (5,4) not listed. (6,6) not listed. So all food are in free cells.\n> \n> (5,4): snake has (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,5), etc., but (5,4) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> Similarly others.\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. Tail is at (3,5). Head at (3,2), not adjacent to (3,5). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,2) and (3,5) are not adjacent; differ by 3 in y. Adjacent cells would be up, down, left, right. So head at (3,2) adjacent to (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). Tail at (3,5) adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5). (3,6) is part of body, (4,5) is body, etc. But head not near tail, so no issue now.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, from current position (3,2), possible moves: L to (2,2), R to (4,2), D to (3,1).\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), then I'm closer to (2,3) food.\n> \n> (2,3) is at (2,3), which is above (2,2), so to reach (2,3) from (2,2), I need to move up.\n> \n> But current head direction is D, and if I move L to (2,2), direction becomes L?

Life span decreases each turn, so if it has life span 3 at turn 42, after turn 42, it becomes 2, after turn 43, it becomes 1, after turn 44, it becomes 0 and disappears.

Food is at (2,3), but snake body: let's see positions. (2,3) is not in snake positions; snake has (2,2), (3,2), etc., but not (2,3). So (2,3) is empty except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): y=1, which is within bounds, not wall yet? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is ok, but is it occupied? Snake positions don't have (2,1), so should be free.\n> \n> (1,2): x=1, y=2, not wall, not occupied by snake?

When you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the head is on food, you add a new segment, so tail stays in place or something? Let's clarify snake movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position. If no food eaten, tail moves off its cell. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,3), which has food, I eat it, so head moves to (2,3), and a new segment is added, so the body extends; the tail remains, so snake length increases.\n> \n> Positions after eating: new head (2,3), then the previous head (2,2) becomes second segment, and so on, down to tail (3,6), but since we ate, we add a segment, so positions: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (3,6) ] and then a new segment where the tail was? No.\n> \n> Sequence: before move, positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (3,6)]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3) and eating food: new head at (2,3), and since food eaten, we don't remove the tail, so positions become: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., (3,6)] with the last segment still (3,6), but since we ate, we add a new segment at the end? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, the tail doesn't retract, so the snake grows by one cell. So after move, the new position list has one more element.\n> \n> Before move: 12 segments.\n> \n> After moving to food: head moves to new cell, food consumed, so the body segments follow: the first body segment moves to where head was, etc., and the tail doesn't move off, so the new tail is the old tail, and we have a new position for the added segment? No.\n> \n> Let's think: positions are a list. When head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head. The segment that was head becomes second, and so on, down to the tail. If no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed, so snake stays same length. If food eaten, the last segment is not removed, so snake grows, and the positions include the new head and all previous segments.\n> \n> For example, before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: new positions [new_H, H, B1, ..., Bk] where Bk was the second last, and T is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to new position, all segments shift: the new head is the new position, then the previous head position, then the first body position, and so on, up to the tail position if no growth. If growth, the tail position is kept, so the list gains one element.\n> \n> In this case, positions: index 0: head (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (4,5), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6)  // tail.\n> \n> If I move head to (2,3) and eat food, new positions: head at (2,3), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, then (3,2), (3,3), ..., up to (3,6), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, but where? When you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so the last position before tail becomes the new tail, and we keep the old tail as new segment? I think I have it.\n> \n> After eating: the head moves to new cell, and the tail stays in place, so the snake extends to include the new head position, and the tail position remains, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at the head, but the positions are: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] so now 13 segments, with tail at (3,6) still? (3,6) was tail, and we added a new head, so positions from head to tail: new head (2,3), then (2,2), then (3,2), ..., then (4,6), then (3,6) as the new tail? No.\n> \n> The tail was (3,6), index 11.

It's turn 43. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,3), and the body follows: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6). So the tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake head direction is U (up), which means it's moving upwards.

Also, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake head at (2,3), direction U. So possible moves from here: since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, which is not allowed. So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4)\n> \n> - L: to (1,3)\n> \n> - R: to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to check if these cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> First, (2,4): is it a wall? x=2 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so not border. Internal obstacle is (5,2), so (2,4) is free. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,3) head, (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6). (2,4) is not in this list, so it's empty. So U to (2,4) is possible.\n> \n> L to (1,3): x=1, y=3. Not border walls. Not obstacle (5,2). Not in snake positions, so empty. Possible.\n> \n> R to (3,3): (3,3) is part of snake body? Snake positions: ... (3,3) is the fourth segment? List: index 0: (2,3) head, index 1: (2,2), index 2: (3,2), index 3: (3,3), so (3,3) is the body segment. But can I move to (3,3)? It's occupied by the body, so moving there would cause collision? Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (3,6). (3,3) is in the middle. So moving to (3,3) would cause collision because the head touches a body segment that isn't the tail.\n> \n> Confirm: if I move to (3,3), the head is at (3,3), but that cell is currently occupied by the snake body, and since the tail is moving, but (3,3) is not the tail; it's a fixed position until the snake moves. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position. So if I move right to (3,3), but (3,3) is currently occupied by the body, so when head moves there, it would be on the same cell as the body before it moves, causing collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"head touches any body segment\" except that you can move to the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,3) is not the tail, so moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> So R to (3,3) is not possible; it's occupied.\n> \n> Now, what about U and L.\n> \n> U to (2,4): empty, as I thought.\n> \n> L to (1,3): empty, not occupied.\n> \n> Also, D is not possible because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible actions this turn: U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (5,4): life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn. Since turn t1=43, it will disappear after turn 43+4-1? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life_span L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life_span is L at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after L turns, it's gone. For example, if L=4 at turn 43, then:\n> \n> Turn 43: L=4\n> \n> Turn 44: L=3\n> \n> Turn 45: L=2\n> \n> Turn 46: L=1\n> \n> Turn 47: L=0, disappears? Or at turn 47 it's gone? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t with L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's see the description.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So if countdown starts at N, after one turn it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So when countdown is 1, it is present for that turn, and after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (5,4), life_span=4 at turn 43. So:\n> \n> Turn 43: present, countdown=4\n> \n> Turn 44: present, countdown=3\n> \n> Turn 45: present, countdown=2\n> \n> Turn 46: present, countdown=1\n> \n> Turn 47: not present (after turn 46, countdown 0)\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): life_span=7 at turn 43\n> \n> Present until turn 43+7-1=49? Turn 43: L=7, turn 44: L=6, ..., turn 49: L=1, turn 50: gone. So disappears after turn 49.\n> \n> Turn t with L, it is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 43: L=7, so available turns: 43,44,45,46,47,48,49. Gone at turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): L=10, available from turn 43 to 43+10-1=52. Turn 52: L=1, gone at turn 53.\n> \n> But we need to plan for 5+ turns, so up to turn 48 or so.\n> \n> Now, snake current positions: head (2,3), tail (3,6).

So new snake: [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] and tail is (4,5), but length is 13, no growth because no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, if I move to a food cell, say later to (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) has food, so if head moves to (5,4), it eats, so the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> In the move sequence, when head moves to a cell with food, it consumes it, and the snake grows, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is at the old tail position.\n> \n> Positions: before move, snake: say [positions]\n> \n> Move head to new cell; if it has food, then the body moves except the tail stays, so new head position, then old head, then rest of body, and tail stays, so the new tail is the old tail, and length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, if head at (4,4) and moves to (5,4) which has food.\n> \n> Before move: head at (4,4), body ..., tail at some cell.\n> \n> After move: head at (5,4), then old head (4,4) becomes body, and the body shifts, but tail does not move, so the segment before tail becomes the new second last, and tail stays, so new positions include the old tail as well, with head at (5,4), then the previous segments, and tail unchanged.\n> \n> Let's not get bogged down.\n> \n> Back to the situation.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is risky because it's surrounded by snake segments.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4), from say (4,4), then head at (5,4), food eaten, so snake grows. New head at (5,4), body includes (4,4), and the previous body, and tail at (4,6) or wherever.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake is longer, and (5,4) is now head, and its neighbors: U (5,5) is occupied by body (since (5,5) was segment 10), D (5,3) is body segment 6, R (6,4) is body segment 8, only L (4,4) is now body, but (4,4) is the new neck, so not a problem, but for movement, from (5,4), I can only move to (4,4) which is now part of the body? No.\n> \n> After the move, the head is at (5,4), and the previous position of head is now the first body segment, which is (4,4) in this case.\n> \n> So from head at (5,4), the adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (5,5) is occupied by the body segment that was (5,5), which is still there.\n> \n> - D: (5,3) occupied\n> \n> - R: (6,4) occupied\n> \n> - L: (4,4) which is the first body segment, so occupied and cannot move there.\n> \n> So all four directions are blocked! If I move to (5,4) from the left, after eating, I am trapped with no way to move, and on the next turn, I die because I have to move but all adjacent cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> That's a problem.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,4) would lead to immediate death on the next turn.\n> \n> Because after eating, the head is at (5,4), surrounded by body on U, D, R, and L is the neck, so no free cell to move to.\n> \n> Therefore, I should avoid eating (5,4) directly from the left, or in this position.\n> \n> But is there a way to eat it safely? For example, if I approach from another direction, but (5,4) only has left free, other sides are snake or walls? R is (6,4) snake, U (5,5) snake, D (5,3) snake, only L (4,4) is free, so I must come from left to eat it.\n> \n> And after eating, I'm stuck.\n> \n> Therefore, eating (5,4) is dangerous and should be avoided because it leads to collision on next turn.\n> \n> There's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But here, it's not about tail; it's about the position being surrounded.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,4), the tail is at (4,6), which is not adjacent to head; head is at (2,4), far away.\n> \n> But after moving to (5,4), tail is at (4,6), which is not adjacent to (5,4); (5,4) to (4,6) is not adjacent, distance is sqrt(2), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing side, so (4,6) is not adjacent to (5,4); neighbors are (4,4), (6,4), (5,5), (5,3), all of which except (4,4) are occupied by body.\n> \n> So the issue is not tail reward danger, but general collision because all exits are blocked.\n> \n> Therefore, I should not go for (5,4) because it's a trap.\n> \n> Moreover, it has short life, but since it's dangerous, better to avoid.\n> \n> Now, other food: (3,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is free.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), I can go up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), for example.\n> \n> (2,5) is free, (3,5) is food.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,5), then from there to (3,5) by R.\n> \n> But let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 44, head at (2,4), direction U.\n> \n> I can choose action for turn 44.\n> \n> Options: U, L, R (since D invalid).\n> \n> If I go U to (2,5): then new head position (2,5), no food, so tail moves: old tail (4,6) removed, new positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — and (4,6) gone, so tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Length 12 now? No, initial 13 segments, after move with no food, length decreases? No, in snake, when no food, head moves to new cell, tail cell is left, so length remains same, but tail moves.\n> \n> Initial length 13, after move to empty cell, head moves, tail moves, so length still 13, but positions shift.\n> \n> In this case, from [ (2,4), (2,3), ..., (4,6) ] move U to (2,5): new head (2,5), then body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — and (4,6) is removed, so the last segment is (4,5), which was previously second last. So new snake: positions 0: (2,5), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, from (2,5), I can move to (3,5) by R, since (3,5) is food.\n> \n> (3,5) is food, so moving to (3,5) eats it.\n> \n> After move: head at (3,5), food eaten, so tail does not move; instead, the tail stays, and new segment added.\n> \n> Before move: head at (2,5), body as above.\n> \n> Move R to (3,5): new head (3,5), then old head (2,5) becomes body, and the body shifts, but tail (4,5) stays, so new positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5) but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so (4,5) remains, and a new segment is added? When food eaten, the snake grows, so the tail position is kept, meaning that the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, it's like the tail is extended.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, the head moves to food, the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, then the previous body segments, and the previous tail remains as the new tail.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (3,5): positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> After moving to (3,5) and eating: head at (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), and (4,5) as tail.

It's turn 45. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) being bottom-left, I assume? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, but since y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might mean y increases upwards, but in the snake positions, let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). Head direction is U, which is up, so (x,y+1) means y increases as we go up? From (2,5) to (2,4) is down, since y decreased? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), direction U. If U is (x,y+1), that means moving up increases y. But in the positions, from head (2,5) to next (2,4), which is decreasing y, so the head is moving down? Direction is given as U, but positions show y decreasing from head to body. Head (2,5), then (2,4), so body is at lower y, meaning head is above body, so direction U (up) would be away from body. Let's list positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (2,5) head\n> \n> Index 1: (2,4)\n> \n> Index 2: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 5: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 7: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 8: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 9: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 10: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 11: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 12: (4,5)\n> \n> So the snake is moving: from head (2,5) down to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), then right to (3,2), up to (3,3), right to (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), up to (6,4), (6,5), then left to (5,5), (4,5). Head direction is U, meaning it was moving up last turn, so from where? Before (2,5), it must have come from below, but positions start at (2,5), so the previous move was into (2,5) with direction U, meaning it came from (2,4)? But (2,4) is the next segment. Since head is at (2,5) and direction U, it means the head moved up to (2,5) from (2,4) on the previous turn? But in the list, (2,4) is segment 1, so yes, the snake moved from (2,4) to (2,5) with direction U.\n> \n> But (2,4) to (2,5) is +y, so y increases upwards. Then from (2,5), with direction U, possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse, so cannot go D (down) because that would be opposite to U. Current head direction is U, so next move cannot be D.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life_span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life_span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,5) with life_span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2)\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) probably bottom-left, but since y increases up, (0,0) is bottom-left, (0,7) top-left, etc. In positions, (2,5) to (2,2) y decreasing, so lower y is down.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 45.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

Life_span decreases every turn, including current. Turn 45, life_span 2, so after turn 45, it becomes 1; after turn 46, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 45 or 46.\n> \n> Life_span: at turn t, if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be there for N more turns? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

(1,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3,y=5, not wall, and food is there, but is it occupied? Snake has (3,3), (4,3), etc., not (3,5). Food is at (3,5), which is not snake position, so it's free, but has food.\n> \n> (3,5) is a food position, not occupied by snake, so moving there would eat the food.\n> \n> But we need to check if it's safe to move to (3,5).\n> \n> Moving to (3,5): head moves to (3,5), which has food, so we eat it, length increases by 1.

Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to food cell, it eats it, length increases, and the body moves, but since length increases, the tail doesn't move; it stays, so a new segment is added at the head position.\n> \n> But for collision, we need to see if the new head position causes collision.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, tail is at (4,5), and food is at (3,5), which is adjacent?

The head direction is R, which is right. So, the snake is moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1 and life span 1. That means it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since life span decreases every turn including current, and it's life span 1 now, after turn 46, if not eaten, it will be gone. Life span 1 means it has only this turn to be eaten; after that, it vanishes.\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 4. So, it will last for 4 more turns, including this one.\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 10. But (5,5) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (5,5) is the 12th segment in the list, indices starting from head: position 0: (3,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), ..., 12: (5,5), and 13: (4,5). So (5,5) is part of the body.\n> \n> Now, for food under the body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (5,5), since it's under the snake, it might be possible to eat later if the snake moves and exposes that cell.\n> \n> But the food at (5,5) has value 1 and life span 10, so it has plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (3,5), moving right. From (3,5), moving right would go to (4,5), but (4,5) is the tail end? Snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), ..., up to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So positions are listed from head to tail.

Previous head position: since direction is R, and positions: head at (3,5), previous was (2,5), which is left of (3,5), so yes, it moved right to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5): U (up, to (3,6)), D (down, to (3,4)), L (left, to (2,5)), R (right, to (4,5)).\n> \n> But L (left) is opposite to current direction R, so I cannot move left because of no instant reverse.

(3,6): y=6, which is less than 7? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is ok, but y=7 is the border, so y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so valid y are 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.

No.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when the head moves to a food cell, the snake grows by one segment. The head moves to the new cell, and the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail stays in place for that turn.\n> \n> After the move, the head is at the food cell, the body segments follow from the previous head position, and the tail remains where it was, so the snake is one segment longer.\n> \n> For example, in this case: after moving to (5,5) and eating, new snake: head at (5,5), then the first body segment is the old head position (4,5), then the next is old seg1 (3,5), and so on, up to old seg12 (6,5), and then the old tail (5,5) is not included because it's now the head, but since we grow, we keep the old tail as the new tail.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (5,5), which was old tail.\n> \n> Then the body: old head (4,5) is now first body segment.\n> \n> Old seg1 (3,5) is now second body segment.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Old seg12 (6,5) is now the 13th body segment? Let's count.\n> \n> Old positions had 14 segments.\n> \n> After move and growth: head at new position (5,5)\n> \n> Then the old positions from 0 to 13 are all kept, but shifted: new segment 1: old pos0 (4,5)\n> \n> New segment 2: old pos1 (3,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 14: old pos13 (5,5) but old pos13 is (5,5), which is where head is, so we don't have duplicate.\n> \n> The new body consists of all old positions except that the head moved.\n> \n> So new positions: new head at (5,5), then new segment 1: old head (4,5), new segment 2: old segment 1 (3,5), new segment 3: old segment 2 (2,5), new segment 4: old segment 3 (2,4), ..., new segment 13: old segment 12 (6,5), and then since growth, new segment 14: the position where the tail was, which is old segment 13 (5,5), but that's occupied by head, so it's not added separately.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the head moves to a new cell with food, the head occupies the new cell, and the body consists of the old head position followed by all old body positions up to the tail, and the tail does not move, so the snake has the old tail position as the new last body segment, and since no removal, it grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: the new position list is: [new head position] + [old head position, old body positions in order]\n> \n> So in this case: new head at (5,5)\n> \n> Then + old positions: old head (4,5), old seg1 (3,5), old seg2 (2,5), old seg3 (2,4), old seg4 (2,3), old seg5 (2,2), old seg6 (3,2), old seg7 (3,3), old seg8 (4,3), old seg9 (5,3), old seg10 (6,3), old seg11 (6,4), old seg12 (6,5), old seg13 (5,5) — but old seg13 is (5,5), which is new head, so we don't list it twice.\n> \n> The body segments are the old positions from 0 to 12, but old position 0 is the old head, which becomes the first body segment, and old position 13 is the old tail, which is not included if the head moved there.\n> \n> After growth, the new snake has the new head position, then the entire old snake positions from head to tail, but since the head moved to the tail position, it's a bit special.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that when moving to a food cell, the tail doesn't move, so the position that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there, but the head is at the new position.\n> \n> Let's use coordinates.\n> \n> Before move: positions: H: (4,5), B1: (3,5), B2: (2,5), B3: (2,4), B4: (2,3), B5: (2,2), B6: (3,2), B7: (3,3), B8: (4,3), B9: (5,3), B10: (6,3), B11: (6,4), B12: (6,5), T: (5,5)\n> \n> Move head to T position (5,5), eat food.\n> \n> New head at (5,5)\n> \n> Then the body: the old head (4,5) becomes new B1\n> \n> Old B1 (3,5) becomes new B2\n> \n> Old B2 (2,5) becomes new B3\n> \n> ...\n> Old B12 (6,5) becomes new B13\n> \n> And the old tail T (5,5) is now the head, so we don't have a separate segment for it.\n> \n> But since we ate food, we grow, so we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at (5,5), which is now head, so we add a new segment at (5,5), but it's occupied, so that doesn't work.\n> \n> I think the correct way is: when you eat food, the tail stays in place for this move, so the new tail is the old tail position, and the head moves to the new position, with the body following.\n> \n> In this case, new head at (5,5), new B1 at old head (4,5), new B2 at old B1 (3,5), ..., new B13 at old B12 (6,5), and new tail at old tail (5,5) — but (5,5) is where head is, so collision.\n> \n> This is the \"Tail Reward Danger\" situation.\n> \n> Rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, before the move, head is at (4,5), tail is at (5,5), which is adjacent, since (4,5)

Since ate, the tail does not move; it stays at (5,5)? But (5,5) is now head, so the body: the previous head (4,5) becomes segment 1, then S1 (3,5) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to S12 (6,5) becomes segment 13, and S13 (5,5) was tail, but now since head moved there and ate, the tail position remains, but S13 was at (5,5), which is now occupied by head, so the tail should be the last segment, which is S12 (6,5) becomes the new tail? Let's think.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the segments: the head moves to the new position, and the body follows, but the tail stays in place, meaning that the last segment is not removed, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Positions after move and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)  // moved to\n> \n> - Then the previous segments: S0 (4,5) is now first body segment\n> \n> - S1 (3,5) second body\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Up to S12 (6,5) is now the 13th body segment\n> \n> - And since ate, no tail movement, so the tail was S13 at (5,5), but (5,5) is now head, so S13 position is gone? I think I have it.\n> \n> Better to think: after move to food cell, the head is at the food cell, and all body segments move to the next position, but the tail does not leave its position; instead, it stays, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> Initial positions: [P0, P1, P2, ..., P13] with P0 head, P13 tail.\n> \n> Move to new head position, say N.\n> \n> If N has food, then after move, new positions: [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P13]  // so the tail P13 is still there, and N is head, P0 to P13 are body, with P13 now second last, and the last segment is P13, but P13 is a position, it's the same cell.\n> \n> In this case, N = (5,5), P0 = (4,5), P1 = (3,5), ..., P13 = (5,5).\n> \n> But P13 is (5,5), and N is also (5,5), so [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n> \n> But (5,5) appears twice: as head and as last segment. That can't be; it's the same cell occupied twice, which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When the head moves to a cell that was the tail, and it has food, the tail doesn't move, so the new positions are: the head is at the new position, and the body includes all previous positions, so the tail cell is now part of the body, and since the snake grows, the tail is the old tail position, but it's occupied by the new head.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,5) which was tail, so P13 = (5,5).\n> \n> After moving head to N = (5,5), which is P13.\n> \n> New positions: [N] + [P0, P1, P2, ..., P12]  // because P13 is now the head position, so we don't add it again; the body starts from P0 to P12, and since ate, we add a new segment at the end, but where?\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the new cell, the body segments shift, but the tail is not removed, so the new tail is the old tail position only if it wasn't moved, but in this case, since head moved to tail position, it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the tail position is fixed when eating.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So in this case, head at (4,5) is adjacent to tail at (5,5), and tail cell has food, so if I eat it, it will kill the snake.\n> \n> Because after eating, the head is at (5,5), and the snake grows, so the tail remains at (5,5) for that turn?

It's turn 50. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and one block at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,6), and the body segments follow. The direction is R (right), meaning it just moved right to (6,6) from (5,6), I think. Let's list the positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)].

Is that right?\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when you move, the tail moves away. But when you move into a cell, if it's occupied by a body part that isn't the tail, it's a collision.\n> \n> Specifically, from the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, in this case, from (6,6), moving L to (5,6): (5,6) is occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (6,4). So (5,6) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U to (6,7): y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,6): x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving D to (6,5): is (6,5) occupied?

No.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so it cannot move L (left) immediately.

Let's think about how the snake moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> But for collision, after the move, if the head is on a cell with any body segment, it collides, except that if it's the tail, it might be okay if the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,5): after move, head is at (6,5), the previous head (6,6) becomes part of body, so the body segments are: (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), etc. down to (6,4) which was tail, but now (6,4) will be the new tail or something?

Then the snake grows, so the new tail won't move immediately; when I eat, on the next move, the tail stays in place, so length increases.\n> \n> Rule: when you eat, length increases, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move for that turn, I think. Standard snake rules.\n> \n> From the description: when eating positive food, length +1, so after eating, when the snake moves, the tail doesn't advance, so a new segment is added.\n> \n> Similarly for negative, length unchanged.\n> \n> But here, food is positive, so if I eat at (5,5), on turn 51, head moves to (5,5), eats food, so the body doesn't move, tail stays, so new head position is (5,5), and the previous head (6,5) becomes new body segment, so snake becomes: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), etc., and tail still (6,3) or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n> \n> After moving left to (5,5): head moves to (5,5), which is food, so eat it. Therefore, the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added.

No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the head is on food, and the tail remains in place for this turn, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions after eating: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — and since we ate, the tail (6,3) doesn't move, so it stays, and we have 16 segments now? Let's count.\n> \n> Original positions: 15 segments. After move: head moves to (5,5), so the new head is (5,5), and the body starts from (6,5) which was head, then (6,6), ..., up to (6,3).

That's 15 positions, but tail was (6,3), which is not there; (6,3) was removed, and (5,3) is now the tail. Original tail was (6,3), after move, (6,3) is removed, and the new tail is the second last, which is (5,3).

The segment at position (6,5) is the third segment from head? After turn 52, positions: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (5,5), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,6), etc.\n> \n> So (6,5) is index 2.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So when head moves to a new cell, segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, and so on, tail is removed.\n> \n> So for (6,5) to be vacated, the segment that is there must move to another position, and no new segment comes to (6,5) immediately, which is usually the case unless we double back, but in general, when the snake moves, the cell where the tail was is vacated, and other cells may be occupied or vacated depending on movement.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell (6,5) will be free when the segment that was there moves away and the new position is not filled by another segment.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one cell at a time, when a segment moves from a cell, that cell is vacated unless the head or another segment moves there immediately, but in normal movement, only the head moves to a new cell, so the cells where body segments were are vacated as they move, except for the head new position.\n> \n> In one move, the head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated (if no food), and intermediate cells may change, but only the tail cell is guaranteed to be vacated, other body cells are occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> For example, when head moves from A to B, segment 1 moves to A, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, etc., so the cell where segment 2 was is now occupied by segment 3 or something? Let's say positions: before move, head at H, S1 at P1, S2 at P2, ..., tail at T.\n> \n> After move head to new, S1 moves to H, S2 moves to P1, S3 moves to P2, ..., tail moves to second last position, and T is vacated.\n> \n> So the cell P2, where S2 was, is now occupied by S3 after move. So it is not vacated; it's still occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> The only cell that is vacated is the tail cell T.\n> \n> Other cells remain occupied unless the segment that was there was the tail.\n> \n> To vacate a particular cell like (6,5), it needs to be the tail position at some point, so that when we move, it is vacated.\n> \n> (6,5) is currently occupied by a body segment that is not tail, so it will take many moves for it to become the tail, as the tail moves slowly.\n> \n> The distance from head to that segment: index 2, so it will become tail after 14 moves or something, since there are 16 segments, index 2 will be tail when we have moved 14 times, but each move the tail advances, so the segment that was index 2 will be index 1 after one move, then index 0? Indices shift.\n> \n> After each move, the indices change; the old segment 1 becomes new segment 0? No, after move, head is new, then old head becomes new segment 1, old segment 1 becomes new segment 2, etc.\n> \n> So for a segment at position i, after k moves, it becomes the segment at position i-k if i-k >0, or removed if i-k <=0.\n> \n> The cell (6,5) is occupied by segment 2. After one move, this segment moves to the position of old segment 1, which is (5,5), so (6,5) is now occupied by the segment that was at (6,6), old segment 3, which moves to (6,5).\n> \n> After move, the cell (6,5) is occupied by new segment 2, which came from old segment 3 at (6,6).\n> \n> So (6,5) remains occupied unless the segment there is the tail and we move.\n> \n> To free (6,5), it needs to be the tail position when we move.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,3), which is far.\n> \n> The tail will move towards the head over time.\n> \n> But to make (6,5) the tail, it will take many moves, and the food at (6,5) has life span 9 at turn 53, so it might disappear before then.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2), it's free, so I can eat it if I go there.\n> \n> But (6,2) is at bottom right, and there is a wall at (5,2), so I need to be careful.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Perhaps I should aim for (6,2) first, since it has shorter life span.\n> \n> Life span 6 at turn 53, so I have until turn 58 to eat it.\n> \n> Turn 53 to 58, 6 turns to reach it.\n> \n> Now, from current position at turn 53, head at (5,4), I can move to (6,4) or (4,4) or (5,3).\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), head at (5,3), which is close to tail, but tail will move.\n> \n> Then from (5,3), I can move down to (5,2), but (5,2) is wall!

Let's list all snake positions to see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> So (6,2) is not in this list, and it's not a wall except the obstacle at (5,2), so (6,2) should be free, but has food.\n> \n> (6,5) is occupied by snake body at index 2, and also has food. So food can be under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (6,5), since it's occupied, the head cannot move there directly to eat; the body must move away first.\n> \n> Similarly, for any food under body, it's not immediately accessible.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (5,4) direction D.\n> \n> Possible actions: L, R, D (since U not allowed).\n> \n> - Move Left (L): to (4,4). Is (4,4) safe? Let's see what is at (4,4).\n> \n> From snake positions, (4,4) is not listed, so it should be empty. Also, walls: x=0 to 7 borders, but (4,4) is within, and no internal wall at (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n> \n> - Move Right (R): to (6,4). (6,4) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> - Move Down (D): to (5,3). (5,3) is the current tail position. But tail will move if no food eaten. Since no food at (5,3), moving to (5,3) should be safe because when head moves to (5,3), the tail will move from (5,3) to the next position, so no collision. But let's confirm the snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away. So moving to the current tail position is safe as long as it's not occupied by other body parts, which it isn't, since it's only the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is tail, so moving to (5,3) is fine; head and tail will swap, effectively, and snake moves forward.\n> \n> If there were food at (5,3), eating it would keep tail there, but no food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is currently occupied by snake body at index 2, so cannot eat it now. It has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (6,2) has life span 6, so it will disappear in 6 turns.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) is at row 2, column 6.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,4), and we want to eat (6,2) before it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is closer but occupied.\n> \n> I should plan a path to eat (6,2) safely.\n> \n> But I need to consider the whole sequence.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid 8x8: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (5,4), down to (5,3)? No, positions: head (5,4), then (5,5) above, since y increases up? Direction: head direction is D, down, so y decreases when moving down? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but from the positions, let's see: head at (5,4), moving down to? Direction D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y.\n> \n> In the positions, from head (5,4) to next (5,5), which has higher y, so y=5 is above y=4? That means y increases as we go up, so (5,5) is north of (5,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is east of (5,5), etc.\n> \n> So let's define: x from left to right, y from bottom to top? No, in the position list, head (5,4), then (5,5) which is same x, higher y, so (5,5) is north, so y increases northward.\n> \n> Then (6,5) is east, (6,6) north-east, etc.\n> \n> But direction D is down, (x,y-1), so decreasing y, southward.\n> \n> Similarly, U is (x,y+1), north.\n> \n> L is (x-1,y), west.\n> \n> R is (x+1,y), east.\n> \n> Food: (6,2) at x=6,y=2, which is east and south from head? Head at (5,4), so (6,2) is east 1, south 2? y=2 vs y=4, so south, since y decreases south.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) at x=6,y=5, which is east and north from head? Head (5,4), (6,5) is x+1, y+1, so north-east.\n> \n> But (6,5) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,2), I need to move head to (6,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,2) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, since snake has (2,2) and (3,2), but not (6,2). (2,2) is at left, (3,2) at x=3,y=2, (6,2) at x=6,y=2, so different.\n> \n> And (5,2) is wall, so (6,2) is accessible, but I need to go there.\n> \n> Life span 6, so I have until turn 58 to eat it (since turn 53: life 6, after turn 53, life 5 at turn 54, ..., at turn 58 life 1, eaten or disappears after that? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so if not eaten by turn when life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at the start of turn t+L, it might be gone? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 53, life span is 6. After turn 53, countdown decreases to 5 at turn 54, ..., to 0 at turn 59. When it reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0, so up to turn 58, since at turn 58, countdown is 1, eaten, or at turn 59 countdown 0, disappears before eating.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> For (6,2): life span 6 at turn 53, so can be eaten on turns 53 to 58 inclusive. Disappears at turn 59.\n> \n> For (6,5): life span 9 at turn 53, can be eaten turns 53 to 61, disappears turn 62.\n> \n> But (6,5) is occupied, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves at turn 53.\n> \n> From (5,4), options: L to (4,4), R to (6,4), D to (5,3).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,3), what happens? Head moves to (5,3), which is current tail. Since no food eaten, tail moves away. Current tail is at (5,3), after move, head at (5,3), and the segment that was at (5,3) moves to where? The snake body: the tail was at index 15 (5,3), after move, it will be removed, and new head at (5,3), so the new tail is whatever was at index 14, (4,3)? Let's see the new positions.\n> \n> After move D: head was (5,4) to (5,3). Then each segment moves: the old position 1 (5,5) moves to (5,4), position 2 (6,5) moves to (5,5)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So positions: let S[0] = head, S[1] to S[15] body.\n> \n> After move, new head is at new position, then S[0] new, S[1] = old S[0], S[2] = old S[1], ..., S[15] = old S[14], and old S[15] is left, so tail removed if no growth.\n> \n> In this case, move to (5,3), new head at (5,3). Then new S[1] = old S[0] = (5,4), new S[2] = old S[1] = (5,5), and so on, up to new S[15] = old S[14] = (4,3)? Old S[14] is (4,3), so new tail at (4,3), and old tail (5,3) is now head.\n> \n> No issue.\n> \n> Now, after this move, the snake head is at (5,3), direction down.\n> \n> But (5,3) is where tail was, and now it's head.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is south-east from here? (5,3) to (6,2) is east and down? x+1, y-1.\n> \n> Similarly, from (5,4), moving R to (6,4) would be better to approach (6,2) or (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) has food but occupied.\n> \n> I need to free (6,5) to eat the food there.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, 16 segments, it might take time to move the body away from (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is occupied by S[2], which is the third segment.\n> \n> To free (6,5), the snake needs to move so that S[2] moves away, and then head can come back.\n> \n> But it might take several turns.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2), it's free, but I need to go there.\n> \n> Let's find a path to (6,2) from current position.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), (6,2) at (6,2).\n> \n> Possible moves: directly, but not adjacent.\n> \n> From (5,4), to (6,2) I need to move east and south.\n> \n> But I can move R to (6,4), then from there, I can move D to (6,3), then D to (6,2), but (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (6,3) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is free.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake body changes.\n> \n> I need to simulate the moves.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,5), which is occupied, but if I move away, it might be freed later.\n> \n> But (6,5) has longer life, 9 turns, while (6,2) has only 6, so I should prioritize eating (6,2) first if possible.\n> \n> Moreover, (6,2) is closer in terms of turns available.\n> \n> Distance: from (5,4) to (6,2), it's |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so Manhattan distance 3, so I can reach it in 3 moves if path clear.\n> \n> For example: turn 53: move R to (6,4)\n> \n> Then turn 54: move D to (6,3)\n> \n> Then turn 55: move D to (6,2) and eat, if food still there.\n> \n> But at turn 55, life span of (6,2) is 6 - (55-53) = 6 - 2 = 4?

After moving R at turn 53, head direction is R (east), so at turn 54, I can move D, L, R, but not L (west) because that would be opposite to R?

Let's count the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions list has 16 segments: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> So head at (6,4), tail at (4,3). Length is 16.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life_span=5, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life_span=8, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> (6,5) is also a food position? But (6,5) is occupied by the snake's body segment. Let's see: snake has (6,5) as the 4th segment? Positions: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6), etc.\n> \n> So (6,5) is occupied by the snake body. Food at (6,5) is listed, but it's under the snake's body.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is free, I think.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid from (1,1) to (6,6):\n> \n> - Walls: borders are walls, so cells outside (1,1) to (6,6) are invalid. Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (6,4) facing right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move R (right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L. So options: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - Food at (6,2): value=1, life_span=5. This means it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span=5 on turn 54, it will disappear after turn 58? Let's see: on turn 54, life_span=5; after turn 54, it becomes 4; after turn 55, it becomes 3; ... after turn 58, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 58 inclusive? When life_span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of the turn or beginning? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" – probably after N turns from now, meaning after turn 54 + N -1 or something. Let's interpret.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is L on turn T, it decreases to L-1 after the turn, and disappears when it reaches 0. So for (6,2), life_span=5 on turn 54:\n> \n> - After turn 54, life_span becomes 4\n> \n> - After turn 55, becomes 3\n> \n> - After turn 56, becomes 2\n> \n> - After turn 57, becomes 1\n> \n> - After turn 58, becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 54 to 58.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) has life_span=8, so it will be around for longer.\n> \n> But (6,5) is currently occupied by the snake body. Specifically, it's the position of segment 3: (6,5).\n> \n> Rule for food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> So for (6,5), since it's under the body, I need to move the snake such that the segment at (6,5) moves away, and then later the head can move to (6,5) to eat it.\n> \n> But (6,5) is not the tail; it's in the middle. The tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 54.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), direction R. Can move: U (to (6,5)? y+1 is up, so U: (x,y+1) = (6,5)\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) = (6,3)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) = (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> L: but cannot, instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,5)\n> \n> - D: to (6,3)\n> \n> R to (7,4) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Now, (6,5) is occupied by the snake body segment. If I move U to (6,5), that would be moving into a body segment, which is collision? But rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (6,5) is not the tail; tail is at (4,3). (6,5) is segment 3, which is not tail. So if I move to (6,5), head would be at (6,5), but that cell is occupied by segment 3, so collision occurs immediately, since head touches body segment before the tail moves or something.\n> \n> The rule: \"head touches any body segment\" is collision, except when it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But for non-tail segments, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, if I move U to (6,5), which is currently occupied by segment 3, it should be a collision because the head is moving to a cell that will be empty only if the segment moves, but at the time of movement, the head moves first or simultaneously?\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when you move, the head moves to new position, and if that position is occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail is about to move.\n> \n> But here, (6,5) is not the tail; it's a middle segment. So moving to (6,5) should cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,5) is under the body, so it can't be eaten directly.\n> \n> Therefore, moving U to (6,5) is invalid because it would cause collision.\n> \n> Confirm with the rules.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (6,5), it's a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Thus, for turn 54, moving U to (6,5) is not possible; it's deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (6,3) might be possible, but let's see what's there.\n> \n> (6,3): is it occupied? Snake positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), etc. No (6,3), so it should be empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=6, y=3 is within 1 to 6, no wall there. Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (6,3).\n> \n> So (6,3) is free.\n> \n> Now, other moves? I can only move U or D, but U to (6,5) is invalid, so only possible move is D to (6,3)? But what about L? I cannot move L because instant reverse from R.\n> \n> Current direction R, so moving L is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So only options are U, D, R, but R is wall, U is body collision, so only D to (6,3) is possible?\n> \n> That can't be right; maybe I missed something.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move in other directions, but U and D are the only non-reverse options.\n> \n> But U leads to body collision.\n> \n> Unless... is there a way? Or did I misread the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), which is left, so if I move down to (6,3), that should be fine.\n> \n> But let's list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> From head (6,4):\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) - occupied by snake body segment 3\n> \n> - Down: (6,3) - empty, as per positions\n> \n> - Left: (5,4) - but (5,4) is segment 1, body segment. If I move left to (5,4), that would be collision with body segment, and it's not tail.\n> \n> - Right: (7,4) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is down to (6,3).\n> \n> But moving to (5,4) is left, which is opposite to current direction R, so it's instant reverse, which is not allowed anyway. Rule says cannot move opposite on next turn, so L is forbidden.\n> \n> Similarly, U and D are perpendicular, so allowed, but U is occupied.\n> \n> D to (6,3) is the only choice?\n> \n> But let's confirm if (6,3) is safe. Yes, not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (6,3), the snake will have new head at (6,3), and the tail will move, so the segment at (4,3) will be removed or moved.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, and tail is removed if no food eaten, but since we're moving to (6,3), which has no food, so no growth, tail is removed.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (6,5), neither at (6,3).\n> \n> So after turn 54, snake moves to (6,3), so positions: new head (6,3), then the body: (6,4) becomes segment 1, (5,4) segment 2, and so on, up to tail. Original segment 15 at (4,3) will be removed, so tail becomes (3,3) or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0: (6,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (3,3), 15: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (6,3):\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Then the body: the previous head (6,4) becomes new segment 1, then (5,4) segment 2, (5,5) segment 3, (6,5) segment 4, etc., up to (4,5) which was segment 7, now segment 8, and so on. The tail (4,3) is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> After move, positions: head (6,3), then segments: 1: (6,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,4), 12: (2,3), 13: (2,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (3,3)  -- and (4,3) is gone, so tail is (3,3).\n> \n> Length is now 15, since no food eaten.\n> \n> Direction: head moved down, so new direction is D.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (6,2) with life_span=5, so on turn 54, it can be eaten until turn 58.\n> \n> (6,5) with life_span=8, can be eaten later.\n> \n> Now, (6,5) is currently occupied by body, so I need to free it up to eat later.\n> \n> Since I moved to (6,3), on turn 54, head at (6,3).\n> \n> Now, for turn 55, head at (6,3), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction D, I can move D (down), L (left), R (right), but not U (up, instant reverse).\n> \n> D: to (6,2) -- which has food! (6,2) has positive food.\n> \n> L: to (5,3)\n> \n> R: to (7,3) wall, invalid.\n> \n> U: not allowed, instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible: D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> (6,2) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> (5,3) is empty? Let's see.\n> \n> After turn 54, snake positions: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So (6,2) is not occupied, and not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,2), but (6,2) is different.\n> \n> (5,3) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=6,y=2 is within bounds, no wall.\n> \n> If I move to (6,2) on turn 55, I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (6,2), then the body stays, and tail doesn't move, so new tail is the old tail, but since we eat, we add a segment.\n> \n> Specifically, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position or something. Standard Snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, you add a segment, so the tail stays in place, meaning the new position list has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (6,2) and eating, the head is at (6,2), and the previous positions are all kept, so the segment that was at (3,3) is now part of body, and tail is still (3,3), but since we add a segment, tail remains, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Let's not digress.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,2), is the tail adjacent? Tail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (6,2). (6,2) to (3,3) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,2) and (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) or (7,2), etc. (3,3) is far away, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving to (6,2) should be safe and I get +1 score, snake length increases to 16.\n> \n> Life_span of (6,2) is 5 on turn 54, but on turn 55, after turn 54, it decreases to 4? Let's track food life.\n> \n> On turn 54, before any action, food at (6,2) has life_span=5.\n> \n> After turn 54, I moved to (6,3), no food there, so food life decreases: (6,2) life_span becomes 4.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life_span was 8, becomes 7.\n> \n> Now turn 55: I can move to (6,2) to eat it.\n> \n> If I move to (6,2), I eat it, life_span doesn't matter since it's eaten.\n> \n> Value +1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> After eating, head at (6,2), direction down.\n> \n> Then possible moves: D to (6,1) but y=1, y=0 is wall, so (6,1) is within? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable? Walls: y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom row, playable.\n> \n> Grid: y=1 to y=6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> So (6,1) is playable.\n> \n> But (6,1) is empty? After move to (6,2), snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), and tail (3,3)? After eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: from head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), ..., up to (3,3), and since we ate, we add a segment at the tail, so tail remains (3,3) for now? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't move, the new segment is added, so the tail position stays the same, and the snake grows by one.\n> \n> So in positions: after moving to (6,2) and eating, the new head is (6,2), the body includes all previous positions except the tail is not removed, so we have the previous head (6,3) as segment 1, then (6,4), etc., and the tail (3,3) is still there, and we add a new segment at (3,3)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail is removed. When eat, head moves to new cell, tail is not removed, so snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position, and all body positions, and the tail position remains.\n> \n> For example, before move, positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P15 (tail).\n> \n> After move to new cell with food: new head at food, then P0, P1, ..., P15, so now 17 segments, with new head and tail at P15.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 55, if I move to (6,2) and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then: (6,3)  // previous head\n> \n> - (6,4)      // previous seg1\n> \n> - (5,4)      // previous seg2\n> \n> - (5,5)      // previous seg3\n> \n> - (6,5)      // previous seg4\n> \n> - (6,6)      // previous seg5\n> \n> - (5,6)      // previous seg6\n> \n> - (4,6)      // previous seg7\n> \n> - (4,5)      // previous seg8\n> \n> - (3,5)      // previous seg9\n> \n> - (2,5)      // previous seg10\n> \n> - (2,4)      // previous seg11\n> \n> - (2,3)      // previous seg12\n> \n> - (2,2)      // previous seg13\n> \n> - (3,2)      // previous seg14\n> \n> - (3,3)      // previous seg15 (tail)\n> \n> And since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position? No, the tail position remains, and no new segment is added elsewhere; the snake just doesn't remove the tail, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> So positions: new head (6,2), then the entire previous body from (6,3) to (3,3), and since tail was not removed, it's still there, so now snake has 16 segments: indices 0: (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (4,6), 9: (4,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,4), 13: (2,3), 14: (2,2), 15: (3,2), and 16: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> Previous tail was (3,3), and it remains as the new tail.\n> \n> Length 17 now.\n> \n> Direction: head moved down to (6,2), so direction D.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), possible moves: D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) invalid (wall), U to (6,3) but U is up, current direction D, so U is instant reverse?

No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully about movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - The head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment moves away from its current position.\n> \n> So, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it will collide because that body segment is still there when the head arrives, unless it's the tail and we're eating food, but even then, for body segments, if it's not the tail, it's a collision.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides because that body segment doesn't move away immediately; it only moves after the head has moved.\n> \n> - If the head moves to the tail cell, and we're not eating food, the tail moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> - If we eat food, the tail doesn't move away; a new segment is added, so moving to the tail when eating would cause collision because the new tail is there.\n> \n> But in this case, for (6,4): it is occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> So, moving to (6,4) would cause collision because the body segment at (6,4) is still there when the head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body is deadly except the tail cell under specific conditions.\n> \n> Now, from (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,4) — occupied by body, collision, deadly.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,2) — let's see what's there. (6,2) is within bounds? x=6, y=2. Borders: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (6,2) is valid. And there's food there, but we need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,3) — is this occupied? Snake positions: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), etc. (5,3) is not in the list, so it might be free, but let's list all snake positions to be sure.\n> \n> Snake: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So cells occupied: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is not occupied, and no wall? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (5,2). (5,3) is not a wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,3) — x=7, y=3. Borders: x=7 is a wall, since x=0 or x=7 are walls. So moving right to (7,3) is wall collision, deadly.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,3) with direction down:\n> \n> - U: to (6,4) — body collision, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (6,2) — possible, and has food\n> \n> - L: to (5,3) — seems free\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) — wall, invalid\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is down, so opposite is up. But up is already invalid due to body collision. But the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite on next turn. Since current direction is down, moving up would be reverse, which is not allowed. But in this case, moving up is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Now, for D to (6,2): (6,2) has food with life span 4, value +1. But we need to check if eating it is safe.\n> \n> First, what happens when we eat: we grow by one segment, so after eating, the new head is at (6,2), and the tail doesn't move, so the snake becomes longer.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,2) is under the snake? No, currently (6,2) is not occupied by snake; it's a food position. Snake is at (6,3) head, then (6,4), etc., so (6,2) is empty except for food.\n> \n> In the food list, (6,2) is given, and it's not in snake positions, so it's free to move to.\n> \n> But there's a special case: if food is under body, but here it's not.\n> \n> Now, moving to (6,2) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> But we need to check for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here the food is at (6,2), and tail is at (3,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, like up/down/left/right.\n> \n> (6,2) and (3,3) are not adjacent; (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, (3,3) is x=3,y=3, so |dx|=3, |dy|=1, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,2), then the body: since we ate, the tail stays, so the new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> When we eat food:\n> \n> - Head moves to food cell.\n> \n> - A new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is attached.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail position remains, and the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to food cell, the previous tail position is not vacated; it stays as part of the body.\n> \n> So here, if we move down to (6,2), eat food:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Body: the segment that was head moves to where? Let's sequence:\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them.\n> \n> Let S[0] = head = (6,3)\n> \n> S[1] = (6,4)\n> \n> S[2] = (5,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> S[15] = tail = (3,3)\n> \n> After move down to (6,2) and eat food:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then S[0] becomes S[1], so (6,3) becomes the first body segment\n> \n> - S[1] becomes S[2], but positions shift: the new body starts from the old head position.\n> \n> Better to think:\n> \n> - The head moves to new position (6,2)\n> \n> - Since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> - So the body segments remain, but all shift: the segment that was at S[0] (head) is now at the new position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, each segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, each body segment moves to previous position, but tail stays, so a new segment is added at the old tail position, effectively the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions after eating:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - New body segment 1: previous head position (6,3)\n> \n> - New body segment 2: previous S[1] = (6,4)\n> \n> - New body segment 3: previous S[2] = (5,4)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New body segment 15: previous S[14] = (3,2)  (since S[14] was (3,2), S[15] was tail)\n> \n> S indices: S[0]=(6,3), S[1]=(6,4), S[2]=(5,4), S[3]=(5,5), S[4]=(6,5), S[5]=(6,6), S[6]=(5,6), S[7]=(4,6), S[8]=(4,5), S[9]=(3,5), S[10]=(2,5), S[11]=(2,4), S[12]=(2,3), S[13]=(2,2), S[14]=(3,2), S[15]=(3,3)\n> \n> After moving down to (6,2) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - New S[1]: (6,3)  // previous head\n> \n> - New S[2]: (6,4)  // previous S[1]\n> \n> - New S[3]: (5,4)  // previous S[2]\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New S[15]: (3,2)  // previous S[14]\n> \n> - New S[16]: (3,3)  // previous tail, new segment added\n> \n> So tail is now at (3,3), which was the old tail, and it stays.\n> \n> Now, from (6,2), what can we do?

Current turn is 55, so it will disappear after turn 55 + 3? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone.\n> \n> \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life span 4 at turn 55:\n> \n> - Turn 55: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 56: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 57: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 58: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 59: life span 0, disappears? Or after turn 58?\n> \n> \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that after N turns from now, it's gone. So if life span is N, it has N turns left, including the current one.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 55, L=4, it is there on turns 55,56,57, and disappears after turn 58, so on turn 59 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) L=7, so lasts until turn 55+7-1=61, disappears on turn 62.\n> \n> (1,3) L=10, lasts until turn 55+10-1=64, disappears turn 65.\n> \n> Now, current position: head at (6,3), direction down.\n> \n> Possible actions this turn: D or L.\n> \n> D: to (6,2) eat food, grow to 17 segments.\n> \n> L: to (5,3) no food, no growth, snake moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Draw a grid, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and (5,2) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (6,3)\n> \n> Body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with a tail going left.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (6,2): below head, y=2\n> \n> - (6,5): which is occupied by body?

It's turn 56, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (5,2), so I can't go there.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). Let me plot this to visualize.\n> \n> The head is at (6,2) and the direction is down, which is D. Down means increasing y, since (x,y+1) is up? No, let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases upwards? That might be counterintuitive, but I'll go with it. So U is up (y+1), D is down (y-1), L is left (x-1), R is right (x+1).\n> \n> Head at (6,2) direction D, so moving down, meaning y decreases. Current position (6,2), moving down would go to (6,1), but y=0 is the border, so (6,1) might be valid if not wall.\n> \n> Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,1) should be within bounds.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food, since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5), it has 6 turns left, including current turn, so it disappears after turn 56 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1? Let me think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can only be eaten on turn t if possible.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,5), life span 6 at turn 56, so it will be available until turn 56 + 5 = 61? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 56: life span 6, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 57: life span 5, can be eaten\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 61: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 61, it disappears, so not available on turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,3), life span 9 at turn 56, so available until turn 56 + 8 = 64? Turn 56: L=9, turn 57: L=8, ..., turn 64: L=1, turn 65 gone.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (6,2), direction D (down, y-1).\n> \n> The snake body: let's list all positions to understand the shape.\n> \n> Positions in order: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> Head is (6,2), then next is (6,3), which is above it since y+1 is up? Coordinate: (6,2) to (6,3) is moving up? Head at (6,2), direction is D (down), but the body segment is at (6,3), which is north of (6,2) if y increases up.\n> \n> Assume standard grid: (x,y), with (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? The movement U is (x,y+1), which is typically up if y=0 is bottom, but in many games, y=0 is top. I need to be careful.\n> \n> The borders: y=0 and y=7, with walls. Since U is (x,y+1) and D is (x,y-1), it suggests that y=0 is the bottom, and y=7 is the top, because U increases y, so moving up.\n> \n> For example, from (x,y), U to (x,y+1) is up, D to (x,y-1) is down.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3). (6,3) has y=3, which is higher than y=2, so since y increases up, (6,3) is above (6,2). But the head is at (6,2) moving down to lower y, so towards (6,1) or similar.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so it was moving down to (6,2) from previous position. The positions list has head first, so before moving, snake is at these positions. Turn 56, snake is at these positions, and we choose next move.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction\": D, so the current movement direction is down, meaning it was moving down to reach (6,2) from, say, (6,3) or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> The positions are listed from head to tail: head (6,2), then body (6,3), (6,4), etc.\n> \n> So at turn 56, snake head is at (6,2), and the first body segment is at (6,3), which is directly above it (since y=3 > y=2, assuming y=0 bottom).\n> \n> Then next is (6,4), above (6,3), then (5,4), left of (6,4), then (5,5), up from (5,4), then (6,5), right of (5,5), then (6,6), up from (6,5), then (5,6), left of (6,6), then (4,6), left of (5,6), then (4,5), down from (4,6), then (3,5), left of (4,5), then (2,5), left of (3,5), then (2,4), down from (2,5), then (2,3), down from (2,4), then (2,2), down from (2,3), then (3,2), right of (2,2), then (3,3), up from (3,2).\n> \n> Tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, the head is at (6,2) with direction D (down). So from the positions, it was moving down to (6,2), and before that it was at (6,3) or something? The direction is the current heading, so for the next move, if I continue down, I go to (6,1).\n> \n> But (6,1) is within bounds, y=1, not wall.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,2): since direction is D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U (up) next turn. I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (6,2):\n> \n> - Down (D): (6,1) - is this free?

Now, is it occupied by snake body?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> From positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> (6,1) is not in this list, so it's free.\n> \n> - Left (L): (5,2) - x-1,y, so (5,2). But (5,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right (R): (7,2) - x+1,y, x=7, but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Up (U): (6,3) - but (6,3) is occupied by body, and also, U is opposite to current direction D, so I cannot move U anyway due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,2):\n> \n> - D: (6,1) - free\n> \n> - L: (5,2) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: (7,2) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - U: invalid due to reverse and also occupied\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (6,1).\n> \n> Is that right? L is to (5,2), which is wall, R to (7,2) wall, U forbidden, so only D to (6,1).\n> \n> But (6,1) is free, as per positions.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (6,1), the snake will move, so tail will also move, etc.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,5) and (1,3).\n> \n> (6,5) is currently occupied by the snake body? Let's see, (6,5) is in positions: it's the 6th segment, position index 5: (6,5) is listed, so it's occupied by body.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) is not in positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Now, about food under body: (6,5) has food, but it's under the body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Specifically, the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's find where the tail is.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,3), as last position.\n> \n> Now, head is at (6,2), tail at (3,3), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to tail: (3,3) has neighbors (3,4), (3,2), (4,3), (2,3). (3,2) is occupied by body?

So it can be eaten from turn 57 to 60, but on turn 61 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,3): life span 8, so from turn 57 to 64, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (6,1), moving down. Since direction is D, it just moved to (6,1) from above, I assume. Positions: previous head was probably (6,0) but y=0 is wall, so let's think.\n> \n> The positions list has head at (6,1), and it was moving down, so it came from (6,0)? But (6,0) is y=0, which is wall, so that can't be. Perhaps I misread.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), ...] so from head to tail: (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2)\n> \n> Direction is D, meaning it's moving down. But at (6,1), moving down would go to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so that's impossible. Perhaps the direction is the current movement direction, so at turn 57, the head is at (6,1) and it is moving down, but if it moves down, it would hit the wall at (6,0). But (6,0) is invalid.\n> \n> y=0 is the bottom wall? Typically in grids, y=0 might be the bottom or top; I need to clarify.\n> \n> The grid: walls at y=0 and y=7. Since it's a 2D grid, let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But for movement, it doesn't matter, but for direction.\n> \n> Head at (6,1), moving down. Down means decreasing y or increasing? In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So D: down, y decreases.\n> \n> So at (6,1), moving D to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so it can't move there. That means the snake must change direction immediately to avoid death.\n> \n> But the direction given is \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which is the current direction it is facing, but since it can't move down, I have to choose a different action for turn 57.\n> \n> The action sequence starts from turn 57, so I need to decide the move for turn 57.\n> \n> Current head position (6,1), direction D, but moving D would hit wall, so I must choose L, R, or U? But no instant reverse, but since it's moving down, reverse would be up, U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - U: up, to (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by the snake body? Positions: (6,2) is the second segment.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are all occupied except the tail will move when the head moves, but for collision, head cannot move to any body segment except the tail, because tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's list all current snake positions: from the list: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So cells occupied by snake: all these coordinates.\n> \n> For head at (6,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,2) – but (6,2) is occupied by the snake's body (index 1), so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> - D: to (6,0) – but y=0 is wall, so wall collision, death.\n> \n> - L: left, to (5,1) – is (5,1) occupied? From list, (5,1) not in positions, so it might be free.\n> \n> Positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). No (5,1), so (5,1) is empty.\n> \n> - R: right, to (7,1) – but x=7 is wall, so wall collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move from (6,1) without dying is L to (5,1).\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is D, reverse is U, but U is to (6,2) which is body, so not possible anyway. L and R are perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> So for turn 57, I must move L to (5,1) to survive.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (5,1), the snake will have new head position (5,1), and the tail will move, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves from (3,2) to next? When head moves to (5,1), the body segments shift: the new head is (5,1), then the old head (6,1) becomes part of body, so positions become: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)] and the tail (3,2) is removed, so (2,2) becomes the new tail end? Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,4), 14: (2,3), 15: (2,2), 16: (3,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving L to (5,1): new head is (5,1), then the body segments: the first body segment is the old head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), etc., up to (2,2), and the tail (3,2) is gone. So new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)]\n> \n> (2,2) is the tail now, and (3,2) is removed.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,5) has food with value 1, life span 5. But (6,5) is currently occupied by the snake, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head moves back when it's free.\n> \n> (1,3) has food with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score.\n> \n> First, immediate action for turn 57: must move L to (5,1) to avoid death.\n> \n> Then for subsequent turns.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), head is at (5,1), direction was D, but now moved L, so new direction is L.\n> \n> From (5,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,2) – but (5,2) is the internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: to (5,0) – y=0 wall, cannot.\n> \n> - L: to (4,1) – is this free? Current snake positions after move: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). (4,1) not in list, so free.\n> \n> - R: to (6,1) – but (6,1) is now the body segment (index 1), so collision, cannot.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is L, reverse is R, which is to (6,1), body, so not possible. U and D are perpendicular.\n> \n> But U to (5,2) is obstacle, D to (5,0) wall, so only possible move is L to (4,1).\n> \n> Is that right? From (5,1), after turn 57 move.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), the only free adjacent cell is (4,1), since (5,2) obstacle, (5,0) wall, (6,1) body.\n> \n> (4,1) is not occupied, so yes.\n> \n> So for turn 58, I must move L to (4,1).\n> \n> Then head to (4,1), new positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] and tail (2,2) gone? Original tail was (2,2), but after first move to (5,1), tail was (2,2), now moving head to (4,1), so new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), ..., up to (2,3), and tail (2,2) removed?

It's turn 58. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then body segments: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Then: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> The snake has 17 segments. Direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving left from (5,1). Since direction is L, and head is at (5,1), last move was to the left, so from (6,1) to (5,1), I assume.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N more turns starting from now.\n> \n> Current turn is 58. So:\n> \n> - Food at (6,5): life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 58 + 4 = turn 62? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it's gone. So it exists for N turns including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N means it will be gone after N more turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, after this turn, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1 at start of turn t+1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Typically: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L. During turn t, if snake moves to it, it eats. At the end of turn t, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think \"including current\" means that on the turn it's spawned, the countdown includes that turn.\n> \n> In this context, at turn 58, life span is given, so for (6,5), life span 4, so after 4 turns, it will be gone. Meaning, it can be eaten on turns 58, 59, 60, 61, and disappears before turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 7: can be eaten turns 58 to 64, disappears before 65.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 10: eaten turns 58 to 67.\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is L, so it's moving left. Current head at (5,1), direction L, so it came from right, probably (6,1), which is the next segment.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R, because no instant reverse. Current direction L, so I can't move right immediately.\n> \n> So possible actions: Left (continue left), Up, or Down. Not Right.\n> \n> Now, grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

No, the food is given as (x,y, life_span, value). Let me check the input.\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (6, 5, 3, 1) — that might be (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (1,3,6,1) and (3,1,9,1). In the description, it's \"value\" and \"life_span\", but here the numbers are grouped. Probably (x,y), life_span, value. But in the input, it's written as (x,y, life_span, value). For (6,5,3,1), that could be x=6,y=5, life_span=3, value=1? But it says value1, life_span1 in the format, but here it's listed as a tuple.\n> \n> Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the current state, it's given as (6,5,3,1) which might be a mistake.

Probably it's (x,y, life_span, value). For example, (6,5) with life_span=3, value=1? But value=1 is positive food, +1. Similarly, (1,3) with life_span=6, value=1; (3,1) with life_span=9, value=1. But in the core rules, food can be positive or negative, with value +1 or -1. Here all have value=1, so all positive? But for (6,5), life_span=3, but it's turn 59, life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 59, life_span=3 means it has 3 turns left, including this turn, so it will disappear after turn 61? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life_span is given as S, at turn t, it has S turns left, including t. So after S turns, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,5): life_span=3 at turn 59, so it will disappear after turn 61 (since turn 59: countdown to 3, turn 60: countdown to 2, turn 61: countdown to 1, then after turn 61, it disappears? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life_span = L, then at turn t, it is present, countdown L; turn t+1, countdown L-1; ... turn t+L-1, countdown 1; after that, gone. So it can be eaten from turn t to t+L-1.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But for (6,5), life_span=3 at turn 59, so it can be eaten on turns 59, 60, 61.

It's under the body at position (6,5), which is segment 9 in the list.\n> \n> For it to be eatable, the body must move away, then head move there.\n> \n> Currently, the snake is moving, so segments move.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves in such a way that the segment at (6,5) moves, then (6,5) becomes free, and if head can reach it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But (6,5) is deep in the body.\n> \n> Let's see the snake's current path. From head (4,1), to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), then left to (5,4), then up to (5,5), right to (6,5), up to (6,6), left to (5,6), left to (4,6), down to (4,5), left to (3,5), left to (2,5), down to (2,4), down to (2,3) tail.\n> \n> So it's a bit messy.\n> \n> The food at (6,5) is on a body segment that will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> For instance, when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, and each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> So at turn 59, if snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So the segment at (6,5) is the 9th segment; when snake moves, it will move to where the 8th segment was, which is (5,5)? Positions: segment 8 is (5,5), segment 9 is (6,5), so when head moves, segment 9 will move to (5,5), which is the position of segment 8.\n> \n> Similarly, segment 8 was at (5,5), will move to where segment 7 was, (5,4), and so on.\n> \n> So after any move, the body segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically for (6,5): currently occupied. After the snake moves, if the head moves away, the segment at (6,5) will move to the position of the previous segment 8, which is (5,5). So (6,5) becomes free only if no new segment moves there, but since the snake is moving forward, the cell (6,5) is vacated when the segment leaves and no other segment enters immediately.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves, the tail cell is vacated, and other cells might be vacated if the snake turns, but in this case, since it's a chain, only the tail cell is definitely vacated; other cells may or may not be, depending on the path.\n> \n> But for a cell under the body, it becomes free when the segment that was there moves away and no other segment moves into it at the same time.\n> \n> For (6,5), at turn 59, it is occupied. After turn 59 move, segment 9 moves to (5,5), so (6,5) is vacated. Then, if the head or another segment doesn't move to (6,5), it is free, and the food can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> But at turn 59, after move, (6,5) is vacated because segment 9 moves to (5,5).\n> \n> Similarly, the new position of segment 9 is (5,5), but (5,5) was occupied by segment 8, which moves to (5,4), so (5,5) is now occupied by segment 9.\n> \n> The vacated cell is the tail cell, which is (2,3) if the tail moves, but tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 59, before move: head at (4,1), tail at (2,3).\n> \n> If no food eaten, when snake moves, head to new position, tail moves forward, so the cell (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Other body segments move, so for example, segment at (6,5) moves to (5,5), so (6,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, all cells except the new head position and the tail position change, but some cells are vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves without eating, the tail cell is vacated, and also any cell where a segment was but not anymore.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,5), since segment 9 moves to (5,5), (6,5) is vacated after the move.\n> \n> Then, at the beginning of turn 60, (6,5) is free, and since food is there, it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> But at turn 59, after move, (6,5) is free for turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, if food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so no cell vacated except by the body shift.\n> \n> But for now, let's focus on turn 59 action.\n> \n> Back to choices at turn 59.\n> \n> From (4,1), can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n> \n> If move L to (3,1), eat food at (3,1), so snake grows: new head at (3,1), the segment that was at (3,1) is added, so positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), ..., up to tail (2,3), and since ate food, tail stays, so length 18.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), as before, can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n> \n> If move U to (4,2), no food eaten, so snake moves, head to (4,2), then body follows: (4,1) becomes new segment 2, (5,1) segment 3, etc., and tail (2,3) moves to where?

No, positions: let's list with indices.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n> \n> So (6,5) is at index 9, and (6,6) at index 10, etc.\n> \n> Food is at (6,5), which is occupied by the snake body segment at index 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) is free, I think, not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Now, food (6,5) has life span 2, meaning after turn 60, it has 1 turn left, so it disappears after turn 61 if not eaten. Since turn 60 is current, life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 60, life span 2 means it will be there for turn 60 and 61, gone after turn 61.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) has life span 5, so present for turns 60,61,62,63,64, gone after 64.\n> \n> But for (6,5), since it's under the snake, it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes back.\n> \n> But the snake segment at (6,5) is not the tail; tail is at (2,3). So for the food to be accessible, the snake needs to move so that (6,5) is vacated, then head can move there.\n> \n> But with life span only 1 more turn after this, it might be tight.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), direction L, so moving left. From (3,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move right immediately. So allowed moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> Move left to (2,1): is this safe?\n> \n> Check walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so (2,1) is not a wall since x=2 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls. Similarly y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> So (2,1): x=2, y=1, not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (2,1).\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3).\n> \n> (2,1) is not in this list, so it's empty, I assume. Food is at (6,5) and (1,3), not at (2,1), so (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> But is it possible to move there? Yes, since no body or wall.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will move, so body follows.\n> \n> Similarly, move up to (3,2): (3,2) is not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,1), (3,5), but not (3,2), so should be free.\n> \n> Move down to (3,0): but y=0 is wall, so cannot move down, because y=0 is border wall.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is invalid.\n> \n> Move right: but cannot, because opposite direction, current is L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1), or D but D is (3,0) which is wall, impossible. So only U or L? D is down to (3,0), which is y=0, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Current head (3,1), down would be y-1, so (3,0), which is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Left to (2,1), valid.\n> \n> Up to (3,2), valid.\n> \n> Right invalid because opposite direction.\n> \n> So only two choices: U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food situation.\n> \n> Food at (6,5) is under the snake body at index 9. To eat it, the snake must move so that (6,5) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 60, (6,5) has food with life span 2, meaning it will be gone after turn 61. So only turn 60 and 61 it is present.\n> \n> Turn 60: life span 2, decreases to 1 after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, but when does it disappear?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it is present from turn t to t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1, meaning not present at turn t+L.\n> \n> Turn 60, life span 2: present at turn 60 and 61, gone at turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 5: present turns 60 to 64, gone at 65.\n> \n> Now for (6,5), to eat it, we need head to be on (6,5) when it's present and not under body, but since it's under body now, we need body to move away.\n> \n> The segment at (6,5) is index 9. When the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away.\n> \n> But the food is at a specific cell, so when the snake moves, the segment that was at (6,5) will move to where index 8 was or something.\n> \n> Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves to a new cell, say (2,1) if left, then new positions: head at (2,1), then body: segment 1 at old head (3,1), segment 2 at old seg1 (4,1), and so on, up to segment 17 at old seg16, and tail (old seg17) is removed or something. Since snake grows only when eating food.\n> \n> Normally, when no food eaten, snake moves: head to new position, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous one, and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,5), the food is there, but occupied by body. When the snake moves, if no eating, the segment at (6,5) will move to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> Current positions: index 8: (5,5), index 9: (6,5), index 10: (6,6), etc.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves left to (2,1), then new head: (2,1)\n> \n> New body: segment 1: old head (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 2: old seg1 (4,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 9: old seg8 (5,5)  // since old seg8 was (5,5), so seg9 now at (5,5)\n> \n> Then segment 10: old seg9 (6,5) but since no food eaten, the tail end: old tail was (2,3), which is vacated.\n> \n> So after move, the cell (6,5) is now occupied by nothing, because the segment that was there moved to (5,5) for seg9? Let's index properly.\n> \n> Positions: let's call P0: (3,1), P1: (4,1), P2: (5,1), P3: (6,1), P4: (6,2), P5: (6,3), P6: (6,4), P7: (5,4), P8: (5,5), P9: (6,5), P10: (6,6), P11: (5,6), P12: (4,6), P13: (4,5), P14: (3,5), P15: (2,5), P16: (2,4), P17: (2,3)  // tail\n> \n> After moving head to a new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then new positions: new P0 = new_head\n> \n> P1 = old P0\n> \n> P2 = old P1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> P17 = old P16\n> \n> And old P17 is vacated.\n> \n> So for cell (6,5), it was old P9.\n> \n> After move, if no eating, P9 becomes old P8, which is (5,5), so (6,5) is no longer occupied, vacated.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to (6,5) in a subsequent turn, it can eat the food, provided the food is still there.\n> \n> For food at (6,5), after this move (turn 60), the cell is vacated, and food is still there since life span 2, so at turn 61, it is present.\n> \n> Then at turn 61, if head moves to (6,5), it can eat it.\n> \n> But life span: at turn 60, food has life span 2, so after turn 60, it decreases to 1, so present at turn 61. After turn 61, decreases to 0, disappears, so not present at turn 62.\n> \n> So only turn 61 is possible to eat it, since at turn 60 it's under body, can't eat.\n> \n> At turn 60, head is not on (6,5), and it's occupied, so can't eat now. After moving, at turn 61, (6,5) is free if we move away, and food is there.\n> \n> But to eat it at turn 61, head needs to be able to move to (6,5) at turn 61.\n> \n> First, what is head position after turn 60 move.\n> \n> I need to decide the action for turn 60.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,3) with more life span.\n> \n> Now, back to current moves: from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (2,1), then new head at (2,1), body shifts, so old P17 (2,3) vacated.\n> \n> Then (6,5) is now vacated, food there for turn 61.\n> \n> Head at (2,1) after turn 60.\n> \n> From (2,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction after move: since I moved L, new direction is L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> From (2,1), U to (2,2), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L to (1,1), R to (3,1).\n> \n> But R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R. So possible: U or L.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,2), or L to (1,1).\n> \n> But I want to go to (6,5) for food, but (2,1) to (6,5) is far, 4 steps right and 4 up, not reachable in one step.\n> \n> At turn 61, head is at (2,1) if I moved L at turn 60.\n> \n> From (2,1), to reach (6,5) in one move? Impossible, (6,5) is at distance |6-2|=4 x, |5-1|=4 y, not adjacent. So I cannot reach (6,5) from (2,1) in one move; it's too far.\n> \n> Therefore, if I move left to (2,1) at turn 60, I cannot eat the (6,5) food at turn 61 because I can't reach it from (2,1).\n> \n> Moreover, after turn 60 move to (2,1), the head is at (2,1), and (6,5) is free, but I can't get there fast enough.\n> \n> Perhaps if I go up instead.\n> \n> Alternative: at turn 60, move U to (3,2).\n> \n> Then new head at (3,2), body shifts, old tail (2,3) vacated.\n> \n> (6,5) vacated as well, since old P9 moved to old P8 (5,5).\n> \n> Food at (6,5) present at turn 61.\n> \n> Now head at (3,2) after turn 60.\n> \n> From (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body? After move, positions: new head (3,2), P1: old head (3,1), P2: (4,1), etc.\n> \n> (3,1) is occupied by body, so moving down to (3,1) would be body collision.\n> \n> Current direction after moving U is U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n> \n> D is invalid because opposite or collision.\n> \n> From (3,2), U, L, R possible.\n> \n> To reach (6,5) at turn 61, from (3,2) it's |6-3|=3 x, |5-2|=3 y, not adjacent, so cannot reach in one move. Distance min 3 steps.\n> \n> So in both cases, whether I move L or U at turn 60, I cannot reach (6,5) at turn 61 to eat the food, because it's too far from the new head position.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the (6,5) food; it will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> Because at turn 61, head cannot be at (6,5) from possible positions after turn 60.\n> \n> After turn 60 move:\n> \n> - If move L to (2,1), head at (2,1), to (6,5) distance 4,4\n> \n> - If move U to (3,2), head at (3,2), to (6,5) distance 3,3\n> \n> Neither adjacent, so no direct move to (6,5) at turn 61.\n> \n> Moreover, no other moves possible from (3,1).\n> \n> So (6,5) food cannot be eaten; it will expire.\n> \n> So I should ignore that food and focus on the other food at (1,3) or other strategies.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,3) with life span 5, so I have until turn 64 to eat it.\n> \n> It's at (1,3), which is not occupied, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,3) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Now, current head at (3,1), to reach (1,3), I need to go left and up.\n> \n> But with walls and body.\n> \n> Also, there is a internal obstacle at (5,2), but not relevant for now.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence to maximize score, so eating positive food, but avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the map to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Grid: walls at borders and (5,2).\n> \n> Snake occupies many cells, let's list free cells or something.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5 turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, from current position (3,1), options: U or L.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (2,1) at turn 60.\n> \n> Then head at (2,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (2,2), L to (1,1), or R but R opposite, invalid.

Here all values are 1, so no negative food in this state.\n> \n> Life spans: (6,5) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 61, life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 61 if not eaten. Since we're at turn 61, if we don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will be there until turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, a food has life_span L. It will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L. Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> At turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,5) at turn 61, life_span=1: after turn 61, it will have life_span 0, so it disappears. Meaning, it can only be eaten on turn 61, or not at all.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life_span=4: present for turns 61,62,63,64, disappears after turn 64.\n> \n> (1,5) life_span=10: present for turns 61 to 70, disappears after turn 70.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,2), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down next. So allowed moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is illegal because it's opposite to Up.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from Up, cannot go Down. Can go Up, Left, or Right.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> I should plot this.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid:\n> \n> y=7: row 7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> y=0: row 0\n> \n> But y increases up or down? In coordinates, (x,y), and movement U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I assume. Standard in such games, (0,0) bottom left, y up.\n> \n> But in the positions, (3,2) to (3,1): from (3,1) to (3,2) is up, so y=2 is above y=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) to (6,2) up, etc.\n> \n> So let's list positions with y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the border is walls. Also (5,2) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Now snake segments:\n> \n> - (3,2) head\n> \n> - (3,1) - below head\n> \n> - (4,1) - right of (3,1)\n> \n> - (5,1) - right of (4,1)\n> \n> - (6,1) - right of (5,1)\n> \n> - (6,2) - up from (6,1)\n> \n> - (6,3) - up from (6,2)\n> \n> - (6,4) - up from (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,4) - left from (6,4)?

(5,5), then (6,5), so (6,5) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) and (1,5) are free, I think.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,5), (1,3), (1,5)\n> \n> But (6,5) has a food, and it's also a snake body segment? In the snake positions, (5,5) then (6,5), so at turn 61, (6,5) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake body, as per rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (6,5), there is food under the body, but since the body is there, it can't be eaten now. Only if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> But (6,5) food has life span 1, so it disappears after this turn. Since it's under the body, and body is there now, it can't be eaten on this turn, so it will disappear without being eaten.

So the cell that was tail is now free.\n> \n> - If new cell is food, then tail stays, so the snake grows, and the new body includes all previous positions plus the new head, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Collision: head collides with any body segment except that, if it moves to the current tail position, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, from rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and if no growth, tail moves, so no collision. If growth, it would collide, but since eating food causes growth, moving to tail with food is dangerous.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Back to possible moves for turn 61.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), moving to:\n> \n> - Up to (3,3): is (3,3) occupied?

From list, (2,3) not there, so free? But let's confirm: positions include (6,3), (5,4), etc., no (2,3). Also, walls: not a wall, so should be free.\n> \n> - D to (2,1): (2,1) not in positions, walls not there, so free.\n> \n> - L to (1,2): (1,2) not in positions, walls: x=0 is wall, but x=1 is not x=0, so should be free.\n> \n> x=0 is wall, x=1 is fine.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,3) and (1,5). (1,3) is above (1,2), and (1,5) is further up.\n> \n> (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, and (1,5) at x=1,y=5.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,2). If I move left to (1,2), then from there I can go up to (1,3) to eat the food, but I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a tail at (2,5), which is the end of the snake. Tail is (2,5), since positions end with (2,5).\n> \n> Food at (1,5) is at y=5, x=1, and tail is at (2,5), so adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns, but probably more to maximize score.\n> \n> The goal is to eat positive food while avoiding risks, and think long-term.\n> \n> Available food: (1,3) with life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 65 (since turn 62 current, life span 4: decreases this turn, so after 4 turns, gone. Life span decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Turn 62: life span 4, present\n> \n> - After turn 62, life span 3\n> \n> - After turn 63, life span 2\n> \n> - After turn 64, life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 65, life span 0, disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 9: present until turn 70, can be eaten up to turn 70.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,2), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions turn 62: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,2), then head at (1,2) for turn 63.\n> \n> From (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), R to (2,2), but (2,2) is where the neck is? After moving to (1,2), the previous head (2,2) becomes the neck, but since the snake moves, the body follows.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail end is vacated unless a food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves, so cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,2) on turn 62, then:\n> \n> - Head moves to (1,2)\n> \n> - Body: the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (2,2), which was previous head position.\n> \n> The positions update: new head at (1,2), then body: (2,2) becomes first body segment, then (3,1) moves to where (3,2) was? Let's not track all, but for collision, we care about the new positions.\n> \n> After move to (1,2), the snake positions: head (1,2), then (2,2) (which was previous head), then (3,2) moves to (3,2)? No.\n> \n> Snake segments: current positions: index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), etc.\n> \n> After moving left to (1,2):\n> \n> - New head: (1,2)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (3,2), so now (3,2) is occupied by segment 2? Let's think: each segment i moves to position of segment i-1 from previous state.\n> \n> Standard: new position: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: new head: (1,2)\n> \n> New segment 1: position of old head, (2,2)\n> \n> New segment 2: position of old segment 1, which was (3,2)\n> \n> New segment 3: position of old segment 2, which was (3,1)\n> \n> And so on, down to tail.\n> \n> Old tail was (2,5), so after move, the segment that was at (2,5) moves to position of the previous tail segment, but since it's the end, it vacates if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, since no food eaten (assuming), tail moves, so (2,5) is free now.\n> \n> But for immediate moves, from (1,2), possible directions:\n> \n> - U to (1,3)\n> \n> - D to (1,1)\n> \n> - R to (2,2) — but (2,2) is now occupied by the first body segment, so moving right would collide with body.\n> \n> - L to (0,2) — but x=0 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So from (1,2), possible moves: U, D. R is body, L is wall.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,3), so if I go U from (1,2), I can eat it at (1,3).\n> \n> But let's see the tail reward danger.\n> \n> If I eat at (1,3), value +1, length increases.\n> \n> But tail is at, after moving to (1,2), the tail is somewhere else.\n> \n> First, let's sequence.\n> \n> Also, need to think about the food at (1,5).\n> \n> But (1,5) has longer life, so less urgent.\n> \n> Now, another option: from (2,2), I could go U to (2,3).\n> \n> Then from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) will be body, L to (1,3), R to (3,3) etc.\n> \n> But let's plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, I should consider the grid layout.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 borders.

(5,2) is obstacle, not snake, so (5,3) should be free, etc.\n> \n> But I don't need all, just for pathing.\n> \n> Now, from head (2,2), move options turn 62:\n> \n> Option 1: L to (1,2)\n> \n> Then turn 63: from (1,2), can go U to (1,3) to eat food, or D to (1,1)\n> \n> If go U to (1,3), eat food at (1,3). Value +1, length increases by 1, so tail doesn't move, the cell (1,3) is new head, and body extends, so the previous tail stays.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so positions: head at (1,3), then the body includes all previous segments, tail stays at (2,5) or wherever it was.\n> \n> After move to (1,2) and then to (1,3) with eat.\n> \n> Turn 62: move to (1,2), no eat, so tail moves, (2,5) vacated.\n> \n> Then turn 63: move to (1,3), which has food, so eat, head at (1,3), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the segment that was to move to tail position stays, length increases.\n> \n> New head: (1,3)\n> \n> Body: previous head position (1,2) becomes new segment 1, then previous segment positions: but since no move for body, the body segments are: (1,2), then the old segment that was at (2,2) moves to (1,2)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After turn 62 move to (1,2) without eat: positions: head (1,2), then (2,2), then (3,2) (from old (3,2)? Old positions: before turn 62, head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,1), etc.\n> \n> After move L to (1,2) no eat: new head (1,2), new body: segment 1: old head (2,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (3,2), segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1), segment 4: old segment 3 (4,1), ..., up to segment 17: old segment 16 (2,5)? Let's count segments.\n> \n> Current snake positions have 18 segments? List: indices 0 to 17: 0:(2,2), 1:(3,2), 2:(3,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(6,1), 6:(6,2), 7:(6,3), 8:(6,4), 9:(5,4), 10:(5,5), 11:(6,5), 12:(6,6), 13:(5,6), 14:(4,6), 15:(4,5), 16:(3,5), 17:(2,5)\n> \n> So 18 cells, length 18.\n> \n> After move to (1,2) no eat: head to (1,2), then body: segment 1 to (2,2) (old head), segment 2 to (3,2) (old seg1), segment 3 to (3,1) (old seg2), ..., segment 17 to (2,5) (old seg16), and old seg17 (2,5) is vacated, so tail is at (3,5) now? New segment 17 is at old seg16 position, which is (3,5), since old seg16 is (3,5), index 16 is (3,5), old seg17 is (2,5).\n> \n> After move no eat: new positions: head (1,2), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (3,1), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (5,1), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (6,4), seg10 (5,4), seg11 (5,5), seg12 (6,5), seg13 (6,6), seg14 (5,6), seg15 (4,6), seg16 (4,5), seg17 (3,5)  // since old seg16 (3,5) is now seg17, and (2,5) vacated.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Then turn 63, from (1,2) head, move U to (1,3): (1,3) has food, so eat.\n> \n> New head at (1,3), food eaten, so tail does not move. New segment added at the tail position before move, but since tail moved in previous turn, it's a bit messy.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, before move, positions: head (1,2), body up to tail (3,5)\n> \n> After moving to (1,3) with eat: new head at (1,3), then the body includes all previous positions: so (1,2) becomes new seg1, (2,2) new seg2, (3,2) new seg3, ..., up to (3,5) new seg18, and since eat, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (3,5), so new tail at (3,5), but (3,5) is now occupied by two segments? No.\n> \n> Previous tail position was (3,5), and since no move, when eat, a new segment is added at that position, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added there? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better: after move with eat, the snake grows, so the new positions are: head at new position, then all previous segments remain, and the tail is the same as before, but since a new segment is added, the tail position doesn't change, but it's now one segment longer.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (1,3), then the first body segment is the previous head position (1,2), then the previous body segments in order: (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), ..., up to (3,5), and then since food eaten, the tail segment (3,5) is duplicated or a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> The new tail is the previous tail, and a new segment is attached, so the previous tail position remains part of the body, and a new cell is added at the same position for the new tail? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the snake eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, but the tail does not move, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is created at that position, but the positions shift.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake with 3 segments: head A, body B, tail C.\n> \n> Move to D with eat: new head D, then body: A, then B, then C, and new tail at C, but C is now the second last, and a new segment at C? No.\n> \n> After move with eat: positions are D (head), A (body), B (body), C (tail), and since eat, C remains tail, but length increases, so the new positions are D, A, B, C, and C is still there, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> I think it's better to think that the tail doesn't advance, so the cell that would have been vacated is not, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So in terms of positions, after move with eat, the new head is at the food cell, the body includes all previous positions from head to tail, so the tail position is the same, but it's not vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 63: from positions before turn 63: head (1,2), body (2,2), (3,2), ..., (3,5)  // 18 segments\n> \n> Move to (1,3) with eat: new head (1,3), then new body: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), ..., (3,5)  // same as previous positions, but all shifted, so new positions: head (1,3), seg1 (1,2), seg2 (2,2), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (3,1), ..., seg18 (3,5), and since eat, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (3,5), so new seg19 at (3,5), and tail is at (3,5) but it's the same cell, so now length 19, positions from (1,3) to (3,5), with (3,5) being the tail.\n> \n> The point is, after eating at (1,3), the tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, back to the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because collision.\n> \n> But here, after eating at (1,3), tail is at (3,5), head at (1,3), which are not adjacent; (1,3) and (3,5) are not adjacent, distance |dx=2, dy=2|, so no issue.\n> \n> Then from (1,3), head, direction from (1,2) to (1,3) so moving U, so head direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, L wall, R to (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is free?

Let's see the sequence: positions are given as list, head first.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> So, from head to tail: (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (3,5)\n> \n> Now, the head is at (1,2), and the second segment is (2,2), which is to the right, so the snake was moving left to reach (1,2) from the right? But from (2,2) to (1,2) is left, so current direction is left, meaning it just moved to (1,2) from (2,2) by moving left? But (2,2) to (1,2) is left, so from turn 62 to turn 63, it moved from (2,2) to (1,2) by moving left. Now at turn 63, head is at (1,2), direction L.\n> \n> But from (1,2), moving left would be to (0,2), which is x=0, wall, so not possible. Therefore, the snake cannot move left. It must change direction.\n> \n> Available moves: since current direction is L, it cannot move right (opposite direction), so possible moves are U, D, or L, but L is invalid due to wall, so only U or D.\n> \n> Let's confirm: from (1,2), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,3)\n> \n> - Down: (1,1)\n> \n> - Left: (0,2) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,2) - but (2,2) is the body segment, but in snake, moving into the body is only deadly if it's not the tail, and even then, it depends.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move. But when moving, if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by the body after the move, it's collision.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail end is removed, so the cell where the tail was becomes empty, unless it grows by eating food.\n> \n> In this case, for a move, if the head moves to a cell that is not free, it dies.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If the cell is wall, collision.\n> \n> - If the cell is a body segment, collision, except if it is the tail segment, because after the move, the tail moves away, so that cell becomes free.\n> \n> But in this case, for the head at (1,2), moving right to (2,2): (2,2) is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, the head moves to (2,2), but (2,2) was occupied, so it would be collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> But (2,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,5). So moving to (2,2) would cause head to collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body segment except the tail cell is deadly.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to head.\n> \n> So from (1,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (1,3)\n> \n> - Down: to (1,1)\n> \n> - Left: to (0,2) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: to (2,2) - occupied by body, and not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are Up to (1,3) or Down to (1,1).\n> \n> Now, (1,3) has food? Food positions: (1,3) and (1,5).\n> \n> (1,3) has food with value +1, life span 3.\n> \n> (1,5) has food with value +1, life span 8.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) is directly above (1,2), so moving up to (1,3) would eat the food there, since head moves to food cell.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, life span: food at (1,3) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 63, so for (1,3), life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 65? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 63, life span 3, so:\n> \n> - Turn 63: countdown to 2? Or at start of turn, life span is N, after the turn it decreases?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\" meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will be present at turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn: at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1, countdown N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, countdown 1, then at turn t+N, it disappears, so not present.\n> \n> For (1,3) at turn 63, life span 3, so it will be present on turns 63, 64, 65, and disappear on turn 66.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 8, so present from turn 63 to 70, disappear on turn 71.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves at turn 63: only U or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Up to (1,3). This would eat the food at (1,3), so snake grows by one segment. Score +1.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n> \n> Then, new head position: (1,3)\n> \n> Body: the current segments plus a new segment where the tail was, but since it grew, the tail stays, so the new body is the old body with head moved to (1,3), and tail remains, so positions: new head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), ..., up to (3,5), but since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> Standard: when food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions: head to (1,3), then the previous head (1,2) becomes second segment, then (2,2), etc., up to tail (3,5), and a new tail segment added at (3,5), but since tail stays, it's like adding a segment at the end.\n> \n> After move and eat: head at (1,3), followed by (1,2), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) — and since it grew, we add a new segment at (3,5)? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows: after moving the head to the food cell, the tail does not shorten; instead, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position remains, and the segment before it becomes the new something.\n> \n> Better: the snake moves forward: head to new cell, and if no food, tail is removed. If food, tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: after move to (1,3) and eat, the new positions are: head at (1,3), then the previous positions from index 1 to end, but since tail not removed, all segments are kept, with new head.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (1,2), 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), ..., 17: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving up to (1,3) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then segment 1: (1,2)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,2)  // was segment 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Segment 18: (3,5)  // was segment 17, tail\n> \n> - And since it grew, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at (3,5), and it doesn't move, so we add a new segment at (3,5)? That would duplicate.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, after moving head to new cell, the tail remains in place, so the body has one more segment. So the tail cell stays the same, but it's now part of the body, and the new tail is the same as before? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: [H, B, T] with H at some cell, B body, T tail.\n> \n> After moving without eating: new head at new position, new body [H_prev, B], new tail is the cell after B or depending.\n> \n> Better to think in terms of list.\n> \n> Initial positions: [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] where P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After moving to new cell N without food: new positions [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] so tail Pk is removed.\n> \n> With food: new positions [N, P0, P1, ..., Pk] so tail is still Pk, but Pk was the tail, now it's not the end, but since a new segment is added, the tail becomes Pk, but Pk was the last, so now it's [N, P0, P1, ..., Pk] and Pk is the tail.\n> \n> In this case, Pk was the tail, after growth, Pk is still there, and it becomes the second last, and the new tail is... no, the list is longer by one, so the new tail is Pk, but since we added after Pk, it's confusing.\n> \n> Clarify: when eating, the tail does not move, so the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, ..., old_tail] so the old tail is still the tail, but the list has one more element.\n> \n> For example, before: positions S = [A, B, C] A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to D with food: new head at D, then old head A, then B, then C, so [D, A, B, C] with C tail.\n> \n> C was tail, now C is still tail.\n> \n> If no food, move to D: [D, A, B] with B tail.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 18 segments, so positions list has 18 cells.\n> \n> After moving to (1,3) and eating: new positions: head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), ..., up to (3,5), so 19 segments, with tail still at (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) was the tail, and it remains the tail.\n> \n> Now, the head direction after moving up would be U.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 63, if we move up, we eat the food at (1,3).\n> \n> Option 2: Move Down to (1,1).

Let me confirm the coordinates. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) inclusive? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's list the snake positions to see: snake positions start from (1,3) down to (3,5). (1,3) to (3,5), and others like (6,1) etc. So yes, grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,3), direction U (up). But up would be decreasing y? Let's clarify coordinates. Typically in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up, but let's see the state.\n> \n> Direction U: (x,y+1). In the core rules, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases as we go up. But in the snake positions, head is at (1,3), and previous position is (1,2), since snake positions are head first: [(1,3), (1,2), ...]. So from (1,2) to (1,3), that's moving up if y increases upwards. But direction is given as U, which is consistent, moving from (1,2) to (1,3) with U.\n> \n> Now, food: two items.\n> \n> First food: (1,5) with life span 7, value 1. Format is (x,y, life_span, value)? In the state: \"(1, 5, 7, 1)\" and \"(4, 6, 10, 1)\". So (x,y, life_span, value). Value 1 means positive food, since +1.\n> \n> Second food: (4,6,10,1) also positive.\n> \n> Life span: first food disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 64, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 70?

No.\n> \n> Positions: head to (1,5), then the body segments are the previous positions without removing the tail.

No, the tail is now (4,6) or something.\n> \n> List indices: after moving without eating, we had 18 segments including head? Original snake has 19 segments.\n> \n> Initial: 19 positions.\n> \n> After moving without eating, we have 19 positions but tail changed? In my earlier, after moving to (1,4) without eating, we have head + 18 body segments, total 19, tail at (4,5).\n> \n> If we eat at (1,5), we add a segment, so total 20 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head at (1,5), then previous head (1,4) as first body, then (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), and the previous tail (4,5) stays, but we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before eating, but since tail didn't move, the new segment is added at (4,5), but (4,5) is already occupied? Confusion.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail didn't move, it's the same cell, so effectively, the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, head at new position, all body segments shift, and tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still there, and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> For example: before move, positions: A (head), B, C, ..., Y (tail)\n> \n> Move to new cell with food: new head at F (food), then A becomes body, B, C, ..., Y, and Y stays as tail, so the snake is A to Y plus F as head, but A is now body, so positions: F (head), A, B, C, ..., Y (tail). So the tail Y is still there, and we have one more segment.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell Y is occupied, and no new cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 65, if I move to (1,5) from (1,4), after turn 64 move to (1,4), at turn 65 head at (1,4), move to (1,5), eat food, so new head at (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)  // (4,5) is tail, and since we ate, we add a new segment, but where? The new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so before eating, tail was at (4,5), after eating, tail is still at (4,5), and we have an additional segment at (4,5)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard Snake mechanics: when the snake eats food, it grows by one segment. So when moving to a food cell, the head moves to that cell, and a new body segment is added at the tail position, but the tail does not move that turn. So the new segment is at the old tail position, and the tail remains there for that turn, so the snake has an extra segment.\n> \n> For example, suppose positions before move: head H, body B1, B2, ..., tail T.\n> \n> Move to food F: head moves to F, then the body: B1 moves to H, B2 to B1, ..., but when eating, the tail T does not move, so B_last moves to the position before T, and T stays, and a new segment is added at T, so the new tail is at T.\n> \n> Positions after eating: head at F, then B1 at old H, B2 at old B1, ..., Bk at old Bk-1, and tail at old T, and since tail didn't move, it's still T, but we add a new segment, so the body has one more segment.\n> \n> The sequence is: new head at F, then the first body segment is old head position, second body is old first body position, and so on, up to the old tail position, and then the new tail is the old tail position, but since the tail didn't move, it's the same cell, but it's now the second last, and the new last is the same cell? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think of the list.\n> \n> Before move: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]  length L.\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{L-2}]  tail is B_{L-2}, since T is removed.\n> \n> After moving to food cell: new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  length L+1, with tail at T.\n> \n> So the tail position doesn't change, but it is now part of the body, and the tail is still T, but in the list, T is the last element.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell T is occupied, and new_head is F.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 65, from (1,4) to (1,5), eat food, so new head at (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)  and tail at (4,5). So (4,5) is still tail, but now the snake is longer.\n> \n> Previously after move to (1,4), tail was at (4,5), after eating at (1,5), tail is still at (4,5), but the snake has 20 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, the food at (1,5) is consumed.\n> \n> Back to turn 64.\n> \n> At turn 64, head at (1,3), direction U.\n> \n> Move options: U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n> \n> If I move U to (1,4), then at turn 65, I can move U to (1,5) to eat food, or R to (2,4).\n> \n> If I move R to (2,3) at turn 64.\n> \n> Move R to (2,3), then head to (2,3), direction now R (since moved right).\n> \n> Then new positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) tail at (4,5)?

This maximizes score with minimal risk, ensuring long-term survival by not trapping the snake in the crowded bottom-left area.\n",

It's turn 65. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (5,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then body segments: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). Let me list these to visualize.\n> \n> Head: (1,4) facing Up. Since it's facing Up, moving Up would increase y, so to (1,5).\n> \n> Food: two items.\n> \n> - (1,5) with life_span=6, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,6) with life_span=9, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so we can only be in x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake body: starting from head (1,4), then:\n> \n> - (1,3) below it\n> \n> - (1,2) below that\n> \n> - (2,2) right of (1,2)\n> \n> - (3,2) right\n> \n> - (3,1) down\n> \n> - (4,1) right\n> \n> - (5,1) right\n> \n> - (6,1) right\n> \n> - (6,2) up\n> \n> - (6,3) up\n> \n> - (6,4) up\n> \n> - (5,4) left\n> \n> - (5,5) up\n> \n> - (6,5) right\n> \n> - (6,6) up\n> \n> - (5,6) left\n> \n> - (4,6) left\n> \n> - (4,5) down\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, food at (1,5) and (4,6).\n> \n> (1,5) is directly above the head at (1,4), since head is at (1,4) facing Up. Moving Up would go to (1,5), which has food.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> First, life_span: (1,5) has life_span=6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 65, it will disappear at turn 65 + 6 - 1? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span=N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to t+N-1.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span N, meaning it will disappear after N turns, so it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,5) at turn 65, life_span=6, so it exists until turn 65+5=70? Turn t: life_span N, after this turn, life_span becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten while life_span > 0.\n> \n> At turn 65, life_span=6, so after turn 65, it becomes 5, then 4, etc., down to 0 at turn 70, disappearing after turn 70. So it can be eaten from turn 65 to 70 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life_span decreases by 1. If life_span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if the head moves to the food cell during a turn, it is eaten at that turn.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,5) at turn 65, life_span=6, so it can be eaten on turns 65,66,67,68,69, and if not eaten by turn 69, after turn 69 it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 70.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) life_span=9, so available until turn 65+8=73? Turn 65: L=9, after turn 65: L=8, ..., after turn 73: L=0, disappear. So can be eaten from turn 65 to 73.\n> \n> Now, back to the immediate move. Head at (1,4), facing Up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. Cannot move Down next turn. So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, moving Up to (1,5): that has food, positive food. But is it safe?\n> \n> There's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Tail is at (4,5). Head is at (1,4), which is not adjacent to (4,5). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonally apart or not directly adjacent.\n> \n> Distance: |1-4|=3 in x, |4-5|=1 in y, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be same x or y, diff 1.\n> \n> So head at (1,4) adjacent to: (1,3) down, (1,5) up, (2,4) right, (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so not. Left is x=0, wall, so only possible adjacent: down (1,3), up (1,5), right (2,4).\n> \n> (1,3) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is at (4,5), which is far.\n> \n> So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> If I move Up to (1,5), I eat the food, snake grows by one, so new head at (1,5), and tail stays where it is? No, when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail remains in place, meaning the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> In terms of movement: normally, each turn, head moves to a new cell, and tail moves one cell, so if no food, length same. If food eaten, head moves to food, tail does not move, so new segment added at the head position.\n> \n> After eating, the snake is longer, and the tail is the same as before until the next move.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,5) and eat food, head is now at (1,5), and the previous tail remains, so the new tail is still (4,5)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)] with (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving Up to (1,5) and eating food: head moves to (1,5), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)] so tail is still (4,5), but now there are 20 segments? Before: 19 positions, so length 19. After eating, length 20, with tail at (4,5).\n> \n> But (4,5) is still there, and head at (1,5), no collision.\n> \n> But is there a body collision? (1,5) is the new head position. Was (1,5) occupied before? No, food is at (1,5), and it's not part of the body. Body positions are given, (1,5) is not in the list, so it's free, so moving to (1,5) is safe, no collision.\n> \n> Then, after eating, the snake is longer.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> There is another food at (4,6), which is currently occupied by the snake? Let's see: (4,6) is in the positions? Snake positions: ... (4,6), (4,5)... yes, (4,6) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) with value 1, life_span 9.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Currently, (4,6) is occupied by a body segment, so the food is under it, I think. Food positions include (4,6), but (4,6) is also a snake body cell.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (4,6), it is currently covered by the snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move such that the body is no longer at (4,6), and then the head moves to (4,6).\n> \n> In this case, (4,6) is not the tail; it's somewhere in the middle. The segment at (4,6) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Let's see the order: positions: index 0: head (1,4), then 1: (1,3), 2: (1,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (6,1), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,4), 12: (5,4), 13: (5,5), 14: (6,5), 15: (6,6), 16: (5,6), 17: (4,6), 18: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So (4,6) is position 17, which is not the tail; tail is 18: (4,5).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail position is abandoned unless food is eaten.\n> \n> For (4,6), it is occupied by segment 17. When the snake moves, segment 17 will move to where segment 16 was, but only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for the body to move away from (4,6), it means that in some future turn, when the segment that was at (4,6) moves to another cell, then (4,6) becomes free, and then if head moves there, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,6) with life_span 9, so it has time.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,5), it's available now.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move.\n> \n> Options: U to (1,5) to eat food, or L to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so cannot move left. x=0 is wall, so from (1,4), moving left to (0,4) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (1,3) but (1,3) is the body segment directly behind head, so moving down would collide with body. Also, cannot move down because opposite direction? Current direction is U, moving down is opposite, which is not allowed. Cannot move opposite on next turn.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, R (right to (2,4)), or L, but L is wall, so only U and R are possible? Moving left: (1,4) left is (0,4), which is wall, so invalid. Moving down: body collision and opposite direction, invalid. So only possible moves: Up or Right.\n> \n> Up to (1,5) or Right to (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is not occupied; looking at positions, (2,4) is not listed, so it's free. Walls: (5,2) blocked, but (2,4) is fine.\n> \n> So choices: move Up to (1,5) to eat food, or move Right to (2,4) to avoid eating for now.\n> \n> But since both foods are positive, eating is good, but need to consider long-term.\n> \n> If I move Up to (1,5), I eat the food, grow to length 20, head at (1,5) facing Up (since I moved U, direction becomes U).\n> \n> Then next moves: from (1,5), possible moves U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction, which is U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Also, U to (1,6), which is y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is border? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, so (1,6) is possible.\n> \n> L to (0,5) wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,5), possible.\n> \n> D to (1,4), but (1,4) is now the second segment after moving, so if I move D to (1,4), it would be body collision.\n> \n> After moving to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), etc.\n> \n> So (1,4) is occupied by the neck, so moving down to (1,4) would collide.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (0,5) wall.\n> \n> So from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), or R to (2,5).\n> \n> (1,6) is free? Not in positions, and not wall, so yes.\n> \n> (2,5) also free.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,6), then head at (1,6), which is near top wall.\n> \n> Then from there, U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (0,6) wall.\n> \n> R to (2,6).\n> \n> D to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body, collision.\n> \n> So only R to (2,6) or D, but D to (1,5) collision, so only R possible? Moves from (1,6): U invalid, L invalid, D to (1,5) body, R to (2,6) possible.\n> \n> (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> But then I'm at (1,6) with only one move possible, to (2,6).\n> \n> Then from (2,6), similar, U to (2,7) wall, L to (1,6) body, D to (2,5), R to (3,6), etc.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> If I move right from (1,5) to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go various places.\n> \n> But let's consider not eating the food now.\n> \n> If I move right from (1,4) to (2,4), no food eaten.\n> \n> Then head at (2,4), direction right (since moved R).\n> \n> Positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,3), etc., tail moves? No food, so tail moves to the previous position of segment 1 or something. When no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed from old position.\n> \n> After moving to (2,4): positions [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] and tail was (4,5), which is removed, so positions now 18 segments?

It's turn 66, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (2,4), then body segments follow: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). That's 19 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> The head direction is R, meaning right, so the snake is moving east.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - One at (1,5) with value 1 and life span 5. Since life span decreases every turn including current, and current turn is 66, it will disappear after turn 70 (66 + 5 - 1? Life span is 5, so it appears for 5 turns, from when it spawns. But here, it's given at turn 66 with life span 5, so it will last until turn 70? Let me clarify the life span rule.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L, on the turn it's reported, it has L turns left including this turn. After L turns, it disappears. So for (1,5), life span 5 at turn 66, it will be available on turns 66,67,68,69, and disappear after turn 70? Let's think: on turn 66, countdown is 5, meaning 5 turns including this one. So after 5 turns, it's gone. Turn 66: countdown 5, turn 67: countdown 4, ..., turn 70: countdown 1? I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now. But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" suggests that on turn t, if life span is L, then on turn t, countdown = L, on turn t+1, countdown = L-1, ..., on turn t+L-1, countdown=1, and it disappears after that, so not available on turn t+L. For example, at turn 66, life span 5, so available until turn 70 (since 66 to 70 is 5 turns: 66,67,68,69,70). But on turn 70, countdown would be 1, and after turn 70, it disappears, so not on turn 71.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food is at (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8, so available from turn 66 to turn 73 (66+8-1=73? Let's calculate: turn 66: life span 8, so countdown 8 on turn 66, 7 on 67, ..., 1 on 73, disappears after 73, so available turns 66 to 73 inclusive.\n> \n> But (4,6) is also a position in the snake body. Snake positions include (4,6), which is the tail? Let's list snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (2,4) head\n> \n> 1: (1,4)\n> \n> 2: (1,3)\n> \n> 3: (1,2)\n> \n> 4: (2,2)\n> \n> 5: (3,2)\n> \n> 6: (3,1)\n> \n> 7: (4,1)\n> \n> 8: (5,1)\n> \n> 9: (6,1)\n> \n> 10: (6,2)\n> \n> 11: (6,3)\n> \n> 12: (6,4)\n> \n> 13: (5,4)\n> \n> 14: (5,5)\n> \n> 15: (6,5)\n> \n> 16: (6,6)\n> \n> 17: (5,6)\n> \n> 18: (4,6)  <-- this is the tail, since it's the last one.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8. But (4,6) is currently occupied by the tail of the snake. The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food is at (4,6), which is the tail position. But currently, the head is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to (4,6). Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), tail at (4,6). Distance: |2-4| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> (2,4) to (4,6): not adjacent; (2,4) to (3,4) would be right, but (3,4) is not a position; snake has (2,4), (1,4), etc.\n> \n> Current head position (2,4), possible moves: since head direction is R (right), I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but no instant reverse, so since last move was R (to (2,4)? Head direction is given as R, meaning it just moved right to (2,4), I think. Snake positions: previous head was at (1,4) I assume, since after head is (1,4), so it moved from (1,4) to (2,4), direction R.\n> \n> So current direction is R, so I can move U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible actions from (2,4):\n> \n> - U: (2,5)\n> \n> - D: (2,3)\n> \n> - R: (3,4)\n> \n> - L: (1,4) but (1,4) is the body, so collision, and also reverse is not allowed, so L is invalid.\n> \n> Reverse not allowed only if it's opposite direction, but L is opposite to R, so cannot move L. Also, (1,4) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Now, check for walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> (2,5) is y=5, within 0-7, x=2 within 0-7, not wall.\n> \n> (2,3) similarly.\n> \n> (3,4) should be fine.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,5) and (4,6)\n> \n> (1,5) is at x=1,y=5. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), but not (1,5), so it's free, I think. But food can be under body, but here it's not listed in snake positions except the tail one.\n> \n> (1,5) is not in snake positions, so it should be accessible.\n> \n> (4,6) is the tail position, so food is there, but since tail is on it, I need to move away first.\n> \n> But for now, head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Draw a grid:\n> \n> y=7: top\n> \n> y=0: bottom\n> \n> x=0 left, x=7 right\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (5,2), so (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,4)\n> \n> Body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (1,5): value +1, life span 5, so available turns 66 to 70 (since at turn 66, countdown=5, to turn 70 countdown=1, disappears after turn 70).\n> \n> - (4,6): value +1, but this is where tail is, and life span 8, so available turns 66 to 73.\n> \n> But since tail is on (4,6), to eat it, the tail must move away, and then head move to it.\n> \n> Now, tail will move when snake moves, but only if it doesn't grow.\n> \n> If I eat food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> To eat food under body, body must move away first.\n> \n> For (4,6), which is tail, if I move such that tail moves, then (4,6) is free, but food is there, so if head moves to (4,6) after tail moves, I can eat it.\n> \n> But there's a danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and tail at same position? No.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> When you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at tail.\n> \n> But if the head is on a food that was under the tail, and head moves to it just after tail moves, it should be fine, but the danger is when head is adjacent to tail, and you eat the food on the tail cell, meaning you move head to the tail position while it's still there? I think I need to read carefully.\n> \n> The rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Scenario: suppose tail is at position T, and T has food. Head is at H adjacent to T. If I move head to T, I eat the food, so snake grows. Since I ate food, the tail doesn't move; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is added. But when I move head to T, T was occupied by tail, so if I move to T, head collides with tail, dies immediately? Or after growth.\n> \n> The rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows: the head moves to T, eats food, so now the tail remains, and since it grew, the tail doesn't move. But T was the tail position, now head is at T, and tail is still at T? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, first the head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, it eats it, and the tail does not move, so snake grows by one. If no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell that had food, and it was under tail, but when head moves there, the tail might have moved or not.\n> \n> In this case, for the food on tail cell: at the start, tail is at T with food. If head is adjacent to T, and I move head to T, then: head moves to T, which has food, so it eats it, and since it ate, tail does not move. But T was occupied by tail, so when head moves to T, it collides with the tail segment, so it dies before even growing? Or after.\n> \n> The rule specifies that it kills because of collision with newly grown tail, but let's read: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" After growth, the head is at the food position, and the tail is still there? I think there's confusion.\n> \n> Perhaps: when you eat food, the tail stays in place, so if head moves to where tail is, it's collision.\n> \n> But in this scenario, if head moves to the tail position, and tail is there, collision happens upon movement, before eating.\n> \n> The rule says \"eating it kills\", so it implies that the eating action causes death due to the growth.\n> \n> I think it's safer to avoid moving to the tail position if it has food and head is adjacent.\n> \n> In this state, head at (2,4), tail at (4,6), not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves for turn 66 and beyond.\n> \n> First, available food:\n> \n> - (1,5): close to head, at (1,5), head at (2,4), so adjacent?

Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,5)\n> \n> Body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (1,5) – this is at row 1, column 5? Coordinates are (x,y), so (1,5) is x=1, y=5.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) x=4,y=6; (6,4) x=6,y=4.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,5)\n> \n> Head direction is U, so it was moving up to (2,5) from (2,4)? Snake positions list is head first: [(2,5), (2,4), ...] so from previous move, it was at (2,4) and moved up to (2,5). So current direction is U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5): since it can't move opposite to current direction instantly, but current direction is U, so opposite is D (down). So it cannot move down immediately. Allowed moves: U, L, R. But U would be to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (2,6): what is there? From snake positions, (6,6) is a body part, but (2,6) is not listed, so should be empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake cells:\n> \n> (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n> \n> And walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2)\n> \n> Now, (2,6): not in snake, not wall? Walls are borders, so y=7 is wall, but (2,6) is y=6, which is not wall. x=2, y=6 is within 1 to 6, so it should be free, except for the internal obstacle which is at (5,2), not here. So (2,6) is empty.\n> \n> (1,5): food is there, and it's not occupied by snake? Snake has (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), but not (1,5). (1,5) is a food position. But is it under snake? Snake positions don't include (1,5), so it's not under snake, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> But (3,5) might be empty or have food? No food at (3,5), only at (1,5), (4,6), (6,4).\n> \n> Food at (1,5), which is adjacent left.\n> \n> Also, (2,6) is empty.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (1,5) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns including current turn 67. So if not eaten by turn 70, it's gone. Since it appears at turn 67, and life span decreases each turn, so after turn 67, life span 3 left; turn 68, 2; turn 69, 1; turn 70, 0, gone. So must be eaten by turn 69 to get it? When is it eaten? If head moves to it on turn t, it's eaten on that turn.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 67, life span is 4, meaning it can be eaten on turns 67,68,69,70? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 67, food at (1,5) has life span 4, so it exists on turns 67,68,69, and disappears after turn 70? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn 67, countdown=4; after turn 67, it becomes 3; after turn 68, 2; after turn 69, 1; after turn 70, 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >=1, so turns 67,68,69,70? But on turn 70, if eaten before disappearing, but disappearing after the turn.\n> \n> Typically, food is available during turns when life span >0.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn t, if life span >0, food is present and can be eaten during that turn.\n> \n> For (1,5): life span 4 at turn 67, so available turns: 67,68,69,70. Disappears after turn 70.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): life span 7, available turns 67 to 73.\n> \n> (6,4): life span 10, available turns 67 to 76.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (2,5) at turn 67.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), direction U.\n> \n> Can move: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n> \n> (1,5) has food, positive.\n> \n> But need to check if eating it is safe.\n> \n> First, if move L to (1,5), eat food, snake grows, so new head at (1,5), and tail stays? When eat, length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so the head moves to the food, but the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the head position.\n> \n> After eating, the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Then, the tail moves as usual in subsequent turns.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (1,5), the new positions would be: head at (1,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes body, and so on, tail at (5,6) still, but since length increased, when we move next, the tail moves.\n> \n> But need to check for collisions.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (5,6), which is far, and no food on tail.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) is not on tail.\n> \n> But after moving to (1,5), what is the state.\n> \n> Current snake: positions from head to tail: (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n> \n> After moving left to (1,5): head moves to (1,5), which has food, so eat it, length increases to 20. So the new body: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), ... up to tail (5,6). Since we ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] — 20 positions.\n> \n> Now, is there collision? Head at (1,5), body segments: the next is (2,5), which is adjacent but not same cell, so no collision. (1,5) and (2,5) are different cells. (1,5) might have been occupied? But since we moved there and ate food, it should be fine.\n> \n> But (1,5) was not occupied before, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, after this, the head is at (1,5), and direction was U but we moved L, so new direction is L? Direction is the last moved direction.\n> \n> In state, head direction is given, and we choose action, which sets new direction.\n> \n> After moving L, head direction becomes L.\n> \n> Now, possible next moves from (1,5) at turn 68.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; we need to think sequence.\n> \n> First, option to go to (1,5) now.\n> \n> But is there risk?\n> \n> Another thing: the snake has a segment at (1,4), which is below (1,5), so (1,5) and (1,4) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> After moving to (1,5), the body includes (1,4), but (1,4) is not adjacent to head directly? Head at (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), ... so (1,4) is two steps away, not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (1,5): up (1,6), down (1,4), left — but x=0 is wall, so left not possible, right (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is the first body segment, so moving right to (2,5) would cause collision, since it's a body cell.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (1,4) would be to a body cell, collision.\n> \n> Moving up to (1,6): is that free?\n> \n> (1,6): y=6, which is not wall, x=1, not wall. Snake positions: (5,6) and (6,6) are at y=6, but (1,6) not occupied, so free? Let's see all y=6 cells: snake has (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), all at x=5 or 6, y=6 or 5. (1,6) not occupied, so should be free.\n> \n> Also, no food there.\n> \n> So from (1,5), after eating, possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, collision, L not possible (wall), R to (2,5) body, collision. So only possible move is U to (1,6).\n> \n> Is that right? (1,4) is a body segment, so moving down to (1,4) would be head touching body, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, right to (2,5) is body.\n> \n> Left is wall.\n> \n> So only up to (1,6) is safe.\n> \n> Then at turn 68, if we moved to (1,5) at turn 67, then at turn 68 we must move U to (1,6).\n> \n> Then head at (1,6), direction U.\n> \n> Now from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 is wall, so not possible. D to (1,5) but (1,5) is now body? After moving to (1,6), the snake moves.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 67: start, head at (2,5), move L to (1,5), eat food, grow to 20 segments: positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), ..., tail (5,6)\n> \n> Now turn 68: move U to (1,6). Since no food at (1,6), just move, tail moves away.\n> \n> When moving without eating, tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> So after move: head to (1,6), then body: (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), ... up to?

So moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body, since that cell is occupied and won't be vacated; the tail is at (6,6), moving somewhere.\n> \n> When you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so cells that were body might be vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, for a move to be valid, the head must not move into a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, and even the tail is only safe if after moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, for turn 68, moving L to (2,5): (2,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the head moves to (2,5), and the body shifts, so the segment that was at (2,5) moves to... let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), etc.\n> \n> After moving, if head moves to a new cell, say to (3,6) for U, then new head is (3,6), and the body shifts: segment 1 moves to where head was, (3,5), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (2,5), and so on, tail moves from (6,6) to where the second last was.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied, it must be the tail cell, and only if it's the tail and we're not growing.\n> \n> If we eat food, we grow, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for collision: moving to a cell that is occupied by a body segment other than the tail will cause collision, because that segment is still there when head arrives.\n> \n> Moving to the tail cell is safe only if we don't eat food, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving L to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail. So if head moves to (2,5), it collides with segment 1, which is still there. So death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Now, what about (3,6)? Is it occupied? Let's see the positions: (3,6) is not in the list, so free? But we have to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (5,2). So (3,6) is x=3,y=6, which is within 1-6, not wall, not in snake positions? Positions: head (3,5), others: (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6). (3,6) not listed, so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): not listed, empty.\n> \n> (4,5): not listed, but moving R would be to (4,5)? Head at (3,5), direction R, so R would be to (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) not in positions, so should be free.\n> \n> But possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> L to (2,5) is occupied, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> R to (4,5): let's see if (4,5) is free. Positions: we have (5,5) and (6,5), but (4,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> D to (3,4): not listed, free.\n> \n> U to (3,6): free.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is R, so cannot move L on next turn? But for this turn, we can choose any direction except that we just came from, but the no instant reverse is for consecutive turns.\n> \n> The constraint: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> It says \"on next turn\", meaning from the current state.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, which is the direction it was moving to get to current position. So from (2,5) to (3,5) moving right.\n> \n> Now for turn 68, we can choose action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> But moving L would be opposite to current direction, which is reverse.\n> \n> The rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> \"next turn\" might be ambiguous. Let me read.\n> \n> \"In each turn you can choose to move... No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> I think it means that when you are deciding the move for the current turn, you cannot choose the opposite direction of the current movement direction.\n> \n> For example, current direction is R, so you cannot move L for this turn, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Similarly, if direction is U, cannot move D, etc.\n> \n> In this case, direction is R, so we cannot move L for turn 68. So L is invalid anyway, even if it were free.\n> \n> So for turn 68, possible actions: U, D, R (since L is reverse and also occupied).\n> \n> Now, moving to (2,5) is occupied and reverse, so definitely invalid.\n> \n> So valid moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 70 or it disappears.\n> \n> - (4,6) value 1, life span 6, eat by turn 73.\n> \n> - (6,4) value 1, life span 9, eat by turn 76.\n> \n> Also, note that (6,4) is a food position, but in snake positions, we have (6,4) as a body segment? Snake positions include (6,4), which is segment 14? Let's list positions with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (3,5)\n> \n> 1: (2,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,4)\n> \n> 3: (1,4)\n> \n> 4: (1,3)\n> \n> 5: (1,2)\n> \n> 6: (2,2)\n> \n> 7: (3,2)\n> \n> 8: (3,1)\n> \n> 9: (4,1)\n> \n> 10: (5,1)\n> \n> 11: (6,1)\n> \n> 12: (6,2)\n> \n> 13: (6,3)\n> \n> 14: (6,4)  // food at (6,4) is here, but it's occupied by body\n> \n> 15: (5,4)\n> \n> 16: (5,5)\n> \n> 17: (6,5)\n> \n> 18: tail (6,6)\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is listed, but it's currently under the snake body at segment 14.\n> \n> The food mechanics: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after growing, head and new tail collide.\n> \n> For (6,4) food, it's under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away first, then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, (1,5) food: at (1,5), which is not occupied by snake?

Positions: after move, the tail end: segment 18 (tail) at (6,6), when head moves, tail moves to (6,5) if not growing, since segment 17 is at (6,5), so new tail at (6,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away from its position, so the cell that was tail is vacated, unless we eat food and grow.\n> \n> For now, no eating, so when head moves to (3,6), the new positions: head (3,6), then the previous positions but shifted: the first body segment is now at (3,5), then at (2,5), then (2,4), ... up to segment 17 at (6,5), and tail was at (6,6), but since tail moves, the new tail is at (6,5), and (6,6) is vacated? No.\n> \n> The positions list: after moving, the new head is at the new position, then the body is the old head, then old segment 1, etc., but the last segment, tail, is removed if not growing.\n> \n> So old positions: 0:(3,5), 1:(2,5), 2:(2,4), ..., 17:(6,5), 18:(6,6)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,6) without eating, new positions: head at (3,6), then body: old 0 at (3,5), old 1 at (2,5), old 2 at (2,4), ..., old 17 at (6,5), and old 18 (tail) at (6,6) is not included, so new tail is at old 17 position (6,5). So (6,6) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in this case, after move U to (3,6), new head (3,6), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)  -- tail at (6,5), since old tail (6,6) is gone.\n> \n> Old segment 17 was (6,5), now it's the new tail.\n> \n> Now, from (3,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), D to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, so collision and reverse, invalid.

Standard: when you eat, the head moves to food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move, and the new position list includes the tail still.\n> \n> For example, old positions before move: head (3,6), body (3,5), etc., tail (6,5)\n> \n> After moving to (4,6) and eating, new head (4,6), then body: old head (3,6), old body (3,5), (2,5), ..., up to old tail (6,5), and since growing, the tail stays, so new positions include all old segments plus the new head, so tail is still (6,5), but it's not the end, the end is the same as before?

It's turn 69, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) but walls are the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So, the grid is 8x8, but the borders are walls, so valid positions are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's see the snake positions: (3,6), (3,5), etc. (3,6) is y=6, which is not y=7, so y=6 is playable? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 are playable? y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall, so y=1 to y=6 are inside. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> But snake has (3,6), and walls are y=0/y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's the top row but not wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> Also internal obstacle: (5,2). So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), with direction U (up). But if it's moving up, and head is at (3,6), moving up would be to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so it can't move up? Let's see.\n> \n> Head at (3,6), direction U. But y=7 is wall, so moving up to (3,7) is impossible. But the direction is given as U, which might be the current facing, but since it can't move up, it must choose another direction? No, the direction is the current head direction, and for movement, I need to choose an action that is not opposite, but it can choose other directions.\n> \n> The action I choose must not be the opposite of current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down immediately, but I can move left, right, or... up is impossible, so only L or R possible? Or down, but down is opposite? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Current head direction is U. So for the next move, I cannot choose D because it's opposite. But since moving U is to wall, it's invalid anyway. So possible moves from (3,6): U is to (3,7) which is wall, invalid. D is to (3,5), but D is opposite to current U, so I cannot choose D because of no instant reverse rule.

(3,5) is the second segment, which is the neck. Since the snake moves, if I move down to (3,5), that's where the neck is, but after move, the head would be at (3,5), and the neck will move to next position, but initially, (3,5) is occupied, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> General rule: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its current cell, unless it eats food and grows.\n> \n> If the head moves to a cell occupied by the body, it dies, except for the tail cell. Because when head moves to tail cell, the tail moves away at the same time, so it's safe, but only if no food is eaten or something. Let's see the rules.\n> \n> From core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So moving to (3,5) would be head colliding with body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) and (4,6) are not in snake positions, so might be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,6) is x=2,y=6, which is within 1-6, so not wall. Internal obstacle (5,2), not relevant here.\n> \n> So (2,6) and (4,6) should be free, unless there's food or something, but for movement, as long as not wall or occupied by body except tail.\n> \n> (2,6) and (4,6) are not in snake positions, so moving to (2,6) or (4,6) should be safe, as long as not wall, which they aren't.\n> \n> Now, down to (3,5) is occupied and not tail, so invalid.\n> \n> Up is wall.\n> \n> So possible actions from (3,6) with current dir U: I can choose L or R, since D is opposite and also occupied.\n> \n> D is opposite, so I cannot choose D anyway because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> So only possible actions are L or R.\n> \n> Action L: move to (2,6)\n> \n> Action R: move to (4,6)\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,5) value 1, life_span 2\n> \n> - (4,6) value 1, life_span 5\n> \n> - (6,4) value 1, life_span 8\n> \n> All positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Life_span: (1,5) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=69, so for food at (1,5), life_span=2, so at turn 69, it has 2 turns left, then after turn 69, it decreases to 1, and after turn 70, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 69 or 70, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) life_span=5, so available for 5 turns: 69,70,71,72,73.\n> \n> (6,4) life_span=8, available turns 69 to 76.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,6), and one food is at (4,6), which is directly right from head.

Original 19, head moved to new cell, no food, so length same, tail removed, so should be 18 segments? Let's count: original list has 19 elements.

No: the body has 18 elements, but each is a segment, so with head, 19 segments. Original was 19, moved to new cell, no food, tail removed, so length decreases? No, when no food eaten, snake moves, head to new cell, tail removed, so length same. Original length 19, after move, still 19 segments? But in positions, head was at (3,6), now at (2,6), and tail removed, so the new set has 19 segments but different positions.\n> \n> Count the new list: head (2,6) and 18 body segments, so 19 segments.

span (7 turns), moving right then down twice to safely consume it after the cell is vacated, avoiding tail reward danger. Post-consumption, moving left twice (turns 74-75) navigates toward the left side to set up for potential consumption of the longer-life food at (1,2) while steering clear of the obstacle at (5,2) and minimizing collision risks for long-term survival.\n",

The format says: (x,y, value, life_span) but in the input it's written as (6,4,6,1) – let me read:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (6, 4, 6, 1)\n> - (1, 2, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> This might be inconsistent. Probably it's (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? The core rules say: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) but in the state input, it's listed as (6,4,6,1) which has four numbers. I think there might be a mistake.\n> \n> Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\n> - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> - ( (x2,y2), value2, life_span2 )\"\n> \n> But in the current state, it's written as: (6,4,6,1) and (1,2,8,1). So probably, for the first one, x=6, y=4, and then 6 is life_span, 1 is value? Or value 6 and life_span 1? That doesn't make sense because value should be +1 or -1 for positive or negative food.\n> \n> Core rules: positive food value +1, negative food value -1.\n> \n> Here it says value and life span, but in the input it's numbers like 6 and 1. Let me see: (6,4,6,1) – likely, this is (x,y, life_span, value). Because life_span is 6, value is 1 for positive. Similarly, (1,2,8,1) is x=1,y=2, life_span=8, value=1.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So:\n> \n> - Food at (6,4): positive, value +1, life_span 6 turns (disappears after 6 turns, including current turn)\n> \n> - Food at (1,2): positive, value +1, life_span 8 turns\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: list is [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> Head at (6,6), tail at (5,4). The snake has 20 segments.\n> \n> Direction is R, so moving right. But at (6,6), moving right would go to (7,6), but x=7 is a wall, so that's impossible. Current head direction is R, but at (6,6), moving right to (7,6) is invalid because x=7 is wall. But the snake is at (6,6), and direction is R, so it must have just moved there or something? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), etc. So from (5,6) to (6,6), it moved right to (6,6). Now at turn 72, head is at (6,6), direction R, so it came from left, and is facing right.\n> \n> But now, possible moves: since direction is R, it can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite). But moving R to (7,6) is wall, so not possible. Moving U to (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so also impossible. Moving D to (6,5).\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so (6,7) is invalid. x=7 is wall, so (7,6) invalid.\n> \n> So from (6,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - D: (6,5) – is that free? Need to check if it's not occupied by snake or wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (5,2).\n> \n> (6,5) is within bounds, x=6, y=5, not wall.\n> \n> Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> (6,5) is not in the list, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, L: left to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body, the second segment. But according to movement constraints, moving into body is deadly, except for the tail.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (5,6) is not the tail; tail is (5,4). So (5,6) is a body segment, so moving left to (5,6) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (7,6) wall, U to (6,7) wall.\n> \n> So only possible move from (6,6) is D to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Current position: (6,6)\n> \n> Directions:\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) - y=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) - not wall, not in snake positions? Snake positions: (6,6) is head, (5,6), (4,6), etc. (6,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Left: (5,6) - occupied by snake body (second segment), so collision if move there.\n> \n> - Right: (7,6) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is Down to (6,5).\n> \n> But the direction is given as R, which is consistent with coming from left.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (6,4) with life_span 6, value +1. Current turn 72, so it disappears after 6 turns, meaning it will be gone at turn 78? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 72, life_span=6, after turn 72, it becomes 5, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 77? Let's see: if life_span N, it disappears after N turns, including current. So at turn t, if life_span L, it has L turns left including t. After t, L-1, and when L=0 after the turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span N, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, it decreases to N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0, and after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> It can be eaten on any turn from t to t + N - 1, but not after.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N, it exists during turn t. After the snake moves on turn t, if it eats, it consumes the food. Then at the end of turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> Similarly, if not eaten, after turn t, life_span becomes N-1 for turn t+1.\n> \n> So for food at (6,4), life_span 6 at turn 72. So it can be eaten on turns 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77. After turn 77, it disappears (since after turn 77, life_span would be 0 or negative? At turn 72: life_span 6\n> \n> After turn 72: if not eaten, life_span becomes 5 for turn 73\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 77: life_span becomes 0, and food disappears, so not available on turn 78.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,2) life_span 8 at turn 72, so can be eaten up to turn 79.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,6), must move down to (6,5) this turn, as only option.\n> \n> Then from there, I need to plan.\n> \n> But let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list coordinates to visualize.\n> \n> Head: (6,6)\n> \n> Then: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), then down to (3,5), (2,5), left?

(3,1), then right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), then left to (5,4) for tail.\n> \n> Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4) and (1,2).\n> \n> (6,4) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (6,4), which is the 19th segment? Positions: index 0: (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,2), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (3,1), 13: (4,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (6,1), 16: (6,2), 17: (6,3), 18: (6,4), 19: (5,4) — so (6,4) is position 18, which is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is on the same cell as a body segment. But according to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (6,4) has food and snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (6,4), and later head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,2): snake has segment at (1,2), position 9. So also under body.\n> \n> (1,2) is occupied by snake, and food is there.\n> \n> So both foods are under snake body.\n> \n> To eat them, we need to move the snake so that those cells are vacated and then head can move there.\n> \n> Now, for turn 72, head at (6,6), must move down to (6,5) as only option.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5), new head position (6,5), direction down?

Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0 to 19: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> After moving down to (6,5): head to (6,5), so new head (6,5). The body: since no food eaten, tail moves, so the segment at (5,4) is removed. The new body starts from the old head position (6,6) which is now body, followed by (5,6), (4,6), ..., down to (6,4), but (6,4) was position 18, and (5,4) was 19 removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,5), then body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Now, (6,4) is the last body segment, tail.\n> \n> And food at (6,4) is still there, but now under the tail?

No.\n> \n> Rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n> 1. The body moves away, and\n> 2.

If head moves down to (6,4), it would be moving to the tail cell with food. Since the tail is there, and we move head to it, we eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (6,4), and instead of tail moving, a new segment is added, so the tail remains at (6,4) while head is also at (6,4), so immediate collision.\n> \n> Yes, so it's deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, we cannot eat the food at (6,4) when the head is adjacent to the tail and the food is on the tail cell.\n> \n> In this position, after turn 72 move to (6,5), head and tail are adjacent, and food is on tail cell, so moving to (6,4) would be fatal.\n> \n> Therefore, we must avoid moving to (6,4) for now.\n> \n> Now, from (6,5), possible moves: direction is now D (since we moved down).\n> \n> So current direction D.\n> \n> Can move: U (up, opposite, not allowed), D (down), L (left), R (right).

When adding, the tail position remains, but since new segment added, the tail is still (6,3), but now it's not the end; the segment before it becomes tail? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move; a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position becomes a new body segment, and the previous tail position is now occupied, but the tail itself is extended, so the new tail is the segment that was second last.\n> \n> Example: suppose positions: A-B-C-D, tail D.\n> \n> Head moves to E with food, so new positions: E-A-B-C-D, and since grow, add new segment at D, so it becomes E-A-B-C-D-D, but that's not right.\n> \n> Typically, the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added there, so the snake becomes longer with tail fixed.\n> \n> So from positions: [head, body..., tail]\n> \n> After move without eat: head new, body includes old head, tail removed.\n> \n> After move with eat: head new, body includes old head, tail remains, so new segment added at tail position.\n> \n> So positions: new head, then old head, then rest of body, then tail (unchanged), but since tail didn't move, and new segment added, it's like the tail segment is duplicated? No.\n> \n> In terms of list: suppose before: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]\n> \n> After move to new cell E with food: new head E, then old head H becomes first body, then B1, B2, ..., Bk, T, and since eat, add new segment at T, so new positions: [E, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] with T now being the new tail? No, T is still there, and we add a new segment at T, so it's [E, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T, T] but that means two segments at T, which is wrong.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard implementation: when snake eats food, on the move, head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not advance; so the body gains one segment.\n> \n> So the new position list: the new head is the food cell, then the previous head, then the previous body segments, and the tail remains as is, so the length increases by one, with tail unchanged.\n> \n> For example: positions [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After moving to E with food: [E, H, B1, B2] and T is still there, but since tail didn't move, B2 becomes the new tail? Positions: new head E, then H (now first body), then B1 (second body), then B2 (now third body), and T is still tail, so [E, H, B1, B2], but T was tail, now B2 is the last, so tail is B2.\n> \n> Since tail didn't move, the segment that was tail is still there, but the last segment is now the previous one.\n> \n> In list terms: after move with eat, the new list is [new_head, old_head, body..., old_tail] and the old_tail is now the new last segment, so tail position is the same, but since we added a new segment, the tail cell is occupied by the new segment.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better not to overcomplicate.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to (6,4) from (5,4), with food at (6,4).\n> \n> Before move: positions include head (5,4), and tail (6,3)\n> \n> After move: head to (6,4), and since eat, tail does not move, so the positions: new head (6,4), then the old head (5,4) becomes first body, then the previous body segments except the tail is not removed, so all previous body segments are kept, and the tail (6,3) is still there as the last segment.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] with (6,3) as tail.\n> \n> Length 21.\n> \n> No issue.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> After eating (6,4), we have food at (1,2) to eat.\n> \n> But it's under body, at (1,2).\n> \n> To eat it, we need to move the snake so that (1,2) is vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> (1,2) is currently occupied by a body segment.\n> \n> In the positions above, after eating, (1,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> We need to move such that the segment at (1,2) moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, eventually the body will move, but we need to coordinate so that when (1,2) is free, head can go there.\n> \n> But head is at (6,4) after eating, which is far from (1,2).\n> \n> Also, the life_span of (1,2) is 8 at turn 72, so after turns, at turn 75, how many left?\n> \n> At turn 72: life_span 8\n> \n> After turn 72: not eaten, life_span 7 at turn 73\n> \n> After turn 73: not eaten, life_span 6 at turn 74\n> \n> After turn 74: not eaten, life_span 5 at turn 75\n> \n> After turn 75: we eat (6,4), but not (1,2), so at turn 76, life_span 4 for (1,2)\n> \n> Still time.\n> \n> Now, from after turn 75, head at (6,4), direction R (since moved right from (5,4)).\n> \n> Now, we need to navigate towards (1,2).\n> \n> But the snake is long, and grid is small.\n> \n> Possible to go left or down, etc.\n> \n> But we need to free (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is part of the body, and to free it, the snake must move in a way that the segment at (1,2) moves to another cell.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves down or something.\n> \n> But it's fixed in the chain.\n> \n> The only way to free (1,2) is for the snake to move such that the segment that was at (1,2) moves to a different cell on its turn.\n> \n> Since the body follows the head, it will move eventually.\n> \n> Specifically, when the head moves, the body shifts, so each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for (1,2) to be free, when the segment that is currently at (1,2) moves away, and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since the body moves sequentially, when the segment at (1,2) moves to the next position, (1,2) becomes free, but only if the next body segment doesn't come to it, but in snake, when the body moves, each segment takes the place of the previous one, so cells are vacated only at the tail when no growth.\n> \n> To free a body cell, we need the tail to move away from that area or something.\n> \n> But in this case, (1,2) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, freeing the tail cell.\n> \n> But for a middle cell, it doesn't get freed immediately; only when the segment moves, the cell is vacated, but since the next segment moves into it simultaneously? No.\n> \n> In terms of grid: when the snake moves, all segments shift at once: head to new, each body segment to the position of the previous segment in front.\n> \n> So for a cell occupied by a body segment, when that segment moves to a new position, the cell it left is free, unless another segment moves into it, but since each segment moves to the position of the one in front, the cell that was occupied by the last segment (tail) is freed if no growth.\n> \n> For a middle cell, when the segment moves away, the cell is free for that moment, but in practice, for the head to move there, it must be that no other segment is moving to it, which is only possible for the tail cell or if the head moves directly.\n> \n> Specifically, a cell can be freed if it was occupied by a segment that moves away, and no segment is moving to it.\n> \n> In the body, when a segment moves, it leaves its cell, and the cell behind might be taken by the next segment, but not necessarily.\n> \n> Example: suppose positions A-B-C.\n> \n> After move, if head moves to D, then B moves to A, C moves to B, so cell A is left free only if C was not moving to it, but C moves to B, so cell A is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, when the snake moves without eating, the tail cell is vacated, and all other cells are shifted; the cell that was head is now occupied by the first body segment, etc., and only the tail cell is freed.\n> \n> If the snake grows, no cell is freed.\n> \n> Therefore, for a body cell to become free, it must be that the segment occupying it is the tail, and when the tail moves, the cell is freed.\n> \n> Otherwise, for a middle segment, when it moves, it leaves its cell, but the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment in line, so it doesn't become free; only the tail cell can be freed when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,2) to be freed, it must become the tail at some point, or we need to eat food so that it doesn't move.\n> \n> But since the food is under it, we need it to move away so the cell is free for head.\n> \n> Therefore, (1,2) must be the tail at some point for it to be freed.\n> \n> Currently, (1,2) is not tail; tail is elsewhere.\n> \n> We need to maneuver the snake so that (1,2) becomes the tail.\n> \n> That means we need to straighten the snake or move in a way that the segment at (1,2) is the last one.\n> \n> But it might be difficult with the current shape.\n> \n> The snake is coiled, so it might take many moves to make (1,2) the tail.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the tail will change position over time.\n> \n> For example, as the snake moves, the tail moves along the path.\n> \n> But (1,2) is fixed; the segment that is at (1,2) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> The cell (1,2) can be freed only when the segment that occupies it moves away and no other segment moves to it, which happens when that segment is the tail and we move without eating.\n> \n> So yes, for (1,2) to be free, the segment that is currently at (1,2) must be the tail, and when we move, the tail moves away, freeing (1,2).\n> \n> Then head can move to it.\n> \n> So we need to make the segment at (1,2) the tail.\n> \n> That requires the snake to uncoil or move in a way that this segment becomes the end.\n> \n> Since the snake is a path, the tail is the end of the path.\n> \n> To make a specific segment the tail, we need to move the head such that we don't grow, so the tail advances, and eventually that segment becomes tail.\n> \n> But it might take many turns.\n> \n> For example, the distance from head to that segment.\n> \n> In the current positions, after turn 73 or something.\n> \n> Let's not get bogged down.\n> \n> Perhaps eating (1,2) is not feasible soon, or we need to prioritize survival.\n> \n> But both foods are positive, so we should eat if possible.\n> \n> First, let's complete the action sequence for the first food.\n> \n> In the sequence, at turn 75 we eat (6,4).\n> \n> Then from there, head at (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: U, D, L, but not opposite?

It's turn 73. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,5), and the body segments follow. The direction is down (D), meaning the head is moving downward. Since it's moving down, the last move was from (6,6) to (6,5), I think? Snake positions are listed from head to tail: [(6,5), (6,6), ...]. So head is at (6,5), and the segment behind it is (6,6), which means the snake was at (6,6) before moving to (6,5), so it moved down to (6,5). Direction is given as D, which matches.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food here is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and they increase length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,4), it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 73, life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 77? Let's see: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. At turn t, life span N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0, and disappears before turn t + N.\n> \n> So for (6,4), life span 5 at turn 73:\n> \n> - Turn 73: life span 5\n> \n> - Turn 74: 4\n> \n> - Turn 75: 3\n> \n> - Turn 76: 2\n> \n> - Turn 77: 1\n> \n> - After turn 77, before turn 78, it disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 77.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life span 7 at turn 73:\n> \n> - Disappears after turn 79 (since 73 + 7 - 1 = 79? Turn 73: span 7, 74:6, ..., 79:1, gone at 80. So last chance to eat is turn 79.\n> \n> Turn t + N - 1 is the last turn it can be eaten. For (6,4), N=5, t=73, last eat turn: 73 + 5 - 1 = 77.\n> \n> For (1,2), N=7, last eat turn: 73 + 7 - 1 = 79.\n> \n> For (2,5), N=10, last eat turn: 73 + 10 - 1 = 82.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,5), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> But movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move up on the next turn.\n> \n> Also, cannot move into walls or body, except the tail might move.\n> \n> Body collision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, it dies. But when moving, if the head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because the tail moves at the same time.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4) is under the tail, I think. Snake positions include (6,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is listed, and snake has a segment at (6,4), so the food is under the snake's tail.\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, and head move onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,2) is also under a body segment? Snake has (1,2) as part of the body. Positions: ... (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), ... so yes, (1,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): snake has (2,5) as a segment? Positions: (3,5), (2,5), ... yes, (2,5) is a body segment.\n> \n> So all three food items are currently under snake body segments. Specifically:\n> \n> - (6,4) under tail\n> \n> - (1,2) under a body segment\n> \n> - (2,5) under a body segment\n> \n> To eat them, we need to move the snake such that the body moves away from that cell, and then the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> But there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,4), which is the tail, if head moves to it when adjacent, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (6,5), tail at (6,4). Are they adjacent? (6,5) and (6,4) are adjacent vertically. Distance is 1, so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,4), that would be moving onto the tail cell. But since the tail is there, and if I move to it, I eat the food, but then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is now on (6,4), which was the old tail, but after growth, the new tail is... let's think.\n> \n> Normally, when snake moves to a food, it grows, so the tail stays in place.\n> \n> Current tail is at (6,4). If head moves to (6,4), which has food, it eats it, so snake grows: new head at (6,4), and tail remains at (6,4)? No, the tail doesn't move when growing.\n> \n> Sequence: when snake moves, head moves to new position. If that position has food, it eats, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the head position after eating.\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell with food:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell (with food)\n> \n> - Food is eaten, so length increases by 1\n> \n> - Therefore, the tail does not move; it stays where it is, and a new segment is added at the position where head is now.\n> \n> So, in this case, if head moves to (6,4), which is the current tail position and has food:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - Since food is eaten, tail does not move, so the segment at (6,4) remains as part of the body.\n> \n> - But head is now at (6,4), which was the previous tail, but now it's the head, and the old tail segment is still there? No, the segments shift.\n> \n> Let's clarify the positions.\n> \n> Before move: head at (6,5), body segments including tail at (6,4).\n> \n> After move down to (6,4):\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - Since (6,4) has food, it eats it, so snake grows: new head position is (6,4), and the tail does not move. So the segment that was tail at (6,4) is no longer tail; it becomes part of the body, and a new segment is added at (6,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics:\n> \n> When snake moves without eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - Tail is removed\n> \n> When snake moves to a cell with food:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell (with food)\n> \n> - Food is consumed\n> \n> - Body segments move as before, but tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the position where head was, or after the head moves.\n> \n> Typically, after moving head to food cell, the body follows, but since food is eaten, the tail doesn't contract, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Specifically, the new position of the head is the food cell, and the previous head position becomes the new neck, and so on, but tail remains.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> After move to a new cell N:\n> \n> If N has no food: new positions: N (head), P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1} (tail at P_{k-1}, Pk is vacated)\n> \n> If N has food: new positions: N (head), P0, P1, ..., Pk (tail) — so tail is still Pk, and a new segment is added, so positions become N, P0, P1, ..., Pk, with Pk still the tail.\n> \n> In the eating case, the tail does not move; it stays, and the head is at a new position.\n> \n> In this scenario, if head moves to (6,4), which is currently occupied by the tail Pk.\n> \n> After move: head is now at (6,4), and since food is eaten, the body segments: the previous head (6,5) becomes the new segment after head, and the tail (6,4) remains as is, but since head is now at (6,4), which was the tail, but in the new position, (6,4) is head, and the segment that was tail is still there?

Let's see the order.\n> \n> After move and eat:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell: (6,4)\n> \n> - Because food is eaten, the snake grows, so the tail is not removed.

Let's see: new segment 1 at old head (5,4), new seg2 at old S1 (5,5), new seg3 at old S2 (6,5), ..., new seg9 at old S8 (2,5), so (2,5) is still occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): new seg13 at old S12 (1,2), so (1,2) still occupied.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> When no food eaten, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for position (2,5), it was occupied by old segment 8.\n> \n> After move, new segment 9 is at the position where old segment 8 was, which is (2,5), so (2,5) is still occupied by new segment 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) was old segment 12, new segment 13 is at old segment 12 position, (1,2), so still occupied.\n> \n> The only cell freed is the tail cell, which was (6,2), now vacated.\n> \n> Other cells may be occupied by different segments.\n> \n> So for (2,5) and (1,2), since they are not the tail, they remain occupied after a move with no eat; the segment there moves, but another segment takes its place if the snake is dense, but in this case, since it's the same position, the cell remains occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell with a body segment, after a move with no eat, that cell will be occupied by a different segment, but the cell is still occupied unless it was the tail position.\n> \n> For example, cell (2,5): before move, occupied by segment 8.\n> \n> After move, segment 8 has moved to the position of segment 7, which was (3,5), so new position at (3,5).\n> \n> Then the cell (2,5) is now occupied by the segment that moves to it, which is new segment 9, which is at position of old segment 8, (2,5).\n> \n> So (2,5) is still occupied, just by a different segment.\n> \n> Similarly, only the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, for a food under the body, to free it, the snake must move so that no segment is on that cell, which requires that the segment on it moves and no other segment moves to it, which happens when that part of the body moves away, or when it becomes the tail and moves.\n> \n> In particular, for (1,2) and (2,5), since they are not the tail, it may take several moves to free them.\n> \n> For example, to free (2,5), the segment on it must move, and since the snake is moving, it will eventually be freed when the body passes, but it might take time.\n> \n> With the current position, the tail is at (6,2), so to free (2,5), it will take many moves as the snake moves.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,2).\n> \n> But with life span, (1,2) has life 5, so it might disappear before I can eat it if I don't act soon.\n> \n> (2,5) life 8, more time.\n> \n> Perhaps I should not eat (6,4) and instead move towards the left to free up the foods.\n> \n> But let's go back to the immediate choice.\n> \n> If I move to (6,4)

Head direction is down (D), which means it's moving downward, so from (5,3) to (5,4) would be down? Let's see the positions: head is at (5,3), next is (5,4). Since y increases downward? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom, so moving down increases y. Head at (5,3), direction D, so it came from above, I assume. Positions: [(5,3), (5,4), ...], so from (5,3) to (5,4) is moving down to (5,4), so direction D means it moved down to current head position.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning the direction it's facing or the last move? It says \"Snake Head Direction: D\", and in the context, it's probably the direction it moved to get to the current head position.

Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? Example: if at turn t, life span is N, then after this turn, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears after that turn. So for (6,4), life span 2 at turn 76: after turn 76, it will have life span 1, then after turn 77, life span 0, and it disappears before turn 78 or something. But for eating, we care about when it's present.\n> \n> Typically, food is present as long as life span > 0. So at turn t, with life span L, it is present for turns t to t+L-1 inclusive?

It's turn 77, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (5,2). The snake is 20 segments long, starting from the head at (6,3) and going through various positions to the tail at (5,1). The head is moving right, so from (6,3), moving right would go to (7,3), but x=7 is a wall, so moving right is impossible. That's a problem.\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning right, from (6,3). But x=7 is a wall, so if I try to move right, it would be a wall collision. Therefore, I can't move right. I need to choose a different direction.\n> \n> Available moves: Since head is at (6,3) and direction is R, but I can't go right because of wall. Possible moves are U (up, to (6,4)), D (down, to (6,2)), L (left, to (5,3)). But I have to consider no instant reverse; current direction is R, so I can't go left (L) immediately because that would be opposite. No instant reverse means I cannot move in the opposite direction on the next turn. So from R, opposite is L, so I cannot move left to (5,3).\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed. So I cannot choose L. Moving right to (7,3) is wall, so invalid. So only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> U: up to (6,4)\n> \n> D: down to (6,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> (6,4): is this a wall? Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,4) is within bounds, not a wall. Also, internal obstacles: only (5,2), so (6,4) should be free?

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 77, if not eaten, it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,4) with life span 1, on turn 77, it is present, but after turn 77, it will be gone. So if I move to (6,4) on turn 77, I can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (1,2,3,1) life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning on turn 80 it will be gone if not eaten before.\n> \n> Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So when food is spawned, it has life_span N, meaning it will be present for N turns, including the turn it appears.

After I move to (6,4), the positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), ... so (6,5) is occupied by the body segment that was index 4, now index 5 in new list?

It's turn 78, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (6,2), and it's moving down (direction D). The full snake body is: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)].

Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including the current one. So for (1,2), it has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 78 + 3 - 1? Let's clarify the countdown.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, a food with life span N will disappear after N turns, meaning it's present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> For food at turn 78:\n> - (1,2): life span 3, so available on turns 78, 79, 80.

Disappears after turn 82.\n> - (1,4): life span 8, available on turns 78 to 85.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,2), direction down.

Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Current head position: (6,2)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> - Down (D): to (6,1). y=1, which is within 0 to 7, so not a wall. But check if (6,1) is occupied by body or obstacle.\n> \n> Body positions: look at snake list: (6,2) is head, (6,3), (5,3), etc. (6,1) is not in the body list, and not (5,2) which is obstacle? (5,2) is obstacle, but (6,1) is different.\n> \n> (6,1): x=6, y=1. Walls: borders are fine, internal obstacle (5,2) is at x=5,y=2, so not (6,1). Body positions: snake has (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So (6,1) is not in this list, so it should be empty? But (6,1) might be a valid cell.\n> \n> Similarly, left (L): to (5,2). But (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so that's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Right (R): to (7,2). x=7, but border walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=7 is a wall cell. Therefore, moving right to (7,2) would hit the wall.\n> \n> Up (U): but current direction is down, so moving up is reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up), so cannot move up.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves are only down (D) to (6,1), since left to (5,2) is obstacle, right to (7,2) is wall, and up not allowed.\n> \n> Is (6,1) safe? It should be, as per above. But let me confirm the body: snake body has segments at various positions, but (6,1) not listed. Also, since the tail is at (4,1), which is different.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so collision is only with body segments except the tail, because when head moves to a cell, if it's the tail, the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (6,1): is it occupied by any body segment?

Let's index.\n> \n> After turn 78 move: positions: 0:(6,1), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,3), 3:(5,3), 4:(5,4), 5:(5,5), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,6), 8:(5,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(3,5), 12:(2,5), 13:(2,4), 14:(1,4), 15:(1,3), 16:(1,2), 17:(2,2), 18:(3,2), 19:(3,1) but (3,1) was removed? No: after move to (6,1), positions are [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ] and since no food, tail (3,1) is removed, so the new body is from index 0 to 18, with index 18 being the new tail. Index 0: head (6,1), index 1: (6,2), index 2: (6,3), ..., index 18: (3,2), and index 19: (3,1) gone. So tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Then after turn 79 move L to (5,1): new head at (5,1), then previous head (6,1) becomes first body, then (6,2), (6,3), ..., (3,2), and tail (3,2) is removed? Positions: new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). Then since no food, tail (3,2) is removed, so new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] and (3,2) gone. Tail is now (2,2).\n> \n> Direction: moved left, so new direction L.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> But I need to think about food and longer term.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their positions:\n> \n> - Food at (1,2): value 1, life span 3, so available turns 78,79,80. Disappears after turn 80.\n> \n> - Food at (2,5): value 1, life span 5, available turns 78 to 82.\n> \n> - Food at (1,4): value 1, life span 8, available turns 78 to 85.\n> \n> Also, note that some food might be under the snake body. Let's see.\n> \n> Food at (1,2): is it under the snake? Snake positions include (1,2) at index 15 or something. In initial state, (1,2) is part of the snake body, specifically, it's a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is also a body segment.\n> \n> (2,5) is a body segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,2) food, it's currently under the snake body at position (1,2). To eat it, the snake must move away from that cell so it's free, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to current position after turns.\n> \n> At turn 78, only move is D to (6,1).\n> \n> Then turn 79, from (6,1), only move L to (5,1).\n> \n> Now turn 80: head at (5,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, can go L, U, D, but not R (reverse).\n> \n> Left (L): to (4,1). (4,1): is it safe? Walls: not border or obstacle. Body positions: after move to (5,1), positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] tail at (2,2).\n> \n> (4,1) not in list, so empty, safe.\n> \n> Up (U): to (5,2). But (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Down (D): to (5,0), y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Right (R): to (6,1), but that's the current first body segment, and direction is L, so R is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is left to (4,1). Action L.\n> \n> Then move to (4,1).\n> \n> After move: new head at (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), etc., tail (2,2) removed. New positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] but no food, so tail removed, new tail is (2,2)? Positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and (2,2) is tail, removed. So new body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] tail at (1,2).\n> \n> Direction: moved left, so still L? Or new direction.\n> \n> Head moved from (5,1) to (4,1), so direction left, so L.\n> \n> Now turn 81: head at (4,1), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: L, U, D.\n> \n> Left (L): to (3,1). (3,1): not wall. Body positions: (4,1) head, (5,1), (6,1), etc., to (1,2). (3,1) not in list? List has (3,5), (3,6), etc., but (3,1) not in current positions. Positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So (3,1) not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> Up (U): to (4,2). (4,2): not wall, not obstacle, not in body? Body has (4,1), (5,1), etc., (4,2) not listed, so empty.\n> \n> Down (D): to (4,0), y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Right (R): to (5,1), but that's the first body segment, and since we moved left, right is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,1) or U to (4,2).\n> \n> Now I have a choice.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,2) disappears after turn 80, so at turn 81, it's gone. Turn 80 was the last turn it was available? Life span 3 at turn 78, so turns 78,79,80 available. Turn 81 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) available until turn 82, (1,4) until turn 85.\n> \n> (1,2) food is at (1,2), which is currently the tail position in the snake.\n> \n> In the current state after turn 80 move, head at (4,1), tail at (1,2).\n> \n> To eat (1,2) food, but it's under the tail now? The food is at (1,2), which is occupied by the snake body, specifically the tail.\n> \n> But to eat it, the body must move away first. Since it's the tail, when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so the cell becomes free if no food, but since there is food, the food is still there when the tail moves away? Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\", so it exists, but can only be eaten when head moves onto it after the body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 80, (1,2) has food and is tail position.\n> \n> After we move to (4,1) at turn 80, the tail was at (1,2), and since no food eaten, tail moves away, so (1,2) is now free, and food is still there until turn 80? But turn 80 is the current turn for the move.\n> \n> Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> At the start of turn 78, food is present with life span.\n> \n> After each move, the turn increments, and life span decreases.\n> \n> At turn 78, we move, then turn 79, life span decreases by 1 for all food.\n> \n> Similarly.\n> \n> For (1,2) food: at turn 78, life span 3, so available.\n> \n> After turn 78 move to (6,1), turn becomes 79, life span of (1,2) decreases to 2, so available turns 79 and 80.\n> \n> After turn 79 move to (5,1), turn 80, life span of (1,2) decreases to 1, available this turn.\n> \n> After turn 80 move, if we move to (4,1), turn becomes 81, life span 0, so it disappears, not available.\n> \n> But during turn 80, before move, food (1,2) is available.\n> \n> At the start of turn 80, head is at (5,1), direction L, and we moved to (4,1).\n> \n> Before the move, at turn 80, the cell (1,2) has food and is occupied by the snake body? In the positions before turn 80 move.\n> \n> At turn 80 start, positions: head at (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), ..., (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) tail? From earlier: after turn 79, positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] so (1,2) is a body segment, not tail; tail is (2,2).\n> \n> And food at (1,2) is present.\n> \n> When we move at turn 80 to (4,1), the tail (2,2) moves away, so cell (2,2) becomes free, but (1,2) is still occupied by the segment that was before tail? After move, the segment at (1,2) moves to the next position, but since we moved head to (4,1), the body shifts: the segment that was at (1,2) might move to (2,2) or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> Before turn 80 move: positions index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (6,1), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,6), 9: (5,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (3,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (2,4), 15: (1,4), 16: (1,3), 17: (1,2), 18: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (4,1): new position 0: (4,1), then 1: (5,1) previous head, 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,5), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (4,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (3,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (2,4), 16: (1,4), 17: (1,3), 18: (1,2), and tail (2,2) is removed. So new tail is (1,2).\n> \n> Now, cell (1,2) has food, and it's now the tail position.\n> \n> After move, turn becomes 81, and life span of (1,2) food was 1 at turn 80, after move to turn 81, life span 0, so it disappears.\n> \n> But during turn 80, when we moved, did we eat any food? We moved to (4,1), no food there, so no.\n> \n> The food at (1,2) was not eaten because head didn't move to it; it's still under the body.\n> \n> At turn 81, it's gone.\n> \n> So we missed eating (1,2) food because we couldn't reach it in time.\n> \n> Now back to turn 81: head at (4,1), direction L, after moving from (5,1) to (4,1).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,1), U to (4,2), or D to (4,0) invalid, R to (5,1) reverse not allowed.\n> \n> (3,1) and (4,2) are both possible.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the other food.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): available until turn 82, so turns 81 and 82 left? At turn 81, life span: since initial life span 5 at turn 78, after turn 78 move to 79, span 4; turn 79 to 80, span 3; turn 80 to 81, span 2; so at turn 81, span 2, available turns 81 and 82.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) at turn 81, span: initial 8 at 78, to 79:7, 80:6, 81:5, available turns 81 to 85.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,1), we need to go towards the food.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 20 segments, but after three moves without eating, it's shorter? Initially 20 segments, after three moves no food, so now 17 segments? Let's see.\n> \n> Initial at turn 78: 20 segments.\n> \n> After turn 78 move D to (6,1), no food, so new length 20 (since no growth, but tail removed, so length decreases by one? Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, else unchanged. \"Length of snake unchanged\" for negative food, but for no food, also unchanged? No.\n> \n> Rule for positive food: \"Length of snake +1\", for negative food: \"Length of snake unchanged\", but when no food eaten, the snake moves, tail is removed, so length decreases by one.\n> \n> I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Let's check the rules.\n> \n> \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n> \n> \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\"\n> \n> But when moving without eating food, what happens to length?\n> \n> In snake game, typically, when no food eaten, the snake moves forward, so the tail end is cut off, length decreases by one? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves from current tail position, so the snake length remains the same, but it shifts.\n> \n> Length only increases when food is eaten.\n> \n> In the rules here, for positive food, length +1, for negative food, length unchanged, which implies that when no food, length should decrease or unchanged?\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> The rule doesn't explicitly say what happens when no food is eaten.\n> \n> But from the context, when moving, if no food eaten, the tail is removed, so length decreases by one.\n> \n> For example, in the state, snake positions list the segments, and when moving without eating, the tail is removed.\n> \n> In the initial move I described, after moving without eating, the tail was removed, so length decreased.\n> \n> At turn 78, 20 segments.\n> \n> After move to (6,1), 19 segments? In my earlier, after turn 78 move, positions had 19 segments: from (6,1) to (3,1) but (3,1) was tail and removed, so 19 segments.\n> \n> Similarly after turn 79, 18 segments, and so on.\n> \n> In the food rules, only when eating, length changes.\n> \n> So for no food, length decreases by one each move? That seems odd, but from the position list, it does.\n> \n> Let's confirm with the rule.\n> \n> The rule says: for positive food, length +1, for negative, unchanged.\n> \n> It doesn't say for no food.\n> \n> But in the movement, when you move to a cell with no food, you don't grow, so the tail is removed, so length decreases.\n> \n> Similarly, if you eat food, you grow, so tail not removed.\n> \n> Yes, that's standard.\n> \n> So in this case, after three moves without eating, length is now 17 at turn 81 start?

It's turn 79. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (6,1), and the body segments follow: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Then: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)\n> \n> The snake has 20 segments. Head direction is Down, which is D. Since it's moving down, and head is at (6,1), moving down would decrease y, but in grid terms, y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in such games, y increases upwards, but let's confirm from the positions.\n> \n> Head is at (6,1), and moving down to (6,2)? That doesn't make sense. Head direction is D, down, which should decrease y if y=0 is bottom. But in the positions, from head (6,1) to (6,2), which is increasing y, so that would be up if y=0 is bottom. I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases as we go up, decreases as we go down. So (x,y) with y=0 at bottom, y=7 at top? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,1), which is x=6, y=1. Moving down (D) would be to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so it can't move down now? But the direction is given as D, meaning it was moving down to get to (6,1)? Let's see the positions: head is (6,1), next is (6,2). (6,2) has higher y, so that would be up from (6,1). I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), ...] so the head is at (6,1), and the body behind it is at (6,2). Since the snake moves, when it moves, the head goes to a new position, and tail follows. But here positions are listed head first, so from head to tail.\n> \n> At current turn, head is at (6,1), and it was moving down to get there? But from where? Previous position would be, say before moving to (6,1), it was at some position moving down to (6,1).\n> \n> Head direction is D, down. So it is facing down, meaning it can move down, left, or right, but not up instantly, since no instant reverse.\n> \n> From (6,1), moving down would be to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so it cannot move down. Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (6,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, moving up would be to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the body? Let's see the positions: (6,2) is the second segment, so it's part of the body, but when the snake moves, the body segments move, so if head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away, so it might be possible to move to (6,2) if that cell is freed when tail moves, but no.\n> \n> The rule: you can move into the cell that will be vacated by the tail, but only if it's the tail. In this case, the tail is at (3,1), so (6,2) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by the body after move, it collides.\n> \n> Standard snake: after move, if head is in same cell as any body segment, death. But the tail moves, so if head moves to where tail was, it's ok, because tail leaves.\n> \n> In this case, positions: head at (6,1), body at (6,2), (6,3), etc. If head moves up to (6,2), but (6,2) is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the head would be at (6,2), and the body segments shift: the old head becomes part of body, so (6,1) becomes body, (6,2) becomes the new position for what was second segment? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front. So the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away from its cell, so head can move to that cell if it's adjacent, but only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically, head can move to the current tail position only if it's adjacent, and after move, since tail moves, no collision.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a non-tail body segment, after move, that cell still has a body segment because the segments shift, so head would be colliding with that body segment.\n> \n> For example: positions: A (head), B, C, D (tail).\n> \n> If head moves to where B is, then after move: head at B's position, A moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Sequence: before move: cells: head at P0, segment at P1, P2, ..., Pn tail.\n> \n> After move in direction Dir: new head at P0 + Dir, then each segment moves to previous position: so new positions: head at P0 + Dir, then segment1 at P0, segment2 at P1, ..., segment n at P_{n-1}, and tail was at Pn, which is vacated.\n> \n> So the cell that was Pn is now empty.\n> \n> If head moves to P1, which is the position of segment1, after move: head at P1, segment1 moves to P0 (which was head), segment2 moves to P1 (but P1 is now head, so collision), segment2 is moving to P1, but head is at P1, so yes, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, head can only move to a cell that is not occupied by any body segment except the tail, and even for tail, it's ok only if head moves to tail position and tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, for (6,2), it's not the tail; tail is at (3,1). So moving to (6,2) would cause collision because after move, the segment that was at (6,2) moves to (6,1), and head is at (6,2), but the segment moving to (6,1) is not colliding with head at (6,2), but the cell (6,2) has head, and no other segment should be there except during movement, but in terms of position after move, head is at new position, and body segments are at their new positions.\n> \n> After move, all positions are updated simultaneously. So if head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment, after move, that cell has the head, and the body segment that was there has moved to the previous head position or something.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (6,2): new head at (6,2), then segment that was at (6,2) moves to where head was, (6,1), segment that was at (6,3) moves to (6,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions before move: head: (6,1), seg1: (6,2), seg2: (6,3), etc.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2): new head at (6,2). Then the first body segment (which was seg1 at (6,2)) needs to move to the previous head position, which is (6,1). But (6,1) is now the position for seg1. Then seg2 at (6,3) moves to where seg1 was, (6,2), but (6,2) is now the head, so when seg2 moves to (6,2), it collides with head at (6,2).\n> \n> Therefore, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment (except the tail) will cause collision because after the move, that cell will be occupied by both head and the body segment that moves there if it's not the tail.\n> \n> For the tail: if head moves to tail position, say tail at T, head moves to T. New head at T. Then the body segment before tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail moves to where the second last was, so T is vacated and new tail is elsewhere, so no collision.\n> \n> But only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> In this state, (6,2) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> So for current position, head at (6,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by body segment, and it's not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,1)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so invalid? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so (7,1) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (5,1)? But let's check if (5,1) is free.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) tail.\n> \n> So (5,1) is not in the list, so it should be free, but is there wall or obstacle?\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,1) is not mentioned, so should be free.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal (5,2).\n> \n> (5,1) is x=5,y=1, not border, not (5,2), so free.\n> \n> Also, no food there, I think.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,2,2,1) meaning (x,y) = (1,2), value=2, life_span=1?

In the core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", but in the state, it says \" (1, 2, 2, 1) \" etc. Perhaps the \"2,1\" is life_span and value or something.\n> \n> Let's read the state carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 2, 2, 1) - (2, 5, 4, 1) - (1, 4, 7, 1) - (4, 3, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> And in the core rules, it's \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so for each, it's a tuple of (position, value, life_span).\n> \n> But here it's written as (x,y, value, life_span) I think, so for first one: (1,2) with value 2? But value should be +1 or -1, but 2 is not +1 or -1. Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) because life_span is mentioned first in the text.\n> \n> The text says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" so it might be listed as (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> For (1,2,2,1): x=1,y=2, life_span=2, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5,4,1): x=2,y=5, life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> (1,4,7,1): x=1,y=4, life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (4,3,10,1): x=4,y=3, life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All have value=1, so all positive food? Value=1, which is +1, so all are positive food with reward +1, and length increases by 1 when eaten.\n> \n> Life_span: for (1,2) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so at turn 79, life_span=2, so it will disappear after turn 80? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, food with life_span N will disappear after N turns, so at turn t+N it is gone. Countdown from N to 1, at turn t it has N, at t+1 it has N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1 it has 1, and after that turn, it's gone.\n> \n> So for food at (1,2) with life_span=2 at turn 79, it will be there at turn 80 (life_span=1), and gone after turn 80, so not available at turn 81.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) life_span=4 at turn 79, so available until turn 82 (since at turn 82, life_span=1, gone after).\n> \n> Turn 79: life_span L, available for L more turns, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1. At turn t+L, it is removed before the turn.\n> \n> Back to possible moves for head at (6,1), direction D.\n> \n> Can move: D to (6,0) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,2) - but (6,2) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision. Invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,1) - let's check if free. Not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (5,2)), so (5,1) is free.\n> \n> R to (7,1) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> But is that correct? Head direction is D, so after moving L, the new direction is L, so for next turn, cannot move R (opposite of L), but can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> But for now, only one choice: move Left to (5,1).\n> \n> Then the snake will move to (5,1), and the tail will move from (3,1) to the previous segment position, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves to (3,2)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,1), then the body: the segment that was at head (6,1) becomes new segment1 at (6,1), segment that was at (6,2) moves to (6,1)? Positions:\n> \n> Before: positions list: index 0: head (6,1), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,4), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,3), 16: (1,2), 17: (2,2), 18: (3,2), 19: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (5,1): new head at (5,1). Then new position for segment that was index 0: it becomes body at (6,1). Segment that was index 1: moves to where index 0 was, (6,1). But (6,1) is now occupied by the new body from index 0, so segment index 1 moves to (6,1), but it's the same cell? No, in terms of assignment: the new position for each segment.\n> \n> New head: (5,1)\n> \n> Then the first body segment (which was the old head) at (6,1)\n> \n> Then the second body segment (was index 1) moves to the position of old index 0, which is (6,1), so it is at (6,1)\n> \n> But (6,1) is already occupied by the first body segment? Conflict.\n> \n> I think I have the indexing wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: after move, the new head is at new position. Then each subsequent segment takes the position of the previous segment in the old list.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new_pos = (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 1 (was old head) at old_head_pos = (6,1)\n> \n> Segment 2 (was old seg1) at old_seg1_pos = (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 3 (was old seg2) at old_seg2_pos = (6,3)\n> \n> And so on, up to segment 19 (tail) at old_seg18_pos = (3,2)? Old positions: seg18 is (3,2), seg19 (tail) at (3,1)\n> \n> After move, the new tail is at old position of seg18, which is (3,2)\n> \n> And the cell (3,1) is vacated.\n> \n> But for segment 1 and segment 2 both assigned to (6,1)? No:\n> \n> New head: (5,1)\n> \n> New segment 1: position of old head, (6,1)\n> \n> New segment 2: position of old segment 1, which is (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 3: position of old segment 2, (6,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 19: position of old segment 18, which is (3,2)\n> \n> Old segment 18 is at (3,2), old segment 19 at (3,1), so new segment 19 at (3,2), and (3,1) is free.\n> \n> But new segment 1 at (6,1), new segment 2 at (6,2), so no conflict.\n> \n> In this case, (6,1) has one segment, (6,2) has another, etc.\n> \n> Back to the move: moving to (5,1) is valid, since it's free.\n> \n> Now, is there food at (5,1)? Food positions: (1,2), (2,5), (1,4), (4,3), so no, (5,1) no food.\n> \n> So after move, no food eaten, snake length same, tail moves to (3,2), so the segment at (3,1) is vacated.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> The instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, look at food positions.\n> \n> Food at (1,2): which is currently occupied by a body segment? Snake positions include (1,2), which is index 16: (1,2) is part of body.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is also in positions, index 14: (1,4)\n> \n> (2,5) is index 12: (2,5)\n> \n> (4,3) is not in positions, so free.\n> \n> But food at (1,2), (1,4), (2,5) are under body segments, so to eat them, the snake must move so that the body moves away from that cell, and then head moves onto it when it's free.\n> \n> For example, food at (1,2) is under body at index 16. To eat it, the snake needs to move such that this segment moves away, and later head comes to (1,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail is at (3,1), food is at (1,2), (2,5), etc, not at tail, so not immediate issue.\n> \n> Now, current turn t=79, only possible move is L to (5,1).\n> \n> Then on turn 80, head at (5,1), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From (5,1), possible moves:\n> \n> U: to (5,2) - but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D: to (5,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> L: to (4,1)\n> \n> R: to (6,1) - but (6,1) is now occupied by the body? After move to (5,1), the position (6,1) has a body segment (new segment 1).\n> \n> But when moving from (5,1), if move R to (6,1), that cell is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (4,1) might be free.\n> \n> Let's find free cells around (5,1).\n> \n> After move to (5,1), new positions: head at (5,1), seg1 at (6,1), seg2 at (6,2), seg3 at (6,3), seg4 at (5,3), seg5 at (5,4), seg6 at (5,5), seg7 at (6,5), seg8 at (6,6), seg9 at (5,6), seg10 at (4,6), seg11 at (3,6), seg12 at (3,5), seg13 at (2,5), seg14 at (1,4), seg15 at (1,3), seg16 at (1,2), seg17 at (2,2), seg18 at (3,2), seg19 at (3,1)?

Confusion.\n> \n> Better: after move and eat, the new snake has head at Q, then the first body segment at the old head position P, then the second at old B1, and so on, up to the old tail position Bk, and since length increases, there is a new segment added at the position where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's at Bk, so the segments are: Q, P, B1, B2, ..., Bk, and Bk is now the second last, and a new segment at Bk? No.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments remain, but an additional segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So positions become: [Q, P, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}, Bk] with Bk being the new tail?

I think I'm messing up.\n> \n> Easier: after eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move from its position; instead, it stays, and the head moves to new cell, so the new snake has one more segment.\n> \n> So the new positions are: new head at Q, then the old head P, then old B1, old B2, ..., old Bk, and the old tail position Bk now has a segment, but it's not tail anymore; the new tail is at Bk, but since it didn't move, it's the same position, but now it's part of body, and the segment before it is new.\n> \n> For example, before: positions: H, B1, B2, T\n> \n> After move to Q and eat: new positions: Q (head), H (body1), B1 (body2), B2 (body3), T (body4 and new tail? No.\n> \n> T was tail, now after growth, T is still there, but it's now the fourth segment, and since tail didn't move, a new segment is added at T, so T is now body3 or something.\n> \n> Let's index: old: 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, 3:T\n> \n> After move to Q and eat: new head at Q, then segment 1 at old H, segment 2 at old B1, segment 3 at old B2, segment 4 at old T, and since growth, segment 4 is added at old T position, so positions: 0:Q, 1:old H, 2:old B1, 3:old B2, 4:old T\n> \n> Old T is now segment 4, which is the new tail.\n> \n> So the cell old T is still occupied, but by the new tail.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell that was tail is now the new tail position, occupied.\n> \n> Back to our case.\n> \n> At turn 82, from (4,2), move U to (4,3) to eat food.\n> \n> Before move: head at (4,2), positions as above for turn 81 after move to (4,2)?

However, none of the food is reachable in this turn because:\n   - The head cannot reach any food cell in one move from (5, 1).\n   - Food under the body (e.g., (1, 2)) cannot be eaten because the head cannot reach it in one move.\n\n### Decision for Turn 80:\n- The only valid move is **left (L)** to (4, 1).

It's turn 80, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since x and y go from 0 to 7). There are walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list starting from the head: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]. The head is at (5,1) and the direction is L, which means it was moving left last turn. Since the direction is given as \"L\", and it's the head direction, I think it means the snake is facing left.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life_span 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 3 and life_span 1? Wait, the format says (x,y, value, life_span), but in the input it's written as (1,2,1,1) which might be (x,y, value, life_span), so for (1,2): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5,3,1) value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> (1,4,6,1) value=6, life_span=1?

That means they will disappear after this turn, since life_span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 80, life_span=1 means it disappears at the end of turn 80 or before turn 81? Let's clarify the life_span rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Countdown decreases every turn, including the turn it appears.\n> \n> In this case, all food has life_span 1, and current turn is 80, so after turn 80, they will disappear. That means if I don't eat them this turn (turn 80), they will be gone forever.\n> \n> Is that right? Let me think.\n> \n> If life_span is N, and it decreases every turn including current, then on the turn it spawns, life_span=N, after that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, and then it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for a food that spawns at turn t with life_span N, at turn t, life_span=N. After turn t, life_span becomes N-1. At turn t + N - 1, life_span=1. After turn t + N - 1, life_span=0, and it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean it is present for N turns, from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> But the countdown: at turn when it spawns, life_span=N, after one turn, N-1, ..., at turn t + k, life_span=N-k.\n> \n> When life_span=0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> In the input, for all food, life_span=1, and current turn=80.\n> \n> So at turn 80, life_span=1 for all food. After turn 80, life_span becomes 0, and they disappear. So if I don't eat them on turn 80, I lose the chance.\n> \n> But turn 80 is the current turn, and I need to choose an action for turn 80.\n> \n> The action sequence should start from turn t1=80.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,1), direction L, so last move was left.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but cannot do instant reverse.

Looking at snake positions, (4,1) is not in the list. Closest are (5,1) head, (6,1) is body, but (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free, but let's confirm the list: positions from index 0 to 19, (5,1) is head, then (6,1), (6,2), etc. No (4,1), so (4,1) should be empty.\n> \n> But is it a wall? Walls are only borders and (5,2), so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Right: to (6,1) — but (6,1) is the first body segment. If I move right to (6,1), the head would be moving to a cell occupied by the body, which is a collision, deadly. Also, since direction is L, moving right is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So only possible move is left to (4,1).\n> \n> Is that right?

The rules don't say anything about food respawning. In the core rules, it only describes the existing food, but doesn't mention if new food appears. I think for this game, food is given, and when eaten or expired, it's gone, and no new food mentioned. But to maximize score, I need to eat positive food.\n> \n> In this state, all existing food will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> And since I can't eat any this turn, I lose them all.\n> \n> Then the snake will be on the grid with no food, but I need to survive to find future food, but if no food respawns, then I can only move around until I die or something.\n> \n> The problem doesn't specify if new food appears. I think for this scenario, we have to work with the given food, and after they are gone, no more, so the game might end or I need to survive with no food.\n> \n> But the goal is to maximize score, so eating food is key.\n> \n> Perhaps new food spawns, but it's not mentioned. In the state input, only current food is given, so I think for planning, I have to assume only these food items exist.\n> \n> After this turn, all food disappears, so no food left.\n> \n> Then for the snake, I can move around without eating, but since no food, length doesn't change, and I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> But the game might continue indefinitely, or until collision, but with no food, score doesn't increase.\n> \n> The core rules don't specify win/lose conditions, but typically in Snake, you die on collision, and score is based on food eaten.\n> \n> So with no food, score remains constant, and I should survive as long as possible, but since no score increase, it doesn't matter, but I might die eventually if trapped.\n> \n> But in this case, after moving to (4,1), I have no food to eat.\n> \n> But let's confirm the life_span.\n> \n> Current turn t1=80, food has life_span=1.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 80, life_span=1, after I take action, if I move to a food cell, I eat it, else at the end of turn, life_span decreases to 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> Since I move to (4,1), not a food cell, all food disappear.\n> \n> Then for turn 81, I need to move from (4,1), with head direction based on my move.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,1) from (5,1), that's moving left, so new head direction is L.\n> \n> Then from (4,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot reverse, so since I moved left to here, I cannot move right (back to (5,1)).\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, and (5,2) obstacle.\n> \n> So from (4,1):\n> \n> - Up to (4,2): is it free?

So on every move without eating, the cell that was occupied by the segment that is not the tail will be vacated only if that segment moves, but since all segments move except the head is replaced, actually, the cells that were occupied by segments 1 to 19 are all vacated in the sense that the segments move to new positions, but the new positions might overlap, but in terms of the grid, when a segment moves from a cell, that cell is empty unless another segment moves in, but since they move to different cells, the old positions are vacated.\n> \n> In snake movement, since each segment moves to a different cell (the previous segment's position), all old positions except the head's new position are vacated, and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: before move, all cells occupied.\n> \n> After move: head to new cell, each body segment to the previous segment's old position.\n> \n> So the cells that were occupied but not moved to are vacated.\n> \n> For example, the old head position is now occupied by seg1, so not vacated; the old seg1 position is now occupied by seg2, and so on, up to old seg18 position occupied by seg19, and old seg19 position (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So only the old tail position is vacated; other cells are still occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For a cell like (2,5), which is old seg14 position, after move, it is occupied by seg15, because seg15 moves to old seg14 position.\n> \n> Let's see: before move, seg14 at (2,5)\n> \n> After move, seg15 moves to where seg14 was, so (2,5) is now occupied by seg15.\n> \n> Similarly, seg14 moves to where seg13 was.\n> \n> So the cell (2,5) is still occupied after the move, by a different segment.\n> \n> To vacate (2,5), I need the segment that is there to move away, and no other segment to move in, but since the segments shift, the only cell that gets vacated is the old tail position.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten when that specific cell is vacated, which happens when the segment that is on it moves off and it is not occupied by another segment immediately, but in snake, when the segment moves off, another segment moves in, so the cell is never empty unless it is the tail position.\n> \n> But the food is under a body segment, not necessarily the tail.\n> \n> According to the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

No.\n> \n> Standard: after growth, the tail does not move, so positions: the head is at the new cell, the first body segment is at the old head position, second at old first body, and so on, up to the old tail position, which is now the second last, and the new tail is at the old tail position, so it's the same cell for the last two segments? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Upon second thought, in snake games, when you eat, the snake grows by not removing the tail during that move.

The grid has walls and obstacles. From the state, the border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,2), and the body segments follow: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the snake is 20 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, which is U, meaning moving in the positive y-direction. So from (4,2), moving Up would go to (4,3).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 2. It will disappear after 2 turns, including this one, so after turn 83 or 84? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 82, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left: it will disappear after turn 83 if not eaten? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: Disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (2,5) with life span 2 at turn 82:\n> \n> - Turn 82: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 83: life span 1 (if not eaten)\n> \n> - Turn 84: gone? After N turns from spawn, but here it's given at turn 82 with life span 2, meaning it has 2 turns left including turn 82. So it can be eaten on turn 82 or 83, and disappears after turn 83.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (1,4) value 1, life span 4: can be eaten on turns 82,83,84,85; disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> - (4,3) value 1, life span 7: turns 82 to 88\n> \n> - (4,2) value 1, life span 10: turns 82 to 91\n> \n> But (4,2) is where the snake head is currently! The head is at (4,2), and there's food at (4,2) with life span 10.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Here, the food is under the head right now. Since the head is on it, but for it to be eaten, the body must move away first? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\" But if the head is already on it, moving onto it might not be possible since it's already there. I think in this case, since the head is on the food, and the body is still there, it hasn't been eaten yet because the body needs to move away.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So, if food is under a body segment, when that segment moves away, and then later the head moves to that cell, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But here, the food is under the head. Head is at (4,2), food at (4,2). Since the head is on it, but for eating, I think it requires that the cell is free when the head moves to it, but since the snake is occupying it, it might not be considered eaten until the snake moves off and back on or something. This is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps the food is on the cell, and when the head moves to that cell and it's not occupied by the body at that time, it gets eaten. But currently, the head is on it, so if the snake moves, the head leaves, and the food is still there, but since the body was there, it might not be eatable immediately.\n> \n> I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> At turn 82, snake head is at (4,2) with direction U. The food at (4,2) is under the head.\n> \n> When the snake moves, in the next turn, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell (4,2) might be vacated or not, depending on the movement.\n> \n> Let's list all positions: Snake segments: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,5), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,6), 11: (5,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (3,6), 14: (3,5), 15: (2,5), 16: (2,4), 17: (1,4), 18: (1,3), 19: tail (1,2)\n> \n> Food at (2,5) - which is position 15 in the snake, but segment 15 is (2,5), and food is at (2,5), so food under body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) food under segment 17 (1,4)\n> \n> (4,3) food at (4,3), which is not occupied? Let's see snake positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), etc. (5,3) is segment 6, so (4,3) is not in the list? Positions: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (4,3) is not listed. Snake has (4,2), (4,1), (4,6), (3,6), etc. no (4,3) or (4,4), so (4,3) is free? But food is at (4,3), so it should be eatable if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) food under head.\n> \n> (2,5) under segment 15.\n> \n> (1,4) under segment 17.\n> \n> Now, for food under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> For food under head, it might be a special case. The rule doesn't explicitly say, but from the description, since head is on it, and if the snake doesn't move, it might not be eaten, or perhaps it is eaten when the head is on it and the cell is not occupied by body, but at the start, the head is on it, so it could be eaten immediately? But the rule says \"the head moves onto the food cell\" implying a movement to it.\n> \n> I think for the current state, at turn 82, the food at (4,2) is under the head, so it has not been eaten yet because the body is still there (the head is part of the body for occupation, but for eating, it might be different).\n> \n> Perhaps the eating happens after movement. Let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it and grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But here, with food under body, it's special.\n> \n> I should look for the core rules.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For food under the head, when the head moves away, the cell is vacated, and if the head moves back later, it can be eaten, but not while it's occupied.\n> \n> Similarly for other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 82, food at (4,2) is under head, so not eatable now because the body hasn't moved away; it's currently occupied.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head leaves (4,2), and the tail may or may not stay, but in this case, since the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so cell (4,2) might be vacated if the tail doesn't stay, but the tail is at (1,2), so when the snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the cell (4,2) will be occupied by the next segment, which is (4,1) moving to (4,2)? Let's see.\n> \n> Current positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), etc.\n> \n> When snake moves Up, head goes to (4,3), then the body: segment 1 (4,1) moves to (4,2), segment 2 (5,1) moves to (4,1)?

The tail is segment 19 at (1,2). To vacate (2,5), we need to move the snake so that the tail moves away from the area, but since the snake is connected, (2,5) will be occupied until the tail reaches there, which might take many turns, and by then the food might expire.\n> \n> Specifically, the distance from tail to (2,5): tail at (1,2), (2,5) is at index 15, so 15 segments away. Each move, the tail moves one step closer to the head, but only if no food eaten. If we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so it takes longer.\n> \n> To make segment 15 the tail, we need to have 4 segments after it removed, but we can't remove segments; we can only add or keep.\n> \n> The tail will eventually reach where segment 15 is, but after 15 moves if no food eaten, or more if food eaten.\n> \n> But food at (2,5) has life span 2, only 2 turns left, so by turn 83 it must be eaten or it disappears.\n> \n> With life span 2 at turn 82, it can be eaten on turn 82 or 83.\n> \n> But on turn 82, it is under body, not accessible.\n> \n> On turn 83, if not eaten on 82, life span 1, still there, but if still under body, not accessible.\n> \n> But we can make it accessible by turn 83?\n> \n> Currently at turn 82, segment 15 at (2,5).\n> \n> If we move in a way that on turn 83, (2,5) is vacated, but it's hard because segments are moving.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 82, we move the snake such that the segment at (2,5) moves away, but when it moves, another segment moves in, so (2,5) is reoccupied immediately unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Since it's not the tail, when segment 15 moves from (2,5), segment 16 moves to (2,5) at the same time, so (2,5) is never vacated; it's always occupied by some segment.\n> \n> The only time a cell is vacated is when the tail leaves it and no new segment comes, which only happens when the tail moves and no food eaten.\n> \n> Other body cells are never vacated during normal movement; they are always occupied by some part of the snake.\n> \n> The only way to vacate (2,5) is if it becomes the tail position and then the tail moves away.\n> \n> But currently, (2,5) is segment 15, so to make it the tail, we need to remove segments after it, but we can't; the tail is fixed until we eat food.\n> \n> The tail will only reach (2,5) after many moves, when the snake has moved enough that the head has advanced, and the tail follows.\n> \n> For example, if we never eat food, after 19 moves, the tail will be where the head was, but since the head moves, it's not fixed.\n> \n> The position (2,5) will be occupied until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (1,2), and the snake body goes to (2,4), (2,5), etc.\n> \n> From the positions, the snake has a segment at (2,5), and the tail is at (1,2), so the path from tail to head: from (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (3,5) etc.\n> \n> So to vacate (2,5), the tail needs to move to (2,5) and then move away.\n> \n> But tail at (1,2), to reach (2,5), it needs to go through (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), so 4 moves if we move directly, but each move the tail advances one segment.\n> \n> After k moves with no food eaten, the tail will be at the position of segment k from the old tail.\n> \n> After 0 moves, tail at segment 19.\n> \n> After 1 move no food, tail at old segment 18 position, but after move, tail at new position.\n> \n> From above, after one move no food, tail moves to old segment 18 position.\n> \n> After two moves, to old segment 17, and so on.\n> \n> So to have tail at (2,5), which was old segment 15, we need to have tail move to old segment 15 position.\n> \n> Since segment 15 is 4 segments ahead of tail (tail 19, so 19-15=4, so 4 segments before tail).\n> \n> Index: tail is 19, segment 15 is 4 positions towards head.\n> \n> After m moves with no food eaten, the tail will be at the position of old segment (19-m).\n> \n> For example, after 0 moves, tail at seg19.\n> \n> After 1 move, tail at old seg18 position.\n> \n> After 2 moves, tail at old seg17 position.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After k moves, tail at old seg (19-k) position.\n> \n> To have tail at old seg15 position, we need k such that 19-k =15, so k=4.\n> \n> After 4 moves with no food eaten, the tail will be at the position that was occupied by old segment 15, which is (2,5).\n> \n> Then, on the next move, if we move and no food eaten, the tail leaves (2,5), and it is vacated.\n> \n> But in this case, for food at (2,5), to eat it, we need to vacate it first, then move head to it.\n> \n> But with life span 2, only 2 turns, we can't do it in time, because it takes at least 4 moves to even get the tail there, and by turn 83 it will be gone.\n> \n> At turn 82, we can't eat it because it's under body.\n> \n> At turn 83, if we could vacate it and move head to it, but on turn 83, after one move from turn 82, the tail is still far, at old seg18 or something.\n> \n> After turn 82 move, if no food, tail at (1,3) or something, not at (2,5).\n> \n> Then on turn 83, tail still not at (2,5), so (2,5) still occupied, can't eat.\n> \n> So it's impossible to eat (2,5) because it will expire before we can vacate it.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,4), which is under segment 17, life span 4, but segment 17 is closer to tail.\n> \n> Tail at seg19 (1,2), seg17 at (1,4), so only 2 segments away.\n> \n> After k moves, tail at old seg (19-k).\n> \n> To have tail at old seg17 position, 19-k=17, k=2.\n> \n> After 2 moves no food, tail at old seg17 position.\n> \n> Then on next move, if no food, tail leaves and vacates.\n> \n> But for (1,4), it was under seg17.\n> \n> After 2 moves no food, tail at old seg17 position, which is (1,4), then on the move after that, if we don't eat food, tail moves away, vacating (1,4).\n> \n> Then head can move to it.\n> \n> But life span 4, at turn 82, so by turn 85.\n> \n> After 2 moves no food, by turn 84, tail at (1,4) if we move appropriately, but let's see positions.\n> \n> At turn 82, seg17 at (1,4)\n> \n> If we move twice with no food eaten, after two moves, tail at old seg17 position, which is (1,4).\n> \n> Then on turn 84, if we move and no food, tail leaves (1,4), vacating it.\n> \n> Then on turn 85, we can move head to (1,4) to eat, but life span 4, at turn 82, after turn 83 life span 3, after turn 84 life span 2, after turn 85 life span 1, so on turn 85 it can be eaten, life span 1, then after turn 85 it disappears.\n> \n> So possible to eat on turn 85 if we vacate on turn 84.\n> \n> But turn 85 is within life span.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5), life span 2, only to turn 83, but we can't vacate by then, so impossible to eat (2,5).

Obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n> \n> Food: (2,5), (1,4), (4,2)\n> \n> (2,5) has life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since it's turn 83, and life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 83, if not eaten, it will be gone. Life span 1 means it disappears after turn 83, so must be eaten on this turn to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) has life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns, i.e., after turn 86.\n> \n> (4,2) has life span 9, so it has many turns left.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake body at position (4,2), which is the second segment. So, according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,2) has food, but it's under the snake body. To eat it, the snake needs to move away from that cell and then later have the head move onto it when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is also occupied by the snake body; let's see, (1,4) is in the snake positions: positions are (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), etc. Snake positions include (1,4), which is the 18th segment or so. List: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: (5,5), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,6), 12: (5,6), 13: (4,6), 14: (3,6), 15: (3,5), 16: (2,5), 17: (2,4), 18: (1,4), 19: (1,3), 20: (1,2).\n> \n> So (1,4) is position 18, and (2,5) is position 16.\n> \n> (2,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake body at (2,5), which is segment 16.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is occupied by segment 18.\n> \n> And (4,2) is occupied by segment 1.\n> \n> For food under the body to be eaten, the body must move away, meaning that cell becomes empty, and then the head must move onto it.\n> \n> But for (2,5), life span is 1, so it must be eaten this turn or it disappears. But it's currently occupied by the snake body, so unless the snake moves in such a way that the head goes to (2,5) this turn, but (2,5) is occupied, so it's impossible to eat it this turn because the head can't move to a cell that's occupied, except for the tail.\n> \n> The rules say: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" only after the body moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (2,5), since it's occupied by the body now, and life span 1, after this turn it disappears. So it cannot be eaten because there's no time for the body to move away and head to move in; this turn it's occupied, so head can't move there. Next turn it would be gone.\n> \n> Therefore, (2,5) food is effectively not available; we can't eat it. It will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is occupied by body, life span 3, so it might be possible to eat later if we free up that cell and move head there.\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied, life span 9, so possible to eat later.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,3), direction Up. Last move was Up to (4,3), so from (4,2) to (4,3).\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with no instant reverse. Since head direction is U, we cannot move Down immediately because that would be reverse to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, meaning the snake was moving Up to reach (4,3). So the opposite direction is Down, which is not allowed next turn.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, L, R. Down is invalid.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (4,3):\n> \n> - Up: (4,4) - what is this? y+1 from (4,3) is (4,4)\n> \n> - Down: (4,2) - but (4,2) is occupied by the body, and also Down is reverse, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> - Left: (3,3)\n> \n> - Right: (5,3)\n> \n> Now, (4,2) is body, so even if Down were allowed, it would be a collision except for tail, but (4,2) is not the tail; tail is at (1,2), which is the last segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), ... tail (1,2). So (4,2) is the second segment, not tail. Moving to (4,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is also occupied? Let's see positions: (5,3) is position 7 in the list, which is body segment.\n> \n> Positions: 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), so (5,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3) - is it occupied? Look at positions: after head (4,3), next is (4,2), so (3,3) is not in positions, I think it's free.\n> \n> List all positions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n> \n> So cells occupied: all these.\n> \n> Now, around head (4,3):\n> \n> - North: (4,4) - not in list, so free?\n> \n> (4,4) is not in positions, but let's confirm: positions have (5,4) at index 8, but not (4,4). So (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> - South: (4,2) - occupied, body segment\n> \n> - West: (3,3) - not in positions, so free?\n> \n> (3,3) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> - East: (5,3) - occupied, position 7: (5,3)\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is within bounds, x=3>0, y=3>0, x<7,y<7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is not relevant here.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Up to (4,4): free\n> \n> - Left to (3,3): free\n> \n> - Right to (5,3): occupied, invalid\n> \n> - Down to (4,2): occupied and reverse direction, invalid\n> \n> So only possible moves: Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, consider the food.\n> \n> First, (2,5) food: life span 1, but occupied by body at (2,5), which is segment 16. Since it's occupied, head can't move there this turn, and after this turn it disappears, so we can't eat it. Ignore.\n> \n> (1,4) food: value 1, life span 3. Currently occupied by segment 18. To eat it, we need to free up (1,4) and have head move there.\n> \n> (4,2) food: value 1, life span 9, occupied by segment 1. Need to free it and move head there later.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (1,2). When the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells get freed as the snake moves, depending on whether it eats or not.\n> \n> If we don't eat, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail becomes free.\n> \n> If we eat, tail doesn't move, so we grow.\n> \n> But to eat food under body, we need that cell to be free first.\n> \n> Now, for (1,4): it's currently occupied, and life span 3. After this turn, life span decreases to 2, then 1, then 0 and disappears after turn 86.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move: head at (4,3), can go Up to (4,4) or Left to (3,3).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> Also, consider the snake's body positions to avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, let's think about the area.\n> \n> The snake is coiled, and we need to find a path to survive and eat food.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) might be tricky because it's near the head but under body.\n> \n> (4,2) is segment 1, which is the neck.

That would be collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the tail reward danger.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to tail cell with food, after eating, the head is on that cell, and the tail is still on that cell because it didn't move, so they occupy the same cell, causing collision.\n> \n> Therefore, it's fatal.\n> \n> If head moves to tail cell with no food, then after move, head is there, tail moves away, no problem.\n> \n> Back to (1,4) food.\n> \n> To eat it safely, we need that when head moves to (1,4), it is not the tail cell, and no adjacent issue.\n> \n> For (1,4), we can eat it on turn 85 if it is the tail and we don't move to it, but if it's tail and we move to it with food, it kills us.\n> \n> On turn 85, if (1,4) is tail, and we move head to (1,4), we die because of tail reward danger.\n> \n> If we move head to (1,4) on turn 84, but on turn 84, (1,4) is occupied by body, not free, so we can't move there.\n> \n> So the only possibility to eat (1,4) is on turn 85, but on turn 85 it might be tail, and eating it would kill us.\n> \n> Let's confirm the timing.\n> \n> Turn 83: start, food at (1,4) with life span 3, occupied by body.\n> \n> After turn 83 action, if no eat, life span decreases to 2.\n> \n> On turn 84, food at (1,4) with life span 2, still occupied (as per earlier, after turn 83 move, (1,4) is occupied by body).\n> \n> Head cannot move to occupied cell except tail, but it's not tail, so cannot move to (1,4) on turn 84.\n> \n> After turn 84 action, no eat, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> On turn 85, food with life span 1.\n> \n> At start of turn 85, (1,4) is tail position, as we calculated earlier, if no eating in between.\n> \n> Then, head can move to (1,4), but since it has food and is tail, eating it causes collision and death.\n> \n> If we don't move to it, it disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> So we cannot eat (1,4) safely; it's impossible to eat without dying or it's occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, (1,4) food is not eatable; we should avoid it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2) food, life span 9, we have time.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by body.\n> \n> To eat it, we need to free the cell first.\n> \n> (4,2) is segment 1 in current positions, index 1: (4,2)\n> \n> As the snake moves, this cell will be freed when that segment moves away.\n> \n> Currently, segment at (4,2) will move to where head was when head moves.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (4,4) or (3,3), then new body 1 will be at (4,3), so (4,2) is vacated?

No.\n> \n> The movement: the head moves to new cell (4,4).\n> \n> Then, the first body segment (index 1) moves to the previous head position (4,3).\n> \n> Then, the second body segment (index 2) moves to the previous position of index 1, which is (4,2).\n> \n> But (4,2) is the same cell, so it stays? No, in terms of cells, when a segment moves to a new cell, it vacates the old cell.\n> \n> So when index 1 moves from (4,2) to (4,3), it vacates (4,2).\n> \n> Then index 2 moves from (4,1) to (4,2), so it occupies (4,2) again.\n> \n> Similarly, all segments shift.\n> \n> For cell (4,2): it was occupied by index 1.\n> \n> After move, index 1 moves to (4,3), so (4,2) is vacated for a moment, but then index 2 moves from (4,1) to (4,2), so (4,2) is reoccupied immediately by the next segment.\n> \n> Therefore, the cell (4,2) is only free if no segment moves into it, which happens if the tail is the one leaving it and no growth.\n> \n> But in this case, since there are segments after, (4,2) is always occupied after the shift.\n> \n> Specifically, in the new positions, (4,2) is occupied by the segment that was previously at (4,1), which is index 2.\n> \n> So the cell (4,2) remains occupied by a body segment after the move; it's never free in this case.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body segment not the tail, when the snake moves, the cell is vacated and immediately reoccupied by the next segment, so it doesn't become free.\n> \n> Only the tail cell can be vacated if we don't eat, or if we eat, no vacate.\n> \n> For a cell to be free, it must be that the tail was there and we moved without eating, or it was never occupied.\n> \n> For food under body like (4,2), it can only be eaten if the snake moves in such a way that at some point, that cell is not occupied, which requires that the segment that was there is the tail and we move the tail away without eating.\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is index 1, far from tail index 20.\n> \n> To free (4,2), we need to have the segment at (4,2) become the tail, which means we need to have the tail \"catch up\" or something, but since the snake is long, it would take many moves, and by then the food life span might expire.\n> \n> Life span of (4,2) is 9, so it might be possible.\n> \n> But let's see the distance from head to tail.\n> \n> The snake has 21 segments.\n> \n> The cell (4,2) is close to head.\n> \n> Perhaps we can eat the food at (4,2) by moving the head away and then back when it's free, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Another way: if the head moves to a direction that the body follows, and the cell is vacated, but as above, it's immediately reoccupied.\n> \n> The only way for a body cell to become free is if it is the tail and we move without eating.\n> \n> For (4,2) to be free, the segment that is currently at (4,2) must be the tail, which means we need to have the tail at that position, but currently tail is at (1,2), so we need to move the snake in a way that the tail reaches (4,2), which would take about 20 moves, and food life span is 9, so not possible within 9 turns.\n> \n> Current turn 83, life span 9, so after 9 turns, on turn 92, it disappears.\n> \n> But to have tail at (4,2), it would take many moves, at least the length of the snake, 21 moves, to have the tail at the current head position, but (4,2) is not head, it's body.\n> \n> The distance from tail to (4,2) is about 19 segments away, so it would take at least 19 moves for the tail to reach where (4,2) is now, but by then the position has changed.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> Practically, for food under the body, it's difficult to eat unless it's near the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is near head, far from tail, so with life span 9, it might be possible if we maneuver, but it's risky and may not be worth it for +1 food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is near tail, but as we saw, we can't eat it safely.\n> \n> So perhaps both foods are not easily eatable, and we should focus on survival and finding new food, but no new food is given, so only these.\n> \n> The food at (4,2) might be eatable if we can free it soon.\n> \n> Since the head is at (4,3), and (4,2) is below, but we can't move down.\n> \n> If we move left or up, the body will follow.\n> \n> Suppose we move up to (4,4), then the segment at (4,2) moves to (4,3), so (4,2) is vacated for a split second, but then the next segment moves to it, so it's not free for the head to move in.\n> \n> The only time a cell is free is when the tail leaves it or it was empty.\n> \n> For (4,2) to be free, we need the snake to have moved so that no segment is there, which requires that the tail was there and we moved.\n> \n> But currently, tail is far, so we can't free (4,2) within few turns.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,4).\n> \n> Therefore, it's likely that we cannot eat any of the existing food, so we should ignore them and focus on not dying.\n> \n> Then, the priority is to find a safe path to move without colliding.\n> \n> Head at (4,3), can go to (4,4) or (3,3).\n> \n> Let's see what is around.\n> \n> First, move Up to (4,4): (4,4) is free, as we saw.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: from (4,4), head direction would be U if we moved up.\n> \n> Then can move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> (4,5): not occupied, free?

I think I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> From the rules: when snake eats food, length increases by one, so when head moves to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn, meaning the new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after moving, the head is at new position, and body segments include the previous positions except the tail if it moved.\n> \n> Typically in snake: on a turn, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed. If food eaten, head moves to food, new segment is added at the position where tail was, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one.\n> \n> But for collision, collision is checked after movement: if head collides with any body segment or wall.\n> \n> Also, for food under body: if a body segment is on a food cell, it can only be eaten if later the body moves away and head moves to it.\n> \n> Now, for (1,4), it is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position in the chain.\n> \n> The snake is moving, so each turn, all segments shift.\n> \n> Let's trace the snake positions over turns.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list with indices for clarity.\n> \n> Head: pos[0] = (3,3)\n> \n> pos[1] = (4,3)\n> \n> pos[2] = (4,2)\n> \n> pos[3] = (4,1)\n> \n> pos[4] = (5,1)\n> \n> pos[5] = (6,1)\n> \n> pos[6] = (6,2)\n> \n> pos[7] = (6,3)\n> \n> pos[8] = (5,3)\n> \n> pos[9] = (5,4)\n> \n> pos[10] = (5,5)\n> \n> pos[11] = (6,5)\n> \n> pos[12] = (6,6)\n> \n> pos[13] = (5,6)\n> \n> pos[14] = (4,6)\n> \n> pos[15] = (3,6)\n> \n> pos[16] = (3,5)\n> \n> pos[17] = (2,5)\n> \n> pos[18] = (2,4)\n> \n> pos[19] = (1,4)  // food here\n> \n> pos[20] = (1,3)  // tail\n> \n> Now, when the snake moves, depending on the direction.\n> \n> Current head direction L, but I choose the action for this turn.\n> \n> I need to choose a move for turn 84.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R, but R is right, which is opposite to current L, so cannot move right because of no instant reverse.

(2,4) is index 19: positions[19] = (2,4), which is near the tail.\n> \n> And food at (1,4) is the tail itself.\n> \n> Special rule: food can spawn under the snake but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (1,4) food: since it's under the tail, and tail will move when the snake moves, unless it's eaten.\n> \n> Head is at (2,3), direction L, so last move was left to (2,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from head (2,3): since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite, which would be instant reverse, not allowed).\n> \n> From (2,3):\n> \n> - L: (1,3)\n> \n> - U: (2,4) but (2,4) is a body segment? positions[19] is (2,4), which is not adjacent to head? Head is (2,3), adjacent are (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is a body segment, specifically index 19, which is near tail but not adjacent to head. Head is at (2,3), so adjacent cells: left (1,3), right (3,3) but right is not possible since direction L, can't reverse to R. Up (2,4), down (2,2).\n> \n> Now, (3,3) is the first body segment, so moving to (3,3) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is also a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> (2,2) might be free or not.\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4)\n> \n> So from head (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: (1,3) — is this occupied? (1,3) not in the list, so should be free, but need to check walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,3) x=1>0, y=3>0, not border, and internal obstacle (5,2), not (1,3), so (1,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Up: (2,4) — but (2,4) is in snake positions, index 19, so occupied by body, cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> - Down: (2,2) — is (2,2) occupied? Not in the list, so free, no wall, since y=2>0, x=2>0.\n> \n> - Right: (3,3) — but (3,3) is the first body segment, index 1, so occupied, collision. Also, cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> Current direction L, so moving R is instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,3): only L to (1,3) or D to (2,2).\n> \n> U to (2,4) is body, R to (3,3) is body and reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only two choices: Left to (1,3) or Down to (2,2).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,4): value 1, life span 2. This is the tail position. Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> - (4,2): value 1, life span 7. This is a body segment, position index 3, (4,2).\n> \n> - (2,4): value 1, life span 10. This is also a body segment, position index 19, (2,4).\n> \n> Since food is under snake body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on it later.\n> \n> For (1,4) food: it's under tail. When snake moves, tail will move if no food eaten, so the food might be accessible later.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,4) life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn 85. So after turn 85, life span decreases to 1, then after turn 86, to 0, gone. So available only on turn 85 and 86, but since it's under tail, we need to move head to it when tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 7, so available until turn 85+6=91? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 85, life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn 85. So it disappears at the beginning of turn 85 + L? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span N, it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Example: life span 2 at turn 85, present on turn 85 and 86, gone on turn 87.\n> \n> Life span 7 at turn 85, present turns 85 to 91, gone on 92.\n> \n> Life span 10, turns 85 to 94, gone on 95.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves at turn 85.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), can move to (1,3) or (2,2).\n> \n> If I move to (1,3), that's left.\n> \n> Then new head position (1,3), and since no food eaten, tail moves, so tail (1,4) moves to next position, which is (2,4)? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, if not eating, tail is removed.\n> \n> So if head moves to (1,3), which is empty, no food, so tail (1,4) is removed, and body shifts, new tail is the previous segment, which was (2,4)? Positions: after move, head is at (1,3), then the old head (2,3) becomes new segment 1, and so on, down to tail (1,4) removed.\n> \n> Snake positions: before move: [ (2,3), (3,3), ..., (1,4) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3) without eating: new positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to (2,4) ], and (1,4) is removed since tail moved.\n> \n> The segment that was tail (1,4) is gone, and the new tail is the segment that was second to last, which is (2,4)? Positions: indices 0 to 20.\n> \n> After move: head to (1,3), then positions become: (1,3) as new head, then (2,3) (which was head), then (3,3), ..., up to (2,4) (index 19), and (1,4) (index 20) is removed. So new positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] and (2,4) is now the tail?

It's turn 86, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,3), and the body segments follow. The snake is 21 segments long.

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. It's 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Wait, no: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those lines are walls, so the snake can be from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are given as \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So grid: rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7. Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,2).\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (1,3)\n> \n> Then: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> Tail is (2,4)\n> \n> Since head direction is L, it was moving left to (1,3) from previous position. Previous position before (1,3) must have been (2,3), but (2,3) is the second segment, so from turn 85, head was at (2,3), moved left to (1,3) on turn 86.\n> \n> Current turn is 86, head at (1,3), direction L.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (1,4): value 1, life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> - (4,2): value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,4): value 1, life span 9\n> \n> (2,4) is also the tail position! Snake positions end with (2,4), so tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> And there's food at (2,4) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> But the food can be under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically, for (2,4), it's the tail, so if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, and then head moves to (2,4), it could eat it, but there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the snake grows, so the new tail would be where the head was, but since head moves to tail position, and tail moves away, but with growth, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide immediately.\n> \n> Rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (1,3), tail at (2,4). Are they adjacent?\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> (1,3) and (2,4): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or same y with diff 1.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) but (2,3) is body.\n> \n> Head (1,3), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,4)\n> \n> - Down: (1,2)\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) but x=0 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) which is the second segment, body.\n> \n> Now tail at (2,4): adjacent cells would be (2,3), (2,5), (1,4), (3,4) but (3,4) not in positions, etc.\n> \n> Head (1,3) and tail (2,4): |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n> \n> Therefore, not adjacent. So no immediate Tail Reward Danger for eating the food at tail if possible.\n> \n> But to eat the food at (2,4), which is currently occupied by tail, we need the tail to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, each turn the tail moves when the snake advances, unless it eats food.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 86, tail is at (2,4). If the snake doesn't eat, next turn tail will move to the next position, but the body segments shift.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> But since there is food under the tail, when the tail moves away, that cell becomes empty, and if head moves there later, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in this case, food at (2,4) has life span 9, so it will be there for a while.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate action.\n> \n> Current head at (1,3), direction L. Since direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) next turn because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: U, D, L. But left is to (0,3), which is x=0, wall, so invalid. So only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> Head at (1,3), moving left to here, so current direction into (1,3) is from right, so direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - U: up to (1,4)\n> \n> - D: down to (1,2)\n> \n> - L: left to (0,3) — wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: right to (2,3) — but (2,3) is body segment, collision if I move there.\n> \n> Moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> (2,3) is not tail; tail is (2,4). (2,3) is the second segment, so if I move right to (2,3), head touches body, collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to wall, death.\n> \n> So only safe moves: U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, (1,4) has food! Food at (1,4) with value 1, life span 1. If I move up to (1,4), I eat it, since it's not under body? (1,4) is not in snake positions, I think. Let me check snake positions: list is from (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,5), (2,4). No (1,4), so it's empty, and food is there.\n> \n> So moving to (1,4) is possible and I eat the food.\n> \n> But life span is 1, meaning after this turn, it disappears, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> (1,4) has life span 1, and current turn is 86, so if not eaten on turn 86, it vanishes.\n> \n> Now, moving down to (1,2) is also possible, but no food there.\n> \n> If I move up to (1,4), I eat the food, snake grows to 22 segments, and head is now at (1,4).\n> \n> But after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, which is (2,4), but since I grew, the segment before tail is added, so positions: new head (1,4), then the previous head (1,3) becomes second segment, and so on, down to tail (2,4) still, but since I ate, tail stays, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So the new tail is the position where the tail was before movement.\n> \n> Before move: head at (1,3), tail at (2,4)\n> \n> After moving to (1,4) and eating: head now at (1,4), then the segments: (1,4) is new head, followed by (1,3) which was head, then (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to (2,4) which was tail, but since I ate, the tail doesn't advance, so (2,4) remains as the last segment? No.\n> \n> Sequence: positions are a list. When head moves to new cell, if no eat, tail is removed. If eat, tail is not removed; so the new position list has the new head, and all previous segments, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,4) and eating: new positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] and since I ate, I add a new segment? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is not added immediately; the growth happens at the tail.\n> \n> Standard: after moving to food, the snake grows, meaning that the tail segment from the previous state is kept, whereas normally it is removed.\n> \n> So before move: positions: H(1,3), B1(2,3), B2(3,3), ..., B19(3,5), B20(2,5), T(2,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,4) and eating: new head at (1,4), then the previous head (1,3) becomes new B1, then B1 (2,3) becomes new B2, and so on, down to T (2,4) becomes the new second last, and since I ate, the tail position from before is not removed, so the new tail is still (2,4)? No.\n> \n> Let's index the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,4), 12: (5,5), 13: (6,5), 14: (6,6), 15: (5,6), 16: (4,6), 17: (3,6), 18: (3,5), 19: (2,5), 20: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (1,4) and eating: new head at (1,4), then the previous segments from 0 to 20 are all kept, so new positions: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (2,5), (2,4) ] and since I ate, the length increases, so the tail (2,4) is still there, and it's now position 21, but the last segment is still (2,4), and the one before is (2,5), so tail at (2,4).\n> \n> But (2,4) is where the food was, but the food is eaten, so it's gone.\n> \n> In this case, after eating, the snake has 22 segments, head at (1,4), tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Now, importantly, (2,4) is the tail, and there might be food, but it's eaten now.\n> \n> But in this move, I'm eating (1,4), not (2,4).\n> \n> Now, if I don't eat, and move down to (1,2), then no growth, head moves to (1,2), tail moves to (2,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> If move down to (1,2): new head at (1,2), then the body segments: previous head (1,3) becomes segment 1, (2,3) becomes segment 2, ..., up to (2,5) becomes segment 19, and tail (2,4) is removed, so new tail is (3,5) or something.\n> \n> Positions after move without eating: new head at (1,2), then [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5), (2,5) ] and tail is now (2,5), since (2,4) is removed.\n> \n> Index: after move, positions: [ (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), ..., (3,5), (2,5) ] and (2,4) is gone. So tail at (2,5).\n> \n> But (2,4) had food, and when tail moves away, (2,4) is now empty with food, which can be eaten later.\n> \n> But life span is 9, so it has time.\n> \n> Now, back to choice: at turn 86, I can move U to (1,4) and eat the food, or D to (1,2) to avoid it or go elsewhere.\n> \n> But the food at (1,4) will disappear if not eaten now, so if I don't eat it, I lose the opportunity.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.

It's turn 87, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly for y. Let me confirm:\n> \n> - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6. That's a 6x6 grid, but positions go from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,4), and the direction is Up. Let me list the snake body:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> That's 22 segments. Let me count: positions from (1,4) to (2,4) – that's 22 points. Snake length is 22.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,2), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including this one, so on turn 92 it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (2,4) has life span 8, disappears after turn 87+8=95.\n> \n> Current turn is 87, so:\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): disappears after turn 87 + 5 - 1? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life span N, it appears for N turns, starting from the turn it's spawned. On turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it is present for N turns.\n> \n> For example, if spawned on turn T with life span N, it is available on turns T, T+1, ..., T+N-1, and disappears before turn T+N.\n> \n> But in this input, it's given at turn 87 with life span, so for (4,2), life span 5, so it was spawned on some turn, but we don't know when. The life span is the remaining life at turn 87.\n> \n> Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" – so the life span is given for the current turn, meaning how many turns left including this one.\n> \n> For (4,2): life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns 87,88,89,90,91, and disappears before turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): life span 8, can be eaten from 87 to 94, disappears before 95.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,4) with direction Up. So last move was Up to (1,4) from (1,3)? Positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), so yes, it came from down, so direction Up means moving north, increasing y.\n> \n> Grid: I assume (1,1) is bottom-left? But in coordinates, usually y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so (1,1) is bottom-left, (1,6) top-left, etc. Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – so if y increases, it's up.\n> \n> In positions, for example, (1,4) to (1,3) to (2,3), etc.\n> \n> (1,4) to (1,3) is down, so moving from (1,3) to (1,4) is U, y from 3 to 4.\n> \n> Similarly, from (1,3) to (2,3) is right, so direction was R at that point.\n> \n> But current head direction is U, meaning the snake is facing up.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because no instant reverse. So options: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, from (1,4), what are the adjacent cells?\n> \n> - U: (1,5)\n> \n> - D: (1,3) – but that's the body, and also reverse, so not allowed.\n> \n> - L: (0,4) – but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,4)\n> \n> So only possible moves are U to (1,5) or R to (2,4).\n> \n> L is to (0,4) which is wall, D is reverse and also body, so only U and R are valid.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) has food! (2,4) is a food position with value 1.\n> \n> But (2,4) is also part of the snake body? Let's see snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), ..., up to (2,4) which is the last segment? Positions: ... (2,5), (2,4) – yes, (2,4) is the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n> \n> So the segments are in order: head (1,4), then body: (1,3), (2,3), ..., and tail is (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (2,4), that's the tail. Normally, moving to tail is safe because the tail will move away, so head can occupy where tail was without collision.\n> \n> But here, (2,4) has food! Positive food.\n> \n> Now, rule about tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> First, is head adjacent to tail?

Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In this case: if head moves to (2,4), which has food, so:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,4)\n> \n> - Since food is eaten, snake grows, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added. But the tail was at (2,4), but head is moving there, so the cell (2,4) is now head, and since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, but it's the same cell? Confusion.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> Normally, without food: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away.\n> \n> With food: head moves to food cell, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one.\n> \n> But if the head moves to the tail position:\n> \n> - The tail position is occupied by the tail segment.\n> \n> - When head moves to that cell, two things: first, the tail segment will move only if no food is eaten, but if food is eaten, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell with food, then after movement, the head is on that cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> But if the head moves to the tail cell, and that cell has food, then:\n> \n> - Head moves to tail cell.\n> \n> - Since food is eaten, the tail segment does not move; it stays, but now head and tail are on the same cell? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> The rule clarifies: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Upon eating, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail remains in place, but since the food was on the tail cell, and tail remains, it might cause collision.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail cell has food, so when head moves there, it eats food, so tail should not move, meaning the segment that was tail stays at its position, but the head is now on that same position, so immediate collision.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> Moreover, the rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" – after eating, a new segment is added, but since tail didn't move, the new segment is added at the old tail position, but head is there, so collision.\n> \n> So, moving to (2,4) to eat the food would cause death because head collides with the (now stationary) tail or the new segment.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move to (2,4) this turn; it's deadly.\n> \n> So, moving R to (2,4) is invalid because it would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move is U to (1,5).\n> \n> But is (1,5) safe?\n> \n> Let me check what is at (1,5).\n> \n> From snake positions, (1,5) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=1, y=5 – borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,5) is within 1-6, so no wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: only (5,2), not (1,5).\n> \n> So (1,5) is free.\n> \n> So I can move U to (1,5).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns, as per the instruction.\n> \n> First, on turn 87, I must move, and only U is possible, since R is deadly.\n> \n> So action for turn 87: U to (1,5)\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake head is at (1,5), and the body: since no food eaten, the tail moves away.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head moves to (1,5)\n> \n> - Each segment moves: the segment that was at (1,4) moves to (1,5)?

No.\n> \n> The tail segment was at (3,5), and we add a new segment at (3,5), so it becomes the new tail, and the old tail is now the second last.\n> \n> So positions: new head (2,4), then the existing body segments in order: seg1 at (1,5), seg2 at (1,4), ..., seg21 at (3,5), and new seg22 at (3,5) -- but both seg21 and seg22 at (3,5), which is impossible.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In the position list, when snake grows, the head moves to new position, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there, but that means the position is occupied, but it's the same segment or new?\n> \n> Typically, the body segments do not move when food is eaten; only the head moves to the food cell, and the tail stays, so the snake gains length.\n> \n> For example, before eating: head at A, body B C D E tail F.\n> \n> After eating food at G: head moves to G, body still B C D E F, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at F, so new segments: head G, body B C D E F, and new tail F (but F is duplicate).\n> \n> No: the new segment is added at the position of the tail, so the tail segment remains, and it becomes the new last body segment, and the new segment is at the same position? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify.\n> \n> Upon eating food:\n> - The head moves to the food cell.\n> - The body segments do not move.\n> - A new segment is created at the current tail position, so the tail position now has two segments? No.\n> \n> In terms of the snake, the length increases by one, so the tail position stays, but it is not moved from, so the cell is occupied, and the new segment is added there, meaning the tail cell has the tail segment, and it doesn't move, so the snake occupies the same cells plus the new head position.\n> \n> For example, positions before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After eating at P: head moves to P, body [B1, B2, ..., T] remain, and since food eaten, T does not move, so the positions are [P, H, B1, B2, ..., T] but H is the old head, which is now B1.\n> \n> Better: the new position list is: new head at food cell, then the old head position, then the old body positions in order, and the old tail position is still there with the tail segment.\n> \n> So the list becomes: [new_head, old_head, old_body1, old_body2, ..., old_tail]\n> \n> So in this case, before move: positions: head (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4) and eating food:\n> \n> New head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then the old head becomes the first body segment: (2,5)\n> \n> Then the old body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so new tail at (3,5)\n> \n> But (3,5) is already in the list as the last segment, so now there are two segments at (3,5)? No, the new segment is added at the same position, so the position (3,5) has one segment, but it is now the second last, and the new tail is at (3,5), but it's the same cell.\n> \n> I think it's fine; the cell is occupied, but the snake has multiple segments, but each cell has one segment.\n> \n> In the list, the positions are unique; so when we add the new segment, it is at the old tail position, so the position (3,5) is now occupied by the new tail, and the old tail is now the second last.\n> \n> In the sequence, the new position list is: head at (2,4), then first body at old head (2,5), then second body at old first body (1,5), and so on, up to the old tail at (3,5) as the second last body, and new tail at (3,5) -- but that's the same position, so we can't have two segments at the same cell.\n> \n> I think I have a fundamental mistake.\n> \n> In standard snake, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell. The new head position is the food cell, and the body includes all previous positions except that the tail stays, so the length increases.\n> \n> For example, positions before: [A, B, C, D] with D tail.\n> \n> Head at A, tail at D.\n> \n> Eat food at E: head moves to E, the body becomes [A, B, C], and D remains, so new positions: [E, A, B, C, D] with D tail.\n> \n> Yes, that's it.\n> \n> So in this case, before eating: positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] head (2,5), tail (3,5)\n> \n> After moving to (2,4) and eating:\n> \n> New head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then the old head becomes first body: (2,5)\n> \n> Then the old body segments in order: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> And since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the last position (3,5) remains, and it is the new tail.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> Length 23 now.\n> \n> And the food at (2,4) is consumed.\n> \n> No collision, because (2,4) was empty before.\n> \n> So it's safe.\n> \n> Back to turn 88: from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> Or move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is tail, no food, so moving there is safe.\n> \n> But eating the food is good, score +1, length increase.\n> \n> So I should do that.\n> \n> For turn 88, if I moved R on turn 88 to (2,5), then on turn 89, I can move D to (2,4) to eat.\n> \n> But on turn 88, from (1,5), I could have moved U to (1,6), then to (2,6), etc., but that might not get food soon.\n> \n> Since (2,4) food has long life span, but (4,2) has shorter life span, only 4 turns left after turn 87.\n> \n> At turn 88, life span 4 for (4,2), so if not eaten by turn 91, it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 87: life span 5, so available on turns 87,88,89,90,91.\n> \n> Turn 88: available 88,89,90,91 (4 turns)\n> \n> Turn 89: 3 turns left, etc.\n> \n> (2,4) has life span 8 at 87, so available until turn 94.\n> \n> So (4,2) is more urgent to eat if possible.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, at position seg7: (4,2) after turn 87 move.\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, and head move there.\n> \n> Currently, it's under the body, so I need to free that cell and then move head there.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves, that segment might move away.\n> \n> In the current position, (4,2) is occupied by seg7, which is not the tail, so when the snake moves, it may move away.\n> \n> But it depends on the path.\n> \n> Since I am at (1,5), and (4,2) is at bottom-left, I need to go there.\n> \n> But with the internal obstacle at (5,2), it might be tricky.\n> \n> First, for turn 87, I must move U to (1,5).\n> \n> Then for turn 88, I can choose U or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (2,5), then on turn 89, I can move D to (2,4) to eat the food at (2,4).\n> \n> Then after that, head at (2,4), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then I can plan to go for (4,2).\n> \n> If I move U to (1,6) on turn 88, then I am at corner, and I have to move R to (2,6) on turn 89, then from there, I can go down or right, but it might take longer to reach (4,2).\n> \n> Since (4,2) has short life, I should prioritize eating it.\n> \n> But it's occupied now.\n> \n> Let's see when (4,2) will be free.\n> \n> Currently at turn 87 after move, seg7 is at (4,2).\n> \n> When the snake moves, if no food eaten, seg7 will move to a new position.\n> \n> For example, on turn 88, if I move from (1,5) to (2,5), as above, then seg7 moves to old seg6 position, which is (4,3)?

That seems odd.

Internal obstacle at (5,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by the snake? No, (4,2) is a snake body segment, but there's also food at (4,2) with life span 3 and value 1. Food at (4,2,3,1) means position (4,2), life span 3, value 1. But the snake body is at (4,2) according to the positions list. Let me list the snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (1,6) head\n> \n> 1: (1,5)\n> \n> 2: (1,4)\n> \n> 3: (1,3)\n> \n> 4: (2,3)\n> \n> 5: (3,3)\n> \n> 6: (4,3)\n> \n> 7: (4,2)  // this is where food is, but snake is here\n> \n> 8: (4,1)\n> \n> 9: (5,1)\n> \n> 10: (6,1)\n> \n> 11: (6,2)\n> \n> 12: (6,3)\n> \n> 13: (5,3)\n> \n> 14: (5,4)\n> \n> 15: (5,5)\n> \n> 16: (6,5)\n> \n> 17: (6,6)\n> \n> 18: (5,6)\n> \n> 19: (4,6)\n> \n> 20: (3,6)\n> \n> 21: (3,5)  // tail\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up.

So on turn 89, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 91? Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) with life span 3 on turn 89: on turn 89, life span 3; after turn 89, it decreases to 2; after turn 90, to 1; after turn 91, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 89, 90, or 91.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life span 6: disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 9: disappears after turn 97.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (1,6), moving up. But (1,6) is the top row since y=1 to 6, and walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is the top row. Moving up would be to (1,7), but y=7 is a wall, so moving up is invalid? Head is at (1,6), direction U, which is (x,y+1), so (1,6+1) = (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so it's a wall collision if I move up. But the snake is currently moving up, but at (1,6), up is wall. How is it moving up? Perhaps it just arrived here.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to get to (1,6). From where? Previous position: before head was at (1,5) on turn 88, I assume, and moved up to (1,6) on turn 89. But (1,6) is valid? y=6 is within 1 to 6, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable area. So (1,6) is at the top, but it's not a wall; wall is at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is the upper boundary, but not a wall cell. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> So (1,6) is a valid cell, not a wall. Moving up from (1,6) to (1,7) would be y=7, which is wall, so invalid move.\n> \n> But the head direction is U, meaning it is facing up, but since it's at (1,6), moving up is impossible because of wall. So on this turn, I must choose a different direction, but I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly? Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) immediately, because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So current direction is U, so I cannot move D on turn 89. Possible moves: U, L, R. But U is to (1,7) which is wall, so invalid. So only L or R possible.\n> \n> L: left to (0,6), but x=0 is wall, so invalid. x=0 is wall, so (0,6) is not playable.\n> \n> R: right to (2,6)\n> \n> (1,6) to R: (2,6)\n> \n> (2,6) is a food position?

No: in the sequence, the tail remains, so the last segment is still (3,5), but we added a new segment at the head, effectively.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, and the head moves to new cell, so the new snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the tail position doesn't change that turn.\n> \n> Now, in this case, moving to (2,6) seems possible, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: Tail Reward Danger.

Moving down to (2,4) at turn 91 eats another food for +1 score and growth, and subsequent moves (right to (3,4) and up to (3,5)) avoid immediate risks and position the snake to access open areas for long-term survival, ignoring the inaccessible food at (4,2) due to body coverage. This prioritizes scoring opportunities while maintaining mobility in the constrained grid.\n",

It's turn 90, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) are the corners, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be in cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, I think. But let's check the snake positions to be sure.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> All these positions have x between 1 and 6, y between 1 and 6, so yes, the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2) is a wall.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 2\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> Both are positive food, since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,2), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 90, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 91? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Or after L turns from now?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life_span given.\n> \n> And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if at turn t, life_span is N, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, countdown is N\n> \n> - After turn t, it decreases to N-1 for turn t+1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn?

So after turn t+L-1, it disappears? Let's see.\n> \n> For example, life_span 2 at turn 90: it will be there on turn 90 and 91, and disappear at the start of turn 92 or after turn 91?\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 90, countdown=2.\n> \n> After turn 90 is executed, countdown becomes 1 for turn 91.\n> \n> After turn 91 is executed, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn 92 or after turn 91?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so I think after N turns from now, it disappears.\n> \n> \"After N turns\" means N turns later.\n> \n> So if at turn t, life_span N, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – and N is life_span.\n> \n> Also, \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + (N-1): countdown = 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown = 0, and it disappears after this turn? But the turn when countdown is 0, it should still be there at the start, but after the turn, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify exactly, but I think for safety, we can assume that food with life_span L at turn t will be available until the end of turn t + L - 1, and disappear before turn t + L.\n> \n> For (4,2) at turn 90, life_span 2: so it will be available on turn 90 and 91, and disappear before turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life_span 5: available until turn 94 (since turn 90,91,92,93,94, disappear before 95).\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is R, meaning right, so last move was to the right, to (2,6).\n> \n> Current head position: (2,6)\n> \n> Snake is moving right, so from previous position, it came from left, I assume. Positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), so it moved from (1,6) to (2,6), so direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: current direction is R, so I cannot move left (L) next turn, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it's opposite to current direction R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and snake body.\n> \n> Snake body: the positions are given, but I need to know which cells are occupied by the snake except the tail, because when the snake moves, the tail moves, so only the head and body except the tail are solid, but when moving, the head moves to a new position, and the tail leaves its position, so collision is with any body part except that the tail cell is safe to enter if it moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's a collision. If it moves to the current tail position, it's ok, because after the move, the tail moves forward, so that cell is free.\n> \n> Also, walls: if head moves to a wall cell, collision.\n> \n> Now, food: (4,2) and (2,4).\n> \n> (4,2) is a food position, but let's see if it's under the snake or not.\n> \n> Snake positions: look at (4,2) is in the list: positions include (4,2), which is part of the snake body.\n> \n> Specifically, from the list: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), etc. So (4,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the body, and can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, food at (4,2) with value 1, life span 2.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by a body segment, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (4,2), and then head moves to (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is not in the snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Now, let's list all snake positions to understand the body.\n> \n> Snake: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n> \n> Number of segments: 23 positions, so snake length is 23.\n> \n> Head at (2,6), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Tail is (3,5), since last in list.\n> \n> Now, current head position (2,6), direction R, so from (1,6) to (2,6).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Down (D): (2,5) – is this free?

(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), ... no (2,5), and not a wall, so (2,5) should be free? y=5 is between 1 and 6, x=2, not wall except border, but borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,5) is inside.\n> \n> Internal obstacle only (5,2), so (2,5) is empty.\n> \n> - Left (L): (1,6) but (1,6) is the second segment of the snake, which is not the tail. Tail is (3,5), so (1,6) is body, not tail.

Snake positions: (3,6) is in the list, it's the 22nd position: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), so (3,6) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (3,5). So moving to (3,6) would be collision.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) is at (3,6), which is not wall, but occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves: only Down to (2,5) seems valid?

No.\n> \n> When food eaten: head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (2,4), then the previous head (2,5), then all previous body segments including the tail.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), ..., up to tail (3,6)\n> \n> After eating at (2,4): new head (2,4), then (2,5), then (2,6), then (1,6), ..., up to (3,6), so 24 segments, tail still (3,6) for now, but when it moves, it will change.\n> \n> (4,2) is still occupied by a body segment.\n> \n> If I don't eat (2,4) and move right to (3,5) at turn 91, then no growth, snake moves, positions: head to (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), etc., tail (3,6) removed, so new tail is (4,6) or something.\n> \n> But let's focus on (4,2) food.\n> \n> (4,2) is currently occupied, and to eat it, I need head to move there when it's free.\n> \n> At turn 91, if I move in a way that the segment at (4,2) moves.\n> \n> The body segment at (4,2) will move only if the snake moves in a certain way.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves such that the body part at (4,2) is not the tail and the snake turns, it might move.\n> \n> But it's deep in the body.\n> \n> Let's see the position of (4,2) in the body.\n> \n> From the positions after turn 90 move: (4,2) is at index 10, which is not near the head or tail.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), tail at (3,6).\n> \n> (4,2) is far.\n> \n> To vacate (4,2), I need to move the snake so that when the body moves, (4,2) is left.\n> \n> But since the snake is long, it will take many moves for that segment to move, and by then, the food might disappear.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) has life span only until turn 91; it will disappear after turn 91.\n> \n> At turn 91, it is still there, but if not eaten during turn 91, it disappears.\n> \n> During turn 91, when I move, if I move to (4,2), I can eat it if it's free.\n> \n> But at the start of turn 91, (4,2) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there directly; it would be collision.\n> \n> For the food to be eatable, the body must first move away, which happens when the snake moves and that segment advances, but in this case, since it's not the tail, when the snake moves, the segment at (4,2) will move to the next position in the path, depending on the movement.\n> \n> For example, if at turn 91, I move the head, the body segments shift, so the segment that was at (4,2) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> Let's simulate the body movement.\n> \n> At turn 91, if I move the head to a new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for example, from after turn 90 positions: head (2,5), body0 (2,6), body1 (1,6), body2 (1,5), body3 (1,4), body4 (1,3), body5 (2,3), body6 (3,3), body7 (4,3), body8 (4,2), body9 (4,1), body10 (5,1), etc.\n> \n> body8 is at (4,2).\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, say to (2,4) or (3,5), then:\n> \n> - New head position\n> \n> - Then body0 moves to where head was, (2,5)\n> \n> - Body1 moves to where body0 was, (2,6)\n> \n> - Body2 moves to where body1 was, (1,6)\n> \n> - Body3 moves to where body2 was, (1,5)\n> \n> - Body4 moves to where body3 was, (1,4)\n> \n> - Body5 moves to where body4 was, (1,3)\n> \n> - Body6 moves to where body5 was, (2,3)\n> \n> - Body7 moves to where body6 was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Body8 moves to where body7 was, (4,3)\n> \n> - Body9 moves to where body8 was, (4,2) — body8 was at (4,2), but body8 moves to (4,3), so the cell (4,2) is vacated by body8, and body9 moves to (4,2) if no change, but let's see.\n> \n> After head moves, the new position of body8: it moves to where body7 was, which is (4,3)\n> \n> Then body9 moves to where body8 was, which was (4,2), so body9 is now at (4,2)\n> \n> Similarly, body10 moves to where body9 was, (4,1), and so on.\n> \n> So the cell (4,2) is now occupied by body9 after the move, not vacated.\n> \n> In fact, since the body shifts, the segment that was at (4,2) moves to (4,3), and a different segment moves to (4,2), so the cell (4,2) is still occupied by some body part after each move, unless it is the tail position and not grown.\n> \n> But the tail is at (3,6), not near.\n> \n> Specifically, for (4,2), it is always occupied because there is a body segment there; when one moves away, another moves in, since the snake is long and not straight.\n> \n> In this case, from the positions, body8 at (4,2) moves to (4,3) when head moves, and body9 at (4,1) moves to (4,2), so (4,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move again, it continues.\n> \n> Only when the tail moves away from a position, it might be vacated, but tail is far.\n> \n> So for (4,2), it will remain occupied until the tail reaches near, but tail is at (3,6), which is not close, and food will disappear after turn 91, so I cannot eat (4,2) before it disappears. It's impossible to eat it because the body is always on it until it disappears.\n> \n> At turn 91, after the move, if I do nothing, (4,2) is still occupied, and it disappears after turn 91.\n> \n> So I should ignore (4,2) food; it's not eatable.\n> \n> Focus on (2,4) food.\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4), free, with life span 5, so I have time.\n> \n> Back to turn 90: I must move down to (2,5), only choice.\n> \n> Then at turn 91, head at (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) to eat the food, or right to (3,5).\n> \n> If I eat at (2,4), I grow to 24, and head at (2,4).\n> \n> Then from there, I need to think further.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (3,6), head at (2,5), not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) and (3,6) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent is up, down, left, right, so (2,5) adjacent to (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5). Not (3,6), which is diagonal.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, at turn 91, if I move down to (2,4), I eat food, grow.\n> \n> Then head at (2,4).\n> \n> From (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,5) but after eating, at turn 91, after move to (2,4), the position (2,5) is now the second segment, so moving up to (2,5) would be collision.\n> \n> - D: (2,3) - what is there?

So (0,0) is bottom-left, (0,7) top-left, (7,0) bottom-right, (7,7) top-right. y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> In snake positions, head is (2,4). Direction is D, so moving down, meaning towards lower y.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,4), moving down, so next move if continue down would be to (2,3).\n> \n> But let's see the body: positions are listed head first: (2,4) is head, then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), etc.\n> \n> (2,4) to (2,5)? If head is at (2,4) and moving down (D), but (2,5) has higher y, which is up, so that can't be right.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction\": D, which is current direction of movement.\n> \n> But the positions: head at (2,4), then next segment at (2,5), which is up, so if head was moving down to (2,4), previous position was (2,5)? Let's list positions in order.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: (2,4) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (1,6), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (6,1), 14: (6,2), 15: (6,3), 16: (5,3), 17: (5,4), 18: (5,5), 19: (6,5), 20: (6,6), 21: (5,6), 22: (4,6), 23: (3,6) tail.\n> \n> Now, from head (2,4) to (2,5): that's an increase in y, so moving up. But direction is given as D, down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the direction it is facing or moving to next? But the state says \"Snake Head Direction\": D, meaning it is moving down.\n> \n> But from the positions, if head is at (2,4) and previous position was (2,5), that means it moved from (2,5) to (2,4), which is down, so direction D is correct for the current movement.\n> \n> Let's see the sequence: positions are listed from head to tail, so at turn t, head is at position 0, and it moved to that position from position 1 in the previous turn.\n> \n> So at turn 92, head is at (2,4), and it came from (2,5), so it moved down to (2,4) from (2,5). So current direction is down, D.\n> \n> Next move: from (2,4), it can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so cannot move U (up) next turn. So possible moves from (2,4) are D, L, R.\n> \n> - D: down to (2,3)\n> \n> - L: left to (1,4)\n> \n> - R: right to (3,4)\n> \n> But need to check for collisions.\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cannot move to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, food positions: only one food given: (1,6) with value 1, life_span 10.\n> \n> Food: ( (1,6), value=1, life_span=10 )\n> \n> But life_span 10, and current turn 92, so it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning on turn 102 it might be gone? Life-span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 92, life_span=10, so after 10 turns, on turn 102, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 92 to 101 inclusive? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 92, countdown=10, after turn 92, countdown=9, ..., after turn 101, countdown=0, and it disappears before turn 102 or after? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So if at turn t, life_span=N, then at turn t, countdown=N, after turn t, countdown=N-1, ..., after turn t + N - 1, countdown=1, after turn t + N, countdown=0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> Here, food at (1,6) with life_span=10 at turn 92, so it can be eaten from turn 92 to 101 inclusive.\n> \n> But turn 92 is current turn, so we can eat it now if head moves to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, where is (1,6)? In snake positions: positions include (1,6) as index 3: (1,6) is part of the body.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), etc. So (1,6) is the fourth segment, not the head.\n> \n> Food is at (1,6), but (1,6) is occupied by the snake body. The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So currently, food is under the body at (1,6), so to eat it, we need the body to move away from (1,6), and then head moves to (1,6).\n> \n> But the body will move when the snake moves. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the cell (1,6) might be vacated if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (1,6) moves.\n> \n> Let's see the current snake body.\n> \n> The snake is long, 24 segments.\n> \n> Positions: let's list all for clarity:\n> \n> 0: (2,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,6)\n> \n> 3: (1,6)\n> \n> 4: (1,5)\n> \n> 5: (1,4)\n> \n> 6: (1,3)\n> \n> 7: (2,3)\n> \n> 8: (3,3)\n> \n> 9: (4,3)\n> \n> 10: (4,2)\n> \n> 11: (4,1)\n> \n> 12: (5,1)\n> \n> 13: (6,1)\n> \n> 14: (6,2)\n> \n> 15: (6,3)\n> \n> 16: (5,3)\n> \n> 17: (5,4)\n> \n> 18: (5,5)\n> \n> 19: (6,5)\n> \n> 20: (6,6)\n> \n> 21: (5,6)\n> \n> 22: (4,6)\n> \n> 23: (3,6) tail\n> \n> Food at (1,6), which is currently occupied by segment 3.\n> \n> To eat the food at (1,6), we need the snake to move such that segment 3 moves away from (1,6), and then head moves to (1,6).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So when head moves, segment 0 (head) goes to new cell, segment 1 goes to where head was, segment 2 goes to where segment 1 was, and so on, and tail segment leaves its position.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move, the position (1,6) will be occupied by segment 2, which was at (2,6), because segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was? Let's see.\n> \n> After one move:\n> \n> - New head position: depends on move\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to old head position (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (2,6)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> - Segment 23 (tail) leaves (3,6)\n> \n> So position (1,6) was occupied by segment 3. After one move, segment 3 moves to (2,6), so (1,6) is vacated only if no other segment moves there, but since segments move to previous positions, (1,6) is now empty because segment 3 left it and no one else is moving directly to it; it's a free cell now.\n> \n> After any move, the cell that was the tail position is vacated, and other cells shift.\n> \n> In this case, before move, (1,6) has segment 3.\n> \n> After head moves to a new position, say to (x,y), then:\n> \n> - New position 0: (x,y)\n> \n> - Position 1: old pos 0 = (2,4)\n> \n> - Position 2: old pos 1 = (2,5)\n> \n> - Position 3: old pos 2 = (2,6)\n> \n> - Position 4: old pos 3 = (1,6)  // segment 4 moves to (1,6)\n> \n> - Etc.\n> \n> Segment 4 was at (1,5), and after move, it moves to old position of segment 3, which is (1,6). So (1,6) is now occupied by segment 4, not vacated.\n> \n> The food is at (1,6), and after one move, segment 4 moves to (1,6), so it's still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> The cell (1,6) remains occupied by the snake because segment 4 moves into it when segment 3 moves out.\n> \n> Let's think: at time t, cell (1,6) has segment 3.\n> \n> At time t+1, after a move:\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was at time t, which is (2,6)\n> \n> - Then segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was at time t, which is (1,6)\n> \n> So (1,6) is now occupied by segment 4.\n> \n> Similarly, the only cell that becomes empty is the old tail position, (3,6) in this case.\n> \n> For the food at (1,6) to be accessible, we need the snake to move such that (1,6) is vacated.\n> \n> That happens only if the segment that is at (1,6) moves away and no other segment moves in, but in the normal movement, when the snake moves forward, the body shifts, so cells that were occupied remain occupied except the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically, (1,6) will be vacated only if the segment that is there moves and is not replaced, which only happens if that segment is the tail, but here (1,6) is segment 3, not tail, so when it moves, the next segment moves in.\n> \n> The only way to vacate (1,6) is to have the snake move in a way that the body part at (1,6) is left behind, meaning that it becomes the tail or something, but since the snake grows only when it eats, and it's not eating now, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, since no eating, when snake moves, the tail leaves its position, and all other cells are still occupied by the shifted body.\n> \n> So for (1,6) to be vacated, it must be that the segment at (1,6) is the tail, so when it moves, the cell is empty.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,6), so (1,6) is not tail; it's in the middle, so it will always be occupied after any move unless the snake eats and grows, but even then, when it eats, it grows, so the new tail is added, but the positions shift.\n> \n> To vacate (1,6), we need the snake to move such that the segment currently at (1,6) moves to a different cell and no segment moves to (1,6), which only happens if (1,6) was the tail position, but it's not.\n> \n> The tail position is the only one that gets vacated when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> For example, if we move, the new tail position is where the second-to-last segment was, and the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> But for (1,6), since it's not the tail, it remains occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, after a move, the cells that were occupied except the old tail cell are still occupied, and the new head cell is occupied, but the old tail cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, to have (1,6) free, we need that at some point, the tail is at (1,6), so when we move, it gets vacated.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,6), so we need to move so that eventually the tail leaves (1,6), but (1,6) is not the tail now.\n> \n> The segment at (1,6) is index 3, and tail is index 23. When the snake moves, the position (1,6) will be occupied by index 4, then later by index 5, and so on, until the tail reaches there.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the body position at (1,6) will be occupied by different segments over time, but the cell itself is only vacated when the tail leaves it.\n> \n> So for (1,6) to be vacated, we need that the tail is currently at (1,6) or will be there after some moves.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,6), and the body is a path.\n> \n> To have the tail at (1,6), we need to move in a way that the tail approaches (1,6).\n> \n> But it might take many turns.\n> \n> Since the food has a life-span of 10 turns, from turn 92 to 101, we have time.\n> \n> But let's see if we can eat it sooner.\n> \n> Another way: if the snake moves in a circle or something, but it's complicated.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for the food to be eaten, two things must happen: first, the body must no longer be on that cell, meaning it must be vacated, and second, the head moves there.\n> \n> So we need to have (1,6) empty at some point, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> (1,6) will be empty only when the tail is at (1,6) and we move, so it gets vacated.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,6), which is adjacent to (1,6)? (3,6) and (1,6) are not adjacent; x differs by 2.\n> \n> We need to move the snake so that the tail moves to (1,6).\n> \n> The tail is at (3,6), and the body is connected.\n> \n> Let's see the path from tail to head.\n> \n> Tail: (3,6) index 23\n> \n> 22: (4,6)\n> \n> 21: (5,6)\n> \n> 20: (6,6)\n> \n> 19: (6,5)\n> \n> 18: (5,5)\n> \n> 17: (5,4)\n> \n> 16: (5,3)\n> \n> 15: (6,3)\n> \n> 14: (6,2)\n> \n> 13: (6,1)\n> \n> 12: (5,1)\n> \n> 11: (4,1)\n> \n> 10: (4,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,3)\n> \n> 8: (3,3)\n> \n> 7: (2,3)\n> \n> 6: (1,3)\n> \n> 5: (1,4)\n> \n> 4: (1,5)\n> \n> 3: (1,6)\n> \n> 2: (2,6)\n> \n> 1: (2,5)\n> \n> 0: (2,4) head\n> \n> To move the tail towards (1,6), we need to have the snake move in a way that the tail position changes to be closer to (1,6).\n> \n> But the tail moves only when the head moves, and the tail follows the path.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, it will take many moves for the tail to reach (1,6).\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (1,6) is index 3.

Let me confirm the grid size.\n> \n> The border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7) exist, but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Similarly, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake has 24 segments. Head is at (3,4), and the direction is R (right). So moving right means increasing x.\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Life span decreases each turn, including this one, so it will disappear after 9 turns from now? Life span is given as 9, and it decreases every turn, including current, so after 9 more turns, it will be gone. But since we're on turn 93, it will disappear on turn 102 if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The goal is to eat positive food and avoid negative food, but here there's only one food, and it's positive with value +1.\n> \n> The food is at (1,6). Looking at the snake positions: snake is at [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Food is at (1,6), but (1,6) is occupied by the snake! Let's see: positions include (1,6), which is the fifth segment in the list? Indices: head is index 0: (3,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — yes, (1,6) is part of the snake's body. Specifically, it's the fourth segment after the head? Head is (3,4), then body: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), then (1,6), which is the tail or something?\n> \n> List of positions:\n> \n> 0: (3,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,4)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (2,6)\n> \n> 4: (1,6)  <-- food is here, but it's occupied by snake body\n> \n> 5: (1,5)\n> \n> 6: (1,4)\n> \n> 7: (1,3)\n> \n> 8: (2,3)\n> \n> 9: (3,3)\n> \n> 10: (4,3)\n> \n> 11: (4,2)\n> \n> 12: (4,1)\n> \n> 13: (5,1)\n> \n> 14: (6,1)\n> \n> 15: (6,2)\n> \n> 16: (6,3)\n> \n> 17: (5,3)\n> \n> 18: (5,4)\n> \n> 19: (5,5)\n> \n> 20: (6,5)\n> \n> 21: (6,6)\n> \n> 22: (5,6)\n> \n> 23: (4,6)  <-- tail\n> \n> So (1,6) is position 4, which is a body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, food is at (1,6), which is currently occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if:\n> \n> 1. The body moves away, and\n> \n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n> \n> So, since the food is under the body at (1,6), to eat it, we need that segment to move away first, and then the head to move to (1,6).\n> \n> But currently, the head is at (3,4), moving right. Direction is R, so from (3,4), moving right would go to (4,4).\n> \n> But (4,4) might be occupied or not? Let's see the positions: (4,4) is not listed. Positions are: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), etc. No (4,4), so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) or other directions.\n> \n> First, I need to decide the action for turn 93.\n> \n> Current head at (3,4), direction R, so possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L would be opposite, and no instant reverse. So cannot move left to (2,4), which is the body.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,4), but (2,4) is the first body segment, and since it's adjacent, moving there would cause collision? But according to movement constraints, I can move to a cell occupied by the tail only if the tail moves, but here (2,4) is not the tail; it's the segment right after head.\n> \n> Deadly collisions: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves.\n> \n> But (2,4) is not the tail; it's the neck, so moving left to (2,4) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,6), which is far.\n> \n> So from (3,4), moving:\n> \n> - U to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Positions: (2,5) at index 2, (1,5) at index 5, no (3,5), so free.\n> \n> - D to (3,3): (3,3) is at index 9? Index 9 is (3,3), which is body segment, so occupied. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - R to (4,4): not in positions, so free.\n> \n> - L to (2,4): (2,4) is index 1, body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders are walls, but (3,5) is y=5, x=3, which is within 1 to 6, I think. Playable area: since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable, I believe. But let's confirm.\n> \n> The grid has coordinates, and walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Not necessarily, because internal cells might be accessible, but borders are blocked.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (6,6) should be playable, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (5,2), which is a wall.\n> \n> So for (3,5): x=3, y=5, which is between 1 and 6, and not (5,2), so free.\n> \n> (3,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (4,4) free.\n> \n> (2,4) occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), R to (4,4). D and L are invalid.\n> \n> D to (3,3) is occupied, L to (2,4) occupied.\n> \n> So only U or R possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (1,6). It has life span 9, so it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 102, it's gone. Current turn 93, so 9 turns from now including this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so after 9 turns, it will be 0 and disappear.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it will be present for L more turns, disappearing at turn t + L.\n> \n> Here t=93, L=9, so food will be at (1,6) until turn 101, and disappear at turn 102? Let's see: on turn 93, life span 9, after turn 93, it decreases to 8, and so on, so after 9 decreases, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it is present from turn 93 to turn 101 (since on turn 93, L=9; turn 94, L=8; ... turn 101, L=1; turn 102, L=0, disappeared). So we have until turn 101 to eat it.\n> \n> But it's under the snake body at (1,6), which is position index 4.\n> \n> To eat it, we need the snake to move so that the body moves away from (1,6), and then head moves to (1,6).\n> \n> Currently, the snake is moving, and each turn, the head moves, and tail moves, so the body shifts.\n> \n> Let's see the current path: head at (3,4), moving right.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,4), then the new head is (4,4), and the tail moves away from (4,6) to the next, but the tail is at (4,6), which was position 23. When head moves to new position, the tail is removed, so the segment at (4,6) is no longer there, and a new segment is added at the head position, but since we didn't eat, length remains, so tail moves forward.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the snake effectively moves forward one cell.\n> \n> With eating, head moves to food, tail not removed, length increases.\n> \n> But here, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So for the food at (1,6) to be accessible, the snake body must leave that cell.\n> \n> Currently, at (1,6), it's occupied by segment index 4.\n> \n> As the snake moves, this segment will move based on the path.\n> \n> The snake positions are a list, and when head moves, a new head is added, and the last segment (tail) is removed if not eating.\n> \n> So to free up (1,6), we need that the segment currently there moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the body segments follow the path.\n> \n> Let's trace the snake body. From the positions, it's a bit messy, but we can see the path.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), then to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), then to (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6).\n> \n> So the snake has a long body.\n> \n> Now, the segment at (1,6) will move when the snake moves, but it depends on the head movement.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves up or right, the body will shift, and the segment at (1,6) might move to where the next segment is.\n> \n> But let's think carefully.\n> \n> The snake body is fixed relative to head movement except when turning.\n> \n> Since the head is moving, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the next turn.\n> \n> In terms of the list, when head moves to a new position, it becomes new head, and the tail position is removed, so all segments shift towards the tail.\n> \n> For instance, if head moves to (4,4) from (3,4), then the new positions: head at (4,4), then body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), ... up to (5,6), and tail would be (4,6) but since tail is removed, the new tail is the one before, which is (5,6) or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list indices for clarity.\n> \n> 0: (3,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,4)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (2,6)\n> \n> 4: (1,6)\n> \n> 5: (1,5)\n> \n> 6: (1,4)\n> \n> 7: (1,3)\n> \n> 8: (2,3)\n> \n> 9: (3,3)\n> \n> 10: (4,3)\n> \n> 11: (4,2)\n> \n> 12: (4,1)\n> \n> 13: (5,1)\n> \n> 14: (6,1)\n> \n> 15: (6,2)\n> \n> 16: (6,3)\n> \n> 17: (5,3)\n> \n> 18: (5,4)\n> \n> 19: (5,5)\n> \n> 20: (6,5)\n> \n> 21: (6,6)\n> \n> 22: (5,6)\n> \n> 23: (4,6) tail\n> \n> If head moves right to (4,4), then new head at (4,4), and tail at (4,6) is removed, so the new positions are:\n> \n> New 0: (4,4) head\n> \n> New 1: (3,4)  // previous head\n> \n> New 2: (2,4)  // previous 1\n> \n> New 3: (2,5)  // previous 2\n> \n> New 4: (2,6)  // previous 3\n> \n> New 5: (1,6)  // previous 4\n> \n> New 6: (1,5)  // previous 5\n> \n> ... and so on, up to new 22: (5,6)  // previous 22?

As long as that segment is not the tail, when the snake moves, the segment will move to a different cell, but only if the snake turns or something.\n> \n> In a straight line, if the snake is moving straight, each body segment moves to where the previous segment was, so the cell is vacated only when the tail moves away.\n> \n> But for a body segment not at the end, when the snake moves, it occupies a new cell based on the movement direction.\n> \n> Specifically, for the cell (1,6), it is currently occupied by a segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to the cell where the next segment towards the head was, depending on the path.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (1,6) is P4. The previous segment in the path is P3 at (2,6), and the next is P5 at (1,5).\n> \n> When the head moves, the segment at P4 will move to the position that P3 was at, which is (2,6), if the head moves in a way that the path is followed.\n> \n> Since the snake is not necessarily moving in a straight line, but in this case, from the positions, the snake is turning.\n> \n> For example, from head at (3,4), to (2,4), to (2,5), etc., so it's not straight.\n> \n> But when we move the head, the body segments follow by moving to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for the cell (1,6), it is occupied by P4. After one move, if head moves to a new position, P4 will be at the new position list, but the cell (1,6) will be occupied by the segment that was at P5, because P5 moves to P4's position.\n> \n> Let's think.\n> \n> After move, new positions: the cell that was P4's position is now occupied by the segment that was at P5, because P5 moves to the position of P4 in the new list.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves forward without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous body segment.\n> \n> So the cell that was occupied by P_i is now occupied by P_{i+1} for i from 0 to 22, and P23's cell is vacated.\n> \n> For i from 0 to 22, the cell of P_i is now occupied by P_{i+1}, and P23's cell is empty.\n> \n> Specifically, for cell (1,6), it was occupied by P4. After one move, this cell will be occupied by P5, because P5 moves to P4's position.\n> \n> Similarly, after two moves, it will be occupied by P6, and so on, until P23 moves to it, and then when P23 moves away, it is vacated.\n> \n> P23 is the tail, so when the snake moves, P23's cell is vacated immediately.\n> \n> But for (1,6), it is currently occupied by P4, so after k moves, it will be occupied by P_{4+k}, until 4+k = 23, so when k=19, it is occupied by P23, and on the next move, when snake moves, P23's cell is vacated, so (1,6) will be empty after 20 moves.\n> \n> After 19 moves, P23 is at (1,6), and on the 20th move, when head moves, P23 is removed, so (1,6) is vacated.\n> \n> But after 19 moves, the position of P23 might be different if the snake turns.\n> \n> But in general, it takes time for the body to move away from that cell.\n> \n> For (1,6) to be free, we need to make enough moves so that the segment that is there now has moved away, which will happen after approximately 19 moves, but since the snake can turn, the cell might be vacated earlier if the body turns away from it.\n> \n> For example, if the snake turns in a way that the segment at (1,6) moves to a different direction.\n> \n> But from the current path, it might be stuck for a while.\n> \n> Perhaps we can move the snake in a way that we can reach (1,6) sooner.\n> \n> But the food has life span 9, so we have only 9 turns to eat it, but it takes about 19 moves to free the cell, which is more than 9, so by the time the cell is free, the food might be gone.\n> \n> Life span 9, so after 9 turns, it disappears, so we have only 9 turns to eat it.\n> \n> But it takes at least 19 moves to vacate the cell if we don't eat, which is too long, so we need to eat sooner or in a different way.\n> \n> Another possibility: if we can make the snake move so that the body leaves (1,6) faster by turning.\n> \n> For example, if we can have the head move in a way that the segment at (1,6) is forced to move to a different cell.\n> \n> But from the current positions, the segment at (1,6) is connected to (2,6) and (1,5).\n> \n> If the head moves and the body follows, P4 will move to where P3 is, which is (2,6), if no turn, but we can turn the head.\n> \n> Let's see the current direction: head at (3,4), direction R, so moving right.\n> \n> If I move up to (3,5), then the new head is (3,5), and the body shifts: new P0: (3,5), P1: (3,4), P2: (2,4), P3: (2,5), P4: (2,6), P5: (1,6), etc.\n> \n> So (1,6) is now at P5, still occupied.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,4), as before, (1,6) at P5.\n> \n> No change.\n> \n> Now, to free (1,6), we need that the segment that was at P5 moves to (1,6), but P5 is at (1,5), which is adjacent.\n> \n> If we move in a way that the head turns, but it's the body segments that move.\n> \n> Perhaps if we move the head so that the body at (1,6) is no longer supported, but it will move to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if we could make the snake move down or something, but from (3,4), we can only move U or R.\n> \n> After moving, we can change direction.\n> \n> But let's think about the food rule: it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for the body to move away, we need that the segment currently on (1,6) leaves that cell.\n> \n> That happens when the snake moves and that segment moves to a different cell.\n> \n> In the next move, when the snake moves, P4 will move to where P3 is, which is (2,6), so (1,6) will be occupied by P5, which is at (1,5) currently, so (1,5) moves to (1,6).\n> \n> So after any move, (1,6) will still be occupied, by the next segment.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move, P5 moves to (1,6).\n> \n> After two moves, P6 moves to (1,6), and so on.\n> \n> P5 is at (1,5), P6 at (1,4), etc.\n> \n> So the cell (1,6) will be occupied by successive body segments until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6), which is far, so it will take many turns for the tail to reach (1,6).\n> \n> The distance from P5 to tail: P5 to P23, 18 segments, so it will take 18 moves for P5 to become the tail, and then on the 19th move, (1,6) is vacated when the tail moves away.\n> \n> But life span is only 9 turns, so we can't wait that long.\n> \n> Therefore, it seems impossible to eat this food because the body is blocking it for too long, and the food will disappear before we can free the cell.\n> \n> But the rules say \"food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, the body is not moving away soon enough.\n> \n> Perhaps if we can make the snake turn in a way that the body at (1,6) moves to a different direction immediately.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a direction that causes the segment at (1,6) to not move to (2,6) but to something else.\n> \n> But from the current path, the segment at (1,6) must move to (2,6) when the snake moves, because that's the previous position.\n> \n> Unless the head turns sharply, but the body segments only move to the position of the previous segment, so it's deterministic based on the current positions.\n> \n> For instance, no matter how the head moves, when the snake moves, P4 will always move to P3's position, which is (2,6), and P5 will move to P4's position, which is (1,6), so (1,6) remains occupied by P5.\n> \n> Similarly, after any move, (1,6) is occupied by the next segment in line.\n> \n> So it will be occupied until the tail segment leaves it, which takes about 20 turns, as calculated.\n> \n> Since life span is 9, it's impossible to eat this food.\n> \n> Therefore, I should ignore this food and focus on survival or other opportunities, but there are no other foods listed; only one food is given.\n> \n> Food positions: only (1,6,9,1) is listed, so no other food.\n> \n> So I need to survive and maybe the food will disappear, and new food might spawn, but the state doesn't mention other food, so for now, only this one, but it's not eatable.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move to areas where food might spawn, but I don't know the spawning rules; it's not specified.\n> \n> The AI should assume that food spawns randomly, but for this decision, since no other food is given, I need to avoid dying and wait for opportunities.\n> \n> But the snake is long, 24 segments, so the grid is small, 6x6 playable area minus obstacles.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So total cells: 6x6=36, minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies 24 cells, so only 11 free cells.\n> \n> Food is at (1,6), occupied, so not free.\n> \n> Free cells are the ones not occupied by snake or walls.\n> \n> Walls are borders and (5,2), so cells like (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), etc.\n> \n> From possible moves, from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n> \n> (3,5) is free, (4,4) is free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk of Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement, so I can't go to those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow. The direction is right (R), so the snake is moving to the right. The positions are: [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. Let me list these out to visualize.\n> \n> Head: (4,4)\n> \n> Then: (3,4), (2,4) — so moving left initially? From (4,4) to (3,4) is left, then to (2,4) still left. Then (2,5) up? (2,4) to (2,5) is up. Then (2,6) up again. Then (1,6) left. Then (1,5) down. Then (1,4) down. Then (1,3) down. Then (2,3) right. Then (3,3) right. Then (4,3) right. Then (4,2) down. Then (4,1) down. Then (5,1) right. Then (6,1) right. Then (6,2) up. Then (6,3) up. Then (5,3) left? (6,3) to (5,3) is left. Then (5,4) up. Then (5,5) up. Then (6,5) right. Then (6,6) up. Then (5,6) left. Tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: (1,6) disappears after 8 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone by turn 102 if not eaten. Similarly, (1,1) disappears after 10 turns, by turn 104.\n> \n> Current turn is 94, so for (1,6), life span 8 means it disappears on turn 94 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify life span countdown.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it is present from turn t to t + L - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, countdown is L, then at turn t+1, it's L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, it's 1, then gone at turn t + L. So it can be eaten on turns t to t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 8 at turn 94, so countdown 8, can be eaten from turn 94 to 101, gone at turn 102.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): life span 10, can be eaten from turn 94 to 103, gone at 104.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,4), direction R, so moving right. From the positions, after (4,4), it was at (3,4) before, so since it's moving right, from (3,4) to (4,4) is right, so current direction is right.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot go L (left) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so I cannot move left on this turn; opposite direction is not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to understand where I can move.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8, walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls block, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns x=0 and x=7 are all walls? \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" – it says \"x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly, internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> So playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, but (1,1) might be valid? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's see: border cells are walls, so for example, (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. So the grid has walls on the borders, meaning the inner grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. But (1,1) is mentioned as a food position, so (1,1) is not a wall; similarly, (1,6) is food.\n> \n> \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" – this might mean that cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,1), (0,2), ..., (0,6), (7,1) to (7,6), and (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are walls.

Now, is it occupied by snake? Look at positions: snake has (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n> \n> So (4,5) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - Down: (4,3) – but (4,3) is in snake positions, it's a body segment. From the list: (4,3) is there, so occupied.\n> \n> - Left: (3,4) – also occupied, since (3,4) is the second segment.\n> \n> - Right: (5,4) – (5,4) is in positions, it's a body segment.\n> \n> Current head is (4,4), moving right, so next positions: from (4,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (4,5)\n> \n> - D: (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by snake body, so if I move down, head to (4,3), which is a body segment, collision.\n> \n> - L: (3,4) occupied, collision, and also not allowed because reverse direction?

But that can't be right; let me double-check.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), body segments include (3,4), (4,3), (5,4), etc., so adjacent cells are occupied except (4,5).\n> \n> (4,4) up is (4,5), down is (4,3) which is body, left is (3,4) body, right is (5,4) body. So yes, only (4,5) is free.\n> \n> But the snake is long, 24 segments? Let's count positions: 24 positions, so length 24.\n> \n> But moving up to (4,5) should be safe, since it's free.\n> \n> Then, after moving, the tail will move, so the cell that was tail might be free, but for now, from current state, only one move possible: Up.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,6) and (1,1).\n> \n> (1,6) is currently occupied by a body segment? Snake positions: (1,6) is the sixth segment, I think. Positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — so (1,6) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) with value 1, life span 8.\n> \n> But it says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

And food there.\n> \n> Now, back to movement: from (4,4), only possible move is Up to (4,5).\n> \n> Then, after that, the snake will have new head at (4,5), and the tail will move from (5,6) to... when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed, so if I move up, new positions: head (4,5), then previous head (4,4) becomes body, then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), and tail (5,6) is removed? When head moves to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), then the first body is the old head (4,4), then (3,4), and so on, up to the second last is (6,6), and the tail (5,6) is removed, so it's no longer part of the snake. The tail was (5,6), after move, the segment that was at (5,6) is gone, and the new tail is whatever was second last, which is (6,6) or something.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (4,3), 12: (4,2), 13: (4,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (6,1), 16: (6,2), 17: (6,3), 18: (5,3), 19: (5,4), 20: (5,5), 21: (6,5), 22: (6,6), 23: tail (5,6)\n> \n> After moving up to (4,5), new head is (4,5), then the body: segment 0 becomes body at (4,4), segment 1 at (3,4), ..., up to segment 22 at (6,6), and segment 23 (5,6) is removed. So new positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) — so tail is now at (6,6).\n> \n> Length is still 24, since no food eaten.\n> \n> Direction: after moving up, new head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns ahead to maximize score, avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food available: (1,6) with life span 8, but it's under the body at (1,6). After the move, in new positions, (1,6) is still occupied? In the new positions above, (1,6) is still there, segment index 5 or something. In new list, positions: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), etc., so (1,6) is occupied.\n> \n> The body will move away eventually as the snake moves.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) food is free, but I need to go there.\n> \n> Also, there might be a danger with tail.\n> \n> First, from current turn, I must move up, since it's the only option.\n> \n> Then, from there, I can plan.\n> \n> But let's confirm if there are other moves. Is (4,5) safe? Yes.\n> \n> What about other cells?

After move to (4,5), snake positions include (6,6) tail, and (5,6) is not in positions, so (5,6) is free? Let's see.\n> \n> After move to (4,5), positions are: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n> \n> So cells not occupied: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) — (5,6) is not in list, yes.

It's turn 97. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (3,6), with direction Up. The body segments are listed: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]. That's 24 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 5\n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 7\n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (3,6) facing Up. From the positions, the snake is coiled around, and (1,6) is actually occupied by the snake's body. Let's see: positions include (1,6), which is the 9th segment? List indices: index 0 is head (3,6), index 1 is (3,5), ..., index 8 is (1,6)? Let's count:\n> \n> 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (4,5)\n> \n> 3: (4,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (2,4)\n> \n> 6: (2,5)\n> \n> 7: (2,6)\n> \n> 8: (1,6)  <-- this is the position where food is at (1,6)\n> \n> 9: (1,5)\n> \n> 10: (1,4)\n> \n> 11: (1,3)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So food at (1,6) is currently under the snake's body, specifically at segment index 8.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is also under the body? Let's see: (5,3) is position index 21? Positions: 20: (6,3), 21: (5,3), 22: (5,4), 23: (5,5). So (5,3) is segment 21, which is part of the body.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) doesn't seem to be occupied by snake; let's check positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), etc., no (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n> \n> But (1,1) might be a wall or something? Walls are borders and (5,2). Borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (1,1) is within bounds, x=1,y=1, which should be playable unless obstacle. Internal obstacle is only (5,2), so (1,1) should be empty.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (1,6) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns including current, so by turn 102 it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (1,1) life span 7, until turn 104, and (5,3) life span 10, until turn 107.\n> \n> Current turn is 97.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current head position (3,6) with direction Up.\n> \n> Since direction is Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right? But no instant reverse, so I cannot move Down (opposite of Up).\n> \n> So possible moves: Up (to (3,7)? But y=7 is a wall, since borders y=0 and y=7 are walls. y=7 is the top border, so (3,7) is out of bounds, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Left: to (2,6)\n> \n> Right: to (4,6)\n> \n> Down is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> But (2,6) and (4,6) are possible.\n> \n> Now, check what's at these cells.\n> \n> First, (2,6): from snake positions, (2,6) is segment index 7? Positions: 7: (2,6), which is a body segment. But when we move, the tail will move, so moving to a cell that is currently occupied by tail might be okay if the tail moves away.\n> \n> General rule: head can move to a cell that will be free after the move. Since the tail moves forward, the cell that was tail might become free, but only if it's the tail segment.\n> \n> The tail segment is the last one, which is (5,5) in this case, index 23.\n> \n> (2,6) is index 7, not the tail. So it's a body segment, and moving there would cause collision because after move, head is at (2,6), but that cell is still occupied by the segment that was there, unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The tail segment (last one) leaves its position, so that cell becomes empty.\n> \n> Therefore, for a cell to be safe to move into:\n> \n> - It must not be a wall.\n> \n> - It must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail segment, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to a cell that is the current tail position is safe because after move, tail moves, so head is there and tail is gone.\n> \n> But if moving to a cell that is a body segment but not tail, then after move, that segment might still be there or something. Let's see.\n> \n> Suppose head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment. After the move:\n> \n> - The head is now at that cell.\n> \n> - The body segment that was there moves to the next position, so the cell is now occupied by head, and the segment that was there moves to where the next one was, so the cell is not free; it's now head.\n> \n> But collision happens if head moves into a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, because for tail, it moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by the tail, it's okay because tail moves, so no collision. But if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not tail, then after move, that body segment is still there (it moved to the position), so head collides with body.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> Positions: head, segment1, segment2, tail.\n> \n> If head moves to segment1 position: after move, new head is at old segment1 position, segment1 moves to old segment2 position, segment2 moves to old tail position, tail moves away. But the cell now has head, and segment1 is at a different cell, so no immediate collision? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions after move.\n> \n> Before move: cells occupied: H, S1, S2, T\n> \n> If head moves to where S1 is: new head at S1_old, then S1 moves to S2_old, S2 moves to T_old, T moves to new position. But S1_old is now head, and S1 is at S2_old, etc. The cell S1_old now has head, and since S1 moved away, it's fine, but S1 was a body segment, but now it's not there anymore.\n> \n> Collision only if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move.\n> \n> After move, the head is at the new position, and the body segments are at the previous positions except the tail which is removed if no growth.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for movement without eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> In terms of collision:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell that is currently empty, no issue.\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and no food eaten, then after move, tail moves, so head is there and tail gone, no collision.\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment (not tail), then after move, that body segment will be at a different position, so the cell is now head, and the body segment moved, so no collision with that cell. Collision only if head moves into a wall or into a body segment that doesn't move away, but all body segments move except when growing.\n> \n> Actually, in snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is not food, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty. If the head moves to a cell that was a body segment, since all segments shift, the cell that was occupied by a body segment might now be occupied by the next segment or something.\n> \n> Let's take a small example.\n> \n> Suppose snake: head at (1,1), body at (1,2), tail at (1,3). Direction down or something.\n> \n> If head moves left to (0,1), but assume within bounds.\n> \n> But to avoid confusion, in this game, collision occurs if after the move, the head is in the same cell as any body segment or wall.\n> \n> So, after moving:\n> \n> - New head position\n> \n> - New body positions: each body segment takes the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - Tail position is removed if no growth\n> \n> So the new set of positions.\n> \n> For head to not collide, new head position must not be in the new body positions, and not wall.\n> \n> Also, for the tail: if head moves to current tail position, after move, tail moves, so new head is at old tail position, and old tail position is not in new body positions, so it's safe.\n> \n> If head moves to a current body position that is not tail, say segment k, after move, that segment k moves to segment k+1 position, so the new position of segment k is the old position of segment k+1, which is different from the new head position (which is old position of segment k), so new head and new segment k are at different cells, no collision.\n> \n> However, if the head moves to a position that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, that would cause collision, but since the body segments move to the positions of the previous segments, the only way that happens is if the head moves to the position where a body segment is moving to, which is only the case for the tail if no growth, but tail moves away.\n> \n> I think I'm overcomplicating.\n> \n> Standard rule: you can move to any adjacent cell that is not a wall and not occupied by any part of the snake except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> If you move to a cell that is the tail, it's safe because tail moves.\n> \n> If you move to a cell that is a body segment, it is not safe because that segment will still be there after the move, but when you move, the body segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by a body segment is now occupied by the head or by the next segment? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions before move: H, S1, S2, ..., Sk, T\n> \n> After move, if head moves to new cell P:\n> \n> - If P is not food, new positions: P (new head), H (new S1), S1 (new S2), ..., Sk (new body), and T is removed, so Sk was the second last, now last.\n> \n> The new body segments are at the old positions of H, S1, S2, ..., Sk-1.\n> \n> The cell that was T is now empty.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell that was, say, S1 position.\n> \n> Before move: cell S1_pos occupied by S1.\n> \n> After move: new head at old S1_pos.\n> \n> New S1 at old S2_pos.\n> \n> New S2 at old S3_pos, etc.\n> \n> Old T removed.\n> \n> So new head is at old S1_pos, which is not occupied by any new body segment because new body segments are at old H, old S1, old S2, ..., old Sk-1 positions. Old S1_pos is not in new body positions; it's the new head.\n> \n> New body positions are old positions of H, S1, S2, ..., up to second last.\n> \n> For example, if snake has 3 segments: H, S1, T.\n> \n> Before: cells: H, S1, T\n> \n> Head moves to P.\n> \n> If P is S1, then after move: new head at old S1, new S1 at old T, T removed. New positions: old S1 (head), old T (S1), and old T cell is now S1, no tail. So cells occupied: old S1 and old T, with head at old S1 and body at old T. No collision.\n> \n> If P is T, then new head at old T, new S1 at old H, T removed. Cells: old T (head), old H (S1).\n> \n> No collision.\n> \n> If P is a wall or a body segment that isn't tail, but when you move to a body segment position, it's okay as above.\n> \n> Collision only if after move, head is at same position as a body segment or wall.\n> \n> That can happen if:\n> \n> - Head moves to a wall.\n> \n> - Head moves to a body segment that does not move away, but all body segments move to new positions, so the only cell that might cause issue is if the head moves to a position that is not the tail and is occupied, but after move, it's not occupied by body anymore.\n> \n> The exception is when the snake eats food and grows. Then, when head moves to food, it grows, so tail does not move, and new head is at food position, new body segments include the old tail position.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that is currently the tail and it has food, then after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new head and new tail are at same position, collision.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, moving to tail is safe.\n> \n> Moving to a body segment that is not tail: after move, that cell is now head, and the body segment has moved, so no collision.\n> \n> In this game, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But for movement, generally, moving to a cell occupied by a body segment is only dangerous if it's not the tail, but from above, it seems moving to body segment is safe as long as it's not a wall.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Let me read the rules again.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, for food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But for movement, from the collision rule, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> Moving to other body cells is not safe; it causes collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> Let's see the rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, it implies that moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment causes collision because head touches that segment.\n> \n> Whereas moving to tail cell is okay because tail moves.\n> \n> In the case of moving to a body segment cell, after the move, the head is at that cell, but that body segment has moved to the next position, so the head is not touching it at that cell, but the collision is checked after the move for the new positions.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that before moving, if the target cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's invalid or causes collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" after the move? Or during?\n> \n> The movement constraint is about choosing a direction, and collision happens if after moving, head is in a cell with body or wall.\n> \n> After moving, the new head position must not be the same as any of the new body positions or wall.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a cell that was a body segment, after move, that body segment is at a different cell, so new head and new body positions are different.\n> \n> Only if the head moves to a position that is still occupied after the move.\n> \n> But in standard snake, when you move, the only cell that might be problematic is if the head moves to a position that the tail was in, but tail moves, so it's empty, or if it moves to a body position, the body moves.\n> \n> The exception is when the snake is short, but for long snake, it should be fine.\n> \n> I think for this game, from the rule, moving to a cell occupied by the tail is safe, but moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment causes collision because the head is moving into it before the body moves or something. The rule is a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> This suggests that for non-tail body segments, moving into them causes head to touch body segment immediately, causing collision, whereas for tail, it's okay because tail moves.\n> \n> Similarly, in the food under body rule, the body must move away first, then head can move onto it.\n> \n> So for safety, I should consider that moving to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Moving to tail cell is safe only if no food or if food but not eaten in a way that causes collision, but the tail reward danger is specific.\n> \n> For now, in this state, let's list possible moves from (3,6) with direction Up.\n> \n> Possible directions: U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n> \n> Move U: to (3,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Move L: to (2,6)\n> \n> Move R: to (4,6)\n> \n> Now, (2,6): what is there? From positions, (2,6) is segment index 7, which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,5). So moving to (2,6) would cause body collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): is it occupied? Positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), etc. (4,6) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> List all positions: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> So (4,6) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is x=4,y=6, which is within 1 to 6, and no internal wall there, so it's valid.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is occupied by body.\n> \n> (3,7) is wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (4,6).\n> \n> Is that right? What about Down?

Possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 7) → y=7 is a wall → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 5) → Occupied by the snake's body (segment at index 3) → **Invalid (collision)**\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 6) → Occupied by the snake's body (segment at index 1) and is the opposite direction → **Invalid (reverse and collision)**\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 6) → Not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by the snake → **Valid**\n\n**Conclusion**: The only possible move at Turn 98 is **Right (R)** to (5, 6).\n\n### Simulating the Move to (5, 6)\n\nAfter moving right to (5, 6):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 6)\n- **New Body Positions**: The head moves to (5, 6), and each body segment shifts to the next position in the list. The tail at (5, 4) is removed since no food is eaten.\n- **New Direction**: Right (R), as the move was to the right.\n\n**Food Update**:\n- All food countdowns decrease by 1.\n  - (1, 6): Life Span = 3\n  - (1, 1): Life Span = 5\n  - (5, 3): Life Span = 8\n\n### Next Moves Planning\n\nNow, let's plan the next moves to maximize score while ensuring survival.\n\n#### Turn 99: From (5, 6), Direction R\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 7) → y=7 is a wall → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 5) → Check if occupied:\n  - Current body segments after Turn 98 move: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), ..., (5,3)]\n  - (5,5) is not in the body list → **Valid**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 6) → Occupied by the body (segment after head) and is the opposite direction → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 6) → Not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Options**: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\n**Choosing D to (5,5)**:\nThis move allows us to potentially reach the food at (5,3) in subsequent moves.\n\n#### Turn 100: From (5, 5), Direction D\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 6) → Occupied by the body (previous head) and is reverse direction → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 4) → Check if occupied:\n  - Current body after Turn 99 move: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,3)]\n  - (5,4) is not in the body → **Valid**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 5) → Occupied by the body → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 5) → Not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Options**: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\n**Choosing D to (5,4)**:\nThis moves us closer to the food at (5,3).\n\n#### Turn 101: From (5, 4), Direction D\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 5) → Occupied by the body and is reverse → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 3) → Check if occupied:\n  - Current body after Turn 100 move: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), ..., (6,2)]\n  - (5,3) is not in the body and has food → **Valid (eat food)**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 4) → Occupied by the body → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 4) → Not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Choosing D to (5,3)** to eat the food.\n\n#### After Eating at (5,3):\n\n- **Score Increases by 1**.\n- **Snake Length Increases by 1**: The tail is not removed this turn.\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 3)\n- **New Body Positions**: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), ..., (6,2), (6,3)] (tail was at (6,2), now new tail is (6,3) after growth)\n- **Direction**: Down (D)\n\n#### Turn 102: From (5, 3), Direction D\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 4) → Occupied by the body and is reverse → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2) → Obstacle at (5,2) → **Invalid**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3) → Occupied by the body → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3) → Not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Only Possible Move**: R to (6,3).\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above analysis, the immediate action at Turn 98 is to move Right (R), as it's the only valid move that avoids collisions and walls.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 98. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,6), and direction is R (right). The snake body is a list of positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. Let me list these out to visualize.\n> \n> Head: (4,6)\n> \n> Then: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> The tail is (5,4). Snake length is 24 segments? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 23, so 24 cells. Yes.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone by turn 98+4=102? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 98, life span is 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the turn when it's spawned, life_span starts at N, and decreases by 1 each turn. When it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N turns, so it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life_span is N, after turn t, it becomes N-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (1,6): life_span=4 at turn 98. So:\n> \n> - Turn 98: life_span=4\n> \n> - Turn 99: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 100: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 101: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 102: life_span=0, disappears after turn 102 or at start of turn 103? I think it disappears at the end of the turn when life_span becomes 0, or before the next turn.\n> \n> To be safe, I'll assume that when life_span is L at turn t, it can be eaten during turn t if head moves there, and after that, life_span decreases for the next state.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when it's available.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (1,1): life_span=6 at turn 98, so lasts until turn 98+6-1=103? Let's define.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span L means it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n> \n> After turn t+L-1, it disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> For (1,6): L=4, available on turns 98,99,100,101.\n> \n> For (1,1): L=6, available on turns 98 to 103.\n> \n> For (5,3): L=9, available on turns 98 to 106.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,6), direction R (right). So from (4,6), moving right would go to (5,6).\n> \n> Available moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse? Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on next turn. But I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So for turn t=98, current direction is R, so I cannot move L to (3,6), which is left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,5) – is this occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and obstacle (5,2)\n> \n> So from (4,6):\n> \n> - U: (4,7) – y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – but (4,5) is part of snake body? Positions: (4,5) is the fourth segment, yes, occupied by body. So moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) – what is this? x=5,y=6. Is it wall? Walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,6) should be free? But let's check if occupied by snake or obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: no (5,6), obstacle is (5,2), so (5,6) should be empty.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) – but (3,6) is the second segment, occupied, and also, since current direction is R, moving L is reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: only R to (5,6)? U is wall, D is body, L is reverse and body.\n> \n> D to (4,5) is body, so collision.\n> \n> But R to (5,6) seems free.\n> \n> Confirm: grid cells.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (5,6): x=5 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle only (5,2), so (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> Snake: positions list, no (5,6), so yes, free.\n> \n> But is (5,6) within bounds? x=5, y=6, both between 1 and 6? x=0 to 7, but 0 and 7 are walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Walls: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (5,2)\n> \n> So for (5,6): x=5 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7? y=6 is not 0 or 7, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall. Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=5 not wall.\n> \n> And (5,6) not in snake positions, not obstacle, so yes, (5,6) is free.\n> \n> Now, only possible move is R to (5,6)? But U and D are invalid, L invalid, so only R.\n> \n> But let me double-check.\n> \n> U: (4,7) – y=7, which is wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> D: (4,5) – in snake positions: (4,5) is the fourth element, index 3, which is body, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Moving to body cell causes collision, deadly.\n> \n> L: (3,6) – also body, and reverse direction.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is R to (5,6).\n> \n> But the snake has to move, so I must choose R for turn 98.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so even though this move is forced, I need to plan the sequence.\n> \n> So for turn 98, action must be R.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (5,6), what is the new state?\n> \n> Snake head moves to (5,6), and since no food eaten (no food at (5,6)), the tail moves away, so the body shifts. New positions: head (5,6), then the previous head becomes second segment, so the body is [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), ..., up to the tail, but since no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (5,6), then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n> \n> After move R to (5,6), no food, so new head (5,6), then the first body segment is (4,6), then (3,6), and so on, up to (5,4) is the tail, which is removed. So the new tail will be the previous second last, but let's list the new positions.\n> \n> The snake body minus the tail, with new head.\n> \n> New positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ]\n> \n> Because (5,4) was tail, removed. And (5,3) is now the last segment.\n> \n> Length decreases? No, when no food eaten, length remains the same, but tail moves, so one segment is removed from tail.\n> \n> Original 24 segments, after move, head new, tail removed, so 23 segments? But snake length should be constant unless eating.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> Snake has a fixed length unless it eats food. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated. The body segments shift: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for positions: let S be the list [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] where P0 is head.\n> \n> After moving to new position P_new, if no food, new positions: [P_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}], so the last position Pk is removed.\n> \n> Thus length decreases by 1? No, length should stay the same unless eating.\n> \n> Mistake.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment to the next position, and tail is left, so the snake length remains the same, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> Positions: old positions: head P0, then P1, P2, ..., P_{k} tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell C: if no food, new head is C, new body: P0 becomes segment 1, P1 becomes segment 2, ..., P_{k-1} becomes new tail, and Pk is vacated.\n> \n> So the new positions are [C, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}], which has the same number of elements, so length same.\n> \n> For example, here k=23 segments?

Walls are (5,2) internal, and borders. (4,2) should be free? Snake has (4,2) as a segment? Positions: ... (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), etc. (4,2) is occupied by snake, and it's not a wall.

D: (5,4), is it free? Snake positions: no (5,4), so free. L: (4,5), which is body? Positions: after moving to (5,5), body is (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), etc. (4,5) is a body segment, not tail.

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head position. Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list, but only if no food is eaten. If food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, since no food eaten yet, when head moves, tail is removed.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves from (5,6) to (5,5), then:\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then segment that was at index 1 (4,6) moves to the previous head position (5,6)?

I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> I recall that in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not advance, so the length increases by one. The new segment is effectively added at the tail, but since tail doesn't move, it stays, and the new tail is the previous tail.\n> \n> Positions: the new head is at F, then the previous head position, then previous body positions in order, down to the previous tail position, and since tail didn't move, the previous tail position is now part of the body, and the new tail is the segment that was before the tail, but in a list, it's the same positions except the head is new, and the tail is the same as before.\n> \n> Let's take a small example.\n> \n> Suppose snake: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3)\n> \n> Move to (1,0) with food.\n> \n> New head (1,0), then body (1,1), (1,2), and tail (1,3)?

After eating, I moved right to (6,3) and then up to (6,4) to avoid potential collisions and position the snake in a more open area for long-term survival, as the other food items were either unreachable or would expire before they could be eaten safely.\n",
