However, moving towards the highest-value food (`(3, 4)` with value 8) is a reasonable choice, even though it cannot be eaten this turn. This is because:\n- Moving `L` to `(3, 5)` brings the snake closer to `(3, 4)`, which might be useful if food respawns in the future (though the problem does not specify respawning).\n- This move is safe and does not restrict future movement options.\n\n### Action for Turn 3\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game at Turn 22:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (i.e., the outermost rows and columns are walls).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,2) is also a wall.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)].\n     - Head: (1,1)\n     - Tail: (4,1)\n   - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (4,1): value = +1, life_span = 7 (will disappear after Turn 28).\n   - Food at (4,4): value = +1, life_span = 10 (will disappear after Turn 31).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 22\n\nFrom the head position (1,1), let's examine possible moves based on the current direction (D) and movement constraints:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1,2) \n  - Occupied by the snake's body (second segment). Moving here would cause a collision.\n- **Down (D)**: (1,0)\n  - y=0 is a wall. Invalid move.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,1)\n  - x=0 is a wall. Invalid move.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,1)\n  - Check if (2,1) is free:\n    - Not a wall (x=2 is not 0 or 7; y=1 is not 0 or 7; not (5,2)).\n    - Not occupied by the snake's body (snake segments are at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), etc., but not (2,1)).\n  - Valid move.\n\n**Current Direction Constraint**: The snake cannot reverse its direction instantly. Current direction is D, so the opposite is U, which is already invalid due to collision. Thus, no additional restriction beyond the invalid moves above.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 22**: The only valid move is **Right (R)** to (2,1).\n\n### Verifying the Move to (2,1)\n\nAfter moving to (2,1):\n\n- New head position: (2,1)\n- The previous head (1,1) becomes the first body segment.\n- The tail (4,1) moves away since no food is eaten (food at (4,1) is under the tail and cannot be eaten yet).\n- New snake positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n  - Tail is now at (3,1).\n- New head direction: Right (R), since we moved right.\n\n### Next Moves Planning\n\nLooking ahead to ensure we can eat the positive foods safely:\n\n1. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Currently under the tail at (4,1).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away first (which it does when the snake moves without eating).\n     - Then, the head can move to (4,1) to eat the food.\n   - Life_span: 7 at Turn 22 → disappears after Turn 28 (exists until Turn 28 inclusive).\n\n2. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Life_span: 10 at Turn 22 → disappears after Turn 31.\n   - More time available to reach it.\n\n**Proposed Sequence**:\n\n- **Turn 22**: Move R to (2,1) (only option).\n- **Turn 23**: From (2,1), possible moves:\n  - U: (2,2) - body segment (from previous positions), collision.\n  - D: (2,0) - wall.\n  - L: (1,1) - body segment, collision.\n  - R: (3,1) - tail. Moving into the tail is allowed if no food is eaten there (which is the case here).\n    - After moving to (3,1), tail moves away from (3,1), new tail is (3,2).\n- **Turn 24**: From (3,1), possible moves:\n  - U: (3,2) - tail (allowed).\n  - D: (3,0) - wall.\n  - L: (2,1) - body, collision.\n  - R: (4,1) - food is here now (tail moved away at Turn 23).\n    - Moving to (4,1) eats the food (+1 score), snake grows by 1 (tail doesn't move).\n- **Turn 25**: From (4,1), direction R, possible moves:\n  - U: (4,2) - free.\n  - D: (4,0) - wall.\n  - L: (3,1) - body, collision.\n  - R: (5,1) - free (not wall or body).\n    - Prefer moving U to start heading towards (4,4).\n- **Turn 26**: From (4,2), move U to (4,3).\n- **Turn 27**: From (4,3), move U to (4,4) to eat the second food.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- Eating (4,1) before it disappears (by Turn 28).\n- Then moving upwards to eat (4,4) before it disappears (by Turn 31).\n- Avoids collisions and follows movement rules.\n\n### Potential Risks and Mitigations\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: When eating food under the tail, ensure the head is not adjacent to the tail after growing to avoid collision. In our sequence, when eating at (4,1), the tail is at (3,1), and the head moves to (4,1), which is not adjacent (diagonally adjacent doesn't count as adjacent in this context; adjacent means same x or y with difference of 1).\n  \n- **Blocking Paths**: After eating (4,1), moving up the column to (4,4) is clear since the body segments are not blocking the path upwards from (4,1) to (4,4).\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 22\n\nGiven the analysis, the only valid and safe move at Turn 22 is to move **Right (R)** to (2,1). This sets up the sequence to safely consume both positive foods while avoiding collisions and adhering to movement constraints.\n\n### Action for Turn 22\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The earliest the snake can reach the food is turn 39 (6 moves), but the food will still be available until turn 40, so it is theoretically possible to eat it. However, given the current constraints, the snake cannot move directly toward the food without risking collision.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- The only safe move is **Right (R)** to (5, 5).\n- Moving right avoids collision and does not reverse the current direction.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nBased on the analysis, the immediate action for Turn 33 is to move right. The following sequence is planned to navigate safely and avoid collisions:\n\n1. **Turn 33**: Move **Right (R)** to (5, 5).\n2. **Turn 34**: From (5, 5), move **Up (U)** to (5, 6) to avoid boxing in.\n3. **Turn 35**: From (5, 6), move **Right (R)** to (6, 6) (only safe move).\n4. **Turn 36**: From (6, 6), move **Down (D)** to (6, 5).\n5. **Turn 37**: From (6, 5), move **Down (D)** to (6, 4).\n6. **Turn 38**: From (6, 4), move **Left (L)** to (5, 4).\n\nThis sequence prioritizes moving toward open areas to avoid collisions and prepare for potential future food opportunities.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Avoiding Risk**: Moving left (L) to (2,3) would eat the food immediately, but this grows the snake and risks trapping it in the crowded center. Moving up (U) to (3,4) enters the snake's own body loop, which is less flexible for future moves. Moving down (D) to (3,2) is the safest option as it moves toward open space and avoids immediate collisions.\n\n2. **Food Timing**: The food at (2,3) has a life span of 4 (available until turn 43), so we can delay eating it. Moving down first allows us to reposition the snake to eat it later (e.g., on turn 42 via the sequence D → L → U).\n\n3. **Future Flexibility**: Moving down opens paths to the lower part of the grid, where fewer body segments are present. This creates more options for future moves and avoids dead ends.\n\n4. **Tail Reward Danger**: Currently, the tail is at (3,4), and the head is adjacent at (3,3). However, there is no food on the tail cell, so moving to (3,4) is safe but less optimal than moving down. \n\nThus, **D** is the best immediate action to balance survival and future opportunities. The full sequence (D → L → U) will safely eat (2,3) on turn 42 while minimizing risk.",

Moving U→U eats it by **Turn 65**, securing +1 score before it disappears (by Turn 71).  \n2. **Path to (4,6):** After eating (1,5), the sequence U→R→R→R (Turns 66-69) efficiently reaches (4,6) to eat the second +1 food.  \n3. **Risk Avoidance:**  \n   - No collisions with walls/body.  \n   - Tail at (4,5) is not adjacent to (1,5) or (4,6) when eaten, avoiding \"Tail Reward Danger\".  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \n- **Turn 64-65:** U→U to eat (1,5).  \n- **Turn 66-69:** U→R→R→R to eat (4,6).  \n- Ensures both foods are consumed within their life spans while keeping the snake maneuverable.  \n\nThis choice maximizes score (+2 total) with minimal risk.",

Possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 7) → y=7 is a wall → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 5) → Occupied by the snake's body (segment at index 3) → **Invalid (collision)**\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 6) → Occupied by the snake's body (segment at index 1) and is the opposite direction → **Invalid (reverse and collision)**\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 6) → Not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by the snake → **Valid**\n\n**Conclusion**: The only possible move at Turn 98 is **Right (R)** to (5, 6).\n\n### Simulating the Move to (5, 6)\n\nAfter moving right to (5, 6):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 6)\n- **New Body Positions**: The head moves to (5, 6), and each body segment shifts to the next position in the list. The tail at (5, 4) is removed since no food is eaten.\n- **New Direction**: Right (R), as the move was to the right.\n\n**Food Update**:\n- All food countdowns decrease by 1.\n  - (1, 6): Life Span = 3\n  - (1, 1): Life Span = 5\n  - (5, 3): Life Span = 8\n\n### Next Moves Planning\n\nNow, let's plan the next moves to maximize score while ensuring survival.\n\n#### Turn 99: From (5, 6), Direction R\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 7) → y=7 is a wall → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 5) → Check if occupied:\n  - Current body segments after Turn 98 move: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), ..., (5,3)]\n  - (5,5) is not in the body list → **Valid**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 6) → Occupied by the body (segment after head) and is the opposite direction → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 6) → Not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Options**: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\n**Choosing D to (5,5)**:\nThis move allows us to potentially reach the food at (5,3) in subsequent moves.\n\n#### Turn 100: From (5, 5), Direction D\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 6) → Occupied by the body (previous head) and is reverse direction → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 4) → Check if occupied:\n  - Current body after Turn 99 move: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,3)]\n  - (5,4) is not in the body → **Valid**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 5) → Occupied by the body → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 5) → Not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Options**: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\n**Choosing D to (5,4)**:\nThis moves us closer to the food at (5,3).\n\n#### Turn 101: From (5, 4), Direction D\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 5) → Occupied by the body and is reverse → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 3) → Check if occupied:\n  - Current body after Turn 100 move: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), ..., (6,2)]\n  - (5,3) is not in the body and has food → **Valid (eat food)**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 4) → Occupied by the body → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 4) → Not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Choosing D to (5,3)** to eat the food.\n\n#### After Eating at (5,3):\n\n- **Score Increases by 1**.\n- **Snake Length Increases by 1**: The tail is not removed this turn.\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 3)\n- **New Body Positions**: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), ..., (6,2), (6,3)] (tail was at (6,2), now new tail is (6,3) after growth)\n- **Direction**: Down (D)\n\n#### Turn 102: From (5, 3), Direction D\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 4) → Occupied by the body and is reverse → **Invalid**\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2) → Obstacle at (5,2) → **Invalid**\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3) → Occupied by the body → **Invalid**\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3) → Not occupied → **Valid**\n\n**Only Possible Move**: R to (6,3).\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above analysis, the immediate action at Turn 98 is to move Right (R), as it's the only valid move that avoids collisions and walls.\n\n\\boxed{R}",
