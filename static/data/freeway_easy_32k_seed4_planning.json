We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction, and must stay within y in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at that turn) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway k such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from freeway y_T to freeway y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on freeway y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on freeway y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we only check the car on freeway y_T, and at turn T+1, we check freeway y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=0 (which is turn 0). For each freeway (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, we have:\n  (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nNote: \n  - For left-moving cars: the car moves to the left. The span at time t is [h - s*(t), tau - s*(t)]? \n    But note the representation: for left-moving, the initial span at t1 is [h, tau] and then at T>t1: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n    However, note that in the example for left-moving, the car is moving left so the entire car moves left.\n\n  - For right-moving: [tau, h] at t1 becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nBut wait: the representation for the car state at t1 is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret:\n\n  - For a right-moving car: the head is the front (which is the rightmost point) and tail is the rear? \n    Actually, the description says for right-moving: [tau, h] meaning from tail to head? But then the update: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n    Similarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, note that in the given data:\n\n  Freeway 1: \n      (48, 37, right, 4) -> at time 0: the car is from 37 to 48? But wait: the representation for right-moving is [tau, h]? \n      But the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then update.\n\n  Actually, the problem states:\n      Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n  So for the car (48, 37, right, 4) on freeway 1: \n      head = 48, tail = 37? But then the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [37,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [37+4*T, 48+4*T].\n\n  Similarly, the other car on freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 4) -> [ -11, 0 ] at t1, then at time T: [-11+4*T, 0+4*T].\n\n  Freeway 2: (48, 71, left, 24) -> for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, tau] = [48,71]? Then at time T: [48-24*T, 71-24*T].\n\nBut wait: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\". \n  However, note that if h=48 and tau=71, then the car is from 48 to 71? That would be a length of 23. Then moving left: both endpoints decrease.\n\nBut let me check the update: at T=0, the car is at [48,71]. Then at T=1, it becomes [48-24=24, 71-24=47]. So the car moves 24 units to the left per turn.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at a given turn T, if the player is at freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn T, the player's x=0 is inside the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 0 to turn H-1 such that at turn H-1 (the last action) we end at y=9.\n\nNote: the player starts at (0,0) at turn0. We are to output the actions for turn0, turn1, ... until the turn when we first reach (0,9).\n\nApproach:\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state: (turn, y) and record the action sequence. But note that the turn can be large? However, the problem is constrained: we have only 10 rows and we are going from 0 to 9. The minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we have obstacles so we might have to wait or even go down? But note we start at 0 and goal is 9, so going down from 0 is not allowed (y must be at least 0). So we can only go up or stay.\n\nHowever, note: we might have to wait (stay) to avoid a car. Also, we might have to go down? Actually, from y=0 we cannot go down (because then y would become -1, which is not allowed). Similarly, at y=9, we cannot go up.\n\nBut wait: the problem says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at y=0 and we do D, then we stay at 0? Or is it that the move is clipped? The update: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]\n\nSo if we are at y=0 and we do D: then y_{t+1} = 0 - 1 = -1 -> but then it must be clipped to 0? The problem doesn't specify clipping. It says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", meaning that the move is only allowed if the new y is in [0,9]. But the problem does not say that the move is disallowed. We must interpret: the move is adjusted? Or the move is invalid? \n\nLooking back: \n    \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where ... and y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\"\n\nThis suggests that the move is only defined if the new y is in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and try to go down, then that action would lead to a state that is not allowed. Therefore, such an action is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we cannot go up.\n\nSo the available actions at a state y_t:\n  - If y_t = 0: only U and S (D is invalid)\n  - If y_t = 9: only D and S (U is invalid)\n  - Otherwise: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we are only moving vertically, and we must avoid the cars on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns). So we want to get to 9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can do BFS (or Dijkstra, but since all actions cost 1, BFS by number of turns) over the state (y, turn_count) but note that the turn index matters because the cars move.\n\nHowever, the state space is: \n   - y: 0..9 (10 states)\n   - and the turn index: we are going to simulate until we reach 9. The minimal H might be around 9 to 20? But note that the cars move, and we might have to wait. But the car positions are linear in time, so we can compute the car position at any future turn.\n\nBut note: the car positions are defined for all turns, but they are periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed and the road is infinite? So the car spans at time T are linear functions of T.\n\nHowever, the collision condition at a freeway k at time T: we need to check for each car on freeway k at time T: is 0 in the car's span at time T?\n\nBut note: the problem states that the cars are given at time t1=0. So for any future turn T, we can compute the car's span.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn0 to turn H. The state we are in at a step is (t, y), meaning that at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. Then we must check that at turn t, when we are at y_t, we do not collide with any car on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nImportant: at turn t, the player is at (0, y_t) and we check the cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSo we can simulate:\n\n   at turn t (starting at t=0, state y0=0):\n        - Check: is there a car on freeway y0=0? But note: freeways are from 1 to 8. So at y=0 (or y=9) there are no cars? \n          The problem says: cars are on freeways y=1,...,8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars to collide with? \n\n        Therefore, the start (y=0) and goal (y=9) are safe.\n\n   But note: during the journey, we traverse freeways 1 to 8.\n\nSo at each turn t and state y, if y is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), we must check all cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn0 for each freeway. We can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and each car on that freeway, the span at any turn t: \n   Let t0 = 0 (the initial turn).\n   For a car on freeway k: \n        if direction is right: \n            span at turn t: [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n        if direction is left:\n            span at turn t: [h - s*t, tau - s*t]   [Note: the initial representation for left is (head, tail) and the span is [h, tau] at t0? But the problem says for left: span(t0)=[h, tau] and then at t: [h-s*t, tau-s*t].]\n\nHowever, note the representation: for the left-moving car, the problem says: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\". So if we have a car (h, tau, left, s) at t1=0, then at turn t, the span is [h - s*t, tau - s*t].\n\nBut observe: if h < tau, then the car would be from h to tau? But in the example for freeway2: (48,71,left,24) -> at t0: [48,71] meaning the car is from 48 to 71? Then at t=1: [24,47]. So the car is moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: (48,37,right,4) -> at t0: [37,48] (because the problem says: for right, span(t0)=[tau, h] = [37,48]). Then at t=1: [37+4=41, 48+4=52].\n\nNow, we must check for a given turn t and freeway k: if the player is at (0,k) at turn t, then we check every car on freeway k (at turn t) to see if 0 is in [L, R] (for right: [tau+s*t, h+s*t] and for left: [h-s*t, tau-s*t]). But note: the problem says for left: the span is [h, tau] at t0 and then becomes [h-s*t, tau-s*t]? That would be [min, max] for the left car? Actually, no: because if we have a left-moving car that is initially from 48 to 71, then the entire car is from 48 to 71. After moving left, it becomes from 48-24*t to 71-24*t. So if 48-24*t <= 0 <= 71-24*t, then collision.\n\nBut note: the problem says for left: the initial span is [h, tau] and then [h-s*t, tau-s*t]. However, if h < tau, then the car is from h to tau? But in the example, h=48 and tau=71, so 48<71. Then the car is from 48 to 71. Then after moving left, it is from 48-24*t to 71-24*t. \n\nBut what if a car is defined with h>tau? For example, a left-moving car with (71,48,left,24)? Then the initial span is [71,48]? Then the update: [71-24*t, 48-24*t]. But then at t0: [71,48] would be from 71 to 48? That doesn't make sense because 71>48. So the problem must be consistent: \n\n  For left-moving: the head is the leftmost point? Then the tail is the rightmost? But the problem says: \"head\" and \"tail\". \n\n  Actually, the problem does not specify the meaning of head and tail beyond the update rule. So we must follow the update rule as given.\n\n  For left-moving: the update rule is defined as [h - s*t, tau - s*t]. So if we take the two numbers and the update, we don't care which is bigger? But the span is the set of x such that min(h - s*t, tau - s*t) <= x <= max(h - s*t, tau - s*t)? \n\n  However, the problem does not say that. It just says the span is [h - s*t, tau - s*t]. But if h>tau, then h-s*t > tau-s*t? Then the interval [h-s*t, tau-s*t] would be invalid (since normally the first number is the left bound and the second the right). \n\n  But looking at the example: freeway2: (48,71,left,24) -> at t0: [48,71] -> that's an interval from 48 to 71. Then at t=1: [48-24,71-24] = [24,47]. So it's an interval.\n\n  Similarly, for right: (48,37,right,4) -> at t0: [37,48] -> then at t=1: [41,52].\n\n  Therefore, we can interpret the span as the interval from the first number to the second number, and we assume that at t0, the first number is the left endpoint and the second the right? \n\n  However, for right: the problem says: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" -> so the first number is tau and the second is h. Since for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost, then tau should be the leftmost. So in the example: tau=37 and h=48, so [37,48] is correct.\n\n  For left: the problem says: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" -> so the first number is h and the second is tau. In the example: h=48 and tau=71, so [48,71] meaning the car extends from 48 to 71.\n\n  Therefore, the span is always [left_end, right_end] at time t, regardless of direction? Then for a car at time t on a freeway, we can represent it by an interval [L(t), R(t)] and then check if 0 is in [L(t), R(t)].\n\n  How to compute L(t) and R(t) for a car:\n\n      If the car is right-moving: \n          L(t) = tau0 + s * t\n          R(t) = h0 + s * t\n\n      If the car is left-moving:\n          L(t) = h0 - s * t\n          R(t) = tau0 - s * t\n\n  But note: in the data, for a car we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). So:\n\n      For a right-moving car: we have (h0, tau0, 'right', s) -> then L(t) = tau0 + s*t, R(t)=h0+s*t.\n      For a left-moving car: we have (h0, tau0, 'left', s) -> then L(t)=h0-s*t, R(t)=tau0-s*t.\n\nHowever, in the data for freeway1: \n      (48,37,right,4) -> h0=48, tau0=37 -> then L(t)=37+4*t, R(t)=48+4*t.\n      (0,-11,right,4) -> h0=0, tau0=-11 -> then L(t)=-11+4*t, R(t)=0+4*t.\n\nFreeway2: (48,71,left,24) -> h0=48, tau0=71 -> then L(t)=48-24*t, R(t)=71-24*t.\n\nFreeway3: (-48,-83,right,36) -> h0=-48, tau0=-83? Then L(t)=-83+36*t, R(t)=-48+36*t.\n\nFreeway4,5,6: (48,37,right,12) -> L(t)=37+12*t, R(t)=48+12*t.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway3: (-48,-83,right,36) -> same.\n\nFreeway8: \n      (48,37,right,4) -> L(t)=37+4*t, R(t)=48+4*t.\n      (12,1,right,4) -> L(t)=1+4*t, R(t)=12+4*t.\n      (-24,-35,right,4) -> L(t)=-35+4*t, R(t)=-24+4*t.\n\nNow, we want to know: at a given turn t (starting at t=0) and freeway k, is there any car on freeway k that has L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)?\n\nWe note that the freeways are independent. We can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of turns t at which the player would collide if on that freeway at turn t.\n\nBut note: the same freeway has multiple cars. We must check all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe can create a function for freeway k: is_safe(k, t) that returns True if at turn t, freeway k has no car that covers 0.\n\nSteps:\n\n  1. Precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the interval [L(t), R(t)] at turn t.\n\n  2. Then, for a state (t, y) (meaning that at the beginning of turn t, we are at y, and we are about to choose an action for this turn) we must check:\n        - If we are at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at turn t, then we check if freeway y is safe at turn t? \n          If not, then we cannot be at (t, y) -> so we avoid that state.\n\n        But note: we are about to choose the action for turn t. However, the state (t, y) is the state at the start of turn t, and then we choose an action which will determine y_{t+1}. But the collision check for turn t is for being at freeway y at the entire turn t? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\n        So at the state (t, y), we are at freeway y at turn t. Therefore, we must check: if y is in [1,8], then we must check if freeway y is safe at turn t. If it is not, then we cannot use this state.\n\n        However, note: we start at turn0: y0=0 -> safe (because no cars at y=0). Then we choose an action a0 that leads to y1. Then at turn0, we are at y0=0 (safe). Then at turn1, we are at y1 (which might be 0 or 1). Then at turn1, we check freeway y1 at turn1.\n\n  3. Therefore, in our BFS, when we are at state (t, y), we have already passed the collision check for turn t? Actually, we enter the state at the start of the turn, and we are about to process the turn. But we must check: is (t, y) safe? \n\n        - If y=0 or y=9, then safe.\n        - Else (y in 1..8): check all cars on freeway y at turn t: if any car covers 0, then this state is unsafe -> we skip.\n\n        Then, if safe, we can choose an action for this turn.\n\n  4. Then, we compute the next state: \n        y_next = y + Delta, where Delta depends on the action (U: +1, D: -1, S:0) but bounded to [0,9]. \n        Then the next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n        But note: at the next state (t+1, y_next), we will then check the safety at turn t+1 (if y_next in 1..8).\n\n  5. We start at (0,0) -> safe because y=0. Then we choose an action at turn0.\n\n  We are to output the actions for turns 0,1,...,H-1 such that at the last action (turn H-1) we end at y=9.\n\n  Note: when we are at state (t, y) and y=9, we have reached the goal. But we must ensure that the state (t,9) is safe? At freeway 9, there are no cars -> safe.\n\n  However, we must also check: we might have arrived at y=9 at the end of an action (so at the beginning of the next turn we are at 9). But the problem: we want to reach (0,9) at the last action? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\n  So the state after the last action is (0,9). Therefore, at the last turn (turn = H-1) we are at y_{H-1} and we do the last action that leads to y_H = 9? \n\n  But note: the update: \n        turn0: start at y0=0 -> then action a0 -> y1 = y0 + Delta0.\n        ...\n        at turn H-1: we are at y_{H-1}, then we do a_{H-1} -> y_H = y_{H-1} + Delta.\n\n        We require y_H = 9.\n\n  Therefore, the state we are in at the beginning of turn H-1 is y_{H-1} and we choose an action that leads to 9. Then we stop.\n\n  How do we represent the state? \n\n        We can represent the state as (t, y) meaning that at the beginning of turn t, the player is at y. \n\n        Then we choose an action a_t that leads to y_{t+1} = y + Delta, and then we go to state (t+1, y_{t+1}).\n\n        The initial state is (0,0).\n\n        The goal condition: we want to have y_{t+1} = 9? But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the action sequence. So after the last action (at turn t = H-1) we have y_{H} = 9.\n\n        Therefore, we are done at the moment we have taken the action that puts us at 9. \n\n        So the state (t, y) does not include the action that we are about to take. We are going to take an action at turn t and then end at y_{t+1}. Then if y_{t+1} = 9, we are done and the last action is a_t.\n\n        Therefore, we can also represent the state as (t, y) and then when we generate next states, we compute the next y and then if that next y is 9, we have found a solution of H = t+1 (because we have taken t+1 actions: from t=0 to t=t).\n\n        Alternatively, we can have the goal state as (t,9) and then the number of turns is t? But note: we start at (0,0) and then we do actions for turns 0 to t-1 to end at (t,9). Then the number of actions is t.\n\n        But the problem says: minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n        So if we end at (t,9) meaning we have taken t actions? Actually:\n\n            turn0: we do a0 -> then at the end of turn0 we are at y1.\n            ...\n            at the end of turn t-1: we are at y_t = 9.\n\n            Therefore, we have taken t actions: from a0 to a_{t-1}. Then H = t.\n\n        So the state (t, y) in our BFS: t is the number of actions taken so far? Actually, we are at the beginning of turn t (after having taken t actions) and we are at y. Then we will take an action a_t (which is the t-th action) and then move to (t+1, y').\n\n        The initial state: at the beginning of turn0, we have taken 0 actions and we are at y0=0.\n\n        Then we want to reach a state where after taking the action (at the beginning of turn H, we have y_H=9) but that state would be (H,9). However, we don't need to take an action at turn H. We only take actions from turn0 to turn H-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we can stop as soon as we have y=9 at the beginning of a turn? But note: we might have reached 9 at the beginning of turn t, then we don't need to take any more actions. But the problem says: we must end at (0,9) at the last action. So if we are at (t,9) and we haven't taken the action for turn t, then we don't need to? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: we are to output a sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). So if we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t, then we don't need to take any action? But note: we started at (0,0) at turn0, so we are not at (0,9) initially.\n\n        How do we model the goal? \n\n            We want that at the beginning of some turn t, we are at y_t=9? Then we have taken t actions? Actually, no: because at the beginning of turn0, we are at y0=0. Then we take action a0 and then at the beginning of turn1, we are at y1. \n\n            To be at y_t=9 at the beginning of turn t, we must have taken t actions (from turn0 to turn t-1). Then we stop: we don't take an action at turn t? \n\n            But the problem: we want to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So H is the number of actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the player is at (0,9) at the next turn.\n\n            Therefore, we can say: we have taken H actions and we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn H (if we start at turn0). \n\n            So the goal condition: we are at state (H,9) meaning we have taken H actions and then we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, we can run BFS until we find a state (t,9) for some t, and then the minimal t is H? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions (from turn0 to turn H-1). \n\n        So H = t (the state (t,9) means we have taken t actions and we are at 9). \n\n        However, we must note that the state (t,9) is the state at the beginning of turn t (after t actions). But we don't take an action at turn t? \n\n        Actually, we take an action at each turn from 0 to t-1. Then at the beginning of turn t, we are at 9. \n\n        Therefore, we can set the goal as: state (t,9) for some t. And we want the minimal t.\n\n        But note: we must check the safety at the state (t,9)? Since 9 is safe, we don't need to worry.\n\n        However, we also have the states along the way: we must check safety at every state (t, y) for y in [1,8] at the beginning of turn t.\n\n        Therefore, algorithm:\n\n            Let dist[t][y] = minimum number of actions to be at (t,y) (which is the beginning of turn t, after t actions). We want the smallest t such that we have (t,9) and we can break.\n\n            We use a queue: (t, y, path) or we can store parent pointers.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Start: (0,0) -> t=0, y=0.\n\n                Then we consider all actions: \n                    For each action a in allowed_actions(y):\n                         y_next = y + Delta(a) [clamped to [0,9]? Actually, we disallow actions that lead to y_next not in [0,9].]\n\n                Then the next state is (t+1, y_next). But before we can go to that state, we must check the state (t, y) (the current state) is safe? \n\n                    - If y is 0 or 9: safe.\n                    - Else: check freeway y at turn t: if there is any car on freeway y at turn t that has 0 in its span -> unsafe.\n\n                However, note: the current state (t, y) is the state at the beginning of turn t. We are about to take an action at turn t. The collision check for turn t is for the entire turn t? \n\n                The problem says: collision at turn T if at turn T the player is on freeway y_T and 0 in a car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\n                So at the beginning of turn t, we are at (0,y) and we are going to take an action. But the collision condition is for the entire turn t? \n\n                Actually, the player is at freeway y for the entire turn t? \n\n                The problem does not specify the timing within the turn. But note: the action we take at turn t will change the freeway at the next turn. And the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". \n\n                So at turn t, we are only on freeway y_t (the one at the beginning of the turn). Therefore, we check freeway y_t at turn t.\n\n                Therefore, we must check the state (t,y) for safety (if y in [1,8]) before we can even consider taking an action.\n\n                But note: we started at (0,0): safe. Then we take an action at turn0 to go to y1. Then at turn0 we were at y0=0 (safe). Then at the beginning of turn1, we are at y1. Then we check turn1: if y1 is in [1,8] then check freeway y1 at turn1.\n\n            Therefore, in the BFS:\n\n                We start by enqueueing (0,0) [with path []] and mark visited for (0,0).\n\n                Then for a state (t,y):\n\n                    - If we haven't checked safety for (t,y): \n                         if y is in [1,8]: \n                              if there exists a car on freeway y at turn t such that 0 is in [L(t), R(t)] -> then this state is invalid -> skip.\n                         else (y=0 or y=9): safe.\n\n                    - Then if it is safe, then for each action a in allowed_actions(y):\n                         y_next = y + delta(a)   [but if y_next is not in [0,9], skip this action]\n                         then the next state is (t+1, y_next). \n\n                    - If we haven't visited (t+1, y_next) then we enqueue it and record the path.\n\n                    - If y_next==9, then we have found a solution: H = t+1 (because we have taken t+1 actions: from turn0 to turn t) and the path is the sequence of actions.\n\n            We do BFS so we find the minimal t.\n\n        However, note: the state (t,y) might be reached at different times? But we are doing BFS by t (the turn index). Since each action increases t by 1, we can do a simple BFS by increasing t.\n\n        But note: we might have cycles? But we want the minimal H, so we don't want to cycle. We can use a visited set: (t,y). But note: we might come to the same y at a later turn? And that might be necessary? For example, if we have to wait for a car to pass, we might stay at a freeway for several turns. \n\n        However, if we are at (t1,y) and then later at (t2,y) with t2>t1, then if we have a shorter path to (t1,y) we don't need to consider (t2,y) if we are looking for minimal H? But note: we are doing BFS by t (which is the number of actions). So we are expanding t in increasing order. Therefore, if we have already reached y at an earlier t, then we don't need to consider a later t? \n\n        Actually, no: because the safety condition depends on t. A freeway might be safe at t1 but not at t2. And also, we might need to wait at a freeway for a few turns to avoid a car. Therefore, we cannot prune by (y) alone. We must keep (t,y). \n\n        The state space: t can be large? But note: the minimal H is at least 9. How long might we have to wait? The cars move at integer speeds and the spans are periodic? Actually, the car positions are linear in t. \n\n        For example, consider a car: [L(t), R(t)] = [a*t + b, c*t + d]. We need to check if 0 is in [a*t+b, c*t+d]. \n\n        This condition is linear in t. For a given car, the condition holds for a contiguous set of t (or possibly two intervals if the car moves across 0 multiple times? But the car moves at constant speed in one direction. Actually, the car moves linearly, so the condition holds for one contiguous interval of t? \n\n        But note: we don't need to compute the entire timeline. We are going to simulate t from 0 upwards until we find the goal. The minimal H is at least 9, and we don't expect to wait too long. \n\n        However, to be safe, we can set a limit. Since the cars move fast, the intervals of danger for a freeway might be periodic? \n\n        Actually, the condition for a car: \n            For a right-moving car: we require L(t) <= 0 <= R(t) \n                ->  a1*t + b1 <= 0 <= a2*t + b2.\n\n            For a left-moving car: similarly.\n\n        The set of t for which the condition holds is an interval (if the car is moving at a constant speed). \n\n        But note: we have multiple cars per freeway. So the unsafe set of t for a freeway k is the union of the unsafe intervals for each car on k.\n\n        However, we don't need to precompute all unsafe intervals. We can check for a given t and freeway k: by iterating over the cars and checking the condition.\n\n        Given that the minimal H is at least 9, and we are doing BFS by t (the number of actions) and we are going to stop as soon as we reach 9, we can set a reasonable limit. The worst-case might be if we have to wait for a long time. But note: the cars move at integer speeds and the road is infinite. The gaps between when a car covers 0 might be large? \n\n        However, observe: the condition for a car to cover 0 is a linear inequality. For example, for a right-moving car: \n            L(t) = tau0 + s*t <= 0  => t <= (0 - tau0)/s\n            R(t) = h0 + s*t >= 0  => t >= ceil((0 - h0)/s)   [if s>0]\n\n        Actually, the condition: \n            tau0 + s*t <= 0 <= h0 + s*t\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n            t >= ceil(-h0/s)   and   t <= floor(-tau0/s)   ? \n\n        But note: if s>0, then:\n            tau0 + s*t <= 0  -> t <= (-tau0)/s\n            0 <= h0 + s*t -> t >= (-h0)/s\n\n        However, if s=0? but the speeds are positive.\n\n        But note: the problem gives positive speeds.\n\n        So the unsafe interval for a car is [ceil((-h0)/s), floor((-tau0)/s)]? But note: we are using integers? The problem does not say the positions are integers? But the initial positions are integers and speeds are integers, and t is integer. So we can do integer arithmetic.\n\n        Actually, the condition: \n            tau0 + s*t <= 0   -> t <= (-tau0) // s? But we must use real numbers? \n\n        However, since we are at integer t, we can compute:\n\n            t_min = ceil( max( (-h0)/s, (-tau0)/s? ) -> actually, we have two inequalities:\n\n            We require: \n                tau0 + s*t <= 0   -> t <= floor( (-tau0) / s )   [because if (-tau0)/s is fractional, then the maximum integer t is floor( (-tau0)/s )]\n                and\n                h0 + s*t >= 0   -> t >= ceil( (-h0) / s )\n\n        But note: for the right-moving car: the condition is:\n            tau0 + s*t <= 0 <= h0 + s*t\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n            (-h0)/s <= t <= (-tau0)/s\n\n        Therefore, t must be in the interval [ceil((-h0)/s), floor((-tau0)/s)]? \n\n        However, note: if (-h0)/s is not integer, then ceil((-h0)/s) is the smallest integer t such that t>=(-h0)/s.\n\n        Similarly, floor((-tau0)/s) is the largest integer t such that t<=(-tau0)/s.\n\n        Example: the car (0, -11, right, 4) on freeway1:\n            h0=0, tau0=-11, s=4.\n            Condition: (-0)/4 = 0, and (-(-11))/4 = 11/4 = 2.75 -> floor=2.\n            So t in [0,2]? \n\n            Check:\n                t=0: [ -11, 0] -> 0 is in [ -11, 0] -> yes.\n                t=1: [-11+4,0+4] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in -> yes.\n                t=2: [-11+8,0+8] = [-3,8] -> yes.\n                t=3: [1,12] -> no.\n\n            So the interval is [0,2]. \n\n        But our computed interval: [ceil(0/4)=0, floor(11/4)=2] -> correct.\n\n        Similarly, for a left-moving car: \n            Condition: h0 - s*t <= 0 <= tau0 - s*t\n            -> \n                0 >= h0 - s*t  -> s*t >= h0 -> t >= ceil(h0/s)\n                0 <= tau0 - s*t -> s*t <= tau0 -> t <= floor(tau0/s)\n\n            Example: freeway2: (48,71,left,24)\n                h0=48, tau0=71, s=24.\n                t_min = ceil(48/24)=ceil(2)=2\n                t_max = floor(71/24)=floor(2.95)=2\n                So only t=2.\n\n            Check:\n                t0: [48,71] -> 0 not in.\n                t1: [48-24=24,71-24=47] -> not in.\n                t2: [0, 71-48=23] -> 0 is in? but 0 is the left endpoint: [0,23] -> yes, 0 is included.\n\n            So the condition holds at t=2.\n\n        Therefore, we can precompute for each freeway k the union of intervals [t_min, t_max] for each car where the freeway k is unsafe at turn t.\n\n        Then the function is_safe(k, t) is: if t is in any of the unsafe intervals for freeway k -> unsafe, else safe.\n\n        But note: we have multiple cars per freeway. So we compute the union of the intervals for all cars on k.\n\n        Then we can store for each freeway k: a list of intervals (a,b) meaning that for t in [a,b] (inclusive) the freeway k is unsafe.\n\n        Then to check at (t,k): if t falls in any interval for freeway k, then unsafe.\n\n        However, we can also compute on the fly for a given (k,t) by iterating over the cars on k and checking the condition for that car? But that might be faster? Because we are going to check for each state (t,y) and y=k, and we are going to do that for every state we expand. \n\n        The number of states: t up to maybe 100? and 10 y's -> 1000 states. And each freeway k has at most 3 cars. So 1000*3 = 3000 checks? That's acceptable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the unsafe intervals for each freeway and then store them. Then for a given (k,t) we can do a binary search? But since the unsafe intervals for a freeway might be disjoint, we can store a sorted list and then check membership.\n\n        But since the number of cars per freeway is small (at most 3) and the number of states t we consider is not too large, we can just check per car.\n\n        Let's write a helper function:\n\n            def is_safe(k, t):\n                if k==0 or k==9:\n                    return True\n                cars = cars_on_freeway[k]   # list of cars: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n                for car in cars:\n                    (h0, tau0, d, s) = car\n                    if d == 'right':\n                        L = tau0 + s * t\n                        R = h0 + s * t\n                        if L <= 0 <= R:\n                            return False   # unsafe\n                    else: # left\n                        L = h0 - s * t\n                        R = tau0 - s * t\n                        if L <= 0 <= R:\n                            return False\n                return True\n\n        But note: the condition for the interval: we are using <= and including the endpoints? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\" meaning if 0 is between L and R, inclusive.\n\n        Therefore, we use: L <= 0 <= R.\n\n        However, note: in the left-moving example at t=2: L=0, R=23 -> 0<=0<=23 -> true.\n\n        So this condition is correct.\n\n        Now, let's code the BFS:\n\n            Let's have a queue: deque of (t, y, path) \n            visited: we can use a set of (t,y) to avoid duplicates? But we might have the same (t,y) by different paths? We want the minimal t to reach y? But note: we are doing BFS by t (the number of actions) so we will visit (t,y) at time t. And we don't want to visit the same (t,y) twice? But we can have multiple paths to (t,y). However, we are doing BFS and we are expanding t in increasing order, so the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal number of actions. So we can mark visited for (t,y).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                queue = deque([(0,0,[])])   # (t, y, actions_so_far)\n                visited = set()\n                visited.add((0,0))\n\n                while queue:\n                    (t, y, path) = queue.popleft()\n\n                    # Check if we reached the goal: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. We are going to take an action at turn t? \n                    # But note: we haven't taken the action for turn t. The goal is to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t? \n                    # Actually, we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t, meaning we have taken t actions? \n                    # And then we stop. The number of turns H = t? \n                    # But the problem says: the sequence of actions is from turn0 to turn H-1. \n                    # And we have taken t actions: from turn0 to turn t-1. Then H = t.\n\n                    if y == 9:\n                        # We are done: output the path (which is the sequence of t actions: for turn0 to turn t-1)\n                        # But note: the current state is (t,9): we haven't taken an action at turn t? \n                        # Actually, we don't need to take an action at turn t because we are already at 9.\n                        # So the last action we took was at turn t-1. Therefore, the sequence of actions is for turns 0 to t-1 -> H = t.\n                        return path, t\n\n                    # Check safety at (t,y): \n                    if not is_safe(y, t): \n                        # Skip this state: we cannot be here at turn t.\n                        continue\n\n                    # Then, for each action in allowed_actions(y):\n                    actions = []\n                    if y == 0:\n                        actions = ['U','S']\n                    elif y == 9:\n                        actions = ['D','S']   # but note: we are already at 9 and we have a goal condition above. So we won't be here if we are at 9? \n                        # Actually, we already checked y==9 above and returned.\n                    else:\n                        actions = ['U','D','S']\n\n                    for a in actions:\n                        # Compute next y\n                        if a == 'U':\n                            y_next = y + 1\n                        elif a == 'D':\n                            y_next = y - 1\n                        else: # 'S'\n                            y_next = y\n\n                        # If y_next is not in [0,9], skip? \n                        if y_next < 0 or y_next > 9:\n                            continue\n\n                        # Next state: (t+1, y_next)\n                        if (t+1, y_next) in visited:\n                            continue\n\n                        visited.add((t+1, y_next))\n                        new_path = path + [a]   # the action for turn t is a\n                        queue.append((t+1, y_next, new_path))\n\n                # If we exit the loop, no solution? But there should be a solution.\n\n        However, note: we might have to wait arbitrarily long? But the unsafe intervals are finite? For each car, the unsafe interval is finite. For example, for a right-moving car: the condition only holds for t in [t_min, t_max]. Then after t_max, the car has passed 0? \n\n        But note: the cars move infinitely? So if we wait long enough, the car will pass? \n\n        However, there might be multiple cars? and periodic? Actually, no: each car moves in one direction and never comes back. So for each car, there is a finite interval of turns when it covers 0. Then after that, it never covers 0 again.\n\n        Therefore, for each freeway k, there is a finite set of intervals of danger. Then after the last interval, the freeway k is safe forever.\n\n        So we can set a limit: we know the maximum t_max for any car on any freeway. But we can compute that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can run until we find the goal. Since the minimal H is at least 9, and the cars will eventually pass, we will eventually be able to go through. \n\n        But note: we start at t=0. The unsafe intervals might be in the future? \n\n        We can compute the maximum t for which any freeway is unsafe? \n\n        For each car, we have t_max = \n            if right: floor((-tau0)/s)\n            if left: floor(tau0/s)   [from the condition: t<=floor(tau0/s) for left?]\n\n        Actually, for left: t <= floor(tau0/s) -> the last unsafe turn for that car.\n\n        Then the global maximum unsafe turn T_max = max_{all cars} (max_unsafe_turn) \n\n        Then we can run BFS until t = T_max + 9? \n\n        But note: we might have to wait until after T_max? \n\n        Actually, if we wait until T_max+1, then all freeways are safe? \n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is at most T_max + 9? \n\n        We can compute T_max from the cars:\n\n            freeway1: \n                car1: (48,37,right,4): t_max = floor((-37)/4) = floor(-9.25) = -10? -> but that's negative? \n\n            Let me recompute:\n\n                For a right-moving car: unsafe when t in [ceil((-h0)/s), floor((-tau0)/s)]\n                For car1: h0=48, tau0=37 -> \n                    t_min = ceil((-48)/4)=ceil(-12)= -12? \n                    t_max = floor((-37)/4)=floor(-9.25)= -10\n\n                But t>=0. So this car is never unsafe for t>=0? \n\n                Check: at t=0: [37,48] -> 0 not in? -> safe.\n\n            Another car on freeway1: (0,-11,right,4): \n                t_min = ceil((-0)/4)=0\n                t_max = floor(11/4)=2\n\n            So T_max from freeway1: 2.\n\n            freeway2: (48,71,left,24): \n                t_min = ceil(48/24)=ceil(2)=2\n                t_max = floor(71/24)=2\n\n            So T_max=2.\n\n            freeway3: (-48,-83,right,36): \n                t_min = ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.33)=2? -> wait: condition for right: \n                    t_min = ceil((-h0)/s) = ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.33)=2\n                    t_max = floor(83/36)=floor(2.305)=2\n\n                So unsafe at t=2.\n\n            freeway4,5,6: (48,37,right,12): \n                t_min = ceil(-48/12)=ceil(-4)= -4 -> but t>=0, so not unsafe? \n                t_max = floor(-37/12)=floor(-3.08)= -4 -> so no unsafe for t>=0.\n\n            freeway7: same as freeway3: unsafe at t=2.\n\n            freeway8: \n                (48,37,right,4): unsafe? \n                    t_min = ceil(-48/4)=ceil(-12)= -12 -> no\n                    t_max = floor(-37/4)=floor(-9.25)=-10 -> no\n                (12,1,right,4):\n                    t_min = ceil(-12/4)=ceil(-3)= -3 -> no\n                    t_max = floor(-1/4)=floor(-0.25)= -1 -> no\n                (-24,-35,right,4): \n                    t_min = ceil(24/4)=ceil(6)=6\n                    t_max = floor(35/4)=floor(8.75)=8\n\n                So unsafe for t in [6,8].\n\n            Therefore, the maximum unsafe turn is 8 (from freeway8 car3).\n\n            So we can set a limit: if we haven't reached the goal by t = 8+9 = 17, then we might have to wait until after 8? Actually, we can wait at a safe freeway until after the unsafe intervals.\n\n            But note: we are doing BFS by t. We will eventually find the minimal H.\n\n        However, to avoid infinite loops, we can set a maximum t to consider: say 100.\n\n        Now, let's run the BFS:\n\n            We start at (0,0) -> safe because y=0.\n\n            Then we consider actions: at y=0, we can do U or S.\n\n            If we do S: then next state (1,0) -> then we check safety at (1,0): safe? y=0 -> safe.\n\n            Then we can do S again: (2,0), then (3,0), ... but we want to minimize H, so we prefer going up.\n\n            We try to go up as much as possible.\n\n            We note: freeways 1 to 8 are unsafe at some turns. We must avoid being on a freeway k at an unsafe turn.\n\n            We'll compute the unsafe intervals for each freeway:\n\n                Freeway1: unsafe only for t in [0,2] (from the car (0,-11,right,4)) -> so at t=0,1,2: unsafe for freeway1.\n\n                But note: we are at freeway1 at the beginning of turn t. So if we are at freeway1 at turn0: then we are unsafe? \n                    turn0: freeway1: check car1: (48,37,right,4): [37,48] -> 0 not in -> safe? \n                    car2: (0,-11,right,4): [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\n                So freeway1 is unsafe at t=0.\n\n                Similarly, at t=1: freeway1: car1: [41,52] -> safe; car2: [-7,4] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n                t=2: car2: [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n                t=3: car2: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n                So freeway1: unsafe at t=0,1,2.\n\n                Freeway2: unsafe only at t=2: [0,23] -> unsafe.\n\n                Freeway3: unsafe at t=2: [ -83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n\n                Freeway4,5,6: safe for all t>=0? \n                    freeway4: (48,37,right,12): at t0: [37,48] -> safe; t1: [49,60] -> safe; etc.\n\n                Freeway7: same as freeway3: unsafe at t=2.\n\n                Freeway8: \n                    car1: (48,37,right,4): safe for t>=0? \n                    car2: (12,1,right,4): safe for t>=0? \n                    car3: (-24,-35,right,4): unsafe for t in [6,8]: \n                        t=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n                        t=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n                        t=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n                        t=9: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            Therefore, we can make a table:\n\n                freeway1: unsafe at t in {0,1,2}\n                freeway2: unsafe at t in {2}\n                freeway3: unsafe at t in {2}\n                freeway7: unsafe at t in {2}\n                freeway8: unsafe at t in {6,7,8}\n\n            Now, we want to go from y0=0 to y=9.\n\n            The minimal path: 9 moves up: U repeated 9 times. Then we would be at:\n\n                turn0: start at y0=0 -> safe (y0=0). Then do U -> to y1=1.\n                turn1: state (1,1): we are at freeway1 at turn1 -> unsafe (freeway1 is unsafe at t=1) -> so we cannot do that.\n\n            Therefore, we must avoid being at freeway1 at turn1.\n\n            We can wait at y0=0 for a few turns? \n\n            For example: \n                turn0: S -> then at turn1: (1,0) -> safe (y0=0). \n                turn1: S -> then at turn2: (2,0) -> safe.\n                turn2: S -> then at turn3: (3,0) -> safe.\n\n            Then at turn3: we do U -> then at turn4: we are at (4,1). \n                Check freeway1 at turn4: safe (because freeway1 is safe at t>=3).\n\n            Then we can do U again: \n                turn4: U -> turn5: (5,2)\n                Check freeway2 at turn5: safe? freeway2 unsafe only at t=2 -> safe.\n\n            Then U: turn5: U -> turn6: (6,3)\n                freeway3 at turn6: safe? freeway3 unsafe only at t=2 -> safe.\n\n            Then U: turn6: U -> turn7: (7,4) -> freeway4: safe (always safe) -> safe.\n            Then U: turn7: U -> turn8: (8,5) -> freeway5: safe.\n            Then U: turn8: U -> turn9: (9,6) -> freeway6: safe.\n            Then U: turn9: U -> turn10: (10,7) -> freeway7: safe? \n                freeway7 unsafe at t=2 -> at t=10: safe.\n            Then U: turn10: U -> turn11: (11,8) -> freeway8: check turn11? \n                freeway8 unsafe at t in {6,7,8} -> t=11 is safe.\n            Then U: turn11: U -> turn12: (12,9) -> goal.\n\n            So the sequence: \n                turn0: S\n                turn1: S\n                turn2: S\n                turn3: U\n                turn4: U\n                turn5: U\n                turn6: U\n                turn7: U\n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: U\n\n            H = 12.\n\n            But is there a shorter path?\n\n            We can try to avoid waiting so long. \n\n            Note: freeway1 is unsafe at t=0,1,2. So we can be at freeway1 at t=3 or later.\n\n            Similarly, freeway2,3,7 are unsafe at t=2. So we can be at freeway2 at t=0,1,3,4,... but not t=2.\n\n            freeway8 unsafe at t=6,7,8: so we can be at freeway8 at t=0,...,5,9,...\n\n            We want to minimize the total turns.\n\n            We can try to go up as fast as possible, avoiding the unsafe turns.\n\n            We note the times when we are on a freeway:\n\n                If we go up without waiting, we are at:\n                    turn0: at y0=0 (safe) -> then we do U -> at turn1: y1=1 -> freeway1 at turn1 -> unsafe.\n\n            So we must not be at freeway1 at turn1. We can delay the first U until turn3? \n\n            Then the timeline:\n\n                turn0: at y0=0 -> safe. We do S -> then turn1: at y1=0 -> safe.\n                turn1: at y1=0 -> safe. We do S -> turn2: at y2=0 -> safe.\n                turn2: at y2=0 -> safe. We do U -> turn3: at y3=1 -> freeway1 at turn3: safe? (since freeway1 safe at t>=3) -> safe.\n                turn3: at y3=1 -> safe. We do U -> turn4: at y4=2 -> freeway2 at turn4: safe? (freeway2 unsafe only at t=2 -> safe) -> safe.\n                turn4: at y4=2 -> safe. We do U -> turn5: at y5=3 -> freeway3 at turn5: safe? (freeway3 unsafe only at t=2 -> safe) -> safe.\n                turn5: at y5=3 -> safe. We do U -> turn6: at y6=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n                turn6: at y6=4 -> safe. We do U -> turn7: at y7=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n                turn7: at y7=5 -> safe. We do U -> turn8: at y8=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n                turn8: at y8=6 -> safe. We do U -> turn9: at y9=7 -> freeway7 at turn9: safe? (freeway7 unsafe at t=2 -> safe) -> safe.\n                turn9: at y9=7 -> safe. We do U -> turn10: at y10=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: safe? (freeway8 unsafe at t=6,7,8 -> t=10 is safe) -> safe.\n                turn10: at y10=8 -> safe. We do U -> turn11: at y11=9 -> goal.\n\n            Total actions: 11 (from turn0 to turn10) -> H=11.\n\n            Sequence: \n                turn0: S\n                turn1: S\n                turn2: U\n                turn3: U\n                turn4: U\n                turn5: U\n                turn6: U\n                turn7: U\n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n\n            But wait: at turn10, we are at freeway8? Then we do U to go to 9. And at turn11, we are at 9 -> goal.\n\n            So the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n            Is there a path with H=10? \n\n            We must be at turn10 at y=9. \n\n            We start at (0,0). We take 10 actions. The last action is at turn9? Then at the beginning of turn10 we are at y10=9.\n\n            How do we get from 0 to 9 in 10 actions? The minimal without waiting is 9 actions (all U). But we had to wait 2 turns at the beginning. \n\n            With 10 actions: we can do 9 U and 1 S? But that would be 9 moves: we would end at 9? \n\n            Actually, if we do 9 U and 1 S, we are still moving up 9 times: so we get to 9. But the total actions is 10: for example: \n                actions: S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U -> then at the last action we go from 8 to 9? \n\n            But we must avoid the unsafe turns.\n\n            We need to be at freeway1 at a safe time (>=3) and freeway8 at a safe time (not in {6,7,8}).\n\n            The timeline of y as a function of t:\n\n                t0: y0=0\n                t1: y1 = ? \n                ...\n\n            We have 10 actions: so we will be at the beginning of turn10 at y10.\n\n            We want y10=9.\n\n            The positions:\n\n                Let a0, a1, ..., a9 be the actions.\n\n                y1 = y0 + a0\n                y2 = y1 + a1\n                ...\n                y10 = y9 + a9\n\n                and y0=0, and we require y10=9.\n\n                Also, we require y1 to y9 in [0,9].\n\n            And we must be safe at states: \n                (0,0): safe.\n                (1,y1): safe? \n                ...\n                (9,y9): safe.\n\n            We are not concerned with (10,9) because that is the goal and safe.\n\n            Now, the constraint for freeway1: if we are at y1=1 at turn1 -> unsafe. \n            Similarly, we cannot be at freeway1 at turn0? but we start at 0.\n\n            We cannot be at freeway1 at turn1 (t=1) or turn2 (t=2). So we must avoid being at y=1 at t=1, and at y=1 at t=2? \n\n            Similarly, freeway2: avoid being at y=2 at t=2.\n            freeway3: avoid being at y=3 at t=2.\n            freeway7: avoid being at y=7 at t=2? -> but at t=2, we are at y=0 (if we wait) or at most y=2? \n            freeway8: avoid being at y=8 at t=6,7,8.\n\n            Let's try to assign:\n\n                We need to have 9 up moves and 1 stay (or 1 down? but down would be inefficient).\n\n            We must have at least 2 waits at the beginning? because we cannot be at freeway1 at t=1 or t=2.\n\n            How about:\n\n                t0: at 0 -> safe. We do S -> then at t1: y1=0 -> safe.\n                t1: at 0 -> safe. We do U -> then at t2: y2=1 -> but at turn2: freeway1 is unsafe -> collision.\n\n            So we cannot do U at t1.\n\n            Then:\n\n                t0: S -> t1:0\n                t1: S -> t2:0\n                t2: U -> t3:1 -> safe (freeway1 at t3: safe)\n                then we do 8 U: \n                    t3: U -> t4:2 -> freeway2 at t4: safe (t4!=2)\n                    t4: U -> t5:3 -> freeway3 at t5: safe\n                    t5: U -> t6:4 -> safe\n                    t6: U -> t7:5 -> safe\n                    t7: U -> t8:6 -> safe\n                    t8: U -> t9:7 -> freeway7 at t9: safe (t9=9? -> t=9, freeway7 unsafe only at t=2 -> safe)\n                    t9: U -> t10:8 -> freeway8 at t9: wait, at the beginning of turn9: we are at y9=7? Then we do U at turn9: then at the beginning of turn10 we are at y10=8? \n\n                Then we need one more U to get to 9? but we only have 10 actions. We are at turn10: we are at y10=8. Then we need an action at turn10 to go to 9? But then H would be 11.\n\n            Alternatively, we do 9 U and 1 S. We have to use the S somewhere. \n\n            How about we do the S later? \n\n            We can try to avoid freeway8 at unsafe turns:\n\n                freeway8 is unsafe at t=6,7,8. We must not be at freeway8 (y=8) at the beginning of turn6,7,8.\n\n            We will be at freeway8 at the turn when we are at y=8. \n\n            We want to be at y=8 at a turn that is not in {6,7,8}. \n\n            The earliest we can be at y=8: \n                We have to do 8 up moves. But we start at 0. We have to do 2 S at the beginning to avoid freeway1 at t=1,2.\n\n                Then:\n                    t0: S -> t1:0\n                    t1: S -> t2:0\n                    t2: U -> t3:1\n                    t3: U -> t4:2\n                    t4: U -> t5:3\n                    t5: U -> t6:4\n                    t6: U -> t7:5\n                    t7: U -> t8:6\n                    t8: U -> t9:7\n                    t9: U -> t10:8  -> then we are at freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\n                Then we need one more U at turn10 to go to 9: then at turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\n                So 11 actions.\n\n            How about we do an extra U and skip a wait? \n\n            We try to be at freeway1 at t=3: then we can be at freeway8 at t=9: \n\n                We need to be at y=1 at t=3: then we must not do any U at t0, t1, t2: so we do S at t0, t1, then at t2 we do U -> then at t3: we are at 1.\n\n                Then we do 8 U: \n                    t3: U -> t4:2\n                    t4: U -> t5:3\n                    t5: U -> t6:4\n                    t6: U -> t7:5\n                    t7: U -> t8:6\n                    t8: U -> t9:7\n                    t9: U -> t10:8\n\n                Then we are at freeway8 at t10: safe.\n\n                Then we do U at t10: -> t11:9 -> goal. 11 actions.\n\n            How about we do one less wait? \n\n                t0: U -> then at t1: we are at 1 -> unsafe (freeway1 at t1: unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n                t0: S \n                t1: U -> then at t2: y=1 -> but freeway1 at t2: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n            So we must wait at least 2 turns at the beginning.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n            But note: we have freeway8 unsafe at t=6,7,8. In the above, we are at freeway8 at t=10 -> safe.\n\n            However, is there a way to be at freeway8 earlier than t=10, but at a safe turn? \n\n            The safe turns for freeway8 are t<=5 or t>=9.\n\n            We want to be at freeway8 at the beginning of a turn t with t<=5 or t>=9.\n\n            If we are at freeway8 at t=5: then we can do U at turn5 to go to 9 at turn6? \n\n            How to get to freeway8 (y=8) at the beginning of turn5:\n\n                We start at (0,0). We need to go from 0 to 8 in 5 actions? That requires 8 up moves in 5 actions? impossible.\n\n            How about at turn9: \n\n                We want to be at y=8 at the beginning of turn9: then we can do U at turn9 to go to 9 at turn10.\n\n                How to get to y=8 at turn9: \n                    We have 9 actions: from turn0 to turn8.\n\n                    We must have 8 up moves and 1 non-up move? \n\n                We also have to avoid the unsafe turns at the beginning: freeway1 at t=0,1,2: we must not be at freeway1 at t=0? we start at 0. Then at turn0 we can do S: then at turn1: y1=0 -> safe.\n                Then we can do U at turn1: then at turn2: y2=1 -> freeway1 at turn2: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n                So we must wait at least until turn3 to be at freeway1.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    turn0: S -> y1=0\n                    turn1: S -> y2=0\n                    turn2: U -> y3=1 -> safe (freeway1 at t3: safe)\n                    turn3: U -> y4=2 -> freeway2 at t4: safe?

The problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn0 to turn10.\n\n        Therefore, the answer:\n\n            Turn 0: S\n            Turn 1: S\n            Turn 2: U\n            Turn 3: U\n            Turn 4: U\n            Turn 5: U\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n\n        We write it in the box.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t1=0.\n\n        So:\n\n            Turn 0: S\n            Turn 1: S\n            Turn 2: U\n            Turn 3: U\n            Turn 4: U\n            Turn 5: U\n            Turn 6: U\n            Turn 7: U\n            Turn 8: U\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n\n        We output:\n\n            \\boxed{\n                Turn 0: S\n                Turn 1: S\n                Turn 2: U\n                Turn 3: U\n                Turn 4: U\n                Turn 5: U\n                Turn 6: U\n                Turn 7: U\n                Turn 8: U\n                Turn 9: U\n                Turn 10: U\n            }\n\n        But wait: we have 11 lines? The minimal H is 11, so the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n        The problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so from t=0 to t=H-1=10.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        We'll write it.\n\n        However, let me check if there is a path with H=10? \n\n            We have to use one less action. But we have to go from 0 to 9. The minimal moves is 9. But we had to do 2 waits, so total 11.\n\n            How about we do one wait and then 9 ups? But then we would be at freeway1 at turn1 (if we do U at turn0) -> unsafe.\n\n            Or we do U at turn0: unsafe.\n\n            Or we do S at turn0 and then 9 U from turn1 to turn9? \n\n                Then:\n                    turn0: S -> turn1: y=0 -> safe.\n                    turn1: U -> turn2: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn2: unsafe (t=2: freeway1 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n            Or we do U at turn0: unsafe.\n\n            Or we do S at turn0, then at turn1: we are at 0. Then we do U at turn1: then at turn2: y=1 -> unsafe.\n\n            We must avoid freeway1 at turn1 and turn2. The only way is to be at freeway1 at turn>=3. So we must have at least two S at the beginning? \n\n            Therefore, minimal H=11.\n\n        So we output the sequence.\n\n        However, note: in the BFS we described, we would find this path.\n\n        We'll code the BFS to confirm, but since the state space is small, we can do it by hand.\n\n        We'll run BFS for t up to 11.\n\n        We'll record:\n\n            State (t,y): \n                t=0: (0,0) -> safe -> then we do S: next state (1,0); U: next state (1,1) -> but (1,1) is unsafe? -> skip.\n                So from (0,0): we only enqueue (1,0) with path=['S'].\n\n            t=1: state (1,0): safe (y=0).

(freeway2 unsafe only at t=2 -> safe) -> safe.\n\n                    So we enqueue (4,0) with path+['S'] = ['S','S','U','S']? \n                    and (4,1) with ['S','S','U','S']? -> but wait, the path for (3,1) is ['S','S','U'] -> then we do S: becomes ['S','S','U','S'] -> then (4,1)\n                    and we do U: becomes (4,2) with ['S','S','U','U'].\n\n            We are looking for the goal at state (t,9). \n\n            We continue until we find a state (t,9). The first time we can be at 9? \n\n            The minimal t: we have to go up 9 times. The earliest we start going up is at t2. Then the 9th up would be at turn (2+9-1)=10? Then at the beginning of turn11: we are at 9.\n\n            So we look for (11,9).\n\n            How to get to (11,9): \n                We must have taken 9 up moves and 2 stays (at the beginning). \n\n            We'll see: the state (11,9) will be reached by a path that has 9 U and 2 S.\n\n            But note: we have 11 actions: so the path must be 11 actions.\n\n            The path we found: \n                S, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U -> 2 S and 9 U -> 11 actions.\n\n            We'll see: \n                (0,0) -> S -> (1,0) \n                (1,0) -> S -> (2,0)\n                (2,0) -> U -> (3,1)\n                (3,1) -> U -> (4,2)\n                (4,2) -> U -> (5,3)\n                (5,3) -> U -> (6,4)\n                (6,4) -> U -> (7,5)\n                (7,5) -> U -> (8,6)\n                (8,6) -> U -> (9,7)\n                (9,7) -> U -> (10,8)\n                (10,8) -> U -> (11,9) -> goal.\n\n            So we return the path: [S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U] (11 actions).\n\n            Therefore, we output as above.\n\n        We'll write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 11.

Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3.\n- At turn 3, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1 at turn 3 is safe: car spans are [49, 60] and [1, 12], 0 not in either). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2 at turn 4 is safe: car span is [-48, -25], 0 not in). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3 at turn 5 is safe: car span is [97, 132], 0 not in). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4 at turn 6 is safe: car span is [109, 120], 0 not in). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5 at turn 7 is safe: car span is [121, 132], 0 not in). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6 at turn 8 is safe: car span is [133, 144], 0 not in). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7 at turn 9 is safe: car span is [241, 276], 0 not in). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8 at turn 10 is safe: car spans are [77, 88], [41, 52], and [5, 16], 0 not in any). Action: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAfter the action at turn 10, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 11.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 1, starting at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if at the moment we are on freeway y_T (i.e., we are at position (0, y_T) at turn T) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso note: When we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are considered to be on y_T during turn T. So we are only at risk from the cars on the freeway we are currently on (at the start of the turn) during that turn.\n\nWe can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We are constrained to y in [0,9]. We start at y=0 and need to reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8. The cars are described for each freeway (k=1 to 8). Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the car moves to the left. The span at time t is [h - s*(t-t1), τ - s*(t-t1)]? But note the representation: in the table, for a left-moving car, the head is at a larger x? Actually, the problem says:\n\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the example for left-moving: [h, τ] with h and τ? Actually, the problem states:\n\n  Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\n  Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, the initial span is from h to τ? But note that h and τ might be such that h > τ or h < τ? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] and then subtracts, so if the car is moving left, then the entire span shifts left. Similarly for right.\n\nBut note: the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4). \n\nFor a right-moving car, the initial span is [τ, h]? So for the first car: τ=41, h=52? Then the span at t1=1 is [41,52]. Then at time T, it becomes [41 + 4*(T-1), 52 + 4*(T-1)].\n\nBut wait, the problem says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]? Actually, the problem says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving. So the car is from τ to h? Then the tail is τ and head is h? Then moving right, so at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, τ] -> then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the table, for freeway 2: (24,47,left,24). This is left-moving. So initial span is [24,47]? Then at time T, [24-24*(T-1), 47-24*(T-1)].\n\nWe are only concerned when the car's span covers x=0 at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting at t1=1) whether at turn T, if we are on that freeway, then 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe are starting at turn 1 at y=0. We are safe at y=0 and y=9 because there are no cars? The problem says cars are on freeways y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns? Without any cars, we could go straight up: 9 moves (each U) in 9 turns. But we have to avoid the cars on freeways 1-8.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that we never are on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 1 at y=0. We are safe at turn 1 because we are at y=0.\n\nWe can move at most 1 per turn. So we need at least 9 turns to go from 0 to 9 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (S) or even go down to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must compute the positions of the cars at every turn. However, note that the cars move continuously in the x-direction, and we are only at x=0.\n\nWe are only concerned with whether at turn T, for a freeway k, the car spans (for any car) contain 0.\n\nSo for each freeway k and for each turn T, we can compute the set of intervals (the spans of the cars) and check if 0 is in any of them.\n\nBut note: the cars are given at turn t1=1. So we can compute for any T (>=1) the position of the cars.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t1=1. Then for a turn T (>=1), the car positions are computed as:\n\nFor a car on a freeway:\n\n- If right-moving: initial at t1=1: [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n- If left-moving: initial at t1=1: [h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. Similarly for right.\n\nSo at turn T, we need to check for a freeway k: is there any car on k such that 0 is in the interval [A, B] where:\n\n- For a right-moving car: A = τ + s*(T-1), B = h + s*(T-1)\n- For a left-moving car: A = h - s*(T-1), B = τ - s*(T-1)\n\nBut note: the interval for a right-moving car is [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)] and for a left-moving car is [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]. However, we must note that the interval must be interpreted as a continuous segment. Since the car moves, the interval shifts.\n\nBut note: the car might wrap around? The problem does not say, but from the numbers (like negative and large positive) it seems we are to consider the entire integer line? So the intervals are over the integers? And 0 is an integer.\n\nWe are to avoid if 0 is in the interval [A, B] (inclusive) for any car on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at turn t1=1:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n  Car1: (52,41,right,4) -> right-moving: so initial span [τ=41, h=52] -> at T: [41+4*(T-1), 52+4*(T-1)]\n  Car2: (4,-7,right,4) -> right-moving: [τ=-7, h=4] -> at T: [-7+4*(T-1), 4+4*(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2):\n  Car: (24,47,left,24) -> left-moving: initial span [h=24, τ=47] -> at T: [24-24*(T-1), 47-24*(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3):\n  Car: (-12,-47,right,36) -> right-moving: [τ=-47, h=-12] -> at T: [-47+36*(T-1), -12+36*(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4):\n  Car: (60,49,right,12) -> right-moving: [τ=49, h=60] -> at T: [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as 4? \n  Car: (60,49,right,12) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same as 4 and 5?\n  Car: (60,49,right,12) -> same.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7):\n  Car: (-12,-47,right,36) -> same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8):\n  Three cars:\n    (52,41,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car1: [41+4*(T-1),52+4*(T-1)]\n    (16,5,right,4) -> right-moving: [τ=5, h=16] -> [5+4*(T-1),16+4*(T-1)]\n    (-20,-31,right,4) -> right-moving: [τ=-31, h=-20] -> [-31+4*(T-1),-20+4*(T-1)]\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (starting from 1) whether 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns T=1,2,3,... and we start at y0=0 (at turn1). We can only change y by -1,0,1 per turn.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn (1+H-1) = H (since we start at turn1, then after H-1 actions we are at turn1+H-1, so we want y_{1+H-1}=9).\n\nWe start at turn1 at y=0.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal H. The state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=1) and y is the current y-coordinate. We are going to simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the turn number matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nWe start at (turn=1, y=0). Then we can choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then at turn2, we are at y1 = y0 + Delta y.\n\nBut note: the collision check at a state (turn=T, y=k) is: if k is between 1 and 8, then we check if at turn T, freeway k has a car that covers 0. If it does, then we cannot be at that state.\n\nWe are safe at k=0 and k=9.\n\nWe want to minimize H, the total number of turns (from turn1 to turn H, and we are at turn H at y=9). So H is the number of turns taken (including the starting turn?).\n\nActually, we start at turn1 at (0,0). Then we take H-1 actions to get to turn (1 + (H-1)) = H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nSo we need to find a path from (1,0) to (H,9) with minimal H.\n\nWe can do BFS in the state (t, y). Since we are minimizing H, we can do a BFS that expands by increasing t.\n\nBut note: the state space: t can be large? But the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, the intervals are linear in time. However, because the speeds are constant, the condition for 0 being in an interval is periodic? Not exactly, because the intervals are shifting at constant speeds.\n\nBut note: we are only interested in when the intervals cover 0. For a given car and freeway, the condition is an inequality that is linear in T. So we can compute for each freeway the set of T for which the freeway is unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (from 1 up to a certain limit, say 20 or 30, because minimal H without obstacles is 9) the safety.\n\nWe'll compute a table: safe[k][T] = True if at turn T, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on k has 0 in its span at T), else False.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars, so we must check all.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the condition for 0 to be covered by a car.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n  Car1: [41+4*(T-1), 52+4*(T-1)] contains 0?\n        => 41+4*(T-1) <= 0 <= 52+4*(T-1)\n        Solve: \n          41+4*(T-1) <= 0  => 4*(T-1) <= -41 -> T-1 <= -10.25 -> T <= -9.25 -> impossible? since T>=1.\n        So car1 never covers 0.\n\n  Car2: [-7+4*(T-1), 4+4*(T-1)] contains 0?\n        => -7+4*(T-1) <= 0 <= 4+4*(T-1)\n        First inequality: -7+4*(T-1) <= 0 -> 4*(T-1) <= 7 -> T-1 <= 1.75 -> T <= 2.75 -> so T=1,2\n        Second inequality: 0 <= 4+4*(T-1) -> always true for T>=1.\n        So for T=1: \n            interval: [-7+0, 4+0] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n        T=2: [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n        T=3: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        T>=3: the interval moves to the right and 0 is left of the left endpoint.\n\n        So freeway1 is unsafe at T=1 and T=2, safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2):\n  Car: [24-24*(T-1), 47-24*(T-1)] contains 0?\n        => 24-24*(T-1) <= 0 <= 47-24*(T-1)\n\n        Note: the interval is [24-24*(T-1), 47-24*(T-1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire interval moves left.\n\n        First inequality: 24-24*(T-1) <= 0 -> 24 <= 24*(T-1) -> T-1 >= 1 -> T>=2.\n        Second inequality: 0 <= 47-24*(T-1) -> 24*(T-1) <= 47 -> T-1 <= 47/24 ~ 1.958 -> T<=2.958 -> so T=2.\n\n        So only at T=2: \n          T=2: [24-24, 47-24] = [0,23] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is [0,23] (assuming inclusive). So unsafe at T=2.\n\n        For T=1: \n          [24,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        T=3: [24-48, 47-48] = [-24,-1] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So freeway2: safe at T=1, unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3):\n  Car: [-47+36*(T-1), -12+36*(T-1)] contains 0?\n        => -47+36*(T-1) <= 0 <= -12+36*(T-1)\n\n        First: -47+36*(T-1) <=0 -> 36*(T-1) <=47 -> T-1 <= 47/36 ~ 1.305 -> T<=2.305 -> so T=1,2.\n        Second: 0 <= -12+36*(T-1) -> 12 <=36*(T-1) -> T-1>=12/36=1/3 -> T>=1.333 -> so T>=2.\n\n        So both conditions: T=2? \n          T=1: first condition holds? T=1: -47<=0 -> true, but second: 0<=-12? false -> not in.\n          T=2: [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n\n          T=3: [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So freeway3: safe at T=1, unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4):\n  Car: [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)] -> \n        49+12*(T-1) <=0? -> 12*(T-1)<=-49 -> impossible for T>=1. \n        So never covers 0 -> always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 and 6: same as 4 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7):\n  Car: same as freeway3: [-47+36*(T-1), -12+36*(T-1)] -> same as freeway3: unsafe only at T=2, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8):\n  Car1: [41+4*(T-1),52+4*(T-1)] -> same as freeway1 car1: never covers 0.\n  Car2: [5+4*(T-1),16+4*(T-1)] -> \n        Check: 5+4*(T-1) <=0<=16+4*(T-1)\n        First: 5+4*(T-1)<=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=-5 -> impossible -> never covers 0.\n  Car3: [-31+4*(T-1),-20+4*(T-1)] -> \n        Check: -31+4*(T-1) <=0<=-20+4*(T-1)\n        First: -31+4*(T-1)<=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=31 -> T-1<=7.75 -> T<=8.75 -> T=1..8\n        Second: 0<=-20+4*(T-1) -> 20<=4*(T-1) -> T-1>=5 -> T>=6.\n\n        So for T in [6,8] (since T<=8.75 and T>=6 and integer): T=6,7,8.\n\n        T=6: [-31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is [-11,0] -> so 0 is the right endpoint? inclusive -> unsafe.\n        T=7: [-31+24, -20+24] = [-7,4] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n        T=8: [-31+28, -20+28] = [-3,8] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n\n        For T=1: [-31, -20] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        T=2: [-27,-16] -> safe.\n        ... until T=5: [-31+16, -20+16] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n        T=9: [-31+32, -20+32] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway8: unsafe for T=6,7,8; safe otherwise.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nTurn T=1:\n  Freeway1: unsafe (from car2) -> so y=1 unsafe at T=1.\n  Freeway2: safe.\n  Freeway3: safe.\n  Freeway4: safe.\n  Freeway5: safe.\n  Freeway6: safe.\n  Freeway7: safe.\n  Freeway8: safe (at T=1, car3: [-31,-20] doesn't cover 0).\n\n  So at T=1, if we are at y=1: unsafe. Other freeways (2-8) are safe at T=1.\n\nTurn T=2:\n  Freeway1: unsafe (car2: [-3,8] covers 0)\n  Freeway2: unsafe (only at T=2: [0,23] covers 0)\n  Freeway3: unsafe (at T=2: [-11,24] covers 0)\n  Freeway4: safe\n  Freeway5: safe\n  Freeway6: safe\n  Freeway7: unsafe (same as freeway3: at T=2: [-11,24] covers 0)\n  Freeway8: safe (at T=2: car3: [-27,-16] -> 0 not in)\n\n  So at T=2, freeways 1,2,3,7 are unsafe; 4,5,6,8 are safe.\n\nTurn T=3:\n  Freeway1: safe (car2: [1,12] -> 0 not in)\n  Freeway2: safe\n  Freeway3: safe\n  Freeway4: safe\n  Freeway5: safe\n  Freeway6: safe\n  Freeway7: safe\n  Freeway8: safe? because T=3 is not in [6,8] -> safe.\n\n  So T=3: all freeways safe.\n\nTurn T=4: similarly, all freeways safe? \n  Freeway8: unsafe only at T=6,7,8 -> so safe at T=4.\n\nTurn T=5: safe.\n\nTurn T=6:\n  Freeway8: unsafe -> so y=8 at T=6 is unsafe.\n\nTurn T=7: freeway8 unsafe.\n\nTurn T=8: freeway8 unsafe.\n\nTurn T=9: freeway8 safe.\n\nWe can now plan the path.\n\nWe are at turn1, y=0. We can choose to go up (to y=1) or stay (y=0) or down (but down to y=-1 is not allowed, so only U or S).\n\nBut at turn1, if we go up to y=1, then at turn1 we are at y=1 -> and at T=1, freeway1 is unsafe -> collision. So we cannot go up at turn1.\n\nSo we must stay at y=0 at turn1: action S.\n\nThen at turn2: we are still at y=0? Actually, we did S: so y2 = y1 + 0 = 0.\n\nNow at turn2: we are at y=0 (safe). We can choose to go up (to y=1) or stay.\n\nBut at turn2: if we go to y=1, then at turn2 we are at y=1 -> and freeway1 at T=2 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=2: then at turn2 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at T=2 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we must stay at y=0 at turn2? Or we could go down? but we are at y=0, so down is not allowed. So only S again.\n\nAt turn2: we are at y=0 (safe). Then we choose S: so we remain at y=0 for turn3.\n\nAt turn3: we are at y=0. Now at turn3, we can move.\n\nWe can go up to y=1. At turn3: freeway1 is safe (as we computed) -> so we can be at y=1 at turn3.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up twice? But we are at turn3: we can only do one action.\n\nSo at turn3: we do U -> y=1.\n\nNow at turn4: we are at y=1. What can we do?\n\nWe can go up to y=2, or stay at y=1, or go down to y=0.\n\nCheck turn4: \n  freeway1: safe? yes (T=4: freeway1 is safe, as we saw for T>=3).\n  freeway2: safe? yes (T=4: freeway2 safe).\n\nSo if we go up to y=2 at turn4: then we are at y=2 at turn4 -> freeway2 at T=4: safe -> allowed.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=3 at turn5: freeway3 at T=5: safe? we computed freeway3 safe for T>=3 -> yes.\n\nBut note: we want to go to 9. We can go straight up from turn3 to turn12? but we have to avoid freeway8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe are at turn3: y=1.\n  turn4: we go to y=2 (safe)\n  turn5: y=3 (safe)\n  turn6: y=4 (safe) -> but note: at turn6, we are at y=4 -> freeway4: always safe -> safe.\n\n  turn7: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 always safe)\n  turn8: y=6 -> safe\n  turn9: y=7 -> freeway7: safe? at T=9: we computed freeway7 safe for T>=3 and T!=2 -> so safe.\n\n  turn10: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=10 -> safe? because unsafe only at T=6,7,8 -> so T=10 is safe.\n\n  turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: we start at turn1 at y0=0. Then:\n\n  Turn1: S -> at turn1: y=0 (safe)\n  Turn2: S -> at turn2: y=0 (safe)\n  Turn3: U -> at turn3: y=1 (safe)\n  Turn4: U -> at turn4: y=2 (safe)\n  Turn5: U -> at turn5: y=3 (safe)\n  Turn6: U -> at turn6: y=4 (safe)\n  Turn7: U -> at turn7: y=5 (safe)\n  Turn8: U -> at turn8: y=6 (safe)\n  Turn9: U -> at turn9: y=7 (safe)\n  Turn10: U -> at turn10: y=8 (safe)\n  Turn11: U -> at turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: 11. But we are at turn11? And we started at turn1. So H = 11? \n\nBut note: we take H-1 actions to get to turn (1+H-1)=H. So we take 10 actions? \n\nWe started at turn1. After 10 actions (from t1 to t1+9) we are at turn10? \n\nWait: \n  At turn1: we do action for turn1 -> then we are at the beginning of turn2? \n\nBut the problem: \n  We start at turn1 at position (0,0). Then we choose an action a_{t1} = a1. Then we update to the next state at turn t1+1? \n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn1: we are at y1=0. Then we choose a1 -> then at turn2, we are at y2 = y1 + Delta y1.\n\nSo the collision at turn T happens when we are at (0, y_T) at turn T. \n\nSo the state at turn T is after we have taken the action at turn T-1? \n\nBut at the start of turn1, we are at y1=0. Then we take an action a1. Then we move to y2. Then at turn2, we are at y2.\n\nSo the collision at turn T is determined by the position y_T (which is the state at the start of turn T?).\n\nActually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nAnd we are at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nSo we are at y_T at the start of turn T? And then we take an action to move to y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, we must check the state at the start of each turn.\n\nIn our plan:\n\n  Turn1: we are at y=0 -> safe. Then we take an action a1. Then we move to y2 (for turn2).\n\n  We are at turn2: at y2 -> then we check collision for turn2.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n  We did:\n      a1 = S -> so y2 = 0 + 0 = 0.\n      Then at turn2: we are at (0,0) -> safe? but wait, at turn2 we are at y=0 -> safe (because freeways are 1-8, and we are at 0).\n\n      Then a2 = S -> y3 = 0.\n      Then turn3: we are at y3=0 -> safe.\n      Then a3 = U -> y4 = 0+1 = 1.\n      Then turn4: we are at y4=1 -> we check freeway1 at T=4: safe -> okay.\n\n      Then a4=U -> y5=2 -> turn5: at y=2 -> freeway2 at T=5: safe? we computed freeway2 safe for T>=3 -> yes.\n\n      Then a5=U -> y6=3 -> turn6: freeway3 at T=6: safe? yes (freeway3 safe for T>=3) -> okay.\n\n      Then a6=U -> y7=4 -> turn7: freeway4: safe -> okay.\n\n      Then a7=U -> y8=5 -> turn8: freeway5: safe -> okay.\n\n      Then a8=U -> y9=6 -> turn9: freeway6: safe -> okay.\n\n      Then a9=U -> y10=7 -> turn10: freeway7: safe? at T=10: we computed freeway7 safe for T>=3 and T!=2 -> safe.\n\n      Then a10=U -> y11=8 -> turn11: freeway8 at T=11: safe? because unsafe only at T=6,7,8 -> safe.\n\n      Then we haven't reached 9. We are at y=8 at turn11. Then we need one more action: U -> y12=9. Then at turn12: we are at y12=9 -> safe.\n\nSo we need to go to turn12.\n\nBut note: at turn12, we are at y=9 -> safe, and we have reached the goal.\n\nTotal turns: 12. We started at turn1 and ended at turn12. So H=12? \n\nBut the problem: we are at turn1, and we take H-1 actions to get to turn (1+H-1)=H. And we want to be at y=9 at turn H.\n\nSo we want to be at turn H at y=9.\n\nIn this plan: at turn12 we are at y=9. So H=12.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nNotice that we waited two turns at the beginning. But we might avoid waiting that long.\n\nAt turn1: we cannot go to y=1 because unsafe. So we must do S at turn1.\n\nAt turn2: we are at y=0. We cannot go to y=1 (unsafe at turn2) and we cannot go to y=2 (unsafe at turn2). So we must do S at turn2.\n\nThen at turn3: we can go up to y=1. Then we proceed as above.\n\nBut note: at turn3, we are at y=1 (safe). Then at turn4, we are at y=1? No, we moved to y=1 at turn3, then at turn4 we can move.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We have to avoid freeway8 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nWe are at turn3: y=1.\n  If we go up every turn, we get:\n      turn4: y=2\n      turn5: y=3\n      turn6: y=4 -> safe\n      turn7: y=5\n      turn8: y=6\n      turn9: y=7\n      turn10: y=8 -> but at turn10: freeway8 is safe? because unsafe only at 6,7,8 -> so T=10 is safe -> then turn11: y=9.\n\nSo that would be 11 turns? \n\nBut wait: \n  Start: turn1: y=0 -> safe. Action S -> turn2: y=0.\n  Action S -> turn3: y=0.\n  Action U -> turn4: y=1 -> safe? at turn4: freeway1 safe -> yes.\n  Action U -> turn5: y=2 -> safe? at turn5: freeway2 safe -> yes.\n  Action U -> turn6: y=3 -> safe? freeway3 at turn6: safe -> yes.\n  Action U -> turn7: y=4 -> safe.\n  Action U -> turn8: y=5 -> safe.\n  Action U -> turn9: y=6 -> safe.\n  Action U -> turn10: y=7 -> safe.\n  Action U -> turn11: y=8 -> at turn11: freeway8: T=11 -> safe -> then we need to go to 9 at turn12? \n\nBut we are at turn11: we are at y=8. Then we need to do one more U: \n  Action U at turn11 -> then at turn12: we are at y=9.\n\nSo that's 12 turns.\n\nAlternatively, can we reach y=9 earlier? \n\nWe started at turn1. The earliest we can be at y=9 is turn10? because we need 9 moves up. But we had to wait 2 turns at the beginning. So minimum 11 turns? (if we could do 9 moves in 9 turns, but we started with 2 stays, so 11 turns total).\n\nBut wait: if we could avoid the two waits? We cannot because at turn1 and turn2, we cannot go up without hitting.\n\nBut note: we could go down? but we are at y=0, so down is not allowed. So we must wait at least two turns.\n\nBut what if we do not wait two turns? At turn1: we do S -> then at turn2: we are at y=0. Then we cannot go up at turn2? because if we go up at turn2, then at turn2 we are at y=1? no: wait.\n\nAt the start of turn2: we are at y=0. Then we choose an action for turn2: if we choose U, then we move to y=1 at the next state, which is turn3? \n\nNo: the update: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t -> then we get y_{t+1} (for the next turn).\n\nSo at turn2: we are at y2=0 (from the action at turn1: S). Then we choose a2: if we choose U, then y3 = y2 + 1 = 1. Then at turn3: we are at y3=1.\n\nBut at turn3: freeway1 is safe (as we saw). So that is okay.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 at turn3. Then we can go up at turn3 to y=2 at turn4? \n\nBut at turn4: freeway2 is safe? yes (for T>=3). So that is okay.\n\nThen we proceed: \n  turn3: y=1\n  turn4: y=2\n  turn5: y=3\n  turn6: y=4\n  turn7: y=5\n  turn8: y=6\n  turn9: y=7\n  turn10: y=8 -> but at turn10: T=10, freeway8 is safe? yes (unsafe at 6,7,8 only). Then at turn11: we go to y=9.\n\nBut wait: we skipped one wait? \n\nHow many actions? \n  turn1: S -> leads to y2=0 (at turn2)\n  turn2: U -> leads to y3=1 (at turn3)\n  turn3: U -> y4=2\n  turn4: U -> y5=3\n  turn5: U -> y6=4\n  turn6: U -> y7=5\n  turn7: U -> y8=6\n  turn8: U -> y9=7\n  turn9: U -> y10=8\n  turn10: U -> y11=9\n\nThen we are at turn11: y11=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we started at turn1, and we have taken 10 actions (from turn1 to turn10). Then at turn11, we are at y=9. So H=11.\n\nBut we must check the collisions:\n\n  turn1: y1=0 -> safe.\n  turn2: y2=0 -> safe (because we did S at turn1: so we are still at 0 at turn2).\n  turn3: y3=1 -> freeway1 at T=3: safe? yes (as computed: safe for T>=3) -> safe.\n  turn4: y4=2 -> freeway2 at T=4: safe? yes -> safe.\n  turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3 at T=5: safe? yes -> safe.\n  turn6: y6=4 -> safe.\n  turn7: y7=5 -> safe.\n  turn8: y8=6 -> safe.\n  turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7 at T=9: safe? yes -> safe.\n  turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at T=10: safe? yes -> safe.\n  turn11: y11=9 -> safe.\n\nSo it works. And we reached at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions for 10 actions (H=11 turns) is:\n\n  Turn1: S\n  Turn2: U\n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n\nBut note: we take actions from turn1 to turn10, and then at turn11 we don't take an action? But the problem says: we take actions until we reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1). \n\nWe are at turn1, and we take H-1 actions to get to turn (1+H-1)=H. And we want to be at y=9 at turn H.\n\nIn this case, H=11: so we take 10 actions (from turn1 to turn10). Then at turn11, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the actions are for turns: 1,2,...,10.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence: {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-2? \n\nt1=1, and t from 0 to H-2? \n\nThe actions: \n  a_{t1+0} = a1\n  a_{t1+1} = a2\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-2} = a_{1+H-2}\n\nAnd we have H-1 actions? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nBut note: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? because after H-1 actions, we are at turn t1+H-1, and we want that to be the turn we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the sequence has H-1 actions.\n\nIn our case, H=11 (turns from 1 to 11, total 11 turns). So we need 10 actions: for t from 0 to 9 (since H-1=10).\n\nSo the actions: \n  a_{1+0} = a1 = S\n  a_{1+1} = a2 = U\n  ...\n  a_{1+9} = a10 = U\n\nSo the sequence: 10 actions.\n\nBut the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for t1=1:\n\n  Turn 1: S\n  Turn 2: U\n  Turn 3: U\n  Turn 4: U\n  Turn 5: U\n  Turn 6: U\n  Turn 7: U\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n\nBut note: we do not have an action for turn11? because after the 10th action (at turn10) we move to y11=9 at turn11. And we are done.\n\nSo the sequence is 10 actions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" — that would be for t=0 to 10? because H-1=10, so t=0,1,...,10? that's 11 actions. That doesn't match.\n\nI think there is a confusion in the indexing.\n\nThe problem: \n  We start at turn t1 (which is 1) at position (0,0). \n  We take actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-2} (H-1 actions) to get to turn (t1+H-1) at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem writes: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} — that would be t=0,1,...,H-1: which is H actions. \n\nBut then we would end at turn t1+H? and we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo I think the indexing in the problem might be off. \n\nLooking back: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd then we reach at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut if we take H actions (from t=0 to H-1), then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H (the next turn) would be updated.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut the update: after action a_{t} at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. \n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we must have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. That's H-1 actions.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be for t=0 to H-2: because a_{t1+0} ... a_{t1+H-2} — that's H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem writes: t=0 to H-1. That would be H actions.\n\nThis is a discrepancy.\n\nI think the problem means: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (so H-1 actions) and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the answer format writes for turn t1, then t1+1, ... up to the last action. The last action is at turn t1+H-2.\n\nIn our solution, H=11, so we take 10 actions: at turns 1 to 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer should list from turn1 to turn10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut note: we could have a shorter path? \n\nWhat if we try to go even faster? We started with one stay (at turn1: S) and then at turn2: we did U? \n\nBut we had to do the first S to avoid being at y=1 at turn1 (unsafe). Then at turn2 we were at y=0 and we did U to go to y=1 at turn3. \n\nWe cannot avoid the first S. Then the second turn: we did U. But we could do S again? but that would be slower.\n\nSo 10 actions (H=11) is minimal.\n\nBut wait: is there a path that takes only 10 turns? That is, we are at y=9 at turn10? \n\nWe start at turn1: y=0. \n  To get to y=9 at turn10, we need 9 up moves and possibly some stays. But we have 9 turns: from turn1 to turn10: that's 9 state updates? \n\nThe state updates: \n  turn1: start at y1=0.\n  turn2: after a1: y2 = y1 + Delta a1\n  ...\n  turn10: y10 = y9 + Delta a9.\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nThe minimal moves: 9 up moves. But we have only 9 actions (from turn1 to turn9). Then at turn10, we are at y10=9.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at turns 1 to 10 (for the freeways we are on).\n\nWe start at turn1: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we must take 9 U's. But we cannot do U at turn1: because then at turn2 we are at y=1, which at turn2: freeway1 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nWe could do: \n  turn1: S -> y2=0 (turn2: safe)\n  turn2: U -> y3=1 (turn3: safe)\n  turn3: U -> y4=2 (turn4: safe)\n  turn4: U -> y5=3 (turn5: safe)\n  turn5: U -> y6=4 (turn6: safe)\n  turn6: U -> y7=5 (turn7: safe)\n  turn7: U -> y8=6 (turn8: safe)\n  turn8: U -> y9=7 (turn9: safe)\n  turn9: U -> y10=8 (turn10: at y=8 -> freeway8 at T=10: safe) -> then we are at y=8 at turn10, not 9.\n\nSo we need one more U to get to 9 at turn11.\n\nAlternatively, we could do a double move? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo we must take 10 actions to get to y=9 at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 10 actions? and the last action (at turn10) is U, which moves us from y10 (which is 8) to y11=9 at turn11.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). The last action we take is at turn10 to get to (0,9) at turn11.\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and we have checked every turn.\n\nTherefore, this is the minimal path.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 11, achieved by taking 10 actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 1\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n- At turn 1, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up to \\(y=1\\) would result in a collision with a car on freeway 1 at turn 1 (unsafe). Therefore, the action is stay (S), remaining at \\(y=0\\) for turn 2.\n- At turn 2, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up to \\(y=1\\) or \\(y=2\\) would result in collisions (freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe at turn 2). Therefore, the action is stay (S), but this was already considered; however, staying again would not progress. Instead, after reevaluation, the optimal path uses up (U) at turn 2 to reach \\(y=1\\) at turn 3, which is safe (freeway 1 is safe at turn 3).\n- From turns 3 to 10, moving up (U) each turn progresses the player safely through the freeways:\n  - Turn 3: \\(y=1\\) (freeway 1 safe at turn 3).\n  - Turn 4: \\(y=2\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 4).\n  - Turn 5: \\(y=3\\) (freeway 3 safe at turn 5).\n  - Turn 6: \\(y=4\\) (freeway 4 always safe).\n  - Turn 7: \\(y=5\\) (freeway 5 always safe).\n  - Turn 8: \\(y=6\\) (freeway 6 always safe).\n  - Turn 9: \\(y=7\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 9).\n  - Turn 10: \\(y=8\\) (freeway 8 safe at turn 10, as unsafe only at turns 6, 7, 8).\n- After the action at turn 10, the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 11, which is safe (no cars at \\(y=9\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U}\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (each corresponding to y=1 to y=8).\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn T, and for the car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T contains 0.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y_T. Therefore, we only check the freeway corresponding to the current y at each turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1=2 until we reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 2, and we are at y=0.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (each action U, D, S) that moves the player vertically. The grid for y is from 0 to 9.\n\nThe challenge is that when we are on a freeway row (y=1,2,...,8) at a particular turn, we must avoid the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements:\n\nFor each car, we are given its state at turn t1=2. Then for any future turn T (>=2), we can compute the span of the car.\n\nNote: The cars are on specific freeways. The freeway index k corresponds to the row y=k. So:\n\n- Freeway 1: y=1\n- Freeway 2: y=2\n- ...\n- Freeway 8: y=8\n\nWe are given multiple cars per freeway in some cases.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if at that turn T, there is any car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span.\n\nHow to compute the car's span at turn T?\n\nLet delta_t = T - t1 = T - 2.\n\nFor a car with initial (at turn 2) head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n\n- If the car is left-moving (I assume direction \"left\" means it moves to the left, so decreasing x? But note the update rule: \n  Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-2), tau - s*(T-2)]\n  But note: the initial span for left-moving is given as (h, tau) and then it moves left, so the entire segment moves left.\n\nBut observe the example for freeway 2: \n  (0, 23, left, 24)\n\nAt turn T, the span becomes [0 - 24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)] = [-24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \n  Example: freeway 1: (56,45,right,4) -> [45 + 4*(T-2), 56 + 4*(T-2)]? \n  But note the update rule: \n    Right-moving: initial span [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)]\n\nHowever, looking at the input format: the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nIn the update rule for right-moving, they write: \n  \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the input for freeway1, we have two cars: (56,45,right,4) and (8,-3,right,4). \n\nFor the first car (56,45,right,4): \n  They say the initial span is [tau, h] = [45, 56]? But note the numbers: 45 to 56 is increasing? \n  Actually, they say: for right-moving, the head is at the right end? So the car is from 45 to 56? \n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at T=2, we have [45, 56]. Then at T=3, it becomes [45+4, 56+4] = [49,60].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway1: (8,-3,right,4) -> at T=2: [-3,8]? Then at T=3: [1,12].\n\nNow, for left-moving, the update rule: \n  [h - s*(T-2), tau - s*(T-2)] \n\nBut for freeway2: (0,23,left,24): \n  They say initial span at T=2: [0,23]? \n  Then at T=3: [0-24, 23-24] = [-24,-1].\n\nBut note: the update rule says: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" for left-moving? \n  Then for the freeway2 car: head=0, tail=23 -> so the car is from 0 to 23? But then moving left, so the entire segment moves left.\n\nHowever, the update rule for left-moving: \n  \"Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), tau - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if the initial span is [h, tau] = [0,23] and then at T=3: [-24,-1]. \n\nBut note: the car is moving left, so the head (which was at 0) moves to 0-24 = -24, and the tail (which was at 23) moves to 23-24 = -1. So the car is now from -24 to -1? That doesn't seem contiguous? Actually, the car is contiguous: from min to max. \n\nBut wait: the update rule for left-moving writes [h - s*(T-2), tau - s*(T-2)] and then the same for right-moving? \n\nHowever, in the right-moving update, they write [tau + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)]? Why the swap?\n\nI think the representation of the car is:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost point? and the tail is the rightmost? \n  So the car spans [head, tail] (with head <= tail) and moves left.\n\n- For a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost? and the tail is the leftmost? \n  So the car spans [tail, head] (with tail <= head) and moves right.\n\nBut in the input, the car is always given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nSo for a right-moving car: the head is the right end, and the tail is the left end. So the span is [tail, head] (which is increasing).\n\nFor a left-moving car: the head is the left end, and the tail is the right end? So the span is [head, tail] (which is increasing? but then when it moves left, both decrease).\n\nBut wait: the freeway2 car: (0,23,left,24): head=0, tail=23 -> so the car is from 0 to 23? Then moving left: at T=2: [0,23], at T=3: [0-24, 23-24] = [-24,-1]. So the car is from -24 to -1? That is contiguous? Actually, it is.\n\nSimilarly, the right-moving car: (56,45,right,4): head=56, tail=45 -> so the car is from 45 to 56? Then at T=3: [45+4,56+4]=[49,60].\n\nSo the representation is:\n\n- For a car: (head, tail, direction, speed):\n  - If direction is right: the car spans [tail, head] (because tail <= head) and moves right.\n  - If direction is left: the car spans [head, tail] (and note: head <= tail) and moves left.\n\nBut wait: in the freeway2 car: head=0, tail=23 -> head<=tail? yes. So [head, tail] = [0,23] is the initial span.\n\nIn the freeway1 car: head=56, tail=45 -> but 56>45, so for right-moving we use [tail, head] = [45,56].\n\nSo the update rule is consistent.\n\nTherefore, for a car at freeway k, at turn T (>=2), the span is:\n\nif direction is 'right':\n   span_low = tail + s*(T-2)\n   span_high = head + s*(T-2)\n\nif direction is 'left':\n   span_low = head - s*(T-2)\n   span_high = tail - s*(T-2)\n\nThen, the car occupies [span_low, span_high] at turn T.\n\nCollision condition: if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and for any car on that freeway, the span contains 0? i.e., \n   span_low <= 0 <= span_high\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nNow, we start at turn 2 at y=0. We are not on any freeway (freeways are y=1..8) so no collision at turn 2.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. Note: y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above 8, so we don't check for cars when we are at y=9.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). We want minimal H.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and check for collisions.\n\nWe have to consider that we can move up (U), down (D) or stay (S). But note: we start at y=0. We cannot go below 0 or above 9. So:\n\n- At y=0, we cannot go down -> D is not allowed? Actually, the rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and choose D, we get -1 which is invalid -> so the move D is not allowed at y=0? But the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\" so it must clamp? or we are not allowed to choose such an action?\n\nLooking at the update: it says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\" meaning that the move must result in a y in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and choose D, then y_{t+1} = -1, which is not allowed. Therefore, we must avoid actions that would take us outside [0,9].\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we cannot choose U.\n\nBut note: we want to get to (0,9). We can stop as soon as we are at y=9 at the end of a turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) but note: the state space is large because the turns can be large? However, the minimal H should be at least 9 (since we start at 0 and need to go to 9, and we can only move one step per turn). But we might have to wait sometimes to avoid cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? However, moving down when we are at low y might be counterproductive. We are to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, unless there is a car blocking.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check the collisions for each freeway we step on.\n\nWe start at turn 2, y=0.\n\nWe are going to consider the moves for each turn until we reach 9.\n\nWe note that the car positions change over time, so the same row might be safe at one turn and unsafe at another.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T and for each row y (if we are on that row at that turn) whether there is any car on that row (freeway k=y) such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 2) the safety: safe[k][T] = True if at turn T, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on freeway k has a span containing 0 at turn T).\n\nBut note: T can be large? However, we are only interested in turns until we reach the goal. Since we are going to move at most 9 steps up (if we go up every time, H=9) but we might have to wait. So we can set a bound: the minimal H is at least 9, and at worst we might have to wait a few turns. How long? The cars are moving at constant speeds, and we can compute when a car leaves the 0 position.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with whether 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nWe can compute for each car the time intervals (if any) when it covers 0.\n\nBut since the cars move continuously (in integer steps) and the spans are contiguous, we can compute the set of turns T for which the car covers 0.\n\nHowever, we have multiple cars per freeway.\n\nBut note: the problem is small: we have 8 freeways and a few cars per freeway. And we are only going to consider turns from T=2 up to, say, T=2+20 (if we wait 11 turns, that would be 20 turns total? but we hope to do it in 10-20 turns).\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the safety for each freeway at each turn as we simulate.\n\nLet me precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k the set of turns T (>=2) for which the car covers 0.\n\nThen, the freeway k is unsafe at turn T if any car on k covers 0 at T.\n\nBut note: we are at turn T, and we are on freeway k at that turn.\n\nWe'll precompute the safety for each freeway k for a range of turns, say from T=2 to T=2+max_turns (I'll set max_turns=20, which is more than 9).\n\nNow, let's list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n  Car1: (56,45,right,4) -> \n      span_low(T) = 45 + 4*(T-2)\n      span_high(T) = 56 + 4*(T-2)\n      We need: 45+4*(T-2) <= 0 <= 56+4*(T-2)\n      Solve: \n        45+4*(T-2) <= 0  => 4*(T-2) <= -45 => T-2 <= -45/4 = -11.25 -> never? because T>=2 so T-2>=0.\n      So this car never covers 0.\n\n  Car2: (8,-3,right,4)\n      span_low(T) = -3 + 4*(T-2)\n      span_high(T) = 8 + 4*(T-2)\n      Condition: -3+4*(T-2) <= 0 <= 8+4*(T-2)\n\n      The left inequality: -3+4*(T-2) <=0 -> 4*(T-2) <= 3 -> T-2 <= 0.75 -> T<=2.75 -> so T=2 is the only integer? \n        At T=2: -3+0 = -3 <=0 -> true. And 0<=8 -> true. So at T=2, it covers 0.\n\n      For T=3: low = -3+4=1, high=8+4=12 -> 1<=0? false -> not covered.\n\n      So only T=2.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 2, and we are starting at turn 2 at y=0. We are not on freeway1 at turn 2. So if we go to freeway1 at turn 3 (by moving up at turn2) then we are on freeway1 at turn3? \n\nWait: at turn2: we are at y=0. We choose an action at turn2 that will update our position for turn3.\n\nAt turn2: we are at (0,0). We choose an action a_2. Then at turn3, we are at y_3 = y_2 + Delta = 0 + (if U: +1, D: -1 -> invalid, S:0). \n\nSo we can choose U: then at turn3 we are at y=1.\n\nBut at turn3, we are on freeway1. We must check if freeway1 is safe at turn3.\n\nWe just computed that the second car on freeway1 is unsafe only at T=2? So at T=3, it is safe? \n\nBut what about the first car? We already saw it never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway1 is safe at T=3? \n\nBut wait: what about the first car? We have two cars on freeway1. The first car never covers 0, and the second covers 0 only at T=2. So at T=3, freeway1 is safe.\n\nTherefore, if we move up at turn2, we are at y=1 at turn3 and that is safe.\n\nBut we are not done. We have to go to y=9.\n\nNow, let's do freeway2 (y=2):\n  Car: (0,23,left,24)\n      This is left-moving: \n        span_low(T) = 0 - 24*(T-2)\n        span_high(T) = 23 - 24*(T-2)\n        Condition: 0 - 24*(T-2) <= 0 <= 23 - 24*(T-2)\n\n        The right inequality: 0 <= 23 - 24*(T-2) -> 24*(T-2) <= 23 -> T-2 <= 23/24 < 1 -> so T-2=0 -> T=2.\n\n        At T=2: low = 0, high=23 -> 0 is in [0,23] -> true. So unsafe at T=2.\n\n        For T>=3: \n            T=3: low = 0-24 = -24, high=23-24=-1 -> 0 is not in [-24,-1] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway2 is unsafe only at T=2.\n\nTherefore, if we were to be on freeway2 at turn2, we would crash. But we are not at turn2 on freeway2. We are at y=0 at turn2.\n\nIf we want to be on freeway2 at turn T, we must avoid T=2. But we are starting at turn2, so the next time we can be at freeway2 is at least turn3? which is safe.\n\nNow, freeway3 (y=3):\n  Car: (24,-11,right,36) -> wait, this is right-moving? But note: head=24, tail=-11 -> so tail<=head? \n        Actually, -11<=24, so yes.\n        For right-moving: \n          span_low(T) = tail + 36*(T-2) = -11 + 36*(T-2)\n          span_high(T) = head + 36*(T-2) = 24 + 36*(T-2)\n\n        Condition: -11+36*(T-2) <= 0 <= 24+36*(T-2)\n\n        The left inequality: -11+36*(T-2) <=0 -> 36*(T-2) <=11 -> T-2<=11/36<1 -> so only possible at T=2? \n          At T=2: low = -11, high=24 -> 0 in [-11,24] -> true -> unsafe at T=2.\n\n        The right inequality is always true for T>=2? because 24+36*(T-2) is at least 24>0.\n\n        So unsafe only at T=2? \n\n        Then for T>=3, safe? \n\n        Let T=3: low = -11+36=25, high=24+36=60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway3 is unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway4 (y=4):\n  Car: (-48,-59,right,12) -> wait, head=-48, tail=-59? \n        But for right-moving: the car should have tail<=head? Here, tail=-59, head=-48 -> so tail<=head? yes.\n        Then: \n          span_low(T) = tail + 12*(T-2) = -59+12*(T-2)\n          span_high(T) = head + 12*(T-2) = -48+12*(T-2)\n\n        Condition: -59+12*(T-2) <=0<= -48+12*(T-2)\n\n        First, 0<= -48+12*(T-2) -> 12*(T-2)>=48 -> T-2>=4 -> T>=6.\n        Second, -59+12*(T-2)<=0 -> 12*(T-2)<=59 -> T-2<=59/12≈4.916 -> so T<=6 (since T integer, T-2<=4.916 -> T-2<=4? because 4.916 -> 4,5? but we have integer T)\n\n        Actually: \n          T-2=4: then low=-59+48=-11, high=-48+48=0 -> then 0 is in [-11,0] -> true.\n          T-2=5: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> false.\n\n        So only at T=2+4=6? \n\n        But wait: at T=6: \n          Condition: -59+12*4 = -59+48 = -11 <=0, and 0<= -48+48=0 -> so 0 is included? yes.\n\n        So unsafe at T=6.\n\n        Also, check T=5: \n          low = -59+12*3 = -59+36 = -23, high = -48+36 = -12 -> 0 not in between? -> safe.\n\n        T=7: low = -59+12*5 = -59+60=1, high=-48+60=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway4 is unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway5 (y=5):\n  Same as freeway4: (-48,-59,right,12) -> same as above: unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway6 (y=6):\n  Same: unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway7 (y=7):\n  Car: (24,-11,right,36) -> same as freeway3? \n        At T=2: unsafe? \n        Then for T>=3: safe.\n\n        But wait: freeway3 car was at y=3? This is at y=7. Same parameters? \n        So: \n          Condition: -11+36*(T-2) <=0<=24+36*(T-2)\n          Unsafe at T=2? \n          T=2: -11<=0<=24 -> yes.\n          T=3: 25<=0? no -> safe.\n\n        So freeway7 is unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway8 (y=8):\n  Cars: \n    (56,45,right,4): as in freeway1, we saw never covers 0.\n    (20,9,right,4): \n        span_low(T)=9+4*(T-2)\n        span_high(T)=20+4*(T-2)\n        Condition: 9+4*(T-2)<=0<=20+4*(T-2) -> \n          The left part: 9+4*(T-2)<=0 -> 4*(T-2)<=-9 -> never (since T>=2) -> safe.\n\n    (-16,-27,right,4):\n        span_low(T)=-27+4*(T-2)\n        span_high(T)=-16+4*(T-2)\n        Condition: -27+4*(T-2)<=0<=-16+4*(T-2)\n\n        The right part: 0<=-16+4*(T-2) -> 4*(T-2)>=16 -> T-2>=4 -> T>=6.\n        The left part: -27+4*(T-2)<=0 -> 4*(T-2)<=27 -> T-2<=6.75 -> T<=8.\n\n        So for T from 6 to 8 (T-2 from 4 to 6) we have:\n          T=6: low=-27+16=-11, high=-16+16=0 -> 0 in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n          T=7: low=-27+20=-7, high=-16+20=4 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n          T=8: low=-27+24=-3, high=-16+24=8 -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n          T=9: low=-27+28=1, high=-16+28=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway8 is unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 2: \n  Freeway1: car2 unsafe? but wait: freeway1 at turn2: car2 is unsafe? -> yes, but we are not on freeway1 at turn2? we are at y=0. So we don't care.\n  Freeway2: unsafe\n  Freeway3: unsafe\n  Freeway4: safe (only unsafe at T=6)\n  Freeway5: safe\n  Freeway6: safe\n  Freeway7: unsafe\n  Freeway8: safe (because the unsafe turns for the third car start at T=6)\n\nBut we are at turn2, and we are at y=0. So we are safe.\n\nNow, we plan:\n\nWe start at turn2: y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe can only move up, down, or stay. But at y=0, down is invalid. So we can choose U or S.\n\nIf we choose U: then at turn3 we are at y=1.\n\nIf we choose S: then at turn3 we are still at y=0.\n\nNow, we must check safety when we are on a freeway.\n\nLet's try to go up as much as possible, and see if we can avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe note:\n\nFreeway1 (y=1): unsafe only at T=2 -> so at T>=3, safe? -> yes.\nFreeway2 (y=2): unsafe only at T=2 -> so at T>=3, safe? -> yes.\nFreeway3 (y=3): unsafe only at T=2 -> so at T>=3, safe? -> yes.\nFreeway4 (y=4): unsafe at T=6 -> so avoid being on freeway4 at T=6.\nFreeway5 (y=5): unsafe at T=6 -> avoid at T=6.\nFreeway6 (y=6): unsafe at T=6 -> avoid at T=6.\nFreeway7 (y=7): unsafe only at T=2 -> so at T>=3, safe? -> yes.\nFreeway8 (y=8): unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> so we must avoid being on freeway8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe are going to simulate:\n\nWe start at turn2: y0=0.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we try to go up every turn.\n\nOption 1: always go up.\n\nTurn2: choose U -> then at turn3: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at turn3).\nTurn3: choose U -> at turn4: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 safe at turn4: because unsafe only at turn2).\nTurn4: choose U -> at turn5: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 safe at turn5: unsafe only at turn2).\nTurn5: choose U -> at turn6: y=4 -> but freeway4 is unsafe at turn6 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to freeway4 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y=4 at turn6.\n\nWe can either delay arriving at y=4 until after turn6, or we can wait at y=3 for one turn? or we can go up to y=5 at turn6? but that would require two moves in one turn? no, we can only move one per turn.\n\nAt turn5: we are at y=3. We have several choices:\n\nOption A: Stay at y=3 at turn5? then at turn6 we are still at y=3. Then at turn6 we are on freeway3? which is safe at turn6? (since freeway3 unsafe only at turn2) -> yes, safe. Then at turn6 we are at y=3. Then at turn6 we can move up to y=4 at turn7? but freeway4 at turn7: we computed safe? because unsafe only at turn6 -> so safe. Then we can continue.\n\nBut we are at turn5: if we stay at turn5, then:\n\nTurn5: we start at y=3, choose S -> then at turn6: y=3 (safe) -> then at turn6: choose U -> at turn7: y=4 (safe) -> then at turn7: choose U -> at turn8: y=5 -> but freeway5 is unsafe at turn6? but we are at turn8? so freeway5 at turn8: we computed unsafe only at turn6 -> safe. Then at turn8: choose U -> at turn9: y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at turn6? but turn9 is not 6 -> safe. Then at turn9: choose U -> at turn10: y=7 -> freeway7: unsafe only at turn2 -> safe. Then at turn10: choose U -> at turn11: y=8 -> now we are at freeway8 at turn11? which is safe? because freeway8 is unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> turn11 is beyond 8 -> safe. Then at turn11: choose U -> at turn12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo that took 12-2=10 turns? Actually, we started at turn2 and the last action is at turn11 (which gives y=9 at turn12). But the sequence of actions is from turn2 to turn11: that's 10 actions? \n\nBut wait: H is the number of turns? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning that we take H actions? and then we are at the goal at the next turn? \n\nSpecifically: \n  At turn2 (t1=2) we do a_2 -> then at turn3 we are at y1.\n  Then at turn3 we do a_3 -> then at turn4 we are at y2.\n  ...\n  At turn2+H-1 we do the last action -> then at turn2+H we are at y_{H} = 9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions? and we are done at turn2+H.\n\nIn the above plan: \n  We do an action at turn2, turn3, turn4, turn5, turn6, turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10, turn11 -> 10 actions? so H=10.\n\nBut we can do better? \n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the wait at turn5? \n\nAt turn5: we are at y=3. Instead of staying, we could move down? but that would be counterproductive? \n\nOr we could have waited earlier? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway4 at turn6. So we cannot be at y=4 at turn6. \n\nAnother idea: go faster? but we cannot go faster than one per turn. \n\nOr: at turn5 we go up to y=4? but that is at turn6 -> unsafe. \n\nOr: at turn4: we are at y=2 (if we went up at turn2 and turn3). Then at turn4 we could stay at y=2? then:\n\nTurn4: S -> at turn5: y=2 -> safe? freeway2 safe at turn5 -> yes.\nThen turn5: U -> at turn6: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 safe at turn6).\nThen turn6: U -> at turn7: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 safe at turn7).\nThen turn7: U -> at turn8: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 safe at turn8).\nThen turn8: U -> at turn9: y=6 -> safe (freeway6 safe at turn9).\nThen turn9: U -> at turn10: y=7 -> safe.\nThen turn10: U -> at turn11: y=8 -> but freeway8 unsafe at turn6,7,8 -> turn11 is safe? -> yes, because unsafe only at 6,7,8 -> so safe.\nThen turn11: U -> at turn12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSame 10 actions.\n\nBut wait: we have freeway8 unsafe at T=6,7,8. We are at freeway8 at turn11 -> safe.\n\nBut can we get to y=8 earlier? \n\nWe were at turn5: y=2. Then we went: \n  turn5: U -> turn6: y=3\n  turn6: U -> turn7: y=4\n  turn7: U -> turn8: y=5\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=6\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=7\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=8\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y=9\n\nThat's 10 actions.\n\nBut if we had not waited at turn4? \n\nOriginal without wait: we went to y=3 at turn5. Then we had to wait at turn5 to avoid being at y=4 at turn6. \n\nBut if we don't wait at turn4: we go up at turn4 to y=3 at turn5. Then we have to do something at turn5: if we go up, we are at y=4 at turn6 -> unsafe. So we must wait at turn5? \n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=3 at turn5, then at turn5 we go down? to y=2 at turn6? \n\nThen at turn6: we are at y=2 -> safe? freeway2 safe at turn6 -> yes. \nThen at turn6: we can go up to y=3 at turn7 -> safe.\nThen at turn7: up to y=4 at turn8 -> safe (freeway4 safe at turn8).\nThen at turn8: up to y=5 at turn9 -> safe.\nThen at turn9: up to y=6 at turn10 -> safe.\nThen at turn10: up to y=7 at turn11 -> safe.\nThen at turn11: up to y=8 at turn12 -> but freeway8 unsafe at T=6,7,8? T=12 is safe -> yes.\nThen turn12: up to y=9 at turn13.\n\nThat took 11 actions? (from turn2 to turn12: 11 actions) -> worse.\n\nSo the previous plan (with one wait) is 10 actions.\n\nBut can we avoid the wait by going even faster? \n\nWe started at turn2 at y=0. We did:\n\nTurn2: U -> y=1 at turn3.\nTurn3: U -> y=2 at turn4.\nTurn4: U -> y=3 at turn5.\n\nNow, we are at turn5 at y=3. We want to avoid being at y=4 at turn6.\n\nBut if we could jump? we can't.\n\nAlternatively, we might have delayed earlier? \n\nSuppose at turn2 we did not go up? we stayed at y=0 at turn3.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn2: S -> at turn3: y=0 (safe, since not a freeway).\nTurn3: U -> at turn4: y=1 (freeway1: safe at turn4? yes) -> safe.\nTurn4: U -> at turn5: y=2 (safe) -> turn5: y=2.\nTurn5: U -> at turn6: y=3 (safe) -> turn6: y=3.\nTurn6: U -> at turn7: y=4 (freeway4: safe at turn7) -> safe.\nTurn7: U -> at turn8: y=5 (freeway5: safe at turn8) -> safe.\nTurn8: U -> at turn9: y=6 (freeway6: safe at turn9) -> safe.\nTurn9: U -> at turn10: y=7 (safe) -> turn10: y=7.\nTurn10: U -> at turn11: y=8 (freeway8: at turn11 -> safe) -> safe.\nTurn11: U -> at turn12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nThat is also 10 actions? (actions at turn2,3,...,11 -> 10 actions).\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we started with a stay? \n\nBut we can try to go without any stay? \n\nWe must avoid being at y=4,5,6 at turn6? and y=8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nBut note: we start at y=0 at turn2. We can only get to y=4 at turn6 if we go up every turn: \n  turn2->3: 0->1\n  turn3->4: 1->2\n  turn4->5: 2->3\n  turn5->6: 3->4\n\nSo we are at y=4 at turn6 -> unsafe.\n\nTo avoid that, we must not be at y=4 at turn6. We can be at y=3 at turn6 (by staying at turn5) or at y=2 at turn6 (by staying at turn4) or even lower.\n\nBut then we have to make up for the lost move.\n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 in 9 actions? \n\nWe start at turn2, do 9 actions: then at turn11 we are at y=9? \n\nBut to get from 0 to 9 we need 9 moves up? so we must do 9 U's without any down or stay? \n\nBut then we are at:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y=1\nTurn3: U -> turn4: y=2\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y=3\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y=4 -> unsafe at freeway4 at turn6 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot do 9 consecutive U's.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is at least 10.\n\nNow, we have two plans that take 10 actions.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeway8 at turns 6,7,8. In the above plans we are at freeway8 at turn11 or turn12? which is safe.\n\nBut what if we can get to freeway8 earlier? \n\nIn the first plan (with wait at turn5) we are at:\n\nturn2: U -> y1 at turn3\nturn3: U -> y2 at turn4\nturn4: U -> y3 at turn5\nturn5: S -> y3 at turn6   [wait]\nturn6: U -> y4 at turn7\nturn7: U -> y5 at turn8\nturn8: U -> y6 at turn9\nturn9: U -> y7 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y8 at turn11\nturn11: U -> y9 at turn12\n\nSo we are at freeway8 (y8) at turn11 -> safe.\n\nIn the second plan (with initial stay at turn2):\n\nturn2: S -> y0 at turn3\nturn3: U -> y1 at turn4\nturn4: U -> y2 at turn5\nturn5: U -> y3 at turn6\nturn6: U -> y4 at turn7\nturn7: U -> y5 at turn8\nturn8: U -> y6 at turn9\nturn9: U -> y7 at turn10\nturn10: U -> y8 at turn11\nturn11: U -> y9 at turn12\n\nSame: at turn11 we are at y8 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway5 and freeway6 at turn6? they are unsafe at turn6. In the second plan: at turn6 we are at y3? so freeway3 at turn6: safe. Then at turn7: y4 -> freeway4 safe at turn7? yes. Then at turn8: y5 -> freeway5 safe at turn8? yes. So that's safe.\n\nBut what about the first plan? at turn6 we are at y3 -> safe. Then turn7: y4 -> freeway4 safe? because unsafe only at turn6 -> safe. Then turn8: y5 -> safe.\n\nSo both plans are safe.\n\nBut we want minimal H. Both are H=10.\n\nIs there a plan with H=9? We saw that 9 consecutive U's leads to crash at turn6. \n\nWhat if we do 9 U's but skip one? we can't skip because we need 9 moves. \n\nAlternatively, we might do a down move? but that would require even more moves.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nNow, we have two sequences. We can choose either.\n\nBut let me check if we can get to y=9 in 10 actions without the initial stay? \n\nThe first plan: we did not stay at the beginning, but we stayed at turn5.\n\nWe can output the first plan:\n\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: S   [wait at y=3 to avoid being at y=4 at turn6]\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\n\nBut wait: from y=3 at turn5 (after S) we are at y=3 at turn6. Then we do U at turn6 -> to y4 at turn7. Then we do U at turn7 -> y5 at turn8, then U at turn8 -> y6 at turn9, then U at turn9 -> y7 at turn10, then U at turn10 -> y8 at turn11, then U at turn11 -> y9 at turn12.\n\nSo we have 10 actions: from turn2 to turn11.\n\nBut the last action (at turn11) is the 10th action? and then we are at y9 at turn12.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sequence of actions: {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1} with t1=2.\n\nSo t1+t: t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo:\n\na_{2+0} = a2\na_{2+1} = a3\n...\na_{2+9} = a11\n\nWe have 10 actions.\n\nBut we must write the actions for turns: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: S\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\n\nBut wait: after the action at turn11, we are at y9 at turn12. So it meets the goal.\n\nBut we must check freeway8 at turn11: we are at y8 at turn11? so we must check freeway8 at turn11: we computed freeway8 unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> turn11 is safe.\n\nAnd we checked the others: freeway4 at turn7: safe, freeway5 at turn8: safe, freeway6 at turn9: safe.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at turn10? we are at y7 at turn10: freeway7 is unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could do the second plan: starting with a stay.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both are 10. So we can choose any.\n\nBut note: we might have a plan that takes 10 actions but gets to y9 earlier? no, because we start at turn2 and the last action is at turn11, then we are at y9 at turn12.\n\nWe cannot get to y9 before turn12? because we start at turn2 at y0, and we need 9 moves up? so the earliest we can be at y9 is at turn2+9 = turn11? but that would require 9 moves and no wait? which we cannot do because of the crash.\n\nSo turn12 is the earliest.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n\nBut we must be cautious: are there any other constraints?\n\nOne more: freeway8 has three cars. We checked the one that causes the problem (the third car) and it is unsafe at 6,7,8. The others are safe.\n\nAnd we are not on freeway8 at those unsafe turns.\n\nNow, let me write the answer.\n\nWe choose the first plan (without initial stay) because it starts moving immediately.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait: after turn5 we are at y3 at turn6. Then we do 6 U's: from turn6 to turn11: that's 6 actions? so we move from y3 to y9? that would be 6 moves: 3->9: 6 moves? yes.\n\nBut let me count the y at each turn:\n\nTurn2: start at y0.\nTurn2: action U -> turn3: y1.\nTurn3: action U -> turn4: y2.\nTurn4: action U -> turn5: y3.\nTurn5: action S -> turn6: y3.\nTurn6: action U -> turn7: y4.\nTurn7: action U -> turn8: y5.\nTurn8: action U -> turn9: y6.\nTurn9: action U -> turn10: y7.\nTurn10: action U -> turn11: y8.\nTurn11: action U -> turn12: y9.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can try the other plan:\n\nTurn2: S -> turn3: y0.\nTurn3: U -> turn4: y1.\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y2.\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y3.\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y4.\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y5.\nTurn8: U -> turn9: y6.\nTurn9: U -> turn10: y7.\nTurn10: U -> turn11: y8.\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y9.\n\nThat also works.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H? both have H=10.\n\nBut note: we might have a plan that gets to y9 in 10 actions but with a different sequence? \n\nHowever, we must avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut is there a plan that uses only 10 actions and avoids the unsafe freeways without waiting? \n\nFor instance, can we go up to y=8 earlier? \n\nBut to get to y=8 at turn T, we need T>=2+8=10? because we start at y0 at turn2, and we need 8 moves? so at turn10 we can be at y8? \n\nBut then we do the 9th move at turn10 to go to y9 at turn11? \n\nBut wait: that would be 9 moves? so H=9? \n\nBut we start at turn2: \n  Turn2: U -> turn3: y1\n  Turn3: U -> turn4: y2\n  Turn4: U -> turn5: y3\n  Turn5: U -> turn6: y4 -> unsafe at turn6? because freeway4 unsafe at turn6 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y4 at turn6.\n\nBut if we want to be at y8 at turn10, we must be at y4 at turn6? because:\n\nturn2: y0\nturn3: y1\nturn4: y2\nturn5: y3\nturn6: y4 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we have to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we must have at least one non-up move to avoid being at y4 at turn6.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nWe output one of the sequences.\n\nI'll choose the first one that starts with up moves.\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious about freeway8: we are at y8 at turn11 -> safe.\n\nIn the second plan we are at y8 at turn11 as well? yes.\n\nBut the first plan has a wait at turn5, while the second has a wait at turn2. \n\nBut the problem does not specify a preference, so either is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if we can do a wait at a different place? \n\nFor example, we could do:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y1\nTurn3: U -> turn4: y2\nTurn4: S -> turn5: y2   [wait at turn4 at y2?]\nThen:\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y3 -> safe (freeway3 safe at turn6)\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y4 -> safe (freeway4 safe at turn7)\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y5 -> safe\nTurn8: U -> turn9: y6 -> safe\nTurn9: U -> turn10: y7 -> safe\nTurn10: U -> turn11: y8 -> safe (freeway8 safe at turn11? yes, because unsafe only at 6,7,8)\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y9.\n\nThat is also 10 actions? and same as before.\n\nBut now we waited at turn4? \n\nIs there a difference? \n\nIn terms of H, same.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nI'll choose the one that waits at turn5? or turn4? \n\nBut note: freeway2 is safe at turn5? yes. So waiting at y2 at turn4 is safe.\n\nBut why did I not consider that? \n\nActually, we have multiple possibilities.\n\nWe can output:\n\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: S   [wait at y2?]\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\n\nThis also works.\n\nBut at turn4: we are at y2 at turn4? then we do S at turn4: so we are still at y2 at turn5? \nThen at turn5: we do U: to y3 at turn6 -> safe.\n\nThen we go up every turn until turn11: then at turn11: we do the last U to y9 at turn12.\n\nBut we have to check freeway8 at turn11: we are at y8 at turn11? and freeway8 unsafe only at 6,7,8 -> turn11 is safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, which one to choose? \n\nSince the problem does not specify, we can choose the one that waits as late as possible? or as early as possible? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway4,5,6 at turn6? by being below y4 at turn6. \n\nIn the above plan: at turn6 we are at y3 (because we went from y2 at turn5 to y3 at turn6) -> safe.\n\nBut we could also wait at turn3? \n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y1\nTurn3: S -> turn4: y1\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y2\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y3 -> safe\n... then same.\n\nBut that also works.\n\nBut we want minimal H? they are all 10.\n\nSo I'll pick the one that waits at turn5? because we went as far as we could before the obstacle.\n\nBut that is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid waiting by taking a detour? but we cannot move horizontally.\n\nBut note: we could move down? but that would require extra moves.\n\nSo we choose the sequence with a wait at turn5.\n\nTherefore:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut let me write it in the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nt1=2.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nThat's 10 lines.\n\nBut wait: the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to 9 (H=10) for turns 2+0 to 2+9 = 2 to 11.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, let me check the safety for the entire path:\n\nTurn2: at y0 (safe, not a freeway)\nTurn3: at y1 -> freeway1: at turn3? safe (we checked: unsafe only at turn2) -> safe.\nTurn4: at y2 -> freeway2 at turn4: unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\nTurn5: at y3 -> freeway3 at turn5: unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\nTurn6: at y3 -> freeway3 at turn6: safe? yes, because unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\nTurn7: at y4 -> freeway4 at turn7: unsafe at turn6? so at turn7: safe? yes.\nTurn8: at y5 -> freeway5 at turn8: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\nTurn9: at y6 -> freeway6 at turn9: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\nTurn10: at y7 -> freeway7 at turn10: unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\nTurn11: at y8 -> freeway8 at turn11: unsafe at 6,7,8 -> turn11 is 11>8 -> safe.\nTurn12: at y9 -> goal, no freeway.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 3\\) on turn 5 to avoid being on freeway \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6, where freeways 4, 5, and 6 are unsafe. Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8, but the player reaches \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11, which is safe. The sequence ensures the player moves up as much as possible while avoiding unsafe turns.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 2, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn 2).\n- At turn 3, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 2).\n- At turn 4, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 2).\n- At turn 5, stay at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 2; avoids being at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6).\n- At turn 6, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 is unsafe only at turn 6, and the player arrives at turn 7).\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 8, move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn 2).\n- At turn 10, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turns 6, 7, and 8; turn 10 is safe).\n- At turn 11, move up to \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t=3. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. Collisions happen only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, given head, tail, direction, and speed, I can compute where it is at any future turn.\n\nThe key point is that collision is checked only when the player is on a freeway. If the player moves to a new freeway at turn T, they are not on that new freeway until turn T+1. So, for example, if at turn T, the player moves from y to y+1, then at turn T, they are still on y, and at turn T+1, they are on y+1.\n\nCollision at turn T only if player is on freeway k at turn T, and for that k, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, since the player starts at y=1, and needs to get to y=9, they need to move up through y=2 to y=8.\n\ny=1 to y=8 are the freeways with cars. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=9 is the goal, so once reached, no need to worry about cars there, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so at that point, if it's reached, and since there are no cars on y=9 (freeways are only y=1 to 8), it should be fine.\n\nNow, current turn is t=3, player at (0,1).\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=1 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=3, since that's the current state.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\n- First car: head 60, tail 49, direction right, speed 4. Since direction is right, head is larger, so span is [τ, h] = [49,60]? No.\n\nDirection: for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], and for left-moving, [h, τ] with h being the head.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving (d=right), span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, with tail left, head right, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, d=left, span [h, τ] with head left, tail right? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (60, 49, right, 4) and (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head 60, tail 49, right. Since right, head should be larger, so span at t1=3 is [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAs time increases, τ and h both increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head 12, tail 1, right, so span [1,12] at t=3.\n\nNow, collision if at some turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to check if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFor freeway 1 at turn t=3:\n\nCar 1: span [49,60], which is far right, 49 to 60, so 0 not in [49,60]\n\nCar 2: span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12] since 1>0? [1,12] from 1 to 12, 0<1, so not included. Assuming the span includes integers, so x=0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut I need for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their span evolution.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3.\n\nFor any future turn T, span is computed as above.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 3\n\nFor each car:\n\nFreeway 1:\n\nCar A: right, s=4, head=60, tail=49 → at T, span [49 + 4Δt, 60 + 4Δt]\n\nCar B: right, s=4, head=12, tail=1 → at T, span [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so head h=-24, tail τ=-1? The pair is (head, tail) = (-24, -1)\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, -1] since h is head, which for left is the leftmost point.\n\nUpdate: span(T) = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [-24 -24Δt, -1 -24Δt]\n\ns=24, Δt = T-3\n\nFreeway 3: (60, 25, right, 36)\n\nRight, so head=60, tail=25, span(t1)= [25,60]? [τ,h] = [25,60]\n\nAt T: [25 + 36Δt, 60 + 36Δt]\n\nFreeway 4: (-36, -47, right, 12)  // direction right? But head=-36, tail=-47, if right, head should be larger, but -36 > -47, yes, -36 is larger than -47.\n\nSo tail τ=-47, head h=-36, so span [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt T: [-47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (-36, -47, right, 12) identical.\n\nFreeway 6: also (-36, -47, right, 12) same.\n\nFreeway 7: (60, 25, right, 36) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars: (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nFirst car: similar to freeway1 car A, but head=60,tail=49,right,s=4, span [49+4Δt, 60+4Δt]\n\nSecond car: head=24,tail=13,right,s=4, span [13+4Δt, 24+4Δt]\n\nThird car: head=-12,tail=-23? Head=-12, tail=-23, since -12 > -23, so tail τ=-23, head h=-12, span [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T: [-23 +4Δt, -12 +4Δt]\n\nNow, for each freeway k, and for each turn T, I need to know if x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nThen, if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is covered, collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at t=3.\n\nTo reach y=9, min turns, since moving up each turn can take 8 turns (from y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so at least 8 turns if always up, but may need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\ny=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, but we start at turn t=3, and we need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T, so the number of actions from t=3 to T-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=3, position is (0,1). Then we choose action a_3, which determines y_4, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=3+H, position y_{3+H}.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} = 9 for some H, and min H.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=3 to t=3+H-1, I think.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t), we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_t, x=0 is covered at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=3, player is on y=1, so we need to check if at t=3, on freeway 1, is x=0 covered?\n\nFreeway 1 at t=3:\n\nCar A: span [49,60], 0 not in\n\nCar B: span [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0\n\nSo safe at t=3.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we want min turns, probably we should go up as much as possible, unless blocked.\n\nBut we need to check for each freeway when it is dangerous, i.e., when x=0 is covered.\n\nSo let's find for each freeway k, the times T when x=0 is covered by some car on k.\n\nThat is, for each car on k, find if and when 0 is in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, for each k, we need the union over cars of the times when 0 in span.\n\nThen, for that k, it is dangerous at those T.\n\nThen, player should not be on k at those T.\n\nSince player moves one y per turn, we need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the dangerous times.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: A and B\n\nCar A: span at T: [49 + 4(T-3), 60 + 4(T-3)] = [49 + 4Δt, 60 + 4Δt] with Δt = T-3\n\n0 in this span if 49 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 60 + 4Δt\n\nBut since 49 + 4Δt >= 49 > 0 for all T>=3, so 0 < 49 + 4Δt always, so 0 not in [49+4Δt, 60+4Δt] for any T.\n\nSimilarly, car B: span [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in this if 1 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 4Δt\n\nBut 1 + 4Δt >=1 >0 for T>=3, so 0 < 1+4Δt, so never true.\n\nThus, for freeway 1, no car covers x=0 at any time T>=3. So y=1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nAt t=3, car B span [1,12], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAs T increases, both spans move right, so x=0 never covered. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): only one car: left, s=24, head=-24, tail=-1? Earlier: (head, tail) = (-24, -1), left direction.\n\nSpan at t1=3: [h, τ] = [-24, -1] since left, head is left.\n\nAt T: [ -24 -24Δt, -1 -24Δt ] with Δt = T-3\n\n0 in span if -24 -24Δt <= 0 <= -1 -24Δt\n\nSince the span is from left to right, decreasing.\n\nSo 0 <= -1 -24Δt ? But -1 -24Δt <= -1 <0, so 0 > upper bound, and lower bound -24-24Δt <0, but since upper bound <0, 0 not <= upper bound, so 0 not in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for all T, since the car is moving left, and at t=3 it's from -24 to -1, all negative, and moving left, so x=0 never covered.\n\nThus freeway 2 always safe.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): car: right, s=36, head=60, tail=25, span at T: [25 + 36Δt, 60 + 36Δt]\n\n25 + 36Δt >=25>0, so 0 not in, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): car: right, s=12, head=-36? head=-36, tail=-47, right direction.\n\nSpan [τ,h] = [-47, -36] at t=3? [τ,h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [-47 +12Δt, -36 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12Δt <= 0 <= -36 +12Δt\n\nBut -36 +12Δt <=0 only if 12Δt <=36, Δt <=3\n\nAnd -47 +12Δt <=0 always for Δt >=4 since -47+48=1>0, but let's solve inequalities.\n\nLower bound L = -47 +12Δt\n\nUpper bound U = -36 +12Δt\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <= 0 <= U\n\nSo L <=0 and U >=0\n\nL <=0: -47 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/12 = 3.916, so since Δt integer, Δt <=3\n\nU >=0: -36 +12Δt >=0 => 12Δt >=36 => Δt >=3\n\nSo for Δt=3, L= -47+36= -11, U= -36+36=0\n\nU=0, so 0 <= U, and L= -11 <=0, so yes, 0 is in [L,U] if U=0 included.\n\nAssuming the span includes the endpoints, so x=0 is covered when U=0.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt=3, T= t1 + Δt =3+3=6\n\nAt T=6, U=0, so x=0 covered.\n\nNow for other Δt.\n\nΔt >=3: U >=0 only if Δt >=3\n\nL <=0 only if Δt <=3, since at Δt=4, L= -47+48=1>0, so L>0, U>0, 0 not <= U? U= -36+48=12>0, but 0 < L since L=1>0, so not in.\n\nAt Δt=3: L= -47+36= -11 <=0, U= -36+36=0, so 0 <= U and 0 >= L, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nYes.\n\nAt Δt=2: L= -47+24= -23, U= -36+24= -12, both negative, U= -12<0, so 0 not <= U.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=1: L=-35, U=-24, both <0.\n\nΔt=0: L=-47,U=-36<0.\n\nSo only at Δt=3, T=6, x=0 covered on freeway 4.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as freeway 4, since identical car, so same, dangerous only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: also same, dangerous at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): same as freeway 3, car (60,25,right,36), span [25+36Δt,60+36Δt] all positive, never covers 0, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): three cars.\n\nCar A: (60,49,right,4) span [49+4Δt,60+4Δt] all large positive, never covers 0.\n\nCar B: (24,13,right,4) span [13+4Δt,24+4Δt] all >=13>0, never covers 0.\n\nCar C: (-12,-23,right,4) head=-12, tail=-23, right direction, so τ=-23, h=-12, span [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t=3? [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T: [-23 +4Δt, -12 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -23 +4Δt <= 0 <= -12 +4Δt\n\nSo L = -23 +4Δt <=0 and U = -12 +4Δt >=0\n\nL <=0: -23 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=23 => Δt <= 23/4 = 5.75, so Δt <=5\n\nU >=0: -12 +4Δt >=0 => 4Δt >=12 => Δt >=3\n\nSo for Δt=3,4,5\n\nAt Δt=3: L= -23+12= -11, U= -12+12=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nAt Δt=4: L= -23+16= -7, U= -12+16=4, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nAt Δt=5: L= -23+20= -3, U= -12+20=8, 0 in [-3,8]\n\nAt Δt=6: L= -23+24=1>0, U= -12+24=12>0, 0<L, not in.\n\nΔt=2: L=-19<0, U=-8<0, not.\n\nSo on freeway 8, dangerous when T=3+3=6, T=3+4=7, T=3+5=8? Δt=3,4,5 so T=6,7,8.\n\nT= t1 + Δt =3 + Δt\n\nSo dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe (freeway 3)\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=6\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=6 (same as y=4)\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=6 (same)\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=6,7,8\n\ny=4,5,6 all dangerous only at T=6? y=4,5,6 each have a car that covers x=0 at T=6.\n\nBut y=5 and y=6 are separate freeways.\n\nFor y=5, freeway 5 has the same car as y=4, so dangerous at T=6.\n\nSimilarly y=6 dangerous at T=6.\n\nAnd y=8 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, player starts at t=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's safe once reached.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps up, but we may need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- At T=6: y=4,5,6 are dangerous\n\n- Also y=8 dangerous at T=6,7,8\n\nBut y=8 is dangerous from T=6 to 8.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nPlayer position y_t at turn t.\n\nAt t=3, y=1, safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,or +1.\n\nMin steps: if always up, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves: after 8 actions, y_{11} =9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter action a_3, at turn t=4, y= y_3 + Δy_3\n\nSimilarly, after a_4, at t=5, y= y_4 + Δy_4, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=3+H, with y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe position at each turn t is y_t, for t=3,4,5,... up to some T where y_T=9.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and dangerous at that t.\n\nSince we start at t=3, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous turns are only t=6 for y=4,5,6; and t=6,7,8 for y=8.\n\nOther times and other freeways are safe.\n\ny=1,2,3,7 are always safe.\n\ny=4,5,6 dangerous only at t=6.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nWe need to ensure that at turn t=6, if player is on y=4,5, or 6, collision, similarly at t=7 or 8 if on y=8.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince from y=1 to y=9, min 8 up moves, but we might need to delay or something to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, if we go straight up:\n\nStart t=3, y=1\n\na_3: U, then t=4, y=2\n\na_4: U, t=5, y=3\n\na_5: U, t=6, y=4\n\nBut at t=6, y=4 is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf at a_5 we do S, stay, then at t=5, y=3 (safe), a_5=S, then t=6, y=3 still? After a_5 at turn t=5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, if a_5=S, then y_6=3.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=6, since always safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y=3, we can go up, a_6: U, to y=4 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=4. Now y=4 is only dangerous at t=6, not at other times. Since dangerous only at t=6, so at t=7, y=4 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=5 at t=8, y=6 at t=9, etc.\n\nBut we have y=8 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nLet's list the sequence.\n\nt=3: y=1, safe\n\na_3: U, to y=2 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=2, safe\n\na_4: U, to y=3 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=3, safe\n\nNow, at t=5, if we go up, a_5: U, to y=4 at t=6\n\nBut at t=6, y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we stay, a_5: S, then y_6 = y_5 + 0 = 3, so at t=6, y=3, safe (since y=3 always safe)\n\nThen at t=6, we can go up, a_6: U, to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=4, now is y=4 dangerous at t=7? Earlier, for y=4, only dangerous at t=6, not at t=7. So should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_7: U, to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=5, dangerous? y=5 dangerous only at t=6, not t=8, so safe.\n\na_8: U, to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=6, dangerous only at t=6, not t=9, safe.\n\na_9: U, to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=7, always safe.\n\na_10: U, to y=8 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=8, now y=8 dangerous at t=6,7,8. t=11 >8, so should be safe? Dangerous only at T=6,7,8, which are turns 6,7,8.\n\nt=11 is later, so not dangerous.\n\nThen a_11: U, to y=9 at t=12\n\nAt t=12, y=9, reached, and no cars on y=9, so safe.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=3 to t=11, actions a_3 to a_11, that's 9 actions? Turns: start at t=3.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=3.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_3), at t=4.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=3+k.\n\nWe reach y=9 at t=12, so after 9 actions? t=3+k=12, so k=9 actions.\n\nBut min possible is 8 actions to go up 8 steps.\n\nIn this sequence, we stayed at t=5, so we delayed one turn.\n\nt=3: y=1\n\na_3: U → t=4 y=2\n\na_4: U → t=5 y=3\n\na_5: S → t=6 y=3 (since S, no change)\n\na_6: U → t=7 y=4\n\na_7: U → t=8 y=5\n\na_8: U → t=9 y=6\n\na_9: U → t=10 y=7\n\na_10: U → t=11 y=8\n\na_11: U → t=12 y=9\n\nYes, 9 actions: a_3 to a_11.\n\nBut we could go faster?\n\nSince y=4,5,6 are only dangerous at t=6, we could be on them before or after, but not at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 dangerous at t=6,7,8, so we need to avoid y=8 at those times.\n\nIn the above, we were on y=8 at t=11, which is after t=8, so safe.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster to y=7 or something.\n\ny=7 is always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=8.\n\ny=8 is dangerous from t=6 to t=8.\n\nt=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at t=5, if we are on y=3, we could go up to y=4 at t=6, but that's dangerous.\n\nWe could go down or something, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=1,2,3,7 are safe always, we can be there anytime.\n\nBut we need to cross y=4,5,6 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=4,5,6, safe except at t=6.\n\nFor y=8, safe except at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, the critical time is t=6.\n\nIf we can be on a safe freeway at t=6, like y=1,2,3,7.\n\ny=7 might be far.\n\nAt t=5, we can be on y=3 (if we went up directly).\n\nFrom t=3: a_3 U to y=2 at t=4\n\na_4 U to y=3 at t=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=3.\n\nInstead of staying, we could go down? But that might waste moves.\n\nFor example, a_5: D to y=2 at t=6\n\nThen at t=6, y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=6, we can go up, a_6: U to y=3 at t=7\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=6, to y=9, need 7 more up moves, so to t=13 y=9, worse than before.\n\nNot better.\n\nStay at y=3 at t=5, then at t=6 y=3, then go up.\n\nBut at t=6, we are on y=3, safe, then we go to y=4 at t=7, which is safe for y=4.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps we can reach y=8 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\ny=8 is dangerous only from t=6 to t=8.\n\nSo if we can be on y=8 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=4,5,6, only dangerous at t=6, so before or after is fine.\n\nNow, at t=3, y=1.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible: a_3 U to y=2 t=4\n\na_4 U to y=3 t=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=3, if we go up to y=4 at t=6, but t=6 y=4 dangerous.\n\nBut t=6 is too early for y=8.\n\nWe need to reach y=8 by t=5 or earlier, or after t=8.\n\nt=5: what y can we be at?\n\nStart t=3 y=1\n\nAfter one action a_3, t=4 y=2 (if U)\n\nAfter two actions, t=5 y=3 (if U)\n\ny=3 at t=5.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=5, we need to have moved up 5 steps in 2 actions? From y=1 to y=8 is 7 steps up, but we have only 2 actions from t=3 to t=5? Actions at t=3 and t=4 affect position at t=4 and t=5.\n\nAt t=3, after a_3, y_4.\n\nAt t=4, after a_4, y_5.\n\nSo at t=5, y_5 <= y_3 + 2 =1+2=3, since max up twice. So y_5=3 at best.\n\nCannot be higher than 3 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, if we go up from t=5, y_6 <=4.\n\nBut y=4 at t=6 dangerous.\n\nWe can be at y=3 at t=6, as before.\n\nNow, to be on y=8 after t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=9 or later.\n\nBut we need to get there.\n\nSince y=7 is safe, we can go to y=7 and stay if needed, but let's see the sequence with min delay.\n\nIn the first sequence, we used 9 turns to reach at t=12.\n\nBut min possible is 8 turns, reaching at t=11.\n\nCan we reach at t=11?\n\nThat means y_{11}=9.\n\nSo at t=11, y=9.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at some point before.\n\ny_{10} must be 8, since to go to y=9, from y=8 with U action.\n\ny_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}, set to 9, so y_{10} must be 8 and Δy_{10}=U.\n\nSimilarly, y_{10} must be reached.\n\nNow, y_{10} could be 7,8, or 9, but since we want to reach 9, probably from 8.\n\nNow, at t=10, if y_{10}=8, then we go U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut y=8 at t=10: t=10, which is after t=8, so not dangerous, since dangerous only up to t=8.\n\nt=10 >8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to have y_{10}=8.\n\nNow, how to get to y=8 at t=10.\n\nFrom start, in 7 actions? From t=3 to t=10, that's 7 steps? Positions: t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, that's 7 turns after start, but actions from t=3 to t=9 determine positions up to t=10.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nTime: turn t, position y_t.\n\nActions: a_t for t=3,4,5,... up to some.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_{10} =8, we need actions from t=3 to t=9, 7 actions.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nBut y_9 depends on previous.\n\nThe net displacement from y_3=1 to y_{10} must be +7 to reach y=8, since 1+7=8.\n\nIn 7 actions (from t=3 to t=9), the sum of Δy must be +7.\n\nEach action Δy in {-1,0,1}, so min actions to go up 7 steps is 7 actions, all U.\n\nBut we may have to avoid dangerous positions.\n\nNow, at which turns we might have issues.\n\nSpecifically, we need to avoid being on y=4,5,6 at t=6.\n\nAnd avoid being on y=8 at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, t=6 is a critical point.\n\nAt t=6, we cannot be on y=4,5,6 or y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=6 is already covered, but separately.\n\nFreeways to avoid at t=6: y=4,5,6,8.\n\nSafe at t=6: y=1,2,3,7.\n\nSimilarly for t=7: at t=7, y=8 is dangerous, and y=4,5,6 are safe except at t=6, so at t=7 safe.\n\ny=4,5,6 dangerous only at t=6, so at t=7 safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=7.\n\nSo at t=7, dangerous if on y=8.\n\nSimilarly t=8, dangerous if on y=8.\n\nt=9 and later, all safe except possibly others, but no.\n\nNow, back to reaching y=8 at t=10.\n\ny_{10}=8.\n\nWe need to plan the path from t=3 to t=10.\n\ny_3=1\n\nAfter actions a_3 to a_9, y_{10} is set.\n\nNumber of actions: a_3 to a_9, 7 actions.\n\nNet Δy sum must be +7 to go from y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo all actions must be U, no S or D, because if any S or D, we need extra U to compensate, but since min steps, probably all U.\n\nBut we need to avoid the dangerous positions at specific times.\n\nSpecifically, at t=6, we need y_6 not in {4,5,6,8}\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, y_7 not in {8} (since y=4,5,6 safe at t=7)\n\nAt t=8, y_8 not in {8}\n\nNow, with all U actions:\n\nStart t=3 y=1\n\na_3 U: t=4 y=2\n\na_4 U: t=5 y=3\n\na_5 U: t=6 y=4 → but y=4 at t=6 dangerous! Collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we do something else.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay or go down to avoid being at wrong place at t=6.\n\nBut with all U, we are at y=4 at t=6.\n\nTo not be at y=4,5,6 at t=6, we need to be elsewhere.\n\nPossible safe y at t=6: y=1,2,3,7.\n\ny=7 at t=6: can we be at y=7 at t=6?\n\nFrom y=1 at t=3, to y=7 at t=6.\n\nt=6 - t=3 = 3 turns, from y=1 to y=7, need +6, but in 3 actions? Actions affect next position.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=6: positions t=4,5,6 depend on actions at t=3,4,5.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nSo in three actions, max increase is +3, so y_6 <= 1+3=4, cannot reach y=7.\n\ny_6 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, min y_6=1-3= -2, but y>=0, so possible y_6 from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, at t=6, safe y: 1,2,3 (since y=4 is dangerous, and y=0 or y=5+ not possible)\n\ny=0 is possible? y in [0,9], but at y=0, no freeway, so no collision? The collision only for y=1 to 8.\n\nIf y_t=0 or y_t=9, no car, so safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so y=0 might be a detour.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nAt t=6, y_6 could be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=4 dangerous, so for safety, y_6 must be in {0,1,2,3}\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=8 at t=10.\n\nNow, from y_6 to y_{10}, in 4 actions (a_6 to a_9), positions t=7,8,9,10.\n\ny_{10} = y_6 + sum_{i=6 to 9} Δy_i\n\nWe want y_{10}=8.\n\ny_6 <=3, as above.\n\nSo y_{10} = y_6 + S, where S is the sum of 4 Δy, each in {-1,0,1}, so S <=4, S >= -4.\n\ny_{10} = y_6 + S =8.\n\nSince y_6 <=3, S must be at least 5, but S <=4, contradiction.\n\ny_6 <=3, S <=4, so y_{10} <= 3+4=7 <8.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at t=10 if y_6 <=3.\n\ny_6 max is 4, but if y_6=4, it is dangerous at t=6, collision.\n\nSo we must have y_6 <=3 to avoid collision.\n\nBut then y_{10} <= y_6 +4 <=3+4=7 <8.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=8 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 at t=11 with min 8 actions.\n\nWe need more actions.\n\nThe earliest possible is to reach at t=12, as in the first sequence.\n\nBut in that sequence, we reached at t=12 with 9 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier with different path.\n\nt=12 is after 9 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at t=11 with y=9.\n\ny_{11}=9.\n\nThen y_{10} must be 8 and a_{10}=U.\n\ny_{10}=8 at t=10.\n\nt=10 >8, so y=8 safe.\n\nNow, need y_{10}=8.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nTo have y_{10}=8, if y_9=7, then Δy_9=U; if y_9=8, Δy_9=S or something, but we can have from y_9=7 with U.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 depends.\n\nNow, from start to y_{10}=8.\n\nNumber of actions to determine y_{10}: actions from t=3 to t=9, 7 actions.\n\ny_{10} = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 9} Δy_t = 1 + S, where S is sum of 7 Δy_t.\n\nWe want y_{10}=8, so 1+S=8, S=7, so all actions must be U, no exception.\n\nBecause if any S or D, S<7, y_{10}<8.\n\nSo must have all a_t = U for t=3 to 9.\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=3: y=1\n\na_3 U: t=4 y=2\n\na_4 U: t=5 y=3\n\na_5 U: t=6 y=4 → dangerous! Collision at t=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we have a delay earlier, but with all U, we have to be at y=4 at t=6.\n\nBut we cannot avoid it with all U.\n\nSo impossible to reach at t=11.\n\nThus, min reach at t=12 with 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence I had, we had a S at t=5, so not all U.\n\nNow, can we reach at t=12 with fewer than 9 actions? 9 actions to reach at t=12.\n\nt=12 after 9 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at t=12 with a different path, but still 9 actions min since 8 not possible.\n\nAnother way: perhaps go to y=0 or something to avoid.\n\nFor example, at some point go down to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but it might waste moves.\n\nFor instance, at t=5, y=3, instead of staying, go down to y=2 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, y=2 safe.\n\nThen go up to y=3 at t=7, etc., but then we are behind, and it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first sequence seems efficient: stay at y=3 for one turn to avoid t=6 on y=4.\n\nIn that sequence, we were on y=8 at t=11, which is safe.\n\nBut y=8 dangerous only up to t=8, t=11>8.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at t=11 y=8, then go to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut we can be on y=8 earlier, but y=8 dangerous from t=6 to t=8.\n\nSo at t=9, for example.\n\nt=9: if we can be on y=8 at t=9, which is after t=8, safe.\n\nThen go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nReach at t=10? y_{10}=9.\n\nt=10.\n\nNow, need y_{10}=9.\n\nSo y_9 must be 8 and a_9=U.\n\ny_9=8 at t=9.\n\nt=9>8, safe.\n\nNow, need to reach y_9=8 at t=9.\n\nFrom start, with actions a_3 to a_8, 6 actions.\n\ny_9 = y_3 + sum_{t=3 to 8} Δy_t =1 + S, S sum of 6 Δy.\n\nWant y_9=8, so 1+S=8, S=7.\n\nBut with 6 actions, S <=6, so y_9 <=1+6=7, cannot reach 8.\n\nImpossible to be at y=8 at t=9 with only 6 actions from y=1.\n\nMin to y=8 is 7 actions, at t=10.\n\ny_10=8 as before, but we saw it requires y_6<=3, contradiction.\n\nThus, indeed, the earliest is t=12 with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 9 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn t=3: at y=1, choose a_3. Since we go up, a_3=U\n\nThen t=4 y=2\n\na_4=U to y=3 at t=5\n\nt=5 y=3, here we do a_5=S to stay at y=3 for t=6\n\nThen t=6 y=3\n\na_6=U to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7 y=4\n\na_7=U to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8 y=5\n\na_8=U to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9 y=6\n\na_9=U to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10 y=7\n\na_10=U to y=8 at t=11\n\nt=11 y=8\n\na_11=U to y=9 at t=12\n\nNow, we need to make sure all positions are safe.\n\nAt t=3: y=1, freeway 1, safe as established.\n\nt=4: y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nt=5: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=6: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=7: y=4, freeway 4. Now at t=7, freeway 4 dangerous only at t=6, not t=7. So should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: y=5, freeway 5, dangerous only at t=6, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=6, freeway 6, dangerous only at t=6, not t=9, safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nt=11: y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at t=6,7,8. t=11>8, so not dangerous, safe.\n\nt=12: y=9, goal, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way with 8 actions? We thought not, but let's see.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=3 by t=5 as before.\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, we could go directly to y=4 at t=6, but dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps use down, but it would take more actions.\n\nFor example, from t=5 y=3, go down to y=2 at t=6, safe, but then at t=6 y=2, then we need to go up to y=3 at t=7, y=4 at t=8, etc., reaching later.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo to y=0 at some point, but y=0 to y=9 takes more steps.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo min H=9 actions.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: a_3 to a_11.\n\na_3: U\n\na_4: U\n\na_5: S  // stay to avoid\n\na_6: U\n\na_7: U\n\na_8: U\n\na_9: U\n\na_10: U\n\na_11: U\n\nIn terms of the turn, actions for turn t=3 to t=11.\n\nThe answer should list actions starting from turn t_1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_3\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_4\n\n...\n\nup to turn t_1 + H-1, with H=9, so up to t_1 +8.\n\nt_1=3, H=9 actions? Number of turns from t=3 to t=11 for actions, but t=11 is the last action to reach at t=12.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, but t_1 is given.\n\nThe action sequence: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nHere t_1=3, so actions at t=3,4,5,..., up to t=3 + (H-1)\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=9, t_1 + H =3+9=12, y_12=9.\n\nActions at t= t_1 + t for t=0 to 8? t from 0 to H-1=8.\n\nSo actions at time: t_1 +0 =3, t_1+1=4, ..., t_1+8=11.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5 (which is t_1 +2), we have S.\n\nt_1=3, t=0: t_1 +0=3\n\nt=1: t_1+1=4\n\nt=2: t_1+2=5\n\nt=3:6\n\nt=4:7\n\nt=5:8\n\nt=6:9\n\nt=7:10\n\nt=8:11\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=3 (t_1+0): U\n\nt=4 (t_1+1): U\n\nt=5 (t_1+2): S\n\nt=6 (t_1+3): U\n\nt=7 (t_1+4): U\n\nt=8 (t_1+5): U\n\nt=9 (t_1+6): U\n\nt=10 (t_1+7): U\n\nt=11 (t_1+8): U\n\nIn the sequence above, a_6 at t=6 is U to y=4 at t=7, etc.\n\nIn the list, for turn t_1 + t, action.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 8 dangerous at t=6,7,8, but in this path, we are on y=8 at t=11, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=8 earlier, say at t=9?\n\nAt t=9, y=8 is safe, since t=9>8.\n\nThen go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\ny_9=8.\n\nFrom y_3=1, with actions a_3 to a_8, 6 actions? a_3 to a_8 determine y_4 to y_9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nBut y_8 depends on previous.\n\ny_9 = y_3 + sum_{k=3 to 8} Δy_k\n\n6 actions, sum S, y_9 =1 + S.\n\nWant y_9=8, so S=7, but 6 actions, S<=6, impossible.\n\nThus cannot be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10: y_10=8, requires 7 actions a_3 to a_9, S=7, all U, but then y_6=4 at t=6 dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nSo indeed, min H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have one S, so it takes 9 actions to achieve net +8.\n\nNow, but in the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 7 and others.\n\nFreeway 7 is always safe, no issue.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 7 has a car, but it never covers x=0, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, collision only on the freeway you are on at that turn.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nSo minimal number of turns H=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: U  // t_1=3\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U  // t=4\n\nTurn t_1 +2: S  // t=5\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U  // t=6\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U  // t=7\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U  // t=8\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U  // t=9\n\nTurn t_1 +7: U  // t=10\n\nTurn t_1 +8: U  // t=11\n\nIn the action indices: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 8.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nHere t_1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut turn 11 is t_1 + 8, and H=9, so from turn 3 to 11, that's 9 turns.\n\nt_1 to t_1 + H-1 =3 to 11.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I think that's the minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we go up faster to y=7 or something, but we can't.\n\nFor example, if at t=3, we do U to y=2 t=4\n\nThen at t=4, instead of U, do U to y=3 t=5, same.\n\nNo way to jump.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 3 to turn 11.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) at turn 6 (when these freeways are dangerous) and not on freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turns 6, 7, and 8 (when it is dangerous). Specifically:\n- At turn 5 (action S), the player stays at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11, after the dangerous period for freeway 8 (turns 6-8), ensuring safety.\n\nThe actions and positions are as follows:\n- Turn 3: Action U, position to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 4 (freeway 2, safe).\n- Turn 4: Action U, position to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 5 (freeway 3, safe).\n- Turn 5: Action S, position stays at \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 6 (freeway 3, safe; avoids \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6).\n- Turn 6: Action U, position to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 7 (freeway 4, safe; not dangerous at turn 7).\n- Turn 7: Action U, position to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 8 (freeway 5, safe; not dangerous at turn 8).\n- Turn 8: Action U, position to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 9 (freeway 6, safe; not dangerous at turn 9).\n- Turn 9: Action U, position to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 10 (freeway 7, always safe).\n- Turn 10: Action U, position to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 11 (freeway 8, safe; turn 11 > 8, not dangerous).\n- Turn 11: Action U, position to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 12 (goal reached, no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 9\\) turns, with all positions safe from collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving only vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay). The vertical position y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI need to avoid collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, I move from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, and I only enter y+1 at turn T+1. Therefore, I don't collide with cars on y+1 at turn T if I move there; I only need to worry about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at turn t1=4, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on the update rules.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars: \n  - Car 1: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4\n  - Car 2: head 16, tail 5, direction right, speed 4\n\nDirection right means right-moving, so for right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head], and it moves positively in x.\n\nFor car 1 on freeway 1: at t1=4, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ], for right-moving, span is [τ, h].\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ], so h is the right end, τ is the left end? This might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's clarify the head and tail.\n\nTypically, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor a right-moving car, head is on the right, tail on the left, so span is [tail, head].\n\nFor a left-moving car, head is on the left, tail on the right, so span is [head, tail].\n\nIn the update:\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] where Δt = T - t1\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1:\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4\n\nSince direction right, span should be [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, span is [-59 + 4*(T-4), -48 + 4*(T-4)]\n\nSecond car on freeway 1: head 16, tail 5, direction right, speed 4\n\nSpan [5, 16] at t=4, so at T, [5 + 4*(T-4), 16 + 4*(T-4)]\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, head -48, tail -25, direction left, speed 24\n\nDirection left, so span [h, τ] = [-48, -25]? Head is -48, tail -25, and since left-moving, head should be the front, which for left is left side, so span [h, τ] = [-48, -25]\n\nThen at T, moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-48 - 24*(T-4), -25 - 24*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 3: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36\n\nDirection right, span [τ, h] = [-83, -48] at t=4\n\nAt T, [-83 + 36*(T-4), -48 + 36*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 4: head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 12\n\nSpan [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t=4\n\nAt T, [-35 + 12*(T-4), -24 + 12*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? head -24, tail -35, right, speed 12. Identical to freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6: also head -24, tail -35, right, speed 12. Same as 4 and 5.\n\nThat seems odd, but possible. Maybe multiple cars or same data.\n\nFreeway 7: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars:\n\nFirst: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 4 → span [ -59, -48 ] at t=4, at T [ -59 +4*(T-4), -48 +4*(T-4) ]\n\nSecond: head 28, tail 17, right, speed 4 → span [17, 28] at t=4, at T [17+4*(T-4), 28+4*(T-4)]\n\nThird: head -8, tail -19, right, speed 4 → span [-19, -8] at t=4, at T [-19+4*(T-4), -8+4*(T-4)]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there exists a car such that 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=4.\n\nI need to move to y=9. Since y from 0 to 9, freeways are 1 to 8, so y=9 is the top, no cars, I think. The goal is (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are boundaries, I assume no cars, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nPlayer can be at y=0 or y=9, which are safe.\n\nAt each turn, based on action, y changes, and I must not be on a freeway where a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the player moves only vertically, and cars move horizontally, the collision depends on the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2, I need to go up, so actions U or S, but S stays, so probably mostly U, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nSince I need minimal turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each freeway, at which turns x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, find times when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving, at each turn, if I'm on a freeway y, I need that at that turn, for freeway y, no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince freeways are independent, I can compute the danger times for each freeway.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 4.\n\nFor each freeway, find T such that 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1).\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: span at T: [ -59 + 4(Δt), -48 + 4(Δt) ] where Δt = T-4\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4(Δt) <= 0 <= -48 + 4(Δt)\n\nSimilarly, car B: [5 + 4(Δt), 16 + 4(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 5 + 4(Δt) <= 0 <= 16 + 4(Δt)\n\nBut 0 <= 16 + 4(Δt) always true since Δt >=0, and 5 + 4(Δt) <= 0 only if 4(Δt) <= -5, impossible since Δt>=0, so 5 + 4(Δt) >=5 >0, so 0 < lower bound, thus 0 never in span for car B.\n\nSimilarly, for car A: 0 in [ -59 +4Δt, -48 +4Δt ]\n\nSo -59 +4Δt <= 0 <= -48 +4Δt\n\nLeft: -59 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so Δt <=14 since integer turns? Turns are discrete, I assume T integer.\n\nt1=4, T integer >=4.\n\nSo Δt integer >=0.\n\n-59 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59 => Δt <= 14.75, so Δt <=14\n\n0 <= -48 +4Δt => 48 <=4Δt => Δt >=12\n\nSo for Δt from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 is in car A span.\n\nΔt=12: lower = -59+48= -11, upper= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=13: lower= -59+52= -7, upper= -48+52=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=14: lower= -59+56= -3, upper= -48+56=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=15: lower= -59+60=1, upper= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: as above, 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous when Δt=12,13,14, i.e., T=16,17,18.\n\nT = t1 + Δt =4 + Δt, so T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, left-moving.\n\nHead -48, tail -25, left, speed 24.\n\nSpan at t: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-48 -24 Δt, -25 -24 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -48 -24 Δt <= 0 <= -25 -24 Δt\n\nLeft: -48 -24 Δt <=0 => -24 Δt <=48 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 24 Δt >=48? Let's careful.\n\n-48 -24 Δt <=0 => -24 Δt <=48, divide by -24, reverse: Δt >= 48/(-24) = -2, but Δt >=0, so always true? No.\n\n-48 -24 Δt <=0 => -24 Δt <=48, now divide by -24, inequality reverses: Δt >= 48 / (-24) * (-1)? Standard: dividing by negative.\n\n-24 Δt <= 48, divide both sides by -24, reverse: Δt >= 48 / (-24) = -2, but since Δt >=0, Δt >=0 implies this is true for all Δt.\n\nBut we also have 0 <= -25 -24 Δt\n\n0 <= -25 -24 Δt => 0 +25 <= -24 Δt? 25 <= -24 Δt\n\nSince -24 Δt is negative for Δt>=0, 25 <= negative number impossible.\n\nSo 0 <= -25 -24 Δt is false for all Δt>=0, since right side negative.\n\nThus, for freeway 2, 0 never in span, so no danger at any time.\n\nConfirm: at Δt=0, span [-48, -25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAs Δt increases, span moves left, more negative, so 0 never covered.\n\nSo freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nRight-moving, span [τ, h] = [-83, -48] at t=4.\n\nAt T: [-83 + 36 Δt, -48 + 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -83 +36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 +36 Δt\n\nLeft: -83 +36 Δt <=0 => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +36 Δt => 48 <=36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer? Δt integer.\n\nΔt >= ceil(1.333) =2? But Δt must satisfy both.\n\n-83 +36 Δt <=0 => Δt <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) =2\n\n0 <= -48 +36 Δt => 36 Δt >=48 => Δt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) =2\n\n48/36=4/3≈1.333, ceil to 2.\n\nAnd Δt <=2, so Δt=2.\n\nCheck: Δt=2, lower= -83 + 72 = -11, upper= -48 +72=24, [ -11,24], 0 in.\n\nΔt=1: lower= -83+36= -47, upper= -48+36= -12, [ -47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: lower= -83+108=25, upper= -48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=4+2=6.\n\nDanger at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSpan [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t=4.\n\nAt T: [-35 +12 Δt, -24 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -24 +12 Δt\n\nLeft: -35 +12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +12 Δt => 24 <=12 Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt=2.\n\nΔt=2: lower= -35+24= -11, upper= -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 included? Since <= and >=, 0 is included.\n\nYes.\n\nΔt=1: lower= -35+12= -23, upper= -24+12= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not.\n\nΔt=3: lower= -35+36=1, upper= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=6.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4, so also danger at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: same, danger at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: head -48, tail -83, direction right, speed 36. Same as freeway 3, so danger at T=6.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 4. Span [ -59, -48] at t=4, at T [ -59 +4 Δt, -48 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4 Δt <=0 <= -48 +4 Δt\n\nWhich requires Δt >=12 and Δt <=14, as for freeway 1 car A.\n\nSpecifically, -59+4Δt <=0 => Δt <=14.75, Δt<=14\n\n0<= -48+4Δt => 48<=4Δt => Δt>=12\n\nSo for Δt=12,13,14, T=16,17,18.\n\nSecond car: head 28, tail 17, right, speed 4. Span [17,28] at t=4, at T [17+4Δt, 28+4Δt]\n\n0 in span? 17+4Δt <=0 <=28+4Δt? But 17+4Δt >=17>0, so lower bound >0, 0 never in.\n\nThird car: head -8, tail -19, right, speed 4. Span [-19, -8] at t=4, at T [-19+4Δt, -8+4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -19+4Δt <=0 <= -8+4Δt\n\nLeft: -19+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=19 => Δt <=19/4=4.75, Δt<=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -8+4Δt => 8 <=4Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt from 2 to 4 inclusive.\n\nΔt=2: lower= -19+8= -11, upper= -8+8=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=3: lower= -19+12= -7, upper= -8+12=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=4: lower= -19+16= -3, upper= -8+16=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: lower= -19+20=1, upper= -8+20=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSo for freeway 8, dangerous from Δt=2 to 4 and Δt=12 to 14, i.e., T=6,7,8 and T=16,17,18.\n\nΔt=2,3,4: T=6,7,8\n\nΔt=12,13,14: T=16,17,18\n\nAnd the second car never dangerous.\n\nNow summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous T=16,17,18\n\n- y=2: always safe (no danger)\n\n- y=3: dangerous T=6\n\n- y=4: dangerous T=6\n\n- y=5: dangerous T=6\n\n- y=6: dangerous T=6\n\n- y=7: dangerous T=6\n\n- y=8: dangerous T=6,7,8 and T=16,17,18\n\ny=2 has no cars? Freeway 2 has one car but we saw it's never dangerous, so safe at all times.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nSince I start at y=2, which is safe at t=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe actions: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays, but y must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from 2 to 9, that's 7 steps up, so at least 7 turns if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nSince y=2 is always safe, I could stay there if needed.\n\nBut I need to move up.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are around T=6 for many freeways, and later at T=16-18.\n\nBut T=16-18 is far, since t=4 now, so in minimal turns, I might not reach there, but going from y=2 to y=9 in 7 turns, at T=4+6=10? Let's see.\n\nIf I start at t=4, y=2.\n\nAfter each action, y changes at the end of the turn.\n\nTurn t: I perform action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThe position is given for turn t, so at the start of turn t, I am at (0,y_t), I choose action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T, based on y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I must not have collision, meaning no car on freeway y_T has 0 in span at that turn T.\n\nFor the action: at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe collision depends on y_t at turn t.\n\nIn terms of sequence:\n\n- At turn t=4: position y=2, I choose a_4, then y_5 is set based on a_4.\n\n- At turn t=5: position y_5, I choose a_5, then y_6 set, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t in [1,8] and for freeway y_t, 0 in some car span at time t.\n\nNow, for minimal H, I need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after H actions, y_{t1 + H} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1=4, position y_{t1} = y_4 =2.\n\nAfter first action a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nAfter second action a_5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{t1 + k} = y_{4+k}\n\nI want y_{4+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe number of turns H means I perform H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, I am at y_{t1 + H}\n\nSet t_index = turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H turns, from t=4 to t=4+H-1, I perform actions, and at turn t=4+H, I have y_{4+H}.\n\nI need y_{4+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nNow, to go from y=2 to y=9, the minimal number of actions is 7, if I go up each time, so y increases by 1 each turn, from y_4=2, y_5=3, y_6=4, ..., up to y_{11}=9? Let's compute:\n\nt=4, y=2\n\nAfter a_4: if U, y_5=3\n\na_5: U, y_6=4\n\na_6: U, y_7=5\n\na_7: U, y_8=6\n\na_8: U, y_9=7\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=8\n\na_{10}: U, y_{11}=9\n\nSo after 7 actions (H=7), at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nH=7 turns: actions from t=4 to t=10, y reaches 9 at t=11.\n\nNow, is this possible without collision? Need to check for each turn from t=4 to t=10, the position y_t, and if on freeway, no collision.\n\nt=4: y=2, freeway 2, which is always safe, no problem.\n\nt=5: y_5, if I go up, y_5=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 dangerous at t=6? t=5 is not t=6.\n\nAt turn t=5, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nIs freeway 3 dangerous at t=5?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 3 dangerous only at t=6.\n\nt=5: Δt = t-4 =1, for freeway 3, at Δt=1, span [ -47, -12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nt=6: y_6, if I go up, y_6=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, Δt=2, freeway 4 span [ -35 +12*2, -24 +12*2] = [ -35+24, -24+24] = [ -11, 0], 0 included, so collision if on freeway 4 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, y=4, so on freeway 4, collision occurs.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if I go straight up, at t=6, I would be on y=4 or something, but collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=6, y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot go directly up without stopping or something.\n\nI need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- For y=3: only t=6\n\n- y=4: t=6\n\n- y=5: t=6\n\n- y=6: t=6\n\n- y=7: t=6\n\n- y=8: t=6,7,8\n\n- y=1: t=16,17,18 (but far)\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\nSince t=6 is dangerous for y=3 to 8, except y=2 safe.\n\ny=2 is safe at all times.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nTo avoid t=6, I could stay at y=2 at t=5 or something.\n\nLet me list the turns from t=4 onwards.\n\nt=4: y=2, safe. Action a_4.\n\nAfter a_4, y_5 set.\n\nt=5: position y_5, must be safe, so if y_5 in [1,8], no collision at t=5.\n\nt=5: Δt = t-4 =1\n\nNow, for each freeway at t=5:\n\ny=1: at Δt=1, freeway 1 car A: [ -59+4= -55, -48+4= -44], 0 not in. car B: [5+4=9,16+4=20], 0 not. Safe.\n\ny=2: always safe.\n\ny=3: at Δt=1, span [ -83+36, -48+36] = [ -47, -12], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=4: at Δt=1, span [ -35+12, -24+12] = [ -23, -12], 0 not, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7: all similar, at Δt=1, spans negative, safe.\n\ny=8: at Δt=1, cars: first [ -59+4= -55, -48+4= -44], 0 not; second [17+4=21,28+4=32], 0 not; third [ -19+4= -15, -8+4= -4], [ -15,-4], 0 not in. So all safe at t=5.\n\nt=6: as before, y=3,4,5,6,7 dangerous, y=1,2,8? y=8 has cars dangerous at t=6.\n\ny=1: at t=6, Δt=2, freeway 1: car A [ -59+8= -51, -48+8= -40], 0 not in (earlier we had danger only at Δt=12-14, not here). car B [5+8=13,16+8=24], 0 not. So y=1 safe at t=6.\n\ny=2 safe.\n\ny=3 dangerous.\n\ny=4 dangerous.\n\netc.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=6.\n\nt=7: Δt=3\n\ny=1: safe, as before not dangerous times.\n\ny=2: safe\n\ny=3: at Δt=3, freeway 3: [ -83+108=25, -48+108=60], 0 not, safe.\n\ny=4: at Δt=3, [ -35+36=1, -24+36=12], 0 not, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7 safe at t=7.\n\ny=8: at t=7, Δt=3, freeway 8: first car [ -59+12= -47, -48+12= -36], 0 not; second [17+12=29,28+12=40], 0 not; third [ -19+12= -7, -8+12=4], [ -7,4], 0 in! Yes, dangerous for freeway 8 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: Δt=4, y=8 dangerous.\n\nt=9: Δt=5, freeway 8: first car [ -59+20= -39, -48+20= -28], 0 not; second [17+20=37,28+20=48], 0 not; third [ -19+20=1, -8+20=12], [1,12], 0 not. So safe at t=9.\n\nAnd later, t=16-18 dangerous for y=1 and y=8, but we might not care if we reach earlier.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nStart at t=4, y=2, safe.\n\nI need to choose actions to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H=7 if possible, but at t=6, if I am on y=4,5,6, or7, collision, or on y=3 or8 at t=6.\n\ny=3 to7 all dangerous at t=6 except y=1,2, but y=1 and2 are low.\n\nAt t=6, I must not be on y=3,4,5,6,7, or8.\n\ny=8 is dangerous, y=3-7 dangerous.\n\nOnly y=0,1,2,9 are safe at t=6.\n\ny=0 or9 no freeway, safe.\n\ny=1 and y=2 safe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, y=8 dangerous, others safe except y=8.\n\nt=7: y=8 dangerous, others safe.\n\nt=8: y=8 dangerous.\n\nNow for minimal path, I need to be at safe positions at each turn.\n\nSince t=6 is critical, I should be at y=0,1,2, or9 at t=6.\n\nBut y=9 might be too far.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nIf I go up at t=4, to y=3 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=3, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=5, I need to choose action for t=5.\n\nIf I go up again, to y=4 at t=6, but t=6 y=4 dangerous.\n\nIf I stay, S, then y_6 = y_5 =3, so at t=6, y=3, dangerous.\n\nIf I go down, D, then y_6=2, which is safe.\n\nSo at t=5, if I go down, from y=3 to y=2.\n\nThen at t=6, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can continue up later.\n\nBut this adds extra turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could stay at y=2 for some turns.\n\nBut minimal turns.\n\nAnother idea: go up fast but skip the dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=2, I could stay (S), so y_5=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I go up, to y=3 at t=6? t=5 action a_5, y_6 set.\n\nIf at t=5, I go up, y_6=3.\n\nBut t=6 y=3 dangerous.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=5, I stay, y_6=2, safe at t=6.\n\nBut then I am still at y=2.\n\nNot progressing.\n\nTo avoid being on y=3-8 at t=6, I need to be below or above at t=6.\n\nSince I start at y=2, I could go down to y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=9 is far.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nIf I go down, D, then y_5=1.\n\nt=5: y=1, which is freeway 1, but at t=5, safe as we saw.\n\nThen at t=5, if I stay, y_6=1, which at t=6 is safe (y=1 safe at t=6).\n\nOr if I go down to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 might not help.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=6, I can go up later.\n\nBut let's list possible paths with minimal turns.\n\nFirst, the direct up in 7 turns: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=4 to t=10.\n\ny: t=4:2, t=5:3, t=6:4, but t=6 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nI need to be at safe y at t=6.\n\nSafe y at t=6: y=0,1,2,9 (but 9 impossible by t=6 since from y=2, max y=2+2=4 at t=6? t=4 y=2, after two actions, at t=6 y could be up to 4.\n\ny_6 <= y_4 + 2 if both U, but 4<9.\n\nSo only possible safe y at t=6 are 0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, safe except y=8 dangerous.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=6, I must have y_6 <=2 or y_6=0,1,2.\n\ny_6=0,1, or2.\n\nSince y_4=2, to have y_6 <=2, I need to not go up, or go down.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: at t=4, stay S, so a_4=S, y_5=2\n\nThen at t=5, stay S, a_5=S, y_6=2\n\nThen at t=6, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nFrom t=6, y=2.\n\nThen go up each turn: a_6=U, y_7=3\n\nt=7: y=3, now at t=7, freeway 3 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\na_7=U, y_8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, freeway 4, at t=8, Δt=4, safe? Freeway 4 at t=8: Δt=4, span [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], 0 not, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, freeway 5, at t=9, Δt=5, span [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36], 0 not, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nt=10: y=6, freeway 6, Δt=6, span [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48], safe.\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=7\n\nt=11: y=7, freeway 7, Δt=7, span for freeway 7: same as 3, [-83+36*7, -48+36*7]=[-83+252, -48+252]=[169,204], safe.\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=8\n\nt=12: y=8, freeway 8, at t=12, Δt=8.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: first [ -59 +4*8, -48+32]= [-59+32, -48+32]=[-27,-16], 0 not\n\nSecond [17+32,28+32]=[49,60], 0 not\n\nThird [ -19+32, -8+32]=[13,24], 0 not. Safe.\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=9, reached.\n\nNow, number of actions: from t=4 to t=12, that's 9 actions? Turns: actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nt=4 to t=12 inclusive, that's 9 turns, but H is the number of turns, so actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nStart t=4, after H actions, at turn t=4+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions: a_4 to a_12, that's 9 actions? t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: that's 9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{13}=9.\n\nt=4+H =13, so H=9.\n\nBut earlier minimal was 7, now 9 with waiting.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nI could go up immediately but avoid being on dangerous y at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=4, go up to y=3 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of going up, I go down to y=2 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nt=4: a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: a_5=D, y_6=2\n\nt=6: y=2, safe\n\nThen t=6: a_6=U, y_7=3\n\nt=7: y=3, safe (as before)\n\na_7=U, y_8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, safe\n\na_8=U, y_9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, safe\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nt=10: y=6, safe\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=7\n\nt=11: y=7, safe\n\na_{11}=U, y_{12}=8\n\nt=12: y=8, now at t=12, safe as before\n\na_{12}=U, y_{13}=9\n\nReached at t=13, same as before, H=9 actions? Actions from t=4 to t=12, 9 actions, y_{13}=9.\n\nt=4+H=13, H=9.\n\nBut from y=2, after going to y=3 and back to y=2, I wasted two actions, so from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, plus 2 extra, 9 actions.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nSuppose I stay at y=2 until after t=6, but I need to start moving.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 is safe, I can stay at y=2 for t=4 and t=5, then at t=6 I am at y=2 safe, then go up.\n\nBut from t=6 y=2 to y=9, need 7 actions, reach at t=13, same as above.\n\nIf I go up at t=4 to y=3 at t=5, safe, then at t=5 I stay at y=3? But at t=6 if y=3, dangerous, so I cannot stay or go up; must go down to avoid.\n\nBut going down wastes a turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=1 or something.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach before t=13.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 by t=10 or something.\n\nBut from t=4 y=2, to y=9, minimal 7 actions, so earliest at t=11.\n\nt=11 y=9 possible? Only if I go up 7 times from t=4 to t=10.\n\nBut at t=6, I must be at safe y, which is 0,1,2.\n\nIf I go up from t=4: t=4 U, y5=3\n\nt=5 U, y6=4 → but t=6 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nt=4 U, y5=3\n\nt=5 D, y6=2 → safe at t=6\n\nThen from t=6, I need to go to y=9, which takes 7 turns: t=6 to t=12 actions, y13=9.\n\nSame.\n\nt=4 S, y5=2\n\nt=5 S, y6=2\n\nThen t=6 U, y7=3\n\n...\n\nUp to t=12 U, y13=9, still 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I go from t=6 y=2, after 7 ups: t=6 U y7=3, t=7 U y8=4, t=8 U y9=5, t=9 U y10=6, t=10 U y11=7, t=11 U y12=8, t=12 U y13=9. Yes.\n\nNow, is there a way to have fewer actions?\n\nSuppose I go up to y=8 quickly but avoid t=6 on dangerous y.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 by t=8 or something.\n\nBut at t=6, I need to be low.\n\ny=9 is safe, but I need to reach it.\n\nAnother point: at t=7 and t=8, y=8 is dangerous, so when I go to y=8, I need to do it when not dangerous.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=9, y=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways safe after t=6.\n\nIn the above path, when I reach y=8 at t=12, it is safe.\n\nBut I can reach y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, from start, if I stay at y=2 until t=6.\n\nt=4: S, y5=2\n\nt=5: S, y6=2\n\nt=6: at y=2, safe\n\nNow, at t=6, I can go up: a_6=U, y7=3\n\nt=7: y=3, safe\n\na_7=U, y8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, safe\n\na_8=U, y9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, safe\n\na_9=U, y10=6\n\nt=10: y=6, safe\n\na_10=U, y11=7\n\nt=11: y=7, safe\n\na_11=U, y12=8\n\nt=12: y=8, now at t=12, safe as before\n\na_12=U, y13=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=12, I go to y=9 immediately? a_12=U to y13=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, y12=8, then a12=U to y13=9.\n\nBut I need y at some turn to be 9.\n\nNow, to save one turn, suppose at some point I can go faster.\n\nFor example, after t=6, I am at y=2, but instead of going step by step, I can only go up, since down would be worse.\n\nPerhaps I can be at higher y earlier if I don't wait, but I have to avoid t=6.\n\nAnother idea: go down at t=4 to y=1.\n\nt=4: D, y5=1\n\nt=5: at y=1, safe. Then I can stay or go down or up.\n\nIf at t=5, I go up to y=2? Or stay.\n\nBut y=1 at t=5 safe, at t=6 also safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=4: D, y5=1\n\nt=5: S, y6=1 (safe at t=6)\n\nThen t=6: U, y7=2\n\nBut y7=2, then I need to go to y=9 from y=2, which is 7 steps, to y13=9 or something.\n\nLet's not; it might take more turns.\n\nStaying at y=2 is better.\n\nMinimal H is 9? But let's confirm if I can reach in 8 actions.\n\nSuppose H=8, then actions from t=4 to t=11, y_{12} =9.\n\ny_{12}=9.\n\nNow, from y4=2 to y12=9, that requires increasing by 7 in 8 actions, so net +7, meaning I can have one stay or one down, but since I need to go up, probably all U except one S or something.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, at t=6, y6 must be 0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, other times less critical.\n\nNow, y4=2\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\n...\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11\n\ny12=9.\n\nThe values:\n\nLet the actions determine the changes.\n\ny6 must be <=2.\n\ny12=9.\n\nThe difference y12 - y4 =7, with 8 steps.\n\ny12 - y4 = sum of Δy from t=4 to t=11, that's 8 actions.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1.\n\nSum of 8 terms = +7.\n\nSo number of U must be 7 more than D, or something.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S, with u + d + s =8, and y12 - y4 = u - d =7.\n\nSo u - d =7, u + d + s =8.\n\nThen from u - d =7, u + d + s =8, add them: 2u + s =15, subtract: 2d + s =1.\n\nSince s >=0, 2d + s =1, so d=0, s=1 or d=1, s=-1 impossible, so d=0, s=1, then u=7.\n\nSo exactly 7 U, 1 S, 0 D.\n\nI must have seven U and one S in the actions.\n\nNow, I need y6 <=2.\n\ny4=2.\n\ny6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nSince y6 = y5 + Δy5, and y5 = y4 + Δy4, so y6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nSimilarly.\n\ny6 = 2 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\ny6 <=2, so 2 + Δy4 + Δy5 <=2, thus Δy4 + Δy5 <=0.\n\nΔy is -1,0,+1 for D,S,U.\n\nSo Δy4 + Δy5 <=0.\n\nSince each >= -1, the sum <=0.\n\nNow, the actions include seven U and one S, so the S must be in one of the actions.\n\nNow, y6 <=2 requires that in the first two actions, the sum of changes <=0.\n\nThat is, for Δy4 and Δy5, their sum <=0.\n\nSince each can be U: +1, S:0, D:-1.\n\nPossible pairs (a4, a5) such that Δy4 + Δy5 <=0:\n\n- (S,S): 0+0=0 <=0\n\n- (S,D): 0 + (-1) = -1 <=0\n\n- (D,S): -1 + 0 = -1 <=0\n\n- (D,D): -1-1=-2 <=0\n\n- (U,D): +1 -1 =0 <=0\n\n- (D,U): -1 +1 =0 <=0\n\n- (S,U): 0+1=1 >0 not <=0\n\n- (U,S): 1+0=1>0 not\n\n- (U,U):1+1=2>0 not\n\nSo possible actions for (a4,a5): S S, S D, D S, D D, U D, D U.\n\nBut we have to use U and S only, no D, since u=7, d=0, s=1.\n\nIn this case, for H=8, we have d=0, so no D actions.\n\nThus, only possible if (a4,a5) are (S,S) or (S,D) or (D,S) or (D,D) but D not allowed, or (U,D) D not, or (D,U) not.\n\nWith d=0, the only possibility for Δy4 + Δy5 <=0 is (S,S): both stay, Δy=0, sum=0.\n\nBut (S,U) or (U,S) or (U,U) not allowed because sum>0.\n\nSo only (S,S) for (a4,a5).\n\nThus, a4=S, a5=S, so y5=2, y6=2.\n\nThen y6=2 <=2, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y12=9 with 6 actions: a6 to a11, 6 actions.\n\ny6=2, y12=9, need +7 in 6 actions? y12 - y6 =9-2=7, with 6 actions (t=6 to t=11 actions).\n\nEach action changes y, so with 6 actions, I can increase at most 6, to y12=8, not 9.\n\ny6=2, after a6, y7; ... after a11, y12.\n\n6 actions, each can increase by at most 1, so y12 <= 2+6=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf I use U all, y12=8.\n\nBut I need y12=9, impossible with 6 actions from y6=2.\n\nTherefore, with H=8, it is impossible to reach y12=9 because after setting y6<=2 with the constraints, I have only 6 actions to gain 7, impossible.\n\nThus H=8 is not possible.\n\nMinimal H=9.\n\nIn H=9, I can do as before.\n\nNow, with H=9, actions from t=4 to t=12, y13=9.\n\nAnd y13 - y4 =9-2=7, with 9 actions, so u - d =7, u + d + s =9.\n\nThen 2u + s =16, 2d + s =2.\n\nPossible, e.g., u=7, d=0, s=2 or u=8, d=1, s=0, etc.\n\nBut since we want minimal, but H=9 fixed, we can choose.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nIn particular, we need y6 <=2.\n\ny6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 = 2 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\ny6 <=2, so Δy4 + Δy5 <=0.\n\nAlso, for other times, but mainly t=6 critical.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have, for example, two S or one D, but since we can, let's find a sequence.\n\nFor instance, as before:\n\nt=4: S, y5=2\n\nt=5: S, y6=2 (safe at t=6)\n\nThen t=6: U, y7=3\n\nt=7: U, y8=4\n\nt=8: U, y9=5\n\nt=9: U, y10=6\n\nt=10: U, y11=7\n\nt=11: U, y12=8\n\nt=12: U, y13=9\n\nNow, check each turn for collision:\n\nt=4: y=2, freeway 2, safe always.\n\nt=5: y=2, same, safe.\n\nt=6: y=2, safe.\n\nt=7: y=3, freeway 3. At t=7, Δt=3, span [ -83+108=25, -48+108=60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=4, freeway 4. At t=8, Δt=4, span [-35+48=13, -24+48=24], 0 not, safe.\n\nt=9: y=5, freeway 5. Similarly, Δt=5, span [-35+60=25, -24+60=36], safe.\n\nt=10: y=6, freeway 6. Δt=6, span [-35+72=37, -24+72=48], safe.\n\nt=11: y=7, freeway 7.

At t=12, Δt=8, as before, all spans away, safe.\n\nThen after a12=U, y13=9, reached.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nIn this sequence, I used two S at beginning, and seven U.\n\nBut I could have other sequences.\n\nFor example, go down and up.\n\nt=4: U, y5=3\n\nt=5: D, y6=2  (since at t=5, if I go D, y6=2, safe at t=6)\n\nThen t=6: U, y7=3\n\n...\n\nSame as before, to t=12: U to y13=9.\n\nBut in this case, actions: t=4 U, t=5 D, then t=6 to t=12 U, that's 9 actions: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nt=4 U, t=5 D, t=6 U, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U, t=11 U, t=12 U.\n\ny: t=4:2, t=5:3 (safe), t=6:2 (safe), t=7:3, t=8:4, ..., up to t=12:8, then y13=9.\n\nAt t=5: y=3, freeway 3, at t=5 (Δt=1), safe.\n\nt=6: y=2, safe.\n\nAll other same as above.\n\nBut in this case, I used one D, but still H=9.\n\nI could have fewer S or D, but since I need two extra actions, I have to have them.\n\nIn the first sequence, with two S, or here with one U and one D, net same.\n\nBut both work.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the action sequence.\n\nAlso, the later dangerous times at T=16-18, but since we reach by t=13, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, I should specify the actions.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9 but reaching earlier? No, because from y=2 to y=9, minimal 7 actions, but due to obstacle, we need 9.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=2, if I could go up multiple, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother point: at t=7 and t=8, y=8 is dangerous, but in the sequence, when I reach y=8 at t=12, it is late, so safe.\n\nIf I reach y=8 earlier, I need to avoid t=7 and t=8.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up quickly to y=8 by t=8 or something.\n\nBut at t=6, I need to be low, so impossible.\n\nFor instance, from y=2 at t=4, if I go up three times: t=4 U y5=3, t=5 U y6=4, but t=6 y=4 dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo the sequence above is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to write the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence: actions at t=4 to t=12.\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: S\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nBut y reaches 9 at t=13.\n\nIn the sequence, t=12 action U, to y13=9.\n\nH=9 turns.\n\nTo write in the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (t1=4)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1\n\nH=9, so from t=4 to t=4+8=12? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nt_1=4, so actions at 4 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=9, actions at t=4 to 12 (t=4+0 to 4+8).\n\nIn the box:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nThen at turn 13, y=9.\n\nI could have the sequence with down:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAlso works, and same H.\n\nIn this case, at turn 5, y=3, which is safe, and turn 6 y=2 safe.\n\nPerhaps I can have the stay later, but not necessary.\n\nNow, in the first sequence, I have two S at beginning, which might be simpler.\n\nBut both are minimal.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 4,5,6 all have the same cars, but it doesn't affect, since we checked.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach in 9 with no issue.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose I stay only once and go down once, but in the down sequence, I have one S effectively.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with the first sequence: wait two turns, then go up.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 6 to 12, I have 7 U, but turn 6 to 12 is 7 actions, plus turn 4 and 5 S, total 9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving earlier but avoid.\n\nFor example, turn 4: U to y=3 at t=5 (safe)\n\nThen turn 5: S, but if S, y6=3, dangerous at t=6.\n\nCannot.\n\nTurn 5: D to y=2 at t=6, as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times, particularly at turn \\(t = 6\\) when multiple freeways are hazardous.\n\n- At turn \\(t = 6\\), freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\) are dangerous due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is dangerous at turns \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\).\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) (always safe) at turn \\(t = 4\\).\n- To avoid \\(t = 6\\) on a dangerous freeway, the player stays at \\(y = 2\\) for turns \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\) using actions \\(S\\) (stay).\n- At turn \\(t = 6\\), the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (safe), then moves up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 13\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 4: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 5: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 6: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 7: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 8: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 9: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nAfter the action at turn 12, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13. Collision checks confirm safety at all turns:\n- \\(t = 4, 5, 6\\): \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 is always safe).\n- \\(t = 7\\): \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 safe at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\), span \\([25, 60]\\), 0 not in).\n- \\(t = 8\\): \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\), span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in).\n- \\(t = 9\\): \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\), span \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in).\n- \\(t = 10\\): \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\), span \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in).\n- \\(t = 11\\): \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(\\Delta t = 7\\), span \\([169, 204]\\), 0 not in).\n- \\(t = 12\\): \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at \\(\\Delta t = 8\\), cars: \\([-27, -16]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns \\(H = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 5. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Also, when moving to a new row, you're not considered on that row until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the row you're moving to at the current turn.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 quickly without hitting any cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=5, and then we can compute where they are at future turns.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t_1=5. For left-moving cars, span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. I need to be careful with the direction.\n\nLet me parse the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\n- Car 1: head -44, tail -55, direction right, speed 4. Since direction is right, and it says for right-moving: span is [τ, h], so here h=-44, τ=-55? That seems odd because τ should be the tail, which is behind if moving right. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: \"(-44, -55, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4)\"\n\nFor the first car: it says head h and tail τ, but in the span definition, for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end (head).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] and it moves right, so τ increases, h increases.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But head and tail depend on direction.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head is larger than tail, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nBut in freeway 1, first car: (-44, -55, right, 4). -44 and -55, -44 > -55, so if direction right, head should be -44, tail -55, so span [τ, h] = [-55, -44].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (20, 9, right, 4), 20 and 9, 20>9, so head 20, tail 9, span [9,20].\n\nBut tail 9 and head 20, that means the car is from x=9 to x=20, length 11, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for the first car, tail -55, head -44, span [-55,-44], moving right.\n\nBut -55 to -44 is at x negative, but that's fine, cars can be off-screen.\n\nNow, collision when player is at (0, y) and for that y, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nPlayer is always at x=0, so we care if 0 is within the car's x-span at that turn.\n\nNow for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, one car: (-72, -49, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ], with h the left head, τ the right tail.\n\nHere given as head -72, tail -49, and since left-moving, head should be left, so -72 < -49, so span [h, τ] = [-72, -49].\n\nMoving left, so both decrease over time.\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, so span [τ, h]. head -12, tail -47, -12 > -47, so τ = -47, h = -12, span [-47, -12].\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSimilarly, head -12, tail -23, -12 > -23? -12 is greater than -23, yes, so for right, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12].\n\nBut tail -23, head -12, so from -23 to -12.\n\n-23 to -12 is length 11, but direction right.\n\nIn the input it says (-12, -23, right, 12), so first number is head, second is tail.\n\nSince right, head -12, tail -23, so τ = tail = -23, h = head = -12, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12].\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same as 4: (-12, -23, right, 12) for both, so same car configuration on y=4,5,6? Freeway 4,5,6 each have one car with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSo identical cars on y=4,5,6.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, (-12, -47, right, 36) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 is (-12, -47, right, 36), freeway 7 same.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, three cars: (-44, -55, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4), (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head -44, tail -55, right, so span [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nSecond car: head 32, tail 21, right, so since head > tail, span [τ, h] = [21, 32]\n\nThird car: head -4, tail -15, right, head -4 > tail -15, so span [τ, h] = [-15, -4]\n\nNow, player starts at y=2, t=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since freeways only y=1 to 8, so once at y=9, no collision possible, but we need to reach (0,9).\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, the minimum moves without any cars would be 7 up moves, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, and position at t=5+H-1 should be y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index, starting from t=5.\n\nAt turn t, player position y_t, and we apply action a_t to get y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is from t=5 to t=5+H-1, and after H turns, at time t=5+H, position is y_{5+H}, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t_1 =5.\n\nStart: at turn t=5, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_5, at turn t=6, position y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5, and so on.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9, with T = t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn T=4 + H, position y=9? Let's index properly.\n\nTurn indices: t=5: initial position (0,2)\n\nAfter action a_5, at turn t=6, position y_6\n\nAfter a_6, at t=7, y_7, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=5+k, position y_{5+k}\n\nWe want y_{5 + H -1} =9? From the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t, t=0: a_{t_1}, t=1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter applying these H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action a_t at turn t, position changes for turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nWe apply action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1=5, we are at y_5=2.\n\nWe choose a_5, which sets y_6.\n\nThen choose a_6, sets y_7, and so on, up to choose a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{4 + H}, which sets y_{t_1 + H} = y_{5+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThen we don't need to do anything else.\n\nSince actions are chosen from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, H actions, leading to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nFor instance, if H=1, we have one action a_{t_1} = a_5, which should set y_6, but we want y_{5 +1 -1} = y_5 =2 to be 9? But y_5 is given as 2, not 9, so H must be at least 1, but y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=1, t_1 + H -1 =5+1-1=5, so y_5 should be 9, but it's 2, contradiction.\n\nSo H min is when we reach at some turn T with y_T=9, T >= t_1.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nFor T=5, y_5=2 !=9, not possible.\n\nT=6, y_6=9, then H =6-5+1=2, actions at t=5 and t=6? Let's see.\n\nIf at turn T, y_T=9, then T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for T=5, H=1, but y_5=2 not 9.\n\nT=6, H=2, meaning actions at t=5 (sets y_6) and t=6 (sets y_7), but we want y_6=9.\n\nSimilarly, T=7, H=3, actions at t=5,6,7 to set y_6,y_7,y_8, but we want y_7=9.\n\nGenerally, to have y_T=9 at turn T, we need to have applied actions from t=5 to t=T-1 to reach y_T from y_5.\n\nNumber of actions from t=5 to t=T-1 is (T-1) -5 +1 = T-5.\n\nThen H = number of actions = T-5.\n\nBut from the sequence, H actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so for T-5 actions, it sets position from y_6 to y_T.\n\ny_{t_1} = y_5 =2.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, y_{6}\n\nAfter a_{t_1+1}, y_{7}, ..., after a_{t_1 + k}, y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is set by the previous action.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is 9.\n\nTo achieve that, we apply actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -2 to set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}, and no action at t=t_1 + H -1 since it would set y_{t_1 + H}, which is after.\n\nIn the sequence, we apply a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}, so to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need that before applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H -1} is already 9, but that doesn't make sense because we apply actions to change position.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me define the turn when position is set.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and after choosing a_t, we move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe state at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe want for some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT must be >= t_1, since at t_1, y=2.\n\nThe actions are chosen from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, which affect y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions before that have brought us there.\n\nSpecifically, actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -2 determine how we get to y_{t_1 + H -1} from y_{t_1}, and at turn t=t_1 + H -1, we don't need to move if we are already at 9, but we might choose S or something, but since we are at 9, and we want to be at 9, we can choose S, but the position is already 9 at that turn.\n\nIn terms of collision, we care about the position at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to specify actions for H turns, from t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nAfter that, at turn 5+H, position is y_{5+H}, but we want y_{5+H-1} =9.\n\nSo for y_{5+H-1} to be 9, it means that after H-1 actions, we are at y_{5 + (H-1)} = y_{4+H}, which should be 9? Let's set k = H-1.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think that to reach y_T=9 at turn T, we need actions from t=5 to t=T-1, so number of actions is (T-1) - 5 +1 = T-5.\n\nThen H = T-5, and the actions are for t=5 to t=T-1.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list actions for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, which for H=T-5, t_1+H-1 =5 + (T-5) -1 = T-1.\n\nSo actions for t=5 to t=T-1, and position at turn T is y_T=9.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, actions from turn 5 to turn T-1 are applied, with H = T-5 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, which is 5 to (5 + (T-5) -1) = T-1.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} = y_{5 + (T-5)} = y_T =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5 + (T-5) -1} = y_{T-1} to be 9? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 5 + (T-5) -1 = T-1.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{T-1}, which is not necessarily 9.\n\nBut we want y_T=9.\n\nThere's a mismatch.\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd the sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is 9.\n\nFor that to happen, the action at t_1 + H -1 is applied, but it sets y_{t_1 + H}, so to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it must be that before applying the action, it is 9, and the action might change it or not.\n\nBut if we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and we apply a_{t_1 + H -1}, it could be S to stay, or U or D to move away, but we want it to be 9 at that turn, so we should choose S or something, but the position at that turn is already set before the action.\n\nI think the position at turn t is fixed when we start the turn.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, y_t is given, we choose a_t, then for turn t+1, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo the position at turn t is not changed by a_t; a_t changes the next position.\n\nTherefore, to have y_T =9 at some turn T, we need that at the start of turn T, position is 9.\n\nThen, for the sequence, if we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThe actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2 determine how we get to y_{t_1 + H -1} from y_{t_1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we can choose an action, but it doesn't affect y_{t_1 + H -1}, it affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nFor the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9, it is determined by the actions up to t_1 + H -2.\n\nThe action at t_1 + H -1 is chosen, but it only affects future positions.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1}, but it is not necessary for reaching y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, but we have to specify it as part of the H actions.\n\nSince we are at 9, we can choose S.\n\nBut for the minimal H, we need to find the smallest H such that we can be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1 = 4 + H.\n\nFor example, at turn 4+H, position is 9.\n\nSince t_1=5, turn 4+H =5 + (H-1), so at turn 5 + (H-1), y=9.\n\nWith H actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nThe first action a_5 affects y_6, a_6 affects y_7, ..., a_{5+H-2} affects y_{5+H-1}, and a_{5+H-1} affects y_{5+H}.\n\nTo have y_{5+H-1} =9, it is set by a_{5+H-2} if H>1, or if H=1, a_5 affects y_6, but we want y_5=9, which is given as 2, not 9, so H cannot be 1.\n\nFor H=1, we want y_{5+1-1} =y_5=9, but it's 2, impossible.\n\nFor H=2, we want y_{5+2-1} =y_6=9.\n\nSo we need to set y_6=9 with action a_5 from y_5=2.\n\nBut Δy can only be +1, -1, 0, so from y=2, we can go to y=3,1, or2, not directly to 9. So impossible for H=2.\n\nSimilarly, minimal H must be at least the distance, which is 7, from 2 to 9, so at least 7 moves up, but we might need to wait or go down.\n\nSo H min at least 7.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more.\n\nNow back to the cars.\n\nI need to find when it is safe to be on each freeway at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway y=1 to 8, the car positions as a function of time from t=5 onwards.\n\nLet Δt = t - 5, for t >=5.\n\nFor each car, the span at time t is given by the update rules.\n\nCollision if at turn t, player is at row y, and for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn t, player is on row y_t, and after action, on y_{t+1} for turn t+1, so during the move, at turn t, they are on y_t, and only check cars on y_t at turn t.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, so only check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf you move to a different row, at turn T, you are on the old row, not the new one.\n\nSo no issue with the row you are moving to at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find the times when 0 is in some car's span, so it is unsafe to be on that row at that turn.\n\nThen, for the player, we need to ensure that for each turn t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, then at that turn, for row y_t, 0 is not in any car span.\n\nIf y_t=0 or 9, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each y, the unsafe times.\n\nStart with freeway y=1.\n\nAt y=1, two cars:\n\nCar A: right-moving, span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-55, -44], speed 4.\n\nSince right-moving, span at time t: [τ + s(t-5), h + s(t-5)] = [-55 + 4(t-5), -44 + 4(t-5)]\n\nCar B: right-moving, span at t=5: [9,20], speed 4, so [9 + 4(t-5), 20 + 4(t-5)]\n\n0 in span for car A if -55 +4(Δt) <= 0 <= -44 +4(Δt), where Δt = t-5.\n\nSimilarly for car B: 9 +4(Δt) <= 0 <= 20 +4(Δt)\n\nBut 0 <= 20 +4(Δt) always true for t>=5, since 20+4(0)=20>0, and increases.\n\n0 <= 20 +4(Δt) true for all t.\n\nBut 9 +4(Δt) <=0? 9 +4(Δt) <=0 implies 4(Δt) <= -9, Δt <= -9/4 = -2.25, but Δt >=0, so never true. So 9 +4(Δt) >0 for all t>=5, so 0 < 9 +4(Δt) <= 20 +4(Δt), so 0 is not <= left end, so not in span unless left end <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nFor car B, left end 9 +4(Δt) >0 for all t, so 0 < left end, so 0 not in [left, right], so car B never has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, car A: left end -55 +4(Δt), right end -44 +4(Δt)\n\n0 in span if left <=0 and right >=0.\n\nSo -55 +4(Δt) <=0 and -44 +4(Δt) >=0\n\nFirst inequality: -55 +4(Δt) <=0 => 4(Δt) <=55 => Δt <= 55/4 = 13.75, so t <= 5 + 13.75 = 18.75, so t<=18 since turn integer.\n\nSecond inequality: -44 +4(Δt) >=0 => 4(Δt) >=44 => Δt >= 11, t>=16.\n\nSo both: t>=16 and t<=18.\n\nSo for t=16,17,18, 0 in span of car A on y=1.\n\nCar B never, so on y=1, unsafe at t=16,17,18.\n\nt from 5 onwards, Δt= t-5.\n\nt=16: Δt=11, left: -55+44= -11 <=0, right: -44+44=0 >=0, so 0 in span? right=0, so [left, right] includes 0 if closed interval, I assume inclusive.\n\nSimilarly t=17: left -55+48= -7<=0, right -44+48=4>=0\n\nt=18: left -55+52= -3<=0, right -44+52=8>=0\n\nt=19: left -55+56=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo unsafe on y=1 only at t=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway y=2.\n\nOne car: left-moving, head -72, tail -49, direction left, speed 24.\n\nFor left-moving, span [h, τ] at t=5: [-72, -49]\n\nThen at t: [h - s(t-5), τ - s(t-5)] = [-72 -24(Δt), -49 -24(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if h -24(Δt) <=0 and τ -24(Δt) >=0, i.e., -72 -24(Δt) <=0 and -49 -24(Δt) >=0\n\nFirst: -72 -24(Δt) <=0 always true since both negative.\n\nSecond: -49 -24(Δt) >=0? -49 -24(Δt) >=0 implies -24(Δt) >=49, which is impossible since left side negative, right positive. So never true.\n\n-49 -24(Δt) is always negative for Δt>=0, so τ -24(Δt) <0, and h -24(Δt) <0, so 0 not in [h, τ] since both ends negative.\n\nSo on y=2, no car has 0 in span at any time, so always safe.\n\nIs that right? Span [h, τ] = [-72, -49] at t=5, both negative, moving left, so more negative, so 0 never in span.

H actions, from t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nList the actions:\n\nt=5: a_5 = D (to y_6=1)\n\nt=6: a_6 = U (to y_7=2)\n\nt=7: a_7 = U (to y_8=3)\n\nt=8: a_8 = U (to y_9=4)\n\nt=9: a_9 = U (to y_10=5)\n\nt=10: a_10 = U (to y_11=6)\n\nt=11: a_11 = U (to y_12=7)\n\nt=12: a_12 = U (to y_13=8)\n\nt=13: a_13 = U (to y_14=9)\n\nNow, at t=14, y=9, which is what we want.\n\nBut we need to specify actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{13}, and y_{14}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 9 actions? From t=5 to t=13, that's 9 actions: t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nH=9? t from 5 to 13 inclusive, 13-5+1=9 actions.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =5+9-1=13, y_{13} should be 9? But in the above, at t=13, y=8, and a_13=U to y_14=9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{13} =8, not 9.\n\nProblem: we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=13, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the above, we reach y=9 at t=14.\n\nSo for that, t_1 + H -1 =14, so 5 + H -1 =14, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=5 to t=5+10-1=14.\n\na_5 to a_14.\n\nBut a_14 would set y_15, but we don't need to go further.\n\nTo have y_{14}=9, we need to arrive at turn 14.\n\nFrom above, with a_13=U to y_14=9.\n\nSo at turn t=14, y=9.\n\nThen we need H such that t_1 + H -1 =14, 5+H-1=14, H=10.\n\nActions: a_5 to a_{14}, but a_{14} is chosen at turn 14, but since we are at y=9, we can set a_{14}=S or something, but it sets y_{15}, which we don't care.\n\nBut for the sequence, we must specify a_{14}.\n\nSince y_{14}=9, we can choose a_{14}=S to stay.\n\nIn the path above, we have a_5 to a_13 to get to y_14=9.\n\na_13 is at turn 13, sets y_14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we are at y=9, and we need to specify a_{14}.\n\nWe can set a_{14}=S, so y_{15}=9, but since we only care about reaching at t=14, it's fine.\n\nNow, back to the path: we went down to y=1 at t=6, then up slowly.\n\nBut we could stay at y=2 at t=6, then go up.\n\nSimilarly, from y_6=2, a_6=U to y_7=3? At t=7, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen a_7=U to y_8=4, safe, and so on, to y_13=8 at t=13, then a_13=U to y_14=9 at t=14.\n\nSame as before, but we skipped going down.\n\nStart: t=5, y=2\n\na_5=S, to y_6=2 (safe)\n\nThen a_6=U, to y_7=3 (safe, since t=7>6)\n\na_7=U, to y_8=4\n\na_8=U, to y_9=5\n\na_9=U, to y_10=6\n\na_10=U, to y_11=7\n\na_11=U, to y_12=8? y_12=8 at t=12.\n\nBut y=8 at t=12: unsafe times 6,7,8,16,17,18; t=12 not in, so safe.\n\nThen a_12=U, to y_13=9? y_13=9 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, y=9.\n\nNow, if we want y_{t_1 + H -1}=9 at t=13, so 5 + H -1 =13, H=9.\n\nActions: a_5 to a_{12}? t from 5 to t_1 + H -1 =13? Actions for t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nH=9, t_1 + H -1=5+9-1=13.\n\ny_{13}=9.\n\nIn this case, with a_5=S (y_6=2), a_6=U (y_7=3), a_7=U (y_8=4), a_8=U (y_9=5), a_9=U (y_10=6), a_10=U (y_11=7), a_11=U (y_12=8), a_12=U (y_13=9).\n\nNow at t=13, y=9.\n\nWe need actions up to a_{12}, since t_1 + H -1=13, actions from t=5 to t=12? t=5 to t=12 inclusive is 8 actions, but H=9?\n\nt from 5 to 13? Let's list:\n\nActions: a_5 (t=5), a_6 (t=6), a_7 (t=7), a_8 (t=8), a_9 (t=9), a_10 (t=10), a_11 (t=11), a_12 (t=12)\n\nThat's 8 actions, from t=5 to t=12.\n\nAfter these, at turn t=13, position is y_{13}=9.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =13, t_1=5, so 5 + H -1 =13, thus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions for t=5 to t=5+9-1=13? t_1 to t_1+H-1, so for H=9, t from 5 to 5+8=13? t_1 + H -1 =5+9-1=13.\n\nSo actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a_5 to a_12, which are 8 actions, setting up to y_{13}=9.\n\nThen at turn t=13, we are at y=9, and we need to specify a_{13}, which we can set to S, for example.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\na_5: S (stay at y=2 for t=6)\n\na_6: U (to y=3 at t=7)\n\na_7: U (to y=4 at t=8)\n\na_8: U (to y=5 at t=9)\n\na_9: U (to y=6 at t=10)\n\na_10: U (to y=7 at t=11)\n\na_11: U (to y=8 at t=12)\n\na_12: U (to y=9 at t=13)\n\nThen at t=13, y=9, and for a_{13}, we can choose S, so y_{14}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a_5 to a_{13} for H=9.\n\nt=5 to t=13: actions at 9 turns.\n\nIn the path, a_12 sets y_{13}=9, so at turn t=13, position is 9.\n\nThen a_{13} is chosen, but doesn't affect position at t=13.\n\nNow, is this safe? Let's verify the positions at each turn.\n\nt=5: y=2, safe (y=2 always safe)\n\nAction a_5=S, so y_6=2\n\nt=6: y=2, safe\n\nAction a_6=U, so y_7=3\n\nt=7: y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at t=6, t=7 safe, yes.\n\nAction a_7=U, y_8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, unsafe only at t=6, t=8 safe.\n\nAction a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, safe (unsafe only t=6)\n\nAction a_9=U, y_10=6\n\nt=10: y=6, safe\n\nAction a_10=U, y_11=7\n\nt=11: y=7, safe (unsafe only t=6)\n\nAction a_11=U, y_12=8\n\nt=12: y=8, now y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8,16,17,18. t=12 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_12=U, y_13=9\n\nt=13: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nNow, for the action at t=13, a_13, we can set it to S, so y_14=9, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, since H=9, we need a_{13}.\n\nNow, is there a faster way? H=9, reaching at t=13.\n\nBut earlier I thought min 7, but due to cars, we had to avoid t=6 for y=3-7.\n\nCould we go faster?\n\nFor example, from t=5, if we go down to y=1 at t=6, then we are lower, so it takes more turns to go up.\n\nIn the above, by staying at y=2 at t=6, we started going up from t=7.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=5, we go up, but to y=3 at t=6 is unsafe, not possible.\n\nGo to y=8 directly? But we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nPerhaps at t=6, we can be on y=8, but from y=2 at t=5, we can only go to y=1,2,3 at t=6.\n\ny=3 unsafe, so not.\n\nAfter t=6, we can move faster, but we need to go through each row.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, but we start from t=5 position, to reach at some turn.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, we could be at y=9 at t=12: t=5 y=2, a_5=U y6=3, a6=U y7=4, ..., a11=U y12=9.\n\nBut at t=6, y=3 unsafe, so not possible.\n\nNext, if we stay at t=6, y=2, then a6=U to y7=3 at t=7, which is safe, then a7=U to y8=4 at t=8, ..., up to a11=U to y12=8 at t=12, then a12=U to y13=9 at t=13, same as before.\n\na11=U to y12=8 at t=12, then at t=12, y=8, which is safe, then a12=U to y13=9.\n\nReach at t=13.\n\nCould we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we could be on y=8 at t=11 or something.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=5, to y=8, need 6 up moves.\n\nBut at t=6, if we are not moving up, we start later.\n\nSuppose at t=5, a5=S to y6=2\n\nThen a6=U to y7=3\n\na7=U to y8=4\n\nBut we can move faster? No, only one per turn.\n\nPerhaps skip some rows by moving down, but that would take more turns.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is unsafe at t=6,7,8, but at t=9 safe, so we can arrive at y=8 at t=9 or later.\n\nIn the path above, we arrive at y=8 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nBut can we arrive earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster after t=6.\n\nAt t=5, a5=S, y6=2\n\nt=6: y=2, a6=U to y7=3\n\nt=7: y=3, a7=U to y8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, a8=U to y9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, a9=U to y10=6\n\nt=10: y=6, a10=U to y11=7\n\nt=11: y=7, a11=U to y12=8\n\nt=12: y=8, a12=U to y13=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom t=7, y=3, we could go up to y=4 at t=8, etc., no faster.\n\nBut at t=5, if we go down to y=1, then it takes longer: y6=1, a6=U to y7=2, a7=U to y8=3, ..., then y13=8, y14=9, reach at t=14, worse.\n\nSo staying or going down at t=6 is similar, but staying is better.\n\nGoing down takes an extra step down, then need to come back.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, reaching at t=13.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have 9 actions: from t=5 to t=13.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a5 to a12, that's 8 actions, to reach y13=9 at t=13.\n\nThen we need a13 as well.\n\nSo for H=9, actions at t=5 to t=13.\n\na5: S\n\na6: U\n\na7: U\n\na8: U\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\na11: U\n\na12: U (to y13=9)\n\nThen a13: S (say, to stay)\n\nBut y13=9 is already reached at t=13.\n\nNow, to confirm, at no point do we collide.\n\nt=5: y=2, safe\n\nt=6: y=2, safe\n\nt=7: y=3, safe (t=7 !=6)\n\nt=8: y=4, safe\n\nt=9: y=5, safe\n\nt=10: y=6, safe\n\nt=11: y=7, safe\n\nt=12: y=8, safe (t=12 not 6-8 or 16-18)\n\nt=13: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=8?\n\nH=8, then t_1 + H -1 =5+8-1=12, so we need y_{12}=9.\n\nCan we reach y=9 at t=12?\n\nFrom y=2 at t=5, to y=9 at t=12, that would require 7 up moves in 7 turns: from t=5 to t=11 actions to set y6 to y12.\n\ny6 to y12: 7 positions, from y=3 to y=9? Start at t=5 y=2.\n\nAfter a5, y6\n\n...\n\nAfter a11, y12\n\nTo have y12=9, we need to go up 7 times from y=2.\n\nSo actions a5=U to y6=3, a6=U to y7=4, ..., a11=U to y12=9.\n\nBut at t=6, y=3, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we start later, but we need y12=9, so we must have moved up between t=5 and t=11.\n\nBut at t=6, if we are on y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf we are not on y=3 at t=6, but to reach y=9 by t=12, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=6, if we are at y=2, then we need to go from y=2 to y=9 in 6 moves (from t=6 to t=11 actions setting y7 to y12).\n\ny7 to y12: 6 positions, from y=2 to y=9 requires 7 steps, impossible in 6 moves? From y=2 to y=9, delta y=7, so need 7 up moves.\n\nWith 6 actions, we can reach at most y=2 +6=8 if all up, but not 9.\n\nActions: from y6 at t=6 to y12 at t=12.\n\ny6 to y7: one action, etc., up to y11 to y12: one action.\n\nNumber of actions from t=6 to t=11 to set y7 to y12: that's 6 actions.\n\nFrom y6, after 6 actions, y_{12} = y6 + sum Δy.\n\nTo reach y12=9, with y6 <=2? At t=6, y6 could be 1,2, or3 but unsafe.\n\nIf y6=2, then max y12=2+6=8 with all up.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y6=1, max y12=1+6=7.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf we were at y=3 at t=6, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 by t=12.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier turns.\n\nThus, minimal to reach at t=13 with H=9.\n\nBut H=9 actions from t=5 to t=13.\n\nIn the sequence, we can output.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, a13 is needed but can be S.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the actions.\n\nSince we reach at t=13, and H=9.\n\nAnother thing: at t=13, y=9, we can choose any action, but since it's the last, S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, we used all U except first S.\n\nBut we could have different paths, but this seems minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly without staying.\n\nFor example, from t=5, a5=D to y6=1 (safe)\n\nThen a6=U to y7=2\n\na7=U to y8=3\n\netc., but then y8=3 at t=8, safe, but we reach later, as before.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the path with a5=S, then all U is better.\n\nNow, about y=8: in this path, we are on y=8 at t=12, which is safe.\n\nBut y=8 also unsafe at t=16-18, but t=12 is fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, H=9, actions:\n\nTurn t_1: S  (which is a_{t_1} = a_5 = S)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U  (a_6 = U)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 8: U  (a_{13} = ?)\n\nt from 0 to H-1=8.\n\nSo t=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_5\n\nt=1: a_6\n\n...\n\nt=8: a_{t_1 +8} = a_{13}\n\nIn the sequence, a_5 to a_{13}.\n\na_5: S\n\na_6: U\n\na_7: U\n\na_8: U\n\na_9: U\n\na_10: U\n\na_11: U\n\na_12: U\n\na_{13}: ? we can set to S\n\nBut in the action, a_{13} at turn 13 sets y_{14}, but since we are at y=9, S is fine.\n\nTo save, we could have reached earlier, but not possible.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{12} is U to y_{13}=9, so at turn 13, we are at 9, and a_{13} can be anything, but we must specify.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to write for each turn.\n\nAlso, the player position at turn t_1 + H -1 =13 is 9.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S  (for example)\n\nBut in terms of the turn labels.\n\nSince t_1=5, we list Turn t_1: action, etc.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nH=9 turns of actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? We saw not.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at an earlier safe time.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so earliest safe at t=9.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 at t=10.\n\nThen y_{10}=9 at turn 10.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1=10, 5+H-1=10, H=6.\n\nBut is it possible?\n\nStart at t=5, y=2.\n\nNeed to be at y=8 at t=9? At turn t=9, y=8.\n\nThen from t=5 to t=8 actions to go from y=2 to y=8 in 4 moves? Delta y=6, with 4 actions, impossible.\n\nActions: a5 sets y6, a6 sets y7, a7 sets y8, a8 sets y9.\n\nTo have y9=8, for example.\n\nBut we want y8=8 at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, y=8.\n\nSet by actions up to a7.\n\na5 sets y6, a6 sets y7, a7 sets y8.\n\nWith 3 actions, from y5=2 to y8.\n\nMax delta y=3, so y8<=5, cannot be 8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn 9: a5 to a8 set y6 to y9.\n\ny9=8, with 4 actions, from y5=2, min y9=2-4=-2<0, max 2+4=6<8, cannot reach y=8 or 9.\n\ny9 <= 2+4=6.\n\nTo reach y=9, need more turns.\n\nEarliest possible reach at t=13 as before.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, we can write the actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nAlso, for a_{13}, since we are at y=9, we can choose S, but U or D would move away, but since we reached, S is fine.\n\nTo be consistent, S.\n\nNow, write.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\), while avoiding collisions with cars, is 9. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\(y=2\\). To avoid being on rows \\(y=3\\) to \\(y=7\\) at turn 6 (which are unsafe due to cars), the action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen, resulting in \\(y_6 = 2\\).\n- From turn 6 onwards, the player moves up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y=9\\) as quickly as possible, given the car constraints.\n- The position \\(y=8\\) is safe at turn 12, as the unsafe times for row 8 are turns 6-8 and 16-18.\n- After moving up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 13, the action at turn 13 is \\(S\\) (stay) to remain at \\(y=9\\), as the goal is achieved.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 5\\) to \\(13\\) is:\n\n- Turn 5: \\(S\\) (results in \\(y_6 = 2\\), safe)\n- Turn 6: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_7 = 3\\), safe since \\(y=3\\) unsafe only at turn 6)\n- Turn 7: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_8 = 4\\), safe)\n- Turn 8: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_9 = 5\\), safe)\n- Turn 9: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_{10} = 6\\), safe)\n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_{11} = 7\\), safe)\n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_{12} = 8\\), safe since \\(y=8\\) unsafe only at turns 6-8 and 16-18)\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) (results in \\(y_{13} = 9\\), goal reached)\n- Turn 13: \\(S\\) (action chosen since at \\(y=9\\), but not necessary for reaching goal)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as verified by the car positions and unsafe times for each row. Reaching \\(y=9\\) by turn 12 is impossible due to the unsafe conditions at turn 6 and the need for 7 upward moves from \\(y=2\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 6. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and their positions change over time based on their speed and direction. Collision occurs if at any turn T, when the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k), and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that exact turn T.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new row, they are not considered on that new row until the next turn. So, for example, if at turn T, I move from y_T to y_{T+1}, I am on y_T at turn T, and I only check for cars on y_T at turn T. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=6. I need to find the car positions at future turns based on their movement rules.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their states at t=6.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\n- Car 1: head -40, tail -51, direction right, speed 4. Since direction is right, head should be greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h? Let me check the update rule.\n\nThe car update rule says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, so it goes from τ to h.\n\nIn the data, for freeway 1, first car: (-40, -51, right, 4). But -40 and -51, since direction is right, span should be [τ, h] = [-51, -40]? But it says head and tail, and in the tuple it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nThere might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for freeway 1, it says \"(-40, -51, right, 4)\". But in the direction, for right-moving, the head is supposed to be the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so larger x.\n\nBut here, -40 and -51, -40 is larger than -51, so if right-moving, head should be -40, tail -51, so span is [tail, head] = [-51, -40].\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: (24, 13, right, 4). 24 and 13, 24 > 13, so if right-moving, head=24, tail=13, span [13,24].\n\nBut direction is right, so for (24,13,right,4), if head=24, tail=13, that makes sense for right-moving, span [13,24].\n\nSimilarly, first car (-40,-51,right,4), head=-40, tail=-51, so span [-51,-40].\n\nNow for left-moving, it should be head and tail with head < tail or something.\n\nIn freeway 2: (48,71,left,24). Direction left, so for left-moving, span should be [h, τ] with h > τ? Update rule says for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIn this case, (48,71,left,24), 48 and 71, 71 > 48, so if head is 71, tail 48, but for left-moving, the head should be on the left, so smaller x if moving left.\n\nI think there's ambiguity in how head and tail are defined.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should look at the span definition.\n\nFor a car, the span is the interval it occupies.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, meaning from left to right, τ left end, h right end.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ? The notation says [h, τ] for left-moving, and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn freeway 2: (48,71,left,24). It says head, tail, but 48 and 71, with direction left.\n\nIf direction left, and it's moving left, the head should be at smaller x. But 48 and 71, 48 < 71, so if head is 48, tail is 71, that would mean head at 48, tail at 71, but since moving left, head should be on the left, so if x decreases, head should be smaller, so if head=48, tail=71, but 48<71, so the car is from 48 to 71, and moving left, so the left end is head at 48, and it moves left, so head decreases.\n\nThe update rule for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], with initial [h, τ] at t_1.\n\nFor freeway 2 car: (48,71,left,24), so let's assume the first number is h, second is τ for left-moving? But in the tuple it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but head and tail might not be consistent.\n\nI need to interpret based on direction.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are misnomers; it's better to think of the span endpoints.\n\nFor each car, based on direction, the span is defined.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ? The notation says for left-moving: [h, τ], and for right-moving: [τ, h].\n\nIn the data, for freeway 1, first car: (-40, -51, right, 4), so for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] = [-51, -40] since -51 < -40.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24, 13, right, 4), 24 and 13, 13<24, so [13,24]? But it says head 24, tail 13, so tail is left, head is right for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (48,71,left,24), and direction left, so for left-moving, span should be [h, τ] with h and τ such that h > τ for the interval.\n\n48 and 71, 48<71, so if it's [h, τ], and h>τ, but 48<71, so it must be that for left-moving, the first number is the head (left end), second is tail (right end), so h=48, τ=71, but h<τ, which is inconsistent with h>τ in the notation.\n\nLet's read the update rule carefully.\n\nIt says for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then \"Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor this to make sense, if the car is moving left, both endpoints decrease, so h and τ should be such that h is the left end, τ is the right end, so h < τ, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 2: (48,71,left,24), so h=48, τ=71, with h=48 < τ=71, so span [48,71], and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" with τ < h, both increase when moving right.\n\nIn freeway 1, first car: for right-moving, (head, tail) given as (-40, -51), but for right-moving, it should be [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, so τ=-51, h=-40, so [-51, -40].\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4), so head=24, tail=13, so τ=13, h=24, [13,24].\n\nFor freeway 3: (24, -11, right, 36), so τ=-11, h=24, [-11,24].\n\nFreeway 4: (0, -11, right, 12), τ=-11, h=0, [-11,0].\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (0,-11,right,12), [-11,0].\n\nFreeway 6: same, (0,-11,right,12), [-11,0].\n\nFreeway 7: (24,-11,right,36), [-11,24].\n\nFreeway 8: three cars: (-40,-51,right,4), so τ=-51, h=-40, [-51,-40]; (36,25,right,4), head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36, [25,36]; and (0,-11,right,4), τ=-11, h=0, [-11,0].\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is within the span of any car on freeway k at that turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y increases up to 9, and we start at 2, we need to move up, but we can move down or stay to avoid cars, but since the goal is above, down might not help, but we might need to wait sometimes.\n\nMinimal H, so probably want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find out when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to compute for each freeway and each turn, if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k and turn T (relative to t_1=6, so let Δt = T - t_1, so at turn T, time from start is Δt).\n\nt_1=6, so for turn T, Δt = T - 6.\n\nThen for a car, its span at T depends on its direction and speed.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nFor right-moving car: span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nThen, for freeway k, at turn T, there is a collision if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [low, high] for that span.\n\nThat is, low <= 0 <= high.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\n- Car A: left-moving? No, both are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: both right-moving.\n\nFirst car: at t_1, [τ,h] = [-51, -40], s=4, right-moving.\n\nAt turn T, span: [ -51 + 4*Δt, -40 + 4*Δt ]\n\nSecond car: [13,24] at t_1, s=4, right-moving, so at T: [13 + 4*Δt, 24 + 4*Δt]\n\nFor collision on y=1 at turn T: if 0 in [ -51 +4Δt, -40+4Δt ] or 0 in [13+4Δt, 24+4Δt]\n\nFirst interval: -51 +4Δt <= 0 <= -40 +4Δt\n\nSince -51 +4Δt <=0 implies Δt <= 51/4 = 12.75, so t<=18.75, but since turn integer, t<=18\n\nAnd 0 <= -40 +4Δt implies 40 <=4Δt, Δt >=10\n\nSimilarly, second interval: 13+4Δt <=0 <=24+4Δt? 13+4Δt <=0 implies Δt <= -13/4 = -3.25, impossible since Δt>=0. So never for second car since min x=13>0.\n\nSo for y=1, collision only possible from first car when 10 <= Δt <= 18\n\nΔt >=10 and Δt <=18.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): one car (48,71,left,24)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, span [h,τ] = [48,71], s=24\n\nAt T, [48 -24Δt, 71 -24Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [48-24Δt, 71-24Δt]\n\nSo 48-24Δt <= 0 <= 71-24Δt\n\nFirst, 48-24Δt <=0 => 24Δt >=48 => Δt >=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= 71-24Δt => 24Δt <=71 => Δt <=71/24≈2.958, so Δt <=2 since integer turns.\n\nΔt >=2 and Δt <=2.958, so for integer Δt, only possible at Δt=2.\n\nAt Δt=2, span: [48-24*2, 71-24*2] = [48-48, 71-48] = [0,23], so 0 is included, yes collision.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=6, which is Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, on y=2, car span [48,71], 48 to 71, 0 not in, so safe at t=6 on y=2.\n\nBut at turn T=6+2=8, if on y=2, collision.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): car (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nRight-moving, so at t_1, [τ,h] = [-11,24], s=36\n\nAt T, [-11 +36Δt, 24 +36Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-11+36Δt, 24+36Δt]\n\n-11+36Δt <=0 <=24+36Δt\n\nLeft: -11+36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/36≈0.305, so Δt=0 only? Δt=0: -11<=0<=24, 0 in [-11,24]? -11<=0<=24 yes, so at Δt=0, collision.\n\nRight: 0<=24+36Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nSo collision at Δt=0 only? -11+36Δt <=0 implies Δt <=11/36<1, so for Δt=0, -11<=0<=24 true.\n\nFor Δt=1, [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nSo on y=3, collision only at Δt=0.\n\nBut Δt=0 is turn t=6.\n\nPlayer is at y=2 at t=6, not on y=3 yet.\n\nBut if we go to y=3 at some turn, we need to check at that turn.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): car (0,-11,right,12)\n\nRight-moving, [τ,h] = [-11,0], s=12\n\nAt T, [-11 +12Δt, 0 +12Δt] = [-11+12Δt, 12Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-11+12Δt, 12Δt]\n\n-11+12Δt <=0 <=12Δt\n\nLeft: -11+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/12<1, so Δt=0\n\nAt Δt=0, [-11,0], 0 in, yes.\n\nRight: 0<=12Δt always for Δt>=0.\n\nSo collision only at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same as 4, car (0,-11,right,12), collision only at Δt=0.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, collision only at Δt=0.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): car (24,-11,right,36), same as freeway 3, [τ,h]=[-11,24] at t_1, collision only at Δt=0.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): three cars\n\nFirst car: (-40,-51,right,4) so [τ,h] = [-51,-40], s=4, at T: [-51+4Δt, -40+4Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-51+4Δt, -40+4Δt]\n\n-51+4Δt <=0 <= -40+4Δt\n\nLeft: -51+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=51 => Δt <=12.75, t<=18\n\nRight: 0 <= -40+4Δt => 40 <=4Δt => Δt >=10\n\nSo 10<= Δt <=18\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4) head=36, tail=25, so [τ,h] = [25,36], s=4, at T: [25+4Δt, 36+4Δt], min x=25>0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,4) [τ,h] = [-11,0], s=4, at T: [-11+4Δt, 0+4Δt] = [-11+4Δt, 4Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-11+4Δt, 4Δt]\n\n-11+4Δt <=0 <=4Δt\n\nLeft: -11+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/4=2.75, so Δt<=2\n\nRight: 0<=4Δt always for Δt>=0.\n\nSo for Δt=0,1,2.\n\nAt Δt=0: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=3: [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow for freeway 8, collision possible from first car when 10<=Δt<=18, and from third car when 0<=Δt<=2.\n\nΔt=0,1,2.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when collision occurs (at x=0):\n\ny=1: collision when Δt between 10 and 18 inclusive (from first car)\n\ny=2: collision only at Δt=2 (turn t=8)\n\ny=3: collision only at Δt=0 (t=6)\n\ny=4: collision only at Δt=0 (t=6)\n\ny=5: collision only at Δt=0 (t=6)\n\ny=6: collision only at Δt=0 (t=6)\n\ny=7: collision only at Δt=0 (t=6)\n\ny=8: collision when Δt between 0 and 2 inclusive (from third car), or between 10 and 18 (from first car)\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2) at t=6, which is Δt=0.\n\nAt t=6, y=2: from above, y=2 has collision only at Δt=2, not at Δt=0, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, so safe always.\n\nThe player can move to y=9 and be safe.\n\nBut we start at y=2, need to go to y=9, difference 7, so minimum 7 moves up, but we might need to wait or avoid rows at certain times.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down might not help since goal is up.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when collision happens.\n\nThe sequence: at each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y.\n\nWe start at y=2 at t=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote turns from t=6 onwards.\n\nTurn t=6: y=2, safe as above.\n\nNow, possible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up to y=3, but at t=6, if we go to y=3 at turn t=6? No.\n\nAt turn t=6, we are on y=2. After action, we move to new y at next turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe perform action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd we check collision at turn T for row y_T, and at turn T+1 for row y_{T+1}, etc.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on being on row k at that turn, and cars on k at that turn.\n\nStart: t=6, y=2, safe as above.\n\nNow, after action at t=6, we go to y at t=7.\n\nWe need to choose a_{t_1} = a_6.\n\nSimilarly, then a_7, and so on.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 at some turn H, so y_{t_1 + H-1} =9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nt_1=6, we start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we reach at turn t_1 + (H-1) to position (0,9).\n\nSequence of actions from t=6 to t=6+H-2, and after H-1 actions, at turn t=6 + (H-1), we have y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, no action, but at t=6, y=2 ≠9, not goal.\n\nH is minimal number of turns from start to reach, including the start or not?\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nWith actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 for the index in the sequence.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k, turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want at some τ, y_τ =9.\n\nτ = H-1 when we reach.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, with actions at τ=0 to τ=H-2? Let's think.\n\nAt time τ=0 (turn t_1), we have position.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1} at τ=0, which determines y at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, take action a_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action at τ=k, we are at y_{k+1} at time τ=k+1.\n\nSet: at turn T, for T=t_1, t_1+1, ...\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy(a_T)\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at T= t_1=6, y_6=2.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is a_6, a_7, ..., up to a_{T-1} for when we reach at T.\n\nIf we reach at T, then we have actions from t=6 to t=T-1, so number of actions is (T - t_1), and T - t_1 = H-1? Since at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if we can reach at T=6, but y=2≠9, not possible.\n\nMinimal T when y_T=9.\n\nSince we need to increase y from 2 to 9, minimum 7 steps up, so T >= 6+7 =13? Not necessarily, because we can move up multiple times, but each action changes y by at most 1, so to go from 2 to 9, we need at least 7 up moves, so the earliest we can reach y=9 is at turn t=6+7=13, if we move up every turn.\n\nBut we might have to stay or move down, so it could be later.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, so if we reach at turn T, H = T - t_1 +1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at start.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 +1, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen H = k+1? The number of turns is k+1, from t_1 to t_1+k.\n\nThe reach turn is t_1 + H -1, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + k, so H-1 = k, thus H = k+1, and actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + k -1? Messy.\n\nDefine: let S = T - t_1, time from start.\n\nAt S=0, turn t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter action at S, we go to y at S+1.\n\nWe want y_S =9 for some S.\n\nMinimal S such that we can achieve y_S=9 with a sequence of actions.\n\nThen H = S +1? Since from S=0 to S, there are S+1 turns.\n\nReach at turn t_1 + S, so t_1 + S = t_1 + (H-1), so S = H-1.\n\nThus H-1 = S, so number of turns H, reach at S = H-1.\n\nActions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + S -1, for S steps? Let's not complicate.\n\nI'll work with S = time elapsed, S=0,1,2,... at turn t=6+S.\n\ny_S at turn 6+S.\n\nStart S=0, y=2.\n\nAction a_S at S determines y_{S+1}.\n\nWe want y_S =9 for some S.\n\nMin S.\n\nTo reach y=9, since start y=2, we need net +7 in y, so S >=7.\n\nMin S=7 if we move up every step.\n\nBut may not be possible due to collisions.\n\nNow, at each step, when we are on a row, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nFor example, at S=0, on y=2, safe.\n\nNow, we choose action for S=0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, go to y=3 at S=1.\n\nIf D, go to y=1 at S=1.\n\nIf S, stay y=2 at S=1.\n\nNow, we need to see for each row when it is unsafe.\n\nFrom above:\n\nRow y=1: unsafe for S from 10 to 18 inclusive (since Δt=S, as S is time from t_1)\n\nS=Δt.\n\ny=1: unsafe when S=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18\n\ny=2: unsafe only at S=2 (turn t=8)\n\ny=3: unsafe only at S=0\n\ny=4: unsafe only at S=0\n\ny=5: unsafe only at S=0\n\ny=6: unsafe only at S=0\n\ny=7: unsafe only at S=0\n\ny=8: unsafe when S=0,1,2 (from third car) and S=10 to 18 (from first car)\n\ny=9: always safe.\n\nNow, S=0 is turn t=6, we are on y=2, which is safe, and rows 3-7 are unsafe at S=0, but we are not on them.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nSince rows 3,4,5,6,7 are unsafe only at S=0, which is past, for S>=1, they are safe, except y=1 and y=2 and y=8 have issues later.\n\ny=3: unsafe only at S=0, so for S>=1, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6,7 unsafe only at S=0, so for S>=1, all safe.\n\ny=2 unsafe at S=2.\n\ny=1 unsafe S=10 to 18.\n\ny=8 unsafe S=0,1,2 and 10-18.\n\nSince we start at S=0, y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize S, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe rows at wrong times.\n\nNow, the critical part is y=8, which is unsafe for S=1 and S=2, and also later.\n\nAlso, if we go to y=1, it is unsafe later, but we may not need to.\n\nSince rows 3-7 are safe for S>=1, we can go through them quickly.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some point, then move to y=9.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at S=1 and S=2.\n\nS=1 is turn t=7, S=2 is t=8.\n\nNow, let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, if we go up directly.\n\nAt S=0, on y=2.\n\nAction U: go to y=3 at S=1.\n\nAt S=1, on y=3. Since S=1>=1, y=3 is safe (only unsafe at S=0).\n\nSimilarly, then from y=3, action U to y=4 at S=2.\n\nAt S=2, on y=4, safe for S>=1.\n\nSimilarly, to y=5 at S=3, y=6 at S=4, y=7 at S=5, y=8 at S=6, then to y=9 at S=7.\n\nBut at S=6, we are on y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 is unsafe when? At S=6, is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at S=0,1,2 and 10-18.\n\nS=6 not in 0,1,2,10-18, so S=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, S=7 on y=9 safe.\n\nSo we can reach at S=7 with all U actions.\n\nS=7, y=7 at S=7? Let's list:\n\nS: turn, y_S\n\nS=0: y=2\n\nAfter action U: S=1, y=3\n\nAction U: S=2, y=4\n\nU: S=3, y=5\n\nU: S=4, y=6\n\nU: S=5, y=7\n\nU: S=6, y=8\n\nThen at S=6, on y=8, which is safe since S=6 not unsafe time.\n\nThen action U: S=7, y=9, reach.\n\nActions: from S=0 to S=6, actions a_S to go to next y.\n\nAt S=0, action to go to y at S=1.\n\na_0: U to y=3 at S=1\n\na_1: U to y=4 at S=2\n\na_2: U to y=5 at S=3\n\na_3: U to y=6 at S=4\n\na_4: U to y=7 at S=5\n\na_5: U to y=8 at S=6\n\na_6: U to y=9 at S=7\n\nReach at S=7.\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nTurn t=6 (S=0): on y=2, safe as before.\n\nTurn t=7 (S=1): on y=3, S=1, y=3 safe (only unsafe at S=0)\n\nTurn t=8 (S=2): on y=4, S=2, y=4 safe for S>=1\n\nt=9 (S=3): on y=5, safe\n\nt=10 (S=4): on y=6, safe\n\nt=11 (S=5): on y=7, safe\n\nt=12 (S=6): on y=8, S=6, y=8 unsafe only at S=0,1,2,10-18; S=6 not in, so safe.\n\nt=13 (S=7): on y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good, and S=7 is minimal since 7 steps up needed.\n\nBut is there a problem? y=8 at S=6 is safe, yes.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=8 unsafe at S=0,1,2 and 10-18, S=6 is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we go to y=8 at S=6, which is safe.\n\nBut what about at S=1 and S=2, we are on y=3 and y=4, safe.\n\nIs there any need to go slower?\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? No, S=7 is minimum because from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, each +1, so S=7 is earliest possible.\n\nWith stay or down, it would take more turns, so H larger.\n\nIn this case, with all U, we can reach at S=7 without issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=8 at S=6.\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nAt S=6, Δt=6.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, [-51 +4*6, -40 +4*6] = [-51+24, -40+24] = [-27, -16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+4*6, 36+4*6] = [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nThird car: [-11+4*6, 0+4*6] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo no car covers x=0 at S=6 on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, other rows at their times.\n\ny=2 at S=0: car on y=2, at Δt=0, span [48,71] for left-moving? Freeway 2: car (48,71,left,24), at Δt=0, [48,71], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt S=2, if we were on y=2, unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we are not on y=2 at S=2.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the action sequence.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=12, for S=0 to S=6 actions, reach at t=13.\n\nt=6: action a_6\n\nAfter a_6, to y at t=7.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t=6 to t=12.\n\nThen at t=13, y=9.\n\nH: number of turns from start to reach.\n\nAt t=6, turn 0.\n\nAfter 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=6.\n\nAfter 1st action (at t=6), to t=7, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=6+k.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=6+S, with S=7, so after 7 actions? At S=0, no action yet.\n\nAt t=6, we can take action.\n\nAfter taking action at t, we are at new y at t+1.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at time T.\n\nSet T = t_1 + K, so at turn T=6+K, y=9.\n\nThen we took K actions: at t=6,7,...,5+K? Actions at t=6 to t=6+K-1.\n\nFor K=7, actions at t=6 to t=12, reach at t=13.\n\nH: the minimal number of turns.\n\nFrom turn t=6 to t=13, that's 8 turns? Turns: t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: 8 turns.\n\nBut at t=6, we start, and at t=13 we reach.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=6 to t=13 inclusive is 8 turns.\n\nBut H should be the number of turns taken to reach, including start or not?\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n\"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nt_1 + H -1 =13, t_1=6, so 6 + H -1 =13, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nSequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-2? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, but actions.\n\nIt says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nBut in the answer format, it shows Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to when?\n\nFor example, if H=8, reach at t_1 + H -1 =6+7=13? t_1 + H -1=13, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H - 2? Since actions at each turn from start to the turn before reach.\n\nIn the sequence, it should have H-1 actions, from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H - 2.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, for us, reach at t=13, t_1=6, so t_1 + H -1=13, 6 + H -1=13, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=12, that's 7 actions.\n\nSequence: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-2? t from 0 to 6? Let's index.\n\nSet t' = 0 to H-2 for actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but H-1 actions? Inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nBut if t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nBut after H actions, we should be at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, after H-1 actions.\n\nThus the sequence should have H-1 actions, from t=0 to H-2? Messy.\n\nPerhaps the index t in the sequence is from 0 to H-2 for the actions.\n\nBut the notation says t=0 to H-1.\n\nAssume for now.\n\nIn our case, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12: 7 actions.\n\nReach at t=13.\n\nt_1=6, t_1 + H -1=13, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nSequence for t from 0 to H-1=7, but that would be 8 actions? t=0 to 7.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_6\n\nt=1: a_7\n\n...\n\nt=6: a_{12}\n\nt=7: a_{13}, but at t=13, we reach, no action needed? Action at t=13 would affect y at t=14, but we reach at t=13.\n\nThe sequence should be actions taken until the turn before reaching.\n\nSo actions at t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H - 2.\n\nFor H=8, actions from t=6 to t=6+8-2=12, yes t=6 to 12.\n\nAnd {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-2? t from 0 to 6, since H-2=6 for t=0 to 6, 7 actions.\n\nt=0: a_6, t=1: a_7, ..., t=6: a_{12}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + (H-1) =6+7=13, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it says Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc., so for each turn, we output the action.\n\nIn this case, for turn t=6: action U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nAnd at t=13, y=9.\n\nBut at t=12, action U to go from y=8 to y=9 at t=13.\n\nIn the sequence above, at S=6, t=12, on y=8, action U to y=9 at S=7, t=13.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is this possible? Earlier I thought yes, but let me double-check if at any point we are on unsafe row.\n\nt=6 (S=0): y=2, safe\n\nt=7 (S=1): y=3, safe (since y=3 unsafe only at S=0)\n\nt=8 (S=2): y=4, safe\n\nt=9 (S=3): y=5, safe\n\nt=10 (S=4): y=6, safe\n\nt=11 (S=5): y=7, safe\n\nt=12 (S=6): y=8, safe as above\n\nt=13 (S=7): y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut what about y=2 at S=2? We are not on it.\n\nIn this path, we never use y=1 or stay, so no issue.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot do this? y=8 at S=6 is safe, but later at S=10 to 18 it is unsafe, but we are not there later.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if we can go faster, but no, S=7 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at S=7 with different actions, but same.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car that might be issue, but at S=6, not.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to a row, we are not on it until the next turn, so no issue.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut why is the problem given? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nLook at y=2: unsafe at S=2.\n\nIn our path, at S=2, we are on y=4, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 unsafe later, but we don't go there.\n\ny=8 unsafe at S=1 and S=2, but we are on it at S=6, not at S=1 or 2.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps for some rows, but all seem fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 4, for example.\n\nAt S=2, t=8, on y=4.\n\ny=4 car: at S=2, Δt=2, car (0,-11,right,12), span [-11+12*2, 12*2] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nBut the answer should be all U for 7 actions.\n\nBut H=8 turns? Turns from t=6 to t=13, 8 turns, but the sequence has 7 actions.\n\nIn the output, it should be actions from t=6 to t=12.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 1, there is a car that might affect, but we are not on y=1.\n\nAnother thing: the player position, when we move, but I think covered.\n\nPerhaps at the start, we are at y=2, and we move up immediately.\n\nBut let me see if we must avoid something.\n\nSuppose at S=0, we stay: then at S=1, still y=2.\n\nBut at S=1, y=2: is it safe?\n\ny=2 unsafe only at S=2, not at S=1.\n\nAt S=1, Δt=1, freeway 2 car: left-moving, [48-24*1, 71-24*1] = [24,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we can go up later, but it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=1, at S=1, y=1: S=1, y=1 unsafe only from S=10-18, S=1 not in, so safe, but then we need to go back up, more turns.\n\nSo not necessary.\n\nThus minimal is all up.\n\nBut in the sequence, we go to y=3 at S=1, which is safe.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe at S=0 only, S=1 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me check freeway 3 at S=1.\n\nt=7, S=1, on y=3.\n\nCar on y=3: (24,-11,right,36), at Δt=1, [-11+36*1, 24+36*1] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is all U for 7 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAnd at turn 13, y=9.\n\nH=8, since from turn 6 to 13, 8 turns.\n\nBut in the box, we need to output the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U\n\n}\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to when? Turn 12 action to go to y=9 at turn 13.\n\nAnd H=8.\n\nBut the sequence has 7 actions, from t=6 to t=12.\n\nIn the {t=0 to H-1}, H=8, t=0 to 7, which would be a_6 to a_{13}, but a_{13} is not needed.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in indexing.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, it is only for the actions taken, not including the reach turn.\n\nIn the answer format example, it shows multiple turns with actions, implying until the last action before reach.\n\nFor instance, if H=1, no action, but not possible.\n\nIn this case, with 7 actions.\n\nIn the box, we list the turns with actions.\n\nSince H=8, and actions from t=6 to t=12.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 8, at S=6, we have the third car at [13,24], not covering 0.\n\nBut let me confirm S=6, Δt=6.\n\nThird car: [-11 +4*6, 4*6] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24], yes.\n\nFirst car: [-51+24, -40+24] = [-27,-16], no.\n\nSecond: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, with sequence all U.\n\nBut the problem might expect something else, or did I miss a collision?\n\nAt turn t=12, S=6, on y=8, safe.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at S=0,1,2,10-18.\n\nS=6 not in, so fine.\n\nPerhaps when moving, but the note says that when you move to a new row, you are not on it until next turn, so no issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe when \\(\\Delta t = S\\) (where \\(S = T - 6\\)) is between 10 and 18 inclusive due to the first car \\((-40, -51, \\text{right}, 4)\\).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at \\(S = 2\\) (turn \\(t = 8\\)) due to the car \\((48, 71, \\text{left}, 24)\\).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe only at \\(S = 0\\) (turn \\(t = 6\\)) due to the car \\((24, -11, \\text{right}, 36)\\).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe only at \\(S = 0\\) (turn \\(t = 6\\)) due to the car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 12)\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe only at \\(S = 0\\) (turn \\(t = 6\\)) due to the car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 12)\\).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe only at \\(S = 0\\) (turn \\(t = 6\\)) due to the car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 12)\\).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe only at \\(S = 0\\) (turn \\(t = 6\\)) due to the car \\((24, -11, \\text{right}, 36)\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at \\(S = 0, 1, 2\\) (due to the third car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 4)\\)) and \\(S = 10\\) to \\(18\\) (due to the first car \\((-40, -51, \\text{right}, 4)\\)).\n- **Freeway 9 (y=9)**: Always safe, as there are no cars.\n\nThe player starts at \\(S = 0\\) (turn \\(t = 6\\)) on \\(y = 2\\), which is safe. Since freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 7\\) are unsafe only at \\(S = 0\\), they are safe for \\(S \\geq 1\\). The minimal path to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 7 upward moves (from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), so the earliest possible arrival is at \\(S = 7\\) (turn \\(t = 13\\)).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) in Minimal Turns\n- At turn \\(t = 6\\) (\\(S = 0\\)): Player is at \\(y = 2\\) (safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 7\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 7\\) (\\(S = 1\\)): Player is at \\(y = 3\\) (safe for \\(S \\geq 1\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 8\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\) (\\(S = 2\\)): Player is at \\(y = 4\\) (safe for \\(S \\geq 1\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 9\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\) (\\(S = 3\\)): Player is at \\(y = 5\\) (safe for \\(S \\geq 1\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 10\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\) (\\(S = 4\\)): Player is at \\(y = 6\\) (safe for \\(S \\geq 1\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 11\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\) (\\(S = 5\\)): Player is at \\(y = 7\\) (safe for \\(S \\geq 1\\)). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 12\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\) (\\(S = 6\\)): Player is at \\(y = 8\\). Since \\(S = 6\\) is not in the unsafe times for \\(y = 8\\) (\\(S = 0, 1, 2, 10-18\\)), it is safe. Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 13\\).\n\nThe player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 13\\), which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6 + H - 1 = 13\\), so \\(H = 8\\). The sequence involves 7 actions (all \\(U\\)) from \\(t = 6\\) to \\(t = 12\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance\n- \\(t = 6\\) (\\(S = 0\\)): \\(y = 2\\), car span \\([48, 71]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 7\\) (\\(S = 1\\)): \\(y = 3\\), car span \\([-11 + 36(1), 24 + 36(1)] = [25, 60]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 8\\) (\\(S = 2\\)): \\(y = 4\\), car span \\([-11 + 12(2), 12(2)] = [13, 24]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 9\\) (\\(S = 3\\)): \\(y = 5\\), car span \\([-11 + 12(3), 12(3)] = [25, 36]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 10\\) (\\(S = 4\\)): \\(y = 6\\), car span \\([-11 + 12(4), 12(4)] = [37, 48]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 11\\) (\\(S = 5\\)): \\(y = 7\\), car span \\([-11 + 36(5), 24 + 36(5)] = [169, 204]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 12\\) (\\(S = 6\\)): \\(y = 8\\), cars:\n  - First car: \\([-51 + 4(6), -40 + 4(6)] = [-27, -16]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([25 + 4(6), 36 + 4(6)] = [49, 60]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Third car: \\([-11 + 4(6), 4(6)] = [13, 24]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- \\(t = 13\\) (\\(S = 7\\)): \\(y = 9\\), no cars → safe.\n\nAll positions are safe, and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn \\(t = 13\\) with \\(H = 8\\) turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t = 6\\) to \\(t = 12\\) is all \\(U\\) (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 7. I have to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that moves the player vertically, with y between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule is important: at any turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at turn T, then collision occurs. But when moving, at turn T, you're on y_T, and you decide to move to y_{T+1}, but you're not considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So at turn T, you only check the freeway you're currently on, y_T, for collisions.\n\nAlso, cars move continuously: left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase, based on speed and time from t₁.\n\nt₁ is given as 7, so for any future turn T, the time elapsed is (T - t₁) = (T - 7).\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t₁, so at turn T, which is turn number, Δt = T - 7.\n\nFor each car, I need to find its position at turn T.\n\nFirst, list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\n- Car A: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed s=4. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] but the head is at h, which is larger? Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail. Here, h = -36, τ = -47, so since -36 > -47, and direction right, so at t₁=7, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nIn freeway 1, both cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h = -36, τ = -47, d=right, s=4. So at t₁, span [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: h=28, τ=17, d=right, s=4. τ=17, h=28, so 17<28, so span [17,28]\n\nBut both on freeway 1.\n\nNow at turn T, position:\n\nSince right-moving, x_position at T: for a car, the span moves right by s*(T-7)\n\nSo for first car: span at T: [ -47 + 4*(T-7) , -36 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: [17 + 4*(T-7), 28 + 4*(T-7)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): one car: h=24, τ=47, d=left, s=24\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h left end? Notation says: left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd it says: for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ], so h is head, which for left-moving should be the left end? I think I need to interpret head and tail.\n\nFrom the car update: for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ] and then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince moving left, positions decrease.\n\nHere, h=24, τ=47, but if left-moving, and h=24, τ=47, 24<47, so if [h,τ] = [24,47], and moving left, so at T, [24 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT]\n\ns=24, ΔT = T-7.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ,h] for the one on freeway 1, first car [τ,h] = [-47,-36], so τ is left, h is right.\n\nIn freeway 2 car: it's left-moving, span [h,τ] = [24,47], so h=24 is left end, τ=47 is right end.\n\nAt T, [24 - 24*(T-7), 47 - 24*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): one car: h=60, τ=25, d=right, s=36\n\nRight-moving, so span(t₁) = [τ,h] = [25,60] since τ=25, h=60.\n\nAt T, [25 + 36*(T-7), 60 + 36*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): one car: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=12\n\nRight-moving, span [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 + 12*(T-7), 12 + 12*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4? It says: (12,1,right,12) so identical to freeway 4 car.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): also (12,1,right,12), same.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (60,25,right,36), same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): three cars:\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,4) similar to freeway 1 first car.\n\nSecond: (40,29,right,4) h=40, τ=29? τ=29, h=40, so [29,40] for right-moving.\n\nThird: (4,-7,right,4) τ=-7, h=4, so [-7,4]\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at turn t₁=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars there, so safe.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T.\n\nActions: U: y+1, D: y-1, S: y same, but y must stay in [0,9].\n\nCollision only when on freeway y=1 to 8, and for that y, at turn T, if 0 in some car's span on that row.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, as position is (0, y).\n\nNow, I need min H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid cars.\n\nStart at y=3, turn 7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe shortest path in terms of moves: from 3 to 9, difference 6, so min H could be 6 if I go up every turn, but might hit cars.\n\nH is the number of turns including start? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but here t is relative to t₁.\n\nDefine: at turn t₁ + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1\n\nAt t=0, which is turn t₁, player at initial position.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t₁ + H - 1, y should be 9.\n\nTurn indices: at time t (step), we have turn number T = t₁ + t.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, T = t₁, y = initial y.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at t=1, T=t₁+1, y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAt the end of H turns, at turn T = t₁ + (H-1), y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we need min H.\n\nSince from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 steps up, so min H is at least 6, but with stay or down, H could be more, but we want min, so probably H=6 is possible if no obstacles, but there are cars.\n\nFirst, I need to see for each freeway, when is it safe to be there, i.e., when 0 is not in any car span.\n\nBut it depends on the turn, since cars move.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to different y next turn.\n\nBut collision is checked only at the current y_T for that turn.\n\nTo avoid collision, for each turn T, when player is on a freeway k (1-8), we need that for that k, at turn T, 0 not in any car span on row k.\n\nIf on y=0 or y=9, no cars, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nStart at y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has a car: at t₁=7, span [25,60] right-moving, s=36.\n\nAt turn T, span [25 + 36*(T-7), 60 + 36*(T-7)]\n\n0 is in span if 25 + 36ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 36ΔT, where ΔT = T-7.\n\nSince positions are increasing, 0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSo for freeway 3 car: low = 25 + 36ΔT, high = 60 + 36ΔT.\n\nlow = 25 + 36ΔT >0 for all ΔT >=0, since min at ΔT=0 is 25>0, so low >0, thus 0 < low <= high, so 0 not in [low,high] since low >0. So 0 is never in the span for freeway 3 car? low =25 +36ΔT >=25>0, so 0 < low, so indeed 0 not in [low,high] for any T. So freeway 3 is always safe? Is that right?\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=7, span [25,60], 0 not in, since 0<25.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=8, span [25+36=61, 60+36=96], 0<61, not in.\n\nSimilarly for larger ΔT, even larger, so yes, freeway 3 is always safe because the car is far right and moving right, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4,5,6 have cars: for example freeway 4: car at t₁=7, span [1,12] right-moving, s=12.\n\nAt T, span [1 +12ΔT, 12 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 12 +12ΔT\n\nBut 1 +12ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so low>0, 0 not <= low? 0 <= low? low is at least 1, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low,high]. Similarly, always safe? But at ΔT=0, [1,12], 0 not in, yes. But what about when the car moves? For example, if ΔT negative, but T>t₁, ΔT>=0, so [1,12] to [13,24], etc, all positive, so 0 never covered. Similarly freeway 5 and 6 same.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 have identical cars, so same.\n\nNow freeway 7: same as freeway 3, car [25,60] right-moving s=36, so same as above, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 1: two cars.\n\nFirst car: at t₁, span [-47,-36] right-moving s=4, so at T, [ -47 +4ΔT, -36 +4ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -36 +4ΔT\n\nSimilarly, second car: [17 +4ΔT, 28 +4ΔT], low=17+4ΔT >=17>0, so 0 not in, since low>0.\n\nSo only first car can cover 0.\n\nFor first car: -47 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -36 +4ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -47 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/4 = 11.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=9\n\nSo for ΔT >=9 and ΔT <=11.75, since ΔT integer, ΔT=9,10,11.\n\nΔT = T-7, so T=16,17,18.\n\nAt turns T=16,17,18, on freeway 1, the first car covers 0.\n\nBut only if player is on freeway 1 at those turns.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, left-moving, h=24, τ=47, but for left-moving, span [h,τ] = [24,47] at t₁.\n\nAt T, [24 -24ΔT, 47 -24ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 24 -24ΔT <= 0 <= 47 -24ΔT\n\nLeft: 24 -24ΔT <=0 => -24ΔT <= -24 => ΔT >=1 (since divide by negative, inequality flips)\n\n24 -24ΔT <=0 => 24(1 - ΔT) <=0 => 1 - ΔT <=0 => ΔT >=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 47 -24ΔT => 24ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958\n\nSo ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=1.958, so ΔT=1 or 2? ΔT integer, so ΔT=1 or 2? ΔT <=1.958, so ΔT=1, since for ΔT=2, 24*2=48>47, so 47-48=-1<0, so 0 <= -1 false.\n\nCheck:\n\nΔT=1: left: 24 -24*1 =0, right:47-24=23, so span [0,23], so 0 is included? 0 <=0<=23, yes, 0 in span.\n\nΔT=2: left:24-48= -24, right:47-48= -1, span [-24,-1], 0 not in, since -1<0.\n\nΔT=0: span [24,47], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=8, span [0,23], 0 included.\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision at T=8 if player is there.\n\nNow freeway 8: three cars.\n\nFirst car: similar to freeway 1 first car, but let's see.\n\nCar1: (-36,-47,right,4) so τ=-47, h=-36, span [-47,-36] at t₁, at T [ -47+4ΔT, -36+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -47+4ΔT <=0<= -36+4ΔT, which as before, ΔT=9 to 11 inclusive? Earlier for freeway 1, ΔT=9,10,11.\n\n-47+4ΔT <=0 <= -36+4ΔT\n\nΔT >=9 and ΔT <=11.75, so ΔT=9,10,11.\n\nSecond car: (40,29,right,4) h=40, τ=29, so span [29,40] at t₁, at T [29+4ΔT,40+4ΔT], low=29+4ΔT>=29>0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (4,-7,right,4) τ=-7, h=4, span [-7,4] at t₁, at T [-7+4ΔT, 4+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -7+4ΔT <=0<= 4+4ΔT\n\nLeft: -7+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=7 => ΔT <=7/4=1.75\n\nRight: 0<=4+4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nSo ΔT <=1.75 and ΔT integer, so ΔT=0,1\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=7, span [-7,4], 0 in? -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=8, span [-7+4= -3, 4+4=8], -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=9, span [-7+8=1,4+8=12], 1<=0<=12? 1>0, so 0<1, not <= low, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nSo for third car, 0 in span at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1, i.e., T=7 and T=8.\n\nNow for freeway 8, collision if any car has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nAt T=7 (ΔT=0):\n\n- First car: [-47,-36], 0 not in\n\n- Second car: [29,40], 0 not in\n\n- Third car: [-7,4], 0 in\n\nSo collision at T=7 on freeway 8.\n\nAt T=8 (ΔT=1):\n\n- First car: [-47+4=-43, -36+4=-32], 0 not in\n\n- Second car: [29+4=33,40+4=44], 0 not in\n\n- Third car: [-3,8], 0 in\n\nSo collision at T=8.\n\nAt T=9 (ΔT=2):\n\n- First car: [-47+8=-39, -32], 0 not in\n\n- Second: [33,44], no\n\n- Third: [1,12], 1>0, 0 not in\n\nSo safe at T=9 and later? But first car might cover later, but for first car, only at ΔT=9-11, which is later.\n\nBut at T=9, all safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart at turn T=7, y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut to min H, probably U as much as possible.\n\nBut need to avoid collisions when on freeways 1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous freeways and times:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=8\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=7 and T=8\n\nFreeway 3,4,5,6,7 always safe? Freeway 4,5,6 we said always safe, yes.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 3.\n\nBut freeway 8 unsafe at T=7,8.\n\nNow, at turn T=7, player is at y=3, which is safe.\n\nI need to choose action for turn T=7: a_{t₁} = a_7\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at T=8.\n\nIf stay, y=3 at T=8.\n\nIf down, to y=2 at T=8.\n\nT=8 is critical for freeway 2 and freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at T=8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, player will be at some y.\n\nNow, let's think about moving.\n\nStart T=7, y=3 (safe).\n\nAfter action, at T=8, y depends on action at T=7.\n\nIf a_7 = U, then y_8 =4\n\nIf a_7 = S, y_8=3\n\nIf a_7 = D, y_8=2\n\nNow at T=8:\n\nIf y_8=4, freeway 4, which is always safe, so ok.\n\nIf y_8=3, freeway 3, always safe, ok.\n\nIf y_8=2, freeway 2, which is unsafe at T=8, so collision! So cannot be on y=2 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=8, but we start at y=3, can't reach y=8 in one step.\n\nSo at T=8, if player is on y=2, collision.\n\nTherefore, at T=7, I cannot choose D, because that would put me at y=2 at T=8, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I choose S, y_8=3, safe.\n\nIf I choose U, y_8=4, safe.\n\nNow, similarly, freeway 8 is unsafe at T=8, but since player is not on y=8 at T=8, no issue.\n\nNow, I need to go up.\n\nBut let's see future.\n\nAlso, T=7 on freeway 8 is unsafe, but player not there.\n\nNow, from T=8, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose at T=7, I go up, so y_7=3, a_7=U, then y_8=4.\n\nAt T=8, y=4, which is safe (freeway 4 always safe).\n\nNow, I can choose action for T=8: a_8.\n\nIf U, y_9=5\n\nIf S, y_9=4\n\nIf D, y_9=3, but probably not.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe only obstacles are when moving through freeways at dangerous times.\n\nBut in this case, freeways 1,2,8 have dangers at specific times, but freeway 1 danger at T=16-18, which is far, since we start at T=7, and min H=6, so T=7 to T=12 for H=6? Let's see.\n\nIf I go up every turn, start y=3 at T=7.\n\nAfter each up:\n\nT=7: y=3\n\na=U, T=8: y=4\n\na=U, T=9: y=5\n\na=U, T=10: y=6\n\na=U, T=11: y=7\n\na=U, T=12: y=8\n\na=U, T=13: y=9\n\nBut at T=13, y=9, which is goal, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this sequence, after 6 actions: from T=7 to T=12, that's 6 turns? Let's count the turns.\n\nAt t=0 (relative), T=t₁=7, y=3\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at t=1, T=8, y= new\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T = t₁ + H - 1? The sequence is actions at t=0 to H-1, with y at start of t=0.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn T = t₁ + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet k be the step, from k=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn T_k = t₁ + k\n\nAt T_k, before action, position y_k.\n\nAfter action, at T_{k+1}, position y_{k+1}.\n\nFor k=0, T_0 = t₁, y_0 initial.\n\nAfter action a_0, at T_1, y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, at T_H, y_H.\n\nAnd we want y_H =9, with T_H = t₁ + H.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is T_H = t₁ + H.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"after H turns, at turn t₁ + H -1, y=9\"\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, a_{t₁ + t}\n\nAt time t, action at turn t₁ + t.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁ + t}, position at next turn.\n\nSo, at turn T = t₁ + t, we take action, then position updates to y_{t+1} at turn t₁ + t +1? I think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: at each turn, we are at a position, take action, move to new position for next turn.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T, we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t₁ + t} is the action at turn t₁ + t.\n\nAfter executing a_{t₁ + t}, we go to turn t₁ + t +1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have executed up to turn t₁ + H -1, and we are at position for turn (t₁ + H -1) +1 = t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nClarify.\n\nThe state: at the beginning of turn T, position is (0, y_T).\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter action, we are now at turn T+1 with position y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t₁, position y_{t₁}.\n\nAfter sequence of H actions: a_{t₁}, a_{t₁+1}, ..., a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, y_{t₁+1}\n\nAfter a_{t₁+1}, at turn t₁+2, y_{t₁+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t₁ + H -1}, at turn t₁ + H, y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1? That seems inconsistent.\n\nRead the problem:\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"after H turns\" but let's see the indices.\n\nIn the action sequence: {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so actions at turns: t₁ + 0, t₁ +1, ..., t₁ + H -1\n\nAfter taking these actions, the position is updated H times, so the final position is at turn t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nPerhaps the turn when we are at position is after the action or before.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nLook back:\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t\"\n\na_t is action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, which sets Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} is position at turn t+1.\n\nSo the position y_t is defined for each turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so a_{t₁}, a_{t₁+1}, ..., a_{t₁+H-1}\n\nAfter taking a_{t₁+H-1}, we have y_{t₁+H}.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nThat means at the start of turn t₁ + H -1, position is (0,9), but we take action a_{t₁+H-1} at that turn, which might move us away, but we need to be there at that turn, before action? Or after?\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1, meaning that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nBut after taking the action at turn t₁ + H -1, we go to y_{t₁ + H}, which could be different.\n\nBut for reaching, we just need that at some turn, we are at y=9.\n\nSo y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, with H actions, we start at turn t₁, after 0 actions, y_{t₁}.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t₁}), at turn t₁+1, y_{t₁+1}\n\nAfter 2 actions, at turn t₁+2, y_{t₁+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which is after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t₁ + k with position y_{t₁ + k}.\n\nFor k=0, turn t₁, y_{t₁}\n\nAfter k actions, turn t₁ + k, y_{t₁ + k}\n\nWe want for some k, y_{t₁ + k} =9, and k is the turn index from start.\n\nThe number of turns from t₁ to t is t - t₁.\n\nAt turn t₁, after 0 actions, position y_{t₁}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, position y_{t₁+1}\n\nAfter second action a_{t₁+1}, at turn t₁+2, position y_{t₁+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, at turn t₁ + m, position y_{t₁ + m}\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9 for some H.\n\nThat means after (H-1) actions, we are at turn t₁ + (H-1) with y=9.\n\nThen at that turn, we may take an action, but since we are at y=9, we can take S or whatever, but the position is already reached.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}, so for the position at turn t₁ + H -1, it is determined by the first H-1 actions? Let's think.\n\nTo have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, this is the position at the start of turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nThis position is set by the action at turn t₁ + H -2, or from initial.\n\nThe position y_t for t > t₁ is determined by the actions from t₁ to t-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t} = y_{t₁} + sum of Δy from tau=t₁ to t-1.\n\nFor y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{t₁} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t₁ + k}\n\nAnd this equals 9.\n\nThe actions are a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, which affect y_{t₁ + t +1} to y_{t₁ + t +1}, etc.\n\nFor the position at turn T = t₁ + H -1, we need the actions from t₁ to (t₁ + H -1) -1 = t₁ + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t₁ + H -1}, which is the action at turn t₁ + H -1, which affects y_{t₁ + H}, not y_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for the position at turn t₁ + H -1, it is determined by actions from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -2}, and a_{t₁ + H -1} is taken at turn t₁ + H -1 when we are at y_{t₁ + H -1}, but it doesn't change that position for that turn.\n\nThe key point is that to have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, we need that the actions from t₁ to t₁ + H -2 have moved us to 9 by turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nThe action a_{t₁ + H -1} is taken at that turn, but it is part of the sequence, even though it might move us away, but the position is reached at that turn.\n\nIn terms of collision, at each turn T, when we are at y_T, we check collision for that turn, before taking action or after? The collision is based on position at turn T.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in span for any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\"\n\nAnd \"at turn T, you are on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, position y_T, we are on that freeway if y_T in 1-8, and we check collision based on cars at that turn.\n\nThen we take action a_T, which may change y for next turn.\n\nSo for the reach condition, we need that at turn t₁ + H -1, y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, and for all turns from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, when on freeway 1-8, no collision.\n\nThe actions are from turn t₁ to turn t₁ + H -1, inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions is H.\n\nFor example, min H to go from 3 to 9 with only U: from y=3 to y=9, need 6 steps up, so after 6 U actions, y increases by 6, from 3 to 9.\n\nStart at T=7, y=3.\n\nAfter a_7=U, at T=8, y=4\n\nAfter a_8=U, at T=9, y=5\n\n...\nAfter a_11=U, at T=12, y=8? Let's list:\n\nTurn T=7: y=3, take a_7\n\nAfter a_7, at T=8, y=4\n\nAt T=8, y=4, take a_8\n\nAfter a_8, at T=9, y=5\n\n...\nAt T=11, y=7? Start T=7 y=3\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=7 y=3\n\nAfter 1 action (a_7): T=8 y=4\n\nAfter 2 actions: T=9 y=5\n\nAfter 3 actions: T=10 y=6\n\nAfter 4 actions: T=11 y=7\n\nAfter 5 actions: T=12 y=8\n\nAfter 6 actions: T=13 y=9\n\nSo to have y=9 at some turn, for example at T=13, y=9.\n\nBut we want at turn t₁ + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 13, so 7 + H -1 =13, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach earlier.\n\nWith H actions, the position at turn t₁ + H -1 is y_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nFrom above, after k actions, at turn t₁ + k, y_{t₁ + k}\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at T=7 with y=3, not 9.\n\nAfter 1 action, at T=8, y=4 or 3 or 2.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at T=9, y between 1 and 5, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, since start at 3, need to increase by 6, so min after 6 actions, at T=7+6=13, y=9 if all U.\n\nBut at T=13, y=9, which is turn t₁ + 6.\n\nWe want at turn t₁ + H -1, so t₁ + H -1 =13, t₁=7, so 7 + H -1=13, 6 + H =13, H=7? 7+H-1=13, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach at T=12 with y=8, but not 9.\n\nOr at T=11 with y=7, etc.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is at T=13 with all U, y=9.\n\nBut at T=13, y=9, which is not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut we need to check the path for collisions.\n\nFirst, with all U:\n\nStart T=7, y=3, freeway 3, always safe.\n\nAction a_7=U, to y=4 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=4, freeway 4, always safe.\n\nAction a_8=U, to y=5 at T=9.\n\nT=9, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\na_9=U, to y=6 at T=10.\n\nT=10, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\na_10=U, to y=7 at T=11.\n\nT=11, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\na_11=U, to y=8 at T=12.\n\nT=12, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nNow, freeway 8 at T=12.\n\nT=12, ΔT = T-7 =5.\n\nCars on freeway 8:\n\nFirst car: at T, span [-47 +4*5, -36 +4*5] = [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [29+20,40+20]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-7+20,4+20]=[13,24], 0 not in.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen action a_12=U, to y=9 at T=13.\n\nT=13, y=9, safe, reached.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at turn t₁ + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nAt T=13, y=9, so t₁ + H -1 =13, 7 + H -1=13, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nAnd the action sequence is for turns t₁ to t₁+H-1=7 to 13? t from 0 to H-1, a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to 6.\n\nActions: at T=7,8,9,10,11,12: all U.\n\nAt T=13, we are at y=9, but we don't take action if we stop, but the sequence includes actions up to when we reach.\n\nIn this case, with H=7, actions at T=7 to 12, and at T=13, we are at y=9.\n\nTurn t₁ + H -1 =7+7-1=13, yes.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller?\n\nMinimal H: from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 net up moves, so min H=6 actions would require all U, but after 6 actions, at T=7+6=13, y=9, same as above.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at T=13, y=9.\n\nWith H=6 actions, we have actions from T=7 to T=12, and at T=13, y=9, but turn t₁ + H -1 =7+6-1=12.\n\nAt turn 12, y=8, not 9.\n\nFor H=6, we need y at turn t₁ + H -1 =7+6-1=12 to be 9.\n\nBut at turn 12, with actions from T=7 to T=11? Let's see.\n\nWith H actions, positions:\n\nAt turn t₁ + H -1, y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nThis is set by actions from t₁ to t₁ + H -2.\n\nThe change in y: from y_{t₁} to y_{t₁ + H -1}, net change must be +6 to go from 3 to 9.\n\nThe number of actions that affect this position is from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -2}, which is H-1 actions.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,or+1, so net change from H-1 actions is between -(H-1) and +(H-1).\n\nStart y=3, end y=9, so net +6.\n\nThus |net change| <= H-1, so 6 <= H-1, so H-1 >=6, H>=7.\n\nSimilarly, min H=7.\n\nWith H=7, we can have y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{7+7-1}=y_{13}=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to 6, a_{7} to a_{12}.\n\nIn the all U case, it works, and we saw no collisions.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nEarlier I thought freeway 8 at T=12 is safe, yes.\n\nBut let's confirm all steps.\n\nIn the all U path:\n\nT=7: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=8: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=9: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=10: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=11: y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nT=12: y=8, freeway 8, with ΔT=5, as above, cars not at 0, safe.\n\nT=13: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nBut at T=13, we are at y=9, but for the sequence, with H=7, actions at T=7 to T=12, all U.\n\nBut the problem is to reach at turn t₁ + H -1 =13, which is correct.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? With H=7, min, since H>=7.\n\nBut at turn T=7, we are at y=3, not 9.\n\nIf we could be at y=9 earlier, but from y=3, after 5 actions, at T=12, y could be at most 8, since 3+5=8, so at T=12, y<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at T=13, y=9 possible.\n\nSo min H=7.\n\nBut in the path above, with all U, it seems safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 2 at T=8 unsafe, but in this path, at T=8, we are at y=4, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=7 and T=8 unsafe, but we not there.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the player starts at y=3, which is safe, and we go up each time.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we are on a dangerous freeway.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 unsafe at T=16,17,18, but T=16 is far, not in our path since we finish at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in freeway 8, at T=7 and T=8 unsafe, but we are at y=8 at T=12, which is safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of 7 actions, all U.\n\nBut H=7, actions from t=0 to 6, a_{7} to a_{12}, all U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me see if we can do with H=7 but different actions, but all U is fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to not go up? For example, if we go down or stay, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nMin H is 7.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about freeway 2 at T=8 unsafe, but since we not there, ok.\n\nSimilarly, another thing: when moving, at turn T, if we move to y_{T+1} different, we not on the new freeway until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm for freeway 3,4,etc, but I think they are safe.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 have cars, but as we saw, the spans are always positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is 7 turns, all up.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nH=7\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{8} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +6: a_{12} = U\n\nt from 0 to H-1=6, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 6, so turns 7 to 12.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAnd that should reach at turn 13, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence has 7 actions, from turn 7 to 12.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_{12}, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nAnd turn t1 + H -1 =7+7-1=13, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=7 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps if we start by staying or something, but that would delay, so worse.\n\nOr down, but down to y=2 at T=8 is dangerous, as we saw.\n\nFor example, if at T=7, we go down, to y=2 at T=8, but freeway 2 at T=8 has collision, since car covers 0.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf stay at T=7, y=3 at T=8, safe, but then we need to go up later, so more turns to reach y=9, H larger.\n\nFor example, if we stay once, then after 7 actions, we might be at y=8 or something, not 9.\n\nStart T=7 y=3\n\nIf a7=S, T=8 y=3\n\nThen if all U: T=9 y=4, T=10 y=5, ..., T=13 y=8, T=14 y=9, so reach at T=14, with H larger.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U for 7 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: at T=8, ΔT=1, span [24-24, 47-24] = [0,23], so 0 included, so if on y=2 at T=8, collision.\n\nBut we not there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=7: third car span [-7,4], 0 in, so if on y=8 at T=7, collision, but player at y=3.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 8: third car span [-3,8], 0 in, but player not on y=8.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nThus, minimal H=7, sequence all U.\n\nBut in the output, I need to write for each turn.\n\nAlso, for the box.\n\nBut the player is at (0,3) at turn 7, and we need to go to (0,9).\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it shows the actions, not H explicitly, but H is implied.\n\nIn the box, it has the actions.\n\nSo for this, it should be:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut H=7, and turns from 7 to 12, which is 6 actions? Turns: 7,8,9,10,11,12, that's 6 turns.\n\nt from 0 to 5 for H=6? Let's count.\n\nIf H=7, actions at t=0 to 6: turns t1 + t for t=0 to 6: 7,8,9,10,11,12,13? t=0: turn 7, t=1: turn 8, ..., t=6: turn 13.\n\nBut turn t1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=7, t=0 to 6, turns 7 to 13? t1=7, t=0: turn 7, t=1: turn 8, t=2: turn 9, t=3: turn 10, t=4: turn 11, t=5: turn 12, t=6: turn 13.\n\nBut at turn 13, if we take action a_13, but we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 =7+7-1=13, so at turn 13, we should be at y=9 before taking action.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions up to a_{12}, we have y_{13}=9.\n\nBut for H=7, the actions include a_{13}? No.\n\nWith H=7 actions: a_{7}, a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}?\n\nt from 0 to 6, a_{t1 + t} = a_{7} to a_{13} for t=0 to 6.\n\nThen after a_{13}, at turn 14, y_{14}.\n\nBut we want y at turn t1 + H -1 =7+7-1=13 to be 9.\n\nSo at turn 13, position y_{13}, which is set by actions from a_{7} to a_{12}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{13} = y_{7} + sum of Δy from t=7 to 12.\n\nActions a_t for t=7 to 12 affect y_{8} to y_{13}.\n\ny_{13} depends on a_{7} to a_{12}.\n\nThen at turn 13, we take action a_{13}, which affects y_{14}, but for the position at turn 13, it is y_{13}, set by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_{13}=9, we need the actions a_{7} to a_{12} to move from y_{7}=3 to y_{13}=9.\n\nThat requires net +6 over 6 actions (a_{7} to a_{12}).\n\nThen with H=7, the sequence includes a_{7} to a_{13}, but a_{13} is not needed for reaching y_{13}=9, and it might be taken, but we can set it to S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, we must include actions up to a_{t1 + H -1}, which for H=7, t1 + H -1 =7+6=13? t1 + H -1 =7+7-1=13.\n\nSo actions from t=0 to H-1=6, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 6, so a_{7} to a_{13}.\n\nBut to have y_{13}=9, we need a_{7} to a_{12} to achieve that, and a_{13} can be anything, but since we are at y=9, we can set a_{13}=S to stay.\n\nIn this case, with all U from a_{7} to a_{12}, y_{13}=9.\n\nThen a_{13} can be S.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we can have H=7 with a_{7} to a_{12} all U, and a_{13} S, but that would be 7 actions, reaching at turn 13.\n\nBut with only 6 actions: a_{7} to a_{12}, all U, then at turn 13, y_{13}=9, reached.\n\nBut with H=6, actions a_{7} to a_{12} (t=0 to 5), then at turn t1 + H -1 =7+6-1=12, we have y_{12}, which is 8, not 9.\n\nTo reach at turn 12, y_{12}=9.\n\nBut from y_{7}=3, to y_{12}=9, in 5 steps? Turns: from turn 7 to turn 12, the actions from a_{7} to a_{11} affect y_{8} to y_{12}.\n\ny_{12} = y_{7} + sum_{k=7}^{11} Δy_k\n\nStart y_{7}=3, end y_{12}, want y_{12}=9, so net +6 over 5 actions (a_{7} to a_{11}).\n\nEach action Δy between -1 and 1, so max y_{12} = 3 + 5*1 = 8, min 3-5=-2, so y_{12} <=8 <9, cannot reach y=9 by turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, only at turn 13 can we be at y=9.\n\nThus min H=7, with y_{13}=9.\n\nSequence: actions a_{7} to a_{12} all U, and since H=7, we need one more action, a_{13}, which we can set to S.\n\nThen actions: a_{7}=U, a_{8}=U, a_{9}=U, a_{10}=U, a_{11}=U, a_{12}=U, a_{13}=S\n\nThen at turn 13, before action, y_{13}=9, we are at (0,9), and we take a_{13}=S, but position is already reached.\n\nIf we set a_{13}=U, y_{14}=10, but y must be in [0,9], so probably invalid, or capped? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=min(9,10)? But it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably clamped, but in this case, since we reached at turn 13, we can take S to stay at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=7, we include a_{13}.\n\nIn the path, with a_{7} to a_{12} U, y_{13}=9.\n\nThen a_{13} can be S.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the all U to a_{12}, and S at a_{13}.\n\nBut since the goal is to reach at turn 13, and we do.\n\nNow, for collision, at turn 13, y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions all U from 7 to 12, and S at 13.\n\nBut in terms of the freeway, when on y=8 at turn 12, we are safe, as checked.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nTo save an action, but we can't, min H=7.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier if we go down and up, but that would take more moves, so worse.\n\nFor example, go down to y=2, but at T=8 y=2 is unsafe, so not possible.\n\nOther paths slower.\n\nSo I think the minimal is all U with H=7.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a_{13}=S.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let me write the actions:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut turn 13 is t1 + H -1? t1=7, H=7, t1 + H -1=13.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to 6, turns 7 to 13.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & S \\end{array} }\n\nBut the action at turn 13 is S, but we are already at y=9 at turn 13 before action.\n\nSince the position is reached at turn 13, and we take action, but it doesn't affect the reach.\n\nWe could have H=6 with different goal, but not possible.\n\nAnother thing: the freeways 4,5,6 have cars, but they are safe, as positions positive.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 4 car: at t1, span [1,12], s=12 right.\n\nAt T, [1+12ΔT, 12+12ΔT], all >=1, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly 5 and 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 3.\n\nFreeway 3 car: [25+36ΔT,60+36ΔT], all >0.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc, so with t1=7.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The vertical position changes based on actions: \\(U\\) (up, \\(+1\\)), \\(D\\) (down, \\(-1\\)), or \\(S\\) (stay, \\(0\\)), with \\(y\\) clamped to \\([0, 9]\\).\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}\\) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- Cars move according to their direction and speed, with positions updated based on \\(\\Delta T = T - t_1 = T - 7\\).\n\n#### Car Safety Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) due to the first car covering \\(x = 0\\).

Safe for \\(T \\geq 9\\).\n\n#### Path to Reach (0, 9):\n- From \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\), a net change of \\(+6\\) is required.\n- The minimal \\(H\\) is determined by the earliest turn where \\(y = 9\\) can be achieved, considering the constraints:\n  - At turn \\(T = 13\\), \\(y = 9\\) is possible (after 6 up actions from turn 7).\n  - Reaching \\(y = 9\\) earlier (e.g., turn 12) is impossible, as the maximum \\(y\\) at turn 12 is 8 (from \\(y = 3\\) with 5 up actions).\n  - Thus, the minimal \\(H\\) satisfies \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13\\), so \\(7 + H - 1 = 13\\), giving \\(H = 7\\).\n- The sequence must ensure no collisions at turns \\(T = 7\\) to \\(T = 13\\).\n\n#### Safe Sequence:\n- Start at turn 7, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe).\n- Actions:\n  - Turn 7: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 4\\) at turn 8.\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe); \\(U\\) → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 9.\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe); \\(U\\) → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 10.\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe); \\(U\\) → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 11.\n  - Turn 11: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe); \\(U\\) → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 12.\n  - Turn 12: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe at \\(T = 12\\) as \\(\\Delta T = 5\\), no car covers \\(x = 0\\)); \\(U\\) → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.\n  - Turn 13: \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, safe); \\(S\\) to stay (action required for sequence completeness).\n- This sequence has \\(H = 7\\) actions and reaches (0, 9) at turn 13 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7 + 7 - 1 = 13\\)).\n\n#### Why Minimal?\n- \\(H = 7\\) is minimal because \\(H - 1 \\geq 6\\) (net \\(+6\\) change requires at least 6 steps), so \\(H \\geq 7\\).\n- Deviations (e.g., down or stay) increase \\(H\\) or cause collisions (e.g., down at turn 7 puts \\(y = 2\\) at turn 8, colliding on freeway 2).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe minimal sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 7\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is y_T) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we check the freeway y_T for cars. Only when the player is on a freeway at a given turn, we check the car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1 (which is 8) until the turn when the player reaches y=9.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to y=8). For each freeway, we are given a list of cars. Each car is represented by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so the head is the rightmost? But note the update: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that at time T, the car covers from (h - s*(T-t1)) to (τ - s*(T-t1)), and since it's moving left, the head (which was originally at h) is decreasing.\n\nBut note the example: for a left-moving car, if at t1 the span is [h, τ] and h > τ (because the head is at the right and tail at the left) then the update subtracts s*(T-t1) from both, so the entire car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]: so the entire car moves right.\n\nHowever, in the given data, we see for freeway 2: (0, 23, left, 24). This is a left-moving car. At t1=8, the car spans from 0 to 23? But note: the representation for left-moving is [h, τ] and the example has h=0 and τ=23. That would imply the car is from 0 to 23? But then moving left, at a later time T, the span becomes [0 - 24*(T-8), 23 - 24*(T-8)]. This would be a very long car (24 units) and moving left at high speed.\n\nBut wait: the representation for left-moving says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then the update. However, note the example for freeway 1 has two cars: (-32,-43,right,4) and (32,21,right,4). For the right-moving car, the representation is [τ, h]? But here we have (32,21,right,4): so τ=21 and h=32? Then the span at t1 is [21,32] and moves right.\n\nSo to clarify:\n\nFor a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n- If direction is 'left': then the car at time t1 spans from min(head, tail) to max(head, tail)? Actually, the update rule does not assume that. The update rule for left-moving is: \n    Span(T) = [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)]\n  and similarly for right: \n    Span(T) = [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the span must be an interval. So for left-moving, if at t1 we have head and tail, the span at t1 is from min(head, tail) to max(head, tail)? Actually, the problem states the span as [h, τ] for left and [τ, h] for right. But in the example for freeway 1: \n  (-32,-43,right,4): for right-moving, the representation is [τ, h] -> so τ=-43 and h=-32? Then the span at t1 is [-43, -32] and then at time T, it becomes [-43 + 4*(T-8), -32 + 4*(T-8)].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway1: (32,21,right,4): then τ=21, h=32? Then at t1 the span is [21,32]. But wait, the problem says for right: [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? and if τ < h, then it's increasing. So that car is from 21 to 32.\n\nBut for the left-moving car on freeway2: (0,23,left,24): the representation is [h, τ] = [0,23]. So the car is from 0 to 23? But that is a long car (24 units). Then at time T, it becomes [0 - 24*(T-8), 23 - 24*(T-8)].\n\nWe need to check at each turn T (starting from t1=8) for the freeway we are on (if we are on a freeway, i.e., y between 1 and 8) whether there is a car that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe are at (0,4) at turn 8. We are on freeway 4? But note: freeway k is for y=k. So at turn 8, we are on freeway 4.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if any car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nPlan: We want to go from y=4 to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We are constrained to y in [0,9]. Since we are at 4 and want to go to 9, we must go up.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collisions on freeways 5,6,7,8 as we go up, and also we are currently on freeway 4.\n\nWe need to simulate the cars at each turn relative to t1=8.\n\nWe are going to simulate the positions of the cars at turns T = 8, 9, 10, ... until we can find a safe path.\n\nWe note that we start at turn 8 at y=4.\n\nOur actions: we choose at each turn: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). But we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H.\n\nWe can consider a BFS over (turn, y) states? But note: the car positions change with time, so we must account for the time.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting from t1=8) and y is the current vertical position.\n\nBut note: the turn t is absolute. The car positions at turn t are determined by t.\n\nWe need to check for a state (t,y) whether if we are at (0,y) at turn t, then we are safe? Only if y is 0 or 9, there are no cars. For y in {1,2,...,8}, we must check the freeway y at turn t.\n\nSo for state (t,y), if y is in {1,...,8}, we must check all cars on freeway y at turn t: for each car, compute the span at turn t, and see if 0 is in that span.\n\nHow to compute the span at turn t for a car?\n\nGiven a car (head, tail, direction, speed) at freeway k (which is fixed for the car) at time t1=8.\n\nAt time t (>=8), the car's span:\n\nIf direction is 'left':\n    new_head = head - speed*(t - 8)\n    new_tail = tail - speed*(t - 8)\n    Then the span is [min(new_head, new_tail), max(new_head, new_tail)]? \n\nBut note: the update rule says: Span(T) = [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)] for left. And the problem says that collision occurs if 0 is in the span. So we need to check if 0 is between new_head and new_tail (inclusive)? But note: the span is an interval, so we can check if min(new_head, new_tail) <= 0 <= max(new_head, new_tail).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving:\n    new_tail = tail + speed*(t-8)\n    new_head = head + speed*(t-8)\n    Then check if min(new_tail, new_head) <= 0 <= max(new_tail, new_head).\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving is [τ, h] and then we update to [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]? So the interval is from the updated τ to the updated h. If the car is moving right, then the tail is the left end and head the right end? So the span is [new_tail, new_head] and we require that the interval is continuous. So we can compute:\n\nFor any car:\n    if direction is 'left':\n        low = min(head - speed*(t-8), tail - speed*(t-8))\n        high = max(head - speed*(t-8), tail - speed*(t-8))\n        then check if low <= 0 <= high.\n\n    if direction is 'right':\n        low = min(tail + speed*(t-8), head + speed*(t-8))\n        high = max(tail + speed*(t-8), head + speed*(t-8))\n        then check if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nHowever, note: the representation for right-moving in the problem is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? So if τ < h, then it's [τ, h] and then after update it becomes [τ+s*(dt), h+s*(dt)] which is still increasing. But what if τ > h? The problem does not specify. Looking at the examples: \n  freeway1: (-32,-43,right,4): here tail=-43, head=-32 -> and since -43<-32, the span is [-43,-32] and then moves right. \n  freeway1: (32,21,right,4): tail=21, head=32 -> [21,32] -> so tail should be the left endpoint and head the right endpoint? But the problem says for right: [τ, h]. So if τ>h, then the interval would be [τ, h] which is decreasing? That doesn't make sense. \n\nTherefore, we interpret: for a right-moving car, the tail is the left endpoint and head is the right endpoint? So we always have tail <= head? \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: head is the right endpoint and tail the left? But then we have the example on freeway2: (0,23,left,24): head=0, tail=23 -> then if head=0 and tail=23, and head<tail, then the car would be from 0 to 23? But then when it moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nBut the problem states for left-moving: [h, τ] -> and then moves to [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt]. If h and τ are such that h < τ, then the interval [h, τ] is increasing? Or is it [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? The update rule does not specify order. However, the collision condition: 0 in the span. We can compute the interval as the convex hull: the car occupies from min(head - s*dt, tail - s*dt) to max(head - s*dt, tail - s*dt) for left-moving, and similarly for right.\n\nSo to be safe, we can compute the interval for a car at time t as:\n\n    if direction == 'left':\n        a = head - speed*(t-8)\n        b = tail - speed*(t-8)\n        low = min(a, b)\n        high = max(a, b)\n        if low <= 0 <= high -> collision.\n\n    if direction == 'right':\n        a = tail + speed*(t-8)\n        b = head + speed*(t-8)\n        low = min(a, b)\n        high = max(a, b)\n        if low <= 0 <= high -> collision.\n\nNow, we are at turn 8, at y=4. We must check freeway 4 at turn 8.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (24,13,right,12)\n\nFor this car at turn 8 (t=8, so dt=0):\n    right-moving: a = tail + 12*0 = 13, b = head + 12*0 = 24 -> so [13,24] -> 0 is not in [13,24]. So safe.\n\nSo at turn 8, we are safe at y=4.\n\nNow we need to plan the next actions.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. The minimal number of turns if there were no cars: we are at 4, so we need 5 ups: U,U,U,U,U -> 5 turns.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we are going to step on at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe start at turn8: y=4 (freeway4) -> safe.\n\nThen we choose an action at turn8: we can go up to y=5, down to y=3, or stay at y=4.\n\nBut we want to minimize turns, so we prefer up. However, we must check if going up to y=5 at turn9 is safe? Actually, at turn8 we take an action that affects our position at turn9.\n\nAt turn8, if we choose U, then at turn9 we will be at y=5.\n\nAt turn9, we are on freeway5? So we must check freeway5 at turn9.\n\nFreeway5: one car: (24,13,right,12) [same as freeway4?]\n\nAt turn9 (dt=1):\n    right-moving: a = 13 + 12*1 = 25, b = 24 + 12*1 = 36 -> span [25,36] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nSo we can do U at turn8 to go to y=5 at turn9.\n\nThen at turn9, we are at y=5. Then we can choose U again to go to y=6 at turn10.\n\nCheck freeway6 at turn10: because at turn10 we will be at y=6.\n\nFreeway6: one car: (24,13,right,12)\n\nAt turn10 (dt=2): a=13+12*2=37, b=24+12*2=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10, we choose U to go to y=7 at turn11.\n\nCheck freeway7 at turn11: \nFreeway7: (-48,-83,right,36) -> this is a right-moving car.\n\nAt turn11 (dt=3): \n    a = tail + 36*3 = -83 + 108 = 25\n    b = head + 36*3 = -48 + 108 = 60\n    span [25,60] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11, we choose U to go to y=8 at turn12.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn12: \nFreeway8 has three cars:\n    (-32,-43,right,4)\n    (44,33,right,4)\n    (8,-3,right,4)\n\nAt turn12 (dt=4):\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4): \n    a = -43 + 4*4 = -43+16 = -27\n    b = -32 + 16 = -16 -> span [-27,-16] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSecond car: (44,33,right,4): \n    a = 33 + 16 = 49, b=44+16=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThird car: (8,-3,right,4):\n    a = -3 + 16 = 13, b = 8+16=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 at turn12 is safe.\n\nThen at turn12, we choose U to go to y=9 at turn13.\n\nAt y=9, there are no cars -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\n\nTotal 5 turns.\n\nBut wait: we are at turn8, and we take 5 actions: at turn8,9,10,11,12 -> and at turn13 we are at y=9? \n\nActually, the update: \n  At turn8: we start at y=4. After action U, at turn9 we are at y=5.\n  At turn9: after U, turn10: y=6.\n  At turn10: after U, turn11: y=7.\n  At turn11: after U, turn12: y=8.\n  At turn12: after U, turn13: y=9.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn13. We have taken 5 actions: from turn8 to turn12 (inclusive). The problem says: sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, and we reach at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nActually, we start at turn t1=8. We take an action at turn8 and then we are at turn9. We take H actions: at turns 8,9,...,8+H-1. Then after the last action, we are at turn8+H. But the problem says: we take actions at turns t1+t for t=0 to H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we have the last action? But then after the last action, we are at turn t1+H? \n\nLet me read: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the action at time t affects the state at time t+1. \n\nSo if we take an action at turn t1 (t=0) then at turn t1+1 we are at a new state. We want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo at which turn do we take the last action? The last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we are at turn t1+H? But the position y_{t1+H-1} is the position at turn t1+H-1, which is the state after the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\nWait, the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where the action a_t is taken at time t.\n\nSo at time t1 (turn8): we are at y_{8}. Then we take action a_8 at turn8, and then at turn9 we have y9 = y8 + Δy8.\n\nSo the position at turn t is determined by the actions taken at turns before t.\n\nWe start at turn8: we are given y8=4.\n\nWe take actions at turn8, turn9, ... until we are at y=9.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn T. The problem says: we want the minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after H-1 actions? \n\nActually, after 0 actions (H=0) we are at turn8. But we are not at 9. \n\nAfter 1 action: we are at turn9. \nAfter 2 actions: turn10, etc.\n\nWe want to be at turn t1+H-1 = 8+H-1 = 7+H, and we want that state to be y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the last state we are at is at turn t1+H (because the last action at turn t1+H-1 produces state at turn t1+H). \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo they require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=4. Then we take an action at turn t1 (which is 8) and then at turn t1+1 we are at a new state. \n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? Then the sequence would be of length H-1? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then the state at the turn after the last action is at turn t1+H, and we require that state to be 9? But then they say y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLet me see the example: if H=1, then we take one action at t1 (turn8) and then at turn9 we are at a state. So we require that at turn9 (which is t1+1) we are at 9? But then the turn index in the state is t1+1, but the problem requires y_{t1+H-1} = y_{8+1-1}=y8? which is the start. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking again: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nIf H=1, then we require y_{8}=9 -> but we are at 4.\n\nIf H=5, then we require y_{8+5-1}=y_{12}=9.\n\nSo we want to be at y=9 at turn12.\n\nIn our plan above: \n  turn8: y=4 -> take U -> \n  turn9: y=5\n  turn10: y=6\n  turn11: y=7\n  turn12: y=8 -> then we take U at turn12 to get to y=9 at turn13.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn12? Then we haven't reached.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn12.\n\nHow? We started at turn8 at y=4. We need to go up 5 steps. So we need 5 actions: at turn8,9,10,11,12? Then at turn13 we would be at y=9. But we want to be at turn12 at y=9.\n\nAlternatively, we might have a faster way? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we can move faster? But the moves are only +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo we must take 5 steps up. So we need 5 moves. The moves are taken at turns 8,9,10,11,12. Then after the move at turn12, we are at turn13 at y=9. But we are required to be at y=9 at turn12? \n\nThis suggests we are not moving during the turn? The problem says: at turn T, we are at a position, then we take an action a_T, and then we update to turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at position (0,y_T). Then we take action a_T, and then at turn T+1 we are at (0,y_{T+1}).\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have taken actions at turns T-1, T-2, ... that lead to that.\n\nWe start at turn8: y8=4.\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn12: that is, T=12.\n\nWe need to have taken 5 up moves? Then we would be at y=4+5=9 at turn13, not turn12.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn12, we would have to start at turn8 and then by turn12 we have taken 4 moves. But 4 moves up would get us to y=8 at turn12.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=9 at turn12? \n\nBut the problem says: we are to output a sequence of actions from turn t1 (8) to turn t1+H-1 (which would be 8+H-1) and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo if we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, then we are at turn8+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn8: y8=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn8+H-1.\n\nThe number of moves is H? But the moves are taken at turns 8, 8+1, ..., 8+H-1? And they update the state from turn8 to turn9, then to turn10, ... until turn8+H.\n\nBut the state at turn8+H is after H moves. The problem requires the state at turn8+H-1 to be 9.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=9 at turn8+H-1, meaning after H-1 moves? \n\nLet me write:\n\nAt turn8: we are at y8=4 (given).\n\nAfter 0 moves (H=1): we are at turn8, so we require y8=9 -> not true.\n\nAfter 1 move (H=2): we take an action at turn8 -> then at turn9 we are at y9. We require y9=9? But we can only move one step: so y9=5 -> not 9.\n\nAfter 2 moves: y10 = y9 + move at turn9 = 5 + ... -> maximum we can be at is 7.\n\nAfter 3 moves: maximum 8.\n\nAfter 4 moves: maximum 9.\n\nSo with 4 moves: we start at turn8: y8=4.\nAt turn9: y9=5 (after U at turn8)\nAt turn10: y10=6 (after U at turn9)\nAt turn11: y11=7 (after U at turn10)\nAt turn12: y12=8 (after U at turn11) -> then we are at turn12 and we have not reached 9.\n\nBut wait: we take an action at turn11? Then the next state is turn12. So after 4 moves, we are at turn12 at y=8.\n\nTo get to y=9 at turn12, we would need to have taken an action at turn11 that moves us to y=9 at turn12? But that requires y11=8, then we do U at turn11 to get to y12=9.\n\nSo then we are at turn12 at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{8+H-1}=9.\n\nIf we take H moves, then the last move is at turn8+H-1, and then the state at turn8+H is y_{8+H}. But we require y_{8+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=9 at turn8+H-1, which is before the last move? \n\nAlternatively, we must achieve y=9 at the turn before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me re-read: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThe key: they say \"turns H\" and then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at that turn (t1+H-1) is 9.\n\nBut the state at the turn when we take an action is before the action? \n\nThe problem says: at turn t, we are at (0,y_t), then we choose an action a_t, and then we update to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take an action a_t, and then we move to turn t+1 with y_{t+1}=y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn8: y8=4.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{8+H-1}=9.\n\nWe also take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. That is, we take H actions: at turns 8, 9, ..., 8+H-1.\n\nBut note: the action at turn8 will update the state to turn9: so y9 is determined by the action at turn8.\n\nThe action at turn8+H-1 will update the state to turn8+H.\n\nSo the state at turn8+H-1 is determined by the actions taken at turns8 to 8+H-2.\n\nTo have y_{8+H-1}=9, we need to have reached y=9 by turn8+H-1, and the last action we take is at turn8+H-1, but that action will update to turn8+H, so we don't care about that next state? \n\nBut the problem says we only care about being at 9 at turn8+H-1. We don't require to stay there.\n\nHowever, the collision avoidance is only required for the turns we are on freeways. So if we are at y=9 at turn8+H-1, then we are safe because y=9 has no cars. But we must ensure that on the way we are safe.\n\nBut note: the action at turn8+H-1 is taken while we are at y_{8+H-1}=9. Since we are at 9, there is no car to collide. Then we take an action (any action) and move to turn8+H. But we are not required to avoid collision at turn8+H? Because the goal is to be at 9 at turn8+H-1.\n\nHowever, the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars. I think we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway (i.e., at every state we are in). So at turn8+H-1, if we are at y=9, then no collision. But at the previous turns, we must be safe.\n\nSo in summary: we need to be at y=9 at turn8+H-1, and we take actions at turns8,9,...,8+H-1. The actions from turn8 to turn8+H-2 are what get us to y=9 at turn8+H-1. The last action at turn8+H-1 is taken while we are at y=9, and then we move to y_{8+H} which is 9+Δy, but that doesn't matter because the goal is achieved at turn8+H-1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and then we are done. So we don't care about the next state.\n\nSo we need to reach y=9 at some turn T = 8+H-1, and we take H actions: the first H-1 actions are to move, and the last action is taken at the state y=9 (which is safe) and then we move to y_{T+1}. But the last action is not needed for the movement? Actually, we are required to take a sequence of H actions, and at the last action turn (turn8+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nBut how can we be at y=9 at turn8+H-1? We must have gotten there by the action at turn8+H-2. \n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have been at y=8 at turn T-1 and then taken U at turn T-1 to get to y=9 at turn T.\n\nSo the action at turn T-1 is U, and then we are at turn T at y=9.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn T we are at y=9, and we also take an action at turn T? That action will then change y_{T} to y_{T+1}. \n\nBut we are already at the goal at turn T, so why take an extra action? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we are at turn t1+H-1 and we are at 9, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? \n\nThat action will move us to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy. But if we move up, we go to 10, which is not allowed? Or if we move down, we go to 8, or stay at 9.\n\nBut the goal is only to reach 9, and then we stop? But the problem does not say we stop. It says we take H actions and then at the last action turn we are at 9.\n\nSo we can do at the last action: at turn8+H-1, we are at y=9, and then we can choose S (stay) to remain at 9 for the next state? But then the state at turn8+H-1 is 9, and we take action S, and then at turn8+H we are still at 9.\n\nBut the goal is only to be at 9 at turn8+H-1.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we could have reached at an earlier turn? \n\nBut we must minimize H.\n\nSo what is the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn8+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn8: y8=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of up moves is 5. But we can also move down and then up? But that would take more moves.\n\nSo the minimal moves in terms of net up is 5.\n\nHow many turns does it take? We need to do 5 up moves. The earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn8+5 = turn13? But then we would be at y=9 at turn13.\n\nThen turn13 = 8+H-1 => 8+H-1=13 -> H=6.\n\nWith H=6, we take actions at turns8,9,10,11,12,13. And we are at y=9 at turn13 (which is 8+6-1=13).\n\nBut then we must be at y=9 at turn13, and we take an action at turn13.\n\nHow do we get to y=9 at turn13? \n  turn8: y8=4\n  turn9: y9=5 (after U at turn8)\n  turn10: y10=6 (after U at turn9)\n  turn11: y11=7 (after U at turn10)\n  turn12: y12=8 (after U at turn11)\n  turn13: y13=9 (after U at turn12)\n\nSo then we are at y=9 at turn13.\n\nBut we take an action at turn13? We can choose S (stay) to remain at 9.\n\nNow, we must check that along the way we are safe.\n\nWe already checked the path for the moves from turn8 to turn12 (which get us to turn13 at y=9) and it was safe.\n\nBut now we have an extra action at turn13: we are at y=9, which is safe, and we do S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: S   -> but wait, at turn13 we are already at y=9? Then why do we need to do an action? \n\nThe problem requires a sequence of H actions. With H=6, we take actions from turn8 to turn13.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at y=9 at turn13 (which is t1+6-1=8+5=13). And we are at y=9 at turn13, so we are safe. Then at turn13 we take an action (S) to stay, and then at turn14 we are still at 9, but we don't care.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 at an earlier turn? For example, at turn12? \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn12, we would have to have been at y=8 at turn11 and taken U at turn11 to get to y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn12.\n\nThen turn12 = 8+H-1 -> 8+H-1=12 -> H=5.\n\nThen we take actions at turns8,9,10,11,12.\n\nBut how do we get to y=9 at turn12? \n\nWe start at turn8: y8=4.\nAt turn9: y9=5 (U at8)\nAt turn10: y10=6 (U at9)\nAt turn11: y11=7 (U at10) -> then to get to y=8 at turn11? We cannot because we are at 7 at turn11.\n\nWe would need to be at y=8 at turn11 to then do U at turn11 to get to 9 at turn12.\n\nBut how to be at y=8 at turn11? That requires 4 ups in 3 moves: impossible.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn13.\n\nTherefore, H=6.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision on the way for this path:\n\nWe already checked:\n  turn8: y=4 -> freeway4: car (24,13,right,12) at dt=0 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n  turn9: y=5 -> freeway5: same car? freeway5 has car (24,13,right,12) -> at dt=1: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  turn10: y=6 -> freeway6: same car? [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n  turn11: y=7 -> freeway7: car (-48,-83,right,36) at dt=3: \n        a = -83 + 36*3 = -83+108=25, b=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] -> safe.\n  turn12: y=8 -> freeway8: three cars at dt=4 (since t1=8, dt=4):\n        car1: (-32,-43,right,4): a=-43+4*4=-43+16=-27, b=-32+16=-16 -> [-27,-16] -> safe.\n        car2: (44,33,right,4): a=33+16=49, b=44+16=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n        car3: (8,-3,right,4): a=-3+16=13, b=8+16=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\n  turn13: we are at y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nBut note: at turn13, we are at y=9 and we take an action S (or any) -> safe.\n\nBut the problem requires we avoid collisions on freeways only when we are on freeways (y=1..8). So at turn13, we are not on a freeway.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway2? We never step on freeway2? We go from y=4 to5 to6 to7 to8 to9. We skip freeways 1,2,3.\n\nBut freeway1,2,3 might be dangerous? But we never step on them, so we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6, and the actions are:\n\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: S   (or we could do U? but then we go to 10 which is not allowed? Or the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, we would go to 10 which is invalid? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So we cannot go above 9. Therefore, at y=9, we cannot do U. Similarly, we can do D or S. But to be safe, we do S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do D? but then we go to 8, which is a freeway and might be dangerous? But we are at turn13: \n  If we do D at turn13, then at turn14 we would be at y=8. But we don't care about turn14 because the goal is already met at turn13. However, the problem says we only care about collisions during the time we are moving? But note: collision occurs at turn T only if we are on a freeway at turn T. At turn13, we are at y=9 (safe). Then we take action D at turn13, and then at turn14 we are at y=8. But turn14 is beyond the last turn we care about? The problem doesn't say we have to avoid collisions after reaching the goal. It only says to avoid collisions during the game until we reach (0,9). And we reached at turn13.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways\" during the game. And the game is until we reach (0,9). So after we reach (0,9) at turn13, we have succeeded. The action we take at turn13 is after we have already reached? \n\nActually, at turn13, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action. But the goal is to reach (0,9), and we have reached at the start of turn13. So we don't care what happens after? However, the collision at turn14 (if we move down) would be a collision during the game? But the game might be considered to end when we reach the goal? The problem is not explicit.\n\nTo be safe, we should choose an action at turn13 that doesn't cause a collision at turn13? But at turn13, we are at y=9, so no collision. Then we move to y=8 at turn14, but that is after the goal turn (turn13) and we are not required to avoid collisions after the goal.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"avoid collisions\" throughout the sequence of actions? The sequence of actions we take must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. The turns we are on a freeway are turns8 to12. At turn13, we are not on a freeway. Then at turn14, if we move down, we would be at y=8 at turn14, which is a freeway, and then we would have to check freeway8 at turn14? But turn14 is not in the period we care about? \n\nSince the problem only requires to be at (0,9) at turn13, and we have taken the actions from turn8 to turn13, and during turns8 to13 we were safe (turn13 we are at y=9, safe), then it's acceptable.\n\nBut to be cautious, we can choose S at turn13 so that we remain at y=9 at turn14, which is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: S\n\nBut wait: we are required to output the actions for the turns starting at t1=8. And we take actions at turn8 to turn13.\n\nBut note: at turn13, we are already at the goal at the start. So we don't need to move. But the problem requires H actions. And H=6.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to be at y=9 earlier? We said no. But what if we take a faster route? For example, by going down first? That would not help.\n\nOr by using the fact that we can stay? But that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if there is a danger on freeway8 at turn12? We are at y=8 at turn12. We checked the cars at freeway8 at turn12 (dt=4) and they are safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8 at other turns? We are only at freeway8 at turn12. So we only check turn12.\n\nSimilarly, we are at freeway7 at turn11, and we checked.\n\nBut wait: in the car list, freeway1 has two cars, freeway8 has three. But we skip freeways 1,2,3.\n\nBut what about freeway2? It has a left-moving car: (0,23,left,24). At turn8, it is at [0,23]. At later turns, it moves left. So at turn8: [0,23] -> if we were on freeway2 at turn8, we would collide because 0 is in [0,23]? But we are not on freeway2 at turn8.\n\nAt turn9: the car moves to [0-24, 23-24] = [-24,-1] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo freeway2 is safe after turn8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1: \n  car1: (-32,-43,right,4) at turn8: [-43,-32] -> safe (0 not in)\n  car2: (32,21,right,4) at turn8: [21,32] -> safe.\nAt turn9: \n  car1: [-43+4, -32+4] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n  car2: [21+4,32+4]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway3: (-48,-83,right,36) at turn8: [-83,-48] -> safe.\nAt turn9: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4,5,6: the same car: (24,13,right,12) -> at turn8: freeway4: [13,24] -> safe.\nAt turn9: freeway5: [25,36] -> safe.\nAt turn10: freeway6: [37,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: (-48,-83,right,36) at turn11: we computed [25,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: at turn12: we computed safe.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We cannot.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut wait, why do we need to include turn13? Because H=6, so we take actions at turns 8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nBut at turn13, we are already at the goal. However, the problem requires the sequence until the last action at turn8+H-1=13.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to avoid the extra action? \n\nSuppose we only take 5 actions: then H=5, and we require to be at y=9 at turn8+5-1 = turn12.\n\nBut as we saw, we can only be at y=8 at turn12. \n\nUnless we can move faster? But we cannot.\n\nSo we must take 6 actions.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is correct.\n\nBut note: at turn13, we are at y=9, and we take S. Alternatively, we could take D or U? But U would go to 10 which is invalid? The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So we cannot do U at y=9. We can do D or S.\n\nIf we do D, then at turn14 we go to y=8. But then at turn14, we are on freeway8 and we might collide? But turn14 is after turn13, and we only care about being at 9 at turn13. So it's acceptable, but to avoid any issue, we do S.\n\nSo we choose S.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 8 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. The minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 6\\), meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + 6 - 1 = 13\\).\n\n### Path and Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 8 (y=4)**: The player is on freeway 4. The car on freeway 4 is (24, 13, right, 12). At turn 8 (dt=0), the span is [13, 24]. Since 0 is not in [13, 24], it is safe. Action: U (move up to y=5).\n- **Turn 9 (y=5)**: The player is on freeway 5. The car on freeway 5 is (24, 13, right, 12). At turn 9 (dt=1), the span is [13+12, 24+12] = [25, 36]. 0 is not in [25, 36], safe. Action: U (move up to y=6).\n- **Turn 10 (y=6)**: The player is on freeway 6. The car on freeway 6 is (24, 13, right, 12). At turn 10 (dt=2), the span is [13+24, 24+24] = [37, 48]. 0 is not in [37, 48], safe. Action: U (move up to y=7).\n- **Turn 11 (y=7)**: The player is on freeway 7. The car on freeway 7 is (-48, -83, right, 36). At turn 11 (dt=3), the span is [-83+108, -48+108] = [25, 60]. 0 is not in [25, 60], safe. Action: U (move up to y=8).\n- **Turn 12 (y=8)**: The player is on freeway 8. The cars are:\n  - (-32, -43, right, 4): At turn 12 (dt=4), span = [-43+16, -32+16] = [-27, -16]. 0 not in [-27, -16].\n  - (44, 33, right, 4): Span = [33+16, 44+16] = [49, 60]. 0 not in [49, 60].\n  - (8, -3, right, 4): Span = [-3+16, 8+16] = [13, 24]. 0 not in [13, 24].\n  Safe. Action: U (move up to y=9).\n- **Turn 13 (y=9)**: The player is at y=9, which has no freeway and is safe. The goal (0, 9) is reached at this turn. Action: S (stay, as moving up would go to y=10, which is invalid, and moving down is unnecessary).\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) to 6 and ensures no collisions occur on the path.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 9, and the player starts at y=5.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays the same). The y-position must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, about the cars: for each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars defined with their head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction is either left or right, which affects how they move.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\n- Left-moving cars: span moves left as time increases. So for a left-moving car, the head is at h, tail at τ at time t₁. Then at time T > t₁, the span is [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]. Since it's moving left, the positions decrease.\n\n- Right-moving cars: span moves right, so span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nIn the collision rule, it says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T. That means, at the moment the player is on that freeway, if there's a car whose span includes the x-position 0 at that exact turn, it's a collision.\n\nAlso, important note: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not considered on the new y until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nLet me parse that.\n\nAt turn T, you choose an action. If you choose U or D, you move to a new y position at turn T+1. But at the moment of turn T, when you are deciding and taking action, you are still on y_T for that turn.\n\nThe collision check happens at each turn T based on your position y_T and the car spans at that turn T.\n\nIf you are at y_T at turn T, and for that freeway y_T, if there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T, you collide.\n\nNow, if you move, say from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, but since the move happens at the end of the turn or something? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action a_t.\n\nSo at time t, you are at position (0, y_t). You take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at time t+1, you are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T: if at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, collision occurs.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you move, during the turn when you are moving, you are still on the old freeway for collision purposes.\n\nSpecifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nAt turn T, you are deciding to move, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so collision is based on y_T and cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision based on that.\n\nThe note says: \"thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nMeaning, even if at turn T, there is a car on y_{T+1} that has 0 in span at T, since you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, it doesn't affect you. Only when you are actually on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at turn T+1 on y_{T+1}, you check for collisions on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9 from y=5.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway with cars; the freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars there. The problem says \"freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should be car-free, so no collision risk there.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so at that point, no issue.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at turn t₁=9.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in minimal turns H.\n\nEach action changes y by -1, 0, or +1, so to go from 5 to 9, I need to increase y by 4, so at least 4 steps if I only go up. But I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, which could take more turns.\n\nSince I can stay, H could be more than 4.\n\nBut minimal H means I want to do it as fast as possible, so ideally with few S or D, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t₁=9.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway and each car, where their span is at turn T for T >=9.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, and cars move continuously, I need to simulate the positions over time.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions at t=9.\n\nt₁=9.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-28, -39, right, 4) and (36, 25, right, 4)\n\nDirection: right, so for right-moving cars, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nt₁=9.\n\nFirst car: head h=-28? Head and tail.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think, since it's moving right.\n\nIn the first one: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\n-28 and -39, -28 > -39, so head is -28, tail is -39? But if it's moving right, head should be the front, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail.\n\n-28 > -39, so head = -28, tail = -39.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-39 + 4(T-9), -28 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car on k=1: (36, 25, right, 4)\n\n36 and 25, 36>25, so head=36, tail=25? But 36>25, so for right-moving, head is larger.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 4(T-9), 36 + 4(T-9)]\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for freeway k, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that T.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nk=2: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-9), τ - s(T-9)]\n\nh=-24, τ=-1? Head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, if moving left, head should be less than tail? Let's see.\n\nDirection left: span moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nAt t₁, span [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn this case, h=-24, τ=-1. Now, -24 < -1, so if head is the front when moving, for left-moving, head should be smaller than tail? I think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nIt says Span(t₁) = [h, τ], so h and τ are the positions at t₁.\n\nThen for left-moving, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t₁), h + s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t₁), h + s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn right-moving, Span(t₁) is given as [τ, h], which might imply that τ is the left end and h is the right end, so for right-moving, τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], and since it moves left, h should be the right end? I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor left-moving: at t₁, span is [h, τ], and after, [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nSince it moves left, if [h, τ] at t₁, and h - s dt, τ - s dt, so if dt>0, positions decrease, so at t₁, h should be the rightmost point, τ the leftmost? But [h, τ] with h and τ, if h > τ, then [h, τ] would be from τ to h if τ < h, but the interval notation [a,b] usually assumes a<b.\n\nI think there's a issue with the interval notation.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, first car: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] according to the rule.\n\nIn the rule: for right-moving, \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\"\n\nSo for this car, τ = ? In the tuple, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but in the span notation, for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is the head.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], so h is one end, τ the other.\n\nBut which is which?\n\nFor consistency, let's assume that for both, the span is given as [min, max] or something? Not necessarily.\n\nIn the right-moving case, [τ, h] with τ and h, and for the car, the values are given, e.g. for first car on k=1: head=-28, tail=-39, but tail is less than head since -39 < -28, so for right-moving, τ should be tail, h head, so Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-39, -28]? But -39 to -28, which is from left to right.\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-39 +4(T-9), -28 +4(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36,25,right,4), head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36, Span(t₁) = [25,36]? But 25 to 36, yes.\n\nNow for left-moving, on k=2: (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-24, -1]\n\nBut -24 to -1, which is from -24 to -1, so if moving left, at later time, both decrease, so the span moves left.\n\nBut -24 < -1, so [h, τ] with h=-24, τ=-1, so h < τ, so the interval [h, τ] = [-24, -1] is from -24 to -1, which is increasing, but when it moves left, the values decrease, so the left end is h = -24, right end is τ = -1 at t₁.\n\nThen at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)] = [-24 -24(T-9), -1 -24(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the span is a closed interval, I assume, so 0 in span means min <= 0 <= max for the interval at that time.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, all need to be considered.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span expressions at time T, with t=9 as reference.\n\nSet dt = T - 9, so at time T = 9 + dt.\n\nFor each car, span as a function of dt.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCar 1: (-28, -39, right, 4) so for right-moving, τ = -39, h = -28? head and tail: given (head, tail) = (-28, -39), and since right, τ = tail = -39, h = head = -28\n\nSpan at T: [ -39 + 4*dt , -28 + 4*dt ] where dt = T-9\n\nCar 2: (36, 25, right, 4), head=36, tail=25, τ=25, h=36\n\nSpan: [25 + 4*dt, 36 + 4*dt]\n\nNow, 0 in span for car 1: if -39 +4dt <= 0 <= -28 +4dt\n\nSince -39 +4dt <= -28 +4dt always, so 0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSimilarly for car 2: 25 +4dt <= 0 <= 36 +4dt, but 25+4dt >0 for dt>=0, since 25>0, so 0 <= 25+4dt false, so never 0 in span for car 2 on k=1.\n\nSimilarly, car 1: low = -39 +4dt, high = -28 +4dt\n\n0 in span iff -39 +4dt <= 0 <= -28 +4dt\n\nWhich is iff 4dt <= 39 and 0 <= -28 +4dt? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-39 +4dt <= 0 => 4dt <= 39 => dt <= 39/4 = 9.75\n\nAnd 0 <= -28 +4dt => 28 <= 4dt => dt >= 7\n\nSo for dt between 7 and 9.75, 0 in span for car 1 on k=1.\n\nSince dt integer (turns), dt=7,8,9\n\nT=9+dt, so for T=16,17,18? dt=0 at T=9, dt=1 at T=10, etc.\n\ndt = T-9\n\nAt dt=7, T=16: low = -39 +4*7 = -39+28= -11, high= -28+28=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt dt=8, T=17: low=-39+32= -7, high=-28+32=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt dt=9, T=18: low=-39+36= -3, high=-28+36=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt dt=10, T=19: low=-39+40=1, high=-28+40=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for k=1, car 1 causes collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nCar 2 never, as 25+4dt >=25>0.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2):\n\nCar: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-24, -1]? h and τ given, dir left.\n\nIn the state: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-24, -1]\n\nBut -24 to -1, with -24 < -1, so the interval is from min to max: min=-24, max=-1.\n\nThen at T, [h - s dt, τ - s dt] = [-24 -24 dt, -1 -24 dt]\n\nSince s=24.\n\nSo span: [ -24 -24dt, -1 -24dt ]\n\n0 in span iff -24 -24dt <= 0 <= -1 -24dt\n\nNow, -24 -24dt <= 0 always for dt>=0? -24 -24dt <= -24 <0, so left inequality true for all dt.\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= -1 -24dt ? Which is 0 <= - (1 + 24dt) <0 for dt>=0, so false.\n\nThus, 0 never in span for this car on k=2.\n\nBecause min = -24 -24dt <= -24 <0, max = -1 -24dt <= -1 <0, so both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision on k=2 ever.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3):\n\nCar: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nRight-moving, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = -12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [-47 + 36 dt, -12 + 36 dt]\n\n0 in span iff -47 +36dt <= 0 <= -12 +36dt\n\nLeft: -47 +36dt <=0 => 36dt <=47 => dt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so dt <=1 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +36dt => 36dt >=12 => dt >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333, so dt >=1\n\nThus for dt=1, T=10\n\nAt dt=1, low=-47+36= -11, high=-12+36=24, [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt dt=0, T=9: low=-47, high=-12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt dt=2, T=11: low=-47+72=25, high=-12+72=60, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on k=3 only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4):\n\nCar: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nHead=36, tail=25, right, so τ=25, h=36\n\nSpan: [25 +12 dt, 36 +12 dt]\n\nBoth min and max >0 for dt>=0, so 0 never in span. No collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 (y=5):\n\nSame as k=4: (36,25,right,12), identical, no collision.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, (36,25,right,12), no collision.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7):\n\nCar: (-12,-47,right,36) same as k=3.\n\nSo collision only at T=10, same as above.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8):\n\nCars: (-28,-39,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4), same as on k=1, car1.\n\nτ=-39, h=-28, span: [-39 +4 dt, -28 +4 dt]\n\n0 in span for dt=7,8,9 as before.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, so τ=37, h=48\n\nSpan: [37 +4 dt, 48 +4 dt] >0, no 0.\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, τ=1, h=12\n\nSpan: [1 +4 dt, 12 +4 dt]\n\n0 in span? low=1+4dt >=1>0 for dt>=0, so 0 not <= low, since low>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nThus for k=8, only the first car can cause collision at dt=7,8,9, i.e., T=16,17,18.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=16,17,18\n\n- y=2: no collision\n\n- y=3: collision at T=10\n\n- y=4: no collision\n\n- y=5: no collision\n\n- y=6: no collision\n\n- y=7: collision at T=10\n\n- y=8: collision at T=16,17,18\n\ny=3 and y=7 both have collision only at T=10.\n\ny=1 and y=8 have collision at T=16,17,18.\n\ny=2,4,5,6 no collision at any time.\n\nThe player starts at y=5 at T=9 (t=9).\n\ny=5 has no collision, so at T=9, player is on y=5, and since no car on y=5 has 0 in span at T=9, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn, when on a freeway k, it must not be a collision time for that k.\n\nSince we move one step at a time, we can go up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid dangerous positions.\n\nThe dangerous freeways are:\n\n- At T=10, y=3 and y=7 are dangerous. So we should not be on y=3 or y=7 at T=10.\n\n- At T=16,17,18, y=1 and y=8 are dangerous. So avoid y=1 and y=8 at those times.\n\nOther times and other freeways are safe.\n\nNow, player at T=9, y=5.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up immediately: at T=9, action U, then y_{10} = y_9 +1 =6.\n\nAt T=10, position y=6.\n\ny=6 has no collision, so safe.\n\nThen from y=6, we can go up to y=7, but at T=11? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter action, y_{T+1} is for next turn.\n\nSo:\n\nAt T=9: y=5, take action a_9.\n\nThen y_{10} depends on a_9.\n\nThen at T=10, we are at y_{10}, and check collision based on y_{10} and cars at T=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nStart at T=9, y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H.\n\nSince we need to increase y by 4, minimum H=4 if we go up each time.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nOption: go up at T=9: a_9=U, then y_{10}=6\n\nAt T=10, y=6. Now y=6 is safe, as no collision ever.\n\nThen at T=10, take action a_{10}, say U, then y_{11}=7\n\nAt T=11, y=7.\n\nNow, y=7 has collision only at T=10, but T=11 is not T=10, so at T=11, no collision for y=7. The car on y=7 is dangerous only at T=10, not at other times.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=8.\n\nAt T=11, y=7, take U, y_{12}=8\n\nAt T=12, y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 has collision at T=16,17,18, but T=12 is earlier, so safe? We need to check if at T=12, for y=8, is there collision?\n\nFrom earlier, for k=8, first car span at T: [-39 +4(T-9), -28 +4(T-9)]\n\nAt T=12, dt=3, low=-39+12=-27, high=-28+12=-16, both negative, so 0 not in span. Other cars no issue, so safe.\n\nThen at T=12, take U, y_{13}=9\n\nAt T=13, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached.\n\nH=4 turns? From T=9 to T=13, that's 4 actions: at T=9,10,11,12 to reach y=13=9 at T=13.\n\ny_{t} at time t.\n\nAt t=9, y=5\n\nAfter action at t=9, y_{10} set.\n\nAt t=10, y=6\n\nAction at t=10, y_{11}=7\n\nAt t=11, y=7\n\nAction at t=11, y_{12}=8\n\nAt t=12, y=8\n\nAction at t=12, y_{13}=9\n\nAt t=13, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=9: y=5, safe.\n\nAt t=10: y=6, safe.\n\nAt t=11: y=7, now t=11, not 10, and y=7 dangerous only at t=10, so at t=11, no car has 0 in span? For y=7, at t=11, dt=2, car span: [-47 +36*2, -12 +36*2] = [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=12: y=8, as above, span [-39+4*3, -28+4*3] = [-39+12, -28+12] = [-27,-16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=13: y=9, no issue.\n\nSo this sequence: a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, and reached at t=13.\n\nBut t=13 is turn t₁ + H, with H=4? t₁=9, actions from t=9 to t=12, that's 4 actions, and at t=13, we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, and after H actions, we are at y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=4, actions at t=9,10,11,12, all U.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=4 seems minimal since we need +4 in y.\n\nBut are there any constraints that force us to take more turns?\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt t=10, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nWe avoided y=3 and y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, we are at y=8 at t=12, before the dangerous times t=16,17,18.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at t=13.\n\nPerhaps we can do it faster? From y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 steps, so H=4 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in less? No, because each action changes y by at most 1, so from 5 to 9, must have at least 4 up actions, and possibly stays or downs, but downs would require more ups, so minimum 4 actions.\n\nThus H=4 is achievable and minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, we used only ups, no downs or stays.\n\nBut is there a reason to use S or D? Not necessary here.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, it worked.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has car (-12,-47,right,36), which at t=10, dt=1, span [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24], 0 in, so at t=10, if on y=7, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at t=10, we are on y=6, not y=7.\n\nAt t=11, on y=7, but t=11, span [25,60], safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=1 and y=8 dangerous at t=16,17,18, but we are at y=8 at t=12, which is safe, and we leave to y=9 at t=13.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother path: could we go to y=4 or something? But no need, since we can go directly up.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we stay at some point.\n\nFor example, if we were forced to avoid, but here not necessary.\n\nAt t=10, y=3 and y=7 are dangerous, but we are not on them.\n\ny=5 is safe, so we could stay at y=5 at t=10, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we do S at t=9, then y_{10}=5, at t=10, y=5, safe, then later go up, but that takes more actions, H larger, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, going down not helpful.\n\nSo minimal is H=4 with all U.\n\nBut the player starts at y=5 at t=9.\n\nAction at t=9: U, to y=6\n\nAt t=10: U, to y=7\n\nAt t=11: U, to y=8\n\nAt t=12: U, to y=9, reached at t=13.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: actions from t=9 to t=12.\n\nt_{t1} = t_9, since t1=9.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t_1=9)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{11} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{12} = U\n\nH=4, so t from t_1 to t_1 +3.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=9,10,11,12.\n\nSo for t_1=9, actions: t=9,10,11,12.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8, but we are only on it at t=12, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=4.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: at t=10, y=6 is safe, but y=6 has a car? Freeway 6 has car (36,25,right,12), which at any time, min=25+12dt >=25>0, so 0 never in span, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4 and y=5 same.\n\ny=2 also safe.\n\ny=3 only dangerous at t=10, etc.\n\nIn our path, we never are on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But from t=9 start, after 1 action, at t=10, y=6, not 9.\n\nAfter 2 actions, t=11, y=7, not 9.\n\nAfter 3 actions, t=12, y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 4 actions, t=13, y=9.\n\nSo cannot reach before t=13.\n\nThus minimal H=4.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nAlso, the player position: at t=9, y=5.\n\nAfter U, t=10, y=6.\n\nAfter U, t=11, y=7.\n\nAfter U, t=12, y=8.\n\nAfter U, t=13, y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSuppose we go down first, but that would be worse.\n\nOr stay, worse.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 8, there is a car (12,1,right,4), but we saw that min=1+4dt>=1>0, so never 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think H=4 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nSequence: a_{9} = U, a_{10} = U, a_{11} = U, a_{12} = U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut the turn is written as t_1, but since t_1=9, it should be Turn 9, etc.\n\nIn the box, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" but since t_1=9, it can be written as numbers.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nThe problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so in the box, we can write the numbers.\n\nSince t_1=9 given.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 4, achieved by moving up (U) at each turn. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the car states and collision rules.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **At turn \\(t = 9\\)**: Player is at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 has a car \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\). The span at \\(t = 9\\) is \\([25 + 12(0), 36 + 12(0)] = [25, 36]\\), which does not contain 0. Thus, no collision.\n- **At turn \\(t = 10\\)**: Player is at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 has a car \\((36, 25, \\text{right}, 12)\\). The span at \\(t = 10\\) (dt = 1) is \\([25 + 12(1), 36 + 12(1)] = [37, 48]\\), which does not contain 0. Thus, no collision.\n- **At turn \\(t = 11\\)**: Player is at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 has a car \\((-12, -47, \\text{right}, 36)\\). The span at \\(t = 11\\) (dt = 2) is \\([-47 + 36(2), -12 + 36(2)] = [25, 60]\\), which does not contain 0. Although freeway 7 is dangerous at \\(t = 10\\), it is safe at \\(t = 11\\). Thus, no collision.\n- **At turn \\(t = 12\\)**: Player is at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 has cars:\n  - \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span at \\(t = 12\\) (dt = 3) is \\([-39 + 4(3), -28 + 4(3)] = [-27, -16]\\), which does not contain 0.\n  - \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span is \\([37 + 4(3), 48 + 4(3)] = [49, 60]\\), which does not contain 0.\n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span is \\([1 + 4(3), 12 + 4(3)] = [13, 24]\\), which does not contain 0.\n  Thus, no collision.\n- **At turn \\(t = 13\\)**: Player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway (no cars), so no collision is possible. The target \\((0, 9)\\) is reached.\n\nThe sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 4 turns, and since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, \\(H = 4\\) is minimal (as increasing \\(y\\) from 5 to 9 requires at least 4 up moves).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 9\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t₁ = 10, and the player starts at y=6.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So y can be from 0 to 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8), and at that exact turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span. The span is the position of the car on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, we care about whether x=0 is covered by the car at turn T.\n\nThe car positions change over time based on their speed and direction. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right. The update is given relative to turn t₁.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn t₁ = 10.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars: \n  - First: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed 4. But direction right means it's moving right, so the span should be [τ, h] since right-moving cars have τ < h? Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]. Similarly, left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)].\n\nIn the state, it says for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4) and (40, 29, right, 4). But for the first car, head h=-24, tail τ=-35. If it's right-moving, and τ=-35, h=-24, so τ < h, so the span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]. Similarly, second car: (40,29,right,4), but 29 to 40? That might be a typo or misorder.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor the first car on freeway 1: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSince direction is right, the tail should be on the left, head on the right, so span is [tail, head] = [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (40, 29, right, 4), head=40, tail=29? But 29 < 40, so if right-moving, tail should be less than head, so span [29,40].\n\nBut in the list, it says (40,29,right,4), so head=40, tail=29, so for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [29,40].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t₁ is [h, τ]? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and then moves left.\n\nHere h=-48, τ=-25? -48 to -25, but if left-moving, head should be on the left? I think I need to clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] meaning head at h, tail at τ, and since it moves left, h decreases.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 2: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nSo for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-48, -25], but -48 < -25, so the head is at -48, tail at -25? That seems odd because usually head is the front.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates: since it's moving left, the head is at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nFor example, if moving left, at time t, head at x, tail at x+L or something.\n\nBut in terms of span, for collision, we care if 0 is in [min, max] of the span.\n\nFor left-moving car: Span(t₁) = [h, τ], and h and τ such that for left-moving, h is the head position at left, τ is tail at right, so if moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the update: \"Left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nSo the interval [h, τ] shifts left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], so the interval [τ, h] shifts right by s per turn.\n\nIn freeway 2: (-48, -25, left, 24), so h=-48, τ=-25, so Span(t₁) = [h, τ] = [-48, -25]. Since left-moving, it moves left.\n\nBut numerically, -48 < -25, so the interval is from -48 to -25, which is from left to right? No: x from left to right, smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nSo position x=-48 is left of x=-25. So if the car is moving left, its head is at left, so at t₁, head at h=-48, tail at τ=-25.\n\nAs it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow let's list all cars at t₁=10.\n\nFreeway 1:\n- Car 1: right-moving, τ=-35, h=-24, s=4, so span at t₁: [-35, -24]\n- Car 2: right-moving, head=40, tail=29? (40,29,right,4), so τ=29, h=40, s=4, span at t₁: [29,40]\n\nFreeway 2:\n- Only one car: left-moving, h=-48, τ=-25, s=24, span at t₁: [h,τ] = [-48, -25]\n\nFreeway 3:\n- (24, -11, right, 36) — head=24, tail=-11? (24,-11,right,36), so for right-moving, span should be [τ,h] = [-11,24]\n\nBecause τ is tail, h is head, for right-moving, tail left, head right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (48,37,right,12), so τ=37, h=48, span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? (48,37,right,12), so same [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4 and 5? (48,37,right,12), so [37,48]\n\nFreeway 7: (24,-11,right,36), same as freeway 3, [ -11,24]\n\nFreeway 8: three cars: (-24,-35,right,4) — τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35,-24]\n\nThen (52,41,right,4) — head=52, tail=41, span [41,52]\n\nAnd (16,5,right,4) — head=16, tail=5, span [5,16]\n\nNow, the player is at y=6 at turn t₁=10.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in minimal turns, avoiding being on a freeway y when at that turn, there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span.\n\nNote that when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check collision for that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, if you move to a different y, you are not on the new y until the next turn.\n\nSpecifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at each turn, you are only at risk on your current y freeway for that turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is the top, but y=9 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so no collision possible at y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6, which is freeway 6.\n\nAt turn t₁=10, player is on freeway 6.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, there is a car: (48,37,right,12), span at t₁=10: [37,48]\n\nIs 0 in [37,48]? 0 < 37, so no, 0 not in span, so no collision at turn 10 on freeway 6.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. Since we start at y=6, to go up to y=9, we need at least 3 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 3.\n\nMinimal H is at least 3, but probably more due to obstacles.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nEach turn, we choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=0 relative to t₁, so at relative time t=0, turn t₁, position y=6.\n\nAt time t (relative), the absolute turn is T = t₁ + t = 10 + t.\n\nPlayer position y_{t} for t=0,1,2,... with y_0 = 6.\n\nAction at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAt each absolute turn T, when player is at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that no car on freeway y_T has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe cars move continuously, so for each car, we can find when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with given (h, τ, d, s) at t₁, we can find for which T, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nThen, for each freeway, we can find the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the set of turns T where there is a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nSince T is discrete, and cars move at integer speeds, I assume.\n\nTurn T, so time is discrete.\n\nAbsolute turn T.\n\nFor each car, we can solve for when 0 is in Span(T).\n\nFirst, for a left-moving car: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)]\n\n0 in this if min <= 0 <= max of the interval.\n\nSince it's moving left, and h < τ for left-moving? In the notation, for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], and since moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the case where h and τ, with h < τ or h > τ?\n\nIn freeway 2 example, h=-48, τ=-25, h < τ, so [h, τ] = [-48, -25], min h, max τ.\n\nThen Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSo min = h - s(T-t₁), max = τ - s(T-t₁)\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so h - s(T-t₁) <= 0 and 0 <= τ - s(T-t₁)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nGeneral case:\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span:\n\nIf left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nWith min = h - s(T-t₁), max = τ - s(T-t₁)\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., h - s(T-t₁) <= 0 and 0 <= τ - s(T-t₁)\n\nWhich is h <= s(T-t₁) and s(T-t₁) <= τ\n\nFrom h - s(T-t₁) <= 0 => s(T-t₁) >= h\n\nAnd 0 <= τ - s(T-t₁) => s(T-t₁) <= τ\n\nSo s(T-t₁) >= h and s(T-t₁) <= τ\n\nBut h and τ, for left-moving, in example h=-48, τ=-25, so s(T-t₁) >= -48 and s(T-t₁) <= -25\n\nSince s>0, T-t₁ >= ceil(-48/s) etc., but let's keep inequalities.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nMin = τ + s(T-t₁), max = h + s(T-t₁)\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so τ + s(T-t₁) <= 0 and 0 <= h + s(T-t₁)\n\nSo τ + s(T-t₁) <= 0 and h + s(T-t₁) >= 0\n\nWhich is s(T-t₁) <= -τ and s(T-t₁) >= -h\n\nNow, let's list all cars and find when each has 0 in span.\n\nFirst, set t₁ = 10.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t₁, so for turn T, Δt = T - 10.\n\nThen for each car, find Δt such that 0 in Span(T).\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCar 1: right-moving, τ=-35, h=-24, s=4\n\nRight-moving, so 0 in span if:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 and h + s Δt >= 0\n\n-35 + 4 Δt <= 0 and -24 + 4 Δt >= 0\n\nSo 4 Δt <= 35 and 4 Δt >= 24\n\nΔt <= 35/4 = 8.75, so Δt <= 8 since integer? T integer, Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T - 10, integer.\n\nSo 4 Δt <= 35, Δt <= floor(35/4) = 8.75, so Δt <= 8\n\n4 Δt >= 24, Δt >= ceil(24/4) = 6\n\nSo Δt >= 6 and Δt <= 8\n\nSimilarly, h + s Δt >=0: -24 +4 Δt >=0, 4Δt >=24, Δt >=6\n\nτ + s Δt <=0: -35 +4 Δt <=0, 4Δt <=35, Δt <=8.75, so Δt <=8\n\nSo for Δt =6,7,8\n\nCar 2 on freeway 1: right-moving, τ=29, h=40, s=4\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt <=0 and h + s Δt >=0\n\n29 + 4 Δt <=0? 29 +4Δt <=0? But 29>0, s>0, so 29 +4Δt >0 always, so min = τ + s Δt =29+4Δt >0, so 0 < min, so 0 not <= min, thus never in span since min >0 and increasing. So no collision possible for this car.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars with min>0 or max<0.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, left-moving, h=-48, τ=-25, s=24\n\nLeft-moving, 0 in span if:\n\ns Δt >= h and s Δt <= τ\n\ns Δt >= -48 and s Δt <= -25\n\n24 Δt >= -48 and 24 Δt <= -25\n\nFirst inequality: 24 Δt >= -48, divide by 24, Δt >= -2\n\nSecond: 24 Δt <= -25, Δt <= -25/24 ≈ -1.041, so Δt <= -2 since integer? Δt <= floor(-1.041) = -2? Let's see.\n\n24 Δt <= -25, so Δt <= -25/24 = -1.041, so since Δt integer, Δt <= -2? -25/24 = -1.041, so Δt <= ceil(-1.041) no.\n\nΔt <= -1.041, so since Δt integer, Δt <= -2? For example Δt=-2, 24*(-2)= -48 <= -25? -48 <= -25 true, but we have s Δt <= τ, τ=-25.\n\ns Δt <= τ: 24 Δt <= -25\n\nFor Δt = -2, 24*(-2) = -48 <= -25 true\n\nFor Δt = -1, 24*(-1) = -24 <= -25? -24 > -25, false, so not <= -25.\n\nSimilarly, s Δt >= h: 24 Δt >= -48\n\nFor Δt >= -2, since -48/24 = -2.\n\nSo for Δt >= -2 and Δt <= -2? From s Δt >= h: Δt >= ceil(-48/24) = ceil(-2) = -2\n\ns Δt <= τ: Δt <= floor(-25/24) = floor(-1.041) = -2? -25/24 = -1.041, floor is -2? Floor of -1.041 is -2? No, floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so floor(-1.041) = -2? -2 < -1.041, but -1.041 is greater than -2, so floor is -2? No.\n\n-1.041, integers less than or equal: -2, -3, etc., greatest is -2? But -2 < -1.041, and -1 > -1.041? -1 > -1.041, so not <=, so floor(-1.041) = -2.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-1.041) = -1.\n\nBut for inequality: s Δt <= τ: 24 Δt <= -25\n\nSince 24 Δt is integer multiple? But -25 not multiple, but we need 24 Δt <= -25\n\nFor Δt = -2, 24*(-2) = -48 <= -25 true\n\nΔt = -1, 24*(-1) = -24 > -25, false\n\nΔt = -3, 24*(-3) = -72 <= -25 true, but we have also s Δt >= h\n\ns Δt >= h: 24 Δt >= -48\n\nΔt >= ceil(-48/24) = ceil(-2) = -2\n\nSo Δt >= -2 and Δt <= ? from s Δt <= τ: 24 Δt <= -25\n\nSince 24 Δt must be integer, and <= -25, so 24 Δt <= -25, which for integer Δt, since 24>0, Δt <= floor(-25/24) but -25/24 not integer.\n\nThe values: Δt = -2: 24*(-2) = -48 <= -25 true\n\nΔt = -1: -24 <= -25 false\n\nΔt = -3: -72 <= -25 true\n\nBut s Δt >= h: Δt >= -2, so Δt = -2: 24*(-2) = -48 >= -48 true\n\nΔt = -3: -72 >= -48? -72 < -48 false\n\nSo only Δt = -2 satisfies both.\n\ns Δt >= h: for Δt = -2, 24*(-2) = -48 >= -48 true\n\ns Δt <= τ: -48 <= -25 true\n\nFor other Δt, not both true.\n\nSo only at Δt = -2, which is T = t₁ + Δt = 10 - 2 = 8\n\nSo at turn T=8, this car has 0 in span.\n\nBut we are at turn t₁=10, so in the future, Δt >=0, so for Δt >=0, no collision for this car, since at Δt=0, s Δt=0, h=-48, τ=-25, 0 not in [-48,-25]? 0 > -25? Max is τ - s Δt, at Δt=0, max=τ=-25<0, min=h=-48<0, but 0 > max, so not in span. Similarly for other times.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only possible collision at T=8, but we start from T=10, so for T>=10, no issue.\n\nNow freeway 3: (24, -11, right, 36) — head=24, tail=-11? (24,-11,right,36)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t₁: [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\n0 in span at T if:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 and h + s Δt >= 0\n\nτ = -11, h=24, s=36\n\nSo -11 + 36 Δt <= 0 and 24 + 36 Δt >= 0\n\nFirst: -11 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 11 => Δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so Δt <= 0\n\nSecond: 24 + 36 Δt >= 0 always true for Δt >=0\n\nSo only when Δt <= 0, but Δt >=0 for future, at Δt=0, τ + s*0 = -11 <=0 true, h + s*0=24>=0 true, so at Δt=0, T=10, 0 is in span.\n\nAt T=10, Δt=0, min = τ + s*0 = -11, max = h + s*0 =24, so [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24, yes.\n\nFor Δt=1, min = -11 +36=25 >0, so 0 not <= min, not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, collision at T=10 only? T=10.\n\nBut player is on freeway 6 at T=10, not freeway 3, so no issue for player, but for freeway 3, it is occupied at x=0 only at T=10.\n\nBut since player is not on it, ok.\n\nNow for the player, we care only when on that freeway.\n\nBack to freeway 3: at T=10, if player were on y=3, collision, but not.\n\nFor future, no collision on freeway 3 for T>10.\n\nNow freeway 4: (48,37,right,12), τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nRight-moving, min = τ + s Δt =37 +12 Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so always min>0, never 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4, (48,37,right,12), same, min=37+12Δt>0, no.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (48,37,right,12), min=37+12Δt>0, no collision ever.\n\nAt T=10, on freeway 6, span [37,48], 0 not in, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 7: (24,-11,right,36), same as freeway 3, head=24, tail=-11, s=36\n\nSo same as freeway 3: at Δt=0, T=10, 0 in span [-11,24]\n\nFor other times, not.\n\nSo at T=10, if on y=7, collision, but player not on it.\n\nNow freeway 8: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4), τ=-35, h=-24, s=4\n\nRight-moving, 0 in span if τ + s Δt <=0 and h + s Δt >=0\n\n-35 +4 Δt <=0 and -24 +4 Δt >=0\n\n4 Δt <=35, Δt <=8.75, Δt<=8\n\n4 Δt >=24, Δt >=6\n\nSo Δt=6,7,8\n\nT=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: (52,41,right,4), τ=41, h=52, s=4\n\nmin =41 +4 Δt >0, always, no collision.\n\nThird car: (16,5,right,4), τ=5, h=16, s=4\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt <=0 and h + s Δt >=0\n\n5 +4 Δt <=0? 5+4Δt <=0, impossible for Δt>=0, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car can cause collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the dangerous times when if player is on that freeway, collision occurs.\n\nFreeway 1: car 1 at T=16,17,18? Earlier for freeway 1 car1: at Δt=6,7,8, T=16,17,18\n\nT=t₁ + Δt=10+6=16, 17,18\n\nAnd car2 no issue.\n\nFreeway 2: only at T=8, not in future.\n\nFreeway 3: at T=10 only\n\nFreeway 4: never\n\nFreeway 5: never\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: at T=10 only\n\nFreeway 8: at T=16,17,18\n\nNow, player starts at y=6 at T=10.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny from 6 to 9, minimal 3 up moves.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nAt T=10, player on y=6, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we plan actions for t=0,1,2,... relative, with y_t at turn T=10+t.\n\nAt time t (relative), absolute turn T=10+t.\n\nPosition y_t.\n\nAction a_t at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAt each turn T, when at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must not be dangerous at T.\n\nSince we start at t=0, T=10, y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up: U,U,U to reach y=9 at t=3, T=13.\n\nCheck the positions:\n\nAt t=0, T=10: y=6, freeway 6, safe as we saw.\n\nAction a0: say U, then y1 = y0 +1 =7\n\nAt t=1, T=11: position y=7\n\nNow, freeway 7: dangerous at T=10, but T=11, not dangerous? For freeway 7, we have car at (24,-11,right,36), at T=10, 0 in span, but at T=11, Δt=1, min= τ + s Δt = -11 +36*1=25>0, max=24+36=60, so [25,60], min>0, 0 not in span. So safe at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, action a1: U, y2=8\n\nAt t=2, T=12: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at T=16,17,18, not at T=12.\n\nIs there any car on freeway 8 at T=12?\n\nFreeway 8 cars: first car at [-35,-24] at T=10, moving right, at T=12, Δt=2, span [ -35 +4*2, -24 +4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16], min=-27, max=-16, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nOther cars: second [41,52] at T=10, at T=12 [41+8,52+8]=[49,60]>0\n\nThird [5,16] at T=10, at T=12 [5+8,16+8]=[13,24]>0\n\nSo all spans away from 0, safe.\n\nThen action a2: U, y3=9\n\nAt t=3, T=13: y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached y=9.\n\nNow, at turn T=13, we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions at t=0,1,2: U,U,U\n\nRelative to t₁: at turn t₁: a_{t₁} = U (action at turn 10)\n\nThen turn t₁+1: a_{t₁+1} = U\n\nTurn t₁+2: a_{t₁+2} = U\n\nThen at turn t₁+3, we are at y=9, so H=3 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart at turn t₁=10, position after action? I need to define carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"at turn T, player position (0, y_T)\", and \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", where Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at position (0,9) at some turn, meaning that at that turn, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we have performed actions from t=t₁ to t=t₁+H-1, and at turn t₁ + H, we are at y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart: at turn t₁, position y_{t₁} =6\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, we get y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{a_{t₁}}\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, position y_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{t₁+1} to y_{t₁+H}\n\nThe last position is at turn t₁+H, with y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nWe need min H such that y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with three up actions:\n\nAt turn t₁=10: y=6, choose a_{10}=U, so y_{11} =6+1=7\n\nAt turn 11: y=7, choose a_{11}=U, y_{12}=8\n\nAt turn 12: y=8, choose a_{12}=U, y_{13}=9\n\nAt turn 13: y=9, reached.\n\nAnd we checked that at each turn from 10 to 12, when on freeway, no collision:\n\nT=10, y=6: safe\n\nT=11, y=7: safe, as freeway 7 not dangerous at T=11\n\nT=12, y=8: safe, freeway 8 not dangerous at T=12\n\nAnd T=13, y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo in 3 turns, we reach at turn 13.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? The minimal number of turns H.\n\nWe started at turn 10, ended at turn 13, so we used turns 10,11,12 to act, and at turn 13 we are there, so H=3 actions? But H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, actions at t₁, t₁+1, t₁+2, so H=3.\n\nAnd reached at turn t₁ + H =13.\n\nNow, is this possible? But we need to make sure about the collision when moving.\n\nIn this path, we moved directly up, and no dangerous times for the freeways we were on.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 7 at T=11.\n\nFreeway 7 car: at T=10, span [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt T=11, Δt=1, min= τ + s Δt = -11 +36*1=25, max=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=12: cars, first car span at T=10: [-35,-24], at T=12, [-35+4*2, -24+4*2]=[-27,-16], not include 0.\n\nOthers away.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot do this? The player was at y=6 at T=10, and we moved up immediately.\n\nBut in the car states, for example, freeway 6 is always safe, but we left it.\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's see if we need to consider staying or something, but minimal H=3 should work.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 3 and 7 at T=10, but player not on them.\n\nAnother thing: when we move from y=6 to y=7 at turn T=10, after action, but at turn T=10, we are on y=6, and we choose to move to y=7.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nIn this case, at T=10, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nWe choose U, so y_{11}=7.\n\nAt turn T=10, we are not on y=7, so even if freeway 7 had collision at T=10, it doesn't affect us, which it did, but we were not on it.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, we are on y=7, which is safe at T=11.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo with three U moves, we can reach in H=3.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (which is a_{10})\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{11} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{12} = U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +3 =13, position (0,9)\n\nH=3.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9)\n\nIn this case, H=3, actions at turn 10,11,12: all U.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 6 at some time? Freeway 6 is safe always, but we are not on it later.\n\nBut in the path, we are on freeways only at T=10 y=6, T=11 y=7, T=12 y=8, all safe at those times.\n\nT=12 y=8: freeway 8, we have cars, but at T=12, as above, no car at x=0.\n\nEarlier I calculated for freeway 8 at T=12: spans are [-27,-16], [49,60], [13,24], all not contain 0.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut what about freeway 1? We are not on freeway 1, so no need.\n\nBut just to be thorough, freeway 1 dangerous at T=16,17,18, but we are done by T=13.\n\nSimilarly, no other dangers.\n\nSo it seems possible in 3 turns.\n\nBut the player starts at y=6, which is freeway 6, and we move up.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 moves, cannot faster.\n\nWith stay or down, it would take more turns, so H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car at [5,16] at T=10, but we are not on freeway 8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=12, when we are on y=8, the car is at [13,24], not 0.\n\nBut is there any car that might be at x=0 at other times?\n\nFor example, freeway 2: only at T=8, not issue.\n\nFreeway 3 and 7 at T=10, but not when we are on.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway 7 at T=11.\n\nFreeway 7: car (24,-11,right,36) at T=10: span [-11,24]\n\nAt T=11: Δt=1, span [ -11 +36*1, 24 +36*1] = [25,60], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3, with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=3.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason it might not work, or if I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the player position update.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt T=10: y=6, choose a=U, so y_{11}=7\n\nAt T=11: y=7, choose a=U, y_{12}=8\n\nAt T=12: y=8, choose a=U, y_{13}=9\n\nAt T=13: y=9, reached.\n\nCollision checked at each T when on freeway: T=10 y=6: safe\n\nT=11 y=7: safe\n\nT=12 y=8: safe\n\nNo collision.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But at T=10, we are at y=6, after one action at T=10, we can be at y=7 at T=11, etc., cannot be at y=9 before T=13.\n\nUnless we start at y=6 and in one action go to y=9, but not possible, only change by ±1 or 0.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 8, there is a car (16,5,right,4), which at T=10 span [5,16], and 0 not in, but at some time it might be, but min=5>0, so never, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: U  (a_{10})\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U  (a_{11})\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U  (a_{12})\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's up to t_1 + H-1, which is t_1 +2 for H=3.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at T=12 on freeway 8 is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nFirst car: at T=10: [-35,-24], moving right, speed 4.\n\nAt T=12: Δt=2, position [ -35 + 4*2, -24 + 4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27, -16]\n\n-27 to -16, x=0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (52,41,right,4), at T=10 [41,52], at T=12 [41+8,52+8]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nThird car: (16,5,right,4), at T=10 [5,16], at T=12 [5+8,16+8]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nAll fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 6\\). The car on freeway 6 has a span of \\([37, 48]\\) at \\(t = 10\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(t = 11\\): The car on freeway 7 has a span of \\([-11, 24]\\) at \\(t = 10\\), but at \\(t = 11\\) (with \\(\\Delta t = 1\\)), the span is \\([-11 + 36 \\times 1, 24 + 36 \\times 1] = [25, 60]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(t = 12\\): The cars on freeway 8 at \\(t = 12\\) (with \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)) are:\n  - First car: span at \\(t = 10\\) is \\([-35, -24]\\), so at \\(t = 12\\): \\([-35 + 4 \\times 2, -24 + 4 \\times 2] = [-27, -16]\\), no 0.\n  - Second car: span at \\(t = 10\\) is \\([41, 52]\\), so at \\(t = 12\\): \\([41 + 4 \\times 2, 52 + 4 \\times 2] = [49, 60]\\), no 0.\n  - Third car: span at \\(t = 10\\) is \\([5, 16]\\), so at \\(t = 12\\): \\([5 + 4 \\times 2, 16 + 4 \\times 2] = [13, 24]\\), no 0.\n  Thus, freeway 8 is safe at \\(t = 12\\).\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 13\\): \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, so no collision is possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions is three consecutive \"U\" (up) moves, taking 3 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- \\(H = 3\\) turns.\n- Actions:\n  - At turn \\(t_1 = 10\\): move up (\\(a_{10} = U\\))\n  - At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 11\\): move up (\\(a_{11} = U\\))\n  - At turn \\(t_1 + 2 = 12\\): move up (\\(a_{12} = U\\))\n\nAt turn \\(t_1 + 3 = 13\\), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } t_1: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 11 and the player is at (0,7). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). The player moves by U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay: y unchanged). The player can only be at integer y in [0,9]. At each turn T, if the player is at freeway k (so y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) then we must avoid having the car on that freeway k having its span covering 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on the freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and then at turn T+1 the player is on y'. Therefore, when moving from one freeway to another, we are only at the starting freeway at the moment of the turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1=11 until we reach y=9.\n\nGiven the car states at turn t1=11:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: \n  car1: (-20, -31, right, 4) -> note: for right-moving, the head is the larger number? Actually, the representation says: for right-moving: [tau, h] meaning the tail is at tau and head at h? But in the table it's written as (head, tail, ...) which is inconsistent. Let me check the update rule:\n\nThe update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially at t1: [tau, h] -> but the table says (head, tail, ...). So in the table, the first number is head and the second is tail? But for right-moving, the head should be the rightmost (larger x) and tail the leftmost. So the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut note the update:\n  Right-moving: [tau, h] at t1 -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nSo if at t1 the car is given as (h, tau, right, s), then actually the head is h and tail is tau, and since it's right-moving, the head is the right end and tail the left. But wait: the update rule says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> ... meaning that the tail is the left end and head the right? So the representation in the table for a right-moving car is (head, tail) meaning (h, tau) with h>tau? \n\nLooking at the update: \n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (so tau is the left end and h the right end). Therefore, the table entry for a right-moving car: (head, tail) = (h, tau) with h>tau.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the update rule says: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the initial span is [h, tau] meaning h is the left end and tau the right end? Actually, no: the update rule says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be the leftmost? Actually, the problem doesn't specify which is head and tail in terms of front, but the update rule is clear: the entire span moves.\n\nHowever, note the collision condition: we care when 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nSo we can compute for each freeway and each car, the position of the car at any future turn T (relative to t1=11).\n\nWe are to plan from turn 11 onward. We start at y=7 at turn 11.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). So we must go from 7 to 8 to 9? But we might have to wait to avoid cars.\n\nNote: when at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. So we are safe there. Also, we start at y=7 (freeway 7) and we need to go to y=8 and then y=9.\n\nBut we must check at each turn when we are on a freeway (1 to 8) whether there is a car on that freeway whose span covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to output the actions for the minimal H.\n\nLet me denote T = t - t1, so at T=0: turn 11, we are at y=7.\n\nWe need to compute the car positions at future turns (relative to t1=11) for each freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, the span at turn t1 + t (so t turns after t1) as:\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s at turn t1:\n\nIf d is 'right':\n  head(t) = h + s * t\n  tail(t) = tau + s * t   [so the span is [tau + s*t, h + s*t]]\n\nIf d is 'left':\n  head(t) = h - s * t\n  tail(t) = tau - s * t   [so the span is [h - s*t, tau - s*t]? But wait: the update rule for left says: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and note that since the car is moving left, the head (which was at h) is moving left, so the entire segment shifts left. But the representation in the table for left-moving: the first number is head and second is tail? And in the update, the span is [h - s*t, tau - s*t]. However, note that for a left-moving car, the head (front) should be the leftmost? But the update rule does not specify the order. We only care about the interval.\n\nActually, the collision condition is: 0 in [min, max] of the span. So we can represent the car at turn t (relative to t1) as:\n\n  [min(t), max(t)] = \n      if right: [tau + s*t, h + s*t]   (since tau <= h, so min=tau+s*t, max=h+s*t)\n      if left: [h - s*t, tau - s*t]? But wait: the update rule says for left: [h - s*t, tau - s*t]. However, note that in the initial state for left, the span is [h, tau] meaning the left end is h and the right end is tau? But if the car is moving left, then the initial head (front) is at h (the left end) and tail at tau (the right end). So the interval is [h, tau] and then it moves left. But if h <= tau, then the interval is [h, tau]. However, in the given data for freeway 2: (-72, -49, left, 24). Here h=-72, tau=-49. Since the car is moving left, the initial span is [h, tau] = [-72, -49]. Then at turn t, it becomes [h - s*t, tau - s*t] = [-72 -24*t, -49 -24*t].\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: the initial span is [tau, h] (so the left end is tau and right end is h). Therefore, we must have tau <= h. In the data, for freeway1: (-20,-31,right,4) -> wait, tau=-31 and h=-20? But then -31 <= -20 is true. So the span is [-31, -20] at t1.\n\nBut note: the table says (head, tail) and then direction. So for freeway1, the first car: head=-20, tail=-31, right -> so the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-31, -20]. Similarly, the second car: (44,33,right,4) -> [33,44].\n\nSo let me recompute for each freeway the cars and their spans at any time t (relative to t1=11, so t=0 at turn11).\n\nWe are particularly interested in freeways 7 and 8 because we start at 7 and then go to 8 and then to 9. But we might also consider going down? However, going down from 7 to 6 would be away from 9 and might not be optimal. So we aim to go up: 7 -> 8 -> 9. However, we might have to wait at 7 or 8 to avoid cars.\n\nSo we need to check:\n\nAt freeway 7: at turn t (relative to t1=11, so absolute turn = 11+t) we are at freeway 7 only if we are at y=7 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nThe cars on freeway 7: \n  (60, 25, right, 36) -> wait, that seems inconsistent because 60>25, so for a right-moving car the span should be [tail, head] = [25,60]? But the table says (head, tail) = (60,25) and direction right. So the span at t1 is [25,60]. Then at time t (after t1), the span becomes [25 + 36*t, 60 + 36*t].\n\nBut note: the car is on freeway 7. We are at (0,7). We collide at turn t if 0 is in [25+36t, 60+36t]. Since 25+36t and 60+36t are always positive (for t>=0), and 0 is not in that interval? Actually, 25+36t is at least 25, which is greater than 0. So 0 is never in [25+36t, 60+36t]. Therefore, freeway 7 is always safe? \n\nBut wait: what if the car is moving and the span covers 0? The span [25+36t, 60+36t] for t>=0: the smallest value is 25 (at t=0) and then increases. So 0 is never in the interval. So freeway 7 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 8: \n  cars: (-20, -31, right, 4), (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n\nBut wait: the representation: \n  first car: head=-20, tail=-31, right -> span at t1: [tail, head] = [-31, -20]\n  second car: head=56, tail=45? -> but 56>45, so span = [45,56]? But wait, the table says (56,45,right,4) -> so head=56, tail=45 -> so the car spans from 45 to 56? But that doesn't make sense for a car: the tail should be the rear. For a right-moving car, the head (front) is at the right, so the tail is at the left. So the car is from tail to head: [45,56]. \n  third car: (20,9,right,4) -> so head=20, tail=9 -> so the car spans [9,20].\n\nSo the three cars on freeway8 at t1=11:\n  car1: [-31, -20]\n  car2: [45, 56]\n  car3: [9, 20]\n\nAt time t (after t1), the spans become:\n  car1: [-31 + 4*t, -20 + 4*t]\n  car2: [45 + 4*t, 56 + 4*t]\n  car3: [9 + 4*t, 20 + 4*t]\n\nWe are at freeway8 at a turn if we are at y=8 at that turn. We must avoid having 0 in any of the three intervals at that turn.\n\nSo we need to check for which t (>=0) the freeway8 is unsafe: that is, 0 is in one of the intervals.\n\nCheck each car:\n\ncar1: [-31+4t, -20+4t] contains 0?\n  -31+4t <= 0 <= -20+4t\n  => 4t <= 31 -> t <= 31/4 = 7.75\n      and 4t >= 20 -> t>=5\n  So t in [5, 7.75] -> since t is integer: t=5,6,7.\n\ncar2: [45+4t,56+4t] -> all positive, so never contains 0.\n\ncar3: [9+4t,20+4t] -> all positive for t>=0, so never contains 0.\n\nTherefore, freeway8 is unsafe at t=5,6,7 (relative to t1=11, so absolute turns: 16,17,18).\n\nNow, we start at turn11 (t=0) at y=7.\n\nWe want to go to y=8 and then to y=9. The minimal moves would be to go up at turn11 to y=8 (then at turn12 go to y=9). But we must check the safety at the turns we are on freeways.\n\nPlan 1: \n  Turn11 (t=0): at y=7 -> we are safe (as freeway7 is always safe).\n  Action at turn11: U -> then at turn12 (t=1) we are at y=8.\n\nBut at turn12 (t=1): we are at freeway8? Actually, at the moment of turn12, we are at y=8. Is that safe? \n  Relative t = 1 (since t1=11, then turn12 is t=1). \n  We need to check freeway8 at t=1: \n      car1: [-31+4*1, -20+4*1] = [-27, -16] -> 0 not in this interval -> safe.\n      car2: [45+4,56+4] = [49,60] -> safe.\n      car3: [9+4,20+4] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn12 (t=1) we are safe at freeway8.\n\nThen at turn12 we can do U to go to y=9 at turn13 (t=2). At turn13 we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n  Turn11: U -> then at turn12: U.\n\nBut wait: at turn12 we are at y=8 and then we move to y=9 at turn13. At turn13 we are at y=9 so no car to check.\n\nSo total turns: H=2? Then we reach y=9 at turn13.\n\nBut let me check the moves:\n\nTurn11: start at y=7, do U -> then at the end of turn11 (so at the beginning of turn12) we are at y=8. Then at turn12 we do U -> then at the beginning of turn13 we are at y=9.\n\nNow, we must check the freeways we are on at each turn:\n\nAt turn11 (absolute turn 11): we are at y=7 -> freeway7: safe as established.\nAt turn12 (absolute turn 12): we are at y=8 -> freeway8: at t=1 (relative to t1=11) -> we computed: safe.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 2 moves.\n\nBut why then are there other freeways? The problem is that we might have to avoid freeways 1 to 6 if we go down? But we don't need to go down. We are at 7 and want to go to 9.\n\nHowever, note that we start at 7 and we can only move one step per turn. So we must go to 8 and then to 9. And we found that at turn12 (t=1) freeway8 is safe.\n\nBut what if we wait? Then we might take more moves. So 2 moves is minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway8 at t=1 (absolute turn12):\n\ncar1: [-31+4, -20+4] = [-27, -16] -> 0 is not in this interval? Correct.\n\ncar2: [45+4,56+4] = [49,60] -> no.\n\ncar3: [9+4,20+4] = [13,24] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIs there a problem at freeway7 at turn11? We already said freeway7 is safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway7: (60,25,right,36) -> at t=0: [25,60] -> 0 not in [25,60]. So safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2: two moves.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are at turn11 and we do two actions: at turn11 and turn12, and then at the end of turn12 we are at y=9? Actually, after two moves we have:\n\nAfter action at turn11: at turn12 we are at y=8.\nAfter action at turn12: at turn13 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn13. So H=2? But note: the sequence of actions is for turns starting at t1=11 and we do two actions: at 11 and 12. Then we are at y=9 at turn13. So the number of actions is 2, and we reach at the next state after the second action.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nWait: the indexing: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{11} -> then y_{t1+1} = y_{12} = 7 + a_{11} (which is U: so 8)\n  t=1: a_{t1+1}=a_{12} -> then y_{13} = 8 + a_{12} (U: 9)\n\nSo after H=2 actions, we have y_{t1 + H} = y_{13} = 9. But the problem says we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSo at which time step is the position updated? The update rule: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo after the action at time t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at time t1=11: we are at y_{11}=7.\nAfter action a_{11}: we get y_{12} = 7 + 1 = 8.\nAfter action a_{12}: we get y_{13} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = y_{11+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we require: 11 + H - 1 = 13? -> then H=3? That doesn't match.\n\nLet me read the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo we have:\n  y_{t1} = 7 (initial at turn11)\n  then we do a_{t1} (at turn11) -> y_{t1+1} = 7 + Delta\n  then ... until after H-1 actions, we get y_{t1 + (H-1)}? \n\nBut note: the action a_{t} affects the next state: so after k actions, we are at state y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe want: y_{t1 + (H-1)} = 9? \n\nBut we start at t1: then after 1 action (H-1=1) we would be at y_{t1+1}. But we start at 7 and we want to be at 9. We cannot get to 9 in one action (since we can only move by 1). \n\nAfter two actions: we are at y_{t1+2}. We want y_{t1+2}=9.\n\nBut in our plan: \n  at t1=11: y11=7\n  after a11: y12=8\n  after a12: y13=9 -> so at time t1+2=13, we are at 9.\n\nSo we have: y_{t1+2}=9. Therefore, we require H-1 = 2? Then H=3? \n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so we have actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nWe have two actions: at t1 and t1+1. So H should be 2? Then the sequence is for t=0 to 1? Then we have two actions. And we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = y_{11+2-1}=y_{12}=8? But we want 9.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me parse: \n  The sequence of actions is applied at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1 (so H actions in total).\n  The state at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,7).\n  Then after the first action (at turn t1) we are at the beginning of turn t1+1 at position (0, y_{t1+1}).\n  ... \n  Then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at the beginning of turn t1+H at position (0, y_{t1+H}).\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y=9? But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait: the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the state after the last action is y_{t1+H}. So we want y_{t1+H}=9? \n\nBut the problem says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLet me see the indexing: \n  At turn t1: state is y_{t1}=7.\n  After action a_{t1}: we get y_{t1+1}.\n  ...\n  After action a_{t1+H-1}: we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H}=9? Then the condition in the problem should be y_{t1+H}=9, but it says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there is a confusion in the problem statement. \n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThis suggests that the last action (the H-th action, which is a_{t1+H-1}) leads to y_{t1+H-1}? But that doesn't match the update rule.\n\nThe update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \n\nSo if we start at t1: we have y_{t1} = 7.\nThen we apply a_{t1}: then we get y_{t1+1} = 7 + ... \n\nSo after k actions, we are at state y_{t1+k}.\n\nTo be at y=9, we need k>=2.\n\nWe want: after H actions, we are at state y_{t1+H}=9? Then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the state at the same turn as the action? But the collision condition is checked at the turn when the state is active.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me reread the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the player update is: y_{t+1} = ... . So the position at the next turn is determined by the current action.\n\nSo the state at turn t is y_t. We are given y_{t1}. Then we choose a_{t1} to get y_{t1+1}, then a_{t1+1} to get y_{t1+2}, ... until we get y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThat would mean that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But then we are not taking an action at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take an action at turn t1+H-1 and that action brings us to 9 at turn t1+H, but the requirement is at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". So we are at (0,9) at the end of the sequence.\n\nThe minimal H should be the number of actions taken. And we start at turn t1 and take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAfter the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get the state at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H}. So to be at (0,9) at the end, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, the condition in the problem \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" must be a typo and should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut let me check the example: if we do two actions: at t1 and t1+1, then we get:\n  y_{t1+1} = 8 (after first action)\n  y_{t1+2} = 9 (after second action)\n\nSo we have y_{t1+2}=9. Then H=2, and we want y_{t1+H}=y_{t1+2}=9. So the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem means that after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 at that same turn? That doesn't match the update rule.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem means we require y_{t1+H}=9. And H is the number of actions. Then in our plan, we have H=2 and we reach y_{13}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then in the answer format we write actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nSo with H=2, we write two actions: for turn11 and turn12.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" ... until the last action.\n\nSo our answer would be:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut to be safe, we must check that at turn11 we are at freeway7 (safe) and at turn12 we are at freeway8 (safe at t=1) and then we are done.\n\nBut note: we must also check that if we do S at turn11 and then U at turn12 and then U at turn13, that would be H=3 and we reach at turn14: y14=9. That is slower.\n\nSo our plan is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8 at turn12? We computed safe. But let me double-check the relative time:\n\nAt turn11 (t=0 relative to t1=11): we are at freeway7: safe.\n\nThen we do U: so at the beginning of turn12 we are at freeway8.\n\nAt turn12 (which is absolute turn12, so relative t=1): we check freeway8: safe.\n\nThen we do U: so at the beginning of turn13 we are at freeway9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: at turn12, we are at freeway8 and we are about to move to freeway9. During turn12, we are at freeway8 and we do an action U. But the collision check happens at the turn we are on the freeway. So at turn12 we are at freeway8: we have to check the cars on freeway8 at turn12 (absolute turn12, relative t=1) -> which we did.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We never go to freeways 1-6, so we don't care.\n\nBut what if we consider that at turn11 we might do D? That would be counterproductive.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we are taking two turns (turn11 and turn12) to complete the journey. So H=2.\n\nBut then the condition is y_{t1+H} = y_{13}=9.\n\nAnd the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" -> but that would be y_{12}=9? which is not achieved until the second action. \n\nI suspect there is an off-by-one in the problem statement. To resolve, I will assume the requirement is that after the sequence of H actions, the player is at (0,9) at the next state, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nH=2, and the actions are:\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n\nBut to be cautious, let me check freeway8 at t=1 (absolute turn12) again.\n\nThe cars on freeway8 at absolute turn12 (which is t=1 relative to t1=11):\n\ncar1: [-31+4*1, -20+4*1] = [-27, -16] -> 0 not in this interval.\ncar2: [45+4,56+4] = [49,60] -> no.\ncar3: [9+4,20+4] = [13,24] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIs there a possibility that at turn12 we are hit? Only if 0 is in one of the spans at that turn. It is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", so we output the two actions.\n\nBut what if we consider that we might have to wait at 7? Then we do:\n\nTurn11: S -> then at turn12 we are still at 7.\nTurn12: U -> then at turn13 we are at 8.\nTurn13: U -> then at turn14 we are at 9.\n\nThis takes H=3, which is longer.\n\nAlternatively, if we go up at turn11 to 8, but then at turn12 we are at 8 and we must check: at turn12 (t=1) we are safe. Then we go to 9. So no need to wait.\n\nBut what if we go up at turn11 to 8, and then at turn12 we are at 8 and we do not move? Then we would be at 8 at turn13? But then we have to go to 9 at turn14. That would be H=3. Not minimal.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut note: what if at turn12 (when we are at freeway8) it was unsafe? Then we would have to wait at 7 until freeway8 is safe. But at turn12 (t=1) it is safe. And the unsafe turns for freeway8 are t=5,6,7 (relative to t1=11) which correspond to absolute turns 16,17,18. We are long done by then.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the answer format: we write the actions for the turns, and we have two turns: 11 and 12.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1. So H=2, then t=0 and t=1: \n  a_{t1+0} = a_{11} = U\n  a_{t1+1} = a_{12} = U\n\nSo the format is:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t1}\" etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut note: the minimal H is 2, and we output two actions.\n\nBut what if we can do it in one action? That is impossible because we are at 7 and we can only move to 6,7,8. We cannot jump to 9 in one action.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the other freeways? We are only moving to 8 and then to 9, so we don't go through freeways 1-6.\n\nBut what if we go up to 8 at turn11 and then to 9 at turn12? We have checked that at turn11 (on freeway7) is safe and at turn12 (on freeway8) is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 11. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Freeway 7 (current position at turn 11):**  \n  - Car: (60, 25, right, 36)  \n    - Span at turn 11: [25, 60] (since right-moving: [tail, head] = [25, 60]).  \n    - At any turn \\(T \\geq 11\\), the span is \\([25 + 36(T-11), 60 + 36(T-11)]\\).  \n    - Since 25 > 0, 0 is never in the span. Thus, freeway 7 is always safe.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe to be on freeway 7 at turn 11.\n\n- **Freeway 8 (target to move to):**  \n  - Cars:  \n    - (-20, -31, right, 4) → span at turn 11: [-31, -20]  \n    - (56, 45, right, 4) → span at turn 11: [45, 56]  \n    - (20, 9, right, 4) → span at turn 11: [9, 20]  \n  - Spans at turn \\(T = 11 + t\\):  \n    - Car 1: \\([-31 + 4t, -20 + 4t]\\)  \n    - Car 2: \\([45 + 4t, 56 + 4t]\\) (always > 0, safe)  \n    - Car 3: \\([9 + 4t, 20 + 4t]\\) (always > 0, safe)  \n  - Collision if 0 in span of Car 1:  \n    \\[\n    -31 + 4t \\leq 0 \\leq -20 + 4t \\implies 5 \\leq t \\leq 7.75 \\implies t = 5, 6, 7\n    \\]\n    - Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18 (since \\(t = T - 11\\)).  \n  - **At turn 12 (\\(t = 1\\)):**  \n    - Car 1: \\([-31 + 4(1), -20 + 4(1)] = [-27, -16]\\) → 0 not in span → safe.  \n    - Cars 2 and 3: positive spans → safe.  \n  - **Conclusion:** Safe to be on freeway 8 at turn 12.\n\n### Plan:\n- **Turn 11 (current turn):**  \n  - Player is at (0, 7). Action \\(a_{11} = U\\) (move up).  \n  - Next state: \\(y_{12} = 7 + 1 = 8\\).  \n  - Collision check at turn 11 (freeway 7): safe (as analyzed).  \n- **Turn 12:**  \n  - Player is at (0, 8). Action \\(a_{12} = U\\) (move up).  \n  - Next state: \\(y_{13} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).  \n  - Collision check at turn 12 (freeway 8): safe (as analyzed).  \n- **Turn 13:**  \n  - Player reaches (0, 9) (goal). No cars at y = 9, so safe.  \n\n### Minimal Turns:\n- The sequence uses 2 actions (turns 11 and 12) to reach (0, 9) at turn 13.  \n- \\(H = 2\\) is minimal because moving from y = 7 to y = 9 requires at least two up moves (each action changes y by at most 1).  \n\n### Output:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 11 and 12 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 12. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is at y=8, and needs to get to y=9, which is the top, I think y=9 might be safe because there are no freeways above it; the cars are only on y=1 to 8. The collision only happens if on a freeway y=1 to 8 and the car spans include x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, I assume. The grid is 2D, but the player only moves vertically, I think? No, let me read.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t depends on action U, D, S. So the player only moves vertically, and x is fixed at 0? The position is (0, y_t), so yes, x=0 always. And the cars are on horizontal freeways at each y level from 1 to 8.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you take an action to go to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so collision is checked based on y_T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so collision is based on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, so collision depends on cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf you stay or move, at the moment of turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,8) at t=12. y=8 is a freeway, so we need to check for cars on y=8 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, which might be the end, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut y=9 is not listed in freeways, so probably safe.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns H to reach y=9 from y=8. Since y=8 to y=9 is adjacent, in one move up, you can go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nSpecifically, at each turn, when you are on a freeway y=1 to 8, you must not have a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, since you start at y=8, which is a freeway, we need to check if at t=12, on y=8, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly, if you move up to y=9 at the next turn, you might not be on freeway anymore.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nPossible actions: U (up, y increases), D (down, y decreases), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, inclusive, I think, from the vertical axis y=0,1,...,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nIn the game dynamics, collision only for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo positions y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,8), which is on freeway y=8.\n\nWe need to get to (0,9), which is safe.\n\nFrom y=8, to go to y=9, you need to take action U at some turn.\n\nBut if you take U at turn t, then at turn t, you are still on y_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t, it's based on y_t.\n\nSo to reach y=9, you need to be at some turn where y_t =8, and you take U, so at turn t, you are on y=8, then at turn t+1, you are on y=9.\n\nAnd since at turn t+1, you are on y=9, no collision check needed.\n\nBut at turn t, when you are on y=8, you need no collision, meaning no car on y=8 with 0 in span at time t.\n\nSimilarly, during the path, if you move to other y levels, you need to avoid collisions there.\n\nBut since we start at y=8 and want to go to y=9, the minimal should be to go directly up, if possible.\n\nBut we need to check if at t=12, on y=8, it is safe to be there, or if there is a car.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=12.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-16,-27,right,4) and (48,37,right,4)\n\nDirection: right means right-moving, so from the update, right-moving car: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for T > t_1.\n\nAt turn t_1, the span is given.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t_1=12:\n\nFirst car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, at time t_1, span is [τ, h]? Let's see the car update.\n\nIt says: for car on freeway i, at turn t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut for right-moving, span(t_1) is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head in the direction.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ].\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1:\n\nFirst car: h=-16, τ=-27, d=right, s=4\n\nSince d=right, at t_1=12, span is [τ, h] = [-27, -16]\n\nBecause for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48,37,right,4), h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=4, so span(t_1) = [37,48]\n\nNow, for freeway 2: (48,71,left,24)\n\nd=left, so for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48,71]\n\nh=48, τ=71, so [48,71]\n\nFreeway 3: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nd=right, s=36, h=-48, τ=-83, so span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nd=right, s=12, h=-48, τ=-59, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? (-48,-59,right,12) identical to freeway 4? Probably different freeways, but same car state? Or typo?\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,12) same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6: also (-48,-59,right,12) same.\n\nThat seems odd, but possible, I guess multiple freeways can have similar cars.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-83,right,36) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8: (-16,-27,right,4), (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-16,-27,right,4) same as freeway 1 first car? But different freeway.\n\nh=-16, τ=-27, d=right, s=4, span [ -27, -16 ]\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,4) h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=4, span [49,60]\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=4, span [13,24]\n\nNow, player is at y=8 at t=12.\n\nWe need to check if at t=12, on freeway y=8, is x=0 covered by any car?\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\n- [ -27, -16 ] : does 0 in this? -27 to -16, all negative, 0 not in [-27,-16], since -16 < 0? -27 <= x <= -16? x from -27 to -16 inclusive, all negative, so 0 not in this interval.\n\nSimilarly, [49,60]: 49 to 60, all positive, greater than 0, so 0 not in.\n\n[13,24]: 13 to 24, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=12, on y=8, no car covers x=0. So it's safe to be there.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, the player can simply move up at turn t=12.\n\nAction: at turn t=12, take U.\n\nThen y_{13} = y_{12} +1 = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn t=12, player is on y=8, which is safe as we saw.\n\nThen after action, at turn t=13, player is on y=9, which has no freeway, so no collision.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn t=13.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =13? Let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1: action a_{t_1}\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nStart at time t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at time t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at t_1, after H turns, we are at time t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we want that position to be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, from y=8 to y=9, we can do it in one action: at turn t_1, take U, so H=1.\n\nThen at time t_1 +1, y=9.\n\nAnd at turn t_1, we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nSo minimal H=1.\n\nBut is there any issue? The player might need to move immediately or something.\n\nPerhaps at other turns, but since we can do it now, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision.\n\nAt turn t=12, y=8, cars on freeway 8: spans [ -27,-16], [49,60], [13,24], none contain 0, so safe.\n\nAction U at t=12, then at t=13, y=9, safe.\n\nSo only one action needed.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we can do it in one turn.\n\nBut let me check if y=9 is indeed safe. Since no freeway at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nIn this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nMaybe at the exact turn, when moving, but no, as per note.\n\nAnother thing: the car spans might move, but at turn t=12, we only care about that instant.\n\nFor example, at t=12, for freeway 8, no car at x=0.\n\nIf we stay or move, at t=12, we are on y=8.\n\nBut we move up.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider future positions if we delay, but since we can go immediately, no need.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason not to go immediately.\n\nFor example, if at t=12, it was unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nPerhaps for other y levels, but we don't need to go to other y.\n\nWe are at y=8, want to go to y=9, adjacent, and safe to move.\n\nSo H=1, action U at t=12.\n\nBut the sequence should be for t from 0 to H-1, so one action: a_{t_1}\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo for t_1=12, action U.\n\nThen done.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states, especially for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nFirst: (-16,-27,right,4) → since right, span at t_1 [τ,h] = [-27,-16], min -27, max -16, so x from -27 to -16, 0 not in.\n\nSecond: (60,49,right,4) → h=60, τ=49, right, so [τ,h] = [49,60], 49 to 60, 0 not in.\n\nThird: (24,13,right,4) → h=24, τ=13, [13,24], 13 to 24, 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait or something, but no reason.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and H=1 should be possible.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, but since we only care about y=8 at t=12, and we are not on other y, so irrelevant.\n\nUnless we move to other y, but we don't need to.\n\nSo I think H=1 with action U.\n\nBut perhaps the player must be at (0,9) for the turn, meaning at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=13, y=9.\n\nt_1=12, after one action, at time t=13, position y=9.\n\nSo we reached at turn t=13.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nStart at t_1, after 0 actions, at t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nIn this case, with H=1, y_{13} =9.\n\nAnd during the process, at t=12, on y=8, safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if for freeway 8, at t=12, is there any car that might cover x=0 later, but no, collision is only at the turn you are on that freeway.\n\nSo only t=12 matters for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we were to stay, we need to check future, but we don't stay.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut perhaps the answer should be the sequence.\n\nSo for H=1, only one action: at turn t_1=12, action U.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt_1=12, so turn t_1: a_{12}\n\nThen done.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=1.\n\nBut perhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nMaybe for some reason it's not safe, but I think it is.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 8, the third car (24,13,right,4), h=24, τ=13, for right-moving, head is at h=24, tail at τ=13? But if right-moving, and span [13,24], so from x=13 to x=24, with head at 24, tail at 13, meaning the car extends from 13 to 24, so at x=0, not covered.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps the direction: right-moving means moving to the right, so at time T, position increases.\n\nBut for collision, we care about the span at time T.\n\nAt t=12, all clear.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if there is a trick.\n\nThe player is at (0,8), and freeway 8 has cars, but none at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nSo minimal H=1 with action U.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 and move up, which we are doing.\n\nMaybe we can go to y=9 directly, but no, we have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=12, it is safe, but if we take U, at t=13 we are at y=9, but during the move, is there a collision? No, because at turn t=12, we are on y=8, and collision checked only at the turn.\n\nThe note confirms that when you move, at turn T, you are on the old y, not the new one.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nPerhaps for other y, but we don't go there.\n\nSo I believe H=1, action U at t=12.\n\nBut let me check the car states for completeness.\n\nFreeway 1: cars at [ -27,-16] and [37,48], both away from 0.\n\nFreeway 2: left-moving, [48,71], 48 to 71, away.\n\nFreeway 3: [ -83,-48], all negative.\n\nFreeway 4: [ -59,-48], negative.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 3.\n\nFreeway 8: as above.\n\nAll freeways have no car at x=0 at t=12.\n\nSo definitely safe to be at any y, but we are at y=8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action U.\n\nSo the sequence is just one action.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 12: U }\n\nBut in the format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSince H=1, only one turn in the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0, which is t_1.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps write it as:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me see if H can be 0, but no, at t_1, we are at y=8, not 9, so we need at least one action to move to y=9.\n\nSo H min=1.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The goal is to move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway, it is safe with no collision risk.\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 12\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on the current freeway at that turn.\n- For freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(12\\), the cars are:\n  - \\((-16, -27, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span at \\(T=12\\) is \\([-27, -16]\\) (right-moving, so \\([\\tau, h] = [-27, -16]\\)). Since \\(-27 \\leq x \\leq -16\\) and \\(0 \\notin [-27, -16]\\), no collision.\n  - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span at \\(T=12\\) is \\([49, 60]\\) (right-moving, \\([\\tau, h] = [49, 60]\\)). Since \\(49 \\leq x \\leq 60\\) and \\(0 \\notin [49, 60]\\), no collision.\n  - \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 4)\\): Span at \\(T=12\\) is \\([13, 24]\\) (right-moving, \\([\\tau, h] = [13, 24]\\)). Since \\(13 \\leq x \\leq 24\\) and \\(0 \\notin [13, 24]\\), no collision.\n- Thus, at turn \\(12\\), \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) requires one action: \\(a_{12} = U\\) (up). This changes the position to \\(y_{13} = 8 + 1 = 9\\) at turn \\(13\\).\n- At turn \\(12\\), during the action, the player is on \\(y = 8\\), which is safe. At turn \\(13\\), the player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no freeway and is safe.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\):\n- \\(H = 1\\) is sufficient to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H = 13\\).\n- No fewer turns are possible, as the player starts at \\(y = 8 \\neq 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Only one action is needed: \\(a_{t_1} = a_{12} = U\\).\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 12: U }",
