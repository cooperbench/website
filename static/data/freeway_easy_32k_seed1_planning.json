The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe movement is only vertical (y-direction). The player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn, the car on freeway k has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at turn T.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} (which is different from y_T) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on row y_T and only moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on row y_T and is at risk only from cars on that row. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (which is 0). For each freeway (k from 1 to 8) we have one or more cars. Each car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction: \n- For left-moving cars: the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the update rule says:\n  - Left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 5: \n  (-48, -59, right, 6) -> for right-moving, the car is represented as (head, tail) but the update uses [τ, h] and then moves to [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. However, the input gives (h, τ) for right? Let's see the example: \n  The car (-48, -59, right, 6): \n    If we interpret the given numbers as (head, tail), then for a right-moving car, the head is at -48 and tail at -59? But that would mean the car is from -59 to -48? But then the update would be: [τ, h] = [-59, -48] -> at time t1 (0) we have the car from -59 to -48? Then at time T, it moves to [-59 + 6*T, -48 + 6*T].\n\nSimilarly, the next car on freeway 5: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> [-23, -12] at t1=0, then at T: [-23+6T, -12+6T].\nAnd (24, 13, right, 6) -> [13,24] at t1=0? But that would be a car from 13 to 24? But then at T: [13+6T, 24+6T]. However, note that the input says (24,13) which might be head=24 and tail=13? Then for a right-moving car, the head is at 24 and tail at 13? Then the car is from 13 to 24? Then at T, it becomes [13+6T, 24+6T].\n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving says: [τ, h] → [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]. So the initial span at t1 is [τ, h]. Therefore, the car on freeway 5: (24,13,right,6) should be interpreted as h=24 and τ=13? Then the initial span is [13,24]. Then at time T, it becomes [13+6T, 24+6T].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars: \n  Freeway 7: (48,71,left,24) -> for left-moving, the update rule uses [h, τ] and becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. The input is (head, tail) = (48,71). But in the update, the initial span is [h, τ] = [48,71]? Then at time T, it becomes [48-24*T, 71-24*T].\n\nBut note: a car from 48 to 71? That's a long car? Actually, 71>48, so if we take [48,71] that's a segment of length 23? Then at time T, it moves left.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\"\n\nWe are at turn t1=0. We need to compute for each freeway and each car the positions at each future turn.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn0. We want to get to (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nSince we can only move vertically, and we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, we must move up at least 9 times. But we can also move down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nLet me denote the state as (turn, y). We start at (0,0) and we want to reach y=9 at some turn H-1 (since the sequence is from t=0 to H-1).\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when any car on that freeway k has its span covering 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: At turn T, the player is at y_T. If y_T is 0 or 9, there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nTherefore, we can only collide when we are at y=k (1<=k<=8) at a turn T.\n\nWe must compute the positions of the cars for each freeway at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> right-moving, so initial span: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? \nBut the input says (head, tail) = (-48, -95). For right-moving, the update rule uses [τ, h] and the head is the front? So if the car is moving right, the head should be the rightmost? Then the input (head, tail) = (-48, -95) would imply that the head is at -48 and the tail at -95? Then the car is from -95 to -48? Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [-95, -48]. Then at turn T, the car is at [-95 + 48*T, -48 + 48*T].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway1: [-95, -48] at T=0, then [-95+48T, -48+48T].\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> initial span: [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? Then at T: [-59+4T, -48+4T].\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3: [-59, -48] at T=0, then [-59+4T, -48+4T].\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n  Car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> initial: [-59, -48] -> at T: [-59+6T, -48+6T]\n  Car2: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> initial: [-23, -12] -> at T: [-23+6T, -12+6T]\n  Car3: (24, 13, right, 6) -> initial: [13,24] -> at T: [13+6T,24+6T]\n\nBut wait, the input for car3 is (24,13) so head=24, tail=13? Then [13,24] at T=0.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars:\n  (48, 37, right, 4) -> head=48, tail=37? Then initial: [37,48] -> at T: [37+4T, 48+4T]\n  (0, -11, right, 4) -> head=0, tail=-11? Then initial: [-11,0] -> at T: [-11+4T, 0+4T]\n\nFreeway 7: (48,71,left,24) -> left-moving: initial span [h, τ] = [48,71]? Then at T: [48-24T, 71-24T]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7: [48,71] at T=0, then [48-24T,71-24T]\n\nNow, we need to know at which turns the player would be unsafe on a freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving. Since we want minimal H, we try to go as fast as possible (i.e., always up) but we might need to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a car.\n\nHowever, note that we start at y=0 (safe) and we want to end at y=9 (safe). The dangerous rows are 1 to 8.\n\nWe can consider a BFS in the state space (turn, y). But note that the car positions are deterministic and periodic? Actually, the car positions are linear in time.\n\nBut the state space in time might be large? However, since the speeds are high and the cars move fast, they will eventually leave the 0 position? But we are only concerned when the car spans cover 0 at a specific turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k the time intervals (if any) when the car covers 0.\n\nThen, for a given freeway k, the set of turns T at which the freeway k is unsafe is the union of the intervals (for each car on k) when that car covers 0.\n\nThen, the player must not be at freeway k at a turn T that is in the unsafe set for k.\n\nSo let's compute the unsafe time sets for each freeway.\n\nWe compute for each car the time T (at turn T, relative to t1=0) at which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nWe are only interested in T>=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: span at T: [-95+48T, -48+48T]\nWe need 0 in [A,B] = [-95+48T, -48+48T]\nSo: -95+48T <= 0 <= -48+48T\n=> 48T <= 48 => T <= 1\n   and 48T >= 95? -> T>= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> no integer T satisfies both? \n\nLet me solve:\nLower bound: -95+48T <= 0  => 48T <= 95 -> T <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> so T<=1 (since T integer) -> T=0,1\nUpper bound: 0 <= -48+48T  => 48T >=48 -> T>=1.\n\nSo for T=1: \n  Lower: -95+48 = -47 <=0\n  Upper: -48+48=0 <=0 -> so 0 is included at T=1? \nAt T=1: the car is at [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0]. So 0 is the upper bound -> included.\n\nBut T=0: \n  [-95, -48] -> 0 is not in [-95,-48] (since -48<0? actually -48 is negative and 0 is positive) -> no.\n\nSo only T=1 is unsafe for freeway1.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> unsafe only at T=1.\n\nFreeway3: car: [-59+4T, -48+4T]\nWe need: -59+4T <= 0 <= -48+4T\n=> 4T <= 48? -> T<=12\n   and 4T>=59? -> T>=59/4=14.75 -> no integer T in between? \nCheck: \n  Lower: -59+4T<=0 -> T<=59/4=14.75 -> so T<=14\n  Upper: 0<=-48+4T -> 4T>=48 -> T>=12.\n\nSo T from 12 to 14 inclusive? \nT=12: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? (at the upper bound) -> yes.\nT=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> yes.\nT=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8] -> 0 in? yes.\n\nSo freeway3 unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3 -> unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway5: three cars.\n\nCar1: [-59+6T, -48+6T]\n  Conditions: -59+6T <=0<=-48+6T\n  => 6T<=48 -> T<=8\n     6T>=59 -> T>=59/6≈9.83 -> no integer T.\n\nCar2: [-23+6T, -12+6T]\n  Conditions: -23+6T<=0<=-12+6T\n  => 6T<=12 -> T<=2\n      6T>=23 -> T>=23/6≈3.83 -> no integer T.\n\nCar3: [13+6T,24+6T]\n  Conditions: 13+6T<=0<=24+6T -> but 13+6T is always positive for T>=0? so 0 is not in this interval.\n\nSo freeway5 is safe at all times? \n\nWait, let me double-check car1: \n  We require: -59+6T <= 0 <= -48+6T\n  For T=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? yes! But wait, T=9: \n    -59+54 = -5, -48+54=6 -> so [ -5,6] includes 0.\n\nI made a mistake: \n  The condition is: \n    A = -59+6T <= 0 and 0 <= -48+6T? \n  Actually, we need both: \n    -59+6T <= 0   -> T <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> so T<=9\n    and -48+6T >=0 -> T>=8.\n\nSo T from 8 to 9 inclusive? \nT=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? (at the upper bound) -> yes.\nT=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 in, yes.\n\nSo car1 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nCar2: \n  -23+6T<=0 -> 6T<=23 -> T<=3.83 -> T<=3\n  0<=-12+6T -> 6T>=12 -> T>=2.\n  So T=2,3:\n    T=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes (at upper bound).\n    T=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> 0 in, yes.\n\nCar3: no.\n\nTherefore, freeway5 is unsafe at:\n  from car1: T=8,9\n  from car2: T=2,3\n  so union: T=2,3,8,9.\n\nFreeway6: two cars.\n\nCar1: [37+4T, 48+4T] -> for T>=0, this is at least 37, so 0 is never in.\n\nCar2: [-11+4T, 0+4T] = [-11+4T, 4T]\n  Conditions: -11+4T <=0<=4T\n  => 4T<=11? -> T<=2.75 -> T<=2\n        and 4T>=0 -> always true for T>=0, and the lower bound condition: -11+4T<=0 -> T<=11/4=2.75 -> so T=0,1,2?\n  Check:\n    T=0: [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n    T=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4] -> 0 in, yes.\n    T=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8] -> 0 in, yes.\n    T=3: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway6 unsafe at T=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway7: left-moving car: [48-24T, 71-24T]\n  Conditions: 48-24T <=0<=71-24T\n  => 48-24T<=0 -> 24T>=48 -> T>=2\n      71-24T>=0 -> 24T<=71 -> T<=71/24≈2.958 -> so T=2? \n  Check T=2: [48-48,71-48] = [0,23] -> 0 included? yes.\n  T=3: [48-72,71-72] = [-24,-1] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSummary of unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: {1}\nFreeway2: {1}\nFreeway3: {12,13,14}\nFreeway4: {12,13,14}\nFreeway5: {2,3,8,9}\nFreeway6: {0,1,2}\nFreeway7: {2}\nFreeway8: {2}\n\nNote: At a given freeway k, if the player is at k at an unsafe turn T, then collision.\n\nWe are at turn0: the player is at y0=0 (safe). We want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption 1: Go straight up without stopping.\n\nTurn0: at y0=0 -> safe (since y0=0 is safe).\nThen we choose an action for turn0: let's say U -> then at turn1: y1=1.\n\nBut at turn1, if we are at freeway1, and freeway1 is unsafe at turn1 -> so we collide.\n\nSo we cannot go from y0=0 to y1=1 at turn0? \n\nWait: at turn0, the player is at y0=0 (safe). Then we choose an action for turn0: if we choose U, then at the next state (turn1) the player is at y1=1. But at turn1, the player is on freeway1, and turn1 is unsafe for freeway1 -> so we collide at turn1.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway1 at turn1.\n\nWe might choose to stay at y0=0 for a few turns? or even go down? but we are at y0=0, we cannot go down (since y>=0 and if we try to go down we stay at 0).\n\nSo at turn0: we can choose S (stay) or U (up). But if we choose U, we go to y1=1 at turn1 and then collide. So we must choose S at turn0? Then at turn1 we are still at y0=0.\n\nBut then at turn1: we are still at y=0 (safe). Then we choose an action for turn1: if we choose U, then at turn2 we are at y=1. But at turn2, freeway1 is safe? because unsafe only at turn1? yes. So at turn2, freeway1 is safe? \n\nBut wait: freeway1 has unsafe only at turn1. So at turn2, freeway1 is safe? \n\nBut let me check freeway1 car: at turn2: [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n  Turn0: S -> then at turn1: still at y=0.\n  Turn1: U -> then at turn2: y=1 (freeway1) and turn2 is safe for freeway1.\n\nThen we can continue? \n\nBut we also have to check the other freeways as we go up.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we don't want to stay unnecessarily.\n\nWe are at:\n  Turn0: y=0 -> safe\n  Turn1: y=0 -> safe (because we stayed)\n  Turn2: y=1 -> safe (since freeway1 unsafe only at turn1)\n\nThen we can go to y=2 at turn3? \n  At turn3: we are at freeway2? because y=2? \n  Freeway2 unsafe at turn1? turn3 is safe? \n  Freeway2 car at turn3: [-95+48*3, -48+48*3] = [-95+144, -48+144] = [49,96] -> safe.\n\nThen turn3: we go to y=3? \n  Then at turn4: we are at freeway3? \n  Freeway3 unsafe at T=12,13,14 -> turn4 is safe.\n\nBut we have to go through freeway4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe are going to encounter:\n\nAt turn t, the player is at row y_t. We plan:\n\nWe want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any obstacle: 9 moves up (so H=9 turns: from turn0 to turn8, then at turn9 we are at y=9? \nBut note: \n  turn0: start at y0=0\n  turn0: action U -> then at turn1: y1=1\n  turn1: U -> turn2: y2=2\n  ...\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y9=9.\n\nBut we saw that at turn1 we would be at freeway1 and it's unsafe -> so we cannot do that.\n\nWe delayed by one turn: \n  turn0: S -> y0=0\n  turn1: U -> y1=1 (at turn1: we are at freeway1? no: at turn1, we are at y1=1. But wait: \n      At the start of turn0: y0=0.\n      We do action at turn0: S -> so at the end of turn0 (which is start of turn1) we are still at 0? \n      Then at turn1, we choose U -> then at the end of turn1 (start of turn2) we are at 1.\n\nSo at turn1 (the entire turn) we are at y=0? and at turn2 we are at y=1.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, we are at y_T. So at turn1, we are at y=0 -> safe. At turn2, we are at y=1 -> and we check freeway1 at turn2: safe.\n\nSo then:\n  Turn2: we are at y=1 -> then we can do U at turn2: then at turn3 we are at y=2.\n  Turn3: at y=2 -> then we do U: at turn4: y=3.\n  Turn4: at y=3 -> then U: at turn5: y=4.\n  Turn5: at y=4 -> then U: at turn6: y=5.\n  Turn6: at y=5 -> then U: at turn7: y=6.\n  Turn7: at y=6 -> then U: at turn8: y=7.\n  Turn8: at y=7 -> then U: at turn9: y=8.\n  Turn9: at y=8 -> then U: at turn10: y=9.\n\nBut now we have to check at each step:\n\n  Turn0: y0=0 -> safe.\n  Turn1: y1=0 (because we did S at turn0) -> safe.\n  Turn2: y2=1 -> freeway1: unsafe at turn1 -> but turn2 is safe? (we computed: freeway1 unsafe only at turn1) -> safe.\n  Turn3: y3=2 -> freeway2: unsafe only at turn1 -> safe.\n  Turn4: y4=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at T=12,13,14 -> safe (turn4 is 4, not 12-14).\n  Turn5: y5=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3 -> safe.\n  Turn6: y6=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at T=2,3,8,9 -> turn6 is safe (6 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n  Turn7: y7=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at T=0,1,2 -> turn7 is safe.\n  Turn8: y8=7 -> freeway7: unsafe at T=2 -> safe (turn8 !=2).\n  Turn9: y9=8 -> freeway8: unsafe at T=2 -> safe (turn9 !=2).\n  Turn10: y10=9 -> safe.\n\nSo we reach at turn10? But is there a faster way?\n\nWe started at turn0 and we have 10 actions: \n  t0: S\n  t1: U\n  t2: U\n  t3: U\n  t4: U\n  t5: U\n  t6: U\n  t7: U\n  t8: U\n  t9: U\n\nThen at the end of turn9 we are at y=9? \nWait: \n  After the action at turn9, we update to turn10: so at the start of turn10 we are at y=9? \nBut the sequence is from t0 to t9 (10 actions) and we are at y9 at turn10? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the end of the last action. \n\nIn the sequence: \n  After action at turn0: we are at turn1 (state at the start of turn1) at y=0.\n  After action at turn1: we are at turn2 at y=1.\n  ...\n  After action at turn9: we are at turn10 at y=9.\n\nSo we have H=10 turns? \n\nBut we want minimal H. Is there a way to do it in 9? \n\nThe minimal without obstacles is 9: but we cannot do that because we must avoid freeway1 at turn1.\n\nWe could try to go up to freeway6 at a safe time? \n\nNote that freeway6 is unsafe at turns 0,1,2. So we must avoid being at freeway6 at turns 0,1,2.\n\nIn our current plan, we are at freeway6 at turn7? which is safe.\n\nBut can we get to y=9 faster? \n\nWe spent one extra turn at y=0. If we can avoid that, then we save one turn.\n\nHow? We cannot go to y=1 at turn1 because it's unsafe. But what if we go to y=1 at a different turn? \n\nWe have to go through y=1 at some turn. The unsafe turn for y=1 is only turn1. So if we go to y=1 at any turn other than 1, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 (y=2) unsafe only at turn1? but freeway2 is the same as freeway1: unsafe at turn1? \n\nBut wait: we computed freeway2 unsafe at turn1? yes. So we must avoid being at y=2 at turn1? no: we are at y=2 at a turn T, and if T==1 then unsafe? But we won't be at y=2 at turn1 because we start at y0=0 and at turn1 we can only be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nSo the constraint for freeway2: we must avoid being at y=2 at turn1? but that's impossible? because we cannot get to y=2 at turn1. \n\nActually, at turn1, we can be at y=0 or y=1. So the constraint for freeway2: we must avoid being at y=2 at any unsafe turn for freeway2. The unsafe turns for freeway2 are {1}. But we will never be at y=2 at turn1 (since we start at 0 and at most one up per turn). So freeway2 is always safe? \n\nBut wait: we computed that freeway2 is unsafe at turn1. However, if the player is at freeway2 at turn1, that would be bad. But we cannot be at freeway2 at turn1. So we don't have to worry about freeway2 at turn1? \n\nTherefore, we only have to worry about freeway2 at the turn we are actually at y=2. And that turn cannot be turn1. So it's safe? \n\nSimilarly, freeway1: unsafe at turn1. We are forced to be at freeway1 at some turn? and we must avoid turn1. So we can be at freeway1 at any turn except 1.\n\nNow, how to get to y=1 at a turn other than 1? \n\nWe started at turn0: y0=0.\n\nIf we do nothing (S) at turn0: then at turn1 we are still at 0. Then at turn1 we can go up to 1, so at turn2 we are at 1. That's what we did.\n\nBut what if we do something else? We cannot go down at turn0 because we are at 0. So we must stay.\n\nSo we have to stay at least one extra turn at 0? \n\nBut wait: what if we go up at turn0 to y1=1 at turn1? Then we are at freeway1 at turn1 -> unsafe. So we must avoid that.\n\nSo we have to wait at 0 until we can go to 1 at a safe time? and the next safe time for freeway1 is turn2? \n\nBut we computed that freeway1 is safe at turn2? \n\nSo we must delay one turn.\n\nBut what about going to y=1 at turn3? That would be even later. So the minimal is to go at turn2.\n\nSo we have to have two moves: turn0: S, then turn1: U -> then at turn2 we are at 1.\n\nThen we can go up without stopping? \n\nBut we have freeway5 at y=5 which is unsafe at turns 2,3,8,9. \n\nIn our plan, we are at y=5 at turn6 (because: \n  turn2: y=1\n  turn3: y=2\n  turn4: y=3\n  turn5: y=4\n  turn6: y=5 -> and turn6 is safe? because unsafe turns for freeway5 are 2,3,8,9 -> 6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at y=6: we are at turn7 -> safe (since unsafe at 0,1,2).\n\nBut what about freeway7 and 8? at y=7 and 8: we are at turn8 and 9 -> and unsafe at turn2? so safe.\n\nSo the plan we have takes 10 turns.\n\nBut can we avoid the initial wait? \n\nWhat if we try to go up later? But that would take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, can we go up to y=1 at turn2, then go faster? but we are already going as fast as possible: one up per turn.\n\nBut note: we have to go from 0 to 9: 9 moves up. We have to have at least 9 moves up. And we have one extra stay at the beginning. So total 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to have 9 actions? \n\nWe need 9 up moves without any extra. But we cannot go up at turn0 because then we are at y=1 at turn1 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must have at least one non-up move? \n\nBut we have to do 9 up moves and at least one non-up move? then 10 moves.\n\nUnless we can do a down move? but down moves are counterproductive.\n\nBut maybe we can avoid the initial wait by doing a detour? \n\nFor example: \n  turn0: U -> to y1=1 at turn1 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nOr: \n  turn0: S -> then we are at 0 at turn1.\n  turn1: we can go up to 1 at turn2 -> safe? yes.\n\nBut that's 10 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to 1 at turn2 by a different path? but we are at 0 at turn0 and turn1, so we must go up at turn1 to be at 1 at turn2.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the initial stay.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up twice in a row at the beginning? we can't because the first up at turn0 leads to collision at turn1.\n\nSo we must have a stay at turn0.\n\nBut let me check: is there a constraint at higher freeways that might force us to wait? \n\nFor example, freeway5 is unsafe at turn8 and 9. \n\nIn our plan, we are at freeway5 (y=5) at turn6 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we are delayed? we are not.\n\nAlternatively, we could go faster? but we are going as fast as possible: after the initial stay, we go up every turn.\n\nBut what if we do two ups in a row? we are already doing that after the first stay.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let me try to see if we can do 9 moves: 8 up and one down? that would be 9 moves but we end at 8? not 9.\n\nOr 9 up moves: but we cannot do the first up at turn0 because of collision.\n\nSo we must have at least 10 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we do:\n\n  turn0: U -> then at turn1: y1=1 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we have to do:\n\n  turn0: S\n  turn1: U -> at turn2: y=1\n  then we do 8 ups: \n      turn2: U -> turn3: y=2\n      turn3: U -> turn4: y=3\n      ...\n      turn9: U -> turn10: y=9\n\nTotal 10 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at y=9 at turn10. The last action is at turn9.\n\nSo the sequence is from turn0 to turn9 (10 actions).\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and at the end we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at t1=0. So the actions are for t=0,1,...,H-1. And after the last action (at t=H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nSo we have:\n\n  After action0 (at t0): we are at turn1 -> y=0 (if we did S) or y=1 (if we did U) but we did S -> y=0.\n  After action1 (at t1): we did U -> then at turn2: y=1.\n  ...\n  After action9 (at t9): we did U -> then at turn10: y=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWhat if we skip some rows? we cannot, we have to go through every integer.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid freeway1 at turn1 by going to y=1 at a later turn? but that would require more moves.\n\nOr we could go to y=1 at turn3? then we have to wait two turns at 0: \n  turn0: S -> turn1: S -> turn2: U -> turn3: y=1 -> then we need 8 more ups -> total 10 actions? but then we end at turn11? so worse.\n\nBut we found a way to go to y=1 at turn2, which is safe.\n\nBut we have to check freeway5: we are at y=5 at turn6 (safe). But what if we are forced to wait at freeway5? \n\nFreeway5 is unsafe at turns 2,3,8,9. We are at freeway5 at turn6 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we go faster? we can't because we are going one up per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up two times in a row? we are already.\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious at freeway5: if we are at freeway5 at turn8 or 9, we collide. \n\nBut we are at turn6: safe.\n\nNow, what about freeway6: unsafe at turns0,1,2 -> we are at turn7: safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go up without the initial stay? we can't.\n\nAnother idea: go down? but we start at 0, we cannot go below 0.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5: we are at y=5 at turn6. \n\nThe unsafe turns for freeway5: 2,3,8,9 -> 6 is safe.\n\nBut what if we are delayed? we are not.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn0: S\nTurn1: U\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\n\nBut let me verify the y at each turn:\n\nAt turn0 (before any action): we are at (0,0). Then we do:\n  Action at turn0: S -> then at the start of turn1: we are at (0,0).\n  Action at turn1: U -> then at the start of turn2: we are at (0,1).\n  Action at turn2: U -> then at the start of turn3: (0,2)\n  Action at turn3: U -> turn4: (0,3)\n  Action at turn4: U -> turn5: (0,4)\n  Action at turn5: U -> turn6: (0,5)\n  Action at turn6: U -> turn7: (0,6)\n  Action at turn7: U -> turn8: (0,7)\n  Action at turn8: U -> turn9: (0,8)\n  Action at turn9: U -> turn10: (0,9)\n\nNow, we must check at each turn T (the entire turn) we are at y_T:\n\n  Turn0: y0=0 -> safe.\n  Turn1: y1=0 -> safe (because we did not move at turn0? no: at turn0 we did S, so at turn1 we are still at 0? \n      But the state at the start of turn1 is 0, and during turn1 we are at 0? and then we do U at turn1 -> but the collision is checked at the turn T: meaning the entire turn we are at that y.\n\n  How is the turn defined? The problem says: \n      \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\"\n\n  And the player update: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n  So at the beginning of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then the action a_t is taken, and then the player moves to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\n  But when is the player considered to be at y_t for the collision check? The problem states: \n      \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\n  So during turn T, the player is at y_T.\n\n  Therefore, at turn0: we are at y0=0 -> safe.\n        turn1: we are at y1=0 (because at the start of turn1 we are at 0, and we haven't moved during turn1 until the action? but the action is taken at turn1 and the effect is at the end of turn1) -> so during turn1, we are at 0 -> safe.\n        turn2: we are at y2=1 -> freeway1: check if unsafe at turn2? we computed that freeway1 is unsafe only at turn1 -> safe.\n        turn3: y3=2 -> freeway2: unsafe only at turn1 -> safe.\n        turn4: y4=3 -> freeway3: unsafe at 12,13,14 -> safe.\n        turn5: y5=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n        turn6: y6=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at 2,3,8,9 -> turn6 is safe.\n        turn7: y7=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe (turn7 is 7).\n        turn8: y8=7 -> freeway7: unsafe at 2 -> safe.\n        turn9: y9=8 -> freeway8: unsafe at 2 -> safe.\n        turn10: y10=9 -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at every turn.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last action. We are at (0,9) at the start of turn10? But the problem doesn't specify when exactly, but the condition is that at the end of the sequence (after the last action) we are at (0,9). \n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns 0 to 9, and at the end of turn9 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut in our sequence, after the last action (at turn9) we update to turn10 and are at (0,9). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 9 by a different route? \n\nSuppose we try to avoid freeway1 at turn1 by going to y=1 at a later turn? but that would require more stays.\n\nOr we could go up to y=1 at turn2 without staying? we have to stay at turn0 to avoid being at y=1 at turn1.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\n  turn0: S -> then at turn1: y=0\n  turn1: we do S again? then at turn2: y=0 -> then we can go to y=1 at turn3? \n      Then we need 8 more moves: total 10 moves? same.\n\nBut we can go to y=1 at turn2: which we already do.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down? but we are at 0.\n\nSo I don't see a faster way.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5? we are at y=5 at turn6. But freeway5 is unsafe at turn8 and 9. \n\nWhat if we try to be at freeway5 at a different turn? \n\nBut we are going at a constant speed. We can slow down or speed up? \n\nFor example, if we go up faster? we are already going one per turn.\n\nOr if we wait at a safe row to avoid being at freeway5 at turn8 or 9? \n\nBut we are at freeway5 at turn6, which is safe, so we don't need to wait.\n\nBut what if we are forced to be at freeway5 at turn8? we are not.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway6: we are at y=6 at turn7. Freeway6 is unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we are at freeway6 at turn3? \n\nSuppose we try to go faster: \n\n  We are at y0=0 at turn0.\n  We do U at turn0: then at turn1: y1=1 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must not do that.\n\nAlternatively, we do:\n\n  turn0: S -> safe.\n  turn1: U -> then at turn2: y=1 -> safe.\n  then we do U at turn2: y=2 at turn3 -> safe.\n  turn3: U -> y=3 at turn4 -> safe.\n  turn4: U -> y=4 at turn5 -> safe.\n  turn5: U -> y=5 at turn6 -> safe (freeway5: turn6 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n  turn6: U -> y=6 at turn7 -> safe (freeway6: unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe).\n  turn7: U -> y=7 at turn8 -> safe (freeway7: unsafe at 2 -> safe).\n  turn8: U -> y=8 at turn9 -> safe (freeway8: unsafe at 2 -> safe).\n  turn9: U -> y=9 at turn10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut what if we do:\n\n  turn0: S -> y0=0 at turn1.\n  turn1: U -> y1=1 at turn2.\n  then we do two moves in one turn? we cannot.\n\nOr we can stay at a safe row to avoid a later obstacle? \n\nFor example, freeway5 is unsafe at turn8 and 9. \n\nWe are at freeway5 at turn6. But if we stay at freeway5 for two turns? then we would be at freeway5 at turn6 and turn7? safe. Then at turn7 we move to freeway6? \n\nBut then we would be at freeway5 at turn6 and turn7? but freeway5 is safe at turn7? yes (7 not in {2,3,8,9}).\n\nBut that would add extra moves: \n  ... \n  turn5: U -> y5=5 at turn6.\n  turn6: S -> stay at 5 -> at turn7: still at 5.\n  turn7: U -> y7=6 at turn8.\n\nThen we are at freeway6 at turn8? \n  Freeway6: unsafe at 0,1,2 -> turn8 is safe? yes.\n\nBut then we have added two extra moves: one stay at turn6 and one at turn0 -> total 11 moves? which is worse.\n\nSo we don't want that.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 10.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path that takes 9 moves? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the end of the 9th move (so at turn10 we are at y=9? no: after 9 moves we are at turn9? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\n  Start: turn0, y0=0.\n  After move0 (at turn0): we are at turn1: y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n  After move1 (at turn1): at turn2: y2 = y1 + Δy1.\n  ...\n  After move8 (at turn8): at turn9: y9 = y8 + Δy8.\n\nWe want y9=9.\n\nSo we need 9 moves? \n\nBut we start at 0. To get to 9, we need 9 up moves? \n\nSo the actions: 9 ups. But then:\n\n  turn0: U -> y1=1 at turn1 -> unsafe (freeway1 at turn1) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot do 9 consecutive ups.\n\nWe must have at least one non-up move. Then total moves = 9 (ups) + at least one non-up = 10? \n\nBut we can have 9 ups and one non-up? but that would be 10 moves.\n\nBut note: we start at 0. If we do 9 ups and one stay, then we end at 9? yes. But we have to distribute the stay.\n\nWe did one stay at the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, we could do a stay later? \n\nFor example:\n\n  turn0: U -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n  Or: \n    turn0: S -> safe.\n    turn1: U -> then we are at 1 at turn2 -> safe.\n    then we do 8 ups: \n        turn2: U -> turn3:2\n        turn3: U -> turn4:3\n        ...\n        turn9: U -> turn10:9.\n\nTotal moves: 10 (one S and 9 U).\n\nWe could do:\n\n    turn0: U -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n    turn0: S\n    turn1: U\n    turn2: U\n    ... until turn8: U -> then at turn9: we are at y9 = 8? \n        because we did 8 ups? (from turn1 to turn8: 8 moves) -> but we started at 0, then at turn1:0, turn2:1, turn3:2, ... turn9:8? then we need one more up at turn9 to get to 9 at turn10.\n\nSo we need the 9th up at turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must have 10 moves.\n\nSo the answer is 10 moves.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut let me write it in the required format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and here t1=0.\n\nSo the actions are for turns 0,1,...,9.\n\nBut wait: the player starts at turn0 at (0,0). Then we do action at turn0: S -> then at turn1 we are still at (0,0). Then at turn1 we do U -> then at turn2 we are at (0,1). Then at turn2: U -> turn3: (0,2), and so on.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at turn6: we are at y=5 at turn6? \n\nThe unsafe times for freeway5: 2,3,8,9 -> turn6 is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway6 at turn7: we are at y=6 at turn7 -> freeway6 unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway7 at turn8: we are at y=7 at turn8 -> unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn9: y=8 at turn9 -> unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, this sequence works.\n\nBut is there a sequence with 10 moves that uses a down? probably not necessary and would be slower.\n\nSo we have the minimal H=10.\n\nBut note: we are at turn0: the initial state. The sequence of actions is for turns 0 to 9.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by incorporating a stay action at turn 0 to bypass the unsafe condition on freeway 1 at turn 1. Subsequent actions are up moves to progress vertically to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 0**: Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars).\n- **Turn 1**: Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars).\n- **Turn 2**: Player at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1).

Freeway 4 is unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14; turn 5 is safe.\n- **Turn 6**: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is unsafe at turns 2, 3, 8, 9; turn 6 is safe.\n- **Turn 7**: Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move horizontally on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn when a car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars on the new row during the move turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 1, I'm at (0,0). I need to reach (0,9).\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn and for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speeds, I can find for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nThe turn counter: let's define t relative to t_1. Since t_1=1, turn t_1 + t for t starting from 0.\n\nI should think in terms of turns from now: let τ = 0 be the current turn (t_1=1), so at τ=0, I'm at y=0. I need to get to y=9 at some turn τ = H-1, where H is the number of turns including the starting point? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9)? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action at time t affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, action a_t determines Δy_t, which is applied to get y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which means actions from time t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these actions, the positions are from time t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\nAt time t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at time t_1, we get y_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H - 1} at time t_1 + H - 1, we get y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H - 1, we have position at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at some turn, and it says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at time t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAt time t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at time t_1, we get y_{t_1 + 1} at time t_1 + 1.\n\nSo at time t, position is y_t.\n\nWe start at time t_1, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t} = 9 for some t.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 for the indices, meaning actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the last position is at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means at time t_1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nBut at time t_1 + H - 1, we apply action a_{t_1 + H - 1} to get y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, that means we are already at 9 at time t_1 + H - 1, before the action? No.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t is before the action.\n\nAfter action, at time t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the context, \"reach (0,9)\" means at some time T, y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so after H actions, we have from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_T = 9 for some T between t_1 and t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", so it specifies that at time t_1 + H - 1, we are at 9.\n\nThen, at time t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9, and we may or may not take an action, but since we are already at 9, and the action sequence includes H actions, the last action a_{t_1 + H - 1} is applied when we are at y=9, but if we are at 9, we can only go down or stay, but we want to be at 9, so we should stay or something.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that we need to arrive at y=9 at time t_1 + H - 1, meaning that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at time t_1 + H - 1.\n\nLet's see the action sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t_1, we have y at t_1+1.\n\nAfter action at t_1+H-1, we have y at t_1+H.\n\nWe want y at some time to be 9, but the problem says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at time t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAt time t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1 + H - 1} to get y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about y_{t_1 + H} as long as we are at 9 at t_1 + H - 1.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t_1 + H - 1, and at that time, we are at y=9, so the action could be S, U, or D, but if we U, we go to 10, which is invalid, since y in [0,9], so we must have y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 and action S or D, but D would take us to 8, which is not 9, so to be at 9 at that time, the action should be S if we are already at 9, or U from 8 or D from 10, but 10 is invalid, so we must be at 8 or 9 or 10, but 10 not allowed, so from 8 with U or from 9 with S or from 10 with D, but 10 not allowed, so only from 8 with U to 9 or from 9 with S to 9.\n\nSimilarly, we could be at 9 and D to 8, but then at time t_1 + H - 1 we are at 9 before action, and after action we are at 8 or 9 or 10.\n\nBut the position at time t_1 + H - 1 is y=9, so before action at t_1 + H - 1, we are at 9.\n\nThen when we apply action, we can choose to stay or move, but the goal is to be at 9 at that time, so the action at that time doesn't change the fact that we are at 9 at that time.\n\nFor the purpose of reaching, it's fine.\n\nIn this case, for the sequence, H is the number of actions, and we are at y=9 at time t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo for example, if we start at y=0 at t_1, we need to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9, since we need to move up 9 times, but we can stay or move down, so it might take more turns if we detour.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nAlso, at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, only freeways 1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn t_1 = 1.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each car, given at t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for turn T, span is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] for left-moving, but direction: let's see.\n\nThe update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], and since it's left-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and as time increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists the cars with (h, τ, d, s)\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars at t_1=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t_1=1 is [τ, h] = [-47, 0] because tail at -47, head at 0.\n\nFor right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so [tail, head] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with head h, tail τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSo d=right, so at t_1=1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T - 1), 0 + 48(T - 1)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as 1, (0, -47, right, 48), so same span.\n\nFreeway 3: (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nd=right, so span at t_1=1: [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nThen Span(T) = [-55 + 4(T-1), -44 + 4(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (-42, -53, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1=1:\n\nFirst car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-42, -53, right, 6), so since right, span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nSecond car: (-6, -17, right, 6), span [-17, -6]\n\nThird car: (30, 19, right, 6), but 30 and 19, if head is 30, tail 19, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nIn the state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so if h > τ, it's fine, but here for third car, h=30, τ=19, so τ=19, h=30, so span [19,30]\n\nBut direction right, so moving right.\n\nSimilarly, first car h=-42, τ=-53, since -42 > -53, so τ=-53, h=-42, span [-53,-42]\n\nSecond car τ=-17, h=-6, span [-17,-6]\n\nThird car τ=19, h=30, span [19,30]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] for each.\n\ns=6 for all.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (52, 41, right, 4), and (4, -7, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (h, τ, d, s) = (52, 41, right, 4), so span at t_1=1: [τ, h] = [41,52]\n\nSecond car: (4, -7, right, 4), span [-7,4]\n\nFreeway 7: (24, 47, left, 24)\n\nd=left, so for left-moving, at t_1=1, span is [h, τ] = [24,47]? Head h=24, tail τ=47, but if left-moving, head is at smaller x? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn this case, h=24, τ=47, so head at 24, tail at 47? That would mean the car is from 24 to 47, which is right, but direction is left? Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined based on direction.\n\nIn the description: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail at τ\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIf it's left-moving, and span [h, τ] at t_1, then after moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut if h and τ, with h < τ, then [h, τ] is from left to right, but moving left, so the head is on the left, I think.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, if head is on the right.\n\nIn freeway 7: (24, 47, left, 24), so d=left, so at t_1=1, span is [h, τ] = [24,47]\n\nBut 24 to 47, with head at 24? If moving left, head should be the front when moving, so if moving left, front is smaller x.\n\nSo [24,47] with left-moving means the car occupies x from 24 to 47, and moving left, so at T, [24 - s(T-1), 47 - s(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: same, (24,47, left,24)\n\nNow, for collision, at turn T, for freeway k, if there is a car with 0 in its span at T, then it is occupied.\n\nI need for each freeway and for each turn T, to see if x=0 is covered.\n\nLet t = T - t_1 = T - 1, so relative turn from now.\n\nAt relative turn τ = 0, which is absolute turn t_1=1.\n\nThen at relative turn τ, absolute turn T = t_1 + τ = 1 + τ.\n\nThen for a car, at relative turn τ, the span depends on s and d.\n\nAlso, for the player, at time t, which is absolute, position y_t.\n\nAt time t, if y_t = k for k=1 to 8, then we need that at that time, for freeway k, x=0 is not covered by any car.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find when x=0 is covered.\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, s=48, at τ=0 (T=1), span [ -47, 0 ] for right-moving, so [τ, h] = [-47, 0], so x=0 is covered since 0 is in [-47,0].\n\nAt τ=0, covered.\n\nNow, when is it covered? Span at τ: [ -47 + 48τ, 0 + 48τ ] = [ -47 + 48τ, 48τ ]\n\n0 is in this span if -47 + 48τ <= 0 <= 48τ\n\nSince 48τ >=0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 48τ always for τ>=0? 48τ >=0, but 0 <= 48τ only if τ >=0, which is true.\n\n-47 + 48τ <= 0 and 0 <= 48τ\n\n0 <= 48τ: since τ >=0, 48τ >=0, so 0 <= 48τ always true for τ >=0.\n\n-47 + 48τ <= 0 ⇒ 48τ <= 47 ⇒ τ <= 47/48 < 1, so for τ=0, it is true, for τ>=1, false.\n\nAt τ=0, -47 + 0 = -47 <=0, and 0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=1, span [ -47+48, 48] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48]\n\nSimilarly for τ>1, higher, so only at τ=0, x=0 covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same as 1, only at τ=0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: d=right, s=4, at τ=0, span [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nx=0 covered if -55 + 4τ <= 0 <= -44 + 4τ\n\nSince span [ -55 + 4τ, -44 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in span if -55 + 4τ <= 0 <= -44 + 4τ\n\nSo left: -55 + 4τ <= 0 ⇒ 4τ <= 55 ⇒ τ <= 55/4 = 13.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -44 + 4τ ⇒ 44 <= 4τ ⇒ τ >= 11\n\nSo for τ from 11 to 13 inclusive, since τ integer.\n\nτ >=11 and τ <=13.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: d=right, s=6, span at τ: [ -53 + 6τ, -42 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6τ <= 0 <= -42 + 6τ\n\nLeft: -53 + 6τ <= 0 ⇒ 6τ <=53 ⇒ τ <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so τ <=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 + 6τ ⇒ 42 <= 6τ ⇒ τ >= 7\n\nSo τ from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nSecond car: span at τ: [ -17 + 6τ, -6 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -17 + 6τ <= 0 <= -6 + 6τ\n\nLeft: -17 + 6τ <=0 ⇒ 6τ <=17 ⇒ τ <= 17/6 ≈2.833, τ <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -6 + 6τ ⇒ 6 <= 6τ ⇒ τ >=1\n\nSo τ from 1 to 2 inclusive.\n\nThird car: span at τ: [19 + 6τ, 30 + 6τ] since [τ + sτ, h + sτ] with τ=0, s=6, [19,30] at τ=0, so [19+6τ, 30+6τ]\n\nMin 19+6τ >=19>0 for τ>=0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied when:\n\nFrom first car: τ=7,8\n\nSecond car: τ=1,2\n\nThird car: never\n\nSo overall, occupied at τ=1,2,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4), span at τ: [41 + 4τ, 52 + 4τ] min 41>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (4,-7,right,4), span at τ: [-7 + 4τ, 4 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -7 + 4τ <= 0 <= 4 + 4τ\n\nLeft: -7 + 4τ <=0 ⇒ 4τ <=7 ⇒ τ <= 7/4=1.75, τ <=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 4 + 4τ ⇒ -4 <= 4τ, always true since τ>=0, 4τ>=0.\n\n0 <= 4 + 4τ, since 4+4τ >=4>0, always true.\n\nBut the inequality is -7+4τ <=0 <= 4+4τ\n\n0 <= 4+4τ is always true for τ>=0.\n\n-7+4τ <=0 ⇒ τ <=1.75, so τ=0,1\n\nAt τ=0, span [-7,4], 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nAt τ=1, span [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt τ=2, span [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at τ=0,1.\n\nNow freeway 7: d=left, s=24, at τ=0, span [h, τ] = [24,47] for left-moving.\n\nSpan at τ: [24 - 24τ, 47 - 24τ]\n\n0 in span if 24 - 24τ <= 0 <= 47 - 24τ\n\nLeft: 24 - 24τ <= 0 ⇒ 24 <= 24τ ⇒ τ >=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 47 - 24τ ⇒ 24τ <=47 ⇒ τ <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958, so τ <=1\n\nThus τ >=1 and τ <=1, so only at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as 7, occupied only at τ=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and τ, when occupied (x=0 covered):\n\nτ starts from 0 (current turn)\n\nFreeway 1: occ at τ=0\n\nFreeway 2: occ at τ=0\n\nFreeway 3: occ at τ=11,12,13\n\nFreeway 4: occ at τ=11,12,13\n\nFreeway 5: occ at τ=1,2,7,8\n\nFreeway 6: occ at τ=0,1\n\nFreeway 7: occ at τ=1\n\nFreeway 8: occ at τ=1\n\nFor other τ and freeways, not occupied.\n\nNow, player starts at τ=0, y=0. At y=0, no car, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, say at relative time τ_f, y_{τ_f} =9.\n\nSince at τ=0, y=0, and we move with actions, each action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, minimal steps is 9 up actions, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid occupied freeways.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9 at time τ_f = H-1? Let's clarify timing with relative time.\n\nSet relative time: at time τ (absolute t_1 + τ), position y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_τ at time τ, we get y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nWe want y_τ = 9 for some τ.\n\nThe action sequence is for τ from 0 to H-1, meaning actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, and we want that at time τ = H-1, y_{H-1} = 9? From the problem.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, absolute times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nPosition at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H, with y_{t_1} given.\n\nAfter H actions, positions from time t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAt relative time, let τ be offset from t_1, so at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe take actions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nThen position at time τ is y_τ.\n\nAfter a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at τ=0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and we want y_{1-1} = y_0 =9, but y_0=0, not 9, impossible.\n\nIf H=1, we want y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =0=9? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1, with H=1, t_1 +0 = t_1, y_{t_1} =0, not 9.\n\nWith H actions, from τ=0 to H-1, we have positions y_0 to y_H.\n\ny_0 at τ=0, y_1 at τ=1, ..., y_H at τ=H.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nThat means at time τ=H-1, position is 9.\n\nThen we apply action a_{H-1} to get y_H, but we don't care about y_H.\n\nSince we are at 9 at τ=H-1, and we must have gotten there from previous position.\n\nMinimal τ to be at y=9 is 9, if we go up every turn, but y_9 =9 if we go up from y_0=0 in 9 steps.\n\ny_0=0, after first up, y_1=1, ..., after 9th up at τ=8, y_9=9.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8=8, action U, y_9=9.\n\nThen at time τ=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIf we are at y_9=9 at τ=9, then for that to be y_{H-1}, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach earlier, but minimal is 9 steps to y_9.\n\ny_k for k=0 to 9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=8, y_9=9\n\nSo at time τ=9, y=9.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9, so if y_{H-1} =9, then H-1 =9, H=10.\n\nWith 9 actions, we reach y_9=9.\n\nThe position at time τ is y_τ.\n\nTo have y_τ=9, it takes at least τ=9 actions if we start from 0 and go up each time.\n\nWith actions from τ=0 to τ=8, 9 actions, we get to y_9=9 at time τ=9.\n\nThen y_{H-1} =9 implies H-1=9, H=10, but with 9 actions we are at y_9, so for H=10, we have actions from τ=0 to 9, and y_{10-1}=y_9=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we can reach faster, but from 0 to 9, minimal 9 up actions, so minimal τ=9 to be at y=9.\n\ny_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nSo minimal H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut we might take more turns if we wait.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we aim for H=10, with y_9=9.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at τ=9, with positions at each τ from 0 to 9.\n\nAt each time τ, if y_τ = k for k=1 to 8, it must not be occupied at that τ.\n\ny_τ is position at time τ.\n\nFor τ from 0 to 9, y_τ must be safe when y_τ between 1 and 8.\n\nAt τ=0, y_0=0, safe.\n\nAt τ=9, y_9=9, safe.\n\nWe need y_1 to y_8 for times τ=1 to 8? Positions at times τ=1 to 8 are y_1 to y_8, which are between 1 and 8 possibly.\n\ny_τ for τ=1 to 8 could be from 1 to 8, and must be safe.\n\nNow, the path: we start at y_0=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ for τ=0 to 8.\n\nWe want y_9=9.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on occupied freeways at the wrong time.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, and time τ, we have occupation status.\n\nWe need to choose a sequence of y_τ for τ=0 to 9, with y_0=0, y_9=9, and |y_{τ+1} - y_τ| <=1, and for each τ, if y_τ = k for k=1-8, then freeway k not occupied at τ.\n\ny_τ is position at time τ, so for that time and row, must be safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each τ, which rows are occupied.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt τ=0: occupied freeways: 1,2,6 (since freeway 1,2,6 occ at τ=0)\n\nAlso freeway 6 at τ=0.\n\nAnd freeway 1,2,6.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 at τ=0, freeway 6 at τ=0,1.\n\nAt τ=0: occ: 1,2,6\n\nAt τ=1: occ freeways: from above, freeway 5 at τ=1,2; freeway 6 at τ=0,1; freeway 7 at τ=1; freeway 8 at τ=1.\n\nSo at τ=1: occ: 5,6,7,8\n\nFreeway 5 occ at τ=1,2; freeway 6 occ at τ=1; freeway 7 occ at τ=1; freeway 8 occ at τ=1.\n\nSo at τ=1: occupied: 5,6,7,8\n\nAt τ=2: occ: freeway 5 at τ=2 (since τ=1,2 for 5), and freeway 6 not occ at τ=2, freeway 7 only τ=1, etc.\n\nFreeway 5 occ at τ=2, and no others at τ=2 except freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 3,4 at τ=11,12,13 later.\n\nSo at τ=2: occ only freeway 5.\n\nAt τ=3: no occ, since freeway 5 only up to τ=2? Freeway 5 occ at τ=1,2,7,8. τ=3 not occ.\n\nOthers not at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly τ=4,5,6: no occ, except freeway 5 at τ=7,8.\n\nτ=7: freeway 5 occ\n\nτ=8: freeway 5 occ\n\nτ=9: no occ, since freeway 5 at τ=7,8, not 9.\n\nτ=10: no, etc.\n\nBut we only care up to τ=9 for now.\n\nAt τ=3,4,5,6: no occupied freeways.\n\nAt τ=7,8: freeway 5 occupied.\n\nAt τ=9: no occupied.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe need to be at y_τ for τ=0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0\n\nWe want y_9=9.\n\nTo go up as fast as possible, we should increase y each turn if possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on occupied rows at occupied times.\n\nSpecifically, at each time τ, for the position y_τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at that τ.\n\nNow, let's list for each τ, the forbidden y if occupied.\n\nAt τ=0: occupied rows: 1,2,6 → so y cannot be 1,2,6 at τ=0. But at τ=0, y_0=0, which is not 1-8, so safe, no issue.\n\ny_τ=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y_τ=9 safe.\n\nOnly when y_τ = k for k=1-8, need to check.\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=0, safe.\n\nAt τ=1: occupied rows: 5,6,7,8 → so if y_1 is 5,6,7, or 8, it would be collision.\n\nBut y_1 is position after first action, at time τ=1.\n\ny_1 can be from 0 to 1, since from y_0=0, action a_0: U to 1, D to -1 invalid, or S to 0.\n\nSo possible y_1: 0 or 1.\n\nNow, at τ=1, if y_1=1, but row 1 is not occupied at τ=1? At τ=1, occupied rows are 5,6,7,8.\n\nRow 1 is free at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, row 2,3,4 are free at τ=1.\n\nOnly 5,6,7,8 occupied.\n\nSo if y_1=1, it is safe, since row 1 not occupied.\n\nIf y_1=0, also safe.\n\nBut we want to go up, so probably U to y_1=1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, y_1=1, safe.\n\nNow action a_1, to y_2.\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1, so from y_1=1, can go to 0,1,2.\n\nAt τ=2, occupied rows: only row 5.\n\nSo if y_2=5, collision, else safe.\n\nWe can go to y_2=2, for example.\n\nThen y_2=2 at τ=2, safe since 2 not 5.\n\nSimilarly, continue.\n\nBut we need to reach y_9=9.\n\nNow, at later times, we have issues at τ=7 and 8 with row 5 occupied.\n\nBut row 5 is occupied at τ=7 and 8, so we cannot be on row 5 at τ=7 or τ=8.\n\nAlso, at τ=1 and 2, row 5 occupied, but we are at low rows now.\n\nLet's plan the path step by step.\n\nStart τ=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_0: we can U or S.\n\nIf U, y_1=1\n\nIf S, y_1=0\n\nSince we want to go up, U to y_1=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, row 1 not occupied (since occ only 5,6,7,8), so safe.\n\nNow τ=1, action a_1: from y=1, can go to 0,1,2.\n\nWe want to go up, so U to y_2=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, occupied only row 5, so row 2 safe.\n\nAction a_2: U to y_3=3\n\nAt τ=3, no occupied rows, safe.\n\nAction a_3: U to y_4=4\n\nτ=4, no occ, safe.\n\nAction a_4: U to y_5=5\n\nNow, at τ=5, y=5.\n\nBut row 5: when is it occupied? At τ=1,2,7,8.\n\nAt τ=5, not occupied, so safe.\n\nBut we need to be careful for later.\n\nAction a_4 at τ=4 to go to y_5=5 at τ=5.\n\nNow at τ=5, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_5: we can go to y_6=4,5, or 6.\n\nWe want up, so U to y_6=6.\n\nAt τ=6, no occupied rows, so row 6 safe.\n\ny_6=6.\n\nAction a_6: U to y_7=7\n\nNow at τ=7, y=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, occupied rows: row 5 is occupied, but row 7? At τ=7, which rows occupied?\n\nFrom above, at τ=7, freeway 5 occupied, and that's it? Freeway 5 occ at τ=7,8.\n\nBut row 7: is it occupied at τ=7?\n\nAt τ=7, occupied only freeway 5, since freeway 7 only at τ=1, etc.\n\nSo row 7 is not occupied at τ=7, so y_7=7 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 occupied, but we are on row 7.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAction a_6 at τ=6 to y_7=7 at τ=7.\n\nThen action a_7: U to y_8=8\n\nAt τ=8, y=8.\n\nOccupied at τ=8: freeway 5 occupied, row 8 not occupied (freeway 8 only at τ=1), so safe.\n\nThen action a_8: U to y_9=9\n\nAt τ=9, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we need to check if at any point we were on occupied row.\n\nLet's list:\n\nτ: y_τ\n\n0: 0 safe\n\n1: 1 safe (row1 not occ at τ=1)\n\n2: 2 safe (row2 not occ at τ=2)\n\n3: 3 safe (no occ)\n\n4: 4 safe (no occ)\n\n5: 5 safe? At τ=5, row5: occupied at τ=1,2,7,8, not at τ=5, so safe.\n\n6: 6 safe (no occ at τ=6)\n\n7: 7 safe? At τ=7, occupied only row5, row7 safe.\n\n8: 8 safe? At τ=8, occupied only row5, row8 safe.\n\n9: 9 safe\n\nAll seem safe.\n\nBut at τ=7 and τ=8, row5 is occupied, but we are on row7 and 8, not row5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIn this path, we go directly up, no problem.\n\nBut earlier at τ=1, we were on row1, which is fine.\n\nIs there any constraint I missed?\n\nWhat about freeway 6 at τ=0 and1, but we were not on it at those times.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions: actions from τ=0 to 8, all U, we reach y_9=9 at τ=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, H=9? But earlier I thought H=10.\n\nLet's see.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_8, that's 9 actions.\n\nAfter a_8 at τ=8, we have y_9=9 at time τ=9.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9.\n\ny_{H-1} =9.\n\nWith actions from τ=0 to H-2? Let's index properly.\n\nRelative time: let τ be time index.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ at time τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nStart: at time τ=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k}, y_{k+1}.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nThat means at time τ=H-1, position is 9.\n\nFor example, to be at y_9=9 at time 9, then H-1=9, H=10.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_8, we have y_0 to y_9, with y_9=9.\n\ny_9 is at time τ=9.\n\nSet τ=H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nThen actions from τ=0 to 9? H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H actions, at times t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter that, position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIn relative, at time τ = H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn our case, to have y_{H-1}=9, we need to reach at time H-1.\n\nMinimal H-1 is 9, so H=10.\n\nWith 9 actions: a_0 to a_8, we get to y_9 at time 9.\n\nSo for y_{H-1}=9, set H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from τ=0 to 9, but we need only up to a_8 to reach y_9.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_8, we have y_9=9.\n\nFor H=10, actions from τ=0 to 9, but a_9 is not needed, or we can do S at the end.\n\nIn the sequence for H=10, actions a_0 to a_9, with y_{10} after, but we want y_9=9 at time 9.\n\nSo at time τ=9, y_9=9, and we take action a_9, which can be S, for example.\n\nThen y_{10} =9 or something.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we include a_9.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should have H as small as possible.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but from 0 to 9, it takes at least 9 steps to change y, so we cannot reach before time 9.\n\nAt time τ=0, y=0; time τ=1, y=1; ... time τ=9, y=9 is the earliest.\n\nAt time τ=8, y could be 8 or 9, but if y_8=9, then we reached at time 8, but to have y_8=9, we need to have come from y_7=8 or 9 or 10, but 10 invalid, so from y_7=8 with U or y_7=9 with S, but y_7=9 requires even earlier.\n\nMinimal time to y=9 is time 9, from y_0=0.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nSo minimal τ to reach is 9.\n\nThus for y_{H-1}=9, minimal H-1=9, H=10.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_8 all U, and then at time τ=9, we need an action, but since we are at y_9=9, we can do S for a_9.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=10, actions from τ=0 to 9.\n\na_0 to a_8: U, then a_9: S.\n\nBut a_9 is at time τ=9, and after that y_10=9, but we don't care.\n\nWe need y_{H-1}=y_9=9.\n\nIn the path above, with all U, it seems safe.\n\nBut let's verify the occupation times again.\n\nIn the path: times τ and y_τ:\n\nτ=0: y=0, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, row1: at τ=1, occupied? Earlier: at τ=1, occupied rows 5,6,7,8. Row1 not occupied, so safe.\n\nτ=2: y=2, row2 not occupied (only row5 occ), safe.\n\nτ=3: y=3, no occ, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=4, no occ, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=5, row5: occupied at τ=1,2,7,8; not at τ=5, so safe.\n\nτ=6: y=6, no occ at τ=6, safe.\n\nτ=7: y=7, row7: at τ=7, occupied? Freeway 7 occupied only at τ=1, not τ=7. So row7 safe.\n\nτ=8: y=8, row8 occupied only at τ=1, not τ=8, safe.\n\nτ=9: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in this, at τ=7, we are on row7, which is fine.\n\nBut freeway 5 is occupied at τ=7, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but the player position: at each time, we are on a row, and for that row at that time, no car covering x=0.\n\nIn this case, all safe.\n\nBut let's check freeway 5 specifically.\n\nAt τ=7, freeway 5 occupied, but we are on freeway 7, so no collision.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but we cannot.\n\nSo minimal H=10, with actions: a_1 to a_10? Absolute times.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence index.\n\nSet t as the offset.\n\nActions: for t=0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nWith t_1=1.\n\nSo for H=10, actions at times: t_1 +0 =1, t_1+1=2, ..., t_1+9=10.\n\nActions a_1 to a_10.\n\nIn terms of the action: at time 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAfter action at time 10, position at time 11.\n\nBut we want position at time t_1 + H -1 =1 +10 -1=10 to be 9.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions:\n\nAt time 1: action, to y_2\n\n...\n\nAt time 10: action, to y_{11}\n\nWe want y_{10}=9.\n\nAt time 10, position y_{10}=9.\n\nThen action at time 10 determines y_{11}.\n\nIn our relative time, at τ=10, y_{10}=9? No.\n\nSet absolute times.\n\nAt time t_1=1, y_1=0\n\nAction a_1 at time 1, to y_2\n\nAction a_2 at time 2, to y_3\n\n...\n\nAction a_k at time k, to y_{k+1}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{1 + H -1} =9\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nWith actions from time t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut y_T with T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, to have y_T=9 at time T.\n\nMinimal T is 10, since from time 1 y=0 to time 10 y=9, with 9 up actions.\n\nFor example: at time 1, y=0\n\na_1: U, y_2=1 at time 2\n\na_2: U, y_3=2 at time 3\n\n...\n\na_8: U, y_9=8 at time 9\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=9 at time 10\n\nThen at time 10, y=9.\n\nSo T=10, y_{10}=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =10, t_1=1, so 1 + H -1 =10, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to 9: a_{1+0} to a_{1+9}, i.e., a_1 to a_10.\n\nBut in the sequence, a_1 to a_9: U, and a_{10}: ? At time 10, we are at y_{10}=9, but action at time 10 is applied to get y_{11}.\n\nSince we need y_{10}=9 at time 10, we don't need to specify action beyond, but the sequence includes H actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{1+10-1}=a_{10}.\n\nAt time 10, position y_{10}=9, we take action a_{10}, which can be S, then y_{11}=9.\n\nIn the path above, with a_1 to a_9 all U, we have y_{10}=9 at time 10.\n\na_1 at time 1: to y_2=1\n\na_2 at time 2: to y_3=2\n\n...\n\na_9 at time 9: to y_{10}=9\n\nThen at time 10, y_{10}=9.\n\nNow for H=10, we need action at time 10, a_{10}, which we can set to S, then y_{11}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut in terms of the actions, from a_1 to a_9 are U, a_{10} is S.\n\nSince we are already at 9 at time 10, we could have stopped earlier, but we need H actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nWith H=10, it includes a_{10}.\n\nNow, back to the occupation.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTime t (absolute): y_t\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=1, at time 2, τ relative: τ = t - t_1 = t -1\n\nBetter to use relative τ.\n\nτ = t - t_1 = t -1\n\nAt absolute time t, relative time τ = t -1\n\nAt t=1, τ=0, y=0\n\nt=2, τ=1, y=1\n\nt=3, τ=2, y=2\n\nt=4, τ=3, y=3\n\nt=5, τ=4, y=4\n\nt=6, τ=5, y=5\n\nt=7, τ=6, y=6\n\nt=8, τ=7, y=7\n\nt=9, τ=8, y=8\n\nt=10, τ=9, y=9\n\nNow, at each time, check:\n\nt=2, τ=1, y=1: row 1, at τ=1, occupied rows 5,6,7,8, not row 1, safe.\n\nt=3, τ=2, y=2: row 2, at τ=2, occupied only row 5, not row 2, safe.\n\nt=4, τ=3, y=3: no occupied, safe.\n\nt=5, τ=4, y=4: no occupied, safe.\n\nt=6, τ=5, y=5: row 5, at τ=5, not occupied (occ at τ=1,2,7,8), so safe.\n\nt=7, τ=6, y=6: at τ=6, no occupied, safe.\n\nt=8, τ=7, y=7: row 7, at τ=7, occupied only row 5, not row 7, safe.\n\nt=9, τ=8, y=8: row 8, at τ=8, occupied only row 5, not row 8, safe.\n\nt=10, τ=9, y=9: safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at t=6, τ=5, y=5, which is safe.\n\nIs there any problem with freeway 5 at τ=5? No.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 5 occupied at τ=7,8, but we are not on it.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5, at τ=5, not occupied, so fine.\n\nPerhaps we can confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 at τ=5 (absolute t=6).\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, but in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in this case, it seems we can go directly up without issue.\n\nBut let's see if at some point it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, if we were on row 5, it would be occupied, but we are on row 1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, row 5 occupied, but we are on row 7.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10, with actions: a1=U, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=S\n\nBut a10=S at time 10.\n\nSince we reach at time 10, and action at time 10 can be S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the last action, since we are at 9, we must not move up or down beyond, but S is fine.\n\nWe could have reached at time 10 with a9=U from y9=8.\n\nIn the sequence above.\n\nNow, but the problem is to output the actions from turn t1.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can have smaller H.\n\nSuppose H=9, then t1 + H -1 =1+9-1=9, y9=9.\n\nBut to have y9=9 at time 9, we need to be at y=9 at time 9.\n\nFrom y1=0 at time 1, to y9=9 at time 9, we need 8 steps? Let's see.\n\nAt time 1, y1=0\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\n...\n\nAfter a8, y9\n\nWe want y9=9.\n\nSo with actions a1 to a8, we get y2 to y9.\n\ny9=9.\n\nThen time from 1 to 9, with y9=9.\n\nBut y1=0, to y9=9, with 8 actions: a1 to a8.\n\nFor example: a1:U, y2=1\n\na2:U, y3=2\n\n...\n\na8:U, y9=9\n\nThen at time 9, y9=9.\n\nThen for H=9, we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{1+9-1}=y9=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to 8: a_{1+0} to a_{1+8}, i.e., a1 to a9? Indices.\n\nActions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nFor H=9, t from 0 to 8, actions at times t1 + t = 1+0=1 to 1+8=9.\n\nSo a1 to a9.\n\nBut with a1 to a8: U, we have y9=9 at time 9.\n\nThen a9 at time 9: we need to specify, but at time 9, y9=9, we can set a9=S, then y10=9.\n\nBut we don't care about y10.\n\nIn this case, with H=9, we have actions a1 to a9, but with a1 to a8 U, a9 S.\n\nThen y9=9 is achieved with the actions up to a8, but a9 is extra.\n\nFor H=9, we have y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{1+9-1}=y9=9, which is satisfied.\n\nAnd actions include a9, which is fine.\n\nBut minimal H: with H=9, we reach at time 9, whereas with H=10, we reach at time 10, so H=9 is smaller.\n\nEarlier I thought minimal time is 9, from time 1 to time 9.\n\nAt time 1, y=0\n\nTime 2, y=1\n\n...\n\nTime 9, y=8 if we go up 7 times? Let's count.\n\nStart: time 1, y=0\n\nAfter a1 at time 1: y2 = y1 + Δy1, but y1 is at time 1.\n\nAction at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time 1, y1=0\n\na1: U, then y2=1 at time 2\n\na2: U, y3=2 at time 3\n\n...\n\na8: U, y9=9 at time 9\n\nSo with 8 actions (a1 to a8), we reach y9=9 at time 9.\n\nThen for the sequence, if H=9, actions from t=0 to 8: a_{1+0} to a_{1+8}, i.e., a1 to a9.\n\nBut a9 is at time 9, which is after we are at y9=9.\n\nAt time 9, we are at y9=9, then a9 action to y10.\n\nFor H=9, we need actions up to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{1+9-1}=a9.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1}=y9=9.\n\nSo it works with a1 to a8: U, and a9: S, for example.\n\nBut we can have a9 as U or D, but U would go to 10 invalid, so must be S or D, but D to 8, then not at 9, but since we are at 9 before action, it is fine, but to avoid going down, we set S.\n\nNow, with H=8: then y_{1+8-1}=y8=9.\n\nBut to have y8=9 at time 8.\n\nFrom y1=0 at time 1 to y8=9 at time 8.\n\ny8=9.\n\nThen actions a1 to a7: with a1:U to y2=1, ..., a7:U to y8=8? Let's see.\n\ny1=0\n\na1:U, y2=1\n\na2:U, y3=2\n\na3:U, y4=3\n\na4:U, y5=4\n\na5:U, y6=5\n\na6:U, y7=6\n\na7:U, y8=7\n\nTo have y8=9, we need to increase faster, but each action changes y by at most 1, so from y1=0, after 7 actions, y8 <=7, cannot be 9.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=9 is time 9, with y9=9.\n\nCannot at time 8.\n\nThus minimal H=9, with y9=9 at time 9.\n\nActions: a1 to a8: U, and a9: S (for the last action).\n\nNow, in the occupation, with this timing:\n\nTime t (abs), y_t\n\nt=1: y=0, τ=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=1, τ=1, row1 not occ, safe\n\nt=3: y=2, τ=2, row2 not occ, safe\n\nt=4: y=3, τ=3, no occ, safe\n\nt=5: y=4, τ=4, no occ, safe\n\nt=6: y=5, τ=5, row5: occ at τ=1,2,7,8; τ=5 not occ, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, τ=6, no occ, safe\n\nt=8: y=7, τ=7, row7: occ at τ=1, not τ=7, safe\n\nt=9: y=8, τ=8, row8: occ at τ=1, not τ=8, safe\n\nThen at t=9, y=8, action a8:U to y9=9? No.\n\nIn the positions:\n\nAt time t=9, y9=8 (since after a8 at t=8, y9=8? Let's list times.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nt=1: y1=0\n\nAfter a1 at t=1: y2=1\n\nAfter a2 at t=2: y3=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a7 at t=7: y8=7\n\nAfter a8 at t=8: y9=8\n\nWe want y9=9? For H=9, we want y_{t1+H-1}=y9=9.\n\nBut here y9=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y9=9, we need after a8 at t=8, y9=9.\n\nBut from above, after a7 at t=7, y8=7, then a8:U, y9=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y9=9, we must have y8=8 or 9.\n\nIf y8=8, a8:U to y9=9\n\nOr y8=9, a8:S to y9=9 or D to 8.\n\nBut to reach y8=9, from y7=8 or 9, etc.\n\nEarliest: y8=8 at time 8, then a8:U to y9=9 at time 9.\n\nThen y9=9 at time 9.\n\ny8 cannot be 9 at time 8 because from y1=0, max y8=7.\n\ny1=0\n\ny2 <=1\n\ny3 <=2\n\n...\n\ny8 <=7\n\nSo y8 <=7, so at time 8, y8 <=7, cannot be 9.\n\nThus y9=9 is the earliest at time 9.\n\nWith actions a1 to a8: U, we get y9=9 at time 9.\n\nThen for H=9, actions include a9 at time 9.\n\nAt time 9, y9=9, we set a9=S, then y10=9.\n\nIn the sequence for H=9, actions a1 to a9.\n\na1 to a8: U, a9: S.\n\nNow positions:\n\nt=1: y1=0\n\nt=2: y2=1 (after a1 U)\n\nt=3: y3=2\n\nt=4: y4=3\n\nt=5: y5=4\n\nt=6: y6=5\n\nt=7: y7=6\n\nt=8: y8=7\n\nt=9: y9=8? After a8 at t=8, y9=8? No.\n\nAction at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nAt time t=1: y1=0, a1=U, then y2=1\n\nAt time t=2: y2=1, a2=U, y3=2\n\n...\n\nAt time t=8: y8=7, a8=U, y9=8\n\nThen at time t=9: y9=8, not 9.\n\nWe want y9=9.\n\nTo have y9=9, we need y8=8 or 9.\n\nBut y8=7 as above.\n\nSo with a1 to a8 U, y9=8 at time 9.\n\nNot 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nTo reach y9=9, we need one more up.\n\nFor example:\n\na1:U, y2=1\n\na2:U, y3=2\n\na3:U, y4=3\n\na4:U, y5=4\n\na5:U, y6=5\n\na6:U, y7=6\n\na7:U, y8=7\n\na8:U, y9=8\n\nThen to have y9=9, we need a9:U, but at time 9, y9=8, a9:U, y10=9 at time 10.\n\nThen y10=9 at time 10.\n\nFor y9=9, we need to be at 9 at time 9.\n\nBut from above, at time 9, y9=8 after a8.\n\ny9 is position at time 9.\n\nAfter a8 at time 8, y9 is set.\n\nTo have y9=9, we must have a8:U from y8=8 or a8:S from y8=9, etc.\n\nBut y8 at time 8.\n\nFrom start, y1=0, after 7 actions (a1 to a7), y8 <=7.\n\nSo y8 <=7, so at time 8, y8 <=7.\n\nThen a8:U, y9 <=8\n\nOr a8:S, y9=y8<=7\n\nOr a8:D, y9<=6\n\nSo y9 <=8, cannot be 9 at time 9.\n\nThus the earliest to be at y=9 is time 10, with y10=9.\n\nThen for H, we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{1 + H -1} =9\n\nSet 1 + H -1 =10, so H=10.\n\ny10=9 at time 10.\n\nThen actions a1 to a9: U, and a10: S or something.\n\nWith a1 to a9: U, we get y10=9 at time 10.\n\nThen for H=10, actions include a10 at time 10.\n\nAt time 10, y10=9, set a10=S.\n\nThen the sequence is a1 to a10.\n\nNow back to the occupation, as before, it is safe.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5 at τ=5, which is t=6, y=5, but we are at t=6, y=5, τ=5 (since τ=t-1), at τ=5, row 5 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nActions: all U from a1 to a9, and a10=S.\n\nBut a10 is at time 10.\n\nIn the output, we need to list for each turn.\n\nNow, but the problem is to avoid collisions, and in this path, no collision.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 6 at τ=0 and1.\n\nAt τ=0, t=1, we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt τ=1, t=2, y=1, not freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we move down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nThus minimal H=10 with the sequence.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nH=10\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1=1: a_{1} = U\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: a_{10} = S\n\nBut from above, a1 to a9 U, a10 S.\n\nIn terms of the action at each turn.\n\nSince we need to output for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=1, H=10, turns from 1 to 10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nAnd position at time 10 is (0,9) before action? At time 10, position y10=9, then action S.\n\nBut we reach (0,9) at time 10.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but we cannot with minimal time.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at time 10 with different actions, but this is fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, there is freeway 3 and 4 occupied at τ=11,12,13, but we are done before, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with the above actions.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nThe sequence should be in the box.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=1.\n\nWe need to output actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1=1+10-1=10.\n\nSo turns 1 to 10.\n\nActions: U for turns 1 to 9, S for turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 action is S, which is fine.\n\nSince at turn 10, we are at y=9, and we stay.\n\nIn the collision note, when moving to a new row, we are not on it until next turn, but in this case, no issue because we are not moving when on the row at critical times.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, we are on row 7, not moving to or from at that time in a way that causes issue, but the note says if we move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, we are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so we don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, since we are on y_T at turn T, and we care only about that row at that time, it should be fine.\n\nIn our path, for example, at τ=5, t=6, y=5, we are on row 5 at time t=6, and since not occupied, safe.\n\nNo move at that turn causing issue.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nThus the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 10. The sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. The car occupancy at each relative turn \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\) (where \\(T\\) is the absolute turn) is derived from the car states:\n\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 1): freeways 1, 2, 6 occupied.\n- At \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 2): freeways 5, 6, 7, 8 occupied.\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 3): freeway 5 occupied.\n- At \\(\\tau = 3\\) to \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turns 4 to 7): no freeways occupied.\n- At \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turn 8): freeway 5 occupied.\n- At \\(\\tau = 8\\) (turn 9): freeway 5 occupied.\n- At \\(\\tau = 9\\) (turn 10): no freeways occupied.\n\nThe player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 1 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), which is safe since \\(y = 0\\) has no cars. The goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 1 + 10 - 1 = 10\\)), where \\(y = 9\\) is also safe.\n\nA sequence that achieves this in 10 turns with no collisions is:\n- Always move up (U) from turn 1 to turn 9 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe position and safety at each turn:\n- Turn 1 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)): Start at \\(y = 0\\), safe. Action: U to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2.\n- Turn 2 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)): Position \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (only 5,6,7,8 occupied), safe. Action: U to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 3.\n- Turn 3 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)): Position \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (only freeway 5 occupied), safe. Action: U to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4.\n- Turn 4 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)): Position \\(y = 3\\). No freeways occupied, safe. Action: U to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5.\n- Turn 5 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)): Position \\(y = 4\\). No freeways occupied, safe. Action: U to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6.\n- Turn 6 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)): Position \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 5\\) (occupied at \\(\\tau=1,2,7,8\\)), safe. Action: U to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7.\n- Turn 7 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)): Position \\(y = 6\\). No freeways occupied, safe. Action: U to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8.\n- Turn 8 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)): Position \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 7\\) (only freeway 5 occupied), safe. Action: U to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9.\n- Turn 9 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)): Position \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 8\\) (only freeway 5 occupied), safe. Action: U to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10.\n- Turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)): Position \\(y = 9\\), safe. Action: S to remain at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 10 with no collisions, and \\(H = 10\\) is minimal because it takes at least 9 upward moves to go from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\), and the earliest arrival at \\(y = 9\\) is at turn 10 (after 9 actions from turn 1 to 9).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

Our goal is to get to (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, we note that the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The grid has rows 0 to 9, but row 0 and row 9 are safe (no cars) because cars are only on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nBut note: row 0 and row 9 are safe. However, the player starts at row 1 (freeway 1) and must end at row 9 (which is safe). The problem is to avoid the freeways 1-8 when a car is present at x=0 at the same turn.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at future turns. Since we start at turn 2, we are interested in turns t >= 2.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T (relative to turn t1=2, so T-2 is the time difference).\n- Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the initial span for right-moving is given as (head, tail) and then the update: \n  For right-moving: initial span is [τ, h] (which is from τ to h, but note that h is the head and τ the tail, so if moving right, the head is the front, so the car extends from τ to h, with h > τ). Then at turn T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the table: for freeway 1: (48,1,right,48) -> so head=48, tail=1, so the car is from 1 to 48? But then the update: at turn T, the car is at [1 + 48*(T-2), 48 + 48*(T-2)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (-40,-51,right,4) -> head=-40, tail=-51? Then the car is from -51 to -40? Then update: [ -51 + 4*(T-2), -40 + 4*(T-2) ].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in freeway1: τ=1, h=48? Then at T: [1+48*(T-2), 48+48*(T-2)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: has three cars: \n  (-36,-47,right,6): so τ=-47, h=-36 -> becomes [-47+6*(T-2), -36+6*(T-2)]\n  (0,-11,right,6): becomes [-11+6*(T-2), 0+6*(T-2)]\n  (36,25,right,6): wait, head=36, tail=25? But then the car would be from 25 to 36? But then the update: [25+6*(T-2), 36+6*(T-2)]? However, note that the problem says: \"head h, tail τ\" and then for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] so if τ=25 and h=36, then [25,36]. But in the data, it's written as (head, tail) so (36,25) -> head=36, tail=25? Then the span is [25,36]. Then update: [25+6*(T-2), 36+6*(T-2)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars: freeway7: (0,23,left,24) -> head=0, tail=23? But then for left-moving, the update: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] = [0 - 24*(T-2), 23 - 24*(T-2)].\n\nBut note: the span of the car must be interpreted as an interval. For left-moving, if head=0 and tail=23, then the car is from 0 to 23? But then moving left, the head is the front? Actually, the problem says: left-moving: span(t1)=[h, τ] and then becomes [h-s*(T-t1), τ-s*(T-t1)]. So for freeway7: [0,23] at turn2. Then at turn T: [0-24*(T-2), 23-24*(T-2)].\n\nNow, we are only concerned when the car's span covers x=0. So we need to check for each freeway and each car on that freeway, at a given turn T, if 0 is in the interval [L, R] (for left-moving: [h-s*(T-2), τ-s*(T-2)] and for right-moving: [τ+s*(T-2), h+s*(T-2)]).\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each car, the set of turns T (>=2) at which the car covers x=0. Then, the player must avoid being on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nWe start at turn2 at row1.\n\nWe need to get to row9. The minimal H would be at least the vertical distance: from row1 to row9, that's 8 steps up. But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions for turns starting at t1=2, then t1+1=3, etc., until we reach row9.\n\nLet me compute the dangerous turns for each freeway.\n\nFirst, note that the cars on each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, right, speed=48)\n  At turn T: [1+48*(T-2), 48+48*(T-2)]\n  We require 0 in [1+48*(T-2), 48+48*(T-2)]?\n  Solve: 1+48*(T-2) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-2)\n\n  Consider the left bound: 1+48*(T-2) <= 0 -> 48*(T-2) <= -1 -> T-2 <= -1/48 -> T<=2 - 1/48 -> T<2. So for T>=2, the left bound is at least 1. So 0 is never in the interval? Because the left bound is at least 1? \n  At T=2: [1+0, 48+0] = [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48].\n  So freeway1 is safe at all turns? \n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1? (48,1,right,48) -> same as above, safe.\n\nFreeway 3: (-40,-51,right,4)\n  Car: [τ, h] = [-51, -40] at turn2? But wait: the data says (head, tail) = (-40, -51). Then for right-moving: span = [τ, h] = [-51, -40] at turn2.\n  Update: at turn T: [-51+4*(T-2), -40+4*(T-2)]\n  We need: -51+4*(T-2) <= 0 <= -40+4*(T-2)\n\n  First inequality: -51+4*(T-2) <= 0 -> 4*(T-2) <= 51 -> T-2 <= 51/4 = 12.75 -> T <= 14.75 -> T<=14 (since integer)\n  Second inequality: 0 <= -40+4*(T-2) -> 40 <= 4*(T-2) -> 10 <= T-2 -> T>=12.\n\n  So T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\n  Thus freeway3: dangerous at turns 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? (-40,-51,right,4) -> same, dangerous at 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> span at turn2: [-47, -36]? \n  Update: [-47+6*(T-2), -36+6*(T-2)]\n  Condition: -47+6*(T-2) <= 0 <= -36+6*(T-2)\n\n  First: -47+6*(T-2) <=0 -> 6*(T-2)<=47 -> T-2<=47/6≈7.833 -> T<=9.833 -> T<=9\n  Second: 0<= -36+6*(T-2) -> 36<=6*(T-2) -> 6<=T-2 -> T>=8\n  So T in [8,9] -> T=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) -> span at turn2: [-11,0]? \n  Update: [-11+6*(T-2), 0+6*(T-2)] = [-11+6*(T-2), 6*(T-2)]\n  Condition: -11+6*(T-2) <=0 and 0<=6*(T-2)\n  The second: 0<=6*(T-2) -> T>=2 (which is always true for T>=2).\n  First: -11+6*(T-2)<=0 -> 6*(T-2)<=11 -> T-2<=11/6≈1.833 -> T<=3.833 -> T<=3.\n  So T=2,3.\n\nThird car: (36,25,right,6) -> wait, head=36, tail=25? Then span at turn2: [25,36]. \n  Update: [25+6*(T-2), 36+6*(T-2)]\n  Condition: 25+6*(T-2) <=0<=36+6*(T-2)\n  First: 25+6*(T-2)<=0 -> 6*(T-2)<=-25 -> T-2<= -25/6 ≈ -4.166 -> T<= negative -> no solution? \n  So never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, freeway5 is dangerous at:\n  From second car: T=2,3\n  From first car: T=8,9\n\nSo freeway5: dangerous at T=2,3,8,9.\n\nFreeway6: two cars.\n\nFirst: (56,45,right,4) -> head=56, tail=45? Then span at turn2: [45,56]. \n  Update: [45+4*(T-2),56+4*(T-2)]\n  Condition: 45+4*(T-2)<=0<=56+4*(T-2)\n  First: 45+4*(T-2)<=0 -> 4*(T-2)<=-45 -> T-2<=-45/4≈-11.25 -> T<= negative -> safe.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4) -> head=8, tail=-3? Then span at turn2: [-3,8]. \n  Update: [-3+4*(T-2), 8+4*(T-2)]\n  Condition: -3+4*(T-2)<=0<=8+4*(T-2)\n  The second part: 0<=8+4*(T-2) is always true for T>=2? (at T=2: 0<=8 -> true; T=3: 0<=12 -> true, etc.)\n  First: -3+4*(T-2)<=0 -> 4*(T-2)<=3 -> T-2<=3/4=0.75 -> T<=2.75 -> T=2.\n\n  So only at T=2.\n\nTherefore, freeway6: dangerous only at T=2.\n\nFreeway7: (0,23,left,24) -> left-moving. \n  At turn2: [h,τ] = [0,23]? Then update: [0-24*(T-2), 23-24*(T-2)]\n  Condition: 0-24*(T-2) <= 0 <= 23-24*(T-2)\n\n  First: 0-24*(T-2)<=0 -> -24*(T-2)<=0 -> 24*(T-2)>=0 -> T>=2 (always true).\n  Second: 0<=23-24*(T-2) -> 24*(T-2)<=23 -> T-2<=23/24≈0.958 -> T<=2.958 -> T=2.\n\n  So only at T=2.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? (0,23,left,24) -> same, dangerous at T=2.\n\nSummary of dangerous turns by freeway:\n\nFreeway1: safe at all turns (as we saw).\nFreeway2: safe at all turns (same as freeway1).\nFreeway3: dangerous at T=12,13,14.\nFreeway4: dangerous at T=12,13,14.\nFreeway5: dangerous at T=2,3,8,9.\nFreeway6: dangerous at T=2.\nFreeway7: dangerous at T=2.\nFreeway8: dangerous at T=2.\n\nWe start at turn2 at freeway1 (row1). But note: at turn2, freeway1 is safe (as we saw). However, freeway5,6,7,8 are dangerous at turn2? But we are not on them at turn2.\n\nOur path: we are at row1 at turn2. We are safe at turn2 on row1.\n\nWe need to plan moves. We want to get to row9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of steps (if no obstacles) is 8 steps (all U). But we have to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nLet me try to simulate:\n\nOption: Go straight up.\n\nAt turn2: row1 (safe) -> action U: then at turn3 we are at row2.\n\nBut at turn3, what about row2? Freeway2: safe at all turns? Yes. So row2 at turn3: safe.\n\nThen turn3: U -> row3 at turn4.\n\nFreeway3: dangerous at 12,13,14. At turn4: safe.\n\nThen turn4: U -> row4 at turn5: freeway4: dangerous at 12,13,14 -> safe at turn5.\n\nThen turn5: U -> row5 at turn6: freeway5: dangerous at 2,3,8,9. At turn6: safe? Because 6 not in {2,3,8,9}.\n\nThen turn6: U -> row6 at turn7: freeway6: dangerous only at 2 -> safe.\n\nThen turn7: U -> row7 at turn8: freeway7: dangerous at 2 -> safe.\n\nThen turn8: U -> row8 at turn9: freeway8: dangerous at 2 -> safe.\n\nThen turn9: U -> row9 at turn10. Goal.\n\nBut wait: at turn9, when we are on row8 at turn9? Actually, we are at row8 at turn9? Then we move to row9 at turn10? But we need to check the state at each turn.\n\nLet me break down:\n\nTurn2: at row1 (safe) -> action U -> next state: row2 at turn3.\n\nTurn3: at row2 (freeway2: safe) -> action U -> row3 at turn4.\n\nTurn4: at row3 (freeway3: safe at turn4) -> action U -> row4 at turn5.\n\nTurn5: at row4 (freeway4: safe at turn5) -> action U -> row5 at turn6.\n\nTurn6: at row5 (freeway5: dangerous at 2,3,8,9 -> but turn6 not in that set -> safe) -> action U -> row6 at turn7.\n\nTurn7: at row6 (freeway6: dangerous only at 2 -> safe) -> action U -> row7 at turn8.\n\nTurn8: at row7 (freeway7: dangerous at 2 -> safe at turn8) -> action U -> row8 at turn9.\n\nTurn9: at row8 (freeway8: dangerous at 2 -> safe at turn9) -> action U -> row9 at turn10.\n\nSo we reach row9 at turn10. But we started at turn2 at row1, so we took 8 moves (from turn2 to turn9: 8 actions) and at turn10 we are at row9.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for turns starting at t1=2. So we need actions for turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 (8 actions) to get to row9 at turn10.\n\nBut wait: we start at turn2 at row1. After 0 actions, we are at row1. Then after 1 action (at turn2) we move to row2 at turn3? Actually:\n\nAt the beginning of turn2, we are at row1. Then we choose an action for turn2. After that action, we update the position for the next turn.\n\nSo after the action at turn2, at turn3 we are at a new row.\n\nWe want to be at row9 at the beginning of which turn? Actually, the problem says: we start at turn t1=2 at (0,1). We do actions at turn t1, t1+1, ... until we are at (0,9) at the end of the sequence? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are for turn t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. And then after H actions, we are at the position at turn t1+H.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). But note that at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,1). Then we do an action at turn t1 (which is 2) and then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at a new row.\n\nSo to be at row9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have taken the last action at turn T-1 that moved us from row8 to row9? \n\nActually, after H actions, the turn is t1+H, and we are at row y_{t1+H}. We want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nIn the direct path: \n  Start: turn2, row1.\n  After action at turn2 (U): at turn3, row2.\n  After action at turn3 (U): at turn4, row3.\n  ...\n  After action at turn9 (U): at turn10, row9.\n\nSo we need H=8 actions: from turn2 to turn9 (8 actions) and at turn10 we are at row9.\n\nBut we must check that at every intermediate turn (when we are on a freeway) we are safe.\n\nWe did that above and it seemed safe.\n\nHowever, we must check freeway5 at turn6? We are at row5 at turn6: freeway5 dangerous at 2,3,8,9 -> turn6 is safe. Similarly, others.\n\nBut wait: at turn5, we are at row4? Freeway4 is dangerous at 12,13,14 -> turn5 safe.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway5 at turn8 and turn9? We are not on freeway5 at those turns? At turn8 we are at row7? And at turn9 we are at row8.\n\nSo the direct path of 8 consecutive U's seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn6: we are at row5 at turn6. The dangerous turns for freeway5 are 2,3,8,9. So turn6 is safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway5 at turn8: we are not on freeway5 at turn8? We are at row7 at turn8? So we avoid.\n\nSimilarly, at turn9: we are at row8? So freeway5 at turn9: we are not on it.\n\nBut note: we are at row5 at turn6. Then we move up to row6 at turn7. Then row7 at turn8, row8 at turn9, row9 at turn10.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nBut is there a faster way? We start at row1. The goal is row9. The minimal number of moves is 8. So we cannot do it in less than 8.\n\nBut what if we go down? That would take more steps. So the minimal H is 8.\n\nSo the sequence: 8 U's.\n\nBut wait: we must check the starting point: at turn2, we are at row1. Then we take U at turn2: which moves to row2 at turn3. But at turn2, we are at row1: is row1 safe at turn2? \n\nFreeway1: at turn2, the car is at [1,48] (from the update: at T=2, [1+0,48+0]) and 0 is not in [1,48]? So safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5? We are not on freeway5 at turn2.\n\nSo the first action: U at turn2.\n\nThen at turn3: row2. Freeway2: same as freeway1? The car on freeway2: (48,1,right,48) -> at turn3: [1+48*(1),48+48*1] = [49,96] -> 0 not in there. Safe.\n\nThen U at turn3: to row3 at turn4.\n\nFreeway3: at turn4: car is [ -51+4*(4-2), -40+4*(4-2) ] = [-51+8, -40+8] = [-43,-32] -> 0 not in [-43,-32]. Safe.\n\nThen U at turn4: to row4 at turn5.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? same car? so same as above: at turn5: [-51+4*(5-2), -40+4*(5-2)] = [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn5: to row5 at turn6.\n\nFreeway5: at turn6: we have three cars.\n\nFirst car: [-47+6*(6-2), -36+6*(6-2)] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSecond car: [-11+6*(6-2), 0+6*(6-2)] = [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> 0 not in there.\n\nThird car: [25+6*(6-2),36+6*(6-2)] = [25+24,36+24] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen U at turn6: to row6 at turn7.\n\nFreeway6: at turn7: \n  First car: (56,45,right,4) -> at turn7: [45+4*(7-2),56+4*(7-2)] = [45+20,56+20] = [65,76] -> safe.\n  Second car: (8,-3,right,4) -> at turn7: [-3+4*(7-2),8+4*(7-2)] = [-3+20,8+20] = [17,28] -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn7: to row7 at turn8.\n\nFreeway7: left-moving car: (0,23,left,24) -> at turn8: [0-24*(8-2), 23-24*(8-2)] = [0-144, 23-144] = [-144,-121] -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn8: to row8 at turn9.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? at turn9: [0-24*(9-2), 23-24*(9-2)] = [0-168,23-168] = [-168,-145] -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn9: to row9 at turn10.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, and the actions are all U.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". H is the number of actions? And we have 8 actions.\n\nThe answer format: we list the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until we have done H actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note: after the last action (at turn9), we are at row9 at turn10.\n\nIs there a way to get to row9 earlier? For example, at turn10 we are at row9. But can we be at row9 at turn9? \n\nTo be at row9 at turn9, we must have been at row8 at turn8 and then moved up at turn8? Then at turn9 we would be at row9.\n\nBut we started at row1 at turn2. So we need to go from row1 to row9 in 7 moves? That would require 8 steps? \n\nFrom turn2 (row1) to turn9 (row9): that is 7 turns of actions? Because:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn2: row1.\nAfter 1 action: turn3: row2.\n...\nAfter 7 actions: turn9: row8? Then we need one more to get to row9? \n\nWait: if we do 7 actions, we are at turn9 at row? We started at row1 at turn2. After k actions, at turn2+k, we are at row1 + (number of U) - (number of D). To get to row9, we need 8 net U moves. So 7 actions: we can do 7 U and 0 D: then row1+7=row8 at turn9.\n\nThen we need an 8th action at turn9: U to get to row9 at turn10.\n\nSo we cannot get to row9 at turn9. The earliest we can be at row9 is turn10, which requires 8 actions (from turn2 to turn9).\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nBut what if we do some downs? Then we would take more than 8 moves? So it would be worse.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 consecutive U's.\n\nBut let me check if at any turn we might be forced to wait? For example, at turn8 we are going to row5? But we are not. In our path, at turn8 we are at row7. But freeway5 is dangerous at turn8? But we are not on freeway5 at turn8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn9 we are at row8, and freeway5 is dangerous at turn9? But we are on freeway8 at turn9, not freeway5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 at turn8? If we were on freeway5 at turn8, we would be in danger. But we are at row7 at turn8.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to 7? Because H=8.\n\nSo:\na_{t1+0} = a_2 = U\na_{t1+1} = a_3 = U\n...\na_{t1+7} = a_9 = U\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the answer format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note: after the last action at turn9, we are at row9 at turn10. And that is the goal.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do at turn10.\n\nBut the problem does not specify that we must be at (0,9) at a particular turn, just minimal H (number of actions). And we use 8 actions.\n\nIs there a path that uses 8 actions but gets to row9 earlier? No, because we start at row1 and need 8 moves up.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nAt turn2: S (stay) and then go up? But that would take 9 actions? So worse.\n\nOr at turn2: D? Then we go to row0 at turn3? Then we have to come back up: that would be at least 1 down and then 9 ups? total 10 actions? worse.\n\nSo the direct path is minimal.\n\nBut one more check: what if we do an extra move? No, minimal is 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the 8 U's.\n\nBut wait: we must check the car on freeway5 at turn3? Because if we were on freeway5 at turn3, we would crash. But in our path, we are at row2 at turn3, then row3 at turn4, row4 at turn5, row5 at turn6. We are not on freeway5 at turn3 (we are on freeway2 at turn3).\n\nSimilarly, at turn2 we are on freeway1, not freeway5.\n\nSo we avoid all the dangerous times.\n\nBut note: freeway5 is dangerous at turn2 and turn3. At turn2, we are at row1 (freeway1) and at turn3 we are at row2 (freeway2). So we are not on freeway5 at turn2 or turn3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 and freeway7 and freeway8 are dangerous at turn2: but we are at row1 (freeway1) at turn2, so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nYes.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) is 8. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 2, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\). Moving up (U) avoids collisions, as freeway 1 is safe at turn 2 (the car spans [1, 48], and 0 is not in this interval).\n- At turn 3, the player is at \\((0, 2)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 2 is safe at turn 3 (the car spans [49, 96], and 0 is not in this interval).\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 3 is safe at turn 4 (the car spans [-43, -32], and 0 is not in this interval).\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 5 (the car spans [-39, -28], and 0 is not in this interval).\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 5 is safe at turn 6 (the cars span [-23, -12], [13, 24], and [49, 60], and 0 is not in any of these intervals).\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 6 is safe at turn 7 (the cars span [65, 76] and [17, 28], and 0 is not in these intervals).\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 7 is safe at turn 8 (the car spans [-144, -121], and 0 is not in this interval).\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 8)\\). Moving up (U) is safe, as freeway 8 is safe at turn 9 (the car spans [-168, -145], and 0 is not in this interval).\n\nAfter these 8 actions, at turn 10, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), which is the goal position. No shorter sequence is possible, as moving from row 1 to row 9 requires at least 8 upward moves. The path avoids all dangerous freeways at dangerous turns, as verified by the car span computations for each freeway and turn.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 2: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 3 and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: \n- The player updates at the same time as the cars. \n- Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn T, the car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at that exact turn.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from freeway y to freeway y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on freeway y. So for the next freeway y', we only care about the car on freeway y' at the next turn (T+1) if we are going to be on y' at T+1? Actually, we are on freeway y_T at turn T, and then at turn T+1 we are on freeway y_{T+1}. So for collision at turn T, we only check the car on freeway k = y_T at turn T. When we are moving, at the moment of the move (turn T), we are still on the starting freeway.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that at each turn T (starting from t1=3) we are not colliding with any car on the freeway we are currently on (which is y_T) at that turn T.\n\nThe car movement is deterministic. For a car on freeway i at any turn, we can compute its span at turn T (relative to turn t1=3).\n\nWe are at turn 3. We need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) and each car on that freeway, the span at turn T (for T>=3).\n\nLet me denote T0 = t1 = 3. Then at a future turn T (>=3), the car's head and tail are updated by:\n\nFor left-moving (d = 'left'):\n   head(T) = h - s*(T - T0)\n   tail(T) = tau - s*(T - T0)\n\nBut note: the initial state at T0=3 is given as (h, tau, d, s). However, the representation for left and right is different:\n\nFor left-moving (d='left'):\n   The car moves to the left, so the entire segment moves left. The span at T0 is [h, tau] (but note that in the example for left-moving, they write: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-T0), tau - s*(T-T0)]. This implies that at T0, the car's head is at h and tail at tau, and then it moves left.\n\nBut wait: for a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the problem states:\n   Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, in the table, for freeway 7 and 8 we have left-moving cars with initial span at T0=3: \n   Freeway 7: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n   So at T0=3, the span is [-24, -1]? But that would be from -24 to -1, which is a length of 23? However, the car length is |h-tau|+1? Actually, the problem does not specify which is head and tail in terms of left/right. But note the representation for right-moving is different:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1)= [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (with tau < h). For left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] but note that in the example for left-moving, they write [h, tau] and then subtract s*(T-t1) from both. But if the car is moving left, then the entire segment moves to the left. \n\nIn the given data, for freeway 7: (h=-24, tau=-1, d='left', s=24). Since it's left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] = [-24, -1]. But note: -24 is less than -1? So that would be from -24 to -1? That's a segment of 24 units? Actually, the problem doesn't require the head to be the front. It's given as (head, tail). But the update is symmetric: both endpoints are updated by the same displacement.\n\nSo we don't need to worry about the ordering? We just compute the endpoints at time T.\n\nFor a left-moving car at freeway i, at turn T:\n   head(T) = h - s*(T-3)\n   tail(T) = tau - s*(T-3)\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n   head(T) = h + s*(T-3)\n   tail(T) = tau + s*(T-3)\n\nBut note: the car's span at time T is the interval [min(head(T), tail(T)), max(head(T), tail(T))]? Actually, the problem states that for left-moving, the span becomes [h - s*(T-3), tau - s*(T-3)] and similarly for right-moving. And then we check if 0 is in the interval? So we must consider the interval as [min, max] regardless of the order? But the update might make the endpoints swap? Actually, the problem says \"the car span becomes [x, y]\" and then we check if 0 is in that span. I think we should interpret the span as the closed interval between the two endpoints.\n\nSo to check collision: at turn T, for the freeway i that the player is on (y_T = i), we check every car on freeway i: if 0 is in the interval [min(head(T), tail(T)), max(head(T), tail(T))] then collision.\n\nBut note: the given data for freeway 5 has three cars. So we have to check every car on the freeway we are on.\n\nNow, our starting position: at turn 3, we are at (0,2). So we are on freeway 2 at turn 3? But wait: the freeways are from 1 to 8 (vertical axis). The player is at (0,2) meaning y=2. So freeway 2.\n\nBut the car state for freeway 2 is given as: (96,49,right,48). So we must check at turn 3: is 0 in the span of the car on freeway 2?\n\nFor freeway 2, at T0=3 (current turn):\n   right-moving: so initial span at T0 is [tau, h]? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)= [tau, h]. However, the data is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). How do we interpret?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n   For car k: (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd then the update for right-moving: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the initial state at t1 is represented as [tau, h] for right-moving? But the data gives (h, tau, ...). So for right-moving, the head is h and the tail is tau? But the update uses the tail and head as given? \n\nActually, the problem says: \n   Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\"\n\nSo the given data for a right-moving car: the tail is the leftmost and the head is the rightmost? So the span is [tail, head]. Therefore, for freeway 2: \n   tail = 49? head = 96? But wait, the data is: (96,49,right,48). So the first number is head, the second is tail? Then for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [49,96]? But 49 to 96? That's a segment of length 48? And the car moves right: so at time T, the span is [49 + 48*(T-3), 96 + 48*(T-3)].\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \n   Right-moving: \"Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo we use the tail and head as given? But the data gives (h, tau) = (96,49). So we have:\n   tau = 49, h = 96? Then at T0=3: [49, 96]. Then at T: [49+48*(T-3), 96+48*(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n   The problem says: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nSo for freeway 7: (h=-24, tau=-1, left, 24) -> at T0=3: [-24, -1]? Then at T: [-24 -24*(T-3), -1-24*(T-3)].\n\nNow, we are at turn 3 at freeway 2. We must check if at turn 3, the car on freeway 2 (which is the only car) has a span that includes 0.\n\nFreeway 2: \n   At T=3: [49, 96] -> 0 is not in [49,96] -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are at (0,2) at turn 3. The freeway 2 is at y=2? Yes. So we are safe at turn 3.\n\nNow we plan the next moves.\n\nThe goal is to get to y=9. We start at y=2. We can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). But we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe need the minimal number of turns. The minimal vertical moves: from 2 to 9 is 7 moves. So if we go up 7 times, we can get there in 7 turns. But we have to avoid the cars on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 (since we are going from 2 to 9, we will traverse freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 and then 9 is the goal, and note that the goal is at (0,9) and there are no cars on freeway 9? Actually, the cars are only on freeways 1 to 8. So freeway 9 has no car. But we have to be cautious: we are on freeway 9 at the final turn, and we don't care about freeway 9 because there are no cars. So the only danger is during the journey on freeways 3 to 8.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 3 at freeway 2. Then at turn 4, we can be at freeway 2 (if we stay) or 3 (if we go up) or 1 (if we go down). But we are going upward, so we will mostly go up.\n\nWe must simulate each turn and check for collisions on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe want the minimal H. Since we can only move one step per turn, the minimal H is at least 7 (from 2 to 9). But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid a collision, so H might be more than 7.\n\nWe'll try to go up as fast as possible and see if we can avoid collisions.\n\nPlan: \n   We are at turn 3: y=2 -> safe (as above).\n\nTurn 4: we choose an action. We want to go up. So let's try U: then at turn 4, we are at y=3.\n\nAt turn 4, we are on freeway 3. We must check the car on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: only one car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> right-moving.\n\nAt turn T (relative to T0=3): \n   tau = -47, h = -36? But wait: the data is (h, tau) = (-36,-47). For right-moving, the span at T is:\n   [tau + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] = [-47 + 4*(T-3), -36 + 4*(T-3)]\n\nAt T=4: \n   T-3=1 -> [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43, -32] -> 0 not in this interval -> safe.\n\nTurn 5: we go U again: to y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> same as above? But wait, the data for freeway 4 is the same: (-36,-47,right,4). So at T=5 (T-3=2):\n   [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39, -28] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn 6: U -> y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: \n   car1: (-30,-41,right,6)\n   car2: (6,-5,right,6)   -> wait, (6,-5): that means head=6, tail=-5? Then for right-moving: [tail, head] = [-5,6]? But the problem says: for right-moving the initial span is [tau, h]. So tau=-5, h=6? \n   car3: (42,31,right,6) -> [31,42]?\n\nBut note: the representation: the data gives (head, tail). So for right-moving, we use tail and head? Actually, the problem says: the update for right-moving uses tail and head. But the data gives (head, tail) for each car? \n\nWait, the table says: \n   | 5 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6) |\n\nSo for the second car: (6, -5, right, 6). That means head=6, tail=-5? Then the initial span (at T0=3) is [tail, head] = [-5,6]? Because for right-moving: [tau, h] = [-5,6]. \n\nBut note: the update rule: \n   Right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at T0=3, we have [tau, h] = [-5,6]. Then at T=6 (T-3=3):\n   [-5+6*3, 6+6*3] = [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut wait, we are at turn 6? Actually, we are moving step by step: at turn 6 we are at freeway 5.\n\nBut note: the car moves continuously? Actually, at turn 6 (T=6), we have T-3=3, so:\n   car1: [tail1 + 6*3, head1 + 6*3] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in.\n   car2: [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n   car3: [31+18, 42+18] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn 7: U -> y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4). \n\nBut wait: (60,49,right,4): then the initial span at T0=3 is [49,60]? (because [tail, head] = [49,60])? \n   Actually, the data: first car: (60,49,...) -> head=60, tail=49? Then [49,60]. \n   Second car: (12,1,right,4) -> [1,12].\n\nAt T=7 (T-3=4):\n   car1: [49+4*4, 60+4*4] = [49+16,60+16] = [65,76] -> 0 not in.\n   car2: [1+16, 12+16] = [17,28] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 8: U -> y=7.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-24,-1,left,24). Left-moving: \n   At T0=3: [h, tau] = [-24,-1]? Then at T=8 (T-3=5):\n   head(T) = -24 - 24*5 = -24-120 = -144\n   tail(T) = -1 - 24*5 = -1-120 = -121\n   So the span is [-144, -121] (if we take min and max) -> 0 not in.\n\nBut note: the update: [h - s*(T-3), tau - s*(T-3)] = [-24-24*5, -1-24*5] = [-144, -121] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nTurn 9: U -> y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-24,-1,left,24). Same as freeway 7? \n   At T=9 (T-3=6):\n   [-24-24*6, -1-24*6] = [-24-144, -1-144] = [-168, -145] -> safe.\n\nTurn 10: U -> y=9. We are at the goal. And freeway 9 has no car, so safe.\n\nSo in 7 moves (from turn 3 to turn 10? Let's count the turns:\n\nWe are at turn 3: we start at y=2.\nAfter 7 actions (each U) we would be at:\n   turn 4: y=3\n   turn 5: y=4\n   turn 6: y=5\n   turn 7: y=6\n   turn 8: y=7\n   turn 9: y=8\n   turn 10: y=9\n\nSo H = 7 turns? But note: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nWe are starting at turn t1=3. We take H actions: at turn 3 we take the first action? But wait: the player update is: at turn t, we do an action a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}. \n\nBut the problem says: \n   We are at turn t1 (3) at (0,2). Then we choose actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t is determined by a_t.\n\nSo at turn t (starting at t1=3), we are at y_t. We choose a_t, then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, we start at turn 3 at y=2. We take H actions: a_3, a_4, ..., a_{3+H-1}. Then at turn 3+H, we are at y_{3+H} = 9.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we can get to y=9 at turn 3+H.\n\nIn our plan, we take 7 actions (all U) from turn 3 to turn 9 (inclusive). Then at turn 10, we are at y=9.\n\nSo H = 7? Then the actions are for turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we have to check the safety at each turn when we are on a freeway. Note: at the turn when we are at freeway 9 (turn 10) we don't need to check because there are no cars on freeway 9? Actually, we are at freeway 9 at turn 10, and we don't have a car on freeway 9, so it's safe. But the problem says: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T. Since there are no cars on freeway 9, we are safe.\n\nBut we must also check that at turn 10, we are at freeway 9? That is the goal.\n\nNow, let's verify the entire sequence:\n\nTurn 3: we are at y=2 -> safe (as above). Then we choose a_3 = U -> so at turn 4 we are at y=3.\n\nTurn 4: we are at y=3 -> freeway 3: car at T=4: [-43,-32] -> safe. Then we choose a_4=U -> turn 5: y=4.\n\nTurn 5: y=4 -> freeway 4: car at T=5: [-39,-28] -> safe. a_5=U -> turn 6: y=5.\n\nTurn 6: y=5 -> freeway 5: \n   car1: [-41+6*3, -30+6*3] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n   car2: [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24] -> safe\n   car3: [31+18,42+18] = [49,60] -> safe\n   Then a_6=U -> turn 7: y=6.\n\nTurn 7: y=6 -> freeway 6:\n   car1: [49+4*4,60+4*4] = [65,76] -> safe\n   car2: [1+4*4,12+4*4] = [17,28] -> safe\n   a_7=U -> turn 8: y=7.\n\nTurn 8: y=7 -> freeway 7: car at T=8: [-24-24*5, -1-24*5] = [-144,-121] -> safe. a_8=U -> turn 9: y=8.\n\nTurn 9: y=8 -> freeway 8: car at T=9: [-24-24*6, -1-24*6] = [-168,-145] -> safe. a_9=U -> turn 10: y=9.\n\nAt turn 10, we are at (0,9) -> goal achieved.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we are at (0,9). So we are done at turn 10.\n\nHowever, the sequence of actions is for turns 3 to 9 (7 actions). So H=7.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". \n\nWe start at t1=3, and we take actions at times: \n   t1+0 = 3, \n   t1+1 = 4, \n   ... \n   t1+6 = 9.\n\nSo 7 actions. Then at turn 10 (which is t1+7) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nActually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: after H actions (starting at turn t1), we are at turn t1+H. However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me check: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the exact turn when we are at (0,9). But the update: \n   We start at turn t1 at (0, y_{t1}). \n   Then we apply action a_{t1} at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}.\n   Then we apply a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, ... until we apply the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H, we need to have y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal number of actions. In our case, we have 7 actions: from turn 3 to turn 9, and then at turn 10 (which is 3+7) we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? It is the number of actions? The problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\". And then the actions are for H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1). \n\nBut note: the problem says \"turns\" in H. And we are taking actions over H turns? \n\nIn the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo H is the number of actions. And then we have H actions, and we reach at turn t1+H.\n\nIn our case, we need H=7.\n\nBut is there a problem? Let me check freeway 5 again at turn 6? Actually, we passed freeway 5 at turn 6 (when we are at y=5) and we computed the cars at T=6 (which is turn 6) and found safe.\n\nBut wait: one of the cars on freeway 5: (6,-5,right,6). At turn 3: the car is at [ -5, 6]? Then at turn 4: [-5+6, 6+6] = [1,12] -> which includes 0? But we are not on freeway 5 at turn 4. \n\nAt turn 5: the car would be at [ -5+6*2, 6+6*2] = [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18] -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 6: [13,24] as above.\n\nBut note: at turn 4, if we were on freeway 5, we would be in danger? But we are not. We are on freeway 5 only at turn 6.\n\nAnother car on freeway 5: (6,-5,right,6) at turn 3: [-5,6] -> at turn 3, if we were on freeway 5 we would be in danger? But we are at freeway 2 at turn 3.\n\nSo it's okay.\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway 5: (6,-5,right,6) at turn 4: [1,12] -> includes 0. So if we were on freeway 5 at turn 4, we would crash. But we are on freeway 5 only at turn 6, when the car is at [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, the other cars: the first car: (-30,-41,right,6) at turn 4: [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24] -> safe? 0 not in. At turn 5: [-29,-18], etc.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut note: we have freeway 8: at turn 9 we are at freeway 8. The car on freeway 8: left-moving: same as freeway 7? \n   At turn 9: [-24-24*6, -1-24*6] = [-168, -145] -> safe.\n\nBut what if we had been on freeway 8 earlier? For example, if we had moved faster? But we are going one step per turn.\n\nIs there a possibility to do it in less than 7? No, because we are at y=2 and need to get to y=9: 7 steps up.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up twice and then wait? That would take more than 7. So 7 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we are to provide actions for turns starting at t1. We are at turn 3 and we start by taking an action at turn 3.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut wait: after the last action at turn 9, at turn 10 we are at y=9. So we have taken 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". And we do reach at turn 10.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require an action at the turn when we are at the goal? Because we are already there? Actually, we take actions until the turn before we arrive? But in this update, we take an action at turn 9 and then at turn 10 we are at 9.\n\nSo the sequence is for 7 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 7 and 8 at the turns we are there.\n\nFreeway 7: we are there at turn 8 (T=8). \n   The car: left-moving: initial at T0=3: h=-24, tau=-1.\n   At T=8: head = -24 - 24*(8-3) = -24 - 24*5 = -24-120 = -144\n   tail = -1 - 24*5 = -121\n   So the span is from -144 to -121 -> 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 8: at turn 9 (T=9):\n   same car: h=-24, tau=-1.\n   At T=9: head = -24 -24*(9-3)= -24-24*6 = -24-144=-168\n   tail = -1-144 = -145\n   -> 0 not in.\n\nBut wait, the freeway 8 car is the same as freeway 7? Actually, the table says:\n   freeway 7: (-24,-1,left,24)\n   freeway 8: (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nSo they are identical? Then the same calculation.\n\nHowever, note: at turn 3, the car on freeway 7 is at [-24,-1] and on freeway 8 at [-24,-1]? Then at turn 4, freeway 7 car: [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48,-25] -> 0 not in. But we are not on freeway 7 until turn 8.\n\nSo everything is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway 5 at turn 6? One of the cars: (6,-5,right,6) at turn 3: [-5,6] -> at turn 3, 0 is in [-5,6]? So if we were at freeway 5 at turn 3, we would crash. But we are not.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 4: [1,12] -> 0 is in [1,12]? So if we were at freeway 5 at turn 4, we crash. But we are at freeway 5 only at turn 6.\n\nBut note: we are moving from freeway 4 to freeway 5 at turn 6? Actually, at turn 5 we are at freeway 4, then we move up at turn 5 (action a_5=U) so at turn 6 we are at freeway 5. So we are at freeway 5 only at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6: \n   car2: (6,-5,right,6) -> [ -5+6*(6-3), 6+6*(6-3) ] = [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 6? \n   The second car: (12,1,right,4) -> at turn 3: [1,12] -> 0 not in? But 0 is not in [1,12]? Because [1,12] does not include 0? So at turn 3, if we were on freeway 6, we would be safe? \n   But at turn 4: [1+4,12+4] = [5,16] -> safe.\n   At turn 5: [9,20] -> safe.\n   At turn 6: [13,24] -> safe.\n   At turn 7: [17,28] -> safe.\n\nWe are on freeway 6 at turn 7: [17,28] -> safe.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut wait: we are at turn 3, and we take an action U at turn 3 to go to y=3 at turn 4. Then at turn 4 we take U to go to y=4 at turn 5, etc., until at turn 9 we take U to go to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThis is 7 actions. And we reach (0,9) at turn 10.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and we have H=7? But note: we are using 7 actions over 7 turns (from turn 3 to turn 9). Then we have spent 7 turns to take the actions, and then we are at the goal at the next turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" meaning the number of turns we need to take actions? And then the goal is reached at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nYes. So H=7.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider the starting turn as the first turn? Then we need 7 additional turns? But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the actions are for H turns starting at t1.\n\nIn the answer format, we write H actions.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut to be absolutely safe, let me check if we can do it in 6? Then we would have to go from 2 to 9 in 6 moves: that means we must move up 7 steps in 6 moves? Impossible because each move can only change by at most 1. So 7 moves are the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 3, move up (U) to position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 10.\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions with all cars on freeways 1 to 8 at each turn, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 3 (y=2)**: Car on freeway 2 at turn 3 has span \\([49, 96]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 4 (y=3)**: Car on freeway 3 at turn 4 has span \\([-43, -32]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 5 (y=4)**: Car on freeway 4 at turn 5 has span \\([-39, -28]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 6 (y=5)**: Cars on freeway 5 at turn 6:\n  - Car 1: \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 3: \\([49, 60]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 7 (y=6)**: Cars on freeway 6 at turn 7:\n  - Car 1: \\([65, 76]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: \\([17, 28]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 8 (y=7)**: Car on freeway 7 at turn 8 has span \\([-144, -121]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 9 (y=8)**: Car on freeway 8 at turn 9 has span \\([-168, -145]\\), 0 not in span → safe.\n\nAt turn 10, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), and since there are no cars on freeway 9, it is safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t1 = 4. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, given its position at turn t1, I need to compute where it is at future turns.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=4.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed 48. Since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48] at t=4. As time increases, for right-moving cars, the span moves to the right: at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut collision only matters when the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, note the important point: when the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. Specifically: if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and they choose to move to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, they are still on y_T for collision purposes, and at turn T+1, they are on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThat means at the turn when you move, you are only vulnerable to cars on your current row, not the row you're moving to.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at t=4.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and we start at y=3, we need to move up. Moving down might be possible but probably inefficient since we need to go up to 9.\n\nMinimal turns: since we need to go from y=3 to y=9, that's a difference of 6, so at least 6 moves up. But we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut with collisions, we might need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements for each freeway at future turns relative to t1=4.\n\nSet τ = T - 4, so at time T, τ is the number of turns after t1.\n\nFor a car, at turn T = t1 + τ, the span depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s τ, τ - s τ]? From the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, direction is left, so at t1, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, and since left-moving, it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving, span [τ, h] moves right.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48] because tail is -95, head is -48? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for car k, (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nThen for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, so for right, head is larger number, tail smaller.\n\nSimilarly for left: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" so h is head, τ is tail, and for left-moving, head is larger? No.\n\nIn left-moving example: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, and span is [h, τ], with h and τ, but if it's moving left, the head should be on the right, so h > τ, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right: Span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, and both increase with time.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48] since τ = -95, h = -48? But -95 < -48, so [ -95, -48 ].\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [ τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1) ] = [ -95 + 48(T-4), -48 + 48(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 7: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-48, -25]? But -48 < -25, so if h = -48, τ = -25, and since left-moving, head should be larger? Contradiction.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for left-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIf h and τ are positions, and it's moving left, we expect the span to shift left, so positions decrease.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 7: head h=-48, tail τ=-25, direction left.\n\n-48 is left of -25? On a number line, smaller number is left, larger is right.\n\nSo position x, smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nFor a car moving left, it should have its head on the right, so head position larger than tail position.\n\nBut here, for freeway 7, h = -48, τ = -25, and -48 < -25, so if -48 is head and -25 is tail, that means head is left of tail, which is weird for a car.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are labeled based on direction.\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, head is the front when moving right, so for right, head has larger x.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so head has smaller x.\n\nIn freeway 7: (-48, -25, left, 24), direction left, so head is at -48, tail at -25, and since it's moving left, the head at -48 is to the left, tail at -25 to the right, so the car is from x=-25 to x=-48? But -25 to -48, that's from right to left, so the span should be from min to max.\n\nI think it's better to think of the span as an interval.\n\nFor any car, the span at t1 is from min to max position.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nFor a car, at t1, the positions are given, and we can find the span.\n\nThen for future, based on direction, the span shifts.\n\nFor right-moving car: at t1, span [x_min, x_max], then at T, [x_min + s(T-t1), x_max + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, [x_min, x_max], then at T, [x_min - s(T-t1), x_max - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the given data, for each car, the (head, tail) define the endpoints, and we need to interpret min and max based on that.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define for each car the left and right endpoints at t1.\n\nFor a car (h, τ, d, s):\n\n- If d = right, then at t1, left end is τ, right end is h, since for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so x_left = τ, x_right = h.\n\n- If d = left, then at t1, left end is h, right end is τ, because head is left, tail is right.\n\nThen at turn T:\n\n- If d = right, x_left(T) = τ + s(T-t1), x_right(T) = h + s(T-t1)\n\n- If d = left, x_left(T) = h - s(T-t1), x_right(T) = τ - s(T-t1)\n\nThen span at T is [x_left(T), x_right(T)], and collision if y_player = k and 0 in [x_left(T), x_right(T)] for that car on freeway k.\n\nAlso, multiple cars on a freeway, so if any car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nNow, player at turn T is on y_T, and we need to ensure that for each turn, when on a freeway, no car on that freeway has 0 in span.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there. y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top, both safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3, which is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3, which has cars.\n\ny=3 is row 3, which is freeway for cars.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway with their positions at t1=4.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nd=right, so x_left(t1) = τ = -95, x_right(t1) = h = -48\n\nAt T, x_left(T) = -95 + 48(T-4)\n\nx_right(T) = -48 + 48(T-4)\n\n0 in span if x_left(T) <= 0 <= x_right(T)\n\nSince the car is moving right, at some point it will cross x=0.\n\nFind when x_left(T) <= 0 <= x_right(T)\n\n-95 + 48(T-4) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(T-4)\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48(T-4) <= 0 => 48(T-4) <= 95 => T-4 <= 95/48 = 1.979... so T-4 <= 1 since T integer? T is turn number, integer.\n\nT-4 <= floor(95/48) = 1, since 48*1=48 <95, 48*2=96>95.\n\n-95 + 48(τ) <= 0 where τ=T-4\n\n48τ <= 95, τ <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so τ <=1 since τ integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 48τ => 48τ >=48 => τ >=1\n\nAlso from left: -95 +48τ <=0 => τ <= 95/48 ≈1.979, so τ <=1\n\nFrom right: 0 <= -48 +48τ => 48τ >=48 => τ >=1\n\nSo for τ=1, x_left(1) = -95 +48(1) = -47? τ=T-4, at τ=0, T=4, x_left= -95, x_right=-48\n\nAt τ=1, T=5, x_left= -95 +48 = -47, x_right= -48 +48 =0\n\nSo at T=5, x_left= -47, x_right=0, so 0 <= x_right, and x_left <=0? -47 <=0 and 0<=0, so 0 is included, since span is inclusive I assume.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, T=6, x_left= -95+96=1, x_right=0+48=48? x_right(T)= -48 +48τ\n\nAt τ=2, x_left= -95 +96 =1, x_right= -48 +96=48, so [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=0, T=4, [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=5, τ=1, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nNow, freeway 2: similar, (-48, -95, right, 48), same as freeway 1, so same thing, collision at T=5 only.\n\nFreeway 3: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nd=right, so x_left(t1) = τ = -43, x_right(t1) = h = -32\n\nAt T, x_left(T) = -43 + 4(T-4)\n\nx_right(T) = -32 + 4(T-4)\n\n0 in span if -43 +4τ <=0 <= -32 +4τ, τ=T-4\n\nLeft: -43 +4τ <=0 => 4τ <=43 => τ <= 43/4 = 10.75, so τ <=10\n\nRight: 0 <= -32 +4τ => 4τ >=32 => τ >=8\n\nSo for τ from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nτ=8: x_left= -43 +32 = -11, x_right= -32 +32=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nτ=9: x_left= -43+36= -7, x_right= -32+36=4, -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nτ=10: x_left= -43+40= -3, x_right= -32+40=8, -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nτ=11: x_left= -43+44=1, x_right= -32+44=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T=4+8=12, T=13, T=14? T=t1+τ=4+τ\n\nt1=4, so T=12,13,14 for freeway 3.\n\nT=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (-32, -43, right, 4), same as freeway 3, so collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-24, -35, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nd=right, x_left(t1)=τ= -35, x_right=h= -24\n\nAt T, x_left(T)= -35 +6(T-4)\n\nx_right(T)= -24 +6(T-4)\n\n0 in span: -35+6τ <=0 <= -24+6τ, τ=T-4\n\nLeft: -35+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=35 => τ <= 35/6 ≈5.833, τ<=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+6τ => 6τ >=24 => τ>=4\n\nSo τ=4,5\n\nτ=4: x_left= -35+24= -11, x_right= -24+24=0, -11<=0<=0 yes\n\nτ=5: x_left= -35+30= -5, x_right= -24+30=6, -5<=0<=6 yes\n\nτ=6: x_left= -35+36=1, x_right= -24+36=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in\n\nSo for first car, collision at T=4+4=8 and T=9.\n\nSecond car: (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nh=12, τ=1, d=right, so x_left=τ=1, x_right=h=12\n\nAt T, x_left(T)=1 +6(T-4)\n\nx_right(T)=12 +6(T-4)\n\n0 in span: 1+6τ <=0 <=12+6τ? But 1+6τ >=1 >0 for τ>=0, so left end at least 1, which is >0, so 0 cannot be <= x_left since x_left >=1, so 0 never in span for this car. Because the car is at x=1 to 12 at t1, moving right, so always positive and increasing, never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nh=48, τ=37, x_left=37, x_right=48, both large positive, moving right, so x_left(T)=37+6τ >=37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nTherefore for freeway 5, only the first car can cause collision, at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=4+4=8 and 4+5=9.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 4), (16, 5, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nd=right, x_left=τ= -59, x_right=h= -48\n\nAt T, x_left(T)= -59 +4(T-4)\n\nx_right(T)= -48 +4(T-4)\n\n0 in span: -59+4τ <=0 <= -48+4τ\n\nLeft: -59+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=59 => τ <=59/4=14.75, τ<=14\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+4τ => 4τ >=48 => τ>=12\n\nSo τ=12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nτ=12: x_left= -59 +48= -11, x_right= -48+48=0, -11<=0<=0 yes\n\nτ=13: x_left= -59+52= -7, x_right= -48+52=4, -7<=0<=4 yes\n\nτ=14: x_left= -59+56= -3, x_right= -48+56=8, -3<=0<=8 yes\n\nτ=15: x_left= -59+60=1, x_right= -48+60=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in\n\nSo collision at T=4+12=16, T=17, T=18\n\nSecond car: (16, 5, right, 4)\n\nx_left=5, x_right=16, both >0, moving right, so x_left(T)=5+4τ >=5>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus for freeway 6, collision only from first car at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nd=left, so for left-moving, head is h, tail is τ.\n\nDirection left, so x_left(t1) = h = -48, x_right(t1) = τ = -25? Since head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn notation: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, x_left decreases, x_right decreases.\n\nAt t1, positions: h=-48, τ=-25, so min x is -48, max is -25, so span [-48, -25]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-48 -24(T-4), -25 -24(T-4)]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<= max, but since min and max both negative and decreasing, let's see.\n\nx_left(T) = -48 -24τ, where τ=T-4\n\nx_right(T) = -25 -24τ\n\nBoth decrease as τ increases.\n\n0 in span if x_left(T) <= 0 <= x_right(T)\n\nBut x_left(T) = -48 -24τ < 0 for all τ, since negative.\n\nx_right(T) = -25 -24τ < 0 for all τ, so both ends negative, so 0 > x_right(T) > x_left(T), so 0 never <= x_right(T), thus 0 never in span. So no collision possible on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (-48, -25, left, 24), same as above, both ends negative and decreasing, so 0 never in span, no collision.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=5\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=5\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at T=12,13,14\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=12,13,14\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=8,9\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=16,17,18\n\n- Freeway 7: no collision\n\n- Freeway 8: no collision\n\nAlso, freeways 7 and 8 are safe all time.\n\nPlayer starts at t=4, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal path: go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\ny=3 at t=4.\n\nNow, let's plan the actions.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and start from y=3, we need at least 6 up moves.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down to avoid.\n\nNow, the dangerous rows:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=5\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=5\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=12,13,14? Freeway 3 is y=3, dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\nBut at t=4, y=3, which is now, but we are at turn t=4, position (0,3), and we need to take action for turn t=4 to go to next position.\n\nAt turn T, the player position y_T is after the action? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, the player chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at time t is given, then action at t determines position at t+1.\n\nIn terms of when collision is checked.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 in car span at T.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T), and we check for freeway k=y_T.\n\nNow, y_T is the position at time T.\n\nFor example, at t=4, player is at (0,3), so on freeway 3.\n\nBut at t=4, for freeway 3, is there collision? From above, freeway 3 dangerous at T=12,13,14, not at T=4, so at t=4, no collision on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, we start at t=4, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nt1=4, position at t1 is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,3)\n\nThen we choose actions a_t for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, so t=4,5,6,..., up to t=4+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have positions from t=4 to t=4+H.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t=4, we are at y_4=3.\n\nThen we choose a_4, which sets y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4.\n\nThen at turn t=5, we are at y_5, and we choose a_5, sets y_6, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1 + 0 to t1 + (H-1)\n\nSo for t=0, action at t1, which is a_{t1}\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at time t1 + H.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9) at some turn, so y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, we have positions from t=t1 to t=t1+H.\n\nAt time t=t1+H, we have y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can achieve that.\n\nSince we start at y=3 at t=4, and want to be at y=9 at t=4+H.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions.\n\nEach action changes or keeps y.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collisions depend on when we are on which row.\n\nLet me list the dangerous (time, row) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- At T=5, rows y=1 and y=2 are dangerous (from freeways 1 and 2)\n\n- At T=8 and T=9, row y=5 dangerous (freeway 5)\n\n- At T=12,13,14, rows y=3 and y=4 dangerous (freeways 3 and 4)\n\n- At T=16,17,18, row y=6 dangerous (freeway 6)\n\ny=7 and y=8 are always safe, since no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nWe start at t=4, y=3.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some t=4+H.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9, we need to increase y by 6.\n\nEach U move increases y by 1, S keeps, D decreases.\n\nTo minimize H, we should use U as much as possible, but may need to S or D to avoid being on dangerous row at wrong time.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, we might want to get to them quickly.\n\ny=9 is safe, but we need to reach it.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nAt t=4, y=3. Safe, since no danger at t=4.\n\nWe choose a_4.\n\nIf we go up, to y=4 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4: is it dangerous? Freeway 4 is dangerous at T=12,13,14, not at T=5, so at t=5, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 are dangerous at t=5, but we are at y=4.\n\nIf we go up to y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nNow, we can go to y=5 at t=6, or stay, etc.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8 and t=9 are in future.\n\nCurrent time t=5.\n\nLet's list the times: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...\n\nAt t=4: y=3, safe\n\nAction a_4: suppose U, then y_5 =4\n\nt=5: y=4, safe (since danger only at T=12-14)\n\nThen a_5: U, then y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, now at t=6, is y=5 dangerous? Freeway 5 dangerous at T=8,9, not at T=6, so safe.\n\nThen a_6: U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6 dangerous at T=16-18, not now, safe.\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7 always safe, so safe.\n\na_8: U, y_9=8\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8 always safe, safe.\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=9\n\nThen at t=10, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point we were on dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nIn this path:\n\n- At t=5: y=4, not dangerous time for y=4 (danger at 12-14)\n\n- At t=6: y=5, not dangerous (danger at 8-9)\n\n- At t=7: y=6, not dangerous (danger at 16-18)\n\n- At t=8: y=7, safe always\n\n- t=9: y=8, safe\n\n- t=10: y=9, safe\n\nBut at t=8, when we are at y=7, it is safe, but freeway 5 is dangerous at t=8, but we are not on y=5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, we are at y=8, safe, while y=5 is dangerous but we not there.\n\nIn this sequence, we never were on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nStart at t=4, y=3.\n\nAfter a_4=U, at t=5, y=4\n\nAfter a_5=U, at t=6, y=5\n\nAt t=6, y=5, position is (0,5), on freeway 5.\n\nIs there collision? At t=6, for freeway 5, cars: we have danger at T=8 and 9, not at T=6, so no car has 0 in span at t=6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, after a_6=U, at t=7, y=6, on freeway 6, at t=7, danger at T=16-18, not now, safe.\n\na_7=U, at t=8, y=7, safe row.\n\na_8=U, at t=9, y=8, safe.\n\na_9=U, at t=10, y=9, done.\n\nH=6 actions: from t=4 to t=9, actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9, and position at t=10 is y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=6.\n\nBut is this minimal? From y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so at least 6 up moves, so H at least 6. With no waiting, we reached in 6 actions, so should be minimal.\n\nBut we need to confirm if at any point there is collision.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, we are at y=7, not on y=5.\n\nBut what about the move? For example, when we move from y=5 to y=6.\n\nAt turn t, when we take action.\n\nFor instance, at turn t=6, we are at y=6? No.\n\nAt turn t=6: position y_6.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn t=4: position y_4=3, choose a_4=U, so y_5=4\n\n- Turn t=5: position y_5=4, choose a_5=U, so y_6=5\n\n- Turn t=6: position y_6=5, choose a_6=U, so y_7=6\n\n- Turn t=7: position y_7=6, choose a_7=U, so y_8=7\n\n- Turn t=8: position y_8=7, choose a_8=U, so y_9=8\n\n- Turn t=9: position y_9=8, choose a_9=U, so y_10=9\n\nNow, collision check at each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt turn t=4: y=3, freeway 3, at t=4, not dangerous, safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, at t=5, not dangerous (danger at 12-14), safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, at t=6, is it dangerous? Freeway 5 dangerous at T=8 and 9, not at T=6. At T=6, τ=2, for first car, x_left= -35 +6(2) = -35+12= -23? τ=T-t1=T-4\n\nt=6, T=6, τ=2\n\nFor freeway 5, first car: x_left(T)= -35 +6(τ) = -35 +12 = -23\n\nx_right= -24 +12 = -12\n\nSpan [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not near, so safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, at t=7, τ=3\n\nFirst car: x_left= -59 +4(3) = -59+12= -47? Freeway 6 first car: x_left(T)= -59 +4(τ)\n\nτ=3, x_left= -59+12= -47, x_right= -48+12= -36? x_right= -48 +4τ = -48+12= -36, span [-47,-36], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, no cars or safe, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nt=10: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nWe reached in H=6 actions.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=8 or something? No.\n\nEarlier I thought y=5 dangerous at t=8, but in this path, at t=8 we are at y=7, not y=5.\n\nAt t=8, if someone were on y=5, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times again.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 dangerous at T=8 and 9.\n\nT=8: t=8, which is turn 8.\n\nIn our path, at t=8, we are on y=7.\n\nAt t=9, on y=8.\n\nSo not on y=5 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, other dangers are later or not relevant.\n\nSo with 6 up moves, we can reach directly.\n\nBut the player starts at y=3 at t=4, and we go to y=4 at t=5, etc.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we need to output actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nHere H=6, actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9 all U.\n\nThen position at t=10 is (0,9).\n\nBut is t=10 the turn when we reach? Yes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But from y=3 to y=9, min 6 moves, so no.\n\nUnless we start at t=4, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nBut in the car states, is there any immediate danger?\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=1 and y=2 are dangerous, but we are at y=4, so fine.\n\nIn this path, we didn't go to y=1 or y=2, so no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we did something else.\n\nFor example, if at t=4 we stay, y=3 at t=5, but at t=5 y=3 is safe, since danger only later, but staying would delay, not better.\n\nOr moving down, worse.\n\nSo the direct up path seems fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at t=5, if we were on y=1 or y=2, it would be bad, but we are not.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, but we pass through at t=6, which is safe.\n\nt=6 is before danger at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think H=6 is achievable.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from turn t=4 to t=9.\n\nTurn t_1 =4, so:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThen at turn 10, position (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 5 for H=6.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_4\n\nt=1: a_5\n\n...\n\nt=5: a_9\n\nSo actions: a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9 all U.\n\nNow, output.\n\nBut in the box, it should be listed.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might have issue with the move.\n\nFor example, when moving from y=5 to y=6 at turn t=6.\n\nAt turn t=6, we are on y=5, we choose U, so we move to y=6.\n\nAt turn t=6, we are on y=5, which is safe as above.\n\nAfter action, at t+1=7, we are on y=6.\n\nThe note about not being on the new row until next turn: but for collision, it's only at the current turn on the current row.\n\nWhen we move at turn T, we are on y_T, and we go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, we are still on y_T for collision check.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nSuppose at some point we need to be on a row when it is dangerous, but we avoid that.\n\nHere, we are never on a dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=5 is dangerous, but we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y=5 dangerous, but we on y=8.\n\nAt t=12, y=3 and y=4 dangerous, but we are long gone, at y=9 or beyond, but we reach at t=10.\n\nt=10 is before t=12.\n\nSimilarly, t=16-18 later.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6 with all up moves.\n\nBut the player starts at y=3, which is row 3, and we go up to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn the sequence, after 6 up moves, from y=3 to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's see if we can do it in less, impossible.\n\nOr if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: y must be between 0 and 9, and in this path, we go from 3 to 9, all within bounds.\n\nNo need to go down.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in freeway 5, there is a car at (12,1,right,6), which we said never at 0, but at t=6, it is at x=1+6(2)=1+12=13 to 12+12=24? At τ=2, x_left=1+12=13, x_right=12+12=24, far away.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with actions all U.\n\nNow, output format.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=4 to t=9.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nIn the box, it should be listed as above.\n\nSince t1=4, we can write Turn t_1: U, Turn t_1+1: U, etc.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\nThe car positions and movements were analyzed to determine when each freeway is hazardous (i.e., when a car's span includes \\(x = 0\\) at a given turn). The hazards are:\n- Freeway 1: Hazard at turn 5.\n- Freeway 2: Hazard at turn 5.\n- Freeway 3: Hazards at turns 12, 13, 14.\n- Freeway 4: Hazards at turns 12, 13, 14.\n- Freeway 5: Hazards at turns 8, 9.\n- Freeway 6: Hazards at turns 16, 17, 18.\n- Freeway 7: No hazards at any turn.\n- Freeway 8: No hazards at any turn.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 are always safe, and \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars, so they are safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe player must move from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\), a difference of 6, requiring at least 6 \"up\" (U) actions if no delays are needed. A direct upward path is feasible without encountering hazards:\n- At turn 4, start at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is not hazardous at turn 4).\n- Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5 (safe, as freeway 4 is not hazardous at turn 5).\n- Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6 (safe, as freeway 5 is hazardous at turns 8 and 9, not turn 6).\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7 (safe, as freeway 6 is hazardous at turns 16–18, not turn 7).\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8 (safe, as freeway 7 has no hazards).\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9 (safe, as freeway 8 has no hazards).\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10 (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis path uses 6 actions (H = 6) and avoids all hazards:\n- No time is spent on hazardous freeways during hazardous turns.\n- Movements are within bounds (\\(y \\in [0, 9]\\)).\n- H = 6 is minimal, as 6 up moves are required to cover the vertical distance.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = t_1\\) to \\(t = t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 5 = 9\\) is all \"up\" (U).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions that move left or right at given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the player's x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y to y+1, at turn T they are still on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, we care about the car on y_T, not y_{T+1} if moving.\n\nThe goal is to find a sequence of actions from turn t_1=5 onwards to reach y=9 with minimal H, meaning the position at turn t_1 + H - 1 should be (0,9). Since we start at turn t_1, and we have actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so turn indices: action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, a_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H - 1} at turn t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position should be (0,9). Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1. So for t=0, a_{t_1}, action at turn t_1. After this action, position is updated to turn t_1 +1. Similarly, after a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H should be (0,9). But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1 + H -1? Let me read.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9). But the action at turn t_1 + H -1 determines the position at turn t_1 + H. I think there's confusion in indexing.\n\nLet t be the turn index. At turn t, we apply action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 with position y_{t_1} = 4.\n\nWe want to find H and actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1} such that after applying these H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nLet's read carefully: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is 9. But at that turn, we might not have applied the action yet? No.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t. We apply a_t, then position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1, position is y_{t_1} = 4.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position is y_{t_1+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is different.\n\nLet me read the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9 means that at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is 9. But at turn t_1 + H -1, we apply action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which would change the position to y_{t_1 + H}, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, so at that turn, before action, position is 9.\n\nThen after applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, it might change, but we don't care, as long as at some point it is 9.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen for that turn, we need to ensure no collision at that position.\n\nSimilarly for all turns.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, so actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have position y_T, and we need to check collision at turn T for y_T.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, and we are on freeway y_T, so we check if 0 is in car span on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen we apply action a_T to get y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at T=t_1 with y_{t_1} =4.\n\nWe want for some H, at turn T = t_1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nSo the position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1, with H actions applied from t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's count the turns.\n\nLet k = H, the number of actions.\n\nActions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + k -1.\n\nAfter these k actions, the positions are from turn t_1+1 to t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, position at t_1+1 is set.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + k -1}, position at t_1 + k is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + k} =9 for some k, but the problem says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns from start, including turn t_1.\n\nLet's look at the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo for example, if H=1, then only one action: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, and y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =4, which is not 9, so H=1 is impossible.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1, and y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1+1} should be 9.\n\nSo after one action, at turn t_1+1, position should be 9.\n\nSimilarly, for H actions, we have actions at t_1 to t_1+H-1, and position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + H -1 is set by the action at turn t_1 + H -2? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nWe apply a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, y_t is known.\n\nAfter applying a_t, y_{t+1} is computed.\n\nFor the sequence, we apply a_{t_1} at turn t_1, which sets y_{t_1+1}.\n\nThen apply a_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1, sets y_{t_1+2}, and so on, up to apply a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, which sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before applying a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it must be that at turn t_1 + H -2, we applied an action that made y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, or if H-1=0, but t_1 + H -1 >= t_1 since H>=1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then we want y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =4 to be 9, which is false.\n\nSo H must be at least 2? Let's see the minimal H.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, the minimum number of moves is 5 ups, but we can stay or down, so minimum H if we go directly up, but with cars, it might take more turns.\n\nBut let's not worry about that yet.\n\nBack to indexing.\n\nTo have y_T =9 at turn T, for T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor this to happen, the action at turn T-1 must have set y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T = t_1 + H -1, we have position y_T =9, and we also apply an action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}, but we don't care about y_{T+1} as long as we reach (0,9) at turn T.\n\nAnd for collision, at each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when we are at position y_t, we need to check for collision with cars on freeway y_t at that turn.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we need to check collision at that turn.\n\nFreeway y=9 is not listed, since cars are on y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so no collision possible at y=9. Similarly, y=0 has no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nSo reaching y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, we start at y=4 at turn t_1=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: if we go up every turn, from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9 in 5 steps, so at turn 5+4=9, y=9 if we start from turn 5.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nAt turn t_1=5, y_5 =4.\n\nApply a_5: U, then y_6 =5\n\na_6: U, y_7=6\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\na_8: U, y_9=8\n\na_9: U, y_10=9\n\nThen at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut we want y_T =9 for T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf T=10, then t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1 =10, so 4 + H =10, H=6.\n\nActions from a_5 to a_10? T= t_1 + H -1 =10, so H-1 =5, H=6, actions at t_5 to t_10? t_1=5, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_5 to a_{5+5} =a_10? H=6, t from 0 to 5, a_{5+0} to a_{5+5}, so a_5 to a_10.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+5} =y_10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we could reach faster, but from 4 to 9, minimum 5 up actions, so minimum 5 actions to increase by 5, so after 5 actions, y_{t_1 +5} =9.\n\nThen T = t_1 +5, and we want y_T =9 for T= t_1 + H -1, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +5, thus H-1=5, H=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach in fewer actions, but we can't, since we need to increase y by 5.\n\nWe can stay or down, but that would take more turns, so minimal H is at least 6.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nt_1 =5.\n\nFor each freeway, we have cars with initial span at t_1, and we need to find when 0 is in their span at future turns.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nCar positions are given at t_1, and we can compute for any T.\n\nT is absolute turn number.\n\nSince t_1=5, we can think in terms of Δt = T - t_1 = T - 5.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1, so at time τ=0, turn T=5.\n\nPlayer position at turn T=5 is y=4.\n\nWe need to find actions for τ=0 to some K, such that at some turn T, with τ = T-5, y_T =9, and we want minimal H such that for T=5 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nSet T = t_1 + τ, with τ=0 at turn t_1.\n\nAt τ=0, turn T=5, position y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + τ} at turn T=5+τ, position y_{5+τ+1} is set? No.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is fixed, we apply a_T, set y_{T+1}.\n\nFor turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAt τ=0, T=5, y_5=4.\n\nApply a_5, set y_6.\n\nThen at T=6, y_6, apply a_6, set y_7, and so on.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nWith T = t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if y_9=9, then T=9, 5 + H -1 =9, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nIf y_10=9, T=10, 5+H-1=10, H=6.\n\nSince y starts at 4, to reach 9, the earliest possible is after 5 up moves, so y_{5+5} = y_10=9, so T=10, 5+H-1=10, H=6.\n\ny_10=9, T=10, t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1 =10, so H=6.\n\nIf we can reach earlier, but we can't, since we need 5 increases.\n\nSo minimal H is 6 if no cars, but with cars, we might need to go slower or detour.\n\nNow, we need to check for each possible path if we can go directly up without collision.\n\nFirst, let's list the car spans for each freeway at each turn.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, at turn T, car span for that freeway.\n\nCars are moving, so for a given freeway, at turn T, the span of each car on that freeway.\n\nThen collision if 0 is in any span for the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso, for freeway, if multiple cars, we need to see if any covers x=0.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway at t_1=5.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: head 0, tail -47, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSince direction right, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0], and moving right, so at time T, span [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-5), 0 + 48(T-5)] = [48(T-5) -47, 48(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): same as y=1, car (0, -47, right, 48), so span at T: [48(T-5) -47, 48(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): car (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [-39, -28]? Head and tail.\n\nIn the car state, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving, span [h, τ] and moves left.\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ, h] and moves right.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] -> span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so span should be [tail, head], since tail is left, head is right for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is front, so for left-moving, head is right, tail is left, so span [tail, head] for both, but when moving, for left-moving, both decrease, for right-moving both increase.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving: given (h, τ, left, s), span at t1 is [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume, and moves left, so span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: (h, τ, right, s), span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ < h, moves right, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nhead = -28, tail = -39, direction right.\n\nSo at t1, span [τ, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nAt T, span [ -39 + 4(T-5), -28 + 4(T-5) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, car (-28, -39, right, 4), so same span as y=3.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-18, -29, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6), and (54, 43, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head -18, tail -29, right, s=6. Span at t1: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nAt T: [ -29 + 6(T-5), -18 + 6(T-5) ]\n\nSecond car: (18, 7, right, 6), head 18, tail 7, so span [7,18] at t1, at T: [7 + 6(T-5), 18 + 6(T-5)]\n\nThird car: (54, 43, right, 6), head 54, tail 43, span [43,54] at t1, at T: [43 + 6(T-5), 54 + 6(T-5)]\n\nBut tail 43, head 54, so [43,54], yes.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-44, -55, right, 4) and (20, 9, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head -44, tail -55, right, s=4. Span at t1: [-55, -44]\n\nAt T: [-55 + 4(T-5), -44 + 4(T-5)]\n\nSecond car: (20, 9, right, 4), head 20, tail 9, span [9,20] at t1, at T: [9 + 4(T-5), 20 + 4(T-5)]\n\nFreeway 7: car (-72, -49, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so head -72, tail -49, and since left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-72, -49]? For left-moving, the span is given as [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the update, it says for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nIn this case, head h=-72, tail τ=-49, so [h, τ] = [-72, -49], but -72 < -49, so the span is from -72 to -49, which is increasing, but since left-moving, it should be moving left, so positions decreasing.\n\nAt T, span [ -72 -24(T-5), -49 -24(T-5) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, car (-72, -49, left, 24), so same.\n\nNow, we need to find for each freeway, at each turn T, if there is a car where 0 is in the span.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and turn T, if min <= 0 <= max for some car span on that freeway.\n\nThen for the player, at turn T, if on freeway y_T = k, and if 0 is in some span on k at T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nSince we move step by step, we need to plan the actions.\n\nWe start at T=5, y=4.\n\nFreeway y=4 has cars? Freeway 4 has a car, but let's see the freeway index.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=5, y=4, so we are on freeway 4.\n\nCheck if collision at T=5 for y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: car at t1=5, span [ -39 +4(0), -28 +4(0)] for Δt=0, [ -39, -28]\n\n0 between -39 and -28? -39 <= 0 <= -28? 0 >= -39 true, 0 <= -28 false, so 0 not in [-39,-28], so no collision at T=5 on y=4.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, we apply action at T=5 to go to y=5 or something.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we need to go up, and y=9 safe, let's see if we can go directly up from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps: positions y=5,6,7,8,9 at turns 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWe need to check for each turn T from 5 to 10, when at y_T, if collision.\n\nAt T=5, y=4, freeway 4: as above, no collision.\n\nNow, for future turns, we need to know the path.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each turn T around 5 to 10, if x=0 is covered.\n\nSet Δt = T - 5, so T=5, Δt=0; T=6, Δt=1, etc.\n\nWe care about T from 5 to, say, 10 or 11, but since we reach by T=10, let's go to T=10.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): car span at T: [48(Δt) -47, 48(Δt)] for Δt = T-5\n\n0 in span if 48Δt -47 <= 0 <= 48Δt\n\nSince 48Δt -47 <= 48Δt always, so if 48Δt -47 <= 0 and 0 <= 48Δt.\n\n0 <= 48Δt always for Δt >=0, since Δt >=0.\n\n48Δt -47 <=0 when 48Δt <=47, Δt <= 47/48 <1, so for Δt=0, 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0, 0<=0? 0 <= 48*0=0, true, so at Δt=0, 0 in span.\n\nBut Δt=0, T=5.\n\nAt T=5, freeway 1, car span [48*0 -47, 48*0] = [-47,0]\n\n-47 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included, since tail or head.\n\nSpan is [min, max], inclusive, I assume.\n\n[ -47, 0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nAt T=5, for freeway 1, 0 is in the car span.\n\nBut at T=5, we are on y=4, not y=1, so for us, at T=5, on y=4, not affected.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nFor freeway 1: 0 in span when 48Δt -47 <=0 and 0<=48Δt.\n\n0<=48Δt always for Δt>=0.\n\n48Δt -47 <=0 when Δt <= 47/48 <1, so only at Δt=0, T=5, 0 is in span. For Δt>=1, 48Δt -47 >=48-47=1>0, so min>0, 0 not <= min? min=48Δt-47, for Δt=1, min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,48], for example.\n\nSimilarly, max=48Δt >0 for Δt>=1.\n\nSo only at T=5, freeway 1 has car at x=0.\n\nBut we don't care unless we are on y=1 at T=5.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): same as y=1, car identical, so only at T=5, 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): car span at T: [ -39 +4Δt, -28 +4Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -39 +4Δt <=0 <= -28 +4Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -39 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=39 => Δt <= 39/4 = 9.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -28 +4Δt => 4Δt >=28 => Δt >=7\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 9, inclusive? Let's see.\n\nΔt >=7 and Δt <=9.75, since Δt integer, Δt=7,8,9\n\nFor Δt=7: min = -39 +4*7 = -39+28= -11 <=0, max= -28+28=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=8: min=-39+32= -7, max=-28+32=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: min=-39+36= -3, max=-28+36=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=10: min=-39+40=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, lower.\n\nSo for freeway 3, 0 covered at T=5+7=12, T=13, T=14? Δt=7,8,9, T=12,13,14.\n\nT=5+7=12, etc.\n\nBut we are around T=5 to10, so not relevant yet.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): same as y=3, car (-28,-39,right,4), so same, 0 covered at Δt=7,8,9, T=12,13,14.\n\nNot in our range.\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): has three cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -29 +6Δt, -18 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in if -29+6Δt <=0 <= -18+6Δt\n\nFirst: -29+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=29 => Δt <= 29/6 ≈4.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18+6Δt => 6Δt >=18 => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt=3,4\n\nΔt=3: min=-29+18= -11, max=-18+18=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=4: min=-29+24= -5, max=-18+24=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=5: min= -29+30=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: span [7 +6Δt, 18 +6Δt]\n\nmin=7+6Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>=7>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: [43+6Δt,54+6Δt], min>=43>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only first car can cover 0, at Δt=3 and 4, T=8 and 9.\n\nT=5+3=8, T=5+4=9.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [ -55 +4Δt, -44 +4Δt ]\n\n0 in if -55+4Δt <=0 <= -44+4Δt\n\nFirst: -55+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=55 => Δt <=13.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -44+4Δt => 4Δt >=44 => Δt >=11\n\nSo for Δt=11 to 13, T=16 to 18, not in range.\n\nSecond car: span [9 +4Δt, 20 +4Δt], min=9+4Δt >=9>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 6, no car covers x=0 for T=5 to 10, since first car only at T=16+.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): car left-moving, span at T: [ -72 -24Δt, -49 -24Δt ] because for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s dt, τ - s dt] with h=-72, τ=-49, s=24, dt=Δt.\n\nAt T, [ -72 -24(Δt), -49 -24(Δt) ]\n\nSince left-moving, positions decreasing.\n\n0 in span if min <=0<=max, but min = -72-24Δt, max= -49-24Δt.\n\nSince both negative for Δt>=0, min <= max <0, so 0 not <= max, since max negative, so 0 never in span for this car, because the car is at negative x, moving left to more negative.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 (y=8): same as y=7, car never covers x=0.\n\nSo summary for each freeway, when x=0 is covered:\n\ny=1: only at T=5\n\ny=2: only at T=5\n\ny=3: at T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: at T=12,13,14\n\ny=5: at T=8,9 (from first car)\n\ny=6: never in our range, or at T=16-18 but not relevant\n\ny=7: never\n\ny=8: never\n\nNow for the player, we start at T=5, y=4.\n\nAt T=5, y=4, freeway 4: not covered at T=5, as we saw earlier.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=5 at next turn.\n\nBut position at T=6, y=6? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T=5, position y=4, apply action a_5, then y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5.\n\nIf a_5=U, y_6=5.\n\nThen at turn T=6, position y=5, on freeway 5.\n\nAt T=6, for freeway 5, is 0 covered? From above, y=5 covered at T=8 and 9, not at T=6.\n\nT=6, Δt=1, for freeway 5, first car min= -29+6*1= -23, max= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not cover, so safe at T=6 on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up again.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nMinimal path: go up each turn.\n\nStart: T=5, y=4, safe (as above)\n\nApply a_5=U, then y_6=5\n\nT=6, y=5, on freeway 5: at T=6, not covered, safe.\n\nApply a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nT=7, y=6, on freeway 6: at T=7, freeway 6 not covered (as above, only possible at T=16-18), so safe.\n\nApply a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nT=8, y=7, on freeway 7: freeway 7 never covers x=0, so safe.\n\nApply a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nT=9, y=8, on freeway 8: never covers, safe.\n\nApply a_9=U, y_10=9\n\nT=10, y=9, no freeway or safe, since y=9 no cars.\n\nBut we need y_T=9 at some T, here at T=10, y=9.\n\nNow, at which turns are we at risk?\n\nIn this path, we are at:\n\nT=5, y=4: safe\n\nT=6, y=5: safe\n\nT=7, y=6: safe\n\nT=8, y=7: safe\n\nT=9, y=8: safe\n\nT=10, y=9: safe\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, for freeway 5, it is covered, but at T=8, we are on y=7, not y=5, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, we are on y=8.\n\nSo in this direct path, all safe.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nt_1=5, y_T=9 at T=10.\n\nThen 5 + H -1 =10, so H=6.\n\nActions: a_5 to a_9, five actions? From turn 5 to 9.\n\nT=5 to T=9, actions at turn 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter a_9, y_10=9.\n\nAt turn T=10, position y=9, which is when we want to be at (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, with H=6, so a_5 to a_{5+5}=a_{10}?\n\nt_1 + H -1 =5 +6 -1=10, so actions at turn 5 to turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 10, if we apply a_{10}, it sets y_{11}, but we don't care.\n\nIn this case, with actions: a_5=U (to y=5), a_6=U (to y=6), a_7=U (to y=7), a_8=U (to y=8), a_9=U (to y=9), and then at turn 10, we need to apply a_{10}, but what action? Since we are already at y=9 at turn 10? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=10, position y=10? No.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAt turn 5: apply a_5=U, set y_6=5\n\nTurn 6: position y=6? No.\n\nAt turn 5: position y_5=4, apply a_5=U, then y_6=5\n\nNow at turn 6: position y_6=5, apply a_6=U, set y_7=6\n\nTurn 7: y_7=6, apply a_7=U, set y_8=7\n\nTurn 8: y_8=7, apply a_8=U, set y_9=8\n\nTurn 9: y_9=8, apply a_9=U, set y_10=9\n\nNow at turn 10: position y_10=9\n\nWe want y_T=9 for T= t_1 + H -1 =10, so T=10, y=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_5 to a_{10}.\n\nBut at turn 10, we need to apply an action, but since y_10=9, we can apply S, for example, to stay.\n\nThen y_11=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn terms of reaching, at turn 10, we are at (0,9), and we need to output actions up to a_{10}.\n\nH=6 actions: a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_{10}\n\nBut with a_5 to a_9 all U, we set y_6 to y_10, but y_10=9 at turn 10.\n\nThen a_{10} can be S, so y_11=9, but position at turn 10 is y_10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could have a_{10} anything, but S is fine.\n\nIn this path, all positions are safe: at T=5 y=4, safe; T=6 y=5, safe; T=7 y=6, safe; T=8 y=7, safe; T=9 y=8, safe; T=10 y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there a problem? Earlier I thought freeway 5 has car at T=8 and T=9, but at T=8 we are on y=7, not y=5; similarly T=9 on y=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? From y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 up moves, so after 5 actions, y_{10}=9, so at turn 10, we reach. Cannot earlier.\n\nWith H=6, we have 6 actions, but the last action at turn 10 sets y_{11}, but since we are at y=9 at turn 10, it's fine.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but we need 5 up actions, so minimum 5 actions to change position, but with H, we have H actions to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf we could reach at turn 9, but y starts at 4, after 4 up moves, at turn 9 y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 5 up moves, at turn 10 y=9.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nIn this case, with direct up, it seems safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at freeway 5 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 5, first car: min= -29 +6*(8-5) = -29 +6*3 = -29+18= -11, max= -18+18=0, so [ -11,0], so x=0 covered, so if player is on y=5 at T=8, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at T=8, we are on y=7, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, freeway 5: min= -29 +6*4= -29+24= -5, max= -18+24=6, [ -5,6], 0 in, but at T=9, we are on y=8.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, is there any other constraint?\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=6, actions at turn 5 to 10.\n\na_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_{10}=?\n\nAt turn 10, we are at y=9, we can choose any action, say S, to stay.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 10, and we need to output actions, a_{10} can be S.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list for each turn.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=6.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller? H=5: then t_1 + H -1 =5+5-1=9, so y_9=9.\n\nBut from y_5=4, to y_9=9, need to increase by 5 in 4 actions? Actions at turn 5,6,7,8.\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 is set.\n\ny_9 = y_5 + sum_{t=5 to 8} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t <=1, so maximum y_9 = 4 + 4*1 =8, cannot reach 9 in 4 actions.\n\nWith 4 actions, y_9 <= 4 +4 =8.\n\nTo reach y=9, need at least 5 actions, so y_{10}=9, with H=6 as above.\n\nIf we start with down or stay, it takes more turns, so H larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nAnd with direct up, it works.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn our case, when we move up at turn T, we are on y_T at turn T, and cars on y_T at turn T matter.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1 matter.\n\nIn the direct path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at some point we need to avoid, but here not.\n\nAnother thing: at T=5, freeway 1 and 2 have car at x=0, but we are on y=4, so fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence: actions from turn 5 to turn 10.\n\na_5: U\n\na_6: U\n\na_7: U\n\na_8: U\n\na_9: U\n\na_10: S (since we are at y=9, stay or whatever, but S is fine)\n\nIn the output, it should be listed.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut is S necessary? We could do nothing at turn 10, but we have to output the actions up to turn 10.\n\nSince we reach at turn 10, and we need to specify action at turn 10, we can choose S.\n\nWe could choose U, but y=9, U would go to 10, but y=10 invalid, since y in 0-9, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so at y=9, cannot go U, must go S or D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, cannot go D.\n\nSo at turn 10, since y=9, we must choose S or D, but D to 8, which is not 9, but we are already at 9 at turn 10, so to stay, we choose S.\n\nIf we choose D at turn 10, y_11=8, but at turn 10, position is 9, which is what we want, and we output action for turn 10, which affects y_11, but position at turn 10 is already 9.\n\nSo we can choose S to keep it 9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, with a_5 to a_9 all U, and a_10=S.\n\nBut H=6 turns of actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence by reaching earlier, but impossible.\n\nMaybe with different path, but not necessary.\n\nBut let's see if at some point we are forced to not go up.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=5 at T=6, safe.\n\nThen if we go to y=6 at T=7, safe.\n\nBut at T=8, if we were on y=5, it would be collision, but we are going up to y=7 at T=8.\n\nIn T=8, we are on y=7, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go down or stay to avoid, but not needed.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has a car that might be issue, but not in range.\n\nIn freeway 5, the second car is at [7,18] at t1, moving right, so at T=6, [7+6=13,18+6=19], etc., all positive, so never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think direct up is fine.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 5, there is a car (18,7,right,6), at t1 span [7,18], which is fine.\n\nBut at T=8, freeway 5 covered by first car.\n\nBut we not there.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,4) at turn 5.\n\nAfter U at 5, to (0,5) at turn 6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn terms of collision, at each turn, when at position.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, position (0,5), on freeway 5, at T=6, car on freeway 5: first car [-29+6= -23, -18+6= -12], no 0; second [13,24], no; third [49,60], no. Safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, freeway 6: cars [-55+8= -47? T=7, Δt=2, freeway 6 first car: [-55 +4*2, -44 +4*2] = [-55+8, -44+8] = [-47,-36], min=-47, max=-36, both negative, 0 not in. Second car [9+8=17,20+8=28], min=17>0, no. Safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7: car at T=8, Δt=3, [ -72 -24*3, -49 -24*3] = [-72-72, -49-72] = [-144,-121], both negative, no. Safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=8, freeway 8: same as above, car never near 0.\n\nTurn 10: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=6, sequence: U, U, U, U, U, S for turns 5 to 10.\n\nBut a_10=S.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nPerhaps we don't need the last action if we are already at goal, but according to the sequence, we need to specify actions up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince H=6, t_1 + H -1=5+5=10? t_1 + H -1=5+6-1=10, yes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) and aims to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 6, as it takes exactly 5 upward moves to increase the y-coordinate from 4 to 9, and the position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 5 + 6 - 1 = 10\\). The sequence of actions must include these 5 upward moves, and the action at turn 10 can be \"S\" (stay) since the player is already at the target position.\n\nThe car states at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) are analyzed to ensure no collisions occur during the path:\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): Collision at x=0 only at T=5, but player is not on y=1 at T=5.\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): Collision at x=0 only at T=5, but player not on y=2 at T=5.\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): Collision at x=0 at T=12,13,14, outside the relevant turns (5-10).\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): Collision at x=0 at T=12,13,14, outside relevant turns; at T=5, no collision.\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): Collision at x=0 at T=8 and T=9 due to the first car. At T=8, player is on y=7; at T=9, player is on y=8, so no collision.\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): No collision at x=0 for turns 5-10.\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): No collision at x=0 for any turn.\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): No collision at x=0 for any turn.\n- Freeway y=9: No cars, always safe.\n\nThe direct upward path is collision-free:\n- Turn 5: y=4 (freeway 4), no collision.\n- Turn 6: y=5 (freeway 5), no collision (car spans: [-23,-12], [13,24], [49,60]).\n- Turn 7: y=6 (freeway 6), no collision (car spans: [-47,-36], [17,28]).\n- Turn 8: y=7 (freeway 7), no collision (car span: [-144,-121]).\n- Turn 9: y=8 (freeway 8), no collision (car span: [-144,-121]).\n- Turn 10: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this with \\(H=6\\) is:\n- Turn 5: U (move to y=5 at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (move to y=6 at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: U (move to y=7 at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (move to y=8 at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move to y=9 at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: S (stay at y=9; any action is valid, but S keeps position)\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0,9)\\) at turn 10 with no collisions and minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{6}\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each has a position that moves over time. Collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, since I'm starting at y=5 at turn t=6, and I need to reach y=9. The actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays same). y is between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=5 to y=9 is 4, if I go up each time. But I have to avoid the cars on the freeways I pass through.\n\nI need to check for each freeway I might be on, at the turn I'm there, whether there's a car that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t=6, and they move with their speeds. For left-moving cars, the span moves left (decreasing x), for right-moving, it moves right (increasing x).\n\nLet me list all the cars and their spans at turn t=6.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, the head is at higher x, tail at lower, so span is [tail, head] = [1,48] at t=6. Speed 48, so it moves right at 48 units per turn? That seems fast, but okay.\n\nSpeed is in units per turn, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, head=48, tail=1, right, speed=48. Span [1,48] at t=6.\n\nFreeway 3: head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right. Since right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -24 > -35, so head is at x=-24, tail at x=-35, so span [ -35, -24] at t=6, and moving right with speed 4.\n\nDirection is given, so for right-moving, the car is moving to increasing x, so at time T, position is initial + speed*(T-t1).\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn freeway 3: head h=-24, tail tau=-35, direction right, speed s=4.\n\nSo at t=6, span [tau, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt time T, span [tau + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [-35 + 4(T-6), -24 + 4(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as 3, head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=4. So span [-35, -24] at t=6.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6. So span [-23, -12] at t=6? Tail=-23, head=-12, both negative, but -12 > -23, so [tau, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSecond car: head=24, tail=13, right, speed=6. Span [13,24]\n\nThird car: head=60, tail=49, right, speed=6. Span [49,60]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst: head=-40, tail=-51, right, speed=4. Tail=-51, head=-40, so span [-51, -40]\n\nSecond: head=24, tail=13, right, speed=4. Span [13,24]? Tail=13, head=24, so [13,24]\n\nFreeway 7: head=48, tail=71, direction left, speed=24. Left-moving, so head and tail might be confusing.\n\nFor left-moving, at t=6, span is [h, tau] = [48,71]? But it says head and tail, but in the direction, left-moving, so it's moving to decreasing x.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nWith h and tau given.\n\nHere head=48, tail=71, but 48 < 71, and since left-moving, head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, I think.\n\nTypically, head is the front, so for left-moving, front is at smaller x.\n\nAt t=6, span from h to tau, [48,71], and since left-moving, it moves left, so x decreases.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same, head=48, tail=71, left, speed=24. Span [48,71] at t=6.\n\nNow, I need to be on freeways only when no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for any car on y, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nAnd I move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, so at turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t) at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at (0, y_t), and I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nBut at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check for collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIf I move to a different y, I am not on the new y until the next turn.\n\nNow, I start at t=6, y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is freeway 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so if I'm on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, when I'm moving between, I need to be safe on y=1 to 8 when I'm there.\n\nNow, minimal path: directly up from y=5 to y=9 in 4 turns: U,U,U,U.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn when I'm on y=6,7,8 whether at that turn, for the freeway, 0 is covered by a car.\n\nI start at t=6, y=5. At turn t=6, I am on y=5, so I need to check freeway 5 at t=6 for collision.\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars at t=6:\n\nCar1: span [-23, -12], 0 not in [-23,-12] since -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nCar2: [13,24], 13 to 24, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [49,60], 49 to 60, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=6, on y=5, no collision.\n\nNow, I take action at t=6. I want to go up, so a_{t1} = a_6 = U.\n\nThen at turn t=7, I will be at y=6.\n\nBut at turn t=7, I am on y=6, so I need to check freeway 6 at t=7.\n\nFirst, find car positions at t=7.\n\nt=7 is T=7, t1=6, so Δt = T - t1 =1.\n\nFreeway 6 cars:\n\nFirst car: at t=6, span [-51,-40], right, speed=4.\n\nAt T=7, span [tau + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)] = [-51 + 4(1), -40 + 4(1)] = [-47, -36]\n\n0 not in [-47,-36]\n\nSecond car: at t=6, span [13,24], right, speed=4.\n\nAt T=7, [13+4(1), 24+4(1)] = [17,28]\n\n0 not in [17,28]\n\nSo at t=7, on y=6, no collision if I am there.\n\nNow, if I go up, at t=7, I take U, so at t=8, y=7.\n\nAt turn t=8, I am on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7: one car, at t=6, span [48,71], left-moving, speed=24.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=2, span [h - s(Δt), tau - s(Δt)] = [48 - 24*2, 71 - 24*2] = [48-48, 71-48] = [0,23]\n\nh - s(Δt) = 48 - 24*2 = 48-48=0\n\ntau - s(Δt) = 71 - 48 = 23\n\nSo span at t=8 is [0,23]\n\nNow, 0 is in [0,23], since it includes 0.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at turn t=8, I collide with this car.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at t=8 if I go up directly.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I go U at t=6 to y=6 at t=7, then U at t=7 to y=7 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, I am on y=7, and car span includes 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, direct up is not possible because at t=8, on y=7, collision.\n\nNow, what if I stay or go down? But I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns might be more than 4.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 at t=8.\n\nPerhaps go up slower, or go down first, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince y=7 has a car that covers 0 at t=8, I need to be on y=7 at a different time when it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's find when the car on y=7 is not covering 0.\n\nFreeway 7: car span at time T: [h - s(T-6), tau - s(T-6)] = [48 - 24(T-6), 71 - 24(T-6)]\n\nSet this not containing 0.\n\n0 is not in [48 -24k, 71-24k] where k=T-6.\n\nThe span is [48-24k, 71-24k]\n\n0 is in this interval if 48-24k <= 0 <= 71-24k\n\nSince the car is moving left, the left end decreases, right end decreases.\n\nFind when 0 is in the interval.\n\n48-24k <= 0 and 0 <= 71-24k\n\nFirst inequality: 48-24k <= 0 => 24k >=48 => k >=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 71-24k => 24k <=71 => k <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so k <= 2 since k integer? k = T-6, integer.\n\nk >=2 and k <= 2.958, so k=2.\n\nAt k=2, T=8, as we saw, span [0,23], 0 included.\n\nFor k<2, say k=1, T=7, span [48-24(1), 71-24(1)] = [24,47], 0 not in.\n\nFor k=0, T=6, [48,71], 0 not in.\n\nFor k=3, T=9, span [48-24*3, 71-24*3] = [48-72,71-72] = [-24,-1], 0 not in [-24,-1].\n\n-24 to -1, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly k=4, etc.\n\nSo only at k=2, T=8, 0 is in the span.\n\nTherefore, on freeway 7, it is unsafe only at T=8.\n\nFor other times, it is safe, as long as no other cars, but freeway 7 has only one car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has a similar car.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, head=48, tail=71, left, speed=24.\n\nSo same span at each T: [48-24k, 71-24k] with k=T-6.\n\nUnsafe only at T=8.\n\nNow, for other freeways, I need to check if they have times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut for now, since I want to go up, I need to pass through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=8 also has a car that might be unsafe at some point.\n\nFreeway 8: car span at T: [48-24k, 71-24k] same as y=7.\n\nUnsafe only at T=8.\n\nNow, at y=6, let's see when it is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: at t=6, span [-51,-40], right, speed=4.\n\nAt T, span [-51 +4(k), -40 +4(k)] where k=T-6.\n\n0 in [-51+4k, -40+4k] if -51+4k <=0 and 0<= -40+4k\n\nFirst: -51+4k <=0 => 4k <=51 => k<=12.75\n\nSecond: 0<= -40+4k => 4k>=40 => k>=10\n\nSo for k from 10 to 12 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nk=10, T=16: [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nk=11, T=17: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nk=12, T=18: [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nk=13, T=19: [-51+52, -40+52] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, k<10, e.g. k=9, T=15: [-51+36, -40+36] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nNow second car on y=6: at t=6, span [13,24], right, speed=4.\n\nAt T, [13+4k, 24+4k]\n\nSince min is 13>0, always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 6, unsafe when k=10,11,12, i.e., T=16,17,18.\n\nBut since we are at t=6, and we want minimal turns, H small, probably we don't care about high T.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nI start at t=6, y=5, safe as we saw.\n\nIf I go up directly: t=6, a=U, to y=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=6, need to check freeway 6 at t=7.\n\nt=7, k=1, span first car: [-51+4(1), -40+4(1)] = [-47,-36], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [13+4(1),24+4(1)] = [17,28], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I take U, to y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, unsafe as we saw.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo I cannot do U at t=7.\n\nI could stay or go down at t=7.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 is only unsafe at t=8, I could be on y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I delay going to y=7.\n\nI am at t=7, y=6.\n\nInstead of going up, I could stay on y=6 for a turn.\n\nAt t=7, I am on y=6, safe as above.\n\nIf I take S at t=7, then at t=8, I am still on y=6.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, freeway 6 at t=8.\n\nt=8, k=2, span first car: [-51+4(2), -40+4(2)] = [-51+8, -40+8] = [-43,-32], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can go to y=7.\n\nBut at t=8, if I go to y=7, at t=9 I am on y=7? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=8, I am on y=6 (since I stayed or moved from previous).\n\nAction at t=8: if I take U, then y_{9} = y_8 +1, but at turn t=8, I am on y_8=6.\n\nThen after action, y_9 =7.\n\nAt turn t=9, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, freeway 7 at t=9.\n\nt=9, k=3, span [48-24*3, 71-24*3] = [48-72,71-72] = [-24,-1], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, I can take U to go to y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt turn t=10, I am on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10.\n\nt=10, k=4, span for y=8 car: [48-24*4, 71-24*4] = [48-96,71-96] = [-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, take U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt turn t=11, I am on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nStart t=6, y=5, take U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: on y=6, take S? In this sequence: at t=7, I am on y=6, and I need to not go up immediately.\n\nIn the sequence I thought: at t=7, after taking U at t=6, I am at y=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, I take S (stay), so y_{8} = y_7 +0 =6, so at t=8, I am on y=6.\n\nThen at t=8, I take U, so y_{9} =7, at t=9 on y=7.\n\nThen at t=9, take U, y_{10}=8, at t=10 on y=8.\n\nThen at t=10, take U, y_{11}=9, at t=11 on y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=6: on y=5, safe as before.\n\nt=7: on y=6, k=1, safe as before.\n\nt=8: on y=6, k=2, safe.\n\nt=9: on y=7, k=3, span [-24,-1], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=10: on y=8, k=4, span [-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=11: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo H=6 turns? From t=6 to t=11, that's 6 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=10, 5 actions to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nDefine H as the number of actions.\n\nStart at turn t_1=6, position (0,y_t1) = (0,5)\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position (0, y_{t1+H})\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at t=11, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H =6 + H, and y_{6+H} =9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=6, y=5.\n\nAfter 1 action, t=7, y=6 if U.\n\nAfter 2 actions, t=8, y=6 if S at t=7, or y=7 if U at t=7, etc.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAction at t=6: U, so at t=7, y=6\n\nAction at t=7: S, so at t=8, y=6\n\nAction at t=8: U, so at t=9, y=7\n\nAction at t=9: U, so at t=10, y=8\n\nAction at t=10: U, so at t=11, y=9\n\nSo after 5 actions, at t=11, y=9.\n\nMinimal H is 4, but we have 5, so H=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4?\n\nWith H=4 actions: from y=5 to y=9 in 4 steps, must go up each time, so U,U,U,U.\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=6: y=5, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, safe as before\n\nt=8: y=7, but at t=8, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I go down or something, but to reach y=9 in 4 turns, I must increase by 4, so all U, no choice.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 5, so must go up 4 times.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 is unsafe, so impossible with H=4.\n\nThus minimal H is 5.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have one stay action.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the stay by going through other freeways, but since I have to go through y=7, and only unsafe at t=8, I need to be at y=7 not at t=8.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=8 I would be at y=7 if I went up fast, but I delayed.\n\nAnother idea: go down first, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=5, go down to y=4, then up, but that would take at least 5 turns still, since from 5 to 9 is 4, but if I go down to 4, then to 9 is 5 steps, same as before.\n\ny=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, but I start from 5, so if I go to 4 first, then to 9, it might be 6 actions or more.\n\nBut minimal should be 5.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at t=7 or t=9.\n\nIn direct up, at t=7 I would be at y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=7: that would require starting from higher or something.\n\nAt t=6, I am at y=5, if I take U, to y=6 at t=7.\n\nCannot be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=7 is t=8, by taking U at t=6 and U at t=7.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNext time at y=7 is t=9, by taking actions to be there later.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nPerhaps I can skip y=7? But I have to go from y=6 to y=8 or something, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so I must pass through each integer y.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + {-1,0,1}, so I must go through each level; I cannot skip.\n\nSo I have to be on y=7 at some point.\n\nAnd only unsafe at t=8, so I need to be on y=7 at t≠8.\n\nt=7 not possible, t=9 possible as I have.\n\nt=10 etc, but later.\n\nSo minimal to be at y=7 at t=9.\n\nIn my sequence, I am at y=7 at t=9.\n\nNow, but I also have to check other freeways.\n\nIn the sequence, I also pass through y=8.\n\nAt y=8, freeway 8, similar to y=7, unsafe only at t=8.\n\nAt t=10, I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at t=10, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, what about y=6? I was on y=6 at t=7 and t=8, both safe as per earlier calculation.\n\nNow, but freeway 5: I was on y=5 at t=6, safe.\n\nNow, freeway 4,3,etc? I didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there other cars that might be unsafe at other times?\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, at t=6, safe.\n\nBut suppose I stay longer, but in this sequence, I only on y=5 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=7 and t=8.\n\nAt t=7, k=1, safe; t=8, k=2, safe for y=6.\n\nNow, for y=7, only at t=9, k=3, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=10, k=4, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=11, safe.\n\nNow, but I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: at t=6: U\n\nt=7: S (stay)\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nBut at t=10, I take U to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut after action at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, H=5 actions.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=5 without staying?\n\nFor example, go up, up, but avoid y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut to reach y=9 in 5 actions from y=5, I can have different paths.\n\nFor instance, go up to y=6, then stay, then up, up, up as above.\n\nGo up to y=6, then down to y=5, then up, up, up, but that would take more actions.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=6:\n\nOption: U at t=6 to y=6 at t=7\n\nThen at t=7, instead of stay, go down to y=5 at t=8? But then I am at y=5 at t=8, then I need to go up to 9, which takes 4 more actions, to reach at t=12, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo up to y=7 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nPerhaps start by staying at y=5 for a turn.\n\nBut then later.\n\nFor example, at t=6, take S, so at t=7, y=5 still.\n\nThen at t=7, take U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, safe as before.\n\nThen at t=8, take U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, safe.\n\nThen U at t=9 to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen U at t=10 to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before, but I stayed at t=6 instead of t=7.\n\nStill H=5 actions.\n\nActions: t=6: S, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nThen positions: t=6: y=5, safe\n\nt=7: y=5? At t=6, take S, so y_{7} = y_6 +0 =5, so at t=7, on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=7.\n\nt=7, k=1, freeway 5 cars:\n\nAt t=6, car1: span [-23,-12], right, speed=6\n\nAt T=7, [tau + s(1), h + s(1)] = [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [13,24] at t=6, at T=7 [13+6,24+6]=[19,30], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [49,60] at t=6, at T=7 [49+6,60+6]=[55,66], 0 not in\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at t=7, take U, to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6, as before, safe.\n\nThen U at t=8 to y=7 at t=9, safe.\n\nU at t=9 to y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nU at t=10 to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo same number of actions.\n\nBut in this case, I stayed at the beginning.\n\nEither way, H=5.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I stayed at y=6, in this at y=5.\n\nNow, but I need minimal H, which is 5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? We saw not.\n\nPerhaps I can go through other freeways faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: y=8 also has car, but unsafe only at t=8, which I avoid.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am on y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 5,6, etc., there might be other unsafe times, but in this path, I am not there at those times.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 is unsafe at T=16,17,18, but we are at t=6 to 11, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1,2: at t=6, span [1,48], moving right, speed 48.\n\nAt T, [1+48k, 48+48k] where k=T-6.\n\nSince min is 1+48k >=1>0 for k>=0, always positive, 0 never in span, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: at t=6, span [-35,-24], right, speed 4.\n\nAt T, [-35+4k, -24+4k]\n\n0 in if -35+4k <=0 and 0<= -24+4k\n\nFirst: -35+4k<=0 => 4k<=35 => k<=8.75\n\nSecond: 0<= -24+4k => 4k>=24 => k>=6\n\nSo k=6,7,8\n\nT=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same.\n\nBut we are not on these freeways, so no issue.\n\nFreeway 5: cars as above.\n\nCar1: span at T: [-23+6k, -12+6k]?

But at t=8 I would be on y=7, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo to y=8 directly? No, must go through y=7.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only change by 1.\n\nSo I think H=5 is best.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nLet me write the sequence.\n\nUsing the first sequence I thought: actions at t=6: U, t=7: S, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nThen at t=11, y=9.\n\nTo confirm the positions:\n\nTurn t=6: position (0,5), take action U\n\nTurn t=7: position (0,6), take action S\n\nTurn t=8: position (0,6), take action U\n\nTurn t=9: position (0,7), take action U\n\nTurn t=10: position (0,8), take action U\n\nTurn t=11: position (0,9)\n\nAll safe as checked.\n\nWith stay at beginning: t=6: S, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nThen t=6: (0,5), S, so t=7: (0,5)\n\nt=7: (0,5), U, to t=8: (0,6)\n\nt=8: (0,6), U, to t=9: (0,7)\n\nt=9: (0,7), U, to t=10: (0,8)\n\nt=10: (0,8), U, to t=11: (0,9)\n\nAlso safe.\n\nBut in this case, at t=7, I am on y=5, which is freeway 5, and at t=7, k=1, as above, safe.\n\nBut freeway 5 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but I am not there.\n\nNow, but in this sequence, at t=7 I am on y=5, which is fine.\n\nBut compared to the first sequence, in the first, I was on y=6 at t=7 and t=8.\n\nNow, both are valid.\n\nBut perhaps I can choose the one with no stay, but I have to have a stay somewhere.\n\nIn both, I have one stay action.\n\nIs there a sequence with no stay? With H=5, from y=5 to y=9, net +4, so I must have one action that is not up, either down or stay.\n\nIf I go down, I need to compensate, so H might be larger.\n\nFor example, U,U,D,U,U: at t=6: U to y=6 t=7\n\nt=7: U to y=7 t=8, but at t=8 y=7 unsafe! Collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nU,D,U,U,U: t=6: U to y=6 t=7\n\nt=7: D to y=5 t=8\n\nt=8: U to y=6 t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=7 t=10\n\nt=10: U to y=8 t=11\n\nt=11: need another U to y=9 t=12, so H=6, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal is H=5 with one stay.\n\nNow, for the answer, I think either sequence is fine.\n\nBut in the output format, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nNow, the car on freeway 7 and 8 are both unsafe only at t=8, so as long as I avoid y=7 and y=8 at t=8.\n\nIn my sequences, I am not on y=7 or y=8 at t=8.\n\nIn first sequence, at t=8 I am on y=6.\n\nIn second, at t=8 I am on y=6 after U from y=5.\n\nIn second sequence: at t=8, after U at t=7 from y=5, so y=6 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think I can output one.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can reach faster by going through a different path, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thing: freeway y=3 and y=4 have cars that are unsafe at later times, but not relevant.\n\nOr, if I go down to lower freeways, but that would take more time to go up.\n\nFor example, go to y=4, but y=4 has cars, might have unsafe times, but unnecessary.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nI'll go with the first sequence I thought.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{t_1 +3} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: a_{t_1 +4} = U\n\nt_1 =6, so:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nThe answer should be in a box.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with the turn numbers.\n\nSince t_1=6, it's fine.\n\nTo be general, but in the problem, t_1 is given.\n\nIn the output, it should be with the numbers.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., but since t_1=6, we can write the numbers.\n\nI think it's clear.\n\nPerhaps write with variables, but numbers are fine.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm if at any point I missed something.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=9, I am on y=7, and freeway 7 car at t=9: k=3, span [-24,-1], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10, y=8, freeway 8 car at t=10: k=4, span [-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nt=8, y=6, freeway 6: at t=8, k=2, first car span [-43,-32], second [21,32], both not contain 0.\n\nt=7, y=6, k=1, [-47,-36] and [17,28], no.\n\nt=6, y=5, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I go up without staying on y=6, but I have to delay.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at t=6, I take U to y=6 t=7\n\nThen at t=7, I take U, but to y=7 t=8, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nTake D at t=7 to y=5 t=8, then later up, but more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5, with actions as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 5. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(t = 8\\), when cars on those freeways cover position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn \\(t = 6\\), the player is at \\((0, 5)\\).

Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t = 11\\). Freeway \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 10\\) is safe, as the car span \\([-48, -25]\\) does not contain 0.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 5 turns (from \\(t = 6\\) to \\(t = 10\\) for actions, with position achieved at \\(t = 11\\)).

I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements and when they might be at x=0, since that's where collisions happen. Collision occurs if, at turn T, the player is at some y, and for the car on that freeway y, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. If 0 is in the car's span for that freeway at turn T, it's a collision.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1}, I'm not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway. Freeways are from 1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars there. The goal is (0,9), which is y=9, so that should be safe.\n\nCurrent position: (0,6) at turn 7.\n\nI need to go up to y=9. Since y increases by 1 with U, decreases by 1 with D, or stays with S, and y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nTo minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on freeways 7 and 8, since I'm starting at 6.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are between me and y=9. y=6 to y=9, so freeways 7 and 8 are in between? Let's see: freeways are y=1 to 8, so from y=6 to y=9, I need to cross y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut I start at y=6, and I need to be at y=9. So I need to move to y=7, then y=8, then y=9, or something like that, but I might stay or move down if needed, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help.\n\nThe minimal H should be small, like 3 turns if I can go up directly, but I need to check if that causes collisions.\n\nFirst, at turn 7, I'm at y=6. Now, I need to see if I can stay or move without collision.\n\nBut collision depends on the car positions at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t_1. Let τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1, y=6.\n\nI need to find actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nSince y starts at 6, to reach 9, I need to increase y by 3, so minimum H=3 if I go U,U,U, but might have collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAt τ=0, I take action a_{t_1}, which affects y at τ=1? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, I take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, we look at y_T and the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I take action at turn T to move to y_{T+1}, at turn T I am still at y_T.\n\nNow, for the cars, I need their positions at future turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=7.\n\nFor each car, I have head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96,49, right, 48) — since direction right, and span [τ, h] initially, but at turn t_1.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t_1.\n\nSo for freeway k, at turn t_1, the span is given.\n\nThen at turn T > t_1, span changes based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me define t = t_1 + τ, so τ is offset from current.\n\nAt τ=0, t=t_1=7.\n\nFor a car on freeway i:\n\nGiven initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at τ=0 (t=7).\n\nIf d is left, then span at time τ (relative) is [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], which I think h is head, τ is tail, but in the list, for freeway 1, it says (96,49,right,48), so head=96, tail=49? But for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, for both, h and τ are given, but for left, [h, τ] means h is head (larger x?), but since left-moving, decreasing x.\n\nFor right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h, but it says [τ, h] and then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so if moving right, τ is left end, h is right end? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically, head is front, tail is back.\n\nFor left-moving car, head is at higher x, tail at lower x, so span [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nFrom the description:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h=96, τ=49 for left? But in freeway 1, it's right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: (96,49,right,48) and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] so [49,96] I think? Because it says [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ.\n\nIn freeway 7: (24,47,left,24) so for left, [h,τ] = [24,47], but if left-moving, head should be on the left, so smaller x? I think I'm confusing.\n\nAssume x-axis, increasing to the right.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If direction right: it's moving right, so head is at higher x, tail at lower x. So at t_1, span is [tail, head] = [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: right, h=96, τ=49, so τ=49, h=96, so span [49,96] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, span [49 + s(T-t_1), 96 + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: direction left, moving left, so head is at lower x, tail at higher x? No.\n\nIf moving left, the front (head) is facing left, so as it moves left, head x decreases, tail x decreases.\n\nIn the description, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ, with h and τ, for freeway 7: left, (24,47,left,24), so [h,τ] = [24,47], and moving left, so at T, [24 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT]. Since moving left, head should be the left end, so here h=24 is head (smaller x), τ=47 is tail (larger x), so span [24,47] meaning from x=24 to x=47.\n\nSimilarly for right, freeway 1: [τ,h] = [49,96], so τ=49 tail, h=96 head.\n\nIn the list, for some, it's multiple cars.\n\nBack to the state.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, [49,96] at t=7, speed 48.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (96,49,right,48) so [49,96] at t=7, speed 48.\n\nFreeway 3: (-20,-31,right,4) right-moving, so [τ,h] = [-31,-20]? τ=-31, h=-20, so span [-31,-20] at t=7.\n\nSince moving right, at T, [ -31 +4(T-7), -20 +4(T-7) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as 3? (-20,-31,right,4) so [-31,-20] at t=7, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, each has [τ,h].\n\nFirst car: τ=-17, h=-6? Given (-6,-17,right,6), so head=-6, tail=-17? [τ,h] = [-17,-6] since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (30,19,right,6), so [19,30]? τ=19, h=30.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,6), so [-59,-48]\n\nAll at t=7.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (28,17,right,4)\n\nFirst: [-47,-36], second: [17,28] at t=7, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 7: (24,47,left,24) left-moving, so [h,τ] = [24,47], moving left, speed 24.\n\nAt T, [24 -24(T-7), 47-24(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (24,47,left,24) so [24,47] at t=7.\n\nI need to go from y=6 to y=9. Freeways 7 and 8 are at y=7 and y=8, but I start at y=6, so to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=9 has no freeway, I think, since freeways 1-8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k, and k between 1 and 8, I check the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nIf I am at y=6, I check freeway 6 cars at that turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 6 to 9, difference 3, so if I go up each turn, in 3 turns: from τ=0 to τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=7), I am at y=6.\n\nI take action a_{t_1} = a_7, which determines y_{8} = y_7 + Δy_7.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, get y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn t: we check y_t and freeway y_t at time t.\n\nIf at turn t, y_t = k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at time t, collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn t, if I go to y_{t+1} ≠ y_t, at turn t I am at y_t, so I check freeway y_t at t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, check that freeway at t+1.\n\nNow, I start at t=7, y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t=7+H-1.\n\nH min is 3, so I could be at y=9 at t=9, for example, if I start from t=7.\n\nt=7: y=6\n\nAfter action a7, y8 = y7 + Δy7\n\nThen a8, y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nThen a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nI need y at some turn to be 9.\n\nFor min H, I want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nAt turn t=9, if y9=9, that would be after two actions? Let's see:\n\nAt t=7, y7=6\n\nAfter a7, y8 = 6 + Δy7\n\nAfter a8, y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nAfter a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nI need y something =9.\n\nIf I set y9=9, that means at turn t=9, I am at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, I could be at y=9 at t=8 or earlier, but from y=6, in one action I can go to y=7, not 9, so earliest is t=9 if I go up twice.\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7, if a7=U, y8=7\n\nThen a8=U, y9=8\n\nThen a9=U, y10=9\n\nSo at turn t=9, y=8, t=10 y=9.\n\nTo have y_t=9 at turn t, I need to be there after some actions.\n\nIf I want to be at y=9 at turn t=9, that would require y9=9.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\ny7=6, so if Δy7=1, y8=7\n\nThen if Δy8=1, y9=8\n\nThen if Δy9=1, y10=9\n\nSo at t=9, y=8, t=10 y=9.\n\nI can be at y=9 at t=10 by going U,U,U from t=7 to t=9.\n\nActions at t=7,8,9 to have y10=9.\n\nThen at turn t=10, y=9.\n\nH=3 turns: actions at t=7,8,9 to reach at t=10.\n\nI could stay or something, but that takes longer.\n\nMin H is 3 if possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid collision at each turn when I am on freeway.\n\nIn this path: at t=7, y7=6, on freeway 6.\n\nAt t=8, y8=7, on freeway 7.\n\nAt t=9, y9=8, on freeway 8.\n\nAt t=10, y10=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo I need to ensure that at t=7, when y=6, no collision with freeway 6 cars.\n\nAt t=8, y=7, no collision with freeway 7 cars.\n\nAt t=9, y=8, no collision with freeway 8 cars.\n\nNow, let's check for each.\n\nFirst, at t=7, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars at t=7: [-47,-36] and [17,28]\n\n0 is not in [-47,-36] or [17,28], since -36 < 0 < 17? -36 < 0, but -36 to -47 is negative, all negative, so 0 not in, and 17 to 28, all positive, 0 not in. So at t=7, on y=6, no collision. Good.\n\nNow at t=8, y=8? In the path, at t=8, if I go up from y=6 at t=7, y8=7, so at t=8, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: left-moving car, at t=7, [h,τ] = [24,47]\n\nAt time t, span [24 -24(t-7), 47-24(t-7)]\n\nAt t=8, τ=1, t-7=1, so span [24 -24(1), 47-24(1)] = [0,23]\n\n24-24=0, 47-24=23, so [0,23] at t=8.\n\n0 is in [0,23], since 0 to 23 inclusive? Is 0 included? Span [0,23], 0 is the left end, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nTherefore, at t=8, if I am on y=7, collision because 0 is in the car span.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo if I go up at t=7 to y=7 at t=8, then at t=8, y=7, and freeway 7 car has span [0,23], which includes 0, so collision.\n\nCannot go directly up at t=7.\n\nPerhaps I should not go up immediately.\n\nMaybe stay or go down, but that might delay.\n\nPerhaps at t=7, I stay or something.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince the car moves, at other times it might be safe.\n\nLet me find when freeway 7 is safe at x=0.\n\nFreeway 7: left-moving car, span at time t: [24 -24(t-7), 47-24(t-7)]\n\n0 in span if 24 -24(t-7) <= 0 <= 47-24(t-7)\n\nSince moving left, left end decreasing.\n\nSet L(t) = 24 -24(t-7)\n\nR(t) = 47-24(t-7)\n\n0 in [L(t), R(t)] if L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)\n\nNow L(t) <= 0: 24 -24(t-7) <=0 => 24 <= 24(t-7) => t-7 >=1 => t>=8\n\nR(t) >=0: 47-24(t-7) >=0 => 47 >=24(t-7) => t-7 <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958, so t-7 <=1 since t integer, t-7 <=1, t<=8\n\nt-7 <= floor(47/24)=1, since 24*1=24<47, 24*2=48>47, so t-7 <=1.\n\nL(t) <=0 for t>=8\n\nR(t) >=0 for t-7 <=1, i.e., t<=8\n\nSo 0 in span only when t>=8 and t<=8, so only at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, L(8)=24-24=0, R(8)=47-24=23, 0 in [0,23]\n\nAt t=7, L(7)=24, R(7)=47, both >0, 0 not in\n\nAt t=9, L(9)=24-48= -24, R(9)=47-48= -1, both negative, 0 not in\n\nSimilarly, t<7 not relevant.\n\nSo freeway 7 only has collision at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same car? Freeway 8 also (24,47,left,24), same as freeway 7? In the table, both have identical entries.\n\nFreeway 7: (24,47,left,24)\n\nFreeway 8: (24,47,left,24)\n\nSo same situation.\n\nAt t=8, for freeway 8, also [0,23], 0 in span.\n\nBut at other times, no.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nIf I want to go to y=7 at some turn, I need to be on freeway 7 when t ≠8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, I am at y=6 at t=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go to y=7 at t=7? But at t=7, I am at y=6, not 7.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nTo be on y=7 at turn t, I need to arrive there at that turn.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am at y=6.\n\nI can take action at t=7 to go to y=7 at t=8, or stay at y=6 for t=8, or go down to y=5, etc.\n\nBut y=5 might have cars too.\n\nSince freeway 7 only dangerous at t=8, I should avoid being on y=7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 only dangerous at t=8? Let's check freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, left-moving, [24,47] at t=7, so at t, [24-24(t-7), 47-24(t-7)]\n\nSame as above, only at t=8, [0,23], 0 in span.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSo both freeway 7 and 8 have collision only at t=8.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, at t=7, we have cars, but 0 not in span, as we saw.\n\nWhat about other times? I might be on freeway 6 at other turns.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars, both right-moving.\n\nFirst car: [-47,-36] at t=7, speed 4.\n\nAt time t, span [-47 +4(t-7), -36 +4(t-7)]\n\nSecond car: [17,28] at t=7, speed 4, at t, [17+4(t-7), 28+4(t-7)]\n\n0 in first car span if -47 +4(t-7) <= 0 <= -36 +4(t-7)\n\nBut -36 +4(t-7) <= -36 <0? -36 negative, so upper bound negative, 0 not <= negative, so never true. Since the car is moving right but starts left of 0 and both ends negative at t=7, increasing, but -36 +4(t-7) >=0 when t-7 >=9, since 4*9=36, t=16, but at t=16, lower bound -47+4*9=-47+36=-11<0, upper -36+36=0, so at t=16, [-11,0], 0 included? [ -11,0], 0 is upper end, so 0 in span if inclusive.\n\nAssume inclusive, since tail and head.\n\nAt t=16, [-47+4(9), -36+4(9)] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 in [ -11,0].\n\nSimilarly, for second car, [17,28] at t=7, all positive, 0 not in, and as time increases, moves right, so 0 never in.\n\nBut for first car, at t=16, 0 in span.\n\nBut t=16 is later, might not be issue if I pass early.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways, but I might not stay long.\n\nNow back to reaching y=9.\n\nSince freeways 7 and 8 are only dangerous at t=8, I should not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on y=7 or y=8, collision.\n\nSo I need to be on other y at t=8.\n\nNow, at t=7, I am at y=6.\n\nI can choose action at t=7.\n\nIf I go up, to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8, y=7, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=6 at t=8.\n\nIf I go down, y=5 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, if y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=8: t-7=1, so first car: [-47+4(1), -36+4(1)] = [-43,-32], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [17+4,28+4]=[21,32], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=5, need to check freeway 5 at t=8.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince min turns, perhaps I can go to y=7 at t=7? But at t=7, I am at y=6, not 7.\n\nI can only be at y=7 at t=8 or later, by moving up.\n\nEarliest to be at y=7 is t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, if I go to y=7, collision.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nNow, at t=9, I can be at y=7, for example.\n\nAt t=9, freeway 7: as before, L(9)=24-24(2)=24-48=-24, R(9)=47-48=-1, [-24,-1], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=9: t-7=2, first car [-47+8, -36+8]=[-39,-28], 0 not in; second [17+8,28+8]=[25,36], safe.\n\nNow, I am at t=7, y=6.\n\nOption: at t=7, I stay (S), so at t=8, y=6 still.\n\nThen at t=8, I am at y=6, freeway 6, which is safe as above.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAction at t=8: U, so y9=7.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, freeway 7, which at t=9 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=9, I take action, say U, to go to y=8 at t=10.\n\ny10=8 if a9=U.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10: t-7=3, L(10)=24-24(3)=24-72=-48, R(10)=47-72=-25, [-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, I can take U to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, I take U, y11=9.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut this took more turns: from t=7 to t=11, actions at t=7,8,9,10? Let's list turns.\n\nt=7: start y=6\n\na7: S (stay), so y8=6\n\nt=8: a8: U, so y9=7\n\nt=9: a9: U, so y10=8\n\nt=10: a10: U, so y11=9\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nSo H=4 turns: actions at t=7,8,9,10 to reach at t=11.\n\nBut earlier min was 3, but not possible due to collision.\n\nCan I do in 3 turns?\n\nH=3 actions: say at t=7,8,9, then y at t=8,9,10.\n\nI need y10=9.\n\ny10=9, so y9 must be 8 or 9, but since actions, if y9=8 and a9=U, y10=9.\n\nOr y9=9, but from y7=6, y9=9 only if I go up twice, but y9 = y8 + Δy8, y8 = y7 + Δy7.\n\ny7=6, so if Δy7=1, y8=7; if Δy8=1, y9=8; then if Δy9=1, y10=9.\n\nSo y9=8, y10=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=8.\n\nBut at t=9, if y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=9, freeway 8: as above, for t=9, τ=2, L(9)=24-48=-24, R(9)=47-48=-1, [-24,-1], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, where am I?\n\nIn this sequence: if I go up at t=7 to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8, y=7, collision as we saw.\n\nIf at t=7 I do not go up, but stay or down, then y8=6 or 5.\n\nThen at t=8, I need to get to higher y.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I stay, y8=6.\n\nThen at t=8, I go up, y9=7.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, which is safe for freeway 7 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, I go up to y10=8? But I need y10=9 for H=3.\n\ny10=9 requires y9=8 and a9=U.\n\nBut from above, at t=9, y=7, then a9=U, y10=8, not 9.\n\nThen to get to 9, need another action.\n\nSo with H=3 actions, y10=9, which requires y9=8.\n\ny9=8 means at t=9, y=8.\n\nBut to have y9=8, from y7=6.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\nIf Δy7=1, y8=7; then to y9=8, need Δy8=1.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, collision.\n\nIf Δy7=0, y8=6; then to y9=8, need Δy8=2, but Δy only -1,0,1, so impossible to go from 6 to 8 in one step. y9 = y8 + Δy8, y8=6, Δy8 <=1, so y9<=7, cannot be 8.\n\nSimilarly, if Δy7=-1, y8=5, y9<=6, worse.\n\nSo impossible to have y9=8 or y9=9 directly.\n\nThus, with actions at t=7,8,9, the earliest y can be 9 is at t=10, with y10=9.\n\nAnd to have y10=9, we need y9=8 or 9, but y9=9 impossible from y7=6 in two steps, min y9=8 if two ups.\n\ny9=8 requires y8=7 and Δy8=1.\n\nBut y8=7 requires that at t=8, y=7, which causes collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by t=10 with three actions without collision.\n\nThus minimal H must be at least 4.\n\nWith H=4 actions, as I had: stay at t=7, then up at t=8, up at t=9, up at t=10, to be at y=11=9? t=10 action to y11.\n\nActions at t=7,8,9,10: y at t=8,9,10,11.\n\nAt t=7: y7=6\n\na7: S, Δy=0, y8=6\n\na8: U, Δy=1, y9=7\n\na9: U, Δy=1, y10=8\n\na10: U, Δy=1, y11=9\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nCollision checks:\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6: at t=7, cars [-47,-36] and [17,28], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=6 (since stayed), freeway 6: at t=8, as before [-43,-32] and [21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7: at t=9, span [-24,-1], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8: at t=10, span [-48,-25]? Earlier: for freeway 8 at t=10, t-7=3, [24-24*3, 47-24*3]=[24-72,47-72]=[-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen t=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo this works with H=4.\n\nBut can I do better? H=4 is minimal since H=3 impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can go up later or something, but H=4 seems necessary.\n\nMaybe I can go to y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of staying, I go down to y=5, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=7, I go down to y=5 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nNeed to check freeway 5 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars, all right-moving.\n\nAt t=7: first car: (-6,-17,right,6), so [τ,h]=[-17,-6]? head=-6, tail=-17, so [-17,-6]\n\nSecond: (30,19,right,6), [19,30]\n\nThird: (-48,-59,right,6), [-59,-48]\n\nAt t=8, t-7=1, so:\n\nFirst car: [-17+6(1), -6+6(1)] = [-11,0]\n\n-17+6=-11, -6+6=0, so [-11,0], 0 in span? Yes, 0 is included.\n\nSecond car: [19+6,30+6]=[25,36], 0 not in\n\nThird: [-59+6,-48+6]=[-53,-42], 0 not in\n\nSo at t=8, on freeway 5, if y=5, and first car has [ -11,0], 0 in span, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on freeway 5 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nBut in our case, if I go down at t=7 to y=5 at t=8, collision.\n\nIf I stay or up, better to stay as before.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at t=9, as I did.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 7 and 8 are safe except t=8, I could go directly to y=8 or something, but I need to pass through.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I go up to y=7 at t=8, but collision, not possible.\n\nAt t=7, I stay, y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, instead of going up to y=7 at t=9, I could go up twice? But actions are per turn.\n\nAt t=8, I take action, Δy8, to y9.\n\nIf I take U, y9=7.\n\nThen at t=9, I take U, y10=8.\n\nThen at t=10, U, y11=9, same as before.\n\nAt t=8, if I take U, y9=7, but I need to be at y=9 faster.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can delay less.\n\nAnother thought: at t=7, I go down to y=5 at t=8, but at t=8, freeway 5 has collision as we saw, so not good.\n\nAt t=7, I go down to y=5 only if safe, but at t=8 not safe.\n\nWhen is freeway 5 safe?\n\nFirst car on freeway 5: at t, [-17 +6(t-7), -6 +6(t-7)]\n\n0 in span if -17+6(t-7) <=0 <= -6+6(t-7)\n\nSince -6+6(t-7) >=0 when t-7>=1, i.e. t>=8\n\nAnd -17+6(t-7) <=0 when t-7 <= 17/6≈2.833, so t-7<=2, t<=9\n\nSo 0 in span for t=8,9? At t=8: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt t=9: [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 in? -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt t=10: [-17+18, -6+18]=[1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, t=7: [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 5 first car has 0 in span at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=9: [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=10: [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly, other cars on freeway 5: second car [19+6(t-7),30+6(t-7)], all positive for t>=7, 0 not in.\n\nThird car [-59+6(t-7),-48+6(t-7)], at t=7: [-59,-48], negative, at t=10: [-59+18,-48+18]=[-41,-30], still negative, never reach 0 since speed 6, but -48 +6*8= -48+48=0, at t=15? t-7=8, -48+48=0, lower -59+48=-11, so [-11,0] at t=15, but later.\n\nBut for now, at t=8 and 9, freeway 5 has collision due to first car.\n\nSo not good to be on y=5 at t=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have issues, but I think staying at y=6 is fine.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nWith H=4, I have a sequence: S at t=7, U at t=8, U at t=9, U at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, action U to go to y=11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=7, H=4, so actions at t=7,8,9,10.\n\nAnd reach at t=11.\n\nBut can I reach earlier? With H=4, it's at t=11.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=10, I need y10=9.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\ny7=6\n\nIf I can have y8=7, but at t=8, y=7 collision, not possible.\n\ny8=6, y9=7 or 8, but y9=8 impossible as before.\n\ny8=6, y9=7 (if Δy8=1), then y10=8 if Δy9=1, or 9 if impossible.\n\nSo y10=8 at best, not 9.\n\nThus, earliest to be at y=9 is t=11 with the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can skip y=7 or y=8 when dangerous, but I have to cross them.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I go up to y=7 at t=8, but collision, not possible.\n\nUnless I move so fast, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 at t=9, as before.\n\nBut in that case, with the sequence, H=4.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with H=3 by being at y=9 at t=10, but y10=9 requires y9=8 and U, but y9=8 requires y8=7 and U, but y8=7 at t=8 collision.\n\nIf I could have y8=8, but from y7=6, impossible in one step.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus minimal H is 4.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I used S, U, U, U.\n\nBut at t=9, I am at y=7, freeway 7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 8 at t=10.\n\nt=10, freeway 8: as above, [24-24(3),47-24(3)]=[24-72,47-72]=[-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by going up at t=7 to y=7, but collision, no.\n\nAnother possibility: at t=7, I stay, but at t=8, instead of going to y=7, I go directly to y=8? But I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think H=4 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions at t=7, t=8, t=9, t=10.\n\nt=7: S (stay)\n\nt=8: U (up)\n\nt=9: U (up)\n\nt=10: U (up)\n\nThen at t=11, y=9.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn t=11.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=4, so actions for turn 7,8,9,10.\n\nNow, but let me write it.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=9, I am at y=7, and I go U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, I am at y=8, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=10, I go U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nPerhaps I can combine, but no.\n\nMaybe I can go to y=9 earlier by using down or something, but no, down would delay.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=7, I go down to y=5 at t=8, but at t=8, freeway 5 collision, not possible.\n\nAt t=7, I go down to y=5 only if I can avoid collision, but at t=8 not safe.\n\nSuppose I go down at t=7 to y=5 at t=8, but collision at t=8 on y=5.\n\nThen not good.\n\nPerhaps at t=7, I stay, then at t=8, I stay or something, but that delays more.\n\nFor example, if at t=8, I stay at y=6, then later go up.\n\nBut then it takes more turns.\n\nFor instance, t=7 S, y8=6\n\nt=8 S, y9=6\n\nThen t=9 U, y10=7\n\nt=10 U, y11=8\n\nt=11 U, y12=9, takes 5 turns, worse.\n\nSo the first sequence is better.\n\nThus, minimal H=4 with actions: t=7: S, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nNow, but let me check if at t=9, when I am on freeway 7, is there any issue? Freeway 7 at t=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at t=9 directly, but from y=6 at t=8, I can only go to y=7 at t=9 if U, or y=6 or 5.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, after t=10 U, I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut the turn when I reach is t=11.\n\nBut the actions are up to t=10.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach in fewer by not going through y=7 and y=8 at dangerous times.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, and I can be there, but I need to get there.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I stay, then at t=8, I go up to y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, I go up to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, I am at y=8, freeway 8, which at t=10 is safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 at t=11, so still four actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=9, if I could go directly to y=9, but cannot.\n\nSo I think it's fixed.\n\nThus, minimal H is 4.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 + 3} = U\n\nWith t_1=7, so:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we reach at turn 11 after the actions.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have H actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=4.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I reach at turn 10.\n\nBut to reach at turn 10, y10=9.\n\ny10=9 requires y9=8 or 9.\n\ny9=9 impossible from start.\n\ny9=8 requires y8=7 and a8=U.\n\nBut y8=7 requires that at t=8, y=7, collision.\n\nIf y8=8, impossible.\n\nSo cannot reach at turn 10.\n\nEarliest at turn 11.\n\nThus, H=4 is minimal.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the car on freeway 6 at other times, but in the sequence, I am on y=6 at t=7 and t=8, both safe.\n\nt=7: freeway 6 cars [-47,-36] and [17,28], 0 not in.\n\nt=8: [-47+4(1), -36+4(1)] = [-43,-32], 0 not in; and [17+4,28+4]=[21,32], 0 not in.\n\nt=9: I am at y=7, not on 6.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=9: [24-24(2),47-24(2)]=[24-48,47-48]=[-24,-1], 0 not in.\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8: [24-24(3),47-24(3)]=[24-72,47-72]=[-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence, like going down first, but it might not be faster and could have risks.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I go down to y=5, but at t=8, on y=5, freeway 5 has car at [-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=7, I go up, but collision, not possible.\n\nSo only way is to stay or down, but down may cause issues.\n\nThus, the sequence with stay and then up three times is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have S at t=7, then U at t=8, U at t=9, U at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, action U, to y10=8.\n\nThen U at t=10 to y11=9.\n\nPerhaps I can have fewer actions by not staying, but I have to avoid t=8 on y=7.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, I go up to y=7 at t=8, but since collision, not possible.\n\nUnless the car is not there, but it is.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at t=7, but I am at y=6.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's settled.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4, with actions: S, U, U, U for turns 7,8,9,10.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the output format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe turn labels: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nWith t_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: S  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I should specify H, but in the answer, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, it seems only the sequence, but H is implied.\n\nLooking back: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} ... }\"\n\nIt shows only the sequence, but H is the number of turns, which is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=7 to t=10, that's 4 actions.\n\nAnd it reaches at turn 11, but the turns covered are 4 turns of actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I reach in H=3, but we saw impossible.\n\nSuppose at t=7, I go up, but collision at t=8, so invalid.\n\nIf I go down at t=7 to y=5 at t=8, collision at t=8 on y=5.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=7, I stay, then at t=8, I go up to y=7 at t=9, which is safe, then at t=9, I go up to y=8 at t=10, then I need another action to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nStill H=4.\n\nAt t=9, if I go U, y10=8, not 9.\n\nSo I must have four actions.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 4.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 4, as it is impossible to reach in fewer turns without colliding with cars on the freeways.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 7, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\). This avoids collision on freeway 6 at turn 7, as the cars are at \\([-47, -36]\\) and \\([17, 28]\\), and 0 is not in either span.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9. At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 6\\), and freeway 6 is safe, with cars at \\([-43, -32]\\) and \\([21, 32]\\) (since \\(t - 7 = 1\\)), and 0 is not in either span.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10. At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 7\\), and freeway 7 is safe, with the car span at \\([-24, -1]\\) (since \\(t - 7 = 2\\)), and 0 is not in the span.\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 8\\), and freeway 8 is safe, with the car span at \\([-48, -25]\\) (since \\(t - 7 = 3\\)), and 0 is not in the span.\n\nAt turn 11, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), which has no freeway and is safe.\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}",

I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=8, and I need to project their positions to future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's check the rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, for t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so at T, it should be [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nFor freeway 1: d=right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] with τ=-95, h=-48, s=48.\n\nSo [ -95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8) ]\n\nSimplify: 48(T-8) -95 to 48(T-8) -48\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to know when 0 is in this span for collision.\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k and 0 is in Span_k(T).\n\nThe player is on freeway y at turn T, so for that y, if 0 is in the car's span for that freeway at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered by a car at turn T.\n\nLet me handle each freeway one by one.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, car: h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48\n\nSpan at T: [ -95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8) ]\n\nSet min and max:\n\nLet delta = T-8, so for T>8, delta >=1? T starts from t_1=8, but for future turns, T>8.\n\nAt turn T, the position is for that turn.\n\nSo for collision, we care about when 0 is in [low, high] where low = -95 + 48(delta), high = -48 + 48(delta) with delta = T-8.\n\nSo 0 in [ -95 + 48(delta), -48 + 48(delta) ]\n\nWhich means:\n\n-95 + 48(delta) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(delta)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst: -95 + 48(delta) <= 0 => 48(delta) <= 95 => delta <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so delta <=1 since delta integer? delta = T-8, T integer, so delta integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer, so delta integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -48 + 48(delta) => 48(delta) >= 48 => delta >=1\n\nAnd first inequality: -95 + 48(delta) <=0 => 48 delta <=95 => delta <= 95/48 = 1.979, so since delta integer, delta <=1.\n\ndelta >=1 and delta <=1, so delta=1.\n\nThen at delta=1, T=9, low = -95 +48(1) = -95+48= -47\n\nHigh = -48 +48(1) =0\n\n-48 +48 =0, so [ -47, 0 ]? Low = -95 +48 = -47, high = -48 +48 =0, so span at T=9: [ -47, 0 ]\n\n0 is included, since high=0.\n\n0 <=0 is true.\n\nSo at T=9, 0 is in [ -47, 0 ], so collision if player on freeway 1 at T=9.\n\nBut player position y_T depends on actions.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\ndelta=1 only.\n\nAt delta=0, T=8, span: [ -95 +0, -48 +0] = [ -95, -48], 0 not in this, since all negative.\n\nAt delta=2, T=10, low = -95 +48*2 = -95+96=1, high= -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=9, freeway 1 has car covering 0.\n\nNow freeway 2: similar, same as freeway 1? Cars: (-48,-95,right,48) same as freeway 1.\n\nSo identical, only at T=9, collision if on freeway 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3, car: (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nd=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(delta), h + s(delta)] = [-27 + 4(delta), -16 + 4(delta)]\n\n0 in this when:\n\n-27 +4 delta <= 0 <= -16 +4 delta\n\nFirst: -27 +4 delta <=0 => 4 delta <=27 => delta <= 27/4=6.75, so delta <=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16 +4 delta => 4 delta >=16 => delta >=4\n\nSo delta from 4 to 6 inclusive.\n\nThus at T=8+4=12, T=13, T=14.\n\nDelta=4,5,6; T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=12, delta=4, span: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=13, delta=5, [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14, delta=6, [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15, delta=7, [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 3 has car at 0 at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 4: similar to freeway 3? Cars: (-16,-27,right,4) same as freeway 3.\n\nSo identical, car at 0 at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nThree cars on freeway 5.\n\nEach can cover 0 at different times.\n\nFirst car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s delta, h + s delta] = [-11 +6 delta, 0 +6 delta] = [-11 +6 delta, 6 delta]\n\n0 in this when:\n\n-11 +6 delta <= 0 <= 6 delta\n\nSince 0 <= 6 delta always for delta >=0, but at delta=0, T=8, span [-11,0], 0 included? 0 <=0 true.\n\n-11 +6 delta <=0 => 6 delta <=11 => delta <=11/6≈1.833, so delta <=1\n\nAnd 0 <= 6 delta, so delta >=0\n\nBut at delta=0: -11 +0 <=0 <=0? 0 <=0 true, and -11<=0 true.\n\nAt delta=1: -11+6= -5 <=0 <=6, true.\n\nAt delta=2: -11+12=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo first car covers 0 at delta=0 and delta=1, T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8: delta=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=9: delta=1, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=10: [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (36,25,right,6)\n\nh=36, τ=25, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s delta, h + s delta] = [25 +6 delta, 36 +6 delta]\n\nSince both min and max increase, min=25+6delta >=25>0 for delta>=0, so never <=0, so 0 never in this span. This car is always to the right, no issue.\n\nThird car: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nh=-42, τ=-53, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan: [ -53 +6 delta, -42 +6 delta]\n\n0 in this when:\n\n-53 +6 delta <=0 <= -42 +6 delta\n\nFirst: -53 +6 delta <=0 => 6 delta <=53 => delta <=53/6≈8.833, so delta <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +6 delta => 6 delta >=42 => delta >=7\n\nSo delta from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nT=8+7=15, T=16.\n\nAt T=15, delta=7, span: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=16, delta=8, [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=17, [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSo for freeway 5, cars cover 0 at:\n\n- First car: T=8,9\n\n- Third car: T=15,16\n\n- Second car never.\n\nSo overall, freeway 5 has collision at 0 when player on it at T=8,9,15,16.\n\nBut T=8 is current turn, player is at y=6, not on freeway 5, so for future, we care about T>8? At turn T, if player moves to freeway 5, then collision if at that T, 0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 6: cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nFirst car: τ=-43, h=-32, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan: [ -43 +4 delta, -32 +4 delta]\n\n0 in: -43+4delta <=0 <= -32+4delta\n\nFirst: -43+4delta <=0 => 4delta <=43 => delta <=10.75, delta <=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32+4delta => 4delta >=32 => delta >=8\n\nSo delta=8,9,10\n\nT=16,17,18\n\nAt T=16, delta=8, span: [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=17, [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=18, [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4), span [21+4delta, 32+4delta], min=21>0, never cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 6 collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, car: (0,23,left,24)\n\nd=left, so left-moving.\n\nRule: left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nh=0, τ=23, s=24\n\nSpan(t_1) = [h, τ] = [0,23] at t_1, I think? From the rule, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], then Span(T) = [h - s delta, τ - s delta]\n\nYes.\n\nSo at T, Span(T) = [0 - 24 delta, 23 - 24 delta] = [-24 delta, 23 - 24 delta]\n\nNow, 0 in this span when:\n\n-24 delta <= 0 <= 23 - 24 delta\n\nNow, -24 delta <=0 always true since delta >=0.\n\nAnd 0 <= 23 - 24 delta => 24 delta <=23 => delta <= 23/24 ≈ 0.958, so for integer delta, delta <=0 only? delta=0.\n\nAt delta=0, T=8, span [0,23], 0 included.\n\nAt delta=1, T=9, span [-24, -1], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=8, freeway 7 has car at 0.\n\nBut T=8 is current turn, player at y=6, not on freeway 7.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar, cars: (0,23,left,24) same as freeway 7.\n\nSo only at T=8, collision if on it, but player not.\n\nNow, summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous only at T=9\n\n- y=2: dangerous only at T=9\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=9,15,16 (T=8 is past, not future for movement)\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=16,17,18\n\n- y=7: dangerous only at T=8, not future\n\n- y=8: dangerous only at T=8, not future\n\nFor movement, we start from t_1=8, player at y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe always.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, player is on y=6, but is there a car on y=6 at T=8?\n\nFreeway 6 at T=8: cars, for y=6, at T=8, delta=0.\n\nFirst car: span [-43, -32], 0 not in, since negative.\n\nSecond car: [21,32], positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=8, freeway 6 is safe, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at T=8: y=1: [-95,-48], safe; y=2 same; y=3: [-27,-16], safe; y=4 same; y=5: first car [-11,0], 0 included, so dangerous, but player not on y=5; y=7: [0,23], dangerous, but player not on; y=8 similar.\n\nBut player on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, actions: we need to move to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay).\n\nSince y=6 to y=9, need to go up, but with obstacles.\n\ny must be integer, from 0 to 9.\n\nAt each turn, after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nCollision depends on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, note: when moving, at turn T, after action, you are on y_{T} for collision check? Let's see.\n\nFrom the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T), so on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd if for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span, then collision.\n\nAlso, the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so cars on y_T matter, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says about moving to different freeway: at turn T, you are on y_T, so cars on y_T are checked. If you move, at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} don't affect at turn T.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, it's only based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at T.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nPlayer starts at T=8, y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 6 to 9, minimum 3 turns if we go up each time: U,U,U to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, what are the dangerous times for each y:\n\n- y=1: T=9 only\n\n- y=2: T=9 only\n\n- y=3: T=12,13,14\n\n- y=4: T=12,13,14\n\n- y=5: T=9,15,16\n\n- y=6: T=16,17,18\n\n- y=7: no dangerous times after T=8 (only T=8 dangerous, but past)\n\n- y=8: similarly, no dangerous times after T=8\n\n- y=9: always safe\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe for all T>8.\n\ny=7 only dangerous at T=8, but for T>8, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=16,17,18, but safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, to go from y=6 to y=9.\n\nShortest path: up to y=7 at T=9, then to y=8 at T=10, then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut need to check if any collision.\n\nFirst, at T=8, start at y=6, safe.\n\nAction at T=8: if we do U, then at T=9, y=7.\n\nAt T=9, y=7.\n\nIs y=7 dangerous at T=9? From above, y=7 has no dangerous times after T=8, so safe.\n\nThen at T=9, action, if we do U again, then at T=10, y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=10, safe, since only dangerous at T=8.\n\nThen at T=10, action U, at T=11, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, check if during this, any collision.\n\nAt T=8: y=6, safe.\n\nAfter U, at T=9: y=7, freeway 7, at T=9, is there car? Freeway 7 at T=9: delta=1, span [-24, -1], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=9, action U, to y=8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=8, freeway 8, at T=10: delta=2, span for left-moving: h=0,τ=23,s=24, Span(T)= [h - s delta, τ - s delta] = [0 - 24*2, 23 - 24*2] = [-48, 23-48] = [-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, action U, to y=9 at T=11.\n\ny=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo in three turns: actions at T=8,9,10: U,U,U to positions T=9:y=7, T=10:y=8, T=11:y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns? From t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=8, we start action at t_1, then after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1, player is at position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,6)\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1} to get y_{t_1 +1}\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1 + t}\n\nAfter applying H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the turn when position is set: at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action at turn T, position for turn T+1 is set.\n\nAt turn t_1=8, position is given.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1} to determine y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen action a_{t_1 +1} to determine y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at some turn, y_T =9 for T <= t_1 + H, but since we apply actions up to t_1 + H -1, the last position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, resulting in y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, from above, with actions at T=8,9,10: U,U,U\n\nThen positions:\n\nAfter a_8 (U): at T=9, y=7\n\nAfter a_9 (U): at T=10, y=8\n\nAfter a_10 (U): at T=11, y=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9, so we reached at turn t_1 + 3, since t_1=8, T=11=8+3.\n\nH=3 actions: a8, a9, a10.\n\nt_1 + H = 8 + 3 =11, y=9.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt each turn T, when we are at y_T, check if collision.\n\nAt T=8: y=6, freeway 6, at T=8, as before, no car at 0, safe.\n\nAt T=9: y=7, freeway 7, at T=9, span [-24,-1], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt T=10: y=8, freeway 8, at T=10, span [-48,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt T=11: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 3 turns with U,U,U.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWhat about freeway 5 or others? But we never on them, so no problem.\n\nThe dangerous times are for other freeways, but since we not on them, fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the cars.\n\nFor example, at T=9, freeway 5 is dangerous, but we are on y=7, not y=5, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo H=3, actions: a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=3, t=0,1,2: a8, a9, a10.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, and sequence.\n\nBut is H=3 possible? Seems so.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nMaybe we need to avoid other things.\n\nAnother point: the player can only move to adjacent y or stay, so from y=6, to go to y=9, must pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe at all times after T=8, as we saw.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at T=8, but at T=9 and later, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nIn our path, at T=9 we are on y=7, which is safe; T=10 on y=8 safe; T=11 on y=9.\n\nAnd no other constraints.\n\nBut let me check if at T=9, if we were on y=5 or something, but we are not.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, it is dangerous at T=16,17,18, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSo I think H=3 is achievable.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at T=11.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if staying or down is needed, but no need, since up is direct.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: at (0,6), and cars.\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed the car positions.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 at T=9: first car span [-11 +6(1), 0+6(1)] = [-5,6], which includes 0, so if on y=5 at T=9, collision.\n\nBut we are on y=7 at T=9, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, other dangerous points are later or for other y.\n\ny=3 and y=4 dangerous at T=12-14, but we not on them.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? For example, if we had to avoid something, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps at T=8, if we stay, but that would delay, not minimal.\n\nOr down, but down to y=5, which might be dangerous.\n\nFor example, if at T=8 we do D, to y=5 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=5, but freeway 5 dangerous at T=9, as above, so collision.\n\nIf we do S at T=8, stay y=6 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, is it dangerous? Freeway 6 at T=9: delta=1, for first car: [-43+4(1), -32+4(1)] = [-39,-28], 0 not in; second car [21+4,32+4]=[25,36], 0 not in, so safe. But then we still need to go to y=9, so more turns.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo U,U,U is best.\n\nBut the answer format should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t1+2} = U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut t_1=8.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify H.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the format: for each turn.\n\nNow, but let me double-check if at T=9 on y=7 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 7: left-moving, at T=9, t1=8, delta=1.\n\nh=0, τ=23, s=24.\n\nSpan(T) = [h - s delta, τ - s delta] = [0 - 24*1, 23 - 24*1] = [-24, -1]\n\n0 not in [-24,-1], since -1 <0? -1 to -24, all negative, 0 > -1? 0 not <= -1? The span is [-24, -1], which is from -24 to -1, so 0 is not in this interval since 0 > -1.\n\nSimilarly, min=-24, max=-1, 0 not between.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=10: delta=2, span [0-48, 23-48] = [-48,-25], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, at T=9, if we were there, but we not.\n\nAnother thing: the player at T=8 is at y=6, but if we move to y=7 at T=9, we are not on y=7 at T=8, so no issue with cars on y=7 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, we on y=6.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=3.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if we can go faster, but we can't, since we need to move up three times.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1,-1,0 per turn.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nBut let me see if H=2 possible? To reach y=9 in two actions.\n\nFrom y=6, after two actions, y_{10} = ?\n\nIf U at T=8, y9=7; then U at T=9, y10=8; not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=10, need y_{10}=9.\n\nFrom y8=6, after a8 and a9, y10.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=7; then a9=U, y10=8; not 9.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=7; then a9=S, y10=7, still not 9.\n\nIf a8=D, y9=5; then a9=U, y10=6, not 9.\n\nNo way to reach y=9 in two actions from y=6.\n\nMinimal three actions to increase by three.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the car state has multiple cars, but in this path, we avoid all.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at some time, but no.\n\nAnother point: freeway 6 is dangerous at T=16-18, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3, sequence: U at t1, U at t1+1, U at t1+2.\n\nSo for the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"a_{t_1 + t}\" but with subscript.\n\nIn text, we can write as above.\n\nSince t1=8, we specify.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the answer, it should be clear.\n\nPerhaps write the turns.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 at T=9.\n\nSpan [-24,-1], all x<0, 0 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I misread the direction.\n\nFreeway 7: left-moving, at T=9, moving left, so positions decreasing.\n\nFrom [0,23] at T=8, to [-24,-1] at T=9, so yes, all left of 0.\n\nNo car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) at turn \\(T\\) and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Dangerous Freeways and Times\nThe car states at \\(t_1 = 8\\) are used to determine when each freeway has a car covering position 0 at future turns (\\(T > 8\\)):\n- **Freeway 1**: Dangerous only at \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Dangerous only at \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 3**: Dangerous at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Dangerous at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Dangerous at \\(T = 9, 15, 16\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Dangerous at \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\).\n- **Freeway 7**: Safe for all \\(T > 8\\) (only dangerous at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Safe for all \\(T > 8\\) (only dangerous at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- **Freeway 9**: Always safe (no cars).\n\nThe player begins at \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 8\\), which is safe (no car covers 0 on freeway 6 at \\(T = 8\\)). The goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible.\n\n### Minimal Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\)\nThe shortest path requires increasing \\(y\\) from 6 to 9, which takes at least 3 turns (since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most ±1). The sequence of actions \\(U, U, U\\) achieves this:\n- At \\(T = 8\\), apply \\(a_8 = U\\): Move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 9\\).\n- At \\(T = 9\\), apply \\(a_9 = U\\): Move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 10\\).\n- At \\(T = 10\\), apply \\(a_{10} = U\\): Move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\).\n\n### Collision Check\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 at \\(T = 8\\) has spans \\([-43, -32]\\) and \\([21, 32]\\), neither contains 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 at \\(T = 9\\) has span \\([-24, -1]\\) (left-moving car), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 at \\(T = 10\\) has span \\([-48, -25]\\) (left-moving car), which does not contain 0. Safe.\n- **Turn 11 (\\(y = 9\\))**: No cars, safe.\n\nThis path avoids all dangerous freeways at critical times and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in \\(H = 3\\) turns. No shorter path is possible, as reaching \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 6\\) requires at least three upward moves.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- \\(H = 3\\) turns (actions at \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 2\\)).\n- Actions: \\(a_8 = U\\), \\(a_9 = U\\), \\(a_{10} = U\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 8: a_{8} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: a_{9} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: a_{10} = U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1 in y), down (D: -1 in y), or stay (S: 0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the same as the y-coordinate) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering the x=0 position.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on the freeway y (so we check the cars on freeway y at turn T). Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on freeway y'. Therefore, we do not check the freeway y' at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1 (which is turn 9). We need to compute the car positions at any future turn T (relative to t1) by:\n  For a car at turn t1: head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n  At turn T (>= t1), the car's position is:\n      If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      If right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving is given as (head, tail) = (h, tau) and then the span is [h, tau] for left? Actually, the update rule says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for left-moving subtracts s*(T-t1) so the entire car moves left. Similarly, right-moving adds.\n\nBut note the initial representation for left-moving: the example for freeway 7: (-24, -1, left, 24). The span at t1 is [h, tau] = [-24, -1]? But then at turn T, it becomes [-24 - 24*(T-9), -1 - 24*(T-9)]. However, we are told that at turn T, collision occurs if 0 is in the span.\n\nWe must check for each freeway that the player is on at a given turn, whether at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn t1 (9) to turn t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1 the player is at y=9.\n\nCurrent y = 7. We can only move one step per turn. So we must go from 7 to 9. The minimal H would be at least 2 (if we can move up twice). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe must simulate the future turns and check the car positions.\n\nLet's denote the relative time: let t = T - t1, so at the current time (turn 9) we have t=0.\n\nAt t=0 (turn 9): player at y=7.\n\nWe are going to simulate for t=0,1,2,... until we can get to y=9.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8 (since the goal is at y=9, which is above freeway 8, and we start at 7). Note that the player is never on freeway 0 or 9? Actually, the grid has y=0 to 9. But the freeways are from y=1 to 8? The problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". So when the player is on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? Then we are safe? But note that the goal is at (0,9) and we start at (0,7). The player must traverse through the freeways 7 and 8 (and possibly others if we go down).\n\nBut note: if we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't have to worry about cars. However, we start at y=7 and we are going to y=9, so we will be at y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions when at y=7 and y=8.\n\nLet's compute the car positions for freeways 7 and 8 at future turns (relative to t1=9, so at absolute turn T = 9 + t, for t=0,1,2,...).\n\nFirst, freeway 7: \n  Cars: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\n  For left-moving: the span at time T (absolute) is:\n      [h - s*(T-9), tau - s*(T-9)] = [-24 - 24*(T-9), -1 - 24*(T-9)]\n\n  We need to check if 0 is in this interval at the turn when the player is on freeway 7.\n\n  The player is at freeway 7 at the current turn (t=0) and possibly at future turns if we stay or come back? But we are going upward so we will leave freeway 7 after the first move? Actually:\n\n      At turn 9 (t=0): we are at y=7 -> so we are on freeway 7 at turn 9.\n\n      Then we take an action at turn 9 to move to y=6,7, or 8? \n\n      But note: we are at turn 9: we are going to choose an action for turn 9. Then at the next turn (turn 10) the player will be at the new y.\n\n      So:\n\n        At turn 9: we are at y=7 -> we must check freeway 7 at turn 9: is 0 in the car span at turn 9?\n\n        The car at freeway 7 at turn 9: \n            T=9 -> t=0: span = [-24 - 24*0, -1 - 24*0] = [-24, -1] -> 0 is not in [-24,-1] -> safe.\n\n        Then we take an action a9 (which is the action at turn 9). Let me denote the sequence:\n\n          Turn 9: a9 -> then at turn 10, the player will be at y7 + a9 (where a9: U->+1, D->-1, S->0)\n\n        Then at turn 10: if the player is at freeway k, we check freeway k at turn 10.\n\n        Similarly, at turn 10 we take action a10, and so on.\n\nSo we must check:\n\n  - At the starting turn (turn 9): we are at y=7 -> check freeway 7 at turn 9: safe (as above).\n\nNow, we want to see if we can do:\n\n  Option 1: Go up twice: \n      Turn9: U -> then at turn10: y=8\n      Turn10: U -> then at turn11: y=9 -> done in H=2 turns (so the last action is at turn10, and we are at y9 at turn11? But note the problem says: we want the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n      Let me clarify: \n          We have actions from t = t1 to t1+H-1 (so H actions). Then the position at the end of the last action (turn t1+H-1) is the position we care about.\n\n      Our actions: \n          Turn t1 (9): a9\n          Turn t1+1 (10): a10\n          ... \n          Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n      Then the position after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n      How many actions? We start at turn9 (t1=9) and we do H actions: from turn9 to turn9+H-1.\n\n      Then the time at the end is turn9+H-1.\n\n      We want to be at y=9 at that time.\n\n      For H=2:\n          Action at turn9: a9 -> leads to y10 = y9 + a9\n          Action at turn10: a10 -> leads to y11 = y10 + a10\n\n          We want y11 = 9.\n\n      Since we start at y9=7, then we require:\n          y10 = 7 + a9 (must be 8) -> a9=U\n          y11 = 8 + a10 = 9 -> a10=U.\n\n      So sequence: \n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n\n      Now, we must check for collisions:\n\n          At turn9 (when we are at y=7): check freeway7 at turn9: we already did -> safe.\n\n          At turn10: we are at y=8. Then we must check freeway8 at turn10.\n\n          Freeway8: car (-24, -1, left, 24) -> same as freeway7? Actually, no:\n\n          Freeway8: (-24, -1, left, 24) -> same car? Actually, the table:\n\n          Freeway7: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n          Freeway8: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\n          So both freeways have the same car? \n\n          But let me compute for freeway8 at turn10 (absolute turn10, relative t=1):\n\n          For freeway8: left-moving car: \n            T=10 -> t=1: \n                span = [-24 - 24*(10-9), -1 - 24*(10-9)] = [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48, -25] -> 0 not in this -> safe.\n\n          So both moves are safe? Then we can do H=2.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway7 at turn10? We are not on freeway7 at turn10 because we moved to 8 at turn10? \n\n  How the move works:\n\n      At turn9: we are at (0,7). We choose a9=U. \n          Then at turn9: we are still on freeway7? Yes, because the move happens at the end of the turn? \n\n          The problem states: \n            \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\n          So at turn9: we are on freeway7 -> we check freeway7 at turn9: safe.\n\n          Then at turn10: we are at y8. At turn10: we are on freeway8 -> we check freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\n          Then we take action a10=U at turn10: at the end of turn10 we are still at freeway8? Then we check freeway8 at turn10 for the move? Actually, the move at turn10 will update the position to y9 at turn11. But at turn10 we are at y8, so we check freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\n          Then at turn11: we are at y9 -> no freeway to check.\n\n          So the entire sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway7 and freeway8. However, what if we had to go through other freeways? In this case, we are going directly from 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nBut let me check if there are any cars on freeway7 and freeway8 at the required times.\n\nWe did:\n\n  Freeway7 at turn9: safe.\n  Freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nBut note: freeway7 at turn10? We don't care because we are not on freeway7 at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn9? We are not on freeway8 at turn9.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait, the car state for freeway5 and freeway6? They are present, but we are not on those freeways. So we ignore.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n\nBut let me double-check the car at freeway8 at turn10.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? The car is (-24,-1,left,24) at turn9.\n\nAt turn10 (T=10, so T-9=1):\n  For left-moving: [h - s*1, tau - s*1] = [-24 - 24, -1 -24] = [-48, -25] -> 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nWhat about other freeways? The problem says: avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. Since we are only on freeway7 and freeway8 during the journey, and we checked those, we are safe.\n\nBut wait, at turn9: we are at freeway7 -> we must check all cars on freeway7? The table says freeway7 has one car: (-24,-1,left,24) -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway8 at turn10: one car: same car? Actually, the table:\n\n  Freeway7: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n  Freeway8: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nSo both have the same car? That might be a mistake? Or maybe they are different cars? But the problem says: \"Car State\" per freeway. So freeway7 has one car and freeway8 has one car. They are independent.\n\nSo freeway7: \n  at turn9: [-24, -1] -> safe.\n\nfreeway8:\n  at turn10: we computed [-48,-25] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway8 at turn9? We don't check because we are not on freeway8 at turn9.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5 and freeway6? They have multiple cars. But we are not on those freeways.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if we can do H=1? \n  Then we would have to go from y7 to y9 in one action? But the actions only change by at most 1. So impossible. So H=2 is minimal.\n\nHence the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t=0 to H-1. For H=2, t=0 and t=1.\n\n  t=0: turn t1+0 = turn9: U\n  t=1: turn t1+1 = turn10: U\n\nSo the format is:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut note: the player reaches y=9 at the end of the last action? After the second action (at turn10) we have y11 = 8 + 1 = 9? But the turn we are at after the last action is turn10? \n\nWait, the position after the action at turn10 is the state at turn11? \n\nThe update: \n  At turn9: we do action a9 -> then we get y10 = y9 + a9.\n  At turn10: we do action a10 -> then we get y11 = y10 + a10.\n\nWe are at turn10 when we do the last action? But the problem says: we are to have the position at turn t1+H-1 = 9+2-1 = 10? \n\nBut at turn10, we have just taken the action? Then the position at turn10 is y10? \n\nBut note: the player update is defined as: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn9: we are at y9=7.\nThen we choose a9: then at the beginning of turn10, we are at y10 = 7 + Δy9.\n\nThen at turn10, we choose a10: then at the beginning of turn11, we are at y11 = y10 + Δy10.\n\nWe want the position at the end of the sequence of actions. The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nt1+H-1 = 9+2-1 = 10. So we want at the beginning of turn10 we are at y10=9? But that is not possible because we start at y9=7 and we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean the state after the last action? That is, after H actions, we are at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we do H actions starting at t1 (for t=0) and ending at t1+H-1. Then the position after the last action would be at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the example: \n  We are at turn t1, and we do H actions, so we do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position at turn t1+H (which is the next state after the last action) would be the result of the last action? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nBut note the indexing: \n  At turn t1 (current) we are at y_{t1}. Then we take action a_{t1} -> then we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\n  Then at turn t1+1 we take action a_{t1+1} -> then we get y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}.\n\n  ...\n\n  After H actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), the next state is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem requires: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or after the action of turn t1+H-2?\n\nLet me clarify with H=2:\n\n  We take two actions: at turn t1 (9) and turn t1+1 (10).\n\n  Then we require y_{t1+2-1} = y_{t1+1} = 9.\n\n  How do we get y_{t1+1}=9?\n\n      We start at y_{t1} (y9)=7.\n      Then we take action a9 at turn9: then y10 = y9 + a9.\n\n      We require y10 = 9.\n\n      But the actions: \n          a9 = U: then y10 = 7+1 = 8 -> not 9.\n          a9 = D: 7-1=6\n          a9 = S: 7\n\n      None gives 9.\n\n  So we cannot get y10=9 in one action.\n\n  Therefore, we must have H such that we get y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n  For H=3:\n      Actions at turn9, turn10, turn11.\n      We require y_{9+3-1}=y11=9.\n\n      Then: \n          y10 = y9 + a9\n          y11 = y10 + a10\n          y12 = y11 + a11   [but we don't care because we only require y11=9]\n\n      We can set:\n          a9: U -> y10=8\n          a10: U -> y11=9\n\n      Then we don't need a11? But we must do three actions? \n\n      Actually, we do three actions: \n          turn9: a9 = U -> then at turn10 we are at y10=8.\n          turn10: a10 = U -> then at turn11 we are at y11=9.\n          turn11: a11 = ? -> but we already reached y11=9. We can set a11 to S? Then y12=9.\n\n      But the requirement is that at the end of the sequence (after the last action) we are at y_{t1+H-1} = y_{9+3-1}=y11=9. \n\n      So we need to have y11=9.\n\n      And we do: \n          a9: U -> y10=8\n          a10: U -> y11=9\n\n      Then the third action at turn11: we don't need to do anything? But we must do three actions? \n\n      Actually, the sequence has three actions: \n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n          turn11: S   (or U or D? but we are at 9, so if we do U we go to 10 -> invalid, D to 8 -> then we leave 9. So we must do S at turn11 to stay at 9.)\n\n      But wait, we require y11=9 at the beginning of turn11? Or after the action at turn11?\n\n      The state y_{t} is the state at the beginning of turn t? \n\n      The update: \n          y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t   [Δy_t is the action taken at turn t]\n\n      So at the beginning of turn9: y9=7.\n      Then we take a9: then at the beginning of turn10: y10 = y9 + a9.\n      Then we take a10: then at the beginning of turn11: y11 = y10 + a10.\n      Then we take a11: then at the beginning of turn12: y12 = y11 + a11.\n\n      We require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{11} = 9.\n\n      So we require that at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. \n\n      How do we get to 9 at the beginning of turn11?\n\n          We need: \n             y10 = y9 + a9 -> must be 8 (if we do U at turn9) \n             y11 = y10 + a10 = 8 + a10 -> if a10=U then y11=9.\n\n          So we don't need a third action? But the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H=2: actions at turn9 and turn10.\n\n      Then we would have y11=9 at the beginning of turn11, which is after the second action (taken at turn10). \n\n      And we do not take an action at turn11? \n\n      So the sequence should be for H=2: \n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n\n      Then the position at the beginning of turn11 is 9. \n\n      And we require the position at turn t1+H-1 = 9+2-1 = 10? But we are at the beginning of turn10: y10=8, and at the beginning of turn11: y11=9.\n\n      But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning turn10? But at turn10 we are at (0,8).\n\n      This is a critical point.\n\n      The problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n      So we require the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\n      For H=2: turn index = t1+H-1 = 9+2-1 = 10 -> we require y10=9.\n\n      But with two actions: \n          After a9 at turn9: we get y10 = 7 + a9. \n          To get y10=9, we would need a9 to be +2, which is not allowed.\n\n      Therefore, H=2 is not sufficient.\n\n      We need H=3: then we require y_{9+3-1}=y11=9.\n\n      How to get y11=9:\n          y10 = y9 + a9 = 7 + a9\n          y11 = y10 + a10 = 7 + a9 + a10 = 9\n\n      So a9 + a10 = 2 -> only possibility: U and U.\n\n      Then we do:\n          turn9: U -> y10=8\n          turn10: U -> y11=9\n          Then we require an action at turn11? Because the sequence must be of length H=3: from t=0 to 2 (so turns 9,10,11). \n\n      But at turn11, we are at y11=9 (at the beginning of turn11). Then we take an action a11. But we don't care what happens after as long as we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11. However, we must avoid collisions at turn11? \n\n      At turn11: we are at y11=9 -> no freeway (since freeways are only 1-8) -> safe. Then we can choose a11 arbitrarily? But we only require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11, and we are. Then we can choose a11=S to stay.\n\n      But note: we must avoid collisions at the turn when we are on a freeway. At turn11 we are at y=9 -> not on a freeway -> safe.\n\n      Now, we must check the entire path:\n\n        Turn9: \n            We are at y9=7 at the beginning of turn9 -> then we take action a9=U.\n            During turn9, we are on freeway7? Yes -> check freeway7 at turn9: safe (as before).\n\n        Turn10:\n            At the beginning of turn10: y10=8.\n            Then we take action a10=U.\n            During turn10, we are on freeway8? Yes -> check freeway8 at turn10: \n                T=10: freeway8 car: left-moving, span = [-24 -24*(10-9), -1-24*(10-9)] = [-48,-25] -> safe.\n\n        Turn11:\n            At the beginning of turn11: y11=9.\n            Then we take action a11=S (or U/D? but we cannot go above 9, so U is invalid? Actually, the update says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. If we do U at y=9, then y12=10 -> invalid. So we must not do U. Similarly, if we do D, we go to 8. But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn11? The requirement is only to be at 9 at turn11 (the beginning) but the action at turn11 doesn't affect that. However, we must avoid going out of bounds.\n\n            Since we are at 9, we must do either S or D? But if we do D, we go to 8 at turn12 -> but we are not required to stay at 9? The problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn11. So we can do any action? But we must avoid collisions. However, at turn11 we are at y11=9 -> no car. Then at turn11, after taking action, we will be at y12 = 9 + a11.\n\n            But the problem doesn't require anything about after turn11. So we can do S to stay at 9? Or D to go to 8? But we are only concerned with the journey until we reach the goal at turn11.\n\n            However, note that during turn11 we are at y11=9 -> no car, so safe. Then we can do any action? But the action at turn11 doesn't cause a collision on turn11? Because the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is 9 -> not a freeway) so no car to collide. Then we can do any action? But we must ensure we don't go out of bounds.\n\n            The update: y12 = y11 + a11 must be in [0,9]. So if we do U: 9+1=10 -> invalid. So we cannot do U.\n\n            We can do D: then we leave 9 -> but that's acceptable? The problem doesn't say we have to stay. But we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn11. So we can do S or D? \n\n            However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We are doing H=3. But note: we could do H=3 and then the last action is not necessary? But the sequence must be of length H=3.\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We are using 3 turns. However, we already reached the goal at the beginning of turn11, so we don't need to do the third action? But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we must have H actions. So we must do three actions.\n\n      So we set the third action to S (stay) at turn11.\n\n      Then the sequence:\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: S\n\n      Now, we must check collisions at turn11: safe (as above).\n\n      But is there a way with H=2? We see that we cannot get y10=9 in one move. So H=3 is the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what about the goal: we are required to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 9+3-1 = 11? But at turn11 (beginning) we are at (0,9). Then we take an action? But that action might move us away? But the problem doesn't say we have to stay. It only says \"reach\" at that turn.\n\nSo H=3.\n\nBut let me see if we can avoid the third action? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must do exactly H actions. And we require the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9. For H=2, that state is at the beginning of turn10, which we cannot make 9. For H=3, it's turn11 -> which we can.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3.\n\nBut wait, what about the car at freeway8 at turn10? We already computed it's safe. And freeway7 at turn9 is safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway7 at turn9 and freeway8 at turn10. We are never on freeway1-6 or freeway8 at turn9, etc.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut note: we could do D at turn11? But that would make y12=8, which is safe? But then we are leaving the goal. The problem doesn't require to stay, so it's acceptable. But we choose S to be safe and stay at 9.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay, so we could do D? However, we must avoid collisions. At turn11, we are at y=9 -> no collision. Then if we do D, at turn12 we would be at y=8 -> but we are not required to avoid collisions after turn11? The problem only requires to avoid collisions during the journey until we reach the goal? Actually, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways ...\" during the entire sequence of actions. \n\nWe are required to avoid collisions at every turn T when we are taking an action? Specifically, at turn T (which is in the range [t1, t1+H-1]), we are at freeway y_T? And we must avoid collision at that turn.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\n  Turn9: at freeway7 -> safe.\n  Turn10: at freeway8 -> safe.\n  Turn11: at freeway9 -> no freeway, so safe.\n\nThen if we do D at turn11, then at turn11 we are safe. Then the next state is at turn12: y12=8 -> but we are not taking an action at turn12? And we are not required to be safe at turn12? The problem only requires avoiding collisions during the turns when we are taking actions? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways ...\". It doesn't specify only during the actions, but the collision condition is defined per turn: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". And we are present on the grid at every turn? \n\nBut note: the player is always at (0,y_t) at every turn t. And the collision condition is checked at every turn T: if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T in [1,8]) and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn our journey, we are at:\n\n  Turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7 -> check -> safe.\n  Turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 -> check -> safe.\n  Turn11: y11=9 -> not a freeway -> no check (safe by default).\n\n  Then we take the action at turn11: which will update the state to turn12: y12 = 9 + a11.\n\n  But at turn11, the action doesn't change our position during turn11? Our position during turn11 is fixed at the beginning: y11=9. \n\n  So we only care about the turns we are passing through: 9,10,11.\n\n  And at turn11, we are at 9 -> safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can do any action at turn11 as long as it doesn't cause an out-of-bound at the next state? But the problem doesn't care about after the goal? It only says \"to reach (0,9)\". \n\n  However, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We are using 3 turns. But note: the goal is reached at turn11 (the beginning) and then we are doing an extra action? \n\n  But the problem requires a sequence of H actions. And we must have the goal at turn t1+H-1 = 11. So we are forced to do an action at turn11? \n\n  And we are not allowed to do nothing? \n\n  So we must do an action. \n\n  Since we are at 9, we can do S or D? But if we do D, then at the next state we leave 9. But the problem doesn't require to stay. \n\n  However, to be safe and not go out of bounds, we do S.\n\n  But if we do D, we go to 8 at turn12 -> and we don't check turn12 because it's beyond the last action? But the player might be in danger at turn12? The problem doesn't require to avoid collisions after the goal turn? \n\n  The problem says: \"avoid collisions\" during the game until we reach the goal? Or during the entire sequence of actions? \n\n  Since we are required to avoid collisions at every turn we are in (from turn9 to turn11), and turn12 is beyond the last action (which is at turn11), then we don't care about turn12. \n\n  But note: the collision condition is defined per turn, and we are at turn12: if we do D at turn11, then at turn12 we are at y12=8 -> which is a freeway -> we must avoid collision? \n\n  However, the problem says: we are to avoid collisions with cars ... and we are playing a multi-turn game. It doesn't specify only until the goal. \n\n  But the goal is to reach (0,9) at turn11. After that, we are free? \n\n  The problem says: \"to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions ...\". It doesn't say \"and then avoid collisions after\". \n\n  So we only care about collisions from turn9 to turn11. \n\n  At turn12, even if we collide, it doesn't matter? \n\n  But that seems odd. \n\n  Alternatively, we must avoid collisions for the entire sequence of actions? Meaning for every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\n  The collision condition is checked at every turn T. We are present at every turn T. \n\n  Our actions are taken at turns: 9,10,11. So we are present at turns: 9,10,11,12? \n\n  But the goal is at turn11. \n\n  However, after the last action (at turn11), the next state is turn12. We are at turn12? \n\n  The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we do actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1. \n\n  Then the player is present at the beginning of turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H. \n\n  And we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H? \n\n  Because at turn t1+H we are present? \n\n  But the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars\" and the collision condition is defined per turn. \n\n  So we must avoid collisions at turns: 9,10,11, and also 12? \n\n  If we do D at turn11, then at turn12 we are at y12=8 -> freeway8 -> we must check freeway8 at turn12. \n\n  Freeway8 at turn12 (T=12): \n      car: (-24,-1,left,24) -> span = [-24 -24*(12-9), -1-24*(12-9)] = [-24-72, -1-72] = [-96,-73] -> safe.\n\n  So it's safe. \n\n  But then why not do D? \n\n  However, we don't care about the state after the goal? The goal is only to be at 9 at turn11. \n\n  But the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and that applies to every turn we are in. Since we are in turn12, we must avoid collision at turn12. \n\n  But note: the problem does not specify a time limit. So we must avoid collisions at every turn we exist. \n\n  Therefore, if we do an action that causes a collision at turn12, that is not allowed. \n\n  But as above, freeway8 at turn12 is safe. \n\n  So we could do D at turn11? \n\n  However, why risk? We can do S and stay at 9. \n\n  And at turn12: \n      y12=9 -> not a freeway -> safe.\n\n  So S is safe and simpler.\n\n  Therefore, we choose S.\n\nBut let me check if we can do H=3 and avoid the third action? We cannot because the sequence must have H=3 actions.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to reach the goal at turn10? We saw that we cannot.\n\nBut wait, what if we do a different sequence? For example, go down? That would take more turns. So H=3 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut let me verify the car movements again, especially for freeway8 at turn10.\n\nWe did: freeway8 at turn10: T=10 -> car: [-24-24*(10-9), -1-24*(10-9)] = [-48,-25] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at turn10? We are not on freeway7 at turn10, so we don't care.\n\nWhat about freeway8 at turn9? We are not on freeway8 at turn9.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway8 at turn9: T=9 -> [-24, -1] -> safe even if we were on it, but we are not.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? We are only on freeway7 and freeway8 during the journey.\n\nBut wait, what if there is a car on freeway8 that appears at turn10? We have computed the given car.\n\nBut freeway8 has two cars? Let me check the table:\n\n  Freeway8: (-24, -1, left, 24)   -> only one car? The table says: \n      | 8 | (-24, -1, left, 24) |\n\n  But freeway5 and 6 have multiple cars. Freeway5: three cars? \n      (6, -5, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\n  Freeway6: two cars.\n\nBut we are not on those freeways.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3, and the actions are:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut wait, what if we do U at turn11? That would be 9+1=10 -> out of bounds. So we cannot do U.\n\nWe can do D or S. Both are safe for the next state? But D leads to 8 at turn12, which is freeway8 -> we must check freeway8 at turn12.\n\nWe did: freeway8 at turn12: T=12 -> span = [-24-24*3, -1-24*3] = [-24-72, -1-72] = [-96,-73] -> safe.\n\nBut if we do D, then at turn12 we are at 8 -> freeway8, and we check freeway8 at turn12: safe.\n\nSo we could do D? But that would be unnecessary. We choose S.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check freeway7 and freeway8 for the entire period of turns 9,10,11,12? \n\nFreeway7:\n  T=9: [-24, -1] -> safe.\n  T=10: [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48,-25] -> safe.\n  T=11: [-24-48, -1-48] = [-72,-49] -> safe.\n  T=12: [-96,-73] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8:\n  Same as freeway7? No, the car is the same? \n  T=9: [-24,-1] -> safe.\n  T=10: [-48,-25] -> safe.\n  T=11: [-72,-49] -> safe.\n  T=12: [-96,-73] -> safe.\n\nSo even if we were on these freeways at these times, it would be safe.\n\nBut we are only on freeway7 at turn9 and freeway8 at turn10.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is safe.\n\nBut note: there might be other cars on freeway7 and freeway8? The table only lists one car per freeway for 7 and 8.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 7) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. The initial turn is \\(t_1 = 9\\), and the player starts at y = 7.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Movement Constraints**: The player can move up (U: +1 in y), down (D: -1 in y), or stay (S: 0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway \\(k\\) (where \\(k = y_T\\)) and the x=0 position is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- **Car Dynamics** (for freeways 7 and 8, as the player moves through these):\n  - **Freeway 7**: Car at turn 9: head = -24, tail = -1, direction = left, speed = 24.  \n    Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([-24 - 24(T-9), -1 - 24(T-9)]\\).\n  - **Freeway 8**: Car at turn 9: head = -24, tail = -1, direction = left, speed = 24.  \n    Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([-24 - 24(T-9), -1 - 24(T-9)]\\).\n\n### Path to Goal:\n- Start at turn 9: y = 7 (freeway 7).\n- Target: Reach y = 9 at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + H - 1\\).\n- Minimal \\(H\\):  \n  - \\(H = 2\\): Requires \\(y_{10} = 9\\). But from y = 7, one action (U) only reaches y = 8 at turn 10. Impossible.  \n  - \\(H = 3\\): Requires \\(y_{11} = 9\\). Achievable with two U moves:  \n    - Turn 9: U → y_{10} = 8.  \n    - Turn 10: U → y_{11} = 9.  \n    - A third action (at turn 11) is needed (sequence length \\(H = 3\\)). Since y = 9 is the goal and bounds must be respected, S (stay) is chosen.\n\n### Collision Checks:\n- **Turn 9 (y = 7, freeway 7)**:  \n  Span = \\([-24 - 24(0), -1 - 24(0)] = [-24, -1]\\).  \n  0 ∉ [-24, -1] → safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y = 8, freeway 8)**:  \n  Span = \\([-24 - 24(1), -1 - 24(1)] = [-48, -25]\\).  \n  0 ∉ [-48, -25] → safe.\n- **Turn 11 (y = 9)**: Not a freeway (y = 9 has no cars) → safe.\n\n### Sequence:\n- Turn 9: U → moves to y = 8 at turn 10 (safe).\n- Turn 10: U → moves to y = 9 at turn 11 (safe).\n- Turn 11: S → stays at y = 9 (safe and within bounds).\n\nThis sequence achieves y = 9 at turn 11 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + 3 - 1 = 11\\)) in minimal \\(H = 3\\) turns, avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player moves vertically, and the cars are on horizontal freeways, a collision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U (up, +1), D (down, -1), S (stay, 0). y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=10, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at t_1=10:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. At t_1=10, head=48, tail=1, so for T>10, span = [1 + 48(T-10), 48 + 48(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Head=48, tail=1, right, speed=48. So same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: head=-8, tail=-19, right, speed=4. So for T>10, span = [-19 + 4(T-10), -8 + 4(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? Head=-8, tail=-19, right, speed=4. Yes.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, right, speed=6. So span at T: [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=6. Tail=37? Head=48, tail=37, so since it's right-moving, at t_1, span is [37,48], I think. The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1, then at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 5, cars are (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nSo first car: head=12, tail=1, right, so span at t_1: [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 6(T-10), 12 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, right, so span at t_1: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 6(T-10), 48 + 6(T-10)]\n\nThird car: head=-30, tail=-41, right, so span at t_1: [-41,-30]\n\nAt T: [-41 + 6(T-10), -30 + 6(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst: head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=4. So span at t_1: [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 4(T-10), -24 + 4(T-10)]\n\nSecond: head=40, tail=29, right, speed=4? Tail=29, head=40, so span at t_1: [29,40]\n\nAt T: [29 + 4(T-10), 40 + 4(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 7: head=-48, tail=-25, left, speed=24.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-48, -25]\n\nAt T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-48 -24(T-10), -25 -24(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Head=-48, tail=-25, left, speed=24. Yes.\n\nNow, the player is at y=8 at turn t_1=10. I need to get to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and above y=9 is not allowed, so to reach (0,9), I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player, I think. The player is at x=0, moving vertically. The cars are on horizontal freeways, so when the player is at y=k, they are on freeway k if k between 1 and 8.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, player is at y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn.\n\nAlso, note: when you move, at turn T, if you go to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only check collision for the freeway you are on at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at y=8, turn 10.\n\nI need to reach y=9. y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So when player is at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. But the goal is to be at (0,9), so once there, it's safe.\n\nSince player is at y=8 now, to go to y=9, I can just go up once, but I need to make sure that when I'm on y=8, I don't collide with cars on freeway 8 at that turn.\n\nAt turn 10, player is on freeway 8. So I need to check if at turn 10, for freeway 8, is 0 in the span?\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 10: car with span [h, τ] for left-moving, which is [-48, -25], so span is from -48 to -25, which is all negative, so 0 is not in [-48,-25], so no collision at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but since player is only on y=8 at turn 10, only freeway 8 matters for now.\n\nSo at turn 10, it's safe.\n\nNow, if I do action U at turn 10, then y_{11} = y_{10} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8, and I move to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, I am on freeway 8, which we said is safe.\n\nAt turn 11, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo in one turn, I can reach y=9.\n\nBut is that minimal? H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=10, so actions from a_{10} to a_{10+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be y=9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 10, y=8.\n\nAfter one action, at turn 11, y=9 if action U.\n\nSo H=1, sequence: at turn 10, action U.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut I need to confirm if at turn 10, when I am on freeway 8, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 10: car span [ -48, -25 ] for left-moving? Earlier I said for left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt T=10, t_1=10, so T-t_1=0, so span is [h, τ] = [-48, -25], since it's left-moving, and [h, τ] with h=-48, τ=-25, so min is -48, max is -25, so from -48 to -25, 0 not in, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I do U at turn 10, I go to y=9 at turn 11, no issue.\n\nBut is there any car on freeway 8 that could cause issue? Only one car, and it's far left.\n\nBut let me check if for future turns, but since I'm leaving immediately, no need.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but in this case, I can go directly.\n\nThe player is at y=8, which is a freeway, but I can move up to y=9 in one step.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, and it's safe.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 10, span [-48,-25], not at 0.\n\nIf I stay, at turn 11, what happens?\n\nBut I don't need to stay.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but since I'm only on y=8 at turn 10, and I move to y=9 at turn 11, I never interact with other freeways.\n\nSo minimal H should be 1, with action U at turn 10.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states.\n\nFreeway 8: left-moving, speed 24.\n\nAt turn T, span: [h - s(T-10), τ - s(T-10)] = [-48 -24(T-10), -25 -24(T-10)]\n\nSet T=10: [-48, -25], as above.\n\nFor T>10, it becomes more negative, so never reaches 0. For example, at T=11: [-48-24(1), -25-24(1)] = [-72, -49], still negative.\n\nSimilarly, always negative, so freeway 8 is always safe for x=0? But collision only if 0 in span, which it never is since min is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 is the same: head=-48, tail=-25, left, speed=24, so span at T: [-48-24(T-10), -25-24(T-10)], always negative.\n\nBut for other freeways, like freeway 5, there are cars, but I'm not on those freeways.\n\nSo for the player at y=8, moving up immediately should be fine.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,8), and I need to reach (0,9), so from y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway, y=9 is not.\n\nIn the action, if I do U, I go to y=9.\n\nBut let me see the collision definition.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, then for that freeway, if 0 is in some car's span, collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn 10, y_10=8, freeway 8, span at T=10 is [-48,-25], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nThen action U, so at turn 11, y_11=9, not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nSo I reach (0,9) at turn 11.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H=1, since one action.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so for H=1, only one action at t=0, which is turn t_1 + 0 = turn 10.\n\nAction a_{10} = U.\n\nThen after that, at turn 11, position is (0,9).\n\nBut the turn when position is (0,9) is turn 11, but the last action is at turn 10.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAt turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 8.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t_1 + 1, y_{t_1 +1} = 9.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nSet k = t_1 + H - 1, so y_k =9.\n\nAt turn k, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H - 1? No.\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after these actions, the position is at turn (t_1 + H).\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t_1, before any action, position is given.\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, which affects position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, action at turn t affects position at turn t+1.\n\nSo after action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1+1}, position at turn t_1 +2, and so on.\n\nAfter applying actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have H actions, resulting in positions from turn t_1 +1 to turn t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe last action is at turn t_1 + H -1, which determines the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, before the action, the position might be something, but the action at that turn changes it to the next turn.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nLet me denote the turn index.\n\nAt turn T, the player has position y_T.\n\nThen, based on action a_T, the position updates to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo the action at turn T affects the next position.\n\nAt the start, at turn t_1, position is given as (0, y_{t_1}).\n\nThen, we choose actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1+1 is y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1+1}, y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Δy_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at some point, y_K =9 for K >= t_1.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the turn where position is 9.\n\nThe actions up to that point: the sequence of actions is from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}? But the actions affect future positions.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it means that after all actions up to turn t_1 + H -2, the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nLet's think of the number of actions.\n\nSuppose we take no actions, at turn t_1, position is y_{t_1}, not 9.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t_1+1, position could be 9 if we move up.\n\nIn this case, y_{t_1} =8, so if we take action U at turn t_1, then at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nSo we have y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nNow, t_1 +1 = (t_1 + H -1) only if H-1 =1, so H=2.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =8, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, then y_{t_1 +2 -1} = y_{t_1 +1} =9, which is what we want.\n\nAnd the sequence of actions: for t from 0 to H-1=1, so a_{t_1 +0} and a_{t_1 +1}, but we only need one action to reach at turn t_1+1.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=2, t from 0 to 1, so actions at turn t_1 and t_1+1.\n\nBut to have y_{t_1+1} =9, we need action at turn t_1 to be U, and at turn t_1+1, we don't need to do anything, but we might need to specify an action, or not?\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from turn t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at turn t_1 and turn t_1+1.\n\nAt turn t_1, action a_{t_1} should be U, so that y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} +1 =9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1, position is already (0,9), so we can do action S (stay), or whatever, but since we are at (0,9), and no further action needed, but the sequence requires H actions, so we must specify a_{t_1+1}.\n\nSimilarly, for any H, we might have extra actions after reaching, but since we want minimal H, we should reach as soon as possible.\n\nIn this case, with H=1, y_{t_1} =8, not 9.\n\nWith H=2, we can have y_{t_1+1} =9, and we have two actions: a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}.\n\na_{t_1} = U to go up, and a_{t_1+1} can be S, since we are at y=9, and S keeps it at 9.\n\ny_{t_1+2} would be 9 if a_{t_1+1}=S.\n\nBut we only care about y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which for H=2, is y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nSo it works.\n\nCould we reach at turn t_1 with H=0? But H is number of turns, probably H>=1, and at turn t_1, y=8 not 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 2, with actions: a_{t_1} = U, and a_{t_1+1} = S, but a_{t_1+1} is at turn t_1+1, which affects y_{t_1+2}, but y_{t_1+1} is already 9, so for the position at turn t_1+1, it is set by previous action.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=2, we have two actions, but the position at turn t_1+1 is after first action, and we need y_{t_1+1} =9, which is achieved by a_{t_1} = U.\n\nThen a_{t_1+1} can be anything, but since we are at (0,9), we can stay or whatever, but to be safe, probably S.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), and once there, it's fine.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t_1+1, y=9, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nAction at turn t_1+1 doesn't affect position until turn t_1+2, which is beyond.\n\nSo for minimal H, H=2 should work.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car.\n\nAt turn t_1=10, player at y=8.\n\nAction U at turn 10: so at turn 10, we are on freeway 8, which is safe, as established.\n\nThen y_{11} =9.\n\nThen at turn 11, we are at y=9, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen for the second action, at turn 11, we can do S, for example.\n\nBut since the position at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 =11 is 9, which is good.\n\nt_1 + H -1 for H=2 is 10 +2-1=11, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I do only one action, H=1, then y_{t_1 +1-1} = y_{10} =8, not 9.\n\nSo H must be at least 2.\n\nSimilarly, in general, to move from one row to another, it takes at least one action, so H at least 2 if starting from y=8 to y=9.\n\nUnless starting at y=9, but here not.\n\nSo in this case, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot go up immediately?\n\nLet me check if freeway 8 is safe at turn 10.\n\nAs above, yes.\n\nPerhaps for other turns, but I don't stay.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nWhich is consistent with what I have.\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, and only check that freeway.\n\nSo here at turn 10, y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nThen move to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut let me look at the car on freeway 8: left-moving, speed 24.\n\nAt turn T, span [ -48 -24(T-10), -25 -24(T-10) ]\n\nFor T=10, [-48,-25]\n\nT=11, [-72,-49]\n\nT=12, [-96,-73], etc., all negative, so 0 never in span, so freeway 8 is always safe for x=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7.\n\nBut other freeways have cars that might pass x=0.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 has cars: first car at t_1, span [1,12] for the one with head=12,tail=1, right-moving, speed 6.\n\nAt T, [1 +6(T-10), 12 +6(T-10)]\n\nSet equal to 0: 1 +6(T-10) =0 => 6(T-10)= -1, not integer, similarly 12 +6(T-10)=0 => T-10 = -2, not possible.\n\nThe span contains 0 when min <=0<=max.\n\nMin =1 +6(T-10), max=12 +6(T-10)\n\nSet min <=0 and max >=0.\n\n1 +6(T-10) <=0 => 6(T-10) <= -1 => T-10 <= -1/6, so T<=9, but T>=10, so min >=1+0=1>0 for T>=10, so min>0, so 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 5: [37,48] at T=10, min=37>0, increasing, so never <=0.\n\nThird car: [-41,-30] at T=10, min=-41<0, max=-30<0, so negative, and at T, min=-41+6(T-10), max=-30+6(T-10)\n\nSet max>=0: -30+6(T-10) >=0 => 6(T-10) >=30 => T-10 >=5, T>=15\n\nMin<=0: -41+6(T-10) <=0 => 6(T-10) <=41 => T-10 <=41/6≈6.833, so T<=16\n\nSo for T from 15 to 16, max>=0 and min<=0? Let's see.\n\nAt T=15, min=-41+6(5)= -41+30= -11, max=-30+30=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so 0 is included? Max=0, and since it's a closed span, I assume, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, min=-41+6(6)= -41+36= -5, max=-30+36=6, so [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt T=17, min=-41+42=1, max=-30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, the third car has 0 in span at T=15 and T=16.\n\nBut since I'm not going to be on freeway 5, it doesn't matter.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways may have times when cars are at x=0.\n\nBut for this plan, I'm only concerned with freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nSo back to the point, I think I can go directly.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, which is freeway 8, and I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at turn 10, it is safe to be on y=8.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe the problem is that from y=8, I need to go to y=9, but perhaps there is a car on y=8 that I need to avoid, but in this case, no.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,8), and at turn 10, but the cars are given at turn 10, so I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: head=-48, tail=-25, left, speed=24.\n\nSince left-moving, at T, span [h - s(T-10), τ - s(T-10)] = [-48 -24(T-10), -25 -24(T-10)]\n\nAs above.\n\nAll negative, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 same.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if at any turn, freeway 8 has a car at x=0.\n\nSet -25 -24(T-10) >=0 and -48 -24(T-10) <=0, but -25 -24(T-10) <= -25 <0 for all T, so max is negative, so never 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly min more negative.\n\nSo freeway 8 always safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions: at turn 10, U; at turn 11, S.\n\nBut since at turn 11, we are at y=9, and we can do S to stay, or even U or D, but y=9, if U, y=10 not allowed, since y in [0,9], so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so at y=9, cannot go up, must go down or stay.\n\nSimilarly at y=0, cannot go down.\n\nSo at turn 11, if we are at y=9, action must be D or S, not U.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for H=2, we need to specify a_{11}.\n\nSince we are at y=9, we can do S.\n\nIn terms of the position, for y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9, which is satisfied.\n\nBut H=2, and we have two actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=2 with only one effective action, but we need to specify both.\n\nBut minimal H means the smallest H such that we can reach in H turns, meaning the sequence has H actions.\n\nSince we reach at turn 11 with one action, but the turn index requires H=2.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo confirm, suppose the player was at y=9 initially, then y_{t_1} =9, so for H=1, y_{t_1 +1-1} = y_{t_1} =9, and sequence with t from 0 to 0, one action a_{t_1}, which could be S, to stay at 9.\n\nBut here, not the case.\n\nSo for this, H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach at turn 10, but no, y=8 not 9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, for this case, minimal H=2, actions: turn 10: U, turn 11: S.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}  (which is S)\n\nBut t_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut is S necessary? Since after a_{10}=U, at turn 11, y=9, which is the goal, and a_{11} is part of the sequence but doesn't affect the reaching, as we are already there at turn 11.\n\nBut we have to provide H actions.\n\nPerhaps for H=2, we can have a_{10}=S and a_{11}=U, but that would reach at turn 12, with y_{11}=8 if S at 10, then y_{12}=9 if U at 11, but y_{t_1 + H -1} for H=2 is y_{11}, which would be 8 if we do nothing, not 9.\n\nIf a_{10}=S, then at turn 11, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen to have y_{11}=9, we need a_{10}=U.\n\nThen a_{11} can be S.\n\nSo it must be a_{10}=U and a_{11}=S or D, but S is fine.\n\nTo minimize H, we don't need more, but H=2 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can do only one action, but then y_{10} not 9.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 again, to be sure.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 8 has car with head=-48, tail=-25, left, speed=24.\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nAt T=10, position head at -48, tail at -25.\n\nAs time increases, since left-moving, head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nx position decreasing.\n\nSo at x=0, never.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at turn 10 and S at turn 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut just to be paranoid, suppose at turn 10, when I am on y=8, but is there any car on other freeways that could affect? No, because collision only for the freeway I am on at that turn.\n\nSo only freeway 8 at turn 10 matters.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11, I am on no freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go through other freeways, but I don't, since I start at y=8, can go directly to y=9.\n\ny=8 to y=9 is adjacent.\n\nSo I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, maybe for completeness.\n\nFor example, freeway 5, as I said, at T=15 and 16, car at x=0, so if I were on y=5 at those turns, collision.\n\nBut here, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: cars, one with span [-35,-24] at T=10, min=-35, max=-24<0, at T, [-35+4(T-10), -24+4(T-10)]\n\nSet max>=0: -24+4(T-10) >=0 => 4(T-10) >=24 => T-10 >=6, T>=16\n\nMin<=0: -35+4(T-10) <=0 => 4(T-10) <=35 => T-10 <=8.75, T<=18\n\nAt T=16: min=-35+4(6)= -35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=17: min=-35+28= -7, max=-24+28=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=18: min=-35+32= -3, max=-24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=19: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 has car at x=0 from T=16 to 18.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut again, not relevant for this path.\n\nSo for the player, starting at y=8, go up immediately, no problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be H=2, with actions: turn 10: U, turn 11: S.\n\nBut in the boxed answer.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nFor H=2, two lines.\n\nWith t_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut to write it properly.\n\nSince t_1 is given, we use t_1.\n\nIn the text, it should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so we can write with numbers or with t_1.\n\nI think with numbers is fine, since t_1 is given.\n\nTo be general, but here t_1=10.\n\nIn the box, we can write:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut let's see the instruction: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so perhaps use t_1.\n\nIn the example, it has the braces, but I think for the answer, we can write:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: S\n}\n\nIn LaTeX.\n\nSince it's text, I can write it as is.\n\nAnother thing: the car state has freeway 5 with three cars, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I misread the direction or something.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are left-moving, but as above.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player can move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) by taking the action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 10. This results in \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n- At turn 10, the player is on freeway 8. The car on freeway 8 at turn 10 has a span of \\([-48, -25]\\) (left-moving, speed 24). Since 0 is not in \\([-48, -25]\\), no collision occurs.\n- After moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, the player is not on any freeway (as freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision check is needed.\n- The position (0, 9) is reached at turn 11, which corresponds to \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{10 + H - 1} = 9\\). Solving for \\(H\\): \\(10 + H - 1 = 11\\) gives \\(H = 2\\).\n- The sequence requires \\(H = 2\\) actions: one to reach \\(y = 9\\) and one for the turn after reaching the goal (as \\(H\\) actions must be specified). At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), so the action \\(S\\) (stay) is used to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- Action at turn 10: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\)).\n- Action at turn 11: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the position is already the goal and \\(y\\) must stay in \\([0, 9]\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: S\n}",
