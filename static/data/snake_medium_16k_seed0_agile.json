Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,5): value +1, life span 5 (expires after Turn 9).\n  - (6,4): value +1, life span 6 (expires after Turn 10).\n  - (6,6): value +1, life span 9 (expires after Turn 13).\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 3) (Direction R):\n1. **Right (R) to (5, 3)**:\n   - (5,3) is free (not a wall or obstacle, not occupied by snake body).\n2. **Up (U) to (4, 4)**:\n   - (4,4) is an internal obstacle (blocked).\n3. **Down (D) to (4, 2)**:\n   - (4,2) is free (not a wall or obstacle, not occupied by snake body).\n4. **Left (L) to (3, 3)**:\n   - Not allowed (instant reverse from current direction R).\n\n### Valid Moves: R or D.\n\n#### Option 1: Move Right (R) to (5, 3)\n- Next turn (Turn 6), head at (5,3), direction R.\n- From (5,3), possible moves:\n  - U to (5,4): Free.\n  - D to (5,2): Free.\n  - R to (6,3): Blocked (internal obstacle at (6,3)).\n  - L to (4,3): Not allowed (instant reverse from R).\n- This path can lead to eating (6,4) by Turn 7 (via (5,4) -> (6,4)), but risks trapping the snake later if (6,6) is eaten.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Down (D) to (4, 2)\n- Next turn (Turn 6), head at (4,2), direction D.\n- From (4,2), possible moves:\n  - L to (3,2): Free.\n  - R to (5,2): Free.\n  - D to (4,1): Free.\n  - U to (4,3): Not allowed (instant reverse from D).\n- This path can lead to eating (3,5) by Turn 9 (via (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5)), which is safer long-term.\n\n### Decision:\nThe previous thinking model suggests prioritizing the safer path to (3,5) to avoid the dead-end risk of (6,6). Thus, the immediate action should be **D (down)** to start this path.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

Eating it on Turn 32 is optimal.\n   - After eating at (2,5), the snake grows, and the tail remains at (4,2). The head is at (2,5), and the next moves could be Up to (2,6) or Left to (1,5).\n   - Potential issue: After eating at (2,5), the snake may get stuck in the top-left corner with limited moves, leading to a dead end (as seen in the previous analysis).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,6):**\n   - Immediate benefit: Moves the snake towards the top, avoiding immediate collision risks.\n   - Next move from (4,6) would be Left (L) to (3,6) (only valid move).\n   - From (3,6), can move Down to (3,5) on Turn 33, then Left to (2,5) to eat the food on Turn 34.\n   - This path also leads to eating the food at (2,5) but delays it by one turn (still within its life span).\n   - After eating at (2,5), the snake is in a similar position as above, with potential to get stuck.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both moves eventually lead to eating the food at (2,5), but moving Left first allows eating it one turn earlier.\n- Moving Up first delays eating the food but may provide slightly more flexibility in subsequent moves (though both paths risk getting stuck).\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Avoid (2,5) and Target Other Food:**\n- The food at (1,3) has a life span of 7 (disappears after Turn 37), and the food at (4,1) has a life span of 10 (disappears after Turn 40).\n- Moving Left to (3,5) then Down to (3,4), etc., can target (1,3) or (4,1), but this misses the immediate opportunity at (2,5).\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the immediate opportunity to eat the positive food at (2,5) and the lack of a clear long-term survival path that avoids getting stuck, the best immediate action is to move Left to (3,5) to eat the food on the next turn. This maximizes the score in the short term, even though it may lead to a dead end later. \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

All other moves lead to collisions or walls, and moving right is invalid due to the reverse rule.\n\n### Future Planning:\nAfter moving left to (4,5), the snake's positions will be:\n- Head: (4,5)\n- Body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] (tail at (3,1))\n\nFrom there, the snake can plan to reach the food at (1,2) by moving left/down in subsequent turns, as outlined in the Thinking Model's guidance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFor Turn 46, the only safe and valid move is **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Valid move.\n2. **Left (L) to (0, 2)**:\n   - (0, 2) is a border wall. Invalid move.\n3. **Right (R) to (2, 2)**:\n   - (2, 2) is not a wall or occupied by the snake. Valid move.\n4. **Up (U)**:\n   - Reverse direction (from Down to Up). Invalid (no instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves:\n#### Option 1: Down to (1, 1)\n- Next turn (Turn 54), the snake must move from (1, 1):\n  - Possible moves: Right to (2, 1) (food at (2, 1)) or Up to (1, 2) (body collision). Only valid move is Right to (2, 1).\n- Eating (2, 1) on Turn 54 is safe (no tail reward danger).\n- After eating, the snake grows, and the next moves can aim for (4, 2).\n\n#### Option 2: Right to (2, 2)\n- Next turn (Turn 54), the snake can move:\n  - Down to (2, 1) (eat food at (2, 1)).\n  - Right to (3, 2) (no food, but can later reach (4, 2)).\n- Choosing Down to (2, 1) is similar to Option 1.\n- Choosing Right to (3, 2) delays eating (2, 1) but allows reaching (4, 2) sooner.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (2, 1) is safe to eat and has a long life span. It is better to eat it now to grow the snake and then plan for (4, 2).\n- Moving Down to (1, 1) forces the snake to eat (2, 1) on the next turn, which is a straightforward and safe path.\n- Moving Right to (2, 2) offers flexibility but risks delaying the safe eat of (2, 1).\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe safest and most straightforward action is to move **Down (D)** to (1, 1), setting up to eat (2, 1) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. This is risky and not immediately feasible.  \n\n**Immediate Action**:  \n- Moving **U** to (4,3) is safe and starts a path toward (4,6).  \n- Moving **L** or **R** doesn't immediately help with food and may lead to dead ends.  \n\n### Action Sequence  \n\\boxed{U}  \n\n### Reasoning  \n- **Short-term**: Move U to (4,3) to avoid collisions and start navigating toward (4,6).  \n- **Long-term**: Plan to reach (4,6) via (4,3) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (4,6), ensuring the snake doesn't trap itself.

Possible moves are U, L, R (D is invalid due to instant reverse rule).\n   - **U (4,4)**: Blocked by internal wall at (4,4).\n   - **L (3,3)**: Occupied by body segment (not tail), leading to collision.\n   - **R (5,3)**: Free (no walls or body segments).\n\n2. **Food Considerations**: \n   - Positive food at (4,6) (life span 6) is prioritized due to shorter life span. Moving R now sets up a path to reach it via subsequent U, U, L, U moves (as planned in the sequence).\n\n3. **Safety**: Moving R avoids all immediate risks (walls, body collisions) and aligns with the long-term plan to eat (4,6). \n\nThus, the action for Turn 59 is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Invalid.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The food at (4,6) will disappear after turn 64, so it must be eaten now or next turn to gain its reward.\n- Moving left (L) to (3,5) is safe but misses the opportunity to eat (4,6). From (3,5), the snake cannot reach (4,6) on turn 64 because (4,5) is occupied by the body.\n- Moving up (U) to (4,6) allows the snake to eat the food and grow. After this:\n  - On turn 64, the only valid move is left (L) to (3,6), where another food is available.\n  - This sequence maximizes immediate score (+2 from two foods) and is safe.\n\n### Risks:\n- After eating (4,6) and (3,6), the snake is in the top-left corner with limited space, but the food at (3,1) is unlikely to be reachable in time (must be eaten by turn 67). However, the +2 score from the two foods is guaranteed, while the +1 from (3,1) is uncertain.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to **move up (U)** to eat the food at (4,6), securing the +1 reward and setting up the snake to eat another food at (3,6) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This will:\n1. Increase score by +1\n2. Grow snake length by +1\n3. Not cause any collisions (since (3,6) is free)\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The food at (4,5) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately.\n- The food at (3,1) is also under the body and will disappear soon (life span 4 at turn 64, so it will be gone by turn 68).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only safe and rewarding move at turn 64 is to go left to (3,6).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Cannot move L (left) due to no instant reverse.\n- **Food**:\n  - (4, 5): Value +1, Life span 2 (disappears after Turn 74).\n  - (1, 6): Value +1, Life span 4.\n  - (6, 2): Value +1, Life span 7.\n  - (6, 1): Value +1, Life span 10.\n\n### Constraints:\n1. **Food at (4, 5)**:\n   - Occupied by the snake's body (segment at (4,5)).\n   - To eat it, the snake must vacate (4,5) and then move the head there.\n   - Life span is 2 (must be eaten by Turn 74), but it's impossible to vacate (4,5) in time because the snake's body is coiled around it. Thus, ignore this food.\n2. **Other Food**:\n   - (1,6): Too far (Manhattan distance 8), cannot reach before it disappears (life span 4).\n   - (6,2) and (6,1): Reachable with longer life spans.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,1):\n1. **U (up to (4,2))**:\n   - Valid: (4,2) is empty.\n   - Next moves: From (4,2), can move R to (5,2) or U to (4,3). Moving U to (4,3) leads to a dead end (no further moves), so must move R to (5,2).\n   - From (5,2), can reach (6,2) to eat food.\n2. **R (right to (5,1))**:\n   - Valid: (5,1) is empty.\n   - Next moves: From (5,1), can move R to (6,1) to eat food immediately (Turn 74).\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving **R to (5,1)** allows eating (6,1) on Turn 74, then (6,2) on Turn 75. This is more direct and avoids dead ends.\n- Moving U to (4,2) requires more turns to reach food and risks dead ends.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{R}",

The sequence of actions for the next few turns is forced due to movement constraints and obstacles.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{D}  \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Available Moves**: From the current head position (3,5) with direction **D**, the possible moves are **D** to (3,4) or **L** to (2,5). Moving **U** is opposite to the current direction and blocked by the body, while **R** is blocked by the body.\n2. **Left Move (L)**: Leads to a dead end quickly (e.g., trapped at (1,5) or (1,6)), so it is unsafe.\n3. **Down Move (D)**: Allows the snake to navigate towards the center and avoid immediate collisions. The subsequent moves are forced (e.g., **D** again to (3,3), then **R** to (4,3)), which keeps the snake alive longer.\n4. **Food Considerations**: The food at (6,1) is unreachable due to its short lifespan. The food at (5,1) and (5,3) is under the body and cannot be eaten in time. The food at (3,5) under the head can be revisited later if the snake survives.\n\nThus, **D** is the optimal immediate action.",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game:\n\n- **Grid Size**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). Borders (x=0,7 or y=0,7) and internal obstacles [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)] are walls.\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (3,3), direction Down (D).\n  - Body segments: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] (total length 15).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,1): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 86).\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 88).\n  - (3,5): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 91).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3,3), Direction D\n\nFrom the current head position (3,3) moving Down (D), the possible immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (3,2)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake body → Valid.\n2. **Left (L)**: (2,3)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake body → Valid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,3)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake body → Valid.\n4. **Up (U)**: (3,4)\n   - Opposite to current direction D → Invalid (no instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nAll food items are currently under the snake's body:\n\n- (5,1): Occupied by the 11th segment.\n- (5,3): Occupied by the 9th segment.\n- (3,5): Occupied by the 3rd segment.\n\n**Rules for Eating Food Under Body**:\n1. The body moves away from the food cell.\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nFor a body segment to move away without another segment immediately occupying the cell, it must be the tail. Currently, the tail is at (2,2), not on any food cell. Therefore, none of the food items can be eaten immediately or in the near future because:\n\n- The tail is far from the food positions.\n- The life spans are too short to maneuver the tail to the food positions before they disappear.\n\n### Survival Strategy\n\nSince eating the existing food is impractical within their life spans, the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive, possibly waiting for new food to spawn (though not specified in the rules).\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and future flexibility:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - New head: (3,2), direction D.\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2), D:\n     - D to (3,1): Occupied by body → Invalid.\n     - L to (2,2): Free.\n     - R to (4,2): Free.\n   - This opens paths to the left or right next turn.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - New head: (2,3), direction L.\n   - Next possible moves from (2,3), L:\n     - L to (1,3): Free.\n     - D to (2,2): Free.\n     - U to (2,4): Obstacle → Invalid.\n   - This allows exploration towards the top-left.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - New head: (4,3), direction R.\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3), R:\n     - R to (5,3): Occupied by body → Invalid.\n     - D to (4,2): Free.\n     - U to (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid.\n   - Only D to (4,2) is possible next, limiting options.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\n- Moving **Right (R)** leads to a forced move Down next turn, reducing flexibility.\n- Moving **Down (D)** allows choosing Left or Right next, offering more options.\n- Moving **Left (L)** also provides options to go Left or Down next, exploring less congested areas.\n\nBetween Down and Left, moving **Left (L)** seems better because:\n\n- It moves the snake towards the less crowded top-left area.\n- The tail is at (2,2), and moving Left to (2,3) then possibly Down to (2,2) can help in freeing up space as the tail moves away from (2,2).\n\n### Verifying Left Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (2,3):\n\n- New snake positions: head (2,3), body (3,3) to (2,1), tail (2,1).\n- Next turn (t=85), from (2,3), direction L:\n  - Possible moves:\n    - L to (1,3): Free.\n    - D to (2,2): Free (tail was at (2,2), now moved to (2,1), so (2,2) is free).\n  - Choosing L to (1,3) continues exploring the top-left.\n\nThis sequence seems safe and provides more open space for future moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, the best immediate move is **Left (L)** to (2,3), as it provides flexibility for future moves and avoids immediate dead-ends.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Free.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,0)\n   - (4,0) is a wall (y=0). Invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,1)\n   - (3,1) is occupied by the snake (body segment). Invalid (collision).\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,1)\n   - (5,1) is the tail of the snake.

Cannot be eaten immediately.\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,2)**:\n   - Next turn, can move Up to (4,3) to eat food (life span 9).\n   - Avoids immediate dead ends.\n2. **Move Right (R) to (5,1)**:\n   - Moves towards the right side, which may lead to a dead end (as seen in the analysis).\n   - No immediate benefit (no food eaten).\n\n### Dead End Analysis:\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,1) may lead to a dead end as the snake gets trapped in the right side with limited space.\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,2) allows more flexibility and access to the food at (4,3) next turn.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (4,2).

Avoid!**\n\n2. **L (Left) to (3,2)**:\n   - (3,2) is occupied by the snake's body (segment 3). **Collision. Invalid move.**\n\n3. **R (Right) to (5,2)**:\n   - (5,2) is the current tail of the snake.\n   - Moving to the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - No food at (5,2), so the snake does not grow.\n   - This move keeps the snake alive and opens up future options.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The only safe move is **R (Right) to (5,2)**. The other moves either lead to immediate death or are invalid due to collisions.\n- The food at (3,5) cannot be eaten in time (it's under the body and will disappear soon), and the food at (4,3) is dangerous to eat now (traps the snake). Thus, survival is the priority.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

Moving here is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - **Left (L)**: (4, 3) - Contains positive food (+1).\n   - **Right (R)**: (6, 3) - Wall (internal obstacle), invalid.\n   - **Down (D)**: (5, 2) - Reverse direction, invalid.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - **(3, 5)**: Value +1, life_span 1 (disappears after this turn). Currently under the snake's body at (3, 5), so cannot be eaten this turn.\n   - **(4, 3)**: Value +1, life_span 6. Accessible by moving left (L).\n   - **(6, 4)**: Value +1, life_span 9. Not adjacent to the head.\n\n4. **Immediate Options**:\n   - **Move U (Up)**: Safe, no food eaten.\n   - **Move L (Left)**: Eats food at (4, 3), but leads to a dead end next turn (no safe moves from (4, 3)).\n\n### Decision for Turn 92\n\n- **Move L (Left)**: Leads to eating food but results in immediate death on the next turn (no safe moves from (4, 3)). **Not viable**.\n- **Move U (Up)**: Safe, avoids death, and allows for future moves. The tail at (5, 4) will move away, so no collision.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 92\n\nThe only viable move to ensure survival is **Up (U)**. Moving left would lead to certain death on the next turn, while moving up keeps the snake alive and allows for future opportunities to eat food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 96 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacles (Walls)**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (4,6)\n  - Body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]\n  - Tail: (4,6) is the last segment, but since the head is at (4,6), this seems like a loop. Wait, the snake's positions are given as a list where the head is first, followed by body segments. So the tail is the last element in the list, which is (3,6).\n  \n  Wait, the snake positions are [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,6)], so head is at (4,6), and tail is at (3,6).\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: \"U\" (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards to reach (4,6) from its previous position. The previous position would be (4,5), since the first body segment is (4,5).\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (4,3): value = 1, life_span = 3 (disappears after Turn 98)\n  - (6,4): value = 1, life_span = 5 (disappears after Turn 100)\n  - (6,6): value = 1, life_span = 8 (disappears after Turn 103)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,6)\n\nFrom the current head position (4,6), with direction \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,7) - y=7 is a border wall. **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,5) - Check if this is safe.\n   - (4,5) is part of the snake's body (second segment). \n   - Rule: Moving into a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail. Here, (4,5) is not the tail (tail is (3,6)), so **invalid** (collision with body).\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,6) - Check safety.\n   - (3,6) is the tail segment. \n   - Rule: Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away. **Valid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,6) - Check safety.\n   - (5,6) is an internal obstacle (wall). **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n   - Also, moving right from direction \"U\" is not an instant reverse (reverse would be \"D\"), so direction-wise it's allowed, but the wall blocks it.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (3,6).\n\n### Verifying the Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current head is at (4,6), tail at (3,6). They are adjacent (left of head is tail).\n- Is there food at the tail (3,6)? Checking the food positions: (4,3), (6,4), (6,6). No food at (3,6). So no danger here.\n\n### Checking Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan from Turn 95 suggested:\n- Turn 95: U\n- Turn 96: L\n- Turn 97: L\n- ...\n\nAt Turn 96, the suggested move is L, which aligns with our current valid move.\n\n### Next Steps After Moving Left to (3,6)\n\nIf we move to (3,6), the new head is at (3,6), and the tail was at (3,6), which is now the head. The new tail will be the previous second-to-last segment, which is (3,5).\n\nNew snake positions:\n- Head: (3,6)\n- Body: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,5)]\n- Tail: (3,5)\n\nDirection after moving left is \"L\".\n\n### Food Considerations\n\n- (4,3): Disappears after Turn 98. Currently at Turn 96, so can be eaten on Turns 96, 97, or 98.\n  - To eat (4,3), the head needs to move to (4,3). Currently at (4,6), with (4,5) and (4,4) blocked (body and wall respectively), so cannot reach (4,3) directly.\n- Other foods are too far to reach immediately.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 96\n\nThe only safe and valid move is **Left (L)** to (3,6). This aligns with the previous plan and avoids any collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",
