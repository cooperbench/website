I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> The current state is at turn t1 = 0:\n> \n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but with internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> - Snake positions: Only one segment, which is the head at (3,3). Since it's just the head, there's no body to collide with yet. The snake head direction is L, meaning it's facing left, so last move was left.\n> \n> - Food: Three pieces of food, all with value +1 and life span 10. They are at:\n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 10\n> - (2,2): value 1, life span 10\n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> Since the snake is only one cell long, eating any food will make it grow to two cells. But I need to be careful with the tail reward danger later, but for now, since there's no tail, it might not be an issue immediately.\n> \n> The head direction is L, so from (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3). But I need to check possible moves.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3): Up, Down, Left, Right.\n> \n> - Up: (x,y+1) = (3,4)\n> - Down: (x,y-1) = (3,2)\n> - Left: (x-1,y) = (2,3)\n> - Right: (x+1,y) = (4,3)\n> \n> But (4,3) has food, and it's adjacent. Also, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so I can't go outside. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for any y, and all y=0, y=7 for any x. But since grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way? Coordinates: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so 64 cells.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: e.g., (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7). But (0,0) to (0,7) is left wall, etc.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Now, for moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Left to (2,3): (2,3) is not a wall or obstacle. Obstacles are (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3). (2,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Up to (3,4): (3,4) is not listed as obstacle, but (4,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is different.\n> \n> - Down to (3,2): (3,2) should be free.\n> \n> - Right to (4,3): (4,3) has food, but is it blocked? (4,3) is not a wall, and not an obstacle; obstacles are (4,4), which is above, but (4,3) should be free, and it has food.\n> \n> Also, since head direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to Right, because that would be opposite direction. Current direction L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move Right on this turn because of no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current turn is t1=0, and head direction is L, so for this turn, I cannot move Right because that would be opposite to Left.\n> \n> So possible actions this turn: U, D, L (since L is same as current, which is allowed), but moving Left is continuing left, which is fine, not reverse. Reverse would be going opposite, so from L, reverse is R.\n> \n> So at turn 0, I can move: U, D, or L. Not R.\n> \n> Now, food is at (4,3), which is right, but I cannot move right this turn because of no reverse. So I can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is up, (2,2) is down-left, (4,3) is right but blocked for this turn.\n> \n> Since snake is only one cell, no body collision risk.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So I should plan a sequence of actions for turns 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n> \n> Also, food life span: all have life span 10, and countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on. But since we start at turn 0, and life span 10, it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn 9? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, L becomes L-1. When L=0, it disappears after that turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t is completed, life_span becomes L-1. If after some turn, L-1=0, then it disappears, so it cannot be eaten on that turn or after.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns where the countdown is from N down to 1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, it can be eaten, and after the turn, countdown decreases to L-1. So if L=1 at start of turn, it can be eaten that turn, and after that, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, if L=10 at turn 0, it can be eaten on turns 0 to 9, and disappears after turn 9 or at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think \"including current\" means that at turn t, the countdown is decreased at the beginning or during? The phrasing is a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> To be safe, let's assume that at the start of a turn, the life span is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn. So for life span N, it can be eaten for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span 10 means it will be available for 10 turns: t, t+1, ..., t+9, and disappear after turn t+9.\n> \n> After turn t+9, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, here at turn 0, life span 10, so food can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> At (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), or L to (2,3).\n> \n> I cannot move R to (4,3) because of no reverse.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, but I can't reach it this turn.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is (3,5), which is up from (3,3), but (3,4) is in between, so I need to go up twice to reach it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is left and down, from (3,3) to (2,3) then (2,2) or (3,2) then (2,2), etc.\n> \n> (4,3) is adjacent but blocked by no reverse.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Since I have to think long-term, I should consider which food to target and how to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Also, with internal obstacles, the grid has some blocked cells.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,3)\n> \n> Food: (3,5), (2,2), (4,3)\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is right of head, but I can't move right now.\n> \n> Possible paths:\n> \n> If I move Left to (2,3) at turn 0.\n> \n> Then at (2,3), I can move U, D, L, or R? Direction: after moving left, head direction becomes L, so for next turn, I can move U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n> \n> From (2,3), moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,4): but (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (2,2): (2,2) has food, but is it free? (2,2) is not listed as wall or obstacle, so yes.\n> \n> - L to (1,3): (1,3) should be free.\n> \n> - R to (3,3): but that's where I came from, but since snake is only one cell now, moving back to (3,3) might be possible, but (3,3) is empty now? After moving to (2,3), the previous position is empty.\n> \n> But for collision: since only head, no body, so moving to (3,3) is fine, but it's the same cell? No, from (2,3) moving right to (3,3), which was the previous position.\n> \n> But with one cell snake, after move, the tail is gone, so (3,3) is free.\n> \n> But direction: if I move right from (2,3) to (3,3), that would be opposite to current direction L? After moving left to (2,3), direction is L. Then moving right to (3,3) is opposite, so I cannot do that because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) but obstacle, blocked; D to (2,2) possible; L to (1,3) possible; R to (3,3) but reverse, not allowed. So only D or L.\n> \n> D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n> \n> (2,2) has food, so if I move D to (2,2), I can eat it at turn 1 if I go that way.\n> \n> But let's not decide yet.\n> \n> If at turn 0 I move Up to (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is not obstacle, free.\n> \n> Then from (3,4), direction U (if I moved up).\n> \n> Moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U to (3,5): (3,5) has food.\n> \n> - D to (3,3): but reverse?

So I could eat it at turn 1.\n> \n> If I move Down at turn 0 to (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) free.\n> \n> Direction D.\n> \n> Then from (3,2), moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,3): reverse, not allowed (since direction D, up is opposite)\n> \n> - D to (3,1): possible, but y=0 is wall? y=0 is bottom wall, so (3,1) is not wall, y=0 is wall, so y=1 is inside, I think.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> So (3,1) is free, not wall.\n> \n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) has food.\n> \n> - R to (4,2): should be free.\n> \n> From (3,2), with direction D:\n> \n> - U to (3,3): reverse, not allowed\n> \n> - D to (3,1): allowed\n> \n> - L to (2,2): allowed\n> \n> - R to (4,2): allowed\n> \n> Now, (2,2) has food, so I can move L to eat it.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,3) is still there, but I need to get to it.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 0 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (2,3) at turn 0.\n> \n> Then at turn 1, from (2,3), I can only move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n> \n> If I move D to (2,2), I eat food at turn 1, snake grows to length 2.\n> \n> Then position: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)?

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it's safe to move to the tail cell, because the tail moves out of that cell at the same time.\n> \n> Similarly, here, moving to (3,4) from (3,5) is down, and (3,4) is tail, so it should be safe, no collision.\n> \n> Then after move, head at (3,4), tail was at (3,4) but moves to where? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment to previous position.\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ] head to tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (3,4): head moves to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by tail. Since it's the tail, and head moves there, tail moves to the position it was going to, but in this case, since it's moving down, the segment that was at (3,4) becomes the new head? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So when head moves from (3,5) to (3,4), it occupies (3,4), and the tail, which was at (3,4), needs to move, but since it's the only body segment, it disappears or moves to where the head was?

Value is +1 for all, so they're all good to eat.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are walls that the snake can't move into.\n> \n> Since the snake has only one segment, the tail is the head itself. But when it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Current head direction is Down. So from (3,2), moving Down would go to (3,1). But y=0 is a wall, so (3,1) is within bounds? y=0 is the wall, so y=1 is valid? Let's clarify the grid.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

No.\n> \n> Typically in grids, if walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, that means cells from (0,0) to (7,7) exist, but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. So the snake can be on (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But let's confirm.\n> \n> Snake is at (3,2), which should be valid. Moving Down from (3,2) would go to (3,1), but y=1 is not y=0, so (3,1) might be valid? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable. Similarly, y=6 is playable, y=7 wall. x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 should be playable.\n> \n> But let's list the walls:\n> \n> - Border: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.

So the inner grid is from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Snake at (3,2): x=3, y=2, which is within (1,1) to (6,6), so valid.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are additional walls.\n> \n> (5,6): x=5,y=6, which might be on the border? y=6 is not y=7, so y=6 is playable, but (5,6) is an internal obstacle, so wall. Similarly, (1,4), (4,4), etc.\n> \n> Now, head direction Down, so from (3,2), possible moves: since direction is D, we can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

No food, so just move, no eat. Snake positions: head to (1,2), tail moves from (3,2) to (2,2)? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves forward, so body segments shift.\n> \n> After turn 1: snake at [(2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> Move without eating: head moves to new position, say (1,2), then new positions: head at (1,2), and body at (2,2).

Let's parse.\n> \n> The condition: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail\" – meaning before the move, head and tail are adjacent cells.\n> \n> Then, \"and the tail cell has positive food\" – the cell where the tail is has food on it.\n> \n> Then, if head moves to that tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the snake grows, so the new tail is at the previous tail position, but since head moved to tail, and we add a segment, it might cause collision.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake positions: head at A, tail at B, and B has food. If head is adjacent to B, and moves to B, then after move, head is at B, and since it ate, a new segment is added at the previous head position, so new positions: head at B, body at A, and the old tail B is gone, but new segment at A, so now snake is [B, A], with head at B, tail at A.\n> \n> Since A and B were adjacent, and now head at B, tail at A, they are adjacent, but not colliding because head and tail are different cells. Collision is when head touches any body segment. Body segments are from head to tail.\n> \n> In this case, positions [B, A], head at B, one body segment at A. So if B and A are adjacent, that's fine, no collision, because the tail is not considered for collision except if head moves into it before it moves, but when moving, tail moves away.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if it eats, a new segment is added at the previous head position, so the tail doesn't move. If not, tail moves forward.\n> \n> Collision: head collides with any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> In this rule, \"tail reward danger\": it says because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Let's read: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, scenario: head adjacent to tail. Tail cell has food. Head moves to tail cell to eat the food.\n> \n> After eating: head is now at the former tail cell. A new segment is added at the former head position. So the snake grows: the new tail is the segment that was added, which is at the former head position.\n> \n> Since head was adjacent to tail, and head moved to tail, so the new head is at old tail, and the new segment is at old head, which is adjacent to new head. So now, the head and the new segment (which is part of body) are adjacent, but not overlapping. Collision only if same cell.\n> \n> But they are different cells, so no immediate collision. However, when the snake moves next, if the head is adjacent to the body, it might collide if it moves into it, but not necessarily.\n> \n> The rule says \"will collide\" meaning after the move, the head is on the same cell as the new tail? I think I misread.\n> \n> \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" – after eating, the head is at the food cell, and the newly grown segment is at the previous head position. If they were adjacent, they are still adjacent, but different cells. Collision happens when head moves into a cell occupied by body.\n> \n> But in this case, after the eat move, no collision yet. The danger might be that on the next move, if the head cannot move without colliding, but it depends.\n> \n> Perhaps the rule means that since the new tail is added at the old head, and if head and old tail were adjacent, after move, new head and new tail are adjacent, and if the snake tries to move back, it might collide, but it's not immediate.\n> \n> The rule states it kills the snake, so I think it's considered a collision because the head occupies the cell where the tail was, and since a new segment is added, the tail doesn't move, so effectively, the head is on a cell that will have the tail, but at different times.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity, but from the description: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide\" – I think it means that after growing, the head is at position P, and the new tail is at Q, and if P and Q are the same, but they can't be, or adjacent, but collision requires same cell.\n> \n> Perhaps in the context, when the head moves to the tail cell to eat, and since the tail is there, but when head moves to tail, the tail is still there at that moment, so head collides with body immediately.\n> \n> That might be it.\n> \n> Let's think: before move, head at H, tail at T, and H and T are adjacent. T has food. When head moves to T, at the moment of move, the cell T is occupied by the tail, so moving head to T causes head to collide with body segment at T, which is not the head itself. Since tail is a body segment, yes, colliding with any body segment except that the tail might move, but in this case, because we are moving to the tail cell, and if we eat, the tail doesn't move; it stays, and we add a segment.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: head at H, tail at T, H adjacent to T. T has food.\n> \n> - Move head to T: now, head is moving to T, which is occupied by tail. Since tail is a body segment, this is a collision, and snake dies, because you can't move to a cell with body.\n> \n> But the rule says \"the tail will also move forward\" only if not eating. When eating, tail doesn't move; it stays, and we add a new segment at the previous head.\n> \n> So when moving to T to eat, T is occupied by tail, so head cannot move to an occupied cell, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> Ah, yes, that makes sense. So if the head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it collides and dies. The tail is a body segment, so if head moves to tail cell, and tail is there, it collides, unless the tail moves away at the same time, but when not eating, tail moves away, so it's ok to move to the tail cell because tail leaves. But when eating, tail doesn't move, so the cell is occupied, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it to eat, but the cell is occupied by tail, so collision.\n> \n> The rule specifies: \"food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For tail, if food is on tail cell, when tail moves away, the food is exposed, then head can move to it later.\n> \n> But in this danger case, if head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, if head moves to tail cell, it would collide with tail, so it can't move there anyway. So the danger is that attempting to eat the food when it's on the tail and head is adjacent causes collision.\n> \n> The rule says \"eating it kills\", but actually, moving to that cell causes collision before eating.\n> \n> So in practice, you can't move to the tail cell if it has food and head is adjacent, because it's occupied.\n> \n> For other body cells, similar.\n> \n> But in this case, for turn 1, snake has only one cell, no tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Back to the game.\n> \n> Turn 1: I can move L to (2,2) to eat F2.\n> \n> Or move R to (4,2), then to (4,3) to eat F3 soon.\n> \n> Or move D to (3,1), but that might be less useful.\n> \n> Let's evaluate options.\n> \n> First option: move L to (2,2) on turn 1, eat F2, score +1, snake now at [(2,2), (3,2)], direction L.\n> \n> Turn 2: from (2,2), direction L, possible moves: U, D, L (not R, reverse).\n> \n> - Move U to (2,3): no food, move only.

Since it's moving left, from (3,2) to (2,2), so last move was left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn. So I can go U, D, or L. R is not allowed because it's the reverse.\n> \n> Head direction is L, meaning current direction is left, so I can't move right immediately.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 2: Up, Down, or Left.\n> \n> Left would be to (1,2), but let's check if that's valid.\n> \n> (1,2): is it within bounds? x=1 is not wall, y=2 not wall. Obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,2) is different, so should be ok.\n> \n> Up to (2,3)\n> \n> Down to (2,1)\n> \n> Right is invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and pathing.\n> \n> Food at (3,5), (4,3), (6,4)\n> \n> (4,3) is close to current position (2,2). Distance: from (2,2) to (4,3) is Δx=2, Δy=1, so Manhattan distance 3.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is Δx=1, Δy=3, distance 4.\n> \n> (6,4) is Δx=4, Δy=2, distance 6.\n> \n> But I need to consider the path and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, life span: all have high life span, 8 or 9, so I have time, but I should plan to eat soon to grow.\n> \n> But prioritize survival.\n> \n> Current snake length is 2, so it's small, but eating food increases length.\n> \n> Important: Tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and causes collision.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,2), no food there. Food is elsewhere.\n> \n> Now, let's think about possible moves for turn 2.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (1,2)\n> \n> Then, from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), R to (2,2) but (2,2) is where body is? After moving, snake positions: if I move left to (1,2), head is now (1,2), body is (2,2), and tail was (3,2) but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves away? When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves forward, so after move to (1,2), positions: head (1,2), then body (2,2), and tail segment was (3,2), but since moving, the tail moves to where the body was? Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position. So from positions [(2,2), (3,2)], if head moves to (1,2), then new positions: head (1,2), and the body segment that was at (2,2) moves to... the segment at (3,2) moves to (2,2), so new positions: [(1,2), (2,2)]\n> \n> Similarly, if I move up to (2,3), positions: [(2,3), (2,2)]\n> \n> If down to (2,1), [(2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> If I move left to (1,2), then from there, I can go U, D, or R (since head now at (1,2), direction would be L? After moving, direction changes.\n> \n> But for reverse, it's only the immediate next move that can't be reverse of current direction.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food life span decreases each turn, so after turn 2, life span of all food decreases by 1, so at turn 3, (3,5) life=7, (4,3) life=7, (6,4) life=8, and so on.\n> \n> But since they have high initial, not urgent.\n> \n> Now, let's consider paths to food.\n> \n> First, food at (4,3): that's close. From (2,2), to reach (4,3), I need to go right and up, but I can't go right now because reverse is not allowed. Current direction L, so I can't go R.\n> \n> So this turn, I have to go U, D, or L.\n> \n> If I go up to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go R to (3,3), then to (4,3), but (4,3) has food? Let's see.\n> \n> From (2,2), move U to (2,3). Turn 2: U\n> \n> Then positions: head (2,3), body (2,2)\n> \n> Direction now U (since moved up).\n> \n> Then turn 3: possible moves U, D, L, R, but no reverse: since direction U, can't go D.\n> \n> So can go U to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so cannot go there.\n> \n> Can go L to (1,3), or R to (3,3), or D but D is reverse, invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible: L to (1,3), R to (3,3), U but U to (2,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> So only L or R.\n> \n> If I go R to (3,3), then head (3,3), body (2,3), tail (2,2) moves to (2,3)? Positions: after move to (3,3), head (3,3), body (2,3) since previous head was (2,3), now body, and previous body (2,2) moves to where head was? Standard snake: positions list, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> After turn 2 U: positions [(2,3), (2,2)]\n> \n> Turn 3, if move R to (3,3), then head to (3,3), body from (2,2) to (2,3)? No: the body segment that was at index 1 moves to the position that was index 0, but since only two segments, when head moves to (3,3), the body segment moves to where head was, which is (2,3). So new positions: [(3,3), (2,3)]\n> \n> Tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, (3,3) is head, and food at (4,3) is adjacent right. So I can move to (4,3) on turn 4? But let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Also, from (3,3), on turn 3, I just arrived, so for turn 4 I can move to (4,3).\n> \n> But I need to think if that's safe.\n> \n> First, from (2,2), if I move U to (2,3), then turn 3 I can move R to (3,3), then turn 4 to (4,3) to eat food.\n> \n> But (4,3) has food, so eating it would increase length.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so positions: when head moves to food cell, it eats, length increases, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case, turn 4: move to (4,3), which has food, so eat, length now 3. Positions: head (4,3), and body segments: previous head was (3,3), now body, and previous body (2,3) still there, and since ate, new segment added? When eat, the new head is on food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so positions: after move to (4,3), head (4,3), then body (3,3), and since ate, the tail stays, so body (2,3) remains, and new tail? Snake positions: before move, positions [(3,3), (2,3)], length 2.\n> \n> After move to (4,3), which has food, so head is (4,3), and the body segments are the same, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so positions become [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] , length 3.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? At (4,3), after eating, head is there.\n> \n> But I need to look further.\n> \n> If from (2,2) I move down instead.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1).\n> \n> Then positions [(2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Direction D.\n> \n> Then turn 3: can go L, R, or U? Direction D, can't go U (reverse), so can go D to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, invalid. Or L to (1,1), or R to (3,1).\n> \n> (2,0) is wall, so invalid. So only L or R.\n> \n> Say go R to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., but food is at (4,3), which is up, so it might take longer.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (1,2) first.\n> \n> Move L to (1,2), positions [(1,2), (2,2)]\n> \n> Direction L.\n> \n> Then turn 3: can go U, D, L? Direction L, can't go R (reverse), so U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 wall, invalid. So U or D.\n> \n> Say U to (1,3), then from there to (1,4), but (1,4) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> (1,4) is internal obstacle, so from (1,3), if I go U to (1,4), invalid.\n> \n> So only options from (1,3) are L? x=1, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3), D to (1,2) but (1,2) is body? Not necessarily, but after moves.\n> \n> From (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) obstacle, invalid; D to (1,2), which is where body is; but in snake, moving to a cell where body is, only if it's the tail and it moves away, but let's see.\n> \n> At turn 3, if I moved to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (1,2)\n> \n> Then turn 4, if I move D to (1,2), but (1,2) is currently occupied by body, and since it's not the tail (tail is moving), but when I move head to (1,2), which is where body is, but in snake, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by tail, it's ok, but here, if I move to (1,2), and body is at (1,2), but after move, the body will move to where? Current positions: head (1,3), body (1,2)\n> \n> If I move head to (1,2), which is occupied by body segment. Now, since the body segment at (1,2) is not the tail? In this case, with two segments, body (1,2) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Let's clarify: positions [(1,3), (1,2)] , so head (1,3), tail at (1,2).\n> \n> If I move head to (1,2), same cell as tail. But in snake, moving head to tail cell: since tail will move away when the snake moves, but when head moves to tail cell, and if no food eaten, tail moves, so head can occupy the cell that was tail, because tail leaves it.\n> \n> But here, if I move head to (1,2), which is current tail position, and since no food eaten, tail moves to the previous position? But in this move, when head moves to (1,2), the tail was at (1,2), but it moves to where? The movement: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So if positions are [(1,3), (1,2)], and head moves to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied by tail. After move, head is at (1,2), and the body segment (which was tail) moves to where the head was, which is (1,3)? Let's index: segment 0: head (1,3), segment 1: tail (1,2).\n> \n> Move head to (1,2). New head position (1,2). Then segment 1 (tail) moves to previous position of segment 0, which was (1,3). So new positions: [(1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> So now head at (1,2), tail at (1,3). No collision because the tail moved.\n> \n> But moving to (1,2) from (1,3) is down, and direction was U? From turn 3, head at (1,3), direction from previous move, which was U from (1,2) to (1,3), so direction U.\n> \n> Moving to (1,2) is down, which is reverse, but for the move, the no instant reverse is for consecutive moves, not for the position.\n> \n> No instant reverse means that on the next turn, you cannot move opposite to the current direction.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 3, head at (1,3), direction U (since moved up to there), so I cannot move D (down) because it's reverse. So moving to (1,2) is invalid because it's opposite direction.\n> \n> From (1,3), with direction U, possible moves: U, L, R, but U to (1,4) obstacle, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3), D invalid. So only possible move is R to (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if I had gone D from (1,2) earlier.\n> \n> But back to point.\n> \n> From current position (2,2), moving left to (1,2) might not be great because it's near the wall and obstacles.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,1) is similar, near wall.\n> \n> Moving up to (2,3) seems better, as I can go to (3,3) then to (4,3) for food.\n> \n> But from (2,3), to go to (3,3), then (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is food, so I can eat it on turn 4 if I sequence right.\n> \n> Turn 2: move U to (2,3)\n> \n> Then positions [(2,3), (2,2)], direction U.\n> \n> Turn 3: from (2,3), can move R to (3,3) (since U to (2,4) obstacle, L to (1,3), D invalid reverse, so R to (3,3) is possible).\n> \n> Move R to (3,3), positions [(3,3), (2,3)], direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Turn 4: move R to (4,3), which has food, so eat.

It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3).\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3). So the snake has three segments, and it's moving right, since head direction is R. That means from (4,3), moving right would go to (5,3), but I need to be careful about obstacles and walls.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 5 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 6 and value +1\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 9 and value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 5, for (3,5), life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns? Let me read the life-span rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for (3,5), life span is 5 at turn 5. That means it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left, including turn 5. So after turn 5, it has 4 left; after turn 6, 3 left, and so on, disappearing after turn 9? I need to clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So for food at (3,5) at turn 5 with life span 5, it will be present for turns 5,6,7,8,9, and disappear after turn 9 or before turn 10? Typically, it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t. After the turn, L decreases by 1. When L reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after the turn? I think it's standard to assume that after the turn where L decreases to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's define: at the beginning of turn t, food with life span L is present. After actions are taken, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If after decrease, L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when each food will expire.\n> \n> For (3,5): life span 5 at turn 5, so:\n> \n> - Turn 5: present, after turn, life span becomes 4\n> \n> - Turn 6: present, after turn, life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 7: present, after turn, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 8: present, after turn, life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 9: present, after turn, life span 0, disappears\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn 5 to turn 9 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4): life span 6 at turn 5, so present turns 5 to 10 inclusive (since after turn 10, life span 0, disappears).\n> \n> Life span 6 at turn 5:\n> \n> - After turn 5: 5 left\n> \n> - After turn 6: 4 left\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - After turn 10: 0 left, disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): life span 9 at turn 5, present until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,3), moving right. So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can go R (right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on this turn.\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible actions: R to (5,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2).\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions or obstacles.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), inclusive? Typically, walls are at x=0, x=8? No, it says \"x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", and \"cells occupied by walls\", so I think the walls are at the borders, so positions with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning snake cannot go there.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle?

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 6 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 4), (2, 4), (6, 3)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (3, 5, 4, 1)\n\t- (6, 4, 5, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 6 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the boundaries are walls. Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So, these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,2), then body segments at (4,3) and tail at (3,3). So the snake has 3 segments. Head direction is down (D), meaning it was moving down to (4,2) from (4,1) or something? Let's see: positions are [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]. Head is (4,2), and it's moving down, so it came from above. Since head direction is D, it moved to (4,2) from (4,1), I assume, but (4,1) isn't in the positions, so it must be that before moving, head was at (4,1) and it moved down to (4,2), but the positions list is after the move, I think.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Positions\" at turn t1=6, so this is the position after the move to (4,2). Head direction is D, meaning the direction it just moved to get to (4,2). So, it was at (4,1) before moving down to (4,2), and the body followed: previous head was at (4,1), which is now the neck at (4,3)? Positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), then (3,3). Since it moved down to (4,2), the previous position was (4,1) for head, but now (4,1) is not listed, so the body segments are the previous positions. Let's trace: after moving down, head is at (4,2), the segment that was head is now at (4,3), and the tail was at (3,3) but should move to where the previous segment was? I need to think about how snake movement works.\n> \n> Standard snake: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So, before move, positions were: head at (4,1), body at (4,2)? Let's assume turn t1=6 state is after the move.\n> \n> At turn 5, snake was at some position, then it moved down, so head from (4,1) to (4,2), the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where? The positions are given as [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)] after the move.\n> \n> Perhaps: before move, positions were [(4,1), (4,2), (3,3)] or something. Let's infer: after moving down, head is at (4,2), which was previously occupied by the first body segment. The first body segment moves to where the second body segment was, but it's messy.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and positions are head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (3,3), this means that before moving down, the head was at (4,1), and it moved to (4,2). The cell (4,2) was occupied by the first body segment, which moves to (4,3), but (4,3) was occupied by the tail? Positions after move: head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (3,3). Before move, head was at (4,1), body segment 1 was at (4,2), body segment 2 (tail) was at (3,3). After moving down: head to (4,2), so body segment 1 moves to where body segment 2 was, but body segment 2 was at (3,3), so body segment 1 moves to (3,3)? But in positions, after move, it's (4,3) for body? I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments follow the head. When head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So, for a snake with segments [H, B1, B2, T], after move, new head position based on direction, B1 to old H, B2 to old B1, T to old B2.\n> \n> Here, snake has three segments: let's call them H, B, T.\n> \n> At turn 6 after move: H at (4,2), B at (4,3), T at (3,3).\n> \n> Since head moved down to (4,2), that means before move, H was at (4,1), and after move to (4,2), B moves to old H position (4,1)? But in positions, B is at (4,3), not (4,1). Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so [head, segment1, segment2] where segment2 is tail.\n> \n> Before move: positions [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,3) ]  // head at (4,1), segment1 at (4,2), tail at (3,3)\n> \n> Move down: head to (4,2) (which was segment1 position), segment1 moves to where tail was? No, segment1 moves to the previous position of segment2? Let's think.\n> \n> When head moves, it occupies a new cell. Then each body segment moves to the cell where the next segment was.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second body segment moves to the old first body position, and so on.\n> \n> So, before move: head at P_h, body at P_b, tail at P_t.\n> \n> After moving head to new position P_new:\n> \n> - New head: P_new\n> \n> - New body: old P_h\n> \n> - New tail: old P_b\n> \n> But in this case, there are three segments, so positions: head, body, tail.\n> \n> Before move: head at (4,1), body at (4,2), tail at (3,3)\n> \n> Move down: head to (4,2) (which is down from (4,1), so (4,2) is the new position).\n> \n> Then new body should be at old head position: (4,1)\n> \n> New tail should be at old body position: (4,2)\n> \n> But in the given positions after move: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n> \n> (4,3) and (3,3) don't match. (4,3) is different.\n> \n> Perhaps I have the coordinates wrong. y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The problem doesn't specify, but U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might mean y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, or vice versa?\n> \n> U is (x,y+1), so if y+1, it could be moving up if y increases upwards, or down if y increases downwards. The problem says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so for example, from (x,y), U to (x,y+1) is up, so y+1 is higher y, which might be north, so y=0 could be south or north? It doesn't matter, but for consistency, let's assume y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row, so U increases y (up), D decreases y (down). Similarly, L decreases x (left), R increases x (right).\n> \n> But in the positions, head at (4,2), moving down to (4,2) from where? If it moved down to (4,2), it came from (4,3) or (4,1)? Head direction is D, so it was moving down to (4,2), so from (4,3) to (4,2) or from (4,1) to (4,2)? If D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y, so from higher y to lower y.\n> \n> If head is at (4,2) and direction is D, that means it just moved down to (4,2), so from (4,3) to (4,2), because y decreased from 3 to 2.\n> \n> Then before move, head was at (4,3), and it moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> Then the body segments: before move, positions were [ (4,3), (4,2), (3,3) ] or something.\n> \n> Let's say before move, snake positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,2), tail at (3,3) or whatever.\n> \n> After moving down to (4,2):\n> \n> - New head at (4,2)\n> \n> - New body at old head position: (4,3)\n> \n> - New tail at old body position: but what was old body position? If before move, body was at P_b, after move, new body is at old head position, new tail is at old body position.\n> \n> For three segments: before move: [H_old, B_old, T_old] = [ (4,3), (4,2), (3,3) ]  // for example\n> \n> After move down: head moves to (4,2) which is down from (4,3), so (4,2) is the new head position.\n> \n> Then new body is at old head position: (4,3)\n> \n> New tail is at old body position: (4,2)\n> \n> But in the given positions after move: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)], so new head (4,2), new body (4,3), new tail (3,3).\n> \n> But new tail is (3,3), which was the old tail position, not old body position.

No, head at (4,3) moving down to (4,2)? (4,2) is down if y decreases, but (4,3) to (4,2) is down, y from 3 to 2.\n> \n> Then new head at (4,2)\n> \n> New body at old H position: (4,3)\n> \n> New tail at old B position: (4,2)\n> \n> But old B position was (4,2), but new head is at (4,2), so conflict? (4,2) is occupied by both? No, when head moves to (4,2), it was previously occupied by B, so B moves away.\n> \n> After move, new positions: head at (4,2), body at old H (4,3), tail at old B (4,2) but (4,2) is now head, so tail can't be at (4,2).\n> \n> I'm confusing the indexing.\n> \n> Perhaps the tail moves to the old body position, but in this case, old body was at (4,2), which is now the new head, so it's messy.\n> \n> Let's look at the positions given: after move, snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n> \n> This means that the head is at (4,2), the first body segment is at (4,3), and the tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> Since the head moved down to (4,2), and it was at (4,3) before, because direction D from (4,3) to (4,2).\n> \n> Before move, head was at (4,3), and after moving down to (4,2), the first body segment moves to the old head position, which is (4,3), but (4,3) is now the position of the first body segment.\n> \n> The tail was at (3,3) before, and after move, it moves to where the first body segment was before the move.\n> \n> Before move, first body segment was at some position.\n> \n> Assume before move at turn 5, positions were: head at (4,3), first body segment at (4,2), tail at (3,3) or something.\n> \n> List the cells:\n> \n> At turn 6 after move: head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (3,3)\n> \n> So, before move, head was at (4,3) and moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> The cell (4,2) was occupied by the first body segment before move.\n> \n> After head moves to (4,2), the first body segment moves to the position where the tail was or something?

Let's see: positions are [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)], so head at (3,2), then the segment behind is (4,2), and behind that is (4,3). So the snake is: head at (3,2), then it turns down to (4,2)?

(4,3) to (4,2) is down, then from (4,2) to (3,2) left.

So (4,2) is a body segment, so moving right to (4,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: (3,1) is y=1, not y=0, so not wall; (2,2) not wall; (3,3) not wall.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction.

Let's see how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is left, and if no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If eating, head moves to food, new tail grows from where the tail was, so length increases, and the food cell becomes new head, but since head moves to it, it's occupied.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when moving without eating, new head position, then the previous head position becomes neck, and so on, tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> With eating, new head at food, previous positions remain, and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Here, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So after turn 7, if I move U to (3,3), new positions: head at (3,3), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, then (4,2) becomes body, and tail was (4,3), which moves?

Head direction is Up, so last move was U, meaning from (3,3) to (3,4).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Since current turn is 9, life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 9 if not eaten. So it must be eaten on turn 9 or it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn. So for food at (3,5), life span 1 on turn 9 means it has one turn left, so after turn 9, it's gone. To eat it, I need to move to (3,5) on turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 2. So it has 2 turns left, including turn 9. After turn 10, it disappears.\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 5. 5 turns left.\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 8. 8 turns left.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and it increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, my snake is at [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)], head at (3,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move Down on the next turn because that would be instant reverse. So possible moves from (3,4) are: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Moving U would go to (3,5), which has food! (3,5) has food with life span 1, so if I move U now, I eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks. Also, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Tail is at (3,2). Head is at (3,4), so adjacent cells: directly adjacent are (3,5) up, (3,3) down, (2,4) left, (4,4) right.\n> \n> (3,3) is the body segment, not tail. Tail is (3,2), which is two cells away. Not adjacent to head. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) up, (2,4) left, (4,4) right, and (3,3) down, but (3,3) is occupied by body, so not free.\n> \n> But for tail reward danger, it says if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food. Here, tail is at (3,2), head at (3,4), not adjacent. Distance is |4-2|=2 in y, same x, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n> \n> (3,3) is the body, so the tail is not adjacent. So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5), I eat the food. Since it's positive, my length increases by 1. After eating, the new position: head moves to (3,5), body was [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)], but since I eat, a new segment is added, so snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]. The tail doesn't move when you eat, right? In snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since the tail moves only when you don't eat, I need to recall.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail stays in place, so the snake grows by one segment. So after moving to food, the new head is at food, and the previous positions are all shifted, with tail unchanged, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: [head, body, ..., tail]\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail position is left.\n> \n> After moving to food: head moves to food, each segment moves to the next position, but since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays, and a new tail is added? No.\n> \n> Typically: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the head position? I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let me think: snake positions list, head first. When moving, new head position based on direction, and if not eating, the tail is removed. If eating, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows.\n> \n> So positions: current [A, B, C] where A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell: if empty, new positions [new_head, A, B] and C is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard: the snake moves one step: head to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So for positions [P0, P1, P2] with P0 head, P2 tail.\n> \n> After move to new position Q:\n> \n> - If not eating: new positions [Q, P0, P1] and P2 is removed (tail moves).\n> \n> - If eating: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2] so tail P2 remains, and a new segment is effectively added.\n> \n> In terms of the list, it becomes [Q, P0, P1] without eating, or [Q, P0, P1, P2] with eating, but P2 was tail, now it's still there, so the new tail is P2, and length increased.\n> \n> In this case, current positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] so P0=(3,4), P1=(3,3), P2=(3,2)\n> \n> If I move to (3,5) and eat, new head Q=(3,5), and since eating, new positions: [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] so now length 4, tail at (3,2).\n> \n> If not eating, move to say (4,4), new positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] and (3,2) removed.\n> \n> Back to the move.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5), I eat the food there. (3,5) has food with life span 1, so I must eat it now or it disappears. Value +1.\n> \n> But is it safe? After moving, head at (3,5), body at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n> \n> Now, the grid: walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle! And I was thinking of moving R to (4,4), but (4,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot move L to (2,4).\n> \n> Current head at (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,5): is it free? (3,5) has food, but no obstacle. Obstacles are given, not listed as obstacle, so should be free except for the food.\n> \n> - D to (3,3): but (3,3) is occupied by body, so collision. Also, cannot move D because it's opposite direction? Current direction U, so moving D is reverse, not allowed. So D is invalid.\n> \n> - L to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - R to (4,4): (4,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot move.\n> \n> So the only possible move from (3,4) is U to (3,5). Is that right?\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,5), which is not wall, not body? (3,5) has food, but no body or wall, so I can move there.\n> \n> D is invalid because opposite direction and also body.\n> \n> L to (2,4) is wall.\n> \n> R to (4,4) is wall.\n> \n> So indeed, only U is possible? But let me confirm the obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Yes, (4,4) and (2,4) are obstacles.\n> \n> And (3,5) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free.\n> \n> Also, no body at (3,5), body is at (3,3) and (3,2).\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) has food with life span 1, so I eat it, grow to length 4.\n> \n> Then after that, I need to move from there.\n> \n> But I have to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Perhaps I should list all possible moves step by step.\n> \n> Current turn t=9.\n> \n> Only possible action: move U to (3,5).\n> \n> So for turn 9: action U.\n> \n> Now, after move: snake positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] head at (3,5), direction now U.\n> \n> Food eaten: (3,5) is consumed, so removed.\n> \n> Other food still there, but life span decreases.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including when not eaten? Yes, countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> After turn 9, food at (3,5) is eaten, gone.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) life span was 2, now after turn 9, it has life span 1? Turn 9: we are at the start of turn 9, I move, then after move, turn ends, life span decreases.\n> \n> State is given at turn 9, before action.\n> \n> After action, turn advances.\n> \n> So at turn 9, before action, food has life span as given.\n> \n> After I move and action is done, turn becomes 10, and all food life span decrease by 1.\n> \n> For (3,5), life span 1, if not eaten by end of turn 9, it disappears. Since I eat it, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life span 2, after turn 9, if not eaten, life span becomes 1 for turn 10.\n> \n> In general, at turn t, life span N means it has N turns left including t. So after turn t, if not eaten, life span N-1 for turn t+1, and so on.\n> \n> Now, after turn 9 action U, snake at [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)], head direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 10.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n> \n> Also, check walls and body.\n> \n> Body positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).

To reach (6,4) on turn 10, I need to be at (6,4) on turn 10 action.\n> \n> But from current position (3,5), after turn 10 action, I move to one of adjacent cells.\n> \n> After that, on turn 11, I could move further.\n> \n> But (6,4) must be eaten on turn 10, so I need to be at (6,4) when I take the turn 10 action.\n> \n> But from (3,5), I can only move to (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5) on turn 10. None is (6,4), so I cannot eat (6,4) on turn 10. Therefore, (6,4) will disappear after turn 10 without being eaten, since I can't reach it in time.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is at (6,4), which might be near obstacles, but anyway, unreachable in one step.\n> \n> So (6,4) will be gone after turn 10.\n> \n> Now, other food: (6,6) and (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), which is near left border.\n> \n> (6,6) is top-right.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to eat food while surviving.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, for turn 10, I need to choose a move: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid.\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake at [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n> \n> After turn 10 move, depending on where I go.\n> \n> I need to think 5 turns ahead, so to turn 14 or so.\n> \n> Also, avoid dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's consider the direction.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6):\n> \n> Then head at (3,6), body [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], tail at (3,2)? Positions: after move, if not eating, snake moves: new head (3,6), then (3,5) becomes body, (3,4) body, (3,3) body, and (3,2) removed? Since no eating.\n> \n> At turn 10, I move to a cell, but only if there is food I eat.\n> \n> Currently, at (3,6), is there food? Food at (6,4), (6,6), (1,5), not at (3,6), so no food, so not eating.\n> \n> Therefore, after moving to (3,6), new positions: head (3,6), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, (3,4) body, and since no eat, tail (3,2) is removed, so positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]? Let's see:\n> \n> Previous positions before turn 10 move: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] with (3,5) head.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6) and not eating: new head (3,6), then the body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,5), but since head moves, the segment that was at (3,5) moves to (3,5)?

Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 10, life_span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so I can only eat it on this turn if I go there.)\n> \n> Life_span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,4) with life_span 1, on turn 10, it will be gone by turn 11. So if I move to (6,4) on turn 10, I can eat it.\n> \n> - (6,6) value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (1,5) value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (3,2) value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> The food at (3,2) is under the snake's tail. Snake positions are [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)], so (3,2) is the tail. Food is at (3,2), value 1, life_span 10.\n> \n> But there's a special case: food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food is at tail (3,2). If I move such that the tail moves away, and head moves to (3,2), I can eat it. But when I eat, snake grows, so new tail will be where the old tail was, but since I'm moving, let's think.\n> \n> Snake head moves, if it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move that turn. Standard snake growth: when head eats food, the tail stays in place, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> But in this case, food is under the tail. So if I move the head to (3,2) when the tail is still there, but the tail will move only if no food eaten. Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, for tail: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, the head is at (3,5), tail at (3,2), which is not adjacent; adjacent means next to, like (3,3) or (2,2) or (4,2), etc., but (3,5) and (3,2) are three cells apart, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Currently, head (3,5) is not adjacent to tail (3,2). The body segments are in between.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. I should think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: borders x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, so 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake: positions (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). Head at (3,5), direction U (up), so last move was to (3,5) from below? Positions: (3,5) head, then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail. Since head direction is U, it was moving up to (3,5), so it came from (3,4) to (3,5)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)], so head is at (3,5), next segment (3,4), then (3,3), then tail (3,2). Since head direction is U, that means the head is facing up, so the next move could be U, L, or R, but not D because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Head direction U means the snake is pointing up, so it can turn left or right or continue up, but not down immediately.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,4) value 1, life_span 1: so on turn 10, if I don't eat it, it disappears. Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 10, life_span 1, it will be gone after turn 10, meaning it's only available on turn 10.\n> \n> - (6,6) value 1, life_span 4: available from turn 10 to turn 13 (since disappears after N turns, so if life_span N at turn t, it lasts until turn t + N - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t, countdown is L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears, so it is present for turns t to t + L - 1, and gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For (6,4): at turn 10, life_span 1, so it is present on turn 10, and disappears after turn 10, so not on turn 11.\n> \n> For (6,6): life_span 4 at turn 10, so present on turns 10,11,12,13; disappears after turn 13.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5): life_span 7, present turns 10 to 16.\n> \n> (3,2): life_span 10, present turns 10 to 19.\n> \n> But (3,2) is under the tail, so it can only be eaten if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 10, and then sequence for future turns, but since the state changes, I should plan a sequence but be ready to adapt. However, for the answer, I need to provide an action sequence for several turns.\n> \n> The answer format says \"Action Sequence (in order)\" for multiple turns starting from t1.\n> \n> Also, think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves for turn 10.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), direction U. Possible moves: U (up to (3,6)), L (left to (2,5)), R (right to (4,5)). Cannot go D (down to (3,4)) because reverse, and (3,4) is body, but even if not, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - U to (3,6): is this within bounds? y=6, borders y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall, since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is inside. x=3, y=6. Also, check if wall: internal obstacles, (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) – none at (3,6). Snake body: positions (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) – (3,6) not occupied. So safe.\n> \n> - L to (2,5): x=2,y=5. Borders: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 ok. Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), etc. – (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is different. (2,5) not in obstacles list. Snake body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) – not (2,5). So safe.\n> \n> - R to (4,5): x=4,y=5. Borders ok. Internal obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is above, not the same.

But from (3,5), I can't reach (6,4) in one move; it's three steps away horizontally. So impossible to eat it on turn 10. Therefore, this food will disappear after turn 10, uneaten. So I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), life_span 4, so available for a few turns.\n> \n> (1,5) at (1,5), life_span 7.\n> \n> (3,2) at (3,2), under tail, life_span 10.\n> \n> Now, for the food at (3,2), to eat it, I need the tail to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,2). When the snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves to the next position. But since food is there, it's a bit special.\n> \n> Rule: to eat food under body, body must move away first.\n> \n> So for (3,2), I need to move the snake such that at some point, the tail is no longer at (3,2), and then head moves to (3,2) to eat it.\n> \n> But when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the cell (3,2) might be free if the snake moves away.\n> \n> For example, if I move the snake up, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next, so tail moves from (3,2) to (3,3)?

The tail segment is removed, so the new tail is (3,3)? Positions after move: if head moves to (3,6), then the new snake is [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] – so tail is now at (3,3), and (3,2) is empty.\n> \n> Thus, the food at (3,2) is now exposed, since body moved away.\n> \n> Then, on a future turn, I can move the head to (3,2) to eat it.\n> \n> But (3,2) is currently the tail, and after moving, it's free.\n> \n> Now, when I eat it, since it's positive food, snake grows, so when head moves to (3,2), it eats, and tail doesn't move, so new segment added, tail stays at (3,3) or wherever.\n> \n> But I need to be careful of tail reward danger only if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail doesn't have food, the food is on an empty cell now.\n> \n> In this case, after moving away, (3,2) is empty with food, so moving head there is fine.\n> \n> But currently, head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, let's plan.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 10:\n> \n> - U to (3,6)\n> \n> - L to (2,5)\n> \n> - R to (4,5)\n> \n> If I go U to (3,6), then snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] and tail at (3,3).

So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake has 4 segments.

Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, inclusive? Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> - All x=0 or x=7 for any y\n> \n> - All y=0 or y=7 for any x\n> \n> - Plus: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3).

Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So cannot move L. Possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, check adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) — y=6, not border? y=7 is wall, so (4,6) is within bounds? Grid: y from 0 to 7, so (4,6) is valid, but is it wall? Border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall. Internal obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) is not listed, so should be free. But snake body? Snake is at (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), so (4,6) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - Down: (4,4) — but (4,4) is an internal obstacle!

Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\" Here, (3,5) is not the tail; tail is (3,3). Positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) so (3,5) is the segment right after head, so if I move left to (3,5), that's the body, which would cause collision because the body doesn't move away instantly?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life span. \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, the countdown starts at L and decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means that at the turn it spawns, countdown is N, then each turn it decreases, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or after? The phrasing is ambiguous.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think \"after N turns\" means it lasts for N turns from now. For example, if life span is 3 at turn 12, it will disappear after turn 14, meaning it is present on turns 12,13,14, and gone at turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, countdown: at turn 12, countdown=3; turn 13, countdown=2; turn 14, countdown=1; then after turn 14, it disappears, so at turn 15, countdown=0 and it's gone.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, so for N=3, after 3 turns from turn 12, it disappears at turn 15.\n> \n> But countdown decreases to 0 at turn 14?

But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) on the next turn.\n> \n> So at turn 12, from (5,5), I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (5,5):\n> \n> - Up: (5,6) – but (5,6) is an internal obstacle (wall), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (5,4) – is this free? Let's check.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So (5,4) is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Walls: border walls, and internal obstacles. (5,6) is obstacle, (5,4) is not listed, so should be free unless it's a border, but (5,4) is within bounds, y=4, x=5, not border or internal obstacle listed.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (5,4) is clear.\n> \n> - Left: (4,5) – but (4,5) is the second segment of the snake, so it's occupied by body. Moving there would cause collision, since head touches body segment, except for the tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,5), moving left to (4,5): (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,4). The segments are: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), tail (3,4). So (4,5) is a body segment, not tail. If I move left to (4,5), I collide with the body segment at (4,5), and since it's not the tail, it doesn't move away immediately, so collision occurs. Therefore, I cannot move left; it's invalid.\n> \n> - Right: (6,5) – is this free? (6,5) not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: borders and internal. (6,5) is not border (x=6<7, y=5 between 0 and7), not in internal obstacles: obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (6,3) is at y=3, not y=5. So (6,5) should be free.\n> \n> - Down: (5,4) – as above, should be free.\n> \n> Up is blocked by wall at (5,6), but (5,6) is directly above, so (5,6) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5) at turn 12: Right to (6,5) or Down to (5,4). Cannot go Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,6), which is nearby, but to eat it, I need to move to (6,6) at some point.\n> \n> (6,6) is one cell up and right from (5,5), but from (5,5), I can't go directly to (6,6) since I can only move orthogonally.\n> \n> First, let's list the available moves and consequences.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Right to (6,5) at turn 12.\n> \n> Then snake positions: after moving, head moves to (6,5), then the body follows: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to (5,5)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So after move right to (6,5):\n> \n> - New head: (6,5)\n> \n> - Then body: the old head (5,5) becomes new first body segment.\n> \n> - Then (4,5) moves to where? Positions: before move: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> After head moves to (6,5), the tail will move? When head moves, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten at (6,5), I assume, so snake grows only when eating positive food.\n> \n> Moving to (6,5): is there food? Food is at (6,6), (1,5), (3,2). (6,5) has no food, so no growth. Therefore, after moving, new positions: head at (6,5), then the body segments: (5,5) becomes the new first body segment, (4,5) becomes the second, (3,5) becomes the third, and the tail (3,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> In snake, when head moves to a new cell without eating, the tail moves to the next position, so the snake shifts.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: tail (3,4)\n> \n> After moving head right to (6,5), the new head is (6,5). Then segment 1 moves to the old head position (5,5). Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,5). Segment 3 (tail) moves to old segment 2 position (3,5). And the old tail cell (3,4) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Direction: since moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, from here, I can plan next moves.\n> \n> But I need to think about food.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (5,4) at turn 12.\n> \n> First, let's consider the options at turn 12.\n> \n> Option A: Move R to (6,5)\n> \n> Then snake: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Head at (6,5), direction R.\n> \n> Now, at (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) – but (6,6) has food, positive food. Also, is it accessible? (6,6) is within bounds, not wall? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (6,3) but (6,3) is at y=3, (6,6) is y=6, so not wall. So I can move to (6,6).\n> \n> But moving to (6,6) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> Rule: food can be eaten only if head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, check for tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (3,5), not near (6,6), so no issue.\n> \n> If I move to (6,6) at turn 13, I eat the food, grow, so new length 5.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; first, I need to decide turn 12 action.\n> \n> Option B: Move D to (5,4) at turn 12.\n> \n> Then snake positions: head to (5,4), body: (5,5) becomes new first body, (4,5) to second, (3,5) to third, tail to (3,4)?

So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning that any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid is 8x8, but the outer edges are walls, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? Let's see the snake positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). (5,4) is y=4, which should be fine if y from 1 to 6, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. So grid is 6x6 playable area? No: cells with x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, but x=0,7 and y=0,7 are out of bounds.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (6,6) are valid, I think. But let's list the walls: border cells are all with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so yes, playable cells are (x,y) with 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are walls too.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving down, so from (5,4) to (5,5) would be down? Let's see: moving down increases y? No, typically in grids, y increases up or down?\n> \n> Direction: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1)? Let me check.\n> \n> \"U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\"\n> \n> So U: y increases, which might be north or up, assuming y=0 is bottom or top? It doesn't specify, but in coordinates, (x,y) with U increasing y, so probably y=0 is bottom, y increases upwards? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, then U (y+1) would be moving up towards higher y.\n> \n> Similarly, D (y-1) moving down to lower y.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (5,4), direction D, which is down, so previous move was down, I assume, since direction is given as current head direction.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (5,4), I think. Positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so (5,4) is head, then (5,5) is the next segment, which is directly above it since y=5 to y=4 is down? From (5,5) to (5,4) is moving down, decreasing y.\n> \n> So head at (5,4), and the segment behind it is (5,5), which is above it, so the snake is moving downward, from (5,5) to (5,4).\n> \n> Direction is D, which is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,6,2,1) : position (6,6), life_span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,5,4,1) : (1,5), life_span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (3,2,7,1) : (3,2), life_span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (3,4,10,1) : (3,4), life_span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,6) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so at turn 13, life_span=2, so it will disappear after turn 14? Let's see: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,6) with life_span=2 on turn 13, it will disappear after 2 turns, meaning at the start of turn 15 it might be gone? But countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> On turn 13, life_span=2, so after this turn, it decreases to 1. After turn 14, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 13 or 14, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 16 (since turn 13:4, 14:3, 15:2, 16:1, then after turn 16, it should be 0, disappear).\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So on turn t, if life_span is L, it can be eaten on turns where the countdown is positive. After being decreased, if countdown becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life_span L. After the turn, countdown decreases to L-1. If after decrease it becomes 0, the food disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,6) at turn 13, life_span=2. On turn 13, it can be eaten. After turn 13, life_span decreases to 1. On turn 14, it can be eaten. After turn 14, life_span decreases to 0, so it disappears and not available on turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life_span=4 on turn 13: after turn 13, to 3; turn 14, to 2; turn 15, to 1; turn 16, to 0 after decrease, so disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> (3,2) life_span=7, lasts until after turn 19? Turn 13:7, 14:6, ..., up to turn 19: after turn 19, life_span decreases from 1 to 0? Let's not worry about that.\n> \n> (3,4) life_span=10, long time.\n> \n> Now, special case: food can spawn under snake body. But in this case, let's see if any food is under snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> Food at (3,4), which is (3,4). Is that under snake? (3,5) is the tail, but (3,4) is not occupied by snake; snake is at (3,5), which is above (3,4)? y=5 is above y=4? Assuming y increases up.\n> \n> Positions: head (5,4), then (5,5) which is north, then (4,5) west, then (3,5) west again. So the snake is: head at (5,4), neck at (5,5), then body at (4,5), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Food at (3,4): that's directly below the tail (3,5), since D is down, y-1.\n> \n> (3,4) is not occupied by snake; only (3,5) is snake.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,6), (1,5), (3,2), (3,4) — (3,4) is listed.\n> \n> (3,4) is a food position, and snake is at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — no one at (3,4), so it's free.\n> \n> But (3,4) is adjacent to tail (3,5), and since the snake is moving, it might be accessible.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,5), and food at (3,4) is below it. But the food is at (3,4), not on the tail. The tail is at (3,5), no food on it.\n> \n> Food can be under body, but here no food is under body; all food positions are distinct.\n> \n> (3,4) is a food, and tail is at (3,5), so if head moves to (3,4), it would eat the food, but (3,4) is not the tail cell; the tail cell is (3,5).\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if the food is on the tail cell itself. \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> So the food must be on the tail cell for this danger.\n> \n> Here, no food is on any snake cell, I think.

It's turn 14, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (1,1) to (6,6) for playable area, I think? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the valid grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). But let's confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6; y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. So playable cells are (x,y) with 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)]. These are cells that the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning (x,y-1). Since head is at (5,3) and direction is D, moving down would go to (5,2), but let's see the coordinates: y increases up or down? The movement says U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume. Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but here walls are given with y=0 and y=7, and U is (x,y+1), which might imply that y increases upwards or downwards? U is up, so (x,y+1) should be increasing y when moving up, which often means y=0 is bottom, but here walls are at y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is the bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, so moving up (U) increases y, meaning towards higher y is north or up.\n> \n> Standard: if U is (x,y+1), and y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall, then y=0 is south wall, y=7 is north wall, so increasing y is moving north.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 west wall, x=7 east wall, increasing x is east.\n> \n> But in the snake positions: head (5,3), direction D, which is down, (x,y-1), so from (5,3) down to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, snake body: (5,3) head, then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So let's plot this:\n> \n> - (5,5): body\n> \n> - (5,4): body\n> \n> - (5,3): head\n> \n> - (4,5): tail? Positions are [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], so head at (5,3), next segment (5,4), then (5,5), then tail at (4,5). So the snake is like: from (5,3) down to (5,2)? No, positions: (5,3) is head, (5,4) is above it? y=4 is higher than y=3? Since y increases up, (5,4) is north of (5,3), but head is at (5,3) and direction is D (down), so it was moving down to (5,3), I think.\n> \n> Perhaps the snake was moving down. Previous head was at (5,4) at turn 13, moved down to (5,3) on turn 14? But turn 14 is current, so positions are current.\n> \n> Current turn is 14, snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), which is above it since y=4 > y=3, so if head is at (5,3) and body at (5,4), that means the head just moved down to (5,3), so previous position was (5,4), and it moved down to (5,3).\n> \n> Then next segment (5,5), which is above (5,4), so the body goes from head (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5) to tail (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is west of (5,5), so the tail is left.\n> \n> So visually, the snake: at row y=5, columns x=5 and x=4, and head at (5,3) which is below.\n> \n> Grid: let's sketch:\n> \n> y=6: top, but walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable?

It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left to (4,2) from previous position.\n> \n> Head direction L means the snake is facing left, so it moved to (4,2) from the right, I assume. Positions are given as [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)], so the head is at (4,2), and it came from (5,2) since it was moving left to (4,2). Direction is L, so current movement direction is left.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,5), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn. Since current turn is t=16, it will disappear after turn 18? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,5) with life_span 2: at turn 16, life_span is 2, so after turn 16, it decreases to 1, and after turn 17, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 16 or 17, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life_span 4: available from turn 16 to 19 (since after 4 decreases, it goes to 0 after turn 19? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span = L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t+L or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - At turn t, life_span = L\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, life_span becomes L-2, and so on\n> \n> - When life_span reaches 0 after some turn, it disappears before that turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that at the beginning of turn t, the life_span is as given, and after the snake moves and actions are processed, the life_span decreases.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since the food can be eaten on a turn when its life_span >0, and after eating or at end of turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> The key point is that food can be eaten only if life_span >0 at the start of the turn, I think.\n> \n> Since the state is given at turn t, and we decide action for turn t.\n> \n> For (1,5) at turn 16, life_span=2, so it can be eaten on turn 16 or 17.\n> \n> After turn 17, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life_span=4, can be eaten turns 16 to 19.\n> \n> (3,4) life_span=7, turns 16 to 22.\n> \n> (1,1) life_span=10, turns 16 to 25.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (4,2), body at (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).

Since no tail removal.\n> \n> Positions: before move: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (5,2), 4: tail (5,3)\n> \n> After move to (3,4) with eat: new head (3,4), then segment 0 becomes body at (3,3), segment 1 at (3,2), segment 2 at (4,2), segment 3 at (5,2), segment 4 at (5,3), and new segment added at (5,3)? No.\n> \n> When you eat, you add a new segment at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So positions after eating: head at new position (3,4), then the previous positions: (3,3) is now body, (3,2) body, (4,2) body, (5,2) body, and tail still at (5,3), but since a new segment is added, the tail position remains, so the last segment is still at (5,3), and a new segment is added there, but it's the same cell? No.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added behind it? But since the tail doesn't move, the position stays.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: P0 = (3,3), P1 = (3,2), P2 = (4,2), P3 = (5,2), P4 = (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4) and eating: head moves to (3,4), then the body: P0 moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail is removed.\n> \n> With eating: head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but tail is not removed, so a new segment is added at the tail position, effectively the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (3,4), then body at old head position (3,3), then old P1 at (3,2), old P2 at (4,2), old P3 at (5,2), and old tail at (5,3) still, so now positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)] with (5,3) as new tail.\n> \n> Length increased by one.\n> \n> Now, after this, the head is at (3,4), and I need to move next.\n> \n> From (3,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but need to see surroundings.\n> \n> (3,4) is at y=4, x=3.\n> \n> U to (3,5): y=5, not wall, but internal obstacles? (3,5) not in obstacles, so possible.\n> \n> D to (3,3): but (3,3) is now the neck, so body, cannot go there.\n> \n> L to (2,4): (2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is in the list: internal obstacles include (2,4), so wall, cannot go there.\n> \n> R to (4,4): (4,4) is also internal obstacle! (4,4) is in list.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), etc., so (2,4) and (4,4) are obstacles.\n> \n> So from (3,4), U to (3,5) is possible, D to (3,3) is body, impossible, L to (2,4) obstacle, R to (4,4) obstacle. So only possible move is U to (3,5).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> (3,4) to U (3,5): (3,5) is free? No walls, no obstacles, not snake body at that moment.\n> \n> After eating, snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n> \n> (3,5) is not occupied, so yes.\n> \n> But (3,5) is y=5, x=3.\n> \n> Now, what about other directions? D to (3,3) is directly below, but (3,3) is the second segment, so body, collision if I go there.\n> \n> L to (2,4): x=2,y=4, which is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move.\n> \n> R to (4,4): x=4,y=4, internal obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> So indeed, only U to (3,5) is possible.\n> \n> Now, (3,5) might be safe, but then I need to go further.\n> \n> After moving to (3,5), head at (3,5), body: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] tail at (5,3)? After moving from (3,4) to (3,5) without eating, so tail moves.\n> \n> Let's sequence.\n> \n> After eating on turn 18, positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)]\n> \n> Turn 19: from (3,4), move U to (3,5) — no food at (3,5), I assume.\n> \n> Food are only at specified, so (3,5) no food.\n> \n> So move head to (3,5), then body: (3,4) stays? Head moves to (3,5), then the segment that was at (3,4) becomes body at (3,4), the one at (3,3) at (3,3), (3,2) at (3,2), (4,2) at (4,2), and (5,2) at (5,2), and tail at (5,3) is removed? Since no eat.\n> \n> Positions: new head (3,5), then old head (3,4) now body, then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and tail (5,3) removed, so new positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] with tail at (5,2)? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: P0: (3,4) head, P1: (3,3), P2: (3,2), P3: (4,2), P4: (5,2), P5: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (3,5) no eat: new head (3,5), P0 moves to (3,5), P1 moves to P0's old position (3,4), P2 to P1's old (3,3), P3 to P2's old (3,2), P4 to P3's old (4,2), and P5 to P4's old (5,2), but since no eat, tail P5 is removed? No, when moving, each segment shifts.\n> \n> After move: head at new cell (3,5), then body segments: the segment that was at P0 is now at (3,4), was at P1 is now at (3,3), was at P2 is now at (3,2), was at P3 is now at (4,2), was at P4 is now at (5,2), and the tail segment P5 is gone, so positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] — now tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Length is 6, but since no eat, it should be 6, but we added one by eating, now moving without eat, length stays 6.\n> \n> Initially after eat, length 6. Move without eat, head moves, tail removed, so length back to 5? No.\n> \n> When you eat, length increases permanently. Then when moving without eating, length stays the same, but tail moves.\n> \n> In this case: after eating on turn 18, length is 6.\n> \n> On turn 19, move to (3,5) no eat: head to (3,5), and the tail is removed, so positions: head (3,5), then the first body segment to old head position (3,4), second to old P1 (3,3), third to old P2 (3,2), fourth to old P3 (4,2), fifth to old P4 (5,2), and old tail (5,3) removed. So now 5 segments: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)] with tail at (4,2)? Let's list:\n> \n> New head: (3,5)\n> \n> Then body: position of old head: (3,4)\n> \n> Position of old P1: (3,3)\n> \n> Position of old P2: (3,2)\n> \n> Position of old P3: (4,2)\n> \n> Position of old P4: (5,2) — but old P4 was (5,2), which is now the last body segment, and old tail (5,3) is gone.\n> \n> So positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)] and tail at (4,2)? (4,2) is the last, but it was (5,2) before? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let me denote the positions before move turn 19: after turn 18 eat, positions are: segment 0: (3,4), seg1: (3,3), seg2: (3,2), seg3: (4,2), seg4: (5,2), seg5: (5,3) — 6 segments.\n> \n> Now, move head to (3,5) no eat: new segment 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> Then new segment 1: old seg0 position, (3,4)\n> \n> New segment 2: old seg1 position, (3,3)\n> \n> New segment 3: old seg2 position, (3,2)\n> \n> New segment 4: old seg3 position, (4,2)\n> \n> New segment 5: old seg4 position, (5,2)\n> \n> The old seg5 at (5,3) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] with tail at (5,2). Length 6 still? No, we had 6 segments, after move without eat, we have 6 segments but the tail moved.\n> \n> Before move: 6 segments.\n> \n> After move: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the one before, so the last body segment (seg4) moves to where seg5 was? No.\n> \n> The movement: the new head is at (3,5).\n> \n> Then the body: the segment that was at head moves to where the first body was?

Also, consider food life spans: (3,4) disappears after 6 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 24 (18 + 6 = 24, but since life span decreases each turn including current, after 6 turns from now, it vanishes. Life span 6 means it has 6 turns left including turn 18, so it disappears after turn 23? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

Similarly, (1,1) with life span 8: disappears after turn 25 (18+8=26, but countdown: 18:8, 19:7, ..., 25:1, gone after 25? I think it's better to think in terms of turns left.\n> \n> On turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.

Similarly, (1,1): life span 8, can be eaten turns 18 to 25, disappears turn 26.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,3), direction U. Possible moves: since direction is U, I can go U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move D next. So possible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Current position: head (3,3). If I go U, to (3,4). (3,4) has food with value +1, so I could eat it. But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are obstacles, and (5,6), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). So let's list all occupied cells: head (3,3), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4) and (1,1).\n> \n> If I move U to (3,4), that's the food position. Since it's positive food, eating it would increase length by one, so snake grows. Value +1.\n> \n> But is it safe? (3,4) is not a wall, and not an obstacle? Obstacles are (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3). (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free, except for the food.\n> \n> But when I move to (3,4), I need to check for collisions. If I move head to (3,4), which is food, I eat it. Then the snake body: after moving, the head is at (3,4), and the body moves: the segment at (3,2) will move to where? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (3,4), the second segment (3,2) moves to head's old position (3,3), third segment (4,2) moves to (3,2), fourth (5,2) moves to (4,2), tail (5,3) moves to (5,2). After moving, positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). Tail was (5,3), which moves to (5,2) since the fourth segment was at (5,2) and moves to where the third was? Let's index.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (3,3), index 1: (3,2), index 2: (4,2), index 3: (5,2), index 4: tail (5,3).\n> \n> After move U: head to (3,4). Then, segment 1 moves to (3,3) (old head), segment 2 moves to (3,2) (old pos of seg1), segment 3 moves to (4,2) (old pos of seg2), segment 4 moves to (5,2) (old pos of seg3). But segment 4 was tail at (5,3), and it moves to (5,2)? Old position of seg3 is (5,2), so seg4 moves to (5,2). But (5,2) was occupied by seg3, but when seg3 moves to (4,2), (5,2) is free for seg4 to move into? Yes.\n> \n> After move: new positions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2). Tail is now at (5,2), which was seg3's position.\n> \n> But (5,3) is now empty because seg4 moved away.\n> \n> Now, is there collision? Head at (3,4), which is not occupied by body, since body is at (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). (3,4) is free except for food. No wall or obstacle. So moving to (3,4) should be safe and I eat the food, increasing length to 6.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\" In this case, (3,4) is not under snake body; snake body is at y=2 and y=3, but (3,4) is above, so it's free. Snake is at (3,3), (3,2), etc., so (3,4) is adjacent and empty. So no issue.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (5,3), and head at (3,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (5,3) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart in x-direction. So no danger.\n> \n> So moving U to (3,4) seems safe and I get +1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Food at (3,4) has only 6 turns left, but I can eat it now. The other food at (1,1) has more time, life span 8.\n> \n> After eating (3,4), snake is at positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). Length 5, but I ate food, so after move, when I eat, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Important: when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place.\n> \n> Rule: when you eat positive food, length +1, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case: if I move to (3,4) and eat food, then after move, head at (3,4), and the body segments move as above, but since I eat, the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so you grow.\n> \n> So, initial positions: head (3,3), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (5,2), tail (5,3).\n> \n> Move U to (3,4): head to (3,4), then since eat food, the tail stays, so body: seg1 to (3,3) old head, seg2 to (3,2) old seg1, seg3 to (4,2) old seg2, and tail stays at (5,3)? No.\n> \n> Segments: after head moves to (3,4), the first body segment moves to the old head position (3,3), the second moves to old first position (3,2), the third moves to old second position (4,2), but the tail: since we eat, we add a new segment, so the tail position doesn't change? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when no eat, all segments move, tail moves forward. When eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but the last segment doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake has a list of positions. When moving without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is removed. With eating, head moves to new position, segments move similarly, but the tail position is not removed; instead, the new head position is added, and the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, without eating: after move, positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — tail at (5,2).\n> \n> With eating: head to (3,4), then the body: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to (3,3)? No.\n> \n> Initial positions: [ (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] head to tail.\n> \n> After move U to (3,4) and eat: new head at (3,4), then the first body segment is at old head position (3,3), second body segment at old first body position (3,2), third at old second (4,2), fourth at old third (5,2), and since we eat, we add a new segment at the old tail position (5,3), so positions become: [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] — so now length 6, with head (3,4), tail (5,3).\n> \n> In the sequence, before move, tail was (5,3), after move with eat, the new tail is (5,3) but it's a different segment? The position (5,3) is still occupied, but it's the new tail.\n> \n> In terms of grid, (5,3) was occupied, and after move with eat, it's still occupied by the new tail.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves to (3,4), it is not colliding with body because body is at (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), all different from (3,4). (3,4) is free.\n> \n> So moving U to eat (3,4) is safe and beneficial.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead. After eating, snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n> \n> Also, there's another food at (1,1) with longer life span.\n> \n> But (3,4) is closer and will disappear sooner, so it might be good to eat it now.\n> \n> But let's consider the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x left to right, y bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, (x,y), but direction U is y+1, so probably y increases up.\n> \n> So let's list cells.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So corners like (0,0), (0,7), etc. are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are at y=4, x=1,2,4. So row y=4 has obstacles at x=1,2,4, and also border, but y=4 is not border.\n> \n> Also (5,6) and (6,3).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), tail (5,3).\n> \n> So at y=3: (3,3) head, (5,3) tail part.\n> \n> y=2: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n> \n> Food: (3,4) at y=4, x=3. But y=4 has obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so (3,4) is free.\n> \n> Also food at (1,1).\n> \n> Now, if I don't eat (3,4) now, I might lose it, since it disappears in 6 turns.\n> \n> But I could go for (1,1) later.\n> \n> But (1,1) is far, at bottom-left.\n> \n> Current head at (3,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (not D).\n> \n> U: to (3,4) - food\n> \n> L: to (2,3)\n> \n> R: to (4,3)\n> \n> Now, (2,3): is it safe? Check walls: x=2,y=3, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (1,4),(2,4),(4,4),(5,6),(6,3), so (2,3) free. Body positions: snake at (3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,3), so (2,3) not occupied. So safe.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): not border, not obstacle, not occupied by body (body at (4,2), but (4,3) free? Snake has (3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,3), so (4,3) is free, no body. So safe to move to (4,3).\n> \n> But if I move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3), I don't eat food, so snake moves normally.\n> \n> If I move to (2,3), new positions: head (2,3), then seg1 to (3,3) old head, seg2 to (3,2) old seg1, seg3 to (4,2) old seg2, seg4 to (5,2) old seg3, tail to (5,3) old seg4? Seg4 was (5,2), moves to old seg3 position? Initial seg3 is (5,2)? Positions: index 0 (3,3) head, 1 (3,2), 2 (4,2), 3 (5,2), 4 (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After move L to (2,3): head to (2,3), then seg1 to old head (3,3), seg2 to old seg1 (3,2), seg3 to old seg2 (4,2), seg4 to old seg3 (5,2), and tail old seg4 (5,3) is removed, so new positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). Tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Similarly for R to (4,3): head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).\n> \n> Now, if I go U to (3,4), I eat food, grow to length 6.\n> \n> But after that, I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Since I need to plan 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with the tail if head is adjacent and tail has food, but currently tail is at (5,3), and no food there, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the obstacles. At y=4, there are obstacles at x=1,2,4, so only x=3 and x=5? x=3 is (3,4) food, x=5 is (5,4), but (5,4) might be free, but there's obstacle at (5,6) and (6,3), not at (5,4).\n> \n> y=4 obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so cells (3,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) might be free, but (7,4) is border? x=7 is border, so wall, not accessible. Similarly, x=0 wall.\n> \n> So at y=4, accessible cells: x=3 (food), x=5, x=6? But x=6,y=4, is there obstacle? Internal obstacles only at (5,6),(1,4),(2,4),(4,4),(6,3), so (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> But (6,3) is obstacle, so (6,4) might be ok.\n> \n> Also, snake after eating (3,4) would be at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3).\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction U (since I moved U).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n> \n> U to (3,5): is it free? (3,5): not border, not obstacle (obstacles at y=4, but y=5 different), so (3,5) free? Obstacles are (5,6),(1,4),(2,4),(4,4),(6,3), so (3,5) should be free. Body: after move, positions (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), so (3,5) not occupied. So safe.\n> \n> L to (2,4): but (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so I cannot move there, it's a wall. So L from (3,4) to (2,4) is invalid, collision with obstacle.\n> \n> R to (4,4): (4,4) is also an obstacle, so cannot move R.\n> \n> D to (3,3): but D is opposite to current direction U, so I cannot move D next turn if I just moved U. Rule: \"no instant reverse\", so after moving U to (3,4), direction is U, so I cannot move D to (3,3) because it's opposite.\n> \n> So from (3,4) after eating, possible moves: only U to (3,5), since L and R are obstacles, D is reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So I must move U to (3,5).\n> \n> Then at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> U to (3,6): free? (3,6) not border, not obstacle. Obstacles at (5,6), but (3,6) free. Body: after moving to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then since no eat, body moves: seg1 to (3,4), seg2 to (3,3), seg3 to (3,2), seg4 to (4,2), tail to (5,2)? After previous state with length 6: positions (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n> \n> After move U to (3,5) without eating: head to (3,5), then seg1 to (3,4) old head, seg2 to (3,3) old seg1, seg3 to (3,2) old seg2, seg4 to (4,2) old seg3, and tail (5,3) moves to old seg4 (5,2)? Seg4 is (5,2) or (5,3)? Positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,3) — tail is (5,3).\n> \n> After move: head to (3,5), then seg1 to old head (3,4), seg2 to old seg1 (3,3), seg3 to old seg2 (3,2), seg4 to old seg3 (4,2), seg5 to old seg4 (5,2), and tail old seg5 (5,3) is removed, so new positions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2).

Body has (4,2) as the third segment? Positions after move: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2). So (4,2) is occupied by seg3. If I move D to (4,2), head collides with body at (4,2), so death.\n> \n> R to (5,3): (5,3) is not occupied now? After move, positions are (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), so (5,3) is free? Tail was at (5,3) initially, but after move to (4,3), tail moved to (5,2), so (5,3) is empty. But (5,3) is not obstacle, not wall. Obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (5,3) is free.

Only L or R, but L to (0,7) wall, R to (2,7), which is border but accessible? x=2,y=7, x from 0 to 7, so (2,7) is top row, not wall if not obstacle, but it's border, but border cells are walls, so I think (2,7) is wall because y=7 is border.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall.

The state doesn't say that the food has been eaten; it's listed as present.\n> \n> I think I need to interpret that the food at (2,3) is under the head, and it can only be eaten if the head moves away and then back, but that seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps for the head, if food is there at the start, it could be considered eaten, but the state lists it, so probably not.\n> \n> Let me look back at the rules: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" – implies that the head wasn't on it before moving onto it.\n> \n> So if the head is already on it, moving away doesn't eat it; only when moving onto it.\n> \n> Therefore, for food under the head, since the head is on it, it hasn't been eaten yet; it can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the head leaves and then returns to that cell later, after the body has moved away, but since the body includes that cell, it might be complicated.\n> \n> The snake is moving, so after moving, the tail might leave that cell.\n> \n> Let's think.\n> \n> At turn 19, snake positions: head (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (2,3) is occupied by head.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) is present.\n> \n> When the snake moves, say to a new position, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell (2,3) might be vacated if the tail was there, but here the tail is at (5,2), so after moving, the cell (2,3) is vacated because the snake moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; if no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> But here, the food is under the head before moving.\n> \n> I think there's a confusion.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn 19, the snake head is at (2,3) with food present. When I choose a direction to move, the head moves to an adjacent cell. If that new cell has food, it eats it and grows. But the current cell (2,3) has food, but I'm moving away from it, so I don't eat it by moving away.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,3), I need to have the head stay or something, but I can't stay; I have to move to an adjacent cell.\n> \n> Since I'm moving to a new cell, and (2,3) is no longer occupied by head after move, so the food is still there, uncovered. Then, in a future turn, if I move back to (2,3), and at that time it's not occupied by body, I can eat it.\n> \n> But at that time, the body might be elsewhere.\n> \n> In this case, since (2,3) is the head position, after I move the head away, (2,3) is vacated, and the food is still there with decreased life span. Then later, I can move back to eat it.\n> \n> But that might not be efficient, and there might be risks.\n> \n> For now, I should consider the food at (2,3) as available to be eaten later if I return.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Also, there's a \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the new head position is where the tail was, but since the tail was there, it becomes body, and head collides with it.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (5,2), and head is at (2,3), which is not adjacent; let's see distances.\n> \n> Head (2,3), tail (5,2): Δx=3, Δy=1, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,3) and (3,3) are adjacent, but (3,3) is body, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is (5,2), which is far.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 19 and a few turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6, I think? No, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for any y; all y=0, y=7 for any x.\n> \n> - Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (2,3) head, (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) tail.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so last move was left, from (3,3) to (2,3), I assume.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn, because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,3): up, down, left. Right is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (2,4) - but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (2,2) - is this within bounds? x=2, y=2, should be playable if not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> y=2, not border, and not in internal obstacles list: internal are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Left: (1,3) - x=1, y=3, not border (borders are x=0,7 y=0,7), and not in internal obstacles, so free.\n> \n> - Right: (3,3) - but (3,3) is the body segment, and moving right would go to (3,3), which is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> (3,3) is the first body segment, so if I move right, head to (3,3), which is occupied, so collision with body.\n> \n> Also, right is opposite to current direction left, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: down to (2,2) or left to (1,3).\n> \n> Up to (2,4) is obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 5, so disappears after turn 19 + 5 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 19, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 23? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it will not be there on turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, if N=5 at turn t, it is present at turn t, t+1, t+2, t+3, t+4, and disappears before turn t+5. So last chance to eat is turn t + (N-1).\n> \n> Standard: if life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t with life span L, it has L turns left, including turn t.\n> \n> So it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For food at (3,4): turn 19, life span 5, so present on turns 19,20,21,22,23. Gone at turn 24.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): life span 7, present turns 19 to 25 (19+6=25, gone at 26).\n> \n> (2,3): life span 10, present turns 19 to 28.\n> \n> But (2,3) is currently under head, not eatable now.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, from (2,3), I can move left to (1,3) or down to (2,2).\n> \n> If I move left to (1,3): (1,3) is free? Let's check: x=1,y=3, not border, not internal obstacle (internal are (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3); (1,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Then snake moves: head to (1,3), body follows: (2,3) becomes body, then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). But (2,3) had food, but since head moved away, the food is still there, uncovered. No eating because not moving onto food.\n> \n> (1,3) has no food, I assume, since not listed.\n> \n> Foods are only at (3,4), (1,1), (2,3).\n> \n> So after move to (1,3), no eat, snake length same, tail moves to (3,2)? Positions: head (1,3), then body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2); tail at (4,2) now? Original positions: [(2,3)H, (3,3)B1, (3,2)B2, (4,2)B3, (5,2)T]\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3): new head (1,3), then body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2). Tail was (5,2), but since no food eaten, tail moves off (5,2), so positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)] and (5,2) free now. Tail is now (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, if move down to (2,2): head to (2,2), no food there, so body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2); tail moves off (5,2), so snake: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, I should consider the food at (2,3). Since head moved away, (2,3) is now occupied by body segment, not head. Specifically, if I move left to (1,3), (2,3) becomes the first body segment. Then, to eat the food at (2,3), I need to move the body away and then head back.\n> \n> But moving body away means the snake moves so that (2,3) is vacated. Since it's a body segment, when the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position, so if I move in such a way that the tail end passes (2,3), it will be vacated.\n> \n> Currently, after moving left, snake: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> (2,3) is body, and food is there. When the snake moves next, the segment at (2,3) will move to where the head was or depending on direction.\n> \n> To vacate (2,3), I need the snake to move so that the tail moves away from it, but (2,3) is not the tail; tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> The cell (2,3) will be vacated when the snake moves and the segment that was there moves to a new position, but since it's not the tail, it moves to follow, so the cell is left empty only if no new growth.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, each move, the tail moves, so cells are vacated from the tail end.\n> \n> In this case, (2,3) is a body segment, so it will be occupied until that part of the body moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving to (1,3), (2,3) is occupied. Next move, if I move, say, down from (1,3) to (1,2), then body moves: (1,3) to where head was? Head moves to (1,2), then body: first body segment moves to previous head position (1,3), but previous head was (1,3), now head to (1,2), so body segments: (2,3) moves to (1,3), (3,3) moves to (2,3), (3,2) moves to (3,3)? Let's think positions.\n> \n> Before move: positions: index 0: head (1,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> Head moves to (1,2). Since no food, tail moves off, so new positions: head (1,2), then body segments: the first body segment moves to previous head position (1,3), so segment 1 now at (1,3). Then segment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (2,3), so (2,3). Segment 3 moves to previous of segment 2, (3,3), so (3,3). Segment 4 moves to previous of segment 3, (3,2), so (3,2). And tail was (4,2), which is vacated.\n> \n> So now snake: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2)]\n> \n> (2,3) is still occupied, by the third segment.\n> \n> To vacate (2,3), I need to keep moving until that body segment moves away and no new segment is added there, which will happen when the tail passes that point.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the cell (2,3) will be vacated when the segment that was there has moved and the tail has moved beyond, but it's a process.\n> \n> The cell (2,3) is currently occupied by a body segment. It will be free when that segment moves to a different cell and no other segment or head is on it. Since the snake moves step by step, (2,3) will be free after the segment that was on it moves away, which happens on the next move if that segment is not the tail.\n> \n> In this case, from above, after first move to (1,3), (2,3) is occupied by body.\n> \n> After second move to (1,2), (2,3) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n> \n> From above, after moving to (1,2), positions include (2,3).\n> \n> Then, if I move again, say, left to (0,2), but x=0 is wall, not possible. Or down to (1,1), etc.\n> \n> Eventually, after several moves, when the tail moves past, (2,3) will be vacated.\n> \n> But it might take time, and the food has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Similarly for other foods.\n> \n> For now, I should consider the immediate choices.\n> \n> From (2,3), I can go left to (1,3) or down to (2,2).\n> \n> If I go down to (2,2), then snake: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> Then from (2,2), possible moves: up to (2,3) but (2,3) is now body, so collision; left to (1,2); down to (2,1); right to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision.\n> \n> (3,2) is body, so moving right to (3,2) would collide.\n> \n> Also, current direction: after moving down from (2,3) to (2,2), head direction is D, so cannot move up next turn.\n> \n> Possible from (2,2): left to (1,2), down to (2,1), or right to (3,2) but occupied, not possible. So only left or down.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go left to (1,3) first, then from (1,3), possible moves: up to (1,4), but (1,4) is internal obstacle, wall; down to (1,2); left to (0,3) but x=0 wall; right to (2,3) but (2,3) is body now, occupied. So only down to (1,2).\n> \n> From (1,3), only down to (1,2) is possible, since up is wall, left wall, right is body.\n> \n> After moving to (1,3), body at (2,3), so (2,3) occupied, so cannot move right.\n> \n> So from (1,3), only down to (1,2).\n> \n> Then from (1,2), I can move to other places.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the foods.\n> \n> Food at (3,4): I might want to eat it, but it's at (3,4), which is near but has obstacles.\n> \n> Also, (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly up from (2,3) to (2,4).\n> \n> From (3,4), it is accessible.\n> \n> Current head at (2,3), (3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent?

According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Here, (2,3) is the head, so if the head is on it, it might be a special case.\n> \n> The food at (2,3) has life span 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so it has 10 turns left starting from turn 19.\n> \n> But since the snake head is currently on (2,3), and there's food there, can it eat it immediately? The rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2.

No, the head is separate. The positions are given as [(x0,y0) head, (x1,y1) body, etc.].\n> \n> So for food under the body, not under the head. If food is under the head, it should be eatable immediately, I think.

So (2,3) is occupied by head.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) is present.\n> \n> When the snake moves, say to a new position, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell (2,3) might be vacated if the tail was there, but here the tail is at (5,2), so after moving, the cell (2,3) is vacated because the snake moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; if no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> But here, the food is under the head before moving.\n> \n> I think there's a confusion.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn 19, the snake head is at (2,3) with food present. When I choose a direction to move, the head moves to an adjacent cell. If that new cell has food, it eats it and grows. But the current cell (2,3) has food, but I'm moving away from it, so I don't eat it by moving away.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,3), I need to have the head stay or something, but I can't stay; I have to move to an adjacent cell.\n> \n> Since I'm moving to a new cell, and (2,3) is no longer occupied by head after move, so the food is still there, uncovered. Then, in a future turn, if I move back to (2,3), and at that time it's not occupied by body, I can eat it.\n> \n> But at that time, the body might be elsewhere.\n> \n> In this case, since (2,3) is the head position, after I move the head away, (2,3) is vacated, and the food is still there with decreased life span.

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 21, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 23? Let's clarify: life span decreases every turn, including the current turn when it's spawned. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it means it has N turns left including this one. After this turn, it has N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So for food at (3,4) with life span 3 on turn 21, it will disappear after turn 23 (since turn 21: life=3, turn 22: life=2, turn 23: life=1? No: at turn t, life span is the number of turns it will last, including t. After turn t, it decreases to life span -1 for the next turn.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it means it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N. But the countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> For simplicity: on turn 21, food has life span 3, so after this turn, on turn 22, it will have life span 2, and on turn 23, life span 1, and then it disappears on turn 24? I think I need to read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

For example, at turn t, life span N means after this turn, it will be there for N-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so if at turn t, life span is N, then at turn t, it decreases to N-1 for the next state? But it's a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: at the start of turn t, the food has a certain life span. After the turn, the life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – including current turn, meaning that during the current turn, it decreases.\n> \n> I think for planning, I should consider the life span as the number of turns it will still be available, including the current one.\n> \n> For food at (3,4): position (3,4), value 1, life span 3 on turn 21. So it will be available on turn 21, 22, 23, and disappear on turn 24.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) with value 1, life span 5: available until turn 25? Turn 21 + 5 - 1 = turn 25? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 21: life span 3 for (3,4) – after turn 21, it decreases to 2, so on turn 22 it has life span 2, then turn 23 life span 1, turn 24 life span 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 21, 22, 23.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 5: on turn 21, life span 5, so decreases each turn, can be eaten on turns 21 to 25.\n> \n> (2,3) with value 1, life span 8: available turns 21 to 28.\n> \n> But (2,3) is a food position, and snake positions include (2,3) as a body segment.

But according to the rule, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, food at (2,3) is under the body segment at (2,3). So to eat it, the snake must move such that the body segment leaves (2,3), and then later the head moves to (2,3).\n> \n> But currently, the head is at (1,2), moving left.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), I think. Snake positions: (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2).

So available turns 22 to 28 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): L=10, available turns 22 to 31 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, values: all have value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> (2,3) is listed as (2,3,7,1), but (2,3) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (2,3), which is the fourth segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2)]\n> \n> So (2,3) is a body segment. And there is food at (2,3)? That can't be right because food and snake can't occupy same cell unless the snake moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> So here, food at (2,3) is under the snake's body. Specifically, it's the fourth segment.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,3), and then head moves to (2,3). But since the snake moves, when the body moves away, the tail might move, but in this case, (2,3) is not the tail; tail is (3,2).\n> \n> Also, for (2,3) food, life span 7, so it has time.\n> \n> Now, other food: (3,4) and (5,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is above (3,3), which is a body segment? (3,3) is the fifth segment, and (3,4) is directly above it if y increases up.\n> \n> Coordinates: let's define the grid.\n> \n> Assume x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (1,1) bottom-left or top-left? Not specified, but since U is (x,y+1), y+1 is up, so probably (1,1) is bottom-left, y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n> \n> In standard, if y increases up, (1,1) is bottom-left.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head at (1,1), with direction D, to (1,2), which is up if y increases up? (1,1) to (1,2): y from 1 to 2, increase, so U is up, D is down.\n> \n> From (1,2) to (1,1) is down, so (1,1) is below (1,2), so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells x=1-6, y=1-6 are playable except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So blocked cells: all border cells (x or y 0 or 7), and (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 except those.\n> \n> Now snake: positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2)\n> \n> So head at (1,1), tail at (3,2)\n> \n> Current direction: D (down), so last move was down to (1,1).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (1,1), can go U, D, L, R, but D is down, to (1,0), but y=0 is wall, so D not possible.\n> \n> U: (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied by the second segment, so body collision if move there.\n> \n> L: (0,1), x=0 wall.\n> \n> R: (2,1), which is empty?

Snake positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) — no (2,1), so yes, only R is possible? But that can't be, let's list neighbors.\n> \n> Head at (1,1):\n> \n> - Up: (1,2) — occupied by body\n> \n> - Down: (1,0) — wall\n> \n> - Left: (0,1) — wall\n> \n> - Right: (2,1) — free, I think.\n> \n> But (2,1) is not listed as obstacle, and not snake, so it should be free.\n> \n> But is (2,1) within playable area? x=2 between 1-6, y=1, which is bottom, but y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to 6.\n> \n> So yes, only move to (2,1) is possible, via R.\n> \n> But current direction is D, and moving R is not opposite, so it's allowed. Opposite of D is U, but U is not possible anyway.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so cannot move U, but U is not possible anyway.\n> \n> So only R is possible for turn 22.\n> \n> But I need to plan 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,4,2,1), (2,3,7,1), (5,4,10,1)\n> \n> (2,3) is currently occupied by snake body, so cannot eat now.\n> \n> (3,4) is at (3,4), which is above (3,3), and life span 2, so available only for turns 22 and 23.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> Since only one move possible now, I must go R to (2,1) on turn 22.\n> \n> Then, new head position: (2,1)\n> \n> Snake positions become: head at (2,1), then the previous head (1,1) becomes part of body, so body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), and tail (3,2) will move? When snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food at (2,1), I assume, so after moving to (2,1), the head is at (2,1), and the tail moves forward, so the last segment (3,2) is removed, so new positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] and (3,2) is gone, so tail is now (3,3)? Positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3).

Also, opposite direction, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - R: (3,1) — is this free? (3,1) not in snake positions, not obstacle, not wall. Snake has (3,3) but not (3,1). Obstacles are at (1,4), (2,4), etc., no (3,1). So (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (3,1).\n> \n> Then turn 23: move R to (3,1).\n> \n> New positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and tail (3,3) moves away? After moving to (3,1), no food, so tail moves: remove (3,3), so positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Direction now R.\n> \n> Turn 24.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.

Turn 22: L=2, after turn 22: L=1, so on turn 23 available. After turn 23: L=0, disappears, not available turn 24.\n> \n> So (3,4) available only on turns 22 and 23. Turn 22 we didn't eat it, turn 23 head is at (3,1), far from (3,4), so cannot eat it on turn 23. Thus, (3,4) will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> (2,3) food is at (2,3), which is currently occupied by snake body. On turn 22, (2,3) is occupied, so not eatable.

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 23 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 4), (2, 4), (6, 3)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (3, 4, 1, 1)\n\t- (2, 3, 6, 1)\n\t- (5, 4, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 23 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 23, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), and the body segments are (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 6 segments: head at (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and tail at (3,3). The head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (2,1) from the previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and it was moving right, the previous head was at (1,1), I think. Let's see the sequence: positions are [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]. So from (2,1) to (1,1) is left, but head direction is R, which is confusing.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction the head is facing now, so since it's at (2,1) and direction is R, that means it moved right to get to (2,1). But the second position is (1,1), which is left of (2,1), so that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the positions are listed in order from head to tail, so head is (2,1), then the next segment is (1,1), which means the head moved from (1,1) to (2,1) by going right. Yes, that makes sense. So at turn 22, head was at (1,1), and it moved right to (2,1) for turn 23. Now for turn 23, I need to decide the action.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, since it says value1, but in the description, positive food is +1, and there's no negative food mentioned here, so all are positive.\n> \n> Life span: (3,4) has life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 1, after this turn it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly, (2,3) has 6, so it will last 6 more turns, and (5,4) has 9, so 9 more turns.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. I have to avoid collisions and maximize score.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: border cells, so cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> So obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,1), body at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), tail at (3,3). So the snake occupies: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3).\n> \n> (2,3) is a body segment, but there's also food at (2,3) with value 1 and life span 6. Food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (2,3) has food, but it's under a body segment, so to eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves (2,3), and then head comes back.\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied by the snake, so I can't move there now.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) is free, and (5,4) is free.\n> \n> Life span of (3,4) is 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. Since it's turn 23, and life span 1, after this turn, it will be gone. So I need to eat it now or never.\n> \n> But can I eat it? Head is at (2,1), and (3,4) is at (3,4), which is not adjacent. Adjacent cells: from (2,1), I can move up to (2,2), down to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, left to (1,1) but (1,1) is body, so collision, right to (3,1).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): (2,2) – but (2,2) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision with body. Head touches body, so deadly.\n> \n> - Down (D): (2,0) – y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision with wall.\n> \n> - Left (L): (1,1) – occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> - Right (R): (3,1) – is this free? Let's see: snake positions are (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). (3,1) is not in snake positions, and not a wall, and not an obstacle. Internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), so (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is not a border wall, and not in internal obstacles list, so yes, free.\n> \n> Also, food is at (3,4), (2,3), (5,4), none at (3,1), so it's empty.\n> \n> So from (2,1), the only safe move is right to (3,1). Other moves are all deadly: up to body, down to wall, left to body.\n> \n> But head direction is R, so moving right is allowed, and since I'm moving right, for next turn, I can't move left, but that's for the next action.\n> \n> For turn 23, I must move right to (3,1) to avoid death.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> Confirm: positions after move.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,1), new head position (3,1). Then the body: the tail was at (3,3), but when head moves, the tail moves? In snake, when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward, so the segment that was at (3,3) might move or stay, depending.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all body segments follow, so the last segment (tail) is removed from its position, and the new head is added.\n> \n> So current snake: positions [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] head at (2,1), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> If I move right to (3,1), new head is (3,1), then the body becomes: the first body segment is now (2,1), which was head, then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and the tail (3,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head, and the tail end is cut off, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,1), new positions: head (3,1), then the previous head (2,1) becomes neck, so body: (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and the last segment (3,3) is no longer part of snake, so tail is now (2,3)? Let's index.\n> \n> Current positions index 0 to 5: idx0: (2,1) head, idx1: (1,1), idx2: (1,2), idx3: (2,2), idx4: (2,3), idx5: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> After move right to (3,1), new head is (3,1), so new positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] and (3,3) is removed, so tail is now (2,3).\n> \n> (2,3) is now the tail, and it had food under it, but since the snake moved, (2,3) is no longer occupied? After move, (2,3) is still occupied by the snake, as it's part of the body, now the tail.\n> \n> In the new positions, (2,3) is the last segment, tail.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,3), which is under the tail now. To eat it, I need to move the tail away and then head to it.\n> \n> Back to the move: for turn 23, I have only one safe move: right to (3,1).\n> \n> Because other moves: up to (2,2) is body, collision; down to (2,0) is wall; left to (1,1) is body.\n> \n> So I must move right to (3,1).\n> \n> Then, after that, head is at (3,1), and direction is now R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4) has life span 1, and after this turn, it disappears, so I can't eat it because it's not adjacent; it's at (3,4), I'm at (3,1), which is 3 cells away, so I can't reach it in one turn, so it will be gone. So I lose that food.\n> \n> Now, for turn 24, head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (3,1)\n> \n> - Up (U): (3,2) – is this free? Snake positions after move: [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] so (3,2) not occupied. Walls: y=0 to y=7, x=0 to x=7 borders, (3,2) is within, not a wall. Obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3), not (3,2). So (3,2) should be free. No food there.\n> \n> - Down (D): (3,0) – y=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L): (2,1) – but (2,1) is now a body segment (neck), so moving left to (2,1) would be collision with body. Also, since current direction is R, moving left would be opposite, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\", meaning if I moved right to get here, I can't move left immediately next turn. But for turn 24, I just moved right to (3,1), so moving left to (2,1) is reverse, and it's also occupied, so definitely invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): (4,1) – is this free? (4,1) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles: (4,4) is at (4,4), not (4,1). So (4,1) free.\n> \n> So possible moves: up to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n> \n> I need to think about food and long-term.\n> \n> Food available: (2,3) with life span 6, under the tail now at (2,3). After turn 23 move, tail is at (2,3), and food is there. To eat it, I need the tail to move away, and then head to (2,3).\n> \n> Also, food at (5,4) with life span 9.\n> \n> (3,4) is gone after this turn.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 23, (3,4) life span 1, after turn, it becomes 0, disappears.\n> \n> (2,3) life span 6, after turn 23, it becomes 5? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> The state says \"Current Turn: 23\" and food has life span, e.g., (3,4,1,1) meaning position (3,4), value 1, life span 1.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 23, life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 23, so if not eaten on turn 23, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,3), life span 6, it will disappear after 6 more turns, so after turn 28 (23+5? Let's see: after turn 23, life span decreases to 5, then after turn 24 to 4, etc., disappears when life span reaches 0 after the turn it is decreased.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, after the turn, it decreases by 1, so at start of turn t, life span L, if not eaten during t, after t, life span L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains, else disappears.\n> \n> For (3,4): at turn 23, life span 1, if not eaten on turn 23, after turn 23, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> For (2,3): life span 6 at turn 23, if not eaten on turn 23, after turn 23, life span 5, and so on.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,4): life span 9 at turn 23.\n> \n> Now, after turn 23 move to (3,1), head at (3,1), snake: [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] tail at (2,3) with food.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) can be eaten only if the tail moves away and head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,3), so if I move the snake such that tail leaves (2,3), and then later head comes to (2,3), I can eat it.\n> \n> But I need to do that before life span 0.\n> \n> Now for turn 24, head at (3,1), I can move up to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns ahead to maximize score.\n> \n> Also, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> List all occupied cells: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Border walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake after turn 23: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> So free cells: all others.\n> \n> Food: (2,3) occupied but with food, (5,4) free.\n> \n> (2,3) has food but is occupied, so not accessible now.\n> \n> I should aim to eat the food at (5,4) or free up (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,3) life span 6, so I have 6 turns to eat it, including turn 23?

(3,2) to (2,3) is not horizontal or vertical adjacent; it's diagonal, so not adjacent. Moves are only U, D, L, R, so from (3,2), I can go to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2). (2,3) is at row 2 col 3, (3,2) is row 3 col 2, so different row and column, not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not 1, so not adjacent.

These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (3,1) from (2,1)? Let's see the positions: the list is head first, so from head to tail: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake is moving right to (3,1), and before that, it was at (2,1), which is left of (3,1), so yes, direction R means it came from left, moving right.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 6 and value 1. Value 1 means positive food, since it says value1, and from the core rules, positive food has value +1.\n> \n> The format is (x, y, life_span, value).

And food is at (2,3), so yes, there is food under the tail.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can be under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Specifically, for this case, since it's under the tail, we need to be careful because of the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n> \n> The rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to the tail position to eat the food, but since the tail is there, after eating, the tail doesn't move away immediately? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake eats food, it grows, so after eating, the tail stays in place or something? No.\n> \n> Standard Snake mechanics: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward one cell, unless it eats food, in which case the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, the snake grows, so the new tail is added at the position where it was eaten, but since the tail was there, it might cause collision.\n> \n> The rule explains: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, if the head is next to the tail, and the tail has food, if you move the head to the tail position to eat the food, after eating, the head is now on that cell, and since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still that cell? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's clarify with positions.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at position T, and head is adjacent to T, say at H.\n> \n> If head moves to T to eat the food there.\n> \n> After movement:\n> \n> - Head moves to T.\n> \n> - Since it ate food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move. The new tail is the old tail position?

The list would be [Pn, P0, P1, ..., Pn] which has duplicate Pn, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the issue. The head is now at Pn, and the segment that was at Pn is still there in the body, so the head collides with the body segment at Pn, which is itself or another segment? In the list, Pn is included twice: once as head and once as a body segment.\n> \n> Specifically, after growth, the body is [C, P0, P1, ..., Pn] where C = Pn, so positions: [Pn, P0, P1, ..., Pn]. Since Pn is repeated, the head is at Pn and there is another segment at Pn, so immediate collision.\n> \n> Hence, the snake dies because of self-collision.\n> \n> That's why the rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" The \"newly grown tail\" might be misphrased; it's that the old tail position is still occupied by a body segment when the head is there.\n> \n> In this case, for the food at (2,3), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> The head is at (3,1), tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Is the head adjacent to the tail? Let's see positions: head (3,1), tail (2,3).\n> \n> Distance: |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (3,1) and (2,3): x differs by 1, y differs by 2, so not adjacent; they are diagonal or something, but not sharing an edge. Specifically, (3,1) can move to (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), (3,0) but (3,0) is wall? Walls are y=0, so (3,0) is wall.\n> \n> But (2,3) is not adjacent to (3,1). Adjacent cells would be (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), (3,0) but (3,0) is invalid.\n> \n> (2,3) is at (2,3), which is not directly adjacent to (3,1). So head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Therefore, the tail reward danger does not apply here because head is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> We can eat the food at (2,3) if we move the head there after the tail moves away.\n> \n> But currently, the food is under the tail, so we need to move the tail away first.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (3,1), direction R, so it can move to (4,1), (3,2), or (3,0) but (3,0) is wall, so not possible. Also, cannot move left to (2,1) because that's the body, and it would cause collision.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) - is this free? Let's see what's at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). So (3,2) is not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (3,2) is not a wall.\n> \n> So (3,2) is empty? Or is there food? Food is at (2,3) and (5,4), so (3,2) has no food mentioned, so probably empty.\n> \n> Similarly, right: (4,1) - let's check: not in snake positions, not wall. Snake: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), etc., (4,1) not there. Walls: x=0 and x=7 borders, internal obstacles not at (4,1), so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> Down: (3,0) is y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> Left: (2,1) is occupied by the body, specifically the second segment, so moving left would collide with body, death.\n> \n> So possible moves: Up to (3,2) or Right to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, direction is R, so if I move Up or Right, that's fine; moving Left would be opposite, but Left is invalid anyway. Cannot move opposite, but since Left is invalid, no issue.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). But left to (2,1) is invalid because body is there, so even if I wanted, I can't, but the rule says \"cannot move opposite\", so I must avoid that, but here it's impossible anyway.\n> \n> So actions: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score.\n> \n> Food: (2,3) with life span 6, value +1. Current turn 24, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 24 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 24, life span is 6, meaning it will be there for 6 turns: turns 24,25,26,27,28,29; on turn 30 it disappears? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t+L it is gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn 24, life span 6, so it decreases to 5 on turn 25, to 4 on 26, ..., to 1 on 28, to 0 on 29, and disappears at the start of turn 30? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for movement and eating, the food is there when the head moves to it during the turn.\n> \n> The state is given at turn t, with food positions, so at turn t, the food is present with life span L.\n> \n> After the turn, when we move, life span decreases.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to a food cell during the turn, it eats it.\n> \n> For disappearance, after N turns, meaning after N decreases.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including the current one? Since countdown includes current turn.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So the food is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1? Let's see:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span L: present\n> \n> - After turn t, life span L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + L - 1, life span 1: present on turn t + L - 1\n> \n> - After that turn, life span 0, disappears before turn t + L.\n> \n> So the last turn it can be eaten is turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For food at (2,3): turn 24, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turns 24,25,26,27,28,29. Disappears before turn 30.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,4): life span 8, so available turns 24 to 31.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the food at (2,3) is under the tail. To eat it, we need to move the tail away and then move head to (2,3).\n> \n> Currently tail is at (2,3). When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves away.\n> \n> For example, if we move in a way that the snake moves forward without eating, the tail will leave (2,3), and then (2,3) becomes free, and we can move head to it to eat the food.\n> \n> But the food is there until turn 29, so we have time.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (5,4) is also positive.\n> \n> But let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> - **Snake Positions**: Head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (5,3).\n> \n> - **Food**: There are four food items:\n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 28, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 29? Let me confirm the life span mechanic.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

So at turn t, if life span is N, after one turn (turn t+1), life span becomes N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So for food with life span L at turn t:\n> - It exists on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n> - Disappears at the start of turn t+L or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is L. After turn t is processed, life span decreases by 1, so at turn t+1, life span is L-1. When life span becomes 0, it disappears, so it can be eaten until the turn when life span is 1, and after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 2 at turn 28:\n> - Turn 28: life span 2, can be eaten.\n> - After turn 28, life span decreases to 1 (for turn 29).\n> - Turn 29: life span 1, can be eaten.\n> - After turn 29, life span decreases to 0, so it disappears, not present on turn 30.\n> \n> Similarly, for life span 4 at turn 28:\n> - Turn 28: 4\n> - Turn 29: 3\n> - Turn 30: 2\n> - Turn 31: 1\n> - Turn 32: disappears, not present.\n> \n> So for (2,3): life span 2 at t=28, can be eaten on t=28 or 29.\n> (5,4): life span 4, can be eaten t=28 to 31.\n> (2,5): life span 7, t=28 to 34.\n> (1,3): life span 10, t=28 to 37.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction Up. So from the positions, it came from (5,2) to (5,3), so previous move was Up. Current direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move Down on this turn. Allowed moves: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Possible actions from (5,3):\n> - Up (U) to (5,4)\n> - Left (L) to (4,3)\n> - Right (R) to (6,3)\n> \n> But (6,3) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (6,3) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (5,4) is within bounds, y=4 <7.\n> \n> So from (5,3), possible moves:\n> - U to (5,4): is there food? Food at (5,4) is present.\n> - L to (4,3): is this free? Let's see if it's occupied by snake or wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So (4,3) is not occupied by snake. Walls: no wall at (4,3), walls are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (4,4) is a wall? (4,4) is listed, so (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (6,3) is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U to (5,4) or L to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (5,4), I eat the food there, since food is present. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,1). Head is at (5,3), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. Distance: (5,3) to (2,1) is not adjacent; for example, (5,3) to (4,3) is left, (5,4) up, etc., but tail is (2,1), which is far.\n> \n> Current tail is (2,1), and it's not under food, I think. Food positions are (2,3), (5,4), (2,5), (1,3). (2,1) has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> If I eat food, snake grows, so new segment added at head.\n> \n> Now, let's plan ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to think about the food life spans.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) has short life, only until turn 29. So I might want to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But (2,3) is at (2,3), snake head at (5,3), same y, different x.\n> \n> Also, (1,3) has long life, (2,5) also.\n> \n> But obstacles: let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, borders walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (6,3) is wall, which we saw.\n> \n> (4,4) wall, (2,4) wall, (1,4) wall, (5,6) wall.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So the snake is in the bottom area.\n> \n> Food: (2,3), (5,4), (2,5), (1,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is above the tail or something? Tail is (2,1), so (2,3) might be accessible.\n> \n> But to reach (2,3), I need to go left.\n> \n> From (5,3), I can go L to (4,3), then I can go U to (4,4) but (4,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction if I go L to (4,3), then direction is L, so I can go U, D, L, not R (reverse).\n> \n> (4,3) to U: (4,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> D: to (4,2), but (4,2) is snake body? Snake positions: (4,2) is a body segment. But when I move, the snake moves, so if I move to (4,3), the head is at (4,3), then the body follows: tail moves away from (2,1), so (4,2) will be free when the snake moves, except for the new head position.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current position, so all body segments shift.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,3) from (5,3), then new positions: head (4,3), then (5,3) becomes new body, but (5,3) was head, now body, then (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), and tail (2,1) moves away, so (2,1) is no longer occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat food, a new segment is added at head, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,3), no food there, so snake length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Now, back to from (4,3): after moving to (4,3), the body is at (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). Tail was (2,1), moved away, so (2,1) free.\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,4): but (4,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> - D to (4,2): (4,2) is now part of the body? After moving to (4,3), the positions are: head (4,3), body segments: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). So (4,2) is occupied by body, cannot move there.\n> \n> - L to (3,3): (3,3) is not occupied, not wall. Walls: internal obstacles, (3,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - R to (5,3): but (5,3) is now the first body segment, so moving to (5,3) would be body collision. Also, R is right, but current direction is L (since I moved left to here), so moving right would be reverse, not allowed. After moving to (4,3), head direction is L, so I cannot move R (opposite) to (5,3).\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves: only L to (3,3) or D to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied, so only L to (3,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Moves: U: wall, D: body, R: body and reverse, so only L to (3,3).\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or other directions.\n> \n> (2,3) has food.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; I need to decide the first move.\n> \n> Another option: move U to (5,4) directly from (5,3).\n> \n> (5,4) has food, so I eat it, snake grows to 7 segments.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head at (5,4), then new body at (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail doesn't move since grew.\n> \n> Now, from (5,4), head direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> But (5,4) is not wall? (5,4) is a food position, but after eating, it's occupied by head.\n> \n> Walls: (4,4) is wall, (2,4) wall, etc., but (5,4) is not listed as wall, so it's free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,4) not listed, so ok.\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction U, so cannot move D (down) to (5,3), because reverse.\n> \n> Also, (5,3) is now body, so moving to (5,3) would collide.\n> \n> U to (5,5): is it free? No snake or wall? Walls: y=7 is border, (5,5) within bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,6) is wall, but (5,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> L to (4,4): (4,4) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> R to (6,4): (6,4) not listed as wall, but internal obstacles have (6,3), not (6,4), so should be free? But (6,3) is wall, (6,4) might be free.\n> \n> x=6,y=4, not in obstacle list, and borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,4) is not wall.\n> \n> But I need to check if occupied.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So (6,4) not occupied.\n> \n> Now, from (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> - U to (5,5): free\n> - D to (5,3): but (5,3) is body, and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n> - L to (4,4): wall, cannot\n> - R to (6,4): free\n> \n> So I can go U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go U to (5,5), then from there, I can go U to (5,6), but (5,6) is wall, cannot. Or L to (4,5), or R to (6,5), etc.\n> \n> But (5,6) is wall, so from (5,5), I cannot go up.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,5) and (1,3), etc.\n> \n> But let's think about the short-life food at (2,3).\n> \n> If I don't eat it soon, it will disappear.\n> \n> Currently at turn 28, (2,3) can be eaten on turn 28 or 29.\n> \n> If I move directly to (2,3), how?\n> \n> From (5,3), I can go L to (4,3), then from (4,3) only L to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can go L to (2,3) or U to (3,4) or D to (3,2), etc.\n> \n> But from (4,3) to (3,3) is one move, then to (2,3) another.\n> \n> So from (5,3) to (2,3) takes at least two moves: turn 28 to (4,3), turn 29 to (3,3), then turn 30 to (2,3) but (2,3) disappears after turn 29? Life span 2 at turn 28: exists on turn 28 and 29, disappears on turn 30.\n> \n> So to eat (2,3), I must be on (2,3) on turn 28 or 29.\n> \n> On turn 28, I am at (5,3), not adjacent to (2,3), so I can't reach it in one move. Distance: x from 5 to 2, difference 3, so minimum 3 moves to reach (2,3) from (5,3), but I can only move one cell per turn.\n> \n> (5,3) to (4,3) in one move, then to (3,3) in second, then to (2,3) in third. But on turn 28, I can move to (4,3) or (5,4).\n> \n> If I move to (4,3) on turn 28, then on turn 29 I can move to (3,3), but (2,3) is still there on turn 29? Turn 29 is the last turn for (2,3).\n> \n> On turn 29, if I am at (3,3), I can move to (2,3) and eat it, since (2,3) exists on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, if I am at (4,3) on turn 28, then on turn 29 I go to (3,3), but (2,3) is at (2,3), which is adjacent to (3,3), so I can move directly to (2,3) on turn 29 from (3,3).\n> \n> Turn 29: from position (3,3), move to (2,3).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> But to get to (3,3) on turn 29, I need to be at (4,3) on turn 28.\n> \n> If I move directly to (5,4) on turn 28, I am at (5,4), then on turn 29, I can try to go left, but it's farther.\n> \n> From (5,4), I can go to (6,4) or (5,5), but to reach (2,3), it's harder.\n> \n> (2,3) is at (2,3), (5,4) at (5,4), difference in x and y, so multiple moves.\n> \n> For example, from (5,4) to (4,4) but (4,4) wall, cannot. So I have to go around, like to (6,4) or (5,5), then down or left, but it might take more than one turn to get to (2,3), and turn 29 is the last chance, so from (5,4) on turn 28, I can go to (4,4)? no, wall. Or to (6,4), then from (6,4) on turn 29, I can go to (6,3) but (6,3) wall, or to (6,5), or to (5,4) but reverse, or to (7,4) but x=7 wall, so from (6,4) only U to (6,5) or L to (5,4) but reverse not allowed if direction is R, etc.\n> \n> It's messy. From (5,4), I cannot reach (2,3) by turn 29 easily, because of obstacles.\n> \n> Let's see the path.\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If U to (5,5), then from (5,5), direction U, can go to U but (5,6) wall, or L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n> \n> Say go to (4,5), then from (4,5), can go to (4,6), (3,5), (4,4) but wall, etc. But (2,3) is at lower left, so it would take many turns.\n> \n> Similarly, from (5,4) go R to (6,4), then from (6,4) direction R, can go U to (6,5), or D to (6,3) but (6,3) wall, or L to (5,4) reverse not allowed, so only U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then to go left, I need to go to (5,5) or something, but (5,5) is above, not left.\n> \n> To reach (2,3) from (6,4) or (5,5), it might take 3 or more turns, and on turn 29, I need to be at (2,3), but from (5,4) on turn 28, I can only be at (5,5) or (6,4) on turn 29, both not close to (2,3).\n> \n> (5,5) to (2,3): x from 5 to 2, y from 5 to 3, difference 3 in x, 2 in y, so minimum 3 moves, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n> \n> For example, from (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (2,3), that's 4 moves from (5,5), but (3,4) might be free? Walls: (2,4) and (4,4) are walls, but (3,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But from (5,5) to (2,3) in 4 moves: e.g., (5,5) to (4,5), to (3,5), to (3,4), to (3,3), to (2,3) — that's 5 moves to reach (2,3) from (5,5), but positions: start from (5,5), move to (4,5) turn t, then (3,5) t+1, then (3,4) t+2, then (3,3) t+3, then (2,3) t+4.\n> \n> So from turn 28 at (5,4), after move to (5,5) on turn 29, then to reach (2,3) on turn 33, but (2,3) disappears after turn 29, so impossible to eat it if I go to (5,4) first.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go to (6,4) on turn 28, then turn 29 at (6,4) or (6,5), not closer to (2,3).\n> \n> So, if I want to eat (2,3), I must choose the left path now: move L to (4,3) on turn 28.\n> \n> Then on turn 29, I can move to (3,3), and then to (2,3) on the same turn? On turn 29, from (4,3) I move to (3,3), then on turn 30 I move to (2,3), but (2,3) disappears after turn 29, so on turn 30 it's gone. I need to be on (2,3) on turn 29.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3) on turn 28, on turn 29 I am at (4,3). From there, I can move to (3,3), but (3,3) is not (2,3). From (4,3), the only possible move is to (3,3), as we saw earlier, because U is wall, D is body, R is reverse and body.\n> \n> So on turn 29, I move from (4,3) to (3,3). Now at (3,3), and (2,3) is adjacent left. Can I move to (2,3) on turn 29?\n> \n> Turn 29: from position (3,3), I can move to (2,3), yes, and (2,3) is present on turn 29, so I can eat it.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> Turn 28: move L to (4,3)\n> Now positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) — tail (2,1) moved away, so (2,1) free.\n> \n> Turn 29: from (4,3), move to (3,3) — direction L, so can move L, U, D, not R.\n> - U to (3,4): is it free?

After turn 28, positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) — six segments, no growth, so tail (3,1) moves away when head moves to (3,3).\n> \n> On turn 29: head moves to (3,3), so new positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1) — and (3,1) is free now.\n> \n> (3,4) not occupied, not wall (walls: (2,4) is wall, but (3,4) not listed, so free).\n> \n> D to (3,2): free, I think.\n> \n> L to (2,3): (2,3) has food, and not occupied.\n> \n> R to (4,3): body and reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> U to (3,4): free.\n> \n> So from (3,3), I can move to (2,3) to eat food.\n> \n> Yes, on turn 29, I can eat (2,3).\n> \n> If I don't, I miss it.\n> \n> Now, the other option is to go to (5,4) and eat that food, but then I lose (2,3).\n> \n> (5,4) has life span 4, so I can eat it later, up to turn 31.\n> \n> (2,3) only until turn 29.\n> \n> Also, after eating (2,3), I grow, and I can go to other foods.\n> \n> Now, let's think about risks.\n> \n> If I go to (5,4), I eat immediately, but I might get stuck or something.\n> \n> From (5,4), as I thought, I can go to (5,5) or (6,4).\n> \n> (5,5) is near wall (5,6), so I have to be careful not to go up to (5,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is near (6,3) wall.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,5) and (1,3).\n> \n> (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left, near border.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (1,4) is wall, so (1,3) is below it.\n> \n> y=3, x=1.\n> \n> Now, if I go to eat (2,3), on turn 29 I eat it, so snake grows to 7 segments.\n> \n> Then positions: after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1) — and (3,1) free?

It's turn 29, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so that's 8x8 cells? Let me clarify: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, the borders are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning that cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but the walls are the outer edges, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> So walls include:\n> \n> - All cells where x=0 or x=7 for any y\n> \n> - All cells where y=0 or y=7 for any x\n> \n> - Plus specific internal cells: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,4) from below, I assume. Since it came from (5,3), which is down from (5,4), so current head at (5,4) and direction U, so it's facing up.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life_span 6\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life_span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all.\n> \n> Life_span: for (2,3) it's 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 29, life_span=1, so after this turn, it might disappear. Let me read the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life_span L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t+L-1, it disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> If life_span is N at turn t, it means:\n> \n> - At turn t, life_span N\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes N-1\n> \n> - It disappears when life_span reaches 0, so it exists as long as life_span > 0.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, it can be eaten, and after turn t, life_span becomes L-1. If L=1, after turn t, it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,3), life_span=1 at turn 29. So on turn 29, it can be eaten, but after turn 29, it will disappear, so if not eaten on turn 29, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) life_span=6, so it will last for 6 more turns including turn 29, so until turn 34? Let's calculate:\n> \n> At turn 29, life_span=6, so it can be eaten on turns 29,30,31,32,33,34? Since after each turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> - Turn 29: life_span=6, present\n> \n> - After turn 29, life_span=5\n> \n> - Turn 30: life_span=5, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 34: life_span=1, present\n> \n> - After turn 34, life_span=0, disappears, so not present on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life_span=9, so it will last until turn 37 or so.\n> \n> But we need to plan for the next few turns.\n> \n> Now, my goal is to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks. Think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be reverse. Reverse of U is D.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive, but x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells (x,y) with 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (5,6) is at x=5,y=6; (1,4) x=1,y=4; (4,4) x=4,y=4; (2,4) x=2,y=4; (6,3) x=6,y=3.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> Food at: (2,3), (2,5), (1,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is close to the snake, but life_span 1, must be eaten now or lost.\n> \n> (2,5) is above, life_span 6, can wait.\n> \n> (1,3) is left, life_span 9, can wait.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 29: U, L, R (since D not allowed)\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5): what's there? No wall, no obstacle? (5,5) is within playable area? x=5, y=5, between 1-6? y=5, x=5. Internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), etc., not (5,5). So (5,5) should be empty.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So (5,5) is not occupied by body. So it's free? But food might be there, but no food at (5,5). Food is at (2,3), (2,5), (1,3). So (5,5) is empty.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (5,5), no food, so snake moves, tail moves, so new positions: head at (5,5), then body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) and tail (2,1) moves to (3,1)? Let's see: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, head moves to (5,5), then the segment that was at (5,4) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So from positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ]\n> \n> After move U:\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,5)\n> \n> - Then (5,4) becomes the neck, but position: the segment that was at (5,4) is now at (5,4)? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the second segment moves to where head was, so to (5,4)\n> \n> The third segment moves to where second was, (5,3)\n> \n> Fourth to (5,2)\n> \n> Fifth to (4,2)\n> \n> Sixth to (4,1)\n> \n> Seventh to (3,1)\n> \n> And the tail at (2,1) is removed, so new positions: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) ]\n> \n> Tail was (2,1), which is removed, and (3,1) is now the last segment.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (4,4): (4,4) is an internal obstacle! (4,4) is in the internal obstacles list. So (4,4) is a wall, I cannot move there. Collision with wall.\n> \n> Similarly, move R to (6,4): what is (6,4)? x=6,y=4. Walls: border x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,4) is not listed. Internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (6,4) is not obstacle, so it should be free.\n> \n> But is it within bounds? x=6, y=4, 1≤x≤6? x=6 is playable? Grid from x=0 to 7, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to 6. So (6,4) is playable, no obstacle, not snake body? Body positions: (5,4), (5,3), etc., no (6,4), so free.\n> \n> But food? No, food at (2,3), etc.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - U to (5,5): possible, empty\n> \n> - L to (4,4): but (4,4) is obstacle, wall, cannot move, death\n> \n> - R to (6,4): possible, empty\n> \n> D is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> So only U or R.\n> \n> Now, moving U or R.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,3) with life_span 1, which must be eaten this turn or it disappears. Can I reach it this turn? From (5,4) to (2,3) is not adjacent; (5,4) to (2,3) is 3 units away in x, 1 in y, not adjacent. So I cannot reach it this turn. Only adjacent moves.\n> \n> So I cannot eat (2,3) on turn 29; it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Since life_span=1, after turn 29 it disappears, so if not eaten on turn 29, gone.\n> \n> I cannot eat it, so it will be lost.\n> \n> Now, other food: (2,5) and (1,3).\n> \n> Also, need to think about survival and future moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U or R on turn 29.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,5)\n> \n> Then positions: head at (5,5), body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)  // tail was (2,1), removed, so snake still 7 segments.\n> \n> Direction: since moved U, new head direction U.\n> \n> Now from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse, so since moved U, cannot D, so can U, L, R.\n> \n> U to (5,6): (5,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> L to (4,5): what is (4,5)? Empty? No wall, no obstacle, not body? Body positions: after move, body at (5,4), (5,3), etc., (4,5) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> R to (6,5): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> D not allowed.\n> \n> So from (5,5), can move L or R, U not possible.\n> \n> If move L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (6,4) on turn 29.\n> \n> Then positions: head at (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)  // (2,1) removed.\n> \n> Direction: moved R, so new direction R.\n> \n> From (6,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse, so cannot L (since L is opposite of R), so can U, D, R? Reverse of R is L, so cannot move L.\n> \n> So can move U, D, R.\n> \n> U to (6,5): is it free? (6,5) x=6,y=5, playable? Yes. Obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,5) not, so free. No body, so ok.\n> \n> D to (6,3): (6,3) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> R to (7,4): but x=7 is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so (7,4) invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move U to (6,5)? U to (6,5) or D, but D to (6,3) is wall, not possible.\n> \n> Moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but (6,3) wall, so only U possible? But D to (6,3) is invalid, and R to (7,4) invalid, L not allowed. So only U to (6,5) is possible from (6,4).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> From (6,4), after moving there, direction is R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse, so cannot move L (opposite of R).\n> \n> Can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> But R to (7,4): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,3): y=3, x=6, but (6,3) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,5): should be ok, as above.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then from there, head at (6,5), direction U (since moved U).\n> \n> Then possible moves, etc.\n> \n> But let's think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) and (1,3) are available.\n> \n> (2,3) will be gone after this turn.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (2,1), and food is at (2,3), which is not on tail, and (2,5), (1,3) not on tail.\n> \n> But if I move to a cell where food is under the body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves in, but currently, food is not under snake body, I think.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,3), (2,5), (1,3)\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So (2,3) is not occupied by snake; it's a different cell.

Segments: second segment to (5,5), third to (5,4)? Let's trace:\n> \n> - Head new: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then the segment that was at (5,5) moves to (4,5)? No: the body segments follow: the segment that was at index 1 ( (5,4) ) moves to where head was, (5,5)\n> \n> Index 2 ( (5,3) ) moves to where index 1 was, (5,4)\n> \n> Index 3 ( (5,2) ) to (5,3)\n> \n> Index 4 ( (4,2) ) to (5,2)\n> \n> Index 5 ( (4,1) ) to (4,2)\n> \n> Index 6 ( (3,1) ) to (4,1)\n> \n> And the tail (3,1) was last, but in positions, after move, the last segment moves to where the previous last was, so new positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1)  // and (3,1) removed, so tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved R from (5,5) to (6,5), similar.\n> \n> But back to sequence.\n> \n> From (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Then turn 31: possible moves: U, D, R?

It's turn 30, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but the walls occupy those, so the snake can only be in cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles are given, but for borders, moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be a wall collision. Similarly for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake has 7 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, which is (x,y+1). Since it's moving Up, from (5,5) to... positions are given as head first, so from (5,5) to (5,4), which is down? Let's see: positions are [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]. Head is (5,5), and it's moving Up, but (5,4) is directly below (5,5) since y decreases as we go down? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But here, since Up is (x,y+1), that suggests that y increases as we go up, like in standard Cartesian coordinates? But in computer graphics, often y increases downward. Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Head direction U means moving to (x,y+1). So if head is at (5,5) and direction U, it would move to (5,6) if possible.\n> \n> But in the positions, after head (5,5), next is (5,4), which has a lower y, so y=4 < y=5, so (5,4) is below (5,5) if y=0 is bottom. I think y=0 is bottom, so increasing y goes up.\n> \n> Standard: if (0,0) is bottom-left, then moving Up increases y.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall? Border cells: y=0 and y=7 are walls. So if y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, then moving Up from (x,y) to (x,y+1) increases y towards top.\n> \n> Similarly, Down to (x,y-1) decreases y towards bottom.\n> \n> In snake positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), all decreasing y, so that means the snake was moving down before, but now head direction is U, so it just turned or something? Positions: from head to tail: (5,5), then (5,4) which is below, so the head was at (5,5) and previous position was (5,4)? No: the list is head first, so at turn t, head is at (5,5), and it was at (5,4) at turn t-1, but since it moved to (5,5), and direction is U, meaning it moved Up to (5,5) from (5,4)? But (5,4) to (5,5) is Up, since y increased from 4 to 5.\n> \n> (5,4) to (5,5) is +y, which is Up. But in the positions list, (5,5) is head, then (5,4) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is next, and so on.\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning the snake is currently facing Up, so from (5,5), it can move Up to (5,6), Down to (5,4) but that would be reverse, which is not allowed instantly, Left to (4,5), or Right to (6,5).\n> \n> No instant reverse: since direction is U, it cannot move Down (opposite) on this turn.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with life_span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life_span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life_span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 30, so for (2,5), life_span 6, so it will disappear after turn 30+6-1=35? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 30, life_span=6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. So it disappears at the end of turn 35? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: if life_span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N more turns. So after turn t+N-1, it is gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown=N, at turn t+1, countdown=N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, countdown=1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not available at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 30, food at (2,5) has life_span 6, so countdown=6. After turn 30, countdown becomes 5 at turn 31, ..., after turn 35, countdown becomes 0 and it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 30 to 35 inclusive? At turn 35, if eaten, it should be before it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and at the end of turn t, life_span decreases to L-1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span N:\n> \n> - Can be eaten on turns when countdown >=1\n> \n> - After being eaten or when countdown=0, it is removed.\n> \n> But here, at turn 30, life_span=6, so it can be eaten on turns 30,31,32,33,34,35? At turn 35, life_span would be 1 before the turn, and after turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> But let's not worry about exact disappearance for now.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,5) and (1,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Eating it on Turn 32 is optimal.\n   - After eating at (2,5), the snake grows, and the tail remains at (4,2). The head is at (2,5), and the next moves could be Up to (2,6) or Left to (1,5).\n   - Potential issue: After eating at (2,5), the snake may get stuck in the top-left corner with limited moves, leading to a dead end (as seen in the previous analysis).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,6):**\n   - Immediate benefit: Moves the snake towards the top, avoiding immediate collision risks.\n   - Next move from (4,6) would be Left (L) to (3,6) (only valid move).\n   - From (3,6), can move Down to (3,5) on Turn 33, then Left to (2,5) to eat the food on Turn 34.\n   - This path also leads to eating the food at (2,5) but delays it by one turn (still within its life span).\n   - After eating at (2,5), the snake is in a similar position as above, with potential to get stuck.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both moves eventually lead to eating the food at (2,5), but moving Left first allows eating it one turn earlier.\n- Moving Up first delays eating the food but may provide slightly more flexibility in subsequent moves (though both paths risk getting stuck).\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Avoid (2,5) and Target Other Food:**\n- The food at (1,3) has a life span of 7 (disappears after Turn 37), and the food at (4,1) has a life span of 10 (disappears after Turn 40).\n- Moving Left to (3,5) then Down to (3,4), etc., can target (1,3) or (4,1), but this misses the immediate opportunity at (2,5).\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the immediate opportunity to eat the positive food at (2,5) and the lack of a clear long-term survival path that avoids getting stuck, the best immediate action is to move Left to (3,5) to eat the food on the next turn. This maximizes the score in the short term, even though it may lead to a dead end later. \n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are the borders. There are also internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,5) from (5,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,5) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n> - (1,3) with life span 7, value +1\n> - (4,1) with life span 10, value +1. But (4,1) is currently occupied by the snake's tail! The snake positions end with (4,1), so food at (4,1) is under the tail.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is under the snake's body. According to the rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Since it's the tail, when the snake moves, the tail will leave (4,1) if it moves forward, but the head needs to go there to eat it.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide after growing.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5)\n> Tail position: (4,1)\n> \n> They are not adjacent; (4,5) to (4,1) is 4 units away vertically, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Distance: x same, y differs by 4, so not adjacent. So no immediate danger from that food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.

(4,6) is not listed, so should be free, but let's check if it's occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc. (4,6) is not in snake positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Down: (4,4) - but (4,4) is an internal obstacle!

When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> After move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). Tail was (4,1), but since no growth, tail segment is removed, so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]? Let's see: original positions: index 0: (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,1)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5), the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,5), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,5), segment 3 to (5,4), segment 4 to (5,3), segment 5 to (5,2), segment 6 to (4,2). And tail (4,1) is left, so it is removed. So new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> (4,2) was index 5, now becomes the tail.\n> \n> And food at (4,1) is now free, since tail moved away.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), I can move left to (2,5) to eat the food there on turn 32.\n> \n> (2,5) has food with value +1.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so positions: head to (2,5), body: previous positions, but tail doesn't move, so new segment added at the end.\n> \n> After turn 32: head moves to (2,5), body: segment 1 to (3,5), segment 2 to (4,5), etc., up to segment 6 to (5,2)? Let's list.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> After move to (2,5): head (2,5), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and since growth, (4,2) remains as new tail? No.\n> \n> When head eats food, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail moves only if no growth.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food, head moves, each segment moves forward, tail removed.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to food, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move, so snake length increases by one, and the position where tail was is now part of body, with the segment that was tail staying, and new segment not added; the tail cell is kept.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to food cell, the body moves such that the tail position remains occupied, so the snake grows.\n> \n> For example: positions [A,B,C,D] tail D.\n> \n> Move head to new cell E (with food), then new positions: [E, A, B, C, D] or [E, A, B, C] and D remains? No.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to the new cell, the neck moves to where head was, and so on, but since food eaten, the tail does not advance, so the last segment stays, meaning the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food, then previous head position, then next, up to tail, and tail position is still there.\n> \n> In this case, before move: [H, B1, B2, B3, T] for simplicity.\n> \n> After move to food: new head at F, then H, B1, B2, B3. T remains as part of body, so positions [F, H, B1, B2, B3] with B3 being the new end, but T is B3? Let's index.\n> \n> In our case, before eating: positions P = [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6] with P0 head, P6 tail.\n> \n> After moving to food without growth: new head to new pos, then P0 becomes new neck, P1 to P0, ..., P6 to P5, and P6 vacated.\n> \n> With growth: head moves to new pos (food), then P0 becomes new segment after head, P1 to where P0 was, ..., P6 stays where it is, so new positions: [new head, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6] so length increases by one, tail is P6.\n> \n> In the move, P6 doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case for turn 32: if I move to (2,5) from (3,5), and (2,5) has food.\n> \n> Before move: positions at turn 31 end: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> Head at (3,5), tail at (4,2)\n> \n> Move head to (2,5) to eat food.

So, coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Current turn is 32.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are the edges, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So, these are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and tail at (4,2). So the snake has 7 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (3,5). Since it was moving left, I cannot instantly reverse to right on the next move. So, for turn 32, possible moves are U, D, L, but not R, because R would be opposite to L.\n> \n> Current head position is (3,5), direction L. So from (3,5), moving left would go to (2,5), up to (3,6), down to (3,4). Right to (4,5) is not possible because it's the opposite direction and also (4,5) is occupied by the body.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: (3,6)\n> \n> - D: (3,4)\n> \n> - L: (2,5)\n> \n> - R: (4,5) but (4,5) is the first body segment, so it's occupied.

Food positions: (2,5,4,1) which is (x,y) = (2,5), value 1, life span 4.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 32, life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it disappears at turn t + L - 1?

Turn 32: countdown 4, exists; turn 33: countdown 3, exists; turn 34: countdown 2, exists; turn 35: countdown 1, exists; turn 36: countdown 0, disappears, so not present on turn 36.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From head (3,5), possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4)\n> \n> - L: to (2,5) which has food.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,5), I eat the food, since it's positive, value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to check for risks.\n> \n> First, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2). Head is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (4,2). Adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (3,5) and (4,2): delta x=1, delta y=3, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n> \n> (3,5) and (4,2): |dx|=1, |dy|=3, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, after eating, snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (2,5), body follows, so the segment that was at (4,5) moves to (3,5), and so on, tail stays or new segment? When eating, length increases, so a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail moves, it's a bit tricky.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So if I move to (2,5), I eat food, so the snake grows: head at (2,5), then the previous positions: (3,5) becomes part of body, (4,5) to (5,5), etc., and the tail at (4,2) stays, so new segment is added, making snake longer.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (2,5) and eat, new snake: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) — and since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so (4,2) is still there, but now it's not the tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) ] so 7 segments.\n> \n> After moving left to (2,5), head to (2,5). Then, the body: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where head was?

It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). Snake positions: head at (3,3), then body segments at (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). Since head is at (3,3) and direction is D (down), that means the snake is moving downwards, so from (3,3) down to (3,2) or something, but let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> Head is (3,3), direction is D, so it just moved down to (3,3). Previous position must have been above, like (3,2) or something? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The positions are given from head to tail: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). Since direction is D (down), that means the snake was moving down, so from (3,4) to (3,3), I think? I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Standard Snake: the head moves, and the body follows. Positions are listed with head first, so index 0 is head, index 1 is the first body segment, and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> So at turn 34, head is at (3,3), and it moved down to there. Direction is D, so it was previously at (3,4) or something? Let's see the positions:\n> \n> - Index 0: (3,3) - head, current position\n> \n> - Index 1: (3,4) - this is north of head? (3,3) to (3,4) is up, but direction is D, down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Coordinates: let's assume (x,y), with (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But in the walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is one edge, y=7 is the opposite.\n> \n> In the movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And walls at y=0 and y=7, so if y increases upwards, then y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. But let's confirm with snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4). Since (3,4) has higher y, it's above (3,3) if y increases upwards. Direction is D (down), meaning head moved down to (3,3). So previous head position was (3,4), and it moved down to (3,3). Then the body: from (3,4) to (3,5) to (4,5), etc.\n> \n> List all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3) at turn 34\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,4) — this is directly above head, y=4 > y=3, so north\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,5) — above that\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,5) — east of (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,5) — east of (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,4) — south of (5,5), y=4 < y=5\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,3) — south of (5,4), and same y as head, but x=5\n> \n> Tail is (5,3), which is east of head at same y-level.\n> \n> Direction is D, down, so from previous turn, head was at (3,4), moved down to (3,3). Then the body segments shifted: the segment that was at (3,4) is now at (3,3)? No, in Snake, when head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Positions at turn 34: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> After head moves, say to a new position, the neck (index 1) moves to where head was, and so on, tail moves to where second last was.\n> \n> But for current state, head is at (3,3), and direction D means it just moved down from (3,4) to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so all good to eat, but we need to consider life span; they disappear after that many turns.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, I think? The rule says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 34, for a food with life span 2, after this turn, it will have 1 left, then gone after turn 35? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if a food has life span L, during turn t, it can be eaten, and after turn t, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (2,5) with life span 2 at turn 34: it can be eaten on turn 34 or 35. After turn 34, if not eaten, life span becomes 1. After turn 35, if not eaten, life span becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

It's turn 37, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so that's 8x8 cells, but since walls are at the borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but the cells from (0,0) to (7,7) are all possible, but the borders are walls, so snake can't go there. Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it was moving down to (2,1) from (2,2)? Positions are listed head first: [(2,1), (2,2), ...], and head direction is D, so it moved down to (2,1). But (2,1) is the head, so from where? Previous position must have been (2,2) or something. Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (2,1) head, index 1: (2,2), index 2: (3,2), index 3: (3,3), index 4: (3,4), index 5: (3,5), index 6: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Head direction is D, so it's facing down. That means from the previous turn, it was at (2,2) and moved down to (2,1). Since direction is given as current head direction, which is down.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All are positive food since value is 1, and no negative food mentioned. Life span is how many turns left, including current turn, so for (1,3), it disappears after 2 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 39 or something? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if at turn t, life_span is L, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - It disappears when countdown reaches 0, so it is present for L turns starting from turn t.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, countdown is L, then after turn t, it decreases to L-1. So it exists until the end of turn when countdown is 1, and disappears before turn when countdown would be 0. But since it decreases at the end of the turn, I think it means:\n> \n> - At the start of turn t, if life_span is L, it is present.\n> \n> - After the turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> - So if L=1, it is present at turn t, and disappears after that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if L=2, present at turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (1,3), life_span=2 at turn 37, so it will be present for turn 37 and 38, and disappear after turn 38, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): life_span=4, present for turns 37,38,39,40.\n> \n> (2,6): life_span=7, turns 37 to 43.\n> \n> (6,5): life_span=10, turns 37 to 46.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 37.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,1)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down)\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move up, down, left, right, but cannot instant reverse. Since current direction is down, reverse would be up, so I cannot move up on the next turn. So possible actions from (2,1) with direction D: I can move down, left, or right. Not up, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Directions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) up\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) down\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) right\n> \n> Head at (2,1), so:\n> \n> - Move U: (2,1) to (2,2)\n> \n> - Move D: (2,1) to (2,0)\n> \n> - Move L: (1,1)\n> \n> - Move R: (3,1)\n> \n> But (2,0) is y=0, which is a wall, so cannot move down to (2,0).

Current direction is R, so next move can be U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left).\n> \n> Snake body: positions are [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. So, let's list the cells:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,5)  // tail\n> \n> Now, grid with walls and obstacles:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n> \n> I should make a mental grid.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n> \n> Obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> And snake: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> Food at: (1,3), (4,1), (2,6), (6,5)\n> \n> Life spans: (1,3) has life 1, so must be eaten this turn or it's gone. (4,1) life 3, (2,6) life 6, (6,5) life 9.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,1), direction R. Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by the snake body, segment 3? Positions: (3,1) head, then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) is the third segment. So moving to (3,2) would be colliding with body, which is deadly. Unless it's the tail, but (3,2) is not the tail; tail is (3,5). So (3,2) is a body segment, not tail. Therefore, moving U to (3,2) is collision.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,0). But y=0 is wall, so that's a wall collision, deadly.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,1). (4,1) is a food position? Food at (4,1) is present, but let's see what (4,1) is. (4,1) has food with value 1. Also, is (4,1) occupied? Snake positions: (3,1), (2,1), etc., no (4,1), so it's free? But (4,1) has food, so moving there would eat it.\n> \n> But we need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> - U: (3,2) - occupied by snake body (segment 3), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,0) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (4,1) - what is here? (4,1) has food, and it's not occupied by snake or wall? Walls: borders, but (4,1) is within bounds? x=4, y=1, x from 0-7, y from 0-7, so not border. Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3) — none at (4,1). Snake: positions don't include (4,1). So (4,1) is free, with food.\n> \n> So R to (4,1) is possible.\n> \n> - L: Left to (2,1), but (2,1) is occupied by the first body segment. (2,1) is segment 1, immediately behind head. Moving left to (2,1) would collide with body. Also, direction is R, moving left is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed anyway. So L is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move this turn is R to (4,1). Is that right?\n> \n> But let's confirm.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), direction R. Moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,2) - body segment at (3,2), collision.\n> \n> - D: (3,0) - wall.\n> \n> - L: (2,1) - body segment and opposite direction, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (4,1) - free, with food.\n> \n> Yes, so only R is possible this turn? But that seems too constrained. Let me double-check the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> So (3,2) is occupied, yes. (2,1) occupied, yes.\n> \n> And (4,1) is not in snake positions, not a wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> Food at (4,1) is present, so moving to (4,1) would eat the food, increasing length by 1, score +1.\n> \n> But life span of (4,1) is 3, so it has a few turns left, but since we're moving there, it gets eaten now.\n> \n> Now, the food at (1,3) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. But can we eat it? From (3,1), (1,3) is two cells away, not adjacent, so we can't reach it this turn. So it will disappear after this turn anyway.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods are farther.\n> \n> But for this turn, only R to (4,1) seems possible.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will grow since we eat food, so the new position will be head at (4,1), and tail stays, so positions become: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] — since we ate food, length increases, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves off last cell. But when eating, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> So after eating at (4,1), new positions: head at (4,1), then previous head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So 8 segments now.\n> \n> Head direction: we moved R, so new direction is R.\n> \n> Now, turn 39.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, for turn 38, action must be R, since it's the only choice.\n> \n> But let's confirm if there are other options. Is there a way to not go to (4,1)? But from above, no other moves are possible without dying. So we have to go R to (4,1).\n> \n> Then, on turn 39, head at (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - U: (4,2)\n> \n> - D: (4,0) - but y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: (3,1) - which is now occupied by the second segment? Positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), which is the neck, so moving left to (3,1) would collide with body. Also, opposite direction? Current direction is R, moving left is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. Invalid.\n> \n> - R: (5,1)\n> \n> Now, (5,1): is it free? Let's see walls: no, internal obstacles: (5,6) is one, but (5,1) not listed. Snake positions: after move, positions are [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)], so (5,1) not occupied.\n> \n> Food: no food at (5,1), I think. Food positions are (1,3) gone after this turn? Turn 38: we eat (4,1), so (4,1) food consumed. (1,3) life span 1, so after turn 38, it disappears since not eaten. Other foods: (2,6), (6,5) remain.\n> \n> After turn 38: food at (1,3) disappears because life span 1 and not eaten. (4,1) eaten, so gone. (2,6) life span 6, so it has 5 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn 38, (1,3) has life span 1, so if not eaten on turn 38, it disappears after turn 38. Similarly, (4,1) eaten on turn 38.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 38 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for (1,3), at turn 38, life span 1, so it is present only for turn 38; if not eaten during turn 38, it vanishes after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life span 3 at turn 38, so it will disappear after turn 40? Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> At turn t, a food with life span L will disappear after t + L - 1 turns? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span L. After turn t, countdown decreases to L-1. It disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, with life span L, it means it has L turns left, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, it can be eaten; after that, if not eaten, countdown decreases to L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until countdown 0, after which it disappears.\n> \n> For (1,3) at turn 38: life span 1, so it is available only on turn 38; if not eaten, it disappears before turn 39.\n> \n> (4,1) at turn 38: life span 3, so available on turns 38,39,40; disappears after turn 40 if not eaten by then.\n> \n> (2,6): life span 6, available turns 38 to 43; disappears after turn 43.\n> \n> (6,5): life span 9, available turns 38 to 46; disappears after turn 46.\n> \n> Back to turn 39.\n> \n> After turn 38 action R, head at (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) — is this free? Snake positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (4,2) not in positions. Walls: no. Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3) — not (4,2).

Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (4,2) is not in obstacles, and not border since x=4, y=2 between 1 and 6? y=0 and y=7 borders, so y=2 is fine. x=4 between 1 and 6? x=0 and x=7 borders, so x=4 is fine.

But let's check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Available moves: since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be opposite direction, and no instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move L to (4,1), which is occupied by body anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: (5,2) — but (5,2) has food? Food at (5,2) is present, but also, is it occupied? Snake body: (5,2) is not in the positions list; positions are (5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4). (5,2) is free, and has food with value 1.\n> \n> - D: (5,0) — but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - L: (4,1) — but (4,1) is occupied by body segment, and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Also, cannot move opposite direction, so L is invalid anyway.\n> \n> - R: (6,1) — which is free, as per above.\n> \n> So from (5,1), possible moves are U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> Now, (5,2) has food, so moving there would eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks and long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about food under body: but (5,2) is not under body, it's free.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,2): life span 10, so plenty of time, but it's close.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), I eat the food, snake length increases by 1, so new head at (5,2), and tail stays or moves? When you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn, so new positions would be: head moves to (5,2), body follows, so segment that was at (4,1) moves to (5,1), etc., and the tail remains, so new tail is still (3,4)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index: pos[0] = head (5,1), pos[1] = (4,1), pos[2] = (3,1), pos[3] = (2,1), pos[4] = (2,2), pos[5] = (3,2), pos[6] = (3,3), pos[7] = (3,4) tail.\n> \n> If I move to (5,2) and eat food, new head is (5,2), and the body shifts: pos[1] becomes (5,1), pos[2] becomes (4,1), ..., up to pos[7] becomes (3,3), and a new segment is added where the tail was, so new tail at (3,4)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, so the segment that was the last body segment stays, and a new segment is added, so the tail position doesn't change immediately; instead, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, effectively the tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the new positions are: [new_head] + previous positions except the tail is not removed, so the list has one more element.\n> \n> For example, current positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n> \n> Move to free cell: new positions: new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., (T-1) — tail T is removed.\n> \n> Move to food: new positions: new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T — so T stays, and new segment at T position? No.\n> \n> When moving to food: head moves to food cell, and the body follows, but since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the last segment remains. So positions become: [new_head] + [old_head] + [old_body without last] but the last body segment is included.\n> \n> Better: the snake has segments S0, S1, S2, ..., Sk where S0 is head, Sk is tail.\n> \n> After moving to empty cell: new head at new_pos, new S1 = old S0, new S2 = old S1, ..., new Sk = old S_{k-1}, and old Sk is removed.\n> \n> After moving to food: new head at food_pos, new S1 = old S0, new S2 = old S1, ..., new Sk = old S_{k-1}, and new S_{k+1} = old Sk, so tail stays and new segment added.\n> \n> In this case, k=7 segments? Positions list has 8 elements, from 0 to 7, so 8 segments.\n> \n> After eating: new head at (5,2), new pos[1] = old head (5,1), new pos[2] = old pos[1] (4,1), new pos[3] = old pos[2] (3,1), new pos[4] = old pos[3] (2,1), new pos[5] = old pos[4] (2,2), new pos[6] = old pos[5] (3,2), new pos[7] = old pos[6] (3,3), and new pos[8] = old pos[7] (3,4) tail. So now tail is at (3,4), and the new segment is at (3,4), but old tail was (3,4), so it stays, and snake is longer.\n> \n> Positions: new [ (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] so head at (5,2), tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if move to (6,1) without eating, positions become [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) ] and tail (3,4) is removed.\n> \n> Now back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 40, from (5,1), I can:\n> \n> - Move U to (5,2): eat food, grow to length 9, head now at (5,2), direction changes to U.\n> \n> - Move R to (6,1): no food, head at (6,1), direction R, snake remains length 8, tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, other food: (2,6) and (6,5), with shorter life spans.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 43 or it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 7, by turn 46.\n> \n> (5,2) has longer life.\n> \n> But (5,2) is right above, so eating it now might be tempting, but I have to consider if it's safe.\n> \n> There is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, after eating, the head is at (5,2), and the tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,2) and (3,4) are not adjacent; (5,2) to (3,4) is diagonal, not edge-adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> But let's see the position after moving to (5,2): head (5,2), body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> Now, from (5,2), possible moves: direction is now U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Current direction after move would be U.\n> \n> Can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse, but since just moved U, cannot move D immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,3) — is it free? Let's check obstacles and body.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,3) not in obstacles, and not in current body positions except head is at (5,2), so (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> Body positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc., (5,3) not occupied.\n> \n> - D: (5,1) — but (5,1) is now the second segment, so occupied, cannot move there. Also, cannot move down because it's opposite to current direction U? Current direction is U, so moving D is opposite, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (4,2) — is it free? Body: (4,1) is there, but (4,2) not in positions, and not obstacle. Obstacles include (4,4) but (4,2) is different. So (4,2) free.\n> \n> - R: (6,2) — free? (6,2) not obstacle, not body.\n> \n> So from (5,2), can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> But if I eat at (5,2) now, I might be blocking myself or something.\n> \n> I need to consider not eating it immediately to avoid being trapped or to reach other food.\n> \n> But (2,6) has short life, only 5 turns left, so I need to get to it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) has 7 turns.\n> \n> (5,2) has 10, so less urgent.\n> \n> But (5,2) is very close.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 6x6 playable, x=1-6, y=1-6.\n> \n> Walls at borders, obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,1), body down to (3,4)\n> \n> Food: (2,6), (6,5), (5,2)\n> \n> (5,2) is at (5,2), which is directly above head.\n> \n> To reach (2,6), which is at (2,6), near top-left.\n> \n> (6,5) at bottom-right.\n> \n> From current position (5,1), if I move R to (6,1), then I can go up towards (6,5) or something.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), eat food, then I'm at (5,2), and I can move to access other areas.\n> \n> But let's think about the obstacles and the snake body.\n> \n> Notice that the snake has a loop or something? Positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So it's like the snake went left to (2,1), then up to (2,2), right to (3,2), up to (3,3), up to (3,4). So there's a sort of \"peninsula\" at (2,1)-(2,2)-(3,2) area.\n> \n> If I eat at (5,2), I grow, and the body might block paths.\n> \n> But let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, I need to output an action sequence for several turns.\n> \n> But I have to choose for turn 40.\n> \n> Also, for the sequence, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Let me consider options for turn 40.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,2), eat food.

Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,4) should be free. (5,5) free? (5,6) obstacle, so (5,5) is free, but (5,6) is walled.\n> \n> (5,5) is playable, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) free.\n> \n> But from (5,2), I might want to go towards (2,6) or (6,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), which is row 6, col 2.\n> \n> y=6 is top, since y=0 bottom?

It's turn 42. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,3) from below, since previous position was (5,2), and direction U indicates it came from south to north.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 5, value +1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for both.\n> \n> Life span: (2,6) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Let me check the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for (2,6), life span 3 at turn 42. After turn 42, countdown to 2; turn 43, to 1; turn 44, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 42, 43, or 44, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 5: disappears after turn 46 (42+4?

No.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life_span L means:\n> \n> - On turn t, L decreases to L-1? Or L is the remaining turns?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is N, it will disappear after N more turns. So at turn t, with life_span L, it will be gone by turn t+L.\n> \n> But countdown decreases: on turn t, countdown is L; after turn t, it becomes L-1; when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – this is a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

So if N=3 at turn 42, after turn 42, countdown=2; after turn 43, countdown=1; after turn 44, countdown=0 and it disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 42,43,44.\n> \n> Similarly for N=5 at turn 42, can be eaten on turns 42 to 46.\n> \n> In the food list, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), so for (2,6,3,1), life_span=3 at turn 42.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (opposite) on the next turn because of \"no instant reverse\".

It's turn 44. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). Snake positions: head at (6,4), then body segments at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). That's 9 segments, so the snake is length 9. Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (6,4) from (5,4) since previous position was (5,4), and now head at (6,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 44, life span is 1, meaning after this turn, it might be gone? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,6): life_span=1 at turn 44. That means it will disappear after turn 44, so if not eaten on turn 44, it's gone. Similarly, (6,5) has life_span=3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns, including turn 44? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (2,6) at turn 44, life_span=1, so if not eaten on turn 44, after turn 44, life_span becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 45. Similarly, (6,5) life_span=3 at turn 44, so it will be there for turns 44,45,46, disappear after turn 46.\n> \n> Also, (1,2) life_span=9, so it will be there for a while.\n> \n> Values: all food has value 1? (2,6,1,1), (6,5,3,1), (1,2,9,1) – the third number is life_span, second is value? Let's see input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for (2,6), value=1, life_span=1; (6,5), value=1, life_span=3; (1,2), value=1, life_span=9. All positive food since value=1, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for turn 44 and a few turns ahead, thinking 5+ turns. The action sequence should be for turns 44,45,46,etc., but I need to specify how many? The answer format says \"action sequence (in order)\" for turns starting from t1, but it doesn't specify how many turns. I think I should plan for at least 5 turns ahead, but the sequence might be shorter if I can only plan that far. I should provide actions for multiple turns based on the plan.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid instant reverse: since head direction is R, I cannot move L on the next turn.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,4)\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): U (6,5), D (6,3), L (5,4), R (7,4)\n> \n> But R (7,4) is x=7, which is a border wall, so I cannot move there. Walls: x=0 or x=7, so x=7 is wall, cannot move to (7,4).\n> \n> D (6,3): but there is an internal obstacle at (6,3), so cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (6,3) is an obstacle, cannot move to (6,3).\n> \n> L (5,4): but (5,4) is the first body segment of the snake. Can I move there? Movement constraints: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,2). So if I move to (5,4), it's a body collision and I die.\n> \n> U (6,5): that might be possible. (6,5) has food? Food at (6,5) is present, value 1.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,6) has life_span 1, so only available this turn.\n> \n> But (2,6) is far away, at turn 44, I'm at (6,4), so I can't reach it in one move. Distance: from (6,4) to (2,6) is |6-2|=4 in x, |4-6|=2 in y, so min moves is 4+2=6, but with obstacles, might be more. Anyway, I can't get there this turn, so (2,6) will disappear after this turn since life_span=1. So I can ignore it; it's not reachable and will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is far, but life_span=9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, immediate options at turn 44:\n> \n> From head (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,5)\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) but (6,3) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) but (5,4) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? (6,5) is a food position, but let's see if it's safe to move there.\n> \n> (6,5) has food with value 1 and life_span=3, so it's positive food.\n> \n> But I need to consider if moving there causes any immediate danger.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (2,2), far away, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (6,5), I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (6,5), and tail stays? When I eat food, length increases by one, so the new segment is added where? Typically in Snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move that turn? Let me check rules.\n> \n> \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n> \n> And movement: each turn, head moves to a new cell, and tail moves to the previous position, unless food eaten, then tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the snake grows: the head is at the new cell, and the tail remains in place for that turn, so the new segment is effectively added when the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,5): is (6,5) occupied by body? Snake positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] – so (6,5) is not in the list, and it's not a wall except the obstacle which is at (6,3), not (6,5). (6,5) is free? But there is food there, so it's a cell with food.\n> \n> Also, is there any body at (6,5)? No, positions are all listed, (6,5) not there.\n> \n> So moving to (6,5) should be fine, and I eat the food, so score +1, and snake grows to length 10. After move, head at (6,5), body: since I ate food, tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (6,5), then previous head (6,4) becomes first body, then (5,4), (5,3), ..., up to (2,2), and tail stays at (2,2) for now? Let's sequence:\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), ..., 8: tail (2,2)\n> \n> After moving U to (6,5) and eating food:\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,5)\n> \n> - Since food eaten, tail does not move, so the segment at tail remains, and a new segment is added, but in terms of positions: the head is new at (6,5), and the body includes all previous positions, so snake becomes: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] – length 10.\n> \n> (2,1) is still there, and tail is (2,2), but now (2,1) is part of body, tail is (2,2).\n> \n> In the list, positions: new head (6,5), then (6,4) (previous head), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and tail (2,2). (2,1) was index 5? Current: indices: 0:(6,4), 1:(5,4), 2:(5,3), 3:(5,2), 4:(5,1), 5:(4,1), 6:(3,1), 7:(2,1), 8:(2,2)\n> \n> After move: head to (6,5), and since ate food, tail stays, so positions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] so (2,2) is still tail, and (2,1) is now the second last.\n> \n> Now, after this, head direction was R, but I moved U, so new head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, for future turns, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> But is there any danger at (6,5)?

Not in positions, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,6) is at (5,6), (6,6) is different. Walls: y=7 is top, x=7 right, etc. (6,6) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=6<7, so ok.\n> \n> But (6,6) has no food mentioned, but might be empty.\n> \n> Now, at turn 44, I must move U to (6,5) because it's the only possible move?

It's turn 45. The grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). Snake positions are given as a list: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). The head direction is U, which is up.

Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 9 more turns, so at turn 54 if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize. X from 0 to 7, Y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake: head (6,5), body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). So the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Food at (1,2).\n> \n> Head direction is U, so from (6,5), moving up would go to (6,6).

However, since the snake will move, the tail might move, but I need to be careful.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But only if it's the tail, not other body parts.\n> \n> Current tail is (2,2). The cell (6,4) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving down to (6,4) would cause a body collision because it's occupied by the body and won't be vacated when the head moves there, since only the tail moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail position is vacated. But other body positions are not vacated; they are still occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by the body after the move, it collides, except if it's moving to the current tail position, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, from (6,5), moving down to (6,4): (6,4) is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the head would be at (6,4), and the body segments shift: the old head (6,5) becomes new second segment, so (6,4) is now the new head position? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [head: (6,5), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (5,4), ..., tail: (2,2)]\n> \n> After moving down to (6,4): the head moves to (6,4), but (6,4) is currently occupied by seg1. After the move, the new positions would be: head at (6,4), then the old head (6,5) becomes the new seg1, but seg1 was at (6,4), which is now the head, so the body segments: seg1 moves to where seg2 was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all segments shift, so the tail end is removed.\n> \n> Specifically: new head position is (6,4) for down move. Then the body segments: the first body segment was at (6,4), but since head is now at (6,4), that cell is taken, so the segment that was at (6,4) needs to move to the next, but it's confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves by adding a new head position and removing the tail position, if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail not removed.\n> \n> But for collision: a collision occurs if the new head position is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, because when the head moves to the tail position, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that is the tail is safe, but moving to any other body segment is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, walls are deadly.\n> \n> Also, food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> Now back to possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - U: to (6,6). Is (6,6) valid? y=6 is within 0-7, x=6. Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall. x=6 not border. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free, but (6,6) might be near border? y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is at y=6, which is one below y=7, so it should be ok, as long as not wall cell. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,6) is not a wall cell. Similarly, internal obstacles listed, (6,6) not among them. So (6,6) should be empty.\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake body: current positions: (6,5) head, (6,4), (5,4), etc. (6,6) is not occupied, so moving up to (6,6) should be safe.\n> \n> - D: to (6,4). (6,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Tail is at (2,2), so (6,4) is not tail, so cannot move down.\n> \n> - L: left to (5,5). x=5, y=5. Is this free? Walls: not border, not internal obstacle. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,5) not listed. Snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc. (5,5) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> - R: right to (7,5). But x=7 is border wall, so moving right to (7,5) is wall collision, invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), D is invalid because body collision, R is wall.\n> \n> So only U or L possible from current position.\n> \n> Head direction is U, so if I move D, it would be instant reverse, which is not allowed? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So moving down is not allowed because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> Rule says: \"on next turn\", meaning from current state, I cannot choose to move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move D.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), possible actions: U or L. D is invalid due to reverse and body collision, R is wall.\n> \n> So choices: Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,2) with value 1, life span 9. Since current turn is 45, it disappears after turn 54, so we have 9 turns to eat it if we want.\n> \n> But (1,2) is currently occupied? Snake positions include (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), etc. (1,2) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, but let's see.\n> \n> Food is at (1,2), and snake has segment at (2,2), which is adjacent, but (1,2) itself is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions are given, and (1,2) is not listed, so it should be empty, with food on it.\n> \n> But the food might be under the body? No, positions: snake is at (2,2), (2,1), (1,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> List snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). So (2,2) is tail, (2,1) is second last, etc. (1,2) is not occupied by snake, so food is there, and it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> Now, (1,2) is at x=1,y=2. We are at (6,5), so it's far away.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to eat this food if beneficial, but also consider other possible food or dangers.\n> \n> Currently only one food is given: (1,2,9,1)\n> \n> Life span 9, value 1.\n> \n> Since it's positive food, eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> But we need to get there safely.\n> \n> First, from current, I need to choose U or L.\n> \n> If I go U to (6,6), what then?\n> \n> (6,6): from there, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But U to (6,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,5): but (6,5) was head, now after move, it would be body? After moving to (6,6), the new positions: head at (6,6), body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., and tail (2,2) removed if no food, but no food eaten yet.\n> \n> Since no food, tail is removed, so positions: [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail at (2,1) now?

All other moves lead to collisions or walls, and moving right is invalid due to the reverse rule.\n\n### Future Planning:\nAfter moving left to (4,5), the snake's positions will be:\n- Head: (4,5)\n- Body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] (tail at (3,1))\n\nFrom there, the snake can plan to reach the food at (1,2) by moving left/down in subsequent turns, as outlined in the Thinking Model's guidance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFor Turn 46, the only safe and valid move is **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 46. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So, these are all cells I can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the snake is 10 units long. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - At (1,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including this one, so it'll be gone by turn 54.\n> \n> - At (5,5) with value 1 and life span 10. But (5,5) is the head position? Snake positions start with (5,5) as head, and food is at (5,5). That means there's food under the head right now.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\" But in this case, the food is under the head, but the head is already on it? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> The food is listed as (5,5,10,1), and snake head is at (5,5). So at this moment, turn 46, the head is on the food. But for the food to be eaten, the body must move away first? No.\n> \n> Rule: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\" But if the head is already on it, and we move, the head moves away, so we don't eat it immediately. I think we need to have the head move onto the cell after the body has moved away.\n> \n> In this case, since the head is on (5,5) and food is there, but the snake is about to move. When the snake moves, the head will leave (5,5), and the body will follow, so if we move, the head leaves, and the body might still be there or not.\n> \n> Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), etc.\n> \n> If we move in a direction, say left, head goes to (4,5), then body: (6,5) becomes new head? No, the positions shift.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment, and the tail is removed unless we eat food.\n> \n> But we're not eating food yet; we're just moving.\n> \n> At turn 46, state is given, and we need to choose action for turn 46.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) is present, and head is at (5,5). But for eating to happen, it must be that after moving, the head is on food, and the cell was vacated or something? I'm confused.\n> \n> Rule: \"The head moves onto the food cell.\" But at turn 46, head is already on it, but we haven't moved yet. The eating happens during the move, I think.\n> \n> Let me read the core rules again.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, since the head is on it, but the body might be covering it? No, here the head is on (5,5), and the next segment is (6,5), so (5,5) is only occupied by head, not body.\n> \n> Positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ...] so (5,5) has head, (6,5) has body, etc. Food is at (5,5), so it's under the head.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when head moves onto a cell with food, it eats it and grows. But here, because it might be under body, there's a special rule.\n> \n> But for head, it should be eatable if head moves onto it, but head is already on it at start of turn.\n> \n> I think the eating check is after the move. Let's see the movement.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn, state is given. We choose a direction. Then we move: head moves to new position. If that new position has food, and it's not blocked, we eat it.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away first.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,5), since it's under head, and head is moving away, it won't be eaten this turn because head is leaving the cell.\n> \n> Similarly, for food under body, it can be eaten later if head comes back after body moves.\n> \n> So for turn 46, food at (5,5) is not eatable this turn because head is moving away from it, so we don't eat it now. It might be eatable later if we return.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (1,2) with life span 8.\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, so last move was left, so we cannot move right instantly, because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,5): since head is at (5,5), and we can move U, D, L, R, but need to check walls and body.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so grid from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's list all wall cells.\n> \n> Border: x=0 or x=7 for any y, y=0 or y=7 for any x. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7). But since it's grid, probably cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So all wall cells: any (0,y) for y=0 to 7, (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to 7, and (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> But (x,0) for x=0 to 7 includes corners, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (5,5), body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So the cells occupied by snake: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> For moving from (5,5), possible directions:\n> \n> - Up: (5,6)\n> \n> - Down: (5,4)\n> \n> - Left: (4,5)\n> \n> - Right: (6,5)\n> \n> Now check each:\n> \n> - Up (5,6): is it wall?

Not a wall, and not in snake positions? Snake positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So (4,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Right (6,5): (6,5) is the second segment, body, so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> Also, head direction is L, so last move was left, so we cannot move right (opposite) instantly.

It's turn 47, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,5), then body segments at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake is 10 segments long. The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (4,5) from (5,5) I assume, but since positions are head first, and direction is given, I think the direction is the current heading.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so from (4,5), if it moves left, it would go to (3,5). But let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> The tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 7? The format says (x,y, life_span, value), but it's written as (1,2,7,1), which might mean x=1,y=2, life_span=7, value=1. Similarly, (5,5,9,1) means x=5,y=5, life_span=9, value=1.\n> \n> Both foods have value 1, so both are positive food? Value is +1 for positive, -1 for negative. Here both are 1, so positive. But (5,5) is listed as food, but (5,5) is also a body segment of the snake. Specifically, it's the first body segment after the head.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (5,5), since it's currently occupied by the snake, I need to move the snake such that the body leaves (5,5), and later the head can come back to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is free, I think, since no snake is there.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

So the snake is mostly vertical on the right, with a bend.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), direction L, so last move was from (5,5) to (4,5), left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (4,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,6) - but y=6 is within bounds, not wall yet.\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,4) - but (4,4) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). Yes, (4,4) is an obstacle, so cannot move down to (4,4).\n> \n> - Left (L): (3,5) - possible, no wall or obstacle mentioned there.\n> \n> - Right (R): (5,5) - but (5,5) is occupied by the snake body. However, in snake games, moving into the tail is sometimes allowed if the tail moves, but here it's the immediate next segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – but for movement, it says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Also, collisions: body collision except if it's the tail and tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, (5,5) is not the tail; it's the first body segment. Tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) would be moving into a body segment that is not the tail, so it should cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body segment except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> But let's confirm the rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

It's turn 48, and I'm playing Snake on a grid where the walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So the head is at (3,5) and the tail is at (4,1). The snake's length is 10 segments.\n> \n> The head direction is \"L\", which means it's moving left. So from (3,5), it was moving left to get there.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 6. So it will disappear after 6 turns, including this one, so it has 5 more turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 48, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, including turn 48. After turn 48, life span becomes 5, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. But for eating, we care about when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear on turn t+L. So for this food at (1,2), at turn 48, life span 6, so it will be there until turn 53 (since 48+6-1=53), and disappear on turn 54.\n> \n> Similarly, another food at (5,5) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will be there until turn 55 (48+8-1=55), disappear on 56.\n> \n> But (5,5) is a food position, and looking at snake positions, (5,5) is part of the snake's body! Snake positions include (5,5) as the third segment. So the food is under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (5,5), since it's occupied by the snake, I can't eat it now. I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (5,5), and then later the head can come back to eat it, but only if the food is still there.\n> \n> Similarly, the food at (1,2) is not under the snake, so it's accessible.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. I should prioritize long-term survival and avoid risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), moving left. So from (3,5), possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> So for turn 48, from (3,5), possible moves: L, U, D.\n> \n> - L (left): to (2,5)\n> \n> - U (up): to (3,6)\n> \n> - D (down): to (3,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, inclusive? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, I think. The border cells are walls, so coordinates where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles also.\n> \n> So for (2,5): x=2, y=5, not border, and check obstacles: obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,5) is not in obstacles, so should be ok, but I need to see if it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So body segments: (4,5), (5,5), etc. (2,5) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> But when I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves, so the cell that was tail might be free, but for collision, head cannot touch body except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where tail was.\n> \n> Specifically, body collision: head touches any body segment except that if it touches the tail, and the tail moves away, it's ok. Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, after move, if head is on a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it dies. If it's on the tail, and tail moves, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (2,5): current snake body: (4,5), (5,5), etc. (2,5) is not occupied by any body part, so should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (3,6): y=6, not border, obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) is not (5,6), so ok? (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, (3,6) is x=3,y=6, different, so not obstacle. Is it occupied? Snake: positions have y=5,4,3,2,1, no y=6, so (3,6) free, safe.\n> \n> D to (3,4): y=4, not border. Obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4) are obstacles at y=4. (3,4) is not listed, so should be ok. Snake: no (3,4), body has (6,4), (5,4), but (3,4) not there, so free.\n> \n> (5,4) is a body segment, but (3,4) is different.\n> \n> So all three moves seem possible: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,2) and (5,5), but (5,5) is under body now.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) with value 1, life span 6, so available until turn 53.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) with value 1, life span 8, available until turn 55.\n> \n> Since (5,5) is under body, I need to move the snake away so that the body leaves (5,5), then I can eat it later.\n> \n> Currently, the snake has segments: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)\n> \n> Tail: (4,1)\n> \n> (5,5) is the third segment. When the snake moves, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away, so if I move, the segment at (5,5) will still be there for now, but when the snake moves, the body shifts.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So after one move, if I move to (2,5) for example, new head (2,5), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and tail (5,1) is removed? No: positions: new head (2,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes first body, then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and (5,1) is the tail, but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new tail is (5,2)?

Snake positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] — that's 10 positions, so segments 0 to 9: 0 head, 9 tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say (2,5), without eating, the new positions: head at (2,5), then segment 1 is now at (3,5) (previous head), segment 2 at (4,5), segment 3 at (5,5), segment 4 at (6,5), segment 5 at (6,4), segment 6 at (5,4), segment 7 at (5,3), segment 8 at (5,2), and segment 9 at (5,1) is no longer part of snake, so removed. So new tail is segment 8, which was (5,2) but now it's at (5,2)? Positions: new head (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — and (5,1) is gone. So (5,5) is still occupied by body.\n> \n> In fact, (5,5) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at index 2, but after move, it's still there. Specifically, the cell (5,5) was occupied by segment 2, and after move, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, which is (4,5)? No.\n> \n> After move: the head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So from positions: before move: seg0: (3,5), seg1: (4,5), seg2: (5,5), seg3: (6,5), seg4: (6,4), seg5: (5,4), seg6: (5,3), seg7: (5,2), seg8: (5,1), seg9: (4,1)\n> \n> After move to (2,5), no eat: new seg0: (2,5) new head\n> \n> Then new seg1: old seg0 position: (3,5)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 position: (4,5)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 position: (5,5)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 position: (6,5)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 position: (6,4)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 position: (5,4)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 position: (5,3)\n> \n> New seg8: old seg7 position: (5,2)\n> \n> New seg9: old seg8 position: (5,1) — but since no food, tail is not grown, so the last segment is removed, so we have only from seg0 to seg8, which are 9 positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> So (5,5) is still occupied by new seg3.\n> \n> The food at (5,5) is under the body, so to eat it, I need to move so that the body leaves (5,5), meaning that in some future move, when the snake moves, the segment at (5,5) moves away, and then (5,5) becomes empty, and then I can move the head there to eat the food.\n> \n> But the food has a life span, so I need to do it before it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 48 choices.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,1), head at (3,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,5) and (4,1) are not adjacent; |dx|=1, dy=4, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls on borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), tail (4,1)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and down, with a bend.\n> \n> From (6,5) to (6,4) down, then to (5,4) left, then down to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then left to (4,1).\n> \n> Head at (3,5) moving left.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) and (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied.\n> \n> (1,2) is at x=1,y=2, which is bottom-left area.\n> \n> Life span: (1,2) has life 6 at turn 48, so available turns 48,49,50,51,52,53. Disappears on turn 54.\n> \n> (5,5) has life 8, available turns 48 to 55.\n> \n> I should aim to eat the food at (1,2) since it's accessible and has shorter life.\n> \n> But I need to go to (1,2) from (3,5).\n> \n> Path to (1,2): from (3,5), I can go left to (2,5), then to (1,5), but (1,5) is not wall, but obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,5) is y=5, not y=4, so (1,5) should be free.\n> \n> Then from (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), but (1,4) is an obstacle! Obstacles include (1,4), so I cannot go to (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (1,5), I cannot go down to (1,4) because it's obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is also obstacle.\n> \n> So to reach (1,2), I need to go around.\n> \n> Possible path: from (3,5) to (2,5), then to (1,5), then I can go left? x=1, but x=0 is wall, so I can only go up, down, or right, but right is back, not good.\n> \n> From (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, L to (0,5) but x=0 wall, R to (2,5). So only U or R, or D but D is blocked.\n> \n> So from (1,5), I can only go up to (1,6) or right to (2,5).\n> \n> But to reach (1,2), I need to go down, but y=4 is blocked at x=1 and x=2.\n> \n> Obstacles at (1,4) and (2,4), so row y=4 has obstacles at x=1 and x=2, but other cells in y=4 might be free.\n> \n> For example, (3,4): is it free? Obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are obstacles, so (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is occupied by snake, but it will move.\n> \n> (6,4) is also snake.\n> \n> y=4: x=0 and x=7 walls, obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), and (6,4) is snake but moving.\n> \n> So free cells at y=4: (3,4), (5,4) but (5,4) is snake, (6,4) snake, (7,4) wall, (0,4) wall. So only (3,4) is free at y=4? x=3,4,5,6: (3,4) free, (4,4) obstacle, (5,4) snake, (6,4) snake, so indeed only (3,4) is free at y=4 for non-wall.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y=4: cells (0,4) wall, (1,4) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, (3,4) free, (4,4) obstacle, (5,4) snake, (6,4) snake, (7,4) wall. So only (3,4) is free.\n> \n> But (3,4) is free now.\n> \n> Similarly, y=3: (6,3) is obstacle, but others free except borders and snakes.\n> \n> To reach (1,2), I need to go to lower y.\n> \n> Since I can't go directly down from (1,5), I need to go to (3,4) or something.\n> \n> From current position (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), which is free.\n> \n> Then from (3,4), I can go left to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n> \n> Or right to (4,4), obstacle, or down to (3,3), or up to (3,5) but that's where I came from.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4) blocked, R to (4,4) blocked. So only U or D.\n> \n> U to (3,5) is back, D to (3,3).\n> \n> Then from (3,3), I can go to (2,3), (3,2), (4,3), etc., to reach (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> I can go from (3,5) to (3,4) down, then to (3,3) down, then to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (1,2).\n> \n> (3,2) to (2,2) to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, check if those cells are free.\n> \n> (3,4): free, as above.\n> \n> (3,3): is it free? y=3, obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed, snakes: body has (5,3), (5,2), etc., not (3,3), so (3,3) free.\n> \n> (3,2): similarly, free? Snakes have (5,2), but not (3,2), obstacles not, so free.\n> \n> (2,2): free? No obstacles or snakes.\n> \n> (1,2): food, free except food.\n> \n> So path exists: down to (3,4), down to (3,3), down to (3,2), left to (2,2), left to (1,2).\n> \n> That's 4 moves to reach (1,2) from (3,5): D, D, D, L, L but after first D to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then L to (2,2), then L to (1,2). So 5 moves to eat at (1,2).\n> \n> Start at turn 48, head at (3,5).\n> \n> Turn 48: move D to (3,4)\n> \n> Then turn 49: from (3,4) move D to (3,3)\n> \n> Turn 50: from (3,3) move D to (3,2)\n> \n> Turn 51: from (3,2) move L to (2,2)\n> \n> Turn 52: from (2,2) move L to (1,2) and eat food.\n> \n> Food available until turn 53, so turn 52 is within range.\n> \n> But on turn 52, when I move to (1,2), I eat it, so snake grows, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to consider the direction and no reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is L, but I move D first, which is down, not reverse of left, so ok.\n> \n> After moving D to (3,4), new head direction is D.\n> \n> Then move D to (3,3), still D.\n> \n> Then D to (3,2), still D.\n> \n> Then L to (2,2): from (3,2) to (2,2) is left, and previous direction was D, so moving left is not reverse; reverse of D is U, so L is ok.\n> \n> Then from (2,2) to (1,2) left, same direction.\n> \n> So that seems fine.\n> \n> But is there a risk? For example, when I go to (3,4), what about the body?\n> \n> After moving, the snake body changes.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Moreover, there is the food at (5,5) which I might want later.\n> \n> But (1,2) has shorter life, so I should prioritize it.\n> \n> After eating (1,2), I can think about (5,5).\n> \n> But let's confirm the moves.\n> \n> Turn 48: move D to (3,4)\n> \n> Then snake positions after turn 48: head to (3,4), body: previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), and tail (4,1) removed since no eat. New positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), tail (5,1)? Segments: new head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and since no eat, last segment (5,1) removed, so 9 segments: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> Tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Then turn 49: move D to (3,3)\n> \n> New head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), and (5,2) removed?

So segments: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) — 9 segments, tail (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is body, and there is an obstacle at (6,3), but (5,3) is not obstacle.\n> \n> Then turn 50: move D to (3,2)\n> \n> New head (3,2), body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) — tail (5,3) but removed, so new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) — 9 segments, tail (5,4)? Segments: seg0 (3,2), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (6,5), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (5,4)\n> \n> Tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Then turn 51: move L to (2,2)\n> \n> New head (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) — tail (5,4) removed, so positions: head (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — 9 segments, tail (6,4).\n> \n> Then turn 52: move L to (1,2) and eat food.\n> \n> New head (1,2), since food there, snake grows, so tail not removed. New positions: head (1,2), then previous positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), and add new segment at tail, so length 10, tail at (6,4)? After eating, head moves to (1,2), and body is the previous positions without removing tail, so positions: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, all seems fine, no collisions.\n> \n> But I need to think beyond, to turn 53 and more.\n> \n> After eating at (1,2), I am at (1,2), and I need to survive.\n> \n> Also, the food at (5,5) is still there until turn 55, and I might want to eat it later.\n> \n> But (5,5) is currently occupied by body, but as snake moves, it might free up.\n> \n> In the current path, when I go down to (3,4), etc., the body is moving, and (5,5) might be vacated.\n> \n> For example, after turn 48, positions include (5,5) still.\n> \n> After turn 49, (5,5) still there.\n> \n> After turn 50, (5,5) still.\n> \n> After turn 51, (5,5) still in positions.\n> \n> After turn 52, when I eat at (1,2), positions have (5,5) as part of body.\n> \n> So (5,5) is still occupied.\n> \n> To eat it, I need to move the snake so that the segment at (5,5) moves away.\n> \n> For instance, if I continue moving, eventually the body will shift.\n> \n> But since I ate food, the snake is longer, so it might take time to vacate (5,5).\n> \n> After turn 52, snake is at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied by segment 7, I think.\n> \n> To vacate (5,5), I need to move such that this segment moves to another position.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head, each body segment moves to the previous position.\n> \n> So if I move from (1,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R?

Head is at (3,4) and direction is D, which is down, meaning moving towards decreasing y. So from (3,5) to (3,4), since direction is D, and positions are head first, so head moved to (3,4) from (3,5) I assume? Let me list the positions in order: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (3,5), index 2: (4,5), index 3: (5,5), index 4: (6,5), index 5: (6,4), index 6: (5,4), index 7: (5,3), index 8: (5,2), index 9: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> Direction is D, so the snake was moving down to (3,4). From turn 48, head was at (3,5), moved down to (3,4) on turn 49? But turn 49 is the current turn, so positions are for the start of turn 49, I think.

Similarly, (5,5) life span 7, gone at turn 56; (4,2) life span 10, gone at turn 59.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turns 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, and beyond, but at least 5 turns ahead, so up to turn 54 or so.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4), direction D (down).

But I cannot move opposite to current direction, which is D, so I cannot move U (up) immediately because that would be reverse. So possible moves: D, L, R. But D would be down to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, grid borders: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> (3,3) is not in any of these, so it should be free. But is it occupied by body? Body positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So (5,3) is there, but (3,3) is not, so (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (2,4): (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), etc. (2,4) is listed, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Move R to (4,4): (4,4) is also an internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> Move U: but cannot, because reverse direction, current direction D, U is opposite.\n> \n> So from (3,4), only possible move is D to (3,3).

Body: current positions, but after move, the snake will have moved, so body positions change.\n> \n> For collision check at the time of move.\n> \n> At turn 50, before move, snake positions: after turn 49 move to (3,3), so head is (3,3), then body: the previous head was (3,4), now it becomes the neck, so positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and tail (5,1) will be gone if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> When no food eaten, the snake moves, head to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (3,3) on turn 49:\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segments: the old body from index 1 to 9, but shifted: segment 1 (old (3,5)) moves to the position of segment 0, which was (3,4)?

So no issue now.\n> \n> But I need to be careful if tail has food and head is near.\n> \n> Now, let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, since (1,2) has short life span, only 4 turns left, I might want to go for it if possible, but it's at (1,2), which is far? From (3,3) to (1,2): I need to go left and down.\n> \n> Shortest path: left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2). But (1,3) might have walls or something? Internal obstacles include (1,4), but (1,3) should be free? Walls are (1,4), which is at y=4, so (1,3) is not a wall, I think. Only the specified walls.\n> \n> Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3).\n> \n> So (1,3) is not a wall, should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) and (1,2) are free.\n> \n> But (1,2) has food.\n> \n> Also, when I move to (1,2), if I eat food, snake grows, so length increases.\n> \n> But first, I need to get there.\n> \n> From (3,3), I can go left to (2,3) or down to (3,2) or right to (4,3).\n> \n> If I go left to (2,3), that might be towards (1,2).\n> \n> But (1,2) life span 4, so if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n> \n> Turn 50: if I move left to (2,3), then on turn 51, from (2,3), I can move left to (1,3), then on turn 52, move down to (1,2) to eat the food, assuming it's still there.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 50, life span 4, meaning it can be eaten on turns 50,51,52,53, and disappears after that, so by turn 54 it's gone.\n> \n> If I move on turn 50 to (2,3), not eating yet.\n> \n> Turn 51 to (1,3), still not eating.\n> \n> Turn 52 to (1,2), then I eat the food, so on turn 52, I consume it.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 50, it has life span 4, so after turn 50, it has 3 left; after turn 51, 2 left; after turn 52, 1 left; but when I move to it on turn 52, I eat it before it disappears, I think. The life span decreases at the end of the turn or beginning?\n> \n> The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 during the turn, and if it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of the turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if I move onto it during a turn, I eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: on turn when life span is 1, I can still eat it that turn, and it disappears after.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> For (1,2), life span 4 at turn 50, so:\n> \n> - Turn 50: can be eaten, after eating or not, life span becomes 3 for next turn.\n> \n> After action, life span decreases.\n> \n> I think it's: at the beginning of the turn, before action, the food has remaining life span. When you move, if you move onto it, you eat it. Then, at the end of the turn, all food life spans decrease by 1, and if any reaches 0, it is removed.\n> \n> So for (1,2) at turn 50: remaining life = 4, can be eaten. After turn 50, if not eaten, life=3; turn 51, if not eaten, life=2; turn 52, life=1; turn 53, life=0, eaten or removed after turn.\n> \n> On turn 53, if life=1, I can still eat it, and it will be removed after that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t + N -1 or something? Life span N means it lasts for N turns starting from the turn it appears.\n> \n> But here, at turn 50, it has life span 4, so it will be present for 4 more turns: turns 50,51,52,53. On turn 54, it is gone.\n> \n> I can eat it on turns 50,51,52,53.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Back to (1,2): I can eat it by turn 53.\n> \n> If I go directly, from (3,3) to (1,2) in two moves: but not adjacent, so minimum two moves.\n> \n> From (3,3), move left to (2,3) on turn 50.\n> \n> Then on turn 51, move left to (1,3)? (1,3) to (1,2) is down, but (1,2) is at y=2, x=1.\n> \n> From (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) on turn 52, as I said.\n> \n> But on turn 51, from (2,3), I could move down to (2,2), then left to (1,2) on turn 52, but that might be longer.\n> \n> From (2,3), moving down to (2,2) might not be efficient if (2,2) is free, but I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> But let's not complicate; the direct way is fine.\n> \n> But I have other foods to consider.\n> \n> Also, (5,5) has food under the body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied by snake, segment 5.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the snake to move so that (5,5) is vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> But when head moves there, if it's free, I eat and grow.\n> \n> But currently, the body is on it.\n> \n> The snake will move, so segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a way that the segment at (5,5) moves away.\n> \n> But it's part of the body.\n> \n> Let me list the snake positions: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: tail (5,2)\n> \n> So (5,5) is segment 4.\n> \n> When the snake moves, depending on the move, the body moves.\n> \n> But to vacate (5,5), I need the snake to move such that the segment that was at (5,5) moves to another cell.\n> \n> For example, if I move down from (3,3) to (3,2), then new head (3,2), then body: (3,3) from old head, (3,4) from segment 1, (3,5) from seg2, (4,5) from seg3, (5,5) from seg4, but seg4 was at (5,5), and since no growth, it stays? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving down to (3,2):\n> \n> - New head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old seg3 (4,5)  // which was at (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old seg4 (5,5)  // (5,5) is now occupied by seg5?

The head direction is L, meaning it's moving left, so from (2,3) it came from the right, probably from (3,3) but (3,3) is the first body segment. Since head is at (2,3) and direction is L, it was previously at (3,3) and moved left to (2,3) at turn 50 or something.

But (5,5) has a food with value 1 and life span 5, but (5,5) is also occupied by the snake's segment 5. Segment 5 is (5,5), so there's food under it?

Life span is the number of turns it remains, including current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So if at turn t, life_span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t + L - 1, it might be gone? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think it means that at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, during turn t, it has L, then at the end of turn t, life_span decreases to L-1 for turn t+1. So it will disappear when life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now it's gone. So for food at turn t with life_span N, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". I think it's better to think: at turn t, life_span N means it has N turns left, including the current turn. So after N turns, it will be gone. For example, at turn t, N=1: it is present during turn t, and disappears before turn t+1. At turn t, N=2: present during turn t and t+1, disappears before turn t+2.\n> \n> Similarly, here at turn 51:\n> \n> - Food at (1,2): life_span 3, so present at turns 51, 52, 53; disappears before turn 54.\n> \n> - Food at (5,5): life_span 5, present at turns 51 to 55; disappears before turn 56.\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): life_span 8, present at turns 51 to 58; disappears before turn 59.\n> \n> Also, all have value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,3), direction L (left), so it can move U, D, L, R but with no instant reverse. Since it's moving left, it cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn. So possible moves from (2,3): Up to (2,4), Down to (2,2), Left to (1,3), but not Right to (3,3) because that would be reverse.\n> \n> (3,3) is occupied by the body, but moving right to (3,3) might cause collision? Let's see the rules.\n> \n> Movement: I can choose to move to adjacent cell, but if that cell has a body segment, it might collide, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, walls: border and obstacles must be avoided.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so borders are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: all border cells and these internal points.\n> \n> Now, snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,3)\n> \n> Body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3)\n> \n> Food at (1,2), (5,5), (4,2)\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied by snake body segment 5, so food is under it, but can only be eaten if snake moves away and head comes back later.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is free, I think; let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> (4,2) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> (1,2) is free.\n> \n> Now, at turn 51, head at (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (2,4) – but (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: to (2,2) – is (2,2) a wall? x=2, y=2; borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (2,2) is inside, not border wall. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,2) is not listed, so should be free. Also, not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc., no (2,2), so (2,2) should be free and safe to move, unless it's a wall, but not.\n> \n> - Left: to (1,3) – (1,3) is not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no (1,3), so free.\n> \n> - Right: to (3,3) – but (3,3) is the first body segment. Also, cannot move right because it's reverse direction? Direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, so not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" So from direction L, cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible moves: Up, Down, Left.\n> \n> But Up to (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n> \n> Down to (2,2) or Left to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food available: (1,2), (5,5), (4,2)\n> \n> (1,2) is close to (2,3); if I move down to (2,2), then from there I can go to (1,2) or (2,1) or (3,2), etc.\n> \n> If I move left to (1,3), then from there I can go to (1,2) down, or (1,4) but (1,4) is obstacle, or (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so not possible, or (2,3) but that's where I came from, occupied now but will move.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions for turn 51.\n> \n> Action: Down to (2,2) or Left to (1,3)\n> \n> Now, need to consider risks and opportunities.\n> \n> First, let's think about the food at (1,2).

Length still 10? No, when not eating, tail is removed, so length decreases? No.\n> \n> Rule: when you move without eating, the tail moves, so the snake length stays the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the last segment (tail) is removed from the grid.\n> \n> So the snake has the same number of segments, but occupies new cells.\n> \n> In this case, from positions: head (2,3), segments S1 to S9.\n> \n> After move down: head to (2,2), S1 to (2,3) (previous head), S2 to (3,3) (previous S1), S3 to (3,4) (previous S2), S4 to (3,5) (previous S3), S5 to (4,5) (previous S4), S6 to (5,5) (previous S5), S7 to (6,5) (previous S6), S8 to (6,4) (previous S7), S9 to (5,4) (previous S8), and the previous S9 (5,3) is no longer part of snake, vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]\n> \n> Length still 10 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (1,3):\n> \n> New head at (1,3), body: (1,3) is head, then (2,3) as first body, (3,3), (3,4), ..., up to (6,4), and (5,4) becomes the last, previous (5,3) vacated.\n> \n> Positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]\n> \n> Now, back to choices for turn 51: Down to (2,2) or Left to (1,3)\n> \n> If I go to (2,2), I can then go to (1,2) to eat the food, since (1,2) has food with short life.\n> \n> (1,2) is down from (2,2), so from (2,2), I can move down to (1,2)?

Let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,4)  // this is the tail, I assume.\n> \n> Snake has 10 segments? Positions list has 10 elements: indices 0 to 9, head at index 0.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left. So current direction is left, meaning the snake was moving left to reach (1,3) from previous position. Since head is at (1,3) and direction is L, it came from (2,3) or something? Positions: from (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3), etc. Since head is at (1,3) and next is (2,3), and direction is L, that means it was moving left to (1,3), so from (2,3) to (1,3), so previous move was left.\n> \n> Now, food positions with value and life span:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All foods have value +1, since value is 1, and it's positive food. No negative food mentioned, all are +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 52, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 53? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0? Or after N turns from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N more turns, it will be gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N, it will be present at turn t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N? Let's see the countdown.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn t, if life_span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The description says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> But in the context, for food at (1,2) with life_span 2 at turn 52, it means:\n> \n> - At turn 52: life_span 2\n> \n> - After turn 52, life_span decreases to 1 (for turn 53)\n> \n> - After turn 53, life_span decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn 54 or after turn 53? I think it disappears at the end of turn 53, so not available on turn 54.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life_span 4 at turn 52, so it will be available for turns 52,53,54,55, disappear after turn 55.\n> \n> (4,2) life_span 7: turns 52 to 58, disappear after turn 58.\n> \n> (2,1) life_span 10: turns 52 to 61, disappear after turn 61.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,5): but snake is at (5,5) in its body? Snake positions include (5,5) as segment 6? Let's list snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (1,3) head\n> \n> 1: (2,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (4,5)\n> \n> 6: (5,5)\n> \n> 7: (6,5)\n> \n> 8: (6,4)\n> \n> 9: (5,4) tail\n> \n> So (5,5) is occupied by the snake body, segment 6.\n> \n> But food is at (5,5) with value 1, life_span 4.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (5,5) has food, but it's under the snake body, so to eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body leaves (5,5), and then head moves to it when it's empty.\n> \n> But since the snake is moving, it might be possible.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (1,2), (4,2), (2,1) are not occupied by snake, I think.\n> \n> (1,2): is it occupied? Snake has (1,3), (2,3), etc., not (1,2), so free.\n> \n> (4,2): not in snake positions.\n> \n> (2,1): not in snake positions.\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied.\n> \n> Now, head at (1,3), direction L (left). So possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R because reverse is not allowed instantly? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right on next turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: left (L), up (U), down (D), but not right (R).\n> \n> Now, from (1,3), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Up: (1,4) but is it free? y=4, x=1.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (1,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So (1,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) – now, (1,2) has food? Food at (1,2), and it's not wall, not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (1,3), (2,3), etc., no (1,2), so it should be free.\n> \n> But is (1,2) within bounds? x=1, y=2, and walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=2 is between 1 and 6, so playable, and no internal obstacle there, so (1,2) is free and has food.\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) but (2,3) is the next body segment, so moving right would hit the body, but rule: head touches body segment, except that you can move into tail if tail moves.\n> \n> Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail segment and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (1,3), moving right to (2,3): (2,3) is the first body segment after head, not the tail. Tail is at (5,4). So (2,3) is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (2,3) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Therefore, cannot move right.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left to (0,3) wall, cannot move up to (1,4) wall, so only possible move is down to (1,2).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,3):\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) - body segment, collision, invalid unless tail, but not tail.\n> \n> - Up: (1,4) - internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) - free, has food? And not wall or body.\n> \n> So only down is possible? That seems dangerous if I have to go there.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (6,3) is internal obstacle? But y=3, x=6.\n> \n> Now, (1,2): x=1,y=2, not in obstacles, not wall border, so free.\n> \n> Snake positions: all listed, no (1,2), so free.\n> \n> So from (1,3), only possible move is down to (1,2).\n> \n> But is that safe? Moving to (1,2) would eat the food there, since it's positive food, snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes longer.\n> \n> Current length: 10 segments.\n> \n> After eating, length 11.\n> \n> Now, position after move: head at (1,2), body: since it ate, the tail stays, so positions: new head (1,2), then previous head (1,3) becomes part of body, so body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), ..., up to tail (5,4).\n> \n> Let's list new positions if move down to (1,2):\n> \n> - New head: (1,2)\n> \n> - Then body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)  // since tail doesn't move after eating, so 11 segments.\n> \n> But (5,5) has food under it? But the snake is there, so the food is not accessible until the body moves away.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (1,2), what next? I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, head direction after move: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 52, only down seems possible? Is that right?\n> \n> What about other directions? I thought only down is valid.\n> \n> But let's double-check.\n> \n> From (1,3):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,3) - x=0 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,3) - occupied by body segment (index 1), not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,4) - internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (1,2) - free, no wall, no body, so valid.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible action at turn 52 is D, down to (1,2).\n> \n> But the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> If I go to (1,2), I eat the food, grow to 11, but then I might be trapped.\n> \n> After moving to (1,2), the head is at (1,2), and the body is at (1,3), (2,3), etc.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,2) at turn 53.\n> \n> First, direction is D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down: (1,1) - is it free? y=1, x=1.\n> \n> y=1 is not border wall, since borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: none at (1,1), so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: after move, head at (1,2), body at (1,3), (2,3), etc. No (1,1), so free.\n> \n> - Left: (0,2) - x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,2) - is it free? x=2,y=2.\n> \n> Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), etc., not (2,2).\n> \n> Snake: has (2,3), but not (2,2), so free.\n> \n> - Up: (1,3) - but (1,3) is now the first body segment, since after moving to (1,2), (1,3) is body. So moving up to (1,3) would be collision with body segment, not tail, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, current direction is D, so moving up would be reverse, which is not allowed instantly? Reverse: down to up is opposite, so cannot move up if current direction is down.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction after turn 52 is D (down), so at turn 53, I cannot move up (U), because it's opposite to D.\n> \n> So possible moves from (1,2):\n> \n> - Down to (1,1)\n> \n> - Right to (2,2)\n> \n> - Left invalid (wall)\n> \n> - Up invalid (reverse and body collision)\n> \n> So I can go down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n> \n> (1,1) has no food, I think.

(1,2) to (5,5) is |5-1| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7 cells, so at least 7 moves, but with obstacles, more, so impossible to reach by turn 55.

        "thinking": "Let's break down the current state and possible actions step-by-step to determine the best immediate move for the snake at Turn \\( t_0 = 53 \\).\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (1, 2), body segments follow in order: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)] (tail at (5, 4)).\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5, 5): Value +1, Life Span 3 (disappears after Turn 55).\n  - (4, 2): Value +1, Life Span 6 (disappears after Turn 58).\n  - (2, 1): Value +1, Life Span 9 (disappears after Turn 61).\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 4), (2, 4), (6, 3)].\n\n### Possible Moves from (1, 2) (Direction = D):\n1. **Down (D) to (1, 1)**:\n   - (1, 1) is not a wall or occupied by the snake. Valid move.\n2. **Left (L) to (0, 2)**:\n   - (0, 2) is a border wall. Invalid move.\n3. **Right (R) to (2, 2)**:\n   - (2, 2) is not a wall or occupied by the snake. Valid move.\n4. **Up (U)**:\n   - Reverse direction (from Down to Up). Invalid (no instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves:\n#### Option 1: Down to (1, 1)\n- Next turn (Turn 54), the snake must move from (1, 1):\n  - Possible moves: Right to (2, 1) (food at (2, 1)) or Up to (1, 2) (body collision). Only valid move is Right to (2, 1).\n- Eating (2, 1) on Turn 54 is safe (no tail reward danger).\n- After eating, the snake grows, and the next moves can aim for (4, 2).\n\n#### Option 2: Right to (2, 2)\n- Next turn (Turn 54), the snake can move:\n  - Down to (2, 1) (eat food at (2, 1)).\n  - Right to (3, 2) (no food, but can later reach (4, 2)).\n- Choosing Down to (2, 1) is similar to Option 1.\n- Choosing Right to (3, 2) delays eating (2, 1) but allows reaching (4, 2) sooner.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (2, 1) is safe to eat and has a long life span. It is better to eat it now to grow the snake and then plan for (4, 2).\n- Moving Down to (1, 1) forces the snake to eat (2, 1) on the next turn, which is a straightforward and safe path.\n- Moving Right to (2, 2) offers flexibility but risks delaying the safe eat of (2, 1).\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe safest and most straightforward action is to move **Down (D)** to (1, 1), setting up to eat (2, 1) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, and similarly for y. Walls include borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles are given as points: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is Down, which means it's moving downwards. Since the head is at (1,2) and direction is D, last move was down to (1,2), I assume.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 3. But (5,5) is occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: For (5,5), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn. So on turn 53, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 55? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current. So on turn 53, life span 3, after turn 53 it becomes 2, after 54 it becomes 1, after 55 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 53, 54, or 55, but since it's under the snake, it might not be accessible immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 6, disappears after turn 58.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 9, disappears after turn 61.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 58 or so.\n> \n> Current turn is 53.\n> \n> Snake head at (1,2), direction Down. So from (1,2), possible moves: Down would be to (1,1), but y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is within bounds? Grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

I can go Down, Left, or Right.\n> \n> Now, from (1,2):\n> \n> - Down: to (1,1). Is (1,1) a wall? y=1 is not y=0, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,4) is at y=4, not (1,1). So (1,1) should be free? But let's confirm: walls are borders and the listed internal points.\n> \n> (1,1): x=1, y=1, not border, not in internal obstacles list: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — none of these are (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake?

No, when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed only if no food is eaten.

No, each cell has one segment.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves off old cell.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, tail does not move, so the cell that was tail remains occupied, and length increases.\n> \n> So the positions: after eating, the head is at new cell, the body includes all previous positions except that the tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at that position?

Positions: index 0: head (2,1) after move, but after turn 54, positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> So (5,5) is the 10th segment, body part.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) with life span 2 on turn 54.\n> \n> But (5,5) is occupied by snake body, so I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, on turn 54, it's under body, so not eatable unless body moves.\n> \n> Life span: after turn 54, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> After turn 55, if not eaten, disappears.\n> \n> To eat (5,5), I need to have head move to (5,5) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (5,5) is occupied, so the snake must move such that the segment at (5,5) moves away.\n> \n> The segment at (5,5) will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> On turn 54, when I move head to (2,1), the body segments shift: the segment at (1,1) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> When head moves to (2,1), since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the body segments: the first body segment becomes (1,1), which was previous head, then (1,2) remains, etc., all stay, and tail (6,4) stays, since growth.\n> \n> Positions after turn 54: head at (2,1), then body segments: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — 11 body segments, but since I ate, length 12, so positions: head (2,1), body: [ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) ] — that's 11 segments after head? Let's count: head + 11 body = 12 segments.\n> \n> The segment at (5,5) is still there.\n> \n> After turn 55, when I move the head, the body will shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move from (2,1) on turn 55.\n> \n> Say I move D to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> Then, if I move to (2,2), no food, so tail moves: the last segment (6,4) is removed, head to (2,2), then body shifts: (2,1) becomes first body, (1,1) second, (1,2) third, ..., up to (6,5) becomes new tail or something.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So after turn 55, if head moves to (2,2):\n> \n> - Head to (2,2)\n> \n> - Then segment that was at (1,1) moves to (2,1) — but (2,1) was head, so the first body segment moves to previous head position (2,1)\n> \n> Let's sequence:\n> \n> Before turn 55: positions: head (2,1), body segments: pos1: (1,1), pos2: (1,2), pos3: (1,3), pos4: (2,3), pos5: (3,3), pos6: (3,4), pos7: (3,5), pos8: (4,5), pos9: (5,5), pos10: (6,5), pos11: (6,4)\n> \n> When head moves to (2,2), and if no food eaten, then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 moves to previous pos1 (1,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 3 moves to previous pos2 (1,2)\n> \n> - ...\n> - Body segment 10 moves to previous pos9 (5,5)?

Previous index9 position is (5,5), so body index 10 moves to that, so (5,5) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment that was at (6,5) moves to (5,5), so (5,5) is now occupied, but it was previously occupied by index9, which moved to (4,5) or something.\n> \n> In this case, after move, (5,5) has a body segment: body index 10 at (5,5)\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved to (3,1) instead.\n> \n> But for food at (5,5), it is under body, so to eat it, I need the body to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> But in this case, on turn 55, (5,5) is occupied, and after move, if I don't move head there, it might still be occupied or not.\n> \n> But life span: on turn 54, food (5,5) life span 2, after turn 54, it decreases to 1, so on turn 55, life span 1, and after turn 55, it decreases to 0 and disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> To eat it, I must move head to (5,5) on turn 55.\n> \n> But on turn 55, head is at (2,1), and (5,5) is far away, I can't reach it in one move. Distance is |2-5| + |1-5| = 3+4=7, so impossible to reach in one move. So I cannot eat it on turn 55. Therefore, it will disappear after turn 55.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 54, I didn't move towards it, so it's gone.\n> \n> So food at (5,5) will not be eaten; it disappears.\n> \n> Now, other food: (4,2) with life span 5 on turn 54.\n> \n> After turn 54, life span 4 (on turn 55), then 3 on 56, 2 on 57, 1 on 58, 0 on 59, disappears after turn 59 if not eaten.\n> \n> I can plan to eat that.\n> \n> Also, no other food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 55 choices.\n> \n> Head at (2,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,1).

It's turn 55, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3). I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), and the body segments follow: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So the tail is at (6,4). Snake head direction is R, which is right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 1. But life span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 55, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn. So if we don't eat it this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 4. Value is 1, so positive food.\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 10. Also positive food.\n> \n> All food here is positive, value 1 each. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,1), moving right (R). From here, possible moves: U, D, L, R. But since current direction is R, I cannot move left (L) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So possible moves are U, D, R. L is opposite to R, so not allowed.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,1). Moving:\n> \n> - U: (2,2)\n> \n> - D: (2,0) but y=0 is a wall, so not possible. Walls are y=0, so (2,0) is out of bounds.\n> \n> - R: (3,1)\n> \n> - L: (1,1) but (1,1) is the second segment of the snake, but let's see what happens when moving.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), etc. If I move left to (1,1), that's where the body is. But when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so if I move to (1,1), which is currently occupied by the body, but after the move, since the tail moves, it might be okay if it's the tail cell, but here (1,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,4). So moving to (1,1) would cause a collision because it's a body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> General rule: head cannot touch any body segment except possibly the tail, but only if moving into the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away. But in this case, (1,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving to (1,1) would mean head collides with body, game over.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: (2,0) is y=0, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,2) – is this free? Let's see what's at (2,2). Snake positions: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), etc. (2,2) is not in the snake body? List all snake positions: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]. So (2,2) is not occupied. Also not a wall. Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,2) is none of these. So (2,2) should be free.\n> \n> - D: to (2,0) – y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (3,1) – (3,1) not in snake positions? Snake has (3,3), (3,4), etc., but (3,1) is not listed. Positions start from (2,1) to (6,4), so (3,1) should be free. Not a wall or obstacle. Obstacles are at (5,6), etc., not (3,1). So (3,1) is free.\n> \n> - L: to (1,1) – but (1,1) is the second segment, so collision. Invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves from current position: U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> First, let's look at the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,5): value 1, life span 1. Since life span 1 at turn 55, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if we don't eat it now, it's gone. But can we eat it now?\n> \n> Snake head is at (2,1), food at (5,5). That's 3 steps away in x and 4 in y, so not adjacent, can't eat it this turn. Distance: |5-2|=3, |5-1|=4, so min moves is max(3,4)=4, I think, since diagonal not allowed, so at least 4 moves to reach (5,5) from (2,1). But life span 1, so it disappears after turn 55, meaning we can't eat it at all. So this food is not accessible; we should ignore it.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So at turn 55, life span 1 means it will disappear at the end of turn 55, before turn 56. So we can only eat it during turn 55 if head is on (5,5) during this turn. But head is at (2,1), not on (5,5), so we can't eat it. So (5,5) food is gone; no point considering.\n> \n> Next food: (4,2) value 1, life span 4. At turn 55, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 58? Countdown: at turn 55, life span 4, after turn 55 it becomes 3, then turn 56 it becomes 2, turn 57 it becomes 1, turn 58 it becomes 0 and disappears after turn 58. So we have until turn 58 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) value 1, life span 10, so disappears after turn 64? Turn 55 life 10, after turn 55: 9, ..., after turn 64: 0, disappear.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, the food at (5,5) is on a snake body? Snake positions include (5,5), which is the 10th segment? List: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (1,1), 2: (1,2), 3: (1,3), 4: (2,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,4) tail.\n> \n> So (5,5) is position of segment 9, which is body. Food at (5,5) is under the body, but we can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves onto it. But since life span 1 and we can't reach it this turn, it's irrelevant. Also, for future, but it's disappearing.\n> \n> Now, the other foods: (4,2) and (4,6).\n> \n> (4,2) is at y=2, x=4. (4,6) at y=6, x=4.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,1).\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,2), new head position (2,2). Then the snake will be: head (2,2), then the old head (2,1) becomes body, so body at (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), etc., and tail moves to (5,5)? After move, the tail moves forward, so the segment at (6,4) is removed, and a new segment added at head if food eaten, but no food eaten yet.\n> \n> When moving without eating, head moves to new position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving U to (2,2): new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Tail was (6,4), but since no growth, tail is removed, so the last segment (6,5) becomes the new tail? Positions: originally 12 segments. After move: head moves to (2,2), then the previous head (2,1) becomes first body, then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), and the last one (6,5) is included, but since tail moves, we remove the last segment, which was (6,4), so the body from (6,5) to (5,5) etc. but (6,5) is the 10th position? Original list: indices 0 to 11: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2) without eating, the new body is: head at (2,2), then segments from old head to second last: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). The tail (6,4) is removed, so we have 11 segments now. Positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. (6,5) was the 10th segment, now it's included, and (6,4) removed.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (3,1): head to (3,1), then body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Tail (6,4) removed, so positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].\n> \n> Now, from (2,2) or (3,1), I need to reach the foods.\n> \n> Food at (4,2): life span 4, so must eat by turn 58.\n> \n> From (2,1) to (4,2): |4-2|=2 in x, |2-1|=1 in y, so min 2 moves, but not directly since we move one step at a time.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is farther.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger mentioned: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,4), and food is at (4,2) and (4,6), not on tail, so no issue for now.\n> \n> First, let's see the path to (4,2).\n> \n> From current (2,1), to (4,2): one way is go right to (3,1), then to (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,2) directly if possible, but (4,2) is not adjacent to (3,1)? (3,1) to (4,2) is diagonal, not adjacent, so need two steps, e.g., (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) or (3,1) to (3,2) to (4,2), etc.\n> \n> Similarly from (2,2).\n> \n> But we have obstacles.\n> \n> List obstacles: internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Also walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, to reach (4,2), which is at (4,2).\n> \n> Current position: (2,1)\n> \n> If I move R to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), or R to (4,1), or D but (3,0) wall, or L but reverse not allowed if I just moved R, but current direction after move to (3,1) would be R, so I can move U, D, R, not L.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (2,2), from (2,2) I can go U to (2,3), but (2,3) is snake body? Current snake has (2,3) as segment 4, but after move, if I go to (2,2), positions: as above, (2,2) head, (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), etc. so (2,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move to (2,3) because collision.\n> \n> From (2,2), after moving U to (2,2), head at (2,2), direction U?

After moving to (2,2) with U, new direction is U, so moving D would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> - L to (1,2): (1,2) is occupied? Positions: (1,2) is the fourth segment? After move: indices: 0: (2,2), 1: (2,1), 2: (1,1), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,3), 5: (2,3), etc. so (1,2) is segment 3, occupied, so moving to (1,2) collision.\n> \n> - R to (3,2): (3,2) not occupied? Snake has (3,3), but (3,2) not in positions. Also not wall or obstacle. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,2) is clear.

The tail (4,5) is still there, and since we ate, we add a new segment at head, so the snake grows, positions now 12 segments: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2), L to (3,2) but reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> (4,3): is it free?

In the positions, after eating, (5,5) is not in the list; we have up to (4,5) as tail.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n>

Then turn 57: move R to (4,2) and eat.\n> \n> Same as above, head at (4,2), direction R, positions similar.\n> \n> After eating: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) — 12 segments.\n> \n> (4,5) is tail.\n> \n> Same as before, essentially.\n> \n> Now, from here, to reach (4,6), we need to go around the obstacle at (4,4).\n> \n> One way is to go right to (5,2), then up to (5,3), but (5,3) is free, then to (5,4), (5,5), then to (4,5) or (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so to (4,5) but (4,5) is tail, but we can move to tail if it moves.\n> \n> (4,5) is tail, so if we move to (4,5), since the tail moves, it might be safe, but only if we don't eat, because if we eat, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide when growing.\n> \n> The danger is when eating food on tail cell, but here we are moving to tail cell without eating.\n> \n> For movement, moving to tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But for eating, if food is on tail and we eat it, then head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, (4,5) has no food, so moving to (4,5) is safe.\n> \n> From (4,2), we can go U to (4,3), but as before,

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).

Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 57, if not eaten, it will be there for 3 more turns?

Since countdown decreases each turn, including the current one, so on turn t, life span is L, then turn t+1 it's L-1, ..., down to 0, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before next turn? I need to be precise for planning.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if countdown decreases each turn, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0.

Since it decreases every turn including current, after turn 57 action, life span might decrease.\n> \n> The state is given at turn 57, before the move. So at the start of turn 57, food has life span as given. After I move, and if I eat, it's consumed; else, life span decreases by 1 at the end of the turn or something.\n> \n> But for planning, I should assume that for each turn, after the action, life span decreases.\n> \n> To simplify, since I need to think about when it disappears, for (4,2) with life span 3 at turn 57, it will be available until turn 59 (since after turn 59, it disappears before turn 60). Let's say:\n> - After turn 57: if not eaten, life span becomes 2\n> - After turn 58: life span 1\n> - After turn 59: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) with life span 8: available for 8 turns from now, until after turn 64 or so.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (4,1), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).

But food can be under body, but in this case, (4,2) is not under body, it's empty except for food.\n> \n> Food positions are given, and (4,2) has food, so the cell has food, but no snake body there.\n> \n> Moving to (4,2): if I move U, I go to (4,2), which has food, so I eat it, length increases, score +1.\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> After moving, the head is at (4,2), and the tail will move, so body segments shift.\n> \n> Current snake: positions from head to tail: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), new head is (4,2), and since I eat food, length increases, so the tail doesn't move?

Standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: before move, head at (4,1). After moving to (4,2) and eating, the new head is (4,2), and the body includes the previous head (4,1) as the new second segment, and the tail remains until the end, but since we grow, the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start, snake positions: S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H is head.\n> \n> After moving to a new cell C:\n> - If C has food, then new snake: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  // head moves to C, previous head becomes first body, and tail stays, so length +1\n> - If no food, new snake: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}]  // tail T is removed, so positions shift.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,2) which has food, so after move:\n> - New head: (4,2)\n> - Then previous head (4,1) becomes second segment\n> - Then (3,1) becomes third, and so on, up to (5,5) is still there, but since we grow, the tail (5,5) doesn't move, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> New positions: head at (4,2), then (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — so 13 segments.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? Check if (4,2) is a wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: (4,2) — x=4, y=2, not border (borders x=0,7 y=0,7), not internal obstacles: internal are (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3), so (4,2) is clear.\n> \n> Body: before move, (4,2) not occupied, after move, head is at (4,2), and body segments are behind, so no collision with body at (4,2).\n> \n> But tail is at (5,5), far away.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,5), head at (4,1), not adjacent. After move to (4,2), head at (4,2), tail at (5,5), not adjacent, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving U to (4,2) seems safe and I eat food immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there is another food at (4,6) with longer life span.\n> \n> If I eat (4,2) now, I get +1, but what about future?\n> \n> After eating, I'm at (4,2), and direction would be U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Then possible next moves.\n> \n> But let's consider the other option: move R to (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is empty?

After removal, the tail was (5,5), which is removed, so the segment before that is (4,5), which becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Positions: 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (1,1), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,5), 11: (4,5) — 12 segments? No: originally 12 segments, after move without eating, length remains 12, but tail moves.\n> \n> Original: 12 positions. After move: head to new position, so new list has the new head, then all except the tail. So 11 positions? No.\n> \n> Standard: if no eat, snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of list: new head position, followed by all positions except the last one.\n> \n> So for 12 segments, after moving to new cell without eating, new snake has 11 segments: [new_head, pos0, pos1, ..., pos10] where pos0 was head, now second, pos1 to pos10, and pos11 (tail) is gone.\n> \n> In indices: positions[0] to positions[11], with 0 head, 11 tail.\n> \n> After move to C without eat: new positions = [C] + positions[0:-1]  // positions[0] to positions[10], since -1 is last, but [0:-1] is indices 0 to 10.\n> \n> positions[0:-1] is positions from index 0 to 10 (inclusive), which is 11 elements, plus [C] makes 12?

Move to D no eat: new snake [D, A, B] — B is new tail, C is gone. So from 3 to 2 segments? No, in this case, from 3 segments to 2? That can't be right for growth.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food is eaten, the snake moves forward: the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is left empty. So the number of segments remains the same.\n> \n> In the list: for positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T], after moving to C with no eat:\n> - New head: C\n> - New B1: H\n> - New B2: B1\n> - ...\n> - New T: the second last segment, which was before T.\n> \n> So new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-2} ] where B_{n-2} is the segment before tail.\n> \n> For n segments, after move no eat, still n segments: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-2}], and the tail T is removed.\n> \n> In terms of indices: let positions be P[0] = H, P[1] = B1, P[2] = B2, ..., P[k] for k from 0 to m-1 for m segments.\n> \n> After move to C no eat:\n> New P[0] = C\n> New P[1] = P[0] (old H)\n> New P[2] = P[1] (old B1)\n> ...\n> New P[k] = P[k-1] for k from 1 to m-1, but the last P[m-1] is not used, so the new snake has positions from new P[0] to new P[m-1], but with new P[0] = C, new P[1] = old P[0], new P[2] = old P[1], ..., new P[m-1] = old P[m-2], so the old tail P[m-1] is gone.\n> \n> For example, m=3: P[0]=H, P[1]=B1, P[2]=T\n> \n> After move to C no eat:\n> New P[0] = C\n> New P[1] = old P[0] = H\n> New P[2] = old P[1] = B1  // so new tail is B1, T is gone\n> \n> So new positions: [C, H, B1] — so B1 is new tail, and T is removed.\n> \n> Similarly for larger snake.\n> \n> In this case, current snake 12 segments: P[0]=(4,1), P[1]=(3,1), P[2]=(2,1), P[3]=(1,1), P[4]=(1,2), P[5]=(1,3), P[6]=(2,3), P[7]=(3,3), P[8]=(3,4), P[9]=(3,5), P[10]=(4,5), P[11]=(5,5)  // P[11] is tail\n> \n> If move to (5,1) no eat:\n> New head: (5,1)\n> New P[1] = old P[0] = (4,1)\n> New P[2] = old P[1] = (3,1)\n> New P[3] = old P[2] = (2,1)\n> New P[4] = old P[3] = (1,1)\n> New P[5] = old P[4] = (1,2)\n> New P[6] = old P[5] = (1,3)\n> New P[7] = old P[6] = (2,3)\n> New P[8] = old P[7] = (3,3)\n> New P[9] = old P[8] = (3,4)\n> New P[10] = old P[9] = (3,5)\n> New P[11] = old P[10] = (4,5)  // new tail\n> \n> So new positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5)\n> \n> Old tail (5,5) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat, I keep the tail.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 57, I can move U to (4,2) and eat food, or move R to (5,1) no eat.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), I eat the food at (4,2), which has life span 3, so it's available now.

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so I can only move within x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> - x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning columns x=0 and x=7 are entirely walls. Similarly for y=0 and y=7.\n> - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> - So, cells that are walls: all with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, plus (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> **Snake Positions:**\n> - Head at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> - So, the snake is 12 segments long.\n> - Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to (4,1) from previous position? Positions are given head first, so from (3,1) to (4,1) was a right move, so current direction is R.\n> \n> **Food:**\n> - Two food items:\n> - (4,2) with life span 3, value +1 (positive)\n> - (4,6) with life span 8, value +1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, so eating either gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: (4,2) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 57, if not eaten, it will be there for 3 more turns?

Since countdown decreases each turn, including the current one, so on turn t, life span is L, then turn t+1 it's L-1, ..., down to 0, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before next turn? I need to be precise for planning.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if countdown decreases each turn, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0.

So at the start of turn 57, food has life span as given. After I move, and if I eat, it's consumed; else, life span decreases by 1 at the end of the turn or something.\n> \n> But for planning, I should assume that for each turn, after the action, life span decreases.\n> \n> To simplify, since I need to think about when it disappears, for (4,2) with life span 3 at turn 57, it will be available until turn 59 (since after turn 59, it disappears before turn 60). Let's say:\n> - After turn 57: if not eaten, life span becomes 2\n> - After turn 58: life span 1\n> - After turn 59: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) with life span 8: available for 8 turns from now, until after turn 64 or so.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (4,1), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).

Check if (4,2) is a wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: (4,2) — x=4, y=2, not border (borders x=0,7 y=0,7), not internal obstacles: internal are (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3), so (4,2) is clear.\n> \n> Body: before move, (4,2) not occupied, after move, head is at (4,2), and body segments are behind, so no collision with body at (4,2).\n> \n> But tail is at (5,5), far away.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,5), head at (4,1), not adjacent. After move to (4,2), head at (4,2), tail at (5,5), not adjacent, so no issue.\n> \n> So moving U to (4,2) seems safe and I eat food immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there is another food at (4,6) with longer life span.\n> \n> If I eat (4,2) now, I get +1, but what about future?\n> \n> After eating, I'm at (4,2), and direction would be U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Then possible next moves.\n> \n> But let's consider the other option: move R to (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is empty? No food there, and not wall.\n> \n> (5,1): x=5, y=1, not border, not internal obstacle (internal are (5,6), etc., not (5,1)), so valid.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (5,1), then body: (4,1) becomes second segment, and tail (1,1) or what? Positions: after move, since no eat, head to (5,1), then previous head (4,1) becomes first body, then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), ..., up to (5,5), but since no grow, the last segment (tail) is removed, so new tail is (4,5)? Let's see.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (4,1) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (1,1), 4: (1,2), 5: (1,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1) no eat:\n> - New head: (5,1)\n> - New body: [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) ]  // (5,5) is removed, so 11 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) — (4,5) is the new tail? After removal, the tail was (5,5), which is removed, so the segment before that is (4,5), which becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Positions: 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (1,1), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,5), 11: (4,5) — 12 segments? No: originally 12 segments, after move without eating, length remains 12, but tail moves.\n> \n> Original: 12 positions. After move: head to new position, so new list has the new head, then all except the tail. So 11 positions? No.\n> \n> Standard: if no eat, snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of list: new head position, followed by all positions except the last one.\n> \n> So for 12 segments, after moving to new cell without eating, new snake has 11 segments: [new_head, pos0, pos1, ..., pos10] where pos0 was head, now second, pos1 to pos10, and pos11 (tail) is gone.\n> \n> In indices: positions[0] to positions[11], with 0 head, 11 tail.\n> \n> After move to C without eat: new positions = [C] + positions[0:-1]  // positions[0] to positions[10], since -1 is last, but [0:-1] is indices 0 to 10.\n> \n> positions[0:-1] is positions from index 0 to 10 (inclusive), which is 11 elements, plus [C] makes 12? No.\n> \n> positions list has 12 elements: indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> positions[0] is head, positions[11] is tail.\n> \n> After moving to new cell C without eating:\n> - The new head is C.\n> - The new first body segment is the old head positions[0]\n> - The new second body segment is positions[1], and so on, up to the new tail which is positions[10], because positions[11] is not included; the snake shortens.\n> \n> So new positions: [C, positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[10]] — this has 12 elements? positions[0] to positions[10] is 11 elements, plus C is 12.\n> \n> But originally 12 segments, after move without eating, it should have 11 segments because tail is cut.\n> \n> Confusion.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake [A, B, C] with A head, C tail. Move to D no eat: new snake [D, A, B] — B is new tail, C is gone. So from 3 to 2 segments? No, in this case, from 3 segments to 2? That can't be right for growth.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food is eaten, the snake moves forward: the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is left empty. So the number of segments remains the same.\n> \n> In the list: for positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T], after moving to C with no eat:\n> - New head: C\n> - New B1: H\n> - New B2: B1\n> - ...\n> - New T: the second last segment, which was before T.\n> \n> So new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-2} ] where B_{n-2} is the segment before tail.\n> \n> For n segments, after move no eat, still n segments: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-2}], and the tail T is removed.\n> \n> In terms of indices: let positions be P[0] = H, P[1] = B1, P[2] = B2, ..., P[k] for k from 0 to m-1 for m segments.\n> \n> After move to C no eat:\n> New P[0] = C\n> New P[1] = P[0] (old H)\n> New P[2] = P[1] (old B1)\n> ...\n> New P[k] = P[k-1] for k from 1 to m-1, but the last P[m-1] is not used, so the new snake has positions from new P[0] to new P[m-1], but with new P[0] = C, new P[1] = old P[0], new P[2] = old P[1], ..., new P[m-1] = old P[m-2], so the old tail P[m-1] is gone.\n> \n> For example, m=3: P[0]=H, P[1]=B1, P[2]=T\n> \n> After move to C no eat:\n> New P[0] = C\n> New P[1] = old P[0] = H\n> New P[2] = old P[1] = B1  // so new tail is B1, T is gone\n> \n> So new positions: [C, H, B1] — so B1 is new tail, and T is removed.\n> \n> Similarly for larger snake.\n> \n> In this case, current snake 12 segments: P[0]=(4,1), P[1]=(3,1), P[2]=(2,1), P[3]=(1,1), P[4]=(1,2), P[5]=(1,3), P[6]=(2,3), P[7]=(3,3), P[8]=(3,4), P[9]=(3,5), P[10]=(4,5), P[11]=(5,5)  // P[11] is tail\n> \n> If move to (5,1) no eat:\n> New head: (5,1)\n> New P[1] = old P[0] = (4,1)\n> New P[2] = old P[1] = (3,1)\n> New P[3] = old P[2] = (2,1)\n> New P[4] = old P[3] = (1,1)\n> New P[5] = old P[4] = (1,2)\n> New P[6] = old P[5] = (1,3)\n> New P[7] = old P[6] = (2,3)\n> New P[8] = old P[7] = (3,3)\n> New P[9] = old P[8] = (3,4)\n> New P[10] = old P[9] = (3,5)\n> New P[11] = old P[10] = (4,5)  // new tail\n> \n> So new positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5)\n> \n> Old tail (5,5) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat, I keep the tail.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 57, I can move U to (4,2) and eat food, or move R to (5,1) no eat.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), I eat the food at (4,2), which has life span 3, so it's available now.

Moving right first (Turn 57) avoids immediate eating from a constrained position and allows access to (4,2) via (5,2) without body collision. Long-term, the path aims to explore the right side for potential access to (4,6) if feasible within its life span, but survival and avoiding dead ends take precedence over risky food pursuit.\n",

Possible moves are U, L, R (D is invalid due to instant reverse rule).\n   - **U (4,4)**: Blocked by internal wall at (4,4).\n   - **L (3,3)**: Occupied by body segment (not tail), leading to collision.\n   - **R (5,3)**: Free (no walls or body segments).\n\n2. **Food Considerations**: \n   - Positive food at (4,6) (life span 6) is prioritized due to shorter life span. Moving R now sets up a path to reach it via subsequent U, U, L, U moves (as planned in the sequence).\n\n3. **Safety**: Moving R avoids all immediate risks (walls, body collisions) and aligns with the long-term plan to eat (4,6). \n\nThus, the action for Turn 59 is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 59. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So, I can't move into these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments down to (4,5) at the end. The snake is 13 segments long.

Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including the current one. So for (4,6), it will disappear after turn 59 + 6 - 1? Let me clarify life span. It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + L - 1? For example, if at turn t, life span is N, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Let's read: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

But it says \"after N turns\", so after N turns from now, it disappears. If N=6 at turn 59, it disappears after 6 turns, meaning at turn 65 it should be gone. But countdown decreases each turn, so when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, so from turn t to t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1): life span 9 at turn 59, so it will last until turn 67.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.

Then, I navigated upward to reach the positive food at (4,6) by turn 63, ensuring it was eaten before its life span expired (disappearing at turn 65), while avoiding obstacles and planning a path that maintains long-term survival by positioning the snake to potentially access the other food at (3,1) later.\n",

It's turn 60, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid seems to be from (0,0) to (7,7), since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the tail is at (3,5). Snake length is 13 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is Right, so it's moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after turn 65 (since current turn is 60, 60 to 65 is 5 turns, including turn 60? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is 5 at turn 60, it should last until turn 64, and disappear on turn 65? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears. For example, at turn 60, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 64? Let's think:\n> \n> - Turn 60: life span 5\n> \n> - After turn 60, countdown decreases to 4\n> \n> - Turn 61: life span 4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 64: life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 64, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 8. At turn 60, life span 8, so it will last until after turn 67? Turn 60: 8, after turn 60:7, turn 61:7, ..., turn 67:1, after turn 67:0, disappear on turn 68.\n> \n> But I need to think about when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,1) is actually under the snake's body. Looking at snake positions: (3,1) is a body segment. Specifically, it's the fifth segment: positions are [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), ...] so (3,1) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (3,1), since it's under the body, I can only eat it if that cell is vacated and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is not under snake, I think. Snake positions don't include (4,6), so it's free.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but probably more to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,3), direction Right.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move Up, Down, Left, or Right, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since current direction is Right, I cannot move Left immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 60: U, D, R. Not L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (6,3) is directly to the right of head at (5,3). Since head is at (5,3), moving Right would go to (6,3), but (6,3) is an obstacle, so I cannot move Right. (6,3) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell, I can't move there.\n> \n> Similarly, other obstacles.\n> \n> So at (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) - is this free? Let's check.\n> \n> First, snake positions: (5,3) is head, (4,3) is next, then (4,2), etc. So (5,4) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> So (5,4) is not occupied by snake. Is it a wall? Walls: borders and internal obstacles. (5,4) is not listed as obstacle, and not border since x=5 between 0-7, y=4 between 0-7, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, Down: (5,2) - not in snake positions, not wall? y=2, not border, not obstacle listed, obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), so (5,2) should be free.\n> \n> Right: (6,3) but (6,3) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Left: (4,3) but (4,3) is the second segment of the snake. But according to rules, moving into the tail is allowed only if it's the tail cell and it moves away. Here, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). Moving Left to (4,3) would collide with body, since it's occupied by the second segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that will be occupied by the tail after the move, it's ok because tail moves. But here, (4,3) is the neck, not the tail. After moving, if I move Left to (4,3), but currently (4,3) is occupied, and since it's not the tail, it would cause collision.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> At turn 60, snake: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,2), etc.\n> \n> If I move Left to (4,3), but (4,3) is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the head moves to (4,3), and the body follows: the second segment was at (4,3) but now head is there, so the segment that was at (4,3) moves to... it's messy.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves, it occupies new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new position, the second segment moves to where head was, and so on.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,3), which is currently occupied by the second segment, then after move, head is at (4,3), but that cell was just vacated? No.\n> \n> At start, positions: segment 0: (5,3), segment 1: (4,3), segment 2: (4,2), etc.\n> \n> After moving Left to (4,3): head moves to (4,3), but (4,3) is currently occupied by segment 1. When head moves, segment 1 will move to the previous head position (5,3). So the cell (4,3) is vacated by segment 1 when it moves to (5,3), and then head moves to (4,3). But since segment 1 leaves (4,3) before head arrives, it should be ok? No.\n> \n> I think there's a timing issue.\n> \n> Typically in snake, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the body, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for non-tail segments, moving into them causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is segment 1, not tail, so moving Left to (4,3) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), which is far.\n> \n> So for head at (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (5,4)\n> \n> - Down: to (5,2)\n> \n> - Right: to (6,3) but (6,3) is wall, cannot\n> \n> - Left: to (4,3) but (4,3) is body segment, not tail, so collision, cannot\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves at turn 60 are Up or Down.\n> \n> So action at turn 60: either U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food to consider.\n> \n> Food at (4,6): value +1, life span 5 at turn 60, so it will disappear after turn 64, meaning last chance to eat is turn 64.\n> \n> Turn 60: life span 5, after turn decreases to 4, so available on turn 60,61,62,63,64; disappears after turn 64, not on turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1): value +1, life span 8, available until turn 67? Turn 60:8, available turns 60 to 67? Life span decreases after each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves there, then life span decreases to L-1 after, etc.\n> \n> So for (4,6), life span 5 at turn 60, so it can be eaten on turns 60,61,62,63,64. After eaten or after turn 64, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1), life span 8, can be eaten on turns 60 to 67.\n> \n> But (3,1) is currently under snake body, so I can only eat it if the snake moves away from (3,1) and then head moves back.\n> \n> Now, let's see the snake body.

Was at (3,1), segment 4 was there, now moves to (4,1), so (3,1) is empty now, and food is there, so (3,1) has food and is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is still there.\n> \n> Now at turn 61, head at (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is now occupied by segment 1? After turn 60, positions: head (5,4), segment1 at (5,3), which is body, so moving down to (5,3) would collide with body. Not tail, so cannot.\n> \n> L to (4,4) but (4,4) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> R to (6,4) — is (6,4) free? Not border, not obstacle (obstacles are (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3), so (6,4) not listed, should be free. But (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,4) is different.\n> \n> (6,4) y=4, x=6, borders x=7, so not border, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> But moving R to (6,4) might not help for going to (4,6).\n> \n> To reach (4,6), better to go U to (5,5).\n> \n> Then at (5,5), can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6) but (5,6) is obstacle, cannot, or R to (6,5), etc.\n> \n> L to (4,5) then U to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, back to turn 60, if I move Down instead.\n> \n> Option: move Down to (5,2)\n> \n> At turn 60, move D to (5,2)\n> \n> Then head to (5,2), new direction D.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,2), segment1 to (5,3), segment2 to (4,3), segment3 to (4,2), segment4 to (4,1), segment5 to (3,1), etc. similar shift.\n> \n> (3,1) vacated as segment4 moves to (4,1), so food at (3,1) is now accessible.\n> \n> But to eat (3,1), head at (5,2), need to go to (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is at (3,1), head at (5,2), so Δx=2, Δy=1, distance 3.\n> \n> But there might be obstacles.\n> \n> Path: from (5,2) to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by segment3? After move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2)?

(5,1) — is it free? (5,1) not border, not obstacle, not snake? After move, positions: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), etc. (5,1) not occupied, so can move Down to (5,1).\n> \n> Then from (5,1), to (4,1) or (5,0) but y=0 is border wall, cannot go to (5,0).\n> \n> (4,1) is occupied by seg4?

Let me confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's list the walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So walls include borders and these internal points.\n> \n> Playable cells are where x and y are between 1 and 6 inclusive, except for the internal obstacles.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (5,4), direction is U (up, so moving towards increasing y, I assume). In coordinates, typically y increases upwards or downwards? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I think. Let's check: U: (x,y+1), so moving up increases y.\n> \n> Snake: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)] Head is (5,4), and since direction is U, it was moving up to (5,4) from (5,3)? Positions are head first: (5,4) is head, then (5,3), (4,3), etc. So from (5,3) to (5,4) is up, since y from 3 to 4, increase. So direction U means it moved to (5,4) from (5,3), so next move could be U, L, R, but not D because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 10? Value is 1 for all, I think. In the input: (4,6,4,1) — probably (x,y,life_span,value)? Let's see the format: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (4,6,4,1) - (3,1,7,1) - (3,6,10,1)\"\n> \n> It says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", but in the tuple, it's (x,y,life_span,value)? For first one: (4,6,4,1) so x=4,y=6, life_span=4, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1,7,1): x=3,y=1, life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (3,6,10,1): x=3,y=6, life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All are positive food since value=1, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6), life=4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 61, life=4, so it will disappear after turn 64? Let's think: on turn t, if life_span=N, it will be there for N turns, including turn t, so it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Example: at turn t, life_span N, after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, then it disappears. So it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> In this case, turn 61:\n> \n> - Food at (4,6): life=4, so exists on turns 61,62,63,64. Disappears after turn 64?

It's turn 62, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at the borders and some internal obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). I should plot this mentally.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,5) from (5,4) below it, since y increases up? Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, and y increases upwards, x increases right. But the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U increases y, which might be upwards if (0,0) is bottom-left. I think that's standard. But in the state, head direction is U, and it's at (5,5), with previous position (5,4), which has lower y, so yes, y=4 to y=5 is upward movement, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life_span 3\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life_span 6? Wait, the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? No, looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (4, 6, 3, 1)\" – let's read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"(4, 6, 3, 1)\" and \"(3, 1, 6, 1)\" and \"(3, 6, 9, 1)\". But in the description, it's \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\", so for the first one: position (4,6), life_span 3, value 1. Similarly, (3,1) life_span 6, value 1; (3,6) life_span 9, value 1. All positive food, since value is +1.\n> \n> Life_span is how many turns left, including current turn, so it decreases each turn.\n> \n> Current turn is 62, so:\n> \n> - Food at (4,6): life_span 3, so disappears after turn 64? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 62, life_span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns, so after turn 64. Similarly, (3,1) life_span 6, disappears after turn 67? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life_span N means it disappears after N turns from now, including current turn. So if life_span is N at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\". So, at turn t, if life_span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1 (since current turn is included).\n> \n> - After N turns, it disappears, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears before turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N: during turn t, it is present, countdown becomes N-1 at turn t+1 if not eaten.

(4,5) not listed, so not a wall.\n> \n> Snake body: positions: (5,5) head, (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So (4,5) is not in this list.

But we need to consider if food is there or something, but for movement, as long as not wall or body, it should be ok, but body collision: head touches body segment except the tail might be movable if tail moves away.\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell is deadly if it is a wall or a body segment, except that if it is the tail segment, and the tail moves, it might be ok, but only if after move, head is not on body.\n> \n> When you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its cell if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - If head moves to a cell that is not food, then tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n> \n> - If head moves to food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it dies. If it moves to the tail cell, it only dies if after eating, the head and tail collide, but since tail doesn't move if food eaten, it could be a problem.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to the current tail position, and no food is eaten, then tail moves away, so it's safe. But if food is eaten at tail position, then tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell, collision.\n> \n> Special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in general, for movement to a cell:\n> \n> - If cell is wall: die\n> \n> - If cell is body segment and not the tail: die\n> \n> - If cell is tail: safe only if no food eaten there, or if food eaten but not the case where head and tail collide after growth.\n> \n> But the tail reward danger is specific to when head is adjacent and moves to eat food at tail.\n> \n> Back to adjacent cells for head at (5,5):\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - wall, cannot move\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - but D is opposite direction, not allowed. Also, (5,4) is body segment, specifically the second segment, not tail. Tail is at (3,3). So (5,4) is body, not tail, so moving to (5,4) would cause collision, even if allowed, but direction not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - L: (4,5) - not wall, not in body positions, so should be safe to move to, empty cell.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) - not wall? Walls: x=7 is border, so (6,5) x=6<7, y=5, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,3) is one, but (6,5) not listed, so not wall. Snake body: not in positions, so (6,5) should be empty and safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm body positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), etc., no (6,5). Yes.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6), (3,1), (3,6). (4,6) is above, but (5,6) is wall, so (4,6) might be accessible from other directions.\n> \n> Now, since U is blocked by wall, and D not allowed, only possible moves are L to (4,5) or R to (6,5).\n> \n> I need to choose between L or R.\n> \n> But I have to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the food locations.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,6): value 1, life_span 3, so must be eaten by turn 64, else disappears. At (4,6), which is left and up from head? Head at (5,5), so (4,6) is left and up: x=4, y=6.\n> \n> - (3,1): value 1, life_span 6, at (3,1), which is left and down. Head at (5,5), (3,1) is x=3, y=1.\n> \n> - (3,6): value 1, life_span 9, at (3,6), left and up.\n> \n> Now, snake body: let's list all occupied cells to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake: positions: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, head at (5,5), can move to (4,5) or (6,5).\n> \n> If move L to (4,5): that's empty, no food, so snake moves, head to (4,5), tail moves from (3,3) to? Since no food eaten, tail moves, so the segment at (3,3) is removed, new positions: head (4,5), then body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and tail was (3,3) but moves off, so the last segment is now (2,3)? Let's list new positions after move L.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n> \n> After move L to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), so new head (4,5). Since no food eaten, tail moves off (3,3), so the body becomes: (4,5) + all but last: so [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] and (3,3) is gone. Tail is now (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (6,5): head to (6,5), body [ (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, from (4,5) or (6,5), I need to plan to eat food.\n> \n> Food at (4,6): that's above (4,5), so if I go to (4,5), I could then go up to (4,6), but (4,6) is food, and y=6, which is not border, but is there wall? Internal obstacles: (4,6) not listed, walls: x=4,y=6, not border, so should be accessible.\n> \n> But (4,6) has food, life_span 3, so if I can eat it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is another food at (3,6), and (3,1) at (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is currently occupied by the snake body! Look: snake positions include (3,1), which is the 7th segment or something. Positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), etc.\n> \n> So (3,1) is occupied by body, and food is at (3,1) with life_span 6. But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (3,1), the body is on it now, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the segment at (3,1) moves away, then head moves to (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, other positions.\n> \n> Now, back to current choice: move to (4,5) or (6,5).\n> \n> If I go to (4,5), then from there I can go U to (4,6) to eat the food there, but (4,6) has life_span 3, so I need to eat by turn 64.\n> \n> Turn 62 now, if I move to (4,5) on turn 62, then on turn 63 I could move U to (4,6) to eat it, which is within life_span (turns 62,63,64; eat on 63).\n> \n> If I go to (6,5), then from (6,5), I could go U to (6,6), but (6,6) might be safe? Or to other directions.\n> \n> But (4,6) is only accessible if I go left first, I think.\n> \n> From (6,5), to reach (4,6), I need to go left and up, which might take more turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is at (3,6), which is left and up from head.\n> \n> (3,1) is down left, but occupied now.\n> \n> Let's think about paths.\n> \n> First, option 1: move L to (4,5) on turn 62.\n> \n> Then on turn 63, from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) to eat the food at (4,6). Is that safe?\n> \n> Move to (4,6): is it wall? No. Body? After moving to (4,5) on turn 62, positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)\n> \n> (4,6) is not in this list, so empty except for food. Food is there, so moving to (4,6) would eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, head at (4,6), new tail not added yet? When head moves to food, it eats, so length increases, tail stays.\n> \n> So after move to (4,6) on turn 63, head at (4,6), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) and since food eaten, no tail move, so new segment added, tail still at (2,3)? Positions: the body includes the previous head and all segments, so after move to (4,6) with eat, positions become: head (4,6), then previous head (4,5), then the rest: (5,5), (5,4), ..., up to (2,3), and tail is (2,3), but since no move, tail stays, so length increases by one, tail is now (2,3) still? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, head goes to new position, the body follows, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move; the segment that was tail remains.\n> \n> So positions: new head (4,6), then the previous positions from head to tail: previous was [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), ..., (2,3) ], but since food eaten, we add a copy of tail or something. Better: the body segments are the same as before, plus the new position.\n> \n> After move without eat: head new, body shifts, tail removed.\n> \n> With eat: head new, body shifts, no tail removed, so body has one more segment.\n> \n> So after turn 62 move L to (4,5) no eat: positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] tail (2,3)\n> \n> Then turn 63 move U to (4,6) with eat: head to (4,6), so new positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] and since ate, no tail removed, so tail is now (2,3), but the last segment is (2,3), and we have 14 segments.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? Moving to (4,6) seems fine.\n> \n> But after that, where to go?\n> \n> There is food at (3,6) and (3,1).\n> \n> (3,6) is at (3,6), which is left from (4,6), so I could move L to (3,6) on next turn? But need to check direction.\n> \n> After head at (4,6), direction would be U (since moved up), so from (4,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But U to (4,7) is y=7, which is border wall, so cannot. D to (4,5) is body, (4,5) is now the second segment, not tail, so moving to (4,5) would collide. L to (3,6), R to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall, internal obstacle.\n> \n> So from (4,6), only possible move is L to (3,6), since R is wall, U wall, D body.\n> \n> (3,6) has food? Yes, food at (3,6) with life_span 9, so I can eat it.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,6) on turn 64, I eat that food too.\n> \n> But let's sequence:\n> \n> Turn 62: move L to (4,5)\n> \n> Turn 63: move U to (4,6) eat food, now at (4,6)\n> \n> Turn 64: from (4,6), only move L to (3,6) possible, move to (3,6) and eat that food? (3,6) is food, yes.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6) on turn 64, head at (3,6), ate food, so snake grows.\n> \n> Positions: after turn 63, head at (4,6), body: (4,5), (5,5), etc. to (2,3)\n> \n> After turn 64 move L to (3,6): head to (3,6), new positions: [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] and ate, so tail stays, length 15, tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, from (3,6), what can I do?

Not wall? Walls: y=7 top, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right. (3,5) not border. Internal obstacles: not listed. Snake body: current positions have (4,6), (4,5), etc., (3,5) not occupied. So should be empty.\n> \n> L to (2,6): not wall, not body? Body positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), ..., down to (2,3), so (2,6) not in list, should be empty.\n> \n> R to (4,6) but R is right, (4,6) is body segment, second segment now, so collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,6): D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> But I also have food at (3,1) which is occupied by body now.\n> \n> (3,1) is in the body, currently at turn 64, position: (3,1) is a body segment, specifically, after the moves, it might be different.\n> \n> At turn 64 after eating at (3,6), positions include (3,1), which is occupied.\n> \n> To eat food at (3,1), I need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (3,1), then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,1) is occupied, so I need to free it.\n> \n> Life_span is 6, from turn 62, so present turns 62-67, so I have until turn 67 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, after being at (3,6), I can move around.\n> \n> But let's see the other option: if I move R to (6,5) on turn 62.\n> \n> Move R to (6,5) on turn 62: from (5,5) to (6,5), empty, no food, so snake moves, head to (6,5), body: [ (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, from (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.

Invalid.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The food at (4,6) will disappear after turn 64, so it must be eaten now or next turn to gain its reward.\n- Moving left (L) to (3,5) is safe but misses the opportunity to eat (4,6). From (3,5), the snake cannot reach (4,6) on turn 64 because (4,5) is occupied by the body.\n- Moving up (U) to (4,6) allows the snake to eat the food and grow. After this:\n  - On turn 64, the only valid move is left (L) to (3,6), where another food is available.\n  - This sequence maximizes immediate score (+2 from two foods) and is safe.\n\n### Risks:\n- After eating (4,6) and (3,6), the snake is in the top-left corner with limited space, but the food at (3,1) is unlikely to be reachable in time (must be eaten by turn 67). However, the +2 score from the two foods is guaranteed, while the +1 from (3,1) is uncertain.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to **move up (U)** to eat the food at (4,6), securing the +1 reward and setting up the snake to eat another food at (3,6) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 63. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is Left, meaning it was moving left to (4,5) from, say, (5,5)? Positions are listed head first, so from (4,5) to (5,5) means it moved left to (4,5), since (5,5) is the next segment. If head is at (4,5) and direction is L, that means it just moved left to (4,5), probably from (5,5) in the previous turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 5? It says (3,1,5,1), I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), but in the description it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", but in the input it's listed as ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (3,1) it's value 5? No, let's read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" and then \"- (4, 6, 2, 1)\" – this might be inconsistent. In the description it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \", but here it's written as (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see: \"- (4, 6, 2, 1)\" and \"- (3, 1, 5, 1)\" and \"- (3, 6, 8, 1)\". Based on the order, it seems like it's (x, y, life_span, value), but the description says ( (x,y), value, life_span ). There's a mismatch.\n> \n> Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\n> - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> But in the current state, it's listed as \"- (4, 6, 2, 1)\" which is probably (x,y, life_span, value) since 2 and 1, but life_span should be before value? I think it's a formatting issue. In the text, it says \" (4, 6, 2, 1) \" and similarly for others. But the description specifies the order: ( (x,y), value, life_span ). So for (4,6,2,1), it might be x=4,y=6, value=2, life_span=1? But value is usually +1 or -1, but here it's 2? That can't be right.\n> \n> Let's read the core rules: \"Positive Food Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food Penalty Value = -1\", so value should be +1 or -1. But here it's listed as 2,1 for (4,6) – 2 and 1, but which is value and which is life_span?\n> \n> Perhaps the input is (x,y, life_span, value). For (4,6,2,1), it could be life_span=2, value=1. Similarly, (3,1,5,1) life_span=5, value=1, and (3,6,8,1) life_span=8, value=1. But value=1 for all, and no negative food mentioned? But in the rules, there could be negative food, but here all have value=1, so all positive food.\n> \n> In the food list, it says \"value1, life_span1\" in the description, but in input it's numbers separated by commas. I think for (4,6,2,1) it means x=4,y=6, life_span=2, value=1. Similarly for others. And value=1 for all, so all are positive food.\n> \n> (3,1) has value=1? (3,1,5,1) so x=3,y=1, life_span=5, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6,8,1) x=3,y=6, life_span=8, value=1.\n> \n> And (4,6,2,1) x=4,y=6, life_span=2, value=1.\n> \n> All value=1, so all good to eat.\n> \n> Now, life_span: for (4,6) life=2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=63.\n> \n> So for food at (4,6): life_span=2, so at turn 63, life=2; after turn 63, life=1; after turn 64, life=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 63 or 64, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life_span=5, so from turn 63, it will last until turn 67 (since after turn 67, life=0? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life_span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns including the current one? Or after N turns from now?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, the food will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> For example, life_span=2 at turn 63:\n> \n> - Turn 63: countdown=2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 64: countdown=1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 64, countdown=0, disappears before turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, for life_span=5 at turn 63:\n> \n> - Turn 63: countdown=5\n> \n> - Turn 64: countdown=4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 67: countdown=1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 67, disappears.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,5), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite, instant reverse not allowed).\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I can move Left (same), Up, Down, but not Right.\n> \n> Now, grid is 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake body: positions from (4,5) to (2,3).

When the segment that is there moves away.\n> \n> The segment at (3,1) will move when the snake moves, but it depends on the path.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, it might take time to vacate (3,1).\n> \n> Let's see the snake body around (3,1): positions include (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), etc.\n> \n> (3,1) is the 9th segment, so when the snake moves, this segment will move to the position of the 8th segment when the head moves.\n> \n> The segments shift only if no growth; with growth, the tail doesn't move, so segments don't shift immediately.\n> \n> To vacate a body-occupied cell, the snake needs to move without eating, so that the tail moves and cells are vacated.\n> \n> For (3,1) to be free, the snake must move so that the segment at (3,1) moves away and no new segment comes, but since it's a body cell, when the snake moves without eating, the body shifts, so each segment moves to the next position, so the cell that was occupied by a segment might be vacated if it was the tail, or occupied by the previous segment.\n> \n> Specifically, when snake moves and doesn't eat:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - Tail vacates its cell\n> \n> So only the tail cell is vacated; other body cells are still occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For a cell that is not tail, it is never directly vacated; it remains occupied until the segment that is there moves to a new position when the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, the cell (3,1) is occupied by a specific segment. When the snake moves without eating, that segment will move to the position that was previously occupied by the segment ahead of it. So the cell (3,1) might be vacated if that segment moves away and no other segment moves into it, but since the segments shift, the cell is reoccupied by the segment from behind.\n> \n> In fact, for a cell in the middle of the body, it is never free; it is always occupied by some segment when the snake moves without eating. Only the tail cell is vacated when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> When the snake eats, no cell is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, a food under the body can only be eaten if the snake moves in such a way that the body moves off that cell and the cell is not reoccupied immediately, but since the segments are connected, it's only possible if that cell becomes the tail position at some point, or if the snake grows and the tail doesn't move, but the body shifts.\n> \n> The only way for a body-occupied cell to become free is if it is the tail and the snake moves without eating, so the tail moves and vacates it.\n> \n> Or, if the snake eats, the tail doesn't move, so no vacate.\n> \n> But for a body cell, it can become the tail only after many moves, as the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, (3,1) is currently the 9th segment, and tail is at (2,3), which is the 15th? Positions: let's number from head.\n> \n> After turn 64: positions index 0: head (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (1,1), 12: (1,2), 13: (1,3), 14: tail (2,3)\n> \n> So (3,1) is segment 9.\n> \n> The tail is segment 14 at (2,3).\n> \n> For (3,1) to become the tail, the snake needs to move 5 times without eating, so that the tail moves forward 5 times, and segment 9 becomes the new tail after 5 moves? Let's see.\n> \n> Each time the snake moves without eating, the tail index increases, but the segments shift.\n> \n> Suppose the snake moves without eating for k moves. After each move, the head moves, each segment moves to the previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after one move without eating, segment 14 (tail) is removed, segment 13 moves to where 14 was, etc., down to segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, and head to new position.\n> \n> So the position that was segment 9 is now occupied by segment 8, because segments shift back.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move without eating, the cell that was occupied by segment i is now occupied by segment i-1 for i from 1 to 14, and the old head cell is now segment 1, new head at new cell, old tail vacated.\n> \n> But for a fixed cell, say (3,1), it was occupied by segment 9. After one move without eating, segment 9 has moved to where segment 8 was, so (3,1) is now occupied by segment 8, if segment 8 was elsewhere, but no, the segments move to the previous positions, so the cell (3,1) is now occupied by whatever segment was at the position that segment 8 moved from, but it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (3,1) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves away, which happens when that segment is not the tail and the snake moves.\n> \n> But since the segment at (3,1) is segment 9, when the snake moves, segment 9 will move to the position of segment 8, so it leaves (3,1) and goes to where segment 8 was. Then (3,1) is occupied by the segment that was behind it, segment 10, which moves to where segment 9 was, so to (3,1).\n> \n> After one move without eating:\n> \n> - New head at new position\n> \n> - New segment 1 at old head position (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 2 at old segment 1 position (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 3 at old segment 2 position (4,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> - New segment 9 at old segment 8 position (4,1)\n> \n> - New segment 10 at old segment 9 position (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 11 at old segment 10 position (2,1)\n> \n> - New segment 12 at old segment 11 position (1,1)\n> \n> - New segment 13 at old segment 12 position (1,2)\n> \n> - New segment 14 at old segment 13 position (1,3)\n> \n> - Old segment 14 position (2,3) vacated\n> \n> So for cell (3,1), it was occupied by old segment 9, and after move, it is occupied by new segment 10, which came from (2,1)? New segment 10 is at old segment 9 position, which is (3,1), so (3,1) is still occupied, by new segment 10.\n> \n> Similarly, it remains occupied until the tail reaches that point.\n> \n> The only way for (3,1) to be vacated is if it becomes the tail position and the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> Currently, (3,1) is segment 9, and tail is segment 14 at (2,3). The distance from head to that segment is 9 steps, but to make it the tail, the snake needs to move so that the tail end moves to (3,1).\n> \n> Since the snake is linear, it will take at least 5 moves for the tail to reach near (3,1), but the path may not be straight.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,3), and (3,1) is at (3,1), so they are close.\n> \n> From (2,3) to (3,1) is adjacent, actually.\n> \n> (2,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent; (2,3) to (3,3) or (2,2) or (1,3), but (3,1) is at (3,1), which is down-left from (2,3).\n> \n> Distance: from (2,3) to (3,1) is |dx=1, dy=2|, so not adjacent.\n> \n> The tail can move to (3,1) in a few moves if the snake coils properly.\n> \n> But it's complicated.\n> \n> For the food at (3,1) to be eatable, the snake must move in such a way that the cell (3,1) is vacated by the tail moving away, then the head can move to it.\n> \n> Since the food is there, when vacated, it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> But with life span short, it might be tight.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,5).\n> \n> But (3,1) has only 3 turns left after turn 64.\n> \n> After turn 64, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 67.\n> \n> After turn 67, it disappears.\n> \n> So turns 65,66,67 to eat it.\n> \n> On turn 65, from head at (3,6), I need to start moving towards the bottom-left.\n> \n> But head is at (3,6), (3,1) is at bottom, so far away.\n> \n> Path from (3,6) to (3,1) is not direct due to obstacles and body.\n> \n> Obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so the column x=3 is free from y=1 to 6, except at (3,1) occupied, but the cell is free if vacated.\n> \n> (3,1) to (3,6) is a straight line on x=3, but there is obstacle at (4,4), but on x=3, no obstacles, so it's clear.\n> \n> But the snake body is in the way.\n> \n> For example, at (3,5), (3,4), etc., may be free or not.\n> \n> After turn 64, free cells include (3,5), (3,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,5), (1,6), (6,1), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) but (5,6) obstacle, (6,3) obstacle, so (6,6) free? x=6,y=6, not obstacle, not occupied.\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> To reach (3,1), from (3,6), I can move down.\n> \n> But at (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), then head at (3,5), direction D.\n> \n> Then I can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n> \n> (3,4) is free, (2,5) free.\n> \n> From (3,4), I can move to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied?

So I can't move into these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,6), then body segments: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). So the snake has 15 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left to (3,6) from previous position.

Tail is at (1,3), so (4,5) is not tail; it's a body segment. So moving to (4,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, R is not safe; cannot move right to (4,5).\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible safe moves: D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n> \n> R to (4,5) is occupied, not safe.\n> \n> Now, there is food at (3,1) and (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) has food, but it's occupied by snake body. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Currently, (4,5) has food, but the body is there. So to eat it, I need the body to move away first, then head moves there.\n> \n> But if I move to (4,5) now, since body is there, it's a collision, so I die.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat (4,5) immediately; I need to plan to free that cell first.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) has food, but it's also occupied by snake body. Snake positions include (3,1), which is the 11th segment: (4,1), (3,1), ... so (3,1) is occupied.\n> \n> So both foods are under snake body.\n> \n> (3,1) has food with life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 turns (turn 66 and 67, so gone at turn 68).\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 8, so it will last until turn 74.\n> \n> Now, current turn 66.\n> \n> I need to think about eating these foods.\n> \n> First, for (3,1): it's at (3,1), occupied by snake body. To eat it, I need the snake to move so that the body leaves (3,1), and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,5).\n> \n> But (3,1) has short life, only 2 turns left.\n> \n> Life span 2 means: on turn 66, it exists; after turn 66, life span decreases by 1 to 1; after turn 67, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 66 or 67, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,5), life span 8: can be eaten from turn 66 to 73, disappears at turn 74.\n> \n> Now, since (3,1) is time-sensitive, I should consider if I can eat it soon.\n> \n> But (3,1) is near the tail. Tail is at (1,3), and (3,1) is part of the body.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> From head to tail:\n> \n> 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> 1: (3,6)\n> \n> 2: (4,6)\n> \n> 3: (4,5) -- has food\n> \n> 4: (5,5)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (5,3)\n> \n> 7: (4,3)\n> \n> 8: (4,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,1) -- has? No, (4,1) is position, but food at (3,1) and (4,5)\n> \n> 10: (4,1)\n> \n> 11: (3,1) -- has food\n> \n> 12: (2,1)\n> \n> 13: (1,1)\n> \n> 14: (1,2)\n> \n> 15: (1,3) tail? Positions have 15 segments, indices from 0 to 14? Let's count.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n> \n> So 15 positions: index 0: (3,5) head, index 1: (3,6), index 2: (4,6), index 3: (4,5), index 4: (5,5), index 5: (5,4), index 6: (5,3), index 7: (4,3), index 8: (4,2), index 9: (4,1), index 10: (3,1), index 11: (2,1), index 12: (1,1), index 13: (1,2), index 14: (1,3) tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) which is index 10, and (4,5) which is index 3.\n> \n> To eat (3,1), I need index 10 to be vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,5), index 3 needs to be vacated.\n> \n> The snake moves by advancing the head and removing the tail, so each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, unless food is eaten, then tail is not removed, and snake grows.\n> \n> To vacate a cell, the snake must move so that the segment that was there moves away.\n> \n> For (3,1), it is currently occupied by index 10. When the snake moves, the tail (index 14) is removed, and a new head is added. The segment at (3,1) will move to the next position only if the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten, the tail is cut off each turn.\n> \n> So, to free (3,1), I need the snake to move such that the body segment at (3,1) moves to another position.\n> \n> Specifically, when the head moves, all body segments shift forward, so the segment that was at (3,1) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> Let's think of the snake as a list. When head moves to a new cell, say new_head, then the new positions become [new_head] + positions[:-1] if no growth, or [new_head] + positions if growth.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, so body shifts.\n> \n> So for cell (3,1), which is position index 10, it will be vacated only if, after moving, that segment is no longer there, meaning that the tail is cut before reaching that point or something.\n> \n> Actually, since the body shifts, the cell (3,1) will be occupied by the segment that was before it, but let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 66, I move to some direction.\n> \n> After move, if no food, the new head is at new position, and the last element (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail is freed, and the body segments each move to the position of the next segment.\n> \n> For example, if I move head from (3,5) to new cell, say (3,4), then new positions: head (3,4), then body: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., up to (1,3) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (3,1) was index 10, but after move, it becomes index 11, and the position shifts: the segment that was at index 9 (4,1) moves to where index 8 was? Let's not confuse.\n> \n> Positions before move: indices 0 to 14: cells (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4) with no growth, new positions: head (3,4), then body: position[0] becomes body[1], which is (3,5), then body[2] (3,6), body[3] (4,6), body[4] (4,5), body[5] (5,5), body[6] (5,4), body[7] (5,3), body[8] (4,3), body[9] (4,2), body[10] (4,1), body[11] (3,1), body[12] (2,1), body[13] (1,1), body[14] (1,2) and tail (1,3) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (3,1) is now occupied by the segment that was at index 11, which is (3,1) itself, but in the new list, it's at index 11, position (3,1) from old index 10? Old index 10 is (3,1), and after move, it is now at index 11, but the cell is still occupied, because the segment moved from (4,1) to (3,1)? Let's see:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,4)  new\n> \n> - Index 1: old head (3,5)\n> \n> - Index 2: old index 1 (3,6)\n> \n> - Index 3: old index 2 (4,6)\n> \n> - Index 4: old index 3 (4,5)\n> \n> - Index 5: old index 4 (5,5)\n> \n> - Index 6: old index 5 (5,4)\n> \n> - Index 7: old index 6 (5,3)\n> \n> - Index 8: old index 7 (4,3)\n> \n> - Index 9: old index 8 (4,2)\n> \n> - Index 10: old index 9 (4,1)  // this is now at (4,1), but in new list, index 10 is the value that was at old index 9\n> \n> Better to think: the new body at index i is the old position at index i-1 for i>=1.\n> \n> New position[0] = new head\n> \n> New position[i] = old position[i-1] for i from 1 to len-1, and old tail is removed.\n> \n> So for i from 1 to 14, new position[i] = old position[i-1]\n> \n> Then position[14] is removed, so new snake has 14 segments? No, length is same if no growth.\n> \n> Old positions: 15 cells.\n> \n> After move, new head, then new position[1] = old position[0], new position[2] = old position[1], ..., new position[14] = old position[13], and old position[14] is removed. So new snake has head and positions 1 to 14 are old 0 to 13.\n> \n> Indices: new pos[0] = new head\n> \n> New pos[1] = old pos[0]\n> \n> New pos[2] = old pos[1]\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New pos[k] = old pos[k-1] for k=1 to 14\n> \n> Then new pos[14] = old pos[13], and old pos[14] is gone.\n> \n> So for cell (3,1): it was old pos[10] = (3,1)\n> \n> After move, new pos[11] = old pos[10] = (3,1), so it is still occupied, but by the segment that was before, which is now shifted.\n> \n> The cell (3,1) is now occupied by new pos[11], which is old pos[10], so it's the same cell, occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body cell, when the snake moves without growing, the body segments shift, but the cells are still occupied except the tail cell is freed.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell that was the tail is freed, and other body cells remain occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For a cell like (3,1), it will only be freed when the segment that occupies it moves away, which happens when that segment is no longer part of the snake or when it moves to a different cell.\n> \n> In this case, since (3,1) is not the tail, it won't be freed immediately; the segment there will stay until the snake grows or moves in a way that it advances.\n> \n> To free (3,1), I need the segment that is at (3,1) to move to another cell, which happens when the head moves and the body shifts, so the segment at (3,1) will move to where the previous segment was, but only if it is not the tail.\n> \n> In the shift, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment in the chain.\n> \n> For example, the segment that was at old position i moves to new position i, but new position i is old position i-1 for i>0.\n> \n> Let's take (3,1): it is old position 10.\n> \n> After a move, new position 11 = old position 10 = (3,1), so the segment is now at new position 11, but the cell is still (3,1), so it remains occupied.\n> \n> Only when the snake moves and the tail is cut, the tail cell is freed, but for internal cells, they remain occupied unless the snake grows and the body doesn't shift, but when growing, the tail is not cut, so all cells remain occupied, and new head is added.\n> \n> To free a body cell, I need the snake to move without growing for several turns, so that the tail recedes and eventually the cell is vacated when the segment that was there becomes the tail and is cut.\n> \n> For (3,1), which is position 10, it will become position 9 after one move, then 8, and so on, until it becomes the tail and is cut.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list the indices.\n> \n> The tail is position 14: (1,3)\n> \n> Position 13: (1,2)\n> \n> Position 12: (1,1)\n> \n> Position 11: (2,1)\n> \n> Position 10: (3,1)\n> \n> Position 9: (4,1)\n> \n> Position 8: (4,2)\n> \n> Position 7: (4,3)\n> \n> Position 6: (5,3)\n> \n> Position 5: (5,4)\n> \n> Position 4: (5,5)\n> \n> Position 3: (4,5)\n> \n> Position 2: (4,6)\n> \n> Position 1: (3,6)\n> \n> Position 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> After one move without growth, new head at some cell, say (3,4)\n> \n> Then new positions:\n> \n> Position 0: (3,4)\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0 = (3,5)\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1 = (3,6)\n> \n> Position 3: old position 2 = (4,6)\n> \n> Position 4: old position 3 = (4,5)\n> \n> Position 5: old position 4 = (5,5)\n> \n> Position 6: old position 5 = (5,4)\n> \n> Position 7: old position 6 = (5,3)\n> \n> Position 8: old position 7 = (4,3)\n> \n> Position 9: old position 8 = (4,2)\n> \n> Position 10: old position 9 = (4,1)\n> \n> Position 11: old position 10 = (3,1)\n> \n> Position 12: old position 11 = (2,1)\n> \n> Position 13: old position 12 = (1,1)\n> \n> Position 14: old position 13 = (1,2)\n> \n> And old position 14 (1,3) is removed.\n> \n> So (3,1) is now at position 11, still occupied.\n> \n> After another move, it will be at position 10, and so on.\n> \n> It will take several moves for the segment at (3,1) to become the tail.\n> \n> Currently, it is at index 10, and the tail is index 14, so it needs 4 moves to become the tail, and on the 5th move, it will be cut, freeing the cell.\n> \n> Let's calculate the distance to tail.\n> \n> The segment at (3,1) is position 10 from head, but the tail is position 14, so it is 4 positions away from tail.\n> \n> Index head 0, tail 14, so for a segment at index k, it is (14 - k) positions from the tail.\n> \n> For k=10, 14-10=4, so it is 4 segments from the tail.\n> \n> Therefore, after 4 moves without growth, this segment will be at the tail position and will be cut on the 5th move.\n> \n> After 4 moves, the segment that was at index 10 will be at index 14 (tail), and on the 5th move, when head moves, this tail is cut, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,5), it is index 3, so from tail: 14-3=11 positions away, so it will take 11 moves to become tail, and 12th move to be cut.\n> \n> But we have food there, so if I eat it, the snake grows, so it won't be cut.\n> \n> But for now, to free the cell, I need to not eat food for several turns.\n> \n> For (3,1) with life span 2, it can only be eaten on turn 66 or 67.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need the cell free, which requires at least 4 moves without growth to free it, but after 4 moves, it will be turn 70, but the food disappears at turn 68, so it's impossible to eat (3,1) because I can't free the cell in time.\n> \n> Life span 2: on turn 66, it exists;

Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after this turn, it might disappear if life span was 1? Life span is given as 1, and it's turn 67, so after this turn, it should disappear because life span decreases on the current turn.

(3,1) is part of the snake body. From the list, (3,1) is the 11th segment? Let's index:\n> \n> Index 0: head (3,4)\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,6)\n> \n> 3: (4,6)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (5,5)\n> \n> 6: (5,4)\n> \n> 7: (5,3)\n> \n> 8: (4,3)\n> \n> 9: (4,2)\n> \n> 10: (4,1)\n> \n> 11: (3,1)\n> \n> 12: (2,1)\n> \n> 13: (1,1)\n> \n> 14: tail (1,2)\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is on a body segment.

Snake positions: (1,1), (1,2), but not (1,6), so it's free.\n> \n> Now, rules about food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (3,1): it has life span 1, so only available this turn. But it's under the body at position (3,1), which is segment 11. To eat it, the body must move away, meaning that segment must leave (3,1), and then head moves to (3,1).\n> \n> But head is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (3,1). (3,1) is three cells away vertically? (3,4) to (3,1) is down 3 steps? y=4 to y=1, since down decreases y, so (3,4) to (3,1) is moving down three times? But let's see positions.\n> \n> Head (3,4), then to (3,1) is possible by moving down, but there are cells in between: (3,4), then next would be (3,3) if down, but snake has segments at (3,5), (3,6), etc., but (3,3) is empty? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> I should sketch a grid.\n> \n> Make a simple grid, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Mark walls: borders are all walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle? But snake head is at (3,4), and (4,4) is listed as internal obstacle? That can't be right because if (4,4) is obstacle, snake can't be there, but snake positions include (5,4), (4,3), etc., not (4,4) itself? Let's list snake positions and obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (4,4) is listed as obstacle, but is it occupied by snake? Snake has (4,5), (4,6), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), but not (4,4). So (4,4) is an obstacle, meaning snake cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, (5,6) obstacle, (6,3) obstacle.\n> \n> Also borders.\n> \n> Food: (3,1) with life 1, (4,5) with life 7, (1,6) with life 10.\n> \n> (4,5) is also a snake position! (4,5) is the 4th segment, so food is under body at (4,5).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is snake position.\n> \n> Only (1,6) is free.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate actions.\n> \n> Current turn t=67.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction D (down, so y-1).\n> \n> Possible moves: not up, so D, L, R.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,3)\n> \n> - Left: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,4)\n> \n> But (4,4) is an obstacle!

Obstacles include (2,4), so cannot move left.\n> \n> Down to (3,3): is (3,3) free? Let's see what is at (3,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: not listed, so probably free, but need to check if wall or obstacle.\n> \n> (3,3): not border, not in internal obstacles, so free.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake will move, tail will move, etc.\n> \n> So from (3,4), moving down to (3,3) is possible.\n> \n> Is there any other option? Left to (2,4) is obstacle, right to (4,4) is obstacle, up is not allowed because reverse from down.\n> \n> Current direction down, so moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (3,3).\n> \n> But let's confirm: directions from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by snake body segment. Also, moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,3), which is free, no wall, no obstacle, not occupied by snake? Snake has positions at y=1,2,3? (4,3), (5,3), but not (3,3). (3,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,4), but (2,4) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,4), internal obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is down to (3,3).\n> \n> But the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, food considerations.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) has life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn. But it's under the snake body at (3,1). To eat it, the body must move away and head must move to it.\n> \n> But head is at (3,4), and (3,1) is three cells away. In one turn, I can only move one cell, so I can't reach (3,1) in this turn. Even if I move down, I go to (3,3), not closer to (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is at y=1, head at y=4, so to reach (3,1) I need to go down three times, but in three turns, the food will be gone because life span 1, decreases this turn, so after turn 67, it disappears, so I can't eat it at all. Since life span decreases on current turn, and it was 1, it means it's available only on turn 67, but after turn 67, it's gone.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> For food with life span N, it appears and counts down each turn, disappearing when countdown reaches 0 after the turn it was supposed to be eaten or something.\n> \n> The state is given at turn t1=67, with food having life span L.\n> \n> After turn t1, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> If life span was 1, after turn 67, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So on turn 67, if head moves to the food cell, it can be eaten, but only if the cell is free or if it was under body and body moves away.\n> \n> But for (3,1), it is occupied by body, so head cannot move to it directly; the body must move away first.\n> \n> But on this turn, head is not at (3,1), so I can't eat it this turn. Even if I could, it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Since life span 1, after this turn it's gone, so impossible to eat (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,5), it has life span 7, so it will last until turn 73 or something. Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 67, life span 7, so after turn 67, it decreases to 6, then to 5, etc., so it disappears after turn 67 + 7 - 1? Better to think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> Life span L means it will disappear after L turns from now, including the current turn.\n> \n> So if L=7 at turn 67, it will be present on turns 67,68,69,70,71,72, and disappear after turn 73? Let's see.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span L, it is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, L=1 at t=67: present only on turn 67, gone on turn 68.\n> \n> L=7 at t=67: present on turns 67,68,69,70,71,72,73? From turn t to t + L - 1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span decreases each turn including current, then at turn t with L, after turn t, L becomes L-1, and when L=0 after a turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for L=1: at turn 67, L=1, after turn 67, it becomes 0 and disappears, so can only be eaten on turn 67.\n> \n> For L=7: at turn 67, L=7, after turn 67, L=6, ..., after turn 72, L=1, after turn 73, L=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 67 to 73 inclusive? After turn 73, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 73 when L=1 before decreasing.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> - Start of turn 67: food with life span L is present.\n> \n> - During turn 67, if head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> - After turn 67, life span decreases to L-1.\n> \n> - If L-1 >0, it remains; if L-1=0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for other turns.\n> \n> For food at (3,1): L=1 at turn 67. So on turn 67, it is present, but if not eaten, after turn 67 it disappears. Since head is not at (3,1) and not moving there this turn (only moving to (3,3)), it won't be eaten, so it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): L=7, so it will be present until after turn 73 decreases to 0? After turn 73: at start turn 73, L=1, can be eaten on turn 73; after turn 73, L=0, disappears.\n> \n> So available from turn 67 to 73.\n> \n> (1,6): L=10, available until turn 76 or something.\n> \n> But back to immediate move.\n> \n> On turn 67, only possible move is down to (3,3), since other directions are blocked by obstacles.\n> \n> So action for turn 67 must be D.\n> \n> Then, after moving down, new head position (3,3), and the tail will move forward, so the last segment (1,2) will be removed, and new head at (3,3).\n> \n> Snake was: head (3,4) -> move D to (3,3), so new positions: head (3,3), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, so snake becomes [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] and tail was (1,2), which is removed, but when head moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten; since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and if no food, tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> Here, moving to (3,3), no food there, so tail (1,2) is removed, and the segment before tail, (1,1), becomes the new tail?

will move when the head moves in a way that the body shifts.\n> \n> For instance, if the head moves down or left, the body will follow, so the cell (4,5) will be vacated when that particular segment moves to a new position.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,5), so it can be eaten only when the head is at (4,5) after it is free.\n> \n> Since the body is moving, (4,5) will be free when the segment leaves it, but at the same time, the head might not be there.\n> \n> I need to coordinate so that when (4,5) is free, the head moves to it.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (4,5) will move to where the previous segment was when the head moves.\n> \n> In the current configuration, the segment at (4,5) is position 5 in the list after turn 67: positions: 0:(3,3), 1:(3,4), 2:(3,5), 3:(3,6), 4:(4,6), 5:(4,5), 6:(5,5), etc.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, say to (3,2) on turn 68, then position 5 will move to position 4's old position, which is (4,6)?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end cell is vacated, and all body segments shift towards the head.\n> \n> So new head position is the move cell, then the previous head becomes the neck, and so on, last body segment is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (3,2):\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,2), then previous head (3,3) is now first body segment, then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). The tail (1,1) is removed, so snake has 14 segments now?

Internal obstacles: (2,4) is one, but (2,3) not listed. Snake body: positions include (3,3), (3,4), etc., but (2,3) not in list. Current positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) — (3,3) is at (3,3), not (2,3). (2,3) is not occupied, so should be free.\n> \n> D: to (2,1)\n> \n> (2,1): not border, not internal obstacle. Snake body: positions have (4,1) and (3,1), but (2,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (4,5), (1,6), (6,2)\n> \n> But (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake! Look at snake positions: index [7]: (4,5) is part of the body. Food at (4,5) with life span 5, value 1.\n> \n> Rule: food can spawn under snake body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so we can't eat it now. It will be eatable only if the snake moves away from it and head comes back when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,6) not occupied, (6,2) not occupied.\n> \n> Life span: food disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Current turn 70, so for (4,5): life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 70+5 = turn 75? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 70, life span 5, meaning it has 5 turns left, including turn 70. So after turn 74, it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases each turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span L, so it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1, present only at turn t, disappears at turn t+1.\n> \n> If L=2, present at turn t and t+1, disappears at turn t+2.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,5): life span 5 at turn 70, so present from turn 70 to 74, disappears at turn 75.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life span 7, present from 70 to 76, disappears at 77.\n> \n> (6,2): life span 10, present from 70 to 79, disappears at 80.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves for turn 70.\n> \n> Head at (2,2), direction L.\n> \n> Options: L to (1,2), U to (2,3), D to (2,1)\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (3,1), and after move, tail moves to (4,1) or something.\n> \n> Let's list the grid to see free cells.\n> \n> First, walls: all border cells are walls, so cells (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.\n> \n> Also internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So obstacles: (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) — that's borders.\n> \n> And (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n> \n> Now snake occupies: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So free cells are all others.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) but occupied, so not accessible now; (1,6) free; (6,2) free.\n> \n> Now, for turn 70, I need to choose a move.\n> \n> I should aim to eat food but avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, note the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (3,1), and food is not on tail, food is at (4,5) on body, not tail, and (1,6), (6,2) not on tail.\n> \n> So no immediate danger there.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate possible moves for turn 70.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (1,2)\n> \n> Then head to (1,2), body follows, tail at (4,1) or something.\n> \n> After move: head at (1,2), then body: [1] to (2,2), [2] to (3,2), [3] to (3,3), ..., up to tail [14] to (4,1) — old [13] was (4,1), new tail at old [13] position.\n> \n> Old positions: [13] (4,1), [14] (3,1)\n> \n> After move, new head (1,2), new [1] = old [0] (2,2), new [2] = old [1] (3,2), new [3] = old [2] (3,3), ..., new [13] = old [12] (4,2)?

Internal obstacles are given: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Current turn is 71.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,1), and the body segments follow: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 cells long.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is (x,y-1). Since it's moving Down, that means from (2,1), moving Down would go to (2,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. But the head is at (2,1) and direction is D, so it must have moved to (2,1) from above? Let's see the positions: the snake positions are listed from head to tail: (2,1) is head, then (2,2), which is above it, so yes, it was moving Down to (2,1) from (2,2) previous turn. But now, at (2,1), moving Down would be to (2,0), which is a wall, so it can't go Down. But the direction is given as D, but that might be the current facing direction, not necessarily the only possible move.\n> \n> I need to find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (2,1). Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> - U (Up): to (2,2) – but (2,2) is a body segment? Snake positions: head (2,1), then (2,2) is the next segment. Since the snake moves, when it moves, the tail will move, so moving to (2,2) might be possible if that segment is the tail and will move away.\n> \n> The body collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail is safe because the tail moves, so it won't be there when the head arrives. But other body segments, it would collide.\n> \n> In this case, positions: [(2,1), (2,2), ...] so (2,2) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is at (4,1), I think. Let's list all positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (2,1) head\n> \n> 1: (2,2)\n> \n> 2: (3,2)\n> \n> 3: (3,3)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (3,5)\n> \n> 6: (3,6)\n> \n> 7: (4,6)\n> \n> 8: (4,5)\n> \n> 9: (5,5)\n> \n> 10: (5,4)\n> \n> 11: (5,3)\n> \n> 12: (4,3)\n> \n> 13: (4,2)\n> \n> 14: (4,1) tail\n> \n> So tail is at (4,1). Now, possible moves from head (2,1):\n> \n> - U (Up) to (2,2): currently occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail. So if I move there, head would be at (2,2), but segment 1 is still there, and since it's not the tail moving away, it would cause collision. After move, the new head position is (2,2), and the body segments shift: the old head becomes part of body, so positions become: new head at (2,2), then old body from (2,2) to (4,1) but shifted.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated if no food is eaten, but if food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But for collision: after moving, the head should not be on the same cell as any body segment except possibly the former tail if it moves.\n> \n> Standard rule: if you move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's safe because the tail moves forward, so that cell becomes empty. If you move to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment, it causes collision because that segment doesn't move immediately; only the head moves first, then body shifts.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,1), moving U to (2,2): (2,2) is currently segment 1, which is not the tail. After move, head is at (2,2), and segment 1 would be at... let's simulate: new positions: head moves to (2,2), then the segment that was at (2,2) moves to where? No, the body segments: the first body segment becomes the new position of the old head, but since we're moving to (2,2), which was occupied, it's messy.\n> \n> Better to think: the cell (2,2) is occupied by the first body segment. If I move head to (2,2), at that moment, the head and that segment are on the same cell, which causes collision. Even though the segment might move, the collision is checked before the body moves, I think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\" And \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for non-tail segments, moving to them causes collision.\n> \n> Here, (2,2) is not the tail; tail is (4,1). So moving U to (2,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (2,0): y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Moving L to (1,1): x=1, y=1. Is this wall? Walls: border x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (1,1) should be within bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (1,1) is not an obstacle, so it should be free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc., no (1,1), so it should be empty. But let's confirm all positions: from list, all are from x=2 to5, y=1 to6, no (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n> \n> Moving R to (3,1): (3,1) is not in snake positions? Positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3),..., (4,1), no (3,1). (4,1) is tail, but (3,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So cells occupied: let's list all: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So (3,1) not occupied, (1,1) not occupied.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,1) is x=1,y=1, within 1-6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (5,6) is obstacle, (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> So back to moves from (2,1):\n> \n> - U: to (2,2) - occupied by body (segment 1), not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: to (2,0) - y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (1,1) - not occupied, not wall, not obstacle. Internal obstacles are (1,4), not (1,1), so free. So possible.\n> \n> - R: to (3,1) - not occupied, not wall, not obstacle. Possible.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current head direction is D (down). Moving opposite would be U (up). But since moving U is invalid due to body, it's not an option anyway. Moving L or R are not opposite to D, so allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life_span 4? The format is (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Let's see: \" (4, 5, 4, 1) \" so (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (1,6,6,1) and (6,2,9,1). Value is +1 for all, so all positive food? It says value1, etc., and in the list, all have value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,5) life_span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 71, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 74? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So if at turn t, life_span N, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + (N-1): countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: disappears, not available.\n> \n> So for (4,5) at turn 71, life_span 4, so available on turns 71,72,73,74? Countdown: turn 71: 4, turn 72:3, turn73:2, turn74:1, then turn75: gone. Since it decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n> \n> And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span N:\n> \n> - It is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, inclusive? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is N.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown becomes N-1 at turn t+1.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> At turn t + (N-1), countdown is 1.\n> \n> Then at turn t + N, it disappears, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> So for (4,5): available on turns 71,72,73,74? Turn 71: countdown 4, so present. Turn 72: countdown 3, present. Turn 73: countdown 2, present. Turn 74: countdown 1, present. Turn 75: countdown 0 or gone, not present.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life_span 6 at turn 71, so available turns 71 to 76? Turn 71: countdown 6, present; ... turn 76: countdown 1, present; turn 77: gone.\n> \n> (6,2): life_span 9, available turns 71 to 79.\n> \n> All value +1.\n> \n> Now, special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, food at (4,5). Is it under snake body?\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,5) is in the list? Positions: (4,5) is index 8, since (4,6) is 7, (4,5) is 8, (5,5) is 9, etc. So (4,5) is occupied by the snake body, segment 8.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,6) - not in snake positions? Snake: (3,6) is 6, (4,6) is 7, no (1,6), so not under snake.\n> \n> (6,2) - snake has (5,3), (4,3), etc., no (6,2), so not under snake.\n> \n> So only (4,5) is under snake body, at position (4,5), which is segment 8 of the snake.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake must move so that this body part moves away, and then head moves onto (4,5).\n> \n> Since the snake moves, if the body moves from (4,5), then (4,5) becomes free, and if head moves there later, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But currently, at turn 71, head is at (2,1), far away.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, from current position, I have two choices: move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all cells occupied:\n> \n> - Row y=1: (2,1), (4,1)  [head and tail? (2,1) head, (4,1) tail, also (4,2) etc.]\n> \n> Better to visualize:\n> \n> I'll make a grid:\n> \n> y=6: cells (1,6) to (6,6)\n> \n> But obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, so (5,6) blocked.\n> \n> Also, snake: (3,6) at y=6.\n> \n> List per row.\n> \n> Row y=6: x=1: free? (1,6) has food, not snake. Snake has (3,6), and (4,6), but (4,6) is snake, (5,6) obstacle, (6,6) free? Internal obstacles only given, borders not cells.\n> \n> (1,6) is food position, not obstacle.\n> \n> So y=6:\n> \n> x=1: food? (1,6) is food, not snake.\n> \n> x=2: free? No snake, no obstacle.\n> \n> x=3: snake (3,6)\n> \n> x=4: snake (4,6)\n> \n> x=5: obstacle (5,6)\n> \n> x=6: free? No.\n> \n> But (6,6) is within bounds, no obstacle listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, y=5:\n> \n> x=1: free? (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed, so free? Obstacles are specific cells: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), etc., so (1,5) not obstacle.\n> \n> Snake: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is food under snake, but occupied.\n> \n> (5,5) snake.\n> \n> y=4: x=1: obstacle (1,4)? (1,4) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> x=2: obstacle (2,4)? (2,4) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> x=3: snake (3,4)\n> \n> x=4: obstacle (4,4)? (4,4) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> x=5: snake (5,4)\n> \n> x=6: free? (6,4) not obstacle, no snake.\n> \n> But (6,3) is obstacle, so (6,4) free.\n> \n> y=3: x=1: free\n> \n> x=2: free? Snake: (3,3) at x=3,y=3, (5,3) at x=5,y=3, (4,3) at x=4,y=3.\n> \n> Also (6,3) obstacle.\n> \n> So y=3: x=1 free, x=2 free? Snake positions: (3,3), (5,3), (4,3), no (2,3) or (1,3), so x=1 and x=2 free for y=3? x=1,y=3.\n> \n> But (2,4) is obstacle at y=4, not y=3.\n> \n> y=3: x=1: free, x=2: free, x=3: snake (3,3), x=4: snake (4,3), x=5: snake (5,3), x=6: obstacle (6,3)\n> \n> y=2: x=1: free, x=2: snake (2,2), x=3: snake (3,2), x=4: snake (4,2), x=5: free? (5,2) not occupied, no obstacle, x=6: free? (6,2) has food, but not occupied yet.\n> \n> y=1: x=1: if I move L, it's (1,1), free. x=2: snake head (2,1), x=3: free? (3,1) not occupied, x=4: snake tail (4,1), x=5: free, x=6: free.\n> \n> Back to current move: head at (2,1), can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (4,5) under body at segment 8. To eat it, that part must move away. The snake is moving, so eventually that cell will be free when the snake moves forward, but only if no food is eaten, the tail moves, so the cell (4,5) might be vacated if the snake doesn't eat food and moves.\n> \n> Currently, the snake is long, 15 segments.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,1). If the snake doesn't eat food, when it moves, the tail moves, so cells are vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, for (4,5), it is occupied by segment 8. When the snake moves, depending on the move, the position shifts.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves left or right, the head moves, tail moves, so segment 8 might move to a different cell.\n> \n> But (4,5) will be vacated only if the snake moves in a way that this segment is no longer there, which happens as the snake slithers.\n> \n> Since the snake is a sequence, when it moves, the body segments follow the path.\n> \n> To free (4,5), since it's not the tail, we need to move so that the segment that was at (4,5) moves to another position.\n> \n> But it will happen naturally as the snake moves, unless the snake eats food and grows, then that segment stays or something.\n> \n> Let's think: when snake moves without eating, all segments shift: head to new position, each body segment to the previous position of the segment before it, tail vacates.\n> \n> So for cell (4,5), currently occupied by segment 8. After one move without eating, the snake moves, segment 8 will move to the position of segment 7, which was (4,6), so segment 8 moves to (4,6), and (4,5) is vacated? Not necessarily, because segment 9 moves to where segment 8 was, etc.\n> \n> Let's simulate a move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 71, snake positions: indices 0 to 14: 0:(2,1), 1:(2,2), 2:(3,2), 3:(3,3), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,5), 6:(3,6), 7:(4,6), 8:(4,5), 9:(5,5), 10:(5,4), 11:(5,3), 12:(4,3), 13:(4,2), 14:(4,1)\n> \n> If the snake moves, say, to (3,1), so new head position (3,1). Since no food eaten, tail is removed, so new positions: head (3,1), then the old positions from index 0 to 13 become the new body, so:\n> \n> New head: (3,1)  // moved to (3,1)\n> \n> Then body: old head (2,1) becomes segment 1, old segment 1 (2,2) becomes segment 2, old segment 2 (3,2) becomes segment 3, ..., up to old segment 13 (4,2) becomes segment 14, and old tail (4,1) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,1), seg1 (2,1), seg2 (2,2), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (3,3), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (3,5), seg7 (3,6), seg8 (4,6), seg9 (4,5), seg10 (5,5), seg11 (5,4), seg12 (5,3), seg13 (4,3), seg14 (4,2)\n> \n> Old segment 14 was (4,1), removed.\n> \n> Now, what about (4,5)? Previously it was occupied by seg8 (4,5). After move, seg9 is now at (4,5)? New seg9 is old seg8, which was at (4,5), but in new positions, seg9 is at (4,5) because old seg8 became new seg9 at same position? Let's see:\n> \n> New segments:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1) new\n> \n> - Seg1: old head (2,1)\n> \n> - Seg2: old seg1 (2,2)\n> \n> - Seg3: old seg2 (3,2)\n> \n> - Seg4: old seg3 (3,3)\n> \n> - Seg5: old seg4 (3,4)\n> \n> - Seg6: old seg5 (3,5)\n> \n> - Seg7: old seg6 (3,6)\n> \n> - Seg8: old seg7 (4,6)  // which was at (4,6)\n> \n> - Seg9: old seg8 (4,5)  // at (4,5)\n> \n> - Seg10: old seg9 (5,5)  // at (5,5)\n> \n> - Seg11: old seg10 (5,4)  // at (5,4)\n> \n> - Seg12: old seg11 (5,3)  // at (5,3)\n> \n> - Seg13: old seg12 (4,3)  // at (4,3)\n> \n> - Seg14: old seg13 (4,2)  // at (4,2)\n> \n> So (4,5) is still occupied by new seg9.\n> \n> Similarly, if the snake moves in another direction, (4,5) might remain occupied for a while.\n> \n> To free (4,5), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment at (4,5) moves away and no other segment occupies it immediately, but since the snake is contiguous, when the head moves, the body follows, so (4,5) will be vacated only when the tail passes that point, but the tail is at (4,1), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (4,5).\n> \n> The distance from tail to (4,5): tail at (4,1), (4,5) is 4 steps up, but the snake path is not direct.\n> \n> The snake has a long body, so (4,5) will be occupied until the tail end moves past it.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,5) is currently seg8, which is 8 segments from head, but from tail, tail is seg14, so seg8 is 6 segments from tail? Let's see indices: head 0, tail 14, so seg8 is position 8, so 14-8=6 segments away from tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves without eating, each move the tail moves forward, so it takes 6 moves for the tail to reach where seg8 was, but since the body moves, it's not the same cell.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the cell that was occupied by a segment i will be occupied by segment i+k if i+k <= length, else vacated.\n> \n> But in this case, for cell (4,5), it is occupied by seg8. After 1 move, as above, it is still occupied by seg9 (old seg8). After 2 moves, it would be occupied by seg10 if the head moves, and so on, until after m moves, when the tail has moved m times, and if m is large enough, the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, since the snake is moving, the cell (4,5) will be occupied until the segment that is currently at the tail position has moved past it, but it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (4,5) will be free when the tail has moved enough that the part of the snake that was covering it has advanced.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (4,5) is part of the body, and it will take at least the number of segments from there to the tail for it to be vacated, but only if no food is eaten.\n> \n> Number of segments from seg8 to tail: seg8,9,10,11,12,13,14, that's 7 segments, so after 7 moves without eating, the tail would have moved, and (4,5) might be vacated.\n> \n> For example, after 7 moves no eat, the cell that was seg8 will be beyond the tail.\n> \n> But in practice, the position changes.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, and (4,5) is deep in the body, it will take many turns to free it, and by that time, the food might expire.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) has life_span 4, so it disappears after turn 74, so only available for 4 turns: 71,72,73,74.\n> \n> At turn 71, it's there, but occupied.\n> \n> To eat it, we need to have the head move to (4,5) when it is free and food is present.\n> \n> But it's occupied now, and with life_span 4, it might not be possible to free it in time.\n> \n> For instance, to free (4,5), we need the snake to move such that the body leaves that cell, which requires the head to move away and the tail to catch up, but with 15 length, it takes time.\n> \n> Perhaps it's not feasible to eat (4,5) within 4 turns.\n> \n> Let's estimate: the shortest path from head to (4,5) is from (2,1) to (4,5), which is |4-2| + |5-1| = 2+4=6 moves, but there are obstacles and body, so more.\n> \n> But (4,5) is occupied, so head can't move there directly.\n> \n> First, we need to free (4,5).\n> \n> The tail is at (4,1), so if we move the head in a way that the tail moves towards (4,5), but the snake is coiled, it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, since (4,5) has short life and is under body, it might not be worth pursuing, especially with the risk.\n> \n> There is a special risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,1), no food there.\n> \n> Other food: (1,6) at (1,6), value 1, life_span 6, so available until turn 76.\n> \n> (6,2) at (6,2), value 1, life_span 9, available until turn 79.\n> \n> Both are not under snake.\n> \n> So possible to go for those.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: from (2,1), move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> If I move L to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction L or D?

It's turn 72, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning x from 0 to 7, but since walls occupy those, the snake can only be on x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Snake positions are given, like (3,1), which is within 1 to 6 for both, so yes, grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)] – these are cells the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). That's 15 segments. Head direction is R (right), so moving east.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n> \n> Current turn is t=72. For food at (4,5), life span 3, so it disappears at turn 72 + 3 - 1? Let's think: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns including the current one? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1, it disappears at the end of this turn. If L=2, it disappears at the end of next turn, etc.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, food has life span L, meaning it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Rule: \"disappears after N turns\" – \"after N turns\" might be ambiguous. But it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so let's interpret.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. If countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So, with N=3 at turn 72:\n> \n> - Turn 72: countdown 3, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 73: countdown 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 74: countdown 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 74, countdown 0, disappears before turn 75.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,6): life span 5 at turn 72, so can be eaten turns 72 to 76, disappears before 77.\n> \n> Food at (6,2): life span 8, turns 72 to 79.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,1), moving right, so direction R. Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move R (continue right), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that's instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move L.\n> \n> So from (3,1), moving R, next moves can be R, U, or D.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state to find safe moves and plan for food.\n> \n> First, draw a grid mentally. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,1)\n> \n> Body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)\n> \n> List the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,1) head\n> \n> 1: (2,1)\n> \n> 2: (2,2)\n> \n> 3: (3,2)\n> \n> 4: (3,3)\n> \n> 5: (3,4)\n> \n> 6: (3,5)\n> \n> 7: (3,6)\n> \n> 8: (4,6)\n> \n> 9: (4,5)\n> \n> 10: (5,5)\n> \n> 11: (5,4)\n> \n> 12: (5,3)\n> \n> 13: (4,3)\n> \n> 14: (4,2) tail\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (4,5) – but (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake?

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only the tail cell is safe to move into, because after move, the tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> Here, (3,1) is not the tail; it's the first body segment. Tail is (4,3). So moving to (3,1) would cause collision because (3,1) is occupied and will not be vacated immediately; only the tail vacates when moving.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead\n> \n> - Tail moves away from its position\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment other than the current tail, that segment hasn't moved yet, so collision.\n> \n> If head moves to the current tail position, tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,1), moving left to (3,1): (3,1) is occupied by the second segment. After head moves to (3,1), the second segment would need to move to where? But since head is moving to (3,1), which is where segment 1 is, it would cause collision because segment 1 is still there when head arrives.\n> \n> Only if moving to the tail position, it might be ok.\n> \n> But here, (3,1) is not tail; tail is (4,3).\n> \n> So moving to (3,1) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (5,1): (5,1) - let's see if occupied.\n> \n> (5,1) not in snake positions: snake has (4,1), (3,1), etc., (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), but not (5,1). (5,2) not mentioned, (5,1) should be free? x=5,y=1.\n> \n> y=1, x=5. Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not border. x=5, x=7 is wall, so x=5<7, ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6) etc., not (5,1).\n> \n> So (5,1) should be empty.\n> \n> But there is food at (6,1), but (5,1) is different.\n> \n> (5,1) is empty.\n> \n> Now, moving down to (4,0): y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving up to (4,2): (4,2) not occupied, as per positions.\n> \n> (4,2) is not in snake positions list, so free.\n> \n> Now, what about (5,1)? For move R to (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n> \n> But direction is R, so moving R is possible.\n> \n> Cannot move L, as opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2), R to (5,1), D is invalid.\n> \n> Only U and R are possible, since L is opposite and D is wall.\n> \n> D to (4,0) is wall, yes.\n> \n> So actions: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 74 or it disappears. After turn 74 it's gone.\n> \n> At turn 73, life span 2: after turn 73, countdown to 1; at turn 74, if not eaten, after turn 74 countdown to 0, disappears.\n> \n> So to eat it, must be eaten on turn 73 or 74.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) life span 4: disappears after turn 76.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 7: disappears after turn 79.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 10: disappears after turn 82.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), or R to (5,1).\n> \n> First, let's see the path to food.\n> \n> Food at (4,5): that's on the grid, but (4,5) is currently occupied by the snake! Look at snake positions: (4,5) is listed, it's the 10th segment or something.\n> \n> Snake positions include (4,5), so it's under the body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,5) has food and is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake must move so that (4,5) is vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> But life span is short, only 2 turns left.\n> \n> Now, where is (4,5) in the snake? From positions: index 10: (4,5), which is the 11th segment? Indices: 0:head (4,1), 1:(3,1), 2:(2,1), 3:(2,2), 4:(3,2), 5:(3,3), 6:(3,4), 7:(3,5), 8:(3,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(4,5), 11:(5,5), 12:(5,4), 13:(5,3), 14:(4,3)\n> \n> So (4,5) is segment 10, which is not tail; tail is 14:(4,3).\n> \n> To vacate (4,5), the snake needs to move so that this segment moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake moves forward, segments move to previous positions.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves in a certain way, (4,5) might be vacated after some moves.\n> \n> But life span only 2 turns.\n> \n> At turn 73, head at (4,1). If I move up to (4,2), then head to (4,2), body segments shift: the tail (4,3) moves to where? Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list with indices for clarity.\n> \n> Assume segments S0 to S14, S0=head (4,1), S1=(3,1), S2=(2,1), S3=(2,2), S4=(3,2), S5=(3,3), S6=(3,4), S7=(3,5), S8=(3,6), S9=(4,6), S10=(4,5), S11=(5,5), S12=(5,4), S13=(5,3), S14=tail (4,3)\n> \n> If head moves to new position, say to P.\n> \n> Then new head at P, S0 moves to P, S1 moves to old S0, S2 to old S1, ..., S14 moves to old S13 position, and old S14 is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, old tail S14 at (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> For S10 at (4,5), it will move to the position of S9 when the snake moves.\n> \n> S9 is (4,6), so if head moves, S10 will move to where S9 was, which is (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (4,5) will be occupied by S10 only if it doesn't move, but it does move.\n> \n> After head moves:\n> \n> - New S0 at new head position\n> \n> - S1 at old S0 position (4,1)\n> \n> - S2 at old S1 position (3,1)\n> \n> - and so on, up to S14 at old S13 position.\n> \n> Old S13 is (5,3), so new tail at (5,3)\n> \n> Old S14 at (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, for (4,5): currently occupied by S10. After move, S10 moves to where S9 was, which is (4,6), so (4,5) is no longer occupied by snake, because S10 has moved to (4,6).\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment ahead.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - The segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 for i>0, but since head moves, it's:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New position of segment k is the old position of segment k-1 for k from 1 to len-1? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment that was ahead of it, so the second segment moves to where head was, third to where second was, etc., and the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So for any segment except the head, it moves to the position that was previously occupied by the segment immediately closer to the head.\n> \n> For cell (4,5), it is currently occupied by S10.\n> \n> After the snake moves, S10 will move to where S9 was, which is (4,6), so (4,5) becomes empty, because no segment is moving to it; S10 is leaving it.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell where S9 was, (4,6), will now be occupied by S10.\n> \n> And the tail S14 leaves (4,3), which becomes empty.\n> \n> So, after any move, all cells except the new head position and the new body positions are vacated, but specifically, the cell that was occupied by a segment might be vacated if that segment moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,5), after one move, it will be vacated because S10 moves to (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, after move, (4,5) is empty.\n> \n> Then, if the head moves to (4,5), it can eat the food there.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,5), and after move, (4,5) is empty, so head can move there on the next turn.\n> \n> Now, at turn 73, head at (4,1).\n> \n> If I move up to (4,2) at turn 73.\n> \n> Then after move:\n> \n> Head moves to (4,2)\n> \n> Then body:\n> \n> S1 moves to old S0 (4,1)\n> \n> S2 moves to old S1 (3,1)\n> \n> S3 moves to old S2 (2,1)\n> \n> S4 moves to old S3 (2,2)\n> \n> S5 moves to old S4 (3,2)\n> \n> S6 moves to old S5 (3,3)\n> \n> S7 moves to old S6 (3,4)\n> \n> S8 moves to old S7 (3,5)\n> \n> S9 moves to old S8 (3,6)\n> \n> S10 moves to old S9 (4,6)  // S10 was at (4,5), moves to (4,6)\n> \n> S11 moves to old S10 (4,5)  // S11 was at (5,5), moves to where S10 was, (4,5)\n> \n> S12 moves to old S11 (5,5)\n> \n> S13 moves to old S12 (5,4)\n> \n> S14 moves to old S13 (5,3)  // new tail at (5,3)\n> \n> Old S14 at (4,3) vacated.\n> \n> Now, after this move, (4,5) is occupied by S11?

So coordinates range from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's see: if x=0 and x=7 are walls, then valid x are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Similarly for y: 1,2,3,4,5,6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.

But not R, since x=7 is wall, so R to (7,2) is invalid, wall. So possible: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2).\n> \n> But (6,3) is internal obstacle?

Snake positions after turn 76: after moving to (6,1) on turn 76, the positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ... and tail. (5,1) is a body segment.\n> \n> So moving L to (5,1) would collide with body.\n> \n> R to (7,1) is wall, x=7.\n> \n> So no valid moves from (6,1) after that? That means if I go to (6,2) and then to (6,1), I get stuck and die on the next turn.\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> After turn 75: move R to (6,2), eat food, positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — and since ate food, a new segment is added, but where? When snake eats food, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is added at the end, but since we don't move the tail, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat food, on that turn, the head moves to food, but the tail stays in place, so length increases by one. So after moving to (6,2), the snake has segments: (6,2) [head], (5,2) [neck], (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (5,4) [tail], and since ate food, no tail movement, so tail is still (5,4), but now there is an extra segment, so the body includes (5,4) and the segment before it.\n> \n> Positions before move: 15 segments.\n> \n> After move to (6,2) and eat: head to (6,2), previous head (5,2) becomes second, and so on, tail (5,4) remains, but since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake now has 16 segments: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — (5,4) is tail, and (5,5) is before tail.\n> \n> List: index 0: (6,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (2,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (4,5), 14: (5,5), 15: (5,4) — so 16 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now from (6,2), only possible move is D to (6,1), since U to (6,3) wall, L to (5,2) body, R to (7,2) wall.\n> \n> So move D to (6,1) on turn 76.\n> \n> (6,1) has food, so eat it, grow to 17 segments.\n> \n> Head now at (6,1), direction D.\n> \n> Positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — and tail (5,4) still, but after eating, tail doesn't move, so new tail is added? After eating at (6,1), head to (6,1), previous segments, and tail remains, so positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), ..., up to (5,4), and since ate, length 17, so the last segment is (5,4), but (5,4) was tail, now it's followed by nothing, but we add a segment, so the tail is still at (5,4) for now? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, each segment moves, but tail stays, so the cell that was tail is now occupied by the new segment, and tail is still there, but since tail didn't move, the snake extends.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) and eating: positions: head (6,2), neck (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), ..., (5,5), (5,4) — (5,4) is tail.\n> \n> Now move to (6,1) and eat: head to (6,1), so new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2) [previous head], then (5,2) [previous neck], then (5,1), (4,1), ..., and so on, up to (5,4) still tail? When we move, all segments shift: the segment that was at (6,2) moves to where? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, the first body segment moves to the head's previous position, second to first's previous, and so on, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, and the cell is freed if no growth.\n> \n> But when eating, the tail does not move, so the head occupies the food cell, and the body shifts, but the tail remains, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating at (6,2), the new head is (6,2), and the body from neck to the segment before tail are the same as before but shifted? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move, positions: A = (5,2) head, B = (5,1), C = (4,1), D = (3,1), E = (2,1), F = (2,2), G = (3,2), H = (3,3), I = (3,4), J = (3,5), K = (3,6), L = (4,6), M = (4,5), N = (5,5), O = (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2) and eating: new head (6,2), then the body segments: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O — but O is tail, and since eating, tail doesn't move, so the segments are: head (6,2), then A becomes (5,2), but A was head, now it's the neck position. Better to think the list: new position 0: (6,2), position 1: previous position 0 which was (5,2), position 2: previous position 1 (5,1), ..., position 15: previous position 14 (5,4), and since ate, we add a new segment at the end, but the tail was O (5,4), and it stays, so position 15 is still (5,4), and we have a new position 16 at the same (5,4)? No.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When the snake moves to a new cell without eating, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> With eating, the head moves to the food, and the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the last position is not vacated, and the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: the new head is the food cell. Then the previous head becomes the new neck, and so on, down to the tail, which remains in place.\n> \n> For example, before move: segments S0, S1, S2, ..., S14 where S0=head (5,2), S1= (5,1), S2=(4,1), ..., S14=tail (5,4).\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) and eating: new head S0' = (6,2), new S1' = S0 = (5,2), new S2' = S1 = (5,1), new S3' = S2 = (4,1), ..., new S14' = S13 = (5,5), and new S15' = S14 = (5,4) — but S14 was tail, now it's S15', and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so there is a new S15' at the position of the old tail, but the old tail position is now S15', and S14' is the segment before.\n> \n> In terms of cells: the cell (5,4) is still occupied by the tail, but now it's the 15th segment, and the 14th segment is at (5,5), which was previously occupied by the 13th segment.\n> \n> From the list: before move, positions: 0:(5,2), 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(3,1), 4:(2,1), 5:(2,2), 6:(3,2), 7:(3,3), 8:(3,4), 9:(3,5), 10:(3,6), 11:(4,6), 12:(4,5), 13:(5,5), 14:(5,4)  -- 15 segments.\n> \n> After move to (6,2) and eat: head to (6,2), so new position 0: (6,2)\n> Then position 1: previous position 0, (5,2)\n> Position 2: previous position 1, (5,1)\n> Position 3: previous position 2, (4,1)\n> ...\n> Position 14: previous position 13, (5,5)  -- since position 13 was (5,5)\n> Position 15: previous position 14, (5,4)  -- and since ate, we add a new segment at the end, so position 15 is (5,4), and position 14 is (5,5), so tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> But (5,4) was already tail, now it's still tail, but the snake has 16 segments.\n> \n> Then when we move to (6,1) and eat, similarly.\n> \n> From (6,2), move D to (6,1) on turn 76.\n> \n> (6,1) is food, so eat it.\n> \n> New head at (6,1), new position 0: (6,1)\n> Position 1: previous position 0, (6,2)\n> Position 2: previous position 1, (5,2)\n> Position 3: previous position 2, (5,1)\n> ...\n> Position 15: previous position 14, (5,5)  -- previous position 14 was (5,5)\n> Position 16: previous position 15, (5,4)  -- and add new segment, so position 16 at (5,4)\n> \n> But (5,4) is occupied, but it's the tail position.\n> \n> Now head at (6,1), direction D.\n> \n> From here, possible moves:\n> - U: to (6,2), but (6,2) is now position 1, which is body, so moving to (6,2) would collide with body.\n> - D: to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n> - L: to (5,1), (5,1) is now position 3?

It's turn 75. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,2), then body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, meaning it moved from (5,1) to (5,2) last turn? Positions are given with head first: [(5,2), (5,1), ...], so head is at (5,2), and since direction is U, it came from below, so previous head was at (5,1), which is now the neck.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after turn 77? Life span 3 means it has 3 turns including current, so after turn 75, it has 2 more turns? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,6): life span 3 at turn 75. After turn 75, life span becomes 2; after turn 76, life span 1; after turn 77, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 75, 76, or 77.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): value 1, life span 5. So disappears after turn 79? Turn 75: life 5, turn 76:4, turn 77:3, turn 78:2, turn 79:1, disappears after turn 79? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it exists for N turns starting from t, so last chance to eat is on turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (1,6): at turn 75, life span 3, so can be eaten on turns 75, 76, 77.

No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse (opposite to current direction U).\n> \n> Current head at (5,2), direction U. Possible moves: U (up to (5,3)), L (left to (4,2)), R (right to (6,2)). D is invalid.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid. I should sketch this.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. But walls are given as cells occupied, so border cells are walls, meaning we can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Head: (5,2)\n> \n> Then: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> So the snake body: from head to tail: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> Now, food at: (1,6), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> (6,2) is food, and (6,1) is also food.\n> \n> (6,2) has life span 5, (6,1) has 8.\n> \n> Current turn 75.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - U to (5,3)\n> \n> - L to (4,2)\n> \n> - R to (6,2)  -- but (6,2) is food?

Positions: head is (5,2), then ... tail is (5,4)? Let's see the list: positions end with (5,5), (5,4), so tail is (5,4).\n> \n> In the list: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] so tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Now, the head is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to tail (5,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,2) and (5,4) are two apart vertically, not adjacent. Adjacent would be like (5,2) and (5,3) or (4,2) or (6,2) or (5,1), but (5,1) is the neck.\n> \n> (5,1) is directly below, but it's part of the body, so moving there would cause collision, but since it's the neck, moving down would be into the body.\n> \n> But current direction U, so down is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,3): what is at (5,3)? From snake positions, (5,3) is not listed, so empty? But let's check the positions: snake has (5,2), (5,1), (5,5), (5,4), but no (5,3). Also, walls: no wall at (5,3), internal obstacles at (5,6), etc, not (5,3). So (5,3) is free.\n> \n> - L to (4,2): (4,2) is in snake positions? Positions: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), ... (4,2) is not listed? Let's see: after (4,1) is (3,1), then (2,1), then (2,2), then (3,2), so (4,2) is not occupied. Walls? No, so (4,2) is free.\n> \n> - R to (6,2): (6,2) is food, not occupied by snake. Wall? Borders x=7 is wall, but (6,2) is x=6, not border. Internal obstacle at (6,3), but (6,2) is clear. So moving R to (6,2) would eat the food.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (6,2), I eat the food, length increases.

R to (6,2) and eat food\n> \n> If I move R to (6,2), I eat the food, so new head position (6,2), and the snake grows, so new positions: head (6,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes neck, and tail stays, so length 16.\n> \n> Direction becomes R.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L. But not R, since x=7 is wall, so R to (7,2) is invalid, wall. So possible: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2).\n> \n> But (6,3) is internal obstacle? (6,3) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (6,1) is food, but not eaten yet.\n> \n> L to (5,2) is where the neck is, but after moving to (6,2), the neck is at (5,2), so moving back to (5,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), the snake positions become: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ... up to tail (5,4). So (5,2) is now the second segment.\n> \n> So if I move L from (6,2) to (5,2), I would be moving into the body at (5,2), which is a collision.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (6,3) is wall, cannot.\n> \n> D to (6,1) is possible, and it has food.\n> \n> (6,1) is food, so moving D to (6,1) would eat that food too.\n> \n> But let's see the state.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,2) on turn 75, I eat food, position (6,2), direction R.\n> \n> Then on turn 76, from (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,3) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - D: to (6,1), which is food, so eat it, grow to length 17.\n> \n> - L: to (5,2), which is body, collision, death.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,1), eat another food.\n> \n> Then after that, head at (6,1), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then from (6,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction D, so cannot move U, instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible: D to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n> \n> L to (5,1), which is body? Snake positions after turn 76: after moving to (6,1) on turn 76, the positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ... and tail. (5,1) is a body segment.\n> \n> So moving L to (5,1) would collide with body.\n> \n> R to (7,1) is wall, x=7.\n> \n> So no valid moves from (6,1) after that? That means if I go to (6,2) and then to (6,1), I get stuck and die on the next turn.\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> After turn 75: move R to (6,2), eat food, positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — and since ate food, a new segment is added, but where? When snake eats food, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is added at the end, but since we don't move the tail, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat food, on that turn, the head moves to food, but the tail stays in place, so length increases by one. So after moving to (6,2), the snake has segments: (6,2) [head], (5,2) [neck], (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (5,4) [tail], and since ate food, no tail movement, so tail is still (5,4), but now there is an extra segment, so the body includes (5,4) and the segment before it.\n> \n> Positions before move: 15 segments.\n> \n> After move to (6,2) and eat: head to (6,2), previous head (5,2) becomes second, and so on, tail (5,4) remains, but since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake now has 16 segments: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — (5,4) is tail, and (5,5) is before tail.\n> \n> List: index 0: (6,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (2,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (4,5), 14: (5,5), 15: (5,4) — so 16 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now from (6,2), only possible move is D to (6,1), since U to (6,3) wall, L to (5,2) body, R to (7,2) wall.\n> \n> So move D to (6,1) on turn 76.\n> \n> (6,1) has food, so eat it, grow to 17 segments.\n> \n> Head now at (6,1), direction D.\n> \n> Positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — and tail (5,4) still, but after eating, tail doesn't move, so new tail is added? After eating at (6,1), head to (6,1), previous segments, and tail remains, so positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), ..., up to (5,4), and since ate, length 17, so the last segment is (5,4), but (5,4) was tail, now it's followed by nothing, but we add a segment, so the tail is still at (5,4) for now? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, each segment moves, but tail stays, so the cell that was tail is now occupied by the new segment, and tail is still there, but since tail didn't move, the snake extends.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2) and eating: positions: head (6,2), neck (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), ..., (5,5), (5,4) — (5,4) is tail.\n> \n> Now move to (6,1) and eat: head to (6,1), so new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2) [previous head], then (5,2) [previous neck], then (5,1), (4,1), ..., and so on, up to (5,4) still tail? When we move, all segments shift: the segment that was at (6,2) moves to where? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, the first body segment moves to the head's previous position, second to first's previous, and so on, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, and the cell is freed if no growth.\n> \n> But when eating, the tail does not move, so the head occupies the food cell, and the body shifts, but the tail remains, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating at (6,2), the new head is (6,2), and the body from neck to the segment before tail are the same as before but shifted? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move, positions: A = (5,2) head, B = (5,1), C = (4,1), D = (3,1), E = (2,1), F = (2,2), G = (3,2), H = (3,3), I = (3,4), J = (3,5), K = (3,6), L = (4,6), M = (4,5), N = (5,5), O = (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2) and eating: new head (6,2), then the body segments: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O — but O is tail, and since eating, tail doesn't move, so the segments are: head (6,2), then A becomes (5,2), but A was head, now it's the neck position. Better to think the list: new position 0: (6,2), position 1: previous position 0 which was (5,2), position 2: previous position 1 (5,1), ..., position 15: previous position 14 (5,4), and since ate, we add a new segment at the end, but the tail was O (5,4), and it stays, so position 15 is still (5,4), and we have a new position 16 at the same (5,4)? No.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When the snake moves to a new cell without eating, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> With eating, the head moves to the food, and the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the last position is not vacated, and the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: the new head is the food cell.

The tail is at (4,5), so (5,3) is a middle segment, so moving to (5,3) would cause collision because head touches body.\n> \n> Similarly, Left: (4,4) – is (4,4) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n> \n> So occupied: all these cells.\n> \n> (4,4) is not in the list? Let's see: positions are (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n> \n> (4,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) might be empty, etc.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,5). Is (5,5) free? Snake has (3,5), (4,5), but (5,5) not listed, so should be free. (4,5) is tail, but (5,5) is different cell.\n> \n> (5,5): not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (5,5) is within bounds, no internal obstacle at (5,5), so should be free.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,3). But (5,3) is a body segment (second position), so moving there would cause collision. Not safe.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,4). (4,4) is not in snake positions, and let's check walls: internal obstacles include (4,4)? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). Oh, (4,4) is an internal obstacle! So (4,4) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,4). (6,4) not in snake positions, walls: x=7 is wall, but (6,4) is x=6<7, y=4, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles given: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (6,4) not mentioned, so no obstacle, not border, so free.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,5) – free\n> \n> - D: (5,3) – occupied by body, unsafe\n> \n> - L: (4,4) – obstacle, wall, unsafe\n> \n> - R: (6,4) – free\n> \n> So only U and R are safe moves.\n> \n> Head direction is U, so I can move U or R, but not D or L since L is wall, D is body.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since current direction is U, I cannot move D, which is opposite. But D is already unsafe, so it's not an option anyway.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> First, food at (1,6) with life span 1 – it will disappear after this turn, so only chance to eat it is now, turn 77.\n> \n> But can I reach it? Head at (5,4), (1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n> \n> To go from (5,4) to (1,6), that's left 4, up 2, but in one move? No, I can only move one cell per turn.\n> \n> This turn, turn 77, I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4). Neither is (1,6), so I cannot reach (1,6) this turn. Therefore, I cannot eat it; it will disappear after this turn. So I should ignore it, as it's not achievable.\n> \n> Next, other food: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is currently occupied by snake body at position (5,1) in the list, which is the fourth segment. To eat it, I need the body to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) and (6,2) are free cells, I think.\n> \n> (6,1): is it occupied? Snake has (5,1), (4,1), etc., but not (6,1), so free.\n> \n> (6,2): not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,2) life 3, so must eat by turn 79; (6,1) life 6, eat by turn 82; (5,1) life 9, eat by turn 85.\n> \n> But (5,1) is under snake body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> Since I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead, let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, current turn 77: I must choose between U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go U to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction U.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Then I need to consider future moves.\n> \n> Also, I should consider the tail and body movement.\n> \n> Snake will move, so after each move, the tail moves forward, meaning the last segment is removed when moving, unless I eat food, in which case length increases.\n> \n> Since all food is +1, eating food increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, let's think about accessing the food.\n> \n> First, food at (6,2) and (6,1) are both near x=6,y=1-2.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), if I move R to (6,4), I'm closer to them.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5), I'm going away.\n> \n> Also, (5,1) is below, but occupied.\n> \n> Moreover, there might be a risk with the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5).

It's turn 78, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and tail at (4,6). The head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (6,2) with life span 3 and value +1 (since it's positive food, I assume, as value isn't specified negative, so default +1).\n> \n> - At (6,1) with life span 5 and value +1.\n> \n> - At (5,1) with life span 8 and value +1. But (5,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, it's the 5th segment in the positions list: positions are [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), ...], so (5,1) is part of the body.\n> \n> The food at (5,1) is under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (5,1), since it's occupied, I can't eat it immediately; I need to move the snake so that this cell becomes free, then later move the head there.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods are at (6,2) and (6,1), which are not currently occupied, so I could potentially eat them if I move there.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,2), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 78, after turn 78, 79, 80, it will be gone by turn 81. Similarly, (6,1) life span 5: disappears after turn 82 (78+5-1? Let's calculate properly.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current.

From Up, I can move U, L, or R, but not D since that would be instant reverse. Directions: U is (x,y+1), but in grid, usually y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so probably y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), which is middle of grid, since grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so 8x8 grid? x=0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Head at (5,5), moving Up, so if I move U, to (5,6). But (5,6) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,6), so I cannot move there; it's a wall cell.\n> \n> Therefore, moving Up is impossible; it would cause a wall collision.\n> \n> So from current position (5,5), with head direction Up, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6) – but (5,6) is a wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: Down, to (5,4) – but (5,4) is the snake's body, second segment. If I move Down to (5,4), the head would be on the body, which is a collision. But let's see the rules.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,4), which is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the one before. So after moving, the segment that was at (5,4) would move to where the head was, but since head moves to (5,4), and the body was there, it might cause a collision.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it will cause a collision because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell occupied by a body segment, if the head moves there, it collides unless it's the tail and we're eating food, but generally, moving to a body cell is deadly.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, but moving to any other body cell is deadly.\n> \n> In this case, positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move Down to (5,4), which is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is at (4,6). So (5,4) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Left or Right.\n> \n> Possible directions from (5,5):\n> \n> - Up: (5,6) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (5,4) – body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (4,5) – is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> First, list all current occupied cells by snake: positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Also walls: borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Now, (4,5): x=4,y=5. Is it occupied? From positions, (3,5) is there, but (4,5) not listed, so should be free? Let's check the list: positions have (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (4,5), so (4,5) is empty.\n> \n> But is it a wall? Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,5) is within, x=4 between 0-7, y=5 between 0-7. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (4,4) is an obstacle? (4,4) is listed as internal obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (4,4) is a wall, but (4,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, Right: to (6,5)\n> \n> (6,5): x=6,y=5. Borders? x=6<7, y=5<7, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,3) but not (6,5), so free? Snake positions: no (6,5), so yes.\n> \n> But (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,5) is different.\n> \n> Now, Left to (4,5): possible, since not wall, not occupied.\n> \n> Right to (6,5): possible.\n> \n> Down to (5,4) not possible, as body.\n> \n> Up not possible, wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves from current position: Left to (4,5) or Right to (6,5).\n> \n> Current head direction is Up, but since we're moving, we can choose L or R, but not D because instant reverse? Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is Up. Opposite is Down. So I cannot move Down, but Down is invalid anyway. So for movement, from Up, I can move U, L, or R, but not D. U is invalid, so only L or R possible.\n> \n> So actions: L or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, foods: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> (6,2) and (6,1) are at bottom right, (5,1) is under the body.\n> \n> (5,1) is occupied, so I need to move the snake to free (5,1) before I can eat it.\n> \n> First, let's plan the path.\n> \n> If I move Left to (4,5), or Right to (6,5).\n> \n> Also, tail is at (4,6), which is northeast of head.\n> \n> Head at (5,5), tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (6,1) are below, with short life span.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 80.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 5, by turn 82.\n> \n> (5,1) has longer life, 8 turns.\n> \n> But (5,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, it's the segment at index 4 or so, let's see: positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), etc.\n> \n> So (5,1) is occupied and will be freed when the snake moves, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> To eat food under body, I need the body to move away, then head move to it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,1) has food, but it's occupied. When the snake moves, this segment will move to (5,2)? When snake moves, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head to a new position, say to (4,5) or (6,5), then the segment that was at (5,4) moves to (5,5), which was head, but head moves away.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Suppose I move Left to (4,5). Then new head position: (4,5)\n> \n> Then the body: the segment that was at position 1: (5,4) moves to where head was, (5,5)? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: the head moves to the new cell. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions: let S0 = head, S1, S2, ..., S14 for 15 segments? Positions list has 15 elements: indices 0 to 14.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, then S1 moves to old S0 position, S2 to old S1 position, ..., S14 to old S13 position, and the old S14 position is freed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move head to (4,5), then:\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - S1 (was (5,4)) moves to old head position (5,5)\n> \n> - S2 (was (5,3)) moves to S1 old position (5,4)\n> \n> - S3 (was (5,2)) moves to S2 old (5,3)\n> \n> - S4 (was (5,1)) moves to S3 old (5,2)\n> \n> - S5 (was (4,1)) moves to S4 old (5,1) → so (5,1) is now occupied by S5, but S4 moves to (5,2), so (5,1) is now occupied by S5? Let's see:\n> \n> Old positions:\n> \n> - S0: (5,5)\n> \n> - S1: (5,4)\n> \n> - S2: (5,3)\n> \n> - S3: (5,2)\n> \n> - S4: (5,1)\n> \n> - S5: (4,1)\n> \n> - S6: (3,1)\n> \n> - etc.\n> \n> After move head to (4,5):\n> \n> - New S0: (4,5)  // new head\n> \n> - S1 moves to old S0: (5,5)\n> \n> - S2 moves to old S1: (5,4)\n> \n> - S3 moves to old S2: (5,3)\n> \n> - S4 moves to old S3: (5,2)\n> \n> - S5 moves to old S4: (5,1)  // so (5,1) is still occupied by S5 now\n> \n> - S6 moves to old S5: (4,1)\n> \n> - and so on, up to tail S14 moves to old S13 position.\n> \n> So (5,1) was occupied by S4, and after move, S5 moves to (5,1), so (5,1) remains occupied; the food is still under the body, not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move in any direction, since (5,1) is not the tail, it will take several moves to free it.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6), which is S14.\n> \n> To free (5,1), I need the snake to move so that the segment that was at (5,1) moves away, but since it's not the tail, when it moves, another segment takes its place, so the cell (5,1) might be freed only if the tail was there or something.\n> \n> Generally, a cell is freed when the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is occupied by S4. When S4 moves to a new position, the cell (5,1) is freed only if no other segment moves to it immediately. But in the movement, when S4 moves to old S3 position, S5 moves to (5,1), so it's not freed; it's still occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> The only way to free a cell is when the tail moves away from it, and no new segment comes.\n> \n> Specifically, after each move, the cell that was occupied by the tail is freed, because the tail moves to a new position.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,6). After a move, the tail moves to the position of S13, which is (3,6), and (4,6) is freed.\n> \n> But (5,1) is not the tail, so to free (5,1), I need the snake to move in such a way that the segment at (5,1) becomes the tail or something, but the tail is fixed at the end.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, (5,1) will be occupied for many moves until the tail passes through it, but the tail is at (4,6), which is far, so it will take many turns to free (5,1).\n> \n> Let's see the path of the snake.\n> \n> Current positions: from head to tail: (5,5) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (3,6) -> (4,6)\n> \n> So the snake has a loop; it went down the (5,y) column, then left to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then up to (2,2), then right to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), then to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) is the tail.\n> \n> To free (5,1), which is currently S4, I need S4 to move away and no segment to take its place, which happens only when S4 is the tail. But S4 is not the tail; the tail is S14 at (4,6).\n> \n> The cell (5,1) will be freed when the tail moves past it, but since the tail is at (4,6), and the body is connected, it will take many moves for the tail to reach the area near (5,1).\n> \n> For example, to free (5,1), I need the segment that is now at S4 to be the last segment, but it's not.\n> \n> The number of moves until (5,1) is freed depends on how the snake moves.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, the position (5,1) will be occupied until the tail passes through it, which requires the snake to move in a way that the tail approaches (5,1).\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (4,6), and the path to (5,1) is not direct; there are obstacles.\n> \n> But let's not worry about that for now; it might take too long, and the food at (5,1) has life span 8, so it might disappear before I can eat it if I don't act soon.\n> \n> Life span 8 from turn 78, so available until turn 85.\n> \n> But it could take 10+ turns to free (5,1) depending on path.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods are available.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 3, so only 3 turns to eat it, by turn 80.\n> \n> (6,1) life span 5, by turn 82.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: I can go Left to (4,5) or Right to (6,5).\n> \n> If I go Left to (4,5), what happens?\n> \n> New head at (4,5)\n> \n> Then body: S1 to (5,5), S2 to (5,4), S3 to (5,3), S4 to (5,2), S5 to (5,1), etc.\n> \n> (4,5) is free, no problem.\n> \n> From there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): U, D, L, R, but with direction constraint.\n> \n> After moving L, head direction is now Left, so I can move L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (6,5), head direction Right, can move R, U, D, not L.\n> \n> Now, let's think about getting to the foods.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) and (6,1) are at bottom.\n> \n> (6,2) is at y=2, x=6.\n> \n> From head at (5,5), if I move R to (6,5), then I'm at (6,5), which is closer to (6,2) and (6,1).\n> \n> (6,5) to (6,2) is down, so I need to move down.\n> \n> But there might be obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (6,3), which is at (6,3), so if I go to (6,5), I can move D to (6,4), then to (6,3) but (6,3) is wall, so I cannot go down directly; (6,3) is blocked.\n> \n> So from (6,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but with direction.\n> \n> After moving R to (6,5), direction is Right.\n> \n> Then possible moves: from (6,5), U to (6,6), but y=6, borders y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, but y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is free? x=6, y=6, not border, not internal obstacle (obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), etc., (6,6) not listed), and not occupied, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,4): y=4, should be free.\n> \n> But (6,3) is obstacle, so I can go to (6,4), but not to (6,3).\n> \n> L to (5,5), but (5,5) is now occupied by body after move, but let's see.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5), the body: S1 moves to (5,5), so (5,5) is occupied.\n> \n> So from (6,5), moving L to (5,5) would be body collision, invalid.\n> \n> R to (7,5), but x=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,6): possible.\n> \n> D to (6,4): possible.\n> \n> Now, (6,4) is free, I think.

That means coordinates from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Current turn is 79.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So the snake is 15 segments long. Head direction is L, which means left, so from (4,5) it was moving left to (3,5) or something? Positions are listed head first: (4,5) is head, then (5,5), which is right of head, but head direction is L, left. That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), direction L, so it was moving left. But the next position is (5,5), which is east of (4,5), so if head was at (5,5) before and moved left to (4,5), that makes sense. Let's see the sequence: positions are [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), ...]. So from (5,5) it moved left to (4,5), so previous head was at (5,5) moving left to (4,5). Current head position is (4,5) with direction L.\n> \n> Now food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive) but (5,1) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (5,1) is the 6th segment, so it's part of the body. But food can spawn under the body, as per rules.\n> \n> Food: (6,2,2,1) — that's (x,y, life_span, value), so (6,2) life 2, value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1,4,1) — (6,1) life 4, value 1\n> \n> (5,1,7,1) — (5,1) life 7, value 1, but (5,1) is a snake body segment.\n> \n> (5,3,10,1) — (5,3) life 10, value 1, and (5,3) is also a snake body segment? Snake positions: (5,3) is the third segment.\n> \n> So food under the body: (5,1) and (5,3) have food, but they can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) and (6,1) are free cells, I think.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> And borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are invalid.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n> \n> So tail is at (3,6)\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,2): life 2, value 1\n> \n> - (6,1): life 4, value 1\n> \n> - (5,1): life 7, value 1 (under snake body)\n> \n> - (5,3): life 10, value 1 (under snake body)\n> \n> Current head direction: L (left)\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current head position (4,5):\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse?

Obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — (4,6) not listed, so free? But y=6 is within bounds? y from 1 to 6, so (4,6) is top row, but not a wall cell? Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,6) is y=6, which is not y=7, so it's playable. Similarly, (4,6) not in obstacles, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,6) is the tail, which is at (3,6), not (4,6). Snake: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,6) tail. So (4,6) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (4,4): but (4,4) is an internal obstacle! Obstacles include (4,4), so (4,4) is blocked. Cannot move there.\n> \n> L to (3,5): (3,5) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (3,5) is the second last segment, before tail. Positions: ... (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) tail. So (3,5) is occupied by body, except that when we move, the tail moves, so it might be possible if we are moving into the tail cell.\n> \n> Rule: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so it won't be there after the move.\n> \n> But (3,5) is not the tail; tail is (3,6). (3,5) is a body segment.\n> \n> Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,5)\n> \n> 1: (5,5)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,2)\n> \n> 5: (5,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,1)\n> \n> 7: (3,1)\n> \n> 8: (2,1)\n> \n> 9: (2,2)\n> \n> 10: (3,2)\n> \n> 11: (3,3)\n> \n> 12: (3,4)\n> \n> 13: (3,5)\n> \n> 14: (3,6) tail\n> \n> So from head at (4,5), moving to (3,5) which is position 13, a body segment not the tail. If I move to (3,5), it will cause a collision because the head touches the body, and that segment doesn't move away immediately.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to any body segment except the tail is deadly. Only tail is safe to move into because it moves.\n> \n> Therefore, (3,5) is not the tail, it's the 13th segment, so moving to (3,5) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (4,6): (4,6) is empty, as far as I can tell.\n> \n> D to (4,4): but (4,4) is an obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> R to (5,5): but current direction is L, opposite is R, so cannot move right because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - U: (4,6) - empty? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells: (4,6) not in walls, not in obstacles, not in snake positions except tail is (3,6), not (4,6). Snake positions don't include (4,6), so it should be free.\n> \n> - D: (4,4) - obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - L: (3,5) - body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - R: (5,5) - but cannot because instant reverse; current direction L, moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (4,6)? But is (4,6) safe?\n> \n> (4,6) coordinates: x=4,y=6.\n> \n> Walls: y=7 is wall, so y=6 is inside, not wall.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> Snake: positions have (3,6) but not (4,6), so empty.\n> \n> So moving to (4,6) seems possible.\n> \n> But is there food there? Food: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,3) — no (4,6), so no food.\n> \n> Life spans: (6,2) life 2, (6,1) life 4, (5,1) life 7, (5,3) life 10.\n> \n> Current turn 79, so (6,2) disappears in 2 turns, i.e., after turn 80 or 81? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 79, life span 2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 79, food with life 2: after turn 79, countdown to 1; after turn 80, countdown to 0, disappears before turn 81 or after? Typically, it might be available until the end of the turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since we move on each turn, we can think that on turn t, if life_span is L, it has L turns left including this one.\n> \n> So for (6,2) at turn 79, life 2, so it will be available on turn 79 and 80, disappear after turn 80.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life 4, available for turns 79,80,81,82, disappear after 82.\n> \n> (5,1) life 7, available turns 79 to 85.\n> \n> (5,3) life 10, available turns 79 to 88.\n> \n> Now, back to moves: from (4,5), only U to (4,6) is possible?

Head at (4,6) index 0, (4,5) 1, (5,5) 2, (5,4) 3, (5,3) 4, etc.\n> \n> Positions: 0: (4,6), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,5)\n> \n> So (5,3) is index 4.\n> \n> When the head moves, the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to position of segment 0, segment 2 to position of segment 1, etc., so segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was.\n> \n> After one move, segment 4 is at (5,4), so (5,3) is vacated, but only if no new segment moves there, but since the head moves to new cell, the position (5,3) is left empty if no body segment moves to it immediately.\n> \n> In the shift, when head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to old head position, second to old first position, so on, so the position that was occupied by the last body segment is vacated, and other positions are shifted.\n> \n> For example, at turn 80, head at (4,6), body at positions 1 to 14.\n> \n> After move to (3,6), new head (3,6), body: segment 1 moves to (4,6), segment 2 to (4,5), segment 3 to (5,5), segment 4 to (5,4), segment 5 to (5,3), etc., up to segment 14 to (3,4), and the old position of segment 14, (3,5), is vacated.\n> \n> So the cell (5,3) is now occupied by segment 5, which was at (5,2) before, so (5,3) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Specifically, the food at (5,3) is under the body, so it remains under until the segment that is there moves away.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) is occupied by a body segment at all times until that body segment moves and no other moves to it, but in a chain, it's always occupied until the tail passes.\n> \n> When the tail moves away from a cell, it is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (3,5), so when the tail moves, (3,5) is vacated, but (5,3) is not near tail.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to another cell and no segment moves to (5,3), which happens when the tail is at (5,3) and it moves.\n> \n> So for (5,3), the segment there is index 4, which is not tail, so it will be occupied until index 4 becomes the tail.\n> \n> As the snake moves and doesn't eat, the length decreases, so the tail index changes.\n> \n> At turn 80, tail is index 14 at (3,5).\n> \n> After one move no eat, tail is index 13 at (3,4), etc.\n> \n> The segment at index 4 will become tail after 10 moves, since length decreases by 1 each move, so after k moves, the segment that was at index k becomes the tail or something.\n> \n> Let's say after m moves with no eating, the snake length decreases by m, so the tail is the segment that was at index 14-m.\n> \n> For the position (5,3), it is occupied by the segment that is there, which will move when the head moves.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) will be vacated when the segment that is at (5,3) at that time moves away and no other segment moves to it, which happens when that segment is the tail and it moves.\n> \n> So I need to find when the segment currently at (5,3) becomes the tail.\n> \n> At turn 80, segment at (5,3) is index 4.\n> \n> The tail is index 14.\n> \n> After each move no eat, the tail index decreases by 1, so after 10 moves, index 4 will be the tail, and when it moves, (5,3) will be vacated.\n> \n> But the segment moves, so the position changes.\n> \n> The segment itself moves to different positions.\n> \n> For example, at turn 80, segment index 4 is at (5,3).\n> \n> After one move, it moves to where index 3 was, (5,4).\n> \n> After two moves, to where index 2 was, (5,5), and so on.\n> \n> So the segment moves to new positions each turn.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) will be occupied by different segments over time.\n> \n> The food at (5,3) will be revealed when no body segment is at (5,3) after a move.\n> \n> That can happen if the snake moves in a way that the body doesn't occupy (5,3), for example, if the head turns and the body bends, (5,3) might be left empty.\n> \n> In this case, with the current path, it might be occupied for a while.\n> \n> To free (5,3), I need to move the head so that the body doesn't cover it.\n> \n> But it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps for

It's turn 81. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake is 15 segments long. Head direction is L, meaning it's moving left, so from (3,6) to (2,6) or something? Last move was left, so head is at (3,6) and it came from right, so facing left.\n> \n> Head direction is L, so current movement is left. But I need to choose the next move.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All foods are positive, value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,1), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn. Since current turn is 81, it will disappear after turn 83? Let's see: life span N, decreases every turn including current, so after N turns it's gone. For (6,1), life span 3 at turn 81, so:\n> \n> - Turn 81: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 82: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 83: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 84: gone? Or after turn 83 it has life span 0 and disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t when food is present, life span is L. After turn t, it becomes L-1. When L=1 at turn t, after turn t it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. If after decrease it becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> But it might be ambiguous. Let me read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume: at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including current.\n> \n> So for (6,1) at turn 81, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 83.

So possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on next turn.

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis, the immediate action at Turn \\( t_0 = 82 \\) is to move **Down (D)** to avoid immediate death and to navigate towards a safer path. The sequence of actions for the next few turns is forced due to movement constraints and obstacles.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{D}  \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Available Moves**: From the current head position (3,5) with direction **D**, the possible moves are **D** to (3,4) or **L** to (2,5). Moving **U** is opposite to the current direction and blocked by the body, while **R** is blocked by the body.\n2. **Left Move (L)**: Leads to a dead end quickly (e.g., trapped at (1,5) or (1,6)), so it is unsafe.\n3. **Down Move (D)**: Allows the snake to navigate towards the center and avoid immediate collisions. The subsequent moves are forced (e.g., **D** again to (3,3), then **R** to (4,3)), which keeps the snake alive longer.\n4. **Food Considerations**: The food at (6,1) is unreachable due to its short lifespan. The food at (5,1) and (5,3) is under the body and cannot be eaten in time. The food at (3,5) under the head can be revisited later if the snake survives.\n\nThus, **D** is the optimal immediate action.",

It's turn 82. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). Since the head is at (3,5) and direction is D (down), that means the snake is moving downwards.\n> \n> Direction is given as D, so from (3,5), moving down would be to (3,4), but let's see the positions. The next segment is (3,6), which is above, so if head is at (3,5) and moving down, but (3,6) is north, that seems inconsistent. Positions: head (3,5), then (3,6) which is up, then (4,6) right, (4,5) down, and so on. With head direction D, meaning down, so from (3,5), moving down would be to (3,4), but (3,4) isn't in the positions; let's list all positions in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (3,5)\n> \n> 2. (3,6)  // above, so if moving down, this should be behind? I think I need to interpret the direction.\n> \n> Snake positions are given in order: index 0 is head, index 1 is the first body segment, and so on, to the tail. So head at (3,5), next is (3,6), which has the same x, y+1, so that's up from (3,5)? (3,5) to (3,6): if y increases up, then (3,6) is north of (3,5), so if head is at (3,5) and moving to (3,6) would be up, but the direction is given as D, down. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and positions: head (3,5), then (3,6). But (3,6) has higher y, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, then (3,6) is above (3,5), so moving to (3,6) would be U, up. But direction is D, down.

No.\n> \n> Standard in Snake games, the positions list has head at index 0, and the body follows in the direction towards the tail. So the snake was previously at (3,6), and moved to (3,5) by going down? Let's think.\n> \n> At some previous turn, the head was at (3,6), and it moved down to (3,5), so now head is at (3,5), and the segment that was at (3,6) is still there, but when it moved, the tail moves, etc.\n> \n> With head direction D, meaning it is currently moving down. So from (3,5), moving down would be to (3,4) or something, but the next position in the list is (3,6), which is behind it.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction indicates the current movement vector. So head is at (3,5), moving down, so next it will go to (3,4) unless it changes direction.\n> \n> But in the positions list, the first body segment is (3,6), which is the cell it came from, so if it was moving down to (3,5), it came from (3,6) above?

Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the input, it's not parenthesized that way; it's written as (6,1,2,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)?\n> \n> I think there's a inconsistency. In the core rules, it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state, it's \" (6,1,2,1)\" etc. Probably it's a tuple, so for (6,1,2,1), it might be x=6, y=1, life_span=2, value=1? Or value and then life_span?\n> \n> Let's see the value: all have \"1\" at the end, and value is +1 for positive, -1 for negative, but here all have 1 at the end, and in the list, it says \"value1, life_span1\" so likely for (6,1,2,1) it is (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)?\n> \n> The input says: \"(6,1,2,1)\" and \"Value and Life Span\", so I think it's (x,y, value, life_span) because value is listed first in the description.\n> \n> But in the core rules, it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so the value and life_span are separate.\n> \n> In the state input, it's written as (6,1,2,1) which might be shorthand for ((6,1), 2, 1) or something? I'm confused.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6,1,2,1)\" — this is ambiguous. But in the core rules, it specifies the format as ( (x,y), value, life_span ).\n> \n> Perhaps in this input, it's (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)?\n> \n> All the values are 1, since it's positive food, value=1, and life_span varies.\n> \n> For (6,1,2,1), if it's (x,y, value, life_span), then x=6,y=1,value=2, life_span=1? But value should be +1 or -1, not 2.\n> \n> Value is either +1 or -1, so it can't be 2. So probably it's (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1,4,1) — life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> (5,3,7,1) — life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (3,5,10,1) — life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Yes, all value=1, so positive food.\n> \n> So food at:\n> \n> - (6,1): life_span=2, value=1\n> \n> - (5,1): life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> - (5,3): life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> - (3,5): life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is where the head is currently! But the head is at (3,5), and food is at (3,5), but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. Since the head is already on it, but it wasn't eaten yet? Or is it under the body?\n> \n> Special cases: food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (3,5), so food at (3,5) is under the head? But the head is on that cell, so if it stays, it might not be eaten, or it can be eaten only when moving onto it, but it's already on it.\n> \n> The rule: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" — so when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it.\n> \n> But here, the head is already on (3,5), so if it was food, it should have been eaten when it moved there, but perhaps it spawned after or something. But in this state, food is listed at (3,5), and head is at (3,5), so it might be that the food is under the head, but since the head is on it, it can be eaten only if the head moves away and back, but that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Let's read the special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For a body segment, if food is under it, when the snake moves, if that body segment moves away, the food is revealed, and then if the head moves onto it later, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But for the head cell, if food is under the head, it might be that the head is on the food, so it could be eaten immediately, but the rule says \"the head moves onto the food cell\", implying that eating happens when moving to it.\n> \n> Perhaps for the head cell, since the head is on it, if there was food, it should have been eaten when the head moved to that cell. But in this case, the food at (3,5) has life_span=10, so it might have just spawned or something.\n> \n> But the state says food at (3,5), and head at (3,5), so I think we have to assume that the food is under the head and not yet eaten, and it can be eaten only if the head moves away and then back, but that seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps for the head position, if food is there, it can be eaten if the head stays, but the rule says \"moves onto\", so probably not.\n> \n> I think there's confusion. Let's assume that for a cell occupied by the snake, food can be present but not eatable until the snake moves off and on again.\n> \n> But for the head, if it stays, it doesn't eat; only when moving to a cell.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 82, head is on (3,5), and food is at (3,5), so if the head moves away, the food remains, and if it moves back, it can eat it.\n> \n> But moving back might not be possible due to direction.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, let's list all cells:\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot be moved to.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — these are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all cells occupied by snake.\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail at (3,3)\n> \n> Food at: (6,1), (5,1), (5,3), (3,5)\n> \n> But (5,1) and (5,3) are occupied by snake body. (5,1) is the 9th segment? Positions: index 8 is (5,1), index 7 is (5,2), index 6 is (5,3), etc. So (5,3) is occupied by the 6th segment (index 5?

Since life_span decreases each turn, after turn 82, it will have 1 left, after turn 83, 0, so gone at turn 84.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life_span=4, after turn 82, 3 left, etc.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), moving down (D).

So impossible to eat (6,1), it will disappear soon. So ignore this food.\n> \n> - (5,1): life_span=4, value=1.

It's turn 83, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). So the head is at (3,4) and the tail is at (3,2). The snake has 15 segments.\n> \n> The head direction is \"D\", which means down. So moving down would decrease y, but since it's down, from (3,4) down would be to (3,3), but let's confirm coordinates. Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, so D (down) decreases y. So from (3,4), down to (3,3) would be decreasing y to 3.\n> \n> But let's list the positions: head (3,4), next is (3,5), which has higher y, so if head is at (3,4) and previous was (3,5)? Positions are given head first: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), ...] so from head to body: head (3,4), then (3,5) which is above it since y=5 > y=4, so moving up? But head direction is D, down. That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0 is head: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 1: (3,5) — that's same x, y+1, so up from head? But head direction is D (down). Perhaps I misremember the movement.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it moved to get to current position, I think. So if head is at (3,4) and direction is D, that means it came from above, so previous head was at (3,5), and it moved down to (3,4). But in the positions list, (3,4) is head, (3,5) is next, which would be the body segment that was head before. So when it moved down to (3,4), the old head is now at (3,5), which is part of body.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> So head at (3,4), then (3,5) is directly above it (y=5), so that means the snake was moving up before, but head direction is D? Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which probably means the direction it is facing or the last move direction.\n> \n> I think \"head direction\" is the direction the snake moved to reach the current head position. So if direction is D, it moved down to (3,4), so from (3,5) to (3,4), decreasing y. But in positions, (3,5) is the second segment, so that makes sense: it moved down to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, from (3,4), possible moves: since it just moved down, it cannot move up immediately because of no instant reverse. So cannot move U (up, which is y+1).\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4)\n> \n> Possible moves: U (x,y+1) = (3,5)\n> \n> D (x,y-1) = (3,3)\n> \n> L (x-1,y) = (2,4)\n> \n> R (x+1,y) = (4,4)\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since it moved down to here, it cannot move up (U), so U is invalid.\n> \n> Also, need to check for walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells outside 0-7 in x or y are walls, but since we move to cells, we need to avoid those coordinates.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, I assume, since borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So valid cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are the walls, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) are walls. But the snake can be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see positions: head (3,4), and tail (3,2), y=2, which is above y=0, so y=0 is wall, y=7 wall, similarly x.\n> \n> In positions, we have (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), all with y=1, and x=0 or x=7 would be walls. Also (5,6) etc. So cells are from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? (3,6) is a position, y=6, and y=7 is wall, so y=6 is within bounds? Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning that coordinates with x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Confirm: snake has (3,6), which is y=6, and since y=7 is wall, y=6 must be valid. Similarly, (5,1) y=1, y=0 wall. So grid cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (5,6) is an obstacle, but in snake positions, (3,6) and (4,6) are positions, so (5,6) is a separate obstacle cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) are obstacles.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (6,1,1,1) — I think this is (x,y,value,life_span), so (6,1), value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> - (5,1,3,1) — (5,1), value=1, life_span=3?

No: \" (5,1,3,1) \" and it says value and life span, so (x,y, value, life_span) so (5,1) value=3, life_span=1? But value should be +1 or -1, I think, but it says value=3 here? That might be a mistake.\n> \n> Look at the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 1, 1, 1) - (5, 1, 3, 1) - (5, 3, 6, 1) - (3, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> It says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the description, it's \"Value and Life Span\", but the order might be switched?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game:\n\n- **Grid Size**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). Borders (x=0,7 or y=0,7) and internal obstacles [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)] are walls.\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (3,3), direction Down (D).\n  - Body segments: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)] (total length 15).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,1): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 86).\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 88).\n  - (3,5): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 91).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3,3), Direction D\n\nFrom the current head position (3,3) moving Down (D), the possible immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (3,2)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake body → Valid.\n2. **Left (L)**: (2,3)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake body → Valid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,3)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake body → Valid.\n4. **Up (U)**: (3,4)\n   - Opposite to current direction D → Invalid (no instant reverse).\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nAll food items are currently under the snake's body:\n\n- (5,1): Occupied by the 11th segment.\n- (5,3): Occupied by the 9th segment.\n- (3,5): Occupied by the 3rd segment.\n\n**Rules for Eating Food Under Body**:\n1. The body moves away from the food cell.\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nFor a body segment to move away without another segment immediately occupying the cell, it must be the tail. Currently, the tail is at (2,2), not on any food cell. Therefore, none of the food items can be eaten immediately or in the near future because:\n\n- The tail is far from the food positions.\n- The life spans are too short to maneuver the tail to the food positions before they disappear.\n\n### Survival Strategy\n\nSince eating the existing food is impractical within their life spans, the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive, possibly waiting for new food to spawn (though not specified in the rules).\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and future flexibility:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - New head: (3,2), direction D.\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2), D:\n     - D to (3,1): Occupied by body → Invalid.\n     - L to (2,2): Free.\n     - R to (4,2): Free.\n   - This opens paths to the left or right next turn.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - New head: (2,3), direction L.\n   - Next possible moves from (2,3), L:\n     - L to (1,3): Free.\n     - D to (2,2): Free.\n     - U to (2,4): Obstacle → Invalid.\n   - This allows exploration towards the top-left.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - New head: (4,3), direction R.\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3), R:\n     - R to (5,3): Occupied by body → Invalid.\n     - D to (4,2): Free.\n     - U to (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid.\n   - Only D to (4,2) is possible next, limiting options.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\n- Moving **Right (R)** leads to a forced move Down next turn, reducing flexibility.\n- Moving **Down (D)** allows choosing Left or Right next, offering more options.\n- Moving **Left (L)** also provides options to go Left or Down next, exploring less congested areas.\n\nBetween Down and Left, moving **Left (L)** seems better because:\n\n- It moves the snake towards the less crowded top-left area.\n- The tail is at (2,2), and moving Left to (2,3) then possibly Down to (2,2) can help in freeing up space as the tail moves away from (2,2).\n\n### Verifying Left Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (2,3):\n\n- New snake positions: head (2,3), body (3,3) to (2,1), tail (2,1).\n- Next turn (t=85), from (2,3), direction L:\n  - Possible moves:\n    - L to (1,3): Free.\n    - D to (2,2): Free (tail was at (2,2), now moved to (2,1), so (2,2) is free).\n  - Choosing L to (1,3) continues exploring the top-left.\n\nThis sequence seems safe and provides more open space for future moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, the best immediate move is **Left (L)** to (2,3), as it provides flexibility for future moves and avoids immediate dead-ends.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

That's 15 cells.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1), it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn, so it has 3 turns left starting from turn 84. Similarly, (5,3) has 5 turns, (3,5) has 8 turns.\n> \n> Current head direction is Down, so from (3,3), moving Down would go to (3,2), but (3,2) is not occupied by snake? Let's see the snake positions: (3,3) is head, next is (3,4), which is above, but direction is Down, so moving down should be to (3,2), but (3,2) is not in the snake positions list. Snake positions are given in order: head (3,3), then body segments. Since direction is Down, and (3,4) is directly above, that means the snake is moving downwards, so the segment after head is (3,4), meaning the head was at (3,4) previous turn and moved down to (3,3)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), ...] so head is at (3,3), and the next segment is (3,4), which is directly above, so the snake must have moved downward to (3,3) from (3,4) in the previous turn. Current direction is given as D, which is consistent.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,3): since direction is Down, I can move Down to (3,2), Left to (2,3), or Right to (4,3). I cannot move Up because that would be opposite direction, and no instant reverse is allowed. So actions available: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake occupies: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n> \n> Food at: (5,1), (5,3), (3,5)\n> \n> (5,1) has food, but (5,1) is occupied by the snake's tail segment? Snake positions: (5,1) is the 11th segment, and (5,2) is the 10th, (5,3) is 9th, etc.\n> \n> Food at (5,1): value 1, life span 3\n> \n> But (5,1) is currently occupied by the snake body. Similarly, (5,3) has food and is occupied by snake body, and (3,5) has food and is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Now, let's find where the tail is. Snake positions: last is (2,2), so tail is at (2,2). Head is at (3,3), which is adjacent to tail? (3,3) and (2,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (3,3) and (2,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (3,3) to (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n> \n> Tail is at (2,2), so head at (3,3) is not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,1): life span 3, so disappears after turn 86 (since current turn 84, life span 3: countdown decreases each turn including current, so after turn 84, 2 left; after 85, 1 left; after 86, gone). Turn 84: life span 3, after turn 84, it becomes 2; after turn 85, it becomes 1; after turn 86, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 84, 85, or 86 if possible.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 5: disappears after turn 88.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 8: disappears after turn 91.\n> \n> All food is under snake body currently: (5,1) is occupied by snake segment, (5,3) occupied, (3,5) occupied.\n> \n> To eat them, the snake must move so that the body moves away from those cells, and then head moves in.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider the current position and possible moves from (3,3) with direction Down.\n> \n> Possible actions: L (left to (2,3)), D (down to (3,2)), R (right to (4,3))\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe:\n> \n> - (2,3): is it wall? Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders: x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7, so (2,3) is within 1-6, not border. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,3) not in that list. Snake body: snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), etc. (2,3) not in list, so empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n> \n> So (2,3) is not occupied, and not wall, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): not in snake, not wall, free.\n> \n> (4,3): not in snake positions, not wall, free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) is different.\n> \n> (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) free, (3,2) free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, the tail will move when snake moves, but only if no food is eaten.\n> \n> Currently, no food eaten this turn, so when snake moves, tail will move away from (2,2).\n> \n> Let's think about the food at (5,1). It's under the snake at (5,1), which is the 11th segment. When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail will move, so (5,1) might be freed if the tail moves away.\n> \n> But the tail is at (2,2), not at (5,1). (5,1) is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> To free a cell with food under body, the snake needs to move so that the segment on that cell moves away.\n> \n> For (5,1), it is occupied, but when the snake moves forward without eating, the tail end moves away, and all segments shift.\n> \n> Suppose I move without eating food: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (2,2). When head moves to, say, (3,2), then the new positions: head at (3,2), then (3,3) becomes body, (3,4), and so on, up to the second last segment (2,1) moves to where? The segments shift: the head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So for snake: positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg13, tail] = [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]\n> \n> If I move to (3,2), new head at (3,2), then body: (3,3) becomes first body, then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Tail (2,2) is removed, so (2,2) is freed.\n> \n> But (5,1) is still occupied, now by the segment that was at (5,2) previously? Let's see the new positions:\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,2)\n> \n> - Then the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was, but no: each segment moves to the position of the next one? Better to think index-based.\n> \n> The positions are ordered: index 0: head (3,3), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (3,5), ..., index 14: tail (2,2)\n> \n> After move: new head at new position, say (3,2) for down move.\n> \n> Then new position 0: (3,2)\n> \n> New position 1: old position 0, which is (3,3)\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1, (3,4)\n> \n> ...\n> New position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to 14, but since no growth, the last position is removed.\n> \n> So after moving down to (3,2):\n> \n> New snake: head (3,2), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> Tail was (2,2), removed. (2,1) is now the last segment.\n> \n> (5,1) is still occupied, by the segment that was previously at (5,2), now moved to (5,1)? In the new list, position 10: (5,1) from old position 10 which was (5,1), but since all segments shifted, the segment that was at index 10 (5,1) is now at index 11? Let's index old positions:\n> \n> Old: idx 0: (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,2), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1), 14: (2,2)\n> \n> After move down, new head at (3,2)\n> \n> Then new idx 1: old idx 0 (3,3)\n> \n> New idx 2: old idx 1 (3,4)\n> \n> New idx 3: old idx 2 (3,5)\n> \n> New idx 4: old idx 3 (3,6)\n> \n> New idx 5: old idx 4 (4,6)\n> \n> New idx 6: old idx 5 (4,5)\n> \n> New idx 7: old idx 6 (5,5)\n> \n> New idx 8: old idx 7 (5,4)\n> \n> New idx 9: old idx 8 (5,3)\n> \n> New idx 10: old idx 9 (5,2)\n> \n> New idx 11: old idx 10 (5,1)\n> \n> New idx 12: old idx 11 (4,1)\n> \n> New idx 13: old idx 12 (3,1)\n> \n> New idx 14: old idx 13 (2,1)  // since tail is removed, the last is old idx 13, and old idx 14 is gone.\n> \n> Old had 15 segments, after move no eat, 14 segments: new positions from idx 0 to 13.\n> \n> New idx 0: (3,2)  // new head\n> \n> New idx 1: old idx 0 (3,3)\n> \n> New idx 2: old idx 1 (3,4)\n> \n> New idx 3: old idx 2 (3,5)\n> \n> New idx 4: old idx 3 (3,6)\n> \n> New idx 5: old idx 4 (4,6)\n> \n> New idx 6: old idx 5 (4,5)\n> \n> New idx 7: old idx 6 (5,5)\n> \n> New idx 8: old idx 7 (5,4)\n> \n> New idx 9: old idx 8 (5,3)\n> \n> New idx 10: old idx 9 (5,2)\n> \n> New idx 11: old idx 10 (5,1)\n> \n> New idx 12: old idx 11 (4,1)\n> \n> New idx 13: old idx 12 (3,1)  // tail, since old idx 13 (2,1) is now idx 13, but old idx 12 was (3,1), which is now new idx 12? Let's correct.\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Then the body segments take the old positions from head to second-last: so old positions from idx 0 to 13 become new body from idx 1 to 13, but idx 13 is tail.\n> \n> Old positions: 0 to 14, 15 cells.\n> \n> After move, new head at new cell, and the body is old positions 0 to 13, so 14 cells.\n> \n> New snake: [new_head] + old_positions[0:14] but old_positions[0:14] is from idx 0 to 13, which is 14 cells, but we need 14 segments including head? No.\n> \n> Standard: new head at new position, then the first body segment is at old head position, second body at old first body, and so on, up to the new tail at old second-last position.\n> \n> In this case, old head (3,3) becomes new first body, old first body (3,4) becomes new second body, ..., old 13th position (2,1) becomes new 13th body (tail), and old tail (2,2) is removed.\n> \n> Old indices: 0: head, 1: body1, ..., 13: body13, 14: tail.\n> \n> After move no eat: new head at new pos, new body1 at old head (idx 0), new body2 at old body1 (idx 1), ..., new body14 at old body13 (idx 13), and old tail (idx 14) removed. So new snake has 14 segments.\n> \n> For (5,1): it was old idx 10, which is body10. After move, the segment that was at (5,1) is now at new position: since new body11 is at old body10 (5,1), so the cell (5,1) is still occupied by the same segment, but in the new list, it is at a different index.\n> \n> The key point is that the cell (5,1) is still occupied after the move because the segment that was there didn't move away; it's still there but the snake shifted.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (5,1), it was occupied by a segment, and after the move, it is still occupied by a segment, because the segment at (5,2) moved to (5,1), so (5,1) is now occupied by the segment that was at (5,2) previously.\n> \n> But the food is at (5,1), so it is still under the snake body.\n> \n> To free (5,1), the snake needs to move so that no segment is on (5,1), which means the segment currently on (5,1) must move away, and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, segments are shifting, so to free a cell, the tail must move away from it, but (5,1) is not the tail; the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> The only way to free a body-occupied cell with food is for the snake to move in such a way that when the segment on that cell moves, and since it's not the tail, it will be occupied by another segment only if the snake doesn't grow, but when the snake moves, the segment on the food cell will move to the next position, and the previous position might be freed if it was the tail, but for internal segments, the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> In general, for a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, when the snake moves without eating, that cell will be occupied by the next segment in line. So the food remains covered unless that segment is the tail.\n> \n> Only when the food is under the tail, when the tail moves, the cell is freed.\n> \n> Otherwise, for internal body, the food is never freed because when the segment moves away, the cell is immediately occupied by the segment that was behind it.\n> \n> For example, take (5,1): it has food, and is occupied by a body segment. When snake moves, the segment at (5,1) moves to where the segment ahead was, but since it's body, it moves to the position of the previous segment in front. In the shift, the segment at (5,1) moves to, say, if head moves down, as above, the segment at (5,1) (old idx 10) moves to new position: in the new snake, the segment that was at (5,1) is now at the position where old idx 9 was, but in terms of cell, the cell (5,1) is now occupied by the segment that was at (5,2) (old idx 9), because new body at (5,1) is from old (5,2).\n> \n> So the cell (5,1) is still occupied, just by a different segment.\n> \n> Therefore, for food under a body segment that is not the tail, it can never be eaten because the cell is always occupied by some snake segment when the snake moves; it never becomes free until the tail passes over it, but since it's not the tail, it doesn't happen.\n> \n> Let's think about the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,2). When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so (2,2) is freed. If there was food under tail, it could be eaten later, but in this case, no food at (2,2).\n> \n> For other cells, like (5,1), it is not the tail, so when the snake moves, the cell (5,1) remains occupied because the segment that was at (5,2) moves to (5,1).\n> \n> The only way to free (5,1) is if the segment on (5,1) is the tail, but it's not; the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> So for food under a non-tail body segment, it is impossible to eat it because the cell is perpetually occupied as long as the snake is on it.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> \" The body moves away\" means that the snake segment leaves that cell, and no other segment is on it when the head moves in.\n> \n> But in a standard snake movement, when a body segment moves away from a cell, the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment, so it's never free unless it's the tail cell.\n> \n> For the tail cell, when the tail moves away, the cell is freed.\n> \n> For other body cells, when a segment moves away, the cell is taken by the following segment.\n> \n> Therefore, only food under the tail can be eaten later, when the tail moves away.\n> \n> For food under non-tail body, it cannot be eaten because the cell is always occupied.\n> \n> But the rules don't specify that it has to be the tail; it just says \"the body moves away\", but in practice, for non-tail, it doesn't move away freely.\n> \n> Perhaps in this implementation, when the snake moves, the cell is only freed if it was the tail position.\n> \n> Otherwise, for internal cells, the food is inaccessible.\n> \n> Let's read the rules carefully: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2.

Let's clarify the life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N. But since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span N means it has N turns left, including turn t. So after N turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N: it exists for turn t (life span N), turn t+1 (life span N-1), ..., turn t+N-1 (life span 1), and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> So for food at (5,1): life span 2 at turn 85, so it exists on turn 85 (life span 2), turn 86 (life span 1), and disappears at turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): life span 4, exists turn 85 to 88, gone at 89.\n> \n> (3,5): life span 7, exists turn 85 to 91, gone at 92.\n> \n> (2,2): life span 10, exists turn 85 to 94, gone at 95.\n> \n> All food have value +1, so positive food.

Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. The tail segment is removed from the tail position.\n> \n> So if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it should be safe because when I move there, the tail moves away, so no collision.

After move: if head moves to (3,3), then the body segment that was at (3,3) will move to where the head was, (2,3), so (3,3) is now the head, and (2,3) is the new first body segment. But at the time of move, when head moves to (3,3), it is occupied by the body, so collision.\n> \n> Yes, so moving to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail is deadly, because that segment doesn't move away instantly; only the tail vacates its cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So only tail cell is safe to move into, not other body cells.\n> \n> Here, (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (2,1).

Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (1,3) is not border, and internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) is not listed, so should be free, unless it's a border, but x=1>0, y=3>0, not border.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): internal obstacle?

So if I move D to (2,2), I eat the food, but since head is now at (2,2), and tail is at (2,1), they are adjacent. After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; the new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> Let's clarify the eating and growing.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows: after moving to the food cell, the head is on food, it eats, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to a food cell, it consumes the food, and the tail remains in place for that turn, so the new position list has the head at the food cell, and the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, you move to the food cell, but instead of removing the tail, you keep it, so snake grows.\n> \n> In position terms: normally, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new cell (with food), each segment moves to previous position, but tail is not removed; instead, it stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Typically: the movement is the same; head moves to new cell. If that cell has food, then after moving, the tail is not removed; so the snake gains one segment. The position where the tail was remains part of the snake.\n> \n> So, after move with eat: positions: new head position, then all previous positions including the tail.\n> \n> Without eat: new head position, then all previous positions except tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,2), which has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> Then new snake positions: head at (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes first body, then (3,3), and so on, up to tail (2,1) remains, so new tail is still (2,1)? No.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list indices:\n> \n> 0: (2,3) head\n> \n> 1: (3,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,5)\n> \n> 4: (3,6)\n> \n> 5: (4,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (5,3)\n> \n> 10: (5,2)\n> \n> 11: (5,1)\n> \n> 12: (4,1)\n> \n> 13: (3,1)\n> \n> 14: (2,1) tail\n> \n> If I move down to (2,2), which has food, so after move:\n> \n> Head moves to (2,2), then the body: segment 0 moves to where? After head moves, the new position 0 is (2,2), then position 1 is the old position 0, which is (2,3), position 2 is old position 1, (3,3), and so on, up to old position 14 (2,1) is now position 15, and since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so the snake has 16 segments: positions from (2,2) to (2,1), with (2,1) still the tail for now.\n> \n> But (2,1) is the tail, and head is at (2,2), which is adjacent.\n> \n> Now, the danger: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, when I eat at (2,2), the tail cell is (2,1), which does not have food; the food is at (2,2), not at tail.\n> \n> The danger is when the tail cell has food, and head is adjacent, and I eat that food.\n> \n> But here, the food is at (2,2), not at tail (2,1).\n> \n> So no issue with that.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,1), no food there; food is at (2,2), separate cell.\n> \n> So moving to (2,2) should be safe, I eat food, grow to 16 segments.\n> \n> But after this move, head is at (2,2), tail at (2,1), and they are adjacent.\n> \n> But that's fine; it's not a problem unless I try to eat food at tail when adjacent.\n> \n> Now, other moves: I could move L to (1,3), no food.\n> \n> But let's think long-term.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there are foods under body: (5,1), (5,3), (3,5) have food, but covered.\n> \n> (3,5) is a body segment, index 3.\n> \n> To eat them, I need the body to move away, then head to move there.\n> \n> But since the snake is moving, it might take time.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two options for turn 85.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (2,2) - eat food, grow.\n> \n> Option 2: Move L to (1,3) - no eat.\n> \n> Now, after that, future moves.\n> \n> But I need to think about the food life spans.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) life span 2: exists turn 85 and 86, gone at 87.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 4: exists 85-88.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 7: exists 85-91.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 10: but if I eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> (2,2) is the one I can eat now.\n> \n> But (5,1) has short life, only 2 turns left, including this turn.

No.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, after moving the head to food, the tail does not move, so the snake has the new head position and all old positions, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So new positions: index 0: (2,2) new head\n> \n> Index 1: (2,3)  // old head\n> \n> Index 2: (3,3)  // old body 1\n> \n> Index 3: (3,4)  // old body 2\n> \n> Index 4: (3,5)  // old body 3\n> \n> Index 5: (3,6)  // old body 4\n> \n> Index 6: (4,6)  // old body 5\n> \n> Index 7: (4,5)  // old body 6\n> \n> Index 8: (5,5)  // old body 7\n> \n> Index 9: (5,4)  // old body 8\n> \n> Index 10: (5,3)  // old body 9\n> \n> Index 11: (5,2)  // old body 10\n> \n> Index 12: (5,1)  // old body 11\n> \n> Index 13: (4,1)  // old body 12\n> \n> Index 14: (3,1)  // old body 13\n> \n> Index 15: (2,1)  // old tail, now last body segment\n> \n> So tail is at (2,1), head at (2,2), adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Head direction after move: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n> \n> Now, turn 86: from (2,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot move U (up, opposite to down).\n> \n> Reverse of D is U, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Possible: D to (2,1), but (2,1) is the tail.

Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). I should list all the wall cells to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,2), and direction is down (D). The body segments are listed in order: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,1)? Let's read carefully: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> So the snake is quite long: 16 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Current head direction is down, so from (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1), but (2,1) is part of the snake body? Let's see the positions: head is (2,2), then (2,3) is the next segment. (2,1) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, when the head moves, the tail moves, so it might be possible to move to where the tail is now, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> But I need to be careful with the Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it could cause collision.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> I should sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

But since playable area is inside, we care about cells (1,1) to (6,6) being accessible except obstacles.\n> \n> For movement, we can only move to cells that are not walls and not occupied by snake body except tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list coordinates:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (2,2)\n> \n> 1: (2,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,5)\n> \n> 5: (3,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,6)\n> \n> 7: (4,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,5)\n> \n> 9: (5,4)\n> \n> 10: (5,3)\n> \n> 11: (5,2)\n> \n> 12: (5,1)\n> \n> 13: (4,1)\n> \n> 14: (3,1)\n> \n> 15: (2,1)  // tail\n> \n> So the snake body occupies all these cells.

The head moves onto the food cell.\n> \n> So for each food, since it's under the body, it can be eaten only if that segment moves away and then head moves there.\n> \n> But also, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> Current tail position: (2,1)\n> \n> Head is at (2,2), tail at (2,1), so they are adjacent vertically? (2,2) and (2,1) are one cell apart, so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> Now, tail has food? (2,1) is the tail cell, but food is at (5,1), (5,3), (3,5), not at (2,1). (2,1) has no food listed, so no food there. The food is only at those positions, under the body.\n> \n> For (5,1), it has food, and it's the tail? No, (5,1) is segment 12, not the tail. Tail is (2,1), which has no food.\n> \n> Let's see which segment has food.\n> \n> Food at (5,1): occupied by segment 12: (5,1)\n> \n> Food at (5,3): occupied by segment 10: (5,3)\n> \n> Food at (3,5): occupied by segment 4: (3,5)\n> \n> None of these is the tail. Tail is (2,1), no food.\n> \n> So Tail Reward Danger doesn't apply here directly, but since food is under body, we need to move so that the body moves away from those cells to make them accessible, then head can eat.\n> \n> But life span: (5,1) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, so if not eaten on this turn (turn 86), it will be gone.\n> \n> Since it's under the body, and head is not on it, it can't be eaten this turn because the body is still there. To eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> But on this turn, turn 86, if the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves, so the body shifts.\n> \n> After movement, some cells might be vacated.\n> \n> Current turn: we are at turn 86, and we need to choose action for turn 86.\n> \n> After moving, the food life span decreases, including for this turn.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (5,1), life span 1: at turn 86, if not eaten, it disappears after this turn, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,3), life span 3, so after 3 turns including this one, it will disappear if not eaten.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 6.\n> \n> Since (5,1) has life span 1, it must be eaten on this turn or it's gone forever.\n> \n> But can it be eaten on this turn? Currently, it's under segment (5,1), so head cannot move there directly because it's occupied.\n> \n> According to rules, to eat food under body, the body must move away first, meaning that after movement, the cell is vacated, then on a subsequent turn, head can move there.\n> \n> But for (5,1), if we don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Is it possible to eat it this turn? Only if head moves to (5,1) and the body is not there, but currently body is there, so after movement, if the snake moves in a way that (5,1) is vacated, but head moves to a different cell.\n> \n> Let's think about snake movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves in a direction, the new head position is based on that direction, and the tail position is removed, so one cell is vacated (the old tail position).\n> \n> For a food under a body segment, it can be eaten only if that segment is not part of the snake anymore, i.e., when the snake moves and that cell is vacated because it was the tail or something.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,1), it is occupied by segment 12, which is not the tail; tail is segment 15: (2,1).\n> \n> So when the snake moves, segment 12 will move to where segment 11 was or something? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> The snake is a list of positions: after moving down, for example, the new head is (2,1) if moving down from (2,2), but (2,1) is currently the tail.\n> \n> Let's simulate movement.\n> \n> Current head: (2,2), direction down (D), so if we move down, head goes to (2,1).\n> \n> But (2,1) is currently occupied by the tail. According to rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> In general, you can move to the tail cell because after movement, the tail is gone.\n> \n> But for food under other segments, it's different.\n> \n> After moving, the snake segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if we move down from (2,2) to (2,1), then the new snake positions:\n> \n> New head: (2,1)\n> \n> Then the body: segment 1 (2,3) becomes the new segment after head? The list shifts.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 15: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> If head moves down to (2,1), which was the tail, then the new snake: head at (2,1), then the first body segment is old position of index 0, which is (2,2), then index 1 (2,3), index 2 (3,3), and so on, up to index 14 (3,1), and the tail was index 15 (2,1) but that's where head is moving, so the new tail is the old segment 14: (3,1).\n> \n> After moving down:\n> \n> - New head: (2,1)  // since moved down to (2,1)\n> \n> - Then the segments: the previous head (2,2) becomes the first body segment, so new position 1: (2,2)\n> \n> New position 2: (2,3)  // old index 1\n> \n> New position 3: (3,3)  // old index 2\n> \n> New position 4: (3,4)  // old index 3\n> \n> New position 5: (3,5)  // old index 4\n> \n> New position 6: (3,6)  // old index 5\n> \n> New position 7: (4,6)  // old index 6\n> \n> New position 8: (4,5)  // old index 7\n> \n> New position 9: (5,5)  // old index 8\n> \n> New position 10: (5,4)  // old index 9\n> \n> New position 11: (5,3)  // old index 10\n> \n> New position 12: (5,2)  // old index 11\n> \n> New position 13: (5,1)  // old index 12\n> \n> New position 14: (4,1)  // old index 13\n> \n> New position 15: (3,1)  // old index 14, new tail\n> \n> Old tail (2,1) is now the head, so it's removed as tail, but since head is there, it's occupied.\n> \n> The cell (5,1) was occupied by old index 12, which is now at new position 13: (5,1), so it's still occupied by the snake.\n> \n> After moving down, the food at (5,1) is still under the body, at new segment 13.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is at new position 11, etc.\n> \n> So the food under non-tail segments remains under the body after movement, unless that segment was the tail.\n> \n> To vacate a cell with food, that segment must be the tail, so that when the snake moves, that cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,1), it is not the tail; tail is (2,1). So to vacate (5,1), it must become the tail at some point.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But for (5,1) with life span 1, it must be eaten on this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> Since it's under the body and not the tail, it cannot be eaten this turn, because head can't move to it directly, and after movement, it's still under body or not vacated.\n> \n> After any move this turn, (5,1) will still be occupied or not?\n> \n> In the move down example, it was still occupied.\n> \n> Suppose we move in a different direction.\n> \n> Current head at (2,2), directions available: we can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so we cannot move up (opposite) on next turn?

Impossible to eat.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3), even worse.\n> \n> Therefore, it seems impossible to eat any of the current food because they are under the body and their life span is too short to wait for them to become the tail.\n> \n> But that can't be right; perhaps there is another way.\n> \n> The rules say: food can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> The body moves away when that segment is no longer there, which happens when the snake moves and that segment position is left.\n> \n> For a segment that is not tail, it moves away only when it becomes the tail and then the snake moves.\n> \n> But in this case, for all food, it takes many turns to become tail, but life span is short.\n> \n> Perhaps we can eat other food or something, but there are no other food; only these three, all under body.\n> \n> But we might need to survive and find new food, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning; I think food is only given, and we have to work with that.\n> \n> The state has only these food items; no mention of new food, so probably these are the only ones.\n> \n> But if we can't eat them, we just avoid dying and wait for new food, but the problem is to maximize score, so we need to eat when possible.\n> \n> But here, it seems we can't eat the existing food.\n> \n> Perhaps for the food with longer life span, if we can make the snake shorter or something, but we can only shorten by not eating, but not eating keeps length same.\n> \n> The only way to shorten is to eat negative food, but there is no negative food here.\n> \n> All food is positive, so eating increases length.\n> \n> To vacate a cell faster, we need that segment to be closer to the tail.\n> \n> But currently, the food cells are far from tail.\n> \n> For example, (3,5) is index 4, close to head, but tail is far.\n> \n> Index 4 is close to head, but to become tail, it takes many moves.\n> \n> Unless we can make the snake move in a way that the tail moves faster to that position, but the snake is fixed path, so the order doesn't change much; it's a path.\n> \n> The snake has a fixed body; when it moves, the body segments follow the path.\n> \n> To free a cell, we need to move so that the tail passes that point.\n> \n> But in this case, for (3,5), it is at index 4, and tail is at index 15, so we need to move 11 times for the tail to reach where index 4 was, but since the snake moves, the positions shift.\n> \n> I think my earlier calculation is correct; it takes 11 moves for index 4 to become the tail.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Since life span is short, we can't eat them.\n> \n> Therefore, for this turn, we should focus on survival and positioning for future food, but there is no other food, so we need to assume that new food may spawn, or perhaps we can consider that after these food disappear, new food might appear, but the state doesn't specify.\n> \n> The state only gives current food; I think we have to work with what's given, and new food may spawn later, but not specified.\n> \n> To maximize score, we should try to eat if possible, but here it's not.\n> \n> Perhaps for (5,1) with life span 1, it's impossible, so ignore.\n> \n> For (5,3) and (3,5), same issue.\n> \n> But let's check if any food can be eaten soon.\n> \n> Another thing: Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n> \n> Or perhaps the head can move to a cell where food is under the tail after it moves, but in this case, the food is not under tail.\n> \n> For example, if a food is under the tail, then when the snake moves, the tail moves away, vacating the cell, and then head can move to it on the same turn or next.\n> \n> But here, no food under tail.\n> \n> Current tail at (2,1), no food.\n> \n> So no.\n> \n> Therefore, I think we cannot eat any of the current food; they will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> So we need to just move safely and wait for new food to spawn.\n> \n> But the AI needs to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n> \n> First, for turn 86, choose a move.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2): D, L, R.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1): (2,1) was tail, so after move, head at (2,1), new tail at (3,1).

When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last body segment (tail) leaves its position, and the new set has the same number of segments, but shifted.\n> \n> For example, with 3 segments: head at A, body at B, tail at C.\n> \n> Move to new cell D (no food): new head at D, body at A (where head was), tail at B (where body was), and C is vacated.\n> \n> Number of segments still 3.\n> \n> In my case, snake has 16 segments: positions 0 to 15, head at 0, tail at 15.\n> \n> After moving to a new cell without eating:\n> \n> New head at the new position.\n> \n> New segment 1 at old position of segment 0.\n> \n> New segment 2 at old position of segment 1.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 15 at old position of segment 14.\n> \n> Old segment 15 (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: new head, then old 0, old 1, ..., old 14.\n> \n> So still 16 segments, but the tail is now where old segment 14 was.\n> \n> In my earlier list, after moving to (3,1), which was old tail:\n> \n> New head at (3,1) (new position).\n> \n> Then new segment 1 at old position of segment 0, which is (3,2).\n> \n> New segment 2 at old position of segment 1, which is (2,2).\n> \n> New segment 3 at old position of segment 2, which is (2,3).\n> \n> New segment 4 at old position of segment 3, which is (3,3).\n> \n> New segment 5 at old position of segment 4, which is (3,4).\n> \n> New segment 6 at old position of segment 5, which is (3,5).\n> \n> New segment 7 at old position of segment 6, which is (3,6).\n> \n> New segment 8 at old position of segment 7, which is (4,6).\n> \n> New segment 9 at old position of segment 8, which is (4,5).\n> \n> New segment 10 at old position of segment 9, which is (5,5).\n> \n> New segment 11 at old position of segment 10, which is (5,4).\n> \n> New segment 12 at old position of segment 11, which is (5,3).\n> \n> New segment 13 at old position of segment 12, which is (5,2).\n> \n> New segment 14 at old position of segment 13, which is (5,1).\n> \n> New segment 15 at old position of segment 14, which is (4,1).\n> \n> Old segment 15 was (3,1), vacated.\n> \n> So new snake: head (3,1), then (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So the body segments are from (3,2) to (4,1), and tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> Length still 16.\n> \n> And the cell (3,1) is now head, which was tail, but no issue.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move R to (4,2), new head at (4,2), then segment 1 at (3,2), segment 2 at (2,2), segment 3 at (2,3), and so on, up to segment 15 at old (4,1), so new tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Old tail (3,1) vacated.\n> \n> Back to turn 87 choices.\n> \n> Possible actions: D to (3,1) or R to (4,2).\n> \n> U to (3,3) is invalid because collision with body.\n> \n> Now, for food at (5,3): it is currently occupied by segment 11, at position (5,3).\n> \n> When the snake moves, if we don't eat food, the body shifts.\n> \n> For example, after a move, the segment that was at (5,3) might move to a different cell.\n> \n> Specifically, after any move without eating, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for cell (5,3), it is occupied by segment 11.

is in the middle, it might not be vacated soon.\n> \n> Perhaps if we eat food elsewhere, the snake grows, and the body doesn't move from that cell, but since we eat, the tail stays, so the cell remains occupied.\n> \n> Only when no food eaten, the tail moves, so cells can be vacated.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,5) is occupied, and to vacate it, we need the segment that is there to be the tail at some point and then move away.\n> \n> The current tail is at (4,1) after some moves, which is far from (3,5).\n> \n> The shortest path or moves to make (3,5) the tail is many steps.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (3,5) is number 5 from head, so to make it tail, we need to have the head move such that 5 segments are added or removed, but it's complicated.\n> \n> The index difference is 10 from tail (since 16 segments, index 5 from head, so 10 from tail).\n> \n> To make it tail, we need to move the head 10 times without eating, so that the tail moves 10 steps, and the segment at position 5 becomes the new tail after 10 moves.\n> \n> After 10 moves without eating, the segment that was at position 5 will be at position 5-10, but positions shift.\n> \n> After k moves without

13, and so on.\n> \n> After k moves, new tail is position (15-k).\n> \n> For the segment at position i to become tail, we need 15-i moves without eating.\n> \n> Here for (3,5), it is at position 5 (index 5), so to become tail, need 15-5 = 10 moves without eating.\n> \n> After 10 moves without eating, the segment that was at position 5 will be the new tail.\n> \n> Then on the 11th move, if we move the tail away, (3,5) is vacated.\n> \n> But we need to have the head at (3,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But with life span 5, we have only 5 turns, from 87 to 91, so 5 moves, not enough for 10 moves.\n> \n> So it's impossible to vacate (3,5) within 5 turns to eat the food.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3), position 11, to become tail need 15-11=4 moves, but life span 3, so only 3 turns, not enough.\n> \n> For (5,3): position 11, to become tail need 15-11=4 moves without eating.\n> \n> Life span 3, so on turn 87,88,89 available, but after 4 moves on turn 90, it would be tail, but food gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,5): position 5, need 10 moves, life span 5, not enough.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat either food because they are under the body and we cannot vacate the cells within the life span.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> The food can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves in, but in this case, with the snake configuration, it cannot be vacated in time.\n> \n> Perhaps if the head moves to a position where it can reach the food after the body shifts, but since the body shifts slowly, and the food is under, it stays occupied.\n> \n> Unless the snake moves in a way that the body segment leaves and no one replaces it immediately, but in the shift, it is replaced by the next segment.\n> \n> For example, when the snake moves, the cell that was occupied by segment i is now occupied by segment i+1 for body, so it remains occupied unless it was the tail.\n> \n> Only the tail cell is vacated when no growth.\n> \n> Body cells are always occupied unless at the tail position.\n> \n> Therefore, for a body cell to be vacated, it must become the tail and then the tail moves away.\n> \n> For (5,3) to be vacated, it must be the tail at some point, which requires 4 moves without eating, but life span 3, not possible.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,5), 10 moves, life span 5, not possible.\n> \n> Therefore, we cannot eat either food; they will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> So we should ignore them and focus on survival and finding other food, but the state only shows two food, and no other food mentioned, so perhaps no other food on grid, or new food may spawn, but the state doesn't say, so we assume only these food are present.\n> \n> But the state gives the food positions, so only these two.\n> \n> So we cannot eat them, so we should

Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 88, so for (5,3), life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 89? Let's see: life span decreases each turn, so on turn 88, it has life 2, after turn 88, it becomes life 1, then after turn 89, it becomes life 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 88 or 89.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) life span 4: can be eaten on turns 88,89,90,91.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10: many turns.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (3,1) with direction D.\n> \n> Available moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,2) - occupied by snake body (segment 1), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (3,0) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (2,1) - seems free. Is it wall? Borders: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (2,1) x=2 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,1) is not listed, so should be free. Snake: not occupied except possibly, but positions don't have (2,1), so empty. So L to (2,1) is possible.\n> \n> - R: to (4,1) - currently occupied by tail (4,1). Since it's the tail, and tail will move, moving here should be safe. After move, head goes to (4,1), and tail moves from (4,1) to wherever, but since head is moving to tail position, and tail leaves, no collision.\n> \n> But let's see what happens to tail. Current tail is (4,1). When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail is removed, so (4,1) becomes empty after move.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,1), head goes to (4,1), and since no food there (foods are at (5,3), (3,5), (4,3), not (4,1)), so no growth, tail is removed, so the segment at (4,1) is removed, and head is now at (4,1), but (4,1) was tail, so it's fine.\n> \n> Now, is (4,1) adjacent to any other body part? After move, the new head position is (4,1), and the previous head (3,1) becomes body, so body segments: new positions: head (4,1), then body (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n> \n> (4,1) is not part of body except the tail which moved.\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe.\n> \n> Now, other options? Only L and R are possible, since U and D are invalid.\n> \n> So I must move L or R.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,3): but (5,3) is occupied by snake segment 12: positions include (5,3) as segment 12.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (5,3) is listed, so it's under the body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is also under snake? Positions: (3,5) is segment 6.\n> \n> (4,3) is not listed, so it might be free? Positions: (4,3) not in snake positions, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So (4,3) is not in the list, so it's empty, and food is there.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by segment, and food is there, but since body is on it, I can't eat it until body moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is occupied by segment 6.\n> \n> (4,3) is free, food available.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (3,1), I can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (2,1):\n> \n> - New head position (2,1)\n> \n> - Direction: since I moved L, new direction is L.\n> \n> - No food at (2,1), so no growth, tail removed. Tail is (4,1), removed, so new tail is (5,1)? Positions: after move, head to (2,1), then body: previous head (3,1) now body, then (3,2), ..., up to (5,1) and (4,1) was tail, removed. So the last segment (4,1) is removed, so new snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] and (4,1) is gone, so (5,1) is now tail.\n> \n> Length same.\n> \n> If I go R to (4,1):\n> \n> - Head to (4,1), which was tail.\n> \n> - No food, so tail removed, which is (4,1), but since head moved to (4,1), and tail was there, tail is removed, so effectively, the snake shortens by one? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed.\n> \n> Here, head moves to (4,1), which was occupied by tail. After move, head is at (4,1), and the previous tail cell is vacated, so the snake consists of [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), ... , (5,1) ] and (4,1) was tail, but now head, and (5,1) was segment 14, now tail?

Free.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,0)\n   - (4,0) is a wall (y=0). Invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,1)\n   - (3,1) is occupied by the snake (body segment). Invalid (collision).\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,1)\n   - (5,1) is the tail of the snake. Safe (tail will move away).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **Food at (5,3)**:\n  - Cannot be eaten this turn because it is not adjacent to the head (requires two moves: right then up).\n  - Will disappear after this turn (life span 1).\n- **Food at (4,3)**:\n  - Accessible via Up to (4,2) then Up to (4,3) next turn.\n  - Life span 9, so no urgency.\n- **Food at (3,5)**:\n  - Occupied by the snake's body. Cannot be eaten immediately.\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,2)**:\n   - Next turn, can move Up to (4,3) to eat food (life span 9).\n   - Avoids immediate dead ends.\n2. **Move Right (R) to (5,1)**:\n   - Moves towards the right side, which may lead to a dead end (as seen in the analysis).\n   - No immediate benefit (no food eaten).\n\n### Dead End Analysis:\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,1) may lead to a dead end as the snake gets trapped in the right side with limited space.\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,2) allows more flexibility and access to the food at (4,3) next turn.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (4,2). This avoids dead ends and sets up the opportunity to eat the food at (4,3) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

But to eat it, the snake head must move to (5,3) only after the body moves away. Currently, the body is on (5,3), so if the snake moves, the tail will move, but let's see the current state.\n> \n> Head is at (4,1) moving right. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can go Up (U), Down (D), or Right (R), but not Left (L) because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so from (4,1), moving R would go to (5,1).

Tail is at (5,1), but when the snake moves, the tail will also move, so moving to (5,1) might be possible if the tail moves away.\n> \n> In Snake, when you move, the head goes to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail is removed, so if you move to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it's safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,1) is the current tail. If head moves to (5,1), since the tail will move to the next segment, but (5,1) is the last segment, so when head moves to (5,1), the new tail will be the previous segment, which is (5,2)?

Avoid!**\n\n2. **L (Left) to (3,2)**:\n   - (3,2) is occupied by the snake's body (segment 3). **Collision. Invalid move.**\n\n3. **R (Right) to (5,2)**:\n   - (5,2) is the current tail of the snake.\n   - Moving to the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - No food at (5,2), so the snake does not grow.\n   - This move keeps the snake alive and opens up future options.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The only safe move is **R (Right) to (5,2)**. The other moves either lead to immediate death or are invalid due to collisions.\n- The food at (3,5) cannot be eaten in time (it's under the body and will disappear soon), and the food at (4,3) is dangerous to eat now (traps the snake).

Segment 8 is (3,5).\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> So (3,5) is occupied by segment 8.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3): is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,2), (4,1), etc., no (4,3), so (4,3) is free and has food.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> For (3,5), it's under segment 8. When the snake moves, segment 8 will move to where segment 9 is? No, when snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> For example, current tail is (5,2). After move, head moves to new position, say (4,3), then the new body will be: head at (4,3), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, then (4,1), (3,1), ..., up to (5,3), and tail is (5,2) is gone, so (5,3) is new tail? Let's think indices.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves to new cell, the segment that was tail is removed, and the new tail is what was second last.\n> \n> In this case, current positions: index 0: (4,2), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (4,5), 12: (5,5), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,3), 15: (5,2)\n> \n> If head moves to (4,3), then new positions: head at (4,3), then body: old head (4,2) at pos1, (4,1) at pos2, (3,1) at pos3, ..., and the tail (5,2) is removed, so new snake is from (4,3) down to (5,3), with (5,3) as new tail? Positions: after move, segments: 0: new head, 1: old pos0, 2: old pos1, ..., 15: old pos14, and old pos15 is removed.\n> \n> Old pos14 is (5,3), so new tail is old pos14, which is (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly, for food under body at (3,5): currently occupied by segment 8. When the snake moves, segment 8 will move to where segment 9 is, which is (3,6), so (3,5) becomes empty if no food eaten, but since there is food, but the head isn't moving there yet.\n> \n> To eat food at (3,5), the body must move away, meaning that the segment occupying it moves, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, the segments shift, so if (3,5) is vacated, then head can move to it later.\n> \n> Specifically for turn 90, (3,5) is occupied, so cannot eat now.\n> \n> Now, life span: (3,5) has life span 3, so at turn 90, it will be there, but if not eaten, it disappears after turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,2), direction U, so possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,3)\n> \n> - L: to (3,2)\n> \n> - R: to (5,2)\n> \n> Cannot D, since opposite.\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid.\n> \n> First, (4,3): is it wall? No, walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,3) is within 1-6 in both, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,4),(2,4),(4,4),(5,6),(6,3), not (4,3). And not occupied by snake body? Snake positions: no (4,3), so free. And it has food, positive.\n> \n> But is it safe to move there? Moving to (4,3) would eat the food, since head moves to food cell.\n> \n> Then snake grows, so new head at (4,3), and tail stays, so new positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), ..., up to (5,3), and since it ate, we add a segment, so tail is (5,2)? When eating, after moving to food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, we add a new segment at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So from current positions, head moves to (4,3), and since (4,3) has food, it eats, so the body remains, and we add a new segment at the current tail position, so new tail is still (5,2), but now there are 17 segments.\n> \n> Positions: head: (4,3), then body: old head (4,2) at pos1, old pos1 (4,1) at pos2, ..., old pos14 (5,3) at pos15, old tail (5,2) at pos16? Indices: after move and eat, new head at (4,3), then segment 1: old head (4,2), segment 2: old pos1 (4,1), ..., segment 15: old pos14 (5,3), segment 16: old pos15 (5,2). And since it ate, we keep the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, the snake occupies all cells from head to tail.\n> \n> Now, is moving to (4,3) safe? After eating, the head is at (4,3), body includes (4,2), etc. But (4,3) is not colliding with body immediately.\n> \n> Potential future risks.\n> \n> But first, let's see other options.\n> \n> Move L to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied by snake? Current positions: segment 3 is (3,2), so yes, occupied by body. Cannot move there, collision with body.\n> \n> Segment 3 is (3,2), which is a body segment, not the tail. The tail is (5,2), but (3,2) is body, so if head moves to (3,2), it collides with its own body, death.\n> \n> So L to (3,2) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, move R to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by tail? Segment 15 is (5,2), tail.\n> \n> Now, moving to tail: the rule is, you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> So when head moves to (5,2), which is current tail, after move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to (5,2), which is tail, and if there is no food, the tail moves, so head is at (5,2), tail was (5,2) but moves, so new head is (5,2), and tail is removed, so no issue.\n> \n> But (5,2) might have food? Food positions: (3,5) and (4,3), not (5,2), so no food there.\n> \n> So moving to (5,2) is possible.\n> \n> Now, (5,2) is within grid, not wall, no internal obstacle.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3) or R to (5,2). L to (3,2) is invalid.\n> \n> Now, also, for U to (4,3), there is food, so eating it.\n> \n> For R to (5,2), no food, just move.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (4,3).\n> \n> After move: head to (4,3), eat food, snake grows to 17 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), and tail (5,2) since we add segment, tail is still (5,2).\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (4,3), body1 (4,2), body2 (4,1), body3 (3,1), body4 (3,2), body5 (2,2), body6 (2,3), body7 (3,3), body8 (3,4), body9 (3,5), body10 (3,6), body11 (4,6), body12 (4,5), body13 (5,5), body14 (5,4), body15 (5,3), body16 (5,2). Yes.\n> \n> Now, head direction: since we moved U, new direction is U.\n> \n> Now, from (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite), so U, L, R.\n> \n> U to (4,4): (4,4) is internal obstacle? Yes, (4,4) is in internal obstacles, blocked. Cannot move there.\n> \n> L to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by body? Body7 is (3,3), so occupied, collision if head moves there.\n> \n> R to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by body15? Body15 is (5,3), which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,2), so (5,3) is body, collision.\n> \n> After moving to (4,3), the body at (5,3) is segment 15, which is not tail, tail is (5,2).\n> \n> So from (4,3), moving:\n> \n> - U: (4,4) blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> - L: (3,3) occupied by body7, collision.\n> \n> - R: (5,3) occupied by body15, collision.\n> \n> All possible moves are invalid? That can't be right.\n> \n> U is blocked, L to (3,3) is body, R to (5,3) is body.\n> \n> But (3,3) and (5,3) are both body cells.\n> \n> Is there no safe move from (4,3)?\n> \n> But after moving to (4,3), the snake is there, and the body positions are fixed at that moment.\n> \n> At turn t=90, if we move U to (4,3), after the move, the head is at (4,3), and the body includes (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> Then for the next turn t=91, from (4,3), we need to move to adjacent cell.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (4,4) up, blocked.\n> \n> (3,3) left, occupied by body.\n> \n> (5,3) right, occupied by body.\n> \n> (4,2) down, but (4,2) is now occupied by body segment body1, since body1 is (4,2).\n> \n> And moving down to (4,2) would be collision.\n> \n> Also, direction: current direction after move is U, so for next move, cannot move D, which is down to (4,2).\n> \n> But even if we could, (4,2) is occupied.\n> \n> So from (4,3), no possible moves? That means if we move to (4,3), we die immediately on the next turn because no valid moves.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> Let's list the cells around (4,3):\n> \n> - North: (4,4) - obstacle\n> \n> - South: (4,2) - occupied by body\n> \n> - West: (3,3) - occupied by body\n> \n> - East: (5,3) - occupied by body\n> \n> All four directions are blocked or occupied, so indeed, if head is at (4,3), it has no escape; it will collide no matter what on the next move.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,3) is suicidal; it leads to immediate death on turn 91.\n> \n> So that move is very bad; we must avoid it.\n> \n> Therefore, the only viable move at turn 90 is to move R to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, (5,2) is the current tail.\n> \n> Move R to (5,2).\n> \n> Since no food there, no eating, so snake moves without growing.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (5,2), which was tail, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,2), then body: old head (4,2) at pos1, old pos1 (4,1) at pos2, old pos2 (3,1) at pos3, ..., up to old pos14 (5,3) at pos15, and old pos15 (5,2) is now head, so tail is old pos14 (5,3)?\n> \n> After moving to (5,2): new head at (5,2), which was old tail.\n> \n> Then segment 1: old head (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 2: old pos1 (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 3: old pos2 (3,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 15: old pos14 (5,3)\n> \n> And since no food, tail is removed, so old pos15 is gone, but we moved head to it, so new positions: indices 0 to 14: old pos0 to old pos14 except old pos0 is replaced? Better: the new body is the old positions from index 0 to 14, but shifted.\n> \n> New head: (5,2) which was old pos15\n> \n> Then new segment 1: old head (4,2) which was pos0\n> \n> New segment 2: old pos1 (4,1)\n> \n> New segment 3: old pos2 (3,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 15: old pos14 (5,3)\n> \n> And old pos15 is removed, but it's now head.\n> \n> So new snake: head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> Tail is (5,3)\n> \n> Length is still 16.\n> \n> Head direction: since we moved R, new direction is R.\n> \n> Now, at turn 90, we move R to (5,2).\n> \n> Then for turn 91, head at (5,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction R, cannot move L (opposite), so possible U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, positions:\n> \n> Head (5,2)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - R to (6,2)\n> \n> - U to (5,3)\n> \n> - D to (5,1)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> First, R to (6,2): (6,2) is within grid? x=6, y=2. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is ok, y=2 ok. Internal obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: after move, current positions have (5,3) which is tail, but (6,2) not occupied. So should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: after move to (5,2), positions are: (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> So (6,2) is empty.\n> \n> U to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by tail? Tail is (5,3), but since it's tail, we can move there, and it will move away.\n> \n> D to (5,1): (5,1) is within grid, should be free? Snake has (4,1), but not (5,1), and no obstacle, so free.\n> \n> Now, also, food: (3,5) and (4,3) are still there, but (3,5) is under body? Currently, after move, (3,5) is occupied by segment, let's see: positions, segment 9 is (3,5)? New positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (3,2), 5: (2,2), 6: (2,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5), 10: (3,6), 11: (4,6), 12: (4,5), 13: (5,5), 14: (5,4), 15: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> So (3,5) is occupied by segment 9.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is under body.\n> \n> (4,3) is free and has food.\n> \n> Now back to turn 91 moves.\n> \n> From (5,2), direction R.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - R to (6,2): free, no food.\n> \n> - U to (5,3): which is current tail, so can move, no food there? (5,3) has no food, so just move, tail moves away.\n> \n> - D to (5,1): free, no food.\n> \n> We need to think ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, food (3,5) has life span 3, so after turn 90, it has 2 turns left? Life span at turn 90 is 3, so countdown: on turn 90, life=3; turn 91, life=2; turn 92, life=1; turn 93, gone. So must be eaten by turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) has life=8, so from turn 90 to 97.\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is under body at (3,5). To eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Currently occupied by segment 9 at (3,5).\n> \n> When the snake moves, segment 9 will move to where segment 10 is, which is (3,6), so on next move, if snake moves such that segment 9 leaves (3,5), it becomes free, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But head is currently at (5,2), far away.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is free, but head is at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, for turn 91, I need to choose a move.\n> \n> Also, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid state.\n> \n> We can move R to (6,2), U to (5,3), or D to (5,1).\n> \n> Moving to (5,3): since it's tail, no issue, and after move, head to (5,3), tail was (5,3) but moves, so new head (5,3), new tail is (5,4)? After move to (5,3): new head (5,3), which was old tail, then segment1: old head (5,2), segment2: (4,2), ..., segment15: (5,4), and tail removed? Old positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,1), ..., (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving U to (5,3): new head (5,3), segment1: old head (5,2), segment2: old body1 (4,2), segment3: old body2 (4,1), ..., segment15: old body14 (5,4), and old tail (5,3) is now head, so new tail is old body14 (5,4).\n> \n> Positions: new: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (6,2): new head (6,2), segment1: (5,2), segment2: (4,2), ..., segment15: (5,3), tail (5,3)? Old tail was (5,3), but after move, new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail (5,3) is removed?

It's turn 91, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x. Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,2), and the body segments follow.

Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 91, it has 2 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 92? Life span is given as 2, so after 2 turns, it should be gone. Let me read: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 91, life span 2 means it will be there for turns 91 and 92, and disappear before turn 93.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) with value 1, life span 7, so it will last until turn 97.\n> \n> (6,4) with value 1, life span 10, until turn 100.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake length: positions list has 16 segments, so snake is 16 units long.

Moving here is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - **Left (L)**: (4, 3) - Contains positive food (+1).\n   - **Right (R)**: (6, 3) - Wall (internal obstacle), invalid.\n   - **Down (D)**: (5, 2) - Reverse direction, invalid.\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - **(3, 5)**: Value +1, life_span 1 (disappears after this turn). Currently under the snake's body at (3, 5), so cannot be eaten this turn.\n   - **(4, 3)**: Value +1, life_span 6. Accessible by moving left (L).\n   - **(6, 4)**: Value +1, life_span 9. Not adjacent to the head.\n\n4. **Immediate Options**:\n   - **Move U (Up)**: Safe, no food eaten.\n   - **Move L (Left)**: Eats food at (4, 3), but leads to a dead end next turn (no safe moves from (4, 3)).\n\n### Decision for Turn 92\n\n- **Move L (Left)**: Leads to eating food but results in immediate death on the next turn (no safe moves from (4, 3)). **Not viable**.\n- **Move U (Up)**: Safe, avoids death, and allows for future moves. The tail at (5, 4) will move away, so no collision.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 92\n\nThe only viable move to ensure survival is **Up (U)**. Moving left would lead to certain death on the next turn, while moving up keeps the snake alive and allows for future opportunities to eat food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 92. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So, I should visualize this grid.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), since x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7 are borders. So cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, internal walls at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). That's 16 segments, so the snake is long.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. So from (5,3), moving up would go to (5,4), but (5,4) is part of the snake body. Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (5,3)\n> \n> 1: (5,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,2)\n> \n> 3: (4,1)\n> \n> 4: (3,1)\n> \n> 5: (3,2)\n> \n> 6: (2,2)\n> \n> 7: (2,3)\n> \n> 8: (3,3)\n> \n> 9: (3,4)\n> \n> 10: (3,5)\n> \n> 11: (3,6)\n> \n> 12: (4,6)\n> \n> 13: (4,5)\n> \n> 14: (5,5)\n> \n> 15: (5,4)  # tail\n> \n> Positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> So tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction U, so last move was up to (5,3)? Head direction is U, meaning it's facing up, so it moved up to reach (5,3), I think. Let's see the previous position: since head is at (5,3), and it came from (5,2), because position 1 is (5,2), so it moved up from (5,2) to (5,3). So current direction is U, and it can't reverse to D instantly.\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life_span 1 (so disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 92, life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after turn 92 if not eaten. So must be eaten on turn 92 to get it.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (3,5) with life_span=1, on turn 92, if not eaten, it disappears after turn 92, meaning it's only available on turn 92. After turn 92, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) with value 1, life_span 6, so available for 6 turns including turn 92, so until turn 97.\n> \n> (6,4) with value 1, life_span 9, available until turn 100.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Food positions: (3,5), (4,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (3,5) at index 10. Position 10 is (3,5), which is part of the body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, (3,5) has food, but it's currently under the snake body. Specifically, segment at index 10: (3,5).\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, meaning the snake must move such that (3,5) is no longer occupied by body when head moves there.\n> \n> But life_span is 1, so only this turn to eat it.\n> \n> If the snake doesn't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, current turn is 92, head at (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is U, cannot move D (down). So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Move U: to (5,4)\n> \n> But (5,4) is the tail position. Tail is at (5,4), index 15.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is no longer part of the snake, unless the snake eats food and grows.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,4): (5,4) is currently the tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (5,4), and since it's the tail, but after move, the tail will move, so (5,4) will be free after the move? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail not removed, snake grows.\n> \n> But here, moving to (5,4), which is currently tail, but has no food? (5,4) is snake tail, but no food mentioned there. Food is at (3,5), (4,3), (6,4), not at (5,4).\n> \n> So moving to (5,4): since no food there, head moves to (5,4), tail is removed, so the snake shortens? No, the tail is removed only if no food eaten.\n> \n> If head moves to an empty cell, tail is removed, length same.\n> \n> If head moves to food, tail not removed, length increases.\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is currently occupied by tail, but it's not a food cell; food cells are separate.\n> \n> The grid has cells, some have food, some have snake, etc.\n> \n> (5,4) has the snake tail, but no food, so if head moves to (5,4), since it's not a food cell, it's just moving to an empty cell? But (5,4) is occupied by tail, but when head moves there, since it's the tail, and no food, the tail will be removed, so effectively, the snake moves forward, and the old tail is gone.\n> \n> But in terms of collision: moving to a cell that has the tail is safe because the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) should be safe, as long as it's only the tail and not another body part.\n> \n> Now, is (5,4) only the tail? From positions, index 15 is (5,4), and it's the last one, so yes, tail.\n> \n> But let's see what happens after move.\n> \n> If head moves to (5,4), then new head position (5,4), and the segment that was at (5,4) is now the second last or something? Positions update.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,3), then body down to tail (5,4).\n> \n> After move U to (5,4): new head is (5,4), then the previous head (5,3) becomes the first body segment, and so on, up to the previous tail (5,4) which was removed?

On turn 93, moving right eats the accessible food at (6,4) for +1 score and opens a path upward. Subsequent moves (turns 94-96) prioritize navigating to open areas to avoid dead ends and ensure long-term survival, as the food at (4,3) is inaccessible and the snake must steer clear of walls and body collisions.\n",

Snake positions don't have (6,4), so it should be free. But is there an obstacle? (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,4) is not, so it should be okay.\n> \n> (6,4) is playable? x=6,y=4, borders are x=0/x=7, so x=6 is within 1 to 6, y=4 within 1 to6, no obstacle listed, so yes.\n> \n> But moving to (6,4) would eat the food there, since it's positive food, so length increases by 1, score +1.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new head at (6,4), and body extends.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate action for turn 93.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - Move U to (5,5): safe, no food, just move.\n> \n> - Move R to (6,4): eat food, get +1, length becomes 17.\n> \n> - Move L: not possible, obstacle.\n> \n> - Move D: not allowed, reverse.\n> \n> So only U or R are possible?

Since current turn is 93, life span decreases each turn including current, so after turn 93, life span becomes 5, then 4, etc., gone after turn 98? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So for food at (4,3): life span 6 at turn 93. After turn 93, if not eaten, life span becomes 5 at turn 94, and so on, until turn 98, when it would be 0 and disappear? At turn 93, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left, including turn 93. So it can be eaten on turns 93,94,95,96,97, and disappears after turn 97 or at turn 98?\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it's gone. So at turn 93, with life span 6, it will be gone at the start of turn 99 or something? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,3): at turn 93, life span 6. After turn 93, if not eaten, at turn 94, life span is 5. After turn 94, 4, and so on, until after turn 98, life span becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 99 or at turn 99? I think it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Standard way: at the beginning of turn t, the life span is checked; if 0, it disappears before the turn.\n> \n> But for eating, during the turn, if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for (4,3) at turn 93, life span 6. It can be eaten on any turn from 93 to 98, and after being eaten or after turn 98, it's gone. Specifically, if not eaten by turn 98, at turn 99 it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,4), life span 8 at turn 93, so can be eaten from turn 93 to 100, gone at turn 101.\n> \n> Now back to turn 93 action.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (6,4) to eat food immediately. Score +1, length 17.\n> \n> Then head at (6,4), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Now, from there, possible moves: U, D, L, but not R? Direction is now R, so cannot move L (left) next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5), D to (6,3), but (6,3) is obstacle, wall, so cannot move D. L to (5,4), but (5,4) is where the body is? After moving to (6,4), the snake positions: head was at (5,4), moved to (6,4), so body segments: the previous head (5,4) is now part of body, and the tail (5,5) will move to the next position, but since we ate food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, we add a new segment.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so positions: new head at (6,4), then the previous head (5,4) is now the second segment, then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), and since we ate, (5,5) remains, and we add a new segment at the tail? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the body extends.\n> \n> Positions: after moving to (6,4) and eating, head is (6,4), then the body includes (5,4), (5,3), ..., up to (5,5), and (5,5) is still there because tail didn't move; we add a new segment at (5,5), so the tail is now (5,5) and the new segment is added, but since tail was at (5,5), it stays, and we add another cell? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves one step, and if it eats food, it grows, so the length increases by one, meaning that the tail position doesn't change; instead of removing the tail, we keep it.\n> \n> So before move, positions: head (5,4), then body segments down to tail (5,5).\n> \n> After move R to (6,4): head moves to (6,4), so new positions: head (6,4), then previous head (5,4) becomes neck, then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), ..., up to (5,5). But (5,5) was tail, and since we ate food, we don't remove the tail, so the tail is still (5,5), and we have a new segment at the end? No, the snake grows by not removing the tail segment.\n> \n> So positions after eating: [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ] — length 17, same as before but with head at (6,4) and all previous positions including tail (5,5) still there.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,5), which was the last segment.\n> \n> Now, from (6,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,5): is this free? y=5, x=6.

Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,5) from previous position.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including this one)\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food; no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current turn is 95.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a 6x6 grid since x and y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Grid cells:\n> \n> - Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are out of bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> - Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Tail: (4,6) is the last segment? Positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> So the snake forms a sort of loop or path. Let's plot this.\n> \n> Head at (4,5) moving left. Since direction is L, it came from right, so previous head was (5,5) or something? Positions: index 0: (4,5) head, index 1: (5,5), which is to the right, so since head is moving left, it must have been at (5,5) before moving left to (4,5). But in the list, (5,5) is the first body segment, which is correct.\n> \n> Now, from (4,5), possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be reverse, and rule says no instant reverse. Current direction L, so cannot move R (right) on next turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But since current direction is L, I cannot move R immediately.\n> \n> So from (4,5), possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, what are the adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,6) — but (4,6) is part of the snake body? Snake positions include (4,6), which is the tail? Let's see the list: positions are (4,5) head, then (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,6), (4,6). (4,6) is the last position, which is the tail segment.\n> \n> (4,6) is occupied by the tail. But according to rules, moving into tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so it's only dangerous if it causes a collision after movement.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell where the tail is, and the tail moves, it should be safe, as long as after movement, head doesn't hit body.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,3) is under the snake body? (4,3) is not in the snake positions; let's check.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> So (5,3) is a body segment. Food is at (4,3), which is not occupied by snake? (4,3) is not in the list; positions have (5,3) but not (4,3). So (4,3) should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) and (6,6) are food.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is adjacent? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> I should make a grid representation.\n> \n> Let me create a 6x6 grid, rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Cells:\n> \n> - Obstacles (walls): (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n> \n> - Snake: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> - Food: (4,3), (6,4), (6,6)\n> \n> (4,3) has food? But (4,3) is not occupied by snake, so it's free, but food is there.\n> \n> In the food list: (4,3,4,1) so position (4,3) with value 1, life span 4.\n> \n> But is (4,3) occupied? Snake has (5,3) at position index 3, but not (4,3). So (4,3) should be available.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) and (6,6) are food.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (4,3), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn 95. So if not eaten by turn 98, it disappears. Since current turn is 95, life span 4: present on turns 95,96,97, gone after that, so must be eaten by turn 98.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life span 6: turns 95 to 100, gone after.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 9: turns 95 to 103.\n> \n> Now, from head position (4,5), direction L, so can move U, D, L.\n> \n> - U: to (4,6) — (4,6) is currently the tail. But tail will move when snake moves, so if I move to (4,6), since it's the tail, and tail moves away, it should be safe, as long as no collision after.\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, body follows.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,6), which is current tail, then after move, head is at (4,6), and the tail was at (4,6), but since head moves there, and the segment that was tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, which is (3,6)? Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: [H: (4,5), B1: (5,5), B2: (5,4), B3: (5,3), B4: (5,2), B5: (4,2), B6: (4,1), B7: (3,1), B8: (3,2), B9: (2,2), B10: (2,3), B11: (3,3), B12: (3,4), B13: (3,5), B14: (3,6), T: (4,6)]\n> \n> If I move U to (4,6), new head position (4,6). Then the body: the first body segment moves to old head position (4,5), and so on, up to the tail. The current tail (4,6) is now occupied by head, so the tail segment disappears or moves? When snake moves, the tail moves to the position of the previous second last segment if not eating, but since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> Rule: when moving, if not eating food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed. If eating, tail is not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,6): (4,6) has food? Food is at (4,3), (6,4), (6,6), not at (4,6). (4,6) is tail, but no food there.\n> \n> (4,6) is not a food position; food are at (4,3), (6,4), (6,6). So (4,6) has no food, so if I move there, since it's the tail, head moves to (4,6), which was tail, but tail was there, now head is there, and since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new snake will have head at (4,6), and body from old (4,5) to old (3,6), but old (3,6) was B14, and T was (4,6).\n> \n> After move U to (4,6):\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - New body: segments 1 to 15: old head (4,5) becomes new body1, old B1 (5,5) becomes new body2, ..., up to old B14 (3,6) becomes new body15, and old tail (4,6) is gone.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,6), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) — and (4,6) was tail, but now head is there, so tail is removed, so the snake has 15 segments now? Original 16 segments.\n> \n> Original: 16 positions.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, body shifts, tail is removed, so new snake has same length, 15 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake length: when no food eaten, length stays same, so number of segments decreases by one? No.\n> \n> Initial positions: 16 cells occupied.\n> \n> After move: head moves to a new cell, say cell X, then the body: the segment that was at position 1 (first body) moves to the old head position, segment 2 moves to old position 1, ..., the last body segment moves to the position of the previous last body, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So the new snake occupies: new head at X, and the old positions except the tail is removed, so if there were N segments, after move without eating, still N segments, but the tail has moved to what was the second last.\n> \n> In terms of cells: old cells: C0 (head), C1, C2, ..., C_{N-1} (tail)\n> \n> After move to new cell P:\n> \n> - New head: P\n> \n> - New body1: C0\n> \n> - New body2: C1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New tail: C_{N-2} ?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 96 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacles (Walls)**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (4,6)\n  - Body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]\n  - Tail: (4,6) is the last segment, but since the head is at (4,6), this seems like a loop. Wait, the snake's positions are given as a list where the head is first, followed by body segments. So the tail is the last element in the list, which is (3,6).\n  \n  Wait, the snake positions are [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,6)], so head is at (4,6), and tail is at (3,6).\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: \"U\" (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards to reach (4,6) from its previous position. The previous position would be (4,5), since the first body segment is (4,5).\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (4,3): value = 1, life_span = 3 (disappears after Turn 98)\n  - (6,4): value = 1, life_span = 5 (disappears after Turn 100)\n  - (6,6): value = 1, life_span = 8 (disappears after Turn 103)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,6)\n\nFrom the current head position (4,6), with direction \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,7) - y=7 is a border wall. **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,5) - Check if this is safe.\n   - (4,5) is part of the snake's body (second segment). \n   - Rule: Moving into a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail. Here, (4,5) is not the tail (tail is (3,6)), so **invalid** (collision with body).\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,6) - Check safety.\n   - (3,6) is the tail segment. \n   - Rule: Moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away. **Valid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,6) - Check safety.\n   - (5,6) is an internal obstacle (wall). **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n   - Also, moving right from direction \"U\" is not an instant reverse (reverse would be \"D\"), so direction-wise it's allowed, but the wall blocks it.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (3,6).\n\n### Verifying the Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current head is at (4,6), tail at (3,6). They are adjacent (left of head is tail).\n- Is there food at the tail (3,6)? Checking the food positions: (4,3), (6,4), (6,6). No food at (3,6). So no danger here.\n\n### Checking Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan from Turn 95 suggested:\n- Turn 95: U\n- Turn 96: L\n- Turn 97: L\n- ...\n\nAt Turn 96, the suggested move is L, which aligns with our current valid move.\n\n### Next Steps After Moving Left to (3,6)\n\nIf we move to (3,6), the new head is at (3,6), and the tail was at (3,6), which is now the head. The new tail will be the previous second-to-last segment, which is (3,5).\n\nNew snake positions:\n- Head: (3,6)\n- Body: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (3,5)]\n- Tail: (3,5)\n\nDirection after moving left is \"L\".\n\n### Food Considerations\n\n- (4,3): Disappears after Turn 98. Currently at Turn 96, so can be eaten on Turns 96, 97, or 98.\n  - To eat (4,3), the head needs to move to (4,3). Currently at (4,6), with (4,5) and (4,4) blocked (body and wall respectively), so cannot reach (4,3) directly.\n- Other foods are too far to reach immediately.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 96\n\nThe only safe and valid move is **Left (L)** to (3,6). This aligns with the previous plan and avoids any collisions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

But in the list, (5,5) is the first body segment, which is correct.\n> \n> Now, from (4,5), possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be reverse, and rule says no instant reverse.

Snake positions include (4,6), which is the tail? Let's see the list: positions are (4,5) head, then (5,5), (5,4), ..., (3,6), (4,6). (4,6) is the last position, which is the tail segment.\n> \n> (4,6) is occupied by the tail. But according to rules, moving into tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so it's only dangerous if it causes a collision after movement.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So (4,3) should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) and (6,6) are food.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is adjacent?

When snake moves, the tail moves to the position of the previous second last segment if not eating, but since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> Rule: when moving, if not eating food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed.

Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (3,7) → y=7 is a wall → invalid.\n2. **D (Down)**: (3,5) → currently the tail → valid (tail will move away).\n3. **L (Left)**: (2,6) → not occupied → valid.\n4. **R (Right)**: (4,6) → occupied by body (not tail) → invalid.\n\nThus, only **D (Down)** or **L (Left)** are valid.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Option 1: Move D to (3,5)\n- New head: (3,5) (tail moves away, no food eaten).\n- Next moves: From (3,5), cannot move R (opposite to current direction D). Possible moves:\n  - D to (3,4): leads to dead end (no further moves).\n  - L to (2,5): safer, but may not lead to food soon.\n- Outcome: Not ideal for reaching food quickly.\n\n#### Option 2: Move L to (2,6)\n- New head: (2,6) (no food eaten).\n- Next moves: From (2,6), cannot move R (opposite to current direction L). Possible moves:\n  - D to (2,5): closer to food (1,5).\n  - L to (1,6): may lead to dead end.\n- Outcome: Better for exploring and potentially reaching food (1,5) or (6,6).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (4,3): Cannot be reached in time (disappears after turn 98).\n- (1,5): High life span, but eating it now leads to a dead end (trapped).\n- (6,4) and (6,6): Need to move right, but currently blocked by body.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\nGiven the constraints, the safest immediate move is **L (Left)** to (2,6). This avoids immediate dead ends and keeps options open for future moves towards other food.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 97. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,6), and the body segments follow: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is 16 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (3,6) from (4,6), I assume. Since positions are head first, from (4,6) to (3,6) is left.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 97, it has 2 turns left. After turn 97, it will have 1 turn left, and after turn 98, it should be gone. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N. Countdown starts at N and decreases by 1 each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is N, so after this turn, it will be N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. Since it decreases including current turn, at turn t, countdown = N, meaning it has N turns left including current.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - After turn t: countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + N - 1: countdown = 1? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think this means that when we are at turn t, the life span value is for the current state, and after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But the disappearance: \"disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N full turns from now.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something. To avoid confusion, let's look at the food given:\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 2 at turn 97. So at turn 97, life span 2, meaning it has 2 turns left including this one? Or after this turn, it has 1 left?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so for (4,3), at turn 97, life span 2. After turn 97 is processed, life span becomes 1. After turn 98 is processed, life span becomes 0 and it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for others:\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,5): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I should sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,6)\n> \n> Then: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,5), I think.

But since current head dir is L, I cannot move R immediately, because no instant reverse.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: to (3,5)\n> \n> - L: to (2,6)\n> \n> - R: to (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied by snake body, segment at index 1. But can I move there? Movement constraints: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), which is not (4,6). (4,6) is the first body segment after head.\n> \n> At turn start, before move, head is at (3,6), and after move, if I move to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except tail, it's collision. But tail is special because when head moves, tail also moves, so if head moves to where tail is, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a cell, if it's occupied by tail, moving there is ok, because tail moves. If occupied by non-tail body, collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,6), moving:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — what is at (3,5)? Snake positions: (3,5) is the tail, index 15. So moving to (3,5) is ok, because it's the tail, and tail will move.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) — is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc. (2,6) is not in the list, so free? But need to check walls or obstacles.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) — but (4,6) is occupied by index 1, which is body, not tail. So moving to (4,6) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Also, (4,6) is not tail; tail is (3,5).\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (3,5) — which is current tail, so ok, snake moves, head to (3,5), tail moves from (3,5) to... but when head moves to tail, since it eats? No, food is at other positions.\n> \n> (3,5) has food? Food positions: (4,3), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5). Not (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is just moving, no food, so snake head moves to (3,5), and tail is removed? No, when no food eaten, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: if no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail is removed from end.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,5): is there food? No, so head moves to (3,5), and tail (which was (3,5)) is removed? But head is moving to where tail is.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, head eats it, food disappears, snake grows: the tail does not move, so new segment added, length +1.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to cell, tail moves: the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Special case: if head moves to the cell where the tail is, and there is no food, then since tail moves away, head can occupy that cell without collision. The body is updated: head to new position, tail segment removed, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> If there is food at the tail cell, and head moves there, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> But here, no food at (3,5).\n> \n> So from (3,6), moving D to (3,5) is valid: head moves to (3,5), and since no food, tail is removed, so the new snake positions: head at (3,5), then the segments from index 1 to 14, but index 15 (tail) is removed, and positions shift.\n> \n> After move, new head position is (3,5), then the previous head (3,6) becomes part of body, but since we moved to (3,5), which was tail, let's think:\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), ..., (3,5) ] 16 segments.\n> \n> After moving D to (3,5):\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,5)\n> \n> - Since no food eaten, tail is removed. Tail was (3,5), which is now occupied by head, so we remove the last segment, which was (3,5), but head is there, so the new tail is the previous second last, which is (3,4)? Positions: index 14 is (3,4), index 15 is (3,5).\n> \n> After move: head is at (3,5), then the body starts from the previous head (3,6) to the segment before tail, which is index 14 (3,4).

No, length unchanged, but positions: we have 15 segments now? Original 16 segments.\n> \n> Before: 16 cells occupied.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position (3,5), which was occupied by tail, so that cell is still occupied, but the tail is removed from (3,5), but head is there, so we add head at (3,5), and remove tail from (3,5), but since it's the same cell, the cell is occupied, and we remove the last segment, which was at (3,5), so now we have the new head at (3,5), and the body from (3,6) to (3,4), so 15 segments?

The new segment is added at the head position, but since head moves to food, the body includes the previous head.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a food cell, new head position is the food cell, and the previous positions are all kept, so the tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> The cell where food is, when head moves there, it becomes part of the snake.\n> \n> In the case where the food is under the tail, and head moves there, it might cause collision if not careful.\n> \n> But for now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) - y=7, wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - currently tail, so can move there, no food, so snake moves, tail removed, head at (3,5)\n> \n> - L: (2,6) - need to check if free.

Since positions are head first, from (4,6) to (3,6) is left.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 97, it has 2 turns left. After turn 97, it will have 1 turn left, and after turn 98, it should be gone. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N. Countdown starts at N and decreases by 1 each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is N, so after this turn, it will be N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. Since it decreases including current turn, at turn t, countdown = N, meaning it has N turns left including current.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - After turn t: countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + N - 1: countdown = 1? No.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think this means that when we are at turn t, the life span value is for the current state, and after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But the disappearance: \"disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N full turns from now.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something. To avoid confusion, let's look at the food given:\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 2 at turn 97. So at turn 97, life span 2, meaning it has 2 turns left including this one? Or after this turn, it has 1 left?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so for (4,3), at turn 97, life span 2. After turn 97 is processed, life span becomes 1. After turn 98 is processed, life span becomes 0 and it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for others:\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,5): value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I should sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,6)\n> \n> Then: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,5), I think. Positions: index 0: (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (3,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (3,4), 15: (3,5) — so 16 segments, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,6), and it was moving left to get there, so from (4,6) to (3,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R (opposite, which would be instant reverse). Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on next turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But since current head dir is L, I cannot move R immediately, because no instant reverse.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: to (3,5)\n> \n> - L: to (2,6)\n> \n> - R: to (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied by snake body, segment at index 1. But can I move there? Movement constraints: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Tail is at (3,5), which is not (4,6). (4,6) is the first body segment after head.\n> \n> At turn start, before move, head is at (3,6), and after move, if I move to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except tail, it's collision. But tail is special because when head moves, tail also moves, so if head moves to where tail is, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a cell, if it's occupied by tail, moving there is ok, because tail moves. If occupied by non-tail body, collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,6), moving:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — what is at (3,5)? Snake positions: (3,5) is the tail, index 15. So moving to (3,5) is ok, because it's the tail, and tail will move.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) — is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc. (2,6) is not in the list, so free? But need to check walls or obstacles.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) — but (4,6) is occupied by index 1, which is body, not tail. So moving to (4,6) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Also, (4,6) is not tail; tail is (3,5).\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (3,5) — which is current tail, so ok, snake moves, head to (3,5), tail moves from (3,5) to... but when head moves to tail, since it eats? No, food is at other positions.\n> \n> (3,5) has food? Food positions: (4,3), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5). Not (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is just moving, no food, so snake head moves to (3,5), and tail is removed? No, when no food eaten, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: if no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail is removed from end.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,5): is there food? No, so head moves to (3,5), and tail (which was (3,5)) is removed? But head is moving to where tail is.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, head eats it, food disappears, snake grows: the tail does not move, so new segment added, length +1.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to cell, tail moves: the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Special case: if head moves to the cell where the tail is, and there is no food, then since tail moves away, head can occupy that cell without collision. The body is updated: head to new position, tail segment removed, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> If there is food at the tail cell, and head moves there, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> But here, no food at (3,5).\n> \n> So from (3,6), moving D to (3,5) is valid: head moves to (3,5), and since no food, tail is removed, so the new snake positions: head at (3,5), then the segments from index 1 to 14, but index 15 (tail) is removed, and positions shift.\n> \n> After move, new head position is (3,5), then the previous head (3,6) becomes part of body, but since we moved to (3,5), which was tail, let's think:\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), ..., (3,5) ] 16 segments.\n> \n> After moving D to (3,5):\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,5)\n> \n> - Since no food eaten, tail is removed. Tail was (3,5), which is now occupied by head, so we remove the last segment, which was (3,5), but head is there, so the new tail is the previous second last, which is (3,4)? Positions: index 14 is (3,4), index 15 is (3,5).\n> \n> After move: head is at (3,5), then the body starts from the previous head (3,6) to the segment before tail, which is index 14 (3,4). So new positions: [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] and tail is now (3,4), since we removed the last one.\n> \n> Length decreased? No, length unchanged, but positions: we have 15 segments now? Original 16 segments.\n> \n> Before: 16 cells occupied.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position (3,5), which was occupied by tail, so that cell is still occupied, but the tail is removed from (3,5), but head is there, so we add head at (3,5), and remove tail from (3,5), but since it's the same cell, the cell is occupied, and we remove the last segment, which was at (3,5), so now we have the new head at (3,5), and the body from (3,6) to (3,4), so 15 segments? No.\n> \n> Let's list indices.\n> \n> Original positions: let's say S[0] = (3,6), S[1] = (4,6), S[2] = (4,5), S[3] = (5,5), S[4] = (5,4), S[5] = (5,3), S[6] = (5,2), S[7] = (4,2), S[8] = (4,1), S[9] = (3,1), S[10] = (3,2), S[11] = (2,2), S[12] = (2,3), S[13] = (3,3), S[14] = (3,4), S[15] = (3,5)\n> \n> After moving D to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head position: (3,5)\n> \n> - Since no food, we remove the tail, which is S[15] = (3,5)\n> \n> - But new head is at (3,5), so we add new head at (3,5), and remove S[15] at (3,5), so the cell (3,5) is occupied by new head, and S[15] is removed, so the body is S[0] to S[14], but S[0] is now the first body segment at (3,6), S[1] at (4,6), ..., up to S[14] at (3,4)\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,5), then body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) — so 15 segments? But S[14] is (3,4), which is the new tail.\n> \n> Original length 16, after move no food, length should be 16? I think I confused the indexing.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - When head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, head occupies it, food eaten, tail does not move, so snake grows: new positions are [new_head] + previous positions, so length +1.\n> \n> - If no food, head occupies new cell, tail is removed from the end, so new positions are [new_head] + previous positions[:-1], so length same.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,5): which is currently occupied by tail S[15] = (3,5).\n> \n> Since we move to it, and there is no food, so:\n> \n> - New head at (3,5)\n> \n> - Then the body is the previous head and body except the last segment: so S[0] to S[14] become the body, with S[0] at (3,6) as first body segment, S[14] at (3,4) as tail.\n> \n> But S[14] is (3,4), which was not the tail before.\n> \n> Positions: new snake: head (3,5), then S[0] (3,6), S[1] (4,6), S[2] (4,5), S[3] (5,5), S[4] (5,4), S[5] (5,3), S[6] (5,2), S[7] (4,2), S[8] (4,1), S[9] (3,1), S[10] (3,2), S[11] (2,2), S[12] (2,3), S[13] (3,3), S[14] (3,4) — so 15 positions, but S[14] is (3,4), which was S[14] before, and S[15] removed, so length is 15 now? But originally 16 segments, after move with no food, length should be 16? No.\n> \n> Mistake: when we add new head, and remove tail, the number of segments remains the same if no food eaten.\n> \n> Original segments: 16 cells.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head at new position, say P\n> \n> - The previous positions from head to the second last are kept, so we have new head + positions [S[0] to S[14]] for the body, that's 1 + 15 = 16 positions, but S[0] to S[14] is 15 positions, plus new head, 16, yes.\n> \n> S[0] to S[14] are 15 segments, but S[0] is the old head, which becomes the neck, so the body has 15 segments including the neck, but total snake is new head + 15 body segments = 16 segments.\n> \n> Then the tail is the last of the body, which is S[14] = (3,4).\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), then body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) — so (3,4) is new tail.\n> \n> And the cell (3,5) is occupied by head, no problem.\n> \n> Similarly, if there was food at (3,5), then eating it, head to (3,5), food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: head (3,5), then all previous positions S[0] to S[15], so length +1 to 17, tail at S[15] = (3,5) but now it's body, and new tail is S[15] only if we add, but S[15] is (3,5), which is now occupied by head, so positions: head (3,5), then S[0] (3,6), S[1] (4,6), ..., S[15] (3,5), but S[15] is (3,5) same as head, conflict.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> When food is eaten at a cell, head moves to that cell, and the tail remains, so the snake grows by one segment. The new segment is added at the head position, but since head moves to food, the body includes the previous head.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a food cell, new head position is the food cell, and the previous positions are all kept, so the tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> The cell where food is, when head moves there, it becomes part of the snake.\n> \n> In the case where the food is under the tail, and head moves there, it might cause collision if not careful.\n> \n> But for now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) - y=7, wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - currently tail, so can move there, no food, so snake moves, tail removed, head at (3,5)\n> \n> - L: (2,6) - need to check if free.

No, in grid, adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so |dx| + |dy| =1 for orthogonal adjacency.\n> \n> So (2,5) adjacent cells: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5).
